Bunch of threads on this. There are "fixes". I actually wrote up one myself a long while back.

*only a fucking coward hides! I promise ill make it nice and quick...you can trust me*
---
So why not use party chat on console or other similar program on pc. All of which are superior to any on game chat system on any game?
---
Fantastic post. I will spend $150 on atoms if the Bethesda community team would stream themselves completing the daily/weekly challenges in one go over a full week.
---
Honestly I got tired of turning in tickets.  Disappearing items, bugged Daily quests, etc. etc..  I'm sure this along with things like Grafton Dam and Valley Galleria not registering for anyone as locations will be fixed eventually (or not)

Now you wont have to scroll way back.
---
Unfortunately so, feels like a missed opportunity to me.
---
In adventure mode, you get a 1:1 caps ratio based on the level of the person you killed. They changed it in survival so you only get like 25 caps or something maximum so most people that feel like being jerks hop over to adventure now and attack workshops hoping they can kill the owner. 99.9% of the time they never actually want the workshop
---
This...   I used to craft a ton of food and boiled water and was using wood like crazy.   I could get about 200 wood in 10 minutes in the forrest south of Top of the World with the wood chucker perk. 
---
It was one of the concerns that I had when I moved to the Mire as you can’t farm wood there.  
---
I’ve since switched to purified water and the meat I find along the way.  Just picking up mops, cutting boards, etc. satisfies what I need.
---
I never got why they call it awesome. Like surely that's a matter of opinion, and depends on how is cooked.
---
Holy shit
---
I love this idea but..... one issue popped into my head immediately.
---
Fusion cores.
---
Right on. The amount of players becoming "wanted" is dropping significantly as the game matures, so if somebody commits a crime it should be worth it to pursue them. Heck, sometimes when I spawn stuck inside someone's camp, I'll sometimes decide to take the hit and either lockpick my way out or punch a hole in the wall (it beats sitting through another loading screen and it's more fun). It's rare, but sometimes I'll play the part of the dirty drunk raider my character is (sorry/not sorry).   
---
The damage one can do to a camp should be reflected in the bounty on their head. If I cost you a handful of resources + hassle, then I should be charged a solid 40 caps per material, and a tasty 300 caps if I happen to kill you. Make justice attractive. I haven't figured out what the defending party loses if they don't succeed in protecting themselves, but half the offender's bounty might work.
---
Because the grape mentats are wearing off lol
---
Did all vaults have GECKs?  Spoil: Ik know one is also in a vault in FO3
---
That is how it functioned in fallout 4. I believe it overrides goat legs just how the refrigerated backpack overrides good with salt.
---
did you want to talk about it?
---
Laser and plasma are kinda weak in comparison to firearms, which is fine, but the sniper barrels for each don't add enough damage imo. They used to be great in FO4 but they just don't cut it late-game without great legendary effects with a specific build for them, but the same could be said for most weapons. I've got an anti-armour Plasma Rifle with sniper barrel and it's...okay. Good for turning scorched humans to goo at least. I'd pay thousands for an instigating one

When turret camps at the golf course could be destroyed I was always finding players and asking them to kill me, I also always went back and thanked them lol.
---
 Just go buy em'. I'm seeing 400 and 500caps  mostly for Serum. A good deal.
---
Hmm weird. I didn't move it that's for sure. I must have done something wrong. Once I add it to the machine with a price I don't need to do anything else right? It's locked in as long as I don't touch the item in my stash?
---
The more a player, even a vendor, can hold the greater the inflation.
---
It's better that prices are somewhat controlled.  The opening of player vendor shops has decimated the black market for specialized items and has dropped the ridiculous pricing of things from 50000 caps into the more accessible, player limit range.
---
It's better for everyone if the limit is restricted (and by everyone, I mean the people who actually play the game to play it .... not as their occupation, with the hopes of making money.  I don't think any video game is designed with the idea of making full time gaming a real job).
---
Sounds like something that Survival should have been. The mode is still in BETA so maybe Bethesda will play around with more hardcore elements
---
dang, this makes me filled with unhappy. thanks for the update. i was thinking that it was probably just a bug, but i didnt want to believe it. its disappointing, i havent really had a desire to use the camera too much, but i was hoping i had found something. thanks for the updates.
---
Redstone? For what? Just plop down a pressure plate for automatic doors. Nice job doing it in fallout tho. Makes me miss fo4 where we could afford to build complex bases.
---
Thanks! I'll try deleting my saved data to see if it helps
---
That market has dropped like a stone.  Saying it here won't bring it back.  Player Vending has crashed that market.  And good riddance to it.
---
Try the cache clear first, way easier.
---
It is time indeed
---
 Wrong. Combat Knives, now I've given it away. ;)
---
The only ones I've seen have been 2500 ;(
---
Near top of world station there should be a good one maybe
---
Correct, and in your stash it will have a little icon next to it indicating that it’s in the vending machine
---
You play on PC?  I've never had a problem with disappearing items (knock on wood).  I also have a pretty solid gaming PC with 16g of ram, an 8g graphics card and a 100mbs connection speed, so everything loads in within a second or two after fast traveling.  I've seen dropped items from team-mates at their fast travel point, namely silo code pieces, technical data and keys, but never had it happen to me.
---
If you play on console, systems that can't really be enhanced with aftermarket upgrades, BGS really needs to make some major overhauls to maximize stability so that the game works on contemporary gaming systems.  Not everyone has the resources and knowhow to build a gaming PC that can easily run 76, and it shouldn't be that way.
---
Not sure how that’s an issue. The game does cheat a little when giving enemies ammo. Not to mention the infinite NPC core duration in FO4.
---
I have several of both weapon at least 2 instigating. 
---
I only have 2 3* lasers a furious and vampires. And both being pretty good killing SB/Q. My only problem is the ammo needed to match ballistic guns. 
---
They serve well as support weapons.
---
They reset every Monday night.
---
Because the devs have nothing to do with pre-ordering or any of the marketing, that's all corporate
---
You need to change autosave time in your Fallout76Custom.ini file.  I have mine set at 2.  The default is 10 (minutes)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for collecting quests, the system doesn't count what you already have.  Try dropping it on the ground and then picking it up.  Maybe that will trigger the quest requirements.
---
Current codes are 
---
ALPHA: 24635428
---
BRAVO: 25029246
---
CHARLIE: 08820735
---
not with itself from the same player. Unsure if it stacks with multiple players; I doubt it, that'd be OP. But it stacks with the perk, yes.
---
Ye but it’s not at all that simple. It goes deeper than “a few voice lines”. We have literal HOURS of dialogue, and many many many lines describe key features in a BR. Regarding to the lunch boxes, we still don’t know if they’ll be in game or not. They never said they weren’t, and with repair kits we know they won’t be against adding them. And even if the lunchboxes were canned, some atom lunch boxes are vastly different than an entire gamemode. What we see in the files is what we’re getting
---
No that's like doing more pay to win
---
Did u get a chance to join in?
---
This is true.
---
You put a ONE star Bloodied anything but a handmade in a vending machine for 3K and it sits there un-bought for weeks.  
---
I tested this out.  There is now a reasonable rate for transactions that has been set by the average buyer .... that IS what the free market actually does. when their are more shops and vendors.
---
The market before player vending was anything but a free market economy, and what was before is now gone for good .... thank you Bethesda.
---
Where would you find a backpack mod I read about them but I thought it was purchasable in the atom shop
---
Is it just a plan you have to find in the wasteland?
---
looks like the person i was trading with likely knew both plans. see edit
---
Right!? I don't think I've ever used in game chat. Always console party.
---
Sorry, but that's not a fix; people would just spawn off cliffs or inside rocks/other objects more often.
---
Thanks fellow bot.
---
I heard that it just pushes you off!
---
I mean, they'll be shot by it lol
---
the person I attempted to trade with was most likely mistaken. another person confirmed it as not known that only knows combat and metal.
---
I did this one a few weeks ago by using my explosive shotty to move a mutant hound corpse to the bog town where there was a behemoth.
---
Basically what I did was just hopped until I saw them both.
---
Same for the cryptid picture challenge I thought I wasn’t going to finish it this week but then the flatwoods monster came to my camp and baam all rng
---
I can tell you now that it doesnt. I recently did it again and i just fell straight through into the small room below it. I really wish you could ride the nuke.
---
I got mine from doing the quests associated with the Sheepsquatch event. I'm not sure how many there are but I didn't get all of them from doing those quests alone. So, there may be other quests that reward them too.
---
Honestly and the only reason I kept the railway is because a bunch of people were saying it's getting more popular cuz it's powerful and I always thought it just wasn't that good, but low and behold it didn't sell cuz it's not the best rifle period. I think it's like the crossbow, a niche item only some players want. Plus the ammo is heavy as balls. If there wasn't a weight limit I wouldn't mind having stuff in my shop for weeks but there is so you need things to sell quickly which they never do
---
Perhaps they changed how it handles it.
---
This build is not optimized.
---
Idk about chat but human npc's will probably make the game more realistic thats my opinion
---
I figured the flamer barrel would probably be the best option, it does gimp the range though right?
---
Props for fixing your post! Yea its just apparently a rare rng spawn still, but I can atleast guarantee I found it at bos after the most recent patch
---
This. Let’s be honest. Power armor is supposed to be the absolute end game for armor. They deployed it extensively in the war and the X-01 is technically a superior prototype and the only thing better is arguably the ultracite. My DR in X-01 is like 450 something points. I’ve rocked bolstering, vanguard and unyielding. None got me to almost 500 DR. Sure the other are legendary with the appropriate perks, but Power armor should be the final say in armor. They should’ve made it Way harder to obtain. But like TSE, they screwed that up.
---
Yea
---
Fyi, not sure on legitimacy or if or when it will happen. So take this with a grain of salt. 
---
But i recall seeing a post from a dataminer a while back indicating files show Legendary Power Armor. That might be the balance you've been waiting for.... unfortunately that's all the info floating around at this point.
---
Well, if you or anyone is worried about that, simply equip Light Footed and start sneaking before you fast travel to a camp.  If there are traps, congrats you are safe and can just fast travel away and add that person to a blacklist of sorts.  If there aren't traps, you can stand up and continue on with business.
---
Try just advertising on market
---
Wouldn’t it be easier for ur teammate to fall from a height and down themselves then u revive them?
---
It would be a cool thing to add I bet it's in design right now.
---
Welcome to Mutant World where the only thing strange is being normal.....
---
Daily sods quests
---
I've been hunting these for months. I've also been sharing information with others that are looking to find them. I'm all about getting good information for us all.
---
The best way  is go with a team to New Gad, and just let the Super Mutants shoot you in the knee deep water and when you drop have your team mate bring you back.  
---
 A friend and I tried various things, PVP, have a Mirelurk attacks us, kite a Yao Gaui into a Whitesprings pond... it took so much time.  
---
but yeah getting shot by enemies is easier than getting dropped by melee peeps  
---
add me on PC and i will help if you need
---
Played for the first time in months just the other day. I wanted see how the DLC was. Not even 5 mins after logging in, a lvl 6 starts punching me. I dont initiate combat, just start dancing around him. I then go about my way and he follows me, shooting me constantly. Its not doing anything to me, but annoying me. So i figure hes level 6. Im sure i can kill him in one hit.. i fire back, hit him, and bring most of his health down. Then without a hesitation, another player thats been crouching the entire time that i wasnt aware of, comes out and one hits me. They follow me throught the map doing this over and over again. Sucks for them tho, i dont have many caps, and dont carry junk on me at all. This was on ps4.
---
If someone has a bounty. Kill the asshole. They deserve it
---
I've had quests erase or auto complete before. So try checking your pipboy and see if they show completed. It might have reverted and need to start quest over. Or perhaps it auto completed and you just need to initiate the next quest.
---
If not mistaken after all that is done, next is Defiance has Fallen. You start it at one of the terminals in Abby's Bunker.
---
Never played Escape from Tarkov. I only saw Juicehead's vid on the leaks and that does seem plausible, but until we see something official, I'm hoping the BR angle isn't final - instead I'm hoping that it's either misdirection or cut content.
---
There's a daily event called Stings and Things that's given by Treadly at the Dolly Sods lodge. This gives mounted stuff plans as rewards.
---
Most people I've interacted with have been nice. But stories like this make me avoid other players like the plague. XD
---
That actually sounds pretty awesome!
---
and thank you for sharing your information and experience.
---
I’m level 51 but once I get to 100+ I plan to become a hunter of bounty players. Had too many players attack me because I ignored their trading requests or they were just assholes
---
That’s why I always carry just a single unit of fertilizer when I go to take a workshop. 
---
If I die, you’re getting a bag of shit. 
---
Congratulations.
---
Todd can kiss my ass. 
---
Yeah I play the game and have fun with it now but I didn’t mess with it after the first month, I didn’t start playing it again until we got brewing.
---
I haven’t forgotten that he showed up at E3 last year and made a bunch of half assed promises that surprise, they broke. I really won’t care what he says this year other than checking out the new content for 76.
---
I bought a $60 game that I played for 3 weeks, and dropped for 4 months because the bugs and other problems were such shit.
---
That’s ok though, this might be my fourth BGS title but the next one: I’m not buying at launch. BGS will never see another blatant $60 or collectors edition buy from me just because of how shitty they handled this.
---
It takes years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to destroy it. Unfortunately for BGS that’s the Fallout they’re gonna deal with from now on. 
---
You could say obviously they won’t miss what they won’t have but you can’t tell me they won’t notice a difference in their numbers for future game sells versus the past.
---
see my edit above.
---
I hate that I can't even get inside power armour without instantly being over encumbered. I can carry all this stuff yeah the second I step inside an awesome marvel of machinery requiring a powerful fusion core to operate I can't even carry my groceries any more. A walking tank that's so much more limited than it should be
---
Brilliant! I may have to do that!
---
I really hope so because every time I afk farm fusion cores some level 300 comes and wipes me with one shot
---
Being able to choose and tag perk loadouts would be genius in a mode like that! It would give it some more playability by experimenting with different loadouts
---
Yes I did. Thnx
---
that appears to have been the case
---
They should learn to backflip out of the way BEFORE dieing...
---
I'd do it on Survival actually.  Maybe build a maze that is full of traps and make sure the ft point is the middle of the maze.  I even know a few spots where I could build in a way that lets me hide beneath the foundations so I don't have to go into stealth or ft away when people show up.
---
However, that's Survival and I'd mainly be fishing for griefers.  Would never do anything like it in Adventure mode.
---
I'm too old to understand this.
---
Anti-Armor and Explosive
---
I've seen a number of those items you are talking about at vendor stations for 10-15 K (a couple for 25K or the limit)
---
I NEVER saw them before player vending, and the market was 40-50K.
---
I know MOST ppl here get what I'm saying. .... the ones who now have one of those items that "truly outclass others" only because the cap limit and vending machines, has made them affordable to players that ONLY play one character, because its a game and not a full time job for them.
---
Personal experience. The perk card doesn't say just for PA, it says power cores last longer
---
helping someone go through silos the first time is nice I enjoy it. showing up on the scene and being the hero that turns the tide for a small group struggling against the sheepsquatch is nice. but going back to the silo over and over is tedious. explaining the same stuff over and over to the same person gets tedious. so yeah in some situation's helping others gets tedious .
---
Oh, you’re definitely going to buy Fallout 5.
---
If I like what I see after launch 👎
---
There are so many quicker and easier ways to make caps than killing people. If you max out the vendors instantly there's always trading and vending, no ones THAT desperate for cash that there's a good reason to go round messing with people
---
It’s not. They are already adding in hints and teases that tie back to the leaked dialogue, so it’s final.
---
I bought mine from whitesprings shopping centre.
---
I had close my roof in a fucked up manner because the correct piece was said to be floating.
---
I was in that spot for a bit. You cant avoid it, you are attacked.
---
yh i agree needs a serverwide message to pop as ive run it 3 times on weekend and only had 1 or 2 others join.
---
The only time mine emptied was when I accessed my stash in server where my camp could not be placed.
---
True. I should have said - large cities.
---
How'd you lose 300 caps and not think to change anything
---
The internet has always been like this. Even before. The first thing programmers did was allow players to compete against each other, even if it was pong. Then killed each other in tanks. I'm sure the response to the very first internet post was a flame. In these shared open worlds, especially ones that limited grieving interactions griefers had to get nore creative. Way back 2013 in GTA I remember being invited to someone's garage, the being immediately shot in the back of the head from that one glitch. 
---
I'm not saying give up on humanity, just limit your exposure (to danger, not humanity) and keep your guard up.
---
I agree with you.
---
For most FO fans, the notion of online gives us the opportunity to interact with others who love the game, the building, the creativity.
---
There should have been a quest line to get vending machine plans.  There should be more effort put into making travelling and seeing other camps easier, and more enjoyable.  There should be full access for all players to the BEST gear (weapons and armour), and more work into a better way to communicate.
---
Less PvP ... Less Survival .... Less Hunter/Hunted ... Less trying to sell the game to Fortnight players who want Fortnight to be more like Fallout. ... let Fortnight try to attract FO fans ... they never will.
---
my RNG luck seems to suck. This is my third copy of this plan.
---
Indeed I do have a mic!
---
Nah, have a better advertising system that allows for more precise inventory promotion.  That way someone like me who sells low quality goods can advertise.  I dont really care if I sell anything, but some caps are better than none.
---
Does anyone know what all mounts are available
---
Wait but youve been buying them? Even though they have the same name, it showed as if I didnt know it once I had marine already unlocked. So wait until you see the same name that shows as if its not known
---
I’m down I’m trying to level up
---
On xbox360 or xbox one?
---
I've never encountered this before . Could be Xbox players. I play on ps4 and everyone I've meet has been tops
---
I'll keep that in mind
---
Just because you cannot see the weight value doesn't mean it isn't there. 90% reduction of .001 is .0001 same for any of the values. so .006 becomes .0006... if you have bandolier equipped you won't be able to see the weight values of most ammo, how would you know if if the armor pieces work? I'm calling bullshit here.
---
Ok message me on xbox and ill be online in a little bit.
---

---
This is my recommendation on what is must have for melee. Depending on if you use one handed, two handed, or unarmed just swap out the corresponding cards in Str category. If you dont care about carry weight then you can swap out strong back for martial artist. If you have bloodied weapons I suggest getting int to 3 and maxing out nerd rage. That would leave you 19 points to invest in defensive perks, or power armor perks if you use PA.
---
Hmm I wonder?
---
Could lighting be different between PC and consoles?
---
What was there to change? I was in pacifist mode. I was at my workshop. These two guys come in here and killed me. And for some reason I kept spawning at the workshop right next to them and they kept killing me. Over and over and again. For a minute there I thought it was a glitch or something. I had to turn the Xbox off to fix it. I was soo pissed.
---
I appreciate immersion in videogames, but apparently, kids these days walk other route.
---
 No way to get immersion when you leave the vault, waiting for an apocalyptic scenary, and the first "survivor" you find is a giant Bugs Bunny with guns jumping over buildings...
---
Holy crap. I just noticed that about myself from your reply. My wife does all the house related deco stuff. she often asks for my opinion and would like me to be involved but I cannot CANNOT bring myself to even give a crap. today I spent two hours adding a 2 block extension to my camp. I added a male and female bathroom inside and ended up having to shift the whole interior around to make it look cool. Its a one power armor garage / vendor shop red brick and rustic metal walls. signs lettering whole 9 yards. Where is that interest in my real life home.
---
Leave the server, dipstick
---
16 serums different  - 500 caps  each. psn CLotUSvss
---
I looted a second that I traded away. I traded for the one I have currently for a robot plan. I figured it was a fair trade and I could use it to get the actual combat armor plan.
---
Although, if I saw one on a vendor for a low price, I probably would buy it.
---
Np....thanks for the help
---
This would only work if I wanted to play PvP .... which I don't.  Ever.  No matter how well thought out it is ..... I prefer solo, and I don't mind helping others (co-op but not in "teams").  I think the OP is selling more of what I am saying than what you suggest.
---
Quick edit: seeked revenge not deemed
---
It shouldn't, this guy is full of poo. With just bandolier any ammo that weighs in the .009-.001 range will show .000 because a 90% reduction of .009 is .0009 and likewise the rest of the ammo. Since the weight is restricted to 3 digits you cannot see the value if you have bandolier equipped.
---
You have to complete the pioneer scout questline. Basically do some tasks to earn badges. Just completing it gets you the standard backpack, but if you earn more badges can trade in for upgrades. 
---
Anything in atom shop is just cosmetic. The one from questline adds carry weight to your character
---
In all seriousness F
---
Because my total weight comes down when I equip the piece. Not rocket science man so call bullshit all you’d like. I put the gear on my total carry weight goes down, I take the gear off and it goes up.
---
If the issue in game is the servers trying to track items in game, why doesn't the stash automatically condense things at intervals of ten? If you stash 100 stims, they're condensed into 10 bulk stims
---
I agreed with him in the sense that more people in the beta and a longer beta would have shed light on more problems, as some weren't as well known, but I think he only had half the answer. The other major factor was that there was only like 2 weeks between the beta and launch. They needed AT LEAST three months, preferably six, to iron out the major bugs, as shown by the fact so many known bugs were present in game on day 1.
---
It was my pleasure.
---
Ranged IS safer, on it's own. 
---
That being said, 2h melee really only has value in nuke zones, in power armor. Outside of that, unarmed melee is vastly superior. 
---

is my unarmed tank build. I'm not calling it optimized either, but it works \*very\* well for me. And I'm using convenience cards in Perception; they can be swapped to Glow Sites or something else, as desired
---
Eph, the Nerd in me really appreciates how thoroughly you approached this labor of live. 
---
Thanks for sharing this!
---
It's not only Kotaku and not only about this game/games in general.  Most "news" outlets prioritize negative information over positive information, as a way of appealing to the ever growing rage culture and a way of pushing their own opinions on subjects.
---
Yeah I know... till now it got fixed for me by renaming my cam but crafting a new one once in a while is really annoying
---
"Our Olli" 😭😭😭
---
I played it for a while the last time the servers were down. I miss my 31,000 waters and 600,000 caps.... I don’t miss only jumping 3 feet in the air and the  time slowing vats seems like cheating......
---
If you're on xbox and don't mind the 20 or so dollars for an incomplete game, it's a refreshing experience from the norm👍🏼 I haven't played it in a few months, but it was fun and I'm sure they've worked on it some more!
---
I miss nearly naked piper. that's something that could be improved in 76 all the women are running around fully clothed. ugh. the only slutty female toons always end up being dudes all the actual girls I have met have been very well dressed and actually geared to the teeth in armor. realistic yes but there's nothing cooler than a girl in leather armor weilding a baseball bat kicking the crap out of super muties.
---
Still no replacement or word on replacement. If Todd really thinks I'll enjoy coming back then he can make right by his promise sooner than later...
---
You want a real mindfuck, try playing Fallout 3. I tried to ride the nostalgia train earlier today, and wierd doesn't even start to explain it.
---
Would you be willing to do a deal if I buy a few?
---
I second this, I used to get 999 shots out of one fusion core for the Gatling Laser.
---
Bear Arms, im down to like 6-9 units of weight for a heavy weapon modded, it's so friggen worth it especially when you have multiple.
---
I carry a Flamer, cryolator, .50 cal, and gatling gun comfortably with lots of ammo.

depending on your level, and grade of preparation, you can patrol/farm dif. areas to level up in a solid way, in the process, you will get more tan enough resources (weapons of victims, mostly) to sell to vendors.
---
Yeah the caps and health are certainly missed but I think there's something about the thrill of being on the edge of near death with no stimpacks and a handful of caps that feels so much more grounded and realistic.
---
You'd have to be carrying in the 10k+ range of each of these ammo to see a change in your total weight. I'm not saying that you're lying, but I don't believe anything you say. Besides it's not like the total carry weight isn't buggy. That shit is always telling me I am or am not overweight when I'm really the opposite of what it says.
---
Always carry berry mentats. Always.
---
Yeah, it's pretty short. I had trouble hitting the scorchbeast queen when she landed. It's a little bit better than melee range
---
What Item?
---
Yes but no team, so I'd have to build a diving board at my camp. but yes - that would have been easier!
---
In my vending machine. GT jshuish7
---
And remember. You can get backpacks now which help tons with carry weight.
---
The servers wouldn't be able to handle it without halving the amount of people on a server. Not saying I don't like the idea but I just don't see the servers coping
---
He apparently addressed this in the video with saying there was no dialog with people with their single player games so they didn't know about a lot of issues, which is weird because Fallout 76 has the same reddit/forums that those games did to report on it. There also is always an unofficial patch, which Fallout 4 definitely had and they could have checked what bugs that was fixing when working on Fallout 76.
---
Right on man. I'll be on around 630pm pst
---
Make pistols dual yield or give the 10mm SMG a supressor and 10mm ammo will go like hot cakes.  .44 ammo is also a no go ... 
---
But, yeah, vending has made me far more aware of how most others play the game.  They are more than happy to grind out middle of the road armor for themselves .... no desire to buy.  Weapons, they are far more willing to give anything decent a try, if the price is decent.  Grinding Aluminum, Fibreglass, Lead, and Screws .... no one wants to do that, and players will buy if the price is good (40 units for under 200 caps, and its a go).
---
Top end players (lv 250 and up) ... well they want ammo, and lots of it.
---
Would you mind giving me some details on your build and weapon? I'm interested in trying out a bloodied shotgun build
---
So which one do you thinks legendary?
---
This worked! Thanks!
---
Whitespring has netted me 10-12 legendary items per run
---
Thanks!
---
I have 20k-30k-ish bullets total, probably more actually. Not 10k of each. Buggy maybe but it shows the same change when I take them off and I’m not over encumbered. If I put one armor on it goes down if I put a second it does down more. If I attempt to put a third the weight makes no change. Same with FDC weight armor. Weapon I don’t know because I only have one of those armor pieces. Maybe it’s the lazer/plasma/fusion that’s dropping the weight I never looked or cared enough, my weight does down.
---
Seems no one is going there so more legendary items are popping up
---
The one on the left
---
the fallout world has a unique vibe. its retro and futuristic. It is the same old apocalypse done by so many its traditional but at the same time it's entirely unique. I am a huge fan but at the same time I cannot quantify why I like it so much but it isn't for everyone. I would recommend playing through the whole story and at least hitting 50 before hanging it up. perhaps you just havent gotten that vibe just yet that makes myself and peeps like me like it so much. I think if you do a full playthrough and don't want to keep playing you just aren't going to ever get into the game at that point. My brother loves Harleys, I love Ninjas, neither of us can really get into the others bike. his is nice etc but its not my ninja just like for him my ninja is not his harley. level 5 is to erly to tell just stick with it for now and by level 50 you will know
---
TNT Dome Key 7. I can get all the way to the keypad, and then there’s an invisible wall in the secret room. I tried everything they suggested, and then that was it.
---
yea pretty much what i was told about my the tadpole mission messing up on me and now I can't get the backpack
---
I have a route I take from the Cranberry Bog all the way to the top part of the map with red rocket.  This way I hit up certain spots (and do events).  I never really keep track of how many legendaries, but I have enough for three machine turn ins right now after a few hours.
---
Mine is a Key for the TNT dome stuck behind an invisible wall.
---
I found a couple spots that spawn preserved pie ... without having to grind.  Just got to be patient to get to places no one generally thinks to go.
---
oh wow is that all you can at least have someone give you the plan my game is trully jacked
---

BSG should never have tried PVP with this Fallout engine/system.  Trying to make a twitch shooter out of FO76 is just stupid.  BSG should Just make Adventure mode a  PVP-free server for co-op experience and Survival mode pure Rust stupidity to satisfy all the PVP people.  Let the PVP'ers murder, steal, grief, and torment each other endlessly without rules or restrictions.  Make it a one way street too. No coming back if you suck at PVP, you have to learn to get better at it, not come back to Adventure to grief workshops.  Once official PVP comes out they had better lock characters to one mode and that's that.  No duped OP gear in Survival -- you start at level 1 and earn what you keep.
---
1k or so
---
You still looking for people?
---
yes but in your case someone can just give you the paint plans so not a huge loss
---
Yep just message me on xbox
---
that has always been the case for me too, and some dont show on my radar until they are attacking me.  Frustrating. I probably look like a crazy person, compulsively spinning around at every sound I hear in game.
---
I've noticed that too. Low levels but it's at least something.
---
I play on PS4 too but I've had all sorts of interactions, I've been lucky that I haven't been griefed though. 
---
I had someone try out his new power fist on me, fortunately he was talking about it on an open Mic doing 600 damage, so I knew not to retaliate. Even with just slap damage he was taking good chunks out my health. Nothing a stimpacs couldn't cure. I did have to repair my armor afterwards. 
---
I had 2 level 7's shoot at me constantly. I scared one off with a missile launcher and then took the other out. 
---
I had one shooting at a friend and I do we took him on. This was early on so no one was lurking in the bushes waiting for us to attack. 
---
My friend had a squeaker that kept hitting them, asking for nuke codes. 
---
I avoid team invites like a plague. 
---
I only ever joined one random team, that was after I watched him on the map die over and over. I figured it was a safe bet he was over his head, which he was. It ended up being my first sheepsquatch as well.
---
This point of view is exactly what people like OP can’t understand. Not every one is min maxing a build to take down SBQs all day. Some people just like exploring, looting, and stockpiling that loot to keep forever. It doesn’t matter what you see value in holding in YOUR stash, it matters what the game tells you has value either through trade value, crafting/repair usefulness, and rarity. Fallout has always been a game about surviving and more or less rebuilding civilization after a nuclear attack. If my life depended on what I had on hand or could scavenge from around my area, I would never sell or throw anything away. Yet in this game Bethesda wants to pretend like it would be normal to have a certain amount of supplies. 
---
In a post apocalyptic world, would you really only carry or store enough food, water, and medicine as the game says you should. Bethesda has practically given up the RPG aspects of the Fallout franchise, but still puts a heavy influence on resource gathering and storage. Maybe the solution isn’t an extra 200 lbs of storage, but Bethesda needs to decide how they want to market their games. Either a RPG with survival mechanics, or an open world exploration games set in a RPG inspired world.
---
True, I was lucky enough to be able to walk right in and grab it the first time it was live. For some reason it wasn’t instanced. Still sucks, I can’t ever open that door myself. But I feel for you, I hope they patch it soon.
---
It's a shame the reviewer doesn't seem like somebody who has played enough of the game to understand why Todd is optimistic about 76's future. As somebody who plays every day, I know why I keep coming back. The game as it was at launch isn't what it is today and it seems unfortunate to belabour the point
---
OP’s problem wasn’t fighting back it was being hoodwinked by the low level player. 
---
OP enjoys helping out new players but a pretty common griefing ploy is for one player to join a party with the target then wait for the other player and attack the player outside the party. Because OP was partied with the low-level, when they hit the griefer(their partner) back, it flagged OP as in combat which meant the Griefer could attack them at full damage as well as destroy Op’s Base.
---
It’s very unfortunate for OP but it’s a large reason of why most people don’t accept random invites.
---
alright im keeping it then
---
Yeah, perception in this game ain’t the same
---
I'm still a low level, but built a nice  little camp for myself...last week 3 players ran into my house where I was standing. One had on PA and stood by me while the other 2 ran crazy through my house, jumping on and off my bed and tables, chairs, etc., bouncing off the walls basically. It was all so fast I didn't even notice what level they were. I gave them all the "confused" emoji but they wouldn't leave. I finally just signed out. Not funny to me, I felt like they were harassing me--they'd run in and out of my house a couple times before the last time. When you're all by yourself this stuff isn't fun.
---
ty but i'm not holding my breath it's a messed up bug for sure
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
As a general rule, I try to always start quests like this with a few tesla sprays before I go full on heavy gunner. Another good quest this is useful for is uranium fever. Just be absolutely sure you stay in pacifist mode though!
---
yup running away from the fight. :)
---
Every time I think I’m getting random damage I’ve stepped on a trap.
---
I’ve only seen one outside of flatwoods. You should get a badge for finding one to cook up.
---
crap that's too cheap there's a lot of hard to get mats that go into that at least pay the man 500 per serum.
---
Pretty sure that happened while afk in my camp today. Found a nice paper bag of loot at 5% heath when I came back.
---
We ended up calling it the “toe-stub-theory”
---
Ye exactly how I value mine 1k per good star
---
Wtf there is 200 levels in this game
---
Do you have a custom fallout.ini?
---
It is.  I almost bought one at 15K .... it IS hilarious that these things are in the game, and that you can get even better varieties like faster fire rate, limb damage, VATs enhanced, weight reduced, aiming bonus ..... for a weapon that does ZERO damage (or even heals what it is shooting at) ..... less useful than the drill I got from a lv 91 \*\*\* Deathclaw that I am selling for 9999 caps.
---
When I'm in PvP healing factor is vital. I can get hit and move away and I will heal. Even with weapon drawn. It's bugged I'm sure but that's how it works for me. In PvE it works as described
---
Similar thing happened to me. I had a single set of stairs and a single piece of foundation they led to, which was set into a hillside so you could literally walk down onto it from above. Couldn't remove the stairs, couldn't remove the foundation. Each apparently depended on the other. Had to pick up and move to get rid of them.
---
It's important to leave gifts for people. A bag of spoiled fruit or meat, raw fertilizer or .38 ammo are all popular ways to say "Nice house" or "thanks for the use of your crafting benches".
---
Yep, even PER 15 it's still really short range.  VATS works better.
---
Bout to get blocked. Don’t bother typing anything. No one will see. Dummy
---
The PA needs much more DEF... new mods could be added.  We have unarmed mods yet we can't wield unarmed weapons so it defeats the purpose.  Maybe legendary PA mods might help, hope they add them soon.
---
Outsmarted
---
Yes level 14-22 with 42-62 peppered in
---
I’m not sure about carry weight comparison but with my (non-PA) build I’m sitting around 560 DR most of the time with around 280-300 carry weight before strong back depending on what perks I throw on. If you run metal (ideally heavy metal) armor as well as perks like ironclad, evasive and barbarian you’ll always have a very high DR. 
---
If you’re already maxing strength for melee you’ll likely be able to make full use of the Barbarian perk which can grant up to 80 DR depending on how many points of strength you have at a given time. You can also grind for the armor plated backpack which gives 95 DR by itself. 
---
When you factor in legendary effects like bolstering or unyielding it’s really easy to have a very beefy DR outside of power armor.
---

Good missile video.

Love the idea.

LegacyKillaHD isn't far behind. Trash for clicks.
---
500 is MADNESS.
---
African European? What a weird way to say black
---
Hahahaha welcome to survival! Keep trying, every death is a lesson.
---
Yea that’s why I’m over going there. Just looking for somewhere else to go
---
Not just 76, but people all over the world are like this. They probably live a miserable life and the only way they can make themselves feel better about it is by griefing other people and trying to make them miserable. 
---
I turned on GTA online last night for the first time in a year and I got griefed by 3 players using god mode hacks. I don’t waste the time or energy worrying about them, that’s exactly what they want you to do.
---
Yeah, the weapon effect doesn't stack with multiple players. The perk does, but only to the same maximum as from a single player (-40%).
---
48
---
I see them on here for 250 caps daily.  Make a post in r/Market76 and you’ll get people wanting to sell to you within 10 minutes.
---
I would rather use all the dps cards and the bullet shield card (60 damage res while shooting heavy weapon at rank 3)
---
I do love bear arms though.
---
Up to 2k.
---
You’re not getting enough sleep, you don’t know what you’re saying
---
No I think I’ll stop trying actually because I’ve done more than enough. I’ve played the game for too many hours and learned all my lessons. The final lesson I learned was how to get over the fact that it will most likely never change. Much like an abusive relationship.
---
I see.
---
Nah ... 
---
If I go to your CAMP looking for armor and all you have is outfits, I look to see that you are selling highly desired items, or if your prices are good.
---
The easy go around is, in order to rate a CAMP, you have to buy something.  If no one buys anything .... NO rating.  If no one rates a CAMP, its rating is ZERO.
---
I'll be in the game in 2 hours .. Serum in the vending machine
---
Man I really misspelled opinion. That’s not a good look.
---
The insta kill or be insta killed mentality is what makes it fun for me. I always have to watch my back and keep my guard up. There are ways to prevent being insta killed tho (born survivor and serendipity or good armor). Collecting good weapons and armor to make yourself an insta killing tank is part of the game and is fun for some people (including me) to try and collect good gear and then test it in those circumstances.
---
How do you change the autosave time? Is there a YouTube video?
---
Also tried dropping the magazine. Tried putting it in my stash. That didnt work. Is anyone else having issues 2ith Unstopples 1?
---
Berkeley springs had a 3* legendary super mutant level 62 and 13 or so level 62 super mutants. But only one legendary drop tonight.
---
Yeah I'm familiar with it as I own Fallout 3, NV, and 4. I decided to take a trip near where a nuke was going off and then teamed up with a random guy where some dragon thing killed us. It's a fun game, I just need people to play with
---
Played survival once. Killed a lvl 133 with a hatchet in 4-5 hits at lvl 4. They was aiming down a sniper scope so it wasnt bad ass or nothing. I think thats bs. That should of just tickled that other player. What i like the most about your post though, is that youre not salty about losing. You just want it fair for everyone. Im curious as to what you think, in your opinion, could fix this.
---
this is on xbox
---
One static spawns at a place near Twin Lakes, NW of Huntersville
---
ahhh, that sucks
---
I’ll buy it, what’s the price?
---
Brotherhood recon instead of hunting rifle due to it requiring less scrap to make
---
yep  i have 1300 hours now on this character he is lvl 367 and no backpack for me
---
What type of armor for your build?
---
If you have some stealth/sneak ability to stay undetected (hidden or caution) Ninja perk maxed gives 3x melee damage. Add that to the gladiator/slugger and incisor. With an instigating melee weapon, you can 1 or 2 shot almost anything PvE.
---
I have a 1 star instigating revolutionary sword and a serrated combat knife (level 50). I can sneak on anything and 1 or 2 shot it. 4-5 level 68 super mutants....take them all out. Whitespring golf club, no problem.
---
Stealth is the key. The noise that the mobs make when they die is more likely to cause detection. Just back off a few steps after a kill, and resume.
---
ah. I compare 76 to 4 after I've done all the storyline and just wander around the wasteland building settlements and stuff. instead of settlements and supply lines its farming, events and checking out other peoples shops for me now, also i move and rebuild my base alot but I keep coming back to the same spot near monongah, and I take workshops and build them up when I am feeling "buildy"  . over 1000 hours and still enjoy logging in and seeing whats up in appalachia.
---
I’ve been doing the Flooded Train Yard down by Watoga lately and I’ve been getting 2-3 3* legendaries there each time.
---
My mutations kill the spawns as soon as they attack me.
---
How do you actually go about repeating the Burrows? Tried multiple times.
---
I think combat needs to be slowed down in pvp substantially. Nobody can sprint away and get behind something, pull out a frag, pop meds real quick, collect themselves for a firefight. Almost all fallout elements are removed when a fight begins. What you’re holding in your hands is what you will die with. The drugs in your system are the last you will take. There is no time to do a single thing other than aim down your sight and try not to die first. I respect that gameplay for a game that deserves it but this is fallout. It is clunky, glitchy, and non-responsive at times. That gameplay doesn’t belong in this game.
---
I bought one for 2k before, worth it honestly that gun got me through so long
---
Platform?
---
I tried playing Fallout 4 for the nostalgia but it kept crashing to desktop so I just said screw it, if I’m gonna crash to desktop, I might as well be doing it on Fo76
---
hmm interesting thought - however I think even if you could it would be easier to take the shops with junk extractors and just farm those.
---
Gezz Reminds me of Eve Online
---
Currently I am at 345 in the PA
---
I applaud you sir(ma'am?), but not everyone is such a standup person. 
---
I've seen several hate posts on here from people saying if they see armor listed and fast travel to your camp only to find it's just outfits, they will intentionally spawn enemies and herd them to your camp to be destroyed.
---
This is just one example of how childish and immature some of our players are. If this rating system is not fully thought out, it will turn into one more broken system that scumbags like that can take advantage of.
---
Thanks man! A pleasure doing business with you!
---
Speed baby , speed....40% faster swing speed
---
Can you stack Suppressor with Enforcer
---
I got 2 lvl 100 grafton monsters in both the biomes we where in, I run with a large group tho so we had almost all maxed
---
But the extractors don’t give all junk right?  At least the ones I’ve ever taken never give circuits for example
---
Really!! Just going there randomly or when doing the Distance Thunder or whatever it’s called event?
---
🤫🤐
---
Yea you can still be attacked in pacifist but unless you strike back it takes forever for them to kill you unless they are like super strong.
---
I don’t even wear my PA anymore unless I’m in a nuke zone. I get way more benefit wearing unyielding 🤷‍♂️
---
Psn- sorry though I added that
---
Yea haven’t been there much since the Burrows let down don’t need the vendor there anymore
---
Any train station should have the poster for you to read and trigger the quest.
---
Not every vault. It was supposed to be standard equipment however when vault tec was changed from making vaults to save humanity to using the vaults to experiment, they weren't given to every vault.
---
I honestly cant say for sure. I never have circuitry issues and a lot of my junk comes from ....something gorge - it has 3 junk collectors so when i run low on something i just go  fire that place up. 
---
for circuits you want watoga and silos I would imagine.
---
Just whenever! I’ve found Mirelurk Kings (Which dropped two legendaries each), Charred Ghouls, and Super Mutants. All 3*
---
Afaik, there are only two random spawns for it, one being the abandoned bog town and another somewhere else. One spawns in a lake in the mountains NE of silo charlie, and supposedly one spawns in some part of the ash heap if you nuke it
---
I did this a couple of weeks ago when my net was down and it was a real trip. I had completely forgotten about selling ammo for caps. I love Fallout 4 still, but wow am I used to 76 now.
---
'... and cannot do anything that the AI's can't do(Sprint/Sneak/Vats/Prolly don't even need a pipboy). "

Dibs on being the earth hugging sliding ghoul with stealth that appears behind you!
---
Same problem I thought they made made camp building easier...
---
If you want a balanced build that will let you shift between play styles, consider 9 strength, 9 perception, 8 Endurance, 4 charisma, 6 intelligence, 9 agility, 11 luck.    This is “jack of all trades, master of none.”  But you can make competent melee, rifle, heavy weapons, power armor builds out of it.
---
Side Quests related to sheepsquatch/missing people give mounted; Yao gui, wolf, wendigo, ragstag

---
Saw one in survival near watoga. Nope nope nope. Bunch of ppl near by fighting it out in the city and i snuck away. Backing up to see if i was being followed.... Turned a round a big boy was coming right me!
---
Thank you! I hate these scam artists trying to manipulate the economy for a quick win. The old system was broken and full of scammers selling duped items to get so rich when anything good comes out they can just buy it out.  I agree with a small cap increase to maybe 30k, but not until raids are out at the very earliest.
---
I had a very similar experience....great day in the bog
---
If you want to stay out of the forest and still attract low levels, put your camp somewhere near WS train station. People will be willing to spend the caps to travel there because they can unlock one of the most important FT spots in the game at the same time.
---

---
Pumpkin?
---
That would be cool. I was just thinking earlier this game needs more keybind/hotkey options. That seems like it would fix a lot of what youve mentioned. Though that leaves console players at a loss and doesnt help them. So maybe not.
---
xbox? I'll give you 1.2k for it.
---
Screenshot or it didn't happen. :P
---
Just kidding... I've had ones similar to that... Even sat back and rested for a bit while the Sheepsquatch took over as my tag-team buddy with the SBs.
---
Jealous on your find.  I looked for a BFFR RE plasma and never could find one.
---
Clear the cache, fixed my issue....which was the same
---
Its ok if you dont get it  Your hints of anger make me believe it's a bit more than a game for you.
---
I've tried going back to 3, but on console it's difficult. You have to press a button to "open" every random crate or corpse, and then press more buttons to take the stuff out of them. The system in recent games where you just hover over it and see/take the contents is hard to lose.
---
Thank you kindly for that information! It is incredibly helpful!   
---
Towards the end of the day my thought process was thinking the Anti Armor might be the best and that answer certainly solidifies it. I got my hands on two Anti Armor handmades so I'm in shape!
---
Agreed. 300 is the most common price I’ve seen and that’s acceptable.
---
Still play it quite often to get my build fixes in. I just love settlement building.
---
Why are people downvoting this?
---
Yeah, well consoles aren't designed to run modern games. Seriously. But Bethesda should've designed their game on consoles to have worse graphics and stuff so there would be less performance issues.
---
Block him?  For giving you the answer to the problem?  Damn, won't get far in life with that attitude.
---
This is literally the only game I have these issues with. Every single other modern game works great most of the time. This is just Bethesda Austin be OK ngrats trash.
---
The dailies are random loot drop after your a possum. Camp tails the same way.
---
As someone who loves to 100 percent trophies just the thought of it never popping makes me a bit anxious. I hope it'll fix itself somehow. That's one thing about my second character that I play for a release he has a full build and level guide I made before I started playing him. I'm now starting to rework my main and get points where they should be.
---
Neither. Bloodies melee
---
I was going to do something smaller.  I grew up in the country where farmers would have little stands of goods with a coin box.  It was on the honor system.
---
I was going try something similar, but stand there.  Drop a few bags of goods, wait, and small talk the passers by.  Sure I could request a trade, bit that whole mechanic is so unwieldy....
---
I like it. At least we have each other!
---
Just relog to another world and move it 5 feet. 40 caps later it's all reset
---
It seems like they happen more often now. I had only experienced one and today I got 2 within ten minutes of each other on the same server
---
I'm level 112 and only seen one, that was yesterday.
---
Thank you! Finally able to fix my SPECIAL allocation after all the misplaced points early on. I'm so happy to be able to fix and tweak my build now.

1* handmades and levers easily sell for 2k.
---
Funny enough, when you look at the numbers in terms of defense for energy and ballistic it turns out T-51b is the best armor there is, but it just lacks points in rad resistance. So While I'd been struggling for so long to find good mods and plans for my Ultracite I could of been rocking T-51b with jet packs or reactive armor for so long... I scrapped my ultracite a while ago, and I'm not looking back unless they really boost the shit out of it, and make plans for it that make it enjoyable and not crazy expensive to find on the market.
---
Thank you, friend!
---
I know that but I don't like that I have to blow 40 caps just for that. 40 isn't a lot, but it's still just spending caps on something that can be done for free, just with extra time and effort.
---
I have 173 plans at my camp......most are half the value process if not lower.   
---
Backpack mods you must earn doing the possum badges and can't be bought.

"Hey Bethesda, why don't you do the obvious thing everyone's asking for and was present in your previous offline game of the same design?"
---
The answer would be server limits, you hoarders (joking there... kinda).
---
Can you imagine the sort of shit people used to keep in their fo4 stash, 26 times per server (even before we get into multiple individual boxes)? Holy shit, it's be a mess. It's just not going to happen, mate, not without a complete retool of the inventory system to severly limit how much can get into each box, and I doubt they're going to do that.
---
Nope same old bugs same old problems.
---
Nothing selected fix exit build menu and re enter.
---

Glad it isn’t just me!
---
nah same.  after while i got like 3 in a row.  RNG
---
Yes, I heard that too, 25% was the chance, I think. But I was concerned, as the camp counselor at kiddie corner cabbins called me "the oldest tadpole he has seen", although I was already pronounced possum and I have my backpack for quite some time. I am confused...
---
Mishmash of either combat armor or marine armor. I tend to like the marine if I'm going up against ghouls, much better rad resist. Combat for most other stuff. 
---
The combat is 
---
Chest: Vanguards/Agi
---
L Arm: Life Saving/Rad Resist
---
L Leg: Life Saving/Poison Resist
---
R Arm: Chameleon/Rad Resist
---
R Leg: Exterminator's/Refresh.
---
It's not gear I've hunted for specifically, this is my 3rd character. This is just whatever random heavy combat armor I had in storage that had appropriate effects.
---
I don't need stealth. I have an instigating power fist that will oneshot anything shy of big beasts like behemoths or scorchbeasts. I have a junkie's swing speed power fist that will make short work of the rest (junkies build). And I can wade though a mountain of supermutants without worry. I just charge in and start swinging. 
---
20 str, 20 stamina which nets me 355hp, 412 damage on my power fist, double that for instigating, and I'm basically ignoring all armor between Incisor, Puncturing mod on the power fist, and that 800 damage first hit "breaking" whatever armor is left. And that's without Adrenaline stacked up. 450 DR, 25 PR, 547 ER, 55 RR. If I was able to upgrade all that to actually optimized armor, like Cavalier's on all of it, with more Vanguard or enemy-specific pieces for that sweet % damage reduction.... I can't even imagine how tough I'd be.
---
1* bloodied levers and handmades easily sell for 2k.   And are worth it.  My main has pretty much everything.  My alts use mostly 1* bloodied.   And the 1* bloodied is as nearly effective as a BE or BFFR.
---
Okay, this gives me hope. I will repeat the event and give you guys an update if I get lucky :)

Here's what I observed the last few times I've tried it and made a point to pay attention. I *think* that the cooldown timer is 3 in-game hrs starting from 7:00 PM. I hopped servers to find it 20 x today and if the time was let's say approaching 7:15ish the event would start. 
---
I spawned into the area at 6 PM in game time and waited. It then triggered. 
---
A number of times I got there after 7:30 and it didn't trigger with me waiting until 10:00 - 10:30.
---
Some servers popped several legendaries (I stop the music between wendigo howls - see my recent post about this) and some spawned no other legendaries but a steady stream of crowned level 62 ghouls.  
---
I let the event run out to its end with 3 mins or so remaining to maximize my trip there.
---
If I get there before 7:30 PM I kill everything in the surround so they don't mob me when the event triggers.
---
I have no proof of any of this, just observation, but try it. 
---
Every time I hopped the event spawned within the parameters of what I stated above. I don't know if the event will spawn at 1:30 AM because I didn't try it.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Make is so you spawn into a 3 star legendary...  then you can try and run and hide lol.
---
Thanks for the business. Hope my death claw friend didn't give you too much trouble!
---
Ok I can definitely see where you’re coming from there. I was extremely disappointed when I saw they had added Razorgrain flour only to have it be wasted on the Fasnacht Donut, which for whatever reason requires a number of ingredients but gives no real benefit.
---
Yeah, something like that. I'm a huge proponint on things that promote a sense of community in fo76.
---
You probably know more than I do. I don't care about being right in such a matter, so thank you for clarifying. I don't straight accept what you say as truth, but it does make me aware that I'm ignorant in this matters.
---
Gunslinger/vats/crit
---
I guess you gotta treat it like a flame thrower a bit lol, I'll have to mess around with them I suppose.
---
It was the most amazing thing to see. I was crouched in a cabin going over my inventory or something and I heard the clank-clank-clank of power armor chugging down the road. I watched through the window (totally not a creeper btw) and they just casually strolled right on by singing to the Pip-Boy. Loved it.
---
I’ve always rocked the X-01. I got the jet pack for it first and never switched back. When I got the ultracite, since I couldn’t find the mods I just never bothered.
---
Understandable, on my heavy build I went with max carry weight, because I've got bear arms, bandolier, traveling pharmacy, batteries included, and thru-hiker so I've got a shit ton of stims, food, and cores so that I never really run out. and I think I deal some decent damage to solo everything.
---
Yea I got 3 possum badges within as many days now not even one in two weeks since
---
How are the in comparison to like rifle builds? That's what I have on PC?
---
I can relate. Was trying to make me some ribeye steak and some jerk cake up and poked me in the balls with his Wolverine gauntlet and proceeded to claim both the 5 cap bounty on my head and all the jumbo I had on me
---
Of course! I’m still at it, nearing a thousand data points. Will report in occasionally with updates.
---
Bros do you guys remember that sega genesis game Awesome Possum?
---
Sometimes not even 10 ft. Ill be around a corner and they enemy is firing an automatic and no dot lol
---
I was so stoked when I got my hands on her, I had been looking for about 5-6 days straight with market posts, had to trade a 2:1 EE LMG and JE railway rifle
---
for being a pain in the ass to maintain and find plans for it's really not worth it, and that fact makes me sad because it was supposed to be like top tier end game shit. nah, you could of just stuck with t-51b the entire time when you're able to find it.
---
The caps also caps out (hehe) at 50 so if killing a level 300 will net you the same amount of caps as killing a level 200
---
I've never carried a shovel, and I've collected dozens of treasures.
---
You might need it for a quest, but not for Treasure Maps.
---
Both valuable items.  But a BFFR RW plasma may literally be one of a kind.
---
"Accidentally. " With vault-tec, accidents are suspect
---
Melee ,😴
---
oh i didnt know they were old problems, probably because i havent moved my camp in a while.
---
w0t
---
The only thing I hate about going back to NV and 4 is the Pip-Boy. I’m so used to using WASD to go through the tabs that it throws me off in Vegas, and in both games I end up pausing them when I’m just trying to get the map open.
---
Seriously need some fast travel mats in our lifes, Good or bad.
---
Get a clan system running, have a clan-wide morality system with different clan-wide rewards as you progress in the morality system (good morality = armor, stimpacks etc, bad morality = weapons, ammo, grenades etc) and the option to set official clan outfit (and for the members to choose if they want to use it), also have the option for a good morality clan to be able to declare war on a bad morality clan (both leaders having to agree on the war) which would unlock pvp for members of both clans.
---
Then people can make raider clans, 'new responders', 'new firebreathers' etc.
---
That would only make a noticeable difference (having one or two clans per session maybe) if they increased the player cap, though.
---
I’m sorry, little one
---
It's true they're all characters. I love the unpredictability of it all. Much better than NPCs.
---
I forget I'm wearing the collar. I put it on a long time ago trying to farm the Falsely Accused quest after reading it helps the prison marshals spawn. Forgot I had it on. After I discovered I'd been wearing it I decided it was something with my backstory, but totally didn't think about the kink. At least it makes things interesting.
---
mind you i kept server hopping a few hours one night and managed the 5 i needed for armour plating in one sitting.  just stay persistent.
---
What monster weapon did you use for this great feat?
---
These are the exact things the entire community has been asking for to make the game better
---
RP is something I've thought about but never really put any effort in. I'd be happy to check out the discord though it might turn into a new hobby for me. Thanks for the info!
---
Yep I’ve seen higher with full mods. Those are among the most lethal weapons in the game.
---
It’s designed for a coordinated group, so only those people who have a group they regularly play with can do it right.
---
Horrible game design continues.
---
Ikr, what’s the point of playing to the end BOS events to get the plans and get an armor that is completely lack lustre. Then PvP in it and get one shot by a person wearing some 1* sentinel armor.
---
Not a prob. But they have been around a while.
---
if your crit meter is full you hold your crit button and it fires a 100% accurate crit shot that deals more damage then normal. still drains AP per shot.
---
you fill your crit meter by dealing damage/hitting targets in VATS.
---
I know this is completely irrelevant, but fun little exploit in survival mode: If your teammate has a bounty on their heads, you can kill them and split the bounty with them 50/50. So if they had a 100 cap bounty on their head, they’d get 50 caps when you kill them.
---
Well that’s obnoxious. For what it’s worth, this is really the first time that I’d run into people behaving that way. I’ve had really good run-ins (for the most part) until this weekend.
---
Yep! superpeon81 on BethNet.
---
Hey just kidding I run either hvy/pa or bloody shotgun. As my main.
---
My alts are bezerker, and sneak melee
---
Ironically I'm the opposite in a sense, I constantly press m expecting a pip-boy map only to see the travel one and it always throws me off!
---
Well, I say that loosely because I seem to recall someone saying that the GECK was actually damaged in an attack by Raiders - i.e. a total accident - but I couldn't verify that on the wiki.
---
Definitely this. My friends and I *tried* using the in-game voice, but we ended up just using Discord like everything else. And now V is bound to push to talk in area.
---
I'm on psn. Sell mine for 250 each.
---
That's just his programmed recording. It says it to me also and I've collected like 20+ possum badges and completed more than half of the possum challenges. Sometimes you'll find a lull in tokens from events other times you'll get multiple times in a row
---
Well it’s really the only way it can be done. I just had to do that recently as I had a concrete piece in my way as I was redoing my camp. I blueprinted a small part of what I started and wanted to keep. And then I didn’t have enough caps to move it. lol. I just did some quest came back, moved my camp a few feet. Put down my small CAMP I started and all was well again.
---
I only play adventure lol never tried survival yet.
---
It'll be Vault 22, take two. 😋
---
Dude, this engine is horrid, so nobody really gets good play and decent graphics like they should without a beast system.
---
That said, you can do a couple things.
---
1. Go to a mod forum and get reshade plus an optimized ini for it.
---
2. Put every single slider except the first three to the absolute lowest settings- these alone will kill you if you have them up any at all.
---
3.  Make sure resolution in game matches monitor resolution.
---
4. Try both fullscreen and fullscreen with border.  One will be shit, one will work. No telling which.
---
5. Live with whatever you end up with at this point, because these steps are the best you can do.
---
Imagine, using the reset camp option also costs 40 caps.
---
Same here, went to help some 200ish dude defend his workshop from bloodbugs, halfway through he runs up to me and starts stabbing me with his mole gauntlet. I didn’t think anything of it until I went to club a blood but in vats and I somehow miss the blood bug and hit him. He obliterates me, takes my shit, and then keeps attacking me with his level 150ish friend. Ended up reporting both of them for harassment because I didn’t know what else to do, and I think it might have worked, because about 15 minutes after I sent the report both of them left the world.
---
Vendor sells it for like 200 caps
---
From one of the Enclave vendors.
---
Definitely could have been me. Ive dont that more than I could count. Either that or its a huge coincidence that there are multiple T-60 Karaoke wanderers.
---
A bunch of people were talking to me about my vendor setup and some jerk started attacking everyone to try and get us to trade and then pvp
---
I've tried to find as many as I can with just the map, but in some cases, the map is completely wrong in terms of directions (the one overlooking Poseidon, for example).  And anything in the Savage Divide, I just forget it.  It's so samey and annoying to explore that region that nothing really stands out.
---
Same with a couple of the Cranberry Bog maps.  A wooden bridge in the middle of a swamp?  Oh yeah, that clears it up! 😋
---
Only until you miss once or swap targets, so yeah...for like five seconds.
---
$1,400 caps per day from the vendors = 18 days to reach the 25,000 cap max. It's not too hard.
---
+1 bogtown.  Only place in game I’ve seen both
---
No, even if you craft and use it all, scrapping that stuff only gives paltry returns.  Turrets only give steel, for example.
---
No, it got worse.
---
Not to mention the durability cost of explosive weapons.  Since I'm predominantly melee, Makeshift Warrior is my durability perk of choice, so my guns take a beating without Gunsmith.  The Explosive effect makes them utterly unreliable.
---
yep, as soon as i had starched genes and class freak maxed, i picked up Marsupial, and Speed Demon. i think, these two alone make it totally worth it.
---
later I added Healing Factor and Electrically Charged. Healing Factor is so awesome, i go through so much less food and stimpaks. it only kicks in when you're not "in battle' which has been interesting to figure out, but still not bad.
---
most recently, i added Egghead. not sure how much upside i get to the INT buff, but haven't had too many negative effects.
---
i never, ever take off starched genes. i did it accidentally once while under the effects of radaway:diluted and lost one of my mutations.
---
Hope not bcuz it does it with both of my controllers and 1 is new. 
---
Its been doing it for a couple months but for not my whole play session. It does stop but I guess since I mostly play  starting at 11:30pm until 34am the possessed controller effect happens idk what
---
it's even more fun to share Strange in Numbers and have your teammates be like "holy cow, why am i jumping so much higher?" lol.
---
Sure, I was an idiot as a child, but not the "yelling racial slurs" kind of idiot.
---
Kids grow into adults; they can and should learn to behave like them, especially at that age.
---
It’s simple really, if you have only one, the capacity is 200, if you have multiple, the capacity is evenly divided. Yeah you can waste a bunch of camp budget and make 10 of them, then 20 lbs each. Then waste more resources to protect them. Few people will do that so I don’t think it’s a real issue. 
---
I’d love to have one at the entrance and leave stuff in it for visitors to take, such as food, water, ammo, etc. If I drop them in paperbags they disappear after I log out. But if I can have a box that says Welcome or Help Yourself on it, they will always be there for visitors yet won’t take up my stash space.
---
Calibrated shocks (add 50 each 100 total), backpacks (add 30 60 high capacity), excavator power armor (adds 100, 200 of calibrated). There are plenty of way to gain more carry weight without bugs and I don't struggle at all with my 170 carry weight on my scrawny rifle man character. Just manage your inventory and decide what you really need.
---
When the opposum bacon gets less awesome...
---
No, the easiest wayBY FAR is to go to the pair of little shacks just se of the bos fort you do tech turn ins to.
---
They have an irritated spa pool out back that you’ll die from radiation by sitting in - easy revive if your quick.
---
This is an awesome idea....
---
I gave the kid that got shot making opossum bacon my last bit of gold but am now regretting it.
---
Great idea bub!!
---
The high capacity backpack gives you 120 carry weight at lvl 50. The excavator power armor gives you carry weight and so do the calibrated shock mods for any power armor. There are also a slew of legendary mods and perks that reduce the weight of various types of items. In addition, there are chems and food that add strength and carry weight. Every time someone does one of those glitches, it douches up the server for everyone else. If you want a specialized build, you're going to have to sacrifice carry weight.
---
All junk, just low percent chance of high value scrap
---
A PvE focused survival mode (possibly with PvP totally disabled too) would definitely appeal to much more of the players in FO76...  Bethesda, are you listening?
---
Somewhat like Escape from Tarkov?
---
Use a backpack outside the power armor.
---
I'll try bcuz I just brought Valkyrie chronicles 4 and its suck havin to get another dual shock controller. Thanks for the info
---
Hello, I made this account just to let y'all know something I found out. If you build a fertilizer producer it spawns in a cow right? Turns out its a fresh new cow every time. Just build one producer to spawn a cow, milk it, STORE the producer and don't scrap it, build and repeat. Unlimited milk and maybe meat is now yours, I haven't tested killing the brahmin.
---
It's quirky, buggy, and really easy to fail unless everyone is on the same page.  And even then, I hope someone brought the Formula P because there's only so much you can do to protect the stupid test animals.
---
It's the only piece of Wild Appalachia content I don't run, simply because I don't enjoy it.
---
If they actually announced it for the whole server I'm sure someone would show up.
---
It makes encounters maddening.
---
First one I'd ever seen was pre-50 whitesprings in a random encounter by the entrance near the train station.  I took little shots while the robots were trying to kill it.  High level player comes in and downs it in seconds.
---
I keep getting "object needs support" errors even when I'm putting it on the fucking ground!
---
introducing a new armor modifier that gave you bonuses for _not_ being mutated, would be interesting.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Same here.  Can't catch Sludge Lung no matter how hard I try lol.
---
I've failed it the three times I've tried it. I'm good with ignoring it now.
---
I hadn’t played in like three months until the most recent patch. And building a camp is both harder and easier. Only easier because rocks and bushes go away but that’s the only thing. It’s clunkier and worse than ever. Sometimes items won’t place after placing or messing with an electronic or electrical item. It will start to work again after going in and out of CAMP building more than once but it sucks. 
---
Also pieces keep getting stuck and can’t delete. Roofs won’t place. I totally thought I had my camp maybe too high because I couldn’t put on a roof. Lowered it, couldn’t remove a concrete piece. Had to move my camp a few feet to remove it. Rebuilt it lower and the roof was placeable.  It now I’m thinking it wasn’t too high. I’m thinking it was just glitched. Cause why would I be able to build walls and no roof it it were too high? It was really only like four stories from the ground. I don’t know. I just know CAMP building is not easier as they intended. It’s buggy as hell.
---
I honestly just park myself at wavy willards and server hope till it pops.
---
i reflexively dilute ALL Rad-X as soon as i see i have some. i went to a SBQ once and they had targeted so we had to fight in a rad zone, i popped a Rad-X and suddenly i wasn't running or jumping like i had been. confused the heck out of me. never again lol.
---
I'm totally okay with both of these scenarios.
---
Thanks, good to know.
---
It can get hard once you need tog et into the mire, but I will admit easy access to whitesprings is nice
---
It’s short, but it’s also not in front of you, it’s not a cone in front of you, it’s more like a sphere 20 feet in front of you, and anything you put in there is dead.  I can’t tell if it works well with the queen, the weird hit box of the gun and the weird hit box of the queen it’s all to difficult, but anything else it’s just deadly 
---
Oh and ammo is expensive
---
Fair enough, with your clarification that it takes from a single shared/split maximum capacity. Without that clarification, it goes to a silly place.
---
Rifleman? I’d say bloodied explosive/faster fire rate handmade and railway rifles
---
Build all your turrets on TOP of something. If they vanish, store the thing they were on. Both items should appear in your camp Stored tab.
---
They are getting annoying, I don't really want to do the camera quest.  
---
I'd like challenges like scrap X amount of items, or craft X amount.  How about gather X amount of legendaries, collect X amount of material?  Photos are just too time consuming from what others have experienced to be worth it.
---
I just ran it. No players showed up. No enemies showed up. During the last minute there were suddenly 30 robots, Yao Guai, and Stingwings appearing.
---
A fog crawler spawned as the alpha, fell through the floor, and my game crashed. RIP.
---
First one no. Doesn't stack. 
---
Second yes, you get double the yield. Good with salt makes it last longer too.
---
Great job love the style and cant wait to see you do the mire with all the strangler type creatures!
---
I don't do it because it literally crashes every time I get to the end.  I have not once gotten the reward for doing it, just the hassle of all the wasted bullets.
---
Backpack adds 60, high cap adds 120 but gives debuffs, all others give 30 but add different buffs.
---
Deep Pockets on armor add 10 each.
---
Honestly I don't know, I run a bloodied fully auto rifle build and it's solid. Pistols and shotguns would be more of a fun build less of a competitive build inm y opinion
---
Perk cards do stack as long as they aren't the same rank when shared or at least this was like this on launch
---
I think bigger camps should onll
---
y be limited to decent size groups. 4+ maybe,
---
1.2 deal
---
No
---
AAE is also very viable esp considering AA adds a tiny bit of Dmg for Explosive on top of the dmg added to the weapon natively
---
As an avid fan of this game, it’s not even the best Fallout let alone the best game.
---
Nah, I think Anthem is the best game of all time. It runs almost perfectly on my computer and the content is not buggy at all
---
I mean I don't pvp it's mainly just pve shit and it's not like minmaxing does much in this game anyways
---
I hear that. I've had a pretty decent light machine gun in my shop for a week, and no bites. I thought people used those!
---
Wouldn’t say it’s the best. May be better for pvp, but it sure does way less damage
---
#DeadGame
---
That has been my go-to spot since launch.
---
There are safes in the little tower buildings, plans in the train cars, dog food everywhere, a terminal to hack, and there's generally a legendary there.
---
It's always pretty random on what you find there. Liberators, Yao Guai, Gulpers, .... Whatever.
---
I usually do Watoga Civic Center and then the flooded rail yard.
---
Add me!!
---
Q about your sneak melee set up.  What armor are you using?  My sneak success has been all over, bit recently have found the Haz Mat suit does pretty well.  Well, for a quick shootin' sniper who sometimes gets closer than he wants....
---
In one day?
---
have you finished your tadpole badges? I heard the last patch took away the ability to get possum badges if you haven't completed tadpole.
---
scrip them, don't keep them
---
There are also several perks that have a chance to fill your crit meter for every hit or per kill and another that allows you to only use half of your critical meter per critical shot.
---
I'll be on again tomorrow.  I'll add you!
---
I do but the effect on a melee weapon though
---
&gt;fo76
---
well I guess if there were any "slutty' male toons running around half naked, perhaps us gals would be inclined to.....yeah nah.  Sorry dude, I'm more interested in killing and looting and crafting and surviving to be anyone's slutty eye candy.
---
Well, I did not finish all of them, just enough to rank up and get a backpack...
---
Will add you up!
---
Good points.
---
I would just add, a fan's job is to articulate what the issues are, not how to fix them. Change the engine isn't helpful feedback. Say what you don't like about their games. They will know what is due to the engine and what isn't far better than you.
---
Don't tell professionals who know more than you how to fix the very things they made. It isn't helpful.
---
ok. you're just getting horrible RNG luck then.
---
I've done it a few times. More successes than failures, and the last one I had to chuckle, one of the 2 animals that got upgraded apparently wasn't being guarded, and ran all the way to my room fleeing a rad-ant. I was guarding my animal and my room, and I kind of took that second one under my wing- he stuck around in there for most of the rest of the waves, only ran off slightly before the alpha came in. Alpha arrived in my room too. Managed to keep my animal alive and slaughter the alpha (to be fair, it kind of bugged). I felt no remorse in killing the alpha without the other players showing up (one guy showed up right before I downed it, but there were at least 4 other players in the event) because quite clearly they were NOT protecting the animals, since I was alone in the room protecting the only two that were left alive.
---
When I wear my backpack I only get 30.
---
Using the word communism? Maybe?
---
Great troll letting him kill you a few times....
---
There are perk cards that help a lot. Gun fu allows my to switch targets after each kill. Adrenalin give additional damage after each kill. For example my first shot is 663 damage. If that kills the target each shoot after is increased. Add in a crit at the end of a 5 shot kill steak and I'm doing over 1k damage a trigger pull as long as I am killing a group quickly.
---
l.o.l. .... nope ... I've got one character, and play the game based on the 25K limit like its intended. .... 
---
Know the limit .... Stay within it.
---
If they knew they were going to receive a rough reception, maybe they shouldn't have asked full price for it, or pushed back the launch six months?
---
Just a thought.
---
Just a two shot explosive handmade, the accuracy is actually pretty good on a big target like sheepsquatch or scorchbeasts so both shots usually hit and chips them down quickly. I love that gun
---
You need to craft a lvl 50 one
---
It's a great game for sure, but the best? Nah not really.
---
Ah. Thanks I didn't know that.
---
Kinda, yeah, but as fodder you are only trying to attack players. There's no incentive to survive, or loot. You would get rewarded based on how well you preformed damaging the players. At least in how I envision it.
---
Lucky! It's the only disease I have left to get and for some reason I cannot contract it. I had a diseased spawn follow me into the building at the quarry in the bog. I let it attack me for so long I had to stim myself twice. I'm level 125 it took it forever. Never did I contract the whoopsies. I eventually had to leave the game after waiting so long. Most other diseases the baddies just look at me and I get them.
---
Nice. My main weapon is a Furious Handmade. It one and two-shots most smaller targets. I normally use an automatic against the 'Squatch though...
---
For real I would be stoked to use it if I had commando perks
---
I'll be on fallout in about 15 minutes
---
That's why you get a bloodied explosive handmade and put the AA mag on it. Best of both worlds
---
That looks like a nuke zone in back of the rad storm.
---
I want a furious one too cuz I'm pretty sure the damage will get higher quickly on a target with high hp like the queen, or scorchbeasts, etc.
---
free water and resources, cute camps, weird stuff for sale like a fully modded commie wacker, also no locked doors or at least acess to stash box and scraping station. 
---
and of course not spawning inside the foundations
---
I found that they arent very common but they arent rare either
---
Man that’s rough ,...I get 450 with 3 pieces Unyeilding , 15str, Radicool and a regular packpack
---
Sorry, not an answer, but have the same question for Ecological Balance.  I Fast Travel to The Vault, and blamo..theres that worthless quest again...

I love it, lot of meat and acid/screws to be had. I can solo if no one shows taking B. You can rack up the sludge there with all the mole rats and get a snallygaster every time. Bring a lead lined backpack. With my friend we can get 2 but only got all 3 to survive once, it was just me and him. Need a competent 3rd and put them in A. Whoever gets the alpha needs to be able to solo. Without cripple the monster will get one of the animals. The randoms I see there usually let the animal in their biome die. They figure with the other 2 I guess. But it's like that, all depends on who you get.

Formula p is still in the loot table with only 1 alive

I don’t do the PVP and only once I was just about insta killed after taking a workshop. Usually I can at least claim it and fight the first wave and get the reward before someone tries to take it from me. And I’ll let them. Cause I got what I wanted. 
---
But no, this dip-wad comes out of nowhere and does nothing to help against the many feral mongrels. Kills me with his machine gun before I realized what happened. I was like level 15 and he was like 200+. Yup I blocked that douche. Now I may call him names. But I don’t really care all that much. It just kind of tripped me out. I was like, “What just happened?” 
---
But oh well. Most I run into are super friendly or not interested in what I’m doing at all. 
---
Now I did have an interesting moment of some noob level 5 ish range trying to kill me with his pipe pistol at my camp. I had my mic on and was telling them I wasn’t into PVP. I just stood there as he kept shooting me, in my power armor mind you, and then I’m like, “Alright, you asked for it.” And killed him with like two shots of my shotgun.  It was like the my only legit PVP I’ve done. I admit, if this guy was was high level I would have either already been dead or I would have ran. I’m not into PVP at all. I don’t play other PVP games ever like COD. I don’t know why, but fighting against real people gives me anxiety. I can predict an NPC and understand how they fight. I can’t do that with real people. 
---
But on a few occasions I have run into someone that wanted to PVP and I just say I don’t want to fight and they stop, and sometimes give me gifts. 
---
I absolutely didn’t get this game for PVP and I feel bad for anyone that did and wants to play fair but just can’t with the way it’s setup. I really wish they just had a separate mode without PVP at all. It would be so much better for those of us who don’t want to be apart of it. 
---
But regardless, it’s not a big deal; the PVP. Most people are real friendly. If it wasn’t for that, the game wouldn’t be playable if everyone were just assholes on every map. The assholes are quite rare that I run into. Helps I tend to avoid dots on the map of those I’m not familiar. Besides, the game just runs so more smoothly with solo or maybe one teammate. 
---
I seriously have no reason to look over my shoulder and be scared of other players. Most like to say hi at the minimum. That’s kinda neat.
---
I saw a report recently which indicated 200% DMG after 10 hits. The Handmade for me is still under 100 DMG but yeah, 200 is nice. I get 3.5x with perks (at night time), or about 350 DMG. However you only get that stealth perk when undetected, so the gun may not get in enough shots to make the 100% increase and still stack with the 3.5x multiplier.
---
Everything I get is nocturnal 😑
---
As someone born and raised here (and that's a psychologist/drug counselor), I'm really going to have to disagree with your assessment of what our issue with the opioid epidemic is. 
---
Specifically the "it's the pits" mentality. WV isn't the pits. Pharma has a massive presence here because of our chemical plants and natural resources. Our doctors prescribe people opioids in vast quantities because it's encouraged. Our issues specifically come from the pharmaceutical presence here. When I broke my radial joint, the doctor tried prescribing me 120 Percocet 10s for a 14 day period. Needless to say, I declined. 
---
The people here are (contrary to stereotypes) pretty welcoming and neighborly on average. Most of our homeless populations and addict populations come from New York and Detroit. It's so bad, instead of arresting them, we send them back to their home state. The abandon houses and buildings in the southern part have a lot to do with mines shutting down from lack of buyers.
---
Suffice to say, don't speak on the issues of an area unless you have specific first hand experience with it. Anytime you have questions, I'm open to answering them. Have a blessed day.
---
Mines worse
---
Oh sure there’s no way people should get unlimited storage boxes, not even in the real world lol. 
---
By doing this the eye candies can have a real use. Right now they just clutter the space and no real purposes. If I have a Cola machine that I can actually leave drinks in it for visitors, it will make a huge difference. Camps will be more home-like.
---
Damn that's high
---
This idea is brilliant. I’ve gotten so many crappy guns that I just scrap immediately
---
I’d be 100% okay with this. Just...as long as the gutsy’s weren’t bullet sponges.
---
Its like the disposable players from tarkov but instead you actually get the items. Or better items.
---
This is best i found. Seems to be random glitch, to shutdown, maybe cycle connection on ps4 and try again later...

Hardly the best game of all time. It is good though... relatively.
---
It's a bar as you vats and shoot mobs. When it fills, press spacebar and fire the stored crit.
---
Sarcasm is good
---
That's not the issue.
---
BE handmade you mean?
---
almost 700, if anybody knows how to still be a productive member of society please let me know
---
I find that when I hit the limit,its just time to sell off stuff that you aren’t using. Why do I need 200 bulk glass? A lot of that un-used junk sells pretty high at robo-traders. Especially glass, rubber, and gears. Black titanium is pretty easily re-stocked by running the blackwater mine event a couple of times. Obvo never sell screws, steel, or lead. But a lot of other shit like crystal or too much wood are pretty pointless.
---
For weapons, I just evaluate “k, which guns do I actually use, which ones are dead weight. What can I sell to robo traders, and what might go for 2K+ caps on my vending machine?” 
---
“Vats enhanced reduced weight nocturnal pipe gun... scrip it. Furious explosive submachine gun...thats a sleeper hit, but I don’t feel like crafting the ammo, vending machine it!”
---
 I meant Furious Explosive
---
If you like your lever guns, then for the absolute highest damage go bloodied explosive. If you don’t want to run low health, instigating explosive is the way to go. 
---
Personally I think explosive isn’t all that great on single shot rifles, but it does add damage. 
---
If you really want to boost things without being bloodied, stock up the sneak perks.
---
Nope, dont keep any higher or lower level items in your stash/body
---
Scrap or scrip all guns you can’t use yet. Get rid of heavy ammo. Reduce the number of stimpacks of all kinds.
---
To me it’s sneak bloodied explosive lever action
---
Worth note, they are still working on the whole "display camp items" thing, it just got pushed back every time it got close. Here's hoping it hits early during the next patch season.
---
I can do that first thing tomorrow
---
Social D! Every time I go deep into a mine in the ash region I get Down Here stuck in my head. I’m sure Ness is singing about working in a mine??
---
i still want to know the budget cost of camp items.  that would help so much.
---
Why do we need to put a /s tag for sarcasm every time? It ruins the joke
---
I was really excited to get a Furious .50cal machine gun recently. Used it on the SBQ, but hard to gauge effectiveness when 8-10 others are also peppering away at it. I reckon that thing must end up twice as heavy with the lead it soaks up...
---
I have an explosive 10mm auto that I've optioned up to the max but even with perks I don't see any benefit to it compared to the furious handmade...
---
Because people only do it to farm and completely skip on the objective. Trust me, I wanna do it, but having *maybe* only one other doing the objective sucks.
---
Sorry, I can't get past the boss at the elevator.
---
But if they weren’t all identical I wouldn’t have to look at the map before typing in the code because I forgot which silo I’m in.
---
Kk!!
---
What would be the incentive to do charlie then? The end game is the same, launch a nuke.
---
I am amazed at the creative ways people get camp layouts and when I’m in an exploring mood, I’ll climb all over it, marveling at the layout and personal touches.
---
==but....
---
When I’m NOT in an exploring mood, or I’ve already appreciated your architecture on a previous visit, what I would like is all four vending  machines in close proximity to each other and to the entrance. And a stash box within a few steps in case we buy a heavy item (or items) and need to immediately offload to stash.
---
I'd be for just making them scale consistently.  Sometimes you'll do the launch prep, and it's a trickle of one robot here, one robot there.  That's boring.  But other times, for no reason, it'll be at least six of them in a group.  That can become rather frantic and fun.
---
Sort of like how, presumably because fewer players are running silos these days, the turrets are more consistently present.  They are a bit on the annoying side, but it makes it feel a bit more dangerous.
---
I think they should cut down on the third section considerably, though.  Hunting for Mainframe Cores is no fun and unless you made some in advance - which you eventually get in the habit of doing if you run silos often enough - the whole thing grinds to a total halt there.  That's when, of course, it's not lagging out with the whole removal/insertion thing.
---
my typical experience, I go B, everyone else goes A
---
C dies
---
alpha spawns at A, someone enters as alpha spawns robots everywhere, have to defend B for 20 seconds to save animal
---
go to A but too late, alpha dead, too bad so sad no tag
---
this has happened to me more than once including tonight, it's a poorly designed event
---
Hardly.
---
More legendaries but only 2 - 3 star
---
Furious handmade with a drum cylinder (85 round capacity) is my current favorite for bullet sponge enemies.
---
if they are legendary, turn them in for scrip
---
I went with 1 food type 1 water type and 1 gun. I got lucky and found a handmade gun plan early and only keep ammo for that one gun. If you have any power Armor parts keep it on one chassis. Each part weights 18+ lbs. But the chassis only weights 10 even when every part is on it. Only keep dog food on you as food. Get plenty at Flatwoods and Charleston fire Station kitchen. Bulk your scrapped junk and sell the excess. You'll need plastic for this. You can sell ANY bulk at any robot vendor. It'll make you a lot of money selling your excess junk. Any perk you pick that makes stuff weigh less affects your stache as well. Pick up bandolier, pack rat, light as a feather, etc.
---
Fist yourself with rocksalt. You'll feel much better.
---
Is that the one with water samples? Got that one a bunch and it always wants to die by making me go to deathclaw island!
---
My suggestion was about staggering the difficulty from each of the silis
---
By adding more and stronger enemies, not changing the layout.
---
Yep, that one.  Air samples too.  I remember the reward was nowhere near the ammo, time, and fast travel costs.
---
Doesn't work for Iron Fist, I just tested it. I doubt it works for any
---
What platform?
---
So why didn't you try to go to the menu? And all you lost was some junk which is easy to replace.
---
Ps4
---
What are the benefits of carrying so much?
---
I did it right after launch and beat it a bunch. Now it seems after the hype getting enough people to show is the biggest problem, which could easily be fixed if there was a server wide announcement. Its also crazy buggy which is why I mainly think people dont even go.
---
Bummer I'm on xbox. I was about to make a run.
---
You'd make a good soldier...as ease private. ;)
---
Make sure all the j7nk items have been broken down to base components before putting them in your stash and only have 100 or 200 of each. Youbdont need to keep any armor or weapons in the stash as you will find more later. If you find a max level item you know you will use feel free to stash that as you might not see another for another 200 hours.
---
You don't need all or aid items in the stash. Things like water or missiles only take up space and you won't ever need that many so throw out all the stuff you won't use and only carry enough water for for a trip or two. I carry 100 water on me but I've got perks that reduce there weight.
---
Yeah I whole heartily agree that close proximity to the spawn location and that all machines are together is essential. I struggle with the spawn location, as all of the tests I have done (with myself and others) seems it is random at best. Have you found out how to ensure the spawn location is static when you set up yours?
---
Thanks for the consideration!
---
Also, check your Misc tab. Sometimes ores and gunpowder stack up there, and you don't check it that often...at least I don't.
---
Someday I hope.
---
So far it seems he’s not apologetic for releasing the game in its state in November and knew full well the shit storm it was going to bring
---
If you don't need it, why are you carrying it?
---
Either exercise some control or start investing in weight reduction perks. 
---
If the weapons are rare keep them. Other weapons are still disposable at your level. 
---
You just got to start taking inventory management a bit more seriously.
---
Happened to me for the first time ever last night. Maybe server lag after someone drops off the map?
---
Really?! I kept them thinking i might use them one day
---
This definitely needs to be a thing.
---
What platform? All the codes are posted on Nukacrypt within a few hours of the code reset time. All you need to do is have a nuclear keycard and clear the silo; you can find the codes at nukacrypt.com
---
Bulk? Does that lesson weight?
---
I’m thoroughly creeped out.  Nice work!  Lighting makes all the difference... 😱
---
I run it with a group only. I met a few friends here on reddit and when we are on together we try to run. I've messaged every high level on the server and honestly so many people have zero idea what event I'm talking about, or won't join. 
---
I love the event, but only when there are enough people to play it successfully and properly.
---
Wait... you don’t need to find the individual codes yourself? Am I dumb??
---
People like that are in every game.  They enjoy spreading negativity and either don't think or don't care about the people their toxic playstyle affects.  They usually only play with the scales tipped in their favor so as to minimize their potential losses while maximizing the losses of their target, so the best move is to usually ignore them so as not to give them the satisfaction of a reaction then cut your losses.  In the case of Fallout 76, block them, log into a new server, and report them if you feel they were harassing you or otherwise ruining the game.  I'd definitely report them for abusing a common bounty exploit(it's not a bug, but blatantly against the spirit of the game).
---
Engineers outfit, I've got one on ps4 if you want it.
---
Do you happen to be on PS4? I’d love to actually run this event and complete it lol
---
Thank you! That's probably one of two things I spent the longest on... the other being getting the damn pews to line up.
---
Seriously though, I spent an hour fiddling with that circle of folding chairs trying to make it feel as bleak as a highschool club meeting. Finally managed it!
---
Done. Flux for days and be able to run an event? I'm sold on it
---
When I have to leave for some reason I’ll usually go to my camp and sleep or hide in a corner crouched. 
---
If I’m in a field, yeah sometimes I die or I’ve gotten booted, which I did only once as I just forgot about the game when I went to make dinner. Just reload the game and try again. 
---
If this sort of thing is too much for you, you’re going to have a real hard time in this game. Sometimes you just loose your junk. I’ve had mine clip through the floor or ground a couple times before. One time I clipped through the floor and landed like a couple miles away. I had to pay like 20 caps to get to my loot; which I was surprised was there. 
---
And the best way to loose your junk, is when you die in a real tough area that is way over your head, and I just say, “Screw the loot. It’s not worth going after it.” Lol. 
---
So build a camp, and then you’ll have a safer way to hide and do your business or whatever.
---
Amen!! +karma
---
&gt; I'm sure the response to the very first internet post was a flame.
---
[Reminds me of...](I'm sure the response to the very first internet post was a flame.)
---
First check to see if any of your legendary weapons are god roll scrip the rest.
---
Bulk everything then sell it trust me I used to hoard a bunch of stuff. Except for a few items ( screws, black titanium if you have excavator pa, and adhesive) keep 50 of everything else.
---
Check for missles, mini nukes, fusion/ plasma cores and 40mm grenades the weight adds up fast
---
Check your misc tab items like ore have weight
---
There is weight reducing perk cards and armor reducing pieces. I used to have 20% reduced weapon weight, junk, and food armor pieces.
---
Make a mule but this won't help the long term inventory management
---
You'll find better
---
No. It only reduces weight on a couple of things. You bulk to sell, not to store. 
---
Just remember it’s not Fallout 4. You don’t need a bajillion of everything. 
---
Don’t keep non legendary weapons you can’t use. Scrap them and learn mods. 
---
Don’t keep more than 100 of any scrap. Bulk and sell the excess. Unless you make ammo, then in that case...make ammo with the appropriate components. 
---
Eventually you’ll be able to go down to like 30 of everything. For now, just ease off the hoarding.
---
Doesn’t have to be anything major man, just some caps is cool... wouldn’t even know what to price it at lol
---
YES THATS İT! if I ever see you around I'll come asking, but now at least I know what to look for. thank you so much!
---
I have played about 1200h ....guess how many stalkers melee &amp; nocturnal wood pieces i have gotten
---
No problem :)
---
Stalker is not a effect for armor
---
Fyi, The dead deathclaws, bears, and sloths that you find at the fissure sites count for the photo daily/weekly objectives.
---
You get it when you turn in technical data. It's been my most used outfit. The welding helmet is part of the outfit  I think.
---
tried the radiation thing of standing in water but it just killed me without dropping and being able to be revived. only thing that worked was being shot by an enemy
---
No thanks, no human NPCs por favor. They could be cheeky about it and let them be Synths somehow
---
Vampire's Minigun having this same issue....   Wish I would have known before I spent the caps on it.  =/
---
I love them, can hardly play without them now. That said, they seem to be a little overpowered. There should be more incentive to not being mutated
---
I’m not a TSE expert but I’m pretty sure the reduction in damage is the second shot missing.
---
Found flatwoods monster in top right of the map first encounter with almost 150 hrs
---
I'll never forget the time I saw 30 moleminer claw thing plans. :(
---
It kills boredom having different weapons
---
Yeah, I noticed since they weren't that great at the start, and were unable to be explosive, most folks never held onto any of them, and of course that was the time of two shot explosive terror lol
---
Hell at least he’s open and not denying the “release now fix later” mentality.
---
I'm confused by large, non-linear camps.  Mine is a small, tall, one-foundation tower with stairways, hallways, and a general area that wrap around the center with no branching paths(besides a locked control/bed room).
---
Large rooms with multiple paths/doors with no indication of where to go are a weakness of mine.  The only educated idea I have at that point is to check around the outside and see if the CAMP maybe has a garage.  The outside vending machine trend has always puzzled me, but I've observed it and still make decisions based on it.
---
When it comes to legendaries, I want to see 3-stars and meta-roll 2-stars.  I don't personally buy them for scrip, but I'm still seeing 1-star legendaries with awful rolls for dumb prices and I just see that as a waste of stash and vendor space.
---
That's very peculiar, and quite interesting...
---
did that, nothing there
---
Wait for it to break after 5 shots
---
correct
---
Cool thanks :)
---
Yea I noticed it breaks really fast
---
That makes perfect sense, but I'm gonna stick with ghost camps.
---
Did you know zat if you go zere after dark, ze ghosts will get you? Sacre bleu! Also zut alors! Andale andale yeeha!
---
Lots. I'm assuming that's why not many people are taking part in it, that and the lack of a world announcement when it's up.
---
You aren't dumb, but people quickly learned that the nuke codes are universal, they change once a week but otherwise they are the same on all platforms on all servers. So some enterprising people set about making a system to 1. learn them as fast as possible and 2. post them for public enjoyment.
---
I did do that but it didn't work , Thanks for the help though
---
10000000% the most hated answer I will see on here, but i figured thats what i would have to do. dear bethesda, come fix my turrets
---
I’ve seen lvl 375 for sure, and higher ones that I less specifically remember (maybe 500’s). There is no level cap, and there’s technically not much benefit past lvl 50 if you max your build.  Collecting perk cards aside, it mostly represents the amount of time spent on the game.
---
It’s a shame because it’s really fun.
---
Scout Leader Penny? I’m just asking for clarification, I don’t know who voices her.
---
When you combine two shot and explosive the gun breaks down to fast to use it regularly
---
Maybe some pa mods work better non mutie
---
Can’t believe I haven’t heard about it, I thought you had to each nuclear code, so you only need the keycard and the website? That’s much easier than I thought it would be. Thanks!
---
Yea I see that now :( maybe just anti armor then
---
I haven't played in a while but I'd like to get back into it at some point. 29/m. Married father of 3. Playtime is super random but I'm a helluva team player lol. GT is MrNaglebums.
---
Add me ps4 dRG662
---
Yeah I would imagine it put tons of extra burden on CPU/GPU. The highest polygon count are on the power armors and weapons, now if everyone wants to showcase what they have, the servers will likely suffer more lag. Not a huge fan of it but appreciate Bethesda’s willingness to listen.
---
This applies to any sub on Reddit. They must have a dramatic exit no matter what.
---
If you find one
---
seperate piece, but they fit together very well.
---
I can see still targets with mentats. I don't really know what the description says but I assumed it all ways worked.
---
I added you when you wanna play just message me lol.
---
if you go can i have your stuff?
---
but dont go.   its fun.  just go for a walk when the server shits the bed.
---
Sorry I meant to say is supposed to complete the outfit. As least I think. I rocked it with the Assualtron mask.
---
That sucks. I wish I could help.
---
You are good to watch pvp videos. This is a crazy, chaotic pvp video.
---
 [Fallout 76 Crazy PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOXFuYYxFMc)
---
LOL. I haven't been in other subs, but I accept that it may be a rule that I overlooked.
---
See ya.
---
Yeah, it's 90% this, but the remaining 10% are the guys who've figured out how to glitch their CAMPs underground or inside inaccessible buildings (for Survival Mode).
---
The maximum player character weight limit is 1500 lbs before things have to be destroyed, combined with a max stash limit of 800 lbs, it brings our total to 2300 lbs and the character can still do things like craft, fight, eat, sleep, walk (very slowly). I would assume a server is capable of handling itself even if every player on it were at that capacity. 
---
Therefore, increasing the stash limit another 200, 400, or even 600 lbs would be fine. I'd wager the average carry limit for a player over 50 is in the range of 250-500 lbs, meaning a maxed out 1400 lbs (800+ upgrade of 600) stash box would still bring, on average, the total player load to 1650-1900 lbs. That's still 400 lbs below the current capable weight cap a player can reach. Meaning the total server load would increase, but not to the point that it could no longer sustain itself. 
---
I see plenty of complaints about server stability and disconnects, but I often wonder how many of those are player side and not server. Personally I haven't disconnected from a server involuntarily since last year, and even then it was seldom. Now I've gotten plenty of "just because it's not happening to you doesn't mean it's not happening," but I still don't think it's all server. But if you do have frequent disconnects, I'm sure it's infuriating. Also, most complaints I do see are console based, which tells me there's a pattern.
---
I believe a camp budget increase is a bit trickier to pull off and could hurt servers more than an increase to stash limit.  I don't think it's viable just yet, and may never be without a full server overhaul. (If that's even a thing)
---
tl;dr - A stash bump by even 600 lbs would probably be just fine on the servers.
---
Well, the INTENT is you find each keycode and figure out how to decode them. The community just came up with faster ways to do it ;) IIRC the nukacrypt guys mostly brute-force it. They collect a whole bunch of keycards, and then a team of them run the silos when the code resets, and start brute-forcing the combos.
---
Unless it's a legendary with amazing effects (god roll) , then i wouldn't worry too much about it. Toss it, scrap it, sell it.  Once you hit level 50, you'll never want to use regular weapons again.
---
You need to fast travel somewhere near by and then walk over I know it’s stupid but it’ll work
---
I have 32 perception so its bugged.
---
If you are not level 50 or close too it farm screws in a lower level location.
---
Max level players only have a small area on the map to actually farm for gear that's there level which really sucks.
---
Ahhh gotcha. Well, thanks for the help! Would you know how to easily get a nuclear keycard?
---
Ah! You are, of course, completely correct.
---
PC.
---
(My bad!)
---
OP Here, I made the change and had ZERO problems. Character and trophy progression are safe, as is everything i bought from the Atomic Shop.
---
I try to hit Uranium Fever, I don't have 33 yet but more than one for sale currently. Pretty cheap at least, it's bizarre the game values them at 450 caps when they're relatively easy to come by.
---
I’M LEAVING FOREVER BECAUSE I’M JUST SO FRUSTRATED!
---
Mentants only seem to work about 25% of the time for me, and only when I'm like within 20 feet of the target
---
Then 2 weeks later you must ask if you should come back.
---
Player vending has been added.  You can fast travel to other player's CAMPs and buy their stuff for the prices they have set.  They receive the caps minus a 10% service fee.
---
They added legendary scrapping, so you can scrap unwanted legendaries for a new currency called scrip.  You can exchange scrip for a random legendary.  More stars is more expensive, weapons are a bit more expensive to roll than armor.
---
The Pioneer Scouts add some side and daily quests along with challenges that earn you badges that you can exchange for Scout-related items and plans at Pioneer Scout campsites.  This content also added the backpack, which allows you to carry more and can also be modded with other effects and skins.
---
Cameras were added too.  If you find a tourist as a random event, you can repair their camera and complete their bucket list by touring Appalachia and photographing various landmarks.  The camera is also required for lots of daily and weekly challenges to earn free atoms.
---
There's a questline in the Ash Heap that leads up to a notoriously-difficult event with a boss battle after uncovering the mystery of the Sheepsquach as well as other Sheepsquach content.
---
There's another event called Project Paradise that requires that you assemble or join an extremely organized group of level 50+ players to raise creatures in an artificial environment and defend them from predators and aggressive robots.  This one is difficult for other reasons.
---
Lastly, they also added brewing.  Learn recipes from Biv E. Ridge in Morgantown and craft alcohol in a brewing station that you can build in your CAMP.  You can also unlock a Fermenter which allows fermentable alcohol that you've just crafted to ferment much, much quicker than it would in your inventory.
---
Gonna add you next time I’m on GT: Shearluck
---
Unless of course your weapon uses that ammo. Then I'd suggest investing in weight reduction perks if possible.
---
Batteries Included will reduce energy ammo weight dramatically. ( including plasma and fusion cores) 
---
Bandolier for ballistic ammo
---
Ordinance Express For explosive weight reduction.
---
Traveling Pharmacy to reduce stimpaks and other chem weights.
---
Once you hit 50 the only real incentive to keep levelling up is to get the extra cards so you're set for all occasions. If they make it easier to do it earlier then there is even less to do in the game at higher levels
---
I've seen one attacking Whitespring too.
---
it HAS to be the same woman that voice Moira.
---
You clearly can't read people .... I'd make a terrible soldier.
---
Do you have your sneak perks on? You could also make the armor shadowed. Also ive been trying to put a set together where all the pieces have harder to detect while sneaking. Little different than chameleon, but ive got two pieces with chameleon and htd. The other pieces are unyielding so i get even more points towards my agility and perception. Have it almost complete and i can sure see a difference. Been looking for my last piece and willing to pay 8k Lol. But when i do pvp most people cant see me, it atleast takes them awhile anyway.
---
Do you just server hop, or do you try to trigger the spawn too? One thing I’ve noticed is that people just hop from one server to another and if the vendor isn’t there they hop again. Try waiting a second in case it needs to load, then run across the bridge (I kill the grafton monster that spawns for about 20 free caps) then run back. You should spawn something so long as there’s no one has a camp their. I’ve never had to server hop more than a half dozen times.
---
I'm also a returning player and this summary was great.  Thanks!
---
I honestly just sell mine for cheap. If you really want to dump (clear stash space or something), as others suggested, Overseer camp or Flatwoods responder's chest.
---
[Brilliant timing](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw646d/when_reddit_users_stop_playing_fallout/)
---
I've felt this way for so long. I have a heavy weapon PA build with 15 strength and 15 intelligence. Yet I feel so fragile in it still.
---
To get the most out of power armor, you need to have Power User, Power Patcher, Batteries Included (just to keep the cores to make the damn thing work), Stabilizer and a bunch of other special interest perks. That is just to make it even viable to run around in.
---
So how does one 3 point tank killer perk completely negate 15-30 perk points?
---
How is that even remotely fair? It's like they are punishing players for choosing to play power armor. Not to mention all the "No Power Armor" perks and weapons you can't equip.
---
Long story short the benefits do not outweigh the negatives currently. I feel cheated and sad.
---
I don’t keep any weight reduction perks other than bandolier so I can maximize damage output.  It’s way easier to keep a minimal number of stimpacks on hand.
---
It's far easier to get the coat or anything else with a friend to help. Find him once an then take turns logging out an back in to look at its wares until you got what you wanted or until the vendor bot dies. It's how I keep my stuff in stock and have multiple copies of the outfits incase I want to sell them.
---
He is not bitchin about the disconnect. His bitch is about having to do it over. And with all the unacknowledged crap bugs in this game I don't blame him. I have had several of my favorite weapons and armor I worked to get just disappear. Everyone makes excuses for Bethesda's poor work on this game and their failure to admit the problems and work to correct them. This game is a failure because of this. I only play hoping they can get it fixed before my patience wears out. And I am not far from that point.
---
Player camp doesn't matter if it's their or not. It'll always spawn a random encounter.
---
Im a sniper build, use my tse dragon in pvp sometimes, and against larger creatures if im having trouble. Ive got the damage up to 2500 but with my perks and mutations but thats it so far. Comes in handy.
---
Breaks at the same rate a handmade does. Has a ton of damage just use it when needed not for your main go to weapon
---
Yea all sneak perks activated. Does armor type matter in pvp or just pve. As in is it easier to detect someone in heavy armor or is that just for monsters. I still would think I'd be able to see people sneaking more often if it was down to a case of shadowed vs non shadowed.
---
no worries man.  can i have your stuff too? lolz
---
ive had beauty guns disappear, nukes bug out, all that.  
---
Im not making excuses, just not expecting change from them.
---
You can reply directly to people by clicking reply on their posts. You’re responding to your own post so no one knows who you’re talking to with the three posts you made in the comments.
---
What does it look like? I can't get a result from Google.
---
I've got a level 35 TSE I found off a ghoul some months back. It's really fun, but not really useful outside sniping tough enemies. Mine breaks from 200% condition in like 10-15 hits
---
And yeah, the damage tanks down hard at range. with two shot, there are more pellets, and the pellets have more spread. Which means less of them will hit. Also, once you exceed the weapon's range (which is pretty far), the damage per pellet will tank as well
---
Your kind are not worthy of my stuff.
---
Yea im pretty sure it works the same in pvp as pve. Almost certain shadowed and harder to detect make a big difference. Ive noticed some people see me way easier than others. Maybe theyre running unyielding and have high perception or even use eagle eyes. Ive ran into some pvp players who have perfect builds
---
F
---
Kinda depends on if there is more effort spent on static or non-static items. I mean, the FO76 (and FO4) world has a tone of moveable objects that go everywhere when shot/exploded/ect. I honestly suspect they worry about someone trying something [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrhDamN82k). They already have a few places with items you can nudge stuff over a ledge.
---
Sure, after some time it gets easier as you specialize your build. But most players won't specialize until well after level 50. Most will opt for QOL perk cards early on since you tend to hoard everything, not knowing if you'll need it down the road.. case in point, OP hoarding all them weapons because he hasn't learned yet. 
---
Just figured i list out the perks so OP can see their are ways to help minimize weight while he figures things out. I'm willing to bet most players don't even specialize their builds and have a mess of perks.
---
Hahahaha yeah you have a point. Frustration makes me react dramatically
---
Does anyone know if the Cannibal perk works with Butcher? I'm trying to find a way to get extra things like high radiation fluid and hardened mass.
---
It does work on ticks. You can get an extra tick blood when you search, but it doesn't for things that are not animals. 
---
I have no trouble getting the raw flux, but the other stuff is always a hassle.
---
Ya find your groove and what you like to use. Kick the excess. At level 50 with appropriate perks I was able to  be fully stocked w gear and power armor etc and my weight is only 60.
---
Also sell all of your chems. They sell like crap but it's some extra money. I find I don't like the cons compared to the pros with chems so I sell them. Also don't hoard heavy ammo like connon balls, missiles, low charge fusion cores 50 cal etc.
---
Build a permanent camp. Having to rebuild camps all the time will get your components all messed up. Build once and toss out excess concrete and wood
---
From the daily selling to NPC vendors plus running my own vending machines, I easily get close to max caps consistently. If I can't find enough stuff to buy from other players I buy a new serum recipe to bring it back down.
---
But I also hate finding a weapon/armor piece and not having enough caps, so I try to stay above 10k but below 20k. Anything above 10k and I'm in spend mode.
---
I loved these in Fallout 4. So cool to experience them in 76 also. But fuck crickets man
---
I think it’s the server lag to where they left but they’re camp signal is still there like they’ve been there a while so the server got used to it
---
You ever consider the ones who quit 76 may actually be the smart one's?
---
Certainly. On my first playthrough I maxed out two weight reduction perks and it wasn’t worth it. It helps to do some planning ahead with a build to keep it effective.
---
I've gotten hundreds between that event and the Ash heap. I can't imagine why anyone would buy one ever.
---
I vote BE handmade.
---
Where in Watoga?
---
watch the skies for convoys of flying robots. There'll be a little 4 thrust cargobot guarded by 3 vertibots. Shoot down the cargobot (aim for the thrusters to do more damage and slow it down) and when you destroy it it drops it's cargo, which includes a keycard. You can get a quest marker for a cargobot convoy from the Enclave war room
---
What does plague walker exactly do? I’d like to know if it could be used to get some materials to make Chems (need toxic soot flower mostly)
---
You can buy it from the vendor specifically in the "production" vendor at the bunker.
---
Visually it looks like a matte olive/drab solid color. Personally I think it is the best looking X-01 paint aside from maybe the solid black.
---
It works well for camo in the forest areas.
---
You’re a legend. Thanks!
---
tough crowd.  
---
good luck out there.
---
should include 1 roll of toilet paper too
---
That’s a good point! I was there for a quest but then noticed all of the fans and gloves lol.
---
So you use power armor on your bloodied shotgunner?
---
How long are the day night cycle? Be interesting as a second or 3rd weapon if you could use it for an houror more
---
Yea that sucks but oh well
---
Beths should hire you to make the game more interesting :)
---
Does the damage reflect on npc enemies
---
Im hear for the glory of the Black Goat
---
Sent you a friend request, if you want a lvl 15 bloodied baseball bat its yours. I used it to level up my alt and it served me very well even into the 40's.
---
It's a male voice that comes from the speakers at the start of the obstacle courses.
---
Ah yes I had to do that 3 times over then gave up and just went to final location. It's just a stupid quest.
---
Wait you’re saying I don’t need the key fragment?
---
What is the point of pacifist mode now that slap damage is gone?
---
What is dead may never die
---
Is this PC? Is it ancient &amp; need upgrade?
---
This is 100% accurate. If you craft them from scratch, you can visually see the over charge like you would with a weapon repaired with the Weapon Artisan perk.
---
Be warned though, if you reload before the core runs out, I've had a glitch where the over charge core got converted to a normal one.
---
Also, if you manually equip a core that has been over charged that is not at full power, visually it shows that you can have two cores equipped. It looks weird, so I would only use regular or only use over charged cores.
---
LegendaryPapaD Would love to have a team to play with
---
Can I have bacon plz
---
My gamertag is the weseal09 Xbox
---
Yeah, a few times. It's always camps that look like they have good stuff, too.
---
Looking for groups is best done in community discords. You're more likely to get fast responses
---
FYI: there are a few spots he spawns, I think 3 or 4.  
---
[Read this thread and the comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a94qxe/how_to_find_the_vendor_bot_responder/)

If you FT to them you should still be able to get in there, though, right?
---
How to get into a pve server?
---
Servers and user-client work a whole lot better than during launch weeks. Expect crashes and disconnects occuring 90% less often.
---
Each time you hit "Play" it gives you the option of Adventure (PVE) or Survival (PVP).
---
Will you be on tomorrow
---
Thank you so much. It worked. Though I've still got one phantom turret hidden in my budget I suspect it's the turret I originally replaced when it disappeared however all the ones I didn't replace this worked. Thank you again.
---
Truth gets downvoted here now.
---
There are real design problems, both new and inherited from 4 and new. Not just glitches, but lazy/contradictory design choices and systems that aren’t balanced or fleshed out.
---
Enemies shouldn’t feel like either bullet sponges or wet tissue, depending on build. Every weapon and build archetypes should be roughly balanced with trade offs and power level. Some weapons should not just be useless, broken and bugged. Scatter Lazers are still useless and break in a few shots... not separating PvE and PvP servers but trying to reinvent the wheel, trying to be both at the same time and leaving almost everyone half satisfied. Just bad design/balance.
---
Enemies still spawn in and just destroy new players when a high level walks by. It’s frustrating as hell to be level 28 and having somebody soawn in a whole new wave of max level super mutants when you’ve just cleared because they’re 800lbs over loaded and not using fast travel because they don’t have stash space for all their rando legendary items (that could just be low weight mods for legendary slots).
---
I’m impressed real time vats works as well as it does, not that it’s close to perfect by any means, but it’s generally sufficent and I didn’t expect it to really work, but it does and I’ll give them credit for that.
---
Something like the “Legendary System” is a primary example of how sloppy/lazy BGS has gotten.
---
WTF is a legendary in Fallout? Is it some relic from the war, a prototype weapon? Why aren’t they craftable mods with some kind of backstory - like secret WestTek prototypes or some mad Enclave scientists project? Why are some monsters legendary? Why do they all mutate the same way? Why don’t some mutate multiple times (more stars) - they’re not some mad scientists project gone awry? Some mutant strain of the FEV?
---
Nope. They’re just “legendary” because that’s what the meta mechanic is, and they just slapped it into Fo4 without so much as a coat of paint or a little sanding to make them actually make sense in the context of the world.
---
How did this not get fixed between 4 and 76? It’s not even bugs, not even code (or it doesn’t have to be) - it could have just been renaming them and some fucking terminal entries...
---
He brought up a good point: a lot of multiplayer games seem to have bad feedback on launch but improve it over time. I think people just love to bitch about everything way too much but at the end they will come around.
---
I'm on xbox :( 
---
But if anyone here wants to do successful runs I'm pretty good at directing teams and getting the bots shut down. As long as people collect food, stick by their animals and In their zones and dont rush off for their 3 star wood leg from the boss, the event is really easy to complete and a lot of fun.
---
I'd play it.
---
They'd have to be careful to not make it exploitable, where 2 players work together, one takes damage and heals as the other deals damage and reaps rewards.
---
That is very kind of you, thank you alas I am on PC.
---
Also wanted to add that the spawn rates for the food resources are severely bugged. I ran the event last with about 9 people and only maybe 10 radstags spawned. There was zero way to get the feeder full. Same for the toxic waste one. They do not generate fast enough to get to the level 3 status on a consistantly basis. 
---
I have had runs where the deer spawned non stop and we had 80 venison in the machine but that's like 1 out of 10 times.
---
You know you can lock doors and water purifiers right? I say if something is locked, don't take from it or anything behind the door. If it isn't locked, it's fair game.
---
Honestly, locking your water purifiers is idiotic IMO. I see people with 10 big locked purifiers trying to sell water at their camps for like 20 caps a piece. This isn't FO4. Water is worth 0 caps and is not a viable money maker anymore. Best practice is to leave those unlocked so no one ever goes thirsty.
---
I ALWAYS close their doors and kill their enemies. But no one else seems to do that because every time I go back to my camp I have to fix a load of broken shit and all the doors are open.
---
It gives a lot of damage to everything i shoot with it lol,  not sure if it reflects differently than to players but i dont think its any different
---
How do I mutate myself safely? I only become superhuman when my rads are 75% of my health
---
I think its the mutation that causes a damage auara based on the amount of diseases you have,  more disease more damage it does to enemies
---
Oh, well, at lvl 48 you can go anywhere, if you made a decent build and got right gear.
---
 West Tek is easy to farm and profitable. Every supermutant gives a few caps and a weapon. Three caps stashes in the place, also. Once cleared the building, scrap the bad weapons and keep the good ones (+20 caps each) for sale. Many legendaries show, as bonus.
---
 Blackwater Mine is very easy to run and it's next to the WS station, so np carrying 800 pounds to unload them at the vendor bot in the station. The event triggers sometimes, so pros and cons.
---
 If you have problems with those areas, there are places where you can score dozens and dozens of fast easy kills of mobs who use weapons: Grafton, Morgantown Airport/Trains, New Gad... These areas are more focused for level 5-25, but they provide good XP and caps.
---
 Btw, when levelling, in need of XP and caps, it's good thing to grab all the meat we find, and to keep some wood to cook it. Every meat piece is cookable and saleable (no need recipes). Extra XP and some caps.
---
Yeah spawn rates are awful. I finally have a bunch of decent people to run it with but it won't spawn enough food. Hope they patch this.
---
Thought you are in the final quest. The final quest resets all the time...Unfortunately you need the key fragments, but don't feel bad since that quest is bugged as hell.
---
I just tried that and my husband did too. Hopefully that does it, just played for another hour and no disconnect issues so far! Fingers crossed it continues this way :) thank you!
---
it gives you a damage AoE based on how many diseases you have. The problem is, even if you don't have any diseases, it seems to do a "0 damage" AoE that will make neutral creatures hostile. Like brahmin, or the vendor bot. Even though it doesn't damage them.
---
All developers do that. Others just rename their engine every year to fool simple people like you.
---
One other huge thing to keep in mind is that the spawn area is very unpredictable. If you lock your doors or create areas other can't get to, you are effectively risking putting them in prison.
---
There is no logical reason to lock any door anymore.
---
You can lock your resources and your water (if you are a terrible and selfish person) but there is no reason whatsoever to lock up any other room.
---
I have a ts handmade.. no explosive, and it breaks CONSTANTLY. 
---
I've also got an executioners and instigating handmade. I use the instigating while crouched for one hell of a first shot, then switch to the other for the double damage for the last 40 percent of health. I melt things and the guns last forever.
---
That kinda sucks
---
You can now purchase them from the vendors in white spring. They are 12000 caps.
---
Dibs on the SM suicider
---
I would cry. I would just cry.
---
Yep, 100%, it was in an early (closed) beta state. Clearly there had been no testing and feedback of multiple, significant aspects of the game.
---
I dont think the servers can handle it, game is falling apart since last update.
---
I fully agree with you! I would just be happy to have some acknowledgement of specific things and plans to rectify them.
---
Sure...but those death tambo, knuckles and pickaxe aren’t exactly top tier items...
---
It’s because the beta wasn’t an actual beta at all, it was just a marketing gimmick to push preorders to get full price before it tanked.
---
At best, as far as actually doing anything for the game it was a stress test.
---
If they would instance the food spawns per player it would be a lot better. I understand they can’t really do that with the deer but the spawn rate for deer (when it’s working) is high enough for two people to fill the feeder. It seems like the food containers at Feed The People are instanced.
---
do you smell burnt toast
---
There were no tears. A little fear pee, but no tears.
---
The welding helmet can be found at the mine east of Whitesprings, found at least 5 of them there.
---
Man, that's waaaay more caps than I have. Thanks for the info, though!
---
Gotta get them hate clicks. It's the same thing with star wars now, people throw a shitfit when they don't get their way and then people like yongyea, juicehead, etc capitalize on it because it's profitable and then they milk it dry. 
---
Youtube was a mistake is what i'm getting at. it's all trash.
---
Resident Evil 6 did something like this but it wasn't very fun.
---
I hate those things and the stupid DERRRRRR sound.
---
Oh, hey, a legendary one with uber poison. I guess I'll just die now.
---
Almost all the speculation is based off of a few clips of what? Describing remaining teams? Being victorious? And not being within a safe zone? 
---
Sure, through the lens of what's big right now? Those clips seem like a BR mode....
---
However, they could also very well be describing a competitive horde mode. Teams of players moving to various safe spots and fighting waves of enemies.
---
It could be describing a death race. Teams of enemies racing to a specific objective, with safe spots intermittently. 
---
It could be describing just about anything. Teams....last team....being victorious... Those are all pretty generic.  The safe zones thing is the main thing fueling this BR thing....
---
And safe zones could imply just about anything.
---
I've found one while searching treasure maps, and another as a random mob drop.  The mob Drop was a 1 star legendary.
---
im 12 years old and i play fallout 76 everyday
---
i personally love the game,
---
but i always see alot of older people playing 
---
my friends dont like the game but i dont care i do
---
i once found this kid that was playing fallout 76
---
and had some fallout 76 gameplay with him until he asked to play fortnite 
---
at that time i sorta liked fortnite, but i still played it
---
he would always ask me to play fortnite.
---
i never accepted.
---
im in love with fallout 76 \*no homo\*
---
and will love to see younger kids like me play it
---
Shoot makes me wonder if u test ur luck would it kill u on detonation after u get your shot off
---
Like Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
---
It’s pretty far from “the game is being released in a beta state and if you want to play thenpolished, fully finished version give it time”.
---
It was mostly treated as I’d think it was obviously intended - as a thank you to the people willing to take the risk on a live service FO game, and not declaring that they were killing FO from the rooftops because it wasn’t single player FO5.
---
51 father of 3, random hours due to workshift level 77, gametag RoaringAnemone6, need also a team.
---
Can we get more pictures of your C.A.M.P?
---
Thank you for getting the reference i was making with Dr. Strangelove
---
Be warned: it's glitchy.
---
Your gloves will constantly clip into your hands. It's annoying.
---
At least you can't see the apron and gas cannister in first person mode....
---
And it doesn’t even say that. You could I guess ex post facto see some implication of that, I guess...
---
If in adventure. Build a box round the workshop. They cant do shit until you attack back.
---
I remember how jarring the jump from 3 to 4 was for that reason.  I can't imagine going back now.
---
I rock the grognak look when I play mellee the ladies get cra cra.
---
My opinion Bethesda didn't take the count most of us have pretty  good headsets or are aware of the blurry tree moving op I heard a fart yep that's someone has actually happened...
---
&gt; dont rush off for their 3 star wood leg from the boss
---
This.
---
Once you have had a chance to play with it please let me know your thoughts.
---
That’s actually really cool of you. I’d be jumper for sure. Once you get the marsupial perk it’s just like you forget how to play normally.
---
Green Thumb works on nuked flora. I go to a nuke zone, I get hundreds of nuked flora.
---
The Flora is not the problem. High Radiation Fluids seem to be the rarest ingredient needed, at least for me, so all that hundreds of nuked flora turn into inert flux.
---
if you move your camp, it should put them all back in stored. I know that's a pain in the butt, but if you really want that phantom one found... that should do it.
---
God damn I wanna play as a grafton monster
---
21 days .... and not a single Deathclaw hide.
---
Add to that that the musical instrument and chemistry badges are screwed, and how difficult Campfire tales is to get a frickin possum badge, and I'm pretty frustrated
---
This happens to me a lot. This method mentioned here ^ is what works for me.
---
I use several weight reduction perks, it was temporary at first but now with player vending I've become stuck. I really feel the reduced damage output, and now after making boat loads of caps, I'm thinking I might seriously reduce my shop to maybe just serums and excess junk then keep the rest of the stash for me.
---
I hear ya.  Same boat.  I'm hoping for a patch on Tuesday that will fix it.
---
There's a crashed boat south of Deathclaw Island if you follow the coastline, where one is filled with lootable harpoons next to a skeleton with a harpoon gun.
---
Id be down to help gt:Travis party181
---
i was making salisbury steak in the food factory, went outside and stant up above the truck trailer, i saw a dude coming from the bridge i said hi and wave my hands, next thing that happened was a rain of explosive bullets over my ass lol, i tried to respawn and fight back buy my shitty south american lag can't tag someone as melee, i always end up hitting the air even with 90%
---
now i spend my time in the workshops crouched with chamaleon armor in some corner while doing my business or waiting for the steaks, i just want to sell pristin food in my camp
---
Well, if you have bounty, you should be eaten, because you did something wrong.
---
Oof
---
You can't catch, fight, kill, cook, and eat giant mutated fish monsters irl.
---
workshops are pvp zone
---
It kills just as quick as my BE handmade, and its got so much style points going for it lol, I definitely dig it
---
Was he wanted? I did this trying to get someone to kill me, nobody would :-(
---
Nah. Games used to do significant closed beta periods where people would actively test the game over several cycles and give feedback while the devs adjusted the game. I beta’d WoW and a couple other much lesser games. I was in Beta for WoW for 4 months and the whole beta was like 10 months long.
---
The whole time we tested the game and made sure it was released in a good state. 
---
WoW was far more “polished” and coherent as a game when I started Beta than FO76 was up until probably the last patch, if it is now (considering the vastly different eras in game norms and tech).
---
They just release games in what would have then been closed beta, and we pay for the privilege of being testers. It’s a creep that started when AAA publishers saw what indies were doing (getting away with in their eyes, I’m sure)  with Early Access.
---
Most of them and im a solo character so some of them are impossible
---
sometimes you get mad bc u lost a precious bag of junk and want to fight back as an idiot and when you deal with it maybe you lost hundred of caps just by being salty mad wanting revenge xd
---
Two days ago I was playing with my GF. She finaly enjoy this game again, as we started new charracters. We were on survival server for those tasty XP %. Around level 15 I noticed, I am 3rd in scoreboard and thought about killing myself, In second i jumped from cliff, some cap hunter made pile of meat from my gf with explosive atomatic gun. 
---
We will get revenge soon, only 35 more levels and we will rule to appalachia!
---
I still can only play for maybe a week at a time before the frustration of a million cuts builds up and I give it up for another month or two and get bored with Civ.
---
I didn’t play for. Like 5 days after release until a good month after brewing. It was just broken. I beta’d plenty of games, I know an early beta when I see one.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again
---
Can you shoot the mini nuke to get them to detonate like you can in FO4?
---
Yep
---
Play, not buy.
---
Have they fixed all the things yet?
---
My mind instantly thinks of "Mimics" which look like normal chests but are instead monsters with huge tongues, when you open them they bite you. Which can link both the messages, one player left "Amazing chest ahead" and the other "Tongue but whole" which can lead me to believe there is a mimic ahead.
---
yes, mine is a two  shot variant.
---
I didn’t know they were removed from the scorch beast queen? I’ve never gotten one tho and I’ve played since January.
---
Were you stomping around diseased creatures?
---
For Whoopsies, were you stomping around diseased Mirelurks?
---
I replied below with an explanation of what those messages were used for.
---
Bethesda is doing gameplay steam? Then fucking show me how to do all those fucked up daily challenges, please.
---
If you need stims in a hurry, I have a cure!
---
You'll need these perks first: Chemist, Super Duper (three stars) and Butcher (three points there too).
---
Next head to the tick shed. There is an area just south west of where the railroad ends out on the southern outskirts of the mire south of Harper's Ferry (or do the bug collecting quest to find a good spot for tick spawns).
---
The butchers perk works on ticks for the tick blood. With super duper and chemist, you can easily get enough blood to make 4-6 blood packs. Then, with chemist and super duper again, you can double that amount and snag an extra or two from the same perks.
---
I got grounded plans from her at some point. But I don't do scorched Earth as much as I use to.
---
Wait isn't ZAX one of those Supercomputers like MODUS and president Eden, i remember in the enclave bunker MODUS and ZAX had a conversation over being interested in something

This is true, and used to make the same argument defending 76 before it came out - and we all saw how that turned out, whether some of us will admit it or not. Not hopeful they’ll do the work between 76 and SF to the engine they clearly didn’t between 4 and 76.
---
What do you honestly think the chances are that we’ll have usable ladders are? Like 2%?
---
They removed them in patch 8.5 iirc.
---
Quitters
---
I was punching pretty much everything. Death Claw, mirelurk queen, scorched... Never got a single disease.
---
The description of the Tequila and the Tequila Margarita say you're supposed to have a chance to get a disease and I would assume that would be on every hit of punching anything..... Have you tried it? Do they have to be diseased for you to get it from melee?
---
Then you must clean said toilet or you get swamp gas!
---
Is this the map you’re referring to?
---

---
I guess they want to limit players to being forced to buy them. People gained all the serums pretty quick when servers used to spam Scorched Earth.
---
Better question: why does she still drop Ultracite plans? :'(
---
hahaha, the purpose of Tick Blood Tequila is the OTHER effects (replenish hunger/health via melee attacks). The disease is the drawback!
---
But anyway, I had the same idea and no I never got a disease either. I'm guessing either it 1) flat out doesn't work or 2) raises the chance of you getting a disease from a source that has it- which is silly, they transmit diseases at a really high rate as it is.
---
Anyway if you want whoopsies, what you have to do is get them from a diseased mirelurk spawn. The little low-level jerk kind that a mirelurk queen shoots out to defend her, not the bigger shelled dudes.
---
Unfortunately they, for some reason, are the only thing in the game that has a super low transmission rate. I had to stand there for several minutes before it gave me whoopsies. 
---
So the best thing to do is to cripple a queen's legs so she can't chase you around and kill you with poison, shoot her until she spawns mirelurk spawns, hope at least one is diseased, and then stand there for several minutes (not in front of the queen!) while they bite you. That's how I completed that challenge. Hope it helps!
---
Yes, thank you for pulling that up.
---
In the past like early days you could scrap things and it would give you those resources as well as build there and get xp. So you could take a workshop build a ton of silly shit (like fences in FO4). But that was taken out months ago.
---
Yeah thank you. At this stage one phantom turret I can live with as I'm not maxing them out. It's just good to get the others back
---
Because the economy needed cap sinks. They're all available from the enclave vendors, all the time now. They just cost 17,500 caps.
---
Between player vending, playing several characters, and the combined cap pool, I've now been able to buy most useful Power Armor mods, and I'm 2/3 of the way through the Serum recipes. I only had 2 before the change.
---
Hi 2/3 of the way through the serum recipes. i only had 2 before the change., I'm dad.
---
Six! Oh wow. I have to run from just one or two. I can’t stand those creatures.
---
Right! I really wanted the negative effect to work - I thought it would be funny to be a plague bear. ;)
---
Yeah, my plan for Whoopsies was (well, still is) to just shotgun her legs out and hope she spawns some diseased babies. Throw on some Diluted Rad-X and hope for the best.
---
a hit that will be exceedingly usefull at your level sir.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/)
---
I have crafted and drank dozens of Tick Blood Tequila, and then the Tequila Sunshine and the Tequila Margarita from there.
---
I have not once noticed my hunger bar move (either direction) because of the Drink, nor have I acquired any sort of disease unexpectedly.
---
My wife stopped playing a week post  launch, I come back for a week or so every couple months.
---
She’s sleeping peacefully and I’m posting, annoyed by the living equivalents of the “this is fine” burning room meme because I wanted to see if they stopped gating the camera you need for basic gameplay functions behind insane RNG yet...
---
So yes, very much so.
---
"Smart one's"
---
Well !@#$.
---
I wasn't bothering to keep an eye on health or food to be honest. I guess it's just completely broken. :\
---
I believe it refers to what player level you should expect to be when visiting those areas.
---
yeah, I originally thought it was meant to synergize with plague walker, but it just doesn't seem to work in any useful way.
---
[](/celestiawink)Out of curiosity what wasn't fun about it? I've never played RE6 so I don't know. Was it badly implemented, or was the gameplay not conducive to it, or was it something else?
---
Yeah this is 100% accurate. This games pvp was AMAZING Early days when we all had pipe pistols. The first time I pvpd someone it was like a ten min battle for the junk yard. Now it's crouch/shoot/loot and that's boring but also has no point when you want for nothing in the game.
---
That's pretty much everyone leaving anything on the internet.
---
The next panel should be the same guy slinking back in a side door.
---
The quitter's are Bethesda people who quit delivering quality games and think it's ok. I have every Fallout. Probably the only reason I am still hanging in there.
---
*6/2/19
---
I've tried WoW recently and it's less polished than 76. On top of that, it's far more simple. You click on enemy and spam numbers. Easy to make something that basic.
---
If it helps, I consistently find a body just outside Wally's Water World (I think that's the name; look for the water slide gator in the North of Toxic Valley) that has the broken camera and list. 
---
Dunno where else to find it, except toolboxes for some reason; I think that 'unlocks' after the quest is completed. But, you can always hang put there and world hop until it appears.
---
no, i run that on a 30" and no borders
---
you have inspired me to go be the slutty male in grognak drag for my next session.. there's a flex emote in there somewhere isn't there?
---
Load up fallout 4 and you can tell it was decrease by at least 50%. I assume helps the game run but it sucks.
---
I say this as a guy who really hates this game and does think that those who leave are the smart one.
---
Its irrelevant to the post.  Its a bit of humor poking fun at how people who are dissatisfied feel the need to dramatically rant to a bunch of rando strangers on the internet about why they'll no longer have the luxury of your company.
---
Completely ignoring that no one cared if you lived or died - and they certainly don't care where you do it at.
---
fixed it using Optimum Reshade mod Natural w/o black bars.
---
I can by switching a few perk cards around. Right now I only use excavator after a queen fight to pick up loot and then travel.
---
it has massive potential, but the execution so far is a slow motion train wreck
---
lol nice easiest legendary to kill in the game I'd imagine. the  ones you see are laughably easy to kill . the ones you hear but cant quite get a visual lock on however....
---
1-2k. Before player vendors i gave two away because cap and stash limit.
---
what does the "Formula P" do?   I know it's increases charisma and luck and accuracy but does it do something for the animals you need to protect?
---
I use vanguard's combat armor with deep pockets for Cary weight. But a bezerker build sniper also works well in most cases
---
I also notice people price by where their camp is.  Almost every camp I’ve gone to near white springs is WAY overpriced.
---
sharing perk cards are only good when you team doesnt have it equipt first, it doesnt stack if the have they have the card you shared equipt. if you team players has green thumb equipt and you share green thumb as well you will still get 2 not 3 or 4.
---
the returning door of shame. aah I know it well.
---
Cheers. It killed my buzz, so I haven't been back since. Thanks for the update, will head back tonight
---
The basement of the satellite place a lil north of West Tek spawns legendaries sometimes. Also bot stop event in the bog spawns a legendary sometimes as well as the one across the street from legendary vendor. Last two days seen a few 3* there.
---
I made a bad choice with my first purchase from the possum vending machine ..... earning enough badges for a second choice has really been a slog. ... like the first choice wasn't a slog already.
---
Looking forward to eating them instead
---
I use a 1* instigating guass for 1 shot snipe.  With fully perked sneak/rifle it one shots most things fine.  for multi-target and/or close quarters and/or cases where instigating is not sensible,  I use an aae handmade.   I also use an AA lever for burning .45 ammo on trash mobs.  Lastly, I use a plasma flamer for melting faces off super mutants for giggles.

This might help

I know.  I've pretty much given up until they fix things.  I still look for magazines and keep my eyes open for hides but I'm more focused on getting legendaries to grind for scrip now.

If you accidentally hit some one the second an event is over you opened up for PvP and can easily be shot in the back if your not paying attention.

morgantown airport farm has some in the grass there see just a couple to get started is all you need. also the nuka cola plant greenhouse has a couple and in whitespring clubhouse fridges and lewis and farms. once you get the first 1 or 2 its easy money. if you're on pc my ign is GarlandTD you can come raid my crops.
---
When and where did they post that the serum recipes were removed?
---
That’s a good point. Perhaps not showing player names and randomized server placement would prevent it. Or at least make it very difficult.

Is your sound on? cause the microphone symbol and all that could be a giveaway. I'm not talking about muting the mic either then it shows the symbol with an X.

Only just hit 64 last night after launching my very first Nuke and doing it entirely solo, just to see if I could. I picked up the game during beta and I too have not stopped since. 
---
Hit me up on PC if you want to and visit my fort camp, I'm Palpadean.
---
I totally understand. Was just curious to hear your point of view.
---
f4 was the best presentation i ever saw, they showed the new building system, the workbenches with weapons mods and armor that we have for granted now but in 2015 my jaw dropped imaging that i could pick a weapon mod them and even give it a name. Fallout shelter? yeah released tonight for ios, want to use your phone as app for the pipboy? yeah! release? in 4 month!
---
Wanted amount should be based on level. That way if a level 5 steals he gets a 10 cap bounty vs a lv 100 layer getting a 50 cap bounty. 
---
Now that pacifist mode works pretty well, the negative for wanted status should be more harsh.
---
Survival mode is for when you want to go and attack other players.
---

"it takes years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to destroy it". Umm...don't you think that maybe there is a problem there then?

this game will not have micotransactions, good night

What system are you on?
---
I recently broke 300 caps. I feel rich as fuck.
---
you killed the WS vendor bot. sure, got any more of these sweet fantasy stories? was fun to read, 10/10.
---
I was visiting player vendors somewhere near there and one spawned in the lake near his camp. We took it down, but the body reset and i got no loot.
---
Sneaky, sneaky, sir.
---
While I can generally come up with amusing events, it's not really any better than someone else might come up with. Big thing is, this I can change, so when the hiding spots get stale, I can swap them for new ones or move my camp all together. An in-game anything has to figure out how to be static, and without instancing, you can't really randomize it without basically changing the world every day.
---
When I get bored with this, I might see if I can make one of those "dead brahmin launchers" I vaguely remember seeing and set up something like a strongman test. Start the animal a (very) short distance away, have the player nudge and smack it down, launch and see how high it goes.
---
except he made that up soo
---
That's fair.
---
I sell all extra junk at 1 per. but I am more selling it to get it out of my stash and help someone else in the process and I am already near or at cap stash limit most of the time.I dont keep more than 100 for my own junk stash all else gets sold or pitched.
---
I fought five or six of them up in the Toxic Valley, I think I might have killed one of them.  I lost count of the number of times I would die trying to retrieve my dropped junk before I just gave up.
---
Okay. I'll bookmark your post for the future. Haven't set up a camp yet. I deployed the camp device and moved it once. Moving it costs a (for me) fortune in caps. Have to find a good, long-term place I guess.
---
Maybe when I'm ready, I'll come to your camp and you can show me your melons.
---
You have modded the game before you even played it?
---
I had two drop within an hour last night
---
With hard bargain tatos sell for two caps. And corn soup satisfies hunger and thirst as well as giving ap regen......
---
Yes I'm addicted and love this game as well.
---
Fallout 3 was my first love.  I just new this was my "thing" the first time I developed my character in Vault 101 and finally stepped out alone into the desert.  
---
The overall vibe of the Fallout series and the less than predermined experience with each session definitely has me hooked.  It plays like a "choose your own adventure" story, and like any good book - its hard to put down.  
---
Also, I kinda feel attached to my character and the decisions he makes.  Fallout 76 allows me to form my character into a closer version of myself (or who I want to be) in this apocalypse.   And FO76 does this more than any of the other Fallout games I've played.
---
Lastly, its my getaway.  It's a break from the stressors in life.  Like a golfer who looks forward to playing some rounds after work, or the next club they are going to buy, I think about my next Appelachian adventure or my next Atom shop purchase for CAMP.  Lol
---
PS - I don't think my wife understands this obsession of mine at all, but man is she cool for not being uncool about it. She's even buying me FO clothes like t-shirts and hats.  And when we took a trip to Boston, I took her around to all the historical landmarks while also comparing the architecture to their in-game renditions.   Man was that fun.
---
.
---
Hmm, there is around 20ghouls in whitespring golf club, if you nuke it and get one friend to server hop, to respawn them for you, you can do 500 in day, buy you will have 300lbs of legendaries, that you have to throw away, because bethesda did fucking 150scrip cap on legendary scraping machine. What a great game &lt;3
---
well that's because they are using the same engine that they use with f4 and add online capabilities but this game started before f4 finished in some way, that's why you can't carry the updates or fixes f4 had because f76 was already in development. Also a lot of fixed were done by the script extender F4SE that it's not official and bethesda doesn't use
---
im not defending them but shits aren't simple and just by having older bugs doesn't mean you should avoid this game as if it were a plague or something
---
Xbox
---
Thanks
---
I belive, we have to craft ritual bindings (or how is that mothman ritual outfit called), then make stone dagger and sacrifice few bethesda developers. Praiers are not egouth, we must spead our believs !!!!
---
I'm critical of the game, but that's because I play it almost every day. I've got 400+ hours in it, so I don't avoid the game... but I still get frustrated at the state of the game sometimes.
---
Ok. But why even have weight, at that point?
---
This game isn’t even that bad though. I don’t understand the hate.
---
I don't think you understand socialism, free market, or even economics for that matter as it relates to this fictional world. 
---
There is limited upwards mobility in a socialist system, ie only a select few can have super expensive things because there is no way to reach the upper tier of earning potential. You are partly correct here, but only in the explicit context of total cap amount. They are not restricting items, just the total amount of money you get to buy things. This is happening right now in the real world with things like interest rates, etc. The Feds decide how to regulate stuff so that there isn't too much money just floating around. If they didn't, anyone could charge anything for any item. 
---
In a free market, eventually there is a way to get what you want if you put the effort in but the cost of what you might want is still linked closely with a finite resource (money). 
---
But the economy is quite different for each. What is really at play here isn't socialism or capitalism. It is inflation. If Bethesda were to raise the limit, that would be effectively like the government printing more money. With more money, all prices would eventually go up.
---
Now that being said, npc vendors have a much higher cost than most player vendors. The going rate for most stuff has gone down due to supply and demand. So while I think that the current limit is technically a bit low for "groceries" (I think if the limit was higher player prices would climb towards the npc vendors) it would not solve the problem with high cap items. It would just inflate prices of normal stuff to where people would just get things like ammo the hard way.
---
But I totally agree with you about not buying over priced junk. How are you connecting caps with atoms though? That's the one thing I'm not making a connection on. I don't think casuals would spend more time in a game where grindy hard to get stuff gets harder to get. I think people would just stop playing.
---
How about losing some weight? Their has to be some negative impact otherwise why even have a weight limit to begin with.
---
This. 200+ killed me when I was afk  and naked. It's pathetic. Just wait until I'm high level (86 atm) all you douche lords will DIE. I'll be Fallout Spider Lady.
---
i loled by all the reviews that said, this game is shit i played 3 hours, what a waste of time
---
Edited them in on the bottom. Took a bit, had to make sure I didn't accidentally give any tips ;)
---
i think they were like well it's an online game who cares if it's rushed
---
the community burned them down but between all that they saw a bunch of people that want games and play more fallout, so the long term deal got even more sense
---
The reason people make "dramatic" leaving posts is because they *care*.
---
They care about the game and the franchise and have every right to express themselves.
---
That made my day. :)
---
I’m sorry I was asleep. I’ll have a a look if I have gotten them in a second. Tough I do think the codes would be gone anyway since they reset every week
---
I cant either, can do radshield but not radx.
---
Hey do you still know the places where they drop in savage divide if so can you PM me
---
i saved his comment just in case
---
I love this game but i just got on board. Mmo never launch well and this one kinda shat the bed.
---
A lot of complaints have nothing to do with the game like bags/rum/refunds ect.
---
Like most time i wait a while for dlc or price drop and i got all of that couple weeks ago. Straight up if the game had launched like it is today would have been so much better. But then again you got ppl that are never going to like it cause "no human npc" . man they are the ones missing out. I found two robots stuck in a loop asking each other questions haha sat there for 10 min listening to them.
---
Serverhoping hour to get only dead cave critkets at unncany caverns, to don't make fucking stupid daily challenge. To the fucker who killed them all: I HOPE YOU DIE ON SCORCHED PLEAGUE!!
---
Yeah there are mooooore annoying shit in this game,.....
---
I can
---
Stop being a horder Lol. Im never over weight and have like 7 weapons four pa and 2 regular armor sets. Sell the stuff you dont use, it will be ok to let stuff go i promise
---
I see most of the people that hate on this game have never even played it. The internet loves to hate something. Sure it has its bugs and they can get rather frustrating but I still love this game and it's only getting better.
---
Lets have a look at Fallout4: You have the same impact of weight on your character. But there is a perk, where you can fast travel overloaded and one where you don’t slow down. Perhaps this could be a solution?
---
But in reality I think they didn’t include this to make money somehow :(
---
I don't know about bringing formula P, but shutting down the robots which will allow the main friendly robot to administer Formula P to the friendly animals is the best thing to do after starting the event. This allows the friendly animal's health to regenerate after each attack wave.
---
No matter what he says or how much he apologizes or whatever new content he adds to the game that's fun the YouTubers will make a lot of videos on it because it makes them money.
---
I use to use it but I've collected so much of the stuff I just sell it off, that and it suppresses your mutations. Got to top of the world ski resorts you can probably walk out of the place with 20 of them just picking them up
---
I think I can’t craft any of them lol. But my luck is that I never find any recipes or plans so 🤷🏻‍♀️ maybe I’m not playing enough. 😆
---
I usually see them for 4c. 2c is a good price and should sell quick
---
Aw man I wish I was on PC so I could give it a shot. I'd be a Scanner for sure lmao
---
This is such a neat idea!!
---
f76 improved the game in lots of way instead of good looking graphics, the point of this game are the height distant objects, the masssive structures, and the ability to build everywhere some camp.
---
from what we saw for elder scroll is that they added those landscapes scan thingy to the engine, they are always improving.
---
I thought he handled it extremely well. I’m betting that beginning with E3 we start to see some sort of rebranding of Fallout 76, likely revolving around Wastelanders. 
---
It’s easy to say that Bethesda should’ve done this, that or the other thing—but it’s also incredibly naive. There was no way this game was coming out without a cloud of controversy. The bugs, the bags...those things didn’t help either, but controversy was inevitable. 
---
As for the “What it will become” thing...well, what else is he supposed to say? How do you release a game that’s specifically designed to evolve based on what players want and NOT wait to see what it becomes? It should’ve been in better shape at launch, but it was always going to evolve. The important thing is that we can see that Bethesda is doing that and seem to be keeping community feedback at the front of what they’re doing.
---
I'll be wearing my Grognak outfit and have my big axe in hand wink wink nod nod
---
I'm always overweight I bust out the xcavator and equip black diamond pop a buffout and then change my perkcards like batteries included, hiker, bandolier, pharmacy then travel
---
i think there was a massive communication problem with this game.
---
beth was like: yeah imagine f4 but with friends in another good looking map
---
people: OMG OMG F5 AND ONLINE OMMMGGGG
---
and beth didn't deny it and stop the hype like "no it's not f5, don't you see it's called 76 for a reason it's just a light f4 with online things to play with friends fk off kid, it's not the second coming of jesus or something, calm down and it will be bugged because we dind't make this before.
---
tatos selling at 2 per makes cobbler farm lucrative enough to pay the fast travel fee I bet. hmm I will have to experiment.
---
i know im late but this made my day, thank you
---
I like this game been playing since the end of beta. I just hate how they shoehorned the story into the fallout world. I'm just waiting for the surprise ending when they tell everyone that the time line is actually farther ahead closer to fallout 3, and no one bothered to go to this area becuase of the scorch plague.
---
Always running out of screws,
---
To me it would be great if the take the weight limit off of fast traveling. I don't mind paying the caps. They want you to build things what does the weight have to do with anything... I know about maybe servers crash but i thinks it's crap .
---
Both OPs and your ideas are fantastic!  I would definitely participate in something like this.
---
Weight management is like a minigame in how you play and build your character. I like it the way it is. I rock out ready for combat at 80 to 100 pounds. only loot certain things , and steady bump that capstash limit. just hoarding everything should not be a viable strategy in my opinion it would invalidate half of the perk cards avaidible.
---
Does this affect events? Should my low level character avoid events if there are higher levels participating?
---
Yea best for flux farming or making some Berry mentats or Dilbert sunshine
---
A little of everything. 
---
If memory serves it was only possible in certain sections of the game where a steady stream of enemies is thrown at the human partners, and they'd have to opt in to it anyway. 
---
You'd spawn as a certain kind of zombie and try to ambush them but the mechanics weren't really complex enough to make that possible. Usually you'd just die like an ordinary enemy and have to run back and try again. The asymmerty made it tedious to respawn and personally could only hold my attention for so long.
---
One camp NE of the top of the world, I think it's called the sludge hole, is guaranteed to spawn 3 toads. From then on it's just luck as to whether or not you get one
---
I don’t have any mutations and I use  a disease cure every time  I get   a disease. (I don’t have a  disease)
---
I rock a bloodied rifleman/sneaky commando build. I can one shot almost anything that isn't a scorchbeast/sheep squatch and I don't use explosive weapons. Not as OP as most melee builds but I like not being contained in PA all the time lol
---
The enclave doctor doesn't sell the recipe for it I've checked constantly so that's place is out
---
Okay for sure thank you mate!
---
Since you can run for a short time while overencumbered, I don't understand why they don't have a similar inferior version of fast travel. How about you can fast travel at double the cap cost? Maybe only to train stations? Easy solution. Until I managed to lose enough carry weight to fast travel, I had to rely on auto walking or, more recently, getting lucky with nukashine

great for anything pve - sucks at pvp - this is my favorite build but its built around vampiric laser gat. I can face tank the queen and the entire bog but not good at pvp at all being power armor dependent and all - however mobility is amazing with jetpack marsupial and birdbones, I love power armor, and I do not have to gather lead and steel for ammo, no gathering wood for cooking because I eat melons, I only use super stimpacks and sell all the rest. I hardly ever use superstimpacks though the vampire laser gat and healing factor combine to keep me permahealed for 99% of my gameplay with no meds, with sunkissed I use hardly any radaway, the only time I have to get out of my armor and do anything survival related is to repair my weapon.  the catch cause theres always a catch - I have to take workshops for fusion cores which leaves me vulnerable for pvp which I suck at and the odd person takes advantage of from time to time. I get ganked about once every couple days farming fusion cores. it only costs 50 caps and since that's the only downside to this build for me I don't even get salty I just relog and retake another shop on a different server.

Gametag RoaringAnemone6, but my hours are random as I have a strange work schedule, level 77.
---
I wore the white wolf fedora I got from the fake sheepsquatsh event. 
---
You can probably wear any hat names as a fedora.
---
You can turn off notifications for a daily quest by unmarking it while it's active. At least that seems to have worked for me
---
Holy fuck, the  TSE nerf. Every ten posts you'd find somebody's goddamn eulogy
---
Atom shop
---
There are a few skins you have to get in the atom shop for it I know of. I think there may be an Arktos pharma skin that gets dropped from the project paradise event too.
---
I tried with the "battered fedora", "crumpled fedora" and "dirty fedora" and none of them worked.
---
Might be fun, but it would have to be its own mode. Many of us play pve specifically because we don't like pvp. The AI in this game is pretty braindead, but I'd rather fight that than some scorched hopping back and forth around a corner like a meth addict
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmx6ev/backpacks_apart_from_the_skin_in_the_atom_store/

These are the two skins you can get in game, the rest are in the atom store.

Rest easy friend. We’ll continue to conquer the Wasteland in your honor.
---
He was near the lakeside cabins all day yesterday. Was funny cause ppl were fighting over the workshop for the weekly and he's just going on about his brahman lol.
---
I run mutations which Radx suppresses so I stash it and sell it. I eat radaway and use the perk sun kissed, and wear power armor in the field. no idea how to craft it.
---
The game isn't free to play.
---
That's it I'm quitting..fucking griefers griefed me before I even turned on my console or got out of bed.
---
I'd like this, but I'd also not want to know what my camp was rated.
---
I started a new alt last week and I've been in 2 rad storms.
---
Beautiful, eerie but sooooo immersive :)
---
Alright sounds good
---
good rant just let it out /pat /pat
---
But nowhere near as good! Standard Nuka heals as much as stims, but instantly and with no "cast animation", not to mention the AP recovery. Cherry is a super stim on steroids and even more AP.  Quantum is a full heal and AP refresh.
---
Oh and did I mention grape? 600 health and 1200 rad removal without any of the downsides of rada way!
---
They're never going to give it up. It doesn't matter how good the game gets, there will always be people that are incapable of forgiving certain things. Which sucks, cause they're missing out on a fun game. 
---
It'll never be New Vegas 2, and loud chunk of the internet wont be happy until Bethesda makes that.
---
So much of the negativity surrounding 76 is just pent up rage at the direction Fallout has gone, and the inability to see anything that Bethesda does with the franchise as positive. 
---
Don't get me wrong, there are some legitimate issues with 76. But even if the game was technically perfect, a lot of people would answer with some snarky bullshit and then go suck New Vegas' long-chapped schlong. New Vegas is one of my favorite games, but it feels like praising it is step two in a 'How to prove you're not a normy' guide. Step one is giving The Witcher 3 a rim-job. 
---
Every entry in the Fallout franchise is good for different reasons, and if people would rather circle-jerk the same shit over and over again instead of enjoying something new and interesting, then fuck 'em. They're gonna do what they're gonna do. 
---
I just want to play fun games. 76 is fun.
---
Apalachia. Seriously, they can pop up anywhere. I got 4 at Sunnytop Ski Lanes last night. Higher population of enemies does tend to mean a higher chance of finding them but the more obvious places like Whitespring can be harder to farm because everyone is at it. You can get some good results from doing a horde event and keeping the boss alive but I believe this only works in the higher level areas.
---
You could sell screws for more. I haven't had any trouble shifting them at 5 caps each, and they're pretty light so the stash cost is low. I can understand dumping springs for vendor price though.
---
Original xbox.
---
Can you show us your build ? Please
---
I have seen so many people trying to sell Ultracite legs, arms and torsos for hundreds each.
---
\+1
---
I had a dedicated 2h melee build that hated Power Armor but needed it because of Nuke Zones.
---
I started a VAT/Sniper alt... still not using PA lol unless I'm in a Nuke Zone...
---
Ill be on tomorrow just message me when you want to play
---
Happened to me too, pain in the bum
---
Check out player vendors. That's where I finally found mine
---
Yeah, have a few bits
---
Shoot, I'm the type of player that goes "SQUIRREL!!" ar other games from time to time.  I'm constantly leaving and coming back.  
---
Just without the dramatic exit.
---
Add me although I’m in AZ. GT: TMG Ebandz
---
How may alts do you have then ?
---
Im level 120, never made another character.. never felt i needed to
---
It works! Go for it :)
---
Some ya. You can hang out but if a high lvl comes the mobs may be too hard for you to kill. But you can always help and be ready with stims.
---
I find the forest events are all ez no matter your lvl except pharma one... That one is tough.
---
... Well, yeah, you DID use an aimbot. it's called VATS.
---
Their constent screaming really disorients you to your surrounding and blurs your aiming. Which I find more irritating. Scorchbeast I just hate how their scream tears apart your armor.
---
The Grafton Monsters there definitely hit level 40. I also found a whole pack of level 50 Mirelurk Kings near Clarksburg once, but I suspect that was some sort of random event spawn. Most other stuff seems to stay below 25.
---
The Rusty Pick and Burning Mine in the Ash Heap appear to be uncapped, which feels more like a bug.
---
I probs have a spare white wolf hat you can **borrow** to knock the challenge over if you’re on xbox, lol
---
I still play the game even though I can't start the BOS questline so cant turn in technical data for rewards or get a free ultracite armor. Luckly I was able to find all the plans I wanted through player vending
---
If they'd kept the "overencumbered does damage to your legs" that FO4 Survival mode had, people would NEVER be overencumbered.
---
Nope
---
It's almost laughable how hard /r/Fallout is egging this interview, it's like night and day.
---
I for one am  very glad they're continuing to shape this game into something great, multiplayer Fallout is something I've always wanted and I can't be more happy with the people I've met along the way, bugs n' all.
---
Is your punch bowl black???
---
I got mine for a couple hundred caps and it's been better than some of the legendaries
---
I'm kinda happy with the way things are. Don't get me wrong, more is always better in this case, but right now my camp is fairly swank ([for a reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw69bk/what_i_learned_running_a_find_the_vault_boy_game/)), and my stash is full but not impossibly full.
---
Junkies build will be my next, idk what weapon type yet though.   Might go pistol for a challenge
---
You've insulted me multiple times over that convince option, dude.
---
What would actually happen is cheaters would turn in crazy amounts of dupped gear, to make "perfect" items, dupe them until bethesda nerfs that set, and so on down the fucking list.
---
Strategy that worked for me was to go up to the momument, travel to the civil war cemetary, then server jump and repeat. 
---
Lots of times.
---
Yea i dont pay more than 800 caps total for anything. Most people try to sell the good legendaries for 2-5k and thats a rip off. Never pay more that 1k for a legendary.
---
You’ve blown this a little out proportion and now you’re misspelling things days later. Let it end pal
---
Thank you but I'm on PS4. Should be fine. Just curious why white wolf is the only one that seemingly works. Indy is more of the "dirty fedora"
---
Dragon Queen ? I think you stumbled into the wrong subreddit doode. This ain't Skyrim ;P
---
Agreed. I use mine all the time with the recon scope and hardened receiver and shit gets done in a hurry.
---
I didn’t play for about three months.  Not because I didn’t like the game, but because real life was too busy. Two kids playing little league; Exhausting. I took a break after I found myself falling asleep trying to play. Lol. 
---
But anyways. I also got bored with reddit and Beth forum because I got sick of all the people bitching about a game they didn’t even play anymore or at all. 
---
Now we are left with those that stuck with it or are starting fresh and the community(s) have gotten so much better. 
---
It’s like why do I want to hear from someone who basically belittles anyone who actually likes the game for what it is, despite the flaws? It’s downright annoying. Difference of opinion is one thing, but things got plain ridiculous. Idiots claiming we can’t possibly be a real Fallout fan if we have anything good to say about a game we enjoy. 
---
It took until my third character to stop playing this game like Fallout 4. It’s hard to stop being a hoarder. And those of us who liked Fallout 4 also weren’t real Fallout fans unless you like NV. Oh and before that anyone who liked Fallout 3, because it suddenly has 1st and 3rd shooter aspect, then they weren’t legit either. It’s a tale as old as Fallout Universe has existed. The next game everyone will bitch about too. And Elder Scrolls Too. 
---
I love Skyrim, but I can already see the crazy expectations people will demand and bitch about. And no matter what they try to do, people will hate it and love it. And of course the haters are much more vocal. I do hope though, that Bethesda learns from this and properly beta tests the next TES and FO5. It’s frustrating yes, but I absolutely learn from my mistakes best. So Bethesda should really have a good list of what not to do stuff by now.
---
Sell what people will buy
---
Marketing 101
---
I’ve seen... One person, actually wearing Ultracite, and that was recently
---
Oh yes. Auto correct is a "spelling mistake" now. And why? You just keep insulting me, over nothing. I log in, you've said more nonsense, why exactly should I not reply?
---
There’s one on a skeleton just down from the vault. If you head down to the right from vault entrance. There’s also a fossil there so you can get fossil photo at the same time.
---
I said it days ago. You’re acting just plain weird now. See ya
---
So, as Long as you get a shot in you get the loot even if they detonate themself yes ?
---
Yet again. Bullshit from you ends up in my inbox, I reply to it. That's significantly less weird than your nonsense "everyone who sells ammo is a scam artist" viewpoint.
---
Then what skin to get gold I feel would say hey I'm a wee bit richer than you but then the silver shouts I'm not quite rich enough to buy the gold one.
---
😆
---
I liked the multiple coloured one from the nuka cola dlc in for.
---
they arent trying to be cool, they are farming for junk and it only costs them ~35 caps to check your pockets.
---
I didn’t say everyone but you also said you’re selling it for 2 caps per shell lmao let it go dude you look bad enough
---
Then when you beat them they say you are hacking or cheating and get even more pissed they like being on a power trip and if you destroy it they cry
---
&gt;in hope you will return
---
wrong. hes just paying the caps to claim the workshop so he can kill you once while you are offguard and take your junk.
---
Damage repair depends on the rank, so if you have perk rank 1 damage repaired will be small. Having said that, I never actually checked condition before and after. I just assume it works:)
---
I've sold them at 2 per shell, which is the default price, shocker. People should feel absolutely horrible for selling ultra-light blueprints for 500 too, I bet? We should just list everything at 0. I bet you list everything at zero dontcha buddy. 
---
And you...keep replying to me. If I look bad, you look worse. You think this conversation is "crazy" yet...you're continuing it.
---
OK I heard this rumor too and was running with a friend that has it, he was under the impression that it was working because he kept getting the proc notification, but since I told him I heard it was bugged he started checking his weapons health after the proc notifications hit and his weapon health was not rising. This leaves me with 2 questions.
---
1. is it bugged or maybe you have to have junk on you for it to work? 
---
2. would weapon artisian affect how well it repairs itself?
---
"just wait 18 days, its not hard" 
---
bruh
---
I’m continuing to be amused and amazed yes lol. I didn’t say anyone should feel like the Antichrist for obvious overcharging but that it is overcharging
---
I think the spawning is related to the users, and if the number changes during the event it screws everything up.  
---
I’ve had it going great, spawning like crazy and someone new arrived and it shut down immediately, as well other times  I’ve changed rooms and found groups around the spawn.
---
Im usually on alot of the time my gt:Travis party181
---
if you need to get someone to shoot you while in it, that works too - youll still be mostly in water and available for the revive easily enough.
---
Yeah, your bullshit's amusing me too. That's the only reason I reply when I see a message from you in my inbox. 
---
And, no. 2 caps per is the going rate that the vast majority of people who sell shells  are charging. It's a rare day that I see them in a camp for 1. Charging the going rate isn't overcharging, dude. 
---
This is like you flipping your shit for multiple days over, say, someone charging $1 for a candy bar, because you want it for free.
---
so weapon artisian affects it you say?
---
Urban scout armor faceplate is pretty dope looking but i cant find a hat that will work with it.
---
This! They don’t cause me too many problems killing them, but the noise is just the worst thing ever
---
I ran it again after I made this post and some deer were spawning in the stairwell by the computer where you initiate the event. We got a grand total of 12 venison into the feeder.
---
i used to use it. for me id get the notification that it was activating then sometimes i wouldnt. but even when it didnt give the notification it worked sometimes id notice my weapon a little less broken than before
---
Ive been hanging out in dark corners near players camps wearing the steel workers uniform and a sack hood scaring the shit out of people though. Lol the combo is pretty creepy looking.
---
lol he made your girlfriend a pile of meat...
---
At least you GOT to fight them in the first place. Ever since the Scouts made their debut I have been unsuccesfull at finding one of them to snap a Picture for the challenge no matter how long i kept lurking in the mire (pun intended) :P
---
Me too. I made a post about this earlier asking what went wrong.
---
oh not in a good way like someone buying all your stuff I take it. I havent had that issue but I dont really server hop so /shrug.
---
Shut the fuck up Thomas
---
Don’t think it does. I have both, but only equip weapon artisan when i’m repairing my weapons. But then again, never checked stats before and after luck of the draw got applied during a fight.
---
So you see other people overcharging and feel free to overcharge as well. Also nobody here is even mildly perturbed but you. You seem quite upset.
---
I did about 50 of the camp fire event and only got 1 badge. It was the only time it didn’t showed up as event completed. I gave up and just got them the hard (easier) way.
---
You can't break stairs or foundations...
---
This happened to me but I just waited around for a bit and then I got the loot.
---
Aais sought after. It would be worth more if explosive.
---
I think you could easily get 4k from it. If not more depending on who sees your post. Just put it up for offers starting at 4 or 5k and see where it goes
---
I’ve had mine in my vending machine for 450 for about a week and it hasn’t sold. Running out of stash so trying to get rid of my heavy stuff cheap.
---
I remember the first time I was leveling, I went into &gt;!Uncanny Caverns. Apparently, if you follow through it to the end, listening to all the audio buttons, it spawns a bunch of shit on you as you try to leave.!&lt; In my case, it spawned 4 Mirelurk Kings fighting a bunch of dogs. I got out quick as I could... and exactly one followed.
---
It was twice my level.
---
I had a sniper build.
---
I was not stealthed.
---
What resulted was the longest solo fight I've had in this game, longer than the time three SB's attacked my camp. I backpedaled for a solid 5 minutes, dragging it around and around one of those tiny double sided postboards. I had to stop, pop it one in the head with a hunting rifle (and eventually a 10mm pistol when I ran out of .308) then watch for the spit attack animation and block LOS with the board. If I *didn't* let it spit at me, if I went around too soon, it would instead charge me (faster than I could backpedal) and hit me for about a third of my health. I blew through every stimpack and most of my ammo, and was down to about 25% health when the GD thing died.  
---
TL;DR Fuck Mirelurk Kings.
---
I wouldn’t list it for more than 2500 unless you want it to sit in your vending machine for a while. If you want to list high, remove all mods and take advantage of the weight reduction while it’s in your stash.
---
I sell level 50 ones for around 150 caps
---
&gt; I think there may be an Arktos pharma skin that gets dropped from the project paradise event too.
---
There is. I got it the first time I finished that event.
---
I sell a lot of things very cheap but 1k is an extremely low cap depending on what you’re selling.
---
Nah, your self importance is amusing, is all. Who, exactly, are you that your view on what is, and is not, an "acceptable" price? 
---
Fallout set the price to 2 caps per. Most people sell at 2 caps per, and people happily buy at 2 caps per. 
---
Being angry at people for selling at the going rate is just a freaky level of delusional self importance.
---
I’m a reddit user and I stopped. No drama.
---
Those are all good roles so it’s definitely worth a few k, for super high value though you want to be getting an explosive in there for sure, anti armor exploding and bloodied exploding are what it’s all about!
---
I feel all black powder has excellent damage at range if you are aiming down sights. Look at the range stats they are ridiculous. Vats is the variable for close and medium range. Ether way the dragon is a beast! Especially be with a unyielding, rifleman and demolition build. Even if they have fireproof and asbestos a be dragon can be in the high 2,000 low 3,000 range in damage. Even with the explosive nerf I feel the dragon is competitive in both pvp and pve. If you're pve you probably want a instigating. Pvp you probably want be, tse, executioner. It really helps if you dedicate your build for it. Or at least go all 9 in rifleman. If you build for it  most weapons will kill pvp or pve in one or two hits. The question is DO YOU WANT TO RUN A MAN'S GUN OR DO YOU WANT TO RUN A pew pew laser rifle?
---
PS4
---
Yeah makes perfect sense, knew it was a fairly decent roll but could have been a lot better :(
---
It's the same, only other colors and name.
---
I always add green thumb in to my loadout when going in to a nuke zone so that I can spend less time foraging for flux, hadn’t really considered these benefits though...
---
It crashes people's games.  Mostly why I stopped doing it.  Another reason we need a PTR
---
Yeah still a very good roll though, we’re all just hoping that we manage to get one of those amazing rolls that can sell for 20k, honestly I don’t know how people get those rolls, I’m level 80 and I’ve never got anything like that haha
---
I wear it (still missing the right arm) and I really like it. Together with my axe I am unkillable ;)
---
That event is still on yea. You just have to go into the basement to trigger it
---
Sadly i see people on my servers listing 1 and 2 star variants for those kinds of prices. Usually i find anything that's actually useful is upwards of 7k. Just my experience though.
---
Damn XB1
---
Question from a returning player:
---
How the hell do I get one?
---
It's worth it just get weapon artisan. Gotta pay to play  lol
---
I'm level 98 and this is my first semi-decent roll, only other decent stuff i have is from player vendors. I just saved up 800 scrip and bought 8 3 stars and crossed my fingers.
---
I think the problem (it happened to me twice already) is the situation when you can't place the camp in the world. I have that prompt and ignored it (thought I don't need my camp at the moment) and played for some time, while I should switch the world to another server. After logging later on another server my vendor machines were empty.
---
The in game value is little more than a balance for the buying and selling between npc characters and the player. You’re genuinely just setting prices based on what the game sets automatically? Smh
---
And as a returning player I baught the full set (right arm still missing) for around 2k.
---
Luckly I made 5 K by selling all my ammo
---
If you're feeling lucky this took place on the bridge south of the southern belle motel. I was wandering around trying to find the mire treasure map 3 location. They ambushed me as soon as I left the road.
---
Sorry. Keep your eyes open for the plans or guns, in player shops, they are out there.
---
if you science that for me I give you many upvotes.
---
Completely random seperate question but you wouldn't happen to also know the sought after effects on legendary gatling plasmas? roll'd a few of those too. Also do people generally use vats with them at all?
---
should be easy to port the one from fallout 4's far harbour DLC... maybe they'd do it in the wastelanders DLC wave
---
Those prices are ridiculous. I’m near max caps and I wouldn’t spend that kind of money unless it was something really worth it. As a seller, it’s easy to hit max caps if you list things at reasonable prices.
---
It’s actually slightly stronger besides the chest piece.
---
Whilst killing a lvl10 is a bit of a dick thing to do... you do get a clear message when taking a workshop that it can start pvp, and with the changes to adventure mode being as this is the only real way to have pvp you’ve gotta be wary taking workshops!
---
Been getting a lot of ambushes when claiming work shops. I've been told by my PvP friends these are the weak guys who fail miserably in the PvP world so they go to Adventure to ambush non-PvP players.
---
Other than legacy Exosive ones I'm not super sure.
---
Propbaly 2 shot and bloodied. Some people might want AA but I don't think it works on energy weapons.
---
As for the second effect I'd think faster fire rate or 10% dmg while aiming.
---
And maybe dmg resist while reloading or RW for third
---
I am a heavy gunner myself but have never used vats, I'm not sure how well they work on a heavy gun. But I have not seen many vat heavy gun come up on the market
---
Yeah exactly not to mention anything sitting there unused will just get thrown out to make more space in the future, even selling it for 1 cap is more worth it. Not to mention someone might actually get to use it and enjoy the item instead of it sitting there as a line of text in your stash.
---
Yeah, like anticipating some random cretin would teleport there and kill you for 10 screws.
---
It isn't about being inaccessible to you, it's about what's inaccessible to the blueprint system. The system needs to be able to trace its way through your structures so there always needs to be a dependancy between connections that can break the link. Removing a staircase is nothing to you, but to the blueprint system it can mean a floor of your build not getting recorded.
---
It’s crazy but they really would, they’d probably kill you for nothing other than the fact that they just can
---
If they've got a hundred plus bounty then sure, but people with a 5 cap bounty normally have it by mistake.
---
The hoarder mentality is hard to break for previous bethesda title players used to infinite space. It's scary how small the percentage is of items I actually use compared to what I carry. I'd be curious how low a player could get his CW if he truely got rid of everything he doesn't use.
---
I think this was a bad call, I did a lot of scorched earth back in the day and only ever got two recipe plans, they were fairly rare - it would take a LOT of grinding to get them all from drops. So when they were talking about adding more to her loot pool, they just removed the most rewarding item drop and instead made jetpack plans way more common, I don't see how this was an improvement. All it did was make the jetpack plans completely worthless, I'm dumping them off in droves now as well as anyone else that does scorched earth a lot, but yet I still see people selling them and ultracite piece plans for ridiculous amounts at practically every camp vendor I go to, which is just lulz worthy if you even have a modicum of knowledge about end game content. Definitely a step backwards, at the very least they should have just made them more rare than they already were, but alas.
---
Thanks. I'll give it a try. Im just glad the challenge also accepts photos of dead creatures. That way I dont have to fumble around with the camera while the bugger is screaming and clawswiping at me XD
---
Maybe I'm a fool but I was moved by his interview. 
---
The E3 crowd last year during the announcement was rough. So I'm positive they really saw how people were going to feel about it. 
---
But I love when he mentioned the community because he knows there are loyal players. 
---
&gt;"it’s not how you launch, it’s what it becomes,” 
---
Is the line that keeps my faith stronger in this game.
---
Well I for one sure wish I knew what you were talking about.
---
Apparently, the initial place you put your CAMP, will always be the spawn point for fast travel visitors (Not yourself), it never moves
---
I'm pretty they never heard this concept at the atom shop marketing team. Otherwise we would have handmade,shotgun,powerfist and so on skin..
---
Another benefit of that Location is that Grahm passes by there rather frequently. 
---
And Cargobot convoys aswell. Wich is the reason I left the top quite bare to have a platform from wich to shoot em down efficiently.
---
Seen him legendary once. Also seen s legendary insult bot. Unlike Grahm he can be killed, so I killed him and got a legendary weapon.
---
You had to be there i guess
---
I firmly believe the internet is the window to ones soul, how we act in public and around other people has consequences and thus we modify our behavior, here blanketed in anonymity and lacking in repercussions people's true colors are exposed. It is one of the reasons that the older I get the more skeptical of people I get.
---
These requests are getting wierder and wierder 😁
---
I like that. You know what, you're right.
---
I hear you lol - got 4.8k and still waiting for something nice.
---
White springs used to be great because the robots would protect you (fending off enemies) and the hotel has a great amount of crafting / trading stations.
---
Especially aluminium early game. You can set it to tell you what has it in the crafting menu and a little magnifying glass will appear next to anything in the world that does. It’s crucial in the early game for almost everything
---
Incorrect - Any 2\* can (potentially) have the "Powered" Legendary effect, the AP refresh effect.
---
Anytime I see someone with like 15+ in the armor category I assume it’s Cecilas
---
Tbh, I think you all should be spread out across the map by 2s. So you can fast travel but that's if you dont care about paying the caps!
---
Yeah because the beta was linked to buying the game. So technically it was part of the game
---
Nice
---
First two i killed but after that i said f.ck it and left them for others.
---
Seen him about half dozen times, he never had anything of interest. Unless someone sold it to him.
---
This was not serios ofc, I am glad, I can spend my life playing this game, but it would be cool, if bethesda actualy made challenges someway better.
---
Get a good knife and go bloodied sneak with unyielding armor. It will change your game totally.
---
Oh god the amount of people that have raged at me or shot at me because I wouldnt sell/give them my tse gauss rifle is insane.
---
You want to trade fine but don't get all pissy if I say a certain weapon or piece of armor is not for sale.
---
I did eventually sell it a few days ago in my vending machine for 2.5k after I switched to a heavy gunner build running a gatling gun/50.cal build(could have got a crapload more for it but I'm not a greedy person)
---
I have also heard they can drop from Sloths. The other source mentioned is treasure maps. This info is second hand though.
---
Came here to say this
---
Been gaming since 96, every MMO has had a disastrous launch. every, single. one. its so many variables that a room of devs and nerds cannot possibly prefactor every single outcome. back then you-tubers either didn't exist or had 0 to small amounts of influence. now they have too many sheeples and too much sway. I have some concern for future games development. the big games industry can do things that indies just cant, they take it to a whole different level. what bethesda did with 76 was a bold attempt at something very different from the current crop of games on the market. the youtuber crowd was just brutal to them, I don't know the longterm effects this will have on bethesda or the gaming industry but the you-tubers need to chill the fuck out or they're going to work themselves out of a job. when the gaming industry just shuts down or becomes so generic there's nothing on the market worth playing they might have to actually try and produce their own content instead of armchair quarterbacking and bitching like a bunch of depraved cunts.
---
You act like they care about the screws.
---
"Find the Vault Boy" sounds so suss. Do you also try to lure people in with candy?
---
I found a miss nanny who told me the story of hansel and gretal and how the witch got thrown in the oven because she didnt have a general atomics ms nanny to do it for her.
---
So because we do not know what happened and we only have one side I would say "it is just a video game"
---
But wouldn’t any other legendary effect take over in the naming? I’ve seen lots of things have the AP refresh, but I thought you only see it named powered if it has the “8% less damage from players” which normally would make it assassins.
---
Learn how to use paragraphs dude. I'm not reading that.
---
A few days ago, right after I logged in at my camp, my first ever rad storm rolled in. I got some pics too. Made me happy : )
---
It's never going to be enough, is it?
---
This is mostly business practice. Look at most of the triple a games and you will see a pattern. They just call it games as a service now instead of early access ;)
---
This is a really cool idea and very expandable but i feel like in a game already famous for bugs i could see some serious issues with loading in a queue of X number of fodder players to one location (obviously enough fodder for it to actually feel like a realistic fallout encounter) with whatever non fodder players you're fighting. Deffinetly huge crashing issues and so much backlash for bethesda it would hurt the game more than it helps. Sounds like one of those good theory bad practice situations for sure
---
I managed to get the dense combat armor plan from the BoS vendor in Watoga, but it only appears sometimes, so youre gonna have tk server hop a lot of times to buy it.
---
problem is you could get all set of plans downloaded for free from Taggerty's terminal in Fort Defiance...
---
Go back to fort defiance, take the elevator to the 4th floor and go into tagerdys office and on the computer is the full set of plans. Like the x01 in the enclave.
---
Go to any railway station and look for a notice board with posters on it. Should be three there to click on that start quests. The scout one will lead to the backpacks.
---
Maybe eventually it could work
---
I don't care the screws, it's the unfair situation. In adventure mode we are supposed to "re-build Appalachia"... not to kill one another. If you want PvP go to survival mode... oh but I get it... those dipsh\*ts won't stand a chance against same lvl players.
---
Not every hero wears a cape.
---
Although it is a live service game and constantly changing... yeah it was pretty broken at launch. 
---
It is MILES better now! I’m actually enjoying my time! 
---
Also props to Bethesda for at least admitting “hey we F***ed up the launch”
---
How long ago did you get it? If you remember. I'm pretty sure that's been patched since now the vendors should have all the plans set 100% of thee time
---
I am glad they released it when they did. It was buggy a hell but I have been over all happy even since launch, if they had waited people would have complained they were taking to long. releasing early was A-OK in my book it let me get out there 1000 hours ago instead of it still being stuck in development stage. so no it was not messed up they released on a schedule they obligated themselves to and what they released was what they had. cupcake generation needs to understand that one does not simply poop out a game like this. it is a ton of variables to consider and the people who complain the loudest are also the ones to dumb to even consider what goes into it.
---
To be fair, you won't hear about normal exits because they don't say it. Like how I know you inhaled and exhaled while reading this but told nobody you did.
---
Is there any 'official' info about it? Some time before I've looted Adrenal reaction recipe and now, even though I do much more SBQ's runs I only getting useless jetpack plans, useless ultracite armor plans and some prime ones.
---
I bought the pre order, tried out the beta, it didn't run well so requested and got a full refund from Bethesda. Subsequently bought it again at a later date
---
Like about 2 weeks ago if memory serves me right. I saw someone talking about it somewhere else so I decided to try my luck to see if I could get it.
---
Thank you
---
well the leather dense plan popped up for me at the watoga vendor 2 days ago so there seems to still be some RNG on a few plans
---
Early Access doesn't charge full price and then go down from there.
---
Just picked up one of the dense plans (can’t exactly remember which) from a treasure map spot in the Bog
---
Okay can I go there even if I did not finish the main quest?
---
Hm. I'll have to give it a go, tha k you for the info
---
Nooooooo.
---
Damn it but I have not finished the main quest so it is okay
---
I’ve been looking for fixer planes on my second character.. found one on my 3rd attempt .. been to over 150 people’s camps on my 2nd and still haven’t found a level 50 or the plans.
---
So treasure maps might give something useful haha. Maybe I'll have to buy a bunch and go hunting
---
Thanks for the info
---
Hiding crouched with chameleon in a store room or toilet is the best option, if not leave workshop completely and only return sneaked for defense and harvesting after reconnaissance of area.
---
Yes i agree and this would probably be the smoothest way to fix this. 
---
Another way is to let us split merged cards. 
---
But Bethesda maybe wants us to keep on grinding til we've every possible perk card setup. Wonder how many lvls that'll take?
---
Junk is so hard to come by, I wouldn't bother.
---
Then look around steam. There are dozen of early access games that are in that phase for years.
---
Ark even released dlc while in early access
---
Problem with damage? Are you using Ninja perk card in your build?
---
lol exactly the response every asshole uses when treating people like crap on the internet. "aah its only everything you worked for for the past three hours, chill man its just a video game." true colors of being a cunt revealed. No matter how nice they are in public or how well they treat their friends and family and even strangers on the street. in a game, hidden from judgment and consequence their inner douchebag is release. they can piss people off and be the shitty person they've always wanted to be but are too chickenshit to show in real life. How you act when no ones watching is who you truly are.
---
I honestly don't care lol I'm just happy to be playing fallout
---
There is a big difference between admitting not a high meta critic game and admitting poor unfinished state. If you actually watch the video he states no online game has had a truly successful rating on release but it's what it will become and he stands by the continual improvemens supporting it long term. Taking things out of context to say its messed isn't really valid here
---
Plus, the loot you get for killing them is like a slap across the face.
---
What's your playstyle? 
---
If Bloodied can do a mixture of Unyielding and Bolstering (or all Bolstering i suppose). Which adds +35 DR per piece of armor the lower your health. Along with a Bloodied weapon ofcourse.
---
If you like high Health, then I'd suggest Vanguard (+35DR the higher your health) with Vampire weapon to ensure your health is always high and get the most out of your armor. Since losing just a tiny but if health would reduce that +35 immediately. 
---
As for perk cards, Barbarian under Strength has potentially +80DR, but note it only works without PA. 
---
Then their is another under Agility i believe, gives +45 DR potentially.
---
Hell, go all the way Plans we don't know.
---
Ehh, honestly, I'm usually one to agree with certain ideas being to buggy to implement, but the odds of suddenly spawning an encounter worth of dudes in one place at the same time crashing the game doesn't seem very likely. Nearly every time the SBQ fight happens I see 15ish dudes all arriving in short order, running around with hordes of varied AI mobs also spawning in and fighting all the while green lightning arcs overhead in a mushroom cloud.  
---
If that works alright I just can't imagine spawning 6-10 dudes as pre cached default raiders would break anything that wouldn't have already.
---
ugh as a professional loot pinata I can say with conviction that stealth melee is absurdly and stupidly strong. now upvote me , and if you see my power plant in game let me farm in peace dammit I just want the cores I am not built for pvp.
---
Sorry bout that I forgot to put I run Bloodied
---
I'll occasionally last a bunch with calibrated shocks for 1 cap each.  More often, I'll just leave em in a bag next to the punch bowl.
---
Yeah I’m at level 3 with a stealth blade combat knife (non legendary) but I’ve noticed anything that’s got high health wasn’t dying quick enough. I tried ambushing a super mutant that was away from his group and the sneak attack did maybe 1/10 of his health and he was around my level. I was detected shortly after and had to run. I think I only got 2-3 hits before he noticed me.
---
What can I say, no one was interested in my "let's make the double barrel shoot both barrels at once so it can be badass" proposal so this seems like the next logical step. :P
---
The problem is most builds I’m seeing are Bloodied or using 2h or unarmed weapons which aren’t proper stealthy. How have you fared against regular stealth builds? Aka non Bloodied.
---
Did something similar lately with steel worker uniform but wearing the yellow hard hat and a drill.
---
I'm the creepy wasteland Bob
---
Pacifist mode
---
You should've tried Norwegian.
---
And yeah I have both armors and perks but idk why dmg resists aren’t high like I have evasive 3 Barbarian 3 and I use 2 bolst 3 Unyielding and without the armord backpack I’m doing 404 Dmg Resist 360 energy Resist , I’ve seen people in the 500 without , I’m also using combat btw 3 heavy 2 light , chest is heavy
---
just level up and get once of each.
---
I primarily blamed it on the fact the event don't start/show on the mall until someone entered the elevator, and there is no indication if it is in the collection phase of waiting for someone to start.
---
Lol chill dude.
---
I never said that I would do something like this but if the game rules allows it then you know what could be happen.
---
It is like playing on a Pvp server in an mmo and then crying that you are getting ganked.
---
You know the rules and possibilities people can use then use your brain and think for 2 seconds what could happen in any situation.
---
You can not really lose something that you worked hours for here in fo76 so
---
1. get rid of unstable isotope and electrical charge - they are shit damage anyway and a group of small creatures can irradiate you to death. literally a horde of radrats will kill you with your own fucking perk. and you have seen how pvpers use it to grief with. 
---
2. if you already run vendors and a lot of workshops you probably already know how the budget system for them works . just in case you dont, if theyre green your using shop resources if they turn white they come out of yours, if you stay under budget server hopping is not a big deal, you will actually profit by retaking and rebuilding the workshops.
---
most of the times where u are using camilion armor where is still a red arrow over. fix dont use it a normal run sentinal poweret in pvp and where i sneak it normal not a problem
---
Powered, is a 2nd tier prefix/ title, just like Sentinals and Cavalier are 3rd tier.
---
I don't know the conditions/ rules that cause which prefix to be used. BUT if it has Powered in the title it will be a 2*, but, it can still potentially be "powered" or AP refresh without the Prefix if a 2*
---
What system? I'm on Xbox and I was actually looking to remove it from my stash as I never use it.
---
He watches a lot of CNN
---
Thank you... I was unaware of that mode.
---
I’m on PC. Sorry should’ve specified that.
---
I altered your build to be a little more effective. 
---
[vampires heavy energy build. ](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f116e8b&amp;d=sq2sr2s32id2c72lt2a12a72p10s12ic4ip2ls2cu0l71cr0a01s22sy0sx0eu0lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=Gatling%20laser%20lowcost&amp;m=f1c2e3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
I reduced endurance to 1 because diseases don’t matter. And used those points for class freak. Your negative mutations are far worse than any disease you could get. I added adrenaline reaction and radicool. Get radiated at 50% and you damage will be much higher as well as extra Carry weight. Added bear arms because Gatling lasers weigh 40lbs. Added adrenaline because it’s mandatory.  Took two away from tenderizer because of diminishing returns on damage. Added full change because when you get backed into a corner enemies will get in front of your barrel meaning you can’t hit anything. Got rid of healing factor as your weapon will keep you healed up and using chems is important late game. Got rid of blocker because it doesn’t matter how much damage you take because your weapon will put heal it and you got full charger to stagger the enemy  and reposition.  Also if you in a melee range and get hit that’s on you for being out of position. With marsupial and bird bones you shouldn’t be hit by any melee attack ever.
---
I could need some help too. 
---
PS4, crossdogfly, lvl55, I am at European time
---
I'd make them all heavy and  turn them to BoS, will add a bit more DR. 
---
If you do mutations, add grounded for +100 ER. 
---
Can also toss in IronClad for like +50 DR more. 
---
You always carry junk? Their is perk to add DR when carrying junk.
---
That's assuming you can spare all the points. 
---
Do you have serendipity? That should neglect 45% of all attacks on you. 
---
If you can get your hands on sentinel/cavalier legendary armor, you could also reduce attacks by up to 75% (75% of the time).
---
Yes but Ark didn’t charge a full price until its official physical release which was a few years after early access launch.
---
I carry ~20 radaways on me and about the same radx diluted.
---
I don't mena to necro this thread, but if you've never used an automatic Railway Rifle you should try it. It's fucking crazy hard to control, and does a TON of damage in VATS even in the bosy. It might be a good choice for high health targets like SBQ, where I typically struggle to contribute significant damage. A furious one would be ideal!
---
But they already do that. I'm pretty convinced that if we don't tell people what mobs are player controlled then most people wouldn't be able to tell what was a player trying something crafty, and what was the AI bugging out.  
---
I already have to chase mobs across the map, find mobs seemingly AFK, and even find mobs shooting at me from out of my render distance. What would be the notable difference? Unlike normal pvp it's not a fair fight, or even a significant challenge for you to win.  
---
What's the worst case scenario? I'm going to guess the player is a pure melee and the fodder is at a sniper position plinking at the player with a vinilla pipe rifle. the player can sprint, the player is prolly going to have a legendary upgraded weapon, the player is going to have perks, the player is going to have good upgraded armor, the player prolly has at least a dozen stimpacks, and the fodder won't have any of that. The player's got nothing to worry about, this is pve in everything but name.  
---
I'm a pve only player, I've never engaged in any pvp in this game since the idea of dueling one shot gods doesn't sound fun, but I can't think of how this would be significantly different than pve combat even against a well organized team of fodder players. They just don't present that much of a threat.
---
Not to mention you'll get full set of Ultracite PA for free upon finishing BoS questline...
---
Is it still 5 caps if you break someones base 10 if you steal there purified water
---
That might be why, you lose the Deep pocket bonus when getting in PA
---
Deep Pockets add 10 for each limb and 20 for torso (IIRC), so thats 60 that you lose when entering PA
---
Playing on ps4 and yes it mostly feel the same. You can adjust the sensitivity in the options
---
People so fucking entitled.
---
Mhhh damn, so then I have to finish all my quest. Really hate most of the quest be ause the are run to a go to b loot in c
---
Well, the game in general is a bit more stiff than Fallout 4. However, gunplay is still good. It’s overall more solid as a direct result of being slightly stiffer. I’d say it’s more comparable to somewhere between 3 and NV.
---
###(By the way, as a fair warning, V.A.T.S. doesn’t work the same way it used to. Just so you know before you try to use it.)
---
Plans and recipes, and shotgun ammo.
---
I know this goes against the current trend of friggin HUGE C.A.M.P.s and Vendors but I keep my camp at the bare minimum to heal/craft/repair everything. When I get seriously over encumbered I just bring my C.A.M.P. to me and unload what I need to in order to FT.  The. OST of moving my C.A.M.P. Equates to about 2 assault rifles, so if I am over by 4 assault rifles, then it makes “cap” sense to do this so I can put my C.A.M.P. back where I wanted it in the first place.
---
put them cheap in the player vendors, I do that and they go fast. I also go around the vendors doing the same thing.
---
But that is normally
---
The builds that seem to use power armour are mostly big guns/explosive. Everyone else seems to run around in light armour.
---
Have they fixed the story?
---
I miss how smart and challenging the npc's. Ghouls dodging bullets is about the scariest shit ever until you meet a deathclaw who does it even better.
---
If you really want one, I will gladly oblige. Add me IGN Geneziz
---
However I may be able to login after 6 hours.
---
You aren't the only one...
---
Better wait for Prestige Players in nuclear winter... restart that char
---
I dont think the blueprint is bothered about stairs, you can build mezzanine levels with no stairs or even build on your roof and they still get recorded.
---
Stairs aren't the problem, its when you can't remove parts of your floor or foundation -and i'm not talking about important bits like your 1st foundation or parts of floating bridge, i mean things like the entire upper floor of a basic 2x3 house (all of them not just the one top oif the stairs) or you put down a foundation and decide you want it 3ft to the left to stop the piece of rock showing and you cant remove ANY part of the foundation.
---
In the back?! Dick move, Banner!
---
Thanks, unfortunately radx suppresses my mutations, so I don't use it..
---
mi down to do it with you or anyone that want to do it. I am at work now but later im down for it.
---
I am mainly talking about the level 100 plusses that use to just rape every noob on the map in adventure mode because they could, so glad they removed slap damage.  not you specifically and yeah I agree there is no way you can accidently go into pvp mode and if you do just accept the risks that come with it, same for taking a workshop. 
---
 I am level 250 plus now. man they keep stacking up. I know the game pretty well, point being I could take that level 30s powerplant if I wanted it. wood building level 1 turrets, it would be like eating a jelly bean.  pop, one fusion core generator sir and a thank you. but I dont. 
---
1. I know nothing about his skill level, he/she potentially slogging through the learning curve already, why add frustration and potentially ruin a long term community member .
---
2. no idea what sort of day he/she could be having. could be trying to get those last few things before work, could be trying to escape an absolute shit day at school or work.
---
3. it is just wrong to fuck with people for no reason. a lot of people just don't understand that simple truth, you can explain it to them but they will never understand it. Instead they will smile, nod, and do everything society says they should out of their own self interest but the understanding is just not there.Not one ounce of compassion for their fellow man. they just fake it. 
---
minimizing the value of loss does not make a wrong thing right, stealing  is stealing, someones dollar or a million, whether you get caught or not you have done a wrong thing. most people feel it in their gut and do not steal. but many do and they always have justifications. rule of thumb in life if you have to justify something, its probably just wrong.
---
Company's don't care about you. Hate to break it to you.
---
It'd be hard to beat the standard blue with purple highlights imo, been using it since I reached level 50 and can't get enough of it.
---
Still I'm a bit sick of Power Armor skins being released, there's so many already and outside of nuke zones PA is pretty redundant compared to Sentinel/Cavalier/Assassin body armor. I wanna see more paints for weapons, crafting benches and cool outfits.
---
It's not about the content at all. It's a low hanging fruit that they know will get reactions. They get paid for views and comments, bad publicity is still publicity.
---
Youtube is also saturated with these "content creators", it's an easy way to get people to react, even if it's just a "people still play this game?" it's money in the bank.
---
Prickets Fort has the most, at least from what I've seen
---
You can get a max (that i know from perk and armor setup) of 700 ballistic dr. But it would leave you with a small energy dr of 160, meaning a laser rifle or robots would shred you to pieces. The best thing you should go for instead of looking for the highest dr, should be a balanced one between ballistic, energy and maybe a little but for radiation.
---
Ty yeah I did some changing n I got to 452 368 , is that good ? I feel I could be doing more
---
Thanks dude! Sadly I have school tomorrow and its currently 8.45pm for me. It would be amazing if you could do another time, but I don’t want to be a choosing beggar and I understand if it’s too much to ask.
---
&gt;However, he believes the game has "really turned around" into a "fabulous game with an incredible community behind it.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"We felt strongly this is a game we want to play, this is something we really want to do, and all of the games like this...there's a \[difficult\] period when you launch. It's not how you launch, it's what it becomes, and I couldn't be prouder of the team that's worked on it."
---
Just taking this on face value (since it could be misquoted or taken out of context) but this reads a little PR or disconnected from the player base.
---
I mean when is the head of a gaming studio ever going to say that their game was mediocre and what matters isn't how it launched but what it becomes? Of course he's going to give the answer that he did.
---
The real question for me is how things play out for the future. Will they really learn from this or will the next game be heavily tied to microtransactions, have poorly managed patches that reintroduce bugs that were previously fixed and so on? 
---
The trajectory that Bethesda is seemingly on doesn't give me much confidence in the future of 76 being more than just an ok game, or really the future of the company as a whole. It almost feels like it's follow the same path as Bioware, especially considering how both Andromeda and Anthem turned out.
---
Aaaand it’s happening! Today I totally bankrupted myself when I found a Furious Explosive Minigun at a player vendor for 3980 caps. 
---
At the time I had only about 3200 caps so I ran back to my camp and rummaged through my stuff to sell anything not absolutely needed, terrified the vendor would disappear.
---
A great example of where two good stars are more than enough!
---
Diluted Rad-x and Radshield stacks without suppressing mutations.
---
Thats actually pretty good, i run bloddied with 5 unyielding and i do around 390, and those are with crappy armor. Its only because the 5 unyielding bring my strenght up to 38, my agility  to 28 wich permits me to get the max from barbarian and evasive, even if i dont have strenght and agility maxed out.
---
diluted radawy shouldnt affect your mutations
---
I'm on PC, I'd do that but I don't want to spam my vendor slots/fill up my stash as I don't consider them even worth selling. Dropping them is a far better option since I know I don't buy that stuff.
---
And for energy resistance im pretty much the same as the balistic one. I dont want to be op against a supermutant firing a gun, then get one shot by the next super mutant because he has a laser rifle
---
WHERE ARE THE NPCS?
---
True. 
---
But those folks also aren't typical reddit users.
---
Today I (lvl-42) fought a lvl-66 3* Legendary Dusky Yaou-gai. Took me about 100 .308 till the weapon broke, then similar .44 till it broke, then finished him with a 40mm grenade launcher. Heaving a contented sigh of relief, I watched in horror as the corpse got up and ran away, disappearing after 10-15 meters... sad day.
---
Have they completely changed this game to tailor to my every need?
---
Sure, I am online now just add me :)
---
Must be bad luck - I was able to get Refrigerated for me (8 badges), then collected another 5 for someone who wanted armored one and two days ago I completed another 8 for refrigerated for another player. I can get at least 1/day, sometimes 2 (I do both repeatable quests and 2-3 campfire each day).
---
You talking about the orange space suit?
---
Radshield does suppress mutations.
---
I have all the deathclaw's eggs hidden too :)
---
Good point.
---
Kudos man for taking the chance and enjoying it. Problem is youtubers/streamers hell even media outlet reviewers always like to try ruin a games rep if its not the game THEY wanted.
---
Just need to look at the sekuro shadows die twice not having an easy mode bandwagon
---
No, be honest they are just whiners looking for recreational rage. 
---
Bet none of them ever used beth support portal to report a single glitch before posting it on reddit.
---
I've a fully decorated CAMP, working windmill and maxed bugdet, I build my CAMP from scratch in maybe 2 hours... maybe less... how can you take 22 to build a CAMP?
---
BUY BUY BUY BUY :D the wonders of the new gaming age!
---
Thanks for that, great info. It was your other post which prompted me to try and farm this event, the first time I hit it I had 5 max 3 star legionaries appear, the second time 2 and the third time 3. I think in hindsight after reading your post, I've been going there too late. Will start going there earlier and see what happens. Cheers.
---
Ty for your help I forgot that they cap , I was wondering why it wouldn’t raise the Dmg Resist when I put all unyielding , ty man bout to tweak some more stuff out
---
Sadly I an on PC. I can make a hell lot of difusers (and I will when I arrive home... if it is so popular, it will be sell much more then the super stimpak that it is costs).
---
Nah the Silver one that you can find. Not the one from the atomic shop.
---
Ahh that sucks, yeah not many people have these stimpacks so craft as much as you can!
---
Sorry, not the orange one, the silver looking one that's a bit dirty?
---
I did the archaeologist challenges yesterday in a battered fedora, worked fine (Xbox)
---
I got you dude, ign Kitchen I'm on right now
---
Why do you think you are entitled to a refund under any situation?
---
What's yours so I know it's you?
---
Just switch servers
---
Fuck the phone auto correct it's Jirohen not kitchen.
---
Just had a flashback to the end of Jeepers creeper 2
---
And here I am with over 2k of them in my vendor machine and can't get them sold for 1c each lol when everyone else I know is getting 3-5 cap s for them. My camp must have a bad smell or something lol
---
Yeah my confusion stemmed from reading once that armour stats/benefits work inside Power Armour.
---
&gt; Or make sarcastic comments to forget how low quality product Fallout ~~76~~ 3 and NV were during its first few months. 
---
FTFY.
---
&gt; This kind of unconcerned reception, at least did, put Bethesda in a position where they were able to continue releasing untested and unfinished games, because they could get away with it.
---
Tru dat, but if you think it started with FO76 you have a misty eyed vision of the past.
---
The only one that seemed to mostly work on release was FO4.
---
This is the sorta fun community driven thing that I think Bethesda hoped would come out of this game. Really cool! 
---
The other day I had my first bad experience with another player in the game. I was doing a public event and got a team invite. Figuring that they just wanted to use me to fast travel to the event I accepted. They never joined the event, but after I completed it they emoted to join them. I thought it’d be fun to run with other players for a change so I fast travel over. I’m not a high level player, only in the mid 30s despite playing since launch, and as soon as I spawned in I was insta killed by a level 200+ player. I had been baited and it sucked. 
---
Thank you for being a player who adds to the game rather than takes away. 🙂
---
I only have one as I bought it from a vendor and wish I bought more as I haven't seen them listed since
---
Yeah they are awesome. My laptop is getting old and tired, so the video settings are as low as can be. I didn’t realise they look this good!
---
The ambience when they hit is amazing!
---
I wear the tan suit, battered fedora and glasses (NOT sunglasses). Basically a Vault Tec salesman...
---
No I rarely use a mic unless I'm trading
---
"New MAIN Quest". Id wager it'll be long
---
The how come I dont see red arrows over other sneaking players
---
He even said that before the game went on (pre) sale.  It's funny how much people bitch about was announced before they even bought the game, but they get outraged about it anyway.
---
Blind_Owl15 I’ll add you right now
---
My statement was hyperbolic and it still is unconfirmed what all will be the focus. I’m not wrong here. I want it to be the case but we know very little.
---
Final touch would have been eating you with Cannibal perk =D
---
My worst experiences with other players were:
---
1. Before PvP was changed, I was hitting Morgantown to grab a little loot and also to grab the capstash there when all of the sudden I got blown up and killed immediately. The dude that killed me was Lv 100+, I was only around Lv 30 at the time. I respawned and tried to run off but he kept catching up with me and killing me until I server hopped. It didn’t matter where I was on the map, he was able to find me and kill me over and over.
---
2. Right before Vending was added in, I was building my camp in the cranberry bog, a little ways from the station. I literally just finished the final touches when out of nowhere this dude with a 1000+ cap bounty and his buddy run up and start demolishing everything. I attempted to kill them (we were around the same level) but he one shotted me. The real kicker was that I left the sever, waited a minute, logged back in and Lo and behold, I was kicked right back on the same server, with the griefers waiting for me.
---
I’m happy now that it’s harder for people to be A-holes, they can take it to survival for that
---
Just letting you know, I can't hear a gosh darn thing you're saying. I can't hear anyone in game for some reason.
---
Thank you so much dude! And that was really kind of you to give me the rifle. Ty!! :D
---
&gt; The problem is a majority of the bugs and issues stemmed back to Fallout 4
---
A commonly stated opinion, but not really the case.
---
I know, but still. I typed this earlier. I know that everyone does it for the same reason. But why do the people still believe everything they see on Kotaku and agree with everything a totally biased author says. Nobody questions for themselves "is it really this way?"
---
Everyone out here wanting more Ultracite skins. At least you have a choice, The Raider PA has *nothing*. I admit, I'm like, the only person who uses it. Still disappointing.
---
&gt; so I don't avoid the game... but 
---
 I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.  
---
-- General Jack D. Ripper, USAF.
---
You can use blueprints for workshops the same way you do in your camps.
---
Exactly. I wanted to say the same thing. I've seen this too many times in r/WoW, r/Diablo, r/hearthstone (I love Blizzard games, ok?) or even some TV-show subreddits. And then there are the subreddits where these people are going to (at least they say so) and it inflates some egos over there. Some subreddits cannot take in success with sober head and become really elitist as a result. For example r/TheExpanse can be insufferable at times with "This poll showed Expanse as third best show. How can X and Y be ahead of us?". And I say that while loving Expanse...
---
So you thought you could get a refund on a product purchased 7 months ago after not using it for 6 months?
---
&gt; There also is always an unofficial patch, which Fallout 4 definitely had and they could have checked what bugs that was fixing when working on Fallout 76.
---
If you read the changelog for the unofficial patch you'll find that 99% (fake percentage added to give spurious significance) of the changes made by the patch are to Fallout 4 quests, locations and items, and so have very little relevance to FO76.
---
No worries, have fun!
---
But theres no guarantee you'll ever see that rare item again. I've seen the flatwoods monster maybe 3 dozen times now... yet many posters here are still looking.
---
Fallout 4 inspired me to clean up/decorate my house quite a bit. 
---
Now my house is a mess because I can't stop playing 76 😂
---
If enemies get closer than 10 ft to me I usually have to target them in VATS, since they get kind of jittery. Especially molerats. I know it's server side lag and blah blah and it's not that big of a deal, but it's still off-putting.
---
&gt; Tru dat, but if you think it started with FO76 you have a misty eyed vision of the past.
---
No, I don't.
---
Make me one XDDDD
---
I have a blueprint of a structure with torrents, a large generation, a cooking stove, a workbench and a stash box on it. I just lay that down every time.
---
You should definitely keep that typo because that's a good way to describe server hopping.
---
Because bugs. 
---
Bethesda tests the game, but they don't play the game.
---
You can hope. However Bethesda has failed every single update so far and I am sure they will continue failing next updates as well. If Nuclear Winter is some kind of Battle Royale it will be the worst one.
---
FO76 is pretty much dying already with current content. It needs a total overhaul to survive, but it is not going to happen because Bethesda isn't investing any more money to this project. They are already developing new broken games. We can hear just ridiculous lies in upcoming E3 if Todd even dare to appear.
---
All: BEHIND YOU!
---
I don't understand why vats isn't the standard for ranged weapons. You do more damage and it's easier to target limbs. It's basically an aimbot that's incredibly satisfying to use in all circumstances, except for when you miss on a 95% chance lol.
---
I don't  believe they care. Or at least they care about making fuss more than making the game better. Part of loving/caring is also the art of letting go. All things change. People, communities, games... sometimes as part of design, sometimes it's natural process. But clinging to the past and being (melo)dramatic over it doesn't do anything good. There are basically three options to handle such a change:
---
1) Leave and allow the other people to enjoy what they have
---
2) Try to find enjoyment even in the change and accept it
---
3) Lurk around and be constructive
---
People tend to misunderstand the point 3). They start making dramatic posts, quite often insulting the developers, ridiculing current playerbase and not accepting the argument that it's on them that they don't like the game anymore. There can be a constructive post about how the game has failed a player, but there aren't many of them. People nowadays see such a game and enemy entity, it's developers as people who have brought misery on them and the playerbase as supporters of such misery. And it shows in these goodbye posts. No moderation, no acceptance. Only antagonizing phrases that create a rift in the community. People who feel same will support it, especially because of the confrontative tone ("Yeah man, you showed them") while the current playerbese will dismiss it outright as toxic. If these posts were constructive and neutral in tone, even happy players would support it, because there's always a lot to improve in any game.
---
Hell, some of them haven't even played the game.
---
Who would win? A powerful fusion operated machine designed by the us government to protect and and enhance movement of its user that's capable of taking on tanks. Or a backpack lol
---
You should put them in a suitcase or something so they don't disappear.
---
I got the wendigo one yesterday it's awesome! It starts in an unmarked cabin in the Mire, north of Tanagra IIRC
---
Repair materials. Even Mutfruit, Tato and Corn will suffice for cooking adhesive.
---
I'm almost completely certain that it's impossible to give backpacks to other people or else I would gladly do so.
---
Get Instigating weapon and if u want maximum damage get unarmed.
---
DCG and powerfist, with instigating effect adrenaline perk in agility and u oneshot almost everything
---
Preach on preacher man!
---
I think bobbleheads are too strong to become permanent buff.
---
I have an idea about making them with cooldown. Maybe like 240 seconds before use and 60 second active time. So u can use any bobbleheads any time u need and no need to collect them and have 1 kilo per in stash
---
Maybe nerf them a bit, permanent 1 strength would be nice
---
You have to wear a hard hat and hi vis otherwise you could hurt yourself.
---
Gauss Rifle NV Scopes for certain, Poss just Gauss Rifles
---
I would like it if the had a 24 hours buff with a day cooldown
---
You just have low standards. It has been what? A half a year and 0 improvements have been made to missing endgame. Burrows is absolute garbage, No point investing into Arktos pharma. Remember, Alcohol? Yeah no one cares about it. Want actually good items? Ignore the player vending and go outside the game and browse actual trade forums. How stupid is that? Developers spend resources on a things that is inferior to a solution that players made themselves. long time ago.
---
Oh really? Do you know where you got them from?
---
This is annoying for me. I have a pre-patch TSE Gatling laser that doesn’t shoot lasers, but instead shoots ballistic looking projectiles at an extremely fast rate. I have a regular Gatling laser which shoots lasers fine, so was really wanting my TSE one to do the same
---
Nice idea too
---
Go to Wendigo cave, there's 2-3 guaranteed in there.
---
thank you for responding and putting in the effort but you missed the whole point of the build.
---
1. radicool only increases str which will not improve damage for a ranged weapon and only raise carry by 50 which will then be used up by carrying meds thus canceling any benefit and reducing your overall health pool because youre frikkin irradiated. just a bad idea. 
---
2.  Bear arms does not matter I roll out with only the one weapon a few meds of each and only 20 watermelon. Blocker is much more important at the queen fight . because if you arent applying tenderizer the rest of the group doesnt get the 7% damage bonus In close fights with struggling groups I have seen tenderizer make a difference in the rate of her health bar draining. 1v1 no big deal but give 10 peeps 7% damage bonus it becomes a game changer. so to keep tenderizer on her I don't shoot the adds on me and often just sit still so teammates can shoot the adds off of me instead while keeping tenderizer on the queen. well unless the damage is already going fast in which case i shoot the adds for extra xp. 
---
3. diseases do matter, they're annoying, and they become an extra variable to consider, and countering them requires the use of disease cures and antibiotics which are extra weight and inventory management. not to mention if you actually desire to stay disease free you will have to go out there and craft them often. avoiding the tedium of constantly crafting is what this build is all about. if I wanted to minmax damage I would not go with this build at all. I feel any damage I lose is made up for by convenience, ease of play, and sustainability. I pop into base pick watermelons dump stuff and I am ready to go, no time cooking, crafting ammo, crafting meds gathering specific resources etc. it is almost completely stress free and devoid of 90% of the minutia and tedium that annoys me in this game. and also none of the negative effects of my mutations affect the core functions of my character at all 
---
4. adrenaline may be mandatory on paper but in practice it wears off too fast. there's never any mobs around to charge it WHEN YOU NEED THEM, if you leave to go get the mobs by the time you get back the effect is gone or nearly gone. exact opposite of this builds intent, the extremely short term damage gain is just not worth all the bullshit you have to go through to get it. over all adrenaline sucks balls for a high rof weapon with low individual damage per shot and would be better suited to a commando or rifle build in my experience. I know when I ran it it kept me in a constant state of pissed off because I always managed to have it stacked at the wrong time. it was always stacked when it was the least usefull.
---
5. Adrenal reaction sucks for when I am at the queen surrounded by mobs and keeping tenderizer on her and I have to reload or my weapon breaks. I will not ever recommend or run a low health build, I am the guy that picks up low health builds when they get downed, I do appreciate the damage they provide but for sustainability glass cannons suck without a fatboi like me there to poke em in the ass with a stimpack. this is a general purpose pve / tanky build not max damage. to be fair queen fights get longer without glass cannons around to speed things up but I personally cannot play that way it annoys me to much, same for melee . melee is amazing but fuck everytime I try melee I want to take a nap.  
---
6. full charge sucks in practice, when you can just back up a bit and shoot them in the face instead having three in reload is far mor important, at max level my laser gat loads as fast as an assault rifle. because I am most vulerable health wise when I am not firing and because I am not maxed out on damage the faster reload is crucial for getting shots back on target as fast as possible agint 90% of the game it doesnt matter but in the queen fight I try and keep her crippled and tenderized the entire duration of the fight. fast reloading is a big factor. also for reloading when backed into a corner I just jet pack up into the air and by the time i land I am already spinning up the barrels. 
---
7. at over 1000 hours I have been in end game for a minute - fuck chems - healing factor is not for during the fight its for after when everything is dead and you need to top off, it eliminates the need to even carry any stims but super stims (because they're not needed and also because they wont work well enough to matter) killing a scorch beast with the 25% bonus provided by phsycho makes a difference in killtime of at most 15 seconds, and to use psycho you have to hunt for it buy it carry it etc, fuck chems, I dont craft them I dont use them, I dont buy them, I sell them to damage minmaxers, thats what I do with chems. they are not worth the time of going in and out of inventory sorting and or carrying. this build completely eliminates the need for chems and all the tedious crap that comes with it. 
---
one final change - I qite using dodgy - its usefull for dodgin the one big heavy hit but I fond jump jets are far mor usefull. you cant use jumpjets without AP so i moved it to pharma farmer for extra drug income for the caps. not sure what to do with those three pints to be honest. tried quick hands previously but it was glitching, they have had a patch since then I may try again.
---
At least in Europe, you are in most cases. But only within 14 days since the purchase of the product.
---
I love it when this happens to a roof tile when there is nothing else there.
---
If the event fails and your killing the alpha and die. You spawn outside the event.
---
The problem with the scrip mechanic is that the waiting period between scrip resets is frankly ridiculous; its very easy to accrue enough legendaries to hit the 150 marker.
---
maybe, the trick is to do it again right after you fast travel in. It might take more then one attempt with this and I have not had the chance to test it out if being on the friends list makes any difference.
---
Cool. Thank you!
---
Thank you im writing this down in my notebook book for camp ideas
---
Player vendor sadly but on Xbox
---
Last time I used it to make photo naked in the blastzone it didn't. Problem is it's difficult to craft, since it require rare flower form Mire.
---
I saw a player selling them for super cheap and bought a few. I know they are important for the scout stuff but I haven't even started it yet.
---
Yes you're exactly right. I love the fallout universe as much as anyone but criticism is perfectly valid and fans should be embracing it instead of just being fanboys and down voting anything which isnt blind praise.
---
You need to spend more time in build mode before commenting.
---
Why wouldn't you have enough fusion cores?  I'm using none of the perks and haven't had an issue.  When I get low I take a workshop at a power station and make more.  Low for me would be around 5 in my stash.  I think I've done this 3 times.  Any time I see a fusion generator I check it and the same goes for power armor.  
---
If you really don't want to use power armor you can use the radiation suite or do what has already been suggested and carry 
---
Diluted Rad-X around.  I think Glowing Blood Packs remove radiation or gives a radiation resistance, but I don't know if they remove or have a chance to remove mutations.  You can always try those.  Same for Brahman Milk.  That restores health and removes rads.  And if you're really worried about losing mutations then you can always use Starched Genes level 2.
---
Been as is forever
---
I call it morrowind style myself.
---
You've always had to do an extra search to find stuff. Otherwise they would have wasted the notification sound and image that pops up when it hits.
---
It works for me. I almost never have to repair at my bench.
---
Well, if it's predictable I find that it's not so bad at least for me. That way I can set my expectations beyond the estimate and better prepare for it. I usually take a good book to read because phones/etc. are not "allowed." If I have to read a manual or something I'll review that first.
---
From vatoga bot. I jumped 2 times resulting in combat &amp; leather...needless to say i stopped there
---
There is nothing to fix. It works as intended
---
ARGH!
---
That's a great idea actually I'm going to start putting them in the blue suitcase right in front of the ammo vendor.
---
And that was recently? I'll definitely have to check it out
---
&gt;always
---
Not in other Fallout games? I’m torn apart fuck me!
---
Been that way since launch mate, same with all the similar perk cards with meat/ammo/caps
---
On ps4. Well I use primarily 3rd person and it can be frustrating. 
---
A huge disconnect between where you're aiming hip fire and scopes. 
---
It's ridiculous trying to hit a target in melee distance. As of the barrel is protruding straight through the enemy. 
---
And every once in a while you get an aim assist that shoots like 30 degrees off.
---
Yesterday 👍
---
&gt;forever
---
x__x
---
That would be awesome! I'll be on today here and there hopefully we'll run into each other.
---
Awesome. Was it the trainstation or bos bot?
---
&gt;since launch
---
I’m dead inside friend.
---
But im assuming it was insane luck to get em back to back . But atleast they can spawn. But there is also some bug with marine/combat . You should be able to get info from someone here
---
Failed with every update? How?
---
The shopping mall bot
---
That's what she said
---
Copy that. I have wondered about doing the nuke thing solo. I don't think I'm there in the questing yet so I'm not putting much thought into it right away. I'll send you a request later today when I hop back on.
---
Always in FO76. In other games it was passive. In 76 the same goes with all the gain a chance to get extra stuff perks. Not sure why it was changed, but I'm guessing it's to assure people that it does work, as it can add extra stuff to containers.
---
u/kloakedd kmows more than me about it
---
The shopping mall bot in white springs or is it a location in wagona? (spelling?)
---
I just managed to complete it. If your friend dies from the radiation then they have no chance to ask for help.
---
In watoga
---
You can also buy a clean version of the silver suit and helmet from the travelling vendor bot
---
Awesome. Thank you very much for the info. I'll definetly check it out asap
---
Similar perks are passive in the main line games so I can understand the confusion, I don’t know why they changed it but it might be something to do with how the servers process random container loot
---
A,ready have starched genes, I was referring to the suppression of mutations that Rad X gives.
---
Calibrated shocks help but they can be super rare
---
i would say it almost identical, when you leave vats out off the equation, also yes you can adjust the sensitivity of things.
---
Exactly, that’s what I’ve read too.
---
The perk card should have info about this :(
---
You can server hop the vendor bot Phoenix. Made a post not long ago about it however, it’s rare for it to spawn. I have spawned every dense plan there except trapper(Heard someone else got Trapper). Server hopped for hours and couldn’t get any to spawn so it’s definitely a rare spawn. I’m just glad I got lucky and got everyone except trapper since the player vendor patch.
---
It’s like checking an additional container I guess.
---
The card should have info about this, specially because it’s different from other Fallout games.
---
People need to start using it before skins are useful. For people to start using it Ultracite needs a jet pack.
---
LOL that's only funny because it happens to a lot of people including myself. I was probably in your level range before I figured it out too :)
---
on a lowbie alt the radiation arches at player bases were super usefull a couple time. when you're trying to level by going through the story line in crappy armor and gear the radaway goes quick.
---
Wait, what? How do you use it?
---
Don't like that idea - my main character is melee/heavy gunner and I change builds from time to time, so I can also use right bobble to make me stronger for those builds. I would just do them last longer (2h normal, 4h with the perk).
---
Technically it does say right on the card "When you "Search" a container." It's not very clear at all, but it's not outright misleading.
---
a solid selection of junk for repairs and upgrades is also always nice as well.
---
Stop hoarding 1* crap items . Nobody wants you nocturnal wood leg or rolling pin
---
There are some difference. The peak around the corner is gone thing is gone now. You can vats while jumping as well. Vats is real time as well. 
---
Still feels buttery though.
---
Well, you actually could change bobblehead buffs for another builds, just like Stones in Skyrim
---
When you open a container you press X/Square to “Search” the container for additional supplies. Works with all the similar perks for meats/ammo/caps etc
---
I have a two shot explosive handmade with ab the best mods you can have on one. Have six perk slots toward riflemen perks and three more to tank killer and I also went max on explosives perk. I only do 150 damage per shot. sucks when I have to face enemies I used to destroy now. Pre nerf without any rifle perks and explosive perks and tank killer I was doing like 230 a shot I think. Right now It’s still the only close to viable gun I have now though. It’s good damage but almost not worth grinding a shitload of lead for this ammo I waste so I’ve since had to switch some perks toward melee for the mean time.
---
&gt; Wait, what? How do you use it?  
---
Look at container, press special button. The bonus items do **NOT** appear in the inventory of the container.
---
I personally want a bobble-head stand you can access periodically to pick a buff from whatever bobble heads you have displayed in there. the bobbleheads in your stand should be permenant but the buffs should have a timer. people should also be able to visit and use it as well. they could adjust the affects and duration to keep them from being overpowered but still useful, currently due to the rng factor I rarely bother looking for them and usually sell them without seeing even what the buff is. which is a shame i was proud of my stupid bobblehead collection in 4.
---
I read that it doesn't, but every time I pop one it suppresses mine. I made a bunch a little while back and held onto them. Maybe I'll try it again.
---
clunky and fallouty just like 4 :)
---
I found out about level 50 as well....  Lol
---
When looting a med box, cooler, or mirror you will see at the bottom of the loot menu a search option. Press appropriate button.
---
Yes, some clarification would help immensely.
---
Oh well, 3 points that I can use in intelligence then.
---
I hardly ever get a blueprint to work right. its always hanging object, or "sorry we cant place this structure in the apparently perfectly placable spot for reasons" no specific reasons it will just say red and not say why. I finally said to heck with it and scrapped all my blue prints.
---
Very poor karma-grab attempt.
---
Right?????
---
At least I can use the 3 points in intelligence or something else.
---
It's always been like that. Same with scrounger, can do and butcher's bounty.
---
I also thought that since it's better than Rad-X (300&gt;200) it should suppress the mutation, but when there was that stupid challenge to get photo of friend in blastzone both being naked I used them and it didn't. Maybe it was change recently?
---
I’ve had a great time reading this post but I wanted to let you all know I’m done with it now.
---
i dont know, but sometimes it sure looks like it is, alpha is always easy8for me), but bravo and charlie the robots spawn none stop. or at least the last few weeks and that is in XBOX
---
I wonder if the 5mm ammo is the cause? Isn't the minigun the only other weapon to use it? Realistically the Gatling gun ought to be firing the .50 steel balls. Might have been a developmental oversight?
---
Nobody wants their exit to be meaningless. This is like every person I know that have stopped playing WOW. It's always high drama.
---
That is why you have a percentage of a chance to find extra chems
---
Yeah, that could be. Another thing about it is that the bullets look like they're exploding on impact, but that's not one of the features listed. I ended up taking it to the legendary exchange and getting a shitty hatchet for it.
---
I can tell you that that isn't the issue. I have had my vending machines emptied once and I never stay in a world where I can't place my camp. If the prompt comes up I *always* choose finding another world.
---
are you on xbox, i would love to take a look at your stuff
---
Oh also. Camps shouldn't be protected in survival like they are in adventure. Too many Turret bases about with people hiding in them... no idea why people do that. it must be so boring just sitting and waiting
---
I’d say a radroach would be the easiest
---
 I’m on ps4
---
&gt; It'll never be New Vegas 2, and a loud chunk of the internet wont be happy until ~~Bethesda~~ *[ Obsidian ]* makes that.
---
Forgetting that the Obsidian that made New Vegas *doesn't exist any more*.
---
I run bloody mess and shoot vamp laser gat a lot of bodies get lost in tall grass from either exploding or turning into ash.
---
All 4 of mine have emptied twice, I only just restocked after a week of not using vending (in case it was going to get a hotfix) but then I read on here it may have had something to do with not logging out properly?
---
They made them more common in certain regions a few updates back. It’s very nice to see them again because they give off a cool vibe
---
In dark Souls, you can leave messages for players in just about any area of the game. They appear as orange runes on the floor that you can read. Now, you cannot type out your own words, but you can choose from a pretty huge selection of phrases and adjectives.
---
This weird, quirky "breadcrumb-leaving" message system will, naturally, encourage people to try and find a way to write rude things without actually being able to be rude.
---
Hence; "try tongue but hole". Notice the missing 't' in butt! 
---
"Amazing chest ahead" could be used to describe some amazing treasure to be found down that valley... OR people will just leave that message in front of Gwynevere's chamber. A woman well known for her... bountiful bosom.
---
Those are the two most well-known examples. There are many, many more and each are as silly and childish as the next. However, they always get a laugh out of people and it isn't always just what the message says, but WHERE you find it too.
---
Sorry for the ramble. I very much adore the Souls games. Hope my explanation helped!
---
Yes
---
&gt;  but this reads a little PR or disconnected from the player base.
---
You don't think that FO76 players think that?  Or by "player base" do you mean people who *don't* play FO76?
---
I made a thread for this to see what others experience is, I seem to remember reading that it was a big that it didn't suppress, then they fixed it. Maybe then broke it again.
---
This seems like one of the games that would be fair to give a re-review
---
&gt;Radx
---
Yup,
---
Got the  Radx recipe for 500 caps of a player vendor last night :)
---
So it seems, some info in the card wouldn’t hurt :(
---
I’ve played since December and I never felt like I was missing out by not having them. I’ve since bought a few once they added player vending and they definitely make the game more fun in my opinion. But I can see how the might seem unrealistic and silly to others as well
---
You've still failed to accept my friend requests.
---
I think there was one leaked a while back that dealt with becoming the new enclave president or something like that. No idea if it’s still coming or not
---
Thank you for your selfless confirmation that people are sometimes nice.
---
&gt; I found two robots stuck in a loop asking each other questions haha sat there for 10 min listening to them.

System and gamertag?
---
Build the hell out of the workshop so they have to spend max caps to claim it. 
---
Also you may want to try a stealth boy for revenge, you'd be surprised how many of these "bad asses" can't deal with a stealth boi player.
---
I like bacon.
---
Kudos to you amigo. One thing though- People seem to have forgotten about leaving freebies at the overseers stash, and opt to put stuff at 0 caps in their own vendors. Hopefully we can start doing it again so nothing like that happens
---
I got the exact same gun yesterday It went right back in the exchange box to me its worth 40 script
---
She's told me Red Riding Hood.  At the end of the tale I was attacked by a wolf.  She also told me the 3 little pigs, but that time nothing bad happened at the end.  All of her versions include General Atomics publicity.

Because people where downvoting not realizing it was sarcasm
---
I has never for me. Use em all the time.

damn, im on xbox.

PC - Masked_Katz

My bad, I forgot to add that - Ill edit that in hahah
---
Where do you get the plans?
---
There's a group event you do, but you need to be level 50 and have like 8 people with you that's why I can't do it. I'm not level 50

I wasn't going to post this so thanks for motivating me. It's a screenshot of another 3\* suicider (this happened yesterday at around 1730EST):  [https://imgur.com/a/QN0JKYK](https://imgur.com/a/QN0JKYK).
---
33 perception o_0
---
...can you see the future with that amount of perception? How is Fallout 5 looking?
---
Good advice.
---
Keep leveling up. The first 100 levels are for creating your build. The next 100 levels are for tweaking it.
---
I've got a lot of perks that are set to different levels. Maxed out gunsmith and makeshift warrior for crafting purposes, but I run with them at three ranks. I have a maxed out adrenaline and a three rank adrenaline so I can throw on white knight after a queen fight.
---
Now i know i should expect a Broadsider or a Laser gun for a ranged legendary. One Handmade in maybe 12 tries, Combat rifle would also work for me. 
---
I'll keep turning in those scrips though til i get what i really want.
---
That's my signature move. The jumping vats burst fire crit 😁
---
It's Luke that for the caps perk as well.
---
Unyielding Armor is your friend (incisor helps alot) my Instigating Power Fist does over 700 damage that's 2800 for a sneak attack. I have a Stalkers meat hook that does 540 damage.
---
I also use Radicool, Twisted Muscles, Adrenal Reaction and nerd rage.
---
You can also use chems I believe Fury gives you a 30% damage boost.
---
Mole Rat chunks plus 1 strength 
---
Glowing Meat 10% Melee damage
---
Let's not taunt them to fix one of the last few nice things we have left shall we?
---
Given their track record if there is a nice thing left in the game is best not to talk about it at all.
---
Maybe that way they will shift their focus to fixing the quite a few nasty things that have lingered around sice B.E.T.A. instead.
---
Makes me feel like I'm in a Gun Fu movie 😂
---
I know this is an old thread but I wanted to mention I had the BOS SGT paint drop for me WITH the shielded lining plan in the same turn-in, so it looks like the roll for shielded lining is entirely separate from the roll for paint.
---
I made a post earlier this year. I 'd like a rework of the collector perk card,so that it makes your current used bobblehead and magazine effect permanent. That as long as the card is active obviously. It would make them valuable and would also keep the flexibility of changing between them.
---
What console? We know them pc players are nothin but EVIL!
---
Smart one is the one who follows his enjoyment. Do you enjoy the game and play it? You're smart. Don't you enjoy the game and left? You're smart. Anything else is not smart. Given that most people who left the game weren't enjoying it, then yes, they were smart...
---
But I'm also aware that you were trying to make generalist statement of "the only smart way to approach Fo76 is to not play it..." Still, I hope this will educate you a little bit...
---
Sometimes bounty comes from friendly fire when trying to help each other out. Especially when fighting hordes of scorched. I never go after those that have bounty just because I happened to be in their one of fire.
---
People don't have to experience something firsthand to know that it's something they probably don't want to experience. I've never been in a severe car accident, but I've seen enough footage/photos of them to know I never want to be in one. Of course there's people that hate the game simply because other people hate it, but you're being just as unreasonable and childish as those people by dismissing anyone that "hates on the game" as trolls riding a bandwagon. You've formed your own bandwagon of shooting down any negative reception/reaction toward the game as a means of reinforcing your own confirmation bias, and that just gives people free ammo to accuse you of being fanboys.  If you expect other people to look at things from a fair and objective standpoint, then be the change you want to see and do so yourselves. If you like the game then that's great, that means you should be willing to help the game grow and improve by having reasonable discussions about the problems and criticisms, rather than getting upset and dismissing it all as "Oh the internet just loves to hate something, I love the game".   
---
NB4 "BUT YOU'RE PROVING THE POINT CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME EITHER REEE". I have over 2 days worth of playtime and enjoyed it for the most part, but I haven't really played any since launch. The reason I'm ever even on this sub in the first place is to get an idea of where the game is so I know if it's worth downloading and checking out, which always proves incredibly unfruitful because all I ever see is people spamming either "THIS GAME BAD" or "NO THIS GAME GOOD, YOU BAD".
---
Ingame: chill af cool people. 
---
On reddit: total fkn cestpit of Toxic people
---
Damn. Thanks everybody. And thanks OP for pointing this out. I feel like a dummy for not noticing that.
---
It might be a part of the upcoming Nuclear Winter updates, which are rumored to introduce major new PvP content in addition to the PvE vault raids. In any case, whatever is planned, it will probably be showcased at BE3 in 6 days.
---
The clean spacesuit looks better. You can buy it from the responders vendor bot that spawns outside of Charleston Station.
---
And would it be like Encryptid where it's announced to the whole server and only morons turn up?
---
Still pissed because the event failed *again* last night because no fucker would take the pylons and when I, holding 2 pylons, got downed some tossbucket came up to me and waited for me to die so he could steal my paper bag.  Enjoy your single piece of bone, cretin.
---
Right?
---
At a certain point you stop getting upset at the loot generator. Get a crap item, toss it, move on.
---
😂😂 almost ...looking bright lol
---
Yeah, damn.
---
Yes , i just inspect and leave 1* items if i have traded in scrips and vendor caps
---
They do say when you "search" in quotations in the description which implies they're not passive. I don't think they really need to do more than that on the perk screen but some info in the help section wouldn't go amiss. Apperently this is something that has carried over from FO4 as well. I'm guilty of thinking they we're passive for a long while too.
---
Gimme the bacon and I'll hunt him down
---
Yeah but I’m specifically not running bloodied and using a combat knife not a power fist.
---
Everyone else comments a random dumbass “oOf!¡” 15 upvotes!!!! 
---
Me: 0! Fucking reddit.
---
Respectfully I can see where you are coming from but I disagree. You're comparing a game to a potentially life threatening incident. Something that may physically harm you is far different to a simple video game. Not to mention car accidents aren't decided by choice, they are an accident. The choice is to go driving which people do. The comparison would be more fitting of "I hate cars they are so dangerous" coming from someone who has only seen pictures of cars and talked about them but never actually gotten inside one
---
To answer your question, I used to have around 540 DR/ 450 ER with a low health build and a full set of bolstering armor (heavy combat chest and mixed heavy metal/leather limbs), scaly skin/grounded mutations and barbarian/evasive. My character had high stength and agility and was a "jack of all trades" when it came to weapons. I don't use power armor but I know you can get similar results with a decent set crafted with high intelligence. 
---
In general, though, I'd suggest not placing too much importance on DR/ER. I've since switched to a full set of unyielding (same armor types) because the benefits outweigh what I feel is a massive diminishing return on high DR/ER. I find the damage avoidance perks like serendipty and lone wanderer to be way more beneficial than a handful of DR so I ditched barbarian/evasive and grounded (I sometimes use energy weapons) and now have around 300 DR/250 ER. I don't find that much of a difference when taking damage from my prevoius setup. 
---
I also rely heavily on stealth (sneak 3 + escape artist) and primarly use ranged weapons so I'm rarely getting swarmed and taking that much damage to begin with so all that DR is even less relevant. This, of course, is largely a matter of play style and may not be relevant to you.
---
If i remember its 50% each way
---
For a long ass time I was a 2h melee build but lately I’ve been moving towards heavy weapons, and it’s been liberating.
---
It does not.
---
Uh no, it's a very good joke post
---
No need to be nervous.  You only loose your photos.
---
could I get you to put a rocket on top of my monongah garage by chance? I can pay.
---
I relate with this so hard. I tend to keep shit I know about the game to myself for fear Bethesda will patch any fun out.
---
I am almost there with this and gaining my badge, as @bigfattone says, you get it from the daily event at Daily Sods, after collecting all the bug pieces, (1 per event), at Camp Adams event the S'mores Recipe is dropped at random, however after completing this event 3 times it wasn't awarded, I ended up buying at someone's C.A.M.P. Vendor machine!
---
All I need now is to complete the bug pieces event 2 more times to get my badge.
---
On a further note, on S'mores, if you check your recipes, you will find that you will need Razorgrain Flour and Syrup, so worth producing these when you get the materials and storing them.
---
40 Scrip or I would sell for around 1500  caps pricing is hard I just gave away a couple of 2 shot 1* handmades that sat in my machines I tried to sell them for 550 caps each for a week.
---
Chinese bots is my theory
---
Thanks for the advice! But I already got the Spacesuit (thanks to a super kind player) and I love it. I also kinda prefer the worn/dirty look to the clean one tbh.
---
Have you checked back in yet to see how many ups you got though?
---
Also a tab just for atom stuff
---
I don't remember them being poisonous in F04...
---
I play on console because I fix software (mostly) 8 hours a day and don't want to touch a PC when I get home. I've learned to ignore the console creeps. 
---
Plus I sit on my couch with my 2 dogs and my wife. My wife can mimic every robot vendor and likes to make snide comments about why me and my teammate's male toons are wearing dresses. Non-gamers don't get Atom shop quests. 
---
I don't have to wear glasses on my big screen TV so that's huge for me. I've had a PC in the living room but it was a hassle....
---
Xb1 X runs decent enough.
---
Came here to suggest this. I'll be lucky if even my friends notice them.
---
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG SWAMP FOOL
---
Get enclave under armor the highest level it will increase your strength by 3 then find armor pieces with plus 1 strength and have 15 strength points.
---
For weapons according to some players Nocturnal can grant up to a 100% damage buff.
---
This was specifically to the Harpoon Gun which had Explosive with the Fletchette mod which is already doing 1043 damage with maxed Heavy Gunner and Demolition Expert though.
---
As far as armor or your typical weapon goes Ztoned66 is probably right in stating its likely 50% otherwise, which isn't bad but it is situational.
---
You're reading way too much into that analogy lol. Obviously a rough video game launch is nowhere near as serious as a car accident, but the point I was making is that it looked like a very unpleasant experience because frankly, it /was/ a pretty unpleasant experience in many ways. The analogy isn't what's important anyway, the message I was trying to send is to treat other people the way you wish other people would treat you. If you want other people to be fair and objective, then you too must be fair in objective, by lumping the criticism of the game into "Ah well it's just people that haven't played it", you're stooping to the level of the people that do just mindlessly hate it. Things like this are never black and white and it should never become and "us and them" situation, the gaming community needs to learn how to have reasonable discussions rather than pointless, bias affirming arguments.
---
Sure thing!
---
that would be awesome It will be an hour or so before I am online. are they expensive to make?
---
I have the mod now and you are correct. Rads are a bitch but avoidable and I just had to change my style a tad when it comes to how close I let ghouls get to me but even that isn’t that hard to deal with. The +120 carry weight is a game changer.
---
I’ll see if that makes the difference, I have a shielded brotherhood officer under armor currently.

It took me like 50 hours after the beta to figure that out.. I was like, hmmmm.. I guess I'm getting extra Chem's in each box.. wait, what's that button for?
---
The first time I tried it I just didn't prepare for it at all. I just ran out of Stimpaks and bullets. 
---
This time round I made sure dump all my junk first. Lever Action for Mr Handy thrusters and the shotgun for Assaultrons. Nothing in the silo is super difficult as long as you know to pick your fights carefully and not just run through like a maniac.
---
Not at all, just message me whenever you're ready and Ill get back to you asap.
---
Im not sure if its possible to keep Atomicshop items you havent purchased in your camp, but we can see if it works.
---
Some of above are good suggestions, same are not (upping the vendor cash is irrelevant, it's easy to get caps anyway), but I really like joint stash space for all characters to be able easy and safely (without the help of other players) transfer items and caps between your characters. It doesn't have to be big, 100 lbs can be enough to transfer items back and forth.
---
Just go to the penitentiary up in the toxic valley. Go in the front door and straight ahead is a door to the yard with lockers on each side. Drifter will spawn usually in the locker on the left. Might take a couple of server hops
---
High capacity is a game changer for me. +120 carry weight and keeping all my legendary armor effects is wonderful. The negatives aren’t that noticeable as your comments reveal. 
---
I chimed in before I had the mod to say it would make you too weak and that’s wrong. It’s only noticeable in high rad areas so you just can’t stick around. Everything else, enemies specifically, are dead long before I’m shot at.
---
Saw one of these earlier!
---
Thats great and all, but I've gotten green thumb through perk card packs probably 10 times. I hate this card.
---
I'm confused what your point you're actually trying to make when in my very first comment I admit the game has bugs that can be quite frustrating so clearly I'm not burying my head in the sand saying the game is perfect. And I stated my experience which is the people that are most vocal about hating on the game are the ones that haven't experienced it and I'm sorry but too many have uneducated opinions especially on the internet these days.
---
If you want to know what it's like being a soldier in a war whose opinion carries more weight, a soldier that experienced it or someone that heard what's its like and wants to tell everyone about it? Anyone can have their own opinions but to have a valid informed opinion you must have experience.
---
It was forged from rare metals from a falling star under a full moon by super mutants. It was said to have captured the power of the night when the moon beams alloyed with the rare metals thus granting nocturnal powers.
---
&gt; You don't think that FO76 players think that?
---
I do think that. Not everyone, of course. I've seen some people tout it as the best game ever.
---
I think you would be VERY hard pressed to get the majority of players to agree that this game is fabulous. I've put a ton of hours into this game and there's no way I would ever consider it to be that good. The facts just don't support it, which is why I said what I said. There seems to be a disconnect between what Todd is saying and how things seem to be on the ground.
---
...blueprints?
---
The more strength you have the more damage you do.
---
nope Didnt realize it was atmoic cshop purchase. it wont work :( oh well thnks for being willing !
---
It took me like 1 to rebuild my camp and I got most of it done besides some items that require steel(ran out). You can do the store button just a heads up.
---
Ah, sorry about that, hope you earn enough atoms for it someday - cheers :)
---
For real? That’d be the time to quit for many of us then.
---
Not gonna waste another 400 hours for higher lvl items.
---
Pointless to have a new lvl cap imo
---
Should be Fasnacht beret and sledgehammer for the full Melon-molestor vibe.
---
You on Xbox btw?
---
Yeah not kidding about rare. I've been hoping that the next player vendor I see has a mod or cheap plan but alas I really need to save caps and buy the plans myself
---
Great idea. Adventure mode is definitely missing something with such limited PVP, but the unguided 'kill anyone you see' approach of survival mode isn't the answer either.
---
LOL agreed
---
It really isnt though. Plenty of reddit people use the normal exit. But it's precisely because they use the normal exit you dont see it, all you can see are the dramatic exits
---
Yeah that's a perfect comparison. I don't even care about damage resistance buffs for the power armour they desperately at minimum need a carry weight buff
---
and the comments here is exactly why Todd is so comfortable with releasing such pile of shit.
---
you people are such an inspiration, in the worst fucking way possible.
---
My build is a hybrid of sneak and high perception and agility mixed with heavy gunner on respec. I like the commando automatic rifles with tweaked receivers as they double shot before recoil allowing me to double tap all enemies with or without VATS. (Explosive handmade and Fixer)
---
That’s for day to day, but the boss fights are a different story. LMG and Plasma Gatling (both bloodied) are my weapons because you are generally carrying rads against the queen anyways so it naturally lends to my heavy weapons doing high damage. With one clip I can see the queen’s health bar moving. (Bloodied Explosive LMG, Bloodied Plasma Gatling)
---
You have Workshops.
---
At least that’s what we care bears are told any time we complain about being molested at them.
---
Though in seriousness if the rumors of what Nuclear Winter will be about are true you should be getting quite a bit of scripted PvP content coming soon.
---
I did stop 3 months ago and i didn't even post it.
---
Yes confirmed now that part of Possum Badges. Many posts on other sites also saying Ash Heap events
---
Opposite way around
---
Level 121, finished Enclave ages ago....realized yesterday their are vendors in there....
---
What a surprise. Finally have a stimpack recipe...
---
Not only are there vendors , but they all sell different stuff. Color me stupid.
---
Now if I could just get the layout of the place in my head. Its like a maze designed by a madman in there.
---
I had three scorched mirelurk kings in the glasses caverns. Opened a door, and they rushed me. Followed by a crapload of regular scorched. 
---
Backpedalled like a bastard, wasting everything I had on them. Tough as hell fight.
---
The scorhbeast fight at the end, however? Walk in the park.
---
What's your IGN? I'll take them. Scoots_McBoots here.
---
Yep it is a bit and a certain area not accessible yet
---
Do you use stabilized just for the accuracy bonus? Anti armour has no effect on energy damage, seems to be a waste if you solely use the GL
---
The game's done a great job of discouraging griefing and dick behavior, death is trivial, and Survival mode draws folks that need to scratch their "king of the hill" itch. If I could a full-time Responder in-game, I'd totally do that - stimpack downed players and drop ammo.
---
The original house off mutations
---
I just want private servers
---
If Bethesda keeps working hard on the game I see nothing but good things in the future.  They really need to keep adding more content similar to the ever upwards questline.  Things that keep people busy and gives good rewards.  I think if they add faction content with the same type of mechanics, people would be very invested.
---
I earned 4500 caps in 30mins because those people could'nt stop trying to take revenge on me, best thing is to just run away from the workshop. People are stupid so even if you're not they'll still want to check. Crouching wirg invisibility is useless btw, these dudes camped in a toilet house and when I opened it they both shot at me with their explosives just to get one shot killed by an automatic laser rifle lol
---
Calibrated shocks, motion-assist, and full Excavator set mitigates encumbrance, for a bit.
---
You do get good rad resist from being in full-set PA, though. Non-PA radiation mitigation is a lot more cumbersome.
---
Enjoy the game as much as you want, but do not defend their bad practices. Whatever comes their way is well deserved. And I guess every costumer would prefer a finished product at launch like it used to be long time ago. So I could not fathom why any customer  would side with the industry on this.
---
No matter how much fun someone might have with a broken unfinished mess of a game, it does not change the fact that it is an utter insult to the customer.
---
Videogamers need to make clear with their wallets, that they are not going to accept unfinished products any further. Otherwise we are screwed for times to come.
---
I don't think it's a bug- it's a different med to rad-x. Pretty sure it's not supposed to suppress mutations.
---
Ok but 308 is more readily available than 50's
---
I salute you sir, well done.
---
It says 17 and older on the box for a reason...
---
I craft them for lower level players for free along with a full set of deep pocketed leather armor and some ammo.
---
Well, that's how mines in real life work...
---
I am all for this but want to add one more thing.   People come to my camp and always get stuck under the building.   Yes I could rebuild but that isn't happening.   They could give us the welcome mats but that isn't happening yet either.   Why can't they just let visitors spawn where I spawn when I travel to my own camp?   Why do visitors spawn at one location in my camp and I spawn at another?  The game is obviously keeping track of two locations.    You could make the argument it can be abused but you can abuse the present spawn mechanism now too.
---
Insanely tough. IMO the toughest you’ll ever face when three star with poison attacks. Good lord. I’ve had a few fights with those fuckers.
---
Yup, Kotaku is absolutely GARBAGE, long since deleted that website from bookmarks once I saw just how low the bar is for that site.
---
what level you looking for?
---
Gatling Lasers are great also because of their high DPS and that you can grow their ammo at a workshop. I've got 60 fusion cores on my heavy weapons character but the good 3* Gatling lasers are on my other characters. Typical
---
thank you so much for your detailed reply, and also for writing an excellent guide.
---
sorry didnt get a chance to thank your earlier.
---
i have taken many things that you have mentioned into consideration and have adjusted my build to be somewhere in between. i just hit lv17 this morning so there is a long way to go, but i will prioritize the core cards first and see how it goes before taking the QoL ones like power user for example. 
---
since i have no friends that play the game regularly having a mule is pretty much a no go, so having fewer cores that last longer, at least currently, seems a bit more appealing to me.
---
i have also removed a few mutations that dont really fit. eagle eyes, i wont be using vats and bird bones... im in power armor... no need to reduce fall damage... and again not using vats so the negative part of lower AP is not as important. and reading your response regarding class freak, it was no longer nescecary since i removed the -str mutations and the rest i can live with so i redistributed 3 points in luck to others for more QoL.
---
in the end ill be aiming for something like [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f336f68&amp;d=s32sr2st1c72ic4ip2id2ls2lt2l71s22ek1a04pe2sq2s00ir2eu0cu0s70cr0s10&amp;w=ii0if2ie2at1lm2ik0i91p72p10p90p80sd1ei1pa0iq2cm0c52i30i50ia0&amp;n=&amp;m=23cef)
---
there is a good chance that i will adjust it as i get more experience with the build... and end up with something more akin to yours. all your choices make sense and are well thought out, and its not that i dont believe you regarding certain things that i chose not to change... its just that i think that due to my sometimes restricted playtime and lack of friends that play, i have a hunch that this would suit me a bit better.
---
again thanks a lot for the effort you put into this.
---
While i don't hate the game and keep playing it since BETA, we have to admit that most hate probably came from the fact that they released a copy/paste from a 2015 game, selling stuff for $10 which was free a few years back.
---
Yup, everything on that damn site is somehow made political.
---
exactly south of the watoga station is a small land marked swamp/farm house where i've encountered at least 2 glowing mirelurk kings ~~one of which is guaranteed to give me rattle hands, fuckers~~
---
You have to know that it is coming though.  Weapons and armors will eventually be 4 and 5 stars making all 3 star weapons and armor outdated.
---
 That's why I haven't been too worried about getting the exact armor I need.  I have all 3 star armor but they are not a coordinated set by any means.  They're just a hodgepodge of pieces I have found in the wasteland.
---
+5 for cunts, I miss the Hound
---
Agree, been grinding like a motherducker to get the gear I have now. Maybe if they actually add a reliant loot system in the future, it might be interesting. But right now it would have 0 impact gameplay wise to raise items level. Rather add new ones, or new (non OP) effects which can rival the existing
---
A 22-hour build sounds fun, but this was a few hours after work. Any screenshots of the windmill?
---
Itd be nice, but I'm gonna need some evidence. Like the charging barrel for Gatling laser where we can see every shot that's fired, and see if it depletes the ammo in the counter
---
Every version I've had didn't have that. I think I'm just unlucky
---
I use mines as last-ditch "Holy hell it's a Mirelurk Queen" cover as I run backwards as fast as I can. Otherwise, I sell them.
---
Nocturnal for weapons is +50% at midnight, and -35% at noon, with varying % in between, depending on time of day/night. I would assume they used the same logic for the DR buff in armor.
---
Search "the fall of 76"
---
If Bethesda is stupid enough to raise the level cap, they’ll be killing off a huge part of their daily playerbase.
---
Instead they should maybe add new perks, or keep focusing on new content.
---
About the only way to have an idea is check the player level and what type of items they have when you scroll over their camp.  I usually avoid low level camps and hit up high level camps.  
---
As far as ratings go maybe it needs rating caterogies?  Stuff like quality, price, etc.  I don't know how to make it fair when rando's can give you a shitty rating "just because".
---
It’s not an issue for me or people I’ve talked with but I don’t speak for all. Just use your weapon and have fun. You can’t be concerned that someone else’s frame rate is suffering because you have a god tier weapon that may effect others. 
---
The only thing in game that causes my machine to hiccup are the automated military anti aircraft missile launchers in Cranberry Bog and I think that probably happens to everyone.
---
Green Thumb for life!
---
You can sell Mutfruit and Tato for 2 caps each. Plant a ton of these!  
---
I've been surviving on Corn Soup since the beginning. Also provides food and water, with some extra AP regen. Will try watermelons since they don't require boiled water.
---
My daily "Ritual of the Green Thumb" goes like this:
---
\- Go to the Overseer's Camp;
---
\- Follow the river down south, picking all the Bloodleafs and Snaptail Reeds (also all the Soot Flowers near the river, but there aren't much);
---
\- When I get to Green Country lodges, go to the left and start picking all the Soot Flowers growing among the houses;  
---
\- Now back to the river, continue picking Bloodleafs and Snaptail Reeds (Glowing Fungus also if you want some Radaway);  
---
\- Go all the way to Hillfork Hotdogs, then left and continue doing that;  
---
\- Around Billings Homestead, get away from the river and start picking all Soot Flowers you can see all the way to the Nuka Cola factory.  
---
Back to my Camp, with Chemist and maxed out Super Duper equipped, craft a ton of Healing Salve. If I got some Firecaps along the way, also craft some Disease Cure. Harvest all my Mutfruit and Tato crops, fast travel to nearby train station: profit.
---
You'll find very little to no danger following that route, so no ammo waste. I can get around 800 caps (with maxed out Hard Bargain) in about 10-15 minutes. I've also been selling Healing Salve and Disease Cure at good rates.
---
Never seen that myself, been to several SBQ fights where more than one of use is using a gatling plasma...
---
They usually end with a big dead bat, lol
---
Heh, thats awesome. I love hearing about these sort of things. I have just returned, so i'm hoping to come across this sort of thing.
---
Rapture. 
---
That's what it looks like when you get taken.
---
Admitting that the game has flaws doesn't change that you generalized critics of the game as haters that don't play it lol. You can argue that's not what you were trying to do, but nothing about the statement "I see most of the people that hate on the game don't even play it" indicates that you're only talking about only trolls, it just seems like you're talking about people that criticize the game in general. 
---
Moving on, it's somewhat amusing to me that you criticized my use of a car crash analogy, but now you're making a war analogy lol. We live in the digital age, you can find vast amounts of gameplay footage of basically every single video game that exists. Obviously you're not getting the exact same experience by just watching other people play it, but you can honestly get a really idea of how the game looks/and plays, especially if you're watching long format videos. I also don't think you can argue that someone could be watching a stream of a game and watch as the streamer encounters some sort of serious problem with the game and say "Well that's kinda BS if it happens frequently". Bugs, poor performance, and questionable design choices aren't things that a person has to personally experience personally to criticize. It's also important to keep in mind that some new controversy/mistake was coming to light literally like once a week following the launch of the game, several of which were pretty well publicized and only served to further people's budding perception of Bethesda being an incompetent/lazy dev. 
---
100% there's plenty of people that despise the game simply because of the controversy and I agree that those people stupid, but I see A LOT of people on this sub dismissing basically any negative reaction to the game as trolling, when that simply isn't the case. A lot of the people that dislike the game have actually played it, and a lot of the one's that haven't played it dislike it because they saw the objectively unacceptable state the game was in and said "Yeahhh this looks pretty shady". Again, the best possible way for communities and games to thrive is through logic and cooperation throughout. It's hard for devs to get legitimate feedback when everyone is just butting heads and screaming at each other, we gotta find some sort of middle ground and build from there. 
---
I've made the point I wanted to make, rather or not people agree with it is neither here nor there, there's no point in a back and forth debate. With that being said, have a nice day, I hope you continue finding enjoyment in the game for the foreseeable future.
---
I need people to stop putting their dang radshowers in front of the entrance to your vending, or anywhere near your spawn point.
---
If I lose even 1 rad to your inconsiderate design, I don't care what you have, you lost my business.
---
I don’t understand.  No cards are effective, passive or otherwise, unless equipped.
---
I don't hate the game, or Bethesda, or Todd. I did pre ordered the game, and considering the state in which it has been released it was not worth €60. 
---
Hatred was not justified, but most of the criticisms were correct.
---
Thanks to fallout 76 I decided that I won't pre order any more games, and I will try not buy a game again until it's discounted (or at least reviewed).
---
All this without hatred, they simply had a credit of trust, now they are like everyone else.
---
Peace
---
It’s recommended that you are level 50 or over but not required. I have seen plenty of people down there at level 30-50. Just expect to die some. You respawn right in the control room next to the event so just grab some teammates and get some.
---
I found out an important detail regarding land mines; if you place more than 3, the first one will explode! I blew myself up at least 10 times before I figured that out.
---
Calibrated shocks are my number one need. Besides, the excavator is a pickup truck.
---
I'm on PS4 but I made over 250 diffusers last night
---
I do not even know what to do with the money, I have the blueprints I wanted, the furniture of whitepspring does not interest me, I have the plans of serums that I need (and there are too many sellers of the rest of serums) ... and unfortunately I can not find vendors of weapons you need for PC caps.
---
And that I do not look for complex weapons, but if any aae or aafr to be possible with weight reduction, basically by qol
---
I see more interesting a system of legendary personalization (asking for cash flows for example and specific pieces of scrap enemies) or a voucher system after making events that give you the opportunity to at least choose the type of weapon (heavy, rifle , energy ... something).
---
The limit of caps was made precisely to limit the dupers and that some were too rich and others too poor ... and even some have multiple accounts with alters and hundreds of weapons too good to pick up dust.
---
You’d be a good battlefield teammate
---
You’re not alone, I’m lvl 130 and haven’t seen one either.
---
This is not a new phenomenon. In 1986 a French archaeologist discovered a previously unknown chamber in the Lascaux caves, which are famous for neolithic paintings. There was a depiction of a figure walking  out of the caves in an angry manner, and behind that another figure asking if it could have his stuff.
---
* Mini games for players .. tennis, golf, pool, darts

---
The world may never know !!
---
They really need to bump up the amount of scrip you can aquire every day.  150 is way too low.
---
On release day, I was at the first Overseer's workbench, lvl 2, crafting armor as the quest indicated when a lvl 10 player started smacking me as they wanted to use the same workbench urgently. When they finished, they run back to their nearby camp which had all workbenches...
---
I think if the opened non pvp "workshops" where players could set up shops/vendor hubs with others thatd be cool. I know the servers cant really manage too many camps so maybe having them just be like vending areas(maybe inside the white spring) or at red rocket stops. Just spit ballin here.
---
You'd have to be a fucking moron to not realise that was a joke. Why do people get so offended lol.
---
Where exactly? :)
---
Y/Triangle... Not X/Square
---
And by non pvp workshops I mean keep the other workshops but make new ones completely. I enjoy having people challenge my workshops...
---
Amusing story, I assume you are using a sniper Vats crit build? Would you mind sharing it? I've just returned to the game this weekend, so i'm trying to find one I like. Your one with those mutations seems to fit the bill if you're willing. Either way, thanks for sharing the story.
---
I agree completly but its not true, that every MMO had such a bad start. Guild Wars 2 had a pretty good start, even got loved by gaming sites right from the start.
---
FO76 still needs a lot of work and content, but I enjoyed it even after release for what it was and looking forward to later content updates.
---
Butcher Bounty, Pharma Farma, Cap Collector, Scrounger, Can Do! ; ALL work like this. I think I got them all...
---
Idk. I stopped playing, never made a post about it. Want to get back in but the lack of endgame content turned me off. There’s a lot of us on Reddit, good and bad.
---
Haha, sorry mate xD
---
At least you know now!
---
I took over some workshops couple days ago to farm some acid. As usual i got disconnected. Checked the Social Menu and was able to get back on the same Server. All the Extractors and Power Generators we’re still there. I claimed the Workshop again and was even able to loot the extractors.
---
One of the main reasons I don't play on survival is because of the leader board.
---
Now you want more stats added, no thanks from me.
---
Ive got multiple cards on different levels, for example demo Expert 5, 4 &amp; 3, gunsmith 5, 4, &amp; 3,  or the one that gives bonus damage to glowing ones on lvl 3, 2 &amp; 1... I know that feel 
---
I'd also like to discard my 300 pharma farma cards or reshuffle them or something.
---
Im lvl 170 and it starts to get really cluttered... can't imagine how it looks on lvl 300+
---
GG man, it’s been a while since I’ve played.
---
I like it but it just spreads people too thin.  Another big problem is there isn't a server notice so unless you happen to check your map you miss it.  I also think the play mechanics are weird.  The A,B,C rooms are huge and the animals you have to defend are weak.  It's just too much territory to defend unless you have a dedicated group using mics.  Also the Alpha being 3 star makes people lose sight of the mission, they just go for the kill to get the legendary.  Right now its just a waste of ammo and armor durability.
---
Honestly it's a good event but they just need to smooth it out a bit better and make it more user friendly.  I think the imposter fight is kinda the same.
---
I wonder how long the last for, itd be cool to revisit the same server days later by happenstance and still see you workshop chugging away(or decimated by raiders)
---
Even at max sensitivity it feels way too low for me i see pc players able to turn and move with their mouses quickly but at max on controller it feels so low 😩
---
Yep, got it! Thank you!
---
New swamp thing looks great
---
Please tell your in game name, so I can add you and buy some. 
---
I'm doing Project Paradise regularly but I'm only getting coats and bear arms.
---
Or add me if you want to, my IGN is kastrus2000
---
Thanks in advance pal!
---
Reduced price to sell... I really don't want this item personally..
---
How is adrenal reaction bugged?
---
Agreed. I had a low level guy shoot me when I entered a building. I’ve done that myself  so I just walked away. I’m talking about intentional attacks
---
I legit have an hour long rad storm saved to my YouTube to fall asleep to, just the eerie combination of echoing thunder, Geiger click, and ominous bass. I consider it part of my character role play to stand by a window during one, maybe play a game or read my notes, just like a rainy day IRL
---
Stabilized Perk is the reason for this. Everyone will assume P.A= Heavy Weapons since there is a perk for wearing P.A and using Heavy Weapons.
---
And generally Melee is weaker if you're in P.A and P.A is just too noisy and doesn't have chameleon to Sneak attack except if you sneak initiate
---
   
---
Morgantown High School is my go to place. Canteen and sports hall. Plus all the Plastic pumpkins about.
---
Server hop is the easiest and most logical solution
---
Have the decency to give the guy a chance, eh?
---
Maybe not the best locations, but I usually try to make a run through Morgantown High School and Watoga High School for all the plastic dinnerware and pumpkins.
---
You have to fall from higher than a jump, or try a jet pack
---
Same lol every time i get a join invite i simply laugh to myself "no today buddy"
---
It's also great for literally farming adhesive, via vegetable starch, and for brewing.
---
The cat house east of Morgantown is my favourite, all those feeding bowls and cute cats
---
Yup me too
---
Hi!
---
LordVulpius is the ign, and Ill be online 4 hours (so at 18:00 in my zone)
---
My camp is on the cliff, near the pharma.
---
Survival mode has nothing to do with skill, most people just try to get a kill without their enemy noticing. I attack workshops too and I can still wreck a team of 4 lv 150-250s solo, no need to run into survival mode to pvp, I wouldn't want to play pve with invisivle campers everywhere and I can't pvp on purpose because you'll only see top tier players, which probably are well prepared in their camp traps
---
Theyve already said they are gonna let us decorate, theyll never let you drop items, youll asign them to shelves but theyll still be in your stash.
---
I crash every time I enter the elevator.
---
no step on snack
---
True, happens all the time in World of Tanks.
---
I’ve already completed that challenge elsewhere, but there’s so much chaos at that event, that I can never get to anybody in time. Lol. It’s almost impossible for me.
---
You may need the advanced Power connectors plan first, could be mistaken though
---
There are already 4 and 5 star stuff... Those two places are reserved for mods that counts toward legendary effects.
---
I use max stealth with a hazmat suit. I can usually kill 4-5 enemies before being noticed. Run, crouch, repeat. ☺
---
The last couple days i played a lot with my wife. We stayed on one server for like 7 - 8 hours. We got 2 times the message that these worlds will shut down in 20 minutes for maintenance. So i guess after the „maintenance“ the server will be „fresh“
---
You are not the first second third or fourth person I've seen with this post. Also it happened to me too so no judgement lol. Its been this way forever, just not super intuitive.
---
yeah it is, i changed mines higher, i guess its a matter of getting used to it.
---
Run West-Tek, grab all the laser weapons. Equip Scrapper for a fair amount of Plastic.
---
As far as I can see every NPC in the game has the perk 'ImmuneToRadiation'.
---
For real, the only good thing is that I’ve an extra 3 points to spend now.
---
Whatever encourages more fighting. Removing the leader board entirely would just drive all the PVPers back to Adventure to contest workshops. I sat at Whitesprings AFK in the stash for close to 10 minutes yesterday and no one even took a pot shot at me. I was number 1 with over 10k points... something needs to change.
---
Edited
---
Yup.
---
Bicycles... With Baskets that act as mini-Stashes.
---
Same, it’s a guaranteed haul.
---
Yes, these are half wits just using the fact that Bethesda made the screwed up decision that just because you own a Public workshop, that it's open season on you. Out right a dumb decision.
---
I think it should be something like... If they don't claim the workshop is say 20 mins time, then they become wanted. Bethesda wanted there to be contention with the workshops, but instead they just put a loop hole for ass-hats to kill others and avoid the wanted status. IF INITIATE AGGRESSION AND YOU KILL SOMEONE, YOU SHOULD GAIN A WANTED STATUS! I don't see ANY way this would be acceptable behavior in any form of a real world. If they want real PVP well then why are they hiding in a PVP loop hole instead of just initiating PVP with the associated Wanted status?
---
I use to use them quite a bit in previous Fallouts, kiting enemies over them as I back peddle, but I've found them useless here; an enemy steps near it and starts the timer but is well past it by the time it explodes.. shouldn't it be more instantaneous?
---
Meh, I'm pretty typical. I think your post is still valid though. The number of people who love to announce their quitting is way too high.
---
They said near release about "Legendary" players and perks, so the odds of a level cap increase are slim to none.
---
Far more likely to be a "Prestige" system, like in COD, where we reset to level 1 (keeping value in low level weapons, instead of adding higher leveled ones), and gain some additional benefit from doing so.
---
Thanks for the replies everyone. Expected to be roasted for my ignorance. Thanks for the links as well. I am looking at them and will give it another go. I have been a gamer for damn near ever, but this game sort of threw me. Just never felt so out of place and like there was no progression for leveling up.
---
There [aren't that many good places](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1274564123) beyond WS and West Tec since a couple of patches. Many locations have been probably nerfed as, for example, Watoga Clinic and Harper's Ferry was almost always guaranteed 1+ legendary. Steakhouse was also good chance, not anymore.
---
Yup, great community. Probably the best thing to come out of the awful launch for the game was the fact it is now deemed "uncool" which means we have way less toxic kiddies in the playerbase. Would love for that spicy memelord Internet Historian to continue pumping out videos to keep the horde at bay!
---
No perks are passive
---
Oh. Not very much at all. They are very common.
---
I got 4  3 star drops yesterday from one if my server hops.  It was a lot of fun.  Glad it's working for you too!
---
Also an underwater Punji board in the rock cave at spruce knob
---
No, PC platform. Only two things I think aren't as good: The performance and hardware usage in that game and the fact that there is no iconic Preston Garvey telling me that the valuable resources are only scrap and junk.
---
While I really like this game, for its atmosphere and because I'm a fan of this dark setting, I have to admit that I can't remember when I played such an broken game. And its not even the 99999999 bugs which ruin my fluid gameplay ( can't even play for 3 straight hours without restarting the game because of being stuck fucking everywhere) seriously guys, this game runs like shit. On my I7 and 6gb gtx 1060 I barerely get constant framerates on high settings @1080p.
---
Think about the witcher 3. The quests, the npcs, the graphic, the beautiful world. I'm talking about 60 frames on average @ ultra. I mean come on how long is Beth at this game? Did any of you guys try to play the NV steam version? Yes it's a pile of broken junk. Even today, how old is this game? Fucking 10 years old and the new steam version is a bugged fuck up? Yes I love the fallout franchise, yes I like F76 and enjoying it like 60%.
---
But fuck Todd, fuck Bethesda and I will never ever give them my money. Fuck it I have all recent titles as GOTY's, there are enough mods that I can play these titles until the end of time.
---
But please stop acting like Beth/Todd is doing you guys a favour. They DGAF about you guys. There is no love in their games, its just about getting most of your money with minimal effort. Nothing more
---
Best game of *all time?* Dude, no. This game's good, but not that ultra-good-best level. The prize of best will forever be... **drumroll**
---
1. **Metal Gear Solid 3, Hotline Miami, Sims 3, etc, etc.**
---
I've got good news for you.  
---
Full character resets are coming this year.
---
People have already mentioned Morgantown Highschool. Another tip is that laser rifles give plastic when you scrap them.
---
they are the worst since they can give you a disease that some how makes guns do 25% less damage. 
---
Fucking Mirelurk Magic right there
---
You might have missed something about the silly rules. If you own a public work shop, you are an allowed target ANY where on the map without gaining a wanted status. this is why I think it's a dumb choice.
---
I would like to factions take hold in the wasteland.  I really like the badge system in the ever upwards quest.  I collect badges and then get to choose which items I want out of the machine.  It takes a lot of the rng out of the picture.  I would like to see the legendary player system allow us to have non damage passive perk card slots.  Things like lock picking, hacking, crafting, etc.  This would give actual meaning to advancing past level 50.
---
You should be able to join a faction by doing quests.  Then events happen that only members of the faction can participate in (similar to enclave events).  It would be a lot of fun to play as a responder and defend a supply drop from players in the raider faction.  This would be more of an organic type of pvp than the "survival server".  Play as a raider and have a mission to steal tech data from the BOS camp defended by BOS players in the faction.
---
I would also like to see tasks and missions you have to complete in order to advance in rank. You would earn "badges, commendations, etc." that you could then use to purchase faction specific paint, weapons, camp decorations, mods, etc.  Some of the mods could be adding 4th and 5th star faction specific mods to weapons and armor. Being able to add defensive mods to armor or offensive capabilities to weapons would be a lot of fun. There really wouldn't be a need to raise the item levels.
---
Imagine if all the BOS items could be earned through rank and quest completion instead of random rng?  The paint, the jumpsuit, the bomber coat?  The responder paint and cosmetics currently in the atom shop would have been really fun to earn in game to show off your status and rank within that faction.
---
Honestly out of all the recent DLC the ever upwards was the best for this reason.  It gave us lots to do and tangible rewards we could choose.  The other nice thing is that Bethesda can continue to add new stuff to the faction loot pool to keep us playing and grinding away.
---
Anyhow....just my 2 caps.
---
Everyone saying deep pocketed and no one mentioning WWR lol. I run 5 pieces of WWR and if I take them off my total weight jumps by about 200. I can't even get in my fully modded excavator anymore without being overencumbered - my regular armor has more effective carry capacity. That's your answer.
---
I’ve put weapons skins on the ones I can and renamed all my weapons to stop me from scrapping anything by accident which is def worth doing for future, as for duped weapons I’ve no idea how the machine would know which gun was the original and which was the copy, the duper probably doesn’t even know which is the original gun anymore it’s been going on so long. Sry to hear about your AAE though
---
The bigger problem is the damage bug you'll likely run into with it...  basically all auto weapons currently since patch 9 are susceptible to the damage bug (where enemies seem to heal themselves, hits don't register on the server).
---
If people are trying to run this game on potato PCs its on them, not you.
---
How dare you assume my oxegen intake method! What if I'm a robot or like a fish? Does what fish do count as inhaling?... wait what am I talking about?
---
Agree. Also some workshops seem pointless by the rate of production (junk, black titanium, wood at George's junk) that I found it faster to farm those things than wait for the resource generators.
---
I’m working a trade show until Thursday. I’ll be playing all weekend though
---
I've only seen 5 since the launch,and they disappear very fast,wanted to get some great pics,and had zero time,sun came out,...dammit
---
Anything you built (for better or worse) stays until the server resets, or someone takes your camp and blenders all the things you brought
---
The more things you dump down, the more expensive it is for someone to take over
---
The funny thing is that it's now probably the least buggy and most non exploitable Bethesda game...
---
close by. vault tech uni. loads more plastic dinerware
---
Real easy - mothman omelets..
---
agree with you on gw2 theres a lot gw2 got right that i think 76 should have mimiced.
---
I must be the only one of this subreddit that much preferred the npc aspect of fallout 4.  I havent played 76 since a week after release but the severe micro managing and constantly having to eat and drink every 20 minutes turned me off.      76 feels more like a eating simulator Than an actual game I could run around and explore.      It's hard to explore and enjoy it when your eye is on your water intake and you are constantly trying to think of where to find the next food while at the same time worrying about the rads you get from it and then having to find radaway.
---
&gt;BSG will simply not eliminate PVP in Adventure mode no matter what.
---
And there is our problem..
---
Fyi  share your image links in the description not the title
---
Your last two are broken posts mate
---
Ya the amount of people I've heard bitching about the game and its features, only to respond with "no" when asked if they've played it, is stupidly high. People are way too reliant on reviews nowadays, and also way too impatient when waiting 4 fixes.
---
That's a fantastic location and C.A.M.P. build! Very homely.
---
Being able to once again melee hit small flying enemies with VATS?
---
Of course that would be better, but they won't do it because it provides filler content to level. Read these forums, a ton of people here feel the need to level up to level 700 or so. But the game doesn't have enough actual content to support that, so they broke every perk into a requirement to level it and relevel it several times, instead of just having you get to level 200 or so and then cease to get any benefits. The way they have it now you can level to around level 1100 before the game stops having anything "new" to give and that gives people that want to play (and buy atoms) a pretend sense of continuing to power up and become more versatile long after the game is done having any new things to give.
---
I was gonna get mad, but this is actually a really well thought out solution. It keeps many different typea of players appeased. I myself would probably use my camp stash (for lack of better phrasing) as a donations box, and then use my personal stash (current stashbox) as just that, a personal stash. I can see the players that like to play as raiders enjoying this also.
---
wow, you're just going to build that CAMP and not even say howdy?
---
Bug fixes are GOOD IDEAS
---
Please inform the development team about this. As per the other replies, you can deduce that some players are abusing your workshop implementation to farm caps off other players.
---
It is not fun to be in Pacifist mode and being forced to PVP suddenly just because you're in the vicinity while the workshop gets contested; and then getting 1-shotted while simply passing by, using a work-bench, or while doing one of those workshop defense events.
---
You say you stumbled on this.  Did you just think of it or actually test it?
---
Do not go into survival mode. This is where the toxic Reddit trolls live under their bridges.
---
It makes me nervous. I dont want blackbird coming back lmao
---
I scrip 'em too. It's only viable until one gets decent legendary's
---
Bethesda could give you skins for all the creatures in Appalachia. I can't imagine it's that difficult to give players a costume/skin to wear that would change your appearance to ghoul or a gay deathclaw. Lol.  It would certainly add to the role play aspect of the game.
---
As far as playing as raiders....well they just need to add faction related events and rewards to the game.
---
Improving my characters, meeting new people in-game and the grind because it’s not too over the top and can be rewarding for your efforts 👍🏼
---
&gt;y
---
Thanks - have seen them up to 1k...
---
I've done a few mule trips for moving character gear to/from alts on Xbox, and there are multiple people on trading discords which have a trust rating high enough to do it aswell (mainly because they've been trading since 76 released and they have every item in existance with no reason to steal).
---
That's the FO76 Porn parody right?
---
For my gf and me it is the only way to play fallout in coop. My gf is a totally fallout fan so she is a bit annoyed that the story is so flat but she like the building and finding cool places.
---
I like the loot and the world
---
the removal of ALL leaderboards and player or camp markers on the map in Survival mode..
---
I'm sure this might remove the fun for some players, but I enjoy the tension of exploring without knowing where others are
---
I find my vats always targets the land mines....annoying when you are trying to set up traps.
---
I carry Orbital Strike Beacons.. and a LOT of them.... ONLY for PVP'ers.
---
Scorched in PA is a pretty rad idea. Pardon the pun. Legendary versions to wondering the wasteland! 👌🏼
---
Yeah,  the time delay is vastly unrealistic. They did it for players (real mines would suuuuck) but it makes them useless in PVE...
---
Except when you remote detonate them. Because the first mine will blow up instantly if you place a third, if you have prep time, you can place two next to each other, get back, trigger an enemy, and as it runs over the mines, drop a third. Boom, first one goes off, also detonating the second.
---
Best skins in the game and yes, i consider them rare.
---
I saw conflicting posts on wether or not that was ever fixed. when you're shooting scorched at range while they're flying is when the accuracy is worth having. it would be nice if we had a way to verify the perks are working or not,
---
i really want this game to get better, but you should never keep your faith in an AAA company. they are not your friend. this applies to all developers, not just bethesda.
---
That was changed on the last update, you can now only be attacked while in the workshop area.
---
Kind of makes them useless.  Grenades often are delayed which allows enemies to run away as well.
---
Anything with super mutants ÷ scrapper perk.  Just pick up the laser rifles and super sledges and scrap em.  I get 10 plastic a rifle and 3 a sledge.  It also will net you a fair amount of steel and rubber as well as a few random other bits like glass.
---
They’ve made it so the griefers and lightweights will spend more time in adventure mode.   Either they get their asses kicked in survival or want more caps.  I can’t tell you how many times someone in Adventure has tried to pick a fight with me the last 2-3 weeks.  Sometimes I will engage but most of the time I don’t as it’s a waste of my time.  If I want to PvP I head over to survival mode.
---
People are too stubborn to play Wasteland 2. I love Fallout 76, but Wasteland 2 feels like the most authentic Fallout game I've played since NV.
---
Collecting outfits and getting the armor and weapons that makes that perfect build that suits my play style (Vamp-Vanguard)
---
Ok what is WWR
---
Post it in the description, not the title.
---
definitely man. one can like someone and despise their one bad action at the same time. or dislike someone and commend one good action at the same time.
---
Ye green thumb is useful. I'm a carnivore, so only use for razor gain and corn for Nuka shine.  And ofcoarse flux 4 the batty bullets. Otherwise just eat the flesh of whatever I obliterate, no cooking required.
---
interesting tactic... I assume there's some distance limitations on the third mine triggering the first one?
---
&gt; very MMO has had a disastrous launch. every, single. one. 
---
People seem to forget just how TERRIBLE WoW was during the first half or even all of vanilla. That game was a total shit show to the point Blizzard was giving away MONTHS of free time just to keep people from leaving.
---
Wendigo Cave always has a couple of them lurking around down in the caverns
---
A small springy enemy monkey that's 3* legendary, extremely hard to kill, and drops a legendary Fatman named monkey bidness?

Visitors will spawn where you placed your camp box down originally, yes.
---
Got it way early on, its been my core on melee.
---
Currently trying to decide between, The Gutter, VAMP Ax w/ spike mod, and my All Rise....
---
One is going to go.
---
What platform? Crafted a set of 20. 30. 40, 50 to level an alt. Thinking about crafting and stocking in my vending machines.
---
Renaming helps a lot, my main guns and armour are all named  "Don't sell - [Name]", it's helped more times than I can count now.
---
What do you guys think?
---
Survival Adventure Mode you should be able to highlight only the people that invite you to a team see all of them that are in that team and also highlight them on map (displayed like the wanted bounty but their gametag easier to spot) and visually on your display so you can see if anyone is crouched down in the bushes even if they're camouflage. Showing thier gamertag above their head (the same way your Mic icon gives you away when active camo) This would only active for the time an invite is sent to the decline time(small window but if your getting spammed invite definitely enough time to think of a plan (i use cars doesnt enter pvp if your detonating a car lol) or hop server.
---
No more crouching hidden tiger
---
I love the burrows - I play it at least every few days.
---
Well, damn, that would’ve been useful information from the start. Lol Thanks.
---
Alright this one ill allow
---
Instead of just downvoting like others, let me address your misconceptions. 
---
1) "0 improvements been made to missing endgame" 
---
Six months ago there's was literally nothing for a level 100+ to legitimately do. Queen runs cost more than they were (and are) worth, grinding plans and recipes was tedious and boring (essentially server hopping) and helping out lowbies loses its charm after the 50th mute that doesn't understand the bag you're shooting at is a gift. Now there's high level events to grind for high level, and because of how varied everything is, the new game experience is enhanced, a plucky lvl 40 can pop into free range and get their ass handed to them like WTF or a comfy level 75 think they'd gotten pretty tough to get shit on in encryptid by gutsys. The game now has its veterans and its newbies. Its baddasses and its cannon fodder. 
---
2) burrows and arktos. Neither of these dungeons were meant to replace "endgame" nukes and activities, they were made to flesh out more areas. To give more exploratory value and depth to neglected areas. Let's be real, the mire had nothing going for it except checking the Harper's ferry vendor until they added the burrows and purveyor. Arktos is a low level area yet high level event. Its an intro event for lowbies to meet high grade players, Johnny vault boy meeting lone wanderer. 
---
3) booze, dude throw some booze recipes into a vendor and watch the profits. I literally had to build a third vendor for food booze and chems. There is such a sector of the player base that has built some version of bar that is be curious to know the purchase rate of the bar set. I know the recipes and I still visit biv just to keep my store stocked. 
---
4) item trading. The point that using trading forums is more efficient is kinda common knowledge. If someone wants that one specific item (the market for bloodied explosive, or AAE weapons) they'll check, but if they're casual, or bored, or new, or just looking for a deal, then checking player vendors makes the most sense. Forum vendors won't waste their time with a 1 star bloodied, but a lowbie will. It doesn't have to be a god roll to have value to someone. Fuck one guy bought out my bar, dropped 200lbs of my stash weight and I earned 5k from it. 
---
5) developers are aware of the solutions players create, and try to integrate then into their games, even if inferior. Rather than paying market price for the armor pieces I've been looking for as a vendor, I've been finding them at bargains and stocking up. (I run my mule as a "weight loss clinic" stocking weight reduction affix legendaries. Ammo on my main is reduced 100%.) Not every player users trade forums, or is even serious enough to bother googling what the meta is. This game is very much a casual survival experience. 
---
All in all, our standards were not met at launch and ate the continuously moving goalpost of the development team. Theyre making progress, but we gamers are a fickle lot.
---
At the very least there could be one skin from each of the previous raider factions in Apalachia, and since the excavator armour is getting Raider-themed skins I think it would be neat to have some civilian or even salvaged and steampunkish skins too
---
I get a lot from scrapping the ton of golf balls at The Whitespring. You can also bulk the cork that you get from scrapping the golf balls and sell them to the vendorbots.
---
Still bugs?  JFC it takes like 5 minutes for everything to load once you log in.  I was almost killed the other day at the golf club getting attacked by invisible ghouls or the ones that hover off the ground that you can’t kill right away.  So annoying.  Fix that shit Bugthesda!
---
agreed, though I can still get some use from grenades if an enemy is somewhat stationary, but mines are something I just sell now :(
---
Lol, I said to my bro , do you think some of these paints will become rare of some sort? I didn’t think it would but the next day they took the hot rod paint away and hasn’t been back since.
---
I want to have the blackbird paint but at the same time I’d feel bad for people who got it in the beginning haha.
---
Same goes for the rare masks from the event, will that also come back? :0
---
lol no one is going to spawn at a station if your sat there. you need to move away slightly
---
&gt;This applies to any ~~sub on Reddit~~ public forum on the internet. They must have a dramatic exit no matter what.
---
FTFY
---
I think bikes would be pretty cool and lore friendly.  Imagine all the cool ramps and tracks you could build for players to mess around with.  Not to mention it would be fun to travel the roads in the wasteland at a little faster pace than walking or running.
---
Anyone know if there's a fix coming? Really would like to use my anti armor gatling. 😞
---
I was gunna cop them when they first came out but I thought it would stay in Atom Shop. Since then I haven’t seen many people with them. I do fancy the Black Bird paint though!
---
Not sure about VATS, but I remember seeing some posts here saying that the bolt does count as reloading
---
Nocturnal would be a solid legendary if it didn't give you negative stats in the daytime.  As it is I would say it's arguably one of the worst legendary prefixes in game.
---
I’m sorry there is no point even if the thing hadn’t reset I couldn’t do it anyway. Sorry
---
Its actually 20x not 10x.  A gatling gun without speedy receiver has a fire rate of 20, with speedy it goes to 25.  The fire rate is rounds/10 seconds so 9.1 for the 50 cal.  I tested out the gatling fire rate, its worse than people think it is.  When they fixed Martial Artist speeding up the gatling gun, and buffed other heavy weapons, the gatling gun became the lowest DPS heavy gun.
---
I agree! Put that shit off to the side.
---
&gt; No, they aren't going to let you play as raiders.
---
If the NPC rumors about the fall season are true, I think you will be able to be a raider.
---
Hey thanks for the input, I'll update the main thread, here -  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba3oyb/technical_data_hunting_some_tips_and_data/  
---
Its good news actually as that means the %Chance I have on the main thread is still valid.  
---
 Paint dropped sounds right, your next drop should be T-60 BOS Knight Officer, the one after, T-60 BOS Paladin, is in my opinion the best looking one,  I've got Bos Elder, and its a little underwhelming. :)
---
Some people just wanna be Queen for the Day
---
I don't think the rechambering counts, I think it's the actual reloading animation that triggers the effect.
---
It should work in VATS though.
---
In my experience, a good portion of dramatic exits are just to see if people will try and stop them to make them feel like they're important or something. They're not *actually* quitting. Similar to how some people *claim* they're leaving this sub, but you'll still see them posting days later about how much FO76 sucks.
---
Some people are too damn sensitive.  I got caught in a similar situation actually defending a guys camp under attack from some radrats and he gets caught in my shotgun spray.  Dude then runs at me with his gauntlet (while I am fighting off rad rats attacking HIS camp) and swipes me a couple of times so I blasted him.  Comes back again and I blast him again.  I was ready to buy a couple of things but said fuck it.  He’s lucky I didn’t decide to level his camp.   Why people get so pissy about this I have no idea.
---
I'm surprised you could place 10 vault boy statues after putting all those letters there, they take up so much budget space
---
Very neat building. I like the stop 'n' shop principle and nice design :D
---
And here they were, just a group of innocent married men getting a night out on their own from their huge beastly wives and crying minions at home, and you gotta go and ruin it for them.  No wonder they were angry!
---
Very good points but I think op was referring to level cap being raised? Not money cap raised
---
 its retro futuristic traditional apocolyptic yet unique vibe that "just works" 
---
the miss nanny that tells you commercialized bedtime stories in the middle of a radiated hellscape  is an example of part of that vibe, the music the story the power armor all of it, none of it amazing on its own and the gameplay could be improved by a lot but its still my favorite place on the internet. 
---
the fact that "praise the lord and pass the ammunition" came on and started playing just as I snuck into a church and realized ghouls were waking up all around me. 
---
specific ok super specific power armor wearing laserweilding radiation zombie slaying while listening to old man nose is dead. thats literally the best I got for you I am a mystery to myself.
---
There are plenty of 200s out there.  I’m currently at 198.  
---
Highest I’ve seem was a person at 380.
---
I went under the bridge and took a photo. That was accepted.
---
I didn't, but I did inherit an old install.
---
Reinstalling the game seems to have fixed this issue. :)
---
Ya, buddy of mine on his first day playing ended up stumbling onto the silo just as it was opening up. He was all "Uhhhh guys.... wtf is goin on... is, is that a missile?" Then he built his camp there with hopes of catching it during launch so he could attempt to surf on it.
---
Ok
---
Trading on here keeps me coming back. Got quite a few contacts who buy amno from me, so I'm always grinding for mats and crafting. Other people probs wouldn't find it fun, but I enjoy the rewards I get for all my hard work and it's something to do.
---
Once in a while, if I have an extra weapon with some power, I track down players under level 20 and give it to them.
---
Great Idea! Almost so good of an idea you know Bethesda won’t even consider it
---
Most MMO launches are smooth since 2010, in fact these days most MMO launches are 100% stables
---
\&gt; what bethesda did with 76 was a bold attempt at something very different  from the current crop of games on the market. the youtuber crowd was  just brutal to them 
---
I just have a issue blaming youtubers for fo76 poor sales, Fo76 is a good game, but after trying to convince my friends to buy it by streaming, let's just say they are well deserving on criticism ,
---
It's pretty simple though
---
Create a 2x2 floating box. Use wooden half-walls and a metal roof. Put your "public" stash in the center of that room. Whenever you want to use it, remove the roof and put it back on when you're done. Players in adventure mode will have no possibility of getting in, and enemies will never aggro on the walls to destroy them.
---
It was an odd issue: I inherited an old game client that was saying that it was up to date.
---
I reinstalled the game and all seems well now - kind of a bummer that running a validity check on the game files couldn't fix the issue: it takes a long time to download this game...
---
you aint got no leg Lt dan!
---
I would rather have a 200lb account wide mailbox than an additional 200lb in stash...
---
It used to be an issue during scorched earth events but they've mostly fixed it.
---
Morgantown High School and Watoga High School
---
I think server lag is correct.  At the first vendor camp I ever visited, as I was perusing the camp inventory, I turned around to check out the footsteps I heard coming up behind me.  when I turned back around, the camp vanished . . . just like the "Flying Dutchman."
---
Bonus is that mostly after campfire you can turn in the bug collector daily with what you just picked up
---
I have found plenty of explosive and two shot weapons but never a TSE. Every time I see someone with one, I think "wow they probably duped it or got it from someone who duped it."
---
I would prefer bugs and balance were higher priority rather than having most of the outlandish things people ask for on reddit...
---
I fully support this thread...
---
Don’t be absurd 😂 
---
I just want the deathclaw on the island to always have a pink tutu on and be holding a single balloon. Is that so much?
---
I got a blood bug and bloatfly at Mac's farm.
---
Yes. This is actually the way Bethesda figured people would do it.
---
I wish they'd make the difficulty of the events scale with the level and number of people present in the zone. You should even be able to solo it for diminished rewards.
---
Just watch out for REALLY high numbers, my record is 376 Plans lulz
---
Its not like we expect them to just shit out our ideas in a few weeks, i want to play as ghouls and super mutants as part of like the next DLC wave after Wastelanders or beyond.
---
Pretty sure it was said to be a lost cause a while ago
---
Jokes are supposed to be funny. So, it is a very bad joke post.
---
Jokes are subjective
---
will there ever be....
---
..bug fixes
---
Have run "scan and repair" several times after game lockups - never got any reported errors.  Am beginning to wonder if Nvidia's "Game Experience" overlay might be the problem.  May have to disable it and see if Fallout crashes diminish.
---
Oh I can 100% verify that is isn't applying the armour pen, it still works the same as it did in FO4 and datamining shows it wasn't changed, however I do agree that the accuracy bonus is pretty nice as a heavy main myself. Maybe try some extra heavy gunner points though? As you'd probably aim down sight most of the time anyway
---
\&gt;Xbox Chat.
---
everything makes sense now.
---
We need an increase to Camp strength before something like this, then you could actually “raid”  camps. But I do think it should be a survival mode thing. Make Survival Rust please :)
---
Unless nobody apart from the author finds it funny.
---
 if you get nothing drink radaway. Also you can only get one per session so if you get something server hop even if you cure it you won't be able to get another till you hop.
---
Atom shop items cannot be placed at other ppls Camps :(
---
INT effects xp gained.
---
That's the bad part. I had it renamed and still hit the button.
---
Nvm, I just actually looked at your build. I highly recommend points some points into adrenaline in Agility instead OR class freak as you have a few mutations and those downsides do add up
---

Ya pretty sure the nukes are made "movie style" like the guns. People have grown to expect these things to look, sound and act a certain way due to Hollywood, and if they behaved as they did in real life, people would think that it's either wrong, boring or annoying. I.e: being literally defend by your gun because you didn't wear ear protection, or having a bullet deform in the barrel of your automatic because you've been firing it non-stop for the past hour, rendering it useless. Just not as fun.
---
I haven't heard anything either. I seen recently that someone said they got their email confirmation that theirs was shipped.
---
Add in starched genes at least, likely also class freak. I'd do martial artist if you are swinging sledges, couple of those and you'll surpass the weight gain of string back. 
---
If going bloodied (and if so get unyielding armor for more str and more damage) think also about serendipity.
---
clownshoes
---
I love this! If only I were playing on PC. Thanks for building something so fun!
---
I read that he was in a wheel chair behind you. I was like lol he was crippled and trying to use that as an excuse to get in front of you. Then i thought I would love wheel chair vehicles in fallout.
---
Ouch :(
---
Energy weapons don’t benefit from the Explosive perk, but the Beam Splitter on the Laser rifles are God-like - better than TSE before the nerf. 
---
While TSE now only add 25% and 20% damage bonuses (up to 32% for explosive damage bonus if using maxed explosive card) the Beam splitter adds 400% extra damage since it adds 4 more beams that do full damage, and they have very little spread, making it effective at range too! 
---
The Lasers can also be a pistol or rifle and can get down to like 7-8lbs without perks. 
---
It is almost required that you use Gunsmith (to prevent deterioration), repair it to 200% (Weapon Smith), and that you also put a bashing stock/grip on it to maximize durability and usage.
---
Do enclave events. They give out the recipe for it as rewards.
---
I saw new information about it not even a week ago.
---
I just had a lvl 400 something at my vendor..:O
---
I've rebuilt my camp a few times the last week trying to find a sweet spot and had this issue LOADS of times. It sure needs looking into.
---
PS - more camp budget please?
---
I was using a TSE Combat Shotgun until the TSE Nerf a while ago. I was pissed but the next day after the Nerf, I landed an Anti Armor Explosive Handmade and I am not disappointed at all. AAE is probably better it seems.
---
If no one has noticed I switched to rdr2 for awhile, but i plan on coming back :)
---
Man I really don't feel like playing a game, better write an college essay long post about it letting everyone know
---
It could also be like an event where survivors have to defend a building from the raiders (or vice versa) Could make for some good pvp fun.
---
just travel to a close by location and walk.
---
In my experience, I prefer the Tesla rifle to the laser rifle. I have a Charging Barrel QE Tesla rifle that I use more often then my BE or VE laser weapons. It’s a beast of a gun in PvE. I suppose the BE laser would excel in PvP but I haven’t tested this so I’m not sure.
---
Add the Project Paradise to this. Works the same there too with the water in the environment's even though its only ankle high lol
---
Its a pretty common item from the purveyor, I know of quite a few people who got them from her. Some got multiple.
---
Exact same thing happened to me, but it refused to let me set the camp down in the same place because it thought it was on water.  I ended up moving the camp a few feet to the left and rebuilding the entire thing because of a set of stairs that wouldn’t detach! Oh well, it looks great now and I made the camp super vendor/player friendly, so in the long run it might be worth the effort.
---
But the expanse is the best show ever made
---
Things of the translator and the hurry, I'm sorry.
---
Even so, for that I think they put the prestige system so maybe an increase in level is not the solution. Before, the balancing of weapons and resistance is urgent.
---
Maybe it will leave a map with prestige or enemies with it.
---
Of course, they have to find some way to make the current legendary team outdated ... but also to make current enemies a joke by increasing the level limit.
---
Maybe new legendaries with prestige requirements or who receive extra buffs from perks.
---
 No, we're the jaded veterans that have seen hate/ hype trains for every AAA game in the past 15 years. 
---
Some highlights: 
---
games as a service as a model. Got crucified during destinies inception, now considered viable market model. 
---
Online connection requirements for traditionally single player games: Diablo 3, one of the benchmarks to introduce drm into traditionally single player viable games. 
---
Microtrsactions: in 15 years we've watched an expansion being sold as almost a whole new game, to being dlc that adds content, to being 2.99 for a gun skin pack. Fortnite needs to be careful on its marketing to children as lawsuits against juggernauts like McDonalds set precedent for marketing to children. 
---
In 15 years unlockable skins went from achievement based to wallet based. You don't get cool fun new armor for completing some esoteric challenge, you just buy it. 
---
Games as an artists medium are harder and harder to utilize behind corporate interest. Portal was such an oddity for being fps-ish, puzzle and teamwork (in portal 2) oriented, and then community adopted and built into something beautiful, compared to EA and their handling of star wars battlefront. The "pride and accomplishment" meme still trends. 
---
Tldr; were just sick and tired of being sick and tired and we just wanna try to enjoy our games.
---
Nah criticism is one thing but those clickbait happy fucks went full on witch hunt. its like they were on a crusade. hardly any of them are that brutal on other games. I unsubscribed from quite a few you tubers because they just didn't even try to be objective or acknowledge just how different a set up this was than other MMO RPG. 
---
1. the server population maintainance and redistribution methodology hasn't been used like this that I know of. you're talking about a responsive dynamically changing server list of self maintaining self regulating servers. yeah it was buggy as HEEELLL at first but if they ever do get the bugs worked completely out its going to end up being a very solid stable system that can be repaired and grown on demand without interupting customer gametime hardly at all. 
---
sigh going into rant mode. I will just say. they weren't objective and pretty much lost all of my respect. I unsubbed many I had watched for quite awhile.
---
Tse does more damage for enemy's with under 50 damage resistance and aae does more damage for enemy's with over 50 damage resistance. Your average enemy has about 30-70 and your average player has about 150-400.
---
I can't figure it out.  Whenever I've built up a workshop and then left the game or got disconnected, my entire workshop build disappears on restart.  However, I've come across many workshops with the previous owner's build still intact and operating.  Fallout 76 is a fickle mistress . . .
---
AA doesn't work on energy weapons, so TS is still most viable unless your keen on Bloodied.
---
I haven’t tested, but I doubt it’s a functionally meaningful one.
---
A splendid strategy, indeed.
---
I'm not actually sure about that, sorry.
---
There are lots of good recommendations here.  Make sure you tag plastic.  There are lots of things that unexpectedly have plastic. 
---
I've found that in addition to the specific places mentioned, there are tons of places not worth the trip *just* for plastic, but if you are already nearby, is good for a quick loot and run.
---
Thunder Mountain workshop has a bunch of trays and coolant bottles, for example.  Not the 100+ run of Morgantown HD, but still worth a visit if you are nearby.  Explore and add a few places to your list.
---
I like to launch nukes and kill legendaries as much as possible, all the little secrets you can fight ingame are fun too, I originally started playing because my dad played a lot and he wanted me to join him
---
I've given up on mines after having several self-detonate when I tried to place them too close to my position.
---
great idea. Survival would become more like Rust.
---
Thx!!!! :)
---
TS is only good on energy weapons or if you already have enough armor penetration from mods and perks. For all other cases AA is better since damage is on the level of TS or better, but also no debuf like TS has with accuracy.
---
Trying to level up for it
---
I wish I could say this happened to me. But, no it hasn't. I've made objectively far worse blunders that I will take to the grave. Take solace in that fact.
---
I figured they would bring the parade back. I just hooe they bring different rewards. I dont want to grind that event again unless the super rare mask drop at a higher rate.
---
One of the best hidden psa! Thx
---
I prefer the second if im entirely honest.
---
I wish they included the Ultracite and Excavator PA paints with the rest of the paint packs.
---
Weird that Vanilla WoW servers are one of the most popular they have now, if that were the case you'd think the vanilla servers wouldn't be a thing.

---
The DLC events for Wild Appalachia kept me coming back. Disappointed that's over now with no release news on Nuclear Winter. Although if that ends up being a BR mode then that won't make me play more or at all.
---
Player Vending keeps me playing. Gatta get out there to try and land some legendaries to sell in my shop, the ones that are useless I just use as Scrip fodder for later store product.
---
Also to go to other players shops to see if I can finish my Vanguard/Mutants Marine Armor set and whatever I see that strikes my favor.
---
I'm always on the lookout for a new base location, until I am incredibly satisfied with a final destination.
---
And I also haven't ventured into a lot of the locations still. Like the Uncanny Caverns, Eastern Regional Penetentiary, and a bunch of other places I haven't been through.
---
And last but not least, I want to FINALLY see and violently murder the Flatwood Monster.
---
At least they often said they are open for suggestions...
---
To me, it's the best way to game. Keeps me from getting burned out on stuff.
---
They are the true fans. I put the game down for a bit after release because everything was low level, shoula stuck it out.
---
You okay bud?
---
If you unsubbed then how do you know they weren't that critical of other games? Have you even seen half the shit thrown at Anthem? or all the shit being talked about Elder scrolls blades?
---
Visited your base the other day, assuming you're in AU. Everybody looked like they were having so much fun i tried to drop a nuke on it :)
---
1k tops. No value.
---
Weapon weight reduction, its an effect you can get on 3* legendary armor. Reduces weapon weights by a percentage.
---
Another benefit to healing salves is they don't have an animation like stimpaks so they're quicker and easier to spam when you're in trouble.
---
The only negative for melons is their crazy high weight.
---
Yep, here. Hundreds of plastic, tasty xp and about every other kind of scrap.
---
There are still dupes alive and well, invincibility glitch in pvp, speed hacks, etc. Where do you get this idea that this game is the most "non exploitable" beth game?
---
They shouldn't come back those that got them supported the game early and should have something unique
---
About a month ago I had an ass-hat tossing grenades at me and my team.. Same as you.. it was not hurting me but it was really annoying..
---
After about 10 mins of this.. I tossed one at him and his house. 
---
There are a few things you need to know about the situation, I'm level 200, and I keep Demolition Expert Level 5 equipped,. this boosts both explosions AND grenade damage quite a bit. I wanted to send an extra bit of love, so I also equipped Wrecking Ball which I leveled up the card to it's max just for ...said ass-hat. You know how you get that pak of cards at every 5 levels that gives you extra cards you didn't ask for? This card also gave an extra 80% damage to CAMP items. I thought this is going to be interesting... I switched off Pacifist mode, and tossed JUST one grenade back at him. Well he tossed about 30 at me and my crew.. Except mine was an Orbital Strike Beacon. After I tossed it.. I waited safely behind the another building until I heard my buddies tell me about how I took out much of the roof and a ton of walls.. It was at that time I received the notification that I was wanted to the tune of 980 Caps!!! Holy crap I must have did some serious damage to his house!!!!! It was then our exit plan was put into place. I left world with my buddies in tow when got to a new world jumped out of PA, took off all my armor and waited the very longggggg 10 seconds before my buddy killed me to wash the Wanted status off me and transferred 7xx caps to him.. Yup you loose a portion of the caps when your wanted to the system. He gave me back the 7xx caps and they as they were laughing so hard... explained in detail to me the massive damage I had dealt to our ass-hat. Of course I blocked the ass-hat so I don't have to worry about him any more.
---
Getting pelted by an ass-hat
---
Annoying...
---
Getting revenge on said ass-hat
---
!!Extremely!! !!!Awesome!!!....
---
Paying about only 200 caps, loosing wanted status, and knowing that you brought grief to a grieffer..
---
PRICELESS!
---
I have only gotten the explosives or two shots but never both :(
---
You get to the point in the game where the only creatures, legendary or not, that are a pain in the ass in the slightest are sheepsquatches and scorchbeasts. Well, until the scorchbeast lands. Then they turn into a marshmallow for some reason. Been on and off a new play through the past few days to put some challenge back into the game while I still do legendary damring on my high level.
---
Pretty much the same for me. Picking off enemies with sniper rifle while listening to when i get low i get high
---
Nah, I don’t think I can do that. Just doesn’t feel like something I’d do. Definitely not something I would have done a couple posts up, no way.
---
So does mutfruit and blackberries. Once you get to the savage divide, if you walk everywhere, you'll easily max out  your daily caps on blackberries alone.
---
Ill bee honest its the people ive met that keeps me busy.
---
400-500 tops
---
I jumped for suicide to get it.
---
I'm not sure.  The text on the screen just seems to make a big deal about using it to protect the animals.
---
I don't know about the friendly robot the other poster mentions.  The quest does such a poor job of explaining itself, I wasn't even aware that there was such a thing.
---
what perk gives you the % above the name?
---
&gt;i really want this game to get better, but you should never keep your faith in an AAA company. they are not your friend. this applies to all developers, not just bethesda.
---
CD Projeckt red would like a word with you.
---
20x makes sense, actually. And yeah, same for the rest- as a bloodied build, my instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun is an amazing “sniper” rifle that will oneshot super mutants once I’ve got adrenaline stacked past ~40%. Most other things I don’t even need Adrenaline stacks.
---
This is awesome. Adds new gameplay and nice little fun break.  Keep up the good work
---
How certain are you of this.. I'm still hearing from buddies that are getting killed in other than workshop locations.
---
If it's not 2 shot explosive it's generally not gonna sell for much in my experience. ;)
---
Rifleman and or commando, tank killer, bloody mess in luck, if you use vats better criticals ( which may be bugged), gunfu is nice, adrenaline. If you need more damage try to get rid of as many weight reduction perks as possible ( with the exception of maybe bandolier).
---
Because the Dothraki kept getting high on Marsupial and would have made her dragons obsolete.
---
This would be more appropriate in the actual trade subreddit , don’t you think ?
---
That's what I was figuring. I read that junkie builds were taking off though.
---
I honestly forgot it was a thing.
---
I only found out scrounger was this way after I was lvl 50 and stopped running around with the perk equipped...
---
Given four numbers bigger than 0: X, Y, Z, J
---
X=Number of cards which max level is 1 
---
Y=Number of cards which max level is 2
---
Z=Number of cards which max level is 3
---
J=Level we need to have to get every possible combination
---
X+2Y+Y+3Z+2Z+Z= J
---
People would just get their alt accounts to 5* their vendors. And when I say people I mean me.
---
One of my favorite perks, I get so much extra meds with it.
---
How far should I go into rifle man or commando? I know to get the three individuals for the +30% but should I max star them, or are my points better used elsewhere?
---
Indeed, a fantastic summary, thank you much. Seems like it's well worth coming back to if I enjoyed the vanilla.
---
Your camp is gorgeous anyway
---
If it happens, it happens.  If I miss out, I miss out.  It's the difference between a want and a need.  I don't *need* any significant improvements to what I already have.
---
why do that? It pays off MASSIVELY. You just have to search again after you look in a container.
---
ShowHealth Redux mod.
---
No, its the spacebar, silly.
---
thanks. I assume i can find it on Nexus?
---
Just got an email from them on Friday, stating they are still WIP etc etc, so they are still working on it
---
Hahaha that's so awesome! You all are my heroes 😂.
---
It's hard to find a rude person when there's only one hundred people still playing this game.
---
Maybe it references future DLC’s
---
You want Bethesda fucking nerf it?! Next update will make it "A chance to get twice the results when picking flora"
---
They really do two different things.  A Laser Rifle is like a traditional gun.  The Tesla Rifle is for when you really don't want to bother aiming, because it rebounds off surfaces.
---
Personally, I'd *never* trade a Bloodied Power Fist with Swing Speed, least of all for a Laser anything.
---
As long as basically everyone runs around in PA, i dont see them making any buffs to it. Heck they need to make normal armor more viable before changing anything towards PA.
---
A level 200?! Shooting you in the back?! What a dog.. When will these people ever learn some manners...
---
Omg thats the best thing ever, i have to try this some day. You sir... are awesome!
---
I know, the fall has to be high enough to trigger the "superhero landing" slam effect. It still does nothing.
---
this perk, like scrounger, can-do, and butcher's bounty, have to be both equipped, and activated on search. You look in a first aid kit and loot what you find. Then if this is equipped there is an option to "Search". Do that (spacebar on PC) and new stuff appears in the container for you if you win the percentage roll.
---
Yepper
---
The FO4 engine didn't support the mechanic and '76 is based on that version of the engine.   
---
It's one of the many things we've been trying to get fixed since the B.E.T.A. And why energy weapons are still so under powered (non-legacy explosive ones)
---
I got 2 x01 mods the other day for 1000 caps in total. You cant belive how happy i was.
---
Tato. Corn. Mutfruit.
---
There's no reason for separate storage for the shop. It's way better that it's combined, as *you* control the weight allotment. Don't care to sell much stuff, but love to hoard? This system works best for you. Don't need a lot of space for yourself, but have tons of great items to sell? This system works best for you. No one is hampered by the combined system.
---
If something is holding you back, it's the overall weight. Increasing this is worth discussing IMO. It would objectively make the game easier; having more resources makes it easier, full stop. It would also let people sell more items, which would be a nice improvement to the vendor content.
---
Plant tatos mutfruit and corn to make vegetable starch. Scrap that for adhesive.
---
&gt;Online connection requirements for traditionally single player games: Diablo 3, one of the benchmarks to introduce drm into traditionally single player viable game
---
Diablo 3 did horribly compared to its previous titles in the franchise exactly due to the always online DRM and real money auction house.
---
&gt;Microtrsactions: in 15 years we've watched an expansion being sold as almost a whole new game, to being dlc that adds content, to being 2.99 for a gun skin pack. Fortnite needs to be careful on its marketing to children as lawsuits against juggernauts like McDonalds set precedent for marketing to children. 
---
Yeah, and bethesda was one of the very first companies to start with microtransactions. Anyone remember horse armor? LOL
---
&gt;games as a service as a model. Got crucified during destinies inception, now considered viable market model. 
---
I'd say it isn't a very viable market model if Anthem, fo76, and even Apex Legends are all failing pretty badly. Have you been following the amount of layoffs Activision has been doing over the money they are losing over anthem and and the layoffs at EA over Apex legends?
---
But yeah, totally agree with you that the way modern gaming is going isn't a good place. I don't think people in this sub will care though, they are either too young to remember back before game companies felt the need to make everything a "live service". 
---
I'll bet Starfield will have a "live service" model as well. You can tell zenimax is just out to try to get as much money as they can from consumers regardless of the morality of it, just look at the elder scroll blades "game", it is literally just a program to push microtransactions as hard as possible, with almost zero actual game aside from "insert CC# here".
---
I'm still looking for my T51b mods lol but I can imagine how happy you'd be. As happy as I will be when I finally get mine
---
Eyyyy I logged in this morning and somebody bought it, so maybe there's hope for the economy after all
---
Exactly. Travelling to a vendor only to find 17 ivory grips plans is annoying.
---
I imagine the engine can't do it, but it would be nice to be able to tag search terms or items like "flux" or "Bloodied" and any vendor that has that shows a different color on the map.
---
cool if we add you? I am intrigued.
---
you can reroll technically: sell back what you got for scrips, then take your chance again...
---
The dramatic exiter looks like Doug Walker, which is apropos because one of Doug's first videos was of him walking out of work *dramatically.*
---
Or, you know, skins that cover all weapons or all armors so that it’s actually worth the price?
---
The Gutter is garbage, I don't know why I keep it in my stash. My All Rise only has the 90% weight reduction on it and something else weak, it's been in my vending machine for a while and nobody wants it for the 1000 price. It's not _that_ bad and I've seen them on sale for much more.
---
Bloodied melee is the way to go, once you try that it's so hard to go back, it's like losing your marsupial mutation.
---
There's also the whole thing where, as a prefix, it's more likely to drop at night.  I'm not sure anyone has put that to the test, but it definitely turns me away from running my Legnedary route at night.
---
**YEEEEEEEEEEEHHAAAAAWWWWWWW** -Slim Pickens
---
#*M E L O N S A R E T H E S U P E R I O R F R U I T*
---
Stick with it, the purveyor has a surprisingly high chance of giving them out, much more so than finding them off a mob from what I've seen.
---
Also, does your character name have a space in it? Because drop chances are "salted" with your character name. So some character names are more "lucky" than others just due to their name working well with the algorithm used for drops. Like names with spaces have very bad luck.
---
Very swank.
---
Yep, what they said!
---
Wade Airport has a bunch in the hangers  if you’re not into farming.
---
I'd like a heavy beam weapon that doesn't need to spin up.
---
Raiding is such a weird option to me.  Why is it more fun for you to take from someone else?  Find your own damn shit lol.
---
Yeah, frankly, I don't understand why it has to have a negative effect.  A negative effect that isn't even in the description of the item.  I think most players would assume it gets modestly better at night, and is simply "normal" during the day.
---
Because you can't control day and night by going to bed in this game, it's a rather screwed up Legendary effect.
---
&gt; and get your ass completely cooked
---
I think we all go try that at least once.
---
Gatling plasmas are solid but niche. Junkies builds are better, but still rare. Finding the intersection between the two is unlikely, but an additional problem is that the second affix is weak. The +50% VATS crit affix is usually great, but less so on heavy weapons which use so much AP. The third affix, +250 DR reloading, is solid.
---
Yeah, I always load in then run to the other side of the bridge, and come back. I wonder if I should have waited a bit longer in some cases. I thought the one random animal (firefly, rabbit, beaver, radstag) was one of the spawns.  But once I got one of them, then a few seconds later a horde of mole rats?
---
Thx.... I was tempted to trade  but then I realized I love that PF to much
---
is this true?
---
joke post?
---
where are you on the map that it is actually dark outside at night? i can build just fine anytime as i can hardly see any difference between the two, nighttime is as bright as daytime usually
---
only place that is actually dark is the Mire swamp
---
I dont mind buying atoms if i want something ( could be a little cheaper though ) 
---
But i wont be buying any limited time items anymore if they come back anyway
---
I was definitely guilty of this. Made a whole post about it. Now I'm just waiting for my Fallout battery to recharge so I can hop back in.
---
Idk, it was pretty obvious to me that this wasn't going to be F5 when watching the announcement on E3. It boggles me how/why so many people thought it would be.
---
What is that numbers above the name of the mutant?
---
Pulse rifle from FO2. Although I guess that's the Tesla in this game.
---
Luckily for me, it didn't take me THAT long to figure out ;)
---
The .45 pistol from New Vegas would be nice.
---
If you're strong enough to one shot ghouls and glowing ones and have level 3 Blocker equipped, just go in with Hazmat suit.  With Blocker and without the additional radiation damage, they don't hit that hard.
---
Hey thanks for the mention! I'm not the first person to do Berserker but I'm glad you are still using it.  I just started playing again last night and can say with absolute certainty that Berserker builds are still very viable!  Actually it felt a little stronger than I remembered. :)  
---
Friend me in game and let's chat.  IGN is RealityAskew.
---
Morgantown.  Hit the high school first;  you can get a ton of plastic from the gymnasium alone.  A lot of people seem to forget that golf balls and bowling pins also contain plastic so make sure to grab those as well.  Then I hit the frat house right across the street, mainly for the pool balls in the basement, before traveling to the bar across from Biv's place to collect more pool balls from their table.  Hit the cat house while you're in Morgantown as well. 
---
Plastic is also on my high priority scavenge list.  For the most part, I won't pick up items that only give you 1 resource when scrapped.  For example, why pick up a scalpel which only gives 1 steel when I can pick up an adjustable wrench and get steel and a gear? 
---
 However, I will snag that plastic spoon every time.
---
A heavy 5.56 weapon, perhaps another LMG based on the Stoner 63 or similar. I have way too much 5.56 ammo lying around on my heavy weapon build so it'd be nice to expend it in a new heavy gun of some sort.
---
Except any time I’ve been playing this event never shows up and the one time I started it nobody came to join. 
---
I later spent 2 hours following some low level guy around pretending to help him but hoping he would get downed along the way, he did once and when I ran up to revive just regular style there was no button or option to do so.
---
Come to realize I will never get that dumb kindness revive a player thing and haven’t played since. So frustrating.
---
Yeah, get two levels of this perk (60% chance) and you'll very likely never need to buy chems again. In fact, you should have enough to sell a bunch, once in a while.
---
If you want to do auto and semi, then take bloody mess, tank killer, adrenalin, some Charisma perk should work similar to adrenalin( i think there is a hammer on the card). And from there go with the rifle man/ commando and stick to what you prefere.
---
I run a similar build and I have few problems staying hidden and also participating in the events. You do have to be really mindful of your health and keep good armor or else you’re going to die a lot.
---
For something like campfire tales, you gather stuff as needed, then move off to the side. Escape artist helps but I find it doesn’t really work a lot of the time.
---
lol. A perk I cannot live without. Great source of not only meds but your excess can be sold off, and so also a great source of income.
---
No comment on the former, but switch out damage for damage in the latter? Keep both? Are you thinking too hard? (Meaning relax and have fun instead of stressing out over perks :)  If you have Marsupial, pull cover support and tag/soften thing up from the rooftops.
---
Way overpowered and very annoying.
---
That’s the responder recruiter bot. Not sure what the morse code translates to. If you server hop in that area, you’ll get different spawns. Sometimes the traveling vendor bot will appear.
---
Doesn't matter if you search the container before or after you loot it. Save yourself a click. They all add up and you'll live longer.
---
Got trapper dense yesterday so it is possible. I just need marine and raider.
---
They will also spawn facing the same direction you were facing when you originally placed it. This is really helpful for locating vending machines.
---
Nope. A nearby player camp will block any random events from spawning.
---
Yeah, that doesn’t work in this case.
---
There are people that go around and challenge workshops just to kill players for easy caps. Several times I've been kill in one shot while not saying attention, and then the guy just goes somewhere else instead if taking the workshop.
---
I started playing again last night and noticed my Berserker build was doing insane damage.  Maybe this is why.
---
Looks like PC if thats a monitor. Can try running the option in launcher to scan/repair files and if running mods disable them.
---
&gt; one that isn't even in the description of the item
---
It is in the description, that's my problem.  The description just says "less" but not how much less.
---
I also picked up a shotgun mod for the Tesla. Is this  any good or will this spread the beam to much ?
---
You’re too late I’ve already seen two large channels blasting him lol. Trash content though and not just these videos in particular
---
Vanilla, once fixed, was good. It was challenging, and required a lot of skill to do well and really got the blood flowing. People miss that.
---
Example: I logged off my lvl 50(max level at the time) Hunter in a dangerous area. I had been in a full group and we were surviving but taking a huge beating. I never logged back on, that was the last day I played that character. I quit the game a short while later.
---
After one of the more recent expansions, I downloaded the game, activated the account, and logged in to see how things had changed. I spawned in to the middle of a swarm of same-level mobs. When I logged out, 1 same level mob is very difficult. 2 is death. There were 8. All of my skills had been reset, and none of my weapons were equipped except a dagger, as they had apparently changed the weapon slots. My pet was gone, and I could not call any of them(I found later they were all unique and you have to have a special skill to have them now).
---
I lived. I killed them all. **THAT** is how much the game has changed. No challenge anymore.
---
Hahahahaha rip
---
A lot of people do to get quick scrip. I sell them for 50/30 weapons/armor. Sells super fast. I often also drop them at train stations if I have too many though.
---
Yes please, just a final, last increase! and the shared stash even if its capacity is 100 or 50, better than none!
---
I recently farmed it. Took me 2 days of about 6 hours total and ~ 14 spawns until i got it... 
---
I know the pain.
---
But that plague walker thing just sucks...
---
If you solo/duo the event, it's better to stick to the toxic goo room. Not too hard to get the trough to 60/60. Deer spawns are ridicously low 9/10 times :\
---
Or they setting people up with a team.
---
Im a stealth combat knife build. I actually rock lil to no perks that deal damage to maximize speed and carry weight. Close to full unyielding luck (42) with an instigating combat dagger that shows up around 200 damage,  I still 1 shot super mutants. 1 or 2 pieces of harder to detect while sneaking pieces help, or enchant like shadowed. I rock 1 harder to detect, 3 cav, and 1 fall damage.
---
You can always restealth after the first hit to get a second sneak attack. I stay in sneak form even against the lv 100 alpha most of the time. All about that 350% multiplier.
---
My guess would be their "announcement" that will change the wasteland forever or however they are hyping it will be the addition of human npcs in the Wastelanders expansion and whatever pvp they are going to try to cram down our throats in Nuclear Winter.
---
Thank you. I’ll try that out next time.
---
It was datamined after one of the patches. I looked for a while and I can’t find the source.
---
Are you running Windows 10 on a machine that has integrated and discrete card? For some reason since Patch 6 or so, you have to go into Screen Settings &gt; Graphics Settings, browse for Fallout 76 and set it to the high performance card. You may have to repeat this with the NVidia/Radeon card's own setup program.
---
&gt;Enjoy the game as much as you want, but do not defend their bad practices
---
this. They really don't give a fuck about the art of computer games, it's all about marketing and getting all your lovely money. Sad, very sad. Remember the Fallout franchise was not their original creative work, they salvaged it off a ship going down. It's all cost vs. income to them, they might as well be making washing machines.
---
Just my two cents, but I’m fine with an increase in level cap on weapons/armor IF, and only if, there is a system that exists to upgrade your current gear. 
---
With the purveyor gracing us in the wasteland, I can’t imagine that creating this system would be too hard. Using scrip as a currency, for example, one could use 100 scrip per level to power up your gear. If they increased the new level cap to say 75, then with the already existing scrip cap of 1000 per week, you couldn’t just get a weapon from 50 to 75 in a day (much less with the 150 scrip a day limit). I believe it would be win-win, no one gets to level 75 weapons (in my example) in a day AND it gives those looking to improve something to work towards.
---
Again, quick brainstorm - but I do agree with others, if our guns that we’ve achieved over the hundreds of hours of playtime are simply obsolete with no method of upgrading, then yeah count me out.
---
But is there any proof of this?  Like I said for weapons you can look at the DAM, but for armor, as far as I can tell the DR/ER/RR don't change.
---
You're remembering 50/50 for armor, u/Mo0kish says that for weapons its 50/35, u/MrFuddyDuddy says some legendary weapons gave 100% more at night.
---
It's so frustrating trying to get information about legendary and modifier effects in FO76, everything is hearsay.
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool
---
An advantage of all the pile-on press, it weeds out a lot of the trolls.  Still get some, but most of them take a pass.  Better for the rest of us!
---
Yes, I’d say you’re doing several things wrong. The first one is trying to shop on Survival servers. I’d advise keeping that activity confined to Adventure mode.
---
Better to sell them in vendor. They will hang around longer. Even if you put them for 0 caps, they will persist. And any vendor with lots of ammo/armor gets a visit. Sadly the scumbags have figured that out and you sometimes find a vendor with a dozen throwing knives or some such bullshit. I always take all their crops and water to pay for the travel caps I wasted getting there. Bastards. I might stop killing the spawn mobs too.
---
Oh yeah, Juice head's drooling over all the clicks. Can't publish that trash fast enough.
---
Lol, ya, been awhile but I remember that discovery.
---
Its just what i read, nothing i confirmed though
---
I hear ya. Scripped some stuff yesterday and picked out three 2* ranged from the vendor. Two were compete dogshit fatmen and the other a light boxing glove I stored to scrip later. Just dropped the heavies so the other guys that were there can take them if they want them. That would have been like 40lbs taken up if I tried holding onto them.
---
diluted rad x doesn't supress mutations
---
I'm just tired of seeing the same suggestions over and over again.
---
That's how I do all online games. I play wow, ffxiv, eso, swtor, and fo76 with all the single player games inbetween. When new content comes out I go play it for a while then bounce to the next one. Never get bored always stuff to do.  I respect people who hunker down in one game and that's their jam but I don't know how they do it.
---
Seconded, damn sure i saw this post too, and if i'm correct, most of the conversation was towards the idea that it does in fact carry the effect when Re-Chambering.
---
I find it doesn't work that great.  I just switch to power armor and melee at whitesprings and prime fissure.  I maxed out glow sight and use that with my melee and my explosive black powder.  Glow sight is in perception so I can just switch back to rifleman after I'm done running the nuke zone.
---
The cost of transparency is hate
---
When my scrip is full, I put the crap in my vendor for 1 cap. they go fast, so no worries there. Someone will buy them all in one visit, then go happily to the legendary scrapper.
---
It helps that my camp is right across from the Whitesprings station so I get tons of visits, and they have a scrapper right there  to use if they are heavy.
---
That's returned to the game? Seriously, that was supposedly patched before the new year IIRC.
---
Btw, the bot will have a different inventory for every player that accesses it... if your on pc i'd be down to help you.
---
Well, there are certainly still bugs, don't get me wrong! When you look at how quickly the issues are being patched compared to older single player titles, for example there are still quests I can't complete in Skyrim even after a total re release. 
---
Understandably it's online so it's far more urgent to get said patches in place. I've been playing since launch, and the only thing that's directly effected me is the consistent crashing up until about a month after release, since then I've had far less general bugs than any Bethesda game I've played previously. 
---
I just think it's a shame that a lot of people's first impression of the game (before even playing it) is that it's unplayable due to bugs and exploits. This is far from the case for a general player. I guess I haven't read up much on duping, honestly I thought they've patched out anything regarding this so I'll hold my hands up if it really is still that much of a problem.
---
good to know. I got in the habit of loot/space/loot so it is reflex anymore.
---
And it does add up. 100 stimpacks, 120 radaway, 60 superstims on my vendor initially. They sell constantly and are a great steady income source.
---
It was the plan you got yeah? And from vender bot phoenix?
---
Middle Mountain Cabins and The Freak Show consistently spawn honeybeasts, which drop 1-5 adhesive each. Cabins also spawns Yao Guai for some good screw and acid farming
---
Yes. When vending started I put over 100 of stimpacks and radaway up. They sell well, and are easy to keep in stock.
---
I think a nice thing would be no limit on scrapping but the vendor is whats limited to how many things you can buy. Basically the backwards of what we have now. You are still being limited on the amount of legendaries you can buy per day, just arent stuck hording the crappies until the machine resets and you can scrap some more.
---
&gt;  I've put a ton of hours into this game and there's no way I would ever consider it to be that good.
---
Why would you play a game that isn't "good".  I assume you have fun playing it or you wouldn't.  What does "good" mean for a game other than "it's fun"?
---
&gt; The facts just don't support it,
---
Facts? What do you mean by "facts"?  Is there some objective way of measuring "goodness"?  What are the units?  How do you translate them into length/mass/time?
---
Don't swap Rifleman Perks for Glowsight - use them all together. 
---
I'm a shiper and most of the time I don't have a problem staying hidden, then again I don't run a Vats/Crit Build. I'm all into stealth and aiming for sneak attacks, and I'm wearing Chameleon gear also.
---
I can kill a squad of 3 lvl 80 scorchbeasts and use maybe 2 or 3 stimpacks. The only thing it takes from me is ammo. Sheepsquatch is easy peasy once you cripple a leg. He's a bullet sponge but if fhe can't get in on you, it's cake. 
---
1 level 50 assaultron that gets the jump on me, however...
---
Well... It did'nt work the first time, when the brotherhood nuked the glassed caverns. 
---
They discovered fissures are in fact a huge network of caves. Crumbling one does nothing. Even then, eventually SBs will climb their way up to the surface again, as the Brotherhood witnessed later.
---
TBH I don't understand why she wanted us to activate the silos. From a peaceful point of view, they are just weapons of mass destruction that we can launch at each other. Wasteland creatures are so irradiated that nukes won't harm them, radiation-wise at least. Hell, we are even nuking one of the only area that was NOT nuked during the war.
---
Ironic.
---
I sell them to vendors to make room in my stash. Un-diluted chems take up a lot of space :p
---
Yes. All of mine have been from other vendors.
---
I think it's about us repeating the mistakes of those 25 years before us using nukes to take care of our problems (even tho this one is very justifiable). Also I love that it hints at her still being alive since she obviously saw our nukes
---
Oh, im not stressing. Just trying to max out my damage since I usually run solo. Maxed rifleman gives +20% while maxed glow sights does +60% to glowing enemies and wondering how they relate to the other perks
---
Aside from the OS (I’m on Win 8.1), you pretty much hit the nail. 
---
I’ve a card that comes with pretty much most laptops (the Intel HD graphics one, which I assume is the default one) and a GTX 960M.
---
I’ll give it a shot and see how it goes, thanks!
---
It has reputable sellers and trade.
---
I think it's not trying to be "dramatic", it's mostly voicing your anger because it's nowhere else to be heard. That's the same reason why stuff like "review bombing" exists. How else are you going to tell a developer that the game, in it's current state, is shit? Write them an email? A support ticket? I mean, come on. Most people who make an "dramatic exit" want the game to be better and by making a big fuzz about it, they can make sure that the dev will hear about it, if enough people do it.
---
We need the Glowing Sea to be back.
---
If he killed you, how do you know you didn't drop the bacon?
---
Feel free to add me. Handle is ThriceDamned ✌
---
dude they don't even have a good drop like most other big bad fuana
---
Yes its back in the game since patch 9.  Still around AFAIK though I've gotten better at avoiding it.  Auto Tesla/Handmade I just burst fire.  Explosive heavy weapons seem more susceptible to bugging out.
---
Nope, you gotta pick the card over again, and if you want it 2 star you have to pick it twice and combine them so you have a card with a 3 star and a card with a 2 star of the same card type. Does that make sense
---
 Go to a higher place and keep cleaning the mobs to help, if is SBQ or other Boss keep helping the melee builds that kill her when she lands by killing the mobs that attack them, Team play even if they are not you team, is that the Sniper job.
---
Cost of transparency is hate
---
Running around in your underwear with a sledgehammer is viable so I imagine firing a big fucking gun is.
---
I've got one you can have. I'll never use it.
---
You're just upset you can't destroy people's homes aren't you? This puts aside the fact that almost everyone I've seen has stashes outside their homes to help people wandering and scavenging
---
I don't understand how I did this exact type of post, and the stupid auto mod deleted it on me, saying not enough info and click bait.
---
I was under the impression that the SBQ was special in some way, with the whole "reign of terror" message we get. Like that after you kill her that no more scorchbeasts will be born, and they can eventually be hunted to extinction.
---
I hit Level 200 yesterday.  Here's what is keeping me playing right now:
---
A heavy bias toward the world of Fallout.  A heavy bias toward WV (where I live).  Force of habit, the comfort of an evening routine.
---
Seeing other people's camps.  The slight chance that I'll run into someone amusing, or get some amazing item from The Purveyor.
---
Looking at the library of yet-unplayed games on my XBox and PC and thinking, *"I don't feel like starting anything new."* 
---
I feel like I'm stuck in a rut but it's a comfortable rut, if that makes sense.  There's so much new content with the Pioneer Scouts, yet I kinda don't want to do it.  I did enough to get my backpack.  I don't feel compelled to earn every badge possible.  I'm powerful enough with good enough gear that I can just kinda roam and kill things and wind down at the end of the day.
---
This is a glitch on all platforms. Idk if Bethesda plans to fix. It would be nice to get some clarification on this from one of the community managers.
---
What is that perk?
---
A lot of youtubers got to about the airport and said fuck it, this is enough for my video essay.
---
its cause the people who are angry don't play and thank the lord they don't
---
Are you stupid or is this a troll post?
---
eyyy I got this paperbag!
---
Morgantown Highschool and AVR Medical center Cafeteria are my usual go to places. If you're travelling through Flatwoods as I do when I stock up on food, look for the plastic plastic cutlery/plates and trays around the cooking station area and on the tables inside the restaurant/bar there, and the swimming pool area just outside Flatwoods towards Overseer's camp. Life Preservers are plastic too.
---
You'd just pick a new bobblehead when you changed builds. This way, too, you'd just keep a stock of fthe two or three heads you needed, and when you switch builds you'd consume whichever one fifts your new build, and the buff would last until you used a new bobblehead.
---
Like a mutation with no negative effects, with the caveat that you can only have one at a time.
---
Sorry he didn’t get on his hands and needs naked and pray for your forgiveness Seriously get over it or just don’t play the game or any other Bethesda game
---
I liked how it left her story open since I was worried after the mountain tape! 
---
That makes sense too. I'm sure the first one to fire the nukes during the Great War thought they were justified too.
---
Yes..
---
*Bug fixes may or may not come with more bugs
---
Sweet. I feel like when I’m using it the effect is active while chambering but was just looking for confirmation. Cheers for the replies.
---
If that was true, they should not have sold this for 60 euro's to the fanbase that pre ordered and then cut the sale price by more than 75% only 2 weeks after launch.
---
And now these comforting words with the soothing voice about its not about the launch..
---
Sorry man... too little, too late...
---
This is a typical kind of statement Trump would make.
---
Bethesda decided to screw a big part of their fanbase and now they are talking sweet to salvage whats left of it. 
---
If this was true he would refund the price difference to all the loyal fans that paid the full price (for what even todd herself now claims to be unfair?)
---
See, Ive read that you aim for the legs but it doesnt work for me. Do you need concentrated fire perk or a limb damage legendary? I shoot them with my explosve handmade to the point he should be running on beef jerky but doesnt do anything.
---
Then don’t buy it but I’m sure you will and then continue to bitch about it
---
The other day in adventure some guy lured me in then flames shot out the walls till I died a horrible firery death. 10/10 would do again.
---
Part of my favorite gameplay loop is hunting for legendaries and using those for trade or vending.  The purveyor allowed me to scrap lousy ones for a chance at better ones.  Right now my gameplay loop gets stuck because I can't get rid of more than a few each day. It definetely needs to be upped to 500 scrip per day or more.
---
Even if I dont use it, I love the look and style of the Single Action
---
ShowHealth Redux mod
---
Same thing happened to me with the responder helmet. Very frustrating.
---
What does?
---
The numbers I reference are from people looking through the ESM data. You can browse the last reddit post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhvz9d/guide_indepth_weapon_legendary_effect_mechanics/). I've seen this in the past as well, so I believe it's accurate, but this is unfortunately the only posting I had bookmarkedto reference.
---
Specifically from the post: 
---
"Some notes from ESM browsing:
---
Bloodied is explicitly defined in 5% hp bands. Results are as you list.
---
Furious is capped at 9 hits in the data, but I could only get a 6-hit bonus last time I tested. Maybe a time-limit issue.
---
Berserker is +50% max at 0hp. I'd give the rest of the data but it's obviously terrible and not worth bothering with.
---
**The numbers on Nocturnal are +50% (0000 to 0600) to -35% (0600 to 2100). I've heard larger numbers in practical tests. Not sure why.**
---
Junkie's should be +10% per addiction, capped at +50%.
---
The "while aiming" legendary effects do check GetInIronSights, but it might be bugged."
---
I suddenly picture John Leguizamo's character in "Gamer".
---
I though the glass caverns we're nuked before the brotherhood. I though it was prewar to make ultracite, that's why the queen and beasts are based off cave bats.
---
Personally I’m not interested in raiding either. But you have to admit that defending your camp against mole rats only gets boring after a while. Plus you can create traps, turrets, hidden rooms and other trickeries to keep your stash safe from others.
---
I miss the Pip-Boy map.
---
That’s what I tend to do now but if got me thinking if I should swap out my covert op for, say, evasive where I would get +45 damage and energy resistance
---
the came out with the prototype paintjob for ultracite and i love it so much
---
Where on the map actually is the launch silo for Alpha?
---
Add green thumb and super duper with the plants
---
I have fast travelled to a couple of these CAMPS.
---
I have figured out that if the CAMP is on the map but has no player ID associated with it (ie. the player name is blank/empty), the CAMP is not there.
---
Frustrating to waste the caps to travel to something that isn't.
---
That'd be a good reason to take that card. 
---
Right now a lot of bobbleheads are just so situational, it's more of a hassle to keep them and use them than anything else. Some are obvious when you'd use them - strength for melee builds, small/big/energy weapons for when going in to the SBQ fight, etc. But some of them like hacking, lockpicking, luck... IDK. I'd never think to use them in the moment that I need it, as I'm probably not planning to encounter that content. Being able to turn on those QoL bobbleheads for long term bonus would be great.
---
I've seen both traders trying to overcharge for their goods and buyers who are clueless and have no idea what market value is for an item.  Both are just wasting everyone's time because no trade will get done 90% of the time if the price isn't right.  It takes time to learn the market but if you want to be successful selling/buying then spend some time learning what prices items are trading for.
---
Say hello over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals they're a friendly bunch :)
---
No perk card is passive, or was you need to have them equipped for them to work.
---
which tread? and who got the confirm?
---
Some of these "lags" last upwards of an hour ......... and it is still possible to fast travel to them.
---
Seconded.
---
I know this, but this one also needs you to press an additional button when looting, makes no sense.
---
Get more stimpacks when you search.
---
To all the people and bot of Bethesda downvoting me. Have a good day.
---
It's a reddit group. For trade selling and services.
---
I’m jealous!
---
All platforms
---
its crazy how the definition of "homely" differs between us and britian:
---
1.
---
NORTH AMERICAN
---
(of a person) unattractive in appearance.
---
synonyms:	unattractive, plain, plain-featured, plain-looking, plain as a pikestaff, ordinary-looking, unprepossessing, unlovely, ill-favored, ugly;
---
2.
---
BRITISH
---
(of a place or surroundings) simple but cozy and comfortable, as in one's own home.
---
"a modern hotel with a homely atmosphere"
---
synonyms:	cozy, home-like, homey, comfortable, snug, welcoming, friendly, congenial, hospitable, informal, relaxed, intimate, warm, pleasant, cheerful;
---
Shoot me an add: yawnbringer 
---
Got a few low level players in our group just getting started out.
---
In short, you can’t unrank the cards, but you can have cards ranked at various levels for swapping out for differing situations.
---
Since I’m at a high enough level to so, I have done this with many cards to make differing loadouts for different situations.  
---
For example, I like to have the perk cards involving weight reduction of weapons, chems, food at differing levels in case i go overweight on a faraway event run i can use the full 3* version of the card to handle the weight instead of the usual 1* for just a little weight reduction, so that way i am able to fast travel. Once i fast travel back to a stash, I take off the full effect and revert to the 1* version.
---
Oh yeah
---
I haven’t played in a while but I remember
---
It also gives radaway and rad x sometimes
---
And here I was..... thinking I was getting extra meds too.....
---
I run those same perks in my bloodied rifleman/commando build and I have no problem staying hidden for 90% of the queen fight, and that typically has an unlimited stream of mobs. The trick for me is to obviously stay crouched, and hit and move a bit between shots. So I am basically dancing between VATs strikes. When I lose stealth, I uncrouch and crouch to try and engage Escape Artist. I am able to do all this without the Sneak cards due to my AGI level in unyielding, but you could probably sub that for sneak if you were doing another armor load out.
---
Improving my character. I went into this game as a roleplayer in the apocalypse so whatever adds to my characters journey is what will keep me coming back and that’s one of the qualities of MMO type games. That’s how I play any Fallout/MMO really though. 
---
This game in particular though, I like how you can meet other players. I feel like the CAMP system is best used for multiplayer as it lets players flex their creativity and it can add to the immersive role playing.
---
Ya stylistically I think the revolvers look good, I even have a primed zealots western revolver as a batty sidearm. But generally find thier performance lacking in most situations.
---
That’s my plan now, 3 points for intelligence.
---
Agreed
---
Do you enjoy long walks on the beach and poking dead things with a stick?
---
Damn, that's still higher than I was expecting. Thanks for the info.
---
Yes, but it seems you have to press another button.
---
Covert Op is your damage cash cow in a sneak build. You can find defense somewhere else.
---
The same people that praise New Vegas were late to the party. There was literal game breaking bugs that prevented you from progressing in the story. If you didn't have a back up save that worked you have to start over again.
---
Also Fallout 2 was a hot mess when it first came out.
---
Most of the folks that played fallout didn't play these games when they first came out. They played them later after they have been refined. 
---
As for the internet rage when this game came out, the vast majority of it was coming from the YouTube hive mind. Most of which never played that game and were just using controversy to get hits on their channels. The same way news uses dramatic events to get viewers.
---
Yeah I feel bad for you I learnt that after a little bit but not high level
---
The comment below about players with "good stuff" or rather a tonne of things listed, and their player dot is still on the map at level 350-450 something, but their CAMP is oddly invisible.
---
Hmmmmmmm.
---
Queue up at Rose, be Rose's Raiders
---
Lever action with the nice paint job, and silenced. Makes me think of a true wasteland treasure when I see it.
---
I used to, but I make more off my vendor than the game vendors.
---
I am considering re-making my camp to a more portable version, and placing it near or in nuke zones selling radaway. Visit for the craft stations and stash, grab a few more radaway on the way out the door...
---
Duel wield pistols and 1handed, unarmed build (not new weapon thouh)
---
As for new weapon:
---
 Shield (would make PVP interested with block % , and bash damage. 
---
Bow n arrow w/ custom arrow tips, explosive etc.
---
Energy weapon in terms of The Dragon, maybe heavy beam lazer or something interesting. 
---
And finally my favorite from fallout 3 dlc. Anti-material rifle
---
I love how these perks work.. you hit spacebar.. nothing, so you move on and after few second 'bleep- you were lucky', go back and check that stash again :D
---
How did you place the first conduits? I can only seem to get the first ones to clip to floor or ceiling ... and that isn’t good. How did you get it to rail height?
---
I roll around with the lead lined backpack equipped. And the high capacity to travel with
---
O well that sucks, 99 percent of this game and its mechanics are broke, ive only had it since patch 3 or 4, half the perk cards dont work half the weapon effects dont work half the armor doesnt work,...keep adding content though lol soon it will be unfixable or a broke mess like the rest of there games.
---
I'd like an updated version of the Tesla Cannon
---
Yep. Funny thing was that I had one that worked and gave it to a friend. Kept the broken one. Lol.
---
Never destroyed a camp in my entire gameplay lol. On the other hand mine got destroyed tho’...
---
We have our own bad apples, don't worry they will find a way to meet you eventually.
---
Been that way, and not hard to do, while we're talking about pressing an additional button.
---
Sit down and brace yourself.
---
(whispers)
---
Cap Collector, Butcher's Bounty, Scrounger, Can Do....all work the same way.
---
You can pass out now.
---
For me? 
---
Building characters. Making a CAMP that reflects that character. Setting "house rules" for them. Picking the *right spot* for their CAMP, something fitting... then hunting for plans to make the perfect CAMP for that character, while also playing the game in a way befitting them.
---
I ran with a low level rando last night with my Mad Doc character... healing and sharing my XP boost, was the most fun I've had in a while. 
---
I *really* like oddball, nerfed builds that hinder me in some way, as long as the choices made make the character more "fun and characterful", and this game seems to allow for that, some are more fun than others.
---
I did the same in the beta, "then once I triggered it my life changed Maury, I knew I couldn't just be a regular intern I had become a doctor" lol sounded funny in my head but idk.
---
Explosives do tons of damage with the demolitionist perk. The grenade launcher rifle is *almost* viable with the damage it does, but it fires a little too slow. I found a two shot and it was almost worth it, even the the regular grenade launcher has almost no mods and is typically considered to be a trash weapon. I have a demolitionist/auto rifle build, so I don't have any of the perks that would help the auto grenade launcher weights and whatnot, or I'd have given it a shot. As an auto rifle build I have a hard enough time keeping my 5.56 ammo and .45 ammo in supply, so I can't keep an AGL stocked with grenades, too. 
---
I can't speak directly to it, but based off what I have used, I'd imagine if you have a good roll on an AGL, the resources to keep your ammo stocks up, and the right perks, it'd be great.
---
In that case I will probably scrap it to remove it from the game. Lol. Thought about selling it to a white spring vendor and then buying it back. Maybe that works?
---
Ya they are pretty, much like the black powder wepons, real nice wall hangers.
---
I am hoping... *hoping*… that FO5 is a co-op world.
---
Where can I get the splitter for the ultracite laser. Got a tse one but never use it.
---
I haven't tested it, but it was in the patch notes from Bethesda for the last update. Keep in mind, that when you are on a team, and one team member is in combat with someone, then every team member is also in combat with them and anyone they are teamed with, even if pacifist is turned on.
---
It’s definitely not easy for an online game where everyone can trigger something massive and you end up with server freeze due to the amount of data needs to be processed simultaneously. Most shooting games allow you to blow things up but to a huge open world game like FO76 it’s very challenging.
---
I remember back in the beginning before we knew what duping was. Met this guy who was high as a kite and skipping around the wasteland singing to himself and coming up to everyone he met offering trade. 
---
I look at his inventory... there's hundreds of TSE handmades and there's jet packs and stuff. I pick one of each. He gives them to me for free. I go around feeling like a boss because I have a TSE &amp; a jet pack before anyone even knew they were in the game. 
---
Fast forward a bit to Bethesda saying they were going to delete duped items. I leave my TSE handmade in a garbage can like an idiot and I had given my x01 jetpack away. lol what a fool I was
---
Definitely.
---
No, but there's new skins and a Battle Royal mode.
---
I think the game only allows for you to place a maximum of 2 mines down at a time. I've killed myself a couple times by placing a 3rd mine and getting killed by the game exploding the 1st mine I put down. 
---
To test it out, I placed one mine down, then a second further away. Lastly, I placed a 3rd farther from the other 2 mines. As soon as I threw the 3rd mine, the 1st mine blew up.
---
In any case, I find mines to be completely useless and I don't bother picking them up.
---
I dunno but if you're able to change your  name I'm definitely removing the space because I've been getting horrible drops since I started
---
People would still die and endlessly whine about getting killed by other players.
---
Tennis and golf would be amazing. Fight a wave of ghouls between holes.
---
Is it too obvious to say that you only notice the dramatic exits because the people that do it low key don't bother posting anything?
---
That circle of chairs was a nice touch!
---
I'm happy to help. I have alts I'm willing to lvl and gear to spare. Psn is tuchflufygetdizy
---
Condition is still broken. I dont understand why youd scrap it. That just seems drastic and unnecessary. Stick it in your box and wait for the eventual bug fix.
---
I often see green meanies in a camp with a downed monorail,  but I don't recall for certain if they have hounds, not far from the robot factory, might be able to train one to the other.
---
I ran into a real dick hole this weekend. Running around Whitespring Station with a five cap bounty frantically asking for someone to kill him and clear it in voice chat. So I'm like sure, whatever and turn off pacifist mode and kill him. Turns out he has Mysterious Savior on, gets revived and immediately shoots me.
---
I accept that I was conned, the junk I lost was minimal and I have more caps than I know what to do with, so whatever in that regard. But how bad do you have to be at PvP to have to trick people to let their guard down so you can kill them.
---
I stopped playing 76, but I didn’t make a big deal about it. Just play what games you enjoy and don’t be dramatic about it folks.
---
Fair enough. But the words eventual fix and Bethesda seem an unlikely pairing. Lol.
---
I'm near level 240, and use WWR armor, I was just fine without a backpack before, so losing the 60 capacity won't really bother me.
---
toxic valley
---
Liiink. This would make a badass digital painting
---
I hear you here.. sometimes people get hit. much of the time it's me by people that forgot to turn on Pacifist mode. I was out battling the SBQ and there were 4 people that were Red to me due to this. Did I decide to retaliate.. no, it happens and in cases with close combat it happens a lot. Unless you keep getting hit by the same person over and over don't quickly assume it's an attack.
---
But if you do get the over and over.. or more than 2+ times at his camp.. ya.. it's game on..
---
Good to hear that it works out for you 👍
---
Check the lead lined or the armored backpack! Cheers
---
You’re the guy Fisto told me about!
---
That was the weapon that inspired my heavy weapons build, but I gave it up due it being overly situational and ammo cost and relatively low dps.  Your experience may differ.
---
They drop mini nukes if killed without a detonation. Personally, I find the nuclear material from the explosion to be preferable.
---
I heard 3* mirelurk king is no joke, literally hardest creature in game.
---
You don't get wanted or initiate PVP for cleaning a guy up..
---
Tell me if you think I'm wrong..
---
Oh shit. Yes. This. I had forgotten about that.
---
The face laser spam kills me long before I can aim for the legs. My build will shred an assaultron just by streaming an entire clip into its chest with VATs, probably getting two critical hits in the process. The problem is, if they see me first and get the jump on me, I'm dead before that can happen. And their damage doesn't seem to drop off much with range. 
---
They are easy to kill. They are hard to not get killed by. It just depends who takes the first shot.
---
In the last sentence she admits that her way believing into vault tec was wrong in many ways and she still believes in you using these bombs the right way. What means that u use em to kill the beasts and not other humans.
---
Plant tato, corn, and mutfruit. You can craft begetable starch, which scraps to adhesive. With green thumb and super duper, you can farm several hundred adhesive, depending on how much you have planted.
---
I have 1 alt account who's CAMP is just a giant adhesive factory.
---
500 was the highest I've seen yet.. I bet the limit is way higher than that too..
---
my name doesnt have spaces, that is why i am asking
---
Was his nic Mavius something?
---
Thanks for a link to a post with real numbers for weapons, but that still leaves me stuck looking for the numbers for armor.
---
If it was the same as weapons: +50% ... -35% that doesn't sound too unattractive (this is on a 3 star forest scout armor arm piece, I'll edit in the other effects when I get home).  +50% ... -50% seems much less attractive somehow.
---
Aaaaaaaand we have a winner.  Say something nice and the trolls just cant resist the bait.  Like a fat kid on a hot pocket.
---
That's a possibility. Not sure what all it does but sounds like Overwolf which I run and have no issues with.
---
with the right build an 86 can take out a 200 person..
---
How many bloatflys can you have at once?
---
I think thats because the US uses the word homey and not homely to describe a nice place. Homely is used to describe a person usually not a house.
---
I thought she did a 180 there and I still do not understand it.  She seemed fine with the idea of having active silos, and she knew something of the SBQ and the BOS efforts.  Yet she seemed to think the nuke was launched for entertainment and not for trying to save everyone from the scorched.  Seemed out of character.
---
Are you wanting these now? I can accommodate with Ammo and Junk when im on later this evening. Its a speciality of my shop with an assortment of plans :)
---
I’d say that’s worth about 40 scrip or 300 caps
---
was affraid so. i am level 128 and finally settled for melee with my deathclaw gauntlet, that means playing without my power armor. would like to use my three star barbarian card to have more resistance but for the moment i can't get rid of my 2* travelling pharmacy. totally overencumbered
---
i can chance for the various situations as well but stuck in a way that i can't free up perkpoints to get higher defence.  didn't need it with my power armor but prefer to play without. my damage is ok 300 ish but I am still quite vulnerable.
---
&gt; Six months ago there's was literally nothing for a level 100+ to legitimately do. Queen runs cost more than they were  
---
There still are nothing for 100+ players to do. 6 months ago, we were hitting SBQ every 20 mins, because back then people didn't really understand how broken the F76 loot concept was. Now people have figured out, that just like in Anthem, it is smarter to do low level content, because in the end monster drop from same loot pool. 
---
And these so called "high level" events are so low in priority list, because they bring close to no value. Take the encryptid specific reward- The Fixer. Comes with close to no value, that gets easily out performed by just simple TS perk.  When you can buy TSE from market with 16k, The Fixer has really no value. So, now we got event that rewards to basically nothing, because just like with everything, you can hit some low level locations, that reward legendary drops and purveyor doesn't care if you bring him level 15 weapon or level 50 weapon.
---
Free range is just another example of content that brings to value to endgame. The fact that people don't care about defending cows, shows that it doesn't really reward you for completing the event. There is no demand for items that these events reward you, because otherwise people wouldn't be selling these events recipes for 50 caps.
---
Because these events are so low in priority list, people with actual damage don't bother actively even participating in these events. We go, we sit and tag the legendary, because that is how little they are worth. 
---
The fact that LFG in discord is basically dead, it just shows that either people have left the game or they don't give a f#ck about these new events, because otherwise we would raping the sh#t out of that channel like we did 6 months ago.
---
Not just Fallout. It's like this in a lot of the subreddits i subscribe too. Movies and tv series are like this too.
---
Because Bacon is in Aid not Junk
---
Sounds like you need to pop a Radshield and either get Grounded or Scaly Skin.
---
It's not _that_ broken, I still play daily and enjoy it
---
yup can rank up but got stuck in some parts of my build. damage I deal is ok, can craft anything i want but would like to be stronger without my power armor (and need the weight reduction perks for the moment)  losing 1 point in travelling pharmacy might work, 2 would be to much
---
Soo.. despite the fact that TS lists higher damage,  in reality the AA will typically do more damage is the consensus?  Also is the 2nd shot missing often an every shot thing or specically vats? I've heard it both ways?
---
You also drop aid items on pvp servers.
---
As an FYI, I found it yesterday at the BoS vendor in Watoga, so I can confirm this method is still valid.  Just be prepared to hop.  It took me about 6 times, but I consider that lucky.
---
Have you tried shooting legendary enemies with the barrel? Somebody suggested earlier that they guarantee a legendary bloatfly spawn, but I haven't seen any confirmation on that
---
Place a table or other piece of furniture first, then place a short conduit on top of that, lined up the way you want the conduit to run.   
---
Snap a second piece of conduit to the one laying on the table - delete the table, and the second conduit will be left floating in the air. Snap a piece of conduit to it so it looks anchored to the wall. Finish running the conduit.   
---
Use different pieces of furniture for specific heights.  
---
(I plane to try building a railing this way with 2 bars, one stacked on top of the other next time I rebuild.)
---
Get a full set of unyielding to bump your stats and ride the bloodied build. You’ll thank yourself for doing so.
---
Definitely love to see the AMR. 
---
Maybe the energy version of the Dragon is a version of a crank beam weapon? You load by cranking it up (all just the one charge) then fire. An early model crank laser from FO4?
---
If you can clear out Whitesprings I’ve noticed those ghouls always have a lot of glue on them.
---
Tesla rifle. I got a quad one as a drop a while back, made it automatic and it's awesome. Only problem is it keeps triggering the damage bug, so I'm holding off on it until that finally gets fixed
---
Personally, I think the whole nuke system makes no sense in the story they've set for us in 76.
---
&gt;Rebuild America
---
and then 
---
&gt;Also, nuke it into the ground
---
That's probably one of the things I miss the most, but even then my FO4 was always buggy.
---
It's difficult to keep their numbers high as most NPCs attack them on sight (though they will prioritize more powerful enemies first). That said, I had about 4 of them bumbling about at one point.
---
Does Healing Salve benefit from all the perks that stimpaks do? Travelling Pharmacy, First Aid, Team Medic?

I equip the standard backpack 90% of the time, but carry the hi cap as well. That way when I get overencumbered I can quickly swap it out, finish what I’m doing and get to a workbench. I’m now working toward the armored pack, which I’ll use similarly. 
---
Backpacks only weigh a pound, so super easy to carry them and swap as needed.
---
PS4. thanks for the reply tho
---
I can honestly say that I haven't seen anything regarding nocturnal armor effects, ever, since this sub opened. Due to the negative effects (which no other armor type has) I think most people just trash them. 
---
Instead of looking at the armor stats, have you tried compairing your base DR/ER vs the nocturnal bonus/minus at different times of day/night? You should be able to view the effects for yourself.
---
I think these rad storms should be even more frequent when the nukes are dropped. Have everyone suffer some sort of consequences for player's actions.
---
Wait... can you build regular non-atomic shop stuff at other people's CAMPs?
---
Junkie's is pretty good, but the other two effects won't be of much help on a gatling plasma. I'd estimate around 1500 caps, maybe 2000
---
I'm keeping my tse Handmade at 20k no matter what, someone's bound to buy it
---
Love the grind, lv 215 now and still exploring... yesterday i found 3 new places...this game is wonderfull , also i found that i like taking pics ... well I enjoy to play that game this game is underrated and hopefully all of the haters left between december and february so now only Nice people
---
Or the next elders scrolls
---
Redacted
---
I stopped playing ages ago, the game is garbage, I moved on. No need to make a dramatic exit
---
fug
---
I'm starting today, pretty excited to see how all of the longtime players will react to some level 1 guy running around with no clue whats going on.
---
I'm not sure! I was testing the Syringer on the many ghouls that spawn at the Whitesprings and they can sometimes have the "Diseased" prefix while also being a Legendary, it seems. It's possible that the one Legendary Bloatfly that spawned was from one of those. I'll have to test more later today!
---
If a person is wanted and the caps are enough the cover the fast travel.. I'm going to clean you up.. I don't take the junk unless you have 10 or more bounty.
---
bounty is 10 or less says. "oh, crap.. I'm wanted..."
---
bounty is  &gt;10 says.. "I know what I'm doing and I'm still a scum-wad" .. I take the junk when I kill you.
---
My speculation is that they need to completely fix the duping problem. As you have recently witnessed in the community and hot patches, duping is still active. I don't see any of our accounts being un-banned ever. I also picked up a bunch of stuff in a bag that I found and was also banned months ago. I picked up a new account for 8 dollars and never looked back. You should do the same if you want to play the game.
---
How is the new series on Amazon?
---
The lead deposit right next to ski slopes kinda lmk if that wasn’t detailed enough and I’ll follow up I gotta look at a map 😂
---
only place I have seen mention of a long scope.
---
If you know where Yellow Sandy's Still is in the Savage Divide just follow the stream a short distance to the south.  Its a 30 second run from there to the actual silo.   You will notice a broken chain link fence surrounding it.
---

---
I think there are quite a few good suggestions in this thread.
---
**Caution**: I am doing the following purely for fun based on what little I know. I am not qualified in any way, shape, or form to answer your questions or even attempt the audacious predictions you will see below.
---
1. Probably with high confidence. Seemingly requires significant other work to happen first before it can happen.
---
2. Probably not. More information should be limited to mods or an option that is off by default only. The consequences of information overload are potentially very serious and that risk should be managed/mitigated carefully.
---
3. Probably not. Not much to go on here except the current implementation.
---
4. Probably. It's difficult to guess by myself because I am unreasonably biased.
---
5. Probably yes, but something more creative.
---
6. Probably not with low confidence.
---
7. This partially exists already for PA and in the form of outfit variations. Will there be more variety? Of that I have no doubt. Will they cost atoms? Some may not but I expect the majority will.
---
8. I don't understand the question.
---
9. Maybe but I wouldn't expect it in the near future.
---
10. No clue. If I had to guess I would say no.
---
11. No clue. Interesting suggestion!
---
12. I think the best we can hope for is an internal API accessible to mod authors. The data collected would be limited to the mod user. An externally run web site could potentially compile multiple users' data. Very interesting!
---
13. Good question.
---
14. If you can join the last server you should also be able to NOT join the last server for example. That's getting dangerously close to a server browser. This suggestion does not match my interpretation of the vision for the game so I'm going go with no for now. As always, never say never.
---
15. Good question. Maybe? It's hard to say because I think mutations are currently unbalanced. It would be interesting to see what they come up with though!
---
16. There appears to be real concerns currently about limiting the syncing of dynamic data between clients. Because of that perceived limitation I would say no barring future optimizations.
---
is that an acronym for „fat ugly girl“ ? idk, urban dictionary didn‘t help.
---
You would have had to pick up atleast 100k of those bottles. You should’ve known it wasn’t a good idea. Lol
---
Thank you good fello
---
How do you know this?
---
It is fine for them to produce shitty games.  Isn't the whole idea of capitalism that some products are shit and will he squeezed out?  Just don't buy shit games 🙃
---
Witty comment
---
Heh, yeah, always been that way. I went through a similar FML situation with Butcher's Bounty after running it for several levels.
---
That does not have in demand attributes.  Gatling plasmas are not a vats friendly weapon, and only a bloodied user or low level/low dr user would want the DR on reload.  I would something like a two shot or furious zelots or executions with the +25% fire rate and some useful third attribute.  If they sort out the anti-armor issues with plasma weapons that would be a good one too.  I don't think you can get an explosive as a drop now can you?  I wouldn't pay more than a thousand caps for it myself.
---
I would use it. Only to stash the "you've been insulted" note and a salt in.
---
My bad, you're right, they did'nt nuke it ! They wanted to seal to seal them, but it failed.
---
Yeah they are super fun, one of the few things that will make a melee build stop fighting the queen and kill those bastards first.  I a group they are worse then the bears.  Throw in a Mirleurk queen on top just to make your day during a scorched beast queen fight and you're now learning a whole new definition of pain, lol.  But yeah I ran into 6 like that once and my med chest plate I had on my pa got stuck and kept stim packing me even after the fight and caused me to burn through 50 stims before I was able to get out of my PA.  I've never installed that mod again.  Good tough fight .
---
Not exactly, no.  Several things in Adventure Mode can open you up for PvP.
---
Damaging another player while not in Pacifist Mode.
---
Being on a team with another player who is hostile to someone.
---
Claiming a workshop.
---
Certain events, I think (like Monster Mash) are auto PvP.
---
Likely something else I'm forgetting :-)
---
You only need to go a short ways onto the bridge (assuming you're talking about Charleston).  I would go about 5 or so railroad ties in, crouch, and turn around and head back.
---
'Critter' spawns are not events.  Mole rats, ghouls, mutants, dog packs, even bees are.  When you turn around look just to the left of the shack on your right, and see what (if anything) new is there.  I barely leave the bridge checking that (give it a few seconds to load), and if I see nothing, or can target a hostile creature, log off and repeat.
---
Those assault rifles are worth 19/21 steel if I recall. Incredible really, on par with a minigun/ missile launcher. Great for filling in the steel gap from lead weights. I prefer tin can traps myself for ammo, but my local spot has weights too. And many mutants.
---
Yeah just watche NastyBonz(?) build video showing how to do this. Super excited when I get back in game to give this a go.
---
Not really, you still have griefers, but the PVP scene in Adventure has been greatly improved. No longer can people just walk up and start shooting you around the map because you have a Workshop under your control. Also, they can't grief your camp anymore unless you get into direct PvP combat with them.
---
There's still PvP but if you run Pacifist mode it negates all pvp related damage for you and your camp. The only time you'll do PvP is over a contested workshop.
---
You're the best!
---
Yes sir Limited Upwards Mobility (or potential) is what I was referring to, when the government (in our case Bethesda) caps what you can have. It’s just not right to have to have mules in order to keep more stuff and caps in a game. For the atom store my point was that it’s those who put lots of time in the game want the eye candy, and will spend real world money to decorate their trophy camps and weapons. When Bethesda put a cap on what you can do and what you can own, people won’t spend as much time in the game, therefore less desire to decorate their virtual assets.
---
I am actually kinda worried about the direction they're gonna take with TES.
---
I'd love a return to a hardcore RPG, personally.  But I fear it's gonna be of the overly-simplified stuff they started with Oblivion and continued into Skyrim. Don't get me wrong... I had a TON of fun in both games, but they aren't exactly RPGs anymore... more like "pick your preferred style of combat" games with minor story choices.
---
But, an open world with say... room for 4 characters in it? Would be EPIC.
---
should have done strawpoll.
---
I have hidden flamingos, lurking, watching you....
---
i know that most people are big fans of this build, might try it. Playing fallout 4 i never played melee. this time i did start shogunner / heavy gunner again but changed to melee. didn't think i would like it but i did. might be the same for the bloodied build. i know there is autostim armor, perks etc but i would still be looking way more often how my health was doing i guess, would be a stress factor if that makes sense.  Now i mostly play 100% health and have always 100+ stimpacks on me lol
---
agreed.
---
This is the first I have heard of
---
... you don’t actually get a *bounty* for friendly fire to other players. That just opens you up to PVP with them, and them (and their teammates) only.
---
Yeah, I've heard of those. And how exactly does a pacifist mode limit my play? Will I become ghost or something, will everyone become a ghost towards me, stuff like that. I hated that in gta, but it kinda made sense I guess.
---
Lol
---
Understandable. Probably just gonna toss it in my vendor for 500 caps.
---
&gt;&gt; Rebuild America
---
&gt; and then
---
&gt;&gt; Also, nuke it into the ground
---
It's tough to rebuild America with Scorchbeasts flying around, try building a base next to a fissure site
---
Did he say he was on a Survival server? I missed that if he did..
---
That is because you only ever see the dramatic exits. The silent ones goes unnoticed.
---
Literally the exact reason I unsubbed from       
---
r/fallout and r/Bo4 got to the point it was constant bitching and I was over it at a point
---
Sounds fair. Punishing if you're actively looking for combat.
---
I hoped this was coming. What comes after the =?
---
Right you are.. been involved with a few times.
---
I rest my case, someone who admits they can't cut it in PvP and hangs out in Adventure just to jump workshops
---
I thought you were talking about sheepsquatch legs. Assualtrons get taken out like quick Daniel-san when I aim for their legs. Usually I spot them before they do me and take them out in two shots with my lever action and all the sneak damage.
---
Y/Triangle/Space friend. Don’t leave out the master race.
---
Most hated:
---
No.1 - Horde Mirelurk Kings 
---
No.2 - Bunch Mr Gutsys
---
No.3 - 3 high level yao-guai 
---
...
---
No.76 - Opossum
---
Season 4 hasn't started yet :(
---
I'm usually a 5 capper, low level 10 and under....not too much work there. I leave the junk and just want to fulfill the achievement. I'm level 120 now and I've been taught a lot of lessons the hard way. Instead of reading all the rules before playing Fallout 76, I just jumped in and played, "trial by fire," learning curve. Some of those experiences were very painful, however I have learned so much about the game now.
---
People have been suggesting potentially lootable stashes since the game launched. Personally I wouldn't like it, though it might be a good feature to add to survival mode.
---
Every item created has a unique creation ID.  If an item is duped, it has the same ID as another item.  Bam, duped.
---
Where'd you get the game for $8?
---
You're serious, aren't you? FO76 reuses a lot of the Fallout 4 assets, which weren't a good lookers back then let alone now. So they added a few god rays? ... F. E. A. R. from 2007 drops by to say hello.
---
They are improving to reach the standards of 10 years ago, always behind on everything. That's not improvement but catching up to oudated standards.
---
I was like level 55 when I learned this, so don't feel too bad
---
Because it's a post apocalyptic wasteland, and raiders are an important set of factions in the world. If people want to play this way, then they have every right to. 
---
I wish Bethesda would stop pandering to feeble minded individuals. It's a game and nobody can hurt you!
---
Knew so many bottles were too good to be true and sadly now I pay the price.
---
lol dupers
---
I used to sell mine at 250c as a service to players, then some chucklehead would always buy every single serum, to resell to vendors at 400c.
---
So I upped my prices to 350c to find a middle ground between offering them to people who need them, and chintzy people trying to profit off of my generosity.
---
Lol yeah, just didnt want to tout the steel when he wants plastic. As a heavy weapons player I need massive amounts of steel for 50cal ammo etc. I personally find it very satisfying to melt down those claimed weapons to make ammunition to kill their friends with when I come back.  Or when I am going to move my camp I run uranium fever, the shotguns break down into a massive pile of steel and wood and their are 4 bags of concrete in there.
---
Nah your still visible it just makes it so you wont get hurt by other players and they cant damage your camp :)
---
You’re not alone.  I was well over 50 before I learned this, and only did so because it was a free perk card for a second character.  All the search cards are great for item/cap supplementation.
---
Yeah my friend had a problem with that. Several high levels just raided his camp for luls. Didn't steal much, just destroyed everything.
---
CDKeys website
---
I have the exact same game at my camp on PlayStation. I also have 10 of them hidden and I offer cap amounts based on the level of player playing. The majority of players do not even want the cap reward, they just want to play.
---
If they had this ability why didn’t they just delete all the duped items? Look what they did back in feb, they only singled out accounts with astronomical weight nothing else.
---
I was thinking the same lol. Imagine creating a super fortress protecting that stash and get you a 100 caps bounty only to reach it and find out that has raw fertilizer and toilet paper inside.
---
I wouldn't do both. Pick one or the other.
---
Yeah that's nothing compared to how many hops I did looking for x01 mods haha. Thank you so much for the info
---
I experienced a rad storm my first or second day in the game. I’d never played a Fallout game before, so I had no idea what was going on. There I was, this single-digit level noob cowering in a boxcar at the Morgantown train depot to try to stay out of the radioactive lightning. I thought, “man even the weather in this game is out to kill me!” I didn’t realize at the time what a rarity it was, so for a while afterward I instinctively sought shelter every time the sky clouded over.
---
I have been doing the infinite bloatfly thing as my means of farming acid.
---
Also, I have found that you  get into a "type of bloatfly" loop. I spawned about 3 dozen glowing, non-aggressive (to me) bloatflies in a row yesterday.
---
If you really want to play, can't you just make a new account?
---
They've raised the price to $15 and can't find it anywhere cheaper.
---
North Toxic Valley - Willard Corporate Housing
---
Workshops can be contested from anywhere within the workshop zone boundaries, not just by using the bench.
---
A box will help protect you but won't protect the workshop itself.
---
Need to buy the game again
---
\&gt; It would give an actual reason to players to lock their rooms 
---
It would also be a reason for people to start blowing holes in out walls. no thanks.
---
350 is where mine are as well.
---
That would mean less players per world... or else it's gonna get laggy and messy.
---
The only thing that will plummet is your heart rate when you see another drill in the boss’ corpse 👌
---
FO76 launch reminded me of Ultima Online’s launch.  That’s saying a lot for how far things supposedly have progressed.
---
And $15 is going to just kill you? Unless it’s mommy and daddy’s money then I see your problem. Nut up and rebuy it
---
what? no lol
---
I was just typing "fuck" in a silly way
---
Yeah, but I think the point is that there are plenty of them. The fissure network is like an anthill of some sort, blasting an entrance does'nt mean you wiped the entire colony.
---
Taggerdy thought the SBs were limited in numbers, and led by a queen of some sort. She was badly wrong, as she saw in the glassed caverns.
---
Thanks for the info. Can't wait to sell them too
---
oh :(
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah over the weekend I saw quite a few that werent actually there!
---
These are all pretty good. I don’t know about shields because there would have to be perk support for them to be really useful (similar to Skyrim) but otherwise cool.
---
But whats it called?
---
As with all things, it comes down to pros and cons.
---
I use controller on PC lol
---
That's why I only claim workshops from enclosed areas. While crouched/stealthed.
---
If there's not a convenient enclosed space big enough for a workbench and a stash, then the first thing I do is build a box with no doors around me, haha.
---
I just use workshops as a pit stop when I'm over-encumbered, I don't need to be sniped while trying to dump off 400 carry weight of crap I've picked up.
---
I did your poll as well, just weighing in. He’s right, if I go too low people buy them to flip into the vendors.
---
Yes I built a fusion generator at a lower level guys camp letting him get rid of the 5 large generators he was running.
---
When i get on after work i need .308 and 5mm ammo by the thousands
---
Pleasure.
---
Fasnacht sausages are the wurst.
---
Well, I ran with a low-level rando last night, just playing medic for him...and after he logged off, I kept all his low level quests for some reason.
---
Maybe it's tied to that? Some remnants of players that just logged off, or something?
---
I believe I have one somewhere in my stash too, I'm going to try this if I remember to bring it out
---
ooooooh.
---
That's what I did. 300 becomes 500 caps for me.
---
..... You know what survival mode is for right?
---
 The game files say that it should be able to spawn art any of these green markers in the forest region:
---
https://i.imgur.com/BHDTwz1.jpg
---
The 4 that I've confirmed so far are marked in red.
---
i have no clue what you are trying to say...
---
Seems EVERYONE who is banned picked up duped items out of bags.
---
Why not just contact Bethesda directly and get an actual answer?  Oh... that doesn't win you internet points?
---
dont cry pls
---
I need a way to transfer items between characters. My stealth sniper has a TSE Gatling that my heavy gunner PA character needs badly.
---
I use it because my FPS drops in nuke zones, especially Whitespring nuke zones. So my aim is garbage.
---
I tend to just follow around higher level players to help kill mobs, since I can't easily solo them. I felt bad every time I accidentally shot a player in the back instead of the ghoul they were fighting.
---
So now I just have pacifist enabled all the time.
---
I’m going to shoot this down. You can literally make your base, inaccessible. Like totally inaccessible. Mine is, the only way in and out is a keypad on the front, and a switch on the inside. So yay, 200 free space.
---
Strange in numbers is broke
---
Adrenal reaction is broke
---
Radresist on armor is broke
---
Armor mods broke
---
Pipe rifle is still considered a pistol
---
Meat hook is broke
---
Textures are screwed
---
Too much damage means no damage registered
---
Legendary effects are broke
---
So if their perks, mutations, and legendary effects, and mods are broke than yes its very broke still very broke.
---
I duped your comment
---
You forgot to flush.
---
There’s a guy who did some extensive bloatfly tesing a few months ago. Made a youtube video too. He must have had close to 20 up at one point. I think he found that the type of bloatflies you got depended on the zone you were in- they matched the level range for that zone (up to a limit; bloatflies cap out at 27 I believe
---
I quit playing so long ago, and it was just because I was a melee build and couldn’t touch the final boss. Have they even introduced anything new?? It seemed like such a small game at the time
---
As someone who grinded for bells in the original Animal Crossing in order to unlock a fucking *tissue box,* I can attest to the fact that these items don't even have to be crazy...they just need to exist. Forget a giant piggy bank, just a little one would get me to shell out 25k caps...especially if it made a noise if you interacted with it lmao.
---
I don’t like any of those ideas personally. Seen many requests for shields on here though, so you’re certainly not alone on that one.
---
I thought that tape only pops up if you nuke anything BUT the SBQ? So she’s pissed because people are nuking eachother “Starting a nuclear arms race”?
---
Agreed for many and it's a humorous jab I think everyone should be able to giggle at.
---
That noted, I'm glad there are peeps who dig the game, but it just wasnt for me.  Excellent concept but didnt end up what I had foolishly hoped.
---
I loved the BETA, but didnt realize the appeal was the time window and the joy of my 4th fallout 4 run going high.
---
Launch day I found the game to be boring after 2 to 4 hours and that it was painfully empty compared to fall out 4 in the ways of NPCs and I thought I'd be ok with it, but I wasnt.  Once I got to Rose, I really DID feel that intense and empty sense the World tries to convey and realized I'd likely give up if IRL because once I realized the only interaction I'd have would be strangers online whom, up to that point were utter dicks, I decided to power down and go back to rocket league and Europa IV.
---
It's great for camp budget efficiency too, plant half the plants, yield double the stuff!
---
Good idea ;)
---
Just joined the sub now my love of 76 and the expanse can be toxified
---
Seems reasonable to me. It isn’t legendary, but it’s pretty rare still, so that seems like a fair price.
---
This. I mean, you can just build solid walls around it and go into edit mode when you want access.
---
as a merchant i have 4 vendor stations... i choose one to add more items to sell, and then a player comes to buy stuff
---
So, he has 4 choices of machine, but which one without fail do they try to access first thing? THE ONE IM AT!!!!!!!!
---
there are 3 other @#$#@$ machines!  choose one of those that isnt being used!
---
this happens repeatedly....
---
and yeah sometimes people start to shoot me and attack me while im adding in stuff for them to buy
---
funny thing is, i have some of the best prices in the wasteland, so i get on the mic and let them know im now going to block them and server hop, so they lost out on great deals for being assholes
---
I did that until I got the keypad for my garage door.
---
About a week or two ago  I noticed a camp right beside mine. Bunch of plans, and meds just what I like. So I walked over and couldn't find it. So I tried fast travel and I basically moved 10 feet over, still no camp in sight. I stayed on that server for probaby 5 or 6 hours and the fake camp never moved but eventually all the numbers for items on the map were just [] no numbers.
---
That's what legendary characters will be
---
Might retry school, reading ain't your thing huh? But you can feel free to get some friends and prove your theory. I'll happily take all your caps in your skillfull survival mode. Cmon dude I don't even need to argue with a nonsense crybaby like you, even bethesda admits survival is broken af. Just get over it and stop crying for those 50 caps, stupidly enough if you run around with tons of junk.
---
you fear death.  embrace it.  
---
the only consequence is losing your junk.  If you're that scared, clear out an area at a time before looting junk.  pick up all legendaries you find on the spot.  If you die, you lose nothing (except for time from load screens)
---
C.A.M.P. but also so much else
---
Yeah, if you are Bloodied melee, that's pretty much a god roll.
---
If only it was still in shop :(
---
Or.. for zero caps in your vending machine.  That way you KNOW they won't despawn on you.
---
Move all your extra stuff to a mule, put those damage perks back on.
---
I miss my sneak build, but I've used it for the last 3 Fallout dudes I had, so I wanted to do something different. The enemies always see me first, but usually it doesn't matter.
---
Not sure how many 0.308 I have, but I know for a fact ive got about 10+ of 5mm ammo in the vendor.
---
All ammo in the vendors are 1cap a piece
---
Karma because me too I never got the crappy 500 atoms nor I expect my bag to never arrive , the odds of me dying before arrival are grater
---
This is how I figured they're best used rather than just using one too.
---
I wasn't giving you my opinion, this is literally just an explanation of how and why the system works.  They essentially copied the blueprinting mod someone made from 4 and it used the same connection dependencies to record structures albeit without the ability to force you to build certain ways so it could properly record everything.
---
there are only two situations where you can't remove a foundation, one is if it's the base of a stairwell and the other is if it's bugged.
---
Thanks! Any tips on getting caps? I feel I'll be much better set once I get herbivore. I mistakenly removed starched Gene's and lost it, but money is a big issue
---
I'd never considered it before! I usually just run about to spots I know will spawn Coolant and Antifreeze or check gore-bags while I'm running through West-Tek. I did notice that a couple of spawns in a row were aggressive so I just injected and popped them for a fresh fly. Made sure to show the corpse of the old one to it and let it know how things worked. lol
---
I just don't like the block currently in a game, I never use it. like if I'm in power armor I can just RIP a car door off and use that realistically
---
I've been throwing around suggestions like this recently too. The FOnline games did this perfectly. You could buy yourself a cheap motorcycle or buggy for like 10k caps, or a highwayman for 100k+ depending on which session it was. Plans for many items were difficult to find and in high demand, so they ended up selling for a good amount. I remember at one point combat armor plans were selling for 150k. The most recent ones introduced one-use recipes, meaning that the highest-end gear can not be crafted infinitely unless you have plenty of those. You bet that kept prices high. End-game gear like power armor, gauss rifles, etc were pretty much only obtainable from extremely difficult dungeons, ones that were pretty much impossible to solo even with a min-maxed character and drugs. And since you lost EVERYTHING you have on you on death, and items could not be repaired infinitely, those items remained in very low quantity and very high demand throughout the sessions. This game is far too generous with gear, so that shouldn't even be a consideration. Just dump in as many cosmetic cap sinks as possible. Stuff like the repair kits should have 100% been something for lazy players to buy with caps instead of atoms.
---
Green thumb and giant pitcher plants. The goo they drop is worth 4 adhesive apiece.   
---
Also, Angler Hordes. They drop adhesive pretty consistently.
---
Contests are hard in this game. I had a contest going over on the filthy casuals subreddit, had a sticky post and everything. Was going to give away some god roll weapons and a full set of assasin's sentinel armor. People wouldn't enter the contest. I mean they did enter the easy parts that can be done without being in the game (Name the contest, pick the site for the awards ceremony) but no one entered the silo speed run contest. 
---
The only way is to do like you are doing and hope someone stumbles across your billboard. I am going to experiment with the light boxes and the strobes I think...to get passerby's attention...
---
I don’t have a back pack yet. With the mods does it say what it has , ex, carry +60 weight but get -50 rad protection?
---
Good to know
---
Honestly never thought to mess around with the Syringer. Felt like too much of a useless  gimmick weapon and I'd never seen anyone show much interest in it. Pretty fun way to kill time though while waiting on folks to peruse the vending machines. I did notice that while I was at the Whitesprings (I'm level 220+) all of the Bloatflies were Glowing, so that makes sense.
---
Overpriced vanity items for caps is a great plan, not sure where I’ll put all of the completely pointless stuff I’d buy, but I want it even if it doesn’t exist yet.
---
Oh ok coz I also saw someone selling it for like 10,000 caps
---
The dumbest low-ball comments are like ‘it doesn’t mean much to me, i give you 1k for it’, or ‘I don’t really need it, I can give you 1k right now’, while a simple search will show the item is worth more than 15k. Why do people have to tell others how dumb and cheap they are, I have no idea.
---
I sell mine at 450 for basically the same reason.  I can get something like 480 selling them to a normal vendor, and coupled with the relative rarity of flux in the first place, I'm taking enough of a loss that I'm not amused when someone else buys them all and flips them.
---
I'd say I find more &gt; 450 than below it.
---
Do events and collect all the weapons they drop, even if you overload, sell them at a vendor, you can get 1400 a day this way and if you collect more weapons after getting those you can scrap them to get tons of steel which you can easily sell to players with your vendor or over here on the market. But there are so many ways, crafting ammo, adhesive ect.
---
That is true, but I think it would be worth it in my opinion.
---
I’ll never understand the current gaming trend of “this isn’t an MMO, we’re something different.”
---
What you end up doing to leaving the RPG, Shooter, and MMO crowd all unsatisfied if you don’t embrace one of those genres fully.
---
I know MMO is a bad word, but if games like Destiny and Fallout 76 would have just embraced the scope and mechanics of a MMO from the start, I think things would have gone smoother for them because people would know “this is going to evolve” and give them a little more slack.
---
People building camps under map broke
---
A solution to this^ remove crafting animations, this would fix that and allow everyone to use benches at the same time like scrapping, ive heard theres more detail in this game, that is an outright lie graphically its a downgrade from fallout 4. Need an example compare the railway rifle or the plasma rifle from one game to the next i feel as a fallout fan ive been ripped off, almost all improvements on fo4 to this game are mod makers fixes Bethesda took an used, most gun mods if you look close enough were not even made for the guns they go on, so magazine's look weird in some cases. And every unique weapon is a joke i have an allrise in fallout 4 took 2 mins to load the kit another 2 minutes to make it, the unique sword you get not unique at all, could of took the bayonet off the black powder rifle and made that its own sword, its not that their lazy its they give it a whole new name. As a fallout fan i like this game but also ive bought all there games more than once more than twice closer to 3 or 4 times, and every game still a buggy mess and by this alone i have no faith theyll even try to fix their bugs.

Damage a players camp in PvP broke

You could check out this VATS/Sneak build:

---
THIS! lol
---
Exactly my kind of humor!
---
Ha ha!!!
---
The toilet is clogged and bethesda is the plunger.
---
Honestly, I'm usually overflowing with Adhesive and have to vendor or sell some in Vending Machines when I have too much. I compulsively grab every role and pack of duct tape I see, every Wonderglue variant, military grade duct tape and random spawns in containers.
---
I never use tato corn and mutfruit to create adhesive, like in Fallout 4.
---
Maybe it's me.
---
nothing matters anymore
---
there is no common sense
---
people get stupider every day...
---
cool :) I'm still low level, so I shall work to get some caps together for ya!
---
I'd say yes.  I got one for 100, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a somewhat heavy and middling melee weapon that is totally outclassed by almost any Legendary Unarmed.
---
Reading this gave me malaria
---
it's the middle of the night somewhere
---
Because no matter when they do it,its going to be the start, middle, or end of the day somewhere.
---
Its 5:00 somewhere
---
When the servers go back up I'll be happy to help! Psn: Bellamicina
---
Or weekend nights lol
---
It's 10:00pm here. Usually my prime play time.
---
That’s when I bring out my 2 shot Fatboy.  Kaboom!!!!!!   :)
---
I love my build. The key for me was an Instigating combat knife with swing speed and +Str. Enemies take a huge first hit and then I’m able to finish them up quickly with the faster swing. Most times they’re dead before they can even react. If you throw together all gladiator perks, incisor, bloody mess and martial artist, you’ll have no problem. It’s a fun build.
---
450 is still more than reasonable, I was debating if I should set mine around there. I deal mostly in plans, and get a lot of lower level traffic through, so I don't mind the small loss.
---
I see them for 750 - 2000 at other vending machines, and always wonder if people are actually buying them at that price.
---
I’ll die for you once the game comes back online. I don’t need to jump. I have a TSE Rifle I shoot at my feet. That generally does the trick. Psn jafar_quenton_7
---
because they do it when the offices are open so someone can monitor it?
---
What are hey fixing now ?
---
Same here, just cant get behind the bloodied idea
---
I wish they would have put humans in the game, the story would be alot more intriguing for me. Truth be told I only know the tidbits of the story because of what I have read on here.
---
That being said, the human npcs would be cool, but I still have fun without them. I do agree that human npcs wouldn't change the player base much, if any.
---
Yeah, and for whatever reason, sometimes it takes a good like 5-10 seconds to acknowledge the search.
---
I've left the room all together and then the notification pops up, back-track and lo and behold, there was a Disease Cure.
---
Daniel-san!!!!!!
---
Good one.   🤠
---
You know that the world is much bigger than your house right? 😉 just the time they make downtime isn’t convenient you you
---
They do it during their work day.
---
Perfectly fine, that’s the ingenious I wanted to see in the player base. Until someone equally ingenious spies you with a stealth boy and gets in in the same exact moment you move the solid walls.
---
11am on the east coast; Bethesda office handling maintenance would be fully staffed at this hour.
---
The level we need to get every possible conbination
---
This has happened to me 4 times.  The last time was from the black screen error when you try to fast travel.  I never got these until the last patch.  Now I get them several times a gaming session.
---
It emptied everything out of my vending machines and I had to re-price everything.
---
You can get 1400 caps a day (20 hour refresh) from vendors a day. Farming low lvl areas will get you that and then some in less than 20-30 minutes. 
---
Stimpaks are all over, if you running out, you’re either in an area to high for your lvl or you’re not looking in every box in locations you visit. 
---
Get the cap perk card under luck and search every dumpster and trash can plus super mutants pretty much have a few caps on every one plus a good way to farm xp. 
---
Farming the mine area next to White Springs will get you a ton of materials you can scrap and bulk or sell all the weapons and materials to the vendor at train station... too easy!
---
Mutants , stalker , hunter , and berserkers will all go for script or trash
---
You know they are also humans right? Employees who don't want to work in the middle of the night maybe? Heck its always been like this in almost every game since ever and it won't change. Its midday in America so that's when they work. If you are unhappy about that fact then move to a different timezone.
---
?? have you attempted..looking in stored? :)
---
Not to disagree, but don't we already have a ton of overpriced CAMP items if you go to the Whitespring Vendor?
---
Sorry to be a pain, but are there specific events youd suggest i do? and how much does steel go for im kinda new at selling
---
Muh 1st world problems
---
I always thought it was sort of weird that we find out that Ultracite is something that could really weaken or kill a bunched of Scorched, and we never really do anything about it aside from modding a weapon or two. 
---
We could have just did some more research around AMS, find out where there was a huge supply of Ultracite, and find a way to turn it into a Anti-Scorched bomb, you know, to fill the air with powdered Ultracite and weaken, if not, kill off the Scorched. 
---
Hell, didn't we even get injected with some kind of vaccine early on in the quest? What ever came out of that?
---
Instructions unclear.
---
Tried to login and can't. Now I will make a post on Reddit.
---
They announced this Friday. Just some back end maintenance stuff. Nothing major
---
If you've tried all the settings I'd just reinstall the game. Sometimes data gets corrupt, updates mess some files etc. Now would be a good time to do it as the servers are undergoing maintenance anyways
---
I mean I feel for them they had to turn a single player open world game into a multiplayer open world I’m sure it’s not an easy transition
---
Where does the tape spawn? I’ve had “finish the overseers mission” in my main mission since the friggin beta.
---
says "backend service updates" no changes to gameplay" "no patch notes". whatever backend service updates are, that seems to be it.
---
R/ m a r k e t 7 6
---
R/ f o b a z a a r 7 6
---
The sub mods don't get along well...
---
most companies do production maintenance during off-hours to limit user impact, so it's not a completely unrealistic expectation
---
You need a dense chest mod!
---
Griefers  in adventure are the lowest of the low, just don't have the stones to play actual pvp in survival.  Thank you for taking the time to put him/her in their place.  Like many I don't want this game to turn into a troll fest because so far the community has been awesome compared to most games.  Only occasionally do we step in dog crap.
---
I can't imagine - I feel like having 1-10 preset to quick-items isn't even enough, limiting it to controller functions makes me claustrophobic in a way.
---
I hope you all threw out the crappy bag. If you haven't please do so now. Bethesda will send you a replacement once they are able to confirm you threw out the original bag.
---
i've been woring on my alt and i ended up at the wendigo cave around lvl 25. lo and behold theres 4x lvl 60ish mirelurk kings in there. literally the first time i've ever used a stealth boy purposefully
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Feel free to add me. Psn same as here.
---
I don't get why people think anyone wants to buy some of those common plans. You've got 8 of them, and have thrown away more than you can count, why bother pricing them and taking up space in your vending machines when you have a premium on space anyway?
---
Personally, I keep one machine stocked with cheap prices on plans that sell. I'm never lacking extras to drop into it, and when people do stop by I often sell 3 or 4 of them. Works great and my inventory isn't bloated. 
---
Toss out that crap you know won't sell and be happy.
---
You can sell it 1:1 but you get around 12-20 for ranged weapons. Uranium fever is probably the best, there is a workbench right next to it and you only need 1 min to get to the vendor if you're too heavy
---
Wait, what? Why am I banned!!!! Ahhh!!!!!! Etc...
---
You get that holotape the second someone launches a nuke that isn't at the main fissure site I think. However I dont think there is a positive tape from launching one anyways. Her directive was to secure the silos, not use them.
---
I run all three maxed with tank killer and concentrated fire also maxed. I'll sometimes swap out concentrated fire with glow sighted as the situation dictates. That's assuming a 15 perception for an optimized rifleman.
---
I'd rather have named and easily switchable perk card layouts. 
---
SBQ-BBQ for a Queen fight
---
Junk-In-Da-Trunk for scrounging and scrapping
---
Walk-About for regular adventuring
---
etc...
---
Players would just raid a camp and switch servers.  Not much counter play tbh.  
---
Lets be honest, the traps, turrets, and locks, won't be enough to stop players from simply looting your shit and hopping servers before you can return the favor.  If your talking only for PvP servers, than by all means go ahead and give you guys more "fun" stuff to do.
---
This wouldn't be good for adventure mode.
---
1:1 that is 1 cap per 1 piece. Anything specifically I should look to sell?
---
Its gone too??
---
Thats so stupid - I tried to buy the Nuka-Cola themed stash box today and it also disappeared! Thats so annoying, I guess theyre trying to encourage players to "buy this item while its up" but its only encouraging me not to look forward to saving up for anything again.
---
I always wondered why exactly we couldn't just disable or remove the nuclear payloads from the missiles themselves. I mean, Lonesome Road showed us that without the nuclear warheads, the ICBMs are just big sticks of dynamite.
---
Like, you think you could talk to MODUS, see if he knows anything about disabling the nuclear warheads, go to a random launch site, and input a code that says to remove the nuclear warheads as part of some emergency back-up in case a nuke fires off accidentally. This way, you'd be firing a harmless missile at the fissure sites and sealing them off without introducing total nuclear winter again.
---
Just one more,  I'm good for it i promise! I won't ask again,  really this time
---
Don't forget to mention that you might be banned for no reason, you did nothing and blame beth in that post. Love those posts.
---
Cheers mate super helpful reply
---
Uh, gw2 did not launch that well at all, only people able to get in the first hour or less was able to keep on playing effectively gaining a huge lead over the rest of the people that couldn't even download or login to the client. And I remember, I was there. I saw kungen Steam on twitch as the rest of us couldn't even connect.
---
Exactly, nicely put.
---
Just gotta love em! Lol
---
Vanilla is being rereleased, patch 1.12 because its a better more engaging experience than what they currently offer.
---
SBQ-BBQ...ha! love it!
---
respec should come with a high cost..
---
my preference would be for some kind of scrip similar to the legendary purveyor..
---
I also like the idea of respec unlocking at lvl 100 so players have at least something to shoot for after lvl 50 other than unlocking perk cards...
---
As long as you stay in Adventure Mode.   Survival mode even once and you'll have people Mini Nuke your base.   Or get a level 300 stalker who lives to kill you only.
---
They could update the perk basher and have it work for shields
---
The one I haven't seen is on Amazon, but I'm way behind. Should be season 3!
---
This sound super awesome. Unfortunately I'm on PS4 because I'd love to have a go at this.
---
Despises 'having fun ruined' and hates ghost mode. What a diva!
---
Bro, if I wanted karma then I could have just reposted a meme.
---
I know it's dumb but did you try to adjust the brightness on the TV you're using?
---
Fallout 4 feels more alive  for me because of the human npcs. Every mission and choice I made seemed to hold more weight because of them. Even if I knew it really made no difference.
---
Labeling the machines is very helpful.
---
The Atoms, it's always about the Atoms....
---
Never seen it like this but makes sense!
---
what s scary creepypasta
---
Than what's the point of having it in the first place if your just going to make it unreachable. Seems more trouble for the player.
---
Great game, but what does AA-E
---
What damage bug? I have the same weapon and haven't noticed anything?
---
Easier... workshops are PvP areas and they warn you of this already, everything else is no PvP... too easy and why Bethesda changed it. 
---
Survival mode... PvP till you get tired... changed to PvP by most accounts need to happen in survival mode from what I’ve read. 
---
The community asked for PvP mode and survival and got it...
---
The community asked for NO PvP in adventure mode (unless you take a workshop) and got it. 
---
Seems the only people complaining about PvP in adventure mode are ones that can’t hack survival mode and get destroyed there. (Down vote if you want but only speaking the truth). 
---
Fact is a very large part of the community loves adventure mode and would rather not get involved in any type of PvP at all. 
---
Most of them turn down team invites from unknowns due to exploits and griefers trying to mess with other players. I for one will never take a blind invite nor would I recommend it to any player. 
---
Adventure mode is for people to go it alone or with their friends and they all love it without PvP... those who want to get into PvP literally have their own server to do that on... can’t really ask for more u less it’s to fix survival mode.
---
Got some extra sunglasses in my stash if i might help!
---
Alternative to shields, dual wield with a slight reduction in off-hand damage. Maybe add a perk or two to improve it.
---
That's a nice idea, but I can't fathom wasting stash space or vending spots on trash 1 star pieces.
---
Me too. My last was when I was at the junk yard and sure there was an owner but I picket a lock for a non-owner built item and found my self with a 5 cap bounty. I was like what the hell???? I think we NEED a warning in the lock pick screen that tells us this is going to happen. 
---
"Warning: picking this lock will warrant a bounty on your head..."
---
Right now I think most of the 5-10 cap bounties are surprises to the offender because they have screwed with what is allowed and not allowed in the workshops way too many times!! with 1000 hours playing.. I'm still confused
---
Somewhere is night at the moment pal. It's world wide ya know?!
---
You can pretty much sell everything you don't need but if you just sell the stuff you randomly find you won't get too much. If you camp on a lead ore you can build an extractor that produces lead, combine that with your steel and you can make tons of ammo. There's pretty much for everything someone who's interested in it, it sometimes just takes some while to find it. Rare legendaries can sometimes get you more than maximum caps, but that highly depends on luck
---
Haven’t we had maintenance like 3 days in a row now? What is this shit I’m trying to play the game I paid for not sit at the home screen waiting for BSG to allow me to play
---
Ouch.  Upper 100s, maybe low 200s was the highest I ever saw and you darn well know its dup city.
---
Better is when you see 75 plans and 1 weapon for sale.  Guess what the odds are they only have 1 vending machine at their camp.
---
its literally the same fucking thing.
---
they got rid of the cover fire they had in fo4 because it was probably too hard for bethesda to script that happening serverwide. 
---
and because nobody fucking used it in fo4
---
This is a lie, while the game itself is generally more stable I have so many times seen login servers breaking effectively locking people to just watch the launcher or login screen.
---
100% you will just get your base destroyed by randoms trying to grief you.
---
you mean years. or forever;
---
Mines has a name on the storefront , the anarchy library , spin off of a real bar I used to visit when I was younger.
---
Tried to replicate as much as I could to it , with the given resources that is
---
Yeah of the energy wepins the Tesla in my opinion is probably the coolest (might be because of its namesake) Not aware of dmg bug, what's that?
---
Honestly yeah it’s a little bit of a weird situation but Bethesda was kinda open about how the game would turn out at launch, and if people really cared instead of whining on the internet they just shouldn’t buy it. I’m not saying the sales for this game were great anyway but Bethesda claims it was a success so hey, looks like consumers didn’t communicate their displeasure where it counts.
---
I love your idea but unfortunately I think it'd be more of a headache for you than anything else. I can't see too many PvPers giving you a chance.
---
Maybe they could introduce a mechanic where if you fly a white flag people know your vendor intent?
---
Tell me about it dude, most of them are just sad "raider" players that get their kicks out of one shoting people that have pacifist on because they're too cowardly to go on survival and deal with dozens of players just like them
---
Yea about a week or so ago, you almost got me.
---
The robot NPC's could be human though. Instead they took the lazy 'all humans dead' route. 
---
A few people could've survived easily lol.
---
I agree it’s annoying as fuck, we’ve had maintenance like 3 days in a row or 3 in the last week it’s obnoxious. If they didn’t fuck something up with every update we wouldn’t need multiple maintenances in a week
---
I have a few bloodied weapons I've been selling, but really I'm only trying for caps for a few certain mutations and power armor mods like that Tesla one on the torso. It's expensive lol
---
Been letting one sit in my stash - I didn’t realize it made bear noises. I’ll have to bring it out and play with it :)
---
Tesla is an absolute beast for groups, or even single enemies because the arc damage does much more than direct damage although it arcs to one less enemy. Plus it turns enemies to ash so their body isn't going to be blasted away.
---
Plasma sniper rifle is also cool for damage, although not good late-game, and turning enemies to goo is always fun
---
Even with grounded or scaly skin you take a noticeable hit on rad resistance. I never gave it a thought when I got my high capacity, then wondered why I was taking heaps of rad damage where I normally wouldn't.
---
I'm now treating my backpack like what I would with a buffout/whiskey or whatever carry weight booster like that - as backup should i get too carried away with looting.
---
I make things more complicated than they need to be.... I'm also a long time Halo player. Did lots of competition back in the day. So naturally, I'm bound to the Xbox controller in a unique way. I think it will be interesting to see how many people use a controller when MCC hits PC. I bet it will be a lot more than average because aside from 1-2 a LOOONG time ago, Halo has always been with a controller for everyone.
---
Combat Knives are the most fun. I have played with most of the non heavy weapons a lot, and carry a TS Auto Grenade Launcher because its ridiculous.
---
 The Combat Knives, appropriately buffed are ridiculously strong and very fast. My Nocturnal 40% Speed one goes out at around 200 a hit and rapidly escalates to the 300 range. At around 3 hits a second ... till the mouse breaks, it just melts Ghoul hordes.
---
You havent been in Anthem subreddit. It`s just redicilous.
---
I'd buy an Insult Bot from the Atom Shop to send to other people on the map
---
I spawn in when there's ranked players there all the time. Spawn immunity gives the advantage to the spawner not the camper. I suppose not everyone realizes that.
---
I believe you have to wear a responder uniform and then the ibot will give you the message
---
That could also be an option. Dual wield bloodied builds would break a server lollll
---
Hard Bargain Perk and/or Grape Mentats - then sell every weapon and piece of armor you find to the vendors. Also - pick up all those hats and outfits. Philippi and Prickets nets you a bunch of Civil War outfits to sell for caps.
---
That sounds like a pretty good idea. It could introduce all sorts of new features and structures for your camp, and give it that highly secure base everyone wants.
---
A bookcase that opens as a secret door when you pull a book. A footlocker connected to a springboard system that, when you fill it to a certain amount, opens a part of the wall up. A little shelf with Mister Handy models that have to turned a specific way to cause a RobCo poster to swing open. They even introduced the Nuka-Cola machine door in the tattoo parlor speakeasy thing, so why not try to screw around with other things?
---
Funny how that works.
---
Funnier that there are tons of people that have been playing since BETA that haven't been banned because they "*found a bunch of bottles dropped by another player and picked them up*."
---
Sure, but:
---
no RNG for these items.
---
No need to hunt for the plans or items... they're right there in a nice, accessible store at all times.
---
Hell, if you added a "this week only" feature to them? A certain subset of players would trip over themselves to buy them.
---
I DO kind of like the idea of putting the vendor these "in game"... BUT... it wouldn't be as effective as a cap sink that way, UNLESS it appeared on map as a giant vendor icon, say in Morgantown or something.
---
You are afraid it might get review bombed?  FO 76 will ALWAYS have haters, you know why.  As for the popularity of bashing the game, once the youtubers viewership declines on that topic it will no longer be an in thing to do and the tide will turn, it has already begun.  Yes there will always be some who latch onto the interview and use it to further their anit-FO76 agenda but I think that will be outweighed by those who appreciate candor and an admission to mistakes and a willingness to work on correcting them.
---
Feel free to add me. My PSN is xBiiGSeaN86x
---
This time is shitty for me because I just finished up work, want to play a bit before my wife gets home but nope it’s downtime (it’s 5pm here). Gotta think of the people at Bethesda though, why would they want/need to work half the night every week just to make a portion on players happy. They have families and need a break like all of us. During downtime there’s an easy solution.. play any other FO 😅
---
Iv got a whitewolf on PS4 you can have
---
Thanks! I feel I'm always near the weight cap for me, which is 250, with just a few weapons
---
Just wait it out...I have 15 or so level ups available just sitting there. I could do some pretty drastic build changes if I desired ( lvl 185)
---
With 3* hard bargain and grape mentats, a player should easily get 490-500 per serum from vendors if they sold them. 
---
With that said I sell mine for 400-450 since players will buy them to resell them to make a few caps. 
---
I’ve seen 2 players now resell them at their camps for 600-800 that bought them from me... I don’t care, have at it. 
---
Players should know that there are plenty of sellers selling for 200-300 caps so buying a serum for more than 500 caps means they haven’t shopped around.
---
I'd probably end up putting a load of fusion cores with only 1 charge left on then into it.
---
Really wish they would put that rule on adventure too. I get it's because the point of survival is to kill other players but I shouldn't be punished for being a high level when I want nothing to do with PVP
---
I come across one of these from time to time.  In fact earlier today I hit one.  It was fairly obvious.  The camp was over a cliff side with the vendors well over the cliff.  The floor was covered with several rugs amongst other things.  I put on power armor and survived the inevitable fall.  I do like to see how players set these traps up, but I won’t buy anything because it’s kind of a dick move.  This particular player trap was fairly unimaginitive.
---
Dracarys
---
There is about 150 perk cards, with 1-3 levels, so the "final" level should be around like, 450, where you have every possible perk at the highest level. But scan this subreddit and you constantly see people talking about being level 500, 700, 900, etc. And the people that play that much have the false sense of progression of needing to get every perk again, over and over to build their perfect collection. (there is also gold cards to collect, but to my knowledge not many people attempt to get perfect gold collections)
---
I want to put canvas bag inside the nylon.  Just like it should have been
---
Only one person got it
---
Same here really love morrowind for its mechanics and being sometimes hard. Never had that in oblivion or skyrim without mods
---
 You know you can get a Scrochbeast to follow you a long way. ;)
---
I doubt your from China or Russia so doesn't this effect you?
---
People do it. Camp is indestructible unless you're in PVP with them. Set it up in adventure, switch to survival and leave the camp, lock yourself I inside, or watch from a distance. 
---
Last night in survival I saw a well-stocked vendor camp and told my Bros 'cover me, I'm going shopping'.
---
you need the herbivore mutation to avoid diseases sir!
---
Bethesda is all smoke and mirrors the old bait-and-switch it shows in their game.
---
Lots of people think lots of things are worth *waaaaaaay* more than they actually are.
---
Some of the prices for things I see just make me laugh.
---
Saw a player this weekend asking for 5K caps for a Fixer.  And they were selling the plans for it for 10K.
---
Come check us out ---&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
Yes, as long as it’s on the same console, not sure about PC
---
Can't argue with abit of disintigration/gooification being damb fun. But I've noticed that it seems if an enemy is ash or goo it seems to atleast delay thier respawn if not completely halt it. Anyone else ever notice this, or just me?
---
I would also recommend maxing out rifleman first and securing a good ammo stockpile before shifting to commando.
---
Yes it specifically details the positives &amp; negatives OP just didn’t read the fine print!
---
Really? Maybe ive lucked out then. Cos it hasnt happened since i started doing that
---
People have kids and jobs that love them to work overtime, so sometimes the middle of the night is the only time people can play.
---
Also it's the middle of the standard work day on the east coast and the middle of the night in Australia/Asia, so maybe this is a statically less played time of day.
---
Ha ha
---
Thanks. I've noticed many vendors dont take ammo, so I can skip that, right
---
Duping is still an issue with one that had to be fixed last week with that maintenance. Until they can resolve this I doubt they’ll bring anyone back.
---
I’m just glad they are continuously doing fixes - with all the games out there that are seemingly abandoned by their makers, I like the attention FO76 gets on a regular basis.
---
Keep in mind that pvp is normally against your will. When a user is asking if they can pvp against you.. They are showing their desire to get past a challenge while respecting your will at the same time. I would recommend that when asked that you say yes and help him out. He may even reward you with some awesome gifts. a true pvp player is NOT going to ask you and he will take your junk as a reward.
---
PC ign FarPlace
---
If you need a pvp person to kill, sure I will help you with this challenge, just let me know that's what you want. I will even get out of PA/ take off armor to make it easy.
---
For little guys it's kool to see how many shots it takes to kill a level 200+ player.
---
I get these plans ALL THE TIME! Usually I drop them just because they are given to you by what ever quest anyway. I do sell the plans in my vending machine for 25c each in case some lowish level wants to get them and craft it before his free set
---
Add me my psn is dr-waffle25 I can help you out on stuff whenever I'm on.
---
love the title.
---
Yeah and I'm sure a majority of the world doesn't play at 3am like you. 😘.  They probably sleep.
---
Its coming with nuclear winter, just gotta wait it out.
---
This is whats on their road map.
---
New Feature: Legendary Players
---
There will also be a new feature called Legendary Players: "An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities."
---
If McDonald's can have a night shift, so can Bethesda.
---
So glad I’m only a level 21 and now found this out. Reddit is essential to life.
---
No one can damage your camp in adventure unless you are hostile to one another .
---
Yeah. The visuals of it. Congrats.
---
Yep he tried plus he was able to send me a screen shot of the lit up game and other games aren't this bright, so it's only fallout 76
---
...They literally JUST put out an interview about how there's much more coming and they're still working on it. You completely pulled this out of your ass.  
---
They even have a Fo76 presentation for E3. What a stupid comment. lol
---
As a real people chemist, I too am horrified by the condition of my work space in game. 
---
It’s like I’m a *synthetic* chemist or something....
---
You are dope, thank you.
---
I would love a 'public stash' of some kind - if not to just have a dropbox for extra loot for giveaways.
---
Feel free to add me. My PSN is xBiiGSeaN86x and I’ll be on as soon as the servers are back up.
---
Or ...I don't know....blocker maybe...
---
Move to a different time zone?  Nice answer.  If McDonald's can have a night shift then it's not unrealistic for Bethesda to pay someone for it.
---
Can we please have a god damn shared stash as well? I want to be able to give my alt character the gear that he deserves
---
Though that's nice of you, let's hope that no witty buyer comes before me and buys them all just to resell them at higher price :P
---
They could to make the LMG &amp; .50cal have more customisation, even a 5.56mm rechamber
---
Definitely.  Even the server stability is better.
---
I think Anti Armour - Explosive? but I could be wrong.
---
Exactly. A weekly bug fix, patch, server maintaining is perfectly fine by me if it keeps improving along the way. I take the 2-4 hours to go out get some sun, save my eyes from the screen and enjoy the world isn’t a real wasteland yet haha
---
Possible game breaking bugs they found and had to fix fast. This one was scheduled i believe. Other 2 weren't
---
A lot of the constructive criticism is well-deserved but the majority of the criticism is destructive. The game has it's issues but most of the complaints are overblown hysteria... People are upset because it's not the type of game they wanted from Bethesda and they use the game's minor flaws to attempt to destroy it. Sadly, the majority of the content creators are leading the charge. They are using peoples resentment for personal gain. I understand and respect people making a living of bashing video games but gamers/gaming communities are getting more bitter by the day. They are in desperate need for more prominent, positive content creators.
---
Depends where from russia... Hm?
---
Until people literally can't WALK in through my big brick "window" or glitch into my house using a camp item, no thanks.
---
Thanks that's a great help!
---
You're definitely an optimist...hang in there!
---
So it MUST BE DONE in the morning for hours.
---
Things are funny because they are true. I've updated the game more times than I've played it in the past 2 months... but am I truly willing to just let it go?
---
I find with a piece of Chemelion armour and Marsupial Mutation I can usually get somewhere high and stay hidden. Or I just rock some Power Armour. I also always have level one Glow Sight equipped because of how often I run into the gits without planning for them.
---
Good to know. Might do that.
---
Agreed - gives me a chance to do the things I normally would put off for awhile :)
---
What kind of ammo do you have? Do you have a vendor station at your camp? 
---
If so sell the ammo at your camp for 1 cap each. There’s way too many buyers for ammo!
---
Dont accept it then. Its not pity. Beta players had no help when we started and it can be hard to get stuff early on for solo players
---
Then don't take it.
---
\*continues to pray to Todd\*
---
Yeah, we know.

---
Every type and I can sell it there
---
I primarily use melee weapons in power armor, as heavy guns never have enough ammo to be effective and are heavy, wasting perk space for me
---
Me too it just keeps happening before I gotta go to work so it ruins my morning play.
---
McDonald’s in the US where I grew up there was no night shift homes.. and your comment is what you should remember STAY IN SCHOOL or you’re going to be on night shift and McD’s asking if they want just the sandwich or full meal
---
Nobody is forcing you to take it...
---
Actually they can damage your camp if your not in Pacifist mode. They even said it in the patch notes last month :)
---
You and another player have to get together to create a child and then protect the child or so much time to repopulate 76. Unless the more children  created that grow to adult successfully the landscape around 76 changes to our knowledge passed to them to where they can rebuild. Also would show what players are more dedicated to a faction.
---
my bad, reddit doesnt always show me things.
---
deleting.
---
To get to 376 I had all four full, no duping just a bunch of friends giving me theirs and farming Grahm for rare ones :)
---
I am betting they would be gone in a night... so you wouldn't be wasting it very long.  :)
---
Ok where from Russia are you?
---
It's night time in Japan. Most of the players are asian, duh.

When you make them use super duper perk card along with scientist (to double) and contractor to reduce supplies cost.

Couple hours. You can check the status here: https://bethesda.net/en/status

Bulk reduces weight only for aluminum and lead, so far I remember.

Like the Insult Bot from the Fallout 76 Podcast
---
You mean "the raiders"  hic hic
---
How did you get the quest to complete?  I have all the holo tapes including the optional ones and launched a nuke at the Queen but it still is on my to do list as "follow the overseer"
---
This is on PC.
---
I have the same issue ever since I bought an hdr 4k TV. Some walls reflecting light physically hurt my eyes. Adds to the immersion I guess! Don't stare directly into the sun.
---
I just want to mod my crossbow
---
Eh. I quit recently but that was more because I felt done with the main quest and didn't see anything else to do as a solo.   
---
Though TBH, it was the enclave quest where it just ends and the AI tells you "just grind out some legendaries" before you can keep progressing. That one oddly enough pissed me off a lot.
---
Standard triggered comment about duping evil scum.
---
Put your water and food in your hot bar.
---
1 cap each and you’ll sell a ton! 308 and 5.56 and 45 are great sellers!
---
Its a shame the game didn't live up to the hype. Lost over half the playerbase in the first month
---
dang you on ps4?
---
Fine. Don't take my free water food and chems.
---
Finally a good idea pitched on this sub
---
What about missiles and nukes too
---
3am EST is 9am for me buddy 😉 you know the continents you first get to across the Atlantic? That’s me 🗺 check a map
---
Well, duh. 
---
But if we only saw one or two dramatic exits from the game, that would be a lot more valid. Given that the dramatic Fallout exit is practically a genre of literature, your argument, while still valid, doesn't carry quite as much weight.
---
Now that you know how to use it, welcome to *having more chems than you know what to do with*-town!
---
Exactly. It's lore breaking, like an idiot from vault kills 1000 ghouls, slays 100 scorchbeasts, destroys 5000 scorched, finishes 100 missions that's original owner got killed for no reason whatsoever, nukes the damn place... three times, breaks 4000 robots and powers up 3 nuclear plants and... you get the point, player character is superhuman... Meanwhile even the toughest raiders, fire breathers, BoS soldiers, responders and lone survivors have just died because they don't know how to boil water or something similiar. Like that's just lazy writing in order to force feed Battle Royale copy pasta.
---
Bethesda is game studio, i hope you guys who bought limited edition for helmet, get new bag from better matterial, but don't kick dead horse.
---
Imagine devs tailoring some bags instead of fixing bugs, lol.
---
I was number one with like 17k points just sitting in a chair at the station and people just walked by
---
lootable stash box. Now. It will hurt the friendly environment or doesn't work at all in adventure mode. 1000 stash box, yes it is long overdue. and a 200 bank stash box to share things account wide would also be great...
---
And no, i'am not done with 1200 stash space. This has to grow if fallout 76 should stay for hopefully years to come. They have to enhance it. How should it otherwise work to get more content and more loot over time and not more space.... It will also hurt the economy. And it should not be difficult either.
---
Just a few suggestions:
---
\-Bulk Ammo with much less weight
---
\-Bulk junk much less weight on a pallett (craftable with wood and plastic)
---
\-recipe book for every clothing you scrap (like in WoW)
---
It's mainly hip firing and VATS (which uses hip fire stats). Aiming down sights mitigates the lower accuracy somewhat but it's still not perfect. Just try shooting against a wall from short/mid/long range and you'll see where the bullets hit.
---
O.o I had no idea contractor helps out with crafting too. I thought it was for camp building only. Thank you so much for this info.
---
The themes of this game are open to individual interpretation, which is one of its best features, but without getting into details that will inevitably set off a shitstorm of posts, there are messages here about America’s current political agendas at home and abroad.
---
It's a **HUGE** tradition to for the higher level players to help gear up newbies out of the vault. Some chems, some ammo and level appropriate pipe weapons and leather armor.
---
Be grateful the community is so good. Don't muck it up.
---
Agreed. 100%.
---
I feel you.. Fallout has always worked for many of the adults in the game world. I'm 52 and love it. my dad is even playing the game with me now and also loving it.
---
I have 2 tickets in to Bethesda for support, one being for this inability for Pre-Order people not being able to get the atoms for discovering place. Initial support is looking pretty bad.. but depending on the outcome of this ticket. I'd be wiling to say Bethesda may have turned things around. B, just deal with us fairly and it will be ok, but you need to get better support techs.
---
not pity dude. just don't take the shit if you don't want it.
---
And they handed the project to a new acquisition team that had no experience in anything related to doing that, and no experience with Fallout at all.
---
Pretty sure 76 was just a quick attempt at a cash grab to tide people over until their other AAA titles hit...not that that's a bad thing mind you. Take existing assets, put a bandaid on it to allow multiplayer, and see if you can make it interesting enough to sell.
---
BGS-Austin did a pretty great job at making the whole thing into a product that was true (enough) to the FO line, with a pretty cohesive (though still under development) story line.  They're a little shaky on the technical side, and I believe woefully understaffed to turn it into the glowing icon that most FO fans would *like* to have seen, but generally speaking I think they've done a pretty good job up until now, give what they had to start with.
---
That's not being a raider. Being a raider means wearing next to no armour, having terrible aim with your pipe pistol, repeating the same few phrases, and forgetting people are there the instant they crouch.
---
If you have subtitles on it will translate for you, it's a super vague "Stuff is happening, more to come" message
---
Soooo you complaing about kind hearted people. go play survival you will get lots of pity there lol😂
---
let's just hope you don't lose anything you harvested from her right before maintenance...that's a thing.
---
I get impatient sometimes waiting for a vendor, but my go-to lately is just sprinting back and fort behind the person. Whitespring vendor has a nice space for it.
---
Although one time I did bait someone away from the vendor. We'd both fought through some super mutants to get to the train station. When I decided he was taking too long, I went outside an fired a couple shots, blew up a car.
---
He came running out ready for a fight. Question emotes. I ran in and sold all my crap.
---
And yet here you are, lurking in the FO76 sub, complaining about it.
---
Why not both?
---
I mean wasn’t the whole point of new Vegas to hold people over until Skyrim and fo4
---
I hate it
---
It takes one hours and you don't even need to grind it. For me daily should be over 500, but i just start lvling alt, so i don't care at the moment.
---
I can't be bothered vending. Giving away plans and ammo is something that may be of use to someone else, but is just deadweight for me. No condescension or pity implied.
---
LOL!!!!
---
Thanks buddy
---
I cant begin to tell you how many cool places I had to walk by since I couldn't put my CAMP down. But nothing changes the HOAs mind faster then a nuclear strike.
---
If you don't count the endless hordes of robot death in the bunker.
---
Never heard of it.
---
The lighting makes it look that way!
---
Yeah it's ridiculous how hard it is getting calibrated shocks. They supposedly  drop from the queen but I've so many queens I've lost count and I have never gotten them and neither has anyone that I have played with.
---
Didn't know that was a thing. Crossing my fingers that it's not the case! The experience was worth it though
---
Thank you!
---
Well I mean, Nazi's sound nice when you surround yourself with them.
---
Melee built s the best build to have, honestly. 
---
If you"re not aware of all the new content then you really have moved on. Congrats.
---
Play fallout 4 then.
---
You cheeky little boy!
---
Jesus you guys need to get over it and stop bitching about it every maintenance. I'm sure others are tired of seeing these same posts lol
---
That is if he was even able to loot her at all
---
Just out of curiosity, what is your build?
---
yes look all around wavy willards, there's always one just outside the east wall entrance/breach.
---
I’m level 51 but I will help.

Ive noticed quite a lot while checking spawn points while Pet hunting. They usually spawn with about 6 Albino Radstags which they then proceed to chew on.
---
Its actually nice to see something that I might have to flee every now and then
---
See, that's my problem.  As far as I can tell the DR/ER don't change at all.  I've got one arm of nocturnal forest scout armor and one arm of ordinary forest scout armor and they seem to have the same stats.
---
I'll spend some time checking this tonight and get back tomorrow.
---
I’ve been thinking about this as a high level player and I’m fine with the single point per level up change. 
---
I’m happy with my character and how it’s balanced to use Heavy Weapons, Melee, Sniper, and automatic weapons.  I’m focused on PvE and not interested in PvP.  
---
But I can see where it might be annoying if you wanted to re-spec your character around a powerful legendary weapon or to compete at PvP.  Maybe every 100 levels would be more appropriate.   After all, you’re still completing your basic perk card sets at level 50.
---
What I really want to see are the following:
---
1.  A perk card management system that allows you to save decks and to quickly switch between them.   
---
This would, for example, allow you to create crafting, repair, SBQ, Melee, Nuke event, CAMP build, and other profiles and allow you to quickly switch active perk cards.  I spend 10 minutes just switching out perk cards whenever there is a Nuke event.  It’s annoying and takes me out of the game. 
---
2.  The ability to split perk cards with multiple levels.  If we can combine perk cards to level up that perk card effect, why can’t we split them?

I moved a point from Intelligence to Charisma. I always have Gunsmith level 5 and Explosive level 5 active when using explosive guns, but the change meant using Gunsmith level 4.  The only way to do this was for me to spend another 4 points to build up Gunsmith from scratch.   If we could spend a point to split a leveled up perk card, then it would make it easier to manage moving SPECIAL points.
---
Yup. None of it’s top tier. Most is at least decent. Especially for under 50-100 caps. Even if you just scrip it. My PSN is darthdudical if you ever wanna come check it out.
---
They really need to make some of the perk cards passive.
---
Eh, I like to hear about updates so I'm still subbed here, saw this on my front page and decided to contest your point bc all my friends silently stopped playing this game
---
Related (barely) question...if you're selling at 350-400, what is an acceptable price you're buying flux at, that will support your shop?
---
I don't do anything with flux, but accumulate it over time (and it's *heavy*).  I've looked around at what people are selling them for, but it's anywhere from 20c to 1000c.  I also have no idea if one ind is worth more than others.  I'd like to set it out for a price that people like you can make use of without killing your ability to make a little profit.
---
I doubt they go just based on high traffic play time. I think it’s maybe more the work day. They start it an early hour (from starting their day) and they have plenty of time for fixes if something blows up or what ever before an end of work day. 
---
That’s my idea of timing, I could be wrong.
---
Yeah. Thankfully, they haven't totally fixed the griefer issue, but it is much improved. 
---
Glad you've moved on though.
---
This subreddit has been toxic for a long time. Part of the reason I went to the other one, which is a lot more friendly.
---
Same! Just found out last night! It reduces the cost of supplies at any crafting station.
---
No benefit other than getting more perks, swapping around your SPECIAL stats, and taming Creatures (You need to be twice the level of the animal you want to tame, so to tame a Glowing Deathclaw that's level 91, you need to be Level 182).
---
First off I'm not your 'homes', and second there are McDonald's all over the place that are open 24 hours... they are in Canada, not everyone lives in America.  I already finished my education so your Mom will be the only one serving Big Mac's that you know.  Dork.
---
Doesn't matter if it can be looted or not, same stash problem - game/server has performance issues loading up all the stuff inside the stash, so by adding additional stashes the problem won't be solved.
---
So we just need to keep requesting stash size increase and wait till Bethesda improves their performance or fixes this somehow, because you can never have enough space in the stash.
---
I scored a two shot auto grenade launcher and called it Airstrike, shooting 12 grenades vertically creates 24 frag grenade like explosions in a small radius, very fun.
---
If it's a hot fix it's normally between one and two hours
---
What platform? If you’re on Xbox, you can already do this.
---
You know I was going to make a parody of sorts with PvP servers?...
---
Level 1 , jump into it. No Armor. No caps. No weapon. Well no... nothing. Just my unarmored vault suit.
---
Only purpose?... See how manytimes dumb a\_\_holes kill me.
---
You know, the challenge for them - to account for more kills! Oh, and I intend to come back for revenge, eventually punching that puny level 250 in the... boots?!... Tear apart his PA, just by provoking his loud laughter  ;-)
---
Honestly: I still project to do this soon.
---
I would consider paying up to 2k for it if you were on Xbox.
---
Ill try to take some when Im home, but is a windmill generatior in a 1x3 foundation with walls all around and roof on top. The dificult part is to find the sweet spot that allows walls around the wind mill.
---
the key part of what you're saying here, "patch 1.12".  WoW didn't release at patch 1.12.
---
Probably just deters the cap farmers. They don't want the workshop, just the easy kill.
---
Boxed in = not an easy kill.
---
''And for the next horrible Vault-Tec experiment...''
---
I enjoyed the story as is.
---
I just wish that the monorail time machine worked and we could go back in time to meet all the factions and help or fight them as we want.
---
Then we can see the story as we pieced together, and actually meet Rose and Taggerdy etc...
---
That's my $0.02
---
Not much honestly, I'm around lvl 259, no health increase or defense increase, it mostly only shows that you play a lot and have a lot of perk points to use heh.
---
I mean hey the bubblegum every 5 levels is the only real benefit I see XD
---
If it’s meet at the Whitesprings train station and conduct battle royale I would agree there’s no skill involved.  But the sniper type builds require a fair amount of strategy.
---
It's seriously the best Sci-fi TV show ever made. WATCH IT.
---
The map legit shows you were the nuke is going and gives you 2 mins plus a big warning lmao
---
You could be right actually, but it'd need testing other than just me at the Golf Club trying to count ghouls while they're battering me
---
I agree that the final Enclave quest seemed meaningless. Certainly unless you really dug into the texts it was hard to grasp why nuking the queen made sense. 
---
And there's still this issue of having ultimately let down the Overseer.
---
I'm already sad people lock their camps for no reason , I can't explore them. This just makes it worse.
---
That's the only way they could save their face in public now
---
but not vanilla 1.0 is the point.
---
If your camp is gonna be nuked, it's just best to leave the server till it has hit. Then you can rejoin the server, and camp will place and not be destroyed.
---
HAHAHAHAAA you get plenty of warning, log off if it's that big a deal.
---
Nah there are still griefers in Adventure, I took a junkyard the other day (unowned) and someone twice my level (around 260) waited for me to finish then claimed and 2 shot me with some fist weapon build and took all my junk. If this happens to you and you don't want a confrontation just let the workshop go or server hop.
---
Damn and i thought i was being clever. I play every day. And its been months since ive been messed with since employing that strategy.
---
Seems pretty odd to do maintenance a day before the usual patch day :O
---
Fair enough.
---
Attention
---
Citizens
---
Just server hop
---
If they go through all that trouble to nuke you and you don't move, that's on you.  Players can nuke wherever they want/can.
---
The budget size on blueprints is disappointing low and even when you find a good way to make multiple blueprints of your stuff, it's next to impossible to place your blueprints back in the right place. So there's no way to save large buildings and even placing small buildings can be a hassle. I wish this was a fix but they just don't work well in practice.
---
It said shutting down for maintenance and I tried to log back in and it won't let me.  Have I been banned?
---
Also, I took today off specifically to play and the fact Bethesda doesn't check with my schedule for maintenance makes me *angery . *
---
*heavy alarms blaring behind that*
---
Sir you'll come down harder than a nuke on whitesprings at that height XD
---
We will greet you with the love you deserve.. :)
---
I would even extend you an invitation to my group.. but you have to have a mic. It's just way too hard to help those without one.
---
PC look for "FarPlace"
---
Yesterday I had 2 others I was helping.. and my dad came on the system. I guess he though I was only helping him.. he said "Wow, I thought you were just helping me.. you help everyone I can see.."
---
Adding more NPCs would massively improve the game for people who liked the old games for their characters or have trouble reading. And it would get more players. My only gripe about the game is how difficult I find the story to follow because of the reading.
---
I agree that YouTuber hype doesn't do much good though. If what they hype doesn't get added that's more hate on the game.
---
Don’t accept it then, or better yet, start in survival. See how far your tough guy act gets you.
---
*she. And yes, I was!
---
Yeah but they announced this one. Idk lol
---
Todd pls
---
The only reason I agree with this concept is because I have had to respec twice due to weapon and armour adjustments.  The adjustments, or balancing don't bother me too much, but it would be nice if I could do a total respec after the adjustment.
---
Anthem is Bioware/EA.
---
not sure about the TOS thing, but i dont think so. But yes, it is very convenient for trading items between alts and extra storage space
---
There is absolutely no strategy in beeing completly invisible and you can't really hide otherwise because of how radar works. Free combat without anyone beeing hidden would be more skillfull. But you're probably the only one on this reddit with such a small amount of pvp knowledge that you're pretending Camping would be tactical. In ANY pvp game
---
This is basically the only way to deal with griefers smart enough to exploit the new pvp rules in adventure mode.
---
 You stop levelling your Special and HP. You get to acquire the rest of the cards over time.
---
 This allows refining your build and at level 99 I'm almost done.
---
You probably want have the exact perks you want and need before closer to 100 :)
---
So since he's legendary and should re-gen his health bar the first time it is emptied, is he capable of surviving his own suicide attack?
---
You couldn't have read my mind any better. We are both right about 1000 hours and I'm still confused too...lol. I figure that I'm doing them a, "solid," by just getting that bounty off of them and they think, "What just happened, why?" Then they will figure it out the same way we did.....lol.
---
Yeah.  I’ve seeing weird color effects on HDR on my 4K TV, especially in the Mire.  It gets all glowy and fluorescent in certain lighting.  But it goes away as the light change.  Usually this seems to happen around sunset.
---
Join survival server then. You won't find many kind hearted players there.
---
Hey.. us PC peeps are kool too!
---
It’s almost 12mn here. It was announced ahead of time so quit whining.
---
Yeah right!?.. at app. Lvl20 I figured out need to push 'search'..
---
How can you do it on Xbox?
---
Got to agree with everyone else who says it's not a big deal, but if you're really pissing people off so much they go to the trouble of repeatedly nuking your camp then maybe move your camp to vault 76?
---
Apologies ha! And congrats! Hope she was generous and you didnt get a complete piece of crap.
---
My true love will always be the silenced handmade without using Vats.  Ambushing a bunch of Scorched with it from about 50 yards out is always a blast.  
---
However, the sound of the lever action and the gatling gun is just awesome.  If you have a lever action, please don't put a silencer on it.  It's like buying muscle car with automatic transmission, sure it's more convenient but there is just so much wrong with it.
---
I feel that they are the last of the community still wanting the game to be more fun and chaotic. Good for them!
---
WTH maybe I'll even join those raider-like guys and start doing that too.
---
Getting tired of seeing Fissure Prime and Whitesprings nuked. In fact, the only 2 nukes I've launched were pretty random, always thought that was one of the fun parts of this game.
---
Would be even better if no warning zone was displayed, honestly. 
---
Yeah would be bad if my camp gets nuked, but at least rebuilding would give me something to do :P
---
Gg, it's a satisfying feeling the first time. I did about 15 this weekend (that's nothing compared to some people) and her legendary drops literally got worse each time culminating in just a drill (which IS still in the legendary pool ffs).
---
What platform are you on?
---
What they said.. Gives you the ability to fix your mistakes from previous SPECIAL snafu's and build your perk card deck.  
---
All I want for Christmas is a one time re-spec (or even paid) and a quick swap for "builds"
---
Hmm... this is actually a quite cool idea
---
Then why did you dupe stuff? Your fault. (I know you are lying about picking up stuff based on shit you have said. your story don't add up and changes according what others say. Not to mention picking up dropped items doesn't give ban)
---
i like the  game what can i say
---
Lol. No worries. And thanks!
---
I started selling mine at 500 caps per just so I could buy more serum recipes, and people were buying it no problem. Now that I have the recipes I want, I sell em for 300 and can't make em fast enough since they sell out like crazy. I did once follow a player back to his camp after he bought multiple serums only to see that he flipped it and was chargung 1000 caps per....just crazy but hey, if it works out for him...so be it.
---
With the amount of detail they put into  West Virginia it is hard for me to agree with the cash grab idea.
---
As a native, they captured the state so well.  Not just landmarks, but culturally as well.  The Overseer's personal quest is a commonly heard story in WV, except the "kill my infected fiance" part.
---
Well, maybe sometimes that.  WV can be very strange.
---
It was the best when I played... until I “fought” the queen lol
---
I really want the plan... I don’t get the time to do Project Paradise due to work hours.
---
I’d say 200 is the most to drop on the actual weapon... the plan? Maybe 500.
---
Yeah, in hindsight, I should've.
---
Me too.. My bag is getting players to level 25 where they can get the Excavator power armor. That's where the real fun comes.. at least you then have a chance against the Scorched beasts you may encounter.
---
I actually rune'd into one that was sleeping in it's nest in the Mir the other day, as soon as i was close it started doing it's legendary glowing and woke up, that little baster..
---
Okay boy.. check this out (link below) not just Canada. Also, no shit Sherlock there are 24/7 McDonald’s 😂 but why should they be awake in the middle of the night to appease you? WTF are you? You own the studio or something? If you want things done your way build your own company. Also congrats I guess on finishing school with an associates degree in liberal arts that nobody will hire you for anyway.. 
---
withhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios
---
They still really unsettle me tbh
---
 Killed a 50 in the Ash Heap the other day. They don't hit that hard and my Combat Knives are very good. So toe to toe, and down he went. A level 50 Deathclaw hits harder.
---
I gave someone level 6 at morgantown station ALL my low level stuff. Its no good to me,but he could sell / scrap for junk,mods/keep.........
---
thats not pity, thats just a helping hand. Better than throwing it all away.
---
take what you need, leave the rest.
---
I never did come down, after 15 minutes of exploring I just fast traveled to my camp.
---
Very cool!
---
Makes lower levels run from you when you try to drop free stuff for them.
---
Animal Crossing... now THERE is a game that makes you look up one day and question all your life choices. Definitely a "what the hell am I *DOING* with my life?" game.
---
Unfortunately.  Thanks.
---
True, but I'm already in a constant battle with stash space just dealing with stuff that's actually worth selling. I get enough traffic that I just drop them in a bag in front of the machines. If someone grabs them ,sweet, but if they despawn it's no big deal.
---
What you put on the 200 stash? No one will put anything worthwhile lol...
---
Do you have the Excavator for supply runs?
---
But he’s in PA, so he’ll survive.   Just imagine the damage that he would do with the Explosive Vent mod....
---
Yep, and I think there are going to be a lot of disappointed fanboys when Outer Worlds release.  The writers who made the first two games and NV so memorable have most all left the company.  Hell, Chris Avellone is under the Bethesda publishing arm now, and I suspect he had a fair bit more to do with the background story for 76 than BGS/BGSA is letting on
---
PS4. Seems to me nukes are more and more rare these days. But that can just be my luck. Can't imagine how much ammo it takes to get through 15!
---
For me its worse in some buildings when theres a lighting effect on the wall. Pretty sure it's the same in FO4. Pretty used to it aslong as I don't stare at walls!
---
I do have that set, supply runs aka jsut grabbing a crap ton of stuff and carrying it to npc vendors?
---
Don’t feel bad.  I was at lev 120 or so before I figured this out.
---
You guys know how long servers will be shut down for?
---
question, do players sell power armor and mutation mods cheaper than the npc vendors?
---
Don't worry i'll catch you a red snapper! Easy bells!
---
I'm all for more stash space, but i know it's just gonna get eatin up by stash space creep. I really wish we had more ways to compartmentalize stuff like bulking. Ballistic ammo, energy ammo, and explosives are really heavy and hard to manage. Maybe even have some percentage of equipped perk cards apply to the stash.
---
I just worry that in no time a bump to stash limit is going lead to wanting another bump.
---
Ehh I still play sometimes, game is still fun for the most part. Still not as great as FO4 and I do wish NPC’s were apart of the game. 
---
HONESTLY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RIDE SCORCHBEASTS!! 
---
Bethesda is just teasing us.
---
I want to put flight of the valkyries on area chat and just swoop in on people in survival mode.
---
Yes, please give us 1000 stash box and 200 additional bank stash space shared over the account....
---
I'am also searching for weight reduction armor or weapons but they are hard to find....
---
It’s a slippery slope. Remember when it was OP in the early game? Just about everyone hated it because you felt locked in it.
---
I’ve seen a lot less armor complaints now.
---
The Expanse show is based on a series of books based on a game idea.  More science and less fantasy than most such shows.  Well worth watching, you should pay attention or you can miss plot points that will have larger implications later.  Well worth watching if you are watching it, not so much if you trying to watch and make dinner at the same time.
---
Like others have said... there are plenty of in-game warnings about when a nuclear strike is going to go off and where it is going to hit.  Choosing to stay put and the subsequent destruction of your CAMP seems entirely on you.
---
Now if you could show that someone was *purposefully*, repeatedly targeting your CAMP in an attempt to grief you maybe you have something. But by your own account this action was done without any real thought or care - your CAMP was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
---
They don’t happen nearly often enough.
---
Melee ;-)
---
The vaccine is why you don't contract the scorched plague.
---
I have 2 xboxes under my family and it only uses one Live account and shares the rest. I can play on either or both at same time. 
---
Create a new account on your Xbox and you’ll see you can play the game.
---
I see your point, but I just don’t like it and I’d prefer to struggle to get my stuff rather than to just get it for free.
---
Great idea.  I’ll do the same.
---
It would have to be done on a case by case basis, because there is no way of knowing whether the item was duped and then sold to someone that's complicit with the duping (to spread it further), or someone who bought that item unknowingly from the person that duped the item.
---
They would also have to check for non-legendary items too eg. ammo, ultracite, stimpaks, chems etc. If they did this in real-time it could impact server performance.
---
Giving weapons and armor serial numbers would only work for items after that code change went live, and not for previous items. So the dupers would then just concentrate on the previous items.
---
Friend req accepted
---
McDonald's treats thier employees like shit, everyone knows that. They can because it's an easy job anyone can do. Good luck keeping qualified people around to work on the game/servers in the middle of the night. 
---
I can tell you don't run a company or even manage employees.
---
It's persons like you that makes Appalachia safer for the rest of us, thank you :)
---
It spawns in Alpha after a non "Prime" nuke, right outside the elevator.  Playing it didn't finish my quest either... and I've done all the memory lane quests for the Overseer, and all the Overseer's logs.
---
If it wasn't for the Mr. Handys continually cleaning the Whitesprings it would be covered in used bubblegum by now
---
I see so many who flip items and I take extremely low items and sell it for a high but reasonable price for players.
---
I love this. My camp is a SkyMaze with an obstacle course, climbing wall, and jumping puzzle. I also have a billboard with rules too and it took a few iterations for players to stop and read. I've found I've made it too hard and people get upset and don't finish.
---
One of the members of my team was through a mutual cleanup of a bounty. When 95% of the bounties are via "I was surprised when...." there is something wrong with the game dynamics..
---
So you admit your argument is fabricated, and I don't want them to appease me, just North America, I just forgot about the other side of the world.  To your question of 'WTF are you?', I believe you meant who are you.  I don't own the studio by the way, because then I would have the information I need instead of talking to someone like you.
---
Interesting interview.    
---
In my opinion the game has always bee great, and is not an MMO.   Sure...it is online but there is nothing 'massive' about it.  In fact, I'd wager a good majority of players play it as a single player game ( including me )..
---
Usually is a few hours. This website will let you know when it's back up.

You thought you could get a refund 7 months later?
---
Gotcha what level are you?

I've never brought this up before...
---
&gt; silo speed run contest.
---
What system was this on? I missed the post, but if it's running on xbox I'll play next time.
---
...if it should spring an oil leak on their shoes........
---
I'm so happy to hear that. That would help out so much.
---
ORANGE MAN BAD
---
I hate that every interview is the same with him. It’s always “76 had a trash start how does that make you feel?” Followed by “do you foresee ever being able to rectify said trashiness?” 
---
All these questions from someone who probably played the beta for an hour.
---
Like I get it, but at this point that is old news and we’re past it. The game is in turn around mode, and has been since the release of Wild Appalachia. Now we’re gearing up for “set the record straight mode” with Nuclear Winter. 
---
Some of the negativity is baffling to me. As we now pretty much have a ask and you shall receive policy going on with the dev team. Of course you can’t make everyone happy. But when a post in here asking for something hits 5 or 6k upvotes they seem to make it happen. 
---
Just for comparison.. out of rdr2, anthem, div2, and 76. 76 has the most dedicated sub reddits (6)  and most engaging community be it positive or negative.
---
Nah it was on PC. I thought it would be hella fun but I guess most of the people dont' actually run silos lol
---
Vats has been terribly off on its percent to hit, I know it’s never been accurate but lately it’s way off.  Watching your 3 95% chance to hit misses :(.  Nice video thou
---
My ticket was updated about 2 weeks saying they're coming soon and finalizing them. Not an exact date, but they're definitely working on it.
---
I will admit I did forget about the other side of the world ,🙄😂😭.  I'm a dumbass in that sense 'shakes head'
---
Sorry, on PC.
---
What that community is referring to is the RPG element of being given different options that affects your character.
---
Which is something they've been teasing us more recently with; which will be coming in Wastlanders DLC, after Nuclear Winter
---
Honestly [bug fixes are just the tip of the iceberg](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/10-features-fallout-76-needs-to-become-great) though. There's still server instability months after launch, quest UI's overlapping HUD, challenges that can't be completed (like you mentioned) - but Bethesda's focus seems to be on building features that will draw new players, and I don't know if that's good or a little misguided.
---
I bought my plans off someone within weeks of Encryptid launch for about 1.5k. I’ll sell crafted ones for 300. Why not? There’s little rarity to them, the materials aren’t much.
---
Person who downvoted you here:
---
I'm not a bot, and I don't care about this bag thing and Reddit is not:
---
1. able to help you get your bag faster
---
2. your personal army
---
3. your blog
---
I don't care about this post so I just downvoted and set it to hidden.
---
You have a good day as well.
---
We’ve probably murdered all the nice ones already. You ever try to shake hands with a super mutant in the wild? Didn’t think so. 
---
Maybe ALL the mobs are super friendly and WE are the problem
---
A few shotgun blast att hose high lasers, but yea, combat knife FTW
---
14 buddy
---
No. They messed up the cap gain from survival a bit, so it’s more profitable to PvP in adventure, always.
---
I love, love, love my Vampires Explosive Flamer. Melts the Scorchbeast Queen while I stay alive as ever.
---
I would just use the "lootable" stash as a place to give away freebies (plans and ammo that do not sell well in my vending machine, for example)
---
Server issues in the first hours is something i wouldnt even mention. Yes I was there too, early start for preorders. And I had no major problems.
---
But they fixed the servers in some hours. 
---
Other games need days for a launch.
---
So I'll stay with my opinion that GW2 was an awesome release.
---
Yeah took me a good 25 levels to realize that as well lmao
---
Let’s not forget that ESO was a shitshow for a while and that every ES and FO game have been riddled with bugs at release.
---
Increasing the limit of caps wont happen because it would only bring inflation to the in-game economy.
---
Heres my list
---
- C.A.M.P budget increase.
---
- Perks loadouts.
---
- Private instances for group raids.
---
- Tame system revamp.
---
- New mode : Faction Wars.
---
- Slot for one permanent zine effect.
---
- Bot camp vendor (+skins)
---
Ooo then you figured wrong.  Any good company compensates anyone willing to work such hours.
---
I am actually rather curious on the data of peak play times.
---
You probably dont mean this but there had been friendly super mutants in other games but u mean just fallout 76 right
---
Dude it's not about compensation. No one wants to work in the middle of the night.
---
This is embarrassing and surprised to still see it so prevalent an idea here. 
---
It's the same as the "glad this game got such bad reviews/such a low population. It means on NICE and MORALLY SUPERIOR people like ME are playing".
---
Honestly, I find it so gross how easy people find blaming all their problems within a medium that literally has the word "game" in it on children. 
---
Games with difficult launches, or just bad games in general, have a population that tend to create the fantasy that people who didn't enjoy it or refuse to participate in it must be an inferior class of human being to the people who continue to slog through.
---
There seems to be a small, but dedicated group who downvote anything that seems remotely critical of the game. Luckily the vast majority of players are pretty reasonable tend to upvote reasonable ideas and posts.
---
Also, I want to get ahead of this one and ask that no one "because it is a joke weapon." If anything the Buzzblade is sillier and less work went into it. As far as I can tell the Buzzblade has 1 mod v. the 3 different bar variants and flamer mod of the Chainsaw. And even of it was a "joke weapon" there is no good reason not to make it viable.
---
No one wants to usually work period.
---
I think it's so people can't make their base I possible to attack
---
Odd question, but... why not just use the hide button? It does the same thing without downvoting the post and potentially screwing over the OP?
---
What kind of bullshit argument is that?
---
Anyone know a good spot for firecap mushrooms to mix with this trick?
---
What the YouTubers did was completely correct. Bethesda's had atrocious practices with this game and YouTubers plus other media outlets correctly called them out. People are just sick of all the lies and half finished $60 games with crazy micro-transactions. That's what is killing the gaming industry, not some YouTubers. People are just not going to take shit from big game companies anymore.
---
It's obvious that you like the game and company, but it is wrong to blame others and not Bethesda for what happened to 76. It's fine to enjoy and love the game, but that doesn't mean the developer is good and avoid of blame. If Bethesda learns from this, we as consumers win. Games will just become micro- transactions if people didn't get angry and voice their opinion when giant companies release unfinished garbage. I'm happy YouTubers took a giant shit on games like 76 and Anthem, because that's how companies will start changing their bad practices.
---
If you're not farming red snapper and barred knifejaws you're doing it wrong
---
Hmm could be.. but dont get the chance to shake cuz the shoot me on sight.. and yes I am an ass so I don't blame them haha.. it was an idea I had.. so I spit it onto the internet
---
No. In fact it is the biggest crock of tea-leaf reading superstitious bullshit I have ever read related to a video game.
---
Jesus Christ, just when I think I’ve seen everything that could possibly be made up to apply imagined results to random probability. This one takes the cake.
---
No, please not some more crap which requires luck....
---
A pack of Mr Gutsys always seem to give me the most trouble.  With critters like Mirelurks or Yao Guai the stagger feature works really well especially w/shotgun perks and enforcer 3 engaged.
---
I did not know you could get a flamer in explosive, that actually sounds pretty badass.
---
Yes.. I was going to add into the Fo76 world.. thank you
---
&gt;and a quick swap for "builds"
---
there are options....   [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/287](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/287)

Welp, if you’re out in the wasteland actively hunting and you opt out on the 100” florescent orange hat requirement, you’ll likely get assessed a heavy cap fine by the Ghoul commission (formerly the game commission of fish and wildlife, pre nuke of course.) Just saying.
---
It's so weird to me that the paint jobs only work for a single weapon or piece of armour. Somehow my character can work out how to make a fushon generator out of scrap but can't put a coat of paint on different shapes bits of metal
---
That’s so dirty and I love it.
---
They used to be so good when repaired to 200% (still didn't compare to other melee weps). That was apparently a bug so you'd think when they patched that they'd buff the chainsaw at the same time but nope.
---
Yeah, and then cap duping becomes a thing...
---
No I don’t mean “who are you” I mean “who the fuck are you” thinking you are the center of the world and things should revolve around you. You need to be put in place and learn you alone are nothing in this world kid. Crying that a time doesn’t work for you, I’m going to say absolutely nobody gives a flying fuck what you think. Maybe your mamma cares but anyone on here, no. So go out and get a fucking life instead of crying in a post “boohoo I can’t play my game because other people have lives and won’t work on my schedule”  
---
Stop crying bitch boy
---
I have killed 2 legendary ones in the past week in different sides of the map
---
Lol dude was asking community members if they received their bag...seems like a reasonable post.
---
I have my camp in the exact same place. I'm guessing we are both cursing each a little if we ever happen to be on the same server.
---
It mostly is. One thing I’ve found is that the bleedout/radscorpion poison damage isn’t reduced by most %damage reduction effects (power armor, emergency protocols, Empath, dodgy, hell even Serendipity all don’t seem to effect it. Haven’t tested Assassin’s or Sent/Cavalier but I suspect they’d be the same). I’m fairly certain only poison resist armor would reduce it.
---
They also stack. 
---
Doesn’t make it any more useful, but it might be funny if you run into an “unkillable” bloodied build in PVP. At least you’d make them spam stimpacks!
---
Tesla is better. I have some pretty nice guns but still I love my automatic tesla rifle. When there’s tons of enemies and little time to aim, (insert todd howard voice) it just works. 
---
Definitely build and scrap some tesla rifles for some fun mods like the automatic mod.
---
Normally headgear is separate from the main outfit.
---
cool, but its usually a couple of purified water or a stimpak,nothing game changing.
---
on the other hand , its not much different than just dropping my stuff, and you might just stumble apon it. no offence intended.
---
cheers
---
Wooah, you're getting close to blasphemy there, pardner.  Many heads would explode if that thought ran through their tiny minds.
---
This is what I’m wondering about the Wastelanders part of the road map. 
---
Would be interesting to have factions from outside WV start to move in. Or at least wander like brotherhood outcasts in 3.
---
I just think that people sell em for higher prices so they can raise needed caps to purchase items they want/need....capitalism at it finest...lol
---
I honestly haven't beaten the MQ yet. I got my ass kicked by the silo mission and looked up the final holotape while gearing back up lol
---
The main reason I don't use mine much is the ammo crafting is a joke.
---
Check the mappalachia map. It has them all marked with red dots.
---
Do we need a ticket to get them or are they going to be provided if I purchased mine from Amazon?
---
...sigh. 
---
You're probably right.
---
Depends on what it is... calibrated shocks are always a good find and good price to sell! Anything that will strengthen PA also. Mutation recipes are expensive but can pay for themselves if you’re willing to put in the work. With 3* hard bargain and grape mentats, you can sell a serum to a vendor for 490-500 caps a piece.
---
Open a scrip shop. I see what the scrip value is in the legendary vendor, multiply that price by 5 and then multiply *that* price by 1.112 (the 10% tax from the vending)
---
So something is 3 scrip / 3*5 = 15*1.112 = 17 caps.
---
Sometimes you need to add a number or two to get those desired caps, but doing this myself, has been quite successful.
---
PS4... :-(
---
I haven't noticed a difference at all between 4 and 76 other than vats is way more action packed and less of a way to cheese tough encounters. It no longer stops or slows time.   I know I'm in the minority but I really like new vats better, just mentally keeps me in the combat better.  Now if they would just fix the bugs in it lol
---
Feel free to add me, names same as psn. Usually sell supplies, serums and ammo. I only use .45 and 5.56 so sell the rest on for 1c depending on type etc. Most prices I see in game are extortionate!
---
Indeed it is.
---
&gt; Can't imagine how much ammo it takes to get through 15!
---
I use ~200 shells with an explosive double barrel to smash the mainframe cores and take out some of the turrets that are hard to hit with melee, but everything else takes a baseball bat to the face.
---
Once you've run it a few times you get a sense of which spots you can just run through, and which turrets can be ignored. I don't even bother killing anything in the residential section, I just find a card, scan myself, and run through. At the reactor stage I take out the assaultron and the robobrain and just ignore everything else. On the smash the mainframe section I deal with the 2 assualtrons and the robobrain just past the lazer grid, and ignore the rest. At the repair the mainframe stage I take out the sentry bot (free fusion core!), the robobrain, and the 2 turrets directly above the computer. 
---
The only section where I actually kill everything is the final stage because you need to keep dweedle dee and his friends alive.
---
Soyboys need not comment
---
You may want to try and crest a new account under the same pc and try it, couldn’t hurt.
---
With Unyieldin rifles never misses a shot but this was something else😅 even i had perception 15 and consentrated fire 3
---
I do love my LMG, but I'm with you. I wish it had at least a mod or two where i can change the receiver.
---
Best Tesla: QFFR, FFFR. Reload speed
---
Best Laser: FE Reload, or TSE Reload, or FFFR, or QE.
---
I like the Tesla gun because it counters SB cheese better, but an FE or QE laser is no joke either.
---
I'm sorry I meant purchasing. My primary goal is a Tesla coil for a torso and those 2 mentioned mutations for my character. I just find everything so expensive it's hard to attain that goal
---
What?
---
At least it would be variety and we've got the right community for it!
---
Lvl 215 and I love having so many perk options, I can change build via the cards at will from melee to heavy weapons, auto or semi auto rifles and super sneaky vats when the mood takes me, it means I don’t need more than one character to keep things interesting, it’s also handy to have different levels of different cards like a lvl 5 gunsmith for crafting and a lvl 1 or 2 to slow down weapon decay. When Biv first came along I had enough points saved to get professional drinker and happy go lucky straight away so it’s useful if you need to adapt to new dlc. I still eat cranberry relish and take naps for the xp boost because il probably never have enough points lol
---
they said limited time ...that's like when McDonald has mcrib for a limited time doesn't mean it's not coming back
---
Downvote is not dislike button
---
You know if this topic was not put up on reddit then Bethesda won't have done any thing about it in the first place.
---
It’s funny cause theyre not people
---
I got a tse auto 10mm once from purveyor
---
Ticket with Bethesda.  The hopes probably is that not everyone who got the nylon was disappointed and won't request/necessitate a canvas bag replacement.
---
What the hell? I usually get legendary weapons or like higher level weapons. Before the sever went into maintenance I got some armor ripping sword (I don’t remember). When i can play I’ll edit this comment.
---
I found a tse auto 10mm from the purveyor once
---
Think about where cafeterias are in the game and go there.  All schools are good and some other places.
---
I don't know what happened but my heavy weapon decided yesterday to stop killing creeps.  So not very viable.  Maybe the patch will fix it.
---
I was just talking to my friend about this idea a little while ago. Being able to build a little booth with our own custom robot would be great. They could have the menu similar to the vending machine but just add a couple voice lines for the robot.
---
That's a shame. I do it solo all the time. My fastest run (no glitches or cheating) is just under 15 minutes. I could probably shave another minute off of that if there wasn't lag on the "fix the pipes" completion gauge or while removing/installing the cores.
---
Who hurt you
---
It depends on what buyers are using it for. I'd say cobalt and violet are the most sought after, followed by crimson, fluorescent, and yellowcake last (I have 10x more of this one than any other.
---
I buy every flux I find for &lt;60, and maybe as high as 75. I am willing to go as high as 100 per if I need it, but then only specific amounts, for specific reasons.
---
You can also find it in the market subs for 45-50 per, which I'll usually buy all I can get and stash it on a mule. 
---
I only have experience in buying it, as I've only sold the by-products of it, so my experience with it is kind of one sided?
---
Oh man, yeah, you had to fill out a support ticket like 6 months ago and provide proof of purchase, etc. You should reach out to their support asap.
---
I only use the marsupial mutation, and I only started using it because I found someone selling serums for 250 caps each.  But I would probably pay 300 - 350 for a serum if I needed/wanted it.
---
Well I was just gonna unsub from this forum but now I feel like I need to make it more dramatic. Is this good enough or do I need to make a full post?
---
Well, they are legacy weapons now. They don't drop anymore, but people sell/trade them on reddit sometimes.
---
In Real Life when someone sold an item then stole it back for arbitrary reasons you would think that was unlawful. Bethesda should feel pity and lift the bans on these poor creatures which we call Fallout fans.
---
That sweet sweet 10 atoms
---
Man people are sleeping on booze, 30 percent increase damage for 5 min with bock or hefe and a perk card...
---
I sell serums for 275 caps [PS4].   But...   I only put a few up each day so that I don’t have to constantly farm flux.  It’s to give me an extra 1K to 2K a day.   It’s all I need for carrying around cash and its enough to allow me to buy a new serum once a week.  
---
I’m also in the Mire, so I tend to have fewer visitors, but a higher-end clientele...   .grin.
---
Well hey, I love this idea. 
---
I'm in the (probably unpopular) camp of wanting a few human NPCs in hub towns, but this a great alternative.
---
It seems like when they do these it's either stability or exploit fixing
---
 I would say that 300c for a Fixer is reasonable.  Not 5k.
---
1.5k for plans while they were still rare isn't bad either.  10k certainly is now that the plans have been out there for a while.
---
It's dangerous to go it alone...
---
For me, it’s tweaking my sniper build, teaching my friends, collecting my armor, PvP adventures, and making new friends out of PvP teams.
---
If you're spamming it at crowds, it can bug out your character so that enemies don't take any damage from your ranged attacks. It shows up on their health bar, but they immediately heal it back, and they won't die even if you drain it. The only fix is server hopping or turning into a melee character
---
Xbox, and I sell all 19 serums.
---
Nice pistol, but pistols are not a go to weapon so demand is low so price is low.
---
Glad to hear I made the right decision on buying the Tesla . I also have the shotgun mod . Is that any good ? I have a quad Tesla as well. Would the shotgun mod be better on the quad ?
---
all backend stuff so they won't post any patch notes.
---
&gt;Once you get the marsupial perk it’s just like you forget how to play normally.
---
Ain't that the truth. I screwed up and lost mine the other day (took a rad shower before reequipping the perks) and played for about 30 minutes before I started server hopping/looking for a serum.
---
You are the proof people give a flying fuck what I think, right or wrong, by the attention you have given this topic.  I believe you meant 'you need to be put in YOUR place and learn you alone are nothing in this world, sir 😆'. Everyone knows the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Thank you for your time.
---
so when mcdonalds says mcrib for a limited time then they bring it back are you mad at them about it. I don't think limited time means what you think it means.
---
Lol even with 30+ perception I’ll miss 95% chance shots all the time.  Vats was never meant to be a fluid system, just frozen static system.  I do dig the videos.  Watching your arkos video last week inspired me to switch from rifle to commando.  Fuck the 556 usage is so much higher than I expected. Very fun thou.
---
The enlightened kind.  ;)
---
More trouble for the player, but completely bypasses the "anybody can take from it" risk, making it pointless
---
I agree 100%.  There's been so many times I've accidentally moved or removed something and spent way too much time getting it back in place because of the build mechanics.  An undo button would be nice.
---
Early on, I had problems with running out of adhesive, but I got around that by planting corn, tatos, and mutfruit and making my own.  I also still pick up duct tape, glue, etc out in the world as I wander.  I now have more than I know what to do with, so I tend to sell it at my vending machines now.
---
Sounding more and more like its going in the grinder
---
I agree with the prestige idea, I think any level increase would make all current weapons useless, unless the level increase only affects the amount of perks you can choose, in which case it’d be great!
---
It took my husband and I three days of searching (yes, using video guides, yes, separated to double our efficiency) before we found a tourist. We were so pissed off and frustrated by the end of it that we nearly left the game again for months.
---
We’ll both get downvoted by snowflakes, but you’re right. Locking something like that behind RNG was fucking stupid.
---
So you are just a troll. Got it.
---
Any quad fffr for sale by accident ...🤣🤣?
---
The difference between most engines and the GameBryo engine is that GameBryo was one of the bottom tier engines to begin with and a lot of developers dropped it in favor of Unreal Engine, Havok Engine, CryEngine etc. Fewer and fewer experience was gained with GameBryo until it branched off to what essentially is now the Creation Engine with a lot of the constraints and limitations imposed by GameBryo.
---
The latter is what people don't seem to get. A lot of bad the performance issues, the engine-specific bugs and crashes are all inherent to GameBryo carrying over 20 years of legacy code. Bethesda just dresses up the skeleton differently each time but it's still a rotting skeleton.
---
Excellent, that at least gives me a target.  I'm not looking to squeeze ever cap out of things (I've had issues with staying *under* the cap cap), so I'm just trying to set it at a point where 1) people who need it will buy it, and 2) it won't just get flipped by someone for the 'correct' price level.
---
I know what I said, and that’s what I meant. So don’t read between the lines and think I meant something else
---
Yea. Even when doing 83 damage, half of my shots do nothing. It’s better in Vats but virtually half of my shots do nothing.
---
The only one on my wave of thinking.  I got alot of hate for this post.  Whoops.
---
Check the DR/ER in your character status tab, not the actual armor piece stat. It should reflect the actual DR effects.
---
I assume this is to fix the currently found duplication exploit, but possibly some light behind the scenes tweaks and/or fixes.
---
when will they be back up. i literally bought the game last night and was hoping to play when i woke up.
---
Even a single level in this Perk i never have to buy or even make chems at all. After a few days running around i went from 30 stimpacks to 150.
---
Oh geez after this much hate for my post I'm choosing to take this comically now.
---
I agree with everything you said. I think it would be also nice to show player levels on the social/recent tab, and maybe to show teams on there as well, that way you know if you're going against a lv 8 or a group of 3 high levels and a bait
---
this, it was going to be hammered on no matter what because it wasn't ES6 or Fallout 5 or New Vegas 2.  Then add to it that it's BGS doing an online game.  
---
Most of the hate wasn't because of bugs or a bad launch, those were just capitalized on by those who were deadset on hating it from the announcement.  It was hated because it was an online spinoff game.  It was like a bunch of tweakers went to their dealer asking for Meth.  Dealer was like "I'm out of Meth, but I got a bottle of Dexedrine."  They say ok, go to the dealer, then throw a fit when it's Dexedrine instead of Meth.  They knew it wasn't going to be meth, but it's an excuse to be angry and get attention.
---
You’re wrong, OP is correct, there are people that will get you killed via PvP if you accept an invite from them. 
---
Just recently I accepted an invite from a pair of lvl 60’s at white springs, not two minutes later a lvl 160 comes along and TSE’s all three of us and loots all three bags
---
The only way how is for one of them to not of had pacifist up and accidentally hit the lvl 160 minutes before I joined. 
---
Either a scam/exploit or unlucky. Either way, I should not of been killed in that situation. That’s what needs to next addressed. 
---
People who want PvP in adventure no ifs or buts can’t hack in survival. There is no reason to WANT to PvP outside claiming a workshop for yourself (NOT contest for a PvP without claiming , you do that, you’re an asshole)
---
I'm not a vendor.. nor do I plan on being one... I'm not going to spend 500 atoms to have the ability to earn some back.. ALTHOUGH  anything to get rid of the camera challenges I am happy with so..
---
So I was SUPER disappointed with the game at launch. Heck, I'm still unhappy with it. But I loved the world they built and exploration got me up to lvl 49. I loved the faction design as well. 
---
Though...not the BoS material. So It's not the BoS story that bothers me. I loved the lore they came up with for Maxon. It's the world design around them that I hate. 
---
Camp Venture feels right, and the same for the glassed cavern. But Defiance...it's crap. I don't mean the look, I mean the actual design and implementation. it's utter crap. It doesn't look like it was ever actually inhabited by the BoS, much less like it was turned into their main base. It looks like they designed it to be a stand-alone dungeon/location and then in a rush replaced one part of it with some BoS objects. There's still garbage in the main halls, corpses of pre-war residents in chairs, and ghouls crawling all over the place. Huge chunks of floor are missing an the entire building looks like it's going to collapse. 
---
They had to twist the lore/story around in knots in order for it to make any sense that the BoS put their main base in a rotting, collapsing building rather then in any well defended area like, say an abandoned PRISON.
---
For someone telling me to stay in school it seems I did all the schooling here.
---
What do you mean with that?
---
Usually takes an hour or two.
---
The Mail box is an awesome idea ! so i can finally stop relying on someone’s help to transfer stuff to my mule !!
---
You think Grahm and Mur...something are nice?
---
Nah. Grahm overcharges you all the time (and only fights to save his ass, he'll let you bleed out no matter how much you spend), Chally likes to kick you in the balls, and that Mole Miner sells Fairy Gold (3* gear that drops to 1* after you leave the shop!
---
They're cold, heartless mutants.
---
If I had it that is where it would go, but that is me.
---
Quad and Furious are not compatible effects. I have a FFFR Tesla, however, if you’re on Xbox.
---
If you're on XB, you already have at least 1 potential buyer lined up :)
---
I think the shotgun mod works kinda like the assaultron head, you have to “charge” it for more damage. Personally not a big fan but I’d say, try it out and see what works for you.
---
The automatic mod uses up a lot of ammo though, so that would be nice with a quad tesla ;) I mostly fire a few clips and then just finish the enemies off with a TSE shotgun.
---
I was sneaking through as much of it as I could (part of my build). Dealing with the Assaultrons was the worst of it, but it helped that I could hack into a computer to switch the turrets to kill everything. Just hid in some corner most the time and let them at it.
---
Completely agree!
---
it's cheaper to make some friends and ask them to help  you move stuff around
---
?? Okay well if you fell better about yourself sure, what ever helps you not slit your wrists dude
---
HAHAHA ok.. so morally they arnt the best of people
---
I don't mind the robots, but I agree. The BOS would've tactically withdrawn before being completely decimated. 
---
The trappers made it out though! Go trappers! Yayyy!!
---
Bonus talk!  
---
Backpacks weigh 0.1 pounds each.  
---
You can craft several and mod each differently.  
---
SO, for instance, you can have your fridge backback for when you start out, keeping your stuff fresh, but after some looting when you max out weight, switch to the hefty one and fast travel to a train station to scrap n store, then switch back.  
---
Double Bonus!  
---
Use different types of backpacks (Arkos, Tadpole, Possum) for each of teh backpacks you use, so that you know which one's which for when you switch.
---
Yes, yes, and yes. So stealing this image. Not sure when we became so darn dramatic and stopped figuring out how to act without announcing our actions.
---
It’s pretty cool tho
---
Turrets. Generator.
---
IKR? I was past level 100 when I noticed "press button" to activate the ability...fffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu-
---
We got the hat free a little while ago didn't you grap it?.
---
It's not hate. You are just coming across as a whiny brat. People are presenting to you the logic and reason as to why it's happening now and you just choose to ignore it and argue bullshit back.
---
I have a feeling the scout challenge bugs are a very low priority for Bethesda. Consider the issues with daily challenges requiring a camera before the camera was even available or better still, the long-term challenges like discovering locations that have been broken since day 1!
---
Sorry, PC!
---
My comments are based on facts. FO76 was released about 8-9 months ago. After that Bethesda has delivered only 2x 5min new content (Burrows, Paradise) and other more or less broken features. Doesn't matter anymore what they promise because those promises won't be any better. If you truly believe there is something big and nice coming mark my words. Bethesda will deliver only poorly designed content and features. They have already proved several times that they don't have enough passion to create a great game. They are just cashing idiots who believe their lies.
---
Noice!
---
But you need the digital version right ?
---
Yeah loosing 50 DR is nothing but for some reason loosing 50 rad resistance is very noticable. a couple pieces of trapper or marine armor can solve that problem tho.
---
OMG don't get me started on the cores. Since the beginning the mainframe cores (I call them STAR CORES with utter disdain in my voice because I hated that mission in F04 too) were laggy. I USED to have to do one.core.at.a.time.
---
Pull one off, go fix it, replace it. That is the only way I could run a silo solo. It was so maddening.
---
Yeah then the pipes. Gotta use the bypass or sometimes I'd have to wait in there 15 minutes for the pipes to catch up to being repaired. I loved doing nukes but that shit was making me CRAZY.
---
NOW, I have like 40 repaired cores on me at all times and they replace pretty fast. The pipes seem faster to do than the bypass now. I feel so free in there these days. what a relief.
---
Thirded.
---
Agreed Morgantown high school, pumpkins and all the plastic plates and utensils
---
Anyone notice since the vats patch you can instantly attack and hit with ranged weapons but if you vats in melee you have to stand in range or right next to them for like a full 2 seconds if you want your hit to land.  All instant vats melee attacks miss for me and like the next 3 after.
---
Nah that's an indie classic!
---
Nevermind they treat their devs like total shit.
---
Tenderizer!
---
It seems its to do back end work on duping
---
Ooo that was dark.  I feel like we're friends after this experience.  If we were online I'd drop you a serum for this and hope that you don't vats me down.
---
Welp, I didn't read your post close enough. I included legendary....sorry.
---
Keep your weapon holstered and don't join any teams.
---
Thats how I survive.
---
Preach
---
What kind of effect was it?
---
I have never seen, so I want see it.
---
I would LOVE plans for a fixer at some point, but in the mean time, I'd settle for a max level fixer.  I had earned the fixer from the event, but it was lower level.  I haven't gotten the plans yet, and it seems nobody is doing the event anymore (at least when I play).
---
I play on PC and typically only have time to play on Sundays.  For the next few weeks I'll be playing on Fridays during the day, too.
---
It is a shame that it looks like nobody does the Encryptid event anymore - I only have one more thing left to do for my Electrician Possum badge - be a conduit in the event (which I usually am happy to do, since so many people don't do it....)
---
I'll run with you. Mre605rc on ps4. I got a bunch if plans to give away. Like helping new players/ characters.
---
Where was it $15 on black Friday?
---
Thought they said everybody would have one by October
---
Exactly. I was short on caps yesterday. Loaded up the Excavator with Civil War outfits and a bunch of weapons and armor, and sold it at the vendors in short order. I twitch at not scrapping for mods, but seriously -- it's a fairly quick way to get caps with enemies dropping so much. I bulk up scrap as well.
---
"I HAVE PLAYED EVERY FALLOUT GAME SINCE ATARI! I HAVE STUCK WITH BETHESDA THROUGH EVERY DECISION, BUT THIS ONE IS THE FINAL STRAW!!"

*Sways body left and right while twiddling thumbs to atomic shop theme song*

Aaaaaahhhhh..  Ps4....  Thx for the offer
---
I once put on the Manta Man costume and started jumping from rooftop to rooftop in some of the denser areas.
---
no point in giving a level 5, a level 50 piece of kit , or power armour that cant be worn.
---
like yourself, I prefer to earn it. But, someone gave me a little water early on, and that went a long way, for me. I had nothing at the time in exchange, so now I pay it forward. simples.
---
hey Im now l 111,and can still get others unloading 200 shotgun shells that they cant use, just roll with it.
---
Big time! I’m already dealing with a-hole runoff from the PvP server at my vending station/camp trying to instigate pvp no thanks . The other day I was being griefed by a mob  trying to trigger my unstable isotope and it damaging me !
---
Do you want the mutations or the mutation recipes? 
---
I’d look for mods for the x01 instead of plans, will be a lot cheaper!
---
I accomplished this using the White Wolf fedora (it was the only one I had handy). I can't speak to how well other fedoras work.
---
I'll give it a go.
---
Such barbs!
---
Don't worry bud, a similar thing happens to me at the store when I try to return 7 month old used product too.
---
No, and yes
---
thanks
---
Just don't pick workshop safes then.
---
New server, dont lose anything. Maintenance is usually a few hours
---
I like the idea but not with my Stash. Unless it was only for those of you with pacifist mode off.
---
I legit shot someone's wall while fighting a ghoul prior to that patch that took out the "immediate bounty if you breathe on someone's camp" thing

thanls n.n
---
Aha!  Good idea, thanks.
---
I thought they fixed that last time... oh well... maybe in a few weeks...
---
They mutations themselves. I think I mistakenly bought one of them for about eight hundred caps when I meant to buy the shocking Aura one or something?
---
thanks !
---
I went through all the bugs and all the fixes but in the end this is my favorite game. Even though it's boring as hell after a while.
---
Yes, I've seen him spawn as a legendary twice for me.  Not sure of what the purpose of that is.  Probably accidental.
---
You keep everything. You do join a new server. 
---
The only caveat to keeping everything is that if you capture and build up a workshop, it won't be there when you log back in. Your CAMP will persist though
---
It's possible to find that tape before you ever enter a silo. I think it's bugged.
---
I never really do PVP but that does sound pretty funny. Just keep stacking the poison DOTS and watch them freak out. A shame there isn't more support for the weapon or poison perks.
---
I think they should for at least weapons and armor put a number beside a star count. I travel to lots of camps just to check them out and buy, but I hate when I see 20+ armor and weapons listed and it’s just a bunch of random garbage they looted from bodies.
---
Maybe a rating can go by items sold or something? Higher rating means people open the vendor and actually purchase,  maybe something involving quality of items? Not sure how they could work that though. Lower rating when people are opening the machines but not purchasing. I think giving ratings might be kind of a tough one to implement without being able to scam it somehow
---
Lol. That explains alot. I need to read the fine print.
---
I want tomahawks and throwing knives to have a purpose.
---
Two shot auto grenade launcher is a blast!
---
I'm near Poseidon and it's got some business. I'm hoping to get recipes soon. Marsupial first and then healing factor.
---
i ask the same, are you serious? i describe 3 key points of the engine in f76, told you the graphics don't, and that they showed an interesting feature for the next elder scrolls and the only thing you can say back is that they used an old asset? how tf can i even discuss this way? i repeat are you serious?
---
Damn there really is no good time to do it!

---
Nah man I got all I need, thanks though
---
Yeah... thats your opinion
---
I have around 50 levels banked, so if I ever wanted to respec into another build, I could just do it.
---
For sure! Or work on the wording!
---
I have 2 PS4's, normally I use them for another few games when I need 2 players. 
---
Though for 76 having a 2nd console works wonders, can drop all the random crap I need but don't wanna use up my Stash Space on 1st account. 
---
Main account - 300/800 Camp Stash
---
Player Stash   - 180
---
2nd account -  700/800
---
Player Stash -  300
---
Need some lead champagne?
---
Aw man, that's neat! I would've challenged players to an endurance race to see who can claim the throne!
---
&gt; when will the fallout 76 maintenance end on June 3rd?
---
Magic 8 Ball says "Ask again later"
---
&gt; also i have a question about the game. every time you get off do you lose your items?
---
No, your items persist on your character after server crashes, logouts and maintenance windows
---
&gt; And do you join a new server every time?
---
Yes, and they are all the same right now. But if someone has taken something you need that statically spawns you can easily server hop.
---
All in for 1k stash limit but not a 200 lootable stash. Give it to Survival, I guess.  Let Adventure have a 200 account stash so we can transfer items between characters finally.
---
Add blaqmasspunx and we can launch artillery at super mutants
---
Should take em couple hours at most prolly 2 and no you won’t lose anything unless u are killed then u drop junk unless you are in survival mode then u lose ur aid as well an everyone u log in it’s a different server
---
I just jump on to sell 
---
Other then that there's nothing to do 
---
The last update was a joke 
---
The scouts like really ? 
---
It's getting boring
---
Seriously, thing is I already have because of the chem card, so the good news is 3 more points to intelligence.
---
I sell the Jetpack plans pretty cheap and they do get purchased, but the Ultracite Power armor plans/mods?  If I know them already, I "sell" them for free at my vending machines.  I have one machine at my camp that is all free stuff - that's where the ultracite PA plans go, along with most ammo that I accidentally pick up that I don't use.
---
Some player stalked me at the Converted Ammo Factory and did the same.  I had dumped my junk just in case so all he got were a few caps.   I server hopped and found it unclaimed on another server.  
---
I quickly realized afterwards that the Ammo factory just isn’t worth it.  I can make much more ammo by farming lead and plastic and having a workshop that generates steel, combined with the scrapper perk and scrapping guns.   
---
But yeah, there are still situations in adventure mode where PvP happens and it’s still just as broken.  
---
In my opinion it needs to be changed so that damage done and damage resistance are set to the same for both players regardless of their armor and weapons.  At least then it would be a decent fight that would last more than two seconds.  Until that happens, it’s largely about who shoots first which gives a huge advantage to the aggressor as they get to choose the timing. 
---
At least now they can’t use spotters to kill you halfway across the map while you are at a vendor.  So, yes, the griefers have mostly been eliminated from Adventure mode.
---
War, war never changes.
---
Sounds like a new strat to kill the scorchbeast Queen in one hit
---
I always loot first and search second, I like to see for sure what the extra was (bit of OCD on my part).
---
At some point, you'll have enough banked points you can respec into whatever you want.
---
gonna save this one and post it on every "im gonna stop playing X game" post i see, just fits too well not to do so.
---
I literally mentioned that’s why I don’t accept invites due to that scam from unknown players... never have and never will. 
---
As far as workshops go... I can farm 10x more material and junk in one hour than any workshop could produce at max capacity. They just aren’t worth the bother knowing you could get yourself and team into PvP not to mention the players specifically looking for things like this. 
---
Most if not all people I play with have pacifist on and don’t take workshops.
---
The way they spoke about the Egghead mutation pre-release, I was disappointed that there's no actual effects.
---
And that seems to be a trend.
---
You bet, at least for Internet life.
---
I also found this in a Reddit post!
---
Right!
---
I want my kangaroo tail. And some actual scaly skin
---
Twice now I've entered a house that I forget is part of a workshop.  Didn't know it was claimed either.  
---
Yeah, obviously I would avoid doing it.  First time it happened was months ago, second time was last night, so I just forgot.  But does that mechanic seem legit?  It's not like the player locked it.  If it was unclaimed it would still be locked, and not an issue.
---
Safe travels!
---
While we're talking about all the other perks that work like this... with Butcher's Bounty you can search animal corpses killed by other people (or any other way). It doesn't have to be only ones that you've killed.
---
This should have been in game since launch.
---
You want to be some marsupial bouncing twisted muscle melee'r, you should have kangaroo legs and a backwards torso.
---
I agree but also think they just don’t want people to complete them until they bring more content out so like you said it’s a low priority for sure!
---
Nailed it!
---
I only thought of this, I said may have because I've never actually tested it, mostly because people rarely launch nukes whenever I'm on.
---
I have yet to come across one in the wild. Only encountered them during events. The ones I have encountered tho have disappointed me.
---
Is the camp indestructible in survival? Didn’t know that. Guess I can turn my vending machines on then haha
---
''havent played the game in 2 weeks, what did i miss?'' and if some answers with ''nothing'' OP responds with ''figures, i guess im not coming back to this trash, glad i left''
---
Unless it spawns under your CAMP, and slowly but surely decimate your base!
---
I had this happen with a few legendaries.  Yesterday it happened with a legendary ghoul inside of Fort Defiance.  I kept going through the area collecting what I wanted and came back to the spot later and it had turned in to a meat pile which I was then able to loot.
---
Yes if you want it on 2 Xbox’s. Though Wal-Mart has it on sale for $25 now. Second hand may be a lot cheaper.
---
Damn it. I was hoping they did since if you had like 5 friends and they were all sharing Green Thumb then you'd get enough raw flux for stable flux every time
---
Thank God I don’t use any of the others! Could be too much for my heart! xD
---
Shoutout to who ever has been leaving ammo and resources in random containers, as someone that started a week ago the stack of ammo and crafting resources that i found at one of the train stations has helped a ton.
---
Nothing. but when you get to over 250, you turn into a god.
---
Vending doesn't cost any atoms.
---
Im guessing it would be to hard to change every armors or outfit depending on mutations
---
That’s extreme wtf your weapons must’ve lost some serious health lmao
---
ODST from the Enclave.
---
Lucky you! Hope that happens to me.. not the shut down in mid but all the other stuff. What platform are you on? Haven’t meet other females...
---
I totally agree. Shields would be useful since the game is now basically Elder Scrolls. With all of the ranged weapon nerfs the only weapons that work consistently are melee. I know you can stack the cards for a specific build, but that's not Fallout. Carrying a variety of different weapons is what made the previous games fun.
---
You think the people making the game are personally sewing the bags?
---
best place for plans for gun mods is the train station next to top of the world
---
I'd like a public stash. Make it a "Lost &amp; Found" container at Whitesprings or Flatwoods that we can donate or drop things into to give to the community. Sort of like how we been using trainstation suitcases and cashier boxes for it in the age before vendors.  A clearly marked community container would be nice to help new players or just for ppl that like giving stuff away.
---
I don't have a mic so that'd be hard to organize, haha.
---
Diablo 3 completely transformed itself after release, became an almost totally different game than it was at launch - much to the better. That experience has me being patient with this game as the dev's work to get it right.
---
Leak of new nuclear winter dlc, we drop from the kovac muldon, no pod, we just fall
---
I don’t get why they can’t do a search for accounts with more than 2-3 of the same weapons acquired in less than 30 days of each exactly the same item then freeze those accounts... 
---
They also can see who is selling anything to vendors...
---
Yeah, but TSEs were everywhere *before* the purveyor was a thing, along with the complaints about nerfing them.
---
This was one of the main selling points in the buildup before release. If your neighbor bugs you, nuke them!
---
By crafting bags? LoL they are selling games, comeon
---
I was playing a ton but these last few issues that could be fixed in hotfixes have me down. This isn't I quit the game post but my playtime has certainly been dialed back.
---
I hope to be surprised today that these little deals like melee on flying insects and incompletable possum badges are addressed.
---
Thats exactly what they do, last wave removed any duplicate of everything for a lot of people, as well as issued bans
---
FO4 survival they exploded instantly.  If you heard the beep you were dead.  In 76 they are a useless joke.
---
you really can't interact with your caps, so I can't imagine how this would happen.
---
Sold the plan twice for 2500. Probably could get more, it doesn't drop often like Formula p.
---
"pacifist mode" i told you did something wrong. No reason to say u didn't.
---
Just because Drake isn't in the photo doesn't mean this isn't just a meme post. 
---
It's crazy how little actual content comes out of this sub, but given the game it's for I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
---
yeah, ive thought about this a lot
---
a custom vendor bot that behaves like a vending machine except you could add a cap pool for people to sell things to you. i can see issues arising in terms of getting useless items
---
I found it very useful, not just for trading items between characters, but also for stuff like the revive in water for the scout challenges. I run one account from the launcher and the other from the game icon.
---
I've always heard it as "More money than common sense." That way is seven syllables. "More money than brains" is five syllables. Interesting...Shit! I'm doing it again. I'm out!
---
(ps. I up-voted moments before bailing)
---
I move around a lot of items and caps, store a lot of legendaries and junk so I totally do not regret buying a second account that i run on my laptop. You can do photo challenges on your own as a bonus and you can run a store on secondary acct while server hopping on your main as much as you want. You can even take it a step further and team up with yourself to share perk cards xD Also i think it's a great way to support the game if you don't want to buy yet another stupid pink pajamas from atom store.
---
I'd be happy with 1k, or a split weight system between stash and vendor.
---
Camp size though should be increased, the additions of vendor, atom shop, etc.
---
I have 2 accounts on my main Xbox and 2 on the other and my son and daughter have accounts and play as well. So it does work. 
---
I believe the Xbox has to be in or on same network and under same owner which is me in both cases.
---
Hey happy cake day!
---
Either 30% / 30% for a balance of both commando or rifleman, or 30% / 60% if you’re thinking of using mostly snipers with a bit of commando mixed in at times. 
---
A good full Auto like a handmade or the Fixer can do just fine DPS at 30% with a powerful auto receiver. I find rifles need a bit more help on per shot damage so maxing rifleman makes more sense if you’re going to use them a lot. 
---
Really depends what you’ll use more though.
---
Buying ones people want is key...
---
Scrap everything
---
Ah, must be a bug then.
---
You guys seems like that with posts "where is my bag bethesda?" :)
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I'm not sure then. Moving the camp would probably fix it, but that's a pain.
---
Son of a...
---
Dammit. Welp, thanks for that tip! Things I never knew...
---
Well if you are on Xbox, I am happy to help you out!
---
Yep. I haven't logged in for weeks. I think this is the first time I've posted about that fact.
---
Of course I haven't sworn to never return to the game or anything, I've just got other games I'd rather play right now. And honestly I figure giving the game a break means I may return to find it *massively* improved. The last several patches seem to have taken the game in a direction I like.
---
AFAIK, you can't "complete" it, even if you collect all 17 tapes. The current theory is that her mission will continue during one of the upcoming DLCs.
---
Any good loot? Lol
---
Does scout armor have blueprint plans? If so and i get them, craft them, can i use the b.o.s. blueprint to turn them black as well or do they stay the camo color?
---
If im buying over 1000 im not paying a cap each. Ill pay a cap for 3 or 4 but its not worth it for a cap each
---
Nah, as you can see she didn’t have any items equipped!
---
Somehow I like him less after I read this interview. I don’t like the false narrative they gave this game before launch, how they’ve handled their most loyal fans purchases (Bags/Nuka Dark Rum), and now he’s telling everyone everything is going as planned. What an asshole.
---
Nail Guns (essentially a pistol version of the Railway Rifle)
---
One Handed Hammers (ever wish you could smack someone with all those Ball-peen/Claw hammers lying around?)
---
Other various sports related weapons (Lacrosse/Hockey sticks, Shuffleboard cue, Football/Basketball grenades, portable Pitching Machines)
---
Don't "owned" containers say "Steal From?"
---
I know there's a few at the Vault-Tac Agriculture building that have a similar message (no bounty, just turns the Mr Farmhands hostile).
---
Not sure if it works in workshops though.
---
Noooo.... well, I was today levels old when I found out. That’s 87.
---
That's a cute story but the 13 year difference between games is just a hole I can't ignore. Also, SWTOR launched beautifully so this "everything. Ever. Can't argue." line just seems immature to me. 
---
Fallout 76 shouldn't have been launched when it did which was just acknowledged in the main post above.
---
WoW was a complete game when it launched that contained issues that come with creating a world in which 10k players all sharing just ONE server brings.
---
Really, it's almost like people think something sounds intelligent and just upvote it without actually thinking for even a moment about what they just read.
---
The fact that I could spend all day explaining the differences between WoW and F76 and how a gaming veteran "since 96" failed to notice that seems to be the most puzzling of your post.
---
They said before launch that the mutations would have physical appearance changes. I think plague walker makes your have cracked glowing skin, when you have many diseases. But that shouldn't even really count
---
cool, ill def check it out sometime, probably on a weekend
---
White Knight and Fix it Good are your friends!
---
I learned my lesson about this the hard way, lmao. I didn't know either since there are no warnings. The good thing is that now there are bigger icons on the map when workshops are claimed, so I generally check the map first before I pick any safe.
---
eta?
---
Oh your right.. that's to get that other skin of the vendor machine right? I've never even looked into it..
---
Ill pay 1 cap for every 3 or 4 bullets. Im looking for thousands
---
My psn is MIghtymouse492. I can not add you until i get home from work but i would definitly be interested in joining. I have been looking for others to play with and o am still doing the quests since i basically just explored for the first 50 levels lol
---
Dang that sucks, glad that hasn't happened to me, tend to use wepons that only hit single target tho.
---
Speaking as someone who still thinks this game is enjoyable, that video was spot on. Internet Historian summed up the problems with the game perfectly. 
---
The fortunate thing about history though: it's in the past. The future can change, at least when you patch a game. I'm not saying 76 has become anything like what we were promised, but it's definitely improved. I hope it continues to.
---
They told us from the get go that it was going to be a WIP and that they were counting on us to help the game grow.
---
They game needed to be delayed, but I really don't imagine Bethesda sitting on all 200,000 power armor editions. Those boxes were so big it'd have cost them millions to keep them in storage for months while they fixed the game.
---
being able to sell things in stacks of 20/25/50/100 as well as price per item would help
---
 Had a 10 cap bounty fron picklocking something I thought was okay. I went back to my camp and was super dupering some flux. Guy came to the camp, one shotted me, took my junk, and then started shopping my vending machines.
---
Damn. I hate when my kills have no loot
---
I will look for you tonight! :D This sounds awesome.
---
Scrounging for crap is my jam, so a scavenger hunt would be great.
---
I'll probably be a mix of jumper and scanner.
---
Plastic.  Get all the plastic you can.
---
You use it to bulk items, which saves space in your stash.
---
Just up the crafting quantity for .308, now that .50 bmg receivers do more damage on the hunting rifles there's zero reason for .308 to cost more to craft. 
---
Does the game ever explicitly call the LMG an MG42? If it doesn't the gun could be an MG3, which does fire 7.62 NATO/.308
---
Fort defiance might be a good spot
---
All silos, kill everything and loot
---
More wasteland/throwback weapons;
---
-Rebar Clubs and Roadsign BattleAxes
---
-Dart Gun that cripples limbs and delivers a strong poison
---
-Double-sided Chainsaw Glaive constructed from a kayak paddle and two chainsaws, simple Oar weapons(Appalachia has some great white water rapids)
---
-Javelins
---
The Burrows are okay, not great. Arktos Pharma is... a tad buggy, but honestly a fun experience. It adds mechanics to the game that were lacking before and its a really well designed area.
---
Fourthed.
---
Just another drill, then...
---
If you randomly find a bottle of Nukashine in a paper bag, drink it happily.
---
Lol, I'll let it slide :P
---
The ammo cost keeps it in check.  On paper it’s the highest damage gun in game for sustained long damage bullet sponge fights.  It sucks that 308 is crafted in such small quantities, it does help if you Prime it then it crafts in 80s.  At the end of the day, not being able to feed the gun for long term farm sessions keeps it balanced IMO.

---
PS4. You? I came across a few during gameplay. Hard to tell sometimes with PSNs being so ambiguous. It's always nice to come across a fellow female wastelander.
---
Medical places.
---
Prison Cafeteria and Doctors Office (hospitals in general are good)
---
Not all broken down junk bulks. You will have to find the ones that don't and sell them individually to manage your stash inventory.
---
Noice.. I got a pic of the rare 2headed 3legged mannequin
---
They're tough to kill. I have a AA +50% vats crit +1 perception handmade and I slam their heads with criticals and it barely does anything. The same criticals would take a lvl 80 SB down in 2-3 shots lol.
---
Yeah this has happened pretty much only when spraying the auto tesla gun into a large crowd of super mutants or robots. Against single enemies I don't think it's possible
---
Ski Poles @ Top of the World
---
Should come away with like 35+ Aluminum Scrap.
---
That or build a junk extractor, tis what I finally did, seems to be the one resource I really run out of all the time (that and springs)
---
I don't want any more mini nukes!
---
Watoga was a good spot but it seems like the robots are spawning less frequently then they did. Thanks for these suggestions everybody.
---
If you're on PC, I have a spare I'd be glad to sell for the same price I bought, 300c (I snag extras when I find a deal for this very reason)
---
Personally I would just love to have an account wide stash box (completely separate from the current stash) that can hold crafting materials, ammo, and a small amount of items that could be transferred to any other character on my account.  I hate having to get a friend to help me with transferring items or trusting somebody on the Internet.
---
I'm level 123 and only saw my first one recently.
---
yongyea made a video about this and it's the most biased piece of shit i've ever seen on his channel.
---
Yup. I have a two shot one. It's so much fun to play with and the DPS is really good but I really can't keep it fed. I usually end up just stashing it until I get up to 1,000 .308 rounds in my inventory then go run a nuke zone with it.
---
Really? I scrapped one light and placed, like, 6 of the things when my budget was full. They don't seem that bad.
---
Level 65 here and I never knew that.
---
The plant one is passive so I assumed the others were as well.
---
Slaughtering mole miners, mine suit breathers scrap into it.
---
Congrats! 
---
Enjoy it while you can. Those early fights can be intense and very fun. Oh how i miss them sometimes. Eventually you get good gear and weapons, sort out your perk cards and can take things down with minimal effort. Then you'll be wishing for a challenge again.
---
What about Fallout 1 &amp; 2 haven't heard about those either
---
It should end by 4th June my guess.. all jokes aside usually they are relatively quick (4 hours I think was the longest?)
---
Thank you. That's half the reason I did this, I was decorating and said, "Nice and all, but why would anyone look at it?"
---
No penalty for doing what the game allows you to do. 
---
Stop being so pathetic.
---
Of course
---
I have some weapons you can dig through (up to 140+ berserker weapons XD)
---
I have all mutations and i would be absolutely fine with being a hideous mess in appearance 👍
---
They are not nice, they are Capitalists.
---
You only make that mistake once:)
---
The TSE laser is nice, but aim for a QE or FE.
---
\&gt;YouTubers plus other media outlets correctly called them out. 
---
\&gt; Also, I'm not saying all YouTubers are good for criticising the game, and some obviously jumped on for views 
---
Most did though.
---
They are here forever it's not temporary
---
All of mine resemble buildings in or inspired by the West Virginia area, so I appreciate well made ones too
---
The devs really did make Watoga a ghost town.
---
Outside of Monster Mash, an Enclave Event, and Mayor for a Day, there seems to be absolutely no reason to ever go there anymore.
---
Taking the bots off the legendary list completely and having the Brotherhood vendor at The Whitesprings sealed that area's fate.
---
I agree on silencer in pretty much all cases, I just silenced my Pipe BA sniper for sensibilies sake. And 4 sure love the handmade, real nice SKS/AK feel to it, The wieghts just always been problematic for me, if I found a good Wieghtless one, I'de be all over it.
---
You know players can't damage camps in adventure mode anymore, right?
---
and corn.
---
Maintenance
---
You mean Mr. Burns ordering Smithers (he's in the top right of the image kinda hard to see) releasing his hounds?
---
On PC was shopping all day no worries, zoned into a new place by the Whitesping station and went afk while I loaded in. Came back to flaming death! LOL. 
---
It was a lower levels camp, maybe lvl 26. Name wasn't Mavius something, I wrote it down to make sure I don't frequent it again. Had a bunch of weapons and armor for sale so definitely a good "Lure" setup too. Stole whatever junk I had or it disappeared? As I never got a pick up your loot quest.
---
Life is harsh in the wasteland. :)
---
Ah, when is it ending?
---
Agreed! It sucks using vats in melee and nothing happens...lol
---
Be great to play the drums at Biv’s and have it actually work as Bethesda planned...
---
I think the alternate for the "lootable" stash should be the mailbox.
---
Make it the 200 weight and allow players to have the ability to send stuff to other players on their server. However, anyone can freely loot the mailbox.
---
Apparently u/Rakesh1995
---
E Tesla guns lose their arc effects, so keep that in mind.
---
Well... it was a silo based contest on the Filthy Casual sub. My impression is that plenty of them are not advanced enough in the story for that. Also, how do you verify 1) they all faced the same amount of challenge and 2) time? Do you server hope after each run?
---
Can u please read the TOP right of your screen?
---
Im not sure why todd howard does personally monitor people’s inventory and game play and ban players breaking the rules
---
Down for maintenace. Was getting same thing. Stupid moderators kept flagging my post. They aren't banning anyone. No one plays this this anymore
---
Nobody knows, it’s like this every Monday.
---
Thanks everyone! Glad to see that the burrows work... bit disappointed that it’s so easy to beat and not as cool as I expected a dungeon to be...
---
Server closing for maintenance -- the true end-game boss.
---
Cool! Didn’t read that. You’d think they would post about it and let players all know if you do this or even buy from them you risk losing it all.
---
Best you can do is check out the different vendor sold plans i think. I don't know of any master list outside of that.
---
Dunno what you mean about the mole lady. She fkn hates me, 3 x 3star shovels so far 😐. Grahms ok tho
---
Ye that's my scientific hurdle aswell.
---
You need it.
---
You need PS plus as far as I know.
---
Gives me the new emote in AS
---
\&gt;Also, SWTOR launched beautifully so this "everything. Ever. Can't argue." line just seems immature to me.
---
No, it didn't. There's a reason why it was called "Tor-tanic" and still has that moniker and a dwindling playerbase today. I've played the game since the early access beta in december of 2011 and even i know that it was fucked from the start with many of the same criticisms for 76 applying to it.
---
Gotta love the guys that post its trash just because it isn't explosive.  That's a decent weapon, I would put it in my machine for 1750ish but could see it going for 2500 to 3k if you wanted to sit on it for a little bit till you get that seller.  I hate doing this though cause stash space is limited, I want things to move in under a day if possible.
---
Some people prefer looking human tho (I'm not one of them )
---
I feel like “I fucked your mother” is too overdone now.
---
Workshops. Just use extractors.
---
The game will need a rebranding and a relaunch (similar to how Final Fantasy 14 or ESO: Tamriel Online). I could see 76 becoming Fallout: Appalachia, and including all the DLC and updates in a retooled base game.
---
Leave vault.
---
Explore world.
---
Suffer and enjoy.
---
Thanks...
---
Well...dammit.
---
I server hopped the ice cream stand for five hours with my husband on separate servers (we randomized together just once), and only got the bot to spawn five times - three for me, two for him. Yes, we waited for the spawn lag to pass each time.
---
I don’t know whether to be excited or annoyed at your news. Hope it doesn’t take long to find him again.
---
It took me 7 hours to determine that I was going to play the game today and what happens when I reach that conclusion? Maintenance. I tell you what...&lt;mutters something incomprehensible while meandering towards the liquor bar&gt;.
---
It’s an online game, of course you need psplus
---
Stop it now (and take all my upvotes)!
---
I just got the high capacity mod and intend to try the grounded mutation to offset the loss of ER.
---
&gt;  fasnacth parade event?
---
For all of the events but Fasnacht you have as long as you need/want.
---
Fasnacht parade however, was for a set duration, but the community liked it so well that Bethesda said it will be coming back
---
Honestly, I get location-blocked very rarely now. When vending first came out, it was maybe 1/3rd of the time, now it's uncommon enough to be below 1/10th.
---
if a bug doesn't benefit the player in some way, they aren't going to do jack about it.  that's the BGS bug policy.
---
The plan is called "Light Machinegun MG42"
---
Please remove any and all conflict with other players so i can play my way uninterrupted by other people in this massive multiplayer game!
---
Y'know, I DO have a bunch of Halloween Candy in my pocket... hmmmm...
---
Awesome thanks for the info
---
I went to trade with a person and noticed a stack of certain weapons (5)... I backed out and left... sorry but only one type of player has a stack of 5 identical much wanted weapons... duper’s or players that sell for the duper’s.
---
Also PS4. That’s true, the few I’ve come across in Appalachia were in all male teams. I was going to make a group recruit/join request one of these days I’d be more than happy to try it out. You game? :D
---
Fifthed
---
Yea well I cant change the title now.. maybe I shouldn't have said nice
---
That one annoys the hell out of me, I almost wasn't able to put a roof on my camp because of it, while Timmy Turrets can go and build his giant platform supported by 1 set of stairs.
---
Most "build" perks aren't available until higher levels.  Get the quality of life perks at low levels.  The find extra chems and ammo type perks.
---
Fireproof says 60% but in reality it is basically fireproof and explosions won't hurt you.
---
"And you have to activate it like the aid/ammo/cans perk cards!"
---
I had my serums at 200, because I just wanted some quick caps, expecting them to sell straight away to people flipping them to vendors and it’s taken a few days to sell like 10, crazy!
---
I've always had a fondness for the knives, the "unholster" animation is just badass,  and you can deliver some seriouse dps with a good one. Have a +1 Str, +40% pwr attk dmg, executioners cultists dagger and it's mean as f***.
---
Skyrim was like that too. Hell, i think it's still like that some times.
---
lol, was late and I didn't notice, but I think it'll remain
---
Yeah I know that, I’m just thinking all plans even the ones you can’t buy and you have to get from events. I guess it is a cool surprise getting a plan from an event I didn’t know existed! When I scroll through vendors it’s just a surprise when they have a plan I haven’t already learned. I know the recipes have an atom achievement for knowing 76 of them, but are there only 76 consumables (minus Biv and a few new ones added) that’s what I mean :)
---
The region around Gaulley Mine (near the Lighthouse, across the river) has some. Then follow the train tracks up north. There are more around the tracks and river when they make a turn right, before the bridge.  
---
Another place where I had some success is west of Vault 76, where the maps shows some mountain peaks near a road.
---
Possible Fiber Optics for crafting Orbital Strike Beacons.
---
I won't go there purposely, but if I'm passing through Watoga while collecting Fiber Optics, I'll hit the Assaultrons too as they can drop Biometric Scanners as well as Aluminum.
---
It seems many try to keep it really low.
---
I asked if anyone got the promised atoms in late December and also got downvoted from it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a85fgz/anyone_get_their_500_atoms_from_bag_replacement/
---
Probably both. They are taking servers down in their office time and probably most of their playerbase are US based. Sucks to be EU player.
---
I always resort to melee. Just mainline Stimpaks and slap the crap outta them with a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Even hopping up on a roof does no good because without being stealthed my sniper rifle doesn't do enough damage and they can still spit at you, nevermind rattle hands.
---
I'm online a bit as well Justin Yermum I gotta warn you I afk randomly especially wile cooking dinner or cleaning the house.
---
I edited it.. cant change the title
---
Play it how you want to play it... build character that you find "fun", and do whatever you wish to do.
---
The world has enough "max damage/max cap" builds.
---
Good idea +1
---
With this bethesda will never advertise any other material lol, hey guys get the "misterious material"-book case with preorders!
---
It's so useful. Go heavy gun, melee, stealth rifle and be a master crafter on top of it all. Having all the cards in gunsmith, demolition, makeshift warrior, and weight related/crafting perks is nice.
---
I'd like camps to be able to be transformed into a settlement, which is just a bigger camp that two people own
---
Nice, same here  - ”house rules” for characters keep games like these fresh.
---
I’ve really enjoyed my INT 1, no power armor run. What kind of house rules do you enjoy?
---
Oddly enough I fell through the world for the first time since launch just yesterday.   Traveled to a player's camp and became stuck on something.   Next thing you know I fell through the map.  I dropped for maybe 3 seconds and then popped right back on firm ground at the players camp.
---
\&gt;that most hate probably came from the fact that they released a copy/paste from a 2015 game,
---
It really isn't outside of the engine. and if that's the case then New Vegas should still be getting shit for being on the same engine.
---
The whole idea of perpetually launching nukes being the endgame content and therefore a desirable thing to do is stupid as hell.
---
So... the benefit is only... everything that matters.
---
What kind of male would name themselves beautiful kitten? Wait...don't answer that!
---
Get a map of resource nodes, and move your camp there for a while. Set up an extractor and soon you will have more than you can deal with. I did it for acid. I did not pay attention, and soon I had over 700 acid to deal with.
---
I did it to try and supplement my income, I can sell 3 to vendors per day but that’s only 1400 a day, so thought I’d get an extra couple of k from them but they took a lot longer to sell than I thought. 
---
Personally if I was low on caps and didn’t already have a load of serums and I saw someone selling them for 200 I’d buy them all and flip them
---
Well, they don’t stack with themselves, just each other. So you can hit a bleedout and then a radscorpion and do 7hp/sec in poison damage. On a bloodied build that may only have 50-70hp, that’s enough to kill them if they don’t stim!
---
It was a great game that like all games, suffered from a large loss of population after it's third year. Many games just can't continue to be as entertaining once endgame content is completed and that's not a unique issue. 
---
Comparing the launch of F76 to WoW or SWTOR is as intelligent as comparing your apple harvest with your potato harvest.
---
This was the first time I ever glitched to the top, I think I only fell through once or twice, also by fast travelling to a camp
---
Ogrsrevenge was one of those players kind enough to notice a lvl 200 player gank my work bench in the junkyard, and bought everything in my vendor (wasn’t much I’m only lvl 25) and provide me with tons of ammo and weapons to show not all high lvl players are bad. Here’s to her!
---
I could see that being similar to the junk "Component View" screen now. List all the item options and let you mark certain ones as purchaseable/requested with how many caps you're willing to spend on them. Effectively like a passive trade window.
---
That would break down on legendaries, but would still work well for consumables.
---
I like this
---
I'd be fine with simple skin changes
---
Sure thing! PSN: Bellamicina. Most the time I play before work to get my caps for the day, but when I have more time on my days off (like today), doing something like this would be tons of fun!
---
Fr I want my games hahahah
---
Not just that, we need a basic overhaul to the perk cards that let you take a pet for your camp so we can choose to make them companions. Plus add dogs. That would be nice.
---
What was the update?
---
Oooohh, so you were just making a point to why it would be pointless to have, whoops that flew over my head.
---
Well... Thank you all.... It was really interesting ....
---
My ticket says "last updated 1 month ago" but most recent response is this.

&gt;We have now applied the 500 complimentary ATOMS to your Fallout 76 account for you to enjoy. Please bear with us while we manufacture and deliver the Power Armor Edition Canvas Bag replacements.

&gt;Once the canvas bag replacements are manufactured and ready for distribution, you will receive another confirmation email.

&gt;Thank you for your continued patience.

&gt;Bethesda Support
---
So even their support is still buggy (can never forget when they gave random users support agent status).
---
At least it's still "Investigation Ongoing" so they haven't actually admitted to giving up yet.
---
I hate that the first part of your posts body has to try to combat the obvious correction posts people feel the need to post.
---
"I have a big balloon"
---
"Actually it’s a big red balloon... filthy casual"
---
I’d like to think we’ll have more friendlies in the coming dlc’s. As it is, I think the focus has been on establishing a functional core game. The next dlc’s will be bolting on more functionality like npc’s etc.
---
You know I'm not sure. I asked something similar about a week ago and everyone says it works great. I only ever see it proc once per server but maybe its a coincidence?
---
Remember your turrets will automatically attack anyone and they can then destroy your camp
---
thx
---
Awesome :) I’ll add you one of these days.
---
Plenty of people on that sub launch nukes. I guess no one wanted to do it competitvely is all. we were going to have a judge come to the player and watch them go into the silo and start the timer when they got out of the elevator and stop it when their name was on the screen "so and so has launched a nuke".  If only they got disconnected, it would have been a loss because I cant verify that they actually got discoed and didn't log out. But if the server crashed they'd get a do-over. Luck of the draw I guess
---
Fort Defiance has every MAT you need.  It takes an half an hour to gather every scrap in that place. For Aluminum, when you go through the Brotherhood door on the right there is an opening to a small kitchen.  All of the TV trays and a few of the pots are aluminum.  There are also TV trays and cans spread across the place.  I bulk the METS on the third floor and if I remember right there is about 4 bulk aluminum in the place.  You should also look at the high schools, they also have the TV trays in the lunch rooms.
---
Awwwwww
---
Back end work. No notes.
---
Hi everyone,
---
We’re planning to bring Fallout 76 offline across all platforms around 11:00 a.m. EDT on Monday, June 3, in order to implement some backend service updates. We are not making any gameplay changes, so there will be no patch notes following this downtime.
---
Or even a character appearance option after you have the mutation
---
All of them are.
---
Level 70 - Subject1138
---
No idea honestly, your guess is as good as mine here :) as long as it’s getting more stable I have 0 complaints though :)
---
Now that I’m a cannibal, I unload the majority of my cooked food at vendors. Less drag, mocaps.
---
Me too. I just asked the same question last month also  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bp66lu/helloi_would_like_to_know_if_any_one_got_thier/
---
Fort Defiance, there are place settings up on the 4th floor and other items through out the giant building area(s).
---
Top of the world, where Rose is has plastic plates all over.
---
Bolton Greens has golf balls and other plastic items strewn around like life preservers in the pool area. Its also close to the cat lady's house others have mentioned.
---
Sorry for the delayed response, need some "me" time! :)   
---
* Added and Submitted  
---
* When did this happen? 9.5 was supposed to have a fix for that....    
---
* I think a quirk, have used the power grid, let me know if you see it again.   
---
* This "I think" is a server lag issue, I've seen it as well, logging out and back in usually fixed it.    Can also be related to a close to max Stash space, and no error given. Submitting.   
---
* This is less a bug, more a limitation IMHO, it will allow you to add the same item more than once, at different or the same prices, and with things like grenades it could be a limitation in the Stash, let me know if you see otherwise   
---
* Blocky Orange Glow is to help you identify the items for the quest, but grab some screenshots, lets see if it's weird for you.   
---
* Known issue, it is effecting a bunch of quests, but especially Uranium Fever.   
---
* Can you get me a screenshot of the area / items you can't land on?
---
I'm positive that it's just delayed damage from a previous attack due to server lag. It only ever happens sometime after I've gotten attacked by something. I've had days where I spent all day doing 'chores' and ever got attacked by anything and the random damage doesn't happen. I've also seen where I've gotten melee attacked and took no damage. Then a few seconds/minutes later have that grunt and random damage. I've also gotten a disease from those delayed attacks as well. This happened to me with Rad Worms from a WS ghoul. Got hit, didn't take damage, few minutes later get the random damage. Boom rad worms.
---
The same thing happened to me and I just used robotics expert on him.
---
What we need is a special stash that we can access from all characters.  200 seems like a good number. 
---
Oh you found a cool explosive rifle while on your pistol character.  No need to bug your friend to trade items off to your other character.  Just simply put it in your global special stash and pick it up the next time you log on your other character.
---
I doubt the stash size will get another increase for a while. It's probably really taxing on the servers as it is, so I can't imagine Bethesda fixing it.
---
Make sure you try some Nukashine.
---
Correct you are, and a lesson was learned.
---
I just started too am level 9 psn- psv_WALEED
---
The medical trays all over Fort Defiance.
---
As a pacifist PVE player, I \*used\* to get jumped all the time by people trying to force me into PVP using slap damage and exploits, or wrecking my camp. But since the changes to Pacifist mode, "griefing and dick behavior" are now mostly absent if you play in Adventure mode.
---
However, not all the murderhobos have gone to Survival. If you take a workshop and hang out there to build anything, most likely someone higher level will come by before too long and gank you.
---
Or how about a small gang of player raiders, which all spawn in together, and their aim is to raid peoples camps and ambush other players. Keep them limited to 5/6 in a group, but as OP states, without any of the perks a regular player would enjoy. 
---
I think this would be good, as it would unite the players of the world to help each other defend against these attacks. 
---
Could also utilise the flare gun to put out an alert for other players, to say you’ve located them or need help defending against them.
---
if you played in..whatever month it was, they should have been automatically added to the beth launcher. Mine were, and the peeps I 76 with got thiers too. Maybe poke support if it didnt happen ?
---
* Ok I understand the top picture, but mind explaining the others?  
---
* The spoilage rate seems random as hell, but might have gotten better in 9.5, as I've noticed this as well..  
---
But every time you FT and log in / out a check is made on the food.
---
All the time or just sometimes?
---
Same, I have 67 to use. Hopefully we keep them with the legendary reset. No idea what to use them on at the moment otherwise
---
Yea me too.. haha but got to or I'll get 1000 people who want to downvote and point out ever small technical thing I say.. and I'm not even talking about adding as a major thing.. just another random spawn location like the brahman with the quill in em.. alittle lore, flush out the world alittle.. dont effect nothing
---
There is the non-hostile Injured Supermutant too.
---
Yeah, but isn't it weird we can't manufacture it? I mean, if we could hack into a military nuclear launch base,and join a secret shadow government armed with advanced tech, why can't we spread it around? Mass produce it with MODUS' help, and try spreading it through the air using the cargobots?
---
Person who downvoted you here.
---
I’m not a bot but I care enough to call bullshit on your not caring. Clearly you felt the need to comment on OPs post. Here’s some numbered points:
---
1. You sounds like a miserable cunt. 
---
2. That’s pretty much it. Stay salty. 
---
You have a semi-good day.
---
(Idk maybe step in dog shit or something mildly inconveniencing)
---
Thanks man.There is always Fallout76 market where to buy more. I use Bloodied Combat Rifle also its almost as good as Handmade,almost.
---
Brilliant
---
Disappears as in that spot in the wheel is empty?   
---
As for the ammo, it's weird, some specific weapons are effected more than others...  
---
My Combat Rifle is never effected, but Laser, Harpoon is 100% effected.
---
I prefer fat kid on a cupcake, but yea. You’re very right.’you can almost always find someone shitting on the game for no good reason other than to be a useless prick
---
Awesome:) I just sent a friends request
---
I HATE it when asshats from survival hang out in adventure. You know them when you see them. 
---
And god are they tedious. Jumping around and shooting me with explosive shit, at the train station, following me around and trying to get me to turn pacifist off. NOPE. Not going to happen. Sorry. I got shit to do. And it doesn't involve fucking around with the likes of you, you bore me, pvp is broken and I'm not going to engage
---
You do know that nobody came to help you but rather to gain some quick xp and a chance of good legendary drop, right?
---
Marsupial is definitely the most popular.  
---
My second one was Speed Daemon, largely because my character has both mutations and I wanted to  be able to get them back if I ever lost them.  
---
I’ve since gotten Adrenal Reaction, Twisted Muscles, and Chameleon. 
---
The hardest part is getting your first recipe.  After that, it gets much easier as the income from the first supports buying your second.  
---
If you have low Charisma (mine is level 3), make sure to use Grape Mentats (+5 Charisma), Pickaxe Pilsner (or another beer, +1 Charisma), the Barter perk card maxed out, a Charisma Bobblehead (if you have it), and a piece of armor that gives you + to Charisma (equip it prior to trading). 
---
The max is 15 and that’s what you need with the buffs to get the best prices.  
---
Also, make sure to max out on your 1400 caps for the day prior to buying the serum recipe.  After you buy the recipe, you’ll be able to sell another  1400 caps worth as the vendor will refill their caps.  If you have the flux, you’ll be able to make a few serums to turn around and sell back to the vendor.  
---
I find that if I go in with 21K caps and still have the 1400 cap limit, I come out with about 5K.  Since the max cap limit is 25K, my trigger to buy a new recipe is 21K.  
---
21K + 1.4K (daily cap limit) - 18.4K (recipe) + 1.4K (vendor refill due to sale) = 5.4K.  
---
While it’s expensive, you won’t end up being broke if you use the strategy above.
---
I miss the crucified ghouls from the beta
---
Yea but he got shell shock.. just watched his boys get ripped to pieces.. give em a few days he will be back to his normal kill all humans self
---
If I wasnt so poor.. lol
---
Downvoting a post I believe is clutter is not "screwing him over"
---
It's fake internet points. At the end of the day everyone is okay.
---
Won't work... user base per world is too small for a meaningful review system. 
---
With such a small # of players per world... it's too easy to get ratings that are meaningless.
---
I want to look like a god damn teenage mutant ninja fucking turtle up in this bitch.
---
Lol. Most definitely. But makes a better story telling it that way
---
Or the opposite, they run up to trade like you have special weapons you only get after level 100+ 😅
---
I feel like it is coming in the wastelanders dlc in autumn/fall, in the promo stuff for it it shows vault boy with a little robot, this could mean nothing
---
Recently the perveyor handed me a  bloodied explosive light machine gun 3 star ap something or other level 50. Shoots fireworks zip zip zip but the ammo vanished. **LMG users need a semi-auto mod plan.**
---
I have both, but the Rad Damage was horrendous, and even Radshield wasn't helping that much.
---
From now on, I will stick to Ribeye and Rad Ant lager when I need a travel boost.
---
If posts get too many downvotes early on can be prevent posts from being seen or having a chance to rise, so... yeah, it is screwing him over. This has nothing to do with "fake internet points" but suppressing people's posts because you're too damn lazy to hit the "hide" button.
---
Ive been offloading my legendaries in the blue briefcase daily. Hoping someone could find a use for em.
---
I LOVE IT. I'd pay 20,000 caps for BLACK WOLF FEDORA
---
I think we're talking about different things. I'm talking about CAMPS that appear to be on the map, but when you click on them you can't FT at all because they don't actually exist. 
---
A CAMP that is glitched underground you would at least FT to where they are on the map. Even if you "land" above them on the ground.
---
I made my AAE Handmade Auto and my AA Vats Crit Combat Rifle I kept semi auto.  So I just swap my perk cards from rifle to commando and vice versa depending on ammo or situations.  Rest of the build stays the same.
---
I had one guy trying to sell me his level 15 pipe gun for 450 caps and mini nukes for like 55. I bought some mini nukes and dropped them, figured he needed caps because we were at a train station haha
---
I wish someone had the time to write a real, comprehensive guide that could be stickied on the forum. Been playing since beta, still miss stuff and don’t fully understand most things.
---
If you die it should fix itself.
---
I've been buying up ALL the plans from the WS vendors lately. One day I will have bought everything. Then what will I buy? What will I spend my caps on then? Buying stuff from vendors and leaving it laying around I guess
---
Support
---
With the legendary scrip machine I don't do it as much, but i used to love tracking down sub level 20 people in Flatwoods and gifting weapons.  I refused to use a mic, up until 2 weeks ago, mainly because, I assumed, it was going to be screaming 14 year olds on there.  Not the case so far, but I did find it fascinating to try and do rudimentary  communication with just emotes and motions.  i would put down the paper bag then I would walk up to it and crouch then stand up and back away a couple of feet.  Do it a few times and probably had a good percentage rate of people would figure out I was leaving them a gift.   They'd jump up and down or emote the thumbs up and I'd nope outta there.  Felt good every time.
---
Yeah the atom store thing is just a collection of skins, the normal vendor is in your build menu. It's worth looking in to even if you've no interest in trading as it's at least a good way to get rid of unwanted ammo and scrap, maybe plans but most people put all the same ones on there.
---
A few builds.
---
My "ghoul" build: https://old.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/comments/buu5gq/latest_character_idea_working_well_so_far_ghoul/
---
My "Mad Doc": high tech stuff only, even if using the "high tech" mod for a weapon or armour is "Sub-optimal".  All points into INT and CHA,  for team medic skills. Ignore all low tech weapons and armour altogether.
---
My "IRL" survivalist: One rifle, one sidearm, an axe, a knife... that's it for weapons. Armour must be leather, and visible (no outfits, just underarmour_ Vending is restricted to "woodsman" type items and materials. Super mobile tent based camp.
---
I also play on Xbox one, always in solo
---
I’d be one ugly SOB with all my mutations
---
Your probably pacifying them not taming them theres 2 diffrent button ques.
---
Bruh 😂
---
Yeah I can pacify but how do I tame them?
---
At least you can carry your copies of Bannerlord and Half Life 3 around in it when you do get it though.
---
Absolutely 👍
---
Any tips on camp like location
---
For some reason I have never juiced a melon. I think cuz i eat them right away... gonna be juicing some melons asap
---
Guess that depends.  Making said friends, then waiting on said friends to help you do what you need done, takes time.  Time is very valuable to me, so the question would be whether the value of the time it would take to make those friends and the time waiting for those people each time I needed help would be less than the 20-30 bucks it would be to buy another copy and save all that time now and in the future.
---
I got a plan to make them (ps4). I'd sell them for about 1k or less tbh.
---
Try this. Should have what you need.

Great clip!   
---
This has been an issue since around patch 8, and seems to effect Tesla's more than other weapons for some reasons, the enemies are not Invuln, if you switch to melee you can kill them, but the engine has registered "too much damage" and throttled your ranged weapon DMG.   
---
Adding the notes back to the Global notes.
---
Had a similar experience, but with Overwatch. Granted, I know it's not Bethesda or Fallout so it's not even remotely gonna be the same but... After nonstop 76 for a while with the Marsupial mutation, different hitboxes and mechanics, going in and playing Overwatch was really difficult. Even with a character who also uses a lever action.
---
On the Fallout front tho, recently installed New Vegas (4 was my gateway, haven't played anything earlier than that). And uh. Boy howdy, it's been interesting.
---
I like this game, but there is still so much work to be done to even bring it up to par with the standards I'd expect of an AAA game. Even a year delay for this game may have not been enough, since a little more than half-way to that point now.

There are still so many bugs and probably always will be, content is getting better, but there still needs to be a lot more activities for player retention.  Even the graphics of this game look WIP. Certain areas look fine in still images, but everything in motion just looks so weird. 76's lighting is very experimental, and regularly do things like light rays shine through mountains, interiors without light sometimes have invisible light sources that brighten and color areas mysteriously, and ambient occlusion is incredibly rough compared to the way it was in Fallout 4. It just does not have the same visual polish as Fallout 4, and it simultaneously manages to look better, and worse at different angles.  Performance is all over the place because of it.
---
Again, I like 76, but you're right, I don't support Bethesda's business practices and flops. I am still upset I got this game for $60 and it had a price cut not too long after.  There are no apologies, or special messages for people like me who supported it from the ugly beginning and never will be, but I will certainly remember. I always will.
---
So disappointing when they didn't. Still, that damage dropoff was SEVERE.
---
just making laps through watoga and killing bots is pretty easy. It should net you a decent amount.
---
How do you get fixer plans
---
F, They better not pull more shit like that in the future

If I'm on and you need help, I'll come to your aid.

Broken previously and now can't be repaired..... What patch was that in?
---
Super, I just sent a friends request :)
---
Yeah, they had charm.
---
I hope Halloween has an event with a bunch of T-posing gliding scorched. That'd be hilarious.
---
I just find people and give it away or I'll go wherever there is an overseers cashe and leave it in the stash..
---
For violet and some others prime fissure can easily get 200+ raw violet with green thumb
---
Up voting because this deserves to be seen.
---
and
---
u/MrGryphian and his like are a bunch of self righteous cunts.
---
But forgive them, their real life must be shit. Its the only reason they would come on here and act like this.
---
Your spelling and grammar are incoherent.
---
Sorry for the delayed response, need some "me" time! :)  
---
Ok what patch did you get the quest in?
---
You have to download them from Bethesda, it's pretty quick &amp; simple.
---
Capture workshops and do the defend events associated with them.  This nets you caps, meds, plans, exp, and items.
---
I miss being able to run turrets without a generator
---
They upgraded from mice with the tracking ball to lasers.
---
I agree, the vote system is a sorting system and I treated it as such. I found this post to be clutter and don't care about the bags. I only care about playing the game.
---
Maybe the other folks who percieved my calm and honest reply as "raged" and "miserable" could use a lesson on how Reddit works. I don't care about downvotes but the personal attacks are really really odd.
---
Overall though, I believe a majority of people *do* vote in a reasonable fashion.
---
T-posing to assert dominance
---
I've collected them all except violet one in Whitesprings. Fluorescent is easy there from Rhododendrons. Crimson maybe cranberries in the bog.
---
Yeah, human, robot, synth, mirelurk, the kind of NPCs we have doesn't matter to me in the least. 
---
It would be cool to have people options when talking to npcs, and them not just being vendors, though.
---
Aw don't remind me of Bannerlord
---
No worries, not sure on the number but it was the patch before the quest was added properly as far as i remember
---
They said that they were just stats in the documentary

Thanks for posting and  Sorry for the delayed response, need some "me" time! :)

* Known Issue, started happening around patch 6, but critical known.   
---
* Could you be specific about which questions?  
---
* Known issue, last patch had translation file issues.   
---
* Can you get me a video?  
---
* Could you get me a picture of the location?
---
* Don't get too attached to anything. Scrap what you don't need (there's always more somewhere), sell what you can (all vendors share a 1400 cap pool), and explore *everything*. 
---
* Check every terminal, note, and holotape you find, as you never know what information it'll have and how useful it might be. 
---
* Keep an eye on your MISC. tab for any build up of ore or gunpowder that may be causing you to become over-encumbered.
---
* Don't get too caught up in player *max-damage-1-hit-kill* builds. Just have fun with what feels right!  
---
* Don't be afraid to ask players for help in game!
---
Level 50 basic backpack is +60 carry weight. Hi-cap is +120 carry, but -60(50?) energy/rad resist. 
---
All the rest are +30 carry, but other bonuses (armored is like 90 DR, IIRC)
---
*has all of them*
---
/r/whoosh
---
Upgrade your perception
---
The old school mg42 actually used an 7.92 x 57 Mauser round. 
---
When Germany entered NATO the round was changed to 7.62 which is also known as .308 rounds. 
---
It’s pretty legit. No offense intended buddy
---
Came back in Patch 8, added it back to the Global section.
---
A full set of Marine armor would help.
---
Couldn't you place the stash box, place the items inside and then remove it to make it so no one can steal from it.
---
 Great idea btw.
---
I'd rather a separate stash of 200 that is account wide so I can xfer stuff without annoying my friends or risking it deleted by server.
---
When you exit after exploring the vault, do whatever you want. The diamond dot on your compass is a quest marker. If you're like me, play the first character and get a feel for what works and doesn't. Start your main after and study the perks, decide which ones to take at certain levels so when you're 50 you have a build. You'll find a lot of your early picks on paper don't pan out, you can change that later. A lot of the pre-made builds on the net are made by snuffaluffagus anyways, the qol perks aren't discussed much but make a big difference in the speed you get things done. And like victor said scrap everything
---
There will be a stopping point. You can't have more cards than their max allows. You can only have 6 Parma Farma cards at max. All other cards earned in packs will simply be deleted. Cards can't be picked after leveling if you have the max allowed.
---
That is weird, question, AtomShop item?
---
It would get too glitchy and cause loads of bugs, also having the same wireframe for each player means that there isnt unique frames to load into the world, this means less strain on servers and on peoples internet speed, to be honest having people will scaly skin or being a little taller for the marsupial mutation for example would make the game very slow even for people will huge gaming rigs.
---
I didn’t either but I sent a email and they gave me the 500atome
---
A shotgunner will disable a squatch in 2 to 3 shots, easy. Then it is all just wearing him down.
---
Spam is good, I'll keep pestering :)
---
I had said I hit the hide button. Your reply makes no sense to me. Are you implying I should work harder at being on Reddit? To what end?
---
They can only be *bought* [at random], and that’s from the production wing in the enclave. They can only be upgraded with mods sold in the military wing, which also may or may not be sold on that server, and may or may not work on your armor.
---
You won't need to after awhile. I'm sitting on 38 or so unused perk points at the moment.
---
You screen shot and send a ticket in?
---
It works for me pretty regularly (Rank3). I dont know if I just have good luck or what. BF also had the perk for a while and swore it just never proc'd for him and even suggested I not use it. He seemed surprised when I said it triggers fairly often.
---
Judging from  his experience, you're not completely alone at least.
---
What amazed me is that I posted the same thing as this last month.

I didn’t receive mine so I sent them an email and I received my 500 atoms.

I'm right across from Overseers camp. Its central for my vendor. Also it has everything to make healing salve.

Hahahahahahaha so you didn't read what i wrote interly? Nah you didn't, i said don't talk about my grammer because don't expect everyone can write 100% english correctly. But well i saw this one comming 😂❤
---
Thank you very much, I will do so today, I appreciate the information immensely.
---
It's still a work in progress, but I'm making a secret passage in my camp that leads to a third floor bar. The most challenging part is getting people to notice it. Even though my camp's normal stairs go straight from the second floor to the fourth floor roof and the secret stairs are clearly visible from the outside of the building, I still had to add a cardboard standup that points directly to the secret entrance and add "BAR" on his arm in small letters to get people to notice. But there's a certain sense of pride when people do find it!
---
What platform? (PC, Xbox, PS)
---
3 points in Enforcer, plus a shotgun. Guaranteed cripple, and doing both legs make him lay down and stop fighting while you wear the health away. 
---
legendary regen puts him on his feet, just drop him again. I find with any multi-star legendary letting them regen for each star seems to help the drop quality. So this is a great way to do it.

Well, I don't know of anyone who has killed the queen solo.

Depends on what you care more about. Are you looking for a spot with good resources? A spot with a nice view? An aesthetically pleasing spot? Some areas will have a mix of all three, some are more heavily one or the other. My advice is to move around a lot until you find what you like. Walking through Appalachia instead of Fast Traveling everywhere will help you find good spots.

You seem like the kind of person who uses  the raider icon in game

Quick, somebody call Make A Wish!

Considering that I order two figurines in November, was said to come first of year, but got delayed and finally received them in April, I expect probably a 6 month delay. So maybe around Xmas, haha.
---
I think that having NPC quest givers and storytellers helps add to game immersion.  Really nothing more than that.  The only gripe I have in regards to npc's is having to listen to holotapes and read terminals for almost every quest.  
---
Right now the game is just missing the human drama aspect.
---
You got an animal friend card at level 2???
---
It must be a full post. You really need to insult the people who still likethe game on the way out too.
---
 I never power attack. Its the pure speed that makes them so deadly. A lot of stuff, Muties etc, do not get a chance to do anything. 
---
 I have a Meat Hook that can be around 350 a hit, but it does not compare to my knives. I traded in a 3* AA Shiskabab to Murmrgh as it was nowhere near my knives.
---
So you only use one type of weapon at a time? I use three for mine for now. I jump around between all three. Melee, rifle and shotgun. I’m not into making my character too powerful. I like rounded. It makes it more of a challenge. Maybe try only punching weapons? THAT could be interesting.
---
Hey now, canvas is a material in limited supply. It's not like there are factories in China that could've turned out thousands of bags in a week or something; this is _Bethesda_ we're talking about here. They're committed to quality.
---
I already have most of the plans in whitespring, and i'm still walking around with a lot of money most of the time, so seems like a nice idea imo. :D
---
A bigger storage?
---
I’d like bigger storage, especially with the player vendors. But, stash space has been increased more than once. I’m not sure why the stash space needs to be so low with so many vendors in game and so much content already.
---
A storage / Inventory weight indicator for each catogory?
---
I guess this would be ok.
---
A seperate storage for the shop?
---
This may be the solution to first question
---
A Perkcard save/load preset options?
---
It’s been recommended so many times. 
---
A Coloring option to PA and Outfits other then just the skins?
---
A Coloring option for base parts?
---
They aren’t going to do this, they charge 8-14 USD per skin right now.
---
Upper the vendor cash?
---
Not necessary
---
Rentable Storage at vendor / faction bunker?
---
Rentable offline store space at vendor / faction bunker?
---
We have to pay for more storage? Totally against this.
---
Advanced economic system for stores based on global demand and sales?
---
Very vague
---
More mutations?
---
We have a tone already
---
Character visual sign of current mutations?
---
I have like 10, what would I look like?
---
I left some 500 glass shards and copper at a station, when I get too much junk I pull an Oprah and start giving it away.

He also could have climbed the pole and used his weight to snap it off at the bottom. Then he would have had a nice big pipe to fuck up his torturer.

---
Dude, they didnt work on this game before it came out. Are people really in here making suggestions for enhancements?  Let it die
---
Visiting player vendors eventually pays off. I’ve bought lots of mutation serums reasonably priced for 300-500 caps from players - you just have to keep searching, or try the 76 trade chat on reddit - plus I really enjoy checking out other player’s CAMP builds... player vending is the biggest boost to social aspect of game so far! I’m level 88 &amp; permanently overencumbered so I never fast travel.... So I especially I love planning my cross-country hikes with plenty of player CAMP detours.  For caps - always bulk your overstocked mats and vendorbot them - sell cooked food first, you’ll always have more than you need  - even unscrapped  junk laying nearby vendors - scrapper / ammosmith / chemist perks great for maxing crafting efficiencies -
---
I bet the loot was lackluster at best.
---
You on Xbox? I’ll grab them for that price if you are... throw in formula p for 100 caps?
---
Would be neat, but they'd have to make camps load in instantly. I currently troll some folk, especially my friends, when they have locked rooms and say I can't get into it...so I log out, relog in, jump into the room before it loads and boom. I'm in.
---
Fort defiance.  Hands down.  A full clear is usually just under 7 stacks if you grab every single tray/can.  Just make sure you know your way around there, there are a couple of sections everyone misses because of the way the walls have collapsed.  It should also be noted you get 45caps for the straight jackets at a robot vendor.  There are I believe 22 straight jackets in there you can get a day.  You can do the math ;)

Yeah I have an Primed Explosive Executioners for finishing off SBQ pretty damb fun, high chance of becoming bullet drunk.
---
Red rocket sign is bugged, same with the red stove and the skulls on spikes (These I know for sure, there might be others) are all able to be placed in other peoples camps.
---
Or they can keep it simple and give us a cross character stash for transferring items around. It would take a lot to fill up 5 characters. Then at that point they can just let us have more character slots.
---
Hahahah no kidding. I’m level 143~ and a level 22 the other day wouldn’t leave me alone because he “really needed” my TSE handmade. Friend requests messages spamming trade request. Like dude I need it too. That’s why I’m carrying it...
---
PC. They sell out fast at my vendor. I have 4 formula P left but sell them at 1k
---
Try to avoid the "Grow" option.  It usually works better if you select the pieces individually.
---
&gt;I found this post to be clutter
---
Your findings are incorrect. That's why people are mad at you. You can't just say 2+2=5. Objective truth exists and this issue is definitely relevant. If you can't talk about a serious issue on reddit then it'll never see the light of day.
---
This is very much like Bethesda.

I actually wanted to do that but I was like “ain’t no npc wanna-be robbin’ me in this god forsaken wasteland”
---
Thanks guys. Eventually it got fixed after the server maintainance.
---
Chill the hell out man. 76 isn't particularly good, but it can still be fun. I still play it most night, but mostly as a social hub. If it weren't, I'd stop playing. 
---
And yes, you can measure how good this game is objectively. Here are some of the units. Number of minutes frozen/ glitched/ crashed. The higher this number, the lower the good score. Number of exclusively game activities. The higher the better. Number of unique builds/ weapon and armours/ events/ challenges/ NPCs/ mechanics/ bosses. Also higher the better as it creates replayablity. Also the % of focus on free vs payed content. A tricky one as we do get a fair share of free stuff, but also way too much focus on atom shop items, which are generally superior. You can also measure how many times a bug or exploit has ruined the meta amd how long it's taken to be resolved. It's still near impossible to beat a player if you don't have some kind of rapid explosive weapon, without sacrificing the build you want to play. 
---
So my personal, SUBJECTIVE assessment is....meh. It started as a turd, went up a bit, when down again and finally managed to become alrightish? Still too few builds to challenge the meta, barely any endgame content that is exclusively end game. Vending, taming, camping are all pretty good. Bugs still too common. Armour choices are mostly naff (could have at least given the fallout 4 armouts some cosmetic changes depending on the mods, like the base games) and the atom shop remains by far the worst insult any game has ever made. £5 for a hat, jesus. 
---
So yeah, objectively compared to most other games in a similar vein, its low to average. Thankfully it is in the good position of moving upwards, as long as they don't fuck it up, especially if wastelanders makes serious and permanent changes like we are expecting. 
---
But the final note before you pop your top in a rage, it doesnt matter how good or bad the game is, as long as you enjoy it. However you still need to pay attention to and respect other players feelings on the game, and try to understand. If it's a majority, theres a good chance they have some good points and should probably be supported to a degree, as to not allow companies to start a trend of increasingly poor games because they'll get your cash either way.
---
Same here. Not a word since.
---
More mods for some of the new ones we got would be nice, .50 cal has one mod and I don't think the LMG has any. 
---
The crossbow could use some love too. On top of not having mods its damage output is pitiful. 
---
As far as new weapons I like the idea of a heavy energy weapon that doesn't require spinning up.
---
A .308 battle rifle would be cool too, I know the combat rifle has a .308 receiver but the guns styled after real ones are always a little cooler.
---
I have 2 handmade rifles it happens with. Been logging out melee and that stops the ammo thing. Some say they don't lose the ammo.
---
I'm on Xbox.  Have two systems right next to each other. I have 6 mule accounts now, mostly for caps.

Oh, wow that's crazy!

Personally I try to go for some realism, so I'd hate to use this method
---
You online?
---
Ah, Ive never noticed the plan.
---
I'm gonna respectfully disagree. You spend the whole story chasing living characters... only to find them dead when you finally get there just a bit too late... There ARE human NPCs, and they DO add to the story. 
---
They're just not "in your face".
---
You're addicted to alcohol. Addictol will fix it.
---
The only reason for stash limit is technical limitations. There is no revard for good item management, only backfire for bad management. Thus bigger limit is always good.
---
Thanks for the pro tip.  Never thought of that.  Still working on my first backpack unfortunately but hope to try this at some point.
---
Ritual mask, you can find it in a locked room in the mothman museum
---
I didn't launch my first one till almost level 100 and I did it solo too. I was kinda weary about it at first but once you make it through that first time and see it's not to bad you'll get a bit addicted to launching them. I launch one about every weekend now just to do it. I tend to spend the week restocking up on stims and ammo to prepare for my next launch.
---
Good job though, it's definitely not an easy task your first time.
---
There are 25 coolant caps in the air conditioners on the side of buildings in harpers ferry that will break down to 50 scrap. You can server hop and loot them every time as they don't seem to have a cool down timer like other world containers.  A couple of server hops and you will be rolling in it. Some of the ac units are high so it helps if you and a teammate are mutated so you can take advantage of strange in numbers. If you are solo there is at least one ac unit you may have to skip due to it's height.
---
Haha yeah that’s the worst. Every gun you carry instant requested 😅 no man I’m carrying them because I use them. Then pull out what I’ll sell “no I want the bloodied handmade and laser gun” yeah well so do I 😂 haha
---
You need the teir 3  and any tameable things have a charisma requirement. Also it needs to be a random spawn with only ONE of the creature spawning and even then you only have a chance of it working.
---
What this guy said.
---
Is it odd it keeps falling down differently??
---
It can also be found inside the Lucky Hole mine, on top of a control panel in a room located behind the altar.
---
PSN same as name?
---
Gt Rideosiris
---
It’s physics seem to change each time it respawns
---
There are other Fallout Online games? Or does FO mean something else? But you say caps, so...
---
Plans actually are a bad idea. For the CAMP plans, what do you show? For the PA mods, what do you show? For the weapons mods, what do you show?
---
I would also like a serum or a machine to step in ( costing caps obviously ) to remove a mutation I don't want.
---
How do I get the backpack, I brought the shovel one from the atomic shop but won’t me craft it?
---
Ah, thank you!
---
Addicted to something.  Alcohol will show a red martini glass on your buff bar.  Others don’t show a thing.
---
This is a great idea!
---
You can make a very solid HW/Explosives build, they synergize very well. So you aren’t reliant on the autogrenade, but you can pull it out for special occasions.
---
I’ve bee running one since launch. Explosives got a bit of a nerf, but the other HW got buffed up, so it’s about picking the right tool for the job, and with bear arms and ordinance express, you can carry all the tools with you all the time. 
---
I recommend a low health build, it works very well in PA and makes your damage actually feel “right”. I can oneshot a level 60 sentrybot with my 2shot missile launcher. My 50cal can rip a scorchbeast out of the sky in seconds. Anything below a supermutant melts in a bullet, maybe two. I solo the L100 boss at the end of Arkatos in a box or two. My 2shot fatman can 1shot mirelurk queens...
---
I was going to post the same, haven't heard a word on my end yet...
---
From my personal experience, when posting about issues they get downvoted or no voted. Sometimes the community grasps onto and idea and pushes it to the top, but since the bag issue isnt effecting a large portion of the community, they wont care. A lot of us are still effected by bugs from the first month that supposedly have been patched, but if you say anything, your just an angry troll who obviously doesnt play the game. But thats the nature of the internet.
---
I don't think most people believe you can enjoy something but also be critical of it.
---
The dealer analogy is relevant because a lot of people are addicted to these games. One of the reasons they can't move on from something they don't like.
---
Yea dude! Like a glow
---
Drink more vodka, winners don't quit!!!! 🍸🍸🍸
---
Marsupial should give you digitigrade legs
---
For Frak's sake, I could go online, find someone who sells monogrammed canvas bags and pay them to make me a bag that says whatever the hell I want in ten minutes, why can't Bethesda just do the same?
---
Lmao! You have to finish the game first to receive your bag, you have 7000hrs to complete! Please come again. Just kidding, I  am in the same boat.
---
I think you can do that with any build for a boost. Put mutations on both, and why not have them both drink and do drugs too.
---
This is alot of useful info thanks for sharing.
---
aaaaahh, thx for the headsup
---
I unfortunately bought the twisted muscle mutation instead of the rad aura one :( I hope I sell it
---
Considering "contacting support" only ever gets you meaningless platitudes and assurances that mean jack all, while internet outrage can, frequently does, and in the case of the bag issue did get results?
---
I think it's pretty clear what the best way to make things happen as a consumer is. Customer support as a concept is great if you're having a one off issue that is easily fixed, but when it comes to major anti-consumer practices it doubles as a buffer and a way to hide how upset people are.
---
I would simply like the ability to make my character a Super Mutant, or a Robot, and these should come with some basic Benefits &amp; Limitations.
---
* Super Mutant: is allowed up to 25 Strength, but intelligence gets limited to 5, and they should be able to eat anything and be healed by Rads.
---
* Robot: is allowed extra slots in Strength (3), Endurance (3) &amp; Intelligence (4), but Luck is limited to 5, they should have High Rad resistance and require energy instead of Food.
---
Character builds? None are "better off"... that's not why you play them. You play them for... well... character. Nerfed, useless, or somehow magically awesome... you go all in.
---
Now for sheer raw ability to kill things? My drunk/high/melee only cannibal clown works really well.
---
My ghoul, however, is well suited for survivability (lowered need for food, less rads, less disease, more effect from water and food, etc)
---
My Doctor build is brilliant on teams. Group proximity heals, 15 CHA so he can share any card he wishes, and waaaaaay stronger on teams. 
---
Character builds are about sheer stupid fun... nothing else.
---
Or more alcohol... 😏
---
Shit...which one of you guys is correct... only one way to settle this...
---
*cue boss battle music*
---
Ah good to know!
---
Or could just ask any garment manufacturers in India or china.  Those factories can make and ship ten thousands in a week
---
Never shop on survival servers.
---
if it makes you feel any better the only two useful ones are ammo and meds and even then not until you level them up. by the time you get to 50+ you shouldnt really need the medicine one anymore
---
Sadly, yes.  Had the same thing happen to me, luckily I only have a few things listed but its very annoying.
---
I like this idea.
---
Not really man. I don't think of myself as better than anyone. "Toxic kiddies" was just a metaphor for toxic players, perhaps a badly chosen one. It's a pleasant change to play a game with a more friendly player base. Normally, the larger the player base, the less friendly the community is. Fallout 76's bad launch pushed many people away, leading to a smaller player base and therefore less douchebags. I don't really know where you are getting the whole "only NICE and MORALLY SUPERIOR people like ME are playing" thing from.
---
I'm sorry you found my post both "gross" and "embarassing", but maybe you can rest easier knowing that we aren't "slogging through" Fallout 76 because it makes us feel superior, we are playing because we enjoy it.
---
Will it give free hugs?
---
I had that happen. Fortunately I didn't die, but it was kinda funny.
---
I hope that another duping exploit got fixed.
---
The game designers clearly know jack-all about guns, so I'm gonna write this off as "maybe got lucky" rather than any historical or IRL accuracy. I modded a buddy's hunting rifle for a .50 receiver... it made the gun LIGHTER. (&gt;|&lt;)
---
I had the other problem the other day. A level 15 turned up to free range and he died constantly, partly because he had like 4/5ths rads. After I beat the squatch I gave him 5 radaway and he was so grateful that he started following me everywhere. It creeped me out and I had to leave the server.
---
Yeah same email account on both xboxs will do the trick. Any other account that signs in that some xbox can use the game you already have or previously had.
---
Can’t destroy bases anymore though.
---
I always run away from my camp before it can fully spawn into the world, sometimes I run into it as its spawning into the world so I don't even have to open the door.
---
Agreed, I’m swimming in meds and I didn’t use it properly.....
---
I have a bloodied 40% swing mole miner gauntlet that can almost take one out before it regens. I can do this weird little dance around the back of it and only sometimes get 1 shotted with a slap attack.
---
Preach, man. Preach.
---
Six months after being approved is the initial estimate.
---
Any bags made would just now be getting shipped out.
---
If you want info, contact support and provide them with the info you gave in the ticket to see what the progress it or if they can give any updates.
---
Much like real life the correct answer is always more alcohol. 😉
---
After the first few quests you quickly realize that everyone is dead, there isn't much mystery in that.  I just think it would be more fun to find living characters in the game.  Raider Rose would have been much more interesting as a human npc than another robot.  It would have made reactivating  the radio tower actually mean a bit more in my opinion.  Idk, I'm not completely hung up on it but I just like the human drama aspect in the other fallout games.
---
Burrows is not worth even the score "okey". Even the modders have said, that there is nothing worth mentioning in Burrows- Same reused assets with nothing special, they couldn't build up on weekend themselves. 
---
Arktos Pharma is definitely not well designed area. One of the friendly monsters is Charred Ghouls or something like. First the designer have made rivers/cracks into room floor, where monster is getting stuck and then it cant find the path. Not only does it get stuck in ground, but also friendly monster is getting stuck in places/corners that are dark and render that dark colored monster nearly invisible. Worst part is that, you don't even know if it is stuck in the right room. All you know is that monster is taking damage and VATS aint targeting anything. Some of the bosses are big, but designer didn't think it through and filled with small doors, where monsters are just being getting stuck and shooted till dead, while being little to no threat. Designer should have taken all this consideration when building an such environment.
---
Ticket but if you haven't filled one out you're shit out of luck.
---
First week of May was the deadline.
---
Hows a shotgun build after the nerfs? Still have a tse combat shotgun thats been collecting dust but dont want to part with it.
---
And you get another set of dialogue if your drop the item and pick it back up. 😉
---
Happens every now and then, sucks having to totally restock it. Hopefulky that gets fixed soon.
---
I've never ran a chems/alcohol build before. I'd think you would have quite a lot of flexibility though. Any weapon with a Junkie's prefix could potentially gain +50% dmg. You could run some sort of build that relies on addictions and additional damage from popping other chems. Any Junkie's weapon could fly so you have a lot of wiggle room with what you want to run with it. 
---
I personally love running a heavy mutation focused build with a melee character. Your shotgunner/melee toon should be setup very closely for what you need. There are a too many benefits of playing melee with mutations, talons and twisted muscles for added damage, speed demon for sprinting around and closing gaps, marsupial to escape or insane mobility, grounded and scaly skin for added defense. You can really take advantage of a lot of mutations as melee. I specifically run with no Power Armor, the hud takes away the immersion for me.
---
the max level for no more cards with the worst kind of luck is Lv543
---
I don't think they're downvoting because it's critical (the canvas bags don't even have anything to do with the game itself), but because this question literally gets asked every other day. 
---
*2 weeks pass*
---
"Guys, I haven't recieved any updates on my canvas bag. You think they're lying and running? I think they're lying!"
---
"Chill out, I got a email a few days from them, so it's likely still a work in progress"
---
*2 days later*
---
"ANY NEW UPDATES ON THE CANVAS BAGS????"
---
It’s definitely not that. I didn’t need specific perks to build it (and even if I did, I didn’t change them).
---
Dogs and other small animals would be nice but I personally don't want to see pet deathclaws and other extremely large animals.
---
Well that’s the kind of base I want.
---
I totally agree.
---
Hah! Yea that just sums it up
---
Admittedly, it's been a while since I sold one.  I think the market was satiated pretty early on.
---
It's incredible how you in one sentence say there are less douchebags because they have been "pushed" away yet in another claim to not understand how someone thinks you feel superior for continuing to play, which is very different from WHY you continue to play.
---
In your mind, large population games are toxic because they must have a large population of children? There is no way a small population game can contain only "douchebags"?
---
It's fantasy enactment. It's the same as when during launch, all of the games problems was blamed on "YouTubers looking for viewers" which was conspiratorial in nature and lead to a lot of witch hunting here.
---
Shotgun builds have not been nerfed that I am aware of. TSE were, but that is a legendary weapon unrelated to the build.
---
A shotgun build is cheat mode. nothing can stand against you. Pun intended.
---
Could you repeat that i none mole-minish?
---
How fucking hard can it be to source a cheap fucking bag and get it stamped. I can get them done by end of week ffs. Just not as cheap as unhumanely possible.
---
is your stash box full?
---
But...  what about a mail system so I can role player a mailman? And I can send mail to one of the other 23... oop. 22 people on the server instead of just fast traveling to them or sending an invite or something else that's way easier?
---
Or what about my pet deathclaw? Who I names Steve and he had this crazy awesome back story. But then he died so I went to do a full on report why my virtual pet meant more than a real life responsibility? What about that?
---
Visual bug or do you really have that much?
---

"People seem to forget just how TERRIBLE WoW was during the first half or even all of vanilla"....  Hmmmm
---
Damn straight.
---
I've been meaning to post about this.
---
I have a golf club, tee, and ball.
---
Also baseball, basketball, and kickball. We have most of the things in the game. Just need the animations
---
You certainly can. Christ, how I loathe those levitating eyesores.
---
Yeah, like marsupial should put a smaller power armor guy around my bigger power armor guy's belly.
---
It's flaired as a bug. I probably don't even have 100 ultracite in total.
---
Nope, but I relogged and its working fine now. TY!
---
I agree. I feel like most of us use 2-3 main ammo types. I would love to be able to sell my 5mm to someone who would actually use it, and try to get the 5.56 that everyone wants (I miss how common it was in FO4).
---
Relog and see if it resetts.
---
it  looks like a UI integer overflow
---
Nope, but I relogged and it's working fine now. TY!
---
 "People seem to forget just how TERRIBLE WoW was during the first half or even all of vanilla"....  Hmmmm
---
have pharma perk - go to acros pharma - stick to the upper dont go into basement.
---
Literally dozens of chem boxes to be looted/searched - will deliver good quantity of what you need.
---
Visual bug, happens to certain materials when viewing in component view, imagine my shock when it said I had billions of screws...
---
500 atoms is laughable... You can buy like, a third of a power armor.

Thanks a lot.

:(
---
Its all garbage in the first place. Learn from it and think the next time you wanna put extra money down on plastic with no real value.
---
Let me drop another,  "People seem to forget just how TERRIBLE WoW was during the first half or even all of vanilla"....  Hmmmm
---
This has never happened to me though I always spawned at the edge.
---
I think those are the code numbers. I noticed the other day that component view was showing items I didn't have in inventory.
---
Graham fought off ghouls who were trying to murder me as I perused his shop. Sure its likely more about making the sale, but it was a nice gesture.
---
Didn't it go from like 20 to 2? Who looks at a chainsaw and thinks yeah that should be the weakest weapon in the game?
---
I always stock a flaming chainsaw in my vendor for cheap because a lot of people still don't know about it.
---
Lol that would have driven me mad not being able to move my junk to a safe spot
---
If only...
---
Was she someone to you?
---
Mean "how dare you?!" reddit post incoming lol
---
I'm guessing it's downvoted because the sub (as well as /r/fallout) gets asked the question almost every other day. Sometimes they get upvoted a lot, most of the time they don't.
---
If you search on this sub the word "Canvas," sorted by new, not counting this post, there have been 17 posts asking about the Canvas Bag within the past 30 days. They'll come when they come, but seriously, at least wait a week after someone else has already asked.
---
The very thought just popped into my head last night LOL.
---
Not to discourage you from your quest but I am in the forest, a hop skip and a jump from Vault 76 and I tried/continue to try to put good stuff in for low levels but only high level players ever buy them.  My hope is that they really are using it on an alt but it is a bit disheartening the level 15 bloodied meat hook I put in my machine for 15 caps is bought by a level 78 character.  Happens constantly and of course they either dont answer or dont have a mic when I ask why they bought an item 50+ levels lower than themselves 🙄
---
aha, a duper, lol
---
You're not wrong
---
Yeah, but at least there's a reason robot spew the same dialogue over and over again.
---
Humans that start repeating dialogue right slightly higher on the "immersion breaking scale" than do actual bugs, in my book.
---
case in point: "They shot Alex!"
---
For me its a Toss up between

That's kinda where I'm stuck too. For the first time i decided not to do any legendary runs and just work on badges yesterday. It was actually a lot more fun than I've had in awhile, i finally did my first silo run for that 1 tadpole badge. I didn't realize how many hackable terminals were in there, damn near got that whole badge done in a single silo run.
---
except you are  using an explosive ultracite laserrifle than this amount is barely enough
---
It would be really cool to have it
---
Pretty paranoid thinking somebody would be out to get yall like. Maybe people just dont give a fuck about morons who buy plastic garbage for 100 bucks?
---
No...a mudcrab!
---
We all have this moment. Mine came to reading about Pharma Farma after carrying Cap Collector and Scrounger level 3 for the first 40+ levels. All that time...all those wasted points...
---
Aren’t punching weapons (bloodied at least) the most powerful build in the game already?
---
She was  My first, the last, my everything.
---
I did this with the 120 carry weight and the 60 carry weight. I normally use the 60 for everyday traveling and then once I'm over encumbered and the shit hits the fan then I pop on the 120 carry weight and book it.
---
Nah that was changed in a patch. Random encounters are not affected by player camps. An lol @ at the people who down voted me.
---
The par for some would be funny. 3 strokes to green, 145 .45 for 7 ghouls, 8 wandering scorched, 3 40mm grenade rounds for yau guai.
---
How do you check your ticket? I submitted one forever ago, but now I can't find it
---
You're making sure you went back to the same server? Cause they should stick around until server reset.
---
can't hurt to try
---
Well that’s very nice of you...
---
How..............Just..................How?!
---
Huh. Guess I was mistaken
---
Ya, good point.
---
New Vegas was also trashed back in the day. While fans consider it the best fallout game, it wasn't as successful as Fallout 3 or 4.
---
I like your story. And I joined a fight with the SBQ for the first time this weekend. I believe I helped just as much as anyone, and felt good knowing that the person who launched the nuke was successful. 
---
SBQ didn't drop anything for me though :(
---
CD Projeckt Red is twice the size and manpower of BGS, even AFTER BGS bought the studio that would become Bethesda Austin. And it has government funding from poland, i believe.  
---
BGS is nowhere near as big, it's barely bigger than a single or double A studio. and because they don't have public shareholders, they have less capital to work with.
---
I'm not saying this excuses anything. But it is context people forget. Bethesda isn't always buggy because they're lazy. They're buggy because they're always trying to make games WAY beyond the reasonable scope that a game with their manpower should make.
---
People compare bethesda games to AAA companies, but companies like Ubisoft have 34 TIMES the manpower as BGS, and that's just not a fair comparison. You might as well compare your younger brother to captain america, because they're both dudes.
---
After relogging everything shows as zero now. I have junk in my inventory.
---
Careful fella! Don't twiddle 'em to close over the buy button...
---
Look up the inside the Vault articles... That will give you an insight Into what's new.

Love it 😁👍
---
Maybe a bowling pin club as well. Bladed , nails , electrified mods for it.
---
Anything is easy when you only have to do it once. Anything is difficult when you have to do the same at scale.
---
I picked up a two shot (one star) .50 Caliber from a level 50 sheepsquatch a couple days ago.
---
It would be cool if you had the option of making the second one a floor or wall safe
---
Turns out there is actually a world shortage on canvas /s
---
I mean, no one's making you choose a deathclaw..and if you're teaming up with someone that does just ask them to dismiss them back to their camp. Easy peasy.
---
I've been calling for this since launch!  Preach!
---
That's why it says "search" on it, you never thought to actually hit the "search" button? Ouch. :(
---
I mean I guess just because we’re on survival mode we can still trade, I like the rush, I also think you would like people buying your stuff?
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Just have to have mutations open up visualizations as an option.  Have the mutation - option exists to add or remove visual effect.  Don't have the mutation? - no such option exists for you.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/KHDQIV7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KHDQIV7.jpg)  That should help
---
Yup!
---
Same on PS4
---
Thanks. Ill have to look into this for something different.
---
Lol I haven’t seen one of those yet. I’d like to find one. Someone had built an oven before hahaha
---
Many people probably would of murdered Graham on sight but since he's an immortal overpowered god it was easy for him to shrug off bullets and show us he was friendly. I once saw him pick up an Alpha Deathclaw, tap it against the side of a car like an egg to crack it open and slurp down all it's innards in a single gulp. We're no threat to him.
---
Fine
---
That is why, in the end days, I didn't even bother setting prices, I just sold with price what ever vendor gave.
---
Exp is not shared. Hit it, get exp. No free carries if you don’t at least tag something.
---
If you haven't server hopped at least a dozen tries, you probably shouldn't give up. I've hopped literally all day looking for a specific thing. A couple hops probably will never be enough.
---
As a stopgap, I've seen players use the Small Letters to spell out what they want, somewhere near their vending machines.
---
Lay off the nukashine kid.
---
I mean don’t worry - as you can see she respawned! Repeatedly...
---
There are plans for The Fixer ? Does anyone know how to get?
---
I’m more of a Ballistic Bock kinda guy
---
Have you met the sleeping ghouls yet? I think they're the successors.
---
This is how I do it. I generally find an outfit and take it from there. I have one typical build character ( bloodied unyielding ) who is gathering dust while I think of something to do with them. Currently working on a rifles and chems raider because I got a travelling leather coat to drop.
---
Meet me at 9pm Kaliningrad train station with my fully unyielding sunshine - 
---
Bare knuckles, no stims.
---
Drop those mutations that agro things, they're going to cause you grief even without other players.
---
Good thing all they have to worry about is paying someone else to deliver a product, not refitting a factory to make the product themselves... unless that's what they're trying to do in which case that would explain a lot.
---
I mean, you can always make it harder on yourself by choosing weaker armor options.
---
It's not that bad. I started a new char to use in survival back when the caps loss was like double your level or something.
---
I still use that char now. I'm better then average but I'm not the best. I usually have most kills per week on a server unless the big guys show up with 45 kills.
---
That video is a rare occurrence although those names are the people who have the 45 kills. One of them has changed their name since then and they have built a bigger fortress. All they care about are numbers.
---
I've killed them too once. But they use these beam splitters on older explosive bloodied laser rifles that just decimate. I imagine they will be needed someday.
---
Anyway, be ready to die. It's not a big deal. You loose some junk and aid and move on. 
---
Get good at farming efficiently and remember to drop your loot off. If you don't want to be on the leader board then let yourself die 
---
The extra danger is what makes survival the best mode to play in. It is truly fun.
---
Protip turn your mouse sensitivity down and get used to moving your arm a bit more for aiming. It's helped me get better.
---
Strong in FO4 was a nice (ISH) supermutant.
---
Pretty sure that guy didn't read your comment. I for one love survival mode, and it's the only reason Ive been logging in past couple months.
---
However I strongly agree with your points on PvP and grouping in adventure mode. For instance I would like to run Arktos more to get the diffuser plan but no one shows up. I can team invite the entire server and get MAYBE one to accept and I don't blame them.
---
This defeats the purpose of having a online coop game if no one is willing to group for content. I don't need ppl running around my single player game naked or in bathrobes messing up my immersion.
---
At the same time this isn't anywhere near an MMO. I mean don't get me wrong, no where near as bad as people made this game out to be, but it was more problematic than it should have. All completely expected though because ALL TES/Fallout games with Bethesda involved were problematic (heck, even the originals had problems, like in Fallout 2 eventually your car's trunk would get separated from the car, never had a playthrough where that didn't happen). Couple that with modding a game kind of designed and built around being single player into a multiplayer game and oh boy, you're going to get even bigger problems.
---
I don't really see what the 200 lootable would do.  Why put anything of value in there?  And if there's no reason to put anything of value in there what purpose would it serve?    
---
I'd rather just have a 100 lb account wide stash that every character on an account can access so I can at least mule stuff without needing a 2nd player available.
---
Yes. Also, who the hell is maintaining those greens???
---
I found than an AA shotgun is best. explosive is optional, as AA and Enforcer will cripple anything fast. Wing shots even seems to make the Queen land more often.  
---
But even with a non legendary shotgun, you can hold your own in any battle. I would go full auto on my AA combat, but keeping enough ammo in stock gets really tough.
---
Damn. I just dropped a level 15 one-star at a vendor camp by 76 so the owner could do whatever they wanted with it. I have a low level alt, but care packages are few and far between now.
---
Your objective units don't take exploration into account. Home building, player trading, Social activities, lore discovery, writing, quests and the ratio just how many hours of gameplay it convinces you to continue playing, for whatever reason, compared to the price.
---
Are these above units the be all and end all? No, there's probably as many as stars in the sky. But that just means it's no longer objective. I don't really care if my game freezes, glitches, or crashes, even once or twice a day. Unique builds? It doesn't matter, because to me, every build is unique. Its not really objective at all.
---
There are perks that cannot be maxxed until well after Level 50. Most of those perks are the best perks in the game.  They make a significant difference in damage output, health regen, crafting etc....   
---
Also, just the raw time in game after level 50 is when you start to really acquire and refine your best weapons and armor to match your perks. It makes a huge difference over time.  (acquiring a crap ton more caps so you can buy mutation serums and recipes also matters). 
---
But really, it's about getting exactly the cute outfit you want to be seen in... ;)
---
My junks safe space has kittens and coloring books.
---
Yup. Carrying both and swapping is great. Run and Gun with 60 over encumbered, and pop on the 120 when you need to just bail.
---
Tbh I never saw it! Hot damn!
---
I got this the other day:

---
I think the robots said at some point they are in charge of maintaining the grounds along with security.
---
Lol!  Let's just go farm legandarys instead.
---
&gt; Just not as cheap as unhumanely possible.
---
So you don't own a successful business then :)
---
When my team and I used to farm whitesprings respawning over and over to get as many legendaries as possible we would put everything not worth while in the ice box in front of the golf club and then when we finally decided to call it a night go back through to find any worth while single star items to keep and leave the rest that we didn’t want to carry for other random players to discover.
---
I don’t PvP but my suggestion would be to just change all legacy explosive weapons to 25% faster fire rate as a replacement effect.  Done and done - no nerf needed.
---
Damn. Nine holes with nothing but a Buzz Blade to mow the whole thing. Brutal.
---
I used to be able to select the whole structure, but now that isn't working.  And when I try to select pieces individually, sometimes previously selected pieces disappear from the selection!
---
If it helps I got my Atoms!

Mannequins are the real silent evil of the fallout universe much like the Weeping Angels of Doctor Who!

This could help if you have the time to scroll through all your CAMP options. I'm not sure if it's been updated recently though.
---
This weapon is a great for pissing people off, just follow someone around hitting everything they fight with bloatflies
---
Thanks! Might have a look.
---
I was definitely around that level when I figured that out, too.
---
All characters should have mutations - can’t imagine playing the game without Marsupial and Speed Demon.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't do it with legendaries. I tried that right before the scrapping  machines came in, and very quickly high level players bought everything just to scrap it. I'm talking about regular weapons and armor with all the bells and whistles, stuff low level characters haven't got the plans or resources to build for themselves. It'd really just be a side hustle, anyway, most of my vending contents would stay like they are with one machine for low level freebies.
---
I’m sure something will be done about it. They were shelved with them citing that they would make some adjustments of some sort. Bethesda is usually slow to fix bugs and balance issues. As a Dense/fireproof user this effect definitely seems bs
---
It's incredible how quickly you misunderstood what i typed. 
---
Do i think everyone that has been pushed away from the game is a douchebag? 
---
No (and i'd like you to show me where you think i said this)
---
Do i think large population games are toxic because they have a large population of children?
---
No, they are generally toxic because of a large population, not because of children, I explained in my last post that "toxic kiddies" was not the best term to describe toxic players and I apologise for the confusion.
---
Do i think small population games are totally free of douchebags?
---
No, stop thinking in such black and white terms, I was making a general point about large players bases being more toxic, nothing more.
---
I think what's happening here is that you are using my post to rant about several other opinions that you've seen and have bothered you. This is evidenced by the fact that you're arguing two points which I didn't make. I have said nothing about feeling MORALLY SUPERIOR and I haven't made a single mention of any YouTuber.
---
I hate to say it, I found there too be more PVP  lately in adventure mode then what I have seen in survival mode lately. I was attacked and killed well resting the other night. I was attacked well at the white Springs train station well dealing with the vendor. The pacified mode does not work properly. Adventure mode is becoming abit of  griefers paradise again. Bethesda does not do anything about reported players, I  still keep running into the same idiot's after a week or so? They get rewards for hitting you regardless if you challenge them or not. Nonetheless I completely agree with you. I wish you the best, I apologize for my rant. Lol. Hope to see you in the wasteland.
---
I have nothing against survival mode and would like to try it once things get ironed out better. After reading what many lost early on, I figured I just wait. 
---
I tried that twice and people had no idea what to do which is the issue most the time. Many don’t have a mic and wouldn’t listen anyways. 
---
Good crews are hard to come by so when I see them I see them a lot and usually end up in parties like for SBQ deals.
---
You haven’t gotten the bag yet because you first need to take a picture of 100 random creatures in your neighborhood then Bethesda will send you the plan so you can craft it on your own.
---
No one but the full-time whiners ever actually cared about this nonsense. You didn’t get a canvas bag. Boo-hoo 😢
---
I did my first queen fights this last week as well.  Got in on probably 10 this weekend.   It wasn’t nearly as chaotic as I would have thought.   I think only a few were in the nuked zone.  I died twice.....both after the queen was dead.....killed by f’ing crickets gathering flux.   I’m definitely addicted now.  It’s all I want to do in the game.
---
That would be epic.
---
You're just a cog in the machine of toxicity that continues to make this subreddit a cesspool. I wouldn't be worried about how you aren't even aware of it.

The Mire creeps me out too much. Poseidon Energy is a thought, though, and I'll take a look. Thanks!
---
Plan: The Fixer is a possible reward for successfully completing the Encryptid event, allowing player characters to craft a level 20/30/40/50 version of the rifle.

Strap on a Tesla coil to your power armor or try using weapons with area damage (grenades, explosive weapons) to max your exp in groups.

Its a common error in the components view since they updated it to track all junk types.

You could do this in fo4 so the general framework exists :)

It would be cool if you could select various lines of dialogue and voice options for the bot from a huge list so every player can have a somewhat unique personality.  The voice options also exist in fo4 so again, it's mostly built :)

Buy the 3-star legendary package for a chance to get a legendary item when shipped.
---
I had a dead one twerking for me yesterday.   Lol
---
I would change my Account name to Assaultron, and hang out in Watoga on the Survival Server.
---
Never forgotten! My personal favorite would be stretchy wolves.
---
Tiny human. So weak, i am strongest super mutant.
---
It didn't end the same way, but several months back, I was in a similar situation where we had an SBQ fight and the server shutdown timer came up.
---
What was truly amazing is that *everyone* fought to the final second, even when it was fast becoming hopeless.
---
I found 5 of those guys at the medical supply place in the mire yesterday.  I just jumped up on a truck and sniped them with my lever.  I think fighting the queens are worse.  That poison attack just wrecks me, even in power armor.
---
That darn statue has been the bane of my existence.
---
I'd definitely take the option of looking like a ghoul
---
They even had the video of it, with the Assaultron wife helping cook at the campfire!  
---
This is one of my most-wanted features.
---
I was in a wagon with my hands bound headed towards a raider execution ground.  /s
---
Time for a break from the internet man.
---
Mostly camp building. But I've also found a new interest in making hybrid character builds.
---
This.  Also I'd add that there's no need for a new character.
---
I had this happening right before the maintenance this morning. New problem for me too
---
Normally I shut down people who always whine about the game, but this situation is totally different. If someone pays for a product they need to get everything that they thought would come with it. That’s illegal not to fulfill the agreement
---
Can confirm
---
You are definitely a fool ... especially falling for that line. 
---
Are you serious ? You are really gonna fall that ? 
---
Wow I guess the industry really is more fucked than I thought... Swear i should stop gaming and work my way into these companies and make a lot money off people like you. Lol people like you dude are Easy cash for low effort. 
---
Btw if you haven’t noticed at launch ... first impressions are very fuckin important.
---
So sad :(
---
Yes, but only if it's some hilariously horrific murderball variant, like Moe Cronin's description of baseball in Fallout 4.
---
Just the ones who don’t drop a bunch of money on the “extra-super-special-exclusive-edition pre-order now” bullshit people keep falling for. You should just chalk it up as a life lesson and move on.
---
Yes i figured but i wanted the number. Wonder if it's between 300-400?
---
Waaaaaaahh don't invade my safe space lolz
---
On PS4 orig i could walk thru walls of any camp, before it rendered. It is about your rig.
---
They made one for new Vegas too. It got delivered too.  :v
---
stand by for a ban haha
---
Don't feel so bad at least your post hasn't been deleted yet.
---
There's nothing to fix, per se. This is Bethesda's intended behavior.
---
Try just before you get into Flatwoods but after the purveyors camp.  Most chars should be 5ish at that point and they've just been raped by dogs and robots.  They will be desperate for some better gear.  And youd be wise to place a sign out front that says you have low level gear so they stop in.  Happy vending 😊
---
Likely story. Stealth nerf inbound!
---
Why on earth would you want this? Did you even think? 😄
---
“Hang on, just finished grinding for that perfect gun and armour for my ALT, let me just transfer that”
---
*logs in on other character*
---
“WHERE THE FU”
---
I do the same thing with my bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet just keep behind them and turn when they turn I always feel bad when I do that to Deathclaws they really have no way to hit you.
---
Stash limits and maximum cap limits are ridiculous. Especially if you have vending machine at your camp and sell alot of items. For example you sell past your maximum cap allowance and people are paying for items you don't get paid for? I think it time for Bethesda to slow down on DLC content and start concentrating on the core game and the glitches, it really starting to get on my nerves! Their should be know reason for higher stash limit and unlimited cap amounts.  I don't care about the servers not being able to handle the content, recode and find a salutation for the problem not an excuse to keep people playing. Sorry for my rant, I wish everyone the best.
---
The show follows the books fairly well but some things are condense of course.  Leviathan Wakes is the name of the first book if you want to go that route.  Expanse was cancelled by SyFy due to the deal they inked restricting their monetization options.  A major save the show campaign convinced Jeff Bazos to pick it up on Amazon, season 4 will air later this year.
---
Only if you could Mulligan each time you got mobbed
---
That's a bad idea with unforeseen consequences as there are other legendary effects that also increase ROF.  Getting 2 on an already high ROF weapon would be more broken than what you are trying to fix.    
---
All they need to do is insure the explosive effect works as intended on this class of weapons.  A dense or padded chest mod and a few ranks in fireproof hard counters explosive in PvP.  This sounds like a bug if explosive works differently on these weapons than anything else so why change the effect if a bug fix is all that's needed?
---
RIP in piece Stretchy McDeadscorch
---
such a good feeling! it's especially enjoyable now that the game is a wee bit more stable.
---
when the game first launched, nuking a fissure site and the ensuing fight would usually always crash the entire server haha I actually fought a SBQ yesterday and the server couldn't handle it so hard that like 10 of the players fighting it weren't even visible. it looked like me and 2 others were the only ones there, but if you pulled the map up you could see a dozen little player icons in the area
---
move your camp or next time hop servers
---
From 600 hours i spend atleast 100 yelling: "fucking bethesda why you do this to me, oh my fucking god, fuck, don't fucking dare to crash now, od course you fucking game,......" 
---
And i love it, great way to get stress out of yourself.
---
Great tip!  Now, back to the badge grind!
---
I've seen some CAMPs do this sort of thing by creating doorways and putting a shelf in the middle, then the vending machine behind that.  It makes it look like a counter, like at the train stations.
---
Big yikes.
---
Scrap the destroyed plants then replant you get the plant resource back but not the fertilizer I think.
---
We need the Apocolypse olympics.
---
Why stop at 2? Make it 4!
---
I would change my name to [Assaultron Gorgon ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/e/eb/AssaultronGorgon-Automatron.png/revision/latest?cb=20170124030019) and hang out in front of Vault 76 to scare new players.
---
More caps=more people
---
Best solution is to remove PVP from the game so we don’t have to have PVP whining impact the PVE game experience.
---
I hate to break it to you: People didn't show up to support you but to get XP, loot, legendaries and more loot. Nuke zones are always full of players and they are all for themselves, some even steal your loot when you die and the worst ones don't help you and wait you to die so that they can get your ultracite...
---
The SBQ is a hit and miss a late. Really gliched one time and works fine on another server. Nonetheless I am glad you nailed her fat ass to the wall. I wish you all the best!
---
That Rocket Sign.... I wonder if they are going to bring the item back in Atomshop for one day....
---
Another poor soul off to Helgen raider camp.....
---
I have seen that as well. Sometimes I've seen some players make a little desk for them to sit at while people buy their stuff. This community can be pretty creative sometimes.
---
im gonna try it but im broke, with the wrong mutation, how much do you think i could get twisted muscle mutation to sell for?
---
You have to complete the scout quest line to then craft one.  If you haven't started the quest line go the the scout camp in toxic valley.  If you haven't started the quest line yet, read one of the posters in one of the train stations to get pointed in the right direction.
---
I use the radier icon :(
---
This game is like an abusive spouse. It means well, and I love it. But my God it wont stop getting drunk and beating me in the kitchen.
---
But 25% faster fire rate is still in game and occupies the same legendary slot as Explosive does, so its a fair replacement.  Although what you're saying is also true if they made them truly explosive, but if they could do that, why not just bring those weapons back into the game.  My understanding is they were taken out because they couldn't make them work right.
---
Yeah, it's similar to those who complain that 76 has no story.
---
Sure, it may not be delivered in the most exciting way possible, but it's a pretty detailed narrative that spans across several locations in a very thoughtful manner.
---
*"To unlock every perk and maximize them, the player must reach at least level 543."*
---
Off to grinding WS then, only 477 levels to go + the other possible combinations wich should be about the same number or a little less. 1000 lvls maybe all in all. Easy peasy.
---
They buy them to shred them for the Purveyor.
---
the new bag looks pretty neat
---

One of the cooler ones I’ve seen was a sealed room with radiation emitters behind all the vending machines.  I saw the sealed door and one of the emitters, so again I threw my power armor on.  The radiation had no effect on me, but killed another player who was also shopping at the vending machines.  In this case the sealable door at the entrance was a pretty big tell.
---
It’s really kind of a shame this is a thing.  I am all for it in survival mode, shop at your own risk.  But the type of players that get caught in these traps appear to be lower level/less experienced.  I would think it would be very discouraging to be a newer player to loose a load of junk because of a loop hole in pacifist mode.
---
But that's not a reroll. That still costs you 200 script for 2 chances. This would cost 125 for 2 chances. Selling it takes literally makes it not a reroll. A reroll is when something is offered for xx amount but for an extra chance that costs xx if you dont like the first. But you can only do it once.
---
One time I was participating in the event, the time did run out but the Queen kept lingering around, even flying around us. When we did manage to kill it, it still dropped loot, I even got a legendary from it.
---
It’s only 7 holes!
---
**BRILLIANT**
---
I've thought this or a junk jet variant gun that shoots golf balls.
---
I dislike golf but i had to give that an upvote, that would be hilarious to see.
---
Yeah, doesn't work quite so well with the imposter though. I pretty much just try to get a hit in between deaths whenever i can. I can do a lot of damage, its just a matter of getting to and hitting that thing.
---
For real. I would exploit the hell out out that
---
You may have the same 12... everything else is melee centric and undesirable to a rifle/Heavy Gunner build.
---
My plasma cores are glitching out, had 12 cores then game was saying only 14 shots for cores and next thing I knew I had 30 something cores with barely any charge
---
Also, the Glow Sight perk should work against you in PVP.
---
Well to start I've had every mutation since day one and build my character around that so they don't really do anything to me... Plus I like that they cripple enemies around me so if I'm over run I have a chance to back up or get to high ground. But here's the problem with what you are suggesting... There isn't a way just get rid of a specific mutation that I'm aware of and even then if I could I would have to respec my character which can take a very long time to do. The pacifist mode will do the trick.
---
I didn't and won't downvote anything but I kinda wanna downvote this comment for bitching about it when this post is the top of the subreddit
---
Nope.
---
Every night  gt EzGrooveRider
---
See u just bought the game this is a legitimate question the worst is when ppl are freaking out during maintenance fiending to play this game..u don't own any other games?
---
I know the reload speed only works for the clip, id assume the dr works the same way
---
I get that it’s about the principle but at what point does one just say to themselves, it’s a canvas bag and I’ve spent 7 months worrying about this dumb thing. Maybe I should just let it go and spend my energy on something else. There is a point where that becomes logical to do. What point is that? 1 year? 2 years? How long can one care about a canvas bag. I know I’m going to get a lot of angry people commenting on this calling me a dumbass but honestly. Some things are just not worth months of stress
---
I think a plain bow and arrow would be pretty cool.  More mods for the crossbow.  I think a good start would be just more mods for all the weapons we have now.
---
Shields would be cool.  Maybe by having your shield raised you could block a certain percent of damage (75% ???).  It would really add to the pvp realm by being able to block some hits
---
I Think the bug is on the Splitter mod an explo effect , instead of 1 shot it shots 5, then 5 explosion effects at once (25% x5 = 125% explosion effect),  they need to reduce the explosion effect in those 5 shots when Splitter installed (5% x5 =25% of explosion effect)
---
Why not? You may not like it, but others have different opinions and are allowed to post them.
---
400-500 caps because that’s @ how much you can vendor it for w max 3 hard bargain perk , grape mentats
---
It would be nice, but at the same time, all of the articles are in one place on the Bethesda website.
---
For me, I think that has more to do with the awkward and specific timing behind blocks.  If I have a block, I should be able to just continually use it unless I'm attacking or running.
---
Has to be a digital copy, but yes works well
---
Calling multiplayer a band aid really is doing them a disservice...
---
Oh I wasn't aware of that, good to know thanks! And I've editted my first reply
---
I'd actually pay for atoms to get this
---
Well, since you paid to be beat in the kitchen, I'd say you're out of alternatives ;-)
---
It *IS* a survival game, and after all, if there was no threat that you *wouldn't* survive...it's not much of a survival game.
---
Then again...my camp is a 30 second run to a fissure site, and even though I don't really get al that many scorch beasts, I have a tendency to just hop servers rather than waste my ammo on them.
---
On XBox or if you're using a controller, when you are under "Junk" and you hit the left bumper, you end up prompting to this weird part of the pipboy.
---
All of a sudden instead of bots downvoting it. People are starting to say that I should forget and forgive about it. And it's fault for carrying about something that I paid for.  .not accusing you or anything but just at all recent comments they are all of the same type
---
It’s actually not too bad.
---
Only if we get the "Glowing" modifier. Otherwise, I'd say the Mutant Slayer modifier be altered to include us as well as Super Mutants.
---
I feel like this is trying real hard to be Kralnor, but I appreciate the effort anyway.
---
Ah I actually bought all the Fallout games a couple years ago after 4 came out and I only just got around to playing NV, it's a lot of fun once you get past the older mechanics and there's tons of mods to make yourself feel more at home with the engine.
---
I play Overwatch as well and know exactly what you mean, I tried out Apex Legends for a bit before getting tired of it and went back to OW and my aim is completely useless now which is sad considering I used to be decent enough to get a couple headsots in.
---
Worth a shot probably. Most likely wont have anyone accept though. That's how people have been griefing...
---
Well I tried it. Had luck of the draw, 5 gun breaking slower and repaired it 200%. TSE dragon still broke in 10 shots. I was taking 1/3 health from lvl 45 gulpers each shot and about 1/4 health from scorchbeast from close range with critical.
---
Unfortunately my heavy weapons with Gatling and plasma Gatling tear these guys up way faster and last wayyyy longer.
---
Sucks was/am trying to make a hunter/survivalist/rifleman build that has a dragon in store for the big boys and a LVA for everything else
---
Have you tried Berserker yet?
---
I just think the pvp in the game is so broken and unbalanced.  Back when the game first launched everyone wore power armor all the time.  Now the pendulum has swung the opposite way.  
---
Honestly I'm glad it isn't my job to balance the pvp mechanics in this game.
---
no they arent
---
I'm in PS4 and I've been trying it, and more often than not someone joins. I've never seen it used for griefing.
---
Bro it was at -2 with 59% downvoted for like an hour or so.  Just look at comments
---
Are you Vats-centric? If so, anything with "aligned" in its name will reduce AP costs. Scopes will increase AP cost. Red dot sights will decrease AP cost.
---
It really depends on your build and playstyle.
---
Mines been glitched like that for a while. Figured everyone else was like that as well
---
Oh sorry, i apparently forgot it is your private game and we others aren't even allowed to dream -.-
---
This game will always ditch out new store items alongside of new features and bug fixes because that is how they make money.
---
So let people say what kind of atomic shop content and/or dlc they would like to see. It has nothing to do with further upgrading the base game.
---
Sure thing
---
I leave mine in my stash box these days.  I don’t want to be cheesing cheap kills with the laser anymore.  They are broken af.  If somebody else wants to then fine but nobody is going to take you seriously if you’re using an explosive laser.  I believe they will be fixed; however, I’m not overly optimistic about it happening anytime soon.
---
Exactly. Everything is being nerfed because of all twelve pvpers around the world whining about being owned by each other badly. Well just stay on pvp servers and on those servers remove all legendary effects so you twelve fellas will be happily pvping each other,  stop ruining the PVE experience because of your shitty game style.
---
ah ha. thank you for the info.
---
Ayyyy yo, you got any plastic? Lol.
---
Huh.. that's why I always felt like that perk wasn't very helpful.
---
ty!
---
Isn’t this basically the same as serum recipes?  
---
After all, they are around 20K caps each  and if you have all of them, then you’ve spent a large chunk of caps.  
---
Personally, I would spend 100K caps just for a paint set for the inside of the brick wall set.    All I ask is that you let me paint my walls?  Is that so hard to ask?
---
Might have to log off your server and log on back on. Shouldn’t need that much but it worked for me when I had unlocked the backpack.
---
A more descriptive text perhaps?
---
And a picture preview where applicable. This can be done and would be totally awesome!
---
I’ve killed quite a few squatches and they can drop up to 3 star legendaries but they tend to be few and far between.
---
Did you read the plan or just buy the item
---
I learned my hard lesson with Mass Effect Andromeda. There was a time when all that extra stuff was worth it, especially to the big fans. But these days, it all just seems like a scam. 
---
Since I’ve stopped pre-ordering and buying games at launch, my bank account and my personal satisfaction with my life-choices have really been benefitting. I’d definitely recommend it.
---
How. You. can. Have. That. High. Damage?!?!?! Best I have ever had was 760 in fatman
---
I had a stretchy dead scorchbeast a few days ago. Kept spawning the corpse when I would fast travel. Everytime it got more and more stretchy until parts of it were consuming the screen.  
---
Was weird.
---
You reminded me that day I also lost the big stash of wood scraps I had just gone to collect (on foot) to Prickett's Fort. lol
---
No it just silently judges
---
See the above. You might need 1053.
---
Yeah they’re not really worth the ammo considering how many other places you can farm legendaries.
---
I paid 200 for Marsupial and Twisted Muscles, which is about as much as I wanted to pay. I shopped around a few days to get it. I've seen some folks out there selling serums for 900/ea and I guess if they can get it, good for them. Whenever I stock them, I sell for 200 as well.
---
That was my thought too, need to read the plan to unlock
---
Don’t remember but I know I unlocked them, went to the armor station, they weren’t there. Went to desktop, came back and i was in business.
---
I'd love stalking other players as a Wendigo
---
Serum have actual in-game effects. Nope.
---
These have to be useless. No in-game benefits or downsides... just pure "bling for the sake of bling". 
---
This is "spinners on a Yugo" style money flashing. This is "diamonds on every finger" kinda bling. This is "My old carpet was fine, but this one is made from the hides of the last 3 pandas on earth" kinda spending.
---
I use full power armor for the imposter and a Quad Cryolator usually 2-3 reloads and the melee builds have her down.
---
What in tarnation o\_O
---
Yup.  That's my assumption.  Apparently killing a one star ar 78 is haord guys.  Either that or they are so excited its "teh bloody" they dont even bother to look at the level.
---
Still, a little bitty voice inside me is saying "maybe he has an alt or a gf that occasionally plays or something"  😞
---
Not sure what you mean by that.
---
They took a single player game, made few significant modifications to it other than the map, and made it an online game.  It's not like they made a new multiplayer game with the FO theme, or made a new version of the Creation Engine with multiplayer capabilities.  They took old code, and adopted it to a new game style.
---
I'm *not* saying it wasn't a lot of work.  But it is definitely a kludge that was added to the FO4 base.  I'm just being honest (from my own perspective anyway).  I personally love the game, and passed 500 hours on it even though I started late.  But I'd much rather have seen a full remake of the engine to support proper multiplayer (and more modern graphics and features).  But I guess BGS didn't think it was worth the investment...so we have what we have.
---
Nah im at work.  I'll be on around 730 est tonight.  
---
PSN: Colossernaut
---
someone give me their explosive laser, so I can see for myself!
---
I’m lvl 48, so this makes me feel a little better. Thanks!
---
And the woodchucker one is also passive, but I think mostly I was stuck in fo3/4 thinking.
---
I am. Sneak rifleman. Vats and crits.
---
So it'd be better to put a red dot over night vision if using vats?
---
Band aid typically refers to a quick and temporary fix:
---
https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Band-Aid+solution
---
It's neither of those.
---
They ruined pvp in adventure already and people are still crying about survival server's, i have seen numerous posts . One post they were demanding changes in survival to cater to both playstyles because they wanted to take advantage of the added xp , one player i killed in survival actually said he didn't want to pvp he was only there for the xp boost then called me a griefer and numerous names i cant repeat here . Changes in this game are made for those who cry the loudest, its the wasteland for fucks sake. Stop crying!
---
I don’t know maybe it’s just me but I just let things go. A buddy of mine owed me 40 dollars and I tried to chase him down for a few months about it but he cut all contact with me in an attempt to duck paying me the 40 dollars. I tried to catch him for months but after a while I was just like fuck it and let it go because the stress and drama filling my life trying to find this guy was not worth the 40 bucks. I was circling my room furious about this shit. I just cut him out of my life and took it as a lesson never to lend anyone money. 40 dollars is not a large sum to me, i was only chasing him down based on principle. But there came a point where I just started feeling stupid about the amount of energy I invested into the pursuit. In the end, I figure I just lost 40 dollars but at least that grimy fuck I about of my life and will never try to mooch off me again.
---
They are pretty useful and often give decent weapons to scrap (and hopefully learn a mod). I usually wait until I have duplicate maps for a particular spot because you can dig up the same mound multiple times if you have the maps for it :)

I have mine for 500 caps and flipped them from 300. I talked to a group that gives price checks. They said it's around 300-500 caps each that trends on PC. But I'm not sure about the other platforms.
---
I was aiming for the armoured backpack as I’m gonna take off take off the Ironclad perk too.
---
I always want to play as a ghoul. I'm in radiation so often it feels weird that I'm not one.
---
Yep, I was aiming for the armoured backpack as I’m gonna take off take off the Ironclad perk too.
---
You would of killed the lower level and Mr. 110 would have 1 shot you at least that was the plan.
---
Yeah I've done a run once with a few duplicates. But was not impressed with anything I got
---
Appreciate that, I read the plans, was unable to build the Stash box and logged of for the day. Tried next day still same.
---
It'll always either be accidentally filled with stuff someone didn't mean to put in it or it'll be filled with fertilizer or single action revolver ivory grip plans.
---
Plus it'll pretty much completely kill team invites, if they're not dead already.
---
*servers
---
And another one
---
thats right, i own the game
---
Hells yes to shields. 
---
I want to sword &amp; board in power armour, use it with 1 handed weapons of any kind!
---
I want the power fist to be usable with power armour!
---
I'd love throwing weapons that are actually viable!
---
Yes I did read the plans, logged off sever, tried new day still not able to build
---
Hey you, you’re finally awake
---
It’s worth to do the events, encryptid and free range because they have some rare exclusive drops but I wouldn’t hit squatches up if I just wanted the legendary item.
---
I'll keep that in mind for this online game, thanks '-'
---
Where do you find MoleMama?
---
Are you looking at the right stash? I think one was atomic shop and one is a quest reward from the machine
---
I will put this and send them again. Thanks for it bro

My gal didn’t seem quite as into it.

There is a bunch of us who have been requesting something similar. We want Responder Radio as kinda the opposite of Hunter/hunted that if we're listening, we get a notification if nearby players use the Get Help Option and you can fast travel to them free at the cost of a stimpack
---
If this happens we need to be able to make our robots fight other peoples.
---
The mods have mentioned that they would but usually players post them before they get a chance and I guess they’ve made a point not to stickie player posts - they’re not that hard to find on here tho because as soon as they’re up someone here posts them and it becomes a popular post pretty fast
---
Well now that's something I hadn't thought of I will have to go back and see.
---
😳 damn, sorry to hear that! Hopefully someone else offers a better fix action or it’s fixed soon on its own.
---
Have met some really cool folks, though I rarely group because of how I play.  I just love wandering around and doing whatever strikes me at the time.  Most nights I have a rough plan that lasts 10 minutes before I’ve wandered off on an adventure of my own.  5 characters ranging from level 100 to 150.
---
Also the world they built is really easy to miss stuff.  I just found a waterfall near a wrecked plane in the mire.  800+ hours and I have somehow never noticed this.  Built a camp there,  approached from a different direction and saw a lead node.  Now I have to decide if I inch it over a bit or let it taunt me forever, or until I find another cool spot (only 2/5 characters have “never move” camps).
---
Simply put, it just scratches an itch.
---
Man, that's harsh. You also forgot players, which just waits till SBQ has 1% HP, do one shot to mark it, loot it and ggbb
---
**Specifically 5/18ths of the white power armor**
---
You gotta Zillow that shit before you put down roots.
---
Oh if that's the case, that might be an issue - my base is nestled between two enemy spawns. I could probably remove them and do a manual patrol...
---
Oh you do? That's fantastic! I would really appreciate if you could implement playable ghouls then :-) oh oh oh and a raider faction!
---
Ignore them... their mom didn’t get the right flavor hot pocket at the store and they’re mad...
---
Mine went from 47 to 2.  It was as good as a minigun but oh so much more satisfying.
---
no, its a pioneer scout quest in Robco factory.
---
You have to have level 3 animal friend - with rank one of the card you can only “pacify” - not tame.
---
And people actually try to defend this shit...
---
No, I would've went for the 110 first. They were using a gatling gun which wasn't explosive. I have a explosive light machine gun and I assume you know how fast it fires :D  
---
Meanwhile the level 36 would have either done nothing with the crossbow or switch to something else if they were smart.
---
Lol yeah the devs also sew the bags. This is even dumber than the people who say updating the atom shop is taking manpower away from fixing the bugs
---
I haven't actually done any survival - do you just select either Adventure or Survival when you load up, and remain free to swap your characters between the two when you start the session?
---
Join people you know... it ain’t worth the atoms to join randoms looking to PvP...
---
&gt; if you're gonna serve me piss, at least make it warm.
---
If I can't use this phrase at work at least 10 times this week, I do not unlock the achievement.
---
People would stay in passive mode, keep it behind a room with no doors or way into it without breaking the walls down which you wouldn't be able to do in that circumstance.
---
They should make it either an explosive golf ball grenade you can hit with the golf club exclusively! That way if you bogey you suffer the consequence. 
---
Or if they made it a mini game like a hoard of scorched cane at you while you were driving and had to hit them to kill them xD
---
I too was mad for the same reason but I manged to leave it
---
A pretty funny quest.  I found it the other day and was pleasantly surprised.
---
I imagine bog and more give best rewards. Forest maps prob give you piles of ivory grip plans
---
Game mechanics covered a lot of that
---
How do people get so many caps? I struggle to keep about 4k at any time. Fast traveling and occasionally buying something from a player vender constantly keeps be broke.
---
Perhaps... it's time to just shelve this explosive silliness altogether.
---
I had a Stretchy Dead Scorched yesterday. He didn't last long though, he mutated into Slingshot Dead Scorched and flew away as if trying to catch wherever his head was stuck.
---
My Silenced .50 cal TSE hunting rifle.   Love sneaking and sniping from a distance.  
---
I also have a furious double barrel.  Recently, I was at a nuked White Springs and was sharing kills.   I had the enforcer perk up.  I lead about 25 glowing ghouls out of the golf course building and from the cottages on the side south out of the Nuke zone to other players that I was helping.  I had them all hobbled.   Just a mass of them limping, trying to catch me...  That was soooo much fun...  you know that you’re at the top of your game when you can do that and not kill one of them...
---
But for real damage, it has to be my Zealots .50 cal explosive machine gun.   I also have a troubleshooter version for robots.  There is nothing like blasting away and watching scortched get mowed down.
---
Oh nice, where is the Robco factory?
---
I wasn't seriously suggesting they weren't a large studio, just poking fun at the usual comments about how they do no wrong because making the Witcher 3 apparently gives you a pass to treat your employees like garbage. "Hidden indie gen the Witcher 3" is a pretty common joke in certain subs because of how often it gets shoehorned into gaming discussions. 
---
That's really interesting to know they're bigger than BGS. I didn't think either were as big as Ubisoft or EA but wouldn't have expected BGS to be smaller.
---
It's up to you to pay attention to youtubers and gaming media in general or not.  I find that most youtube gaming content is pointless clickbait and there's a very samey, copycat sort of vibe where everyone gloms on to the same negative viewpoints.    
---
98% of youtube gaming content is bashing ea, activision, the epic game store, or microtransations in general.  That's pretty much every youtube video these days so what's the point of listening to another rant on teh exact same thing?  I tuned out a long time ago.
---
^THIS^
---
I can make some more with alts if it's satisfying u :)
---
Last time this was tossed around, someone put together this list which wouldn't require armor/outfit reworks:
---
* **Adrenal Reaction:** Increasing amounts of steam coming off your character as the mutation's effect increases.
---
* **Bird Bones:** Character body reshaped to the ultra skinny setting, your face looks like Dee.
---
* **Carnivore:** Your character wears a blood-stained bib at all times.
---
* **Chameleon:** You got Mystique skin now, so congrats: you just blued yourself.
---
* **Eagle Eyes:** Eye size increased by 300%. You anime now.
---
* **Egg Head:** Skull is now shaped like an egg.
---
* **Electrically Charged:** Periodic small arcs of lightning coming off your character.
---
* **Empath:** Your character has little cartoon hearts emanating off of them. Gross.
---
* **Grounded:** Your character is trailing little skin-colored appendages that drag on the floor.
---
* **Healing Factor:** You got Wolverine hair and cannot change your hair style. Snikt.
---
* **Herbivore:** Your teeth are stained green.
---
* **Herd Mentality:** Your character now has little horns like a bovine. Hope you're happy.
---
* **Marsupial:** Your character has prominent buck teeth, whiskers, and an idiotic expression frozen on their face.
---
* **Plague Walker:** There's a green miasma spreading outward from your character.
---
* **Scaly Skin:** Your skin is scaly. Shocking, I know.
---
* **Speed Demon:** Your character moves faster, which is kind of the point of the mutation.
---
* **Talons: Your character has freakishly long fingers. Unarmed attack animation changed to clawing.
---
* **Twisted muscles:** Add animation jitter and noise to character animation.
---
* **Unstoppable Isotope:** Your character gives off a blueish glow, like Cherenkov radiation.
---
Me too. 
---
Some people treat this shit like a job, man. I spend 15 minutes trying to find the perfect place for a statue, and rearranging the type on my vending machines.
---
Hey dumb question - I haven't played for a few months, and I'm getting back into it.
---
I recall previously that you could make the Welcome Mat spawn point item in public workshops, but not in your own base. 
---
Is this the case or can you make welcome mats at base now?
---
yeah, character appearance options is the way to go. I’d like it to be optional.
---
Sure, that’s a great ideal. It would be very happy if that’s how every transaction would go. Unfortunately in the real world, you sometimes get ripped off, swindled, cheated, and/or robbed. 
---
Especially with these “special-edition pre-order now” nonsense with games. If you keep falling for the shell game, you should stop playing. Not keep complaining about how you “should” get something. 
---
Ever buy anything off wish.com? Same concept at work here.
---
I love when I FT and they come dropping from the sky on top of me like a piano in a 1950's cartoon.
---
I started playing FO4 again after I put about 100 hours into FO76..  
---
I love FO76, but there's totally something appealing about actual humans being around. It was a delight to murder the shit out of raiders... lol.  
---
But my honest opinion on FO76's story, is that it's not bad, but it feels like you're being told a much greater story through holotape than you're actually playing out.  
---
The stories told through holotapes and the robot NPC's about what happened before your arrival sounds much more interesting than what we're living through. I get that the scorch plague came and fucked things up, but all of the players are apparently immune to it, so why can't some other NPC humans be immune as well?    
---
They don't even have to be immune, just maybe they're not all infected before we ever meet them.   
---
I don't think there would be more players because of human NPC's, but I think it'd make for a bit more compelling story. We wouldn't just be told that what we're doing is great by people who are already dead, we could literally be helping people stay alive.  
---
They've had no problem in past fallout games making certain NPC's non-killable, so I don't know why they chose the route they did. If it's from a story perspective, I get it, except for all the immune players to the scorched plague. If they did it from a technical standpoint.. the only thing that I can think of would be an immortal NPC could kill anything that attacked it, which might be an issue. You could lure tough enemies to them and just let them kill the enemy for you. Maybe that's why, but it's still a little strange.  
---
The world feels a bit more alive after the player vending update, but it still doesn't feel as alive as past games have. You don't have much to fight for. You fight for everyone who died, but, they're already dead.. so it's just revenge I guess.   
---
Not like all the nukes would leave it a hospitable environment.
---
The only shit stains I have noticed are people who happen to be under lvl 100 with TSE weaponry. So far the only people who have ever fucked with me and tried to ruin my day in workshops and around the wasteland are people with those, and they run in pairs to keep their bounty.
---
Some people just want to help others and get rid of the extra weight from stash. If you're max caps, you don't care much for selling and gain.
---
Maybe they wanted to give it away.
---
I keep getting invited. But generally at parties my "bitch switch" doesn't get flipped on.
---
Well, it's a matter of perspective I guess.
---
Some people don't really care for those things.
---
A vendor bot that costs 25k caps per limb until you have it completely assembled.
---
this happen to me last night i was farming lead i had something like 150 on me and i got killed by a assaultron dominator ( which are bullshit if you are not wearing a power armor) and the game crashed when i was respawning
---
The handmade is the worst weapon you could use for Vats builds. Semi auto is 33 AP per shot. The combat rifle only costs 26 AP per shot. I just covered this in a recent article. You can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bvmedb/testing_action_point_costs_of_various_weapons_and/).
---
If you want to make it work, I suggest going fully automatic, red dot sight, aligned mods, and a quick eject magazine. The anti armor ones seem to increase AP costs like scopes do. I suspect scopes, like the night vision one, increase AP costs by around 30% whereas red dot decreases by about 15%.
---
Lol yup, exactly. It got kind of irritating when I FT to my camp and it dropped on all my work benches. That's when I had to switch servers because I couldn't even get a prompt from a workbench, since by that point it was stretched out and taking up all the space.
---
That would be a perfect world
---
Same! Just haven’t seen anything I needed bad enough. Or if I want it I use the atoms I’ve earned in game. Not really anything that has justified spending real money.
---
Or a bladed power fist, could be master shredder. Like realistically you wouldnt run around with a gauntlet. But if you were in a machine that made you a walking tank, realistically it makes since that someone would run around punching people. And these throwing weapons we currently have are pitiful.
---
that was quick :)
---
I gotta say no to this. Lol 😂 just my opinion tho
---
Because they're into this for the game of it, and not for the make-believe bank account.
---
They're not dumb. They enjoy the game differently than you do. Some of us like to help other players out, it's what we find fun.
---
Or even an exchange for ammo machine. Would love to trade shotgun shells for 5.56 ammo
---
Yes you can use both perks. I don't know if it's intended or a bug.
---
I think this was patched maybe a month ago?
---
They did add that "some would slightly change your appearance"
---
Yeppers
---
I have 5 trophies I never got, to include the first two but I guess I’ll just save that for my next character.
---
Hey tararynieyn maybe we should meet up too?
---
They still pop up every now and then
---
I didn;t even know they were down.. was it just general server maintenance?
---
No it wasn't patched
---
It would be nice change to help me figure out why a lvl 68 scorch in rags attacking me with a rusty tambourine is called a conqueror. 
---
Would be way better if we found high-end military/BOS/Enclave/Fire-Breather scorched with actual armor and weapons as the high-level ones. 
---
I mean a scorched in PA wielding a Gatling plasma, yeah I might understand why that is a scorched Conqueror or scorched leader.
---
If you know how to farm legendary items, then roll them for better items, you can have items in your store with $5-$10k caps in no time. Farm horde events and AWOL events. Scrip those legendaries, then try to roll armor or weapons that fetch a high price.
---
You can also LFG Scorch Beast Queen events and farm her and get high price plans and stable flux from her to sell.
---
You’ll be max caps in no time flat.
---
Thx!
---
The rules change so often.. I'm loosing track of it.. What are the latest rules to camps?
---
I'd be ok with the option of it getting unlocked in the character appearance changer, that way it would just work like adding scars or changing skin tone. Keep it within the system present but add a little flare.
---
I've bought them once in the past, and still have most of them.
---
I'm surprised it's taking them so long to add more backpacks, considering that we've seen that image where they had a couple dozen sketched out.
---
Well at least they’re doing something there. Thanks for the info.
---
Fair enough but the other problem with 25% rof is some guns benefit from this way more than others.  A semi automatic laser rifle with low ROF isn't really gamed drastically by 25% rof boost, but an automatic one with high rof is much better with that 25% bonus.    
---
Just fix the bug so explosive works on energy weapons like everything else and it's problem solved.
---
That Zealot's Wood right arm will be a great loss :(
---
Great idea!
---
As is, camps are only destructible by those you are actively in PvP with at the time, you have to shoot back basically, and I think even that resets on death
---
Yep. I regularly price stuff to zero to lighten stash, help other players. I used to leave stuff like that in train station suitcases, but this saves me a trip.
---
Tested myself recently, it does  NOT anymore.
---
If you want to rebuild your mutations less that one I can help.. I have all the recipes if you have your needed items.
---
I'm in. When and were?
---
Damn, thanks everyone!
---
Yeah that would be awesome, having scaly skin or green boils as an option in the scars section sounds great
---
It’s false advertising. If you market a product to include a bag, you need to deliver on that if someone bought the product. Technically whoever didn’t get their bag could take Bethesda or whoever to court after awhile if they never receive it. I also don’t agree with people buying that edition of the game and gave my friend shit for it when he bought that version as well, but regardless, they need to get everything they paid for.
---
Think he have a deal then lol
---
&gt; Civil
---
hey, wheres the closest vendor from philippe battlefield?
---
Having a multiplayer beta "soon"
---
I don't know why game devs don't use [Uservoice ](https://www.uservoice.com/) to track feedback .. MS uses it for Teams and it's really helpful because you don't have to sort through a bunch of threads to find suggestions - it finds them for you and lets you easily upvote ones you agree with.
---
PS Bethesda for the love of GOD update the game interface so that ANY time you can buy something, it shows you a) the picture of the item, b) the statistics of said item, and c) the ingredients required to craft said item.
---
I'm not sure if they work at workshops but they most definitely dont work at CAMPs. This is to stop people from spawning you in a room of flamethrowers, etc.
---
Very nice idea but I doubt it since there is no $$$ involved. Too much work for them for not even cash.
---
Might have full rifle man or heavy gun (not sure which the harpoon gun falls under) but my TSE Dragon clears 800 and does 3.5x when I’m sneak shot at night + 30% more if I use a critical.
---
It does, Just tested now.
---
Aurvival mode?nd I'm glad for it on Adenture.  Can bases be destroyed over on S
---
While I get the impression that the creative direction of the game rules out playable ghouls, I don't actually think they'd be THAT hard to implement in a purely aesthetic sense. They already have a variety of FO4 ghoul features/colors/etc. and the models are clearly made to accommodate in-game clothing.
---
I think that'd be far easier than working within their current UI (which is soooo limiting augh) to show a preview of plans...many items don't make sense or unlock multiple. A description on mods would be highly appreciated though. @\_@
---
Simple reply.. Ya! pretty kool feature if it was there.
---
But If you got a mic. it helps to talk to others too. I'm always selling mutations. I think I might have 7 marsupial in there right now, I try to have one of each all the time...
---
Huh...  any clue why you are getting picked on?  I am level 94, xb1, don't vend/usually sneak - so I am not terribly visible.  I also run with pacifist on.  Dunno if people just don't see me, are wary of me, or I'm just lucky.
---
Honestly, if some one really started something, I'd just grab whatever key loot I don't want to miss (e.g. legendary corpse) and jump servers.  Not the game I want to play griefers, if I did...  I'd be in survival.
---
Did the nvidia thing but the Screen Settings &gt; Graphics settings seem to be nowhere in Win 8.1 :(
---
Berkely Station, Southeast of Berkely Springs.
---
(Sure I spelt that wrong.)
---
Wait...wait...wait a minute!!!! I have over 1,000 hours and I didn't even think of this... My Suppresor empath is gonna be a healing salve, melon eating party healing machine!!! Thanks!
---
That's what I've been doing, I still crash every time.
---
also sell 5.56 all the time always for 1 cap per..
---
this is about all I make and I don't even use  it...
---
The whitesprings plans already are reletively all in one place, and there is no RNG to them.
---
me with the 3 pylon action... welcome
---
This just made me think of a new gun that's like a miniature broadsider that shoots golfballs. I approve.
---
Dunno, I don't shoot at people and don't intend to start.
---
So was he just roleplaying the guy from borderlands? "The faaace!  Shoot me in the faaaace!"
---
Now that makes me wish I had mic enabled.  Woulda been hilarious.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I got my edition at Christmas and have Bethesda my slip in January
---
Don’t sweat it. 
---
Ballistic weapons is one of my hoppy’s
---
Prepare go be banned by very flawed auto banning bot.
---
Nice idea, but as someone who has played their fair share of MMOs and quasi-MMOs:
---
#Fuck. No.
---
Anytime you introduce ultra rare, high-cost, high-status items that can be bought via a tradeable in-game currency, you create a fertile breeding ground for farmers and a secondary market where in-game currency is traded for real money. NOTE: Farmers already exist. I'm aware. But introducing caps-purchasable Atom shop items would make them orders of magnitude *worse.*
---
Alright, but what's so bad about more farmers? The thing about farmers is that they have no interest in playing the game as intended and a real incentive to break the game in every way possible through bots, exploits, hacks, etc. An influx of farmers will force Bethesda to devote excessive resources to mitigating the damage they are inflicting on the game's economy, taking money away from developing more game content.
---
This would be a fucking awful way to implement cap sinks.
---
So, like gold plated pottery, faberge diamond encrusted death claw eggs, crystal chandeliers, and white marble flooring.
---
I thought that at first but they had hundreds of black titanium for 0 and then 1/4 of the amount of cork for 3
---
you should come check out my camp i live right next to you
---
This just happened to me last week. I had a  100 levels higher, one shot me while I was in passive mode. Took everything I dropped, which was everything I had just farmed to build the workshop up. Then I could hear him start shooting all the resource extractors out. I come back because my I respected closer to the workshop than my camp, because my camp is directly across the street. So I walk up to him and said, çHey you didn't have to do that, I just take workshops and leave everything unlocked so everyone can use it. He 1 shots me again. So I thought, "OK maybe he's wanting to take the work shop, but in a weird way. He shot out the rest of the resource extractors, the verdibot that started attacking him and then all the gun turrets. After all that, he left the server. I looked up his name and found some YouTube videos of him griefing other players back in March, before the update to camp damage or whatever it was they did.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Personally I’d like to get quest from an actual person npc then it be tapes.
---
Yes! Do it!
---
well, I know it's not a reroll per se
---
but if you want to reroll traits for a given weapon this would cost far more than the few scrips you suggest.
---
I dont know the exact count but, let say we can have 20 different weapons. So we have 1/20 chance to get the specific weapon you want (just the weapon, not the traits). Statistically speaking this means you need to spend at least 2000 scrips to get it.
---
If you want to reroll trait for that weapon, this probably should cost at least  2000 scrips too, because the weapon type is garanteed in the new roll.
---
More dollars than sense is the phrase you are looking for :P
---
I saw you but I assumed it was a trap so I just went shopping and bailed. Next time I promise to participate. Onecoolghoul.
---
When I saw this the other day I thought to email Bethesda for an update on mine and got the same email back. Def has me hopeful. 🙂
---
Awesome bacon possom
---
Then it's the (Y) button then if your using a controller on PC. I use the same thing that's why I know
---
Oh sure. I do those mostly for fun.
---
You on PC? I could always give you some if you are desperate. I find that doing a Nuke Bunker and farming the robot spawns is the first area is great (no pesky assualtrons) robots will drop either steel, lead, or aluminum scrap.
---
At the southern end of the Mire, east of the freeway, across from the General's Steakhouse.
---
It's also one of the endpoints for the monorail.
---
I find it interesting that being downvoted for asking a question and expressing thanks. Cool.
---
Firing those 40mm gets expensive quickly. Back when I experimented with heavy weapons I would bank my 40mm until I had a few hundred, then craft some mini nukes, grab my 3* auto launcher and Daisycutter and have some fun for a few hours.
---
With the new vendors and easier ways to find 40mm and trade away the stuff you don’t need because you’re only firing explosives, maybe it could work now, at least economically. Pretty sure some mobs have natural explosive resistance.
---
Also works on the pipe pistol just add the stock.
---
I was going to say "why the atom shop" but I get it... you can't dupe atom shop stuff because you can't trade it.
---
You think if someone were to make the exact bag out of leather would people buy the bag, perhaps with a nice reenforced bottom in a nice antique brown ? Thinking I could literally make this for fun and giggles to sell
---
DTS?
---
I had a similar problem last night with the ghouls at whitespring. I found if I went back and checked the bodies again a minute or two later the legendary appeared in the ghoul's inventory.
---
I both play and get angry what do i win?
---
Ah
---
Wanted to make sure it wasn't a bug since I had things set at 1 cap...
---
Was thinking it might have been some bug
---
I can SOOO see that guy now standing on that ledge...
---
"...ok, thanks...."
---
also the guy that loved the flames....
---
I'm imagining something more elaborate/stupid. Like Mr. Handy's fly low to scorch the tips of the grass blades with its jet. Then a team of protectrons come along with green paint while an assaultron looks on disdainfully at the entire thing.
---
Let’s not make this political Terry
---
If they're not atom shop they'll end up duped and worthless.
---
Don't make one with fo 76 logo. That will be shame for the people who will take it outside
---
I stumbled across a TSE LMG in a vending machine. It rips. Its too good. Nothing survives. Shame i only use it for special occasions cause the .308 ammo suxxx. Ive got super duper, ammosmith, camp at a lead node, and i still have trouble with ammo :(
---
I always played battlefield 4 as a medic. I'd get a few kills but always be near the top of the score board as I was constantly reviving and healing. I stopped playing partly through annoyance that I'd die myself and be like... oh good! There's another medic right there! He will revive me. Yeah. Any second now. He probably hasn't seen me. I mean he is crouching over my dying body while firing so... should see me. Yeah the timer is really running out now.
---
This would slowly get more annoyed while there were 3 medics around me doing  nothing while I died.
---
That happens to me too sometimes
---
What if somebody makes a room with a keypad that has a pressure plate inside to open the door so nobody can get in
---
What are the changes to passive mode? I can't find anything about it being changed.
---
I played 76 in beta and refunded because the combat felt so *delayed* and none of the mobs had any kind of reactions to being shot.
---
I've kept an eye on the game though because I'm a huge Fallout fan, and I'm thinking it might be time to try it out again now that there's a good sale (on Amazon).
---
Craftable tacos?
---
Is this event combo a thing now? On PC, seems every SBQ is followed up with an Imposter. Are people just trolling hoping others forget to stash their flux and they can grab their death bag? Or just that there are a lot of high level players geared up and ready from the SBQ to take down the imposter?
---
Yesterday a level 150 walked up to me and just gave my stupid level ten ass about a hundred pounds of copper, adhesive, aluminum, and circuits.  
---
people are super nice in this game which is one of the reasons i came back to it after being disappointed with it on release.
---
In adventure mode I think this kind of stuff is pretty funny. I guess if the dude is waiting there to take your junk it’s less funny, but really there isn’t any harm in a little pratfalling every so often. I had a dude log out while I was shopping his machines and I couldn’t figure out how I died and then the “oh, lol” moment hit me.
---
Dissappearing Turret Syndrome.
---
Another reason it needs to be easier to find fights.
---
Yup, I’ll never afford to play there in real life so at least let me play virtually!
---
I had the idea of making it so if you dropped 1000 caps at the bot stop you could have a mr handy follow you around. Nothing fancy, just something to living things up that youd have to buy every time you wanted to use one.
---
bllllllaaaahhh.. Showing the nuke vomit emote
---
Fun fact, there are re-rolls. Take your unwanted 3* weapon, scrip it for 40, and pay 60 more for your re-roll. Voila!
---
Yeah they’re fun events, encryptid is crazy
---
Now they just slide on the ground on plank position, which is sometimes really terrifying.
---
Im on PS4 if anyone has a copy to sell.
---
I've never even heard of that
---
Lol. Or maybe four Mr Handy Bots are holding an Assaultron upside down by the ankles while it spins it’s blade.
---
sounds good to me.  I'd also like to see some way to advertise crafting services (shielded under armors, calibrated shocks, jetpacks, etc).
---
What exactly am I spending money on that’s going to get me an ideal 3* weapon?
---
Did by accident. Easy Peasy.
---
May I offer you 387 eyebombs in this trying time?
---
Ive had the same issue on PC. I went to change a Tag item on some basic resource i was low on and noticed it.
---
I’ve been slowly rising to above foundations if I don’t try to move after spawning. 
---
Hopefully that’s the fix going forward if they can’t get you to spawn outside of the CAMP.
---
So a final if 1000... but! + 200...
---
Funny when the "Improved Repair Kits" are more desirable than the "drops"
---
Same. I keep gaining more and more &lt;10% charged cores. I never reload manually and only use the gun for SBQ. It's really fun when the game decides to actually use them and I get 1 sec of fire for 10 secs of reload animation.
---
I find it interesting that the silhouette matches the Overseer's [hair](https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fallout76_RoadMap_2018_02-21_FINAL.png) in the [trophy/achievements](https://i.psnprofiles.com/games/2bd778/trophies/18L0f25a1.png). As well as the header describing it as a new "main" quest addition.
---
Additionally, the last badge image looks like a sentry bot in the background. Unless it's a mini version right next to him.
---
Go down the the door and search the mat in front of . Keys are under the mat.
---
Pipe bolt action does.
---
Revolver never has
---
I always had stretchy mongrel dogs and once had a stretchy scorchbeat
---
Lmao I finally broke 1000 caps a couple days ago. While everyone else I know is close to max or did hit max.
---
I just put a chair facing where players get stuck in my camp and most have been smart enough to use it to get out.
---
&gt; 3 of those from the same person.

Hey, that's me! I tried limiting my posts to every couple days (and I haven't posted one in a week), but it does look kind of spammy since no one else is posting. The sub has potential, it just needs more exposure than 232 subscribers can provide.
---
Yes 25% ROF is good on all automatics - even ballistics, and much crappier on semi-autos, and I have no idea what they do for a single shot but they do appear on them too.
---
I'v been pretty lucky when it comes to adventure mode and griefers.  I only had one bad experience on the top of  my head.  
---
Person A will invite you to a party, than he will agro his friends outside of the party.  Since your in the party, you will automatically be agroed to his friend as well.  Than his friend will go and start destroying your camp.  Its one of the new things kids are doing atm, or maybe it got patched somehow not sure.  
---
Anyway, It sucks cause when my buddies aren't playing and I'm alone, I give random invites to people when I'm nearby or at the same event as them.  Just to help out my mutations and certain perk cards + sharing perks.   Now I realize why a lot of people I give invites to deny them.
---
I said this a lot, the pve aspect of this game and teaming up with friends is really good, so I'm going to continue to play the game that way and leave my pvp fix for other games.
---
The bridge right before Summerville is probably the best spot you’re looking for or a smaller bridge right before Morgantown
---
Hahahaha not wrong lmao
---
Ugh no ty... I've played eso for nearly 4 years I'm sick of that shit. I'm a 30yr old mum of 3 boys I just want to chill XD
---
Crap. Maybe this is my problem too. 15% of my budget is 'stored' but I only have 5 blackberries stored and that's it. I had some turrets disappear back in the beta. My camp is finally perfect and I really don't want to have to do what you did...
---
You tested a revolver?
---
I mean I gave them time and then kill them
---
Nah I could just make a bag that looks the same but no logo
---
Yup, I’ve seen this a few times. I’m really impressed with some of these CAMPS that go all out for customer satisfaction!
---
Take up an addiction or something. I spend all my money on mentats and beer.
---
I tried that - the mat wasn't even searchable for me.
---
I don’t always die during the event but when I do it’s because 30 eye bombs blew up directly behind me
---
Use small letters are make a sign
---
Um... Yea, that's what I said lol.
---
Well this gave me a time to rebuild my house to me more Vendor compliant as my old house was retrofitted to be vendor compliant.
---
You can easily fake what gun you’re going to attack with and switch it out in a heartbeat for the deadly one. It’s callled battle strategy.
---
I'm glad to know there's somewhere out there that would kill me on sight for my points! I would definitely return the favor. ;)
---
Because it's a joke weapon just like the drill. I don't believe it's intended to use as a weapon to fight with but rather flex with. Like Dan from Street Fighter or Tachanka on R6 Siege.
---
I would absolutely LOVE to see Bethesda do this on stream. The dog keeps refusing to run the last stretch nomatter what from any direction these last 2 times it's been around and I keep having to murder it and drag it there. [https://streamable.com/lj0cz](https://streamable.com/lj0cz)
---
I get that but by the time they'd switch my weapon would have killed them first, you see.
---
As long as you burst fire it shouldn't bug out...  try like 3-5 shot bursts.
---
Lmaoooo I like the rush the adrenaline
---
I wish they did the same for the damn mothman and Flatwoods monster so we can complete challenges .. these guys however are just most OP and a waste of time
---
I would get every mutation of this was a thing
---
Same  here!
---
I guess. I think it goes for melee in general. But you don’t have to play that way.
---
I like servees better!
---
Did a duper just out himself?
---
isaac is that you
---
&gt;keep dweedle dee and his friends alive
---
Ya.. all that power and this is what they had for launching the most powerful weapon in their world? no wonder they lost!!
---
You realize that duping isnt how you got the monster mask right?
---
I remember this. They said mutations would alter appearance but I guess that was forgotten about in the mess of the launch.
---
No. No no no no no no. No. No.
---
I love how your characters always yell "SNIIIIPEEEER!!" after you took that 308 Lapua Magnum to the dome.
---
Well we can do this....we have a trade function now!
---
Whats needed is a trade zone.
---
Isnt is something weird like 7 holes?  I remember reading notes about how the designer let his son do it, who hated the idea of being a course architect, and screwed it up along with building houses on the course.
---
So glad you posted this.  I've been having a hard time getting my badges, and was saving up for this particular recipe.  Would have been seriously ticked off to find this out after dropping 8 badges on it!
---
Hmm my buzzblade seems unaffected?
---
Not really. I got my serum recipies for 1k a piece. Bought the entire lot and I wasn't even level 50 yet
---
The old one awakens
---
Camps have been really buggy since player vending. Try logging off and hopping back in after you read the plan.
---
I think drinking bioluminescent fluid should make us glow for a bit.
---
Honestly i kinda just want it to be a hard reboot of the timeline where not every member of every faction is dead already. 
---
its kinda ridiculous that literally every single person and non feral ghoul in the entire region has been killed. 
---
like their should be a few holdouts in fortified positions, so like Charleston Fire Department, The Top of The World, Whitesprings Bunker, and at least one Brotherhood outpost should still be populated.
---
5 months later...
---
Just commenting my thanks for this post. I'm looking for a steady supply of Whiskey in addition to brewing it myself for crafting Grape Mentats.
---
Much appreciated.
---
+karma
---
Manufacturing lead times are both real and a bitch. 
---
I would be amazed if we had these in hand before the year is up.
---
same. Just saw this and the $$$ went off in my head.
---
Maybe you can check out mine, are you on xbox?
---
Shared Stash please that I can access between my different characters.
---
Best with a buddy.
---
PC Farplace
---
let's nuke!
---
I play daily, I’ve never come across that.  XBOX for reference.
---
Yeah, I’m over near Flatwoods right now and I’ll sometimes fill up spare vending slots with 38 and 10mm ammo for free for any low levels wandering by. I’m not using either of those ammo sizes right now but I can’t help picking it up when I find it, so I end up with a lot of it.
---
I usually drop 1 raw cloth and fertilizer give them a thumbs up and walk away...
---
My supply drop notes multiply if I put them in the vendor machine, then try to withdraw them. It's visual though, resets at server hop.
---
Kinda stuck with a spot taken up by supply drops now though.
---
This doesn't make any sense to me. You do realize that "offline storage" as you describe is inherently impossible in an online cloud-based multiplayer game?
---
You're literally asking that they implement a way to store your gear as physical files on your PC or Console; sitting there for anyone with any hacking experience to turn the item IDs and amounts from say (20) aluminum scrap to (999) TSE handmade rifles. This is a terrible idea from a technical standpoint.
---
You can join our discord where we do just that.
---
I needed some little over 500 atoms for that cool outfit from last patch. I was about to buy some atoms, but after spending hour trying to get server with cave crickets at unncany cavers, I chosed not to give bethesda more money, until they stop forcing us, to buy atoms, with imposible daily challenges.
---
FOnline was a series of online "mods" for fallout 2. They ran on a different engine but used many assets from fallout 2. I remember starting with FOnline 2238, but many sessions have come and gone since then. FOnline 2 and reloaded are the most popular ones nowadays I believe
---
Seems to be whitesprings but there is a risk involved there....
---
It is not as dependent on the location, but savage divide/near whitesprings seems popular. It depends more on the content of the shop in my opinion.
---
Shut up comrade
---
It's the whole point of a quad automatic tesla rifle though. I want to open fire and not stop until they're all piles of ash. If i wanted to burst fire, I'd have gotten a furious or junkie's instead
---
Why would armor our outfits be effected by radioactive genetic mutations? They have no genetics!
---
Got a pre-nerf Explosive Gatling Laser.
---
Just the fact that they're impossible to loot now makes it kinda cool.
---
Along this same track i would like us to be able to set up a generic faction vendor at our camps of the factions we are in good with just to save me the three minute walk down the mountain to get to whitespring station whenever i want to sell my collection of thirty hunting rifles.
---
I know - but between the choice of burst firing or not using it at all, I'm going to just improvise for now.  Even burst firing the quad makes all the difference, I have a Bloodied one as well on a different toon, and find myself constantly reloading on him at the most inconvenient of times.
---
Personally I think they should be more than slightly. Marsupial should remove you ability to wear nonncustom leg armor because your whole leg structure has changed. Same with egghead and helmets.
---
These mutations should absolutely be reflected on the character. There needs to be real consequences for mutating like crazy.
---
Also mutant slayer weapons should apply the bonus damage against players that are mutated.
---
The inspectors will be by later to check for compliance....
---
Well hook a guy up then.
---
GF and I encountered a level 100 2star in a nuke zone collecting violet flux.  Bastard killed a three star supermutant and his 3 friends before we could get to them.  He dropped diddley but took a ridiculous amount of bullets to put down.  It was however breathtaking to see one in the wild as it was lol
---
Really glad the sheepsquatch isnt a pushover.  I would like to see them bump the spawn and difficulty on the other cryptids though too.  Flatwoods monster and Mothmen are too rare imho and a joke once you engage them.
---
how do u not get rid of mutations when you take rad x and stuff
---
lvl 10 here
---
That's for one of the daily camera challenges right? 😜
---
Unless there's some hidden benefit I'm unaware of, demo expert only increase the damage of grenades, mines, and weapons with the explosive perk. 
---
The only energy weapons that you benefit are the legacy explosive guns, but I've never actually checked. When I get home I'll test it with my exploding cryolator and report back.
---
I think people missed the point
---
Ooohhh, neat.
---
Sounds like you got hit by a server restart due to issues and not an actual update. this come back up as soon as they restart but my guess it will have a new ID therefore it's not identifiable to you.
---
I have been looking for that dress for hours where are the plans?
---
Tesla Cannon &amp; Chinese Assault Rifle.
---
If u have a tail from the marsupial mutation, or bigger legs. It would effect the outfit
---
Bought the plans from a player vendor.
---
Get the starched genes perk
---
They add good stuff in for a week then take it away, and only add new stuff every week, it's like they don't even want my money.
---
Fallout mutants rarely if ever retain much of their human appearance in the franchise.
---
There is only 174 mannequins in Fallout 76. Found out using 76Edit
---
Under the Luck tree in perks, look at starched genes and class freak level them both up and have fun.
---
Yeah... see... that's what I mean. I'd rather just fart around, instead of farming events and stuff.
---
With two levels of the luck perk called Starched Genes. It locks your mutations in so radaway can’t get rid of it however with the card I believe you also can not be mutated. If you unequip the card you will be able to remove and gain mutations again.
---
Starched Genes perk in Luck
---
There are a lot of human NPCs in the game. They're just all dead now.
---
I would say any area with low level enemies so new comers don’t have to worry about level 30 super mutants or something like that
---
and the search continues.
---
yeah i always check anyone who sells plans near me cause some people give insane discounts, like this morning i got like ten plans for camp shit for like fifty caps total off this one guy in Charleston.
---
What's the difference?
---
I got the starched genes perk card as soon as I could. You can take radaway and still keep your mutations, rad-x does still suppress them though
---
Can give you a dress if you are on xbox
---
Chainsaws were the most affected but if your mr handy buzzblade or ripper is doing the same damage as it ever was then you weren't using weapon artisian to repair it lol.  Used to make those weapons viable.  Now the chainsaw is just sad and an actual joke despite the loading screen flavor text saying it is an intended improvised weapon.
---
There is perk card called starched genes. At Max rank (level 2) it prevents Rad Away from removing mutations and prevents you from gaining any new mutations from rads. The perk card is not available until higher levels
---
definitely is. 
---
it's  2\^32 - 12 
---
you probably add 12 previously  and for some reason the server validated a wrong substraction
---
I think your drop rate of good weapons is going to be the same. Note that good is entirely relative to your build.
---
However, surely your build is more tailored to melee Vs ranged or vice versa? That's the most important thing.
---
I sell syringer ammo for zero....
---
tell me about it my level fifteen ass gets the occasional camp raid from a group of level 62 super mutants and their puppy.
---
Yes, thanks for reaffirming it's only for those of low moral stock
---
No, they haven't even added the same amount of content as FO4 yet, and have even sold those assets for real cash in this game already. So, no, no more cash for Beth.
---
Nah man, 76 feels the most "alive" f you ask me. Computers with bad animation don't imerse me as much as actually hearing what others have left behind or the actual real LIFE person standing next to me in game.
---
Before you can unlock these cards you have to avoid taking lots of rad damage, use Brahmin milk and Nuka Grape to get rid of rads, or play with people using the Rad Sponge perk.
---
I haven't seen it for months. I find quad stuff once in awhile but not double anymore. I just found a quad ultracite laser yesterday so I don't think it was removed from those either. I've  spent a ton of scrip on ranged weapons and haven't seen one there either.  Guess I wasn't much help. Lol!
---
Logo it No76
---
I'm sorry sir there is a 1 cap minimum.
---
Helps to know other people arent getting them, maybe its actually just gone
---
Interesting. I’ve never counted the holes before but I’ve spent a lot of time in that area and it doesn’t seem like a full course.
---
At I think level 30 you can get a perk called starched genes. It locks those affects so you don’t lose them and it’s how you can stack so many. (Made it to 46. I may be wrong on the level requirement, haven’t even played the game this year.)
---
speaking for myself but the only thing i buy from players is plans for things so if you have extra those are a good bet.
---
I'm level 14... 😂😂😂and i just barely made it out alive ignoring all the level 40s and Freddie Lang at level 70. The only way i did it in the mine was by luring freddie to the mole miners and let them fight to the death and quickly looted his body for the key fragment!! I'm ready to go back to the forest! 😭😭
---
I have the plans for sale. 1 left.. XB1. They are in my vendor locker.
---
I'd be up for Javelins/Throwable Spears, too.  Would be cool if there was a thrown weapon top tier, like there is for grenades or mines (i.e. Baseball Grenade --&gt; Throwing Knife, Nuka Grenade --&gt; Heavy Throwing Spear).  Probably not all that useful, but would be nifty to have a targeted "finisher" that gave a single shot that was more powerful than your main weapon.  That's generally how I used throwing knives in the early game. Probably pretty niche in application, though.
---
They made the ghouls spawn at all levels, so there's a chance you've cleared it and not noticed.
---
At this point both of my slugger and commando cards are just about maxed out, i just don't really have a good weapon to put my commando cards into use.
---
I got one! If you're selling a legendary weapon, regardless of 1-3 star, mod the weapon down to it's most basic/default form, because all the mods make the weapon heavier. It might not be a huge difference but if you have multiple weapons, the decrease in weight adds up.
---
Maybe you did it by accident? I think there was a patch recently that allowed higher-level ghouls to be golfer ghouls.
---
I usually just do 2\* ranged weapons.  I bet I have gotten 5 explosive weapons in the last week doing that. The only time I do 3\* stuff is when I have an odd amount of scrip left for the day.  Imo 2\* ranged is the best value.
---
Yeah, I dont buy those "we are the monsters" arguments.  Generally speaking, I'm just looking for scrap, they attack me first.
---
Except when the scrap is on their bodies, but that's their fault too.
---
One is visually seeing a person talk and emote at me vs a voice on a tape
---
That is my question too, what the hell is the difference functionally?
---
Isn't that what serum recipes and whitespring decorations are for?
---
It takes a toll on a ones body
---
I'd love this but the way buildings are destroyed and how they are built would really have to be tighten up. It's really easy to get into someone's camp at the moment. If wall could take alot more punishment (the attackers would have to guess if the ammunition investment would be worth it or not) and if offensive turrets and traps worked better then I'd be all for it. But until those things are fixed it would just be really frustrating. I feel like most people would just put really terrible stuff in there anyways.
---
I give away all kinds of light weight shit. Bobby pins, requisition forms, common clothing that people need for quests of challenges (army fatigues, clown hats, beet hats, etc), common recipes and plans, and 38 and 44 ammo (stash space permitting) all get priced at zero. If I need the vending slots I'll pull stuff out and drop it on the ground, but I try to leave it there in case someone needs it. 
---
My camp is on the road that runs south of the golf course, just east of the miner monument and the fissure site. I get lots of low level visitors trying to make their first voyage into the savage divide, and the stuff rarely lasts long.
---
Somebody posted the other day about having one, and asking if it could also have the Quad effect too.
---
Don't remember when they said it dropped/when it vendored though, sorry.
---
Ya, the last double I found was a .44 western back in February.
---
So. The. Fuck. What.
---
So the only difference is a poorly animated computer? It's literally the same experience if you close your eyes...
---
just in general we should be able to spend material to level up our equipment without having to make a completely new one and re make every single mod.
---
If you were on PS4 and fought him at drop site 9 but it was in the blast zone I was there too. Wondering why the drop site was in the blast zone, didn't like that I needed power armor to go in there. Also if it's just outside the blast zone you'll see less of the more dangerous mobs.
---
Let me put some 5.56 Chin-a-ling in your handmade!
---
I'll let you buy 5.56 from me..
---
Of course I have some "Really Nice" Syringer ammo
---
Asylum nurse does that also. Really annoying.
---
The likelihood of garbage rolls is equal in my observations. If I get one more Nocturnal Tire Iron I swear to God.....
---
They arnt called unruly golfers anymore. They just have the golf outfits on it looks like
---
Me too.  556 ammo has been a big seller.  I also charge 1 cap per.  
---
Bulk items like ballistic fiber, oil, springs, screws sell as well.  I’m only charging 30-40 for most bulk items. 
---
Surprisingly, I see a lot of plasma cores.  More so than fusion cores. 
---
I price stuff to sell
---
You can't deploy your base unless all 4 are on that world?
---
Did you name your exploding  cryolater Brain Freeze?
---
Yeah. Didn't know about that part. Totally my bad. But now I know for next time. Some reason I thought I had to aim the nuke directly on the fissure
---
Bethesda doesn't care about customers. They create broken games and broken fan products and don't even bother to do anything to improve situation. Bethesda has become a joke.
---
Annoying? Not when you're trying to follow in the great Butcher Pete's footsteps... don't even need to get undressed.
---
It’s completely messed up. I get nothing from three star enemies sometimes and other times I get two one star drops from a normal ghoul.
---
I have been saving all my atoms for them to finally put the fucking security guard armor from Fallout 4 in the shop. 
---
i love the look of it and i saw it in the atom shop in one of the early ads for it but to my knowledge it has never actually made it in.
---
In my head the base would deploy even if only one person was on. I guess you'd have to really trust your friends though, unless you could only edit your part of the settlement.
---
at first i thought it generated nuka cola for some reason, then i came back, and no nuka cola. sad face.
---
**Marsupial mutations should make grow hair on the player's ass**
---
Because this sh#t is unrealistic and I hate it.
---
I would like some sort of Nomad perk where we can move our camp for no cost but the build limit is severely diminished. Let us play as true scroungers.
---
You didn’t pay for a canvas bag let’s be honest here lol. It is a really minor, inconsequential detail.
---
This!!  I made the mistake of dropping stuff in a paper bag because I was in a field and needed to get somewhere fast.  I needed to drop weight and had nowhere to put it so I rolled the dice and dropped a lot of stuff in a bag, placed a marker and left.  Came back in 10 minutes and it was gone.
---
Sadness ensued.
---
You have over 500 upvotes with an 88% upvote rate. The fuck are you complaining about?
---
the constant limited time only sales are a tried and true sales tactic to generate artificial scarcity and get people to make poorly thought out impulse buys.
---
I do that from time to time. I have way to much stuff and I’d rather someone else get some use outta it than leave it in a doggy bag on the street.
---
Looks like it should work. The weapon itself has WeaponTypePistol, and the grips with "Stock" in the name add WeaponTypeRifle. With the other grips, it'd only use pistol perks.
---
&gt; How. You. can. Have. That. High. Damage?!?!?! Best I have ever had was 760 in fatman
---
Probably a bloodied build with all the relevant perks and mutations. My baseball bat does somewhere around 1,100 per swing when I'm below 20% hp. My bloodied level action does over 350, and I don't even have any rifle perks.
---
With the right build, you can get a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet into the range of 5k per hit, which is enough to one hit every normal enemy in the game, and take noticeable chunks of health of the queen.
---
I have not found any Double since late November last year (if I remember the date correctly). I'm tracking all my loot drops since February and have not seen it at vendors either. I find Quads reasonably frequently and the Purveyor also gave me a Quad.
---
Given my experience with loot chances, either the base chance for Double is pretty low or there is a bug in the loot generator that would not pick Double from the effect table (i.e., last element of the list of legendary effects ignored because an off-by-one bug).
---
Rank 2 of the Starched Genes perk (in the Luck tree and can be picked on level up starting at level 30) prevents anything from removing mutations as long as it's equipped.
---
As for Rad-X, there's no way to stop it from temporarily disabling your mutations. Use the diluted version instead if you want them to stay active. There is also a late game alternative to Rad-X called Radshield which gives more rad resistance and doesn't temporarily disable your mutations.
---
I would like to upvote this more!
---
&gt;repair kits should have 100% been something for lazy players to buy with caps instead of atoms
---
and like 12000 caps each.  I get that..because I'm not lazy and regularly keep my weapons in high state of repair, I have like 21 of these improved repair kits.
---
I’m woulda just left the server.
---
Look comments it was at 59% DV for first hour.
---
I would put the iou for toilet paper
---
...that voice is wrong broski.  Sorry lol.  Tbh, I sell almost everything in my camp cheap as hell in Flatwoods too but 7 scrip for 15 caps is not something I'm going to feel bad about.
---
I will be now. :)
---
Can confirm it works with both sets of perks currently. Revolver. Must have rifle stock to get the rifle and pistol to both apply.
---
So were entitled to free microtransactions on top of free dlc?

&gt;last 3 pandas on earth" 
---
Ah ... Man.... Guess I don't have the last one then....
---
I haven't seen a post about it yet, but what perk loadouts, planters, and stash increases!?
---
This was an awesome patch
---
Haha I'll refer to my previous statement on the matter:
---
"Also, I want to get ahead of this one and ask that no one say "because it is a joke weapon." If anything the Buzzblade is sillier and less work went into it. As far as I can tell the Buzzblade has 1 mod v. the 3 different bar variants and flamer mod of the Chainsaw. And even of it was a "joke weapon" there is no good reason not to make it viable."
---
I'll amend that to add that the animations and sounds are also far better, so why put so much work into a "joke?" I'll add to it what another user said about the flavor text indicating it was intended as an actual weapon.
---
I asked someone if I could revive them over Xbox chat, just sent them a message asking if I could revive them. 
---
They said no, but then directed me to the bottom of a cliff where her friend jumped off of to their death in front of me so I could revive them lol
---
Serum recipes just get flipped into... more in-game caps. 
---
Decorations? Sure. As long as they can't be sold or traded.... otherwise it's not a "cap sink" at all.
---
If you tag the Sheepsquatch too early, it won't generate legendary loot for you.
---
(How it seems to work is that a regular Sheepsquatch emerges, then the server upgrades it to a legendary. If there is a hiccup, this transformation takes too long confuses the server upon death.)
---
He's a Noxious Sheepsquatch. He's not Legendary.
---
Lol only a little. But how will you ever truly know with all this internet between us. Best to keep it that way.
---
Give you the dress for free if XB1.
---
Lol yeah, buts it's fun to play make believe every once in a while 🤗
---
Pretty Gatling gun hand grips
---
Any place on the map, if u have good items, players will come to buy.
---
So you're saying Fallout is also in the I Am Legend universe?
---
I like to save it... then drop it all in a bag at the feet of a sub-level 10 player.
---
gave 2000 10mm rounds to a level 4 yesterday.
---
I did it by  myself and I think there are less enemies when you do (btw I'm like lvl 80)
---
Where you at? I use the syringer ALL the damn time.
---
Agreed. I enjoy this game enough that I'm fully prepared to buy atoms for something I like but they have to put out enough quality content that I spend the 4500+ I've already got banked. That's not gonna happen for a long time if they keep dropping dumb shit like they have been.
---
The two bodies on the ground however, are
---
I sell magazines and treasure maps for 0 caps. Most magazines are useless to me and I'm tired locating the treasure over and over hidden in the grass.
---
That was when they were being dropped by the queen and/or duped.   They are no longer dropped by the queen.
---
Ah OK so that's what happened, because at the start of the fight they weren't legendaries, but they transformed in the middle
---
I never payid 80$ for game, not even half that much, for 100% working game. 
---
If they didn't want free income of atoms for players, they should just delete them, not make some imposible trash.
---
Now that you mention it...only seen quad drop
---
Do 2\* ranged - its easier to get a great roll that way for less cost.  3\* rolls are generally a crapshoot, not very efficient unless you already have enough endgame pieces.
---
To anyone with Bird Bones: you dumb bird bitch
---
I remember killing you in survival after spawning inside of you. You gave a thumbs up but I killed you anyway since I was in first place and didnt trust you lmao
---
Its hard to miss em when he's still around with his brothers t-pose and halfhead. Maybe its platform dependent though.
---
If it's still available, can I take it off your hands? Lol
---
Yes plz.
---
I’m not playing a game to close my eyes and imagine what I’m seeing. Imagine playing fallout 4 and instead of seeing your wife get shot and your son taken you just found a recording of the event. It doesn’t have the same impact. All I’m saying is if we actually got to meet the overseer I’d probably care a little more about the main quest.
---
What is the theory
---
I agree
---
So what I *used* to do was hold the E key to blueprint, and then I'd hit Z to select the whole structure.  This used to grab all of the floors, the walls, roof, anything ON the floors (workbenches, bed, etc), anything ON the walls (posters, etc), and the turrets I had on my roof.  Now, it only grabs a few things and I can't blueprint the whole structure anymore.
---
I actually did try playing with the "Grow selection" option, but it didn't work or make it any better for me.
---
Best suggestion here.
---
I am level 250. I killed a level 40 who was wanted.... Reason why is because I wanted to hit him with a 3\* shovel. Not my proudest moment.
---
 Yeah they do change.
---
It stacks
---
I thought taking a mutation serum of one that you already had was the only way to suppress a mutation.
---
Seems you're more lacking imagination than the game lacking story. Because the voice acting and stories of what these people went through in 76 is much more convincing and miles better than anything in FO4...
---
I had no idea this was the case.  I just assumed it was not that effective of a perk.  So, for the short bus people...
---
The action you are describing is as follows (assumes perk card is active):
---
1. Check chem box and get "default/random" quantity chems
---
2. Close chem box
---
3. Check chem box again and get additional chems
---
Is this how it works?
---
Yeah!  Faster horses!  We want faster horses! WOOOO! /s
---
I still have it... haven't done it yet.
---
at level 205 .. there are very few plans I don't have.. I started just buying all plans just to have them.. At some point you can't build anymore due to camp budget.. you have nothing to more to buy as you have everything.. 
---
I have nothing more to spend caps on so the bank builds up.
---
Thanks B for vendors and these new badges. They keep us "busy". To fill my time and Fallout 76 addiction (anyone have some addictol?) I've become a "Guardian Angel" as it suits my personality. I just seek out low level players and help them out. I'm having a blast. Others may become PVP'ers but they have servers for that..
---
I wish someone could nerf me, I am too OP for my own good
---
This is just the component view being weird. Normal menu is fine.
---
I wanna say yes but between comics and journals and commission work I’m not sure I’d have the time
---
me to.. farming is not "my thing"
---
Wow didn't know people still don't have them yet, didn't realize getting canvas out in the wasteland is so hard. Maybe they using Ballistic Fibers to make it?
---
If you head west up the tracks from lewisberg station, there's a traincart with some skeletons and it's in there :-).
---
I mean, you can play ghoul head soccer. try it some time. get a friend. get a ghoul (or scorched) head, and use a small caliber weapon to try and shoot it past them.
---
no, not specifically op, just people in general who aggravate people into telling them to kill themselves or being racist... Then reporting said person and feeling justified for doing so too. I'm very immature about things like that (false honor, people being shitty but hiding it behind a guise of distributing social justice)  but l also think most people shouldn't exist and devoid of natural predators we have bred ourselves to excess and now like any species we are in need of a culling. So you see why I don't think much of either party involved. Both are parts of society we need to breed out. I, myself,  in all likely hood will do nothing to further our species colonization of the galaxy so you may ask what right do I have to comment- to which I say this... Who best to remind the kettle if not the pot? :)
---
Got it.  This is the most valuable thread I've read in a while.  I stopped using those cards completely becuase I thought they were useless.  Dohh!
---
The only things I farm are Copper (in an extractor in my backyard), and "workshop defense" events... for plans. I'll jump in on those whenever I can.
---
Huh. I could have sworn it wasn't passive in Fallout 4, because I seem to remember having the same reaction then as well, after putting like 80 hours in to the game lol. 
---
But maybe I'm mis-remembering.
---
Man, I thought you meant like the Cannon from a Stryker IFV.  The 130mm.  Which would he amazing as a new heavy weapon, just a slow firing, explosive, shoulder mounted artillery.
---
I sometimes set mini nukes to 0 caps. those things are a rip off and are expensive to make. Plus I like being attacked by a player that uses Fat Man, they’re a very unique challenge!
---
The plan or just a grenade?
---
Sounds good.  I'll be on later.
---
So much back and forth information in here. I can only test the pipe pistol (not the revolver or bolt action) the pipe pistol is just one or the other but not both.  Not sure on the other guns
---
As cool as that would be, I have a feeling that would eat up a lot of camp budget.
---
I've seen Double in player vendors, but I'm pretty confident I've never found one myself.
---
I want to do it!!! My psn is watsonxo, what’s yours? This sounds like a blast
---
I had to relog yesterday to progress the Watoga questline.
---
Found the sabotuer's hide-out, but couldn't find all 5 clues.
---
I did end up looting like 50 of his holotape and the same of his terminal password. None of which were properly tagged as quest items.
---
Hopped servers and them he properly had 1 of each which were both tagged and completed that section of quest.
---
You spent 10 minutes watching?
---
I do this too.
---
Your question isn’t being answered as directly as it could be:  you want a shop around other shops.  Yes WS and central savage divide is ideal, because a lot of people camp there, so shoppers can hop there on the cheap and it be worth their while if a shop’s contents are junk.  Not literal junk... ahhh you probably get it.
---
If you plant a shop in east bog or north mire, expect few guests.  If you just happen to be on a server where 2-3 others did the same, you’ll likely get some business.
---
Plant one near the SBQ?  I bet money you’ll get a lot of visitors around a nuke.  In fact dropping nukes in that regard would be to your benefit.  Nothing attracts a crowd more than a nuke!
---
Location, location, location my friend.  Inventory is second until we get a better display of said inventory.
---
Why are you defending Bethesda for releasing a blatantly unfinished game?
---
I’ve liked every other Bethesda game but fallout 76. Sure 76 is getting slowly better but the quality it was released in and the lying at the e3 reveal was terrible and I think Todd owes the fans an apology
---
What console are you on??
---
Both cavalier and sentinel stack, hence the nerf as wearing a full set pretty much made the wearer invincible under the right conditions.
---
The bathrobe is also pretty glorious.

Jesus man, who peed in your sugar bombs this morning?
---
Plan
---
This is a great idea.  I had not considered it, but at some point I was up on a cliff-side that had a bucket of balls, golf clubs and empty beer bottles.  I was very dissapointed I could not whack the balls.  This is actually similar to another location where there are traps setup with bodies on top and wired to explosive plungers - the bodies you can launch.
---
There is the golf club sticking out of the bag at Whitesprings front door (vs being inside a searchable golf bag), so maybe this is going to be a thing someday.
---
With all the villianous "obstacles" on the course, that would be a fun tournament!
---
Reminds me of the time I replaced a friends ball with a chalk ball.  Ah good times!
---
I had almost forgotten.
---
Mine is same as reddit. I’m worried it won’t be as good as this guys though, plus you already know where one is haha.
---
If you walk up to people and jump up and down, you’re giving them a face full of your package.
---
What are they fixing?
---
It will come at the same time as preorders of next Fallout game.
---
Nevermind the high chance that they'd be bug ridden.
---
Ladies and gentlemen our "savior" has arrived
---
Haha hey any scavenger hunt is good! It’s so creative. I don’t have PC so I can’t really tell but I’m sure yours is good :) I need help in general to build my camp in an interesting way that’s also in budget, looking at all the camps makes me jealous!
---
Brazenly what Bethesda did there. #alwaysremember
---
My BE Harpoon Gun does 4300 Damage without chems active, just bloodied and the adrenaline perk card.  Toss a couple chems on there and that’s easily over 5-6k a shot
---
and it works!
---
Look at ESO. A lot of those costumes and stuff.. end up being a badge of honour that says "I've been here since XXXXXX".
---
I no longer have turrets in my camp for this exact reason.  No turrets for me = SB follow me when I bounce for the trees.
---
You say,” would you like to marry me?”   Works 100% of the time.
---
Yup but won’t be logged in for another hour or so
---
If you hit up their spawn points in the bog they're almost always 3 star and they have reliably dropped 3 star loot for me.
---
Nicely done
---
Wait? What? Where? When?
---
I always assumed that it will be back next year but this sounds like before then. 
---
I hold on dearly to the fasnacht robot holotape. I know it said the robots can choose whenever they hold the parade but I still thought it'd only be yearly.
---
Your awesome, I’m on the Xbox but I really appreciate the offer. People like you are why this community is amazing.
---
Saviors a strong word there buddy don't mince words tell me how you really feel.
---
We value your opinion and we are happy that you shared it.
---
You forgot to call the game trash.  It is vitally important while freaking out about nothing at all to call the game trash and then immediately admit you've played for hundreds of hours.
---
Well feel free to stop by
---
I was exploring the area for ten minutes and she was still doing it when I left
---
So the extended storage reduces your rad resistance and the refrigeration lowers your carrying capacity.  What are the negative effects on the other backpack mods?
---
Not for everybody. 
---
I like the game. I support it with Atom purchases.
---
bring on the downvotes, but it won't make a difference. If you enjoy the game, support it, or it goes away. I enjoy it. I support it.
---
Pretty much did Haha. I scoured arpund Berkeley station for an hour before deciding on the best location in the area.
---
Sounds like you're going to have to go abck and kill that wendigo again. Maybe someone will provide an escort.
---
AA is pretty op. As a low lvl the Somerset one was doing the most damage to other players aside from a sneaky headshot. Would sit and wait for the headshot from rifle and if i got it would quickly run right at em with AA relover and could put down high lvl players. Now im keep my eye out for more AA weapons for sure 😮
---
I know big yikes for really low intelligence  consumers such as yourself going against pro consumer practices by falling for in love with lines from a corporate degenerate. 
---
When did you’re standards get to shit and how low is your IQ exactly lol. 
---
Yikes all the fuckin way my guy.
---
The only useful aspect of a loot able stash would be for giving stuff away.
---
It's sad and frustrating, though I guess that's the point.
---
But so many of them seemed to be so well planned and prepared, it makes no sense that not a single human being has survived.
---
Not even a single Raider, aside from Rose. You find abandoned tree houses in the middle of nowhere with dead settlers on upper floors - how did anything kill them? They're surrounded by food. No mirelurks could get up there. I guess maybe a scorchbeast could?
---
I dunno. There are plenty of areas with no Scorchbeats that are just as dangerous/safe as the Commonwealth in Fallout 4. Plenty of thriving towns there.
---
I appreciate what they're going for, but the world just feels hollow and empty compared to Fallout 4. I know we're meant to be re-populating, it just bugs me that so far we're given a clear reason why not 1 single human being has survived across the entire region.
---
Would be happy to :)
---
Quickest way to do it without any human interaction is to keep an eye out for the encrypted event,  people drop like flies and there is a convenient puddle so you might get both the revives at once. It also in not uncommon during the scorch beast queen event for people to request a revive.
---
I am on PC and as a fellow Vault 76 dweller i am prepared to die for each and every one of you! have done it half a dozen times so far that is the Vault-Tec way.
---
I like the lootable bin idea. I leave random stuff on a "free crap" table in my camp. I drop whatever I dont want on the table before I'm off to farm shit.
---
Thank you! I just did this one for the first time and was taking pictures all over the roof trying to get it to count.  Came here, found your advice, jumped up there, and bam! 10 atoms for the day.  =D
---
im not gonna get spoiled i wanna play :D  MrBright01  i will add you :P
---
Alternately, see if you have saved items that you haven't placed, and scrap them.
---
Well from what I've read from this post you seem like a dangerous psychotic individual. I dunno if it's just you fucking with me or if you do this everywhere but I'm honestly too tired to look.
---
Have you encountered a bug where a power armor would be smaller than normal?? I saw a guy trading with a vendor, he was shorter than me wearing power armor, he was like a kid PA. So cute and funny.
---
I'll send you a PM with my tag :) just shoot me a message when you hop on
---
I was thinking this exact same thing this morning!  I think the message board would be a cool feature too and a way to also tell someone you visited and liked their place.
---
The serum suppresses the downsides and boosts the positives of the appropriate mutation for a bit. Undiluted Rad-X pauses all effects of all mutations.
---
where do you get the clown mask? i haven't seen that one before, pretty cool looking :)
---
Taking Rad X is pointless as a mutant
---
Easy to be "successful" when you take payment for a product you never deliver.
---
Could be because fusion cores are pretty easy to farm. I only buy them if they're really cheap because having a workshop with they fusion core generator gives enough for power armor use.
---
I wouldn’t consider this canvas bag a success.
---
Love this idea.
---
I just was told the same thing yesterday about 3* legendaries. If possible, take some time after they spawn to attack them. If in a mob, and you can differentiate between targets, attack the 3* legendary last.
---
Bite your tongue!
---
We need more wasteland armor looking outfits imo
---
Since I started some booze business I wish the fermenter "stash" would be seperated from my main one. 50 should be enough. It's annoying that booze takes so much stash right now
---
You have to have startched genes perk card.
---
The companions and NPCs in Fallout 4 gave you feedback on your playstyle, though. On the consequences of your decisions.
---
Holotapes don't care what you are or aren't doing. They ask you to do something and you can ignore it. Real life players don't stop and say "Hey, you did a really noble thing there and I respect you for it" or "You're being a total asshole and if you keep it up I will abandon you". I mean, they can, but it's way less likely.
---
Always works when i walk away. Everytime.
---
True
---
I’ve been told the actual math is closer to 55%
---
The games fucked up and coding horrible with all the shit they keep on their end.
---
Potatoe servers Fl.
---
In re:  to your situation, and probably most other ones:
---
The games lag is sooooo damn bad that if you loot a legendary corpse immediately, it will almost always be one star.  
---
If you wait 60-90 seconds, it will usually figure it’s slow ass out and give you the appropriate star number item- most people are click happy and get shafted then complain.
---
This is likely the same kind of issue but effecting his label and flagging as legendary in the first place and waiting to hit, like waiting to loot, will fix it. 
---
Works for me.  I mean, we’re basically playing on an alpha test game that’s had it’s funding cut.
---
Absofreakinglutely
---
I set things to 0 caps on occasion. 
---
I often give stuff away for free to players in person.
---
 If you have Chameleon Armour only the Night Vision  scope will work. The rest become invisible too.
---
Mutants delight, rad shield, diluted rad x, and a glowing blood pack.
---
No probs
---
Go ask the WV natives if the game was a copy paste.
---
Seriously though, that's a perspective not a single YouTuber has considered.  This game captured so much of WV, both environmentally and culturally, that you can't say there wasnt real work and love put into this game.
---
This is basically economic griefing.   These bored people are destroying the market.
---
Another part of the game ruined until Bethesda implements a minimal base cost in vending.
---
Is their head their weak point? I remember seeing a post on here saying it was their legs.
---
I can't tell, both seem to do the same to me.
---
I like using a limb damage heavy gun on them though. They don't rush you with broken legs.
---
I have disease cures hotkeyed for that exact reason.
---
I've never nuked myself so I'd probably have done the same thing, I just go to the event when it pops up lol. Too scared to launch a nuke by myself. We did kill her though so all's well that ends well.
---
Chinese pistol would be awesome and a regular assault rifle from Fallout 3 would be nice too. I just want to see more heavy weapons from the past games come back, and to see the return of one's from New Vegas it would be amazing
---
No longer obtainable
---
Waited for like 15-20min, the only thing that happened was that the other Sheepsquatch corpse disappeared...talk about kicking someone who's already down :-)
---
Here's my problems with human NPC's in the game.  It would ruin immersion for me.  The same people saying the same things every time you pass them gets annoying really quickly.  People will say, "but the robots always say the same things!".  Yes...they are robots.  They follow programming, not free will so it makes perfect sense.  Human characters who always say the same shit every time however would be a huge reminder that this is a game.  Especially if dialogue trees popped up that you had to navigate through.
---
And *if* dialogue trees *did* pop up, then you have to consider the player patience factor. I have witnessed other players loose their patience and start unloading a hailstorm of explosive bullets while waiting for someone else to finish up a 1 minute robovendor transaction.  Can you imagine the impatience of just standing around while another player navigates through dialogue trees?
---
Do you still have any serums?? I need like 5 of them and I have the caps for 200 a piece
---
See, to me the game feels MORE alive than FO4. At a subconcious level, I know NPCs are just computers. I know the guy staning next to me shooting the SBQ has his own life story, stash, camp. It's more alive to have all these little unique camps all over the map made by real people.
---
Not really true. My favorite sub stores in fallout comes from Ulysses’s holotapes about his past and the white legs. The most powerful thing that comes from him and you just hear how he describes the event. What helps with it though is visually seeing him. The way he looks and the way he dresses helps describe his character. 
---
All I can tell about the overseer is that she left on her own mission and meet a group of survivors (who are also all dead) and she saw the scorched beast and it put fear into her.
---
Now I want to test it on someone's brahmin
---
Sure yeah do you mind which serums or is it just any? As I only have a few types
---
sorry, but that's a horrible idea. it would immediately become a "take it if you want it" box full of spoiled food and syringer ammo. People would complain (myself included) that 200lbs of their storage is being wasted. People would just create an inaccessible room that only owner can get to, so even the raider aspect would be lost.
---
Agreed.
---
Dang!  That goes with my clown outfit better than the faschnacht man mask....
---
"Real life players don't stop and say "Hey, you did a really noble thing there and I respect you for it" or "You're being a total asshole and if you keep it up I will abandon you". I mean, they can, but it's way less likely."
---
...uuuuhhhhh, have you ever browsed this subreddit before? That is litterally every other post...
---
I still do that. Usually no more than a few hundred of each in case they haven’t put points into strength, yet. :)
---
I read the title as it does, I clicked and I'm like... wait a minute
---
Just run by the condos on the right - swarms of them come out. Along with a few 62 ghouls, but what the heck. That's why the cars blow up.
---
Thanks buddy you da best
---
if you remember the release - state in which FO76 launched...  it bombed itself. Current version maybe not so much and the hate might bias reviews... 
---
This is only a new distributor of the product, so it would be weird for it now to have great reviews (on a new platform with no history of the product) 6+ months later? heck those good reviews would be only beneficial for bethesda from a sales perspective.
---
hate has subsided with time and patches, that does not change the past... in the same light we should learn as consumers (prepurchase is bad) and beth as a AAA company what can happen with a rushed product, and how the same company with time and testing can do to improve it.. imagine they launched in the current state... things would have gone much differently.
---
Apparently you havn't dont mistress of mystery or personal matters... or cold case...
---
Thanks for reminding me of this, just done the same :)
---
Happened on my server last night. Didn't die or lose anything, but someone did start a sheepsquatch right after the queen glitched out during a scorched earth failure and we got the quest rewards anyway.
---
Undiluted?
---
As a baby survival character, I quickly became aware that the sound of my gun could attract other players. I found the crossbow to be the perfect one-shot weapon (at least up to about 20th level creatures). I really enjoyed scouting the camp, identifying the sentries, and seeing how many folks I could take out silently.
---
In adventure, I just walk into any situation with a power fist and hope everything just comes to me to be killed.
---
Not to be a smartass, and ill get downvoted for this, but isnt this the point of visiting other players camps?  If you want something, you can visit a camp that shows stock of what category you want?  I get it that its inconvenient to visit a camp and it not have your desired items, but come on.  Get out and explore
---
Not officially, no.
---
I need Marsupial, Speed Demon, Bird Bones, Healing Factor, and Adrenaline Reaction for my build
---
I just like the blind loyalty, center of the universe type thing you get from NPC companions.
---
I don't have to hear, for instance, Hancock's screaming children in the background, or Nick's awful rap music blasting in my ears, or Piper's bad mic broadcasting constant static and crackling, or Strong screaming every slur in the book. People can be obnoxious but NPCs are programmed to appeal to players.
---
TL;DR real people are messy and complicated; NPCs are straight-forward and simple to interact with.
---
Yeah. Yours too? Asking as I usually ignore requests u less I know they’re coming.
---
because you want to give it away to help someone - and leaving it in a suitcase or similar location does not guarantee it will (eventually) be taken and used.  At least from your vending machine, you know it wont disappear to bit-heaven when you log out or the server resets
---
I've seen a few different variations of this idea pop up, thanks for the suggestion!
---
...and dont get me started on the merchandising
---
It was nerfed via the effect no longer spawning.   
---
Narcs will always try to be narcs though, so keep complaining.
---
“...use it to bulk *aluminum and lead*, which saves space...”
---
Sure, if it turned out to be fun and didn't eat up development resources that could be put to better use on something else.
---
I saw two launch in about an hour on fissure prime last night on PS4, I went to the queen fight both times. I’m pretty much out of ammo now 😂 nukes are a rare sight now but definitely more frequent on weekends. One day, up get one launched. Need to restock the ammo stores first!
---
If you open your social menu, and scroll to said annoying player, you can hit the mute button... Not being the center of the universe is exactly why this game is more real than FO4. To people reading this thread, don't get me wrong, I love FO4. 76 is not 4 though. The point is adding NPCs doesn't change the formula.
---
...and whatever the prestige system will be.
---
Bummers... I will keep an eye out for it, thx!
---
I cant wait to launch my own! Someday!
---
Ah out of those I only have marsupial and speed demon, sorry! But you are welcome to come buy the two my psn is zuperfly1
---
I want more "average dude with a job trying to make it" outfits.  Plumbers and delivery boys and hippies and … just... average dude clothing.
---
I can confirm that they work in workshops.  I use them all the time.
---
Wohoo! Just in time! Glad you got to take down the Queen!
---
Haha I love this, great idea!
---
lol they called me a madman.
---
I've made 20 characters and done the first two responder quests each.  Farmed Collision Course, Back on the Beat, Feed the People, Leader of the Pack, all the Forest events over and over and over and still.
---
No.  Responder.  FIREMAN.  OUTFIT.
---
I feel your pain brother.
---
What's with the unnecessary rudeness?
---
Diluted rad-x doesn't disable mutations
---
I see your point, but Atom Shop or not, they just can add the "untradeable" mechanic to the item to avoid devaluation. Dupe as many as you want now...
---
Only the full strength stuff does it. The diluted version you can make at a chem bench or find occasionally doesn't effect your mutations.
---
I get these blind invites to arktos all the time being over 200. I refuse every single one of them because I've been griefed waaaaaaaay too many times.  Try sending a message with the invite so it isnt blind, we dont all look to see you're at arktos.  I know ps4 has this ability through the psn but sure about the others.
---
Have you considered placing a terminal instead of a chair? It works for those in PA.
---
Understandable, but yes it is the same. I should be on in a little over an hour.
---
The outfit, not the plan I mean.
---
Still waiting for another emial. Confirmed my address ect few weeks ago
---
Redesigning and redistributing something like this can take more than a few months. Even with a short production time (4-6 weeks), there will still time in sourcing the new fabric, materials (trims and crap), testing screen prints, testing for things like flammability, etc. I can’t remember when these were announced, but I’d honestly expect 6-9 months before they’re ready to be distributed. 
---
Source: work in the apparel / manufacturing industry for 10 years.
---
Cool, same. Give me a few minutes to scrounge up some screws and springs (I’m always low, particularly on screws) and we’ll be good :)
---
Lol defending youtubers, that scum will dance any jig they need to for those adsense pennies.
---
For the Ghoul suggestion, maybe it is just me but I would not mind if they just made a Ghoul player skin.  Nothing that really affects gameplay other than your appearance.  Or someone could do something similar when mods come.
---
Unfortunately my budget is maxed because of unremovable iron hero statue
---
Awesome! Thats at lease 2 of the 5 down for a great price too!!
---
They need to raise the temperature of Corn Soup though, it's too cold.
---
Not just smaller. Half the size. BGS is like the Adam Sandler to CDPR's Robert Downey Jr
---
140 is the perfect temperature for soup and honestly anyone who says otherwise is probably a dirty fucking commie
---
Tbh, I don’t have that bad an ammo usage except on queen.
---
I also use it like I would irl, 3 round bursts - recenter - repeat.
---
If you just spray, yeah, that’s going to miss a lot and up ammo usage to intolerable levels.
---
Stimpacks lots of them......
---
If you can premake the computer parts.
---
And bring a weapon that does extra damage to robots, ranged and melee. 
---
That is all.
---
Git gud scrub
---
Players are immune to the scorch plaque because we finish the research on it and get vaccinatedas part of the games quests. I always thought gradually becoming scorched would have been cool if you didn't finish that quest soon enough.
---
Perk cards.  It’s all just a really really bad way of making you think the game isn’t over.  
---
Horrible design choice
---
Don't do it alone. If you wanna fight her out of pa you can lure her outside the nuke zone if you hit the right spot which can't remember exactly where that is 🤔 think you put prime barely inside the blast radius. Also I think the codes reset on  Tuesday so make sure you have the current decrypted codes and don't forget your nuke card key
---
If you share it with them, it works for both.
---
Its un you pipboy....
---
Stat tab under collections
---
I'm still waiting on the skins for the handmade. Tired of folks constantly requesting my main weapon
---
Ahhhhh this is SO COOL! I'm gonna have to start playing on my PC character more to see if I can find you. I've seen some fun xbox CAMPs but this is next level.
---
Was gonna say... its been there lol
---
I've been grinding for 235 levels....haven't got the weapon I want yet.
---
Don't know, but in the last inside the vault the devs talked about it.
---
Yep, bethesda is a small indie company and they possibly couldnt make those things.
---
Stop expecting aaa quality from a three man company
---
Huh.
---
I miss the power armor abomination glitch more

Leave a comfortable space around Drop Site V9.  As long as Fissure Site Prime is blinking on the target map, you'll spawn the Queen.
---
Also, yes, the codes will reset today and on every Monday at 5pm PST, so run silos at your own peril.
---
I mean, they were supposed to have the bag ON RELEASE.
---
It’s funny because I remember Todd saying that they would alter your appearance at one point before erelease
---
Log onto a server eith 24 players, 6 of those players are now chickens, a few deathclaws, a few scorchbeasts, suddenly your the only human in fallout
---
You realize that the team working on Fallout 76 isn't the main Fallout team right? It's a small group?
---
#GhoulLife
---
It's tough to choose one but here we go. The winner is ... Plasma rifle. Criteria? The sound when firing it.
---
Check in the armory.
---
Mutants delight?

I would just never have anything in the small box though lol
---
My base in a rad storm, across the street from Pleasant Valley Train Station.

---
its from the monster mash event, you can get it at the event but you can only use it there, after you leave you lose it(except for older glitches)
---
This. Plus it'll keep it from even going into the scrip machine, dropping, or selling.
---
Unfortunately seems like the best way to actually save gear. Favorites work but is limited by the amount.
---
 My nickname for those 3 rad resist chems at once, as none of them affect mutations
---
all 3 hacker cards to turn off the turrets.
---
Ah, looked like it was a separate item on the list and I was wondering what the hell that was. Google didn't bring anything up.
---
Lmaooooo
---
If you were a dude at a cooking station when I got you from behind on survival mode... Well I am not sorry.
---
Yeah the 3rd perk doesn't really make/break a weapon, and the difference in scrip is considerable. 
---
2\* Weapons, 3\* Armor is what I tend to go for.
---
you can get the dress from the building near phillipi battlefield cemetery, it usually spawns there for me
---
I have many to spare, worse case.
---
me
---
If you get an effect you like on the first two keep going a couple more...nocturnal or beserkers come back tomorrow....also if you seem to be getting good world drops maybe hit up the purveyour a couple times.
---
Or if they have a workbench or anything usable by a window.
---
Feel free to add me Aurick411
---
&gt; Farmers already exist.
---
This is true, sadly.
---
Lots of goldfarmers in FO76. Many of them are dupers, who stayed in the game doing all kinds of "business" in ebay and other websites.
---
Bethesda should be carefull about this, or all those stinky goldfarmers from underevolved countries were going to ruin it too, like they ruin every game they parasite.
---
I don't mean offline from the internet, I mean offline from the game server.
---
If you remove the Starched Genes perk, does it remove the mutations? I want to remove mine long enough to pick up another mutation and then equip it again before I remove the rads.
---
I think he meant ask as in the slap damage mechanic.
---
i noticed this last week, my spawn point keeps moving and im not moving my camp thing, also visitor spawn point keeps changing too.
---
Probably not the best idea to be shopping in survival mode but I understand your frustrations.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, your mean fix all the continuous melee weapons. The buzzblade was my favorite weapon until that broke it.
---
Fix the buzzblade and chainsaw/drill.
---
Well I’m happy to accept some as payment!
---
It really isn't though, the buzzblade was actually viable before the update broke it.
---
A single positive or negative comment from some anonymous stranger I don't care about is different from ongoing positive or negative opinions from a companion NPC who I am growing attached to (at my own pace, while able to be selfish and not actually have to consider the other person's opinions/feelings unless I want to).
---
But still, Reddit behaves differently than in-game, from what I've seen.
---
Getting a thumbs-up from another player gives me similar warm-fuzzy feelings, but not quite the same.
---
If you are on ps4 and need a hand lmk
---
I remember laughing the first time I realized that a button needed to be pressed. Was a few weeks after getting the perk too.
---
Well, I'm an idiot.  lol  Never noticed it.  I was looking under inventory
---
If you go to the Nuka Dragons build site, you'd think you get 50 points to play with, and once you've reached 50th level, and that's it, your character is pretty much done. However, your real build may consist of 80-90 perks that you use, and gaining levels after 50 allows you to use these. In my camp, for example, I might use perks like home defense, contractor, white knight, weapon artisan, and super duper. Selling stuff I equip hard bargain. Just running around randomly looting, I equip lockpick x 3, while for a silo run I'd have three rounds of hacker. For SBQ's I'd swap lockpick out for glow sight. Gathering flux I'd equip green thumb and good with salt. All of these were paid for with points I got after level 50.
---
The trick isn't so much planning on how to allocate the points among perks, but how to allocate the points among SPECIALS. For example, even if you're not going to run around with points in intelligence, you probably want at least three points (for fix it good and weapon artisan), and maybe as much as five (for makeshift warrior).
---
Completely false. My Buzzblade went form about 180 to 22 after the update broke it.
---
Do you remember where?  Was it a world spawn or in a container?
---
Not quite. When you hover over the container, and the inventory pops up if you look below the box, it will prompt you to hit a button to search it. No need to leave the container. On PS4 its Triangle, so maybe it's the jump hutton. Across the board? Whatever lets you eat corpses will let you search containers.
---
Can I purchase some from you?
---
First time I've heard anyone say it worked as intended lol....
---
Most of the time I'm here reading how some ahole hunted them down across the map and also went out of their way to demolish their camp as well.
---
Glad things worked out..... sort of lol
---
Fellow PS4 lady here! My PSN is The-Tanya!
---
Can we all just admit that a lot of people love this game and others hate it and some are in the middle?
---
They should just increase the ammo per craft.  You have to continuously farm resources if you want to use it as your main weapon.  It is crazy compared to .50 Cal. and 5mm crafting.
---
Nah, just seperate vending into its own stash.
---
I needed ammo and he had about 9000 for sale :)
---
I'm right there with you.  I pulled a TSE with 25% less VATS AP Cost from the Purveyor.  With the right perks it's insane.  Hell with the wrong perks it's insane.  But the ammo cost limits my use.
---
Holster your weapon 🤔
---
I already did that.
---
Yeah, I'm dumb and forgot about that. But I guess it still adds to my point of doing that for someone other than ourselves as a bit more urgent and gratifying.
---
How do you turn off the turrets? I have 3 hacker cards and can only bypass the lockdown where you repair pipes but when I go to the security terminals, I can't  do anything because it says I'm not authirized robco trained personnel (or something to that matter)
---
I've met a lot of people I've now bonded with and formed a relationship playing this game. People I would have never met otherwise. REAL people. That's my experience. If you try to play this game without real life companions it's not going to be as fun.
---
Maybe you forgot to equip your fire proof perk?
---
Col has 2 tapes, second one is on his body.
---
just make yourself hideous with the character customization, DIY Ugly
---
Other than the random armor perk, there isn't an actual perk card that deals with poison, is there?  I would have figured Endurance would have something like that, but I've never come across it.
---
Why have robots? They add nothing functuonally.  
---
Why have holotapes? We can just read the instructions, why even go looking for quests, functionally it would be so much easier to just have them available from the start.   
---
Its a game, functionally has nothing to do with it, people like to help other people, not a robot, not a dead guy, but a "living person"   
---
It adds immersion to have other people there, it adds more purpose to the quests you do to think youd be helping someone out or a community
---
I don't want uber-realism in my games, which is where I think the major disconnect come between Fallout 4 and 76. It's not realistic that I can take a couple of coffee mugs and an empty can and build a functional machine gun turret, so the Fallout series in general has already jumped the realism shark.
---
Personally, if I want realism, I'll go outside. Games are an escape, for me, but Fallout 4 scratches the "I want to build social connections" itch without all the complexity of building a friendship with a real life human being. I can "ghost" Fallout 4 for 6 months and just pick up where I left off.
---
If I dropped off the social radar irl for 6 months? I'd have a lot of damage control needed to repair those relationships and they'd probably never quite get back to the same point.
---
No, and I think unless maybe a full set of poisoners armor is equipped you just have to avoid the attacks
---
A shoulder mounted artillary/tank cannon.  Think like a broadsider, but looking like a tank barrel on the shoulder.  Slow reload, fast shell speed, high damage, with recievers to make it a lobbed shell like a mini nuke, or AP/Sabot style shells.  Uranium shells would be fun too.
---
Oh is it not additive?
---
I believe it happened two patches ago as I did sent in a ticket and waited for the next update to see if it would be resolved.
---
No!!! I live there!
---
That's fair. But you'll never be able to guarantee your safety at someone's camp in survival. Many probably just hop game modes without even thinking about removing their turrets like you probably just experienced. 
---
You also have to be cautious it's not a trap. I've been hearing a lot about people stocking their vending machines to lure people into deathtraps at their camp's spawn. Overall it's probably a lot better to hop into adventure mode when you need to buy more ammo.
---
Or as the comment below me said holstering your weapon could also help you out if you really still want to shop in survival.
---
Agreed, it would be great to just have mini-games in general. I'd love to be able to go to Camden Park and just play the skee-ball (or atomic ball?). Pinball machines, basketball, golf, etc...
---
Some items are hard to come by, take up too much weight in the stash, cant be sold properly (ammo), or the sellers are limiter in their inventory. Your point is fair for most players, but not all. Personally i would like to sell a lot of junk which is heavy in my stash but light in my inventory. I have also been hitting 40-200 shops a day looking for plasma grenade and UGL plans to no avail.
---
If your arm is twice as big it will clip through the armor model
---
What i was able to sell so far: good legendary weapons (mainly bloodied and instigating), stims for cheap, rare junk and stable flux, ammo (5.56, .45, shotgun shell, fusion core), plans and recipes (rare ones mostly).
---
Anyone feel free to add me as well. Always looking for more friends! LT_HUA
---
if you have to many caps find a hidden spot and dump em make it a surprise for the next player.
---
Apocolympics
---
Where is his body?  I didnt see anything about that on the wiki
---
I was never arguing realism. To say any Fallout title is supposed to be anywhere even close to real life would be insane. I know I said the word real but I'm not talking about realism in game mechanics. Just the relationships you form with people are real. They aren't 'like' real, they are real relationships.
---
Haven’t heard a concrete answer from devs, but people seem to agree it’s multiplicative.
---
Still bugged along with a few others,it doesn't look like beathesda is interested in fixing this any time soon.
---
right before the reactor room there's a terminal in front of the decom. showers. sometimes its messed up and doesnt give you the option to turn em off. theirs a terminal for each section. of the silo aswell so youl have to hack multiple terminals.
---
There’s a terminal near the beginning. Makes your life so much easier
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info!
---
I really want to go back in time and relive the story. Actually meet the characters and live in that world. 
---
I just want the monorail time machine to work.
---
This
---
I want to follow around a new player and stay hidden while spiking all their enemies with delicious Bloatfly juice.
---
The one you use to turn off the grid when you first enter?
---
You know why some Youtubers hype up Wastelanders as bringing NPCs? because then they can be angry and "disappointed" again because Bethesda didn't deliver what they hyped themselves up for, easy as that, and then you got another shitstorm at Bethesda when those youtubers send their community against Bethesda again
---
flamer chainsaw
---
my mole miner gauntlet
---
&gt;I don't actually think they'd be THAT hard to implement in a purely aesthetic sense
---
Based on... the number of successful and popular Fallout 4 mods you've published? Your track record of shipping AAA games and first-hand, in-depth experience working in a wide variety of different game engines? Or your butt?
---
It's your butt, isn't it?
---
True... third * is less important 
---
... however... 3* weapon scraps for 40 scrip, while 2* for 15.  That’s a 25-scrip difference make
---
Whether it’s worth it depends on what you already have
---
If it's  before the terminal that controls the decom station, I'll  find it.....thanks
---
Ehh. If you take workshops, you're gonna die sometime... usually they just come along and kill your before you can get anything out of it. Hell, we even waved at each other before he one-shot explosive-killed me. heh.
---
Never gonna happen
---
I think the biggest thing is that I work in technical support/customer service. I talk to people all day.
---
When I get home I just want to relax and do things entirely at my own pace, not have to engage in the pleasantries and politeness of conversing with other people (even just stuff like, brb door or brb bio or goodnight everyone).
---
With an NPC I don't have to remember or ask how everyone's families or jobs or whatnot are. I can just be like "Hey Nick, are we bffs?" and he says "Yes" and then I can not talk to him at all for the next 2+ weeks or gameplay if I don't want to, lol.
---
It's the same reason I don't use IM/chat features in various places. I don't want the immediacy of an expected chat response.
---
Reddit and Facebook are more "comment/reply whenever you want". Right now I feel like replying immediately, so I do/can. In 30 minutes I may not, so I won't/don't have to.
---
Basically by the end of a work day I am usually too emotionally exhausted to engage is real human social interaction. If I do have the energy for that, I'll go out with or go visit friends. (And even then I've been known to start zoning out or literally fall asleep on their couch because my interaction energy levels are WAY below my interaction desire levels).
---
Don't feel bad I didn't know about it either
---
Or just Saxton Hale's thighs
---
True, but I figured since OP was asking about which to go for they hadn't gotten a decent from any yet.
---
Yeah doesn’t work. Still attack, I thought bolstering would be ok, but no luck
---
if you plan to pvp, turn it off.
---
I do understand that, but have you tried the bazaar subreddit?  It would be much faster to find something super specific like that.
---
Holstering hasn’t worked :(
---
Yeah, I guess what I mean is if the goofy ass, lesser designed buzzblade isn't a joke weapon, why is the chainsaw? I think they just goofed and left some code out and never bothered to fix it. Thar or it was just half baked but functional and they figured "good enough stuff" and forgot about it. If the Buzzblade can work as a fully featured weapon, the chainsaw could as well.
---
*SPOILER ALERT* If you didn't know, a few updates ago the files of a dog perk were added to the files. So we may be getting dog companions!
---
Wait....you can have more than one active mutation!?!?!
---
I miss the cloned robots at whitespring. That was a funny glitch.
---
Agreed. Still, with Slugger and an electrified mod the Buzzblade is still at least passable as a weapon, even good with the right legendary effects.
---
Ah, yeah, that makes more sense, then.
---
And yeah, that's where we're wanting different things. I'm not looking for the real relationships, haha. Not in my video games, at least.
---
I'm all for teamwork and interacting with other players. I love how 76 is handling that. But as for building long-term relationships - nah. Not my jam at the moment.
---
And keep in mind - only bulk lead and aluminium for more saved weight - everything else is just burning plastic.
---
Whoa, Tachanka is top tier Op, my dude. All new Ops are designed with Tachanka in mind, as he is the poster boy for balancing.
---
Yup. Obvious.
---
Upper road in Flatwoods on a porch with a dead raider. If memory serves me I think it's across from the mobile home. There isn't a stairway so you have to jump the railing.
---
I only sell plans and the occasional booze and outfits
---
Im ok with anything except battle royle
---
Second to this idea if you’re selling armor go for the lightweight versions
---
Ehhhh, no . compared to pre-patch not even close. I'm obviously rooting for all continuous weapons regardless.
---
I miss the unstoppable gunfire sounds...
---
You literally have other people in the game to help.
---
It wasn’t a very good golf course, based on that one holotape
---
If it’s battle royal I’m not logging in again.
---
I bulk everything because where I live, I can farm 100 steel and plastic in 10 minutes. And no one knows about it.
---
break their limbs first so they cant fight back if they refusr.
---
i bought it too and it worked for me, did you click the button to show only buildable stuff?
---
That was a glitch, to be fair. But I think it gave an indication of what could be if the damage was properly allocated on automelee weapons. I feel like someone goofed up a decimal point on all of these damn things because the damage is so abysmal.
---
From what i have seen it is white paint splats. Not sure if there are static or have physics or if they can change color. I have not gotten my hand one what yet but i have seen them used a few times now.
---
Hey buddy you need help with anything?  
---
"Wave emote"  
---
Cool so he doesnt even have his audio on.  
---
Mostpeople do not want help, they want to play the game and do the quests, i do help people when they want it, but those times are few and far between, poeple act like adding human NPCs will take this option away where as in reality it will simply add more stuff for people to do
---
Oh. I just shot him. I was expecting him to aggro me or something but he just floated there talking shit.
---
You can still gain mutations by taking a serum even with rank 2 of Starched Genes. It only prevents you from getting them through radiation.
---
That sucks. I thought they said somewhere that it would mark you as neutral to all other players.
---
I guess maybe it only applies to what they see and not to their turrets/pets
---
Good luck with that theory mr lite machine gun..
---
No I will do that when I get home and test it, I wanted to make sure there wasn't a known bug or you had to buy it in the ATOM shop also. I will follow up after I can test
---
That's what I did here..as my shotgun was doing negligible damage...stayed behind it to escape the blows and was once circling a tree n shooting with the sheepsquatch following me n trying to figure out what I was doing..
---
Requirements as I understand them
---
BOTH : whisperer and Friend perk cards. Max helps.
---
Random spawn creature alone.
---
Level must be half of yours
---
So at your level you wont be taming much.
---
So far , tamed a toad and snaggly. Once tamed they will give and option to goto your camp.
---
They will B-line to your camp. And if they meet an enemy , it can kill is. So best to escort them there.
---
If you meant game mechanics like that, then you didn't need to say anything else 
---
Game mechanics are basically the game itself. So of course you can just say "a game is good if the game itself is good"
---
Love the toxic valley everywhere. That would be my dream
---
Bulk to sell, baby.... LOL
---
I wish developers would continue to improve what they are good at and stop making shitty battle royal a part of their game.
---
I'd rather they do a shared stash across all of your characters. 
---
Then have each container have its own limit, slot wise, not weight wise.. The weight limit is horrendous. 
---
Then have the option to set one to public for those that like to have a box to give stuff away. Usually I have my camp by a container that I can dump my extra stuff in, or I throw it in one of the containers near a train station, either way having the ability to set that up at your own camp would go a long way.
---
Though it's not as efficient as a handmade I love my combat rifle w/.38auto receiver.
---
Since they changed that last patch, I’m OK if someone contests my workshop. I can then decide if I want to fight for it or not, instead of being harassed around the map until I hop servers.
---
Yes, thank you for the correction. I had overlooked serums.
---
But it’ll be an optional game mode kinda like survival? No one would make you play it
---
Hey, my psn name is Alfonze423. I've got a character at level 76 and an alt at level 34. Feel free to add me, though I really only play during the evenings on weekdays, and all day Friday.
---
Ok, I gotcha. I'm not even opposed to raising the cap limit to the point where what the game tells you an item is worth, is going to be closer to player vending prices. 
---
It's like I said before about inflation and all that. Eventually I think there is an appropriate upper bound cap limit. I'm simply saying that right now, because player vending is so new, no one really knows what the point is.
---
But they need to approach this gradually so that people won't resort to spending dollars for items as opposed to caps. If the limit is too high, those same items might creep back up to unobtainable levels and folks will just head to ebay again. I'd really hate to see that happen. My only concern is the inflation aspect.
---
I pretty much run a Wal-Mart like book store. I sell cheap plans and groceries like ammo and chems. If those item prices go up, not as many people will buy.
---
Max armor 'raider' mods replaces the backback. Lower mods do not.
---
Outfits like firefighter replace the backpack as well.
---
I once saw a dead scorchbeast that stretched all across Whitesprings. Wouldn't mind meeting that good boi again.
---
Well im glad i know this now, ive had pharma farma for so many levels, so many hours of playtime, and not once did i know i had to click search.  I just thought first aid chems were super incredibly scarce even with the perk...
---
Grahm is super duper nice!
---
You have to cause a specific amount of damage to get the reward from SBQ and sheepsquatch. I think it's to stop people shooting them once and still getting the loot rewards for very little effort.
---
Exactly, that's how it should be. 
---
Me personally, I get no enjoyment out of fast traveling across the map to kill some guy who has no idea he's even in PvP... then proceed to demolish his camp for shits and giggles. 
---
If i claim a workshop, the player should decide whether to just cut his losses and give up the workshop or come back to defend it. You'd probably even have more fun this way, because it be more of a challenge since you're both geared up for the fight.
---
Your mom is obvious.
---
&gt; the button to show only buildable stuff
---
.... wat. Why am I just learning this at level 65.
---
Np, I had to save for about a week. I farmed nuke zones for flux and sold 3 serums every day to the Watoga vendor bot.
---
Worth it though. That might be the single most important thing when setting up a shop.
---
I never ever remember to explicitly search to activate these perks.
---
I'd be fine with just having Saxton Hale's thighs in general
---
Deep
---
Last night I finally did a solo triple nuke. Did them in order, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and right as Charlie launched got the server shutdown message. Never got much time to explore any of the three nuke zones.
---
Not a dupe. That's an under-run bug. A 16-bit number's maximum value is 4,294,967,296. If you code like a noob, and mix signed and unsigned numbers, you can accidentally "under-run" a number and it wraps around to the maximum value.
---
You pvpd in this game? Job done
---
Instead of suggesting the dev's was their precious time on useless ultra expensive items for"end game". How about we encourage them to make actual dungeons,raids,and events for end game?
---
Alternate suggestion: Remove all the songs except Country Roads.
---
It’s going to be battle royale face it
---
Whats the status is it to late?
---
It will only remove the mutation if you use RadAway without the perk equipped. Other than that, you’re fine
---
i love the ghouls who rush at you while laying on the ground. what a fun new bug
---
If you do turn it off, please don't be that guy who follows my group back from taking a noob to kill sb queen because a stray bullet initiated pvp during that hectic mess and accuse us of "planning that out" so we could steal your junk. K, thanks :)
---
i still get that one. 😔
---
People are twats. I posted asking for help the other day and got downvoted 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Players yeah but not turrets apparently
---
Ehh, I can't complain about people doing what they want with their money, but I supported the game plenty by paying full price for the unfinished mess when it was released. I'll likely buy atom points in the future, but not til I feel like I got my money out of it.
---
I stock a vendor machine with free shit for lowbies (though I'm a bit away from 76). Like free cookies and drink recipes for common shit. Dog food. .38 and .10mm ammo, etc.
---
Still more often than not it's a level 70+ who comes and cleans it out.
---
YOU DON"T NEED THAT STEEPED ASTER TEA RECIPE, YOU JERK
---
It's me waiting for my one friend who plays to get home from work.
---
Works pretty good except for when second one spawns, then its all bets are off.
---
I read the other day that the max amount of shots in VATS is 16.......even if you still have AP left. If true this would suggest that it would be optimal to add scopes to increase accuracy bon low VATS weapons. I have a 25% reduced VATS railway rifle and I run a recon scope on it to increase accuracy.
---
Huh? What? What level are you?
---
Tameable creatures spawn in alone. If you only get the option to pacify then it likely can't be tamed. You don't need Wasteland Whisperer.
---
Dang, I was gonna say the Mire near the Sunken Church so I could have someplace to retreat to when I'm over-encumbered and get ganged up on my glowing mirelurk kings and wendigos.
---
Pc
---
I actually typed a thoughtful reply to this, but I don't think you'll care much for it.
---
I'm more interested in what your goal/motivation for this response was...are you just mad at people on the internet suggesting things? Do YOU have AAA game dev experience and feel personally aggrieved? Is it because you feel I tried to pretend to have game development knowledge? Just love dunking on people for the sake of it...?
---
What's going on here man? Are you okay?
---
Put them in your store for cheap. At least you'll get a few hundred caps. Maybe. Best case is they get bought. Worst is it sits in your stash for a day till you scrap.
---
You guys are always demanding stuff
---
Doing it for 4 weeks straight then caving in and buying it on reddit.
---
That’s why I have switches for both the vending machines and turrets.
---
This is why I turned on pacifist in the first place, so I wasn’t randomly getting shot by people who were taking on the sb queen as well. I just wish there was a system that overrides pacifist if you have a “settlement” under your control
---
Plasma gatling for sure. I've always been an energy weapons guy and plasma weapons have always been the top of that pile for me. First time I found one I just about pissed my pants.
---
How do u get that helmet?
---
Maybe it gets randomized so folks can't build traps around spawn points, same as why welcome mats don't work.
---
If visitors always spawn in at the exact same spot, a player could just camp out and watch for a bit, then build a death trap.
---
Do you live near westek? Cause you can easily walk away with 300+steel and plastic depending on the weapons the super mutants have.
---
Level 56, maybe it's just bad luck trying for the 3\* ranged weapons.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
I think its because most people just primarily go for DR instead of RR or ER.  So then when we get something that gives negative DR we dont feel it, but we get negative RR or ER and oh boy we are feelin it. 
---
I know when i armor my character up i just go for max DR and dont even think twice about RR or ER
---
How about I give you 8k for your Chameleon Recipe instead :P
---
If equipment, weapon and power armor skins were universal, I'd probably spend a lot more on the atom shop. Not too fond of having them only apply to one item most of the time.
---
I've been saving my scrip for the next day when the legendary exchange machines have available scrip, so I can scrap things immediately as needed. I also do this because of some of the bugged items that lose stars when you log out.
---
Hmm do you have enough disk space?
---
Also are you connected to internet? Might be trying to download updates and stalls trying to connect.
---
South of Pleasant Valley is a good area for high traffic. 
---
Around Whitesprings is great.
---
Anywhere between 76 and Flatwoods is great for traffic too.
---
This is great! Hopefully I can meet up with some similar players. I’ve been to Japan a couple of times, if you haven’t visited do it!
---
play thru the story and get over level 50 so you can continue to participate in new events and future events in case they’re level-locked (ie 50+). 
---
read reddit to find out what is rare and valuable.
---
explore. explore. explore. 100% of the cry ass bitches on here have missed out on about 99% of what is actually in the game. i’m over 850 hours and find new stuff all the time when i slow down and take it all in.
---
Nope. Only have to contend with a dozen or so level 5 scorched to farm steel.
---
They can also time out on you
---
I love repair kits. As a low level I never had the resources to repair My guns so me completing quest to earn atomic money then buying repair kits without me spending money has been great. As a low level u really appreciate little things like this that make you Adventure just that much more fun. I've recently just gotten to level 25 and finding  out I can repair my power armour with the kits has just made that much more better. I for 1 hope it never leaves. You have it reasons and I'm not judging but from a young player these kits has made the game more efficient for us.
---
Yeah everything checks out, everything looks fine with it. It Just won't stop installing
---
I'll friend and keep an eye out for you, i pretty much just roll 3\* armor
---
Good to know. I think I’ll just keep Star he’s Genes equipped until I can actually afford to purchase the recipes.
---
Thanks for the suggestions.
---
So when you say play thru the story, are you saying not to do any of the side missions and just work my way through the story?
---
If you and some friends shoot them more than one can spawn for a single enemy :)
---
* Do the Powering Up Poseidon event in Charleston three times to get the plans for the Large Generator, the Windmill and the Fusion Generator
---
* Collect and scrap all unwanted weapons and armor off of enemies to acquire mods plans for the scrapped weapons
---
Lmfao
---
Come on - Mum Gibbs is nice.
---
Just to clarify for anybody not understanding the post, # used to mean pound before social media took it over.
---
I'd say trying for any kind of roll with less than 40 scrip left is risky nowadays. You can get an assaultron head that you should immediately scrip, you can get wood armor that you should immediately scrip, or you might get something you really don't want to hold on to.
---
OR- you stay on your toes and kill them first and take THEIR caps
---
Serious question: why are the robots who are trying to kill you (but you can't otherwise interact with) not considered NPCs, where as these raiders you propose who are trying to kill you (but can't otherwise interact with) are considered NPCs?
---
I figure it's better to keep them for the 40 scrip than resell, maybe I'm wrong though.
---
That's a good point, just gotta be more patient, I suppose.
---
Nope. It was there, thanks. Maybe just a random bug? I'll try again tonight and see.
---
Specify: animal friend and Wasteland wisperer target different Kinds of creatures ( Deathclaw and snallygaster for example).
---
As mentioned they need to Spawn all alone and must Not be in a Fight Scene.
---
Good luck!
---
Took me two days full of hopps to get my First Deathclaw.
---
So if other real life flesh and blood people don't want your help why should we simulate fake people as wanting your help?
---
How is calibrated shock less effective? Can you only carry 46 per leg instead of 50?
---
Awww, they got rid of the peak out of cover? Damn, that is what got me through my survival mode run. 
---
Do you mean buttery as a good or bad thing?
---
Yeah... so when no one beside you knows it then it's good additon for anybody else. Thank you.
---
More like 50 less total.
---
Thanks, yes, I thought of that too, and was going to say 18-20 stash weight item. That was a bit too wordy for me ;)
---
If it allows you to queue with your friends, and has the concept of guilds or clans as factions with suitable rewards it'd be pretty cool. 
---
It'd be a an optional way to play the game differently.
---
Do you only have one leg modded? Are you missing a leg in PA?
---
And everything was under full repair
---
Yes, thats how things hapoen in a game and dont happen in real life, we simulated an entire nuclear war vecause it doesnt happen in real life, this is the point in games, to experience something other than your tedious day to day real life
---
We all have those moments, mine was power fisting a low level player for his 5 cap bounty. I was polite enough to wait for his loot bag to appear  then dropped off 2 stims as an apology
---
Obvious, though.
---
I dont see why they dont have atom points sales. Like if I could buy the full package at a limited time for 50% id do it.
---
Just explore and enjoy the atmosphere. Visit other player's camps. Pick up everything and don't worry about building a camp every time you're full on scrap just to scrap and dump and keep moving. That's how I play and I've had a good time.  Hell I'm level 70+ and I sometimes still drop a camp just to scrap stuff, even though that means I'll need to rebuild...
---
Why do you have two power switches at your garage?
---
This is false. You can shoot in Vats as long as you have AP.
---
I will buy all of your screws at that price. All of them.
---
lol this game has a lot of little details
---
I did the same. Dropped stims and radaway
---
My character also looks more human than me.
---
Right, but you only need Animal Friend to tame. There's no need for WW unless you want more pacify options.
---
probably, still farming materials...
---
Ohhhhh I like this.
---
All depends on what issues you're most likely to let upset you. It's not a perfect game by any stretch. It's still got bugs, it uses an old engine that can show it's age more often than you'd like.  However, if you're the type that can happily come back each day, do your questlines, occasionally drop out if the game completely, get concerned your system isn't up to it once you wander into your first nuke zone, and still enjoy yourself regardless of any of the state if it. Then give it a try.
---
It's cheap enough now that it's not a huge outlay it f it doesn't  meet your expectations.
---
I wonder if doing that with a gamma gun could make it go even faster? Dropping max HP while poison does it's work.
---
Is it just the one slider for all sensitivity like in 4, or can you adjust different things like vertical sensitivity and horizontal sensitivity separately? 
---
I know in 4 my sensitivity was almost maxed out because general movement felt slow and rarely used vats.
---
Thank you for your response yo
---
Any tips on good armor that I can find fairly close to noob level?
---
Can we get [this](https://www.bing.com/search?q=useless+device&amp;FORM=AWRE)???
---
Theres a canvas bag?
---
Yes! It would give me a reason to use my Heavy Golf Club
---
Fallout Wiki says different.
---
"V.A.T.S. will only allow up to 16 shots to be queued"
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_Assisted_Targeting_System
---
I'm pretty sure that many would like to see how they handle their own given challenges.
---
Damn, I used cover fire all the time in survival mode since I never liked using vats.
---
Some one made a 25 page checklist on here for all plans.  Posted it back in December
---
Who knows, might be the same as the usual vending machines if they can maintain stability, just all about what they can do without compromising playing quality
---
I think I found my first partial power armor frame in a mine somewhere south of the Vault? Some people don't like using it, but I won't go without the stuff.
---
Ye thinking time to day good bye to purveyor.. keeps giving me crap .. been having better options from player vendor shops
---
Put a in ground safe in the ground an then build a foundation on top of it. No one can get to it
---
Obvious nice indeed.
---
Gamma gun is the vastly more efficient way of doing this, yes. You can kill someone with rad damage, and the gamma gun does far more damage, with a much higher RoF. It’s only downside is it isn’t the slightest bit stealthy.
---
Yes!
---
Like nuka world lot of missed opportunities.
---
I thought you couldn't use power armor until you were a certain level?
---
That's badass
---
Will do
---
Sounds good
---
Nope. Both modded, and both legs in place. It was so odd I went back to base and examined the PA on the rack after the event. Everything looked like it should (protocols and shocks in the part names, nothing but a sliver of damage on the helmet not really needing repair).
---
Does it feel like Fallout 4’s third person aiming? I occasionally used it in 4 because I liked looking at my character (he was a sexy beast of a man) but the aiming was pretty awful in third person. Hopefully it isn’t any worse in 76.
---
Not a problem I do sometimes as well.
---
Another question that your suggestion brings up.  You say "just explore".  By this do you mean that I should wander around aimlessly?  
---
Did you play through the story or did you focus on side missions?
---
Havent noticed any issues across the board. Although I’m usually in T51 or T60
---
I mean they had bags...
---
Apparently down again.  Been acting unstable and now unable to log in.
---
Good to know. I really liked my T60 and probably should have kept it.
---
This!!!!!
---
I believe that mag is one of the few I’ve checked off, I’ll check when i get home. The chemist syringer challenges are broken afaik.
---
That's a good reminder for me—spend some caps fast traveling to a bunch of player vendors. I've not done that in a while.
---
Been playing since beta. Killed 3 flat woods and 2 mothmen. Still get hyped when I see one.
---
I expect to get mine late as hell since I didn’t even get my power armor edition until early January. (I moved to Guam literally the same day it came out so I had to wait until I had an address set up to have my family ship it out to me).
---
Fucking hell. This.
---
Ballistic Fiber is one of the more rare materials
---
The fun/funny glitches aren't really much of an issue so idk why they even bother patching them when they should focus on game breaking glitches/bugs. I've always enjoyed the stupid glitches that causes bodies to stretch or freak out.
---
If you witnessed your carry weight only for up by 50 instead of 100 with both sets up calibrated shocks on both legs, then there is something definitely wrong.  Under 20% health does your pipboy show Emergency Protocol active under the effects tab?
---
I did whatever man...  One day I climbed to the top of the hill with the pig on it and built a camp...  some days I followed the Overseer's breadcrumbs and some days I scrapped everything in the whole goddamn town.
---
The tac armor from the atom shop? If so it is considered casual under armor, the protected and shielded mods for casual have not been located in game/were not included in the game.
---
There are some lower level sets...  I think it was 20 or 25?
---
Good ideas.  Thanks.
---
i've spend a healthy stack on this game so far... Probably over 100 dollars (in only atoms)
---
hate me for, it but i love the game, have spare cash, and am eager to support games I love
---
[Indeed.](https://hubs.mozilla.com/DmE2ADB)
---
Didn't know you could check it in the Pipboy! Wow! I'll do that. I'll see if I can trigger line in the Sand again and check.
---
If you only do main story line, faction quests etc, you'll get your money's worth. 
---
I've been a fan of Bethesda games for decades and I've learned how to be patient with them. It often takes them a year or so to get things straightened out.
---
The vast majority of story lines are pretty much bug free.. if you're an inpatient gamer with high expectations and are prone to frustration, hold out. If you can be patient and grow with the game, you'll have something worth absolutely playing
---
What about armor that isn't necessarily power armor.  
---
For instance, what are some of your favorite outfits that add some damage resistance to your character?
---
Yes please
---
Wouldn’t mind the increase. Would prefer that perks affected stash space though. I know it’s far fetched. Would really like a stash space that transfers to all characters in the account. Maybe in white springs a locker that works for all your toons. So we can swap out gear fast and without help.
---
This is great. Need more of this and less “should I play this game.”
---
I still wear a mismatched set. I have some overcoat type outfits that I wear to hide my shame...  but I just wore whatever until I got into power armor and then spent most of the midgame not using any personal armor at all. It's too heavy to be worth it in PA until you can get light and ultralight build stuff.
---
I've seen other casual under armors shielded for sale. Not sure how, but its around.
---
Maybe they removed/bugged the drop more recently or its a restricted item?
---
for some reason I read that as "rusty trombone" O\_o
---
Do they stack?? Also, Nuka Grape.
---
Had this same glitch happen to me with a full stock, took me an hour and a half to relist all 120 items. I about had a heart attack when my vendor said 0/30 luckily it just sticks it into your stash so it's just an annoying bug.
---
Well, boo.
---
It could also be the animation for alcohol or chems wearing off.
---
I'm Blob man fear me...
---
I don't pvp much, but I understand your frustration. Theres quite a few small changes they could make that would make the game much better
---
When I first heard this area existed I really thought this would be something we could do in-game.  ️🏌️‍♀️⛳️
---
Cool! Thanks for the info, I have to look for it :)
---
Sure, but shouldn't we try to simulate things that make sense. If real people don't want your help I would argue that you are helping with the wrong things. People have needs that need to be met and whatever you are offering it isn't it, otherwise they would be welcoming help with open arms. 
---
Asking for NPCs to throw help at really seems like an egotistical argument to me in light of the above statement. 
---
Game experience also isn't that black and white, for some people it quite literally is the day to day tedium.
---
Appreciate that man, PS4 unfortunately
---
As a 5.56 user, if someone is selling it at 1 cap a round I just buy it all.  I bought 5000 rounds from a guy today, just because it was 1 cap and I really don't have anything else to spend money on.
---
5000 rounds will probably last me a week, assuming I participate in a few Scorched Earth/Project Paradise/Free Range/Encryptid over the weekend.  I have full rifleman perks and an anti-armor/explosive semi-auto handmade.  It's amazing how quickly I can burn through 1000 rounds.
---
OR don't take workshops and then don't whine about what boils down to a completely optional confrontation if you stay.
---
You've earned an upvote.
---
Maybe.
---
They do stack, and gotta love that grape
---
Yes I've had this problem. Seems to happen just after I login then immediately fast travel. I think there may be some initial time limit that you cannot fast travel within. I just wait a minute and works again. 
---
Of course I could also have no idea what I am taking about.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Dang, that sucks I can't mod it, it looks so cool for my character
---
Wow I need this in my life.
---
No, and if you are as young as you appear, please play games aged for you and continue learning English. This is not to be mean, Fallout isn't for kids exactly.
---
Is it working yet?
---
Along with the axes/hatchets, but a lower passive bonus compared to the chainsaw and ripper.
---
Oh how I would love to but unfortunately that’s a can of worms I don’t wanna open here haha. But yes! It’s on my to do list. I found that playing in the am helps a lot!
---
Maybe PC dev room? If not let me know I'm very interested.
---
Don’t speak for me, hombre. I used best friend Xbox birthday money to buy me some sweet atom shop light fixtures.  No ragrets!
---
As I said, they target different creatures. You will Not be able to tame a snallygaster with animal friend.
---
But I think we are meaning the same Thing.
---
The Whitespring shop Live Chic sells them.
---
Yeah. Lots of these OPs. What's with the young people these days?
---
How did you get 0.5 seconds as reload time? That doesnt seems possible to me. I measured about 4 second reload with speed demon on both weapon. Therefore the .50cal beats the LMG on term.
---
I’ve been doing this since about february. It gives a ton of advantages as a “solo” player, especially if your machine can handle running two clients simultaneously.
---
In a container. Don’t remember which one.
---
I did a wee google search, post here on reddit was crediting a particular exploit way back when for it. Guessing it got duped and is being sold on the "black market."
---
Then maybe they should not have built a new bag from the ground up and instead take an existing model that is already on the market and well received and then contract with the markers either for supply and modifications to the stock or get the bags off them and they take them to another company for refitting.
---
Also, these guys did it you can buy this right now if you wanted  [https://www.merchoid.com/product/fallout-all-in-dis-order-messenger-bag/?aelia\_cs\_currency=GBP&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwitPnBRCQARIsAA5n84k7tyWy2TnipSrh8cVX791IAX\_S9qxQPfZP5dwHPnsqir3bUya6bOoaAovgEALw\_wcB](https://www.merchoid.com/product/fallout-all-in-dis-order-messenger-bag/?aelia_cs_currency=GBP&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwitPnBRCQARIsAA5n84k7tyWy2TnipSrh8cVX791IAX_S9qxQPfZP5dwHPnsqir3bUya6bOoaAovgEALw_wcB) and its licensed so Bethesda knows about it why are they not distributing this bag i wonder?
---
At this point, the profitability of the bag is out of the question its a case of not losing more face over it. Will anyone want to touch a Bethesda pre-order for the extras again because from watching the bag thing with my standard edition made me fairly sure I wouldn't be buying anything above and beyond from them any time soon and the likelihood of me changing my mind on that goes down with every couple of posts like this I see reminds me that those poor fuckers are still missing the bags they paid over the odds for.
---
Oh yeah. Very much worth it. Totally worth it. 100% man. 
---
You can take my opinion as fact here and use it to completely change and shape your opinion
---
I’m hoping it’s more a large scale pve survival than BR
---
Eh. I didn't like it when they came out either, but who cares. The outrage died out almost instantly. People who don't like them simply don't buy them, people who do like them now have something to spend atoms on. There aren't any downsides when everybody comes out in the same state or better. Its current implementation isn't great (repair kits have perfect potential for an end-game cap sink) but it's good enough. Even though I've never bought one and don't use them, I'd say overall they made the game better than they would have been without it. I for one would prefer bethesda improving the game over religiously sticking to an empty promise from before the game even launched
---
I'd definitely dislike the game a little more for changing my appearance. I like the level of realism it brings with a small touch of some out our world stuff. But still all within reason of a nuclear apocalypse.
---
The data to fast travel seems to be farther down in the load list (like, at or near the end), so you'll have to wait for your game to finish loading until you can travel.
---
I don't know if that's a designed control (I can't think of a particular reason why it would be needed), but it seems intentional.
---
My ticket is open and I was assured recently that it's a WIP and all that fun stuff. Considering they were accepting tickets up until May, I don't really anticipate much news much less the bags themselves for a while. Initial ticket said "4-6 months for completion" so maybe closer to September?
---
Tldr: Soon(tm)
---
I've uninstalled the game and thrown all my devices in the trash *I missed the last maintenance downtime :(*  I just don't think it's worth it anymore, I mean, canvas bag, even though I never ordered one and bought a digital key I'm inconsolable. Sending this from my local library PC. 
---
I wouldn't bother coming back, you've missed so much now already I doubt you'd catch up, just go back to MineCrafT or TeTriS. Use your saved effort to open more beer and Cheetos. Enjoy!
---
Lol...I'm old :(
---
I haven't tested it, but the majority of other gear that stacks percentages stacks multiplicatively. 
---
Of course, you can't get better than 95% no matter what.
---
I think OP is referring to the weight of the weapons not the level. In some cases # is substituted for PSIG. I haven’t seen it used for pounds though.
---
I kinda miss ghouls running at you in trashcans
---
As someone who likes trading and dealing in legendary gear, I'd like some sort of interface to interact with other traders/arms dealers in the game.  Using subreddits like market76 is cool and all, but it would be nice to be able to bargain in real time with other players.
---
I wouldn't mind the vending machine if there was more worthwhile stuff to spend caps on.  Even with the stuff I purchase from other players, I'm still usually sitting on between 10-20k caps at any time.
---
If the legendary vendor had a random three star mystery item for 1000 caps a roll, that would be something I'd burn a lot of caps on.  Considering the popularity of legendary items, I think that would be a tremendous asset to stabilize the game economy.
---
Even if all types of armor mods were reliably sold by some vendor for 500-1000 caps, that would be huge.  Dense torso mods are like unicorns, especially combat armor, and mods for scout armor is a server hopping extravaganza.
---
guys your opinion on winter death land?
---
You can tame everything with just Animal Friend. I know, I don't use WW and I've had deathclaws, snallygasters, mirelurk kings.
---
The birth of a raider right here
---
That looks amazing! I like how each section is a reflection of the wastelander who owns it. Very well done!
---
He’ll aggro eventually.
---
Yea a while back i was stuck on that then they made it easier to find and i completed it 
---
It took ages for the fault to be corrected when they did it worked 
---
Id say youve done the quest and disnt notice
---
It's also a game for folks who aren't racist, belligerent idiots, so you need to shove off as well.
---
There's always one. Had some one grab my junk more times then I want to know during that event, I feel violated
---
The game atmosphere and the hope of finding that one weapon you desire
---
Yeah, makes me want to have splash damage back.  I'd kill them for that even if it wasn't my stuff.
---
I thank you good sir for the entertainment
---
Are you part of some gay beat-up club, I mean, *taking peoples junk when they die* O.o
---
No they must be caught in the wild
---
Well ya because I don’t care that much for the “quest” in 76. I’d rather just roam the land.
---
I have a 10mm sub and a rail rifle with it,and it's so accurate in vats it feels like cheating.
---
:-D
---
No not at all
---
And that...*brrp* that's why you never put ultracite waaaaay u-up in your butthole, Morty
---
Stop lying you only left because of the server maintence. Here's a reason: the server maintence is over
---
You can have all of them at the same time. Except carnavore and herbavore. Once you get one if those you can't get the other.
---
Or traded between your own characters. 
---
This is an Atom Store purchase that basically can’t be used as intended. 
---
Needs to be fixed.
---
Happened me too it was a paint to restock but i finally labled the meachines ans sorted stock properally
---
But recon uses .308, Its not modded by default with the. 50 receiver.
---
The Brotherhood recon rifle comes equipped with the following modifications upon crafting.
---
Hardened receiver
---
Stabilized long barrel
---
Aligned stock
---
Stinging magazine
---
Short recon scope
---
Suppressor
---
I'm on PC so can't message or I would. Not having the ability to message people in a online game is serious wtf status
---
A gold plated Corvega roadster to put out in the driveway.  It doesn't even need to work, because it's just there for show.  That would be a post-nuclear midlife crisis on wheels.
---
It’s the component view screen. It is supposed to show how many of each component type you are carrying between scrap/junk and let you tag components you want to look for. It’s a super useful feature, but some of the values are currently bugged and show ridiculous values.
---
Btw, is MoleMama already in the game? Because I can't find anything on internet saying where she is at
---
All that would end up happening is people doing stacking foundations to bug abuse and hide their stash with no risk; bad idea.
---
Sheesh. 
---
Do a search. 
---
My two cents worth: if you're so weak-minded that you're easily swayed by the folks who complained that the game was broken and beyond redemption, then go play RDR. 
---
If you're open-minded enough to trust the fact that tons of people are still playing it, then why are you even posting the question?
---
Yes please! Or instead of golf balls how about live grenades!
---
Now I has the sads.... :(
---
Karma will fuck you in the arse. I stand on top of their bag and wait for them to come back, so other people can’t steal their junk.
---
Is this directly west of  Snnytop Station, a bit down the cliffside? I think we may have capitalized on the same C.A.M.P&gt; location :)
---
Well they wanted to already have them out to you but they got ganked while they were farming up the mats.  Now your bag is that sock at the bottom of little Billy's drawer.  You know the one.
---
Agreed. It could be useful to boost CHR for sales n stuff.
---
Happens to me a lot, I click my chosen FT location and I get dumped back out of the map and nothing happens, takes a few tries before it activates. Just one of those buggy things.
---
Never once said race or trolled. Games have age recommendations for a reason. You are the troll throwing in race.
---
Explore the world. It's awesome. 
---
Only fast travel if you have to, in order to get to an event. Walk everywhere else.
---
Same, I got downvoted for asking if I get the atoms as well as the bag. People said I was being greedy for wanting both, lol.
---
Can someone explain this too me. Is this a mod for the syringer that spawns bloatflies?
---
Thiiiis is why I go to CAMP first and dump junk, then loot after the event.
---
Damn, you've seen through my impeccable ruse! (All joking aside, I haven't actually played yet today. Lmao)
---
Side missions are the stories. Follow main roads and railways. Complete the quests while exploring. Play the zones for level: first the Forest and at level 15 go to Toxic Valley, and at 25 go to Ash Heap. Savage Divide is the start of the endgame at level 35.
---
I think you can get some extra badges from the dailies and campfire tales event unless I misread the guide
---
I can make you marsupial. Name: Voidforged. Won't be on until later tonight, though.
---
Last couple days this has been an issue for me.
---
Are you really trying to reignite that faux outrage?
---
Personally, I was in it for the helmet instead of the bag, but I do like getting exactly what I ordered, so I'm on board!
---
Totally agree - but I'd like one that could be at player CAMPS as well
---
😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂
---
Go to the military wing of the Enclave bunker. In the command room where they have the 4 posters explaining the nuke process there's a red terminal you can use. One of the options on that terminal is to locate a key card.
---
A mini quest will pop up, and the nearest cargo bot will be highlighted on the map. There's a 1-2 hour cool down per server, so if you want to collect more just server hop and trigger the quest again.
---
I’d like that. Especially as my toon wears the winter jacket outfit.
---
It is, and they totally should. I’ve lost a lot of personal respect for Bethesda after all this. They’ve gone from a business I fondly support to just another corporation I inevitability have to deal with if I want to play some games I enjoy. 
---
But a canvas bag ranks pretty low on the “going to court” spectrum. If I dropped $12k on a copy of fo76 that came with a cosplay-ready suit of t-65 power armor, and I got a little pop toy instead, you’d better bet I’d never stop going after Bethesda.
---
But a canvas bag? At this point, There are bigger fights worth getting into, and it’s not a hill worth dying on just to make a statement about how bad Bethesda is. It just seems so petty now.
---
the side missions are the story, just as someone said above. unlike other FO games, side quests won’t last so long that you forget where you’re at in the main storyline.
---
Good advice, best way to spawn interesting encounters with all the creatures out there. Fast travel simply bypasses so much of the game, useful sometimes for specific needs,

I wish they did. I have most of them but they do not visibly change anything
---
Yeah they can. I didn’t really think of survival though because if I played survival I’d take the stuff out of the vulnerable 200 stash space to keep it safe.
---
a tail would be more appropriate
---
Yep! It’s a barrel mod that requires 10 Bloatfly glands. Does barely any damage but ‘infects’ the enemy so they have a high chance of spawning a Bloatfly upon death. The type of Bloatfly seems to vary depending on level and area but it’s possible to spawn Legendary Bloatflies when using it! It’s a fun gimmick of a weapon.
---
How many players did you find that were "walkers"?  IE, hitting caps lock to slow their movement while searching for things?
---
I'm a walker when exploring new locales and when sniping enemies in cramped interiors (the burrows for example).  Walking makes me super quiet and I can literally crouch right in front of a lvl 62 ghoul as it walks by and my \[  hidden  \] meter barely wavers.
---
Campfire Tales and the 2 new daily quarts have a 25% chance of dropping possum badges. I have 7 of them and I haven't completed a single actual badge achievement.
---
Make me a mother fucken ghoul
---
Just now online, went into swarm of Gutsies, NO emergency Protocol, no calibrated shocks in Pipboy. Clearly marked in list as Protocol and Calibrated though....strange, strange.
---
&gt; Why would you play a game that isn't "good". 
---
Read the words as they were literally put down and in context. I didn't say it wasn't good. I said it wasn't "that good" in relation to the comment about Todd saying that it was a "fabulous game".
---
It's an ok game, which is good enough in my books to play. There is no way in the world I would characterise this game as "fabulous".
---
&gt; Facts? What do you mean by "facts"? Is there some objective way of measuring "goodness"? What are the units? How do you translate them into length/mass/time?
---
It's almost like you don't understand the concept of data and statistics, or more specifically in the case, reviews scores. That's just one of a multitude of metrics one could employ. Were the stats available, you could go by current sales figures, concurrent players and so on. Review scores are sufficient to indicate how the facts don't support this game being "fabulous".
---
Yes reviews are subjective. Yes they can be skewed (you probably overlook the fact that some ratings can also be positively skews, even for this game). However, with enough of them you can get a pretty good bead on this game at least not being seen as "fabulous" in the eyes of the general gaming populous.
---
Would you like to start over with your comment?
---
How do you square that with the fact that the ghouls, scorched, supermutants, and mole miners all exist in humanoid-yet- distinct form
---
I’m down to play. Add me: NSFWnate
---
There should be appearance mutations and skill mutations.
---
Started working on a new base last night down by Lake Eloise in the area with the little acid cave. 3 hours later i still have a ton left to do on the camp and the field nearby is littered with scorchbeast corpses. No Bueno!!!
---
Nice!
---
I would pay if they were Atomic Shop skins :)
---
im at level 54 and still learning things that are essential to success.  youre not alone.
---
Thanks! The best part is all the wastlanders are based off my character builds and people I have adventured with in Appalachia. I felt it would be a diservice to them if I didn't capture their quirks.
---
Congrats 🎈🍾🎊:)
---
You have to click learn on plans / recipes to be able to learn it and craft them.
---
&gt; 
---
You have to scrap weapons and armour to learn mods.
---
&gt;
---
Scrapping all junk and storing it in a stash is what you should do with junk.

---
Not at all. If I purchase a weapon for 100 script and dont like it I can spend 25 more to try again. Only once and you are stuck with your second choice. They aren't out that much. If I leave the transaction or buy another item I lose the reroll option.
---
h
---
This is the best f'in song on the entire FO76 soundtrack!!   Butcher Pete for PRESIDENT!!  :D
---
Surprisingly no, but I will have to check that place out always looking for new areas to build camps in. Mine is located at the top of The Crosshairs over by Whilly Willards.
---
You're a better player than me. I'm level 7 and need all my perks to survive.
---
If you found yourself quitting out of boredom. Then definitely come back. The game has loads of new content all connected and they’ve add more lore. If you had quit do to game quality I’d say leave it where you left it. They’re has been a good deal of old bugs released into the game. Along with more frequent server disconnects and the texture glitch they keep ignoring. It can make for a rough game play.
---
The mutant legendary should stack with more mutations you have.
---
It's almost like they designed the game in the most backwards confusing way possible. What should happen instead is whenever a player loots the item, play a simple on screen effect and sound. (Similar to the perk that gives bonus XP sometimes).
---
That's awesome news, better start grinding
---
Yeah you only get 1 badge from those challenges  but you can definitely get it from campfire tales which is an event that can be started every time it get dark or do the daily cleaning toxic waste or collecting the bugs parts one. From my experience, you don't get the badges all the time though and  it *feels* like you have a 10% chance for it to be given as a reward. 
---
Side note: when doing those 3 events, when you get the badges it won't tell alert you with a text above. But when you complete those event, you'll get a small caps reward and it shows u with a "C" with your current caps being updated. Well when you get the badges, the "c" will be replace with the possum badge symbol
---
I sent you a message.
---
Yeah it's a bit ridiculous. Some dataminers have indicated that PA has hidden % damage and rads reduction that applies well before the dr/er/rr numbers you see in stats. So even if you get 300+ rad resist on regular armor to match that of lowest PA (excavator)... you're still nowhere near the same resistance.
---
Look for folders, notes, recipes , cause they are everywhere, especially kitchens, garages etc....
---
They are valuable once you find a CAMP spot for crafting.
---
&gt;We’ve probably murdered all the nice ones already. 
---
Literally anytime I've come across one of the special NPCs - any players within distance go murder-spree like the moment they aren't buying something from them or getting their own insult note.
---
Kinda annoying and it's why we cannot have nice things
---
Im on now if tou want to play took a little break
---
Same as the pistol, just server hop at the cemetery near the fort until one spawns
---
A "Find the Hidden Bar" sign on the standee might be enough for folks to know there is something to look for. For me, the biggest this is that if I don't see something that clearly indicates something to do, I inherently assume it's just someone's house. I might explore a bit (it's in my nature), but nothing in depth enough to find a hidden room I should think.
---
Ah yes thankfully I know those
---
Don't worry, there are plenty of much bigger mistakes people make. Here's a small list to prevent future accidents:
---
Perks like pharma farma, scrounger, etc are not passive. There is a "search" keybind at the appropriate container that makes a roll for whether or not you will gain something extra. 
---
If you find a box with a bunch of loot somewhere, it's most likely your own stash. Any containers that a player builds at a camp connect to your own stash. Don't try taking it all and fast traveling to your camp just to find out your stash is now mysteriously empty.
---
Even though it says "read" instead of "take" when picking up a plan, it will not actually read it. You have to go find it under notes in your inventory and manually read it.
---
If you're trying to collect something specific that goes under the junk category, be careful about scrapping all. Some items that are useful in the game, like bloatfly glands or radscorpion stingers, will automatically be scrapped. On the topic, there's a bug right now where bulked junk will also be scrapped, so be careful of that until they fix it
---
More of a griefing issue than game issue, but if some low level comes up and starts smacking you around, don't retaliate. There's most likely a level 200 with a bloodied explosive laser rifle in the corner that's part of their team that will one shot you as soon as you enter pvp
---
This was already posted. Maybe you can go read the reply. You know have ended your purchase when you go to sell it. You left the purchase. It is no longer a reroll and now becomes an entirely new purchase once you go to the purveyor. A reroll has to be the same turn. 
---
NounEdit
---
reroll (plural rerolls)
---
(dice games) A situation in the rules of certain dice games where a player is given the option to reroll an undesirable roll of the dice
---
Same, some odd bug with the audio. Doesn’t do anything harmful
---
Its another studio, and in no way small one.
---
You seriously think this is a three man operation run from someones living room? 
---
They got millions of dollars
---
I think that by "visual" they may have meant the high jumping of the Marsupial or the cloaking effect of the chameleon...
---
The houses were intentional, renting out property to bring in more money to the resort, which was doing poorly. The robots were also a cost-saving measure, or possibly something by the Enclave to ensure nosy employees didn’t stumble across their bunker.
---
My son finally told me, when we were nuking. I ran outta stims and he asked if I had Pharma Farma on when I farm. I told him I never saw a difference. "Mom... you know you gotta press the space bar right, like when your collecting meat." I gave him a stare and finished the nuke. Later that night I was rolling in chems.
---
Damn straight! The Brotherhood needs to know whom to purge.
---
I quit playing 76 every. Single. Day.
---
sounds good!
---
When it first happened after I clean a place, it scares the crap outta me as I frantically thought something spawn behind me and about to hit me lol
---
When Im farming I use the 3 level card. Its very nice. All my overflow I sell at the vendor or my C.A.M.P.
---
It's not. For 25 script it gives you a chance at a different weapon from the same level pool that is it.
---
The ammunition on the cores changed a bit. [It appears the old way was combining cores](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gatling_plasma). Now it'll use the highest capacity core. That core then carries it's own capacity so you'll find it again if you reloaded early. Additionally, the cores ammo read 0-100%. A Plasma Core ammo is 250 shots per core. So 1% is 0.4 of a shot's worth.
---
I would sulk. You'd have people with one mutation using the skin of a different mutation, most mutated people looking normal and some normal people looking mutated. And the game would sink further into the mire or fortnight skins.
---
Yeah, anywhere between 22.1 and 24.5 and i'd be happy
---
...Ummm, Grahm &amp; Moo-moo can only walk so fast. Keep ur knickers on.
---
This, exactly this.
---
I would buy more if I had more CAMP budget to play with. I hope they focus on it and get some awesome cosmetics for us to spend on.
---
LOL genius.
---
I hope this time we'll be able to build Eyebots. And I really hope they bring back the voice files from New Vegas, I hate the eyebot beeps in Fallout 4 :/
---
Ooofta!
---
I found someone with a backpack, and just asked them over the mic.  Or you could message.  However, why do YOU need to injure them? Are you doing a revive a dead teammate?
---
My revivee used the dogs outside Flatwoods.  Slow death which gave me time to team, accept her shared revive card, and revive.  I had never teamed before, so it worked well.  And really confused a bystander who just stared at the underwear clad woman being used as a chew toy as I stood by lol.
---
Check to see online if the codes are up and match them to the silo your gonna run. Check the server your in, make sure there's lots of high level players to help you fight, most still go because it's compulsory for some reason like the encrypted event
---
Pvp is fucked because of your PVERS complaints
---
Indestructible camps in pvp only happened because of the whining from pve players camps getting destroyed
---
I am open to trade to. Add me in game, same ign than here
---
Savage. I felt bad enough just shooting it once and hiding the rest of the fight. This is a whole other level of evil.
---
Well I’m a raider
---
It depends on your style. A lot of seasoned players will drop off bags of weapons, armor, health etc, which is great. But to enjoy the game, I recommend taking your time and explore. You will find a lot and have a lot of fun. In the end, play the way you like. It’s your choice.      :)
---
Fallout 76 is a multiplayer game, if you want a pure pve experience go back to Fallout 4
---
TBH I always have trouble finding the most up to date one.
---
With a name like Katz, I was expecting a deli that served delicious, gigantic, non-pork based sandwiches.
---
They had this bug awhile ago I thought it was gone. One way people solved it was taking the armor out and transfer all the parts off. Then putting them back on.
---
I think they got rid of it getting it that way
---
I am too but damn...lol
---
&gt;1 level 50 assaultron that gets the jump on me, however...
---
Cripple head, left arm, right arm, and then at least one leg.  They'll self-destruct.  If you take out the combat inhibitor, they'll go blow up their friends.
---
I been rubbing my cards under my armpit and licking them...no wonder they're not working!
---
They shouldn’t bring their junk to the event
---
I mean people took rare weapons and armor out of the dev room. Like laser muskets
---
Have an explosive lvl 25 up for sale
---
Wake up with a pipe gun, 5 rounds and a scorchbeast circling you.
---
No! No soup for you!
---
Well at least you can shred some cheese.
---
I think they prefer the idea of humans, even though robots are infinitely deadlier than stupid raiders.
---
They should make a quest/challenge wall requirement for additional weight to prevent the initial issue at hand which was duping. Then give them requirements like level caps etc. It would add additional content to the game that people would want to do and if the requirements were high enough, like level 50 with preliminary quest requirements, then any duping mules would have to actually play a lot of aspects of the game to obtain the additional weight, not just create a new level 1 account and have all the weight unlocked.
---
Nope. Not at all. They can take their time with this one. I love being insulted by a super mutant about how small and weak I am after I just exploded him into pieces with one hit.
---
good to know.  Some of those challenges are quite annoying to do lol.
---
I haven't bought atoms yet but I'm sure I will at some point. I received the game for free with my console and I'm having a blast. Wouldn't mind throwing some bucks their way.
---
Don't forget about New Vegas, I feel like the western country songs would fit pretty well with some of the current songs and since there's a good amount of songs that are somewhat country/western, they'll fit very well together.
---
It’s just a pain in the arse to get the licensing for the songs. For some games, let’s take fifa for example, they have the rights to have a song played on their soundtrack but, if you upload videos or stream fifa when the song is playing, it can be claimed or muted. So I believe it’s a mixture of Bethesda being too lazy to find more songs that fit with the themes or, not wanting to deal with even more possible upsets from the community
---
I didn't see any until about 30.
---
This minimum damage threshold appears to apply to most if not all enemies.
---
Fable was the best about this; the more evil you were the more evil you looked.
---
The bugs one definitely lol I usually try to do campfire first cause most of the bugs spawn during that event and I been keeping extra bugs part in my stash just so I don't have to keep running all over the map lol
---
It’s like the mysterious stranger, only better!
---
It's well worth using a few levels to experiment if you have 3 agility points for the perk.  Each shot throws out something like 7 pellets and each pellet can cripple.  Even if you're not doing a lot of damage because of distance, you can still cripple something to the point of harmlessness.  
---
For a good time, nuke the Whitespring and blow the arms off of an army of glowing ghouls.  It's super easy with enforcer.  Then if you want slow zombies, cripple a leg.  Make your own horror movie.
---
This was even after they offered both.
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with that. It's your money and you should spend it how you see fit.
---
Have you tried just not killing anything?
---
hard to tell when it's not cross platform.
---
Well good luck there pal .. I don’t carry any and if I did it be straight into my stash
---
I've seen him twice, always give him something and run away.  I just feel kinda bad for the poor fellow.
---
The second time I saw him, I gave him a piece of raw fertilizer and a dish rag.  He took it, so I guess the jokes on him.  If someone else shot him later, I'm sure they got a grody surprise, assuming his "loot" persists.
---
&gt; More of a griefing issue than game issue, but if some low level comes up and starts smacking you around, don't retaliate. There's most likely a level 200 with a bloodied explosive laser rifle in the corner that's part of their team that will one shot you as soon as you enter pvp
---
I'll keep this in mind thanks. Haven't had any issues with other players yet which is fantastic cos I don't usually play online multiplayer games.. I don't have the patience to deal with all the shitheads. However the few people I've met have been really friendly! Actually going to buy a mic so I can communicate better.
---
If I remember correctly, the musket became available at level 30, with the pistol becoming available at 20-25 I believe
---
This is where the chainsaw used to really shine, before melee weapons lost their 100%+ bonus.  I mean, you could pretty much rubberband the trigger and chew through them.  Luck of the Draw + chainsaw = chance to proc for every tick of damage.
---
idk why I never thought of that lol.  Thanks for the idea.
---
I do enough damage to them to kill them long before I’d ever cripple a limb. It’s not killing them that is the hard part, it’s surviving the face laser spam. If they shoot me before I shoot them, there’s a good chance they’ll kill me. They are the only non event monster that can do that.
---
Yep, you just have to hit the right arm.  I don't think you even have to cripple it.
---
[Everyone disliked that.]
---
I think this has happened so much during scotch queen events - with the loss of hardened mass, raw flux, etc, that revenge squads will come after you if you’re egregious about it.
---
Took me a long time to realize where in the world all this weight was in my inventory but, alas it was plans I didn’t read in my inventory. Don’t quite get how paper can be half a pound but hey
---
I totally agree!!! That would be a really cool addition!
---
"Dead game" my ass
---
Limited time one must be better :)
---
Did you push left and right to change the version
---
In 450 hours I haven't met a person like this once, but I've seen so many posts about it that apparently it's an issue somewhere, for some people
---
I live in ohio but i play on pc :(
---
Oh man though, I had so much fun messing with extra mini nuke ammo during Fasnacht.  I was picking up probably 5+ free mini nukes per event, and had tons of fun playing with the Daisy Cutter, lobbing nukes to the horizon and making people say WTF in their mics.
---
Beach boys tho
---
You can still get them, it's just a low chance. Feels like it's something like 10%. I didn't get any from about 15 camp fires and then I got 2 in a row.
---
As someone said further down,  Berkeley Station
---
When you say "affordable", what price specifically do you have in mind?
---
So take them all off the frame when on the rack, then putting them back on?
---
That would be super helpful
---
This is a licensing issue beyond what they can afford/prioritize.
---
Exactly what I'm getting at bruther :)
---
[Raider Noises]
---
Heh. 
---
Btw, now that I have a commando build, I’m now making ammo for him on all my alts now too ... in addition to the fuel I already make for another.
---
Fast travel to Harpers Ferry, when you spawn go left there is small house very close to you, inside is black powder rifle, pistol, ammo and tomahawks. Ppl don’t really pick it up anymore so it’s easy spawn.
---
I plan to later this year when it comes to steam pick it up
---
I've only got about 2500 caps total at the moment  since I'm not sure how to farm them
---
I think this guy missed the joke.
---
I'm pretty sure we'll see a soft reboot where members of the factions that fled the plague return.
---
500 caps is a perfectly reasonable price. Don't be greedy.
---
I believe it works as an additive, based on the multiplication of the traditional accuracy/range/vats usage. In which the 33% just adds your original value to itself times .33
---
Rockets, and cement and crops. Keep crops in range of the rockets away from your more important junk. They always go for crops and get taken out by the rockets. Keep in mind your rockets will do more damage to your crops then the enemy does.
---
Bundle is different, choice is yours...
---
Oh ok cool
---
Rad x disables ur mutation no matter what but, rad away gets rid of mutations until u get starched genes 2
---
Scum
---
That's what I'm trying to find them for. The ones I found were 4000 and not even the ones I'm hunting for
---
Not really
---
Awesome, thanks for the run down, sounds cool.
---
I didn't know what this "night is too bright" business was all about until I got a TV that has 4K and HDR.  I turned on all the bells and whistles in the PS4 and suddenly night time and underwater swimming are as bright as daylight.  Turn off HDR and it's super dark again.
---
Cool, but you’re bringing up things I’m not even discussing in my post. I’m simply trying to bring some insight to the manufacturing process and timelines. 
---
Bethesda should have done hundreds of things differently, but that’s not the point of my post. Take your rage to someone else’s post that’s actually talking about your above comments.
---
Just don't wast ur points on crap. If there is nothing good bank ur points up. Think about what weopon u really enjoy using and focus points on that. You can't max ur player out like in previous games. U only have 50 points. So let's say u like hand guns, focus ur  points on making them more powerful, what else do u need to survive? Water, food? Are u a lone wonderer? Or do u like to team up? Be smart with what u put ur points into for u don't wanna get to 40 and think Fck I've wasted my points on crap and ice only got 10 left!.
---
No. Your a dick. There’s a huge difference.
---
Wow.  Two thumbs up for persistence!
---
Sheepsquatch aren't particularly easy to put down, even with a god-roll rifle.  Encountering one in the wild usually comes with an alternate mob, like super mutants, that will attack it and create a sort of damage buff.  You'll know what I mean when you attack a somewhat durable enemy, like a deathclaw with other hostiles or another player around.  The damage rubberbands from what you'd normally be doing to a "buffed up" state that's something like 33% of your normal DPS.
---
I typically take out the easier to kill enemies and then start shooting the sheepsquatch when the tertiary hostiles are dead, so I can deal full damage on it and waste less ammunition.  You can also just tag the super mutants, wait and let the sheepsquatch do all the work while the mutants do a bit of damage on it, then kill the squatch and loot all the corpses.
---
Bugs and game freezes are a part of FO76 unfortunately. I've been playing since December and just got used to it. Some days it's better but when it starts bugging out I just chuckle.
---
I used a couple workshops last few days and I have people pop in to play the event and go on their merry way afterwards. 
---
I did have one guy kill me outside an event  (lvl 98  to my lvl 27) but either my half dozen turrets chased him off or he just did a drive by killing and kept going.  Didnt claim workshop or kill me.
---
I did come across the hemlock workshop that was amazing setup and after I wandered around getting ideas on the layout and components used to build I noticed it was unowned but all the stuff was there.
---
I claimed it and to my suprise everything that was built was still there.  I thought once you logged it all disappeared.
---
In retrospect, the most fun I’ve had with 76 was helpful messing with others. Good old days of running around naked with a police cap dropping ballistic fiber and what not to unsuspecting and suspicious players
---
Lol probably someone's bag who got killed there
---
Can't get that pretty card till lvl 30 though
---
If I am playing a raider, I could do stuff like that
---
Escape Artist should put you back into Caution for sneak damage bonus.
---
Thanks a ton! I'll research it.
---
You guys usually don’t realize what you’ve become. 
---
Sad really.   
---
Stealing hard earned items from people fighting with you is a dick move and def earns you the title of scum bag. 
---
Your the kind making people think it’s ok to tag queen and hide so they don’t get ripped off. 
---
Serious part of the fo76 problem.
---
I was kinda expecting that the purveyor would have a talkative body-guard (or some other companion) that would add a little bit of a story around how/why she came to the surface. A bit bummed she didn't. All it would take would be 2-4 voice recorded lines.
---
The bundle contains a Power Armour station paint. Seperate, the bundle and paints would be 1400 (PA) and 700 (Station).
---
Unsubscribe from newsletter.
---
It happens so often that crashing is part of my daily login routine. FT to train station to get my daily caps, sell legendaries at the scrip machine, FT to murm, crash, log in, get trash, start playing.
---
I agree with that, I'd rather it be only if you have said mutation. Otherwise it's just makeup.
---
They're the only monster that sends me running for cover.  That laser is way overpowered.
---
GTFO  mr.sandman,boodie woogie man, my echo my shadow and me, don't wanna set the world on fire ect. Lol no sir fo not suggest such things
---
Charlston probably the best to find level 5 to 15 lvl players so you at least build something for them since it's hard to build anything for a 5 and under and high level players go there to look for the random vendor so some costomers to sell off your more expensive wares.
---
oh well. Are you on ps4? I have adrenal reaction, marsupial, healing reaction, twisted muscles, talons
---
Asked this question a week ago, then went and bothered Bethesda about it, got a response back along the lines of, 'Not shipped yet, expect a confirmation once they leave factories concerned'
---
Allow us to sell/trade the Improved Repair kits, I have so many I never use and I feel dirty just dropping them.
---
Response menu?
---
Exactly, nuka colas have been duped to hell and back already, don't reward these guys with special unlockables.
---
I quit doing them. Only have 1 badge. Already got the backpack mod anyway. Waist of time
---
looks like my vending units an FN mess
---
I think I have mine around 550 or so and Speed Demon @ 666 caps because it amuses me. When you can sell them to any vendor for 450-500 and theres a 10% tax on vending machine sales, it's kinda silly to go below 500 or so imho.
---
You're the one discussing the op's fluency.
---
Only PC sadly, but I appreciate it
---
The few hours I spent wandering around in that exact ensemble, the amount of WTF interactions, area chat comments and PVP encounters were unprecedented. Part of the vid here @[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfEAalHg7so&amp;t=1088s)
---
Yeah I thought about that but it really doesn’t fit in the same way. The tone of New Vegas is completely different than 3 and 4, but 76 is closer them than New Vegas
---
Yep, I got sick of SB attacks so moved back to the forest. Machine gun turrets will kill any forest mobs.
---
Sbq lots of violet and crimson but usually harder to obtain mass and fluid to stabilize. Harpers ferry lots of violent and crimson some cobalt, plus great at getting mass and fluid. Whitsprings, useless yellow then crimson and florescent and small amount of cobalt, lots of mass and fluid.
---
Fluency is not race. Typically foreigners mix up word placement, not letters in a word. We are done here.
---
"i need cloth, got dammit"
---
There's a lot of cool areas near watoga but I kno my camp would get destroyed
---
That’s such a shit excuse to fuck people over. 
---
Gimme a damn break
---
Yeah that's also true, 76 has kind of a mix of the type of NV's music and 4's music. Like you'll get Butcher Pete but then also Ghost Riders in the Sky on the same radio.
---
No. Nuka colas have been duped to hell and back, while caps still hold some minuscule value..they shouldn't be used to unlock special ATOM shop items.
---
My character would be one weird looking mess.  It would be either funny looking or a hideous monstrosity. Let's do it!
---
Yeah, but preferentially, the 3 and 4 soundtrack is more “fallout”
---
Marsupial changes appearance. Or at least it used to.
---
Agreed.  It's not like it's easy doing it on ps4 either.  I get that they wanted us to use voice but give us the text as backup at least.
---
I agree. Charging 500 instead of 550 is a favor I do for my customers.
---
I think that's the right idea... as long as people have the right expectations (suggestions aren't instant, they take time and would likely b part of wastelanders or later), suggest away.
---
I find Scorched to be a very rare legendary to begin with .... there were lots of raider and gunner legendaries in FO4 .... why so few Scorched Legendaries?
---
That's... a bit of a leap of logic.
---
Nope its still doo doo bum bum fart shit./s
---
Mr. Bandit?
---
It's graphic takes up alot of real estate on screen when firing .. it's heavy it's consumed a lot of AP in vats and it has low damage .. it's inferior
---
Auto grenade launcher and 50 calibre machine gun
---
Ar is weaker and the mods aren’t as good overall
---
Yeah, you can respond with emotes during trade, price too high, etc
---
Thanks! I hate it!
---
no but I had the game on in the background while I was working from home and it didn't crash once all day
---
Yeah, so I have a AAE Handmade and 3 levels of tank killer so 50+36= 86 percent armour penetration so if they have a hundred armour when I shoot they only have 14
---
You can do it with the perk on or off. As long as you have the serum. I just did it literally five minutes ago an it works fine. Just don't take the perks off an take a bunch of radaway. Then itll disappear. I had marsupial, an took the healing factor, an isotope, with strached on an class freak an it took it fine. But don't take rad-x it surpresses the mutations, making them null an void. Try to find anti-radation armor, or have plenty of glowing steaks or blood im not sure. But one of them give 75% resistance to rads
---
You can pick from a pre-selected group of answers. Mark something too expensive stuff like that.
---
I love going into peoples camps and stripping down to my skivvies,  that I've been warring since feburary.  I had one guy drop a gresser getty up.  Lol to funny
---
Damn, I would've considered coming back if it was only doo doo bum fart, but doo doo bum bum fart shit is too much for me. :(
---
My buddy builds these incredibly high wooden towers at all his workshops.  They're a simple 1x1 floor and rise up probably to the height limit of the workspace.  He uses marsupial and a jetpack specifically for creating these insane structures.  At the top is always shuttered windows with a stuffed bunny in the middle.
---
I also have a picture of another of [his bizarre workshop creations](https://imgur.com/0Z9HS4u).  I felt like this was culturally significant, because I'm used to seeing his towers, but never saw this new brand of his madness.  On the outside it just said "hut" in neon letters.  As far as I know, he's not Japanese.  He does live in San Francisco.
---
Come back. Next day!
---
I was thinking of switching explosive to this. I mean first shot headshots are like 45%; with this it would be 70%.  Double damage is better than 25%, especially in pvp.
---
How about a suggestion that increases server stability? How about a marketplace?  
---
Created as a "game mode"- so it is on its own servers-  
---
Keep it small, something like Top of the World  
---
Allow many players (\~100+)  
---
Larger stash, hopefully in the thousands  
---
Can be used to transfer items to mules (mailbox)  
---
Allows for direct interaction between players, thus buy and sell  
---
Allows for market information, maybe some kind of ticker for average prices  
---
I have had this idea stewing for a few months but never seem to find time to flesh it out and post it-   
---
we really don't need any more server strain, I mean, I am not sure if anyone else has noticed how laggy and quirky (getting pushed out) npc vendors are since the introduction of player vending but i sure have
---
found 800 steal last night in a bag at WS on my way back from lucky mine with 500 worth of lead ore on me, almost a lucky day except i sold all my cloth earlier in the day.

---
Interesting. Didn't notice it yesterday
---
The fart shit is really what's stinky.
---
What are you planning on doing with your canvas bag once you've got it? You've had half a year or more to plan out all of your "carrying very small things around with me"-related adventures. I bet they're pretty big dreams!
---
it's server lag it happens
---
Oh Heavy Explosive, I thought you said Heavy/Bloody.  My bad.  Still might be a good starting place.
---
The AR' drum mag has around 1/3 of the Hand Made capacity.
---
Cgs on fixing it, however the bug is present for us on English clients as well.
---
That's perfect
---
I always dread when the server crashes because  all I can think is “What did I lose and how much do I have to repeat?” I have yet to launch a nuke yet. I’m waiting until I get to level 50(I’m three levels away)
---
I have marsupial for 300c on pc. DreddedOne
---
Lemme check my stash... alright, I have one each of Healing Factor, Marsupial, and Speed Demon. I can do 499 for each individual one or 1200 for all three. 
---
I'm on PC, name is Street-Samurai. Will be online for another half hour.
---
Yes but instead of a golf ball you use ghoul heads.
---
This bag better come with some rum because it's driven me to the bottle.
---
Withcraft
---
Lots of people use the small letters set like a message board at their camps. If they would reduce the camp cost of the letters it would be more useful.
---
Glad to see it’s not bugged and not just me. I started a new character and have spent over hour and half server hopping wavy willards and no luck. It never took this long on my main character awhile ago.
---
How about a giant Scrooge McDuck style cap vault statute?
---
The only advantage the AR has is that it is easily accessible and as such you have a way better chance at learning the mods for it faster.
---
But the Handmade is far superior to the AR and the Combat Rifle, and it isn't even close.
---
Absofuxkinglutely
---
Well rejoice because tomorrow is gonna be............another week without the handmade skin.
---
hop around i have seen them as low as 250C but you are doing good at 500C
---
Deal! I may be able to make it online in the next 15 minutes or so hopefully, currently stuck waiting at a college.
---
Robot duels! Place bets! Win caps! Lose caps! I would turn my camp into a robot Arena.
---
Is it finally safe and can I still submit a ticket to get mine? Or is it too late? If so, link plz? #DuffelKerfuffle #WillIStillGetDoxed #IWishIWouldHaveJustBoughtTheRegularEdition
---
Come to think of it. My camp did load in faster
---
Again.  You kids see an excuse to be vile and you jump in it. 
---
Shows your total lack of character and it’s not a valid one for screwing other players over kid.
---
Sticking around after dropping the item triggers more dialog.
---
Why have ham when you can have bacon?
---
So you want people to be able to pay real money to get better legendaries than others who can't afford to buy atoms to exchange for scrit?
---
Exactly zero walkers, going by the given description.
---
I think it has to be hatched from one of the eggs the mirelurk queen spits out.  She doesn't do it very often.  If you go down to Sunrise Field in the Bog and see the queen is diseased, it's likely her spawn will be diseased.
---
What if you had a golf ball ammo-type where you could "load it" into your gold club and shoot it by  power attacking it. That would make for a badass roleplay weapon lmao
---
As annoying as those posts are it is nice to see people coming back. Not saying I missed them, but glad to see the game ticking in the right direction.
---
I’ve been kicked at least ten times today after the maintenance.
---
I put a message on my vending machine with the small letters to message my gt for t60 paint jobs since i know them all. Nobody has done it yet tho haha
---
Lol more than you would expect in 76.
---
needs to be flat.... oh boy did i just start the never ending crazy fuckers conversation
---
I logged on this afternoon and got stuck in my own foundation for the first time. It spawned me in on the opposite side of my camp from normal. That had never happened before. I had moved the CAMP unit a few days ago to keep visitors from spawning in on top my acid producer but that had only made a minor change in my spawn point.
---
Made $1.2M+ in Caps, own everything and can buy anything, this 3* farmer is rich and getting richer by the minute.
---
I think they might be referencing the changes to C.A.M.P.'s being made indestructible. Originally when the change was mentioned in this subreddit by one of the Bethesda community folks they said they were looking at changing pacifist mode to make your C.A.M.P. invulnerable. However when the change was actually implemented it affected everyone, not just those running pacifist mode.
---
Could also be referencing the removal of "slap" damage (small damage capped at something like 5 health/second that you received if getting attacked by a player without initiating PvP), though again that had nothing to do with pacifist mode.
---
It's the ugliest weapon in the game and does less damage than the Handmade which uses the same ammo
---
It'd make the quest worthwhile. Knowing everyone's dead destroyed this games story. I like reading and listening but the story blows because you know everyone's dead. Rose sounds awesome but guess what it's a fucking robot whoo hoo. I can't believe they thought I'd be a good idea without human npc. This is a cash grab and Todd even knew it was trash when they released it. Bethesda could've made such a good game but they're using the live service bs to patch/excuse what little of a player base is left.
---
That wood flooring is beautiful
---
For me I've hated the Assault Rifle since its inception, just looks a bit whack and its underwhelming in its performance. In FO4 it as mostly a cosmetic choice but it carried over.
---
The rewards often aren't worth nuking the queen. I usually only do it when a few friends are on anymore. I used to launch nukes daily. Glad you to hear it went well for you.
---
Interesting.  I find it odd when I see people sprint across my kitchen area in my camp to get to my vending machine.  It's literally 4 floor tiles away.  That fraction of a second makes a difference?
---
Then again, I also wonder why drivers tailgate me when I'm doing 80+ on the highway.  I have guesses, but if you don't have anything nice to say.......
---
Same here, I do heart of the enemy every day, though most days I just have to collect Scorched beast DNA and go to University.
---
But I haven't been able to start Queen of the Hunt for months.
---
Wait what?
---
Probably just trolling around not caring if he dies tbh.
---
There are dozens of you! Dozens and dozens and dozens....
---
Only if there is still a chance of being attacked by packs of ghouls and other stuff while you attempt to play.
---
I use a shotgun and rank 2 of Enforcer to cripple their legs. They are pretty easy to death with after.
---
Yep implying some are entirely aesthetic
---
I was just asking a question Jeez, chill out.
---
A well fleshed out companion system would make up a lot for the lack of NPCs.
---
Or nuclear explosion effect
---
How much per serum?? I need adrenal reaction and healing reaction
---
Woah you're the only one
---
This was. The queen that I had just killed was diseased. This was the last hatchling. I killed everything else specifically to leave this one alive and let it munch on me until I caught it. Never happened 🤷‍♂️
---
Given how stupidly easy those Dailies are, 60% would be way, way too high. I just stock pile a bit of bug parts then grab radroach meat on my way up to Dally Sods. Kiddie Kabins one seems bugged it keeps leaving 2 Mutagenic Waste in my inventory so I only need 3 then fast travel back, 2 minutes tops (even without this it'd be easy peasy). Tales is a joke unless people intentionally ignore Kindling at the end.
---
Don't forget it doesn't unlock until level 30
---
Cause they're shamelessly looking for clicks.
---
Try, try again. I had like three spawn biting me constantly for at least a minute while fighting the queen. It seems like a very rare disease.
---
Crap. I just got a good gauss Rifle and didn’t think of that. Class freak should mitigate most of that though right?
---
one of the most sympathic (sympathatic i dont really know) posts that ive seen so far :D if you are on ps4 and need some help feel free to message me 👍🏼
---
I saw somebody mention they may be worried about griefing using the mats, which I could very easily see happening (if your guarenteed to spawn in a spot trap CAMPs would be super easy to design, though people seem to be good at it right now anyways). Not sure how they'd get around that.
---
No -don't come back.
---
People dissed on fallout 4 and guess what i pre ordered and played for 6k+ hours. I don't care what people thinks. I play because is just what i want to play, when destiny 2 was said to be bad i still bought it and played not because of reviews but because i didn't have a console to play the 1st one.
---
Like 1 cap gunpowder is extremely easy too find and get
---
1 cap per unit.
---
Really common and seems to be the price I see it at the most often.
---
THANK YOU
---
It will yes
---
Technically it’s an energy weapon even though it shoots a projectile. So yea.
---
My trader can't pass up the refrigerated backpack. I also did not read the fine print. My trader obviously runs good/w salt, which isn't supposed to stack with the refrigerated backpack mod, therefore 8 possum points wasted. But wait! Beth made sure it doesn't stack with the 1st lvl, and the 3rd good with salt, it does however still work with the second level. Massive payoff till they fix it.
---
The reputation for the game is set there's no changing it no matter how much it improves it will always have that stain.
---
It spawns [here](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=119) inside in a display case there are buttons on the walls to open them
---
Also we never found the overseers body, it's just implied that's she's badly wounded
---
I only have speed demon. I wonder what that would look like.
---
No, stay awa from my loot you commie fuzzball.
---
Nope .... I want people to be able to get Atoms with Scrip and Caps.
---
Totally the opposite.
---
&gt;Eh, I feel like if he came back with a friend who tried to sneak around me while he smacked me in the face, he was mad. It's the Fo76 equivalent of that kid who starts a fight, gets beaten down, and goes gets his brother lol
---
Poor performance and higher weight
---
I agree about the griefers. They are cockroaches who need to be squished.
---
Somewhat relevant question....   how do you get mutations? I have 2, but cant seem to get any more.  I've tried (with Starched Genes OFF) swimming, drinking, eating, environment....still just those two Ive always had.
---
Spooky!
---
right, I get that part but there was mentioned about camps that are in out of reach area's as well and I added to that on how to FT to them. Sometimes it does not work right away, as for things like this happening,  I have seen people log out, not there anymore but if I click on the ground where they where, their names comes up even after hours have past. Its fairly rare that this happens granted but it might be somehow connected.
---
I’ve never seen one bring a *** friend. I did the SBQ earlier today and we got three extra SB opponents during the fight. I went through 1000 rounds of 5mm (hunter explosive gg) and 300 rounds of 5.56.
---
One is to power the whole base (lights, generators, etc) because I think it looks cool for it to suddenly light up when I load in.
---
The other is temporary, its a keypad for the garage and thats because Ive gotten into playing the survival mode and theres no real easy way to look the garage from other players.
---
One thing I learnt is don't expect your character to be perfect. You stop getting new points at level 50 but then you can start changing points and getting new perk cards to really mould your play style so if you select cards that are useful now don't fret sbd regret it later because it isn't permanent. I didn't realise how much I messed up my some of my perks until about level 54
---
Got to be the ugliest weapon in the game.
---
Lmao ... omg hilarious.. got me in my feels lmao
---
Forget that. I want those damn cymbal monkeys as buildable camp decorations.
---
I'd love to have a semi steady stream of plastic,  I run out of shotgun ammo too fast
---
L I G H T W O O D L A M I N A T E
---
Guess I need to cure myself of it to get the full wallop of the Gun.
---
Amazing lol
---
Hahah Ive been there before, my friend mentioned it while I was building, maybe I could do something like that with my alt
---
I’ll be on this evening.  IGN is MortisCorpus.  
---
I can make them all, and stock them all for 300 caps each.  Feel free to toss me a friend request.  I should be on by 9PM PST.
---
A buddy traded me 500 shotgun shells for a nuke card.  That supplly lasted me a day and a half.  I just bought another 1000 from some dude,  time to farm some kills
---
1 cap
---
A serious question from someone who actually has recently decided to come back without outside input -
---
what's the grind like these days? I came back to build a store and I will probably start going on junk trips again to stock it.
---
I know there's some new dungeons and stuff.
---
What kind of things are people up to these days? Last I knew it was just nuking Whitespring and killing all the zombies.
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda Support, have heard of them doing refunds on accidental purchases. Can't hurt at the very least.
---
If you are on PC we could meet up and trade. I only use shotgun ammo because I run out of others. If you got 5.56, I'll do 1:1
---
OH YEAH! I was going to give you aid items actually, I found it funny though - you were my first ever encounter in the gamemode hahah
---
Sure but I'm not moving my house off of the back 9.
---
Thought it was considered ballistic? Certainly takes damage increase from my Rifleman cards
---
It makes us feel invested in the world. It's more immersive. 
---
We aren't just exploring a long abandoned mine... We are visibly helping settlers recover and resettle! ThanksWe aren't discovering the last recording of someone.. We are actually talking to them! We aren't just slaying super mutants... We are protecting innocent people! 
---
It makes me feel more like a wasteland hero
---
Well hang on. I have a second character that’s a stealth sniper with a Gauss. With the Class Freak perk I barely notice the difference. There’s some damage loss sure but I can still one shot most things with the sneak bonuses and other buffs.
---
If prepared food didn't spoil in a vending machine, I'd buy all the cranberry relish you have.  Wait...I worry what you just heard was.....
---
These posts and the 'I am finally stepping away from Fo76!'  posts crack me up.
---
Did you do any during the beta?  If you did, you’d have to make a new character, or keep going until you reach 50 post beta.
---
I don't know about all that,  but I have a dead scorchbeast following me and dropping from the sky when I fast travel. 
---
Also I have a bear(forget the spelling)  that is floating mid air in one of my camps and I refuse to move my camp on that char because of it.  Kinda in my wall hugging the ceiling,  it's a conversation starter
---
It took me forever to figure out butcher's bounty wasn't passive because the mongrel dogs I was killing after I got it drop 2 meat so often.
---
I made this character on release day
---
Are they painted with atomic shop skins?
---
Ps4 my dude.  Funny though,  cause I use 556 when I run out of the others lolz
---
You've played for 250 days? That crazy
---
That would probably be the cause.
---
Yeah, they are. Does the prevent you from exchanging?
---
How much do you need?
---
Mods make the game even better.
---
That’s what I would do. 40 scrip is worth more than 2-300 caps to me.
---
5.56 is my main, 10mm and .308 are my secondaries, shotgun is tertiary and the rest I'm just stockpiling until I level up enough to use some decent guns (or trade/sell)
---
Did u max the 150 allowable scrip? U have to wait 20 or 24 hours if u did
---
Yup. Or trading/dropping/scraping.
---
Except the edition was advertised WITH a canvas bag. It was blatant misadvertising.
---
yea just paint them normal
---
The one that makes you a wendigo?
---
except this really won't address the problem- the problem isn't lack of "cap sinks" (outside of not having to buy anything except for ballistic fiber occasionally and even that could be farmed)  
---
The problem is rampant cap generation- unless and until they address the ability to create 2000+ caps daily *with ease* nothing will bring inflation down
---
It'll only cost you 1500 atoms in the shop!
---
I have also been thinking this.  I just really hope robots will be viable for stealth builds
---
You’re kinda correct. The game counts it as an energy weapon though it does ballistic damage. The mutation says it reduces “energy weapon” damage. It’s a little bit of a weird gotcha situation.
---
Thanks for the help. Do they give you that warning or is that just a figure it out for yourself type thing?
---
some mutations were suppose to alter your appearance, but like alot of things it isn't in the game yet because they released this game unfinished.
---
Ill have to try and add more of my food to my vendors.. if I dont eat it all beforehand, at least
---
looks familiar actually, I was a few in so its hard to remember
---
Ewww assault rifles
---
It gives a big warning if you try to drop it, it won't show up at all in Vendor/Bench/Scrip Machine menu at all. 
---
Good way to prevent ones self from losing something they're attached to.
---
Actually, what I'd like is the ability to buy atoms with caps.
---
Its probably because the bag thing was a huge meltdown point on this sub when your comment indicates that ppl that got nylon really didn't care enough to submit a ticket to get it replaced
---
Yep. It was beyond frustrating.
---
Drop lock and loaded for blocker, the only gun that really benefits from it is the LMG due to the small mag size.  You’ll want class freak with all those mutations, I’d drop chem resist and aqua boy for it.  You’ll lose 15 hps but that doesn’t really matter.
---
For me it goes shotgun, fusion cell,   then 556/45, 10mm. 308 and 38 I sell or give to low levels as I pass by
---
Yeah and the clarification on this type of thing is extremely lacking in game unfortunately. 
---
It'd be neat if it took advantage of both energy &amp; ballistic perks but the thing is pretty beasty even stock, so I can see why they didn't.
---
Not everybody, every person that put in a ticket and followed the process of getting a replacement.
---
Might start using 308 though cause I damn near bitter using the lmg for the first time
---
How about driving golf balls at a crowd of feral ghouls?
---
Because VATS is not a guaranteed hit..so it increases the chance by 33%
---
Hello, I am buying the game tomorrow, i was going to ask the same but i hate being a burden to pro players. Add me ..@silenthunter97-d or smth like that, the one with a weird guy lookin.
---
you guys have to put them down in the camp system under misc
---
Diluted rad x doesn't suppress mutations
---
Nuked Whitespring, I get tons there.
---
I cannot unsee this.
---
You can use diluted Rad-X and it won't suppress your mutations. I think it is supposed to, but it doesn't.  I use it in nuke zones all the time and my marsupial and healing factor work just fine
---
Board games have it, and can sometimes be found in a good quantity. Think there is like 4-5 on the second story of Whitesprings, another handful at the cabins north of Top of the World
---
Yes - would love this mini game but after they implement fishing. That’s my big dream mini game
---
Yes.
---
But it gets better. The game considers the Radium Rifle an energy weapon too.
---
Not that I would use a Radium myself in a game where everything has the 'radiation immunity' perk  but still... energy.
---
Either way this is one of the reasons why I shelved my Gauss and went back to my trusty Lever Action.
---
I had to cure Grounded and have 'Batteries Not Included' equipped along with Bandolier (is a 'hybrid' rifleman/commando build).
---
It fires pellets ffs, pellets.
---
It is also the same weapon, down to the meshes, textures and animations, that will be used a couple of hundred years later - give or take - in FO4 as a ballistic weapon.
---
*sigh*
---
Thanks for sharing a question I've had. Which is can I have more than three. 👍🙏
---
Going thru their support is saying to get ahold of Playstation support to refund the atoms.
---
Oh neat, so if I enable pacifist mode I'm essentially invulnerable to pvp is that correct?
---
I wish I had that much time to play!
---
Welp, gotta log off now, sorry. Good luck though, looks like some other folks here have you covered.
---
Plenty of challenges are bugged atm. Not sure about achievements as in ps/xbox achievements, since on bethesda.net we don't even have those, but I would assume those are directly tied to the in-game challenge so any broken challenges would equal a broken achievemenet
---
This is my first guass (TSE). With all the rifleman perks maxed out, demo expert, and bloody mess, I’m only getting about between 450-460. Is that about right?
---
That is kind of balls, sorry to hear that. Must've been PC players I had read on here.
---
Which is exactly what they're getting from this post
---
I don't think so. I got 2 a couple days ago
---
500 caps but I'm off for the day
---
Good idea but I doubt it would be implemented, bethesda has a lot on their plates
---
22 days later still broken!
---
Bet
---
The what?
---
Or just wait until wastelanders dlc comes out, when they will likely be adding a fuckton of npc's into the game :)
---
