The last 3 patches have been incredibly unstable on the server end. Also loads of graphical glitches with the lighting and textures breaking worse than any game I've ever seen!

---
Hey uh.. If the Enclave plasma damage boost is going from the current 10% damage boost (from the regular plasma) to 30%, and the regular plasma gun damage is getting a 30% damage boost..
---

---
Doesn't that just mean both guns are doing to do exactly the same damage? Plus you know, I think we're only talking about an extra 12 damage if it really is 30%.  Doesn't seem like that much of a buff.  Again.
---
Against that first car on the right?
---
Me and my fianc√©e currently share a console. Fingers crossed my new job pans out.
---
So many games we'd love to play together!
---
Oh thanks
---
I understand and it's been submitted multiple times, it's missing the 4 additional attach points.
---
From fighting others in top 3, I know for a fact that you still appear on the map while crouching. However, I'm not sure if you appear on the map while undetected.
---
On PC?  
---
Just pick them up in game, buy them from vendors, they can be found!
---
What is your username?
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can help you get the last photo you need. I finally got the courtyard one by standing 2 feet to the right of the statue and taking a picture of the front of the college.
---
Beer quests get tedious in my opinion. The camera has issues but if timed correctly I was able to complete the weekly ‚Äútake photos of other players‚Äù in like 4-5 pictures.
---
&gt; You speak as if there is a grand plan of balancing in place, of which there is zero evidence.
---
First of all, just no. Please try to pay attention. I am talking about what *should* happen, not what *is* happening. More importantly... obviously there is a fucking ‚Äúgrand plan of balancing‚Äù, because that‚Äôs half of what these frequent updates contain. The game is constantly being rebalanced.
---
&gt; What there is evidence of is knee-jerk reactions to very specific instances where a sector of the playerbase has gone 'dis OP plz nerf'
---
Then you‚Äôre not paying attention. They‚Äôve nerfed legendary effects that were legitimately too strong, they‚Äôve nerfed watoga so you can‚Äôt cheese legendary farming, the real end game etc etc. Maybe to you these look like knee jerk reactions, but then again maybe you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
&gt; ...while most of the drive is applied to pressing on with whichever timetable the devs have and are lagging behind, whatever is left in its wake unacknowledged and unfixed be damned.
---
Here I actually agree with you. They seem to be sticking to their gameplan, despite the very rough start, and it seems this has caused some issues to go to the backburner. This is very unfortunate, but ultimately beside the point. It just means they‚Äôre busy. It certainly doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt try to address those issues in time. That‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
&gt; Either way my selfishness or lack thereof is rendered mot at this point, the change is coming and that is that.
---
Right, but remember we‚Äôre not talking about how you are personally upset. We‚Äôre talking about game balance. Games should be balanced. I‚Äôm trying to help you understand why you losing your fun gun is actually really important for the game, and might be the first step in a long road to actually making Fallout 76 a good game.
---
&gt; having the bugs that really irritate me and grind me down ... ignored while at the same time being constantly told that I should empathise and stop being selfish when the ones I enjoy or don't bother me are patched out eventually gets old.
---
Well, see, that‚Äôs a you problem. Life sucks sometimes, if you haven‚Äôt noticed. Rarely do we get to have our cake and eat it too. Sorry that right now in this instance you feel like you are getting dicked, but it‚Äôs for the good of the game. And the good of the game is more important than just you. If you don‚Äôt like it, then stop torturing yourself for no reason and play a game you do like. And if you really just want to play Fallout 76, despite its issues, then suck it up buttercup. Not really sure what else to tell you.

Xbox, but I‚Äôll try it anyway.  Bugs like this are probably not platform specific...
---
Ah, yes. I thought that was MODUS disposing of the remains of the Enclave, since there aren‚Äôt any skeletons in the bunker. 
---
And your right, I think they all left voluntarily, because they knew they couldn‚Äôt do anything about the robots, aside from the guys who stayed in the golf clubhouse, who got massacred by ghouls. One of the holotapes has a final toast to the Whitespring on the night before they have to leave the hotel.
---
You have to put the link on the description of the post
---
This is honestly a very cool idea.  Imagine being able to bet with caps also, public interactions would get a lot more frequent and fun
---
Yea, there should be a confirm purchase thing. 
---
I accidentally bought the stupid jammies.. meant to hit back but hit buy instead üòë
---
I get the feeling these challenges would be a lot easier with a partner.
---
Maybe you could have been less naive to think that a multiplayer game wouldn't require a few instances of... Multiplayer.
---
Thanks
---
Do you have enough space for it on your PS4, that might be the problem.
---
Try that exact spot. My other 15 photos didn‚Äôt work but someone told me to try that and it worked. I stood in front of the statue and took it and it didn‚Äôt register, then I moved 2 feet to the right and it worked first try.
---
He should‚Äôve gone down then
---
Ever caught her eyeing a good 3* drop you got?  Sleep with one eye open my man!
---
I too would love to have plumbing to be added lol, finally then I can have a working bathroom in my camp and really start the process of rebuilding America one bathroom at a time!
---
My CAMP is built near Watoga and directly next to a high level spawn point (that triggers every time some enters the cell), and my two regular turrets and two missile turrets are great. They usually cant solo the trio of level 51 Gutsy's, or the level 61 Deathclaw, or Annihilator Sentry bot, but the alert me, and do pretty decent assist.
---
No problem!
---
I have sent rrport upon report to bethesda about this issue. They either tell mr to turn the game off and on again or re downloaf the game or some times they dont even send me a response. I still have items going missing from my stash and nothing gets done. A couple of times they even told me they dont have the technology to go onto your player and give the item back or at the very least put a equivalent item back into the stash. Basically in a nut shell the devs dont care and arent going to bother to help from what i gather but please go to the bethesda page and send in a report about the missing items. Hopefully enough of us reporting can fix this problem.
---
I'm on xbox. Never find many in shops.
---
Just love it since I get a lot more visitors since noticed most people travel the roads on the maps when exploring to avoid hit mountains and especially when they haven't unlocked the fast travel location. Plus the ground is usually really flat too!
---
Its been fixed already :(
---
Well maybe if players playing fallout would ya know, join events.
---
Edit: and once again, I don‚Äôt know why some people downvoting this. This isn‚Äôt a cringy screeching post like back in the days, I still really enjoy playing f76, but not like this... it‚Äôs *literally* unplayable.
---
Sorry this isn't a post creaming Bethesda though.
---
Indeed! Also should be able to refund within 24 hours or something.
---
For the VTU courtyard, you have to be within the circular brick pattern that the statue is in.  Pretty poor photo so close to the statue, but whatever.
---
Oh thats what I did already and got 6 of them in my house lol. But I know there will be a day when its patched and I won't be able to move my base ever again unless Im ok with putting them outside.
---
Or you can just make friends and not have to rely on random people to suit your needs.
---
And you calling me na√Øve. A nice insult.
---
But the fact you can literally solo every part of the game up until these new content releases would suggest I am not na√Øve.
---
Your not the only one, but have to say, glad the robots went crazy and stuffed them in there,'I need the resources!
---
Well played
---
I love when you harvest a plant and loose ammo for some reason, or while walking you take damage from nothing.
---
Wow you really are toxic to somebody that is not happy with the fact players in fallout aint participating in events aint ya
---
We know the future is the FO4, story-wise.
---
This
---
What do you mean?
---
They could just make regular mods with legendary effects.
---
Like two-shot receivers, exploding magazines, improved vats accuracy sights, etc.
---
Xbox as well. Disconnects, server crashes, client crashes, freezes, heavy stuttering. Seems to get worse on the weekend days, but pretty bad throughout. About a third of the SBQ, Imposter Sheepsquatch and Home on the Range events end with me disconnecting or stutter crashing.
---
So I e got the electrified crook and the club how much? I‚Äôm on Xbox and only really asking cause I‚Äôm range and they‚Äôre useless and I need caps lol
---
Do you still have any to sell?? I'd be interested in looking through and buying a couple. Second question, when are you typically on??
---
I think this is where the faction stuff comes into play. The vault 76 dwellers (aka the playerbase) join up with the various factions and do exactly what the overseer begged us not to do. The new game mode probably involves this in some way. Later down the line the overseer shows up (surprise, I didn't die!) and bitches at us until we work together to take down some other threat.
---
Hmm. Maybe they put it back in. I really don't think it was spawning from scrapping.
---
i repair one leg yesterday because i was not getting lucky finding ballistic fiber and since i was going to play 1hour only before i go out i just said fk it, let's use this. 
---
I had 6, is this the normal for everyone? or just because i been killing the schorched queen lately?
---
For the wendigo mount- thnx to @Ricaldos40
---
"You will find a note on a table at the front of ''Southern Bell Motel'' which will start a short quest called 'That sinking feeling' where you will get the plans as reward for completion."
---
So you clearly have a thing for Bethesda. Ok, weird but fine.
---
But. A game which was stated at e3 can be played solo. It comes out, and lo and behold it can be completed solo. great. Even nuking a rejoin. Doable solo.
---
Then they release content that is basically not possible solo. Ok then. Fine. That's not even my damn complaint. But clearly you cant really understand complaints about Bethesda.
---
My complaint being that people are not bothering to team up to these damn events.
---
Your response to this? Make friends that like fallout! I mean wow.
---
Have you got a source on that? It sounds really cool and I‚Äôd love to have a look at those models.
---
You sold it when you got sparked.
---
Thank you for the info, I did go check out that wiki page
---
I would like to join you two on this endeavor
---
No problem...  None of the people I play with on the reg had heard if this.
---
Probably some furniture plans from whitresprings vendor, or busts, or whatever. If it's suit's your bar
---
*it's Bethesda's game*
---
baba yaga
---
I was thinking of doing the same recently, especially after hearing about all the price drops.... 
---
But the price hasn't actually dropped for PC ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Sorry. Same IGN as Reddit, but I gave up. You can try to join IGN: Bamtwin.
---
Yes, first car on the right.
---
I can't, I started the quest when it first came out but never completed it and ever sense the imposter sheepsquatch update its been glitched, however I do believe you can start it now if you didn't before
---
Well now I do
---
I was bored and built one on a hill where you‚Äôd drop three floors in to a room filled with turrets you couldn‚Äôt see before dropping in and the only door out was at a height you couldn‚Äôt reach from the outside and locked 
---
It was fun to build, it served absolutely no purpose lol
---
Does the staff throw fire balls? Are we in skyrim now? xD
---
I'm mad that I just came across my first behemoth the other night. I was certain they weren't in game from not ever finding one.
---
With benches
---
YES PLEASE!!! The closest thing Ive been doing is playing with the Hud off in survival, highly recommend!!
---
Lot
---
Also Berry Mentats (or the power armor helmet mod with the same effect).
---
Highlights living targets. No need for night vision when everything you can kill glows red.
---
No.
---
Platform?
---
I use the text chat mode in pc and it's greats when u have questions and shit since there is a local server chat or global chat with any of the dudes using the mod, i got help finding the camera that way. Also good for trade things since people you can add that person and go into his world.
---
Xbox
---
Upgradable Wooden sword
---
Ok. I'm on PS4.
---
Still going to be one of most powerful weapons in the game
---
I always spawn in the water and get diseases, and then my house materializes.
---
Ok
---
If you are on PC, download [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151), and join other players when they say in chat.
---
That would be awesome, but I haven't seen enough feather dusters and hand cuffs in screenshots of the area to confirm :D
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are saying it‚Äôs useless. I run Bloodied DCG and get over 2000+ Dmg per hit. PVE and PVP it‚Äôs great for me. I used 2H the whole time since starting the game. Switched to unarmed and haven‚Äôt looked back lol
---
I‚Äôd love to see a 5 minute video of you ‚Äúclearing‚Äù the burrows...
---
But the bunker just seems to be the easiest and thank you for the info
---
no corpse has more drugs than that ghoul outside white springs in the road lmao
---
Also, there aint much to do unless you really fucking love nature, booze, and exploding meth labs.
---
I have a feeling their loot tables are bugged. Expect to see a brief note in the next patch, claiming to fix the ISS and SBQ loot. Until then, try West Tek or Whitesprings if you want a chance at decent legendaries. It's shame, but in this game, the difficulty of enemy doesn't guarantee the loot dropped will related in quality.
---
Can't believe I didn't think of that. Got a terminal but didn't check its settings. Oh well. Good to know though.
---
Our lord appreciates the nuke, as he can now collect a ton of flux.
---
Need to save the cows.
---
Really cool detail. Thanks for sharing. :)
---
FO76 is a prequel so essentially the story ends until FO4. The future after that...nobody knows :) it depends on the choices made in FO4 :)
---
Right? I was stuck to my CAMPs wall the other day - took getting into my Power Armor to pry myself off it
---
Server hop on the teapot it‚Äôs easiest.
---
Np!
---
But the games don‚Äôt share one common story. It‚Äôs like the story of each area in the Wasteland.
---
EXPLOSIVE fun stuff *wink wink nudge nudge*
---
I would definitely love to see the return of the Winchester P94 plasma rifle (Fallout 1 +2 plasma rifle renamed Plasma caster in New Vegas for you youngsters). It could use plasma cores for ammunition and be a able to be turned into the turbo plasma caster through upgrades
---
It is the easiest, since there are no hostiles and 0-4 Technical Data per visit per character. But if you really want to grind out Technical Data to get all the paints, search on this sub and you'll find lots of other farming spots too.
---
This would of been great when my n00by self accidentally shot someone as an instant reaction when something comes up behind me. She was really angry and I tried to say sorry and tell her it was an accident, and I also heart emoted but she must of been in a group chat and just kept angry emoting and trying to kill me with mines and trying to blow up cars and stuff. I have passive mode on but it maybe text would of helped, maybe not.
---
Same problem here as well.
---
Ty least I am not alone.
---
I'm a newcomer to the game and set up my camp somewhere around the end of one of the free range events by accident so now I just pop in and get some free items every once in a while
---
Because you'd rather troll people just trying to play the game and be a complete jackoff basically
---
Appreciate you responding ty. Lets cross our fingers they fix it.
---
Most players in adventure mode are so pvp-adverse that they'll just server hop. I'm shocked to find myself one of them. Bought the game because I'd thought it'd be like Rust with Fallout stuff (first build was strictly for pvp), but now I just wanna decorate my camp in peace.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Faction based pvp will probably get more players interested. Hope the new game mode is something like that.
---
I was expecting a cringy "my wife" post but this is wholesome as fuck. Happy travels!
---
They go back to the correct value. The extra carry weight is the bug.
---
They should have just said it was permaban so we all wouldn‚Äôt have to see these posts.
---
 
---
## I logged in to Fallout 76 today and found that two of my legendary items were missing, All Rise, The Perfect Storm, The Eye of Ra, and the Garb of Mysteries. All the items except the All Rise were rewards for completing quests. I tried to go back and re-complete the quest, but the game will not let me. Can anyone tell me how do I get back the missing items? The items were in my inventory before this latest update. Is there a way to contact Bethesda directly and ask about this issue. If this is a bug, how do the heck we get our items back?
---
Campfires have been patched for quite sometime. Tried it right now and couldn't get it work like before, had my hopes raised after seeing your message and now they are smashed into the ground.
---
I agree but if the event is too hard, so be it and find something to solo. I also prefer solo .. I have 2 xboxes 2 characters, so I guess I have a friend lol .. anyway let me show you what I am going to do with free range and it might help you out. I gave up on the imposter event a long time ago .. I don't mind a challenge, but if you can't solo it, not worth it in my opinion .. for those buy stuff, others try do yourself. I agree, prefer not to buy buy hey, I figured I would never get it if I didn't. Besides I don't get it for free, it had to work hard to earn 5000 caps to buy an outfit, so I did earn it, just not in the event ..
---
Agreed. If you don‚Äôt see the name it doesn‚Äôt count
---
Bro I stg you making me sad Bc I don‚Äôt have someone like that.  I‚Äôm happy for you like fr tho good on you.
---
And yet he did not DIE
---
People who have it: does it look different on different types of armor? I ask because the pictures REALLY look like T-45. My friend bought it for his X-01,and it still looks like T-45. I only have T-60 and I don't love the paint enough to get it, especially if it's just gonna look like T-45. Does anyone have pictures of it on different armor types?
---
Well if it existed I never ran into it.
---
Selling mods, unless they were thousands upon thousands of legendary script,'would be a little unbalance, everyone would have that "perfectly OP" weapon in a week or two..
---
Happy trails you two.
---
Sorry. First I've heard of them being patched, though I've never needed to use that glitch.
---
Ok.
---
You get the owlet and Yao gui from the quests tacked on the map on the top floor of the taxidermy.
---
It‚Äôs legit. Someone posted images a while back that they dug out of the game whiles. I know I upvoted it but I‚Äôd have to dig for a while to find the post. Hopefully someone else has it more readily
---
I would prefer they fix current issues before adding new ones
---
Not really sure how to respond to that rambling nonsense lol. I will say this... If you think I am toxic for telling you to make friends while you think other players should drop what they are doing to assist you... If anything, your the toxic one. Go get some friends, stop crying about this game being multiplayer, and prepare to quit when the vaults start opening. Lol.
---
I would say so. I mean if you can't buy atoms through the store how can they refund you atoms and if they refund you store credit there's no atoms to buy.
---
I have a question related to this: has anyone noticed lately that taking data from your stash doesn't trigger the quest? It's not always, but here lately it's more often than not. I have 19 in stash that I can't seem to use. Even picking them up, dropping them, and picking them back up doesn't trigger it. 
---
Also, whats the nearest stash location to camp venture? My camp is quite close (5 caps with travel agent 1) but I didn't know if one was closer.
---
I'm guessing it looks the same for all. You want me to check on the T-60?
---
6 out of 10
---
Not been my experience. My squad and I always do Encryptid when it's announced. There are usually a lot of people there (whether they help is a different story). 
---
Free Range is more difficult to hit because there is no game wide announcement. It's annoying to keep checking the map. I can trigger Free Range from my camp. I've almost always seen one or two others who join in though. Once there were only two of us. We finished it-- the one in the NW. Have you tried that one? It's a bit easier I think.
---
I agree. It‚Äôs off center
---
Oh no he comin
---
Theres only one skin and it turns all the armors into it. They still retain all their mods and stats but they will apear as the t45
---
He‚Äôs just better at disguising his clickbait
---
That's exactly what I was thinking. Thank you
---
I have all of them.  I'm on right now and play most nights from 5:30 to 10 pm PDT.
---
If you'd like! My friend doesn't have T-60 so he can't test it for me
---
Highly appropriate given the constant grind for that perfect legendary.
---
Yes plz lol
---
That's a distinction without a difference. If the only thing that makes it a Fallout game is human NPCs, you've got a shallow idea of what makes it a Fallout game.
---
Do you and your son play on xbox? If I have the materials, I can make you a marsupial serum for free tomorrow!

---
One small step for man, one giant leap for brown paper bags
---
It might take longer than a couple of weeks, but yes, we certainly wouldn‚Äôt want everyone to be happy for having his/her perfect weapon.
---
I truly chuckled at this post.   Smiling.   Thanks!
---
The imposter head is a fucking bullshit scam and a half and I‚Äôm so pissed I fell for it. Thought for sure it was a skin for any SAH. Makes no sense why it‚Äôs an individual weapon
---
If you take a photo, that photo is your intellectual property. Using it for marketing purposes is illegal in the U.S.
---
That's like saying McDonald's can use any photo taken at their restaurant for marketing.
---
no

here's a quick how to: Put down a wall (no window), place the US Flag on the wall where the window would be, select the wall and chose replace, replace with window wall. Boom makeshift curtain.

---
I buy plans so I can craft and scrap weapons to unlock their attachments. That‚Äôs pretty much the only reason to buy them, so plans for stuff without mods to learn are pretty much pointless. 
---
Found the plan for an LMG in a safe which is whatever because I sure as hell was never gonna buy that plan
---
Took like 20 pictures until it popped up. Statue was at my back (like, literally, my butt can feel how cold it is) and facing right building (the one that closer to tattoo salon). If it is unclear, statue wasn't in frame.
---
I have a 3\* TSE Single Action for sale/trade. Make offer if interested. Trades I'm looking for are rifles/2 handed.
---
Okay I'll see what I have.
---
You can complete it solo with a bloodied melee weapon and all the damage cards for it. People usually join for the fight. Make sure to have power armor and Radaway. Crippling guns to hurt her wings and land her are great too. Melee is great for the fight in general. The rewards aren‚Äôt great. Small chance to get a nice legendary piece of gear, stable flux, prime plans for killing scorched.
---
That and the ghouls didn't have any pants on either.
---
From what I can see in xEdit the perk that affects accuracy (Mutation_ReduceAccuracy_Perk) changes the cone of fire directly, to be specific it multiplies it by 2, so this should have an affect both in and out of VATS.
---
Does the single action not get any mods? The wiki doens't have any listed for it.
---
Hmmmmm....... Yes.
---
I was being all scrap happy with weapons, and I scrapped my PINK bat. I was... I am so sad. I feel your fat-fingered pain.
---
I can confirm this. Tested on T-60, Raider, and Excavator.
---
I know I'm on a separate platform but since I'm going to have to hunt her down, where does she spawn at Pricketts?
---
The VTU jacket&amp;jeans worked. But the VTU tracksuit underarmour didn't. Which is my point, why would underarmour for one challenge not count, but for another challenge underarmour count?
---
Yes, on XB1. I probably have the mats, but not sure what's needed. But I have some of almost every mat. Thanks!

looks like you can do Receiver, Barrel, Grip

At some gaming conference recently Todd Howard was talking about fo76 and mentioned that originally the workshops were going to be the only place players could build, similar to settlements in fo4.  The idea of CAMPs came later.  
---
In addition to all the handscanner rooms that we never open a lot of aspects of whitesprings were always odd to me: the robots asking you not to do fallout things ("please refrain from theft, looting, assault, murder, or trampling the flowers"), the security that makes PvPing difficult to impossible, the location that makes it fairly easy to find as a low level, and the area with four of every crafting station.  A lot of whitesprings design fell into place when I learned CAMPs weren't originally part of the game.  Im pretty sure whitesprings was always meant to be the player hub.  I'd guess you would have payed to "rent" a room on your server.
---
I'm genuinely pleased that they are providing CAMPs Pacifist level protections. I think it provides a much cleaner environment for the happy homemakers, and make for some really high-level investment for people that want interesting player shops when the vending machines open. 
---
I also think that choosing to hop servers or abandoning ship when PvP lands on you to be a totally reasonable solution to the problem.
---
Oh, the flag. That's been a thing since FO4, was hoping for actual curtains. Thanks though.
---
Takes 1 ultracite, 3 fiberglass, 5 oil, and 1 pure crimson flux. I'll check to see if I got all that! I'll shoot you a message here tomorrow. My GT is ActualGarbage68, you can message me on Xbox and I'll see it tomorrow :)
---
I dunno but it looks like the kind of photo one would look at while smoking and drinking whiskey.
---
It‚Äôs worth doing. Pretty intense fight.
---
I definitely have all that, without even checking.
---
To be honest, as a fella who went pure Chainsaw build, it needs more than just that. The ripper and the buzzhand tend to be superior, not only because of perks working well with them, but the fact they can be used for a sneak build or open combat. 
---
Chainsaw, from my experience, is fun against ghouls, but that's where it ends. Anything that can block or stagger you a lot just ruins the fun, like running up against super mutants? Get ready to sit there and dance with them as block-spam, which locks you into an odd animation that takes around 2 seconds to get through, stopping your chainsaw and damage outright. If they don't block, they stagger the hell out of you, which is aggravating for the chainsaw. You get whacked, your character stumbles back, they lose their animation and dps, thus you have to rev the chainsaw ALL OVER AGAIN, whereas the Ripper and Buzzsaw just push their blade out again and that's it. They have a much faster recovery time over it, though I'm sure those players also find it annoying to deal with. Chainsaw is also considered Very Loud on the stealth system, so it's very difficult, if impossible, to use it in stealth. 
---
Now if the weapon had a special chance to stagger per hit and the enemy can't reset the stagger timer (PvE), I'd say the weapon would be more fun to use. Instead it's just a headache against every other enemy out there except Ghouls. Hell, even scorched have a nasty habit of staggering. Pneumatic is practically a must, and even then, it's still irritating. It's probably no wonder why people love using things like fist weapons, since blocking actually increases their DPS by resetting their animation
---
Long story short, I agree, but it also needs other shit on it to really make it work in combat...or just put yourself at 20% hp with the perks and do high damage, idk.
---
Thx wastelander
---
Thank you
---
I'm level 39. I don't have the equipment to throw down with levels 170+ who literally one-shot me. These guys just appear out of nowhere. I have done the whole turret building thing and it's a waste of resources. Turrets don't even seem to target these guys. I'm well aware that workshops open you up to pvp, the problem lies in the fact that there are people who will cross the map just to take a workshop from someone at a significantly lower level than them just so they can pvp. They don't use the workshop itself for its resources. They use the workshop as a pvp arena. Which is not what Bethesda intended by making it a pvp zone.
---
I'll agree with you, if we both agree that the 'people just trying to play the game' are the one's assaulting your workshop and the 'complete jackoffs' are the people that expect to be able to take advantage of one of the only PvP mechanics in Adventure Mode without taking any risks.
---
Far as trolling goes, I mean... if you make it easy enough for me, sure.
---
I find the drop from turning in technical data a little better if I do it once every 48 hours rather than every 24. It could just be me, but I find a rewards really weak if I do it too often.
---
I see ivory grip but no receiver or barrel mods
---
I've never seen a SBQ summoned without at least half the server showing up.  I'm sure plenty of people have, but each time I see one it's usually being swarmed.
---
I think its in tagertys room, I assume its her and other BoS people
---
I will have to message you later though. I'm supposed to be "working" now. Thanks.
---
It's not just about happiness but also balance and longevity.  
---
It seems counterintuitive but when "epic rewards" are given out too easily it diminishes the overall experience, Hell tons of time and money is spent breaking down the dopamine reward triggers....  
---
It's a bad analogy, but think of the work that goes into casinos and the desire for the "marks" to slip into the "just one more hand" mindset / level of addiction
---
Hence the issue that seemingly so many people are perfectly okay with :\
---
Responder leaders
---
Eh, you can make do with PA and heavy weapons, if you got build for it. Stealthboy torso helps a ton - I'd say it's an absolute must. I run explosive plasma/laser gatlings, harpoon and grenades; they pack a punch and stagger Sentinels. 
---
Wish the PA was tougher; crits decimate it in a second. All in all, fun. There is a clear meta with commando builds, so the relevant armors and guns are stupidly expensive on m76...
---
We already found him in Fallout New Vegas. "I am programmed for your pleasure. Please assume the position."
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, too. Just odd the clarity they gave it. It‚Äôs the only photo of its kind (that I‚Äôve found, anyway)
---
That guy on the far right looks like he's checking the clock for high noon.......
---
No problem! Sounds good dude, meet up with you tomorrow!
---
So I'm reading this and I'm like "what the hell are they talking about?"
---
So yeah, could probably build camp on some spawn point cause it's first time I hear about it. Is there a list of such points for me to know?
---
NO, do NOT add a dual  bar, that attachment does 0 damage, literally. The files for it state Secondary Damage: 50% with the secondary damage listed as: 0. 
---
It's a waste of a mod. Long Bar on the other hand works.
---
If you are on PS4 its the share button held down for a few seconds I think.
---
I think it is. Pretty cool imo.
---
I‚Äôve had my fair share of fun with the game, if I don‚Äôt get to play on my main again so be it
---
a PATH! a PATH!
---
And now the glass covered crook üò∂
---
so calibrated shocks doesnt give more carry weight anymore?
---
Hey me and my wife are a tag team too!!
---
Its most likely an easter egg, odds are those are some people who worked on the game, ive seen some other games were the devs do stuff like this its kinda cool
---
Agreed
---
You need to go for it. Maybe check who is on the server first. I have done it ( SBQ ) with 6 people and it took a big effort. You need a few high levels to assist.
---
Side note, there's a similarly detailed photo of Rose &gt;!near the actual Rose's corpse!&lt;
---
I could see it being helpful if you like keeping your weapon over 100% without having to go through the Pipboy. 
---
But yeah, if you‚Äôre in a position to repair it, you‚Äôd easily be able to check it then.
---
Bloody mess doesnt make it go away on PC either. I still have instances where this happens....
---
I got the impression it was the dev's too when I first looked at it.
---
what was his name? Fito?
---
Haven't played much Destiny but if it's exactly as the guy described then yeah.
---
People rip on Bethesda but Bungie has seen better days to be fair.
---
So this is one of my load screens, and every time it pops up I think, ‚ÄúDude likes ‚Äò em in uniform.‚Äù
---
He sure does!! Haha!
---
Super cool! I‚Äôm headed to get my next load screen now. Thanks!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure what everyone is talking about, even with all of my perk cards I am right around 400 or damage so I‚Äôm not for any more reductions... I have never had those massive numbers so others have been showing.....
---
So. It's shitty. But yet you still support them by buying another copy....
---
I've heard people managing to retrieve their loot sometimes from the fissure if it's not too deep.
---
A few tricks can be employed ( though not always possible ).
---
I'm here as well.  Seven players is about the fewest I have seen in about 30-40 goes.  Though once we finished with 5 when a good number abandoned the fight (when the whole server shows up, it becomes hard to beat her in the time allowed as her own strength/armour seems to go up exponentially with each participant, so players come and go sometimes).
---
The rewards are mostly the plans, power armour and prime receivers ... haven't gotten one useful \*\*\* legendary out of the fight .... couple thousand rounds of ammunition plus a dozen or two stimpacks and radaways and fixing all your stuff after is the cost.
---
Single action does not have any mods besides the ivory grip. Also just buy one on r/Market76
---
If you save all three cows your basically guaranteed a plan in addition to the meat pie.

Looks like a mirelurk with glowing night eyes like a cat lol

If you supply the flux, only 25 caps.  Otherwise it's 460 caps (that's what I get from the robot vendors and how I make caps for all 5 of my characters).  If you don't have stable flux, you should shop around.  There are people selling for only 200 caps sometimes :)
---
Yeah, it really sucks when that happens.
---
I thought one was of the holotapes mentions that photo.  I thought the 2nd from the left is the overseer?
---
For posting what ultimately amounts to their own intellectual property, apparently.
---
I‚Äôm so confused now because all of my buddies had this problem on pc and now it‚Äôs gone for them as well.  Going on almost a week now.
---
Right?
---
Kudos! I told my wife that for my birthday I wanted to play this game with her, we bought a second console and she promised me she‚Äôs give it two weekends. 
---
We have our own photo album, our various CAMPS, her first suit of power armor, our first scorch beast queen. I dropped the ball and forgot to take a photo when we launched our first nuke, but we brought down the scorchbeast queen together right after the Fasnacht event. 
---
Best gaming experience I‚Äôve had in a long time!
---
Dysentery
---
I would kill for more plants, rocks and trees in my little slice of heaven!
---
If you log in with excavator pa ( with cal shocks ) your carry weight is approx 500+ lbs . But if you exit and re enter it drops 100 lbs to 400+ ( which is still a lot ).
---
It has always been this way. The normal carry weight max is 400+.
---
The bug is the extra carry weight on log in  - so I don't complain.
---
It's cool I'll play on my main in your memory.
---
No. It‚Äôs like taking a picture of a movie, or recording something off TV, and claiming it‚Äôs now yours and you can charge people for using it. Spoiler alert: it isn‚Äôt.
---
You CAN carry and MUST carry more than 1 in order to get good plans from the Forbidden Knowledge quest. You can hold more than 1 but the game will not let you know you are carrying more than 1
---
I hope she isn't just 'there'. There's got to be some sorta in-game introduction, otherwise wouldn't most 76ers just shoot on sight? I also hope she has actual dialgue, rather than just **"HUrRgGh!!"** like all the others
---
1* explosive rolling pin.

Yes please.

WS should have beds &amp; instruments for XP instead of having to return to camp when needing Well Rested &amp; Tuned, &amp; water to boil for cooking food, or allow cooking with Purified Water

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
But when you turn it in you only get like 2 3 things usually ammo
---
I fast traveled into it, then almost immediately told me event failed. üò≠
---
1 seems reasonable. Instigating + much higher base damage. Lack of incisor won't matter much because damage value is so high.
---
Both sides of 2 are weird. Instigating gauss (no explosive) with those perks should be dealing &gt;900 damage on the first stealth shot, which is a body one-shot on a supermutant. I can only think of the Grounded mutation, or something weird going on with explosive. I also don't understand how a laser rifle could deal 700 damage that fast. I can only guess that the explosive effect is dealing far more than +20% damage on that weapon.
---
The shots-per-kill on the SMG are also very high. Expected shots per kill would be about 34 without Explosive or sneak attacks.
---
Well, now I do.
---
Heck, you could use the blank holotapes that you find at sugar grove for that.
---
Sometimes it happens to me , the corpse dissapears but it appears several meters away from where i killed it
---
nope. must be a bunny killing contagion spreading ;)
---
Only prime receiver and long barrel I think
---
Not to spoil but it‚Äôs at at Groves Family Farm. I hope my info helped. Because I was confused why I wasn‚Äôt getting anything else at the same spot
---
if by fertilizer producer u mean the one u can make for ur camp yes its at harpers ferry and watoga station, the problem is that its actually named "Brahmn Pen" not the other name that u see in the camp menu (not online to check the actually name) this caused me some confusion too when I was searching for it as well
---
Yeeees! ü§£
---
Where is this event. I have yet to find it
---
Even the very rare orange one?
---
I want this so I can build my own cave
---
What?
---
There isn't an orange one? There's yellow, blue, red, green, pink, Forrest, brown, weathered, white dirty, and white
---
Mine does this too, but plays a sound that is like an irl power transformer. I bet it's for a companion for a later DLC update lol.
---
Unless it was stabilized, flux is under the Aid tab. You don‚Äôt drop it on death.
---
For future reference you can buy pretty much any mutation off the marketplaces on reddit for 200-300 caps or as you just saw people can make them for free. I feel you, I did something similar ..
---
Fantastic.  I just launched a squatch and really enjoyed it ... for a while it had the green haze, was cool
---
Take that loser
---
...and the man, who was sad and was mad with two other dogs.

all 4 horsemen power armor paints will turn ur current model into the model used for that paint job but retain their mods and stats

War Rider is T-45
---
Plague Rider is X-01
---
one will be T-60
---
and the other one will be T-51
---
Thank you!
---
Fancy a round of Caravan?
---
Oh no! A downvote!
---
I wish there was more mutated things and giant variants like a ‚Äúgiant hulking megasloth‚Äù and it‚Äôs literally a megasloth that‚Äôs all scared up and 2 times the size of a regular one.  Along with other bosses of the same size and with different attributes they don‚Äôt evolve like regular legendaries but they have just a crazy amount of resistances not health but resistances such as a megasloth might be high in energy but low in regular bullets. So it would be desirable to not always have a TSE or a AAE or whatever it is, it may not be as effective but would work.
---
if you think fallout 76 is a fallout title then you dont know what makes a fallout game a fallout game. Being blind and ignorant to scraps is what makes sheep like you gold mines to bethesda
---
While the chance to trigger FLC perk cars depend on its level, the amount of crit bar filled is dependent on luck, more luck = more filled, caps at 34 afair.
---
Also, take note that its a chance per projectile. For multiprojectile weapons theres a decent chance to trigger it multiple times and hence get your bar full in one shot.
---
Thanks. I bought it 2 months ago, before I started shopping here. For the mats required I cannot believe how much Modus wants! Scoundrel!!
---
That is if you only turn in 1. If you turn in 2 you can get legendary armor pieces and the plans for unique T-60 power armor
---
Looks like it's bugged. The flamer barrels don't add the WeaponTypeAutomatic keyword, so Rifleman perks should apply instead.
---
Can already be done through system settings
---
Hey guilty are you gonna play fallout 76 tonight
---
Fallout 76 is definitely shallow and mindless enough it‚Äôll sink into ‚Äúfuck commies‚Äù over any thematic depth. They will just throw a giant robot in and not care if it is bad story
---
That's fair. I don't mind visitor's to my place, as I like showing it off, but I dont go out of my way to make it super accessible (because it's foundation stack locked in place halfway up a cliff and I cant move it). But I really appreciate people that make theirs available to everyone. Its just a great reminder of how awesome the community is.
---
i just want a way to upgrade the level of my legendary gear. some of the quest rewards are pretty okay and i've had a few good weapons crop up at lower levels, which is a real shame.
---
on the other hand i have two alt characters absolutely stuffed to the gills with sub-par or underlevelled legendary stuff that i'm immediately going to cash in on my main character so maybe i'll get something useful out of it.
---
Yes
---
No effect on perk points. Negligible on gameplay, don‚Äôt even notice with class freak.
---
My quest was "lost" also. According to Bethesda they are aware of it. But I do hope that increasing  the visibilty of this issue maybe they will prioritize it. Very disappointing and frustrating.

Your commitment to photography is impressive. Thanks for sharing - if it wasn‚Äôt for people like you taking pics I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever stop to appreciate the cool shit in the game. I certainly don‚Äôt take glamour shots with my prosnap

What perks are you using on this build? I‚Äôm trying to do a shotgun build.
---
here lies andy peperony and chease.
---
Anybody know the technical reason why we are limited to 50 pictures on console? You can have unlimited photos on PC.
---
looking forward to it
---
Hey , can youu tell me what is the size of the game with all the patches?
---
They‚Äôve also said there‚Äôs no plans to remove it from the shop so you have awhile
---
Sadly this \^ with all the legendary gear non-PA gear, Power Armor isnt more than a big hazmat at this point :(
---
Cheering.gif 
---
Fashion show time!
---
What about the purple one?
---
Modifications to Specials don't affect how many perks you can equip.
---
Negatives to Int definitely affect durability of crafted items, although that's easy to work around. They probably also affect XP gain (but not much), and maybe scrapping results. There's a table for Int vs scrapping results but I'm not sure if it's used.
---
[](/celestia)Didn't halo 3 have something like this? It was [kind of infamous](https://youtu.be/JznZagG0UNo?t=129). You also couldn't tell what the hell anyone was saying, but hey, maybe they've made real time voice modulation better since the 2000s.
---
The event for killing the queen only gave you fuel, or that's all you looted from her corpse?
---
I‚Äôve seen this a lot, actually. In fact, there‚Äôs been more typewriters than actual clothes.
---
You have to be right in his face.
---
YOU DID WHAT??!?!??  
---
Surface never. Vault forever.
---
I mean he's got a ^(plastic) knife.
---
I found it in the shed behind the ranger building in the cranberry bog.
---
Just wait till you respec and then it vanishes out of  your stash with some power armour. Great times.
---
Seems right. Everyone who this has happened to has been on pc from the people I have asked. Hope you can somehow get your stuff back
---
6 k for the single action
---
You load sixteen tons and whadda ya get? A bloodied rolling pin and deeper in debt.
---
The one that glitches and turns you into Barney? Hell yeah I got that one!
---
But how do you carry 2 they dont stack for me
---
You kill 10,000 baby yao guai for springs and acid and nobody bats an eyelash. You kill one player and all of a sudden you are the bad guy.

I think we all know who the real scourge of Appalachia is.

On xbox1 I have a troubleshooter explosive .44 if interested
---
My teammates are demanding a fashion show, and they will get one tomorrow!
---
For them to be shark cards, they would have to 1) Raise caps cap, 2) Introduce super expensive items, and 3) directly sell caps. It's not going to be shark cards, if only because the game is not designed for that sort of gameplay.
---
I also *suspect* there won't be any permanent meaningful gameplay changes on Atom Shop. No "fridge backpack" that does not require in-game plans (I suspect visual appearance will be separated entirely from what the pack does), no huge game-vital buffs (nearest I am waiting for is an XP boost), no weapons or armor. Just the fact that they are not selling functional camp items that don't require plans is in support of this.
---
If anything, I am worried they'll eventually do paid DLC out of necessity in a few years, and while I am okay with that premise, it would technically break a promise, which will no doubt be infuriating to many. But then, all that also assumes this is not being written off as a loss for tax purposes while giving them a slowly improving team for online functionality.
---
lol caravan did come up in our conversation
---
You cannot claim that the *product* that you photographed is yours.
---
You can claim that the *photo* is yours. No one can use it for financial gain.
---
Nice. I wish you could build up there...
---
So this isn‚Äôt a problem on the consoles from what I understand?
---
I expect pictures of the highlights. :p
---
AT LAST! My quest is at an end! Just traded for the final plan I was missing, and I now know all of them! After over 60 times doing this damn event. After watching idiot teammates get the effing cows killed time after time. After spending ridiculous amounts of expensive ammo. After endlessly receiving nothing but meat pie recipes and one-star useless legandaries! I'm FREEEEEE! FINALLY FREEEEEEEEE!!!!!
---
\#feelsgoodman #fuckthosedamncows #sheepsquatchlootsucks
---
I can‚Äôt guarantee that. I‚Äôve a small sample size.
---
No joke, every boss they've ever made, even the Destiny 1 base game, is just larger versions of normal enemies that are scaled to like 500%.
---
They all also feature a stomp mechanic they do when you get close that launches you backwards.
---
No some of them... every boss. Literally every single one.
---
Bruh, you can carry 2 the game just doesn't let you know you are carrying two
---
No it's actually rifleman
---
All SPECIAL stats have passive effects, if you are negative in points it only affects the passive effect. Take for example strength, each point adds 5lbs carry weight. Regardless of assigned perk cards. Endurance adds 5pts to health per point. Agility adds to AP. And so on.
---
Is there a max limit?
---
Hey, i might wanna buy some stuff.
---
If you looked at the terminals around the Hotel, you find out that renovations were scheduled for the year after the bombs fell, and because automation had replaced most of the staff, there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do to prevent being kicked out.
---
No, not really. Even with a bloodied perk and all of the tweaks, you can do only 800+ damage, which is far too low for drawbacks on the weapon are. It needs the explosive bug fixed, and it needs the base damage to be 1,000 damage at least, since it's AoE is so small, it should be more considered as the explosive character's 1v1 weapon.
---
After the second one there is no difference in rewards
---
Send me an invite I'm usually on every day.. gt cl88t
---
So only carry two or carry a bunch?
---
Great what lvl are you and what are you interested in
---
There are 27 total brewable drinks. Some you start with automatically unlocked, the rest you get from Biv (except hard lemonade which comes from the random encounter lemonade vendor)
---
Would just prefer the vendor to let you reroll a Star.
---
Example:
---
Bloodied explosive reduced weight minigun
---
Odds:  1/23, 1/9, 1/7 (from memory).  That‚Äôs a 1:1242 chance from a dropped minigun.
---
You have the purveyor let you reroll each Star, for an increasing amount (let‚Äôs say 5, 20, and 50 scrips), and when you get 1, 2, and 3 for the exchange, and your god roll is in sight, and possible with some luck, but not something you just plop down and get after a long day of farming.
---
I however am expecting the purveyor to be another version of the Halloween candy prize from the candy machines in Watoga high school, which is a huge wasted opportunity.
---
Great I'll add you when I get back on cant wait. Also what lvl are you amd what build are you running
---
Lol that's wack. I liked the gunplay and LOVED the score by Marty but thought the game as a whole was sub-par. 
---
To think with the chemistry they had with Halo, and now that? It's hard to believe it's the same developer. Bungie used to be so much more consumer friendly as well.
---
I owe my soul to the company stoooooore.
---
Nah just the crook
---
Nope just burning damage, looks really cool though
---
Haha I'll make sure to take photos!
---
I got a picture of a level 2 as soon as he left the vault for a challenge.. he probably thought I was some creep, but all I want are my atoms :/ he started punching me after I took it

I accepted D1 for what it was and genuinely enjoyed TDB, HoW, and TTK but D2 took it all back to being worse than vanilla D1, destroyed how the gunplay felt, and made it a slog to play.

I left and never looked back.

I'm quite fond of loading in and the world being pink or blue! XD

((On top of the piece by piece!))

I have two Explosive western revolvers on PC. The game just loves giving me western revolvers.
---
I have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say.
---
Feeling alone makes you feel like you're rebuilding?
---
I have a vampire plasma flamer and I can confirm despite dealing constant automatic-rifle style damage, plasma flamers get their weapon perks from the rifleman family and not the commando family.

Are you trying to kill stuff around your own level?

The guy was in the trader little room

I thought that was my headphones acting up, I love the skin but the distorted PA sound effects are annoying

Im not sure but I believe the only receiver mod is to make it prime. I don‚Äôt know about the barrel though

XB1 here and I almost lost one but it was due to my own stupidity not the games fault. I dropped it like an idiot and couldn't find the bag for a few moments luckily I found the bag.
---
Oh I thought environment levels scale. I didn't check their levels.  
---
I mean, they cant be too high level because after a few clips, im actually able to kill off enemies with just 4 rounds or so.  
---
So im trying to figure out if its the game glitching out, my own latency, or is the shotgun im using useless?
---
No. Because we all are alone makes me feel as if I am rebuilding America because we are the only ones left in the wasteland. Cant really describe it
---
Nope. Happened to me on ps4 three days ago.  Bethesda can suck my hairy balls.
---
The majority of them haven‚Äôt been added to the game yet. Only the wendigo and the ones you can get from the taxidermy are in the game currently

Getting twenty-something white commie kids to lust over Tennessee Eernie Ford is the Confederacy's greatest ruse.

Still helping?
---
It spawned for me on the table furthest south and it was almost invisible. Look really carefully at the table.
---
I can confirm that it crashes my xbox.
---
Closest I've had is some Power Armour disappearing when I modded it. Came back after restarting the game though. ((Xbox))
---
I too am enjoying this game with my wife. It's amazing how much more fun it makes the whole thing. We've both loved Fallout for years, and no matter the other issues with the game, being able to play in the *same* wasteland side-by-side is something new and magical for us. Just wonderful. Glad you're getting that same enjoyment.
---
Same every time I die back to V76....
---
Wouldn't it make more sense for it to NOT be a giant liberator? Some large chinese robot, yes, but not a giant liberator.
---
oh fuck, is that why i'm detected (but not it doesn't go red/hostile) in the woods, and can't find anything near me?
---
Yes it does do Ik where nope
---
Yes, they exist.
---
You really need to check their levels. Very easy to walk into high-level mobs by accident.
---
Happend to a friends power armor while wearing it and on an item for me
---
Thank you gives me hope
---
Depends on their lvl, your lvl ie what perk cards you can use. And damage output of gun
---
I dont have pink, but if you're on xbox I can make you an all star, mahogany, red, grey, or black one. And i have barbed, puncturing rocket and bladed rocket mods too.

i made a reddit account JUST to say: thank you for posting this üôè
---
We just got a second Xbox and now my gf and I play together all the time. We've even got her two little sisters playing now too, so it's like a little family.
---
We play with other couples as well, and it's so cool to be in a team with another couple. Teamwork is streamlined and support is on point.
---
Slight tangent, I'm actually so happy with how diverse this community is. I play with grandparents, little kiddos, people from other countries, drag queens, men, women, conservatives, liberals, atheists, christians... I've made so many friends playing this game than I have playing any other game.
---
Why do you want mutant‚Äôs?   Antiarmor is better.   Or bloodied.
---
I will pay good caps to have throwable pies.
---
I wonder if it has to do with pc mods vs the game similar to the atomic shop texture issue a little while ago.

I think you can clip into places if the game world doesn't load fast enough.

I play on PC and lost both modified legs of my X-01 power armor last week. I am not 100% sure I didn't sell them or scrap them on accident but I have owned them for hundreds of hours with no incident only to lose 2 pieces  just after the patch. I wonder if they didn't glitch from swapping perks around. I recently stopped using power smith and other power armor related perks and I wonder if because I didn't have that equipped it tried to not count the kinetic mods I had on the legs due to not being able to craft them without the perk cards?also I recently changed my perks around to regain ap at a much higher rate and I wonder if perhaps I didn't exceed some in game speed limit for ap regen.  as far as ap regen goes I eat corn soup have all ap regen perk cards and had kinetic mods on the legs. pretty sure my ap regen was highest possible you could get in the game. I have scrapped and lost armor in the past I'm about 800 plus hours and I have done dumb things from time to time but the last two lost pieces were a complete mystery to me.
---
Thanks for taking the time to put this together. I‚Äôve been saving atoms for a while for a skin I liked and I just picked this up.
---
Maybe for your play style but I personally like Mutants I know I'm probably one of the few that do and I have nothing to base it on its just what I like. Lol I like to be different
---
I think she has her own shop and building. Someone found the building last month, maybe the month before
---
What platform?
---
They are not affected by your perks
---
If a gamma gun spawns that ‚Äúdeals more damage‚Äù to ghouls and heals limbs exists this will exist

Was hanging out in fort defiance today and someone launched a nuke at Whitesprings (big surprise) but they directly targeted the Golf course fast travel point. So of course I decide why the hell not and fast traveled there with my buddy and a few other that were there also. Stood there looking up until the nuke literally dropped put of the sky right on top of us. The impact knocked us down and we all were there with the call for help or give up options for a few seconds until the actual blast hit and wiped us out. Got the achievement for being at ground zero. Was kind of fun. All though I was amazed that Xbox shows only 2.66% of gamers have that achievement. Wonder why? It's so easy.
---
I did lose every mod and known plan from my stash on Xbox. Occasionally over the past couple weeks armor and aid have been randomly disappearing too. All items were in my alt so they were not accidentally dropped or traded.
---
I am PSN.  Sorry.
---
True lol
---
It‚Äôs happened to me too! I‚Äôve never looked around to see, just wondered... I‚Äôm glad his gaze is upon me though
---
Sure thing, I will be online in a few minutes.
---
I still haven't found the Rock-It Launcher or its plans, is it in fo76?
---
Cmon just add it already!
---
All I got to say it happens. And no not a bug but just think about the whole think and think why wouldn‚Äôt someone do this
---
St. Peter don't ya call me cause I can't go,
---
I owe my soul to the Atom Store.
---
Why you should ALWAYS get a middle man when dealing in a large trade like that
---
200+ caps later, i finally found him in the same spot!!!
---
No problem at all I was mainly just looking to see if it exists before I give up hope of finding one lol. I have a request on marketplace I'm hoping someone answers I just posted the question here since there are quite a few helpful people hoping someone like yourself might see it and let me know it does exist.
---
The robe from FO2 that boosted your barefisted fighting ability
---
I don't know in which country this legislation should apply but so far I've seen no game that made any update or changes in response to such an legislation whatsoever
---
Yes, my fault. Just got a little excited. Been trying to get that gun for a long time.
---
Agreed. I had started one character and reached level 80 something and decided to start fresh. I hit 143 today. My wife is at 41. All things aside, it's still a blast. Friends make it all better. They are your companions and npc replacements.
---
I like the green tint instead of true night vision. Since I can never turn it off during the day, it still functions as a regular scope on my favorite rifle and doesn't completely wash out from the bright light and I feel it works just well enough in the dark to be useful
---
üòê
---
If they Add in an Anti Material Rifle, I want different Ammo types.
---
There‚Äôs 2 in that sentence lmAo, coke being Nuka Cola, the most popular drink in the game, and atomic cocktails being a drink that gives you fire resistance among other things üòÇ
---
My dude, good on you for wanting to help, but you did not read what OP posted. OP wants to craft individual mods, not attached to weapons or armor, so they can sell them to other players.
---
I‚Äôve got two wedding rings if you guys want them? I‚Äôm on PS4 though.
---
ok same name as reddit and I sent a request.
---
I would love to be apart of this
---
BE or AAE
---
Hah! Great idea. I already found em on XBONE. On the radroach in the toilet. Thanks though.
---
as long as he doesn't flash the mangina we should be all good!
---
you could have a damage or latency glitch so don't rule it out, but before you go uninstalling and reinstalling consider these factors. 
---
1. Environment scales with you at level 9 however if I arrive in the area first at level 202 it scales around me. so double check mob levels. 
---
2.  if you're using a shotgun they suck at long range and do better damage the closer you get because more pellets hit the target. 
---
3. and yes there was a batch of glitches a few months back that if you did too much damage too fast creatures would reset their hit points. I was trying to make flame thrower work and had to retire it because it was putting out too much dps. (it was a 2 shot) (fuel was a bitch anyway and the condition sucked always breaking)
---
Despite the somewhat condescending tone you do have a point.
---
Either I accept that this is how is going to be for the foreseeable future and some egregious bugs are going to have to take a back seat while the devs use whatever time they can spare from implementing the roadmap to focus on PvP related matters or I take a break and go back to modding/playing FO4.
---
I am however bitter about how PvP has pretty much taken over - fun fact, they broke the whole stealth mechanic through some change they had to implement due to PvP a few patches back and they haven't been able to 'rein it in' since... - and become the main focus outside new content delivery.
---
I still don't see what you see though, where you see an overarching 'plan' I see them putting out fires here and there haphazardly without broader consideration.
---
Said that if we saw eye to eye on everything this would be a circle jerk and not a discussion.
---
Sounds like a latency thing, have you done a ping test lately? What kind of internet are you on?
---
I'm on satellite and do better than what you seem to be doing, so I hope you can get it figured out.
---
Mutants could be better in certain situations. Anti armor has diminishing returns, so if you already have incisor*3 then it's not that helpfull. And bloodied requires a special build to shine.
---
Also, you could really find a bargain 3* mutants machete. I think the problem with finding one is that most people assume no one wants that garbage and vendors it.
---
A mutants, swing speed, +1 S machete with the sacrificial blade mod would be pretty sweet! 4 star legendary!
---
*thrashes violently on floor, foaming at the mouth*
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Reporting back:
---
Definitely a bug. Open emote menu, click RS... game shutdown.
---
Like a Communist Liberty Prime?
---
Just shoot the enemies in the face lmao
---
Find two, turn them in. Repeat.
---
üòâ
---
But we're not rebuilding anything. We're literally nuking it back into ashes like hourly.
---
Would like to have you aboard. Let me know your GT. I am just starting this out. You are more than welcome to join. If I get a good response I plan to start a Facebook page for members
---
i‚Äôm game! i have two characters. one is lv100 and the other is lv20
---
i play at random times, mostly at night (EST)
---
my GT is regigiygas
---
I have bloody mess equiped and i have corpses disappear as I eviscerate them. I have to walk away and come back waiting for the fly piles or fast travel away then come back. The piles are always there when i return but ohh gaud that moment when they die. Thia has happened yo me on 5 of at least 16 double spawn sheepsquach events with the brahmins. Happens more often it aeema when more things are trying to load in or dying a super quick succession. Hope this helps. Also on PS4 with bitchin fast internet.
---
if the members are really from Canada, then no one will break the rules. everyone will just say they are sorry all the time.
---
Ok so what makes you enjoy the game?
---
Xbox: Falloutramon
---
Upload the GT to the discord
---
PC players have it because they cheated... they're not meant to have it
---
Might be nerfed.   I switched play style a few patches ago.
---
Exploring, finding plastic. Random encounters with other players. The eternal search for a Tamable cat.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE to actually be able to rebuild things. But as it is, we can't even have CAMPs too close to each other without the game falling apart. :(
---
I wish there were at least 10x as many non-human NPC types (and I wish there were some human ones too!).
---
Report both accounts even to Bethesda... I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not the only one...
---
Absolutely. Would you like to join?
---
Bos fort defiance? After you sweep the bldg theres a 6 man barracks at the end that has notes and a holo tape 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs camp venture where they talk about creating the BOS order, though I could be wrong
---
Oh man, I'm not crying, you're crying. That's awesome.
---
I agree, which is why I hope we can have more quests in the future that actually gives us the ability to rebuild america. Which IMO was a very big part of the "story" in 76
---
Looks like Wolverine and AOC...lol
---
Thanks so much! +karma
---
My wife *could* play with me but doesn't ever want to. 
---
At least we'll have Borderlands.
---
How come it‚Äôs a popular drop site? I have t launched a nuke yet :(
---
nah. id rather stalk new players to their camps, make them scared of my higher level.. then drop them plans, use the gift emote, and leave without so much as scuffing the floor
---
You're welcome. :)
---
being a true blue Canucklehead, I'd consider it my duty to join, eh?
---
IGN LifeInAnalog
---
Oh it exists.  I had a mutants swingspeed machete once (still might).  And I still have a mutant‚Äôs swingspeed 3* deathclaw guantlet.   Just not the right platform for you.
---
Why did u have to put everything in the title?
---
That little market alley is where I finally scored BOS chest armor plans.
---
I want my R91 back, damn it
---
Would be good to have you aboard fella. You're on xbox ? I forgot to mention that in post. My mistake.
---
believe the black one will be t-60
---
I'm also on xbox, and I believe I have pink aswell as a few more colors if you want me to check
---
second?
---
Yes I reported both accounts to Microsoft and bethesda.
---
I do not have discord.
---
ah crap..PC..ya, probably edit yer original post. Good luck with the Faction!
---
Fact is you can literally harvest more stuff in one hour than a full setup uninterrupted workshop so why even deal with it? 
---
Getting ore to only have to hunt down acid to smelt it sucks... 
---
PvP... they literally have created a whole server full of PvP action so if that‚Äôs your thing, go for it! 
---
But just going on adventure mode to trash someone or their camp for no reasons tells me they couldn‚Äôt hack it in survival mode and they‚Äôre acting out due to getting their arses handed to them... 
---
Bottom line there are two different servers... if you want PvP you literally got your wish...
---
oh sorry, third. How can i forget about Chally Moo Moo
---
You can name your power armor now. Just so you know for next time.
---
I‚Äôd post in the bazaar and other sell groups as well as dischord to make sure others know at least those two gt‚Äôs
---
Thank you, I just got my WiFi back like the day after the update so I‚Äôve been grinding lately: thanks for the tip.
---
Yeah I edited the comments now... Thanks buddy.
---
Okay nice, 
---
I didn‚Äôt want to sound snarky and say I thought it was pretty shit, particularly because I‚Äôve only been playing my level 50 character for ~30-40 hours and don‚Äôt expect that I should have perfect 3-stars by this stage
---
I found some ultra cite armor at level 50 full set....
---
LITERALLY U PLAYABLE!!
---
Well... almost. I keep trying to bring up that 
---
camp building mechanics needs some fixing. It's all a bit janky.
---
Wow, that was so constructive, you're obviously so up to date with how this game works. \*claps\*
---
No witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and do not accuse players of cheating. Use Bethesda's official support page to report them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/). Do not name in shame in general.
---
Yeah this would go great with the guitar sword
---
LOL
---
I‚Äôm on xbox for clarification, I‚Äôm not asking anyone for donations though. Don‚Äôt wanna be that guy. But hey I hope I can find some guilt free power armor one day with no one around.
---
You don't need two to get power armor paints and outfits, I know that for sure because I tested it last week. Not totally sure about the legendary items.
---
There are a few photos like this in Fallout 76. I guess they haven‚Äôt all decayed yet like they are in other Fallouts? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm looking to buy the witch &amp; the skeleton costume plans. Will pay 2,000 caps for the Witch and 2,500 for the Skeleton. I‚Äôm on PS4 and my name there is TAHKWUH üéÉüëç
---
A video of the bug. If you scrap too fast you can lose Excavator PA sorry no confirming legendary weapons afaik but I wouldn't rule it out.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjazzq/bug_and_proof_of_disappearing_power_armor_pieces/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

id also love a little something for placing small purifiers on stone/concrete, basically a rectangular hole in the ground where you can place purifiers, they would snap into place and cannot be moved without removing it from the hole. maybe make them cost the same as a normal purifier when it comes to budget since it would allow more placement options in water.
---
I'm not apart or aware of any sell groups my dude. Would like to be. I use the fo76 club to make posts. I have come across many people attempting to scam, this time I was just a little to desperate to get something and it bit me in the ass.
---
I'm good at using character creation systems in general, so it just took a bit of fiddling while glancing at a recent photo of myself and I was good to go.
---
Faction raids and a big quest at the end would be cool
---
Great, even just knowing the total number helps. Thanks!
---
What are you on? Send some my way.
---
Yeah, it's not the end of the world (le har har), but sometimes I'm up there on my banjo and it gets to me a little.
---
Redheads make the wasteland better. :D
---
Damn, wonder why they haven't used em yet. Unless they still plan to in their updates this year.
---
Hope is the first step on the path to unhappiness.
---
Get marsupial, you will not regret it. I have 12 mutations, starched genes and class freak ftw.
---
It‚Äôs in the game as far as I know, I‚Äôm on PC though but I have picked up about 4 combat helmets and I haven‚Äôt seen the marine one even though I know it‚Äôs out there. It‚Äôs an incredibly rare drop as floor loot so keep an eye out.
---
Yes. The size of a deathclaw.
---
Probably just a crouched dude chucking every grenade they had at you. People make their own fun in this game and spooking the shit out of you was probably their fun. It's like a spooky little randomly generated encounter.
---
Beautifully crafted answer, thank you.
---
lol that sucks - most of the blame does lie with bethesda but part of the blame lies on you as well. 
---
the more armor you put out the more lag is generated in your area, combine that with a nuke blast and every player on the map alsmost fast traveling simultaneously and bad things can definately happen. 
---
as for your L50 ultracite power armor. I have a spare set I can sell you for 1k if you have the caps or i can just give you if you are broke. my ign is garlandtd I will be online tommorrow I will be working the next 10 hours though.
---
The power of gaming.
---
I love this game.
---
Not 100% sure, but the patches were 80Gb total.
---
why thank you
---
By the by, that glitch existed in Fallout 4 too. Mods had to fix that.
---
What's the point of moth man? Is he just another enemy?
---
It's really about better stealth and damage reduction from legendary stats. I have to repair my armor maybe once or twice a month and with White Knight it costs a handful of materials that I never have a shortage of.
---
It would‚Äôve cool if it would also record whatever sounds are going on so you can record a fight and your just screaming incoherently as your battling a Scorchbeast
---
Wait you can actually clean stuff in Washers?
---
Hell yeah we need way more energy weapons
---
When my husband and I first moved in together, we were both adamant that we each have our own Xbox and TV!  We used two dressers side by side to set up our systems.  We knew with as much as we both love gaming, it would be impossible to enjoy playing while the other was making sad faces at us.  lol
---
Thanks, but PS4. I scrapped around 300 bats trying to get pink and eventually gave up. Now I hunt for it.
---
I've found knight under armor plans there but theyre kind of ugly. Theres also some rail cars at watoga that can spawn BOS plans. Today I took the trouble of finding the tnt dome 7 key, just to find the door open and the plans hiding under the table. My luck is 15 but that was just dumb luck.
---
I used to roam the wastes with my wife, but then stardew valley and days gone tore us apart.
---
No idea.. but I got em
---
I still see whitespring getting nuked more. I much prefer nuking the burrows/harpers ferry because it‚Äôs something new. I‚Äôm tired of the whitespring being the go-to nuke zone. 
---
I still haven‚Äôt seen Charleston or Toxic Valley nuked. For good reason, since there aren‚Äôt a lot of high level enemies. I just wanna see it aesthetically in-game one time. Oh wait, duh. I can launch my own nukes.
---
I don‚Äôt think I would have the courage to try something like this
---
Oh MAN yes.  Since a few days before easter I have had lots and lots of these issues.  
---
If you look at my past posts/replies I've been bitching a lot about it.  Was so calm and quiet until then....:(
---
High level enemies that don‚Äôt do a lot of damage and lots of them
---
i assume so i found the same thing
---
Lvl 96 I do a sniper, stealth build, have two handed melee maxed too.
---
I've noticed line of sight detection seems to be weird. I can be 5 miles away from an enemy, but if I'm on the same elevation as him, he miraculously will see me. I used to hide in trees alot, but now I'm al.ost immediately detected.
---
5 miles is 8.05 km
---
&gt; where you see an overarching 'plan' I see them putting out fires here and there haphazardly without broader consideration.
---
I don‚Äôt see some magical grand plan that you don‚Äôt. I just recognize that putting out fires is the first step when your game is this broken.
---
It IS a problem. Fallout 76 is not in a good state. But fixing weapons is a step in the right direction, not the wrong one. Do I wish they would drop their roadmap in favor of serious balance and bug fixes? Absolutely. But then a lot of people might get bored from lack of content and quit. There‚Äôs a lot of things to consider. 
---
&gt; I am however bitter about how PvP has pretty much taken over
---
Personally, I‚Äôm not big into PvP either. But PvP is the de facto end game of most multiplayer games like this. Its essentially endless content that‚Äôs more challenging than anything PvE could hope to achieve, because people are smarter than AI. If the PvP sucks and/or stagnates, they risk losing a large portion of their playerbase that‚Äôs hit end game and doesn‚Äôt have anything else to do. Sure, a lot of players wouldn‚Äôt care, but PvP is very popular. They would be foolish to further shrink their playerbase...
---
Thank you converter bot for the chime in.
---
This is cool! 
---
Is this hopewell cave? Every time I join a new server I go there just for the chance that the deathclaw slides down the wall. It‚Äôs so bad ass.
---
I‚Äôve never even had someone grief my camp (knock on wood). Worst I had with unwanted attention was a duo tried to take munitions factory from me one time but I had a pretty strong build and had set up defenses for that eventuality. Dispatched them no problem. And it‚Äôs not like my base is unnoticeable or tucked away in some corner. I tend to build large and to the camp budget in pretty well travelled areas.
---
I would but my xbox remote is fucked,also what are the uniforms?
---
I've been lucky, my camp is near the 'haunted' cabins in the forest. It's a big warehouse like structure, I have never even seen anyone pass by on the road.
---
Oh HELL yes
---
If I remember the next time I'm on I'll type up a list. There might still be a weekly challenge to craft or drink different types of alcohol and it should have them all listed under that challenge in game, might be gone by now though.
---
Survival mode attracted some griefer players to game, after "caps reward for kill player" decreased, their gluttony didn't feed enough so they started to try their chance at Adventure.
---
Berkeley springs train station.
---
Aaaaaaaaawwwwwww! üòçü•∞
---
Love this. I wore that red dress on my birthday with the vault 76 party hat. :)
---
once you are above level 50 the true grind begins. trying to find good gear and flesh out your build. then when you are perfect.. you just listen to country roads on repeat
---
Lately the animations entering and leaving my power armor have been messy, it has either been a big lag or the animation is just incorrect. So I've stopped playing for a few days hoping this thing go just go away. Before I lose my armor.
---
I wish It captured my frustration of being the only pylon, other than that nice!
---
What did you do to get banned
---
Fixing? After obtaining an AAE Combat Shotgun, I wasn't that impressed. It has its uses, but it's definitely not my go to weapon. One of my best drops was n AAE Handmade, and I'll take that over the shotty any day of the week.
---
I know, it wasnt there in harpers ferry and the thing i was reading didnt mention watoga, went there and found it.
---
So it's like transmog right?
---
This was really well written, thank you for taking the time to post this info for the community. I wish that survival mode had a higher cap payout again. I think this would reduce the amount of people cap farming on workshop PvP.
---
I have one, I‚Äôm on XB1. 1,000 caps and it‚Äôs yours.  I‚Äôm on now.
---
if you turn your passive mode on your electically charged wont hit them
---
Also make sure your guns aren't under leveled. find a crafting station and craft higher level guns. Guns level at 10,20,30.40.45,50.
---
Anybody with good intentions will be added. If they disobey the rules I‚Äôve listed they will be banned. In terms of uniform, I am of the belief that everyone is their own person. Wear what you like. If a member is in trouble we contact other members for help.
---
I am on the Xbox and I have renamed a lot of my equipment from the first day we were able to and haven't experienced any problems with lossing or drop.
---
Hi NoddyBowWow,

(‚Äâwhy did I name you FO76newb‚Äâ?‚ÄÇI'm guessing it's your r/fo76 name.‚Äâ)

 BTW what is a "GT"‚Äâ?‚ÄÇI'm a newb.

Thanks for the complement on my Favorites Wheel advice.

I corrected some confusing errors I had made in it, and added some other

---
How do you do that?
---
maybe that‚Äôll be the contents of the whole nuclear winter thing.
---
it‚Äôs probably just cut content and nuclear winter is gonna be a fancier survival mode but i like to keep the hope alive
---
Nevermind, I have the mascot head and outfit, not the imposter stuff.
---
go to the market76 reddit everone there has a karma score pertained just to that subreddit that shows they are trusted or not
---
first step? did you start playing yesterday?
---
I would save the flux. You need it to upgrade your under armor. You can also make fusion cores out of it but fusion cores are easy to come by and run out and are gone but upgraded armor always is upgraded. PSA: The Vault Suit can be upgraded to S+1, E+2, I+2, L+2. Check the wiki for other under armors if those stats don‚Äôt quite match up with your build but definitely hold onto that flux.
---
This change wouldn't be too bad if fuel was a more common drop. Most ammo is crafted in batches of 10-30 with mini gun ammo being the only exception, so the proposed amount of 20 ammo isn't horrible. But most other ammo also drops from enemies at a reasonable pace and can be found in ammo crates. I've only found fuel on an enemy once.
---
If an enemy type (like Mr handy's for example) would drop fuel, the planned crafting costs coming in patch 9 would be a bit more reasonable.
---
it is under settings
---
go to setting the last option under "game" is pacifist mode
---
Aim for the face or unprotected area of the enemy. They are easier to take down that way.
---
Its not a latency issue. Im on FIOS. 500 up and 500 down. 
---
I just unloaded point black on level 5 ghouls, again im level 9, and their HP didn't move.  
---
I used a different gun, I was point black on a mob 4 levels lower than me and I was practically kissing it.
---
  
---
Its not a latency issue, it isn't a weapon issue, its a game issue. I did a quick google search and this was a problem not too long ago. But those videos and complaints are 1.5 to 2 months old. Is this still happening?
---
Looks like home!
---
as far as the survival thing goes i don't think they will change that it's supposed to be full time pvp there
---
Well again, after the initial glitch, im able to practically 1 shot the mobs afterwards with the same weapon.
---
but don't forget to turn that off if you wanna attack someone
---
Was this on xbox. Might have been there with you
---
Its in the Dev room. Pc players aren't supposed to have it. So be careful if you do pick one up at some point.
---
If you‚Äôre going with a 10mm SMG than it‚Äôs gonna be commando with demolition expert
---
I have no idea. I'm on satellite and I'm killing things within a second.
---
My favorite spawn ever was when half my house spawned in( I live over the edge of a cliff NE of WS), and the other half didn't spawn and I walked upstairs and fell straight through the massive missing floor to my immediate death, and then disconnected from the server. Now a days I wait a good 30 seconds before moving after I load in.
---
Ah ok. I don‚Äôt really enjoy using PA that much so cores won‚Äôt be a issue for me. I‚Äôm assuming the only way to get more flux is by doing the Scorched Earth Event over and over again?
---
I don‚Äôt mean to sound rude, but what exactly would you want Bethesda to do? What seems reasonable?
---
The gatling will be your go-to heavy weapon for its accuracy and its efficiency. You're going to want to fully spec in strength and intelligence with at least 8 in luck.

For now, grind in whitesprings and the burrows for a good deal of 1 star legendaries to get you started.

Demolition expert boosts explosive damage of all explosive weapons

I've noticed if you switch weapons they immediately detect you.

Make it to where you cant greif in adventure mode.

Grief the griefers get what they want and hold up where they can‚Äôt get you, that‚Äôs what I do. It‚Äôs fun. Last night it started WW3 and was awesome. Looked like a damn war zone on the map, someone dragged over a war base too.
---
They‚Äôre (supposedly) gonna not allow camp damage from PvP in adventure mode in an upcoming patch.
---
Of course, that means two other things will break when they do that.
---
This guy is living the dream.
---
Probably waiting for you guys to die so he can take your junk.
---
You can gather it raw in nuked zones but you need several other materials from the nuke zone to stabilize it. High radiation fluid, hardened mass and maybe some other stuff I can‚Äôt remember right now. I only made flux to upgrade a couple under armors but other than that I haven‚Äôt really fooled around with it much.
---
That amazing, I love that.

Responders are a doctor-type faction, it‚Äôs possible those Chems were being used for their medicinal purposes

This won't work in 76. There is an overwhelming abundance of just about everything in the game and virtually no uses for caps. If there was a simple way for players to trade with all other players, everyone would have easy access to what they want at any time. Vending machines are about as good as it can get without destroying incentive to continue to play the game.
---
3.7K for the most useful mutation? WHERE?
---
What does the Sheepsquatch Shard do?
---
pretty easy at level 55 with your level 250 friends
---
The free market made a choice and WV failed to adapt to changing times, unlike most red states. Which is why they take more federal dollars than they give
---
That‚Äôs the thing, we died once before we got to Flatwoods and when we got back all our stuff was still there. It was super weird. My theory is that he just got bored and decided to watch some ‚Äúnew‚Äù players to see how they would react to the game.
---
How good is the Riot Shotgun? I run a shotgun build.
---
On xb at least, it uses the saved data file the game creates. These are limited in size to keep a game from hogging your whole drive. They have to be stored there or else the game couldnt use them as loading screens. The consoles built in screenshot capability is different, and allows manipulation closer to a real file system. But, no way to hook those into loading screens.
---
nope that's working as intended. they most likely did that to get a bounty so people would try to hunt them and they would get some pvp, or they're just douche canoes out being stupid. 
---
KEY LEARNING POINT keep your junk stored. you will access it from any workbench you use anywhere in the game. you did not need to have it on your body. 
---
ANOTHER KEY LEARNING POINT If you had a public workshop claimed you were signed up for pvp and they have the ability to kill you and destroy your shop,camp, or personal body without getting any bounty at all. they can contest your shop then travel to you anywhere on the map to kill you. make sure if you have a shop you stay crouched if you don't want people to see you on the map. 
---
if they started meleeing your base and you attacked them that was a mistake because they wouldnt be able to hurt you otherwise. best course of action if youre outmatched is to immediately server hop. when they start wrecking the camp its usually to provoke the owner into attacking them or to get  big bounty to lure other pvpers. 
---
you are only worth 41 caps so it seems more likely they were getting a bounty to lure bounty hunters. or you know just to be dicks cause they can. 
---
anyways don't let them taint your view of the general public in 76 99% of the player base is amazingly nice.
---
Your artwork is amazing.
---
How so is 76 a mobile game? Just wondering whats going on in your head?
---
No, it needs to stay isolated.
---
Thus sounds amazing. Iove exploring other players camps, but if they could leave notes/holotapes that could make camps so much more interesting!
---
I'd rather notes personally, I don't trust the general population with my eardrums. So many people would just scream into their mic and think it's hilarious.
---
Isn't there also a similar one of the BoS leadership?
---
The one I forgot was glowing mass. So you need 1 of each of: hardened mass, glowing mass, high radiation fluid, and 10 raw flux of the same variety. Another PSA: don‚Äôt craft anything without the Super Duper perk card equipped. It gives you a chance to double whatever you‚Äôre crafting.
---
I somehow missed your journal completely, that's one of the best things I've seen yet from FO76, official products included. Amazing work, you deserve the swag!
---
i appreciate it anyway dude ^^

Or maybe he wanted to stuff and mount you..welcome to the Wasteland

you get those from breaking down combat armor pieces that is all ...you can find mods for these but not plans
---
Fuckin‚Äô crazies
---
Awesome I found it! Now I want to find the other two!
---
I've read several posts here on Reddit there are players that like to just play games with other players and meaning no harm. Similar to the one that leaves a bag of fertilizer on people's beds. LoL
---
the best version of the combat armor is the BOS lining
---
Which workshop did you have?
---
I heard about that guy, I strive to be him
---
Appreciate the incite. 
---
1) now makes since, cause I didn't know what the Mutants health was. 89\*3 is only 267 so it would take 3 hits. 
---
2) still have no idea, I think my enclave has grounded but I thought gauss was ballistic damage. The AAE laser has a scatter mod so it causes a lot of explosions, that might be why. 
---
3) still have no idea but TSE Gatling is broken and the 10mm is really disappointing
---
This is basically what ruins the game for me. I love playing, mostly with my wife. But she's not a very aggressive player and I don't have the best build for pvp, so we get slaughtered pretty easily if they're in a group or just have a powerful build/weapon. We enjoy putting hours into building new workshops or weapons, trying to find new items, or complete mindless side quests and gather tons of junk. But when we're at a work bench and some asshole comes in and one shots both of us and takes control of all of hard work it makes it suck.
---
The worst part is I know it's some 9 year old with 10 times as much free time as me, or some 35 year old fat ass is his mom's basement doing it. In real life they're just little bitches so they have to be tough shit on a video game and ruin it for everyone else.
---
They've been in the game since launch, if I'm remember correctly. No use as of yet
---
the emote could be a simple one, the Player pulls out a toy missile and throws it into the air, when it lands it makes a tiny boom
---
I had no idea about this. Thank you. I had been rocking the treated operative under armor and had no idea that something better existed. I need the enclave shielded according to the wiki.
---
I found it with some help, it‚Äôs directly south of Yellow Sandy‚Äôs Still. That is west of Berkeley Springs

What about your missile turrets?
---
It doesn‚Äôt make you place it somewhere else. If you stay in the server and join another server where your camp is placed it‚Äôll be placed in the same location.
---
I'd like to see all of that along with either the ability to plant the more exotic crops (firecap, glowing fungus, snaptail reeds, brain fungus, cranberries, etc, etc) OR the ability to craft a Mentat variant that would highlight harvestable plants for a certain amount of time.

---
if you choose to stay on the server it will not erase your camp , it is just worded oddly you will be fine playing on that server and next time you switch your camp will still be there
---
It is, but I thought the contrast with my camp was rather striking.  It's also the first one I've seen in about 500 hours of game play.
---
hmm Someone signed pepe. I didn't know lady devann worked in the office, I always thought she was one of us for some reason.

I play with my 9 year old son, we have been tearing up the wastes for a bit.  This game offers more than the Fortnite crap he was playing.  Like this story you shared, adventures with your closest people in your life is priceless

That was pretty amazing. Amazing job on the journal, and awesome they gave back.
---
I am super jealous of that poster.

Ooooooooooo

It is a great pic.

I‚Äôll admit it. I‚Äôve been doing this since I got the Easter bunny mask. No harm intended. I just think it‚Äôs fun/funny. However, I will jump in and help if someone is about to get killed. I also leave bags of water and low level gear.  Sorry no chocolate.

Thank you, I was glad I had the Pro Snap hotkeyed, the storm dissipated about 90 seconds after I got the picture.

I wish I could get my wife into this game.

Watch out for this guy. Word on the street is he killed more than 600,000 Americans.

Every time someone says white springs I think of good springs and mother fucking easy Pete

Hmmm why didnt you just turn on pacifist mode?

I really want this to happen, if for no other reason then so I can fast travel into the Whitespring after someone nukes the area.

You can also use it to make ultracite ammo and faction grenades (orbital strike and what not)
---
I like leaving it on so I can pray and spray into the middle of chaotic combat without getting wanted
---
You get a little vaultboy animation and a pretty loud notification noise when nerdrage activates. When not in the middle of combat you can always check your active effects on your pipboy
---
I never understood why they went with this "receivers affect damage" model, with 4, instead of going back to the original system that's, you know, based on reality instead of bullshit and magic.
---
You're a madman and a genius. I can respect that.
---
Really? I don't really keep up with the news, that'll be awesome.

I saw a player with one once.  I was puzzling over it for a while.

I‚Äôll add you and next time I see you on I‚Äôll join you.

I'm in, as long as we are following the non-aggression principle.

Thanks for the detailed reply! Those tips sound like they'll come in handy.
---
oh I don't ever turn mine off I never PVP in this game I was just warning him just in case. I know sometimes people forget
---
Understand ppl without good gear hoping for the best. But its better to not have any expectations - that way it can be positive. I dont honestly think the vendor is gonna throw out god rolls in anyway.
---
It would kind of break the point of a loot game imo

I just sold my camera

Well that's a drag lol. You need one or the other, the pearly peepers or the camera, as they both have ZOOM. I wasn't too bummed about having scrapped the PP's though because the camera zoom (although I suspect it doesn't zoom in QUITE as much as the PP's did) NAMES the bodies in the viewfinder and you can use that to find the stupid Imposter Sheepscrotch after you kill it

I tried to get my boyfriend to play with no luck, but I‚Äôve met some great people on here that I regularly play with...a married couple included. You two are awesome!!

If you have a good team of Scortchbeast killers you will have someone who focuses on keeping her crippled...  On the ground and also crippling her wings while she is in the air causing her to land.
---
It's not a glitch it's just good tactics.
---
That's what you're supposed to do is cripple her because she takes too many bullets to kill in the air and it's way harder

Im to high a level to spawn normal alphas and the one that spawn already dead were being glitched by the game as traveling merchants. I couldn't complete the challege in time

I am soooooooooooooo frickin happy for you!!! I commented on your original post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfi4eb/the\_vault\_dwellers\_journal\_76\_pages\_of\_printed/?sort=old](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfi4eb/the_vault_dwellers_journal_76_pages_of_printed/?sort=old)) how proud I am of you and your work. So amazing. And the fact that Bethesda responded so positively is even more reason why I love Bethesda and this community. It all gives me the happy feelz! Great job, Shia and Bethesda!
---
Game was glitching the alpha death claws that spawn alive or dead. Every non event spawn gives me lvl91 glowing matriachs. I got robbed of being able to complete daily quest due to the pasta filatta that is this games code.

Better yet, can we get piggy back rides on super mutants? The other mutants will keep shooting at us.

Which ones can you think of?? üôÉ

You two are what I strive to be one day.

Oh wow that's neat! I want one too lol üòÇ

Hey just so you know, taking that Marsupial serum *did* do something. It gave you the pure form of the mutation for one hour of gameplay, no negative effect. Starched Genes doesn‚Äôt inhibit the use of serums, and taking a serum for a mutation you already have gives you that pure form.
---
You may just need to trigger it.  Go to the area it starts in, the three in game,  and it may start up

The problem with discord is, and btw I have discord. What if your computer is not in the same room as your xbox?? What if you can't move you pc to your xbox for personal reasons?? What if that is your office/work pc? Hey what if your like ME and your PC and xbox is both hooked up into the TV and they are on separate inputs?? Should I need to change inputs (and go away from my game) EVERY time I want to check to see if there is a message and discord? Not everyone has the same configuration as you in their livingroom or bedroom. Not everyone has the necessary configuration and fumbling with a phone while playing your game is both tedious and cumbersome. On a side note there are a lot of disabilities that make a mic not an option, some people are deaf and need subtitles for NPC dialog and cannot hear players on their mic, there are some people that can hear but have a condition to where they cannot speak or disabled vocal cords. BTW I can't use a mic because everyone here sleeps and different times. You say, "Talk quieter" paraphrasing what you, "If you can't talk quite enough to not wake your family members, then you don't have self-control", really dude? It's not that simple. Talking quite don't work here, we have light sleepers and dogs that will bark if you make too much noise and then so even if you are quite enough, the dogs barking at you will wake people up.   
---
Keyboard chat on screen and ON your game, is far more practical than having to use discord on a separate monitor. In same cases the ladder is not an option because of some peoples configuration in their own house.  
---
LOOK. How hard is: turn off keyboard chat if YOU don't like it? How hard is that?  
---
Game wishlists are not about YOU but about everyone. You don't want to say suck it to everyone who cannot use a mic for the endlist list of possible reasons simply because YOU don't like how an on-screen chat looks as far as aesthetics. BTW I play runescape and on-screen chat is very much a good thing and not really as bad as you make it seem. Like the on-screen chat in runescape is really only bad when you go to certain high populated areas like the Grand Exchange. and even then it's not too bad, I can find my friend chat message and if I can't that is what private chat is for.

Just hop servers like damn

Interesting.. Never added them up to check. Is this when you scrap it all (T)?

Cool idea
---
Yup

There was no need to. He wasn‚Äôt doing anything harmful, he was just watching us
---
I outlined the reasons as to why workshops are specifically targeted. It has nothing to do with being able to 'hack it' in survival. There is zero incentive to pvp on survival.
---
People take workshops because of Ammo/Food/Junk/Fusion Cores.
---
This post is not about CAMP targeting, not even sure why it's part of the discussion. There's no incentive to destroy CAMPs other than baiting people into hunting you.
---
But way to engage with the material.
---
Hunters Longcoat?

Yah I'm blown away!
---
I gotta say its an awesome poster.

There‚Äôs video on YT, guy fighting 2 SBQ at the same time. May be your new challenge, if you don‚Äôt like one that‚Äôs crippled by tactics. I know it‚Äôs weird, but ppl were complaining that SB never lands, now they figured how to make her.
---
The poster was the diamond on the cake, all those great silvery signatures and now when I get it framed and look at the poster I slapped on my shack in game I can look on my wall and see it there too!
---
Oh well carry on

a rare pepe to be sure
---
Thanks, I'm proud of it. Spent a lot of time and had fun with it.
---
It's  different for everyone. You can respawning in again for different goods
---
Thank you for saying so, but it seems that any neutral/pro-pvp post gets brigaded by the couch-fainters. I really do think this topic really requires a deeper understanding by the community as a whole. There is a massive stigma around PvP in general, and the way it's implemented right now doesn't help its image at all.
---
I don't know if the caps incentive would work as a primary motivator, but it wouldn't hurt. I've considered trying to do a thoughtful write-up on potential incentives that could lead PvP to be encouraged more dramatically on Survival Mode but honestly, it's a real challenge unless they also remove the incentives in Adventure Mode or alter them dramatically.

Stay safe.

[Lady janets soft serve](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_Janet%27s_Soft_Serve) you spawn behind the building run west down the road towards the bus on its side this spawns a random encounter including the vendor and nobody puts their camp there just be careful of any enemies that spawn because they can kill the vendor if they follow you down the road

I got a response from Bethesda in my thread about this same bug.  Here's the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgzinw/walls_clipping_through_floors/
---
And on another side note. Those who say that there should be no on-screen keyboard chat don't seem to be protesting against the on-screen keyboard chat in ESO. Which makes the implication on-screen key chat is good for ESO but shouldn't be on FO76, which seems somewhat contradictory. Yes, they are not the same game, they have different lore and a different universe but as far as what the functions are in the game, they both have similarities there, crafting stations, trading, quest/missions. PVP and non-PVP. Players working together in PVE, ect. I do agree BTW that there are a lot of other important things that should be fixed or added into the game that may even ought to be a higher priority but that is no good reason to boot key-chat off the wishlist.
---
yeah, it would be so easy to have instanced rooms and floors too, allowing everyone on the server to have a room at Whitesprings. In addition to their camp even.

He's not even here about the nuke.  It was the naughty stuff.

Oh man I have that every time I load the game and fast travel back.  All my stuff is broken.  But I look at the bright side -- that I do get frequent xp, junk, and meat from it. :).

And gardens attract them even MORE frequently.

Works fine for me, had only once a freeze when there was a nuke on Whitesprings.

I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve decided to go searching for more, though. I‚Äôll report back!

?, Maria chavez (responders uniform)?, ?, Sanjay Kumar?

I was in pacifist earlier today and my mutation still went off when a wanted person attacked me

I agree that‚Äôs Chavez.

I just build a floating house couple days ago and I keep getting high lv stuff spawn inside my house or items like literally inside my fusion generator. Took me a while to figure where it was till I saw the generator health keep dropping . Ughhh.

I'm going to start my own hotel with blackjack and hookers... in fact, forget the blackjack.

I was in pacifist earlier and my mutation still went off to a wanted player
---
It's a quest reward, not worth too much since it is technically infinitely farmable and most high level players will have sold theirs off already
---
yes it still goes off it just doesnt hurt them therefore it doesnt provoke pvp
---
Gauss is ballistic damage, but it has the WeaponTypeEnergy keyword, so it is affected by Grounded.

It did for me. I don‚Äôt get why

I just wanna grab them by the collar and be like LISTEN HERE BUD, THAT'S MINE AND I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU BREAKING IT
---
Depends on where you go. Just avoid train stations and common areas and you're generally pretty safe. I keep a maximum of four stimpaks on me, and that's all for aid. As long as you're okay with occasionally losing some caps/aid, you should be good. The best thing you could do at your level is server hopping after clearing out WestTek. That way, you can level up crazy fast, and get legendaries that prevent you from getting creamed in survival mode in the first place.

Mr Squeeze held the fight almost an entire second.

How we know you look like this charracter? There is no prof! :D

I too enjoy making characters who looks like me, then i get overpowered build so i don't feel like useless nerd. In the end i like wearing dress so i can't have male character anymore. I did change appearance too many times.

Mr. Squeeze's NPC settings are set to essential. Like Graham, he can't be harmed or take damage, and is a lemonade-slinging force of nature.

You can get serums from players who have learned the recipes, going rate is around 300 caps each. Buying them from the bunker is just a waste of caps.

No lie, I'd \*totally\* do a melee character for that. Load up on Fireproof and Dense modded armor and play smack-a-ghoul.

At least to me the most i have seen for the player count of a survival server is 5 but maybe that's just here in australia
---
YES
---
I'd love to see a x100 scale up from those dinky little guys outside the Vault. I'd fight them just b/c it would be pure fun
---
Yes black one is t-60 representing death horsemen
---
Blue one is t-51 representing famine horsemen
---
I think it'll offer "god rolls", but at a significant cost, either through randomization systems or through limited stock/server searching. Or just friggen expensive.
---
What did you say to them? I had the same thing happen to me, I just raged about the lack of 2 step confirmation for purchasing and how 1200 for reskined emotes was a fucking joke

They got back to me the same day and all was good afterwards

I have been leveling a toon soley in survival to answer this question, I personally can level way faster in adventure. There are just too many things working against you in survival. If they removed the map markers it -might- be viable, but as of right now you are better off just leveling normally in adventure

Handy J's in the back? Sucky sucky 5 scrip! Mole love you long time.

There is a behemoth spawn SE of whitesprings that always has around 4 nuclear waste on its body

Scrapping/selling/moving anything too fast will sometimes ‚Äúgrab‚Äù a different item from your inventory. I can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs the cause of everything, but it absolutely happens. I was moving junk to a bag, was in the junk tab, hitting E (move/confirm on PC) really fast, and I saw something strange flash by. I check through the tabs, and what do you know, there‚Äôs a couple hundred rounds of ammo in the bag now.
---
I would love to be able to leave messages in both note and holotape form. It'd add to that "just missed 'em by a minute" feel of Appalachia.
---
Same, bring on the merch bethesda
---
Congratulations!  
---
I hope that this is the beginning of a terrific relationship between you and Bethesda!
---
Wow so many people on that poster. I thought there are like 5devs. Hah.
---
I am so jealous, beautiful art and reward for crafting quest too.
---
Same thing happened to me this week.
---
Not a fan of invincibility, he should just die and respawn. Common he sells lemonade and hard lemonade, and the recipe for both.
---
That's cute asl
---
I'd say he's essential because he's a vendor, but the wandering protection vendor can be killed, so... I dunno.
---
And they need to add the small razorgrain models that they use at some farms. I hate the big bulky ones.
---
go to SuperAussieViking on youtube and watch the latest video it explains everything
---
Hell to the yes! 
---
Hope your new home is a happy one!   üè°üëç
---
well kids CAN be a big attention diversion, they need so much. But a bit of fruit punch and kitten paws on a journal page can add a lot of flavor.
---
Thanks!
---
HOW DARE YOU FUCK WITH *MY* LEMONADE STAND
---
I was at that fight and the Queen's a breeze with Mr Squeeze.
---
Congrats buddy! You have tasted sweet RNG victory on this day!
---
**Please insert coin to continue **
---
Kanawawawawa Nuka Cola Plant
---
Congrats, now u are immortal tank.
---
What I did was use the straight jacket and tattered mole head. People ran when I revved the chainsaw
---
Definitely just had this happen to me. Got out of power armor, put it my inventory. Deployed it again after fast traveling and now I'm missing an arm.
---
The workshop at the far south of the Savage Divide, the disposal site, has slots for three nuclear material extractors.
---
I would be happy to sell you one of mine, I have a normal lvl 50 black stand fast and a lvl 50 BOS stand fast. I'll be online again in the morning
---
Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 workshop has 3 uranium deposits.
---
The gods of dakka have smiled upon you this day.
---
üôè
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
What‚Äôs taters precious?!
---
I played many mobile games and I am currently still playing some, and Fallout 76 is not one of them, I don't even know how you came to that conclusion...
---
Congrats.  Love the feeling when you get a great 3* and can‚Äôt believe your eyes.
---
give us the assault rifle from fo3
---
I keep calling it Whiterun by accident.  Should make a character named Balgruff the lesser and run around with a Grognak's axe claiming I'm looking for the dragonborn.
---
Campfire = planters
---
I quit the game and had to reload immediately to make sure it was still in my inventory!
---
Nice art work. I wish I could draw!
---
Thank the gods!
---
:-)
---
The Sexual Assaultron!
---
LOLOLOL.  Yes.  I got a pocked full of quarters.
---
You doing the weird incel  ‚Äúwomen are historically inaccurate‚Äù thing but about a mole monster from the future?
---
That's fine, but why doesn't she use her sonic attack? I know that can do that while they're on the ground.
---
Thank you so much! I couldn‚Äôt get it to work until I did this.
---
I was about to say I have a bunch and always get it from glowing enemies. I see them alot but whitesprings/ nuke zones is a good bet for glowing enemies
---
Haha yeah but the whole notebook was soaked and the kittens not only lapped at juice but also decided the laser pointer on it was just to die for so the thing got not only soaked in fruit punch but tore all the way up. Lol was kinda funny see the entire sequence of scenes play out.
---
Probably because her mouth is busted
---
Far from just me... that‚Äôs why PvP has there own server or if someone takes a workshop. I fortunately there are quite a few asshats that just go around messing with people and destroying camps. 
---
Bethesda has listened and I‚Äôm quite sure some will try to figure out someway to take out their aggressions on people that don‚Äôt want to play with them... 
---
My comment stands due to so many complaining about getting destroyed in survival mode. Of course we knew that was happening and we also knew players would come back pissed after losing a lot of their stuff. I get it. 
---
I‚Äôm glad Bethesda did this moving forward for all the players that don‚Äôt want anything whatsoever to do with PvP. 
---
I appreciate your words but but many other players words count as well. Bethesda now has two methods of play.
---
No, in your pipboy items under junk.
---
Vampire Explosive .50 cal? That's pretty sweet. Grats on the loot slot machine giving you something worthwhile.
---
I got 9 Charisma and Hard Bargain x3 and they still cost 18,000.
---
I‚Äôve failed a imposter event when only 2 other players showed up, that‚Äôs it. If I focus, I might be able to solo it, but I have to prep buffs and find a few more pieces of gear. 
---
I can solo free range with zero issues (low health HW/PA build).
---
In the cranberry bog there's the Creekside Sundew Grove, and It might take a few hopes, but you'll eventually find one. When they released the Sheepsquatch, that same day we had to kill a Megasloth for 20 atoms, and at that same spot is where I've seen them before, but I got about 5 Sheepsquatches before finding one Megasloth.
---
Gauss pistol and the pulse rifle would rule.
---
Bloodied when you are low health is like 60% bonus damage. So executioner at 50% is going to be worse, yeah.
---
118 caps per shot. however you can make much more in pve for a lot less risk and effort so I don't think that its really about the caps. I am worth 202 caps per death but I also use a lot of fusion cores because my main weap is a laser gatling. If I see the shop is being contested I just quit game and go to another server. If they need fusion cores and want to farm then I want them to have it and I'm glad to have helped set the shop up. in fact I always leave the resource machines unlocked so if other people need the stuff they can "steal" it without getting wanted. If they contested the shop in order to kill me for caps and I leave before they can kill me then I have cost them whatever the contest cost was for the camp. If I get attacked and killed I respawn far away and instantly log out to go to another server. its only worth their time if you lose your cool and keep coming back to be farmed. in my case is 200 caps per death and in the past when I've lost my temper I've given up 1k plus caps without realizing it. giving up the shop is never  big deal I only invest the shops resources into them and since I make so much money not going out and pvping paying to set up a new shop is quick and easy. oh also I have premade buildings I can just plop down. I literally claim, drop premade building, profit.
---
*notices camp, hides just out of range to plink away at the building with pinpoint accuracy*
---
"Why are you still having a go at me?". Sure, I am having a go at your arguments with count-arguments in the fashion of healthy debate.
---
"I can see a use for on screen chat". Ok well then, it must have been buried in the what looked like mostly argument against key-chat. I am sorry I  overlooked it?
---
"Learn to read before you angrily type and did you use your PC to type this lengthy, unnecessary reply?". Addressing this as a inguire and not an ad hominem, I will politely inform you that I know how to read.
---
What even is an "unecessary reply". To you, what would constitute as an "unecessary reply". I address claims and arguments that have said and they still stand for any other that wished to read as to why I don;t think discord is a subsitute for on-screen key chat.
---
"Or was it a mobile phone?". It was my PC.
---
Yea that seems to work better well.
---
I thought the BOS upgrade plans are no longer in the game, haven't seen them anywhere in months...
---
Yeah seems more active than that in my experience
---
*screams*
---
Nuked Whitesprings! (Also like another person said: glowing mole miners)
---
When you're looking through the camera lens and their name show up then it will count as the picture I'm sure you guys already know this though
---
High damage and if it‚Äôs a furious Grognak Axe more consecutive damage after each hit. But it‚Äôs a novelty item from lore and a fan favorite for that reason alone.
---
Totally deserved! I was following your journal the whole way through, it was bloody brilliant -, always got me hyped at work to come home and explore Appalachia!
---
So true. Destiny 2 strike bosses:
---
Arms Dealer - giant Centurion  
---
Lake of Shadows - giant Taken Centurion  
---
Savathun's Song - giant Shrieker  
---
Inverted Spire - giant Minotaur  
---
The Pyramidion - giant Hobgoblin
---
Etc.
---
mole miners, any glowing animal, or any shop that has a radiation mining area. I have to run a resource extractor occasionally to stock back up but as a general rule I loot plenty from the glowy mobs.
---
not just you I was seeing that earlier as well.
---
Apparently they can drop from treasure maps although I'm having no luck with them
---
They are fine from the SBQ, they need to be removed from the atom shop.
---
Pacifist mode prevents you from accidentally hitting someone, it doesn‚Äôt prevent others from destroying your base.
---
Ahhh! I see what you mean now. Thanks for letting me know kindly. :)

|Explosive Shotgun Bug Fixes
---
|We‚Äôre also implementing fixes for a pair of bugs affecting shotguns that have the explosive legendary effect. The first was causing them to deal double damage, rather than the 20% increase the explosive effect is intended to provide. The second issue was causing the Pip-Boy to display lower damage numbers than explosive shotguns were actually dealing to your targets. While these aren‚Äôt true balance changes, it‚Äôs important that we address these issues to bring more consistency to both the displayed and actual damage output of explosive shotguns.
---
Ok, good talk coach! Go team you for dragging this out like a dinner party that went south a long time ago, much like the pint of you criticising someone who can see a point for it but it needs to be implemented well and not to clutter up the UI - at this point, Bethesda track record for getting it right from the outset is slim...
---
yup if you dont mind wierdly floating corn thats eternally on fire you can just plant the crops indoors....i think ive just talked myself into indoor gardening.
---
I love playing the game but if we're being honest the hate is mostly warranted
---
Actually you bust her legs too. All of them. I run shotguns so I do a lot of that.
---
I'd rather the queen recovered faster, hit harder and sponged fewer bullets, but currently the correct tactic is to pin her on the ground and pour damage into her face.
---
they can be found laying around in the world is all for now just very rare
---
The loot chances are terrible in this game for the time invested. Seriously.
---
It should have a cooldown so it doesn't spawn enemies every single time you travel back.
---
Yes. Renting rooms @ Whitsprings would be nice. There's some pretty nice looking Assaultron Fembots I've been meaning to \*ahem\* uh...entertain.
---
Ah yes, the Snallygaster, or as I like to call it: the dick monster with too many eyes from my nightmares
---
I call it submarining. theres no fast travel in survival mode so I go to where i want to hunt in adventure then swap to survival mode kill the are go back to adventure rinse repeat. if you avoid the train stations and obvious hotspots like whitespring its rare you even see other people.
---
I was thinking something very similar. Like I enjoy fighting the enemies the SBQ spawns more then then fighting her. Why not make that a game mode and get resources for it.
---
Good job, dude. This has been annoying me for ever.
---
As fun as the idea could be, it would probably be heavily exploited/manipulated, and with current weapon balancing... yea. It's nothing that would ever happen soon, or ever for that matter...
---
I've been waiting for my legendary shotgun from her.
---
Glad it worked for you. :)
---
Cut to the OP's thread next week, "I accidentally sold my Vamp .50cal to the Enclave Vendor! WTF!! R.I.P"
---
Just a bug.
---
I love that they don‚Äôt scale. I have gotten some amazing low level 3 star loot that is actually worth a lot of caps or trade items. Anything with exploding or weight reduction armor is king.
---
I know this is 9 days later, but it happens with the flat roofs, too.
---
I run a vampiric laser gat. pretty much cant die unless I try now.
---
Ooh, what platform?
---
This is so wholesome and the comments just make my heart melt. Thank you guys for sharing
---
I think it might be some kind of server lag? because sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. Just picked up a bunch more plastic, and it seems to be the same. I dunno man.
---
SAME. firecaps are a pain to find sometimes. I really hope they add this and planters soon.
---
theres no real economy to speak of for us to be the NPCs and that's the biggest problem,  lack of vendors, atleast inflation is low on caps but who wants caps
---
Yes, the worst casino slot machine still pays back 80%
---
I have been using it to double farm locations for xp or creature based loot drops. ie fast travel to big bend for example. kill everything log to survival kill everything again log back to adventure mode select next destination.
---
Still no buff to Flamer damage? Pointless buffing the ammo if no-one wants to use the gun because its so weak.
---
I will be a heavy gunner and love the .50 from my other character. Congrats!
---
CHAP....STICK
---
disappointment*
---
yeah a mod workbench where you can see a list of armor,weapon, and power armor mods. For example you select weapons then you find combat rifle in the list and it shows you all the mods you know for that weapon (and maybe the ones your missing?) you choose a mod and you can craft it. Costs the same as modding a weapon resources and required perks without having to attach it to a gun.
---
I run a vats crit commando build, I use the laser mostly for long range kills that are outside of vats range. The main perk you want is tank killer though for the stagger, and I‚Äôve even heard enforcer works for it also, when you have the splitter mod.
---
Where do you find her?
---
yup I have one to its great. i think the more popular it gets the more it risks being nerfed though.
---
definitely, and server hopping
---
That'd be me. And the Purveyor's new outfit being the same red and green as Garrahan HQ and the same yellow as the Excavator PA certainly isn't changing my mind any!
---
Nice!
---
Hmm well shit. Also realize that some people run the empath mutation, and everyone in their team runs the same mutation which adds a huge chunk of damage mitigation almost equivalent to assassin sentinel armor. If you combine them both what you get is a super tanky build that usually only crit builds can take out, because crits ignore all that damage mitigation.
---
Some people even run two clients at once and have a level 1 with the empath perk on their team, hidden somewhere across the map, just for the extra buff.
---
Kill me now!
---
Best of luck!  Hope you get it soon.  That would be sweet.
---
Yes, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the one in the police uniform is Melody Larkin.  There is apparently a picture of Jeff Nakamura with Amy Kerry (who you hear during the Ecological Balance quests) but I haven‚Äôt found it yet.
---
So you put level 0 locks to prevent people from getting it?
---
Lil fella just thirsty
---
OMW!
---
The 20% more damage explosive effect on each pellet is far from intended... 
---
And it's overpowered as hell, so it's not really a nerf (the kind of overpowered where it's well beyond balanced. It's not *slightly* overpowered, it's *beyond* overpowered). I'd only consider it a nerf if they balanced the explosive damage to be almost non-existent. It should still somehow amount to 20% more damage though.
---
That‚Äôs awesome.
---
Barn stars? Do you mean the communist stars you see on houses?
---
This one was at the lighthouse tower.
---
They need a small fusion generator that gives like 50 power.
---
making her hard is just going to cost more for the same shit luck chance of getting anything decent. it will also make it harder for lowbies to get in there and learn it. I would like to see different other types of big bosses like the sheepsquatch and stuff . I feel her difficulty is about right. really hard if no one knows what they're doing but easy if they do. a good team can finish her off super fast but I've showed up at some that failed completely,
---
You dont sound very sorry.
---
Thats a poop knife.
---
I have a Medics explosive .44 pistol but it's only lvl 35
---
Disappointed
---
That's for the recipe, the serum itself is cheaper (and one use).
---
I feel like they won't need an entire fusion generator themselves.. Nothing in the game comes close to that being a requirement.
---
Source?
---
Thanks!  You have no idea how sick I've been of looking.  Hope the plans were useful.
---
Thanks for the plans, dude! Not necessary but very nice of you. :)
---
+karma
---
Not Communist: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar
---
Just thought this game would be better.
---
 I want to take risssskkkkkss sbut I can't handle the consequences UGH FUCK BETHESDA UGH FUCK STOP RAPING ME UGH GOD
---
Wow you must have a lot of time on your hands and get bored easily.
---
You‚Äôve owned this game for 149 days and you want your money back now?    Pathetic.
---
maybe if pvp wasnt about who could one shot each other first more peeps would do it. currently there's only one meta (bloodied) and all fights are generally over in one hit or shot. if you want me to go in and have fun pvping then you need to take the cap penalty out of dying. have to wait a full ingame day to make 1600 caps. at level 200 thats 8 deaths before you lose all profit from sales. its just not worth it.
---
My experience of it is that if you plan just to grind somewhere (choose a place/building and stick to it, realm hop) for xp it's good. But normal questing will cancel out the bonus because of increased travel times from place to place (you have to run evertwhere). You could always log in adventure mode, fast travel and then log back in survival but for me atleast it was too much of an hassle. You dont get killed that often if you just keep your eyes open and avoid places that propablyhave players.
---
I do this as well, but the cost or use my own materials isn't the point. I'd be okay with even a "guest" storage to make adjustments much easier, accessing their storage would be optimal for reuse of previously created items.
---
Also, I would want the ability to move anything freely with the contractors permission perk(?) Right now you can't move something the owner has touched.
---
I get asked to make/improve camps by friends because they like how I do them. It's not going to be the simplest of structures, and if I make a mistake half way through, I either have to scrap and remake (which is annoying if you run out then have to do a search before completing someone else's house) or adjust in the most awkward way.
---
A simple starter base is absolutely not what I'm referring to.
---
Lol,  I know I'm not getting any money back. It's called a rhetorical question.
---
Gonna head out now, but if you join my server, the body is at The Colonel Kelly Monument on top of the hill lying on some seats. I'll accept all friend requests for this play session.
---
Lol sound like something i do.. if i come across new ppl I follow but don't help so they can kill and grab the loot and if they run into harder things and have trouble then I help and also i usually drop a baby care package after a bit.. never thought of it as coming off creepy before üòÖ
---
I never lock anything if peeps need water they can help themselfs. I always keep extra on hand.
---
Well you helped them from time to time, he just followed and watched
---
oh and yes if you were on a cliff and logged out they would fall through the floor. oooooor you could get those floor traps that catapult people when you trigger them.
---
You go and rage about the game being pos and the only bugs that seem to gring your nuts is in workshop? :D :D :D You need to return to your sims.
---
Thanks man
---
I thought that was removed?
---
A shame I can only upvote once. Great story. üò¢
---
I doubt anyone sane agrees that melee is balanced...
---
That doesn't mean that an explosive shotgun is balanced though.
---
I'd love to see some of these sexys make it in:

You want giant razor blade face blenders?  Because this is how you get giant razor blade face blenders!
---
Soon enough I‚Äôll be one of em!
---
I can't find the serum anywhere in the bunker though. Only recipe for the serum.
---
It would be nice if we had the option to switch fire modes or use different receivers for different fire modes.
---
~the strangler heart spits out toxic gas~
---
Same. The game has serious issues still, some forgivable and others, just moronic. But the people I've had the pleasure to meet has made the game for me. It's really a game geared towards teamwork. There are perk cards and mutations that facilitate successful gaming using teamwork.
---
If you're on Xbox and adult enough ~~that you don't get carded when buying booze~~, with a "one for all, all for one" gaming style, hit me up, we'll get you on your way!
---
The science vendors have serums under the aid tab, you might have to server hop for it.
---
Yes.  While a lot depends on your style of play, you can create some truly OP builds using the right sets.  Unyielding (+3 to all stats except End with low health) gives you +15 with all 5 pieces.  Combine that with bloodied weapons, certain mutations, etc. and it's pretty ridiculous.
---
Well deserved and nice follow up by Bethesda. I like seeing stuff like this they do for fans that put in time and effort. Not gonna lie totally jealous of your swag. üòâ
---
So, please explain to me why the server disconnects evertime I own a workshop for ten minutes?
---
Imma cry fam
---
It stacks? Wait so for melee builds with adrenal reaction and 15 extra strength that‚Äôs an extra 75% damage, plus adrenal and what bloodied prefix gives you. üòÆ
---
There are pictures of me in previous Reddit posts, all the proof you need. ;)
---
i've done the event probably 20 times and have yet to see a staff or club plan drop, it's really aggravating.
---
I will have NONE of this. These are MY customers god damn you!
---
Yup.  Add in certain aids, Party Girl + Whiskey (+6 str), and you can see how crazy your damage can get.
---
I was aware of this before I live in logging country and this was a practice too. But I'm sure Bethesda had a irony in mind with this. Lol
---
Pve endgame, pa is jus fine. Heavy guns pa build and I can solo the sbq.
---
Crickets
---
Wow......theres one at every party
---
Thank god, what perks are  good for Armour and best types just to know what to look for
---
Maybe he saw you were doing good as team and found someone else to help? Idk I really can't speak for anyone else but it's what I would do. I'm just glad he wasn't a pain for you like alot of other stories here and own experiences  :)
---
This happened to me at the Whitespring with a 3* ghoul. Body disappeared in front of the entrance, and his headless corpse was laying down in the laundry room.
---
My wife and I simultaneously did a really long and sincere awwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
---
Battle field awareness, it sucks and it has happen to me as well. You just have to pay attention to your surroundings better that's all.
---
Lock the terminal.
---
You can lock the terminal so it stays 50 cal and also prevents people from stealing it. I know it‚Äôs LT on Xbox. 
---
Also, the machine maxes out at a certain number of ammo rounds so make sure to collect it regularly. (Meaning after it produces ~200 rounds it will stop making more ammo)
---
Got a spicy 2 shot Plasma gun only for it to be a lvl 25. The creature that dropped it was level 46-58 iirc. Gonna clap some cheeks with it.
---
I cannot comment about PvP but in PvE is not better nor worse, is just different.
---
As opposed to PA regular armor can drop as legendary - please bear with me, I am not patronising you by stating the obvious - and there are some armor 'effects' that complements certain 'builds'.
---
At the moment VATS is not viable in PA because of the fusion core drain bug and the PA 'mods' that provide AP refresh are... well, meh.
---
Conversely AP hungry VATS builds can find help in ultra-light mods and AP refresh legendary effect on regular armour.
---
They can also come with weight reduction legendary effects that free perk card slots.
---
Weightless legendary + chameleon mutation or light armour + chameleon legendary suit stealth builds more than PA + Stealth Boy mod.
---
Unyielding complements bloodied/low health builds (although various bloodied PA 'builds' are 'a thing' too). 
---
Finally Sentinel/Cavalier (both flavours, sprinting or blocking) are very nice effects to have depending on build/playstyle.
---
Moreover people get tired of PA. I know I did. PA + All Rise will take care of the PvE content in a pinch - which is good I think? Keeps the game accessible to newcomers and returning players alike - but when it comes to more flexibility regular armor can offer that.
---
So in my opinion is just more versatile; eventually many people relegate PA to nuke zones - is considerably better at keeping rads at bay than regular armor, resource gathering trips using Excavator or heavy weapons builds (stabilised makes a substantial difference).
---
Catmeat reminds me of Dogmeat. Cat companions in Patch 9 CONFIRMED /s
---
Go to wade airport, and repair the vertibot landing pad at the south side of the airport.  Then there's a bot just sitting there waiting for you to picturize it.
---
Tasty tasty 118
---
I got out of my power armor when it was rubbing elbows with the base of the vault-boy statue.  then, i took a picture of the statue, my armor, and the clock tower in the background.  so go where you can do that, and take that pic.
---
XB1, sorry about that
---
King of the Hill I think would be most appropriate for a PvP game.
---
I only use Excavator at the lucky hole mine for lead mining. In nuke zones I use a hazmat suit but I've built my Character around Perception Agility and Luck and Vats so PA is almost a hindrance. Also VATS chews up fusion cores like crazy
---
I don't even have friends irl but at least game is fun solo
---
That's so cool for both of you!
---
Install turrets. Must have turrets.
---
*Nelson laugh*
---
I‚Äôm ALWAYS down for an SBQ run (if I‚Äôm available and not working), presently have 5 nuclear keycards.
---
Platform is XB1, GT is Stuart5cottsEye
---
Now THAT brings tears to my eyes...you're a good dude. ‚ù§
---
I've got one.  4 star with the sacrificial blade on it.
---
Good shout, cheers.
---
? i don't understand
---
Stabilized is by bar the best pa perk, it's under intelligence. Rank 3 ignores 45% armor when using heavy guns in pa. High strength is needed for ammo weight,  heavy guns weight, and heavy gun perks. T-60 I like untill you get mods for xo-1 or unltracite pa( my personal fav) it has like 620 DMG resist at 200% repaired and over 500 of energy and rad resist.
---
That's freakin' rad. I recently got a 1\* Vampire Plasma Gat. I've never used anything like it in game, and only have 1 mod for it since I always sold them before. Kicking myself now of course.
---
Hmmmmmm, that didn't work
---
Well that‚Äôs a comment.
---
The axe is made of a rare metal used pre-war and we repair it with inferior components...I don't know just a thought.
---
Before I zoomed in, I swear your character was a Preston Garvey clone.  üòÅ
---
LOL I feel your pain on the workshop ownage.

1. when you go to build in workshp all the items listed are green and are coming from the workshop stash. When they turn white it begins to come from your personal stash. I never invest past the workshops inventory unless I have an excess and need to burn up som extra to open up some storage space. I plan on losing the workshop as soon as i get it. if not from a player usually its because the server goes down or something like that. if the loss of the caps is the problem then work shop ownership may not be for you.
---
Lol damn man, that's exactly how myself and my fiance's setup is. We have a recliner right beside our bed as well so we can both lounge and game at the end of the day. Partnering done right, in my opinion
---
Dvery PA shows as empty frame in inventory you have to place it down to see which PA it is.
---
So a br? Bc if so that would be a terrible idea atleast to me they are so over used
---
You nailed it.  This is the reason I rarely farm mats . Other people do it for me.
---
No, a king of the Hill where you have to stay on top of a small hill and stay in the small hill for the longest time while everyone tries to capture the Hill for themselves. You die and spawn in right near the hill.
---
No this wouldn‚Äôt be awesome
---
For that vault-tec school, stand in front of statue, aim at stairs behind it and booom here you go. Anoying shit!
---
No
---
I combined it with the sneak perks and covert operative and it's a pretty effective solo build.   Sneak around and one-shot most things with a headshot.  Just be careful not to get mobbed and keep in mind the boss level critters won't go down that quickly because of the slow fire rate and their high HP.  You'll want a secondary weapon that helps take them down more quickly.
---
So a lot depends on your play style and if you find that enjoyable.
---
I exited Taggertys room and went into the power armor room.   There stood an empty frame with no pieces.  Got in it and nothing.  Empty frame.  Am I taking crazy pills?
---
Logging off now. Thanks for the memories! haha
---
Well, what pissed me off was I had 3 acid miners and one gold going, so i was waiting to max out my haul, so 9 acid, 3ish gold ore, then disconnect.  I'm sorry, but do you go into chipotle, watch them make your burrito, pay for it, then they throw into the trash.

If y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt already you can get matching wedding rings in game. I can‚Äôt see either of yalls left ring fingers so I dunno if you already got em. It‚Äôs a nice touch though.
---
My camp is on the cliff, and I logged out while my brother recorded me ‚Äúkilling‚Äù another player.
---
the people here at reddit will totally get you your money back
---
My wife wouldn't let me kill him üòÇü§£
---
That‚Äôs a no for me.
---
Ok my inventory showed 2 power armor frames after I added the one in the room.   I set both frames in PA stations and 1 had ultracite armor pieces on it.    One leg is shot to shit.  Kinda janky.  Seems an odd way to reward that mission.
---
You don't have to be careful picking it up. What are they going to do? Ban you for picking up an item someone dropped?
---
The terms of how they banned were so arbitrary too. One of my friends was perma banned because he duped ammo and junk amountages over a million, while he did about 10% of the amout of duping that I did, but I just spread mine out over much more types of items. Someone could have 1 million of a single thing, while someone else had 999,999 of 1000 more item IDs  and be only suspended, just plain silly.
---
Did you get your rabbit head? Ya smuck,
---
Careful, Bethesda will track you down and spank you for even gazing upon this item.
---
Honestly I play with my boyfriend and sometimes I wanna choke him if it gets too competitive lol
---
&gt; How easy is it to get other people to fight the SBQ with you?  
---
It depends on the server and how many 100+ people are on it. I had failed SBQ runs because only 2 other people showed up.
---
&gt; What‚Äôs the minimum level necessary to stand a chance during the fight? 
---
When you maxed out the perks for your build. Typically 65-75 is a good initial range.
---
&gt; How useful are melee weapons during the fight? 
---
If you can go bloodied then extremely well. The SBQ tends to glitch out so you can mostly safely whack her.
---
&gt; If I were to use guns, what kind of guns do you find most useful?
---
Zealot's, Hunter's, Two shot, Anti-armor; the higher the base damage the better. Bloodied and Furious can work well too. Handmades, Gatling Guns, 50 Cals.
---
&gt;How much ammo should I plan to bring? 
---
When there are plenty of people, it usually costs me 1500 rounds of 5.56. Another time, with a different 2 people and glitched queen, I spent 7000 rounds in 1.5 hours. I'd say 2000-3000 depending on the gun.
---
&gt; Is it even worth it to nuke FSP at all? Are the rewards from the whole ordeal worth it in your opinion?
---
She is a guaranteed source of unknown prime receiver plans (there is only 5% chance for the regular SBs to drop them). The problem is, can you get 6+ people to kill her for it in time? After that, she is probably not worth it anymore.
---
&gt; is it at all possible to fight it solo? 
---
I highly doubt that. She has a damage mitigation of reducing incoming damage to 30% (you shoot 100, she gets 30). Unless you are an extreme bloodied build with 5k damage and in practically invulnerable armor, it is basically impossible to kill in time in my experience.
---
This is really good for the fo76 community cool work
---
These is probably the best meme I've seen on here
---
Hope so too but yes you can collect bobbleheads in 76, I have one of each ready and waiting for them to release the display case for them üëç
---
So long as they are only allowed in survival mode
---
I found BOS plans yesterday. Legs or arms. I don‚Äôt quite remember.
---
Long story short, people accessed the dev room. They scrapped the item, now they can craft them. We're not meant to have it, that's why it has DR.
---
Who're you to judge?
---
I think you're right. I was thinking about writing some sort of article about the disconnect between what people want out of loot before a game drops then after it is released.
---
I think most people have a somewhat selfish view of drops and before the launch kind of like the idea of finding something no one else has. So they want the drop rates to be quite low. And this is an issue for devs as when they ask people people will probably say this: "don't give us too much loot, make us earn it"; but then when they play for a bit the mindset shits as other people have guns they seemingly can't get and then they want to open the floodgates and get lots more loot... And if that ever happens they then realise there's nothing to stand out any more and lose interest. In other words it's an unfulfillable set of desires that ends up messing up most games.
---
Your upvote/downvote is now perfectly balanced as it‚Äôs at zero üòè
---
No he means the little white balls that exterminate moths
---
It can have 18 DR jf crafted at 200% repair.
---
Is it still a nuke zone down there with the hella rads?
---
If I remember correctly I think I received the ultracite power armor plans at the end of the event. You may have to set the frame at a power armor station and go into the menu in order to build the armor.
---
If i remember correctly i don't think so but I'll launch a nuke there and be back with results.
---
And to think I was wasting time server hopping trying to get the plans for the costumes. Guess I won‚Äôt be doing that much longer üòí
---
One of the sources of the stutter is due to audio loading. The game doesn't seem to cache audio and loads it from disk all the time; which causes a 2-5 second hang. In addition, the game uses 14-15GB of RAM by itself and has a working set of 22GB, so Windows swaps quite a lot on my 16GB rig. On my 32GB rig, the stutter is less noticeable but is still there.
---
You get a new power armor chassis in your inventory if you do it at level 50+
---
It is stacked with Ultracite pieces
---
Whoever you got this information from must have very little knowledge of legendary farming locations in fallout 76. I thought everybody knew the best legendary farming spot... Whatever, I'll tell you: this is better than any event  - the Whitesprings golf club. Everybody goes to this place to farm legendaries because the place is crawling with them and about 40-50% of the ghouls are legendary, which is very significant. There is also a pretty good chance that 2 star and 3 star legendaries can spawn (at least one if you're unlucky) - there can even be situations where you get two 3 star legendaries to be beside each other (I've had this quite many times given the sheer amount of time I've farmed the whitesprings). The drops may not be the best, but sometimes you can get very good ones (the best drops I've got at this place were: suppressors's explosive harpoon gun, 2 star, anti armor combat rifle, 1 star, two shot combat rifle, 1 star) - you just have to hope for luck, that's all - I feel like if you really hope for luck, you actually get better drops - I don't know about you guys, but that's the case with me. 
---
When the Whitesprings Golf club is combined with a nuke zone, the place is crawling with bloated glowing ones (level 59) - about 60-70% of them will be legendary - it is a little crazy to be honest. They seem to give better drops than the normal ghouls - my friend once got a two shot explosive pump shotgun from one of those guys (max level) and I once got a vampire's swing speed power fist, level 50. 
---
That's about it guys. I hope you guys learned something from this and good luck getting good legendary drops out there!

Why did you waist ur time commenting on a 113 day old post lol, literally no one will see it

Also let us tame robots

Hahaha believe you me if I run into Vamp .50 cal likes yours at a Vendor, I am holding onto it. If I saw your "lost" thread on Reddit I'd kindly return it for a modest fee of course (eyeing any Lego Tesla's up in your inventory) hahaha.
---
Thnx
---
I don't care about your comments, I want BETHESDA to do their job.  Make a playable game.
---
I have an 3 star Gatling plasma that is badass.  Does explosive damage.  Now plasmas can‚Äôt be explosive.  I love that gun.  People always want to buy it.  I bought it off a player a long time ago.
---
He was probably just messing with you. It's just something fun to do. Sometimes when I see a new player I also put on some costume like creepy clown, cultist or easter bunny and follow them around or try to give them some goodies. I don't think he was out for your loot. There is absolutely nothing a level 5 player has that is even remotely useful to a level 100+ player.
---
Nice
---
I am so sorry but we already found another way to friend each other
---
No worries, it's good news then!
---
The house by the Nuka Cola Plant has a dead radroach in the bathroom that has a wedding ring on it, possibly two I can't remember. I recommend going there and proposing to her in game lol.
---
Happens, sometimes doors and walls don't load. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/yJHr0xE) I roleplay as an alt Watoga trader ;)
---
It's a public service, really. Hoarding is a legitimate problem that we should address as a community. If you wanna keep it, stash it. If you are too heavy to stash it, mule it. If you can't mule it, sell it. If you can't sell it, convert it into XP and mods. If you can't convert it, you probably don't need any more of it.
---
If you skip step 1 (stashing it), I feel like you didn't want to keep it anyway. If you fell into a fissure, no one would have it, and that's just a waste.
---
I like heavy gun. What will you do for me?
---
If you repair it though more armor for you :)
---
I have a vampire 50 cal with explosive and perception I believe, best heavy gun in the game. You can tank anything in front of you and enjoy never having to use stimpacks ever. It‚Äôs an absolute beast, get your perk cards set and you will never look back
---
Heavy weapons recently got balance changes, they got damage buffs but fire rate nerfs to make the dps sustainable.
---
Anyone? I would be super interessted aswell
---
I would absolutely love a room to safely decorate as a permanent home, then the CAMP could actually be the portal camping devise it's probably meant to be.

What about my three star with food drink chem weight -20%. More or less than junk??
---
not a big deal, I've been there on a secondary character at like 15, as long as you are still useful, like baiting and killing all the mobs, you'll probably die a few times but that just means you're not leeching off

There is already a shelf case (the white/glass one) in the game that would be perfect for bobble heads. Same for the magazine rack, I just want to display my magazines in there Bethesda!

Do you want to know how I got these scars?

lvl 80, same problem

This shot is so good I literally want it in-game to hang in my camp

I just want to find one that isn't white. :(

You got I! May 7th!

Well that's a nice weapon!!
---
You can build up there:
---
At your existing camp, make a blueprint of a staircase with an iron bar on top.
---
Move camp and place the blueprinted staircase anywhere you want, like, literally mid air.
---
You'll still need at least one foundation somewhere near the ground to be able to attach floors to the stairs though. Oh, and the floors are permanent, no deleting.
---
Walls and everything else is working fine like this.
---
Oh, so if i scrap it i learn the plan for it?
---
Next to the road/river between slocums and the overseer camp is a sweet spot -  with green thumb ~16 ready to harvest
---
Omg thank you so much ‚ù§
---
I hope they don't make her a "unique vendor" that only one player a time can interract with.
---
Great bit of background info, thanks OP! I heard about this, but didn't know the details before. 
---
A fun side-note: I did visit an old mining town in England (Cornwall) during a vacation trip, that place actually had a big cider farm as part of its community and the Mining Company partly paid their employees in hard cider (a big mug before and after work), which helped making the work in the mines easier to cope with. 
---
Ahhh! Mining Companies, fine people all of them!
---
You welcome. I also love that tune.:-)
---
Since the real world place is called *The Greenbriar* I am sure they did decide to go with the location name of *White Springs* instead mainly because it would feel like a mix of *Whiterun* and *Goodsprings*.
---
I can see the hentai coming
---
Slap damage was removed, but CAMP damage has not been completely removed yet.  
---
It's the sad truth that some aggressive players still play in Adventure and avoid Survival because they are pathetic little keyboard warriors that can't cope with someone fighting back.  
---
I think the next update will further reduce or remove CAMP damage from other players, but mobs can still attack and damage it, but at least mobs don't have the personality of an infant as do some players.
---
Thanks, checked andover 160gig free on the external harddrive which is where the download is going. Checked this morning and now the total download is only 10gig with 3 completed??? Weird
---
I got the quest reward after getting into the dead chicks computer.  I went into the PA room and there was an empty frame.  I‚Äôve scavenged a lot of frames.....it was empty.  I collect it, look in my inventory, and there are 2 frames.  I then placed each frame into a PA station...one is empty, one is a full set of uktracite armor.  Just my experience.
---
That would really make sense because she valued human miners over machines. So I guess she hid in a mine with her employees when the war started and they all turned into mole miners.
---
It only seems like that all mole miners except the Purveyor hate humans for what happened to them (just like the marked men of FO:NV).
---
Thank you.Bcs im confused.Inside the vault patch preview only talk about vendor &amp; exchange machines.survival scoreboard,wpn adjustements,etc.. But nothing for backpacks
---
Sage advice. My experience is that if anyone contests your workshop, they're a pvp build and looking to get your caps. Never defend a workshop. You're basically walking into a trap when you travel there.
---
You currently can't find her. She still needs to be released in one of the planned updates
---
I was thinking that I got a decent handmade but this could be a good one shot weapon or at least a good first shot weapon. Thanks for the input.

Raider: Bad kitty!

*gunshot*
---
Raider: Hmm, this is delicious. I need to cook this more often.
---
No. And despite the basic lore having diverged from the other games somewhat, where exactly do you see this fitting in with the Fallout universe given that it is essentially like the 50s never really ended?
---
Nice one mate. I found this genuinely interesting, I had no idea. 
---
Apologies in advance that I shall be passing this off as my own knowledge to anyone who will listen over the next few weeks!!!
---
It is US legislation and only applies to games developed, or significantly updated, after January 1st of this year.
---
Honestly, the thing you missed out on the most was a market flooded with cheap god roll dupes.
---
Sorry for the long process seems like you got your answer before i had time to launch the nuke
---
ballistic fiber from the chassis ??
---
Yes, everything seems to hate my little farm for making drinks, juice and soups. üòû Clearly Super Mutants are some kind of Temperance movement too.
---
I'm envious of all these couples that play 76. My gf gets annoyed even trying to use the controller, never mind actually getting good and paying attention. 
---
She still watches me play tho, which is nice. Because we only have one television.
---
Go get fucked by a sheepsquatch, dickhead.
---
My favorite "raiding party" I had been in was me (6'5" Jesus doppelganger), my best friend IRL (tattooed youth pastor) and his dad, a prepubescent kid with manners, as well as an old ass Conservative dude whose wife was getting mad she couldn't play Overcooked and a husband-and-wife duo that followed us around for a while. It was the one moment I realized the *potential* for the game to live up to what [Bethesda literally advertised](https://youtu.be/5IcqE8kT3KA).
---
They nerfed caps in survival mode. unfortunately the best route to farming caps off ther players is now in adventure mode.  Anyone who says they make decent caps in survival mode is delusional. People have been complaining but nothing has gone viral about it so i doubt anything will be done.   
---
Bethesda please consider making survival mode profitable again. Personally I'm sick of greifing and stealing workshops to instigate pvp in adventure for reasonable profit vs wasting bullets to earn petty caps in no consequence survival.
---
No mods = no censure = bless captitalism and america
---
This is the future. It kind of sounds like when Xavier puts on that helmet and in his world he can walk. 
---
I can only imagine what this might mean for you and your wife. It maybe is a small thing but I am truly happy this is possible for you.
---
I like using reduced fire rate and increased base damage to boost the combat rifle. Not sure how it would stack up against the Handmade with that change - you do come across like someone that did his math though - but given that .45 is considerably more abundant than .556 'in the wild' even if it loses by a small margin being cheaper to run - with the reduced RoF and the availability of 'free' rounds would make it more 'competetitive'.
---
The Missile Launcher needs something. I don't know what. Whatever. Just something that makes it more than 20lbs+ of useless steel. Is heavy, the ammo is ridiculously heavy, expensive to craft and scarce 'in the wild', the durability is piss poor, the dps is meh even agains clusters of enemies - and is not like you have mechanics in place that allow you to group them - and it was like this even pre DM nerf. Such an iconic weapon and is just an expensive to run, hard to carry and feed, piece of blergh.
---
Full disclosure, I loathe the assault rifle - so much so that in FO4 I replaced every instance of the weapon in every levelled list wth the Service Rifle - so I am going to abstain to comment on that one.
---
I am ill equipped to comment on the rest. I have never used a fat man, the shiskebab has always been little more than a prop for me - melee in FO4 is... let's say there is room for improvement - and energy weapons/SMGs have never been 'my thing'.
---
A slight clarification I think is worth mentioning.
---
It‚Äôs not that only scrip is usable it‚Äôs that only scrip is available.
---
Gresham‚Äôs law ‚Äúbad money drives out good‚Äù describes the phenomena well.
---
Scrip is bad money that no one really wants (as compared to say USD which is good money) so people hoard the good money and spend the bad.
---
Eventually no matter how much good money you have if there is enough scrip it vanishes from the economy.
---
And don't forget plasma dmg like f4. I loved the Handmade with plasma dmg
---
Did you found bolstering + ap regen heavy leather pieces on your long wayüòÇ?
---
honestly i can‚Äôt even figure out how to tame animals. 
---
i have wasteland whisperer rank 3, and animal friend rank 3, both equipped. i go up to something half my level or less and point my gun at it but i don‚Äôt get the option to pacify it. 
---
does the gun have to be aimed at it? and if so, does it only work with non-scoped weapons?
---
(sorry to kinda hijack your thread)
---
We should be able to go AFK at Aleo and Vera‚Äôs spa. Make us unkillable until we move our characters.
---
I'm a person of peace, I even run a little Mothman Church, But I would still shove a mini nuke so far into someone if they wore that.
---
What kind of armor?
---
We just upgraded to a second xbox a few months ago - something that totally sweetened the deal was that you can share account privileges (e.g. if the "home console" has gold membership/gamepass/owns any games, the second console gets them too!). The only thing that you can't do that with is things like DLCs / upgrades, they seem to be account based.
---
Opened up so many co-op possibilities :)
---
Despite the fact it has a power connector on it's model I don't think any of the shots of it show it actually wired up?
---
I also want new stuff like improvised weapons made by miners, melee weapons like megasloth gauntlets, deathclaw staff, grafton monster spine etc.
---
I'd like to see another lmg. M60 would be nice.
---
I'd be happy with this since it maintains wanting to be connected to the centralized location at white springs, and it may encourage myself to move my camp more often.
---
I will endure a lifetime of bugs, poor balancing, and storytelling issues but the first time I see an anime in Fallout is the day it all ends for me.
---
Why don't you go on the market subs?
---
No, commando is automatic rifles.
---
Damn, they don't double-dip? I thought I was onto something here lol - thanks for the pointers
---
Imagine thinking the final "raid boss" shouldnt drop things that make the waste of ammo worth it. With that mindset we shouldnt even have it.
---
degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
Pure intelligence boost or? It will never go above 100% for me at a bench.
---
Why? How often do you plan on buying legendary stuff? Sure, first three or fours days it will be a bother, but after that the problem will be non-existing.
---
It‚Äôs so good. Is this part of your day job?
---
Berkeley Springs Train Station. She is not there yet, but will be in the update a few weeks from now.

Rename the chassis.

Every legendary I kill in the Club House drops through, stopped going.

Literally EPIC

You doing the "I can't help but extrapolate something negative about something that wasn't negative to begin with" thing? I recommend not doing that.
---
Explosive is only on ranged.
---
They tested this long time ago, the tank killer don't affect the laser gun.
---
When did they change this or are you just speaking out lies.
---
*shhhhh*
---
Let me dream
---
I want and update that makes the white springs a true player hub with wast land stuff in and around and make it no longer a nuke site.
---
We are suppose to rebuild and It would be awesome to make white spring a true player hub.

Woah, didn't know about share account privileges

Biggest thing you‚Äôre missing in your post? PLATFORM

My bad lol, was talking and texting at the same time so I wasn't paying attention. Also yea platform would also be nice in this situation cause I'm ps4 :// thank you for the offer though!
---
No worries! Good luck!

The picture of Jeff and Amy is in the trailer in the water station plant in the forest
---
unsure of the gathering rates but im assuming 24 minutes if theyre like my fusion core generator. so i clear the shop (which has a caps payout by the way almost enough to pay for the capture fee) drop a premade turret brick which is a one foundation with 4 class 2 turrets (saved in blue prints mine is even decorated with american flags) then i drop a generator brick which is a 2 floor building with a nuclear generato 4 turrets 2 rockets and small genes for the rockets. hook the gene brick to the fusion core generator start timer. I have never actually time the total time it takes but i imagine i have to be under a minute for monogah power plant now. i have power and defenses up and have to wait a minute or two for the first attack to hit. Anyway after the first attack i have a bout 20 minutes to go do other stuff then come back and collect my cores. I make a lot of money ingame and selling on the reddit trade area so as a rule i dont worry if i have to recap a place. the only time i get frustrated is when i lose them right at full capacity when im about to go gather up the fusion cores. sometimes i run all three power plants at once. if i start at posiden then monngah then ...the one in the swamp. i can generally have all three defended and making fusion cores in under 24 minutes with plenty of time to go to posiden and start cycling my way through the plants. IF i can get one full collection run i am ok with losing the shop but it does get annoying when you get nothing at all out of the investment.
---
I would love to see more than just explosive. Cryo bullets sound amazing.
---
Nice things make us do nice things, love it. So much!

Has nothing to do with being a dickhead, love how 8 people assumed I was being negative and mean. Time to grow up kids.

If it wasn‚Äôt ghoul slayers you‚Äôd be looking at a pretty penny!  You could probably get a good 7-10k for it, possibly more cause of the powered part.  Don‚Äôt get swindled whatever you do!

If by bolstering + ap regen leather you mean troubleshooter's or ghoul slayer leather, all 1*, then yes. Yes I did üòÇ

Sometimes players just want to have their name listed on the screen and choose the nuke location. I actually offer a service for a certain number of caps. I provide key card, code, and will defeat all enemies for you, except legendaries, which I will reduce to minimal health for you to kill for the XP and loot. 
---
I also handle all phases of the process, including having pre-crafted mainframe cores for phase 2. Usually I‚Äôm able to go from elevator to launch on under 13 minutes (my record is 9:45) for a two player team. 
---
I also do a full tutorial/detailed walk thru on mic for those that want to learn and have lots of hand holding. 
---
That‚Äôs quite a bit pricier but you get 2 free key cards, 1 5 free mainframe cores, and a guarantee you will understand every nuance, spawn point, and nuke zone tips/tricks that exist out there on XB1 by the time we are done. 
---
When you‚Äôre level 275, finding ways to make the game continuously fun and interesting come in so many weird and wonderful ways.
---
Even though the prefix is not great is still a sweet piece of armor, as VS\_Arachnos points out more so depending on type/weight.
---
Hahah, I‚Äôll be honest, it‚Äôs a good one and although I laughed at this joke I still have respect and feel empathetic for this dude‚Äôs wife and I‚Äôm happy that this game can strengthen their relationship.
---
there‚Äôs a dead cat in a house you find close to vault 76. it‚Äôs on the southeast side, south of moonshiners shack. 
---
the house is a two story and the cat is on the top floor next to (what i‚Äôve always seen) a dead scorched
---
hope that helps! if anything, i can try to find the exact location for you and post a pic of my map ^^
---
chipotle rocket take off in 3 ....2.... 1.....\\o/
---
Tbh I thought they just misspelled "scrap".
---
Or OP is just lightyears ahead of you talent-wise
---
I never claimed I had talent, again idiotic assumptions. 
---
OP even stated it took a lot of time.
---
You lucky man! I've been hoping for a legendary 50 Cal for so long. Have fun with it!
---
HELL Yeah! 
---
Having niche effects for each playstyle would be so much fun..
---
At the moment my weapon wish-list looks like this 
---
https://i.imgur.com/y95AVj1.jpg
---
It's not very exciting. Adding some of the effects you mentioned would make it a lot more fun.
---
Yeah, something's amiss here. Are you running it in full screen mode? Are you positive the game is utilizing the card and not onboard graphics? Are you using a 4k monitor?
---
Same here üíú my bf is OP
---
Im running in fullscreen 1920 by 1080 and yes i made sure in the invidia control panel that its using the rtx card
---
I've contested workshops to take them before. Surprisingly no one has ever showed up to defend them.
---
Take lots of workshops. I leveled the fastest by taking the Poseidon energy plant,Charleston landfill and wade air port. They are close to each other and a train station and at low-level areas.  Since your so low level there is virtually no downside to pvp. All the defense missions will give you lots of enemies and after each defense mission it grants you like 500 exp and with three or four workshops you will almost always have a defense mission waiting for you. The resources are just a bonus if you decide to build.
---
LOL they are a frustrating but vital part of the fallout universe. 
---
TIPS AND TRICKS FOR DEALING WITH MOLERATS 
---
1. when they hide walk up to their hiding spot then turn around they will attack! but you are already spinning back around saying "AHAA!" 
---
2. fast travel away from the shop then back to it they will reload onto the surface usually. 
---
3. sometimes your just screwed on that shop and logging may be the best answer :) 
---
Thems my tips for teh molerats youre welcome.
---
Your Lucky , my gf hates videogames. :(
---
Yes, you have to aim at them with a regular scope. 
---
You can also only tame animals that spawn solo at a random encounter spot. You do not need to have both cards equipped. AF works for most animals. Snallygasters are the only creature I know of that are restricted to WW.
---
I dont know about XBOX, but on ps4 even the dlc stuff is working. My wife can share All store bought games and dlc or season Pass stuff, you only have to restore licences in your acc. But how i said, dunno how XBOX handles it.
---
Just get her some power armor, then she can fast travel anywhere
---
I feel you on that one, man.
---
We have 3 PS4s, but only ever use two at a time. 2 upstairs so we can play Overwatch side-by-side, and one PS4 pro downstairs with the big TV so we can play games like RDR2 or Horizon Zero Dawn. 
---
It's honestly pretty fucking awesome :P  .
---
Kinda irrelevant, but is 3 star the highest? There is space for 5 but ive never seen anything above a 3.
---
Dude, that's dope. I hope my GF and I still play games together once we have kids.
---
I am 105 as of tonight and barely play. Maybe once a week of that. To farm data I go to sugar Grove and hand in Everytime I find one and bounce back and forth trying to maximize my loot. So far I got:
---
Assault marine combat helmet
---
Marine wet suit
---
Science scribe outfit 2x
---
T-60 BoS paint
---
Bomber Jacket
---
No hacks no mods no Dev room. Pretty sure I can stop wasting my time with the tech data, nothing really left I want.
---
Delete the ini modifications you made while installing the mod. Or just delete those 3 ini files; the game will generate new ones.
---
Closest think I have to that (other than TSEs) is a 3* Vampire Explosive Submachine Gun.
---
Nice find.
---
This is great but I was kinda hoping they would get into production, so I could get a copy!!! üòÇ
---
Super awesome job üëçüíú
---
This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I also went on your Twitter and in general you seem like such a sound guy, to work for or be married to or just to know. Honestly man more people like you need to exist, Thankyou.
---
This is the most awesome thing I have seen today. I wish for a healthy recovery with the spinal injury. Enjoy the great fallout partner.
---
But i can't remember what they're called or where they are, as i said i deleted my entire data folder without luck
---
I agree that theres very poor options to choose from when trying out different weapons.
---
I've a level 35 TSE Gatling plasma. The thing shreds anything. Don't worry
---
Congrats. Explosive guns are fun. Just got one myself, a shotgun, and it's my best weapon.
---
It dropped a 3*  lvl 40 Flamer for my lvl 20 alt yesterday. Dubbelshot + 25% VATS reduction + something. Nice but useless i guess for my build. I'll stick to it anyway and see what it's like, never even tried that gun. Should work for bbcing ghoul hordes at WS.
---
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
Delete Fallout76.ini Fallout76Prefs.ini and Fallout76Custom.ini 
---
You may or may not have the last one. it doesn't matter, just delete the ones you have. Your settings will reset when you do this but that's an easy fix.
---
I poured out some OE after reading this. RIP
---
The poster had some differences, notably a 3 yellow ‚Äúeyes‚Äù but id say repurposing a captured one is still accurate.
---
Thank you i'll try this
---
99% of the time they're cap farmers contesting. People that want workshops just hop servers and grab an empty one.
---
Awesome, what is the Nuka cola item?
---
The griefers who couldn‚Äôt hack in survival comeback to adventure mode.
---
They realized they weren‚Äôt as badass as they thought
---
Block a griefers GT and then server hop
---
I agree, theres 3-6 actually useful legendary effects (for guns) and thats not enough.
---
All of your suggestions sound very cool and they would bring a lot of diversity to the trading market.
---
Looked at your posts/comments... You really need to talk to someone. And i say that in the most sincere and friendly way possible.
---
All of these sound really gret, didnt really see any unreasonable things, seems like you have thought about this for a while!
---
Install gforce experience software &amp; optimize the game. Don't fiddle too much with the setting on initial run.
---
sleep then play music instrument and make sure you build everything you can and have junk for. scrap all of that build some more. also you get xp for building work shop items. also you can swap to survival mode and get a 20% bonus even for that. its similar to the metal shelf trick in fallout 4 only in 76 i fdont know what yeilds the most xp for least resource. leveling days are long behind me now.
---
This. I rock a Minigun as my go to because at least I can control ammo output with the tribarrel. The .50 MG sprays ammo out at a 35 degree angle straight from the barrel (I watched someone use one and was astounded at how wide the spread is ten feet out).
---
Still an awesome find, mind you, it'll be great for SB's that are close enough. Just terrifying ammo needs.
---
I love that coat, how do you get it?
---
I think you‚Äôve got a couple of years at least to recoup your $100.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta, 566 hours so far and feel like I‚Äôve had more than my money‚Äôs worth.
---
I‚Äôve done that. It‚Äôs like denial, did I really just win this?
---
Lolz
---
Same, like Ive spent at least 80+ hours just making new camps or helping my friends make their camp. No joke I love making bases.
---
I'm not sure anyone could expect any game to be supported indefinitely.  There's a shelf life on everything. 
---
I purchased the game in November and have enjoyed it since then.  For me, the $60 US has been well worth the 350 hours I've gotten out of it.
---
The fissure holes were put there for that exact reason... How about not falling into one? And why would you carry multiple stable flux on you anyway?
---
Did... you do all of her missions?
---
There were two Inside the Vault updates for Patch 9. First one showcasing the Pioneer Scouts and Backpacks and the most recent one you're talking about. You must have missed the first one.
---
My gt is same as name
---
Sorry I can't offer anything useful then. There was a known issue with Win 10 causing severe lag in some games, but I think they hotfixed it over a month ago.
---
This is what I was hoping the legendary vendor would be.
---
The ability to add  these new effects to already legendary weapons would be awesome.
---
Sure, but there's not really any reason why it couldn't be supported by the community after the official servers are shut down. It would take some work on Bethesda's part but if they're literally advertising the game as "pay once, play forever" then the least they could do is provide the community with some tools to ensure the game is playable after they drop support. Otherwise I'd say that could be false advertising. 
---
You might have gotten your money's worth, but this is a digital product. There's no actual shelf life on it, besides the one imposed by the developer. Why shouldn't I be able to play a game I paid for five years from now. It's a win/win for everyone.
---
Thanks to everyone for testing that for me. I'll be more careful with emotes in future.
---
Ultima online is still running. its one of the first successfull MMOs on the market. its been through multiple sells and resells and still has a die hard player base, same with eve online, runescape, etc MMOs have a much longer lifespan than regular games and even if bethesda tires of it SOMEONE will buy it out. that being said nothing in life lasts forever. I pay 30 bucks to go to a movie for 3 hours entertainment with the wife. that includes drinks and popcorn. that is my baseline of comparison for all entertainment. if I can get an hour of pleasure for 10 bucks I don't feel ripped off. At 800 plus hours at level 200 I feel I have already gotten my money's worth from fallout 76 In fact I feel a little guilty that I haven't spent any money on their cash shop just yet and the deal has been extremely one sided in my favor. money is tight for me right now so I will hold off on making any atom purchases for a bit but I do intend on spending some money in the item shop solely to support their business and chosen business model. but yeah how much you value your entertainment dollars may be different from mine so it really comes down to wether or not you think you will get 100 aud of entertainment from the purchase.
---
Agreed, I frequently see 10+ people in joint 5th etc.
---
And theres gaps in the floorboards so you can see her tunnel.
---
I suggest taking long naps to get well rested an exp bonus. Try to look up where the sheep squatch event and imposter sheep squatch event since these are usually non nuked and are low level areas. Travel to the areas where these events happen so that you can fast travel to them early when events start you must come early because coming late may make things harder for the other players. Since these events usually attact higher level players the enemies at these places will be of high levels. Try to help out as much as you can but just stay alive and put a bullet in the main objective. You don't need to kill anything just put a few bullets into everything and let the other players kill them off you'll receive exp for everything that dies even if you didn't kill it. And since they are high level you'll get tons of exp.
---
I had that. I had to look up the walkthroughs on you tube. I was supposed to make syringer ammo and kill  bear. I never got a marker though and only in looking at the walkthrough did I figure out what to do. once i killed the bear things started working and displaying correctly. dunno where in the story your stuck at but a similar thing shoud work for you.
---
They haven't banned anyone for using it, neither did they remove it from inventories like they did with some other things. If anything i say that we are meant to have them
---
But recouping it isn't really the point. If I buy a DVD of James Cameron's Avatar for whatever reason, I can watch it now or ten years from now because it's something I paid for and own. If I buy a game that will in a few years no longer be playable, that would be like buying a DVD of James Cameron's Avatar then in a few years James Cameron comes to my house and snaps the disc in half.
---
Had the same error myself last night. Browsed here briefly to see if others were experiencing my issues, but there weren't any topics at the time. I did eventually manage to get a stable connection and play for a few hours, but between 10-12pm GMT it was pretty much unplayable with the constant disconnects.
---
Ok I don‚Äôt think you should buy the game, not sure you‚Äôll ever be happy with it.
---
Am tired of trying to take photos at locations with players in certain outfits. It's really hard in my TZ to find people and it just honestly makes me a bit depressed to see challenges I cannot complete by myself.
---
Sometimes I have login just before work and hope I can catch someone in a different TZ that's kind enough to hang around at the location doing nothing more than helping people like me out.
---
I don't mind doing camera challenges as I've gotten some great photos and explored nicely...but please...stop requiring OTHER people in outfits.
---
There are enough people who get money from a bank for a house. And many buying things there have the money for but couldn't really afford it.
---
it appeared in your backpack. it just says its a power fram, once you place it you will see the ultracite armor.
---
You're confusing services with goods I think. Seeing a movie at a cinema is a service, you're not being given a physical or digital copy of the movie. It's like a car wash, they're not giving you a carwash wrapped up in a gift bag, its a service. Fallout 76 is a good, a digital good but still a good. MMOs are services but that's because you're paying a subsciption fee for continued access to the service. Fallout 76 is pay once and play, so it conforms more closely to a good than a service.
---
"Mothman liked that"
---
My other half didnt think fo76 was worth playing. Now he backseat plays with me, looking stuff up online whilst I'm playing and getting into it. Trying to persuade him to make his own account so we can play together. This thread rocks!
---
No, i'm stuck to "key fragments" part. I shouyld pick up three key fragments. The exact misison is called "the missing link: complete rose's missions to gain her trust"
---
The game looks like fun and generally I enjoy Bethesda games. It also seems like a lot of the technical issues that stopped me from buying it in the first place have been solved. I just don't believe in buying a product that is designed to break after a given length of time. 
---
I'd be perfectly happy with Fallout 76 if Bethesda had any sort of end of life plan in place. At the moment "play forever" seems more like false advertising than anything else.
---
He migrated to WV too: [https://imgur.com/URqtpRR](https://imgur.com/URqtpRR)
---
Quitting the game because of player vending?  That seems harsh.
---
Yeah so like I said, don‚Äôt buy it. If that‚Äôs your influencing factor then you‚Äôll never be happy, because Beth will never give you what you want.
---
I actually feel like you where worthy of more swag
---
To be able to re-roll a single star of a weapon/armor would be nice. You would still need to find a 3 star with 2 out of 3 good modifiers. I doubt we will get to do that of course.
---
Well then I'd say that advertising the game as being playable forever is false advertising. Given the track record for many games that rely on a central server.
---
No, of course! The problem is, there are no tags on the maps, so i don't know where to go and complete them.
---
Yes. It says it in the Prefix description. +30% damage against Mirelurks and bugs.
---
Love this, my girlfriend has now outleveled me, and when we‚Äôre in party chat with friends we often spend most of our time taking the piss out of one another, much to the amusement of our friends.
---
Ok dude now you‚Äôre just trolling. I don‚Äôt give a shit about your opinion on ‚Äòfalse advertising‚Äô. Feel that strongly about that then sue Beth. 
---
Have a good day.
---
How am I trolling? If you don't care then don't respond, it's as simple as that.
---
I‚Äôve already told you twice not the buy the game and now you‚Äôre whining about ‚Äòfalse advertising‚Äô.
---
It did do something for you! 1 hour of the negative effects of marsupial being suppressed.......
---
Yes it's such a horrible thing to have a problem with anti-consumer practices. Like I said, you didn't have to respond.
---
Exactly
---
explosive doesn't need any damage bonus. AOE shots are great without it
---
It was in the atom shop until last month where they got rid of a few things. I managed to grab one because another settlement needed my help, and preston marked it on my map.
---
do you play on xbox OP?
---
Caveat emptor. I‚Äôm sure you can find a game to play where you‚Äôve not been promised something falsely. Why don‚Äôt you go that instead of whining on here? As the latter seems counter productive, when you could be enjoying yourself.
---
I‚Äôve killed players like this intentionally. Lured them onto my long scenic overlook, dropped them a nuka cola or something insignificant, then log out while they‚Äôre in their pipboy.
---
And yet heavy combat limbs bs heavy leather is in the odd situation of being an insignificant 7pt ahead in physical damage yet 30pt behind in energy damage. 
---
120 odd days since this post and I‚Äôm currently wondering why leather is better than heavy combat!
---
agreed!  to address the pvp issue of everyone dying in one hit please add health to our health pools across the board or buff player armors to deal with damage a little better, all of the pve monsters are grindy enough, the queen already consumes a tone of ammo and wear and tear so leave her as is please. more randomness in monster difficulty would be nice. make some of the really stronger ones a little stronger leave the rest as is. at level 200 i only have "oh shit" moments when dealing with a sheepsquatch 3 star legendary. even that isn't too dangerous for me and only elicits a mild response. I think having random mobs that are just hell on wheels adds a nice bit of suspense to any mmo. in ultima online towns used to get rushed by ettins, elder dragons would shapeshift into humans and wander into town and kill hundreds (players in town trying to craft and bank and such mind you. it was glorious) , Im not saying make the grindy parts grindier bethesda I am saying adding a random chaotic near extinction level event to the game would be a superb way to make the world more alive and dangerous. a rogue element that crashes through the wasteland and makes even fully equipped level 200s flee or die.  something that genuinely scares the shit out of anyone regardless of level. hell its the south make it a tornado. its a post nuclear south make it a radiated tornado, sharks are not likely so instead of a sharknado make it a radiated ghoulnado. do that shit bethesda blow some shit UP
---
Yeah but those banks don't lend money indiscriminately for 1.5 million dollar house loans... Though there are really two kinds of banks, ones who make bad loans so they can get as much money from you as they can before they foreclose and take the house to sell it again and others who don't make loans like that. Generally speaking though, people who can afford 1.5m homes know better. It's the people who're buying 200-500k homes who can't afford them that fall into those traps.
---
I can use a .50cal bolt hardened, with a sniper build and I can one shot Max level mutants and glowing ghouls. And your weapon does way more damage then mine.
---
The  Sheepsquatch Shard is a joke is does the same damage how the throwing knifes and 3 poision
---
Nobody knows how long the game will go on, but here is a glimpse of the future:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
That happens to me sooooo many times. The logo stops moving but I can hear the game sound
---
There is a play for 7600 hours challenge
---
Yup, exactly the same, logo spins for a few seconds, stops and all thats playing is the music.
---
U can see your progress there
---
that's right you should be sure that you can pay it complet even if things happen
---
I had issues with this quest after a 'Disconnected from the server' moment .
---
Luckily a couple of game 'restarts' and talking with Rose again got things going.
---
If this doesn't fix it for you you might need to enlist Beth Support's help.
---
You just said that...australia. I don't remember any game in which aussies don't lament the lack of players.
---
It seems like your people have better stuff to do than playing videogames.
---
OK, talk to me.
---
Crapbox 1 problems xD
---
Under Challenges, go to Character section. It will be shown there.
---
How did we go from guns to sex in 3 posts
---
You just need to move your camp to a location not near an enemy spawn point. I‚Äôve build my shop camp right on top of a random event location before and it was interesting like 50% of the time. Friendly robots would spawn in talking to each other, sometime a supply drop showed up inside destroying some decorations. But the other half it was enemies for sure destroying the place. I had to move
---
What‚Äôre you taking about, this is the next WoW bud! Lol
---
Ty! Holy crap, 568
---
Technically you can play FO76 without mmo aspects. It's either goods or service. For just 100 AUD, whether it's goods or service, it's way way worth it. So what if Beths pull the plug on the game? It's the good memory &amp; enjoyment that is important. And by buying the game, we're also supporting the brand and creativity.
---
I would hate it if Beths does not come up with better Fallout game with better gameplay, better graphics, and better interaction that flat out beats this FO76 in a few years.
---
Kill and craft, cook
---
I'm sure I could, I only came on here to ask if there were any end of life plans for this game because a few Google searches didn't give me any results, I figured I'd ask people who've been following the game longer than I have. 
---
Though as far as being counter productive is concerned, couldn't I say the same for you. Your distaste for my distaste in anti-consumer practices is hardly discernable from whining in all honestly. Couldn't you find some better way to spend your time considering I've already given you the sage advice to just stop responding to me on multiple occasions now
---
I would totally record Never Gonna Give You Up on mine
---
Ty!
---
Is there a map or something that shows where enemy spawn points aren't a thing?
---
What lvl are u?
---
You mean in session or the overall online time. The overall time you can locate in challenges if you find the 7600h played challenge it will show for example 200/7600 meaning you played for 200 hours.
---
&gt; High radiation fluid, hardened mass and maybe some other stuff I can‚Äôt remember right now. 
---
High radiation fluids, glowing mass and hardened mass.
---
The only thing you can use raw (non stabilised) flux for is yellowcake for orbital strike beacons or crimson for orbital strike scans.  (Or you can eat it).
---
Yeah and you got 1 answer which you didn‚Äôt like because apparently you‚Äôre in charge of consumer protection for the world. 
---
Why don‚Äôt you just wait for someone else to come along and agree with you, as that‚Äôs what you seem to want. 
---
I guess, like you, I got nothing better to do right now :)
---
But then I‚Äôm in a waiting room, waiting for an appointment. But rest assured, when I get home I‚Äôll be adding more hours to my Fallout 76 total.

Whitesprings is a breath of fresh air, everything else is levels of wasteland. Whitesprings is meticulously repaired by the robots. Most of the map is bland and depressing by design. If whitesprings changed, than other areas that are opposite would need to reflect this as well and grow nicer. 
---
I just dont get why anyone would want the most unique area to look like all the other blown up areas. Not to mention you‚Äôre forcing power armor playstyle in the middle of the map permanently, penalizing everyone else.
---
Sure but memory and enjoyment are intertwined. What if in five years I get nostalgic and decide I want to explore Appalachia again. Fallout 77 might have an even better world to explore, but dozens of artists worked for months and months to craft the world of Fallout 76. So it doesn't even necessarily have to be about its dollar value but also its artistic value. If Bethesda shuts down the server you'd never be able to explore that world again or revisit places you might have fond memories of. Stuff like that
---
You asked a question he answered it, he said don‚Äôt buy the game. MW2 was never going to die. Look at it now and you can‚Äôt even find a TDM lobby. No game is going to last 100 years (maybe WOW or EvE online actually) I mean this is clearly a troll posts bc if you‚Äôre asking if a game is worth it to buy bc you‚Äôre worried it‚Äôll be dead in a few years...dude in a few years there will be a bunch of AAA titles dropped in these next few years so relax, idk why people act like they can only play one game for the rest of their life. And it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to stop releasing other titles. Bethesda is just getting tired of only being known for Fallout (not even their OG game) and TES, (wow wannabe) 76 is just a game nothing more buy it or don‚Äôt none of us really care, it‚Äôs actually really annoying that people ask before buying the game as if they need validation, but I just wanna let you know that for the record, none of is really care if you play or not, but if you‚Äôre not playing please get tf out of the sub
---
Bet you did get to experience the shitty practices at a mining company in the 40s, that's why you are saying this, right?
---
Don't think this will happen,  maybe if bethesda comes up with a set of hundreds of pre recorded scripts we could use to choose to use in our camps. 
---
I just think we can't be trusted with that much power haha
---
Look you neckbeard fuck, you know exactly what you insinuated with your original comment.

Enclave gives you +3 STR and +2 PER.  BoS gives you +2 STR and +3 END

Taking workshops usually entails killing a fee low level enemies, and costs 30 caps for 200-300+ xp. The defense missions are almost always easy and come just a few minutes after initially taking the workshop, and once again are worth 200-300+ xp. Plus free plans and resources for completing the missions.
---
I really like your suggestions; so many min-maxing possibilities for crazy builds, but also for broken OP kits (obviously).
---
Imagine firing Reckless gun while trying to stay alive, maybe compensating with vampire...
---
Your answer was that you got hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of it for the money you paid and you suggested I might as well if it survived for the next few years. That didn't really answer my question. It took you like three responses before you actually said that you didn't believe Bethesda woukd enact an end of life plan. So I offhandedly mentioned that saying the game is play once and play forever is false advertising. You said you didn't give a shit, yet you still responded and still are. Surely there's other Reddit threads you can troll.
---
I saw someone post how the repair kits can 200% it

I‚Äôve been feeling like the quest giver here recently. I farm the Free Range event non stop now trying to get a few more of the weapon mod plans. Every time I initiate the quest I‚Äôll invite anyone to my team that‚Äôs available in the server. Most of the time only one or two will join my team, but others may show up to assist. If we successfully complete the event or not, the ones that joined my team get a modded event weapon. Modded crook is they were useless (that‚Äôs never happened yet). Decent but failed, they get an electrified club. Succeeded, they get a burning barbed staff.
---
Games as a service is fraud, essentially.
---
So if I‚Äôm overencumbered and thus never fast travel I should be fine? As long as I don‚Äôt let my ap or movement drain too low or slow of course, never fun to fight anyone when you move like a snail lol.
---
I do not give a squirrels shit about the verbiage\definition\semantics everything in life comes down to time, time=money money = more enjoyment of your time. how he values his entertainment dollar may be different from mine so I cannot tell him for sure he should get it but I feel I have definitely enjoyed my purchase and still continue to do so. if you want more details about the pluses and minuses of fallout 76 I'd be happy to oblige but overall I give it a 7 out of 10 for entertainment value. there are frustrations with it and its not perfect by a long shot but overall a solid game for me.
---
The extra damage on its on from the rifleman perks sometimes aren't enough. I'd say invest some points into agility and luck. You can over double your damage with sneak attacks and add on the vats criticals and that's a good start to doing some good damage
---
Around 5000 caps at a vendor I just purchase one last week got fed up of waiting for the drop
---
Oh look your so tough internet tough guy, tfoh dumb cunt, you don't get to decide what I meant whatsoever.
---
There are maps out there of all random event locations which include enemy spawns. Not sure if there are maps of just enemy spawn locations. I would just scout out the area before building your camp up too much. And server hop while you‚Äôre doing that to see how things change from server to server.
---
Pancor Jackhammer, Claymore, RPG7, Desert Eagle, Red Ryder
---
Can you not vomit words into a post. There's such a thing as paragraphs. 
---
He did answer my question, the continued to argue with me after I made a comment about false advertising. You're forgetting it takes two to tango. 
---
Last I checked, I can still play Modern Warfare 2, it has an offline singleplayer component, unlike Fallout 76. If Fallout 76 were to add an offline singleplayer mode then that would solve the problem wouldn't it. 
---
In a few years there'll be a bunch of new games you can play sure, so you shouldn't care if I still want to play the old ones right. It doesn't affect you whatsoever. 
---
I wasn't seeking validation, I had one question, whether or not Fallout 76 had end of life plans for when the central server shut down. Instead all I got was people telling me that they spent X amount hours in the game and that it was totally worth the price. I only finally got a roundabout answer to my question when I got snippy with some people. 
---
If you're not going to offer up useful information, get tf out of this thread.
---
This is the so fucking cute üòçüòç
---
Sorry, they called me. Back now. Heading home to play the game now. Have a good one.
---
It‚Äôs floor loot not a Dev room item
---
All this on xbox and latency issues are so bad on some servers, it will show you crippling enemies, crawling, and then they sprint towards you. It‚Äôs as if the server didn‚Äôt receive certain inputs for a good 5+seconds. 
---
So then i server hop and try to place things at the camp to check the lag. Some bad lag on a lot of servers.
---
I'm currently at 158 hours or so and level 74 don't know how the hell I'm supposed to get to 7600 hours that's a massive accomplishment and should get your own pet Sheepsquatch for that
---
The reaso.it has Dr is probably because it's a ported item from Fallout 4, not necessarily because we weren't meant to have it (BOS Paints were dev-room items only for a while as well, but they were already "converted" to be ready for use).
---
Thats all it gave me
---
Why not just add it without having to pay. I already paid 60$
---
I'd say thanks but you've been utterly useless.
---
Noticeably worse on xbox too.
---
Lol ok mate, I‚Äôll leave you to have the last word, seems like you need it.
---
The price from vendors is rediculous so yeah, other players will definitely pay for it. Of course depending on how much they want it I‚Äôd say between 500 and 3000 caps.
---
Your motto should be "Nuclear Winter is coming."
---
Either way that‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Play the game as intended and leveling up should come pretty quick, I personally level up faster looking for junk as enemy encounters are best where the best loot is IMO.
---
I..Ive got something in my eye *sniff*
---
I was beefy boi with gauss and power armor on the front line pre tse nerf. now I am beefy boi with power armor and laser gatling on the front line. vampire laser gat.... whooo man worth the 20 or so levels swapping over I can facetank the queen and the entire bog at the same time with this build.  the TSE nerf made rifles pretty much need stealth. to be anywhere close to where you used to be you will have to get sneaky or swap over and get heavy. as a former beefy boi with rifle I feel your pain it really pissed me off I had a tse gauss and a ts gauss i used the ts gauss for indoors so i wouldn't kill myself. i took a month or so off from the game i was so pissed. changing over to heavy has been good for me though just dont have the patience for that sneaky boi shit.
---
I used to do this all the time in mid levels for no reason. I would use my chameleon mutation and stalk the level 2‚Äôs as they left the vault. More than anything I was just curious to see where they wander initially. Like watching a baby take their first steps. If they got in a bind, I would snipe whatever was giving them a hard time and remain silent. Sometimes sprinting ahead to drop aid items at the overseers camp for them. It‚Äôs harmless fun. They can‚Äôt do anything to you until at least level 5 anyway
---
Do you have a link to those in game models of liberators taking over other robots? Google is failing me
---
Not sure what you mean. There is a 99% cap on damage dealt, for example, dealing 1000 damage on a 1 DR enemy will only inflict 990 damage, never the full listed weapon damage. Also there is an unconfirmed cap on total armor ignored, 95%, so if you stack anti-armor, mods and perks, you can't ignore more than 95% of the enemy armor.
---
Ding!
---
I hope that the players will be given a quest to complete the renovations at whitespring. Maybe during the wastelanders update?
---
Repair it to 200%
---
Yeah it feels more obvious that it needs around 10, like junk extractors and such.
---
Well I've noticed yesterday that ALL meu stimpacks was gone. Dont know If anything else was Lost. I play on PC
---
Well i did word it a bit shittly, but your answer did provide the information i need, thank you :)
---
Nope didnt work either, or did you do a full reset or a quick reset?
---
This guy gets it.
---
I once had a lovely encounter. I killed a guy that went right into a trap we built using leaderboards marker, and upon examining the loot bag, I only found salt in it. On voice chat I asked "oh you only got salt for me" and they responded "yup mate enjoy". I must admit I did enjoy, and we started a little chit-chat, but since the trap was still luring people the chit-chat has been ended by enemy fire and people who I first fought then laughed with I now fought again.
---
I actually add lots of people I fight with to my friends. Pretty useful, allows you to jump surivival worlds if you landed in one dominated by PvErs (I see no reason to go after people doing their events, my targets are only the markers, preferably group of them).
---
The only way in was a keypad. Can‚Äôt pick those.
---
Open popboy &gt; data &gt; probably side/maybe main &gt; find any quests for rose &gt; track
---
Hardened 50 Cal doesn't exist, you might be confusing it for a Refined 50 Receiver...
---
Tsk tsk, how selfish, and after we all grew up together in that vault!
---
I will support the idea if you provide us with a vid/animation/sketch of how to clearly demonstrate willingness to nuke shit out of something with body language only.
---
Not that I dislike the other guy idea with tiny rocket prop, I just need a clear "lets nuke this shit" to use IRL and I'm looking for inspirations.
---
I run stealth sniper build and hadn‚Äôt noticed any difference.
---
I feel really weird when a stranger says they are proud of another stranger. Impressed?  In awe? Envious of skill? Stoked to see she got recognition? Absolutely. 
---
Not sure why you are proud, unless shes your kid.
---
So can I give you free stuff lol
---
Mods that only apply to logs or arms can't be applied because scout armor only has limbs and torso.
---
So brawling, for example can be applied to scout armor arms, but the torso is marked "torso", so can't apply there and the legs and arms are marked "limbs" so brawling can't apply there either.
---
Mods that can be applied are material mods like fibreglass and polymer and things like pocketed and deep pocketed  (though when you buy them you can't tell whether your buying limb or torso mods).
---
The scout armor mods don't care whether your armor is forest or urban, they work on both.
---
I can't imagine what trying to follow a hate speech rule is like in a Canadian guild.
---
I am over 800 hours so far, had no idea till i checked that a few days back. funny how the time can creep up on you.
---
No rads, nuked enemies, nuked loot tables, regular armor &lt;3

BOY
---
Been going on to some degree for about a week or so, for me. I think. Thereabouts. Can't just leave corpses to pick over them later, anymore. Not if you want to be sure to get what they have.
---
Why not start a quest sub reddit and work from there?
---
This kind of suggestion has been a thing  off an on since launch and I doubt with the limitation of the games engine/servers we can make our own holotapes or notes. 
---
On here though, much like the bazzar. Starting a subreddit for quest seems like the first logical choice for those that want to participate in that kind of thing. Players could put their gamer tag, console of choice and what the quest was about. 
---
It would also allow for the quest to be done, participated in without the person needing to be online too. But thats just my idea based off of reading these for last few months.
---
You get the armor not the plans. At least I did. The plans were dropped over time from the SBQ
---
Cool.. will try that ... It's a fun weapon ....
---
That's awesome! Based on the info and artwork, I'd love for this to somehow make it into the game. Maybe as a novel encounter. A bit of a side quest. 
---
I think something is worth of such effort and dedication to the game.
---
Lol who pissed in your Cheerios?
---
Section 6 of the ToS: ZeniMax does not guarantee that any Services will be available at all times, in all countries and/or all geographic locations, at any given time, **or that ZeniMax will continue to offer any particular Services for any particular length of time**.
---
All those vfast swing speed weapons like the chainsaw, ripper, and drill benefit greatly from the 200% repair. However, the condition deteriorates really quickly so you‚Äôll need to keep an eye on that.
---
ohhhh ok thank you for the info!
---
You must live a pretty boring life if this is what "getting bored easily" looks like to you
---
Does a legendary chainsaw excist?
---
NetHack is still seeing updates (it was released in the late 80s)  
---
As is UO, starcraft, etc (late 90s)  
---
All still have active player bases.
---
I'm probably waaaay lower level than you, but it's kind of my understanding that sneaky snipers are generally support characters at big boss events, unless you're running a bloodied build. Regular scorchbeasts? Sure, but SBQ? I thought I was to focus simply on the adds.
---
Also bear in mind that is not additive.
---
With this I mean that 75% from Incisor and 75% from Exterminator is not 150%.
---
If my math is correct - I haven't done this for a long long time - and providing that you are not using any other AA 'effects' that would be 93.75% agains bugs. So 3 lvls of Exterminator gives you a whopping 18.75%
---
Just a guess but the fact that repair kits have been designed not to be able to be sold/traded or dropped by players would suggest that Bethesda have not yet found a way to stop people hell bent on duping from doing so, and if that‚Äôs the case no one will be un-banned anytime soon. The screenshots going around showed emails saying banned players could come back when the exploits were sorted etc so that might be never? With everyone working on the new content and bug fixes is anyone even free to work towards bringing players back that were banned? I can‚Äôt see it myself.
---
Did someone just tell me to "Assume the position" in an alluring robot voice?
---
I believe she is both!
---
I'll try to invest in those as well. I also forgot to mention, that I have Adrenaline card on, which even after full stacks didn't do much...
---
ohhh ok thank you for the info!
---
Sorry to hear that
---
Sorry PC
---
I‚Äôll sell them cheap to start with cause I collected way the hell too much
---
I also have dozens of all the fashnact plans and masks
---
Playing 76 with my wife is the best thing ever. After 76 were going to play monster Hunter üòÅ
---
And barn quilts! They‚Äôre even on the wall at the decor shop in Whitesprings, yet nowhere to be found.
---
I roleplay the bodyguard, and employ a similar tactic. Hang out around the #1 waiting for all the thirsty mofos to come after em.   
---
Now ive gotta level my aid mule to carry all this crap.
---
Thank you for this, I might consider going brt√ºtal with heavy guns then. Will play just a bit longer with rifles.. mby something will change.
---
Because Bethesda probably goofed. I honestly don't get their logic...
---
Every single armor that isn't Power Armor, Combat Armor, or Heavy Leather armor is complete and utter garbage.
---
Marine armor is one of the worst armors in the game DESPITE being one of the best armors in Fallout 4, which makes no sense.
---
The way Armor should have been rated based on total stats DR+ER
---
Wood (slightly better than nothing)
---
Raider (slightly less shit DR and ER)
---
Leather (relatively shit DR, above average ER)
---
Trapper (kind of shit DR slightly below average ER)
---
Metal (meh DR slightly below average ER)
---
Robot (ok DR and average ER)
---
Combat (relatively high DR and ER)
---
Marine (Basically power armor)
---
Really??? I am going to go check today and see if I can loot it. Yay, no killing cats in my game! Lol
---
Fu ya bot
---
Tell me about it, my poor Bramante keeps getting killed.
---
She will likely be free in survival. And if not, you can make her previous customer leave.
---
Why are you worried about 5 years from now when you‚Äôre not even playing today?
---
I suppose there are some specifics for each role in general, however I'd expect to have at least some variety with rifles, since they can be built for different scenarios.. short, long barrels, sniper and dot sights.. so it shouldn't be all black and white.
---
I‚Äôm at 775 I think. Level 275. Only have one character.
---
I‚Äôve been there a few times, and it‚Äôs ALWAY empty. I‚Äôm usually too lazy to server hop too lol.
---
I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt catch diseases as much anymore (for a while there, I was constantly diseased), and with the Toxic Valley disease cure on hand, I don‚Äôt have to rely on firecaps as much. Would still love to grow them though if I can, just so I can keep a steady supply on hand when I don‚Äôt feel like farming.
---
Many countries around the world consider software as goods though I'd say any software with a subscription model is a service, not to mention most games are sold under perpetual licenses. Like Fallout 76.
---
Though I still think that advertising a game as being playable forever (with nary a disclaimer unless you read through the entire terms of service) when it's not is still false advertising and I'm sure the court of public opinion would agree, as well as the law. Especially here in Australia where consumer law goes a lot further. I think the practice of essentially programming a kill switch into your **good** could also be considered less than legal practice.
---
Yeah essentially.
---
You forgot the R91 Assault Rifle from fallout 3!! It's the gun featured on all the commando perk cards! 
---
Bethezduh plz. The combat rifle suuuuuuucks. Gimme a high fire rate AR. It could be slightly lower damage, lower recoil. But better accuracy, and higher fire rate compared to the handmade rifle. (Kinda like the real life M16 vs AK-47.) It could have a fire rate of... 91! Like the 10mm sub! Wouldn't that be ironic and clever? So clever you guys should do it!!!
---
But furreal, 75 rof is like... slow. I'm down for more weapons, but maybe a simultaneous re-balance update is needed too. Laser rebalance, pistol rebalance, blah blah blah.
---
A Saint Andrews Cross, perhaps?
---
Pretty sure they don't. I think those guy were having a laugh.
---
I'd love to be wrong.
---
May I ask to see some proof? What console are you on?
---
\*salutes while shedding a single tear\*
---
Love it, can't even imagine the frame rate drops though. Will be like firing an automatic weapon on launch day üòÇ
---
I couldn't be in 2 world's with my woman.
---
Explosive is dominant because of Demo Expert. Take that perk out and 25% fire rate will be better. If they add other types of damage, which would be really cool btw, we also will need perk cards to boost that damage.
---
No, the it's because the town The Greenbriar is closest to, White Sulfur Springs.
---
Yeah you can kill it but sometimes all he will do is just appear out of nowhere and stare at you at night time and when you try to approach him or shoot him he will fly into the sky and at other times he will appear to attack you.
---
No way man! You didn't answer with \[deleted\] this time! That is insane!
---
Awesome! Your journal is amazing, really happy the folks at Bethesda got to see it and that you got some nice swag. It must be really inspiring for them to see their work reflected like this. Love this story.
---
That would be fun
---
Because to some people $100 is a lot of money. I make roughly $900 to $1000 a fortnight, then I pay $380 towards rent, roughly another $150 towards bills, then I have living expenses, call that another $200. I'm not left with much and I have other things I could be saving for as well. When I buy something, I don't want it to just self destruct in a few years. 
---
I love Fallout as a franchise, I generally like Bethesda games. I think I'd enjoy Fallout 76 but I tend to check out when I hear a game is online only because that's essentially a death sentence. People can name a few games that have been around forever, but there's a lot more that have just been lost to the annals of time because they relied on a central server.
---
That's why I'm worried about whether or not the game will be around in five years even though I'm not playing it now. From a dollar value perspective but also from an artistic and preservation perspective. Fallout 76 looks like a beautiful game, in terms of the world that is, and it probably took a lot of artists a lot of time to make it. If Bethesda pulls the plug on Fallout 76 though, no one will be able to go back there unless Bethesda does have an end of life plan, or the game indeed is supported "forever."
---
I have that coffee mug and it's one of my favorites.
---
I tried everything already. I opened a ticket at bethesda support. Anyway, last hope, i'll try to go over the places where the missions will perform, hoping for something new
---
To install the game you have to agree to the ToS. One of the terms is that you read them. This is a legally binding contract. Saying "we want to support this game, in perpituity" is not.
---
no kill switch needed. They simply stop supporting a service. (The server)
---
You'd have a hell of a time fighting that in american courts. Pretty sure the EU as well
---
The longer you wait to buy it the closer it is to that day when they shut the servers down. 
---
Times a wasting.
---
YAY. I will keep an eye out and see if I can visit their place too
---
I play with my husband and he‚Äôs always a level ahead of me and it makes me angry af.
---
i am in the same boat as you, i carry a gatling gun for SB &amp; SBQ now.
---
I plan on getting a second PS4 for my wife too - she‚Äôs still breastfeeding our 3rd kid and is stuck up in the bedroom.  We had them one after another so this is like 7 years of breastfeeding.
---
SBQ never dropped anything good for me.  Best weapon I have is a 3\* furious gauss rifle I got from the impostor sheepsquash.
---
Thanks for your answer, but I am trying to specifically find answers about the sleek mod, I have the others, polymer, etc.
---
Anyone???
---
I'm guessing like mentioned above that the armor is bugged, though I've been able to add other mods...just not sleek.
---
Good luck mate
---
You know those artists could only produce arts if people support FO76 right? And those artists will become more experienced and be able to create more valuable arts with new engine in the future for our enjoyment. And if we get all nostalgic, those previous arts most likely will present in FO77 with better engine and in more polygons. Just like FO76 that exist because of FO4. Whether you support the game, the devs, the artists, or not, is up to you.
---
These perks are great for eliminating the chance for disease and the need for finding disease cures and antibiotics, but I think you should invest more perk points into your main build whether that be melee, commando, heavy gunner because if you invest 12 points in endurance for iron stomach, vaccinated, thirst quencher and lead belly, then you won't have enough points to make you build powerful. However, if you are doing a support build (this build involves high charisma, high carry weight, carrying heaps of ammo, aids and junk and having everything take up as least carry weight in your inventory as possible), then you could get away with investing 12 points into endurance because you won't need to use as many perks that improve the damage and efficiency of your weapons. If you are planning on doing a support build (this build is best if you are always on a team), you should invest at least two perk points into heavy gunner perks (increase heavy weapon damage) because if you don't have any weapon damage perks at all, then you will have a hard time supporting your teammates - what I wanted to say is that you should have heavy gunner rank 1 and expert heavy gunner rank 1 if you are doing a support build to be able to deal enough damage to help your teammates.
---
Can you make a list? I have several hats and two or three outfits and I was wondering how many variations there were.
---
Yeah, I think it's the result of it being Bethesda's first multiplayer (ESO not withstanding). Single player mechanics in a multiplayer game. They're still tweaking it, but I'm not expecting they'll buff my rifles. I can live with it as is.
---
Non PA armor comes in legendary form. So much better. 
---
I still wear power armor for queen fights. That emergency protocols mod is awesome.
---
With Secret Agent, a MK3 stealth boy can last 6 minutes. With the magazine this can be made longer. This is an expensive tactic to use consistently (MK3s cost 175+ at the Enclave vendor, about the same from players if they sell them) which makes the stealth boy + the bullets used to kill you more valuable than the caps they get from killing you. 
---
Best counter to a spastic Stealth Boy user is an automatic Tesla and your own Stealth Boy. You don't even have to aim it. Point it at the ground and it will arc to your target's chest, break the armor and their hearts.
---
You're welcome.
---
Ugh...humans. "He came to judge you", "He knows what you did", blah-blah-blah. Poor mothman just wanted to watch good fireworks in peace and everyone lost their shit over it.
---
It's probably more down to your dps being wayyyyyyyy lower that auto heavy gun builds. I have a character specd into each and my heavy guns melts scorchbeasts and sheepsquatch. Imposter and SBQ are poor benchmarks due to the sheer amount of health they have.
---
 My vats crit sniper can down regular scorchbeasts quickly when using a higher dps weapon such as the handmade but struggles against tanky opponents when using the lever action. I find the higher damage single shits good for regular mob sniping and long range pvp.
---
I enjoy both builds.

I read that because there are no mods in the game for it, it can't go past 100%.
---
Good thing I wouldn't be fighting it in American courts. Though we can see that it doesn't take American courts to change things in American corporations. The ACCC brought refunds to Steam globally after all.
---
By turning off the server, they're essentially bricking the good they sold. They're not selling me a server maintenance package, they're selling me a video game on a perpetual license that promises me indefinite access to the product I purchased. The product I purchased was a video game, not program that displays a "Cannot connect to server" message when I launch it. I'm pretty sure that could hold up in court. 
---
I'm not sure why you're against Fallout 76 having an end of life plan, considering that you'd ought to be a player if you're in this sub, and you'd benefit from having access to this game beyond the end of official support, then again you might never want to play it again after a certain date what do I know but why would it affect you if I do? It seems like Stockholm Syndrome to me.
---
I agree, some balancing would be nice. I honestly think a pvp server was not a good idea since they already had so much stuff to fix in the first place. They‚Äôll probably work on balancing pvp in the fall if haha. I‚Äôve heard the excuse ‚Äúit‚Äôs in beta‚Äù but come on, it‚Äôs in alpha at best.
---
Prime weapons for sbq.
---
"excellent option for small game hunting"
---
Yeah, that was worth a chuckle.
---
Hey thanks! I have a lot of work to do :)
---
The game fuckin HATES gardens.
---
Best counter to a stealth boy is to use a stealth boy. Great balance. And there is an exploit that does allow then to last 3 times there normal amount, I'm not going into detail on how to do it. I'm sure Bethesda is aware. As for the team rifle, what are you supposed to do when your a shotgun build, or a heavy build, or melee?
---
I run a bloodied rifle build with a focus on damage output. My bloodied handmade does 350 damage at 20% HP, but I'll often die from one ghoul hit or mutant bash, so being a full health type guy would improve that.
---
I'd recommend bloody mess and sneak attack perks to boost those initial one shot sneak kills. I also struggle with higher level mobs sometimes once I'm in danger.
---
You'd probably break your arms firing the thing for sure.
---
From the queen, even!
---
Nice.
---
Fire rate is a good option, but absolutely agree, the second star needs major rework.
---
Whatever your intentions were, your actual *post* came across as negative and mean. Might want to grow up and do some self-reflection before making more comments.
---
Absolutely on bored with this.
---
Sure, but that would be like saying we shouldn't be allowed to watch Solaris anymore because Stalker is the better Tarkovsky movie. New art doesn't overwrite old art, because art has an inherent value. I'd love to support the artists, but as someone who is also artistically inclined I can imagine how shitty it would feel to have something I worked hard on for months be shut down and locked away so that no one could ever see it again.
---
This is the sweetest thing &lt;3 Sadly we only have one console in our house, so I have a Fallout husband on the other side of the world I sometimes play with. Would love to play with my actual husband, tho.
---
No? I guess I just find things like this incredibly slow and takes patients and skill that I don't have.  I'm not by any mean trying to put OP down, I'm extremely impressed actually. 
---
It's just not something I could spend I could spend time on, prefer exciting hobbies, but everyone has different tastes
---
You're not wrong.
---
No problem! I've seen the green, brown, white &amp; white dirty, and weathered uniforms all spawn on the third floor of Fort Defiance, on the Brotherhood side where the Overseer cache is at near the elevator. There are three spawn points up there: one can spawn on a bottom bunk in both bedrooms, and the other spawns inside the bathroom/shower area in the back on a bench. The hats are all very common and spawn inside as well. And the other colored uniforms, as far as I am aware, are all only reward events from the Cranberry Bog
---
For some reason i cant even put alcohol in it. Will try it with keys. If it works i'm gonna put as many keys in there as i can. That will teach them freeloaders.
---
Again, making assumptions about what it meant. I the only ones here who need self reflections are those who think they get to decide others intentions, instead of asking for clarity.
---
That's because high level veterans have crippled her. Not a glitch. That's what we're going for.
---
I mean, there might be a glitch that makes her do that. But I don't know how to recreate it without beating her ass with a limb damage weapon.
---
again, ToS is a legally binding agreement.  A tweet is not.
---
Awesome, my pvp experiences have been the best thing about this game for me. Teams going head to head has been the highlight, along with holding a workshop as an open challenge to the lobby.
---

No, buddy, you need to realize that your *intentions* don't matter. We don't get to read your intentions, just your words. So when you're careless with your words all you can really do is apologize and move on. Instead, you're blaming the rest of the world and digging in your heels.

No, you can, however, get it in the next twenty minutes if you add and join me in game.

Yea I have more hats than outfits. I‚Äôll check the bathrooms next time, I still haven‚Äôt finished the Recruitment Blues quest (late start) so I‚Äôll be back at Fort Defiance soon for sure.
---
Yeah, this was the real evil of company towns &amp; corp scrip. The scrip was **worthless** outside the company town, so no matter how hard you worked &amp; saved, if you quit or were fired you had **nothing** to survive on.
---
While miscommunication is the cause of many problems in the world, so are assumptions and it goes both ways.
---
76 has its one version of the White Death. Good to know. I'd say I'll keep my eyes out but.. You know.. Invisible.
---
I gotcha. The floor that recruitment blues takes you to, the one with the terminal to register to access the elevators, is the area where the three spawn points are! It's specifically that back area though, the two bedrooms back there and the bathroom
---
1. Armor ignore (and to correct your above assumption, reduction from Sentinel) does not go over 100%. The effects are multiplicative, not additive. Even with full Assassin/Sentinel/Dodgy/Blocker, you cap out at about 88-90% DR (this is before armor is applied to the final value, which is why you see people taking almost no damage if you're hitting with a low damage weapon). The DR on Ultracite isn't what will save you. VATs criticals cut through PA, Sentinel/Assassin/Dodgy with 100% effectiveness. The person you were fighting was likely not banking on a crit.
---
2. If you are relying on 'raw damage', the armor ignore isn't as pivotal as maximizing your chances to cause stagger and thus render sentinel/cavalier ineffective. Without the % adjustments, everyone dies to everything.
---
3. To simplify the DR equation, just remember that it's based on incoming damage vs your DR value. So, if something is going to hit for 500 damage and you have 500DR, you will take 50% of that damage as HP. The scale is non-linear, and once damage exceeds your DR by a factor of 6.3-6.5x, your armor is permitting 99% of the damage to go through. This calculation is run AFTER anti-armor effects are applied, so when you're running in PA and someone cuts your armor value by 75% and then tags you with a shot that does over 500 damage, you're going to die. The phenomenon outlined above can be seen in the chart of the Fallout 4 section of the article you linked.

Really well! SBQ flew off for a while, then came right back. Great effort from everyone that showed up.

But that Tarkovsky movie can only exist because of Stalker and many elements of Stalker are present in Tarkovsky :) Also, Tarkovsky, in this analogy, is a son of Stalker that won't get born if Stalker failed or dead.

I think you just don't want to support the devs and the artists. It's okay though because no one forces you too. But you are trying to justify your view in reddit and obviously you will get a reasonable response.

They're dropping so much from imposter and sbq that their values has plummeted to around 500 caps.

You can stay on the server without your camp. Or you can leave and find a new one that allows your camp to be placed. You don't have to find a new place to put your camp. It will still be there in the next world.

So, we're not supposed to actually believe the words you chose to use? At that point, *nothing* can be written without everyone asking "What did you *really* mean?"

This, farm the eastern regional penitentiary until level 30 or so then switch to white springs golf course l. Farming sucks but it‚Äôs the fastest way if that‚Äôs what you want to do.
---
Well they promised that we will have some level of customization. I'm guessing that we will be able to choose what item we want and how many stars we want on it. Rest is random. But who knows really. It would be great if we could reroll individual affixes tho but it prolly not gonna happen. Also it would be cool if we could create legendary items from non-legendary ones. Like scout armor or new weapons from free range event.

Lol, feel free to exchange any word/synonym there for "proud" or "elated" or "happy" or whatever makes you feel comfortable. See, when it comes to communication, all that matters is your intent. Allow me to be clear about my intent with a spot of Windex: I would like to express how happy for and PROUD of the author I am for their creativity and contribution to our community, from one good human to another.
---
Are you dying irl or something? End of life plan? Dude, play the game or don‚Äôt. Stop making all these strange demands. The game has been out for six months and the first wave of content is hitting and you want them to be talking about the game‚Äôs eventual shut down? It‚Äôs just weird and unnecessary. 
---
If you buy the game now you‚Äôll have ages to get your money‚Äôs worth. Who cares about fives years from now if you still will play it. There will be a million better games out by then, and a new console generation too.
---
Ohh i see. I only keep ballistic bock and rad ant lager on me so i only tried these and normal beer that i craft for challenges. Thanks. Gonna try some other alcohol.

Heavy Guns only.  Commando work with automatic rifles, Heavy Guns with heavy automatics.  Tesla Rifle with automatic mod benefits from Commando, its a "heavy weapon" but benefits from rifle perks.
---
WV had to have had a WWII museum or two right? We've got a friggin tommy gun for cryin out loud!
---
Quest idea: Explore a WWII museum, get a random roll for a legendary M1, plus plans for non-legendaries. Maybe throw in any history of real life WV contribution to the war effort. Plus bonus weapons like the grease gun, 1911, M1 Carbine, etc.
---
Maybe it could be a military museum, with weapons from multiple wars. Grab legendary muskets, M16 "service rifles", along with Energy weapons from the Moon War eluded to in Fallout 4!
---
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt from around here, are ya boy?‚Äù

---
Yeah, something is up with weapon swapping. Every time I swap, escape artist goes off, which tells me that in actuality, I've destealthed and restealthed. Makes sense you could get detected in between.
---
In addition to what you have, I‚Äôd recommend adding the sneak perks; sneak, covert operative and escape artist, all under AGI. They all work together to give you a lot more damage (up to 2.5X) while in sneak and make it much harder to be detected. 
---
I‚Äôd also be sure to add Bloody Mess (LCK) and tenderizer (CHA). Definitely max out Bloody Mess, it‚Äôs a flat 15% bump to your base damage, while even 1 point of tenderizer is probably fine. 
---
You can get some points back by just going with 1 point in Adrenaline. It‚Äôs a good perk, but really only effective with big mobs that you can chain kills off of. The difference between rank 1 and 5 isn‚Äôt that big in practice. You‚Äôll get more benefits from the other perks. 
---
Also consider hunting down an anti-armor lever gun. Yes, damage is higher on TSE, but it has no armor penetration. Those high level, boss type enemies all have lots of DR you need to punch through.
---
Bethesda is still good, people refuse to see it.
---
I mean, your lashing out just confirms to them that you're a dick. So, hope that's what you were going for.
---
Just keep trying, some servers are better than others. It also helps a miniscule amount if you use what you want, ie you want unyielding, pick up a 1 star piece from a vendor. You will still get all other sorts of crap, but you will see more unyielding pieces drop over time

Get yourself a set of  Weightless Heavy Metal armour and contract the grounded mutation.

I'm pissed, because my characters are mostly stuck on "Tick Blood Tequila" which requires flux. And I've just not had any luck getting flux in the past two weeks, so I can't unlock any other recipes.

Its a great game. For all it's bugs and glitches, it's still really fun.
---
I thought it was a plastic prop.
---
Please tell me how someone saying "Look here you neckbeard fuck" and me acting negative back confirms I'm a dick, you make zero sense.

That's like saying hey bud, all these people are treating you like garbage because you miscommunication and they made assumptions, but you should just take it lying down and let people treat you however they want.

Sorry I'm not one to be walked on.

Following lol I have been doing that stupid run way to many times
---
I know it. I must drop off 20 a day. It‚Äôs getting old, but if that‚Äôs the best way I‚Äôll do it I guess
---
I believe there was an effect in Fallout 4 similar to your heavy rounds effect. It added +25% damage and limb damage, but greatl increased recoil. It was awesome on certain weapons, such as the gauss rifle.
---
The last system my wife used before XBONE was the Nintendo 8bit. She took her sweet time learning how the controller worked. Took her a few months to get the hang of the sticks. My friends and I were supportive and played alongside, encouraging her all the time. One day, I saw she had levelled up on her own. When I asked, she told me she had been playing secretly while I was at work. üòé
---
I‚Äôd like to build a base in the bog but there‚Äôs so many scorch beast attacks it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
Added you!
---
Same not the 20 a day I do it once almost every day since beta. But if it's the only way I guess I'll keep doing it.
---
The small things we share, are the best things that glue us together.
---
I had a whole build in Fallout 4 based on Freezing weapons. Freeze on crits worked insane wonders
---
Aw so lucky :( I want a superb drop, I‚Äôve been playing for ages
---
Yep. I am XBONE X, she's XBONE. My set is 75 inch. Hers is 55 inch. I would gladly switch but space is the consideration.
---
The fact you think that's what "pacifism" means tells me you've got a lot to learn. It's not about being walked on, it's about you egging them on and giving them exactly the ammunition to prove you're a dick. All you've accomplished is getting them to think they were right all along.
---
It's not for everyone for me mutations and late game pvp but another thing is find friends to play with and never really play solo would be my suggestion
---
Us too! We got my sister and brother in law to play with us too and they live across the country so it‚Äôs a total blast. We tend to wear matching outfits like the civil war uniforms or park ranger outfits. We look like a bunch of weirdos but it‚Äôs awesome.
---
Please don‚Äôt tell people about how much safer it is to use workshops in survival compared to adventure, I‚Äôm enjoying not having them contested for a while.
---
We actually prefer no PA. We use PA only when necessary. She has demon speed and Marsupial. When you share the charisma perk "stranger in numbers" it's amplified. I have 9 mutations so... Our mutated coefficient is pretty powerful. Our builds are complimentary.

Didn't they do that on Z Nation?

Thanks. She is very more worthy of the praise. She works from home and is the best mother to our son possible. The injury doesn't stop her mentally. Strongest person I have ever met. We have a retired Navy Seal in the family who says she's tougher than most recruits. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Now you're not even making a coherent argument, so I think I'll put this to bed.
---
It‚Äôs good to remember how shit this was at launch and now it‚Äôs only barely improved
---
For me the ranking of the Bethesda Fallouts are New Vegas -&gt; 3 -&gt; 76 -&gt; 4.
---
While I think both 4 and 76 fail at a fundamental level to be decent Fallout games, I feel like 76 is at least an entertaining spin off that can be enjoyed for some of its own merits.
---
They both fall into the category of 'Decent game, crap Fallout game'
---
Good ideas- there should be a team pvp event that spawns around Whitesprings. There‚Äôs always so many people there anyway.
---
That's what Sparks it. Honestly, we had so much fun in FO4 Survival mode. We played all the DLC and tried to get every achievement. We did playthrough 7 times until we finally needed a change. FO76 came. Pre ordered. Got in at beta for me. BOOM. She's in.
---
I love it, played all the fallout games including 4 for about as much time. I enjoy helping others new to the world get started and trading has become really fun. 
---
Role playing as a wildlife ranger checking on folks has been a hilarious pastime as well. I feel like people find it fun taking up roles in the world rebuilding the wasteland.
---
I enjoy survival, my pvp encounters have been good as well. I've only ran into god tier builds 3 times and been stomped outright. I'd agree some balancing needs to be put in place, mostly on armour prefixes.
---
Just unlucky. Sadly. Did you die shortly before she did? Sometimes if you respawn late in the fight the game forgets you were there... has happened to me before.
---
yeah!! if you have trouble finding it hmu and ill get you the specific location
---
Very unlucky, I've done it 30 or 40 times &amp; it's only happened to me once or twice, unless recent updates have made it worse
---
She deserves the biggest set and an elite controller for her efforts. Kudos to moms!
---
Looks like a f76 promotion

..but that's moot. if he raises his intelligence to 1, he'll find he no longer cares about video games, and will start watching the sunrise and spending time with loved ones, while enriching the world outside his door.

Got over 1000 hours in FO76. Way more than fallout 4.
---
I love it.

Part of the key fragments quest didn't pop up for me, the unmarked part was at Fred's BBQ Shack (at least for my 3 characters it was this way) rose mentions it but it never appeared as a marker for me
---
Play sticks out left hand palm up. Puts right hand on palm and makes explosion mime with right hand. (In game a tiny nuke will explode about the size of a deathclaw head. As the dust settles the letter of the nuke site you want to use will appear and then settle.
---
I heard you have to be doing over 300 damage before you are actually hitting it and allowed to loot
---
Literally just finished watching this! I love the game, his video was great though. I can see you (and me now) getting downvoted by the manbabies
---
Random question but why does countless people put 66* or 420 in their SN? Is it supposed to show people you're tough or a pothead or that you worship Satan.  I don't get it üòÇ
---
The best drop I got was a bloodied hatchet with 40% faster swing speed and 90% reduced weight. It's not as good as an explosive .50 but I know the feeling of getting a great drop. Congrats!
---
(While mimicking the lotr "and my axe" voice): you have my silo
---
I find it kinda stupid how they had vending machines in the trailer, but then they release them months after the game comes out...
---
My husband got me hooked on this game, now I play more than he does! (He's a higher level, so I am still playing catch up.) It makes me so happy to know other couples are out there, playing together. Maybe I'll come across some of you. Happy travels! (And OP, I hope your wife feels better.)
---
I don't do 300 damage and I get loot when I kill her.
---
Very low level.
---
It's usually server lag and gotta give it about 30 seconds to catch up and items usually appear.
---
There definitely needs to be a mode where you don‚Äôt lose everything or it‚Äôs reduced. Because while I‚Äôd like to pvp a little more I‚Äôm level 42 and I know I‚Äôm going to get one-shotted in survival
---
Nah, it's random.
---
I've had much better drops since I stopped going to whitesprings. I do events and random spawns and clear out specific locations like westek and the steakhouse and robco and Harper's Ferry. 
---
I literally walk the road from Robco to thunder mountain. Or the tracks through the savage divide from whitesprings to the palace of the winding path.
---
Cr√©ate new character and then learn more 
---
Voila done
---
Exactly what i did
---
 Yeah, its a punch bowl. Who the hell puts beer in a punch bowl?
---
How is it bugged?
---
I'm going to counter with this in hopes of fostering a healthy discussion: Fallout 3 is the best true-to-roots modern fallout, 4 is better than NV, and 76 is its own thing.
---
Gauss might. Tesla shouldn‚Äôt.
---
Gauss is a super weird hybrid gun, but tesla is straight up energy gun, and explosive energy guns were disabled
---
No, I didnt die in either of the two fights :c sad that I just had bad luck tho
---
Explosive weapons with +50ÔºÖ limb damage can take out entire crowds of scorched and ghouls with one hit, and the targeting computer on the missile launcher is unique: they seem to be utility weapons to me
---
So does the -50% gun accuracy on Talons also decrease the VATS accuracy?
---
A very young me, say 30 years ago, might... 
---
Good times... horrible times...
---
No, again, because they're only obtainable through the dev room
---
If you scrap it's a 100% chance to learn to craft it
---
Sneak focused auto rifles is pretty op what system do you play on so I can try to help by talking instead
---
For the boss fights, I switch rifle perks for commando and use a primed auto handmade or 10 mm submachine gun.  The rifle build is still excellent for the adds.
---
Did you click on the responder in the cage? Mine was doing the same thing and it got things rerolling.
---
What's tldr? 26min is too much for me
---
4 is a rail road with zero agency. I'd happily never play it again
---
Definitely think 76 is it's own weird thing.
---
Gauss uses energy to send a ballistic projectile. Judging by the fact that it was TSEs that were heavily duped, and I already snatched three different non-two-shot-but-still-explosive gausses out of market, they must still be dropping.
---
Xb1. Should I swap out of rifles to commando?
---
My combat rifle just didn‚Äôt seam to do much dmg and I was chewing through ammo
---
I tried waiting over five minutes for the items to load, then I just gave up on waiting for it.
---
Did u get Anti armor explosive? I can‚Äôt find any of that armor in market
---
that's not a bug, that's a feature :)
---
seriously though, were they sneaking?
---
I see you met the fanboys. Pay no mind to all of the down votes it's what the fanboys here do.
---
This genuinely made me laugh.
---
This is true but its not really relevant. You should be able to repair to 200% at any weapon bench just like all other weapons.
---
Your artwork is excellent! Watercolour and ink? It's a great idea! I'm feeling inspired, but my art will be perhaps HALF as good as yours is. Thank you for sharing this with us!
---
Protip: antiarmor halves damage resistance for ballistic weapons. Explosive weapons aint ballistic weapons anymore, they do explosive damage. AAE is the worst explosive combination there is. Even exterminators explosive is better because at least it gives you anything when you fight mirelurks. AA gives you nothing, if its AAE.
---
Xb1.  Should I use the commando perks instead of rifleman?   And how do I respec? Or am I stuck with what I have till 50+
---
Ehm ok
---
What about Instigating Explosive?
---
4 is personal. A parent desperately navigating a new world to find their child. That's pretty urgent to me.
---
One of the most potent damage combination for lone wanderer PvE
---
Cheap outrage magnet.
---
Don't give the hack the money.
---
Ok, I got u. It‚Äôs kinda new info for me about aae combination,
---
But I believe it could be true
---
bad luck or bad servers. The last two days all I got from the SQB loot window was an infinite loading circle and the event reward was a slap in the face. What a waste of ammo.
---
I like that idea. most temp team ups are fairly organic, they just happen, but it'd be nice to have an emote to get the point across.
---
If you kill the SBQ frequently, you're probably swimming in them.  I think you get about 3 per run.
---
Not complaining, since that means you can run that battle and not come out with a loss in terms of repair costs... although I think they probably should be weightless, at least in Adventure mode.
---
I just got my sixth variant of the paint a few hours ago but as far as I can tell this is the hard earned way to get them
---
Bethesda has no answer to balance the game for the multiplayer, that's why all of the weapons and legendary effects that were fun in Fallout 4 got nerfed.
---
I did think of that and was doing it. I was ambushed when I had to defend it from mobs. Someone mentioned I just do the Recapture event after failing the Defend so I may try it
---
Its mostly him pointing out the predatory practices from Bethesda.  Go watch one of his shorter videos. Pretty funny guy
---
Ugh been trying since beta and nothing. And no one really has extra to just sell.
---
Unless you have a trunk of assassins gear.
---
The Todd be with you
---
More whining? Cba to watch.
---
Yeah, once used you can‚Äôt get another copy, so what I do when farming them is just watch a video on a device and farm the hell out of the enclave military wing till I get one, it takes about a week or two to get a paint but it‚Äôs worth it
---
You need 8 codes per silo I believe. Then you have to decode it all through a website. Or just look up the codes for this week on line. They are the same for everyone
---
I followed some of your entries, and they were incredible.
---
Nice I'm over 130 on one character
---
Um, hello?  The Pioneer Scouts quest is also coming on Tuesday, along with the Backpacks.
---
Just to recap, Patch 9 will be:
---
* Player vending.
---
* Legendary scrapping for tokens.
---
* Pioneer Scouts "Ever Upward" quest line.
---
* Backpacks.
---
Yeah, don't let it discourge you. Queen fights are some of the most fun the game can offer... Are you sure you're joining the event? Is everyone down there yellow, like you're on a team with them? Your getting the countdown for the quest? 
---
What are you using for a weapon? I've heard there is a damage threshold, not sure I believe it, but if there is and you aren't hitting it... maybe it's your weapon.
---
I'm not buying AAE myself so no profit for me in saying it aint a godroll. AA50% vats crit dmg is halfuseless - its useful when you fill your crit bar, but crits ignore DR so AA does not make the crit stronger. The best 2nd perk for AA I believe to be firerate, and weapons such as AAFirerate are IMO godrolls when applied to correct weapons and correct builds.
---
That‚Äôs what I do. But the fast travel back and forth adds up in caps. I used to just collect all and put them in but then I read they don‚Äôt stack anymore so it‚Äôs better to do one at a time. I get 3 or 4 and then hop and do it again lol
---
Excellent I'll add you when I get on can't wait to play
---
why are you booing him, he's right
---
why are you booing him he's right.

If you have the code from nukacrypt, you only need one nuclear key card. Just type the code carefully, since you don't have a spare.
---
Aww man I had a two shot assassins sniper rifle for you but I don't know where I put it
---
Level 177, sadly addicted to grinding and can confirm the drops beer towards what you wear and use as weapons. As soon as I got my first unyielding drop and wore it, I started getting it much more commonly, and when I upgraded from metal to combat armor my drops moved to combat armor.
---
Same with weapons, once I saw my first lever action and handmade drops they started falling much more often.
---
Hang in there, keep grinding and work on higher level enemies
---
Well good luck, oh and also it turns out you can find the BOS combat armor plans in the wastes, just a tip
---
Like forcing us to buy repair kits and play survival? totally agree
---
Are you playing on Xbox, I play with my husband as well!
---
Excellent that you guys are so involved with each other!
---
Yea I heard the 2 places are close together. I‚Äôve been looking also lol
---
I knew I saw this awhile back. Thanks for the link!!
---
So, to be clear, you have an endless loading spinner rather than it just being blank?  Because there is a difference.  The spinner means it thinks you are owed something, and the server just can't get its act together to give it to you (and may never will).  Blank means you won't get anything.
---
Do you really wanna know tho
---
Of course, just a tip to those that at least want to improve it some.
---
brave gamer time
---
Love the explosive 50 cal.  I have one too.  Every once in a while I take it out for a spin especially if hunting the SBQ. 
---
Got a 3 star explosive sub machine gun from the queen many moons ago.  Not sure I‚Äôve gotten much since lol.

---
LOL  THX!
---
In terms of DR/ER, BoS Combat Armor is the best.
---
That said, if you want Rad Resistance to be part of the equation, Marine Armor offers that.  I run the SBQ a lot in Unarmed, so with Marine Armor, and 100 RR, I can stand next to her and take virtually no Rads.  Same can't be said for BoS Combat Armor because that +25 radiation resistance Legendary perk doesn't work, and Lead Lined only goes so far.
---
Not whining? Just going over the shit decisions Bethesda made and how much of a shit show launch was
---
If u use the site nukacrypt,.. might sound silly but double check that you‚Äôre going into the proper corresponding silo for that complete code post.

You don‚Äôt need to know all three codes, just a full set for that particular silo

Lots on the road map. Plenty coming.

This is a services post. :)

You can check my previous posts.  I was ranting about drops.  I‚Äôve been playing since Beta day one.  Nothing.  Fellow gamers here encouraged me not to give up.  And then it finally happened.  And just in time for my birthday, too!

One thing that is imperative that is added is 2 factor authentication. I believe this it a basic necessity now for ANY online game.

That would be great, especially if we could pick the new effect. But even if we didn‚Äôt get to pick, just a chance at something different would be welcome. I have several 3* items that are basically 2* items for me because the third effect is useless for my play style.
---
Service is just different meaning of trade
---
This would be so cool.
---
Having the option to be a quest giver in a sense.
---
In the aid tab when you're talking to the science lab terminal
---
I fully expected a 1 Star piece of wood armor.  Or a Zealots spear or something.
---
U didn't damage her that much
---
He mentioned a few things in the video, namely the premium store and its unreasonable prices, the canvas bag hoo-ha, the false advertising of the $80 dark nukem bottle, and the contradictory refund policies practiced by Bethesda (sometime a few months ago?). 
---
I don't even play the game, but decided to come on this sub just to see what the situation is like and half expected a dead Sub similar to r/AnthemTheGame. Guess Fallout fans are just too loyal huh.
---
Yep. Came back to a rude awakening myself aswell. Now I'm shotguns till I run out of shells and materials to craft more and then switch to melee.
---
How is the ammo spending with heavy weapons? Is the damage much higher than rifles per shot now?
---
Except I‚Äôm not trading.
---
My ancestors are smiling at me imperials, can you say the same?
---
Endless loading screen, I just did another fight on a different server, so this is the third time now :/
---
That sounds pretty sweet.
---
Farming
---
Get unyielding armor and serendipity soon as you can
---
Thanks God it's not just me. I used to be able to just play events all night
---
it's fair
---
Currently, 3* is the max, or 4* on some weapons using special mods
---
Exactly how I felt.
---
So if you drink a serum whike have the mutation it gives you the pure form forever? Or just for an hour?
---
So more whining. Pretty sure all that has been covered ad nauseam already. 
---
Don‚Äôt like the game, don‚Äôt play. Move on.
---
Awesome and thank you!
---
In the beginning should I even bothered with actually going bloodied or focus on strength cards..I think u kno what I mean
---
Wait until like 60, now if you don‚Äôt follow my warning. Get the mutation adrenaline reaction any others up to you , nerd rage need that too, and radicool bumps up carry which is so useful. And from there it‚Äôs finding the armor you want and weapons
---
see [https://www.vgr.com/main-quests-fallout-76-the-missing-link/](https://www.vgr.com/main-quests-fallout-76-the-missing-link/) 
---
to complete de missing link you must go to **Abbie‚Äôs Bunker**
---
It triggered for me when I was very close to the front of the vaultboy statue and aiming at it. My farther away picture didn't trigger. You could also try logging out and back in just in-case that might help.
---
Bloodied unyielding build is very fun but hard to master. You are a glass cannon. Capable of dishing out insane amounts of damage but you really have no good defense. I run a stealth unarmed bloodied build and I love it.
---
I do like the game, I am playing it, I can still laugh at the stupid decisions Bethesda made, like DOXXING ME, stop getting your fee fees hurt over a trip down memory lane
---
Thanks! Anyone down to help me launch my first Nuke?
---
Thx.
---
They really gutted the rifles. It's quite sad that my shotgun does the same damage, with full health.
---
So focus on strength?
---
I have been asking the same question.
---
1) Make sure you go to Site Charlie.
---
2) Use the Nuclear Key Card
---
3) Enter Charlie's code very carefully.
---
Code entered wrong = no joy today.
---
Good luck!
---
Oh did they, must've missed that.
---
Np! And happy nuking.  If you get stuck running the silo there‚Äôs lots of YouTube video guides too üëçüèº
---
Me too.  Thank you!
---
I know you can place a terminal to edit which color is used for the lights. It works for the single bulb and light boxes. Make sure the lights are on the same wiring as the terminal.
---
My two characters are almost identical in rifle builds I need to switch it up
---
Thanks if you're on PS4 I'd be happy to have you tag along! üëç
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and it seems like some servers have a bunch of worthwhile events going on while some will have none. Really seems like a server crapshoot.
---
Yeah so the explosive energy market will crash one day
---
Really excited for all of those things and everything that has been added I‚Äôve really enjoyed, I would however really like some grittier new content. 
---
Fallout has always had a particularly humour but it seems to have become far too focused on ‚Äúfun activities‚Äù, I‚Äôd really like something a little more serious to get stuck into. 
---
Just my opinion,
---
I'm swimming in the darn things, much like the Repair Kits.
---
I guess this is what they replaced Mutation Serums with, once you get all of those Prime Receivers.
---
Are you stupid? There is no whining. It's recapping all their blunders
---
The light machine gun or mg42 is probably the crappiest heavy gun but the hardest to fine , i have about found about 5 and im lvl 110
---
For one hour. Basically it's a side effect of the serum.
---
Are you real or did you actually buy a bunch of old logins? (Just found out you can buy old reddit accounts) 8 year old account with only 3 posts?  I apologize if this is real, but we seem to get hit with some pretty wild stuff. And unfortunately it make it difficult for actual players with odd problems to be believed.
---
A missing character is a pretty sensational claim. With no previous fallout posts, it's hard to jump on this at face value.
---
If you are one of the people just trolling because you got banned, please stop. You are hurting players, not bethesda.
---
Oh ok, thanks for the heads up
---
Now you mention it, haha! Thanks. :) What's the feature? Is it a perk card?
---
I totally have.  It‚Äôs where I got my first TSE handmade.  Then I got a TSE Gatling &amp; a (now legacy) 3 star explosive Plasma Gatling.  I just fracking wanted to actually see something I wanted drop.  You know?  Just to have the feeling of knowing I earned it.
---
I struggled with this also, I managed to get it triggered by being pretty close to the statue and aiming the camera to the top half of the statue. Hope this helps.
---
Nah, he's just a blind fanboys, there's a difference
---
stand on the ledges at WS
---
I want a bloodied explosive TSE.
---
All the friends I convinced to get this game at launch have quit playing and moved to other games because the rewards of finding an exciting legendary item is so low. They have said this very thing to me. Due to trading I have new friends who still enjoy F76 as I do. But Bethesda is for sure losing players because of how the loot tables are set. 
---
I get that they want to balance the game according to their ideas of work/reward but that doesn‚Äôt mean their ideas are spot on making the game play as it does now. 
---
This Legendary Vendor is a way to give players some control over what we receive for grinding. Only time will tell if B gets it right the first time or, more likely, must respond to players‚Äô feedback about how this addition could make the game more fun.
---
I‚Äôd rather have  a delay and a feature that works than a rushed feature that deletes all my stuff
---
Same problem on Xbox. Games crashes entering West Tek easily 1/3 of the time.
---
Hello, Miss BillyBob DangerPants!
---
Not sure if me missing that is why I'm being downvoted??
---
I don't think I've seen a single MG42!
---
From a few people that I saw do it you need someone that is not you in the picture. But I could be rough. Have tried too with no luck. Play solo a lot and had no one to try it with.
---
vats is your friend
---
Exactly this.
---
I want to be a toaster, why only two genders? I am offended duh
---
I started the fight with about 15000 rnds of 5mm.  And almost 10000 rnds if 50.  I‚Äôm already an ammo grinding freak.  I always hoped that if I got the drop, I‚Äôd be prepared and have the ammo ready.
---
;-)
---
In New Vegas you pretty much have two choices, go North at the start and die screaming, or go South and play through the opening game line up of locations. You can either do those quests for the money and xp, or get to the strip under leveled and supplied.
---
In Fallout 4, you pretty much can pick a direction and walk. My most recent play through I have 60 hours and haven't even so much as met a major faction or gone down the main storyline past killing Kellog. By the time I even visited Diamond City, I already had X-O1 power armour without doing anything but wander from place to place.
---
One of these feels more like a rail road then the other, take a pick which is which
---
No not necessarily first focus on your build like melee or rifle or shotguns get all those cards that increase the damage and such. Once you get everything ironed out like you have as much damage as possible when I full health. Then start getting your bloodied ready also will need starched genes, class freak up to you
---
psn k-o-d-a-m-a
---
getting on with a few soon
---
As you recover from being homeschooled, you'll learn that many things aren't as black and white as you might initially assume. Sometimes they are, of course, but common naming conventions just like the rest of culture are sometimes referencing previous trends in an ironic or contrarian manner.
---
Toxic larrys has a bunch of cat meat pieces lying around.
---
And you chuckle a little when you are in the trade menu and you see ‚Äúrequested‚Äù pop up next to that Gatling Plasma.
---
First combat rifle isn‚Äôt the best, lever action is superior and to be effective you need to sneak because rifleman that get seen straight away are useless so don‚Äôt be them
---
How exhausting.
---
Awesome!
---
haven,t tried it yet.  Got it yesterday just before i had to log off and not I,m working till wednesday.  5uck5 to be me.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve found running heavy metal chest and 3 limbs plus 1 heavy leather limb gave me a great DR/ER combo
---
We may also receive a way not modify our current Legendary items not by re-rolling but by adding effects. Remember that we can currently see a couple instances of 4-star Legendaries and we have room already for 5 stars in the item description. Maybe the LV will allow us to add stars via mods or some random system. 
---
Then I could have a 3* Lever with two useless effects become a 4* Lever with three useless effects!
---
Glad you have a job.  That‚Äôs never a bad thing.  I‚Äôm hunting for my next one.
---
I do the responder thing. Find low levels and get them kitted out in quality gear. Give them meds, food, and water
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping.  Unfortunately busy weekend with no time for fo76 üòÇüòÇ
---
Bumping thread for visibility.
---
I disagree, it burns ammo fast but I would rate it as the best heavy gun (with all things being equal such as legendary effects)
---
All good thanks, these robots inside are harder than I though at level 40 with no good weapons lol
---
Watch out for Berkeley County, specifically Martinsburg area. It's like raider city-they love their drugs, theieving, harming each other, even trying to steal kids..
---
Let‚Äôs be honest here, bud. If they released it sooner and it had bugs or exploits you‚Äôd be saying they should have held off on them until they were ready.
---
Well i use a legendary variant but i will say it's the least used defiantly , and the hardest to find
---
#america
---
Thats pretty cool. I was helped out aroubd lvl45 myself. Got me over the 50 hump. Happily lvl152 now. Players like you that help low levels out are awesome.
---
welcome to reddit.... if you mock the subreddit you will be downvoted -.-
---
Cool! Gonna hop on soon. Im very low,  line level 10 Haha I should have mentioned that in my post.
---
The old classic.  Middle finger. üñï When people do stupid stuff or act like a-holes.
---
Stats on the Bloody Power Fist?
---
Search whoopsies and find the post from about 7 days ago on here.
---
I will agree it is much rarer than the others
---
all good we're just going through quests, refining character builds and building new camps ... more than welcome to join
---
I'm going to rebuild my camp this weekend somewhere in the forest. Want to build a responder trade center. I'm going to offer crafting services too. Pretty stoked for player vending tbh.
---
Like in Fallout 4 when I can only progress through any conversations / the story one way. That's fun.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what whining is. Going on and on about something. Why does it need ‚Äòrecapping‚Äô?
---
Yea i cant wait for that. Loli have 3 mules about to be useless here once tge legendary shows up lol
---
Wish they had faction camp stuff you could buy or find.
---
I find these both all the time and hate using both of them so I scrap them. I should read these posts more often.
---
Thx
---
I love those drops that are amazing and fit your build. Vamps is a great effect, too.
---
Pop Berry Mentats
---
Try a few different weapons. I remember having this quest and it just not working
---
What skin are you talking about
---
I was thinking that it would change for players lvl50 and up...
---
with laser gat you use fusion cores i have to farm the power plants pretty consistant to keep up. the damage per shot is low but the rate of fire puts out really good dps.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/9Nv6LMo
---
I'm not sure what you mean, but you can check the sub regularly.  People are good about posting that stuff .
---
i dont know but we need it. endgame especially gets dull and grindy and predictable. i think a random bit of chaos would make the world more alive
---
Thats probably not released yet
---
Those aren't really vampiric, they just replace your blood with fusion cores.
---
My favorite on my heavy is a vamp explosive flamer.  You guys and your ammo crafting stories are cute. 
---
More and more I find at boss fights I'm using a limb damage cryolator to keep the SBQ or shamsquatch pinned.
---
go to misc, sort by weight, get rid of your gunpowder and ore.  dont feel bad misc get missed alot.
---
Depends what you‚Äôre risking while overencumbered. You drop all junk and a whole lot of aid items if you die in survival. If you‚Äôre just toting 400lbs of legendary gear while waiting for Tuesday but no junk and minimal aid stuff, you‚Äôll be okay.
---
Good thing serums are really cheap to buy off other players. You could buy every mutation you want for the cost of one in game.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not released. That‚Äôs the point of my post I don‚Äôt want to miss it but I can‚Äôt log on every day for a month
---
Nice! I saw that and didn't realize what it was. Again your best bet is to check the sub.
---
Yeah, there's nothing in there. I've stashed everything but notes that weigh nothing.
---
This subreddit is pathetic. "REEEEEEEE a different opinion!!!!" 
---
I know some toxic NV fans, but they are nowhere near close to the level of r/circlejerk as this subreddit.
---
If you're an actual fan of Fallout or even 76, you'd use criticism to improve the game. Downvote me to hell for stating the obvious. 
---
Honestly, just rename it to r/rust
---
-cries lemonade tears-
---
Just log on every Tuesday when the atom shop refreshes
---
It will probably on the shop for more than one day, might even stay after its released
---
You definitely level faster, especially if you work the map by taking workshops‚Äîwhich give you fast travel points across the map and extra XP. Just build a quick scrap bench, stash box and bed at each workshop so you can get in and out quick. 
---
If you avoid the train stations and don‚Äôt hang around your workshops you‚Äôll avoid PvP for the most part. If you keep your junk stashed and carry minimal aid the occasional PvP interaction is inconsequential.
---
Everyone saying they have trouble finding the MG42, go dig up 15 treasure maps. You'll get one.
---
There is a lot of potential for abuse there.  I guarantee you there will be a lot of holotapes that are just filled with
---
It's 20 hours. Not sure if that depends on when you used the vendor last or if it's a set time each day.
---
Ok this is what I was looking for. Thanks for the advice. If I check every Tuesday I should catch it
---
Some things you don't expect still have weight. Literally take off every item of clothing, every weapon, every bit of ammo, junk, every holo, every note, everything. 
---
Then you can start adding back and see what you're missing. If you're able to get down to literally zero items and still have a weight bug, post it here and tag one of the devs after putting in a ticket
---
Did you try installing better inventory to see where the weight is coming from?
---
Maybe the perk cards are bugged for you? I did notice something cool the other day , playing a new character . I made a rifleman, decided to try out a fixer . I happened to be wearing stand fast and one piece of chameleon armor. I was sneaking past enemies all day . Like skyrim sneak lvl 100 fully perked . Getting sneak attacks at point blank range in wide open daylight.
---
What‚Äôs your psn? I‚Äôll add you and join right now
---
Yep. I did this. 
---
Literally everything I could put in my stash I did. The only things remaining are notes and holotapes that I can't stash, and they all say 0 weight.
---
Completely nude, yet still 30 weight.
---
Oh alright, thank you!
---
At what point does something like this become old news and irrelevant?  Do people go into the No Man‚Äôs Sky reddit and still bash the release of that game?  Seems like the horse is dead and buried and it bugs some people they didn‚Äôt get a few more whacks in.
---
asl?
---
lol scientists actually suggested that it‚Äôs possible that the world we are living in is a simulation (like The Matrix), if that‚Äôs the case we vault dwellers are merely spending time in a simulation inside a simulation. There‚Äôs a lot of 0s and 1s and what we think is real might not exist.
---
Stash the holos and notes too, it's easy to miss things. Then if that's still the case, post pictures as stated.
---
classic bugthesda... you can't really do anything about other than server hop
---
Thanks, 
---
Psn: BrutusCaitChris
---
All right. So I have been playibg sonce beta. Maybe not always with crazy high intensity but still since beta... I have yet to get a single one BOS skin for the T-60 and you managed to get all of them? Also where dod ypu get the money from to buy all those recipies for the serums? Jeez.
---
Did Todd sign it?
---
The beam splitter is what you‚Äôre not adding in. Exp gatling plasma is a cheap Anti aircraft gun, while the laser focuses all shots into 1 with damage stacking for each beam while aiming.
---
this is not the first time I read a report like this. a couple months after the game came out, a few people logged in only to find their characters missing and some randoms in their place. as if they had logged into someone else's account.
---
considering the game eat your items, I wouldn't say this is so unbelievable. the game **is** a buggy mess.
---
Maybe they could come up with some kind of rating system for game content.  Like they could recommend this game be for adults (lets say over 17 just to pick a number) and then we wouldn't have to worry about bad words and scary monsters.
---
I always build on cliffs so that I can move camps if someone is griefing me, and they fall to their dooms
---
This works for me when I get this quest. If you can, go to Watoga if the bots are friendly to you, strip off all armor and perk cards then drink. Next go into sneak and sneak up to a bot an land an unarmed attack.  This works for me every time. Hopefully you are far enough along that this helps.
---
If you stand still for a few seconds, you'll automatically lower your weapon and it'll stay lowered until you aim down your sights or start shooting. They just need to lower the timer for when that happens to like, two seconds... and make it work that way in first-person if it doesn't already, I actually don't remember.
---
haha, this good.
---
I have a two shot mg42. I primed it because you get 4x ammo than regular .308 when crafting them,and it shreds enemies like a lumberjack saw.
---
 I only use it for queen battles,it does over 80 damage per bullet at full hp and with no heavy gun perks.
---
He's right about the shit launch, but it's improved a lot, and is continuing to improve.
---
We know what was wrong, what is still wrong. But at least what small dev team likely remains is trying their hardest to give us a better game.
---
I think a lot more interesting criticism video could focus on the big behind the scenes decisions that flawed the game from the start. 
---
First off, it was outsourced to BGS Austin, formerly an indy developer under a different name. Zero experience handling AAA titles.
---
Second, has anyone compared the size of the Fo4 dev team to the 76 team? I'd be willing to bet its a whole lot smaller, with way fewer tester credits.
---
Third, the big wigs at BGS almost assuredly rushed the game to release before christmas... it needed another 6 months of cooking time. It should have released... around now.
---
In concept I think the game is quite sound. Though they could have done a better job making clear to people that this wouldn't have NPC's. I met a lot of confused people early on...
---
Instanced dungeons with NPC's and quest givers could have been nice. That way you get around the lines waiting for quest givers, but also retain that sense of agency from previous fallout games. With the coming opening of the vaults... this could actually still happen.
---
There's a lot of room for the game to grow, and I think taking cheap shots at the bugs and other low hanging fruit (patch fuck-ups) is just reductive and redundant at this point.
---
Yet something keeps us playing, and keeps us in this sub... there's a good game in here somewhere. Environmental storytelling, best coop play I've seen in years. Amazing visual design despite the dated engine and graphics... although I argue not that dated for current gen consoles...
---
Thats it. Thats my feelings on the game. If you hate it, leave.
---
Mirekurk queen spawn, they have a very small chance to infect you. Kill the queen then let the babies bite you
---
It's the Internet historian he's cover stories like this all the time, why are you crying? Lmao
---
You can already lower your weapons... You just have to pull them out and wait.
---
I‚Äôve had both happen to me
---
It was in the trailer of the game
---
In case I'm not whooshing it means age sex location. It was used in old chatrooms to find people pretending to be young females near you
---
I never thought about priming it , what does it take to make ultracite ammo and how much do u get without ammosmith
---
Godwin's law strikes again, congrats dude
---
That‚Äôs gorgeous! Well done!
---
I don‚Äôt use any junkies and stalkers in my stash (mules are carrying them for stars) and I don‚Äôt use wood armors yet I get shit tons of those garbage. No it‚Äôs likely not related to what you use, if that server you‚Äôre playing on has a crappy loot pool, you can steady drop of crap.
---
He says in the video he is whining. What are you trying to defend?
---
The BoS paints come from the Technical Data and collecting caps is easy if you google caps run you can find a lot of the cap stash locations. Also, I‚Äôve got about 650 hours in. :)
---
Dude, it was literally in the trailer of the game
---
Because most of the people outside of this community do not know about it. Also it made for a good topic to make a video on given the channel's nature, didn't see you complaining about a video made on planking, only when it goes against your precious fallout.
---
u/TiptheRat posted a guide to hunting Technical Data.  I strongly advise you to read it.  It explains the drops and best hunting techniques.  Taught me a lot about the game mechanics in general.  I‚Äôve been hunting the BOS paint as well and finally got the Knight paint.
---
Oh really? I didn't realize. I always holster my weapons when moving.
---
Why are you all so sensitive over a game? üòÇ Holy fuck I've got the power armour edition and still think it's funny
---
I've played as a trapper, raider, trader, farmer, scavenger, BOS soldier.
---
I'm currently back at the raider play style even though I won't grief because that would be weak.
---
Maybe this was already answered but is the prime receiver worth the cost of crafting ammo for it ?
---
Maps in the Bog and Mire
---
Your post just got me thinking:
---
there def should be a ‚Äúgambit destiny 2‚Äù type mode where there should be a race to take down some Hiller spongey legendary creature in a certain area and the first person to do it unlocks pvp and allows you to start fighting everyone around you. Maybe pvp is locked until the mob dies then it‚Äôs a free for all after it dies and everyone can start damaging each other again. Or the person who gets the final hit gets some kind of damage reduction bonus before the free for all begins
---
Thats cool. What kind of raiding do you do? Also..what does a trapper do
---
I'll play, GT: McChicken888888
---
WRONG THINK REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I was searching around for this and I think they've changed it. Corn soup doesn't do anything for hunger anymore. Is there something else that works for both?
---
Ammo expenditure is really not a big deal. You can make 180 5mm and 50 cal bullets with the ammosmith perm, in addition to bonuses from super duper. 
---
For materials, i mine iron and lead with excavator armor. Search for "Miner mike's guide to ammo crafting" on reddit for his main mining points.
---
I'll be on in an hour or so. GT knucklessyrup
---
This video is spouting off the same bullshit we have all heard and know. Why do we need to see, hear, or talk about it yet again? The conversation is a trunk full of ping pong balls it contributes nothing and changes nothing. It is pointless.
---
Gt: we r arsons
---
I sold my 3* handmade accidentally to a vendor I nearly cried luckily I came out of trade went back in and was able to buy it back.
---
The Minutemen congradulate you, son!
---
ok that was what I thought it meant but then the comment doesn‚Äôt make sense?
---
Better than my explosive hunting rifle. The only explosive gun I've found.
---
&gt;   Do people go into the No Man‚Äôs Sky reddit and still bash the release of that game? 
---
Whenever a new free, big update of NMS comes out, you still see people pop up and yell "SEAN LIED!" every now and then.
---
...so, kinda?
---
Because he's covered stuff on habo hotel and planking, he covers stuff that were a trend on the Internet, stop crying
---
Well... I am more around 200 hours I guess. I know about the technical data and I have dropped loads of those. Still no plans.
---
Poison is so heavily underutilized and I think that's a shame. It makes poison armor effects basically useless and takes away an interesting pvp element. At least they are using it some more with the new sheepsquatch weapons.
---
https://imgur.com/a/ibN2BYH
---
There's my inventory on the left, I've screenshotted everything that's in there.
---
Everything currently there I cannot stash.
---
Yet you'll still see I have 30 weight.
---
Don't get me wrong. Definitely interested in something like this. Just difficult to implement. 
---
What I'm hoping for is that new dlc "Nuclear Winter". Will have At least some of those aspects and it's probably going to be a separate mode, like survival and adventure.
---
Lol these comments are all 
---
&gt;*"Anyone that says anything bad about the game I stan and the company I fanboy for is a hack/ whining/ desperate for clicks"*
---
I think it's less about differing opinions and more about the horse being dead, eaten, shat back on the ground and beaten again.
---
Forgetting what they did to the community is pointless. 
---
You need to be critical, especially when it's a game you like. Repair kits are the first official "Pay 2 win" item. 
---
Is there a huge backlash? Nope. Any backlash is met with downvotes, because Fo76 is God's game, and it's perfect in any way.
---
And then when guns and other bigger p2w items come in (which is likely, seeing the lootbox system that is planned coming soon), the entire subreddit will be like
---
*Insert shocked Pikachu face*
---
It‚Äôs 20 hours from the time you first sell to a vendor that has reset. You can return and interact with that vendor as you like but its caps won‚Äôt reset until 20 hours from that first sell.

Dlc's should work. How I did it for my brother was log in as myself and dl them. He can still access the dlcs even if my acct isnt signed in. Things bought with in game currency isn't transferable tho.
---
Thanks will give it a try!
---
That sheepsquatch poster is awesome
---
At this point I'm willing to believe any bizzaro strangeness from the game, I've lost legendary stuff myself. And I do remember login issues and 2fa requests. But this sub is subject to the worst kinds of trollers, and it is getting harder to separate out the real. Post history tells alot, and apparently the trolls now have a way around the minimum age and karma requirements.  
---
I've put up with a lot from this game, I've suffered, lost, and walked away a few times. It sucks that trolls have made it worse to actually get help. I try my best to contribute to work arounds and bug reporting.  There are real people out there, just trying to enjoy something.

Ultracite ammo require the same amount of lead and steel, plus 1 ultracite and 1 stable flux. In case of .308 it's fluorescent,which is easily farmed at whitespring nuke( i get usually 10 x run). But with ammo smith ultracite .308 gives you 48 bullets instead of the normal 21.
---
Since gauss actually fires a physical projectile, it should still have an explosive version. But Tesla just shoots a burst of electric arc, so they removed explosive from it a while back.
---
Wow what a great quip.  All people homeschooled people are sheltered idiots.  I have a Master's degree btw, and it was just a simple  question.  Im pretty sure everyone knows the conotations to both those numbers,  so please inform me oh guru of current interweb trends and naming conventions.   How are they ironic?
---
Its explosive
---
Thank you, sir!
---
Yeah, I think they took initiate out of the game (rumored) and you need that before you can get the others. But it literally took me 200+ Technical Data to get them all.
---
Didn't even mention half the positive things about the game.
---
Took context out of  a lot of stories. (cheater ones for example)
---
Undervalued the enormous bug fixes and stabilty improvements to the game. 
---
Takes the zero score metacritic reviews seriously.
---
Showcases boogie and quartering who are just massive piles of shits. Yongyea too but Idk if he is  a bad person or just a bad content maker.
---
There's no source on sales numbers, just shows misleading stuff.
---
Player numbers arent dwindling.
---
Not once does he mention atoms can easily be aquired by playing the game.
---
Shows a guy with a lgbt, metoo fedora while talking about mods of forums and reddit. O K
---
I dont mean to disrespect his content making, he seems talented. But there is a lot of bogus in this video.
---
Internet Historian seems to be browsing this sub. So, he hopefully sees this.
---
Oh wow i remember this issue from release. I heard it had something to do with picking up fragmentation grenades from super mutants that weren't real. They would add the weight but then disappear from your inventory. 
---
I dont think that glitch is an issue anymore. The only immediate work around is to make a new character. Your old one will likely have that ghost weight issue till beth does something about it.
---
Just did this a few days ago. Get the Mirelurk Queen to low health and she may spawn diseased baby Mirelurks which will attack you. You stand there and let them bite you and hope one of them gives you the disease. We had to do it three times to catch Whoopsies.
---
I have 3 main characters. 
---
One I call Blue, run all vault tech colors. I run more like best and brightest ideal there. I tank and do a lot of area damage to control adds, and will help lowbies farm xp by pulling aggro with all the auras and area damage if I run across them. Or anyone doing xp grind, auras make it so I auto tag so there is no compete issues.
---
One i wear a responder jump suit on. That one is rich with chems and food. Melee so generally smash things (chems and food are for the psychoxxx and liquor mostly) and runs high ish CHA. Happy to share food, etc. when I see low levels. Distributes molotovs frequently for lowbies to tag since a good melee is one shotting most of the time. Also since melee is cheap and easy, this guy can buy and craft expensive recipes and plans, so he does. The one above is constantly making explosives, the one below fuel and cryo cells.
---
One I wear a firebreather kit. I also run light on chems / food but keep an open fully built camp. Flamers, cryo, other heavy and melee (melee mostly general pve, heavy for boss and events). This one is most adaptable, has the most gear. Will also use the flamer on group events so as to share xp.
---
All, of course, put damage downrange themselves. I view this game as having a few core modes.
---
- general pve alone
---
- pve with a group
---
- pve boss or large events
---
- pvp / survival 
---
Those first three are built with the first three on that list.
---
My 4th character is built for that fourth ... and generally doesnt help so much but may shadow low levels and poach people stalking them.
---
P90!
---
Yes, it's beaten to a pulp. You'd think that people would be able to joke about the past. 
---
We all laugh at the bugs in every fallout game. We laugh at the sometimes bad launches, the bad story etc. But when it comes to 76, especially on the 76 subreddit, it seems like people are not okay with that and try to stan the game harder than a teenage boy's erection when he sees a bikini ad on tv.
---
Just invited you to a party. I'm gonna start a party.
---
Ah i see, thanks.
---
at a point when a looter-shooter eats your items and nothing is done about it, I don't think it matters whether people are trolling or not. he could be lying, sure, but does it even matter at this point?
---
and I've submitted countless bug reports myself as well. then I realized they were all but ignored and probably went straight to the bin.
---
that has been happening to me often lately. It usually makes me laugh as it is like my character is back in the 70's on the disco floor.   
---
\*Insert Staying Alive pose here\*
---
I thought the Anti-Deathclaw Round was real :( oh well, back to running away and taking pop shots!
---
dont like the vieo? then move on
---
you cant even follow your own advice
---
plus this video will help future consumers on whether they want the next fallout or bethesda game. Its not just whining just because you deem it so
---
This is soo tantalizing. So much want. So much lost.
---
Treasure maps. Still an ultra rare drop. I‚Äôve done hundreds and only gotten one or two of each type.
---
wat? Planking?
---
What I don't want to support is anti-consumer practices as well as practices that needlessly destroy art.
---
I don't think you get the analogy. What I'm trying to say is that previous works of art don't need to be destroyed to pave the way for new pieces of art. Solaris (1971) and Stalker (1979) are two films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Both are valuable pieces of art in their own right, notice how we didn't have to destroy every copy of Solaris before Tarkovsky made Stalker.
---
Lol why are you so upset that someone doesn‚Äôt like it..
---
Less pvp and more surprise gank.
---
There rather easy to find if you spam the requisition drops with a few friends in some of the late game areas
---
Lol
---
The higher the rank the better the insignia and the colors change a bit. You‚Äôd have to google it to see em.
---
So,  a two shot Freezing Handmade?
---
That would be *puts on sunglasses*. Cool
---
You know the even more out of date thing of just lying down impersonating a plank. It is an exercise but people just ran with it to do some dumb stuff.
---
Because let's be honest you haven't even watched it, you've just dismissed it as whining which makes your opinion irrelevant
---
What a time to be alive when asking for your product to not intentionally be destroyed by its creator is a strange demand.
---
Yeah, and that‚Äôs relevant how? Never mind kid, I don‚Äôt actually care..
---
Well thought out for sure. I only use 2..a pve and pvp character. But just started buildibf my pvp..so low level and minimal gear rn.
---
Cant you holster by holding square on ps4? Like turning on your light?
---
A BRB would be good for a short AFK, as you said. 
---
I‚Äôd also like a Thank You alternative to the Heart which still feels odd in many situations where I just want to say Thanks. 
---
Good Trade is something I would use if the animation were appropriate and amusing. 
---
Whew! For when we‚Äôve survived a tough fight together. 
---
Palm smacking forehead: or something that says, hmm, another 1* wood leg from a 3* Legendary mob.
---
I'm friendly in adventure mode but I fully act like a raider in PVP. I often hide somewhere to ambush unsuspecting vault dwellers and other wastelanders. I must say that my ambushes often fail thanks to the use of chems and booze.. 
---
The trapper is almost the same as the raider except they are actually insane. My trapper is also an cannibal, so he wil eat other players beside looting them of their valuables (junk and meds).
---
I‚Äôve never seen a cavalier piece until today when I got a cavalier raider right arm with +1 strength and -8% damage from players
---
There's definitely a lot of fans out here who would seemingly let Bethesda executives plough their partners if it meant getting some Atom. 
---
I mean I'd say I'm a Bethesda fan boy to an extent but I'm also not an idiot who thinks it's acceptable to buy a product that will inevitably be destroyed.
---
Mostly genetics and diet. It's all those sugar bombs and cram.
---
He just wants to make people laugh...
---
invited to game and party. Please join.
---
You were questioning why people go on and on about something, yet you only have an issue when its about something you like. You formed your point on questioning why things need recapping, but it doesn't seem like that's the issue, just that you're getting defensive about your precious game.
---
That makes much more sense than what i came with which was "American sign language"
---
They nerfing explosive again.  Sorry.
---
Hahaha thats hardcore. I was hoping you had some kind of animal/hunter grind. Thatd be sick. Not totally useful thouvh lol
---
The combat rifle is pretty shit to be honest so is all other fallout 4 weapons like the assault rifle and combat shotgun, the best automatic and single action are the hand made which is rare and the lever action
---
I think it does matter. A few weeks of no one believing in the disappeared legendaries shows the damage that can be done by trolls.
---
Hes is internet *Historian*
---
try reading next time
---
No, I haven‚Äôt watched it. I don‚Äôt need to. I‚Äôve been playing since beta. I know about all the stuff that was wrong with the game, all the shit Beth did wrong, etc etc etc.
---
566 hours in now. Enjoy it now as much as I did in the beta days. Things have improved, some things can still be improved. Just don‚Äôt see the point in making a video to recap what happened back then. It‚Äôs a computer game, not some major historical event in mankind‚Äôs past.
---
But it‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll leave you guys too it, I‚Äôm not looking to convince anyone and you guys aren‚Äôt going to convince me.
---
Bethesda is an example of greedy capitalism that destroyed the Fallout world in 2077
---
It's YOU'RE you ignorant fucking twat.
---
Ok. Thanks. I have the handmade plan.  And am saving for lever action now
---
Not really mate, but it‚Äôs ok, this whole conversation is pointless. Like the video. Have a good day.
---
Why does the dev room even exist?
---
I‚Äôm not on at the moment. I‚Äôll be on a little later tonight
---
Yes this is a fantastic way to make caps. I do this to people but I'm very selective over it. I only do this to people over level 100 and only if they are at ammo factory. I figure anyone over 100 knows it's a risk to grab the ammo place. I also only kill the person once and then I'll leave the workshop unless they seek revenge. Then I'll stay until they stop seeking revenge
---
Conversations are usually pointless if one person is making points and the other is just making unsubstantiated claims.
---
Thank you! This was driving me nuts. I must have taken 20 photos around the university grounds there, but this is what worked.
---
Are the copies for sale also spiral bound?
---
I'm not saying they need to support it forever, I'm just asking for tools or at the bare minimum some instructions for the community to support it after they end official support. That would satisfy both the ethical and legal requirements.
---
Wow you really can‚Äôt deal with it when people don‚Äôt agree with you, huh.. don‚Äôt get your knickers in a twist. It‚Äôs just a game. Bye.
---
doesnt excuse him to mislead?
---
I've seen it be effective before.  Annoying but helpful.
---
I got marsupial by chance a couple of days ago.
---
Gotcha, thank you!

Im running like this:

---
With Unyielding armor Barbarian and Evasive gives their full damage ressistances (80DR - /45DR/45ER) 
---
Serendipity, Ironclad, Lone Wanderer and Nerd-rage makes you a whole lot tougher. 
---
Its always walking a thin line with a low-health build but you can be a little tougher than a regular glass-canon. I dont run stealth, simply dont have the patience on a melee build and i rarely die, and when I do its usually because i was'nt paying enough attention to managing my rads...
---
Ultracite isn't that good anyway. Go grind for T-51b if you need armor, its better than Ultracite. You can also name your chassis.
---
you mean months. that's been happening since release and nobody cared.
---
and it wasn't the "trolls", reports of disappearing items, trolling or not, have always been real. the problem are the paranoid, scrutinizing and overly protective members of this sub. say anything slightly critic about Fo76 and everybody goes DISSENT!
---
every claim should be checked when a game is this buggy, no matter how absurd, not downvoted to hell because "Juicehead is out to get Todd"
---
She's worthy of ***ALL*** the swag
---
..would explain why I feel I've been rebooted after a hard drive wipe on Saturday morning..
---
What? I was just having a discussion, I actually enjoy disagreements as you can have meaningful discussion about it. I was just saying that I was making points, you were just saying 'no,' without really explaining why. Now you are just trying to paint it as some butt hurt guy that can't handle disagreement, jeez.
---
[Damn these big bones](https://i.imgur.com/nwMRsVo.jpg)

(Old screenshot from the power armor bug lol)
---
Ok I have a war I gotta get too I'll be off and then get on at 6pm
---
Not my fault that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre coming across. Go on, have the last word, I get the feeling you need it. I won‚Äôt reply.
---
I had a player that wanted 70K+ Caps for a full set of Assassins/unyielded armor
---
What, again? That‚Äôs the second one today. How many videos can this guy do about F76? Where does he find the time?
---
It‚Äôs heavy weapons‚Äô fast and near non-stop delivery of damage make them shine. Fully specced TSE lever action will do more damage per shot, but by the time you fired five rounds your buddy fired 50 shots of 50 cal. It‚Äôs totally different play style. If you want to take advantage of the sneak perks (which is a huge boost) you go sneaky rifleman, but if you want to kill the bosses loud and fast, go heavy.
---
Exactly! I use a beer bowl.
---
I just named my guy Bruce, so I can change whenever I want
---
that part was an old computer joke :)
---
but ya, if you're sneaking you fall off the map..but I didn't know you fell off the compass as well
---
Yeah, I've opened a support ticket about it, hopefully it gets fixed.
---
Was ready to get back on and give 76 another try now that a few months have passed, but don't really want to re-do all the questing and things I already did on my main.
---
Dude. Lol. You've been told multiple times to remove literally everything. 
---
It's incredibly easy to miss things. If everything in the left has no weight it shouldn't be hard to spend the two minutes to move everything possible to the stash too. 
---
Then go through every item type and make sure you don't have any mission locked items or items holding weight you didn't expect. 
---
Plans/recipes and gunpowder are usually big things people forget. But there's also some random mission items that get locked to the player and can't be removed until quest is completed that have weight.
---
What are they gonna do with 70k caps? I can‚Äôt even spend the 6000 or so caps I currently have in game..
---
You're not bad tbf, whether I reply or not, I am painted negatively due to your last comment, but I don't really care. Because if anyone with sense reads it they can see its not true, you are the one that kept saying 'bye' because the conversation is 'pointless,' but still cared enough to reply 3 more times...
---
Oh was this already posted today? It wasn't in my "hot" section. Just thought other dudes that like 76 would find it as funny as i did and i wanted to share with you guys
---
F's in the thread for u/quaddamage08.  We know why.
---
Jesus christ dude, I get it remove everything. I've also stated multiple times that the remaining things I CANNOT remove. They're tied to quests or something and cannot be dropped or stashed.
---
He's an entertainiment channel. F76 came a lonf way since then, but you can't deny the first 2 months were a shitfest
---
people have been doing that forever now. TSEs have been duped to hell and used to be dirt cheap, like 2K caps per, but have been slowly rising again.
---
you should consider yourself lucky someone is even willing to sell you one for caps. most 2 and 3 stars are trade only.
---
I watched the entire video with the **"Tell me Lies, Sweet Little Lies"** on the back of my head
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a whole other thread on this. I only know because I dared not like it and that brought out all the bethaters and trolls :)
---
I've noticed certain enemies find you easier. If a 3* spawns I always get insta detected. Same with literally any enemy that can burrow underground
---
He wasn't misleading anyone üòÇ

Alcohol is the "key" to happiness. Waka waka! (Won't blame the downvotes ü§£)
---
I don't have a banjo, but I sit on my second floor, playing my tuba, and watching my floors and walls clip.
---
I make booze in the woods. And drink it. And sometimes I shoot this weird plant monster that shows up with my shotgun.
---
Yea I was disappointed by how lazy it seems this is the guy who thinks that balloon boy wasn't a hoax cause he looked deeper but he didn't seem to bother this time for some reasons
---
pretty sure it only applies to 3rd person. but other will probably see you doing it regardless.
---
but sometimes it bugs out and never happens.
---
Lol, i get it. I love 76 and Internet historians videos so it was a cool clash of worlds for me.
---
I just equip the perk card that fixes items at 160%. No pure intelligence boost.
---
I'll be on at 5 CST
---
Why you post that shit here‚Äôs?
---
I love 76, but this is just too good
---
Have to admit, never watched any of them, but then I‚Äôm not the right demographic for YouTubers ;)
---
there's gonna be a lot of pruney fingers :)
---
he always shows up while I'm sneaking in places with heavy security. but I never have the heart to shoot him.
---
Your opinion. I love the game and there's lots more who do.
---
I saw someone the other day sell a tse handmade for 20k, even though that was the most duped weapon in the game
---
At PAX they talked about how they saw Fallout 76 as a sort of Fallout platform that will iterate and evolve over a period of years. In all likelihood, the game won‚Äôt be the same in a year as it is right now, and different again a year after that and a year after that. Theoretically, it will attract new players with every major iteration. 
---
My impression (and I certainly could be wrong) is that after a while, I won‚Äôt be able to go back and do the things I did when the game was new, because the world is going to change as time progresses. 
---
Is it really going to be 10/23/2102 forever? How many times are we going to end the Scorchbeast Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúReign of terror‚Äù? Eventually, the world in the game needs to move on and change, bringing new quests, characters, environments etc. 
---
All this means that even if the game is supported forever, it‚Äôs going to constantly change. That‚Äôs a different experience than say, Fallout 3, where I can put the game in and get exactly the same experience I always had. 
---
Personally, I see value in both experiences, they can each offer things the other cannot. But I can totally see how that evolutionary approach might not be appealing to everyone.
---
Don't spend more than 10k on any weapon... Only go past that value for some legacy energy TSE.
---
Everything else is overpriced nowadays.
---
&gt;I know there's nothing Bethesda can do about that part of the community... nor should they
---
Actually the 10% fee is a way to combat inflation and make prices go down. Bethesda is aware of the insanely overpriced things. I really hope they'll add more caps sinks to stabilize the prices even more.
---
I don't have and i'll never own any mules. It's a freaking game not a job, i'm not trying to be the richest bestest or whatever in Fallout76. I just want to have fun.  Luckily for me i'm having fun with my less than god tier weapons. Then there's that thingy, when you have everything you could ever want, you'll get bored so i'm not rushing towards getting god tier gear.
---
I agree its a mess right now. Some blame it on inflation as the value of caps has become low for market traders, hence why prices there have become so high. 
---
It doesnt help that there are still swaths of people from the duping era with hundreds of thousands of caps and duplicated weapons influencing these price points.
---
Unfortunately at the present time you just have to save caps to purchase the items ur looking for, or go for trades. I always recommend a middle man just to avoid a potential scammer.
---
For what??? I could see 70k or the set of armor but both???
---
You can also check bethesda's site for [articles on new atomic shop additions](https://bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-new-items-and-sales), they make these regularly and you'll know what to expect and when.
---
It wont fix im on PC BTW
---
I feel like a "sorry" emotion could be useful for when you accidentally blow up a car next to another player or forget you have pacifist turned off.
---
Also a "no thank you" emote for us lone wanderers that prefer to not team up with other players.
---
Any criticism will be downvoted into obscurity, and so will this comment, but I don't much care about that anymore. I think the game is heavily disappointing due to its flawed design, lacking world and features and the disrespectful business practices associated with it, most notably the microtransactions and how blatantly the leveling system is meant to encourage more gambling from players in the future. 76 and Blades are both concerning windows into what Bethesda thinks their games should be.
---
Purveyor gonna be buying all that lock pick/ breath under water armor like........"I'll see y'all next week".
---
If you haven't already, try to mod some of your armors to lighter/ultra light weight and weapons to their lightest. This should help with some of the stash weight.
---
Don't know why are you being downvoted. Probably should've marked it as /s
---
I was just sexually harassed by some asshole and his buddy. I blocked them and jumped servers and forgot to write down his name. now thinking about it i'm supper pissed he should be reported he and his buddy Jeff are running around harassing people its just wrong.

2 most significant changes since start was- pus-to-talk button and respec option

Get the poster framed ASAP, that is a true collector's item!
---
Get fucked, Commie
---
So with the ghoul how much? Ive been told 3k
---
They're pretty funny. Usually about full on disasters. 76 isn't as bad as what he usually covers but it just had a lot of little snafus so it was easy to pad out video time. 76s rushed launch really has become legendary now.
---
I just use my instigating dragon, dont ever need a second shot usually
---
Robot
---
yeah. I thought it was misinformation, and although they can certainly be had for less, I can see TSEs going for 25K per again.
---
I guess people finally realized BE/FFF is not the end all. either that or they can't afford them. either way, TSEs are a fine option for most situations. definitely trumps regular weapons.
---
"I don't see why (insert thing) is being reviewed or expanded upon in any way! It's not like it's (insert thing that I view personally as significant)!"
---
Imagine thinking this is an MMO. It's really not.
---
Anything trumps regular weapons
---
Because this is the Fallout 76 subreddit.
---
Sentinel/assassin armor is completely broken. 
---
Sentinel armor is 15% damage resistant standing still so a full set is 75%. And Assassin  is 8% so a full set is an extra 40% damage resistant. So yeah this is a major problem in the game now.
---
Haha, I‚Äôve been called a fascist many times in my life, but never a commie. Thanks!
---
Yeah, just a shame that it‚Äôs putting people off from playing what is actually a really enjoyable game.. and I don‚Äôt think videos like this help.
---
Does the op have mods installed? This would be a good thing to look into.
---
I usually end up using the vomiting emote but I feel like it doesn't portray my contempt well enough. A middle finger would be excellent.
---
Is it weird that I actually do say "AHAA!" when they pop up? They're worth so little XP, but it's such a sense of accomplishment. Like a Radscorpion, but with less ouch.
---
&gt; implying you can't be both
---
Wires still have to be attached to them. I just learned this myself. They're essentially just used for a "cleaner" look. They're good for interior wired items. I used them around my pressure plates for the exit to my camp. Instead of droopy wires, I have the pipes along the wall and ceiling. If you're on ps4, you cant take a look at my camp. Sn Mantrayne.
---
There are no genders, you bigot! They‚Äôre a social construct.
---
If they're obtainable only through the dev room then why weren't they removed from inventories ?
---
Fallout 4 felt more aimless in its environments, but the quests themselves were where it was truly lacking. All the quests had very obvious, "do this to be right" solutions, while 3 and New Vegas offered many more opportunities for hard decision making on top of a greater variety of who would and wouldn't even survive the story depending on your actions.
---
Yes, New Vegas has a predetermined path at the start, but the game doesn't let that define it. Because of this, its replay value is through the roof. Fallout 4, meanwhile, has very little of value that can offer different results. Getting lost or getting good gear in the early stages of the game doesn't make that game good. The former means you're bad at navigation and the latter means the game is poorly balanced.
---
That‚Äôs nice, I would like a wipe but every time I rebooted I see all of my junks are still there intact!
---
I'll try that! Thanks a bunch:)
---
I'm glad he reminded me of what happened, since I just remembered I still haven't gotten my canvas bag.
---
The issue comes from rewards for killing being greater in adventure as opposed to survival. You get more caps per kill in adventure.
---
Sure, I would be fine with the evolutionary approach. But I'm not 100% confident that Fallout 76 is performing as well as they thought it might. It would be great if the game was supported forever, and I wouldn't have a problem with it if the game changed over time, because I'd still have access to the game. 
---
Call me a cynic (usually I'm far more optimistic) but I don't know if Fallout 76 will last forever or even the next five years. From both the perspective of a consumer and an artist the idea that the game might just become non-functional after a certain point is less than appealing. I don't want a product I spent $100 on to just stop working, it shouldn't matter how many hours I put into it before they pull the plug. I wouldn't buy a brand new car that was designed to explode after it drives 20, 000km. Why should it be different for a game.
---
Ratings cannot be enforced and most MMOs have to deal with shitty people in chat.  Creating something that is going to be impossible to regulate will create serious issues.  Don‚Äôt forget MMOs are great places to recruit angry lonely people to your ‚Äúcause‚Äù.

I'm on xbox. Was on 2 days ago, had a few, maybe 5, in the 3 hrs i played. I was never super active, so not sure how regular they should be
---
I have some 3 star weapons and armor I don't use in my stash I'd have been happy to offer up for it. I'm never going to get a mule character to carry caps for those situations though.üòÇ That seems absolutely ridiculous to me.

Kind of curious how anyone would play a hitman when slap damage is a thing.

I actually have some mine money from Sudbury Ontario, you gotta sell your soul to the company store!

I live in Austin and want to check out Bethesdas studio but idk if that's even a thing to do?

Heck yeah! Glad I could help
---
I didn't think you were an idiot before, but you're the one with the master's degree so I figure you can probably work out the answer for yourself.
---
I assumed homeschooling because you censored 666 and assumed only the primary connotation for usernames with those two numbers in them, which is pretty common among people brought up to believe their truth is the only truth and haven't had that concept challenged much.
---
I don't think homeschoolers generally are idiots, but I do think they are generally sheltered as that's often part of why their parents chose to home school.
---
Huh, he may have been equipped thus
---
Yeah, the negative press has probably cost us a lot of potential new players. But i really think beth is gonna no mans sky this, just way faster. It's already half way there. 76 is my favorite xbox game of all time now.
---
I‚Äôm not totally sure, but I think he meant ‚Äúals,‚Äù as in the degenerative muscle disease. Feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but that‚Äôs the best guess I could come up with.
---
I hope so, it‚Äôs the only game I‚Äôm playing atm.
---
Urgency and agency are very different things. True, your *character* has a lot of motivation to find their kid, but no one possibly relate to, "my child was abducted and nobody wants to help me". In 3 and New Vegas, the personal conflicts were much more grounded, and the player character had a lot more room for development and variation, meaning your *own* motivation was what drove you to complete quests and explore the world. Their themes even had some really solid moral lessons to take away, what with 3's theme of sacrifice and that of greed in New Vegas.

i think they got sent but i dont know for sure

Tbh caps are easy to come by now just sell bulked items at the whitesprings traiders
---
I got a email from there support late last week to confirm my mailing address for the bag. Also I still care I dropped $250 on that I better get the full value on it.
---
The cap ceiling needs to be raised and there needs to be more use in game for caps in order for the economy to balance out. It's hard to sell an item for even 15k caps when the buyer already has almost 20k. If there was a way to spend caps to redo raid quests or to upgrade a certain persistent camp item, items would sell for less as caps would be more useful and gain value.
---
Me too. And honestly I'm taking a break for a few days because i was getting a bit too obsessive and staying up too late. Never had that issue with any other game
---
&gt;Bozar

please no
---
waah waah waah don't use repair kits
---
A more polite ‚ÄúNo‚Äù would be great. Just because I‚Äôm not interested in trading or teaming up right now doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm bothered by the offer.
---
I love your Power Armor BTW absolutely awesome! üëç
---
Well it‚Äôs not overpriced as long as someone is willing to pay for it. If they are overpriced you‚Äôll see a quick drop in price, which hasn‚Äôt happened yet after the dupe removal and bans. There‚Äôs no cost associated in this in-game market, only supply and demand.
---
Pretty much. The bars are the wire and once it reaches where you need it, put a nipple thing at the end and run a normal wire to whatever needed power. Sorry, hard to explain. üòñ
---
Missile turrets all the way
---
Thank you so much!!!!
---
It seems cool at first. You really went all out with your journal. Why would you have sent them your hard work? Not for nothing, if they just so happen to take your ideas that took months and months to design, you will have no one to blame but yourself. Hope they dont try to finesse you.... Unless you already got hired...
---
&gt; Well the TSE nerf was significant too, but would you actually call it a step in right direction?
---
the game pretty much died for many people after the TSE nerf
---
On PS4 I‚Äôve been playing in unicorn land since two patches ago.

Gotta find some way to raid when the PVP system is broken.

BE and FFF don't really sell for caps anymore, just trades. I don't think it's a problem with the economy, those two are probably the most useful prefixes and work with pretty well any build. They are also sought after enough that people will give up Sentinel armor for them depending on the particular gun. TSE Handmades still sell for only 2-5k in most trading forums. They really are the most overrated weapon in the game.
---
No need to edit the post, most people are going to get what you say.  This kind of thread brings out the kind of people that were polarized by 76 and haven‚Äôt let go.  I‚Äôd go as far to say we‚Äôre only getting close to a release candidate for 76 by my standards, doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt enjoy the game, or think it had a flawless launch.  Not sure why some think there has to be only 2 sides to a discussion.  Plenty of room in the middle.
---
Molotovs for events. Kill and craft.

Check Ebay.... 2 weeks ago somebody made a bid  on full BOS armor set ....129 us dollars.. this is completely insane .....

Errr that doesn‚Äôt look amazing, that looks like Oreos and mint chips. The Garrahan and dusty skins look much better.
---
The camps are putrid and ugly. You can rot in a fissure site if you have a camp here. Build one on the east side, not a 5 min walk from the vault. Build one somewhere else. Move your ugly 2x2 wood box out of there.
---
I bought a tse handmade from the trainstation in whitespring right after the tse nerf. I sold it to my friend recently for... I don't remember actually üòÇ he offered me some caps and I said sure because I hardly used it. I can't imagine telling anyone any gun I have will cost them 20k caps... partially because I never have less than 5k caps on me to hit capacity and partially because it just seems ridiculous to me. The comment someone made about never paying more than 10k for anything I think is perfect. The signs and letters plan should be the most expensive thing in the game üòÇ
---
Or just text chat?
---
It might just be your Xbox if it‚Äôs old or newer

I got I'm good

It‚Äôs almost as if different people like different things. I think the garrahan suit looks exactly like dirty rusted dogshit

Level 50 attacked my humble abode out in bumfuck nowhere today, my camp is all the way out near the fair ground in the top left of the map, and the bloody creature spawned in the farm up that way. Took me and another dude several minutes and as many Gatling plasma cores and idk how many rifle rounds old mate spewed into it to finally drop. Loot was ok, couple level 50 weapons and some goat bits. I'd like to know why this creature exists and why it's just showing up now. I only recently completed the sheepsquatch quest so maybe that's it?
---
can't afford them = don't qualify for trades. it's kinda the same in this context, someone without several mules each carrying max caps probably doesn't have good 2/3\*s either.
---
and although someone with a BFFF handmade definitely has the edge over everyone else, a skilled player can make do with a regular one in survival. or just a 1\*, really.
---
Fallout 76 has the big gay

wholesome post
---
I feel this. I did a routine run of the AWOL armaments event and low and behold, the 3* gutsy dropped a anti-armor explosive .50 cal. I‚Äôm heavy guns/explosive on that character so I just about had a stroke when I saw that drop. Fallout 76 has all the high-highs and Low-lows haha

Caps are close to worthless. Anybody who has played for a while is looking for ways to get rid of caps so they don't hit the limit. Meanwhile, great combinations of 3* weapon effects are a one in a million chance at this point. Many level 100+ players have never even found an explosive weapon, much less a tse, and even less a tse weightless. That is not an unreasonable price for a god-roll. The value would most likely come from trading some high-value items like serum plans, sentinel armor, or other TSE weapons. Yes, bethesda should raise the cap limit, and yes, bethesda should have launched the game with the ability to trade item-for-item instead of forcing people into a risky scenario where they can get scammed
---
That said, I'm hoping when the guy says he sells all his 3* for 30k-40k, he's only dealing with god rolls. If this lad is selling a nocturnal fire rate +1 perception pipe gun for 30k....
---
You don't get what I said at all. This is a game made with digital technology with computer codes. This is not an old movie. Art in this game can be easily replicated in newer games with new engines and new polygons, thus there is nothing about artistic value that is being erased or lost. If you don't understand the process in game making, get a book about computer and games to learn more before saying nonsense about whatever anti-consumer or whatever art destroyer. I think you are trolling.
---
most Events require a player to trigger them.
---
If a server population is concentrated in one area of the map there will only be a few active, and they will likely end quickly, which combined with lengthy cooldowns means you won't see many at all. If the server is spread over the whole map then there will be very many popping up, especially if people aren't interested in doing them, and they are allowed to sit around until their timers expire.
---
If you are on a server with few events active go to where people are not and you will likely activate several.
---
Of course, but skins are dirty and rusted if you look closer, it‚Äôs Fo76 style, which is funny because those are supposed to be prototypes (x01 and excavator) and didn‚Äôt see much use. X01 looks more rusted than t51 for some reason.
---
You can craft the combat helmet and stuff, think I may have misunderstood the post?

There was backlash from 76 fans if you actually paid attention

we neeed this!

What system?

So they will make laser beams and frost particles explode again one day, yipee ü§©
---
Does FFF stand for furious fire rate? I stopped trading a few months ago, but back then nobody talked about those. Is that a recent addition to the meta?
---
why is it i only get mutant slayers,junkies and nocturnals

Trading was a great idea but it‚Äôs broken the in game economy. The prices of some items is just ridiculous.

A good tse can take you hundreds and hundreds of hours to finds but you can get 7k caps/day with one account.
---
Nobody in their right mind would sell a tse gun for 5k.
---
Yeah all the power armor skins are rusted, even the Nuka cola quantum skin and I‚Äôm sure the Arktos skin will be rusty too. But I like the bright colored ones like the Nuka cola red, the excavator yellow, and now the Arktos teal. I don‚Äôt like the dirty sludgy brown and dark red of the garrahan skin and the other all black coal one you mentioned. I understand the garrahan excavator skin is supposed to be the actually used version of the excavator armor, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs all dirty and blackish red. But it looks like dogshit to me.

we are now the knights who say ekki-ekki-ekki-ptang-zoom-boing

Because that's all I saw

Do you have solid proof? Anytime i find anything about it, its accidentally 'scraped' or 'trashed'. And wouldn't someone brag about finding it? Since its so rare?
---
No system no gamertag
---
I'm sure what you mean by the first part of your comment, but I agree with the second part of it. My 1* Bloodied Pipe Rifle is far more useful to me then my BE 50. Cal in almost all situations.
---
Yeah, me and another guy talked about it recently.  it's worth about 11 points of luck.  I can tell you that the only way I can get every other crit is with critical savvy level 3, plus a faster crit fill weapon and 23 luck.  The other dude said he runs unyielding armor on a bloodied build so he has like 34 luck and can get every other crit without the faster fill weapon.  So it's worth about 11 points of luck give or take.
---
So you're saying its fine that Bethesda will destroy Fallout 76's Appalachia because they **might** recreate it in the next game they make. 
---
Bethesda has reused old settings exactly twice, Elder Scrolls Arena and Oblivion were both set in Cyrodill, and they made a Skyrim DLC set in Morrowind. Bethesda isn't in the habit of reusing old settings for their games, they might reuse some assets, like they did with Fallout 4 and 76 but a **lot** of work goes into world design, that's work that would be lost forever if they shut down the server unless they decide to port Appalachia into their next online Fallout game which is highly unlikely.
---
Somebody asked me once for 200 k caps 
---
Two questions how the fuck does one achieve paying and receiving such amount it‚Äôs just mind boggling
---
\*I\* meant faster fire rate. bloodied is the new pve meta, with faster fire rate currently being a bit more desirable than explosive. anti armor for pvp.
---
but furious is also desirable, especially if they go and nerf bloodied/adrenal reaction.

---
It's mostly inflation. There is no real cap sink in the game, and back a month ago we didn't even have the impostor sheepsquatch event to burn caps on legendaries. I didn't even play the game too actively, and I still had to go out of my way to buy expensive stuff from players so I wouldn't hit the cap limit. 
---
I think it is a rising demand and falling supply to some extent though. Seems like lots of people have been coming back to the game with the past few updates based on some of the FP posts I see. Meanwhile, god-tier rolls are as rare as they have ever been, but we no longer have people duping thousands of them. The distribution of how many options the average player has of getting one is slowly getting lower because of that, so it makes sense that prices are going back up.
---

---
I always shoot the prize bot. So annoying.
---
I killed most of the stuff there so I'm going to Change servers
---
wydm
---
Exactly. I wish the impostor sheepsquatch was more worth it, then people would be spending 2k to run it regularly. I'm glad that the player vending is going to carry a tax with it. Maybe 10% is too much, since it might just dissuade higher-value trades altogether, but it's the first step to eliminating the massive hoards of caps and liquid items that higher level players have sitting around
---
This is some quality bait for Bethesda stans with Stockholm Syndrome to defend the game.  Hell I'm still amazed anyone is even playing this after the first week of launch.
---
Ignore those people saying kill the queen, they are misguided.
---
What you do is equip a shotgun, and the enforcer perk. Other cripple perks are available.
---
Shoot the queen in the legs until she falls over, once this happens she will no longer be able to turn or move. She has more than just 2 legs that need to be crippled, and has a lot of limbs in total, so it can take a lot more shots to achieve this than will most other enemies who only have 4 limbs, Scorchbeasts for example have 6, The queen has way more, at least two arms, 4 legs, and 2 acid spouts that count and regenerate constantly.
---
Her acid and melee attacks can not hit behind her, so once she is down walk around behind her, when she can use no other attacks she will spam mirelurk hatchlings constantly until there are at least 6. She spawns them in sets of 2-4, and I estimate 1/4 will be diseased, kill the non diseased and she will pop out more fairly quickly.
---
It is possible to easily get 6-9 diseased hatchlings depending on how greedy you are, as you can kill the 6th and keep retrying until the queen spits out 4 diseased at once, which can take ages, but getting whoopsies takes ages, so it can be a more entertaining way to pass the time than just standing there. Make sure you are starving, and take radaway to keep your disease resistance as low as possible.
---
If you want to just kill the queen and try with just one hatchling it will be miserable, I spent an hour trying to get it from a half dozen by this method and gave up.
---
Melee weapons are a big no no. Get the heavy gunner perk cards and grab a gatling laser or something.
---
COMMUNISM IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
---
Ah, that makes sense. I personally like furious, but I didn't think it was meta
---
You can craft the Combat and Metal Helmets by scrapping them.
---
Nope, its not just you. I have 5 photos that show all 3 creatures and it still didn't complete for me
---
Yes, Furious Fire Rate
---
I know 2 players that picked up bags, 1 had ammo ultracite which they couldn‚Äôt use and junk items and another found random armor and weapons above their level to use. They dumped ammo sold the junk or used it along with the other stuff. They didn‚Äôt dupe anything at all but both received the suspension. 
---
This is why I was saying it included non duper‚Äôs as well.
---
I still have yet to find the Free Range event
---
If I were short on caps and in dire need, I have some weapons that If I offered to sell for 100k, there would still be bidding.
---
Railway rifle had loot drop table screwed up. Any good railway rifles are pretty recent drop. Asking more than 25k for a TSE seems reasonable - its a "missing TSE" for many peoples collections.

Btw how can I upload a pic here? I don't think my Imgur link is working
---
I like cleaner brighter too but with their current design direction the darker the color, the less those rust will show, which is why I prefer darker versions. I have the Playtime and Nuka Cola paints, they‚Äôre lighter in color and full of rust spots when you look closer. Nice design but unnecessarily dirty.
---
yeah lets just continue to defend this game blindly forever. Why can people not just agree they like a bad game. Fallout 76 is no where to be close to be a good game not even in the year 2010.
---
dont repost!!!!
---
Because it is still a bethesda game, and is still fun.
---
Thanks for the input. I guess it's not all bad. 7 free points to work with now.
---
... they had a support option to get that. you probibly missed the window though.
---
People just love to take a giant dump on this game. I still play it every day and enjoy it plenty.
---
ok
---
I've done this a few times thanks bud, I'm talking about a hostile though
---
Sure Bethesda addressed a bunch of the issues. But the video is more about the rough state of FO76's launch and early months. All of this stuff was a huge deal.
---
aw man that sucks, I just powered the whole ps4 off, unplugged it, waited a few min, then tried starting it with it still unplugged so it tried to power cycle, then I plugged it back in and fired it up, then it seemed to work again
---
hope you get it working
---
The double xp was never meant to this weekend as well
---
It will be ok, I promise
---
That's beautiful, man **sniff**
---
a possible solution would be to server hop all the time, but yeah it is kinda dum
---
Does this increase my chances? Can anyone confirm?
---
Why are you subscribed to this subreddit. 
---
Why are you bothering people who like playing the game.
---
Why are you shitlording over how you hate the game so much and can't move on to other games and leave us the fuck alone.
---
I played it in the first couple of weeks it was out and my friends and I did every quest and sat at around level 100 before we finally quit. There was not a single thing worth doing in the game. Once you're finished with the questline, you're done. Since launch, there has not been any actual content. Don't sit there and tell me that brewing drinks is content because that's ludicrous. So that leads me to my next question, just what the fuck are people still doing on the game? I'm genuinely curious because I haven't got the slightest clue. Does everyone sit in their base and play with their dick for hours? TELL ME
---
There are several effects they could just port over from fo4.
---
Wounding (bleed damage) would be an excellent secondary effect. Maybe decrease it to 15 per shot.
---
Staggering effect would defeat sentinel armor. 
---
I still want my Defiant (last round does double damage) double barrel back
---
Plasma infused was a great way to get extra nuclear material.
---
Cool, nothing wrong with disliking the game.
---
Honestly, seeing that math.
---
I wouldn't actual mind if the system was take a crafted item and add X amount of random stars to it for Y scrip.
---
90% of the best star combos I've gotten have been on absolute trash items, If I could choose a good base item then the specific stars aren't actually that important. Always getting a 3 star "minigun" would be awesome, even if they aren't the best stars, because I want a minigun, not some 3 star rolling baseball security kitchen baton
---
Really? But they are both super hard to find. How many would i need to learn the plan? Can i get the plan for Army helmet as well?
---
It's almost like they don't exist to the game because I pointed the camera right at them and it doesn't register
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2vh4g/new_research_complete_guide_to_the_best_armor_sets/
---
Beyond me, maybe they weren't able to do it, but just because they weren't removed doesn't mean we're meant to have them
---
That's.....beautifully said.
---
The other five players from around the world complained about this too, Bethesda needs to address this by adding at least five more servers, oh wait...
---
I'm not subbed here. I just came to see what people had to say about the video since I know that gaming subreddits usually like to smell their own farts.
---
I got their email and responded to it. Still haven't received anything.
---
Like I said, you are trolling. You definitely do not know anything about 3D architecture nor game making. Get a book about computer and games making and learn. Don't just look it up from the net. You will understand the process. This involves game engines with maths and codes. Or get a book about game engine creation and you will see how the game is actually made. Good luck.
---
I feel like I've had pretty different experiences in game than you. I've given away quite a few explosive weapons I've found in natural gameplay to players just because I didn't use them. Tse weightless is an awesome roll though!! He did have a lot of good stuff. My gripe is just I don't feel like any in game item is or should be worth more caps than you're allowed to carry... for me personally nothing would be worth over half... &amp; that's theoretically üòÇ I can't imagine what I'd spend 12,500 caps on. Maybe a tse laser rifle because I know I'll never see one?
---
Lots of people have a poor definition for "value". Too many will just spend as much as the seller wants just because of the hype behind that product.
---
Best example for this are smartphones. You can get a flagship device for a lot cheaper if you pick a lesser known brand.
---
In terms of Fallout 76 we have TSE, AAE and BE. These are the overly popular "devices". The fun thing is that Mob-specific-Explosive weapons are on the same level as TSE and AAE. 
---
^^^(Now before i get skewered to death for saying this, people should know that both Two-shot and explosive are +25%/+20% **base** weapon damage. Hunter and other mob specific weaponry is  +30% more damage. This makes it so TSE is pretty much equal to Mob specific damage E. And yeah, even when you add the explosive effect for both bullets they're still more or less equal. Won't go into further detail and won't reply to anything about this subject. You can check the math for yourself.)
---
I‚Äôm not sure about any of the other head items but combat and metal can definitely be learnt as I‚Äôve learnt them myself. The amount you have to scrap varies you could scrap 5 combat helmets and unlock it or it could take 10. If you‚Äôre on PC I can craft a batch for you to scrap and learn.
---
In my opinion, anything of considerable value is trade only.  All too often lately, I‚Äôve seen posts from people asking for top shelf gear followed by H: caps.  Good.  Luck.  In our post-duping economy, all the most desirable gear (TSE, Assassins/Sentinel, etc...) are back on the ‚Äúrare bird‚Äù list.  As they should be.  And to spend the time building up mule characters is just not worth it to me.  Could I?  Sure.  But I‚Äôd rather just play with my original BETA character instead of having to spend all day shuffling gear and plans around.
---
If I‚Äôm looking to buy something rare, I‚Äôm going to offer rare in exchange.  Not necessary legendary.  Plans can be rare.  Unusual weapon mods can be rare.  It‚Äôs not about assigning a cap value to everything (this isn‚Äôt a business sim); it‚Äôs supposed to be about trading what someone else values for what you value.  Bartering.  Not buying/selling.
---
Caps still have their place.  Fast traveling, convenience materials purchasing, and so forth.  Now...to have some serious debate, what if you could trade for atoms?  That might make some of these trades feel VERY real, indeed.
---
Many people like PVP but don‚Äôt like to be forced to buy duped magic armors to be competitive.
---
It's because people have been playing every day earning caps, and there is no end game to use your caps on, so the supply of caps goes up forever, leading to inflation.
---
F
---
so far the best drop I have gotten so far is an Instigating swing speed pole hook
---
Then we use micro plastic lol... instead of 1-3 plastic we lazy...
---
Yeah, I'm also disappointed. I was expecting a normal "open" mode, like in many other online games, where you play the game in a normal way, the only exception being that encountered people can kill you or be killed by you without any artificial mechanical barriers. 
---
This is just turning into pure death match mode.
---
&gt; I'm not subbed here.

Use a gender neutral name.

I was subbed here back at launch but haven't been here since.
---
Wow that's great Information indeed. Worth 11 points of luck... wow. I'm currently running a critical savvy build as bloodied with 34 luck. Could i go to critical savvy rank 2 with 34 luck if i have a faster crit refill weapon?
---
Most people already put a name then they decide I wanna change to female or male
---
I want a poopin' one, when I shit in real life, I hide my character in a bathroom stall/portapotty or in a corner/behind a tree. Would be nice to show others im poopin'
---
Cryo Grognak Axe to RP as Sub Zero? ‚ùÑ
---
yeah I hate it, the dupers really help bork this economy, along with not enough cap sinks once players really started grinding 
---
also relevant is by allowing the pooled daily cap limit to 1400, Bethesda enabled accelerated inflation, although it was a welcome move for most people, because many of normal players have never seen 10,000 caps at one time let alone 40,000 caps which is just ridiculous
---
everyday players just don't play that much to be able to ever afford any of these prices, unless we get lucky with a great drop, and make the matters worse by then feeling forced to sell the thing at those outrageous prices, just so we can afford the already outrageous prices the guns/armor we would want to buy are at currently  priced at
---
Robot vendors should have only dealt with weapons and armor which are legendary. Cap limits on items should have been imposed by Bethesda the same way they heavy handed removed duped items.
---
It‚Äôs there. Looks bad ass.
---
Why can't you agree that just because you don't like the game doesn't mean it's a bad game.  It's ok to not like a game.
---
Not every game that comes out is going to be tailor made to your personal liking and that's ok.
---
Melee is awesome for damage dealing but is bad for crowd control. 1 bloodied ranged weapon can one shot everyone while in stealth in seconds. Melee will take a minute to do it.
---
Triangulation, surround the camp and have a generator surrounded by barriers, heavy guns, arty, missles only lol.  Hell I guess you could layer the generator with objects like barriers and metal walls/roofs.  I'll have to do a minimalist pure attack/defensive camp sometime.  That'd be fun to build.
---
Gotta scrap them..but for radium it takes forever bc the rate is really low either on purpose or by accident
---
Except for right now, where you are shitlording on people who actually like playing the game just like I said.
---
Just use melee and a bloodied sledge, must faster.
---
Ha, I would love to run into a gang of players wearing the same outfits! Team spirit!
---
Multiple counter mechanics exist for that. Stagger will break the protective effects. Vats crit shot will ignore the armor and the effects. Plasma weaponry somehow gets through, especially nades. Tesla rifle is also your great friend against those guys.
---
knucklessyrup. I messaged you yesterday
---
Advanced reciever was the best for most guns in Fallout 4 and many things are very similar to between these two games so maybe there was a mistake.
---
Dont know if it will make a come back or not
---
I‚Äôm totally showing my wife this. We have tons of these selfies. That‚Äôs awesome my dude!
---
You get stalked by one
---
Almost 19 years, moved to the area in early teens. It's one of those areas where people try to move away but end up back, mainly bc housing is cheaper and you can go a 10 min drive over to MD where pay is higher. 
---
It'd be ok here just as long as you don't interact with people, drive on I81, watch local news, or check social media from the area. Basically live in bunker lol. Right now Berkeley Co is in the news bc of teachers getting caught abusing special needs kids..but what happens here happens all over now, so it's like where is the perfect place to live anymore..
---
Cause I'm genuinely curious and I need to know how people are still playing the game and specifically what they are doing on a daily basis on it if you've completed the quest line and done everything in the game. Like I said on the other comment, I don't get it. It's like I need to get inside your head and figure out why you haven't moved on. I mean if people can't afford another game or something then that's a totally valid excuse but if you have the option to play anything else in existence, my question is, why don't you?
---
Of course scorchbeast won because it cheated by sniping far from the air ;) Nice screenshot btw.
---
Didn't watch the video. My strategy is shoot it until it dies.
---
If entering someone‚Äôs camp I always put my weapon away out of courtesy. Let‚Äôs people know you aren‚Äôt hostile.
---
How many hours have you played now?
---
Yes mob specific version are hugely useful. My Zealot explosive minigun does more damage to the queen than TSE,  because she‚Äôs calculated as a zealot. It‚Äôs +30% damage while TS is only 25%. Then after her HP drops below 40% I switch to Executioners Explosive mini, which is a whopping +50%, you literally see her hp bar drops fast (btw i farmed those myself). TSE is great because it‚Äôs a broad bump for all enemy types, but if you pick the right tool for the right mob, you get even better results. I don‚Äôt have a troubleshooter mini but I imagine it would work great for the ISS battle.
---
One of my best guns is a mutant slayers Gatling Gun.
---
YES!!!!
---
I've sold them for less. If I get another none of my friends need I'll likely try and negotiate item for item I guess lol What vendors are you getting 7k caps from in a single day?
---
I myself just started  a little over a week ago, only got to play a few times, but I am level 20. I myself help low level players. I built a base near flatwoods, when I see new players or people fighting and struggling. I help and then drop stuff I have. Emote and offer assistance. i kept a bunch of level 5 and 10 gear, all perfect condition or close to, 10mm guns mostly, and some melee(love melee).  
---
I also jokingly call myself the lone doctor lol. i made a lot of boiled water and i usually give away random water and some food to players.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter.  It may be nerfed but it‚Äôs still awesome.
---
What about caps? How much do i drop every death?
---
You know, I‚Äôve never even heard of cavalier armor.  What‚Äôs that?
---
Sorry I didn't get it
---
Got spooked. Dunno how much melee damage the sheepsquatch does, could have insta killed me as far as i know.
---
Or utilize current cards. Fireproof with incendiary, scientist with plasma, chemist with poison, first aid w medic, ect
---
I was hoping there would be no pvp at all, or at least keep it segregated to an all PvP server.
---
ASL is ‚Äúas hell‚Äù in current generation hip lingo. That person basically said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cute as hell‚Äù and got downvoted to shit.
---
1. Wonderful post, teaming up in the wasteland is really fun. 
---
2. Yes to no PA! I didn't use it in 4 and I still don't use it here. I just don't like how the display looks or having to keep an eye on fusion cores!
---
I'd have to disagree. I don't think any single item is worth more caps than your character is permitted to carry.
---
I spent 2 days maybe 6 or 8 hours refarming the marsuperial because it was back in like Nov or December. 
---
I have only just now at level 98 realised xb1 is listed over here in Reddit and can be a easy trade. Fml.

Mind you I also used to jump market servers in tf2 on steam. Like I know this, but as a dad, a gamer and a 32 yo i totally spaced like Courtney love with the shotgun behind my back
---
Powerful/mighty
---
&gt; Cause I'm genuinely curious and I need to know how people are still playing the game and specifically what they are doing on a daily basis on it if you've completed the quest line and done everything in the game.
---
They keep adding new things. Now you can craft customized alcoholic beverages, there's something called Nukashine which you drink and it transports you random places in the map, there's new monsters like the Sheepsquatch, new events like Fasnacht in Helvetia, etc. I have intentionally not completed the main quest line yet, I'm still exploring after months of play.
---
Too bad they don't even display names :/
---
I dont sell my really good items for caps because of how useless caps are. Only takes 2 weeks to get 25k caps if max the vendor each day and do a few events. Takes 15 mins to collect your 1400 for the day
---
You, me, and every other fallout fan were hoping for that. No such luck. üòñ
---
Overseers Mission is bugged for me also(PS4) and others. It may be the case as with "wasted on nukashine" where ppl may have been able to complete it before a certain patch?(Is the mission still active in your data tab?) 
---
Bethesda does not seem to be aware of this issue  however and it does not have issues according to their support site. Where even if you have all the holotapes listen to them all the way through, in order, the quest is still active. I thought I had completed it and even saw a notification pop up that I collected all the tapes(incld. Mtn. Rest) but the quest is still active. 
---
This bug is less annoying as "wasted" as it doesn't change any gameplay.
---
True, but it would be nice.
---
From what I read the advanced reciever was the best mod for it in fo4 as well
---
Wow. This is like a girl dumped you and you spend the rest of your life stalking her.
---
Trading for atoms I feel like treads into p2w territory but I get what you mean.
---
Maybe don't prime your comment for downvotes by saying the 76 community can't handle criticisms of the game then (a demonstrably untrue statement). I and probably others disagree with your opinion but respect it, however we will downvote you for being an ass.
---
Once you‚Äôre right up close it seems the Squatch can‚Äôt hit, push hard against it and keep hitting. Have to burn though it‚Äôs regeneration and not let up.

Glad to help! Once I figured it out, I was like "these aren't useless after all!" ü§£
---
Theres a perk card for that. Can't remember the name off hand.  Stabilized?
---
Omg... that requires like 8 characters to carry üòÇ
---
Aqua boy/girl perk makes that trait useless anyways. Have it on all my builds cause the rads from splashing in a puddle got very annoying very fast.
---
Same, that's my big issue right now honestly. I like the game, but I have the #2 controversial post right now about a few players griefing me in adventure mode. I thought they were cheating somehow, but the community is telling me that they were using legitimate tactics allowed within the game's parameters.
---
Potentially.  Yeah, I could see that getting abused.  Disregard.  Hopefully The Purveyor will open up some new trading options (legendary coins, what have you).
---
It's definitely the weakest game by BGS that I've played at this point, but I still enjoy it for what it is immensely. There's also time for it to raise my opinion of it with expansions, as DLC content in Bethesda games tend to contain their best content.
---
No, I am real. I work for [Prominic.net](https://Prominic.net). Here is my linkedin link :  [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmccartney1/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmccartney1/) .
---
I really have this issue and I was not banned. I play the game for PvE not PvP. I enjoy the discovery and the positive interactions with other players.
---
If you are genuinely interested in why people are still playing you are choosing a strangely obnoxious way to try and find out lol
---
Lots of cunts.
---
He's certaintly a PC user and I'll bet he played since early beta and because of that he was overlevelled and never started over, most of the game was boringly easy by the time most people started playing.
---
Yeah see that's my problem. Adding beverages is not what I consider content. A whole new quest line and armor sets and weapons is content. Being able to drink alcohol isn't a game seller. I can understand new monsters, but I was able to do everything worth doing in the game in 2 weeks of just simply playing after work with a couple of friends and playing on the weekends too. So people still doing this a handful of months later is mind boggling to me lol. Like since F76's launch I've played Red Dead Redemption 2, Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, Far Cry New Dawn, The Division 2 and many others and when I think of all the games I've played over the last few months and remember that there are people still on F76, I'm sure you can understand why I'm confused lol.
---
he's being downvoted because he's a transphobic cunt
---
That map doesn't have wood deposits on it.
---
ebic transphobia joke! very original!!11!1
---
personally, i love it. 
---
yes, it‚Äôs extremely flawed. it‚Äôs buggy, the servers aren‚Äôt very stable, the whole duffel bag thing, etc. 
---
but i enjoy it nonetheless. i love the little bits of lore around random places (outside of, say, terminal entries at morgantown airport. i‚Äôm talking unmarked locations, locations that don‚Äôt otherwise matter), i love the LANDSCAPE, i love the events. i have poured my heart into this game and enjoyed every minute of it. i like the fact that i can finally play a fallout game with my sister.
---
i do have criticisms though. i wish the story was.... longer? i guess. the story part of it didn‚Äôt feel very long or in depth or involved. the only character that was ever really memorable was the overseer, but with regard to her, i feel like i‚Äôve been left hanging. what happened to her? did she accomplish what she wanted to do? did she find any other survivors?  
---
the only quest that felt ‚Äúwhole‚Äù (for lack of a better word) was the mistress of mystery questline. you got the lore, you got the characters, you had to work to learn the rest of the story and you get a resolution that you can actually see. i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôve been given a cliffhanger. i wish the main storyline felt like that. 
---
i do like the return of weapon condition but i don‚Äôt like how you can‚Äôt repair your weapon with another one of the same. 
---
i love the mutation mechanic, even if most of the mutations kinda suck lol. 
---
my biggest and most glaring complaint is WHY CANT WE SELL AMMO TO ROBOT VENDORS
---
ok i‚Äôm done sorry for the novel
---
I just found a 3 star lvl45 Handmade with Explosive, Armor Penetration and Vats%. Is this worth it to switch from a full meele build? Im asking because I was playing meele build since day 1 and never tried something else because I never had any luck with good guns.
---
They don't stack above 2, which just gives a little more caps and xp. There's no tips, you've just gotta keep running the quest while praying to RNGesus. They drop in rank order, kinda, so you have to learn them to get the next rank to drop. They're a very rare drop, it took me hundreds to finish the set. I did deliberately do a few doubles though.
---
I just got it
---
He cam to laugh at you, you stupid inbred mongrel, But of course you wouldn't notice, after all, here you are defending this dumpster of a video game.
---
Right now I'm looking for a mother jetpack and calibrates shocks but if you have something to do on here we can play
---
Its okay just give it another 6 months
---
Same on ps4. Some servers the whole map is lit up, others have the messenger. Always the messenger.
---
I was hoping it would be one or the other, but instead we have a weird half-MMO game. It‚Äôs interesting tho, I think that nuclear winter will help clear the air around this topic since it‚Äôs another new ‚Äúway to play‚Äù maybe they‚Äôll go full mmo and make huge servers, or maybe they‚Äôll say screw it and finally add private ones so it can be co-op only with a few buddies. 
---
I think as it is though the game is kinda just finding its identity, if they plan on making this a long term mmo then I think we are okay, ESO is still pretty popular today so maybe we should just be patient and keep giving Bethesda feedback to help them optimize their game
---
I have every system, but I played it on Xbox.
---
And no I did not preorder it lol
---
Hard to speculate since the game has been released many months ago. All I can see if these screenshots are awful and whoever took it is color blind.
---
The Outer Worlds should be out by then
---
They‚Äôve said that eventually there will be private servers, so when EOL comes, I see no reason why they wouldn‚Äôt communicate all of those other things too. It wouldn‚Äôt harm them in any way at that point. It just seems really early to be making promises about that stuff now. 
---
Obviously this is a huge sticking point for you, and that‚Äôs fine, you have to make choices based on what you feel is right.
---
Just ask yourself, knowing that likely 90% of your time with most games will come while they‚Äôre relatively new or actively supported‚Äîespecially a live service game like this‚Äîis it worth missing out on that 90% because of the possibility you won‚Äôt get the other 10%? 
---
Only you can answer that for yourself and make your decisions accordingly.
---
Why not both
---
I mean no one beside yourself see/know it anyways.
---
I still would like to see that they use the Char names instead of those Xx_PssySmshr_xX tags
---
Don't get me wrong but isn't the Namething totally unecessary?
---
I would have thought it was new DLC for FO4.
---
Are you getting 7k caps/day w/one account with the vendor limit?
---
Marine has a bit of every resistance, combat doesn't have rad resist outside of legendary effects.
---
I got the same notification a few weeks before the actual sheepsquatch was in game, got me excited to finally see one but it was just a bug lol
---
I‚Äôm so glad you like it!! We only printed a handful of them, you‚Äôre the first person out of office to have one ü•∞
---
Make a shrine of Todd and pray to it every day.
---
I really hope someone at Bethesda sees this and resolves my issue. I know I am hoping for too much but I am an optimist.
---
Please do not let this post get buried.
---
Yes that is true but it could come into use some day.

Yeah i was just on playing my alt lvl 20. Im at my camp, by Morgan town, repairing my armor and 2 lvl 150+ guys start blowing my camp up......server hop.
---
Yeah, man, I get you. It feels good.
---
Why are you buying TSE, though? Why not spend a little more to get best legendaries?
---
I‚Äôm so glad you got the package okay! You have no idea how hard it was for me to not message you a heads up that it was coming hahah!
---
I love the game too, and it's my favorite game, but the launch was pretty legendary in its troubles. This guy just made a funny recap of them all now that the dust has settled. It was a fun watch.
---
It's not surprising once you think about it. You find random trash legendaries on a regular basis. Great ones come very rarely. God-rolls are few and far between. Considering how easy it is to get caps, it's not surprising people will offer as much as they can for anything of actual value. Hell, like others have said, most of the top tier stuff won't even sell for caps, only item for item trades with other gear that is so rare nobody will sell it for caps
---
You can be who you want I am not telling you otherwise
---
Maybe you've always looked after i cleaned the area before lol
---
Anyways - wish you more luck in future ;)
---
Calm down I am only asking if we can have the ability to change our names you goon
---
Lets hope so
---
I think you‚Äôre on to something. I unequipped all my cards and logged out. Came back, threw them on again and it seems to be working a lot better.
---
looks pretty high quality too
---
Changing names is technically complex and needs integration with Bethesda.net and the exterior account database. It's not as simple as you think.
---
Besides if that happened you'd never know who the hell was who on your friends list, particularly if they have multiple chars. Also tying it to gender change is redundant - if it's possible it doesn't require some arbitrary precondition.
---
im... not talking about you???
---
Id assume the enclave moves to the oil rig, fallout 2 plays out. The Appalachian BOS stays dead, while Macs in starts the one near the Capital. The responders return and take over for good, and eventually the scorchbeasts are wiped out.
---
Totes token the token
---
Good insight. What is slated for Nuclear Winter do you think that could change everything? I haven't looked that far ahead yet.
---
Wasn't double xp just for last week?
---
Oh lol, sry, Who then?
---
The Atom Shop prices is a gripe most disingenuous YouTubers (such as MrMattyPlays) and many others keep regurgitating. None mention that you can EASILY earn Atoms by simply playing the game. That nonsensical topic drives me crazy. It comes across as them reaching for something to complain about.
---
i mean thats good but i was calling the other dude transphobic because he made a "le ebic toaster gender" joak
---
Get a dense armor torso and/or the firproof perk and it stops being a problem.
---
Oh fair, I thought you were talking to me because I was being downvoted for some reason
---
My experience is that the Mothman is pacific creature, since if you do the Event ‚ÄúPath to Enlightenment‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt attack you. 
---
The only aggressive ones that I found are the ‚ÄúVengeful‚Äù Mothmen that stalked me after I took some eggs from under its statue.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs Hopewell Cave
---
This game‚Äôs character creator is definitely versatile!
---
Honestly, yes.  That‚Äôs an awesome gun.  Frankly, and don‚Äôt be offended, I don‚Äôt understand full melee builds.  Guns are so much fun.  Since you are just starting, keep in mind there is a learning curve.  Explosive guns suck in close quarters because splash damage will kill you.  I carry six heavy guns and switch between them as the situation dictates.  And I seldom use explosive guns in tight spaces (like Westek for instance).  But the sound they make, the ability to snipe from a distance and the fun of using the right gun for the job is awesome.  Get all your rifleman cards loaded up though.  Don‚Äôt discount guns if you aren‚Äôt using all the relevant perk cards.  That‚Äôs not a fair comparison.  Get them all, experiment, and then decide.  And then if you hate it still, sell me your gun!
---
I might have to try then! Thanks!
---
Same could be said about weight reduction and sneak perks.
---
Over here over here
---
She's crippled on all appendages... That's why she's still.
---
You seem like a sad individual. It would explain why you are still defending the game (probably still playing it)
---
If I recall right I think its gonna be a lottery kinda deal.
---
All we know is turn in, use Scrip at her when she's around.
---
They don't mean username, they mean character name.
---
Again, True but it should need some work keep the gamer tag name but have a grey or faint text underneath with your chosen name
---
oh so you just don't wanna kill a cat? it's a game bud
---
I only bought those guns.  The rest I have been farming myself.  I bought them early too when I was still learning this game.
---
I prefer a good, strong Up Yours like the WoW human emote. lol
---
Sounded like you sell your legendaries and then you can buy legendaries from her. Bethesda isn‚Äôt the best when it comes to wording things. Idk if it‚Äôs random, set or if you can buy mods. I‚Äôm hoping to be able to buy mods at some point and either trade out mods I don‚Äôt want or add them.
---
No PvP issues for me. Just unlucky I guess. Id claim monogah or something.
---
You thought wrong.
---
Loving the name.
---
Damn. So no building your own legendaries.
---
Could have been good paying for each mod with scrips and a possibility to add mods to items under 3 stars.
---
We don't know. Bethesda hasn't been clear on the details, probably because they haven't been fully ironed out yet. So everything you hear online is speculation.
---
They said they'd have more details on the Purveyor in next week's Inside the Vault, so just wait till then.
---
Beautiful story! My wife is more of a Zelda player, I would love to find a game we could play together! She thinks fallout is just about collecting junk to build stuff. She loves GTA V too we've put a good 5 play throughs in that gem! Happy hunting you two amazing vault dwellers!
---
Yes its his affect to make any hostile non player enemy non hostile to him.
---
220 Hours so far
---
If the item is worth mor than 25k caps in your own opinion you probably shouldnt be selling it
---
Generally speaking I've found anything over 25k caps basically means "it's not available for caps" i.e. trade items only. The caps number is just a placeholder to indicate relative value.  
---
Should items cost over 25k? ideally no. But the balance is such that only a few types of guns are really better than the rest, so those types are in high demand. And since the game doesn't drop them very often, there is not a big supply to meet the high demand, so the prices just keep climbing.
---
I do not advocate duping but in the time since it was patched out of the game the prices have probably doubled, because the supply of "good" guns just from, RNG drops is just not high enough to meet demand, even from the small % of the game's population that uses reddit. If there hadn't been any duping then prices would be even higher, I think.
---
What it highlights is that the drop rate of useful guns is nowhere near high enough to meet demand, so either the drop rates need to be improved or the guns rebalanced so that more types are useful in the end game.
---
Honestly, ammo types wouldn‚Äôt be bad either - electric rounds, Emp rounds, or hollow points - something to make it a bit more fun.
---
Yeah same, i have a friend that does a lot of trading so i sell him stuff at trade prices, if the market cpuld sell it for 20k he can have it for 5k or something, i usually just ask him to make me an offer and he can have it for either that or a little less than the offer
---
99.9% wanted that but that's not what Bethesda made or advertised
---
Do you have any loved ones whom you have been ignoring to play this game?
---
I'm just being devil's advocate here, but maybe you have a distraught significant other who would try anything to break you away from the game to spend some quality time together.
---
I go to Flatwoods and sneak attack a brahmin
---
Where did you take the picture
---
Oh, okay. I know how it must feel, I've seen people overpay a fuckton because they're unaware of what's best or how much something is worth on those market subs.
---
Bethesda should get rid of cap limits and allow us to mod weight on guns maybe like ultra light stock reduction Or aluminum parts kit. 2k-4k isn't much but than again 25k is to much if its more than you can carry. Cap limits hinder the in game economy and make weapons the currency of choice.
---
It's very rare.
---
Ooh!  An internet bad-ass, found in the wild.
---
Theres a limit on caps you can hold?
---
I don‚Äôt know that there is, because wood is literally everywhere. You can harvest wood from any downed tree, and there are wood piles all over the place in towns and where there are buildings.
---
Doesn't exist. Tried googling, nothing popped up.
---
Thing is, against players the TSE and AAE weapons are the strongest - which is what people want. Given that the perk cards  can affect the explosions - the radius for them is huge, and the damage is absurd - they essentially get 50% more explosive damage + their weapons base damage - combine with adrenaline and you‚Äôve got an unstoppable killing machine.
---
? what just for saying that im trying to be a "bad-ass"   lol ok bud
---
I censored that number because its a number that is associated with the devil which isn't something I'm okay with.  That's my decision.   Just like people using it in their sn, its their decision.  That's not what my question was.   Do people use those numbers so people know they're affiliated with pot/devil or because its makes them feel cool and tough,  or just to be funny.  I don't think people are bad for using whatever sn, Im just curious, not sure why you feel the need to get butthurt and try to be the social-justice hero.  I smoked my share of pot and celebrated 420 but I don't feel the need to get people to think I'm cool because I smoke. 
---
And in regard to home-schooling, while some are sheltered, most homeschool because of our failing educational system.  I would know since I'm a teacher and see it first hand daily.  I would homeschool my daughter if I didn't need to work for a living.

I still have my TSE Handmade, and it has been collecting dust in my stash like forever, and I only recently stripped it of all its mods so that it now only uses a third of the precious stash space it occupied before. Would replace it if I stumbled upon a FE or BE version of it.
---
Not a friend of faster fire, because ammo. Faster swing on melee weapons on the other hand is THE best combination with Bloodied or Furious.
---
Imagine a world where people can post comments as utterly pointless as the one I‚Äôm writing now, can you imagine?
---
Imagine applying these same standards to any other industry.........

Love all these ideas

Are you aware that you‚Äôre talking to yourself there? Maybe lay off the nukashine dude?
---
While you can disagree the buyers will not and there will bd buyers that will be thinking they'd rip me off :D
---
Your opinion on that matter remains subjective and limited to personal preferences. Market reality is what it is - there are people out there with multiple accounts, sitting on stockpiles of caps above 200k. Give them something worthy enough that they don't have, and you'll break the bank.
---
474 here and this was my first decent drop.  Now, if I were a melee player, I wouldn‚Äôt say that.  I‚Äôve had about 4 or 5 legit 3 star good melee weapons.  But I hate melee and I sell them.  So for me, this is the first.  Your mileage may vary.
---
As far as I remember, as soon as it was announced that it would be multiplayer people started having their doubts. Even before all the 'no traditional NPC's information. Even before anything was really known about it at all. So it was always going to be uphill battle for the game, even without all the issued the game ended up having. 
---
I don;t really remember what I expected to be honest. Actually let me check my reddit history.... OK this is the only thing I said at the time (11 months ago!):
---
&gt;My guess/hope is that this will be online in the same way that Dark Souls is online.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Edit: Hopefully with the same kind of 'offline mode'. And easier matchmaking for people who do want to coop.
---
So that does sound like I was expecting it to be a traditional game with some multiplayer elements. How wrong I was!
---
Amen, brother.
---
I'm going to try this tonight and have a mooch around the woods, thanks
---
Well you certainly dont sound like the typical troll. I am sorry you have this problem. I'd hate to loose my players. I think I remember something about not making 2 with the same name to be safe, hope that's not what happened.  If you are on PC I would probably have fun helping you at least get back to 50 quick.
---
I love the game and believe that it IS a good game. I play it a thousand times more than j ever played conan or ARK and I'm nearing the amount of time I've put into Fo4 into 76.
---
I think wood can only be harvested from trees and scrapping.
---
I haven‚Äôt either I don‚Äôt speculate anymore, if game of thrones and Bethesda have taught me anything it‚Äôs that you have to wait for stuff to get here before getting to involved in what it could be.
---
There are lumber piles you can build extractors on.
---
Do you have any input?
---
Do you have a valid reason as to why you think it's acceptable that the end boss of a game would glitch out and run away after a 30 minute fight?
---
Or are you just a fanboy?
---
That would have been spectacular! Playing with friends in Souls seemed clunky at times, but I think your vision would have been worlds more enjoyable to me.
---
I loved your art and was really inspired by how you interpreted the game. You made it yours and made the game something special when everyone hated. Thank you! üíó
---
He could be exploiting an empath glitch. Theres a group on the pvp servers that do this. Dont want to get into details about it, but its a pretty shitty thing to do.
---
Those big bones made for some of the creepiest pictures! Though it was less awesome than the bug that made everyone seem to run around naked (also great screenshots...). I hope your issue gets fixed, and I hope you come back to the wasteland anyway! See you out there!
---
I hate trying to give away weapons and armor. Every. Single. Time.
---
Me(lvl 222): Hey, do you need anything? I have a ton of weapons/armor in my stash. Pretty sure I could get you in a full set of Vanguard or Unyeilding 
---
Rando(lvl 77): Got any explosive guns? My character is an explosive build.
---
Me: I have a couple AA Grenade Launchers
---
Rando: Nah, like an explosive handmade or shotgun
---
Me: no...
---
Awwwww, didn‚Äôt the game play fair you poor thing? That‚Äôs life mate, suck it up and stop being so whiny about it.
---
There is. Its 25k
---
People tend to not comment anymore on posts like this because it‚Äôs the same bullshit over and over, people like you are just looking to bitch about a game that a lot of people seem to enjoy. Nothing in life is perfect all the time and a online game is going to have bugs in it. Either stop playing or enjoy the game for what it is.
---
South of the Top if the World, towards the nuke silo is a mothman spawn. I‚Äôve seen him too many times.
---
I randomly found the drain last night didnt know nothing about this Im about lvl 160 and was perked for weight reduction and over loaded anyway with guns to sell with low ammo and 2 half broke melee weps. I walked around the first bit like 3 times before I followed the marker to find the key. 
---
I was so curious to what was behind that gate I could just see a little group of ghouls waiting though itll be fun. So I got the key went in chopped them up opened the next door a few robots inside killed them done the task what was way to easy and short and walked around the hole place 2 more times thinking I had missed other mission nothing.  So I googled it today and see the way they was hyping it up before it come out Ive got to say that was way to easy and short I wasnt even prepared for it and just walked through it like it was any other town.
---
The area looked good but just fills like there should of been more in there the enemys werent strong or overwhelming in anyway and would of liked it if there was more missions to do with the old camp or town or what ever used to be down there. I dont even know what the point of the water pump mission was. Over all it just fills like a wasted area with nothing going on and now Ive done that mission its a pointless area they  could of atleast put a trader or something else down there so theres atleast some kind of reason to check it out again.
---
The developers collecting a paycheck for developing this game wouldn't even have an industry to work in if the pioneers of gaming released unfinished garbage like this.
---
&gt; That seems absolutely ridiculous to me.
---
That's because it **is** ridiculous. Two players both bringing two or three mules each, just to finish **one** sale? Just to amass those caps to buy the next singular gun or armor piece? No thanks.
---
It sucks especially for those players that are out of the loop as they don't have any desired rare weapons to trade in.
---
But fret not, there is always players practically giving away high level stuff; I requested an AAE Submachine gun from a random player a few weeks ago, and he sold it to me for 76 caps. Couldn't believe it myself, and that gun has since helped me secure a legacy gun.
---
A friend was determined to unlock all Radium rifle mods and figures it required scrapping around 700 of them. Crazy.
---
I was stood still in my camp by the top of the world the other day, heard footsteps, came out of my pip boy and dead, someone killed me, right oh then, its just more assholes using the workshop exploit to initiate pvp wherever they want, since the only workshop i owned at the time was next to the river (silva homestead?) So it was literally half way across the map from me.  
---
I dont mind people pvping for control of the workshops but come on, thats just plain shitty, thats people too shit to play survival become cuck lords in adventure shooting people in their pip boy
---
You mean I‚Äôm supposed to use weapons besides the three most popular rolls on the market? Are you suggesting alternative play styles and load outs make the game more fun to play? I don‚Äôt buy it
---
I like it, it‚Äôs breaking up the bland textures for a bit. I feel like it‚Äôs to do with nuclear winter somehow. Some pallet swap sneaking through.
---
Absolutely.  I never overpaid.  First gun I bought, back in the very early days of the game, was a TSE Handmade.  I was level 50 something.  The guy was clearly a super and I only paid about 1500 caps for it.  Considering the rarity, it was a bargain.  And it was pre-nerf.  It allowed me to farm WhiteSprings and go into nuke zones.  Worth every cap.  Since then I‚Äôve bought two more from people who didn‚Äôt know how to use them and complained that they sucked so I got them for a steal.  My 3 star Explosive Mutant‚Äôs Plasma Gatling &amp; my TSE Gatling.  Both less than 1000 caps each.  The Gatling guy complained that ‚Äúit breaks all the time‚Äù.  Ha!  It‚Äôs one of my best guns and almost every person I open a trade screen with requests one or both of them.  One guy wanted my TSE Gatling that he offered me 7000 caps.  I still said no.
---
I‚Äôm guessing they missed a decimal on the scrap rate...it‚Äôs probably not worth it lol I‚Äôm debating if I should give up
---
Pickets fort has huge piles of wood in a couple of the cabins, not a resource deposit but a really great source. You can't server hop because it is instance based
---
Never knew these existed. From my research, I've only seen references to wood extractors at certain *workshops*, but not in the wild.
---
The beginning of the video straight up says "this is satire" (albeit very fast but most people would be curious enough to see what it said)... The barrage of downvotes to anyone defending the YouTuber is obnoxious. I love the game just like most of you guys, but I swear everyone here thinks its some perfect game or something. Hot damn chill people.
---
The real money vs atom point exchange rate is high though.
---
Its 14$ if you want a power armor skin if you spend real money.
---
I‚Äôd like something to make my gun look nice like a shimmering affect or electricity surrounding it
---
The caps stash server hopping in the beginning made a lot of traders waste land wealthy couple that with the duping glitches where people would dupe 50,000 nuka colas drink it get a a cap and here we are 6 months later.
---
I'm sure theirs a trick to it. I have yet to shoot one down myself, but i bet that's why everyone prefers to buy them off other players. I see them selling on here all the time.
---
You should've accepted that offer! I love when people to overpay as well.
---
No, he kept a fairly close watch. We were farming and buying screws for days.
---
Except it's bugged? It, at least for me &amp; a wild majority, can't go beyond 100% durability with the axe.
---
I have it bc I got it by accident...no downside lol but helps clean up random mobs
---
I tried at a spawn near Grafton and and freak show, neither worked
---
\^This. I just finished, and got all paints including Elder. One thing to keep in mind is that the Initiate paint doesn't drop any more. If you hadn't gotten it before it was removed, you cannot get it now. They drop in order, but getting a paint is random, with a roughly \~6% chance. It took me 2 months to get them all. The best place to "farm" Technical Data for me was the Whitesprings bunker desks. I wrote a follow-up to TiptheRat's post with come corrections and pictures of all the paints. Check it out here:

If you pay real money for Adoms then you're not only lazy but dumb.

It's been posted. Multiple times.

I used to have trouble with it, but the past few have been waaaay too easy. Maybe 5 shots from my standard lever action.

Aim for the jets.
---
Hey my 2 star robot arm isn't that bad!
---
No I believe you! I meant Bethesda missed a decimal.
---
You are probably just too young but games where sold as casettes and CD's in the early days of world entertainment. The moment you bought a game, opend the box and getting utterly shocked because you just spend huge amounts of money on a game broken into two pieces. You couldn't get a refund and no one could have fixed that ever again. 
---
I am not old, i grew up with the internet, and still i know where games are coming from. You pay for such games and play them with the knowledge they are gonna fix that anyway and they will. But its time consuming. You know whats not time consuming? Complaining about things that are gonna change anyway.
---
Stealth vats crits is the answer. Seems to be what rifles were born to do
---
Ah, THAT I can agree with! üòÄ
---
I would hold onto them until at least the new provider shows up and see what that monetary system is all about.
---
Good catch, I didn‚Äôt see the Arkos tag.  My bet for you is to try and login that Tuesday they unlock the Arkos dungeon, they will probably go together.  You will most likely have at least a week, they only do the one-day only with the really flashy ones (blackbird) to fuck with us psychology, the standard, some like it some don‚Äôt, skins get at least a week, if not become standard.  
---
For example all of the new skins introduced this week are all still available.
---
I have more than a few hundred hours into rifleman builds. 
---
Rifles by design are high damage low rate of fire weapons.
---
Level 45 LA rifle with Hardened receiver does 174(?) base damage? Combine that with a silenced sneak attack and you have a 2.5 times multiplier during daylight and 3.5 at night. Grab an Instigating (even 1 star) for another x2 modifier and you are one shotting 95% of the critters in the game. Deathclaws take 2-3. SBs take 4-5. Maintain sneak and shoot them in the head.
---
Heavy Guns can't match those #s per shot. They make up for it with a much higher RoF (think slow sustained damage)
---
Two Shot Explosive is not the answer to every gun type out there. In fact, I would argue that it is one of the worst legendary effects for Lever Action and Hunting Rifles. Two Shot Legendary effect is notoriously inaccurate and even worse in VATs and only adds 25% more damage. Zealots or Hunters both add 30% (works on SBQ) and keeps the high accuracy. Explosive is "nice", but the Rate of Fire on the guns you are wanting to use don't support that mechanic.
---
Assault Rifle or Handmade with their higher RoF would support Explosive much better. 
---
SBQ fights; I tend to focus on the adds over the SBQ itself. When you are 1 shotting every add that hits the field before they even get in range of your teammates the Queen goes down so much faster. When I am shooting at the SBQ though; I swap to a Furious Assault or AA Handmade. Maintain the sneak bonus (easy to do) and you are pumping those rounds out with a 2.5 multiplier. VATs the SBQ in the head and you just bumped your damage up another 2x (not counting crits).
---
Play to your strengths; not to your weaknesses.
---
I tend to live down around Site Prime and all those little ancillary sites nearby; my personal best is 3 SBs and their little scorched buddies all downed inside of 60 seconds. SB #2 never even made it out of the fissure before it died.
---
I use a 1 star Instigating LA Rifle, VATS, sneak attack and head shots. One rank of Adrenaline, one rank of Gun Fu, and the luck perk that gives bonus crit damage. Never broke Hidden/Caution the entire time.
---
I was tempted, honestly.  I‚Äôm crafting / modding a lot of power armor sets and could have used the caps.  And I get better mileage out of my Mutant Slayer &amp; Ghoul Slayer Gatties, but the TSE Gatty is good for taking down beasties from a long distance since I don‚Äôt carry any rifles.
---
It's good for aggroing mobs throught walls and tagging stuff, but other than that it does like no damage.
---
They already did it with Hunter's Hood and some of the duped items, i'm certain they can do it with marine armor helmet too if they wanted to.
---
But could've gotten an amazing new Gatling with 7k! But I get you.
---
Thank you for this!  I‚Äôll check it out.
---
Thanks for the laugh xD
---
Yea its pretty dumb if you buy atom points considering you can easily earn a 1$'s worth everyday by playing the game.
---
That's why they should increase the amount of atoms you get with real money so it's actually reasonable.
---
Will definitely keep this in mind next time!
---
It's not a glitch, the event ends after 30 minutes. The point is you have to kill it before that
---
People like you are only here to make excuses for Bethesda.
---
Your complacency has contributed to what the video game industry has become.
---
Never heard of that one. Looks like I have some googling to do
---
hopefully by June or July as that should be the "6 month" period since I got my ticket back in December.
---
Maybe you could spend time reading or writing you illiterate meany
---
Ya anything really good is either 25k+ caps or trade only right now, people ask for incredibly high prices or they are looking for a specific trade that more likely than not they wont get
---
I bought my TSE Ultracite Laser Rifle for 40k caps, mainly because you can't get them anymore
---
Quality design, 10/10.
---
How about a game with no parameters at all?
---
They would have been awesome with the brand logos frosted on them... lazy short cuts...
---
So you‚Äôre just not good enough?
---
I'm 38 years old. I grew up without the internet pal......and games were released as finished products.
---
Great post.  Thank you!
---
Incidentally, I have one now but I‚Äôm not ready to use it yet. If anyone wants mine for free I‚Äôm on PS4 and you can just have it. The_Hexadecimals.
---
Typical millennial fanboy. Your generation is doomed.
---
Definitely bugged. Report that shit.
---
My complacency? I hate to break it to you but every game from every developer has bugs in it. RDR2 was a single player game and it had plenty of bugs in it.
---
People like you just look for any reason to bitch and complain. I honestly feel like you are just pissed because FO76 isn‚Äôt Fallout 5.
---
Thoroughly entertaining video.
---
&gt;Didn't even mention half the positive things about the game.
---
I mean, it's not a review of the game.  It's a video for those of us that remember Fallout 76 as "That horrible, horrible thing that happened to Bethesda last year" and want a humorous recap of the highlights.
---
You are most welcome. :)
---
Didn't say event failed until 10 minutes after she flew off.
---
The timer never ran out. Don't make my rough estimate of the length of the fight as an excuse......you know as well as I do that this isn't the first time anyone has reported this happening.
---
No because that encourages lazy people to not participate in events nor put time into the game in order to earn the Atoms. These are the same type of fools who are too lazy to build up caps to they buy them for real cash. If you can't gather enough Atoms to buy your cosmetic then you're just not playing the game right. You may want to consider Minecraft.
---
Idk I seem to remember there being another dxp weekend either week before last or the one before that.
---
Agreed. Bethesda needs to buff this mutation, and put a nice green aura around your character.
---
How do you even get that much caps?
---
 Have a cool idea for atomic shop, shut that mother down! Money grubbing, whale hunting, subhuman pieces of garbage.
---
Isn't the max character count 5, too? You'd need a second account just to buy something.
---
Try to empty everything, remove all armor and weapons, drop all unwanted items, (make sure there's no black powder), unequip all perk cards that affect weight.
---
Put on an armor with pocketed mod and remove it.
---
Log out naked and with empty inventory.
---
Quit the game (actually restart the game)
---
Log back in.
---
Just an idea to try by combining a couple of techniques.
---
Not saying it is, I just seem to have poor luck.
---
My level ~250 character has never found a piece of gear he uses. Zero good shotguns found. They're all donated by my friends. I find great weapons for other people. Just not me.
---
You say you‚Äôre 38 but you‚Äôre acting like a 12 year old.
---
I mean is he though? I didn't look at his profile, but that's an old joke referring to "I'm wolfkin" and the stupid shit with that, idk if he was making fun of transsexuals.
---
I figured something like that would be cool. Maybe not even real multiplayer Like the idea of having the option of having all the settlement spots on your map in Fallout 4 be filled with other players creations, so that the map is slightly different each time. I think Bethesda may have even been toying with that idea while making 4. Of course you could end up with lots  garbage player made locations so I see why it wouldn't work. But that kind shared world thing you get with Dark Souls messages and summon signs etc.
---
Go for the thrusters. The more of 'em you shoot out, the less the cargobot moves around. Usually, taking out just two thrusters is enough to make it stationary in the sky.
---
To be fair he did put in a disclaimer that his video is supposed to be a satire. 
---
I have a feeling he wanted to make a serious report on how the game in his mind failed to meet the expectations but at some point looked at his channel and realized his audience is there only for the memes, which is why the video is pretty much a compilation of all the internet drama instead of factual, properly researched reporting. If he actually wanted to do that then there would be a bigger discussion on for example Bethesda Austin's history and involvement with this game. 
---
It kinda bothers me how big youtubers still just go for the low hanging fruit instead of doing proper jobs since they could do more good than just kicking a dead horse, Fo76 is really slowly starting to turn into something good. Maybe a year or so, although there are still setbacks but Bethesd Austin is slowly learning, I feel.
---
Steel will be your new best frand

Correction:
---
Every game released by lazy ass millennial gaming companies has bugs.

We didn't have bugs in games before the internet and you lazy shit millennials came along.

No downside except accidently killing brahman your trying to be friendly with, killing squirrels foxes and rabbits you being nice to ect...
---
How?!
---
More down votes from the fanboys.......as usual no rebuttal.

---
Lol yes you did you fucking moron.
---
Does anyone know where he got those sales numbers from?
---
Hey! If I'd really wanted to kill him I would've!
---
What does it matter if it's in the past? One thing I see that should be learned but we all know wont. Is that people need to stop over hyping releases and stop preordering. That will teach them more than making countless videos about why the game is garbage. I didn't preorder I bought the game in febuary 2019. I enjoy it and almost did not buy it due to all the negativity.
---
Lol, bugs in games are a new thing? Yeah, okay. Tell that to Ermac, and combos I‚Äôm the original Street Fighter

---
I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, but it was pretty much along the lines of I had felt mislead and expected that the emotes meant new animations and not just new icons. And I went on to say how I was a long time player/customer and I felt let down by by the marketing and quality of that specific item. They were pretty quick to respond, they apologized and refunded me the atoms and allowed me to keep the emotes anyway
---
Do you not remember the days of cartridge recalls? Companies had to take all their games off the shelves and replace them with updated discs if there was a gamebreaking bug. Anybody who already bought it had to mail their disc or cartridge in to get it patched. Hell, when there was a bug that broke your save in pokemon diamond, you had to mail your game in to nintendo so they could fix the exploit and get you unstuck. That was barely a decade ago. The reason companies have grown lazy is because there's essentially no cost to pushing out a fix after launching a game anymore, but it's not like this hasn't been happening beforehand
---
It's a good thing though. The "triple A" gaming industry can be a joke sometimes.
---
I always have loads of stim radx and radaway that I turn into diluted whenever I harvest my purifiers. Also a single non nuked whitespring run gets you about 1000 if you loot everything
---
I think the tax coupled with purvayor vendor will start to suck some of the strain on the economy. The caps are easily accessible which makes inflation go up. And the only people benefiting from high level legendary selling or trading are grinders who in turn sell to other grinders because the prices are so high. If the "little guy" can work towards a weapon instead of rolling the dice, legendary selling will stabilize as demand will go down.
---
On a few things, yeah. So people can steal if they really want to but they have to work a little bit for it. I've also got a lock on a door down to the ground, but people can easily get into my work area because there are no walls. The locked door is just to keep the damn ghouls from bugging me quite as much.
---
I've got a water purifier right up on the road with no lock. I'd love to put a Free Water! sign on it, but signs like that seem to cost 11,000 caps and I'm nowhere near that yet.
---
People be crazy.    Who wouldn‚Äôt want AA guns?   I‚Äôm over here just trying to find an AA hunting/radium gun.  (I‚Äôm trying to go energy build, but I doubt I‚Äôll ever find a solid  gauss/plasma/Tesla/untracite)
---
No dance emotes. This isn‚Äôt fortnite
---
Holy shit, that is the single dumbest thing I have ever read. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is regarded as one of the best games ever made and that had bugs in it.
---
If they released with glitches your game went to the graveyard. No "we'll update it later bullshit".
---
You millennials are lazy and have been spoiled to the point where you are complacent with making excuses. A bunch of liberal pussies.
---
No it is, I was being sarcastic. I had to play for ages before I got a decent 3 star weapon.
---
He is talking about five chars per account, so 5 x 1400 daily caps, but that is still quite some busywork, setting them all up with enough materials to sell daily (usually serums or crafted clothing).
---
The difference between 33% and 100% of a 30-minute event is not exactly a rough estimate, it's just straight up lying. If you're going to come here to complain, don't exaggerate it to the point that it doesn't even make sense anymore. Yes it's an issue that still exists, and it should have been fixed a long time ago, but at least it's not as common anymore
---
Get a missle launcher with a targeting chip. Boom, jus changed your life. Lol. A friend showed this to me and it blew me away.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for you to call someone a snowflake.
---
I want to make more chars but I feel it's a pain to level up till you can get a build going :( wish I could be more like you. I'm a good natured person and I'd like to be a helper..
---
Highland Marsh
---
Yes, all quite visible with my Targeting HUD on
---
-15% damage when sprinting. Lots of guys on the market subreddit want them.
---
It's wild to think there are people who legitimately stan this game still lol
---
You have to reload the game

Your getting downvotes because youre acting like an asshole and attacking people for really no reason.

Sorry you're butthurt about 76 being a buggy mess. Real simple solution, stop playing and uninstall the game. That is the only way to truly show the dev's your obivious disgust for their product.

 But you won't.

Get your hands on the Marine Tactical Helmet plans, boost your Charisma with Grape Mentats, Beer, Mothman Omlets or Unyielding Armor and Craft/sell those bad boys for 30 caps a pop. It only costs 1 glass, 1 plastic and 3 rubber to make.

In my headcanon, Destiny's infamous Sweeperbot is a distant descendant of Mr. Squeeze.
---
I very much doubt this to be the case.
---
1. My wife and children do not have my logins or passwords. 
---
2. I only played after the kids were in bed for the night and while my wife was studying for school.
---
3. I have a really good relationship with my wife of 24 years. We used to RAID in WOW together when she had more time.
---
4.

If he‚Äôs 38 there‚Äôs also a chance he is a millennial.
---
Just because someone disagrees with you doesn‚Äôt automatically make them a ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù
---
Yeah, I server-hopped and got a different daily quest that involved drinking Fresh Vodka and testing my strength. Thanks anyways.
---
...so you‚Äôre cherry picking what bugs you want to identify? Mario 64 had plenty of bugs. You‚Äôre making yourself look foolish.
---
If ur on ps4 I can put a sign for u
---
Similar for me. I‚Äôve found things I‚Äôve been able to trade for things I want and now use. At least that!
---

May I have 1?
---
Bat Hunter. Rocking a prime minigun and prime ultracite gatling laser, I prowl the wasteland in my pimped-out X-01 armor keeping the skies clear.
---
Mr. Squeeze!!
---
[Here you go!](https://i.imgur.com/8mTDg7R.png)
---
Yeah, I'd just really like to be able to make my own set of awesome gear ya know?
---
Tell me you did all go and buy a lemonade off that glorious selfless bastard!
---
I randomly encountered one on the road south of harpers ferry. It popped in with a strikebreaker colonel gutsy and an assaultron dominator. They all started attacking each other so I got hits in on all of them and killed the colonel gutsy at the end because of course it was the strongest one.
---
Yeah my last character was a rifle build so im just trying out melee now 
---
but I didnt get any good legendary rifles with that character
---
I need one of those.  I just have the regular one.
---
Still a ton of fun though.
---
It was the only piece in the bundle I wasn't happy with. 
---
I was glad to have some more variety in Charis and such.
---
Not the model, but [there is confirmation Liberty Prime is in the game files.](https://i.imgur.com/8mTDg7R.png) Could just be a left over, though.
---
cc u/da5hitta
---
Oh, I know, brother, I know.
---
Thank you for the offer, although, for now, I am burnt by this issue.
---
I have thought about creating a new character but I want the experience of re-grinding the quests to be my choice, not someone else's.
---
Again, thank you for the offer.
---
Man its my fav legendary and only has the instigating. But with sneak thats 4 times dmg
---
Yeah, it's gotta be some kind of glitch. Have you tried fighting her again, and see if you get better stuff? If you keep just getting that, I'd screenshot your rewards when the event ends and send a ticket to Bethesda...not that their support is competent, but at least then they'd be aware.
---
[I too have acquired the rare Pepe](https://imgur.com/a/LrnJs6A)
---
We don't do that here
---
Has someone tried using the small letters on it? Feels like it would be good for that at least. I do agree though, considering how nice everything else looks, the text on the sign looks really half assed.
---
I have heard one argument from you as to why it's acceptable for the end game boss to glitch 6 months after release.
---
You just keep making excuses.....this game glitched.....that game glitched. Excuses...... someone else's failure doesn't make your failure acceptable. This is why your generation is going to get steam rolled when the next global recession hits.
---
oooohhhhh yea I'm not doing that üòÇ
---
Holy crap! I was there! There rest of the party chat after that dick left was like...
---
"Hey man, I've got this silver spoon. Your for only 35k caps. It's so ok cheep."
---
We all died laugh for the next hour.
---
Self claimed 38 year old makes a shitty complaining post, attacks and calls people names, then shows his true colors by deleting post body...lot of winning going on here and all respect gone...
---
I put a small vault tec poster and also a mounted head. Everything was floating... My OCD wasnt having it.
---
I did it myself to do all the quests at level 50. I've had to take a break after problems myself. I do prefer my new build a lot.  Good luck.
---
I used Lever Action Rifles in my Rifleman build up until level 45 when I switched to Handmade and later Legendary Handmades. The fire rate and magazine size makes it simply more convenient to kill enemies and adds a tolerance to bad accuracy/too close enemies. Quad Lever is still slow and you'd spend 4 times longer to reload so maybe it is good to replace a Hunting Rifle and stealth sniping but any ramboing high level enemies and I was toast.
---
so basically it'll be server hopping over and over like every fucking thing else to change her sell list. great

If you are considering legendaries, then yes bos combat armor would be the best, if not, id honestly prefer scout armor limbs over heavy combat limbs due the extra DR being better than the extra ER in most cases, however neither of those give you Rad Resist, marine is overrated actually, heavy robot limbs outperform marine limbs in almost every way, DR is the same but ER and RR are higher and heavy robot has more durability, legendary heavy robot gear is a lot harder to get tho, for late game gear, if you arent worried about rads, full bos heavy combat is the best, otherwise, bos heavy combat mixed with heavy robot limbs is the best
---
I made a valid complaint about the game.
---
I'm being an asshole because the fanboys have been attacking me for trash talking their game. Not one person has even attempted to offer up an argument as to why the bugs in this game are excusable.
---
Pretty mich the same thing happened in the opening months of Diablo3. RMT an shit loot drops decimated the game. Took a while, but they eventually flooded the gold market and made RMT obsolete. It hopefully wont be too much longer before there is some form of crackdown and rebalancing.
---
power armor + gatling gun all you need
---
Happened to me last night (EST). Much more than usual.
---
I demand extinction of all ratlike creatures too
---
Probably not. That's a bigger and more requested change, it would definitely be announced if if it was coming
---
The remainder of Whitespring seems to be inaccessible, I'm hoping in a future update, the robots finally finish their maintenance and refurbishment so we can explore them, and also rent the room for giggles.
---
But this just falls into the suggestion that I think we do need some more service options in 76.  We should be able to rent rooms at Whitespring, we should also be able to use autodoc chambers, or talk to robot surgeons to heal us like you would in Fallout 4.  
---
There's a distinct lack of medical care, and we all know that automated medical services exist within Appalachia, we just can't use them.
---
good.
---
Same person who makes flour out of concrete xD
---
Fallout 2?
---
I'm talking Nintendo.....Atari.....Super Nintendo.
---
There was a time when videogames sold as a finished product.
---
I got lucky. I had a Instigating Tesla Shotgun thay did explosive damage and I have no idea where I got it from
---
it's just luck based, the people selling them probably just farmed for a long time
---
They're both miniguns, so same build.
---
XD loled at the idea of bloodied TSEs.
---
Sorry mate but you can never have a bloodied and two shot on same weapon. The balance changes you ask for are not based on actual knowledge of the game. Assassin sentinel doesn't make you a god.
---
My children are probably older than you (one in college, the other university), if you carry on like this you‚Äôll end up on the naughty step again.
---
"""Slumber party"""
---
I can help,still looking for someone?
---
Yes but you loose invisibility when you shoot.
---
I never understood why they created such an extravagant event and play style and wasted such resources on something that &lt;1% of people play just because it's popular right now.
---
it's almost like some higher up was like we need battle royal! Battle royal big money!  
---
so they just did it to apease some dumbass higher up
---
I remember blowing into Nintendo game cartridges.
---
I was in my college years drinking and partying during the Pokemon days so I can't comment on that era, but I can assure you that there were very few recalls on games back then and if they did it probably was the death of that game.
---
Its all about the anti armor explosive from what I've seen. God roll sounds like 3* aa/explosive/assassin all at once lol. It is irritating that explosive weapons Are the only really viable gun legendary due to stagger
---
Agreed 100%
---
That was actually a pretty good video, and I‚Äôm not a fan of all his stuff. As someone who followed the game since the announcement, bought the power armor edition, filed for a real canvas bag, etc etc, all of this is probably the worst game launch and handling I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Oh man that piece is a god roll and insanely sought after...u better go to the casino with that luck
---
Thank you Sir, I‚Äôd prefer 15 points of actual luck cards instead of 5 wasted on mutation
---
Yep
---
The +25 rad resistance works on some pieces, its just glitched on some but not all, and marine is a bit overrated, marine limbs are outperformed by heavy robot limbs
---
Kind of. I've been doing freelance art stuff (mostly comics and art of people's various OCs but occasionally some sticker stuff and T-shirt design for myself, once in a blue moon a mural) so I'm sort of all over the place, but I had the sort of time where I could work in a daily art journal. I recently got a normal day job and it's taken up quite a bit of my weekday time now, so I don't think I could do a project like this again unless I ditched a bunch of other things I'm still keeping up (like my Deathclaw Desu Ga comic  [https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/deathclaw-desu-ga/list?title\_no=82535](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/deathclaw-desu-ga/list?title_no=82535)   and bi-monthly sketch nights for patreon supporters  [https://www.patreon.com/cutecomics](https://www.patreon.com/cutecomics)  &lt;- where I've also been posting bestiary stuff as I complete it).
---
So long answer short, in a self employed manner yes.
---
He's part of a quest from the Silver Rush in Freeside. It's lots of fun! New Vegas is my favorite, I've played through that one a few times. Get the Wild Wasteland trait too, it adds some more wacky encounters. Fun for a 2nd play through.
---
It's all RNG.
---
1400 x 5 = 7000
---
So yeah, you can *just* get to 7000 caps per day across five characters on your account.
---
This is so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You're making yourself sound like a fanboy comparing the bugs in Mario 64 to Fallout.
---
Ok so what happens if I find and buy one of the higher plans say would that mess the quest up for me
---
Yeah, it looks terrible. I also wish there were longer bar options.
---
Thank god for Anthem am I right guys? Like 76 is an artisanal masterpiece by comparison
---
That's a very rare pepe!
---
Did you swap out the emote? It won't just appear on the wheel. You'll need to swap out an existing emote for it. I forget under which one it's under, but if you have secondary emotes the R1 option to change will be visible.
---
This game should die....
---
This is the epitome of what happened to this game. Bullshit and misinformation spinning a narrative bc it gets clicks. Fuck people like this.
---
Ahh ok that was my next question, interesting. Seems this would be really good for a high damage rifle output build
---
I scrubbed it, it was stopping me from being able to milk a Brahmin and it will kill the wandering responder vendor bot that sells the rare outfits, nuka cola clock plan , cuckoo clock plan etc that spawns by Charleston station and other random spawn points so you would need to remember to pop a disease cure before taking with him. For me it was more trouble than it was worth especially when I had an instigating fire axe drop for me as the enemies were never full health so I didn‚Äôt get the double damage bonus
---
Aaaah thanx for the reply,i will try that!!
---
See, I knew you could figure it out. I'm proud of you.
---
I think everyone lol
---
I prefer my standard bloodied sneaky sniper with zero sentinel armor, but I got special situations toon with full weightless sentinel and it is viable for its purpose of being a long distance sniper
---
it's under the same emote as "trade" there should be a button that says "expand" when you select that
---
Anyone who supports this game will also let you fuck their GF üòÇüëå
---
I hope so. I can't wait for its shit show of a launch.
---
I've never met a single person who claims to be "affiliated with the devil" in any serious sense. I dont even understand the premise of your question how does it make you look "tough" or "cool" it's either a kid or someone mocking oldschool xbox names like X666xCoby420x666X and originally it became a thing because the best names were taken not because anyone thought that was better than just Coby or whatever.
---
&gt; I also think fallout 76 launch was pretty shitty. But this doesnt excuse any of the above.
---
I agree.  I never experienced a lot of the bugs that people were getting at launch and really took my time exploring the first 40 levels.  I know it was pretty shit for a lot of people though. It's pretty unacceptable, the game's launch was basically a beta and they should have released the game 6 months later. But you think this video would be popular if he pointed out how far the game has come and how actually good it is compared to launch state?  Just check out the r/fallout thread for the answer.
---
Yes.tell me your psn,i'll add you asap
---
They are very cool, I love the idea of having an item in game and in real life like that that you can decorate in your Fallout C.A.M.P. and your real life one (sadly my real life one has a much larger footprint so its harder to place it where I really want)
---
Thanx!

---
Fallout 4 had the ‚Äúyou awaken feeling a lovers embrace‚Äù perk when you slept and had a follower with a high relationship level with you. Could add it here for sleeping next to teammates and not randos
---
"This is a great journal but why is it all dyed red and torn up" "....Deathclaw attack."
---
Oh man, I saw one like 2 days ago. I'll have to go in game to look, which will probably be in like an hour.
---
"so you're saying there's a chance?"....Dumb and Dumber.
---
Nice straw man.
---
Yes somethings are so rare like be lasers that can for 25+ and I have also seen a couple Quad Explosive Ultracite Laser Rifle go for 100k caps for one
---
Well the game came out in November, it‚Äôs been about 6-7 months... No Man‚Äôs Sky has been out for years and has had huge updates that got the game to where it was promised and then some. 
---
Soooooo  probably after this current  roadmap is released and If Bethesda doesn‚Äôt do anything else to fuck up whatever little good will it has. 
---
And it‚Äôs also the internet and Fo76 is really really easy to make fun of so hey internet points
---
Dude I haven't been able to stop thinking about it üòÇ
---
I might be, depends what time zone you're in?
---
Add me, I play like that as well. Currently lvl 26
---
Given the lack of available information? He either made them up or got it from someone who did. People tend to spitball when they can't find relevant data about sales, I've noticed.
---
How is it going to make prices go down when people are going to charge an extra 10% to make up for the loss to tax?
---
If you're talking about the Vault Dweller Journal, I did put it up on [http://www.lulu.com/shop/shia/vault-dwellers-journal/paperback/product-23997389.html](http://www.lulu.com/shop/shia/vault-dwellers-journal/paperback/product-23997389.html) for anyone who could want one.
---
I gave away an explosive gatling laser!!üòÇ
---
I see you're a man of class as well.
---
Wouldn't mind a copy of the bench 2x in length, rather than joining two small ones end to end
---
What platform you on I might have an energy weapon you might like
---
Yea Explosive doesn‚Äôt drop on laser anymore so just the Explosive on and laser is worth 10k plus. Sorry for your loss
---
"this game mode is popular so its bad"
---
that being beside the fact that you dont know what koth is
---
I would lose my mind if I could get reckless on a bloodied shotgun

This is why I hate these video game YouTube "news" channels. People hate on video game journalists a lot, but they are not half as bad these insufferable YouTubers.
---
My name is Ron.
---
Not bad
---
I‚Äôm going for power armor build as well. Didn‚Äôt use White Knight tho since it‚Äôs for regular armor and not PA (and I‚Äôm mainly in PA most of the time) used those points somewhere else.
---
A Furious Drill would be really good.
---
Great idea!
---
Unlucky
---
Yea. I have to use 2 to get the look im going for.
---
Can't be any worse than what Bethesda did with 76.
---
Lol. It's the opposite - just because you like the game doesn't mean it's good.
---
It's nowhere near the quality of the greatest Fallout titles. That doesn't mean there is nothing good about it or that it's not possible to enjoy the game, but come on.
---
makes sense! thank you
---
You can sell junk to vendors each day for 1400 caps
---
1400 caps x 7 days = 9800 caps a week
---
Some people save up
---
Does unyielding have a charisma buff? I have about 5 pieces in stash thanks for the info :)
---
The top thread in the past month was about the repair kits. It got 6k upvotes. What are you talking about?
---
As for them selling loot, I'll believe it when I see it. I remember people saying the same thing about ESO or WoW, neither of which ever happened.
---
If anyone has two accounts just so they can hoard caps in Fallout, that's fuckin pathetic honestly.
---
what do i sell that can net 1400 caps??? even bulk i never make more than hundreds
---
Today was the first time I found one with a 3-digit amount in it (120).
---
Not only can he be killed, but he just drops dead after so long. It‚Äôs really odd
---
Yay - purchased üòÑüëç
---
It certainly does. You just have to be 3/4 radiated.
---
&gt;People just love to take a giant dump on this game
---
The ol' "haters gonna hate" defense, good one.
---
I didn't see that White Knight was not for PA. I'll have to replace those points
---
It might just some teammates keeping warm right?
---
I don‚Äôt even know what the hell I get up to every day on this game lol, I used to always be a junk collector but 76 has made me question everything!
---
Sweet stuff.
---
Same. And I've been playing a lot.
---
I think so, I had to look up his signature and compare it to what was on the poster on account of some people (like myself) tend to scribble out their signature [https://imgur.com/Tlf24n7](https://imgur.com/Tlf24n7)
---
So what you're saying is, only post something positive and nothing negative in this sub? Todd Howard, is that you?
---
I used to build my camp right near the vault and get all sorts of new players wandering by. I'd help them out if I was there, and then we would go our separate ways. I have yet to stalk someone (though it sounds like fun), and if I have been stalked, I never noticed. Too bad. Sounds like a giggle!
---
naw PC
---
I just want to buy a copy of that journal. I read a few of the pages and loved the artwork. It would look great as a display piece. So if you ever print up more and sell them, put me on the list. Lol.
---
I am happy your post is getting traction! This is a HUGE problem with the in-game economy. This is evidence and proof how much dupping has DESTROYED this game's economy. The fact that people can even ask those prices is insane! 
---
It did, however provide a hilarious inside joke within our community. ü§£
---
I haven't deleted anything. I've edited a few typos because I'm typing on an Android keyboard but that's it. Everything is still there...... Bethesda should be ashamed....... millennials are complacent pussies........yup it's all still there.
---
I found a instigating explosive handmade when level 55 or something,now level 135 and stil using it:).and once a explosive pipe gun.i bought a tse handmade tho,you cant be that lucky:)
---
Yah added to my Fallout swag shelf of things.
---
One is a quad double barrel, the other is a 2 shot combat .  Both are 1*. Believe both are L40 or higher (didnt write it down and dont remember)
---
PSN is aj ninetyeight
---
Sweet cheers, I thought it was just a DR buff. TIL! I only have 1 cCHR so prices are pretty tight
---
Anthem diverts all the attention away from FO76.
---
Exactly, something like that. Just another facet of team-play.
---
K.
---
Well I used black pen ink (parkers quink) and also coffee to mix things up. I've heard of people painting in it and I liked the idea and found mixing it up with ink on the paper with water did some interesting things. And you can only get better if you practice a little bit each day, like with those inktober things.
---
That's relative to expectations. Most people seem to be expecting TOW to be a Fallout replacement, so I imagine there'll be a lot of disappointment when they discover it's a much shorter, more linear game. I've already seen a lot of fickle "fans" turn on it for being an epic exclusive.
---
I use mine. It's one of those pieces of merch that feels real, like you could have actually picked it up last summer at your visit to Nuka World. Got too much other stuff on my merch shelves as it is lol
---
It's got the best ballistic resistance. Heavy combat armor has the best balanced in terms of resistance.
---
Don't like this post? Move on.
---
Haha no it's a thermos my friend Deebs/Turtle sent me for my birthday. She painted up a thermos as a reference to my webcomic, Deathclaw Desu Ga.
---
Collect mothman eggs and cook them. Hit up farms and pick all their food and sell
---
Just pick up everything not nailed down, namely off of enemies. Outfits are usually good value for the weight. Use Super Duper and Green Thumb to maximize profit from crafting things.
---
Why not?
---
Go to a place with a lot of enemies, put on excavator armor and pick up every gun they drop. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Going into a nuke zone and killing glowing ones to get ionized meat and glowing blood are also very profitable
---
New Vegas had different ammo type crafting and I miss it.
---
Is there any proof that it'll be shorter or more linear?
---
Kill Muties, Cryptids and loot like there is no tomorrow for caps, don't forget to collect&amp;sell weapons etc.
---
Probably a stealth build or crouching
---
Yah, I ordered one as a proof then ordered a bunch more for myself and took pictures of them so people could see how they look. Spiral bound was a little more expensive to get printed, but it felt way more journal-like in the end so I went with it. It also made it very easy to flip through pages and read them. So what you see is what you'll get (and if they misprint something lulu com is pretty good about shipping you a replacement - though they haven't screwed up on any of these yet).
---
Food is a big money maker
---
havent heard anything from them since they got people to put a support ticket in about it
---
If you are gravely concerned about countering stealth boys, you will leave room in your build for Tank Killer. It's the only perk you need to kill a Stealth Boyed Sentinel or Cavalier with an automatic Tesla. 
---
Your build can't spare 3 points? Scissors, meet rock.
---
Do you complain that melee cant kill ranged characters because bullets can fly?
---
You know it, Im getting a frame today from Michaels. And you could always call and see if they do tours or something.
---
Bought it the first time I met him, along with the clean straight jacket. No server hopping, just complete luck. I find the key with these things is not to want them, and then they happen lol.
---
Maybe I nailed your daughter?
---
What's her name?
---
We need some more information. If you're like, level 20, then yes of course you're not getting enough caps. If you're level 50+ and you're not making it, then you should be concentrating on getting the hard bargain perk. Get the chemistry weight reduction perk in str. Built an excavator suit and put calibrated shocks on it...+200 carry weight for the cost of 10 in your inventory. 
---
Hoard every single aid item you run across, they sell for 8-10 on average. You can get a mess of them farming ghouls, using the luck medical search skill in places like hospitals and hotels that have a lot of med bags/bathroom medicine cabinets/etc. 
---
 Hoard costumes, especially golf gear, ranger outfits, strait jackets. Those sell from 30-50 each. 
---
Kill super mutants and sell their guns, assault rifles sell for like...18? on the low end, and up to I think 40-50? It's been a while since I've used this method due to carry weight, but it's valid. 
---
The hard truth is, a lot of people do things like farm for legendary gear and just sell those, and ignore the "trash" common guns, when a lot of "trash" is actually very valuable.
---
May i join? :)
---
PS4
---
I want this. It would complete my set!
---
I have 3 CHR myself mainly for Hard Bargain. Grape Mentats, beer and Mothman Omlets are really easy to make. Combine that with Unyielding you'll get a decent boost.
---
You've been Gnomed.....
---
All those junk weapons and armour add up.. pop a grape mentats and equip hard bargain before you sell.
---
Run through a location close to a train station and loot every gun, don't care about weight.. I'll get to 5-6 even 700 Pounds.. when you're done waddle over to train station and sell. You can get your 1400 caps a day in usually 2 runs, one if you can jack charisma and have maxed hard bargain
---
Pulls 10% of the transaction out of the economy, fighting inflating prices. The game generates caps but doesn't currently have a way to siphon some off. A tax like this would.
---
I'm at work right now I'll send some pics around 5 if u want
---
You're probs better buying plans off people on here. Most sell for a fraction of the price vendors want.
---
Well I did it for fun, and because I liked the game and it gave me a chance to practice my pen and ink skills a bit. And people seemed to like reading them too, which was just icing on the cake.
---
That‚Äôs the reason why I didn‚Äôt go for it. It just came off rushed. Wish they gave you variants on the backboard for all the brands if it‚Äôs gonna be a premium tier shop item
---
currently level 35
---
My stash has been full since the game came out so I sell my junk if I can. Some of it is pretty good price
---
Does it? The ones I'm finding for torso are lvl 45 but only have around 25 or so ballistic with no mods whereas my combat armour torso is at 91 ballistic. Is there different versions like a heavy version? Or a defence mod that brings it up 70 defence?
---
My favorite spots are top of the world and harpers ferry since there is a vendor right there.  Go around killing enemies that drop weapons and pick them all up, pick up every chem, cook and sell all the meat enemies with no guns drop, build a couple water purifiers at your CAMP to make more than you need.  All this stuff can be sold; vender trash isn't hard to come by once you have the right idea.
---
You forgot the /s
---
I'm not crying! You're crying!
---
Thanks, and hope you like it! Be sure to show me pics and give an impression when it arrives!
---
We've known since December that it wouldn't be open world, and recently Obsidian compared it to Knights of the Old Republic 2 in scope (though hopefully with an ending).
---
your digression about the kid you didn't know led the story towards "bethesda mailed me a child!"
---
Amongst other things, you can get wood scraps from: Woodpiles near cooking stations and fireplaces, logging trucks (goto the round end of the cut logs), clipboards, wooden blocks, and picture frames.  Take a stroll through toxic valley - lots of downed trees.  Some rifle scrap also yields wood.
---
Sell assault rifles from mutants, purified water and chems. This is how I reached the cap limit. I have 4 water purifiers and I sell al the chems that I find except for mentats
---
"Create an echo chamber because I don't like anything negative!!!"
---
Dude, I have my camp set up across Slocum's Joe for this exact reason. Even made sure not to remove the 2 logs that have the firecap growths.
---
It lives in one of my best friends stash. She'd probably give it back if I cared about it. Maybe she'll get an awesome trade out of itüòÅ
---
Purely luck. I only seem to get stalkers.
---
Is you gt same as Reddit?
---
My personal opinion on one matter, I think yongyea is usually pretty fair and accurate with his coverage. Seems like he does his research and presents evidence. It‚Äôs rarely been good news he reports on though, so I can understand why someone might think he‚Äôs unbalanced. 
---
Fair play you made some good points.
---
Wat? That's an FO4 chart.
---
1. What system?
---
2. Unarmed? Punch them.
---
Are you talking about Signs and Letters? Bought it last week but not sure if I'll keep it and may let is go.
---
Oh thank God,
---
I put them up on a print on demand site (because I have so little free time that ordering a bunch of prints and mailing them out would be trouble) - I did a small run for my patreon folks where I signed them and slapped some extra stickers and doodled in the cover for folks and later put it up for anyone else interested on  [http://www.lulu.com/shop/shia/vault-dwellers-journal/paperback/product-23997389.html](http://www.lulu.com/shop/shia/vault-dwellers-journal/paperback/product-23997389.html)  so you can grab one there if you want! (or you could get it printed yourself if you wanted to save money or print it differently, I left a pdf of all the pages and cover artwork on the imgur post for folks).
---
Actually n/m. I'm going off of my pieces, but they are Sentinel so that might be effecting the resistance rating on the when I view them.
---
Loot system is heavy casino. It's sellers market.
---
I'm I'm surprised that caps are still used as currency to be honest. There isn't any form of currency to goods balance. With idea 'hop to server play whatever it works' there is no real goods implemented. There is no project to spend resources at after initial period of camp building and modding equipment. (Only fluxes, rare outfits and plans can be really mentioned here) On big picture crafted items overshadowed by legendaries, repair with repair kits from atom shop (-"What is economics?", - "what is player feedback"), just drink boiled water, hoard caps and pray for good roll. No goods, except god rolled 3 stars.  And perceived inflation is a result of duped items dilution, and that's it.
---
good items cost 40k+ cap because caps cost nothing
---
Does it have a condition bar?
---
He's saying the same shit with the same spin that 1,000 other YouTube "content creators" already churned out months ago. It's neither recent enough to be relevant or old enough for people to need reminders, and none of his takes provide any new insight.
---
He made this video for easy clicks and just sat on the egg for half a year too long.
---
The MG42's only flaw in my opinion is how quickly it burns through ammo. I also wouldn't be opposed to a higher magazine capacity but I can live with that myself.
---
Charisma the high it is the better you sell for, hard bargain help alot too. If you have low charisma and no hard bargain you are not going to make any caps.
---
They pack them with those little silica packages to make sure they're still fresh on arrival
---
Probably because those were heavily scripted sequences in a tight confined space that only followed a single simplistic programming cycle, targeting a singe entity without any real large variation in need to path find or deal with changes in play. Almost like modern games are bigger and have more things to break then fucking Super Mario Bros
---
Oops forgot XB1
---
Bloodied lever action can pretty much one shot any non boss enemy, idk why people think you need a god tier gun to be effective
---
But two shot makes vats completely unusable.
---
Oh man, if they allowed us to turn our beds into bunk beds we'd have so much room for activities!
---
What's your torso ballistic defence? And what's sentinel?
---
Preface: I have and enjoy the game.
---
That being said.....
---
***IT SAYS BAD THINGS ABOUT MY GAME SO IT HAS TO BE FAKE AND WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!***
---
(Heavy) Metal armor has the best ballistic resistance.
---
Fully modded, marine is a good mix of high ballistic, medium energy, and medium radiation resistance that makes it very well rounded for all combat.
---
Guns and low level legendaries. It's real easy to hit that cap. Just go to a place with super mutants kill them and sell all their guns.
---
Welcome to the internet, may I get you a drink? Warm towel?
---
Will do - I am so excited to add it to my Fallout stash üòÑ
---
Crouching hides you from he map. Someone was probably stalking you in Chameleon for fun/loot.
---
How does it pull it out of the economy when the person who charges an extra 10% receives the amount they wanted to charge anyway?
---
Original price: 200 caps
---
Factor in tax: 222 caps 
---
Full price achieved.
---
plus, what kid doesn't love little plastic crap? how considerate.
---
Sweet. I will definitely order a couple. The artwork is amazing. Thank you for sharing.
---
Could be worse, I only get nocturnal weapons/armor..
---
On xbox, you can game and gold share off one consol. So you can run unlimited gamertags and characters for free.
---
Just googled my way here to try to find the same answer, don't be an ass, not everyone has unlimited free time
---
Awesome :)
---
Also the house in direction of sutton nearby is a honey pot for them!
---
I was pissed when I got the bunk bed plans and could only use the bottom bunk.
---
80/195/55
---
Now that I didn't know. Appreciate the heads up. :)
---
I'm of the mindset that while duping was still a thing, the dupers kept the inflation down. More supply meant lower prices. The inflation ran wild after duping was eliminated, causing traders to jack up their prices because they had one or two of those weapons or armor pieces left. Then everyone did the same, then they started going to item for item trades only because "caps are worthless".
---
Back when I had X01 jetpacks for sale at 800 caps per, it was because I ran into someone at 3 am who was willing to sell me 8 for 1k (125 apiece!). So I figured if I bought them that low, I'd keep my prices low. Those 40 jetpacks went out the door fast. Now you're lucky if you can find one for sale at 1500, which is outrageous. I still keep my prices low, but a lot of traders don't.
---
Because people spend more caps, 10% more caps. 
---
The more caps you spend, the more valuable your caps become.
---
For example: If you would pay 10% of your monthly salary on rent, you have 90% of your monies left. You're quite happy with that.
---
If the rent suddenly becomes 50% of your monthly salary the money you still have suddenly become more valuable. You have to pay more attention on what you're spending them on.
---
Now if everyone in the world has to pay 50% of they monthly salary on rent, and everyone is going to spend less on random things, the manufacturer of random things finds himself/herself forced to lower the price so people can buy those random things.
---
This way that random thing that was $10 before all landlords decided to increase the rent now will go down in value to let's say about $8.
---
It's still more than you will want to pay for BUT it costs less. It has the same value as before but the price is lower.
---
Keeping the prices low and having a strong currency is extremely useful, otherwise if banks and governments just start printing infinite money soon enough you'll find yourself having to go to the grocery store with a briefcase full of money just to buy a bread. After WW1 in germany you literally had to go to the store with a wheelbarrow full of money
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation
---
In Fallout 76 we have a maximum cap on caps, so making each cap be way more valuable than it is now it's extremely important. Think of the max cap on caps as a wheelbarrow. We can only carry 25k caps. But if a bread is 30k caps we don't have another wheelbarrow to carry the extra caps. This is why we need to make our caps more valuable.
---
How to make caps more valuable? By increasing the number of caps sinks. 
---
Just read all wikipedia articles on Inflation, you'll be able to apply it to fallout 76 pretty easily and you'll understand why we need that 10% tax, heck, i'll even increase it..
---
Unfortunately, there are no programs that support Fallout 76 meshes as of now. NifSkope supports Fallout 4 meshes, but it looks like the creator is not interested in adding support for Fallout 76 meshes for some reason.
---
For future reference, these are the steps to access Fallout 76 mesh files:
---
1. Open the Bethesda.net launcher
---
2. Download the Fallout 4 creation kit
---
3. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Laumcher\games\Fallout76\Data
---
4. Open one of the Meshes.ba2 files (you might have to do this step and steps 8-12 again until you find the right one)
---
5. Click on "Look for another app on this PC" (you only have to do steps 5-7 once)
---
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Tools
---
7. Double click on Archive2.exe
---
8. Type the name of the mesh (you might have to guess what it's called) on the search bar at the top of the window
---
9. If you find something that you think might be the mesh that you're looking for (file extension should be .nif for meshes), click on it
---
10. Click on the Archive tab and click on Extract Selected To... (or press Ctrl+E)
---
11. Pick wherever you want to access the mesh file and click on Select Folder
---
12. Check to see if that's the mesh you're looking for with a program that supports Fallout 76 meshes
---
Maybe Bethesda developers should go back to making simplistic games until they're capable of something bigger?
---
Developers nowadays have much better hardware to work with......but why spoil a good excuse?
---
Thanks. Misread account as character.
---
Its crazy to think someone stalked you and took your stuff üòÇüòÇüòÇ but its true
---
Those high prices are totally reasonable. How long does it take 1 character to get 40k caps? Like a month? I'm 700 hours into the game and never had a TSE anything drop.
---
No it's not there. Went from [deleted] to nnownow showing [removed]. You need to get a grip on reality
---
 Its dumb but the The Whitespring has a lot of stuff you can sell to the vendors. All those Ceramic Flower Pots and other crap can take their 200 caps.
---
Out my large friend group I'm the only one that occasionally logs on to see how it's doing. And almost every time I try it the world's seem quite empty unless there's an event going on our something new just added
---
76 is just an overall disappointment. Fallout should not be multiplayer. End of story. Vats doesn‚Äôt work in multiplayer. Stealth doesn‚Äôt work in multiplayer. It‚Äôs just a bunch of fighting bullet sponge enemies. 76 is several years newer than 4, but it doesn‚Äôt look/ play like it.
---
It is 2.46 Million, if you trust these sources

---
Because the 10% vanishes. If there are less caps in the game, prices will be lower because caps will be worth more.
---
Certain guns are so rare they‚Äôre priceless and are only worth trades or massive amounts of caps. 
---
The person saying ‚Äúnothing is worth more than 10k‚Äù is out of their mind. I can make 10k in less than 1 day of playing. 
---
There are some weapons you wouldn‚Äôt find in 100 hours of play unless you got insanely lucky.
---
Caps are worthless except for Sheepsquatch, buying junk/ammo from players (which is cheap af) and fast traveling. If you want an insanely rare weapon, you need an insanely rare item to trade or you definitely need more than max caps. 
---
Legacy (Explosive Energy) weapons are overpriced due to the fact you literally can‚Äôt get them anymore, even though most aren‚Äôt that practically useful. But a 3* AAE Handmade? That‚Äôs one of the best guns in the game. It‚Äôs drop rate is *insanely* low. 
---
Pretty much no amount of caps is worth that, because it‚Äôs probably not going to drop again for you.
---
And way to blame typos on the keyboard, pretty millennial of you...
---
It's the markets. Caps are so easy to get nowadays. I sell TSE handmades for 13-15k. You just gotta be smart
---
GT TheGr8Nekodamus I got a 162 I can escort you with and a few around 25 I can play on, too
---
The 22 caps don't go to the other player, they disappear. That means there are less caps floating around, making them more scarce, thus more valuable.
---
Think of it like trading cards. It they keep producing the same cards forever, they lose their rarity and worth. The game will always produce caps, so they become less valuable over time unless there's a way to lessen the total amount
---
Imagine if Tesla sold their autopilot cars and they constantly drove off of the road.
---
Tesla fanboys would be like...... it's not a big deal really other cars have driven off the road. Just wait for the next update.
---
Sure, I'll give it to you for only 19k as soon as I found my replacement gun. ;-) Just kidding, I didn't pay more than 2.5k for it, but it will still work as a trade item.
---
Sure.we did them ultrafast but you xan join
---
I believe it‚Äôs in the build menu under wall decorations.
---
You made a valid complaint in a very shitty way and then doubled down on that shittyness by talking shit to almost everyone who commented, even the one's who's comments didnt need it
---
Didn't even mention the beta getting deleted from everyones PC
---
Actually yes, you were right. And sentinel is a legendary effect that reduces damage while standing still.
---
Supermutants drop caps. You can collect aound 200 to 400 in an hour.
---
impossible, its the way the game seps save files and al lthat jazz
---
I think some first time viewers of his channel are misinterpreting the rationale behind most of his videos. He's not really doing this out of malice or hate for the game or its fan-base. The whole video is structured mockumentary style and (Imo) it succeeds in dissecting said exploitative practices so well because all of his information is true and thoroughly backed up.
---
If you have seen the video, you would know he acknowledged the minority that enjoys the game. (He might be wrong about that, given the dogged enthusiasm of this sub's users in how they are down-voting comments that 'exposes' anything about Beth or Fo76.) Everything he said is researched and based off of what the vocal majority of this sub have complained about in the past. u/RyzaSaiko is right in the sense that it encourages active discussion in the community whilst hopefully preventing companies from devolving to similar practices for their future games. 
---
**tl**;**dr** : Point of the video wasn't to shit on the fanbase or game. Merely a reminder/glimpse of the grim phase it went through in its infancy due to deceptive and greedy operations. As to those saying 'just unsubscribe from this subreddit' or 'but we still enjoy the game!'. Yeah, we know. So does Bethesda. And the way I see it, if these is the behavior of fans moving forward in the gaming community, all of these will be repeated. No reason for them to stop if the backlash is a one and done deal and everyone goes back to loving them once the fiasco blows over.
---
Hell yeah brother!!!
---
Yes I sent an invitation and friend
---
...Bloodied Lever action is a highly in demand weapon lol. Not the best example
---
No duped weapons would mean a smaller supply, making the price per gun more expensive since they'd be that much rarer. Before duping was fixed everything was way cheaper. TSE shotgun? 1000 caps. 5000 shells to go with it? Free.
---
About combat having higher ballistic? And oh it's that legendary, that's pretty op right? How come you're going off it?
---
Yeah, I swap to the cryo on bosses in my heavy build.
---
Ah, just a suggestion for the future
---
wow!
---
I dont ever borher anymore, i dont even sell anything to vendors exept to get rid of stuff, you cant use caps on anything so why bother.
---
She sounds like an absolute boss and you‚Äôre definitely a very lucky guy. I‚Äôm in awe of her strength and you two appear to have the most amazing relationship, this has warmed my heart so much. Looks like your son is going to grow up to be a well mannered gentleman with so much love and strength in his heart and he‚Äôs going to make someone very lucky, just as you two have done so for one another. Your family is what I aspire to, Thankyou for being so rad üíú
---
(Sorry for being gushy, I‚Äôm a female, it‚Äôs in my nature)
---
That sounds awesome! I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to role play yet and have had very few encounters but that sounds amazing
---
Not really. Keep grinding.
---
There seemed to be a pattern before patch 8 where when I found my first explosive,  I was getting one in about 1:150; the uniform chance would have been 15% (chance of 2-3 drop) \* 25% (chance of a ranged drop) \* 11% (chance of an explosive effect) =&gt; 1:242. Since Patch 8, I've got only two explosive weapons out of 800 drops even though I'm stashing about 9 of them by now.
---
Some people are lucky.  However I spent around 500 caps travelling the server for days before I found one.  In retrospect you should pick a spot it appears then just bounce servers until it shows up.
---
This was on ImaginaryFallout and cant believe it was so low on likes.
---
No dude the AP refresh is solid.  Don‚Äôt get swindled, minimum 5k but I personally would post it and see what people offer, start it at 4K etc.
---
Make a new character. Make its name the same as the one you want to change. This will open up the name for the 1st one to be changed. Thank me later.
---
&gt; Mob-specific-Explosive weapons are on the same level as TSE and AAE.
---
No they aren‚Äôt, because that damage is Mob-specific, requiring multiple weapons. Many people are at the limit of their stash (at least until we can dump our legendaries next week). 
---
Running multiple sets right now is not very viable.
---
Honestly I just primed the Action Hero 50 cal they gave away last week and it works fine for a dedicated scirchbeast killer.
---
I love those little guys! It'd be cool to see a chinese prototype liberator the size of a house, shouting propaganda like a communist liberty prime.
---
Yes, Combat has better ballistic. And yes Sentinel is highly effective.. And I didn't mean I was getting rid of it, I meant I was basing my numbers off of it... But I was obviously misremembering.
---
Well consider another sold.
---
Love it!
---
I'm pretty defensive of the game cause I enjoyed it alot. But this reminds me that most of the hate the game.gets is pretty justified
---
First off. Don't be afraid to die. You're gonna do it a lot. If you think using a stimpack will get you through the fight,  use it. If not, save it and go back into the fight when you respawn. 
---
When you die, don't pick up any junk till you make it bag to your death bag. If you do the original death bag will disappear with all the junk you had before.
---
I killed one at cranberry bog. I just kept going round the car blasting it with my mini gun.
---
No worries, it takes a bit to get in the groove. 
---
Find a good spot with accessible water for your CAMP so you can make big boy water purifiers. 
---
A farm in your camp goes a long way, Melons are nice because they have water in them, but they take up some space.
---
Are you on PS4? I have a bunch of tips, and could toss some stuff in your CAMP to help get you started.
---
The early levels are a little tough, but it quickly eases up on those sorts of needs once you get a few nice perks.
---
Does this actually work?
---
Stealth crit shots, always be crouched and know when to back out of a fight. Sleeping in a bed will heal you so if you can make it to a bed use that instead of stims. Make sure to cook food it will last longer. Candoo perk is a great perk to help you find prewar food in trash cans that won't spoil. Make yourself a camp with a bed and water and food cook tables to help easier the burden. Fast travel to it is free. Kill wild animals as you see them, everything drops meat. Want more meat? Get butchers bounty in perception for a chance of extra meat.
---
Seriously? Wow I had three and gave two of them away to some lower levels asking on how to do a low health build cause I kept rounding them at vendors. Well guess I made their day lol
---
Great points
---
I guess.  I did encounter someone doing that in the shops at the Top of the World. But that's a place that sees a lot more traffic than that podunk disposal site. 
---
This was at the end of a VERY long session that began in the Bog, doing the Belly of the Beast quest. The game crashed on me three times since yesterday while doing it, which resets progress all the way back to the first relay.  I realized I'd never have enough ammo to finish at this rate so I decided to retreat back to Whitespring.....on foot.  Makes me wonder just how long s/he was tailing me! üòÜ
---
I wasn't sure what to expect honestly. I knew there were communities of people selling hard to find weapons for a lot but I hadn't personally seen anyone ask prices that high before üòÇ so I was curious if we were in the minority here thinking requiring mule accounts for trades is extreme and kinda silly.
---
Started melee shotgun and swapped to heavy because I think the style's so much more fun.
---
The game still hasn‚Äôt improved much despite the new (unreleased at launch) content. FPS is still terrible, latency is high, bugs are common and new ones keep appearing. It has been 6 months and so far I cant see any real improvements in optimization and player experience. I have 300 hours in this game and 900 hours in FO4. I still struggle with basic things like opening some menus or workshop repairs because of how tedious the process is.
---
Yeah, had TSE pump + TSE lever action for 8k. Just sold pump for 10k to first guy that offered, could be much more.  
---
Worst thing is 25k cap. Because i could sell atleast 30 good legendaries i got on my mules, but i am on bottlecap cap. If 100people sold all legendaries they have on mules, there would be egouth weapons rotating on shop to make it cheap.
---
Pick up all the meat you can, with a few wood scraps you can keep yourself fed. As for water I would collect dirty water &amp; boil it when your at the stove. Save stimpaks for when you‚Äôre desperate. They might seem in short supply now but you‚Äôll soon have enough once you gain a few levels. I would also suggest (when you can) diluting your stimpaks as to not waste them. Also I wouldn‚Äôt travel too far from the forest area as enemies will become increasingly harder to defeat. Take it slow &amp; take it all in
---
Just out of curiosity you know how much one goes for?
---
Yup. I trigger events every time I FT to Grafton, fort defiance, the power plants...you just need to go looking for a lot of them.
---
But the game doesn‚Äôt have a fixed amount of caps. It is always producing more via cap stashed, loot drops, and vendors. So how does this work with a currency that isn‚Äôt fixed? In a fixed economy I‚Äôd totally agree, but given this case - I‚Äôm having a hard time following your logic.
---
Tell me which comment that I replied negatively to that did not have a negative undertone to it before I replied.
---
The first aid perk in Intelligence does wonders for preserving stims, couple that with the perk chemist in Intelligence [craft double the meds] and super duper in Luck [30% chance to craft double what you just crafted, for free] then you can make 1 stimpak into 4 diluted stimpaks. 
---
There's a bunch of Brahmin in and around flatwoods to cook. 
---
There's also a bunch of mutfruit in the woods in the same area. 
---
Loot everything you think is valuable to scrap/bulk/sell for your daily 1400 vendor caps.
---
Invest in the perk Hard Bargain in charisma whenever you're able to lower buying prices and raise selling prices. 
---
First aid will make the diluted stims heal just like regular stims. 
---
Also, don't be afraid to eat spiked fruits and veggies, not meat though. Spoiled meat gives too much of a disease chance. 
---
If you make your way to WhiteSprings golf course there's a water fountain that cures your diseases for free on the back side of the tennis courts.

I like it better than survival mode, it's fun to know there's a hostile player in the area, and even better that there's someone else coming that you can't see

It's clear, we are not alone...

‚ÄúYou have contracted hiv‚Äù -2 endurance(45m)

Level? Either way, not much.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I'll try those on for size, perhaps adapting to a different play stile will not be so bad.
---
Yeah man I mean bloodied Lever alone is 5k+ probably. If that was BE it‚Äôd be a god roll.
---
But the game doesn‚Äôt have a fixed amount of caps. It is always producing more via cap stashes, loot drops, and vendors. So how does this work with a currency that isn‚Äôt fixed? In a fixed economy I‚Äôd totally agree, but given this case - I‚Äôm having a hard time following your logic.
---
Ahh......
---
The age old internet chat board straw man argument.
---
Attack spelling and wording instead of the substance.
---
I guess you're right.. time to lower my expectations and follow the defined meta. :)
---
Hes not talking about the tokens you get from the legendary vending machine, cause that's not out till the 7th. He's talking about the Camden park tokens. If you save up 450 of them you can get a full Mr fuzzy mascot outfit.
---
I sell for high prices when I really don't want to sell the item, not because it's worth that much. Randoms always walk up and  want to trade. They all request my quad explosive double barrel and my TSE handmade. I use them as my mains and don't really want to sell them, so I set the price to 10k+.
---
I accidentally found my tourist at the top of the light house near vault 76 the other day. Definitely luck as I wasn‚Äôt looking for her at all.
---
&gt;shit show of a launch
---
What makes you think this?
---
Thx!
---
Same, I‚Äôve only played in two matches, and it was a blast. Even more tense when you play in survival mode
---
Yes I can give you what ever serums you want cause right now I spent my caps on power armor plans
---
But I can go make my 20 caps that I spent on the object that was originally listed at 200 by raised to 222 for tax reasons by looting a grafton monster. There are never less caps in the game if the game is always producing more caps :|
---
For normal mobs you can use any weapon, even non-legendary and down it in 1-2 shots if it's a rifle.
---
Mob specific weapons are great for boss fights. SBQ, Imposter, Sheepsquatch. 
---
TSE is just a tad bit weaker than mob specific explosive weapons so if you're into min-maxing everything you'll want multiple sets. :)
---
And really, we can use logic here too. People love shitting on Bethesda but those guys aren't stupid enough to make a niche weapon weaker than a generalist weapon. Niche is stronger but only vs some very specific enemies. Generalist is strong, not as strong as the niche one but it works with all mobs. There are pros and cons. Its up to you to make a choice.
---
I would do it more if others players actually participated in it
---
People would probably cry if they knew how much good stuff I used to sell to vendors lol, never really did any trading so I just sold stuff to vendors or gave them away, not really knowing how good they really were
---
Stuff happens man just suck it up and move on
---
Just to amend what u/Chadodius has said, make sure when you sleep it is in a proper bed and not a floor matress as that can give you a disease.
---
If you're on XB I can help you get set up
---
Areas have minimum levels they scale to. Stick to the Forest for now, once you're level 15-20 you should be good to try out the Ash Heap and Toxic Valley, once you're 25-30 the rest of the map will be approachable, but the Mire and Cranberry Bog east of the divide are gonna be hard until like level 50ish. 
---
Public events often drop Stimpaks and RadAway as rewards, so it's always good to do them. Melee is pretty good in this game and will help lighten the burden on your ammo supply. Scrap excess weapons and armor to learn mods, so you can keep upgrading your stuff. You'll get a feel for inventory management and what junk is worth grabbing as you play more, but Adhesive, Ballistic Fiber, and Screws are junk items you should always pick up no matter how much you already have.
---
How many times are people going to repost this?
---
Yup, I got around 300 out of one just two days ago. People, please stop always assuming a nerf if you anecdotally experience worse drops or no legendaries at some location for one or two days (like EMS in Watoga).
---
Seeing how the cap limit is 25k, I‚Äôd say anyone wanting more than that for any weapon is out of their mind. Even with two characters with max caps it‚Äôs still a ridiculous concept to try to sell a single weapon for that much
---
One character can't hold more than 25k caps at a time. I've had a few tse weapons in my hands via random drop but my favorite weapon (a tse lever) I did buy from another player before the tse nerf for caps.

You share a link, then go on a rant about something totally different, of course you got downvoted.
---
You used the link and bloatfly thing as clickbait so you can lure people to read your opinion, of which most people don‚Äôt care about since you obviously don‚Äôt fully understand the game mechanics, that‚Äôs why you got downvoted.
---
Journey isn‚Äôt finished, more content to come.
---
What a shot!
---
At first, rifles seemed decent, when I was advancing through content, but when I got up to the big boys games, the sudden grim realization arrived. @UncieLeo, I'll try those perks, although I was not really a fan of the sniki snek approach. But hey.. learn, adapt, evolve - amiright?
---
Oh good point I kinda forgot as I'm usually in a rad suit anyways.
---
No, dont do it. I was trying to alt-f4 you. I believe it will delete your old character.
---
Shilling hard on bethesda, keep riding that dick

I think there's a challenge that lists the tapes?

Book shelves still make an okay bar top if you turn them around. Yeah the sign sucks so id be left with just the chairs and table, and thats too much for the price for me.
---
The over-inflated expectations of Obsidian fans in spite of Obsidian's own words, mostly. People are expecting it to be Fallout NV 2 (with no bugs) instead of a smaller, more linear RPG (with typical Obsidian bugs).
---
But some people are pretty upset over the Epic store, I guess.
---
Dumber shit I‚Äôve seen tbh
---
I only remember it because it seems so odd. This blood stained ruined matress is ok because it is off the floor but that other one will F*** you up!
---
Buy the serum plans from someone, make a bunch and sell 3 a day with buffs to collect the max caps from any one vendor. Do that each day. Also sell items to other players.
---
It‚Äôs to name saves they also use it for the Mr. Handys at the beginning of the game
---
it‚Äôs bugged. i‚Äôm trying to collect them all in order on my post-launch character though to see if it works like that.
---
Whatever they have sooner or later you will get by drop anyway. Be patient, take your time and enjoy the game.  I never bought anything from other players and probably never will. Im scavanger/grinder type of player.
---
I havent seen this posted before, and Im on here religiously. From the comments, a lot of people havent seen it.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Don‚Äôt kill your self trying to complete this mission. It doesn‚Äôt complete :) There are currently 18 Overseer holotapes and you get a cool 80 atoms when you find them. Just keep it open along with other things you are up to. Happy hunting :)
---
Ah yeah okay. It is meant to be the best though, according to fallout 4 and to the fallout 76 loading screen tips. Any idea why it happens not to be despite that?
---
ImaginaryFallout seems like it's a more quiet place, though it has a very large follower count.
---
Go back and read for yourself. Plain and simple youre being an asshole to some people who simply disagree with you and calling people names is fucking juvenile.
---
It used to have shit damage lmao ., they fixed it though
---
It's producing caps infinitely yes, this is just one way to remove some.  It won't end inflation on it's own, but it will do the job of removing caps from the economy.
---
Yes will do just that. I do hope Bethesda can improve their server stability soon. I don't hate the game anymore that much, but these issues kinda make me wee bit angry.
---
I was using the long metal cabinet and stools for my bar. I think 700 atoms was a decent deal for what you get. Its hard to buy this overpriced stuff when they cant get a sign right.
---
You **had**? What did you do with it? That is a legacy weapon that you are supposed to hold onto, quite invaluable.
---
Upvote
---
I wonder if uninstall/install would clear this. I am on Xbox. I was having a mess of weird problems got annoyed and rage uninstalled the game. After a day or two I missed playing so I reinstalled, and all the problems were gone. My character and inventory were as I left them, but I did lose all of my photos, so I would suggest screen shorting any of those that you like first.
---
I was actually also considering the commando build, but doesn't it also fall under the sad category of under-performing weapons? Or Handmade actually performs decently?
---
True but those can stack. Can‚Äôt have double the ability to breathe underwater.
---
Those mini nuka-cola bottles looks rather interesting.
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
oh i see thanks!
---
I think they are $396 each. I've been finding more lately out in the wasteland so I haven't bought any for awhile. My caps are maxed out so I don't mind buying cores if needed..
---
I still have it! It's actually my secondary weapon.
---
You keep on showing how stupid you are. I made a joke because you blame your own mistakes on a keyboard instead of taking responsibility for yourself, again very millennial of you.
---
It works for Jenner!
---
Thanks, I guess it's time to consider the sneak approach. I've been battling against it in my head, but if I want to use my rifles, I need to use necessary tactics.
---
You can pick up all of the components for an adhesive farm (corn, tato, mutfruit) outside of Morgantown Airport.
---
I'm waiting for armor penetration to actually work with energy damage, so that my Anti-Armor laser gun can finally be as good as it's meant to be.
---
So there wont be any other missions regarding this quest even if i collect them all ?
---
Quite interesting in regards to luck based perks. I'll give it a go. Thank you.
---
It's ma'am!!!
---
Id say adding more effects os the only way to get rid of the duping mess thst happend at launch. Making everything thats old not the meta anymore. For armors concern id say to even nerf it (cav/sent).
---
Wait, maybe I can dump my duplicate keys?
---
You just have to make another camera I would guess? You just need to server hop to find another corpse.
---
Yes that‚Äôs correct both are miniguns just different legendary effects, no card-swapping necessary
---
I use a vamp auto handmade and run it like a bloodied build. Adrenal reaction and nerd rage. I use vampire to keep me at top health during combat and healing factor when out of combat.
---
Yes, lazy losers, using real money they had to have jobs and careers for when they could be spending all their time being productive members of society by grinding for atoms... Wait.
---
I put some xannys in my punch bowl you‚Äôll never know where you‚Äôll end up!
---
For real. I want stoner items for my camp, but you can bet your bottom dollar that'll never happen. 
---
But booze? No problemo.
---
I hear you. I get requests for my tse lever all of the time!! Its been my main weapon for months now. I'm not selling itüòÇ strangely no one has ever asked for my 3*instigating dragon though and I've one shot level 80 deathclaws with that thing
---
My game kept crashing doing that quest. Then I learned you could just go straight to the glassed caverns and slip the tracking portion. Ugh.
---
By removing it from circulation. Fast travel costs, vending machine taxes, merchants not keeping caps you spend at them in their wallet, etc. It's the same reason most MMO/ARPG games have item durability, auction house fees, and fast travel fees. You either have to force the players to give up currency in some way, or have things they want that take currency.
---
Sorry i didn‚Äôt make it clear, i said i farmed those miniguns not traded. They are both miniguns so no need to change build mid-game.
---
If you can't find a way around that 25k limit, then these things should be trade only. 25k is less than 3 weeks. You'll never hit a god roll every 3 weeks of play. I don't get everyone circle jerking in this thread. If any of you have any god rolls you wanna sell me for 10k, I'll happily take them. This thread is full of guys that want to BUY god rolls for FAR less than their value and downvote anyone that says it's not realistic to their rarity.
---
Have you guys been playing a different game than me? Are you getting 3 star handmades and sentinel armour dropping like rain? The game I'm playing gives me 1 star wood armour and nocturnal rolling pins and syringers.
---
In the example that I provided where originally an item is listed at 200 but raised to 222 caps to figure in tax, the player who buys the object pays more and since the caps vanish - the player doesn‚Äôt get the full amount of value for what they spent. In order to combat this, the player who bought the item will be faced with a decision to print more caps: in this case by slaying a grafton monster in order to make their 20 caps back. 
---
So the prices remain high since people will continue to buy them at high prices since they will be able to print more money to make up for the loss of value. I dunno, all these armchair economists might have an argument in a fixed economy - but at this point we are working with Venezuelan money.
---
I wont be able to play this evening but I'll add you tomorrow
---
lol Ikr, it‚Äôs interesting that people refer to all explosive weapons as ‚ÄòTSE‚Äô while in fact the game provides tons of alternatives and some work even better
---
And the assault rifles they usually carry sell for about 20
---
I'll add you tomorrow
---
I will sleep with people for 50 caps so that they can get the improved buff. Guaranteed disease free.

I am now level 250, and I have found maybe eight or ten explosive weapons since the B.E.T.A.. No rhyme or reason to it, at least that's my perception. Some dropped in Whitesprings, some from events, some from random encounters. Like my most valuable find, a 3* BE Minigun (that I just traded for something more useful to me, so no requests, please): I was ready to log off for the day after some crafting at my camp deep in the Mire, when a lone 3* legendary supermutant and his hound waltzed in, begging to be killed. 
---
Couldn't believe my eyes when I looked at the loot he dropped.
---
Let's get balance into the game, or at least get everyone on the same playing field before anything new to pvp so that everyone can have fun, just not the duped running full ass/sent sets.
---
lol :D
---
I will save that info and re-think my relationship with rifles.
---
So far I've been hoping to still have an advantage with TSE gun + all rifle perks + maxed demo expert, but alas.. it's just the wrong type of weapon to be relying on with explosive gimmick.
---
The biggest impact won't be the 10% tax but the increased amount of competition due to more players vending.  I have a collected things I would like to sell that I wouldn't bother with the clumsy old method of selling.   Now, it should be much easier so theoretically more people will be selling.
---
that makes sense, I guess I was thinking since they had control of the supply the could dictate price fixing, since not too many other people had such great drops actually drop in game
---
yes, a long time ago. demo exert maxed out was dropped from +100 to +60% and the base explosive bonus was dropped from +100%  to +25%  (unsure if it is splash damage only, or all explosive damage)
---
Great! Now you can scrap them for the respective amounts of steel.
---
Savages. Only lead champagne for my guests.
---
Out of curiosity why would duping stop you from playing? It wouldn't have affected your gameplay experience I assume.
---
I needed 3.

What's yours look like?
---
Big time MMOs like WoW and EVE online affix a real world monetary value to their in game currency - this is what gives it value. But when you have an economy like this one - where there are many different servers and continuously prints money ad nauseam, I feel like the only way to improve the value of currency in our case is by making the currency more rare.
---
Seriously. I offer "the explosive kids"  2* AA Auto Grenade Launcher w dam resist while aiming for free and they turn it down because "it's not TSE"
---
I mean in the sense that I‚Äôm assuming you run heavy gun.     So with that combo for early and late fight how likely are you to solo the SBQ, and what‚Äôs an average length of battle?      
---
I‚Äôve been curious as to how well each build can handle her solo
---
Address pls?
---
I had two legendary ones at the same time. Every round for my hunters Gatling laser did the trick. And 30 diluted stim packs
---
So high rads low health?
---
Ouch. Time to find a new gun I guess lol. Thanks
---
I mean not right this second, but I don‚Äôt think the story is over for the Overseer.  I may not have that completely right, so you can probably search through this forum or on the interwebs to learn more.
---
Ok, I found 2 trying to find the 1 I knew of. Route 88 seems to have numerous. 
---
Here's the 2 I found, but there are probably more along this stretch of road.

How would you share loot and gold on a single console?  Can't you only log in one player at a time?
---
I can get a copy for twenty quid but have no one to play it with would it be worth it? Loved new Vegas but never really got into 4 so am cautious about this especially because of the launch stuff
---
Crafting booze is easy, search this forum for locations. As for leveling, it's about 1 every 30 mins for me, really depends on events. If you feel you are lacking Atoms, I am pretty sure you can just make a new character and get a ton.
---
Or ‚Äúbig mistake‚Äù debuff.
---
Yep.
---
Do you play on pc? Looking for some legendary rifles for my rifleman. Right now I have a 1 Star anti armor handmade that‚Äôs been treating me well, but I‚Äôm looking for something that shoots .308 or .45
---
That‚Äôs crazy! That sounds like a useful and viable launcher.      It would make mutants a lot easier to clear
---
Starts questline to find the cure in Magic Johnson‚Äôs bunker.
---
not really, the explosive prefix is still a strong one. but most of the "desired" builds are Bloodied Melee now, and a little bit of bloodied stealth sniping
---
Like the hair.  I might copy it of it's not copyrighted.....
---
The other benefit is that I can use a bloodied handmade when I am taking on a few or switch to vamp when overrun.
---
Yeah. Only 1 can be in game at a time. I meant xbox live gold. Meaning you dont need to pay for another subscription to have more than 5 charachters. Passing loot either requires a world box transfer or a friend to pass you the stuff
---
I managed to trigger it once but my server freaked out on me before I could finish off the squatch. Since then haven't found the cows to start it again in any of the spawn locations.
---
I have a 6 figure salary career, kids and I have easily maxed out my caps several times. Not to mention I'm sitting on 3900 Atoms all earned by simply playing . Your points are stupid.
---
Is this a troll job about fixing a turret camp at WS.
---
Well, that's a bit expensive. I bought a tse lever action some time ago for 750 caps! Might have been duped, thought.
---
Wish there was a heavy variant, not just sturdy. It will always lag behind.
---
Hey entitled gamer, stop trying to pretend you understand game design.
---
Don't hoard shit. Anything you don't use, sell. Junk, drugs, guns and armor... legendaries. Hell, go collect mutfruit and sell that.
---
I'm sure no one would mind and hell, even are eager for the possibility of bethesda games supporting co op. I don't see the need for actual multiplayer but co-op option would be a delight
---
Very cool! The bridge is awesome IRL. I‚Äôm sure people have mentioned Bridge Day dozens of times around here hun if you don‚Äôt know about it, it‚Äôs super cool and worth looking up.
---
I want the nuka shine one but I have no atoms and it‚Äôs gone in 2 days they remove stuff so quickly before I can afford it
---
The weapons are largely useless anyway.  Why would anyone pay piles of caps for weapons when there's almost nothing to do with them.
---
That's nice buddy
---
I'd really like to be able to give up workshops.
---
I thought character atoms where tied to your account?
---
Right next to the route 64 sign on the map due east of the Great √ñne‚Äôs light house.
---
Drive up the value by simply adding more sinks for that currency; force the player to spend more. 
---
The only fixed currency i'm aware of is bitcoin. Regular monies, dollars, euros, yuan, they're always being printed. It's just that the amount of printed currency is low &amp; heavily researched by their governments. 
---
And really, there was a hot post yesterday(?) about this subject. You could check that one.

---
Yay! Another ‚ÄúAn evil youtuber is attacking my favourite game!‚Äù post.
---
Yes and this is where I feel like prices will continue to be high, because the exchange of caps will be so much more common - reaching the max cap limit is going to happen really fast.  It‚Äôs going to be much easier to make money and spend money, but in the case of those who spend - they can sell or go off to print even more money.
---
And in the case of competition, there is no central market where I can go to view what price others are listing this item at so that I can charge competitively. No, my competition is dictated by other players in the server and not every server that is. So you are going to have a huge margin in price difference from server to server, and you are going to have players who buy things at exorbitant prices which will only encourage further price gouging. 
---
Anyways, let‚Äôs see how it all plays out - but I think the best thing to do in order to raise the value of caps to make it harder to print caps.
---
I fast travel to freddys bbq shack and that motel in in the mire like every hour or so usually triggers for me

Are turret camps considered poor etiquette? I‚Äôm just getting back to playing after a few months off, and I have my camp set up at the edge of the fence on the stream. I have like 5 missile turrets for SB attacks.

Every once in a while somebody always makes a post complaining about people or youtubers ‚Äúattacking‚Äù the game.
---
*Glances at Mole Man flare.*
---
It's still the same ranking as before, TSE is the best universal damage. The only way you will reach higher numbers is with specialized builds like low health bloodied, instigating against full hp, etc. It's just that TSE is no longer ten tiers above everything else
---
People are printing infinite money anyway, a tax is just one option to delete some of it. Otherwise caps will continue to be worth less and less.
---
You can stop shilling now, they aren't paying you for the privilege.
---
Damn that sucks. And it's a huge flaw if the camera gets scrapped
---
Just by playing, it doesn't actually take that long at all. TBH the biggest problem is the artificial limit on caps
---
I found [this](https://imgur.com/5wfxLFg) at whitespring. I couldn't pick it up, but yes, it's happening. I was able to store my camera in a box, because it was renamed and on the top of my list, and i didn't even notice.  I accidentally looted the same box twice, thinking who the hell is this sucker storing his camera. Turns out it was me.

They are, but it's often easier to level the first 10-20 than if you're over 200.
---
That might be the point, though.
---
Look at other MMOs.  I remember when I played WoW years ago when it started and it took forever to earn one gold piece.  I couldn't play all the time, so "forever" to me was like 24 hours stretched over weeks of play.  By then there were people who were able to grind all day who had  thousands of gold pieces.  So that's what the best items in the game cost.  There was no way I could ever catch up, save for quitting my job and playing 18 hours a day.  
---
But in FO76 I can make about 300 or so caps even at low level grinding.  The most expensive weapons are actually within sight.  That's a good thing!  I may actually get a BFFF someday.  After years of WoW I still never got Dark Iron anything...
---
Yesterday was a drink 10 alcohol, but any alcohol works, so you can just make and chug 10 beers. Go to Silva and Billings homesteads and you'll have more corn and razorgrain than you'll need.

Hover over the level up thing, it's not that you have to get 3 levels, you have to be doing 3 things when you level. Generally it's be a certain range of levels, in a certain area, wearing a certain thing. It's normally pretty easy.
---
Trust me, no one cried. I‚Äôve heard many stories of people finding god roll weapons in a vendor/trash can that someone dumped. You probly made someone‚Äôs day.

having finally gotten my hands on an assassins sent set, I agree- it‚Äôs too broken
---
Call me a noon and I know this isn't the point of the post but what's the significance of TSE?
---
Ive used a tse shotgun to someones face point blank and it did nothing.
---
Atom rewards are meta for the whole account not just one specific character
---
Well good to know if I ever reinstall I've got mad money in the bank. I've got TSE on pretty much everything (via trades and no lifing).
---
Turret camps at WS are, because people are trying to farm legendaries, and if your camp takes them all out before anyone can even shoot them it's kinda fucked up.
---
As long as you're not on the golf green anywhere, you're fine, it's mostly around the golf course that pisses people off.

Really? Why? Because they criticise your favourite game? Lol
---
That's about my level and length of play time. And about how many explosive drops I've had. Didn't see any till level 145, found a bunch in the last hundred levels. Never got any from whitesprings, didn't find one till I stopped going there.
---
Got my best one, a BE gatling laser, powering up Monogah in a nuke zone.
---
Photo synthesis seems to heals me really fast when in sunlight. It's a werid card since you have to be in the sun, not indoors but seems to still work even with enemies around. Cannibal is good too never go hungry. If you can get you hands a vampire swing speed.
---
It would be a good addition, but I would rather they not add in a mechanic to do so. It discourages replayability and makes your decisions less impactful.
---
&gt;And really, we can use logic here too. People love shitting on Bethesda but those guys aren't stupid enough to make a niche weapon weaker than a generalist weapon. Niche is stronger but only vs some very specific enemies. Generalist is strong, not as strong as the niche one but it works with all mobs. There are pros and cons. Its up to you to make a choice.
---
IMO niche Weapons seemclearly designed for raids/dungeons/boss events like Sheepsquatch where you are going to be faced with one type of enemy. 
---
Those basically do not exist yet, so there‚Äôs no demand. When content that makes them useful is released, they‚Äôll be in demand.
---

My problem is that everyone wants only to trade for gear that is so specific it hard to fing trades on top tier gear.

---
After nine hours? I would have been one of the skeletons!

As long as your weapon is out.
---
No dances
---
do you want it?
---
Right so the take away from this is to make printing caps harder if you want to drive up the value of the caps. Charging 10% only drives up the price of the item and encourages me to go print more caps in order to offset the extra money I had to pay on the item. If a item was intended to be sold at 200 caps and is listed at 222 to factor in tax, I‚Äôd just need to go slay a grafton monster - so no skin off my back I‚Äôll pay the extra caps. But if it was harder to replace that 22 caps, I‚Äôd probably be less apt to make the purchase - other players probably would too, and the seller would be forced to drop the price in order to complete the sale.
---
And do you really expect, that people will grind more to get back the money deleted by this fee? I dont think so...
---
Its not that its broken but that its creates such an astronomical advantage in comparison to just any other type of armor concerning pvp. We need more variety in legendary prefixes to create the rock/paper/scissors element to the game. Atm its either you got it and wreck or you dont got it and get dumped on. 
---
Thats personally why i give kudos to anyone who knowingly wears powerarmor or the scout/forest none legendary armor in pvp scenarios. Those players are specifically handicapping themselves for the greater good of the game. Kinda why i even started a new character completely devoted to pistols to show the huge disparity between the meta and everything else.
---
Still have that TSE Gatling? Lol I‚Äôll pay big caps for it
---
In video games, specifically RPGs, a Respec is a mechanic that allows you to "redo" all the level ups and skill points you've accrued on a character.
---
What's the prefix on your lever.  If you want to get rid of it I might buy it from you.
---
Definitely ridiculous the greed is unreal
---
I truly believe prices are starting to get crazy and we need to calm down and start really real validating the value of these guns cuz if you have to start having a mule to hold your caps it's just plain stupid
---
Ohhh yeah it‚Äôs sounds pretty useful
---
wrong sub bud ;)
---
No, because all they do is work to get clicks. If there's a controversy, they go totally negative because they know that's what people want to hear. If a game has massive praise and hype, they're going to be totally positive and disregard any possible negatives. I get that it is how they make money, but there are a lot of people who take everything they say as direct fact.
---
Have you tried looking up last people you met and see if you can reconnect to that same server.
---
No sorry I‚Äôm on xb1
---
It's not a bad idea to try and get niche weapons now, when they're cheap and everyone has a hard-on for TSE stuff. 
---
It's what i'm doing :D
---
Your caption cracks me up. Great picture!!
---
No they won‚Äôt be grinding it, it will happen naturally by playing the game. Getting caps is pretty damn easy, and even more so that selling to players is going to be easier than it ever was.
---
True. He is right. You can‚Äôt be too critical of the game on this sub, or else you‚Äôll be labelled as hater. Along with big evil youtubers! üò±

Don‚Äôt worry about the downvotes. This subs an echo chamber anyway. Lmao
---
Servers to me keep getting worse and worse, and its felt like that since the lying lowe quest was added in or w/e it was called. I've had couple of crashes or freezing, but I've also seen land not loading in properly like a super bright color instead, and recently I've noticed when it rains, that the raindrops are frozen in place in certain areas. Something is definitely wrong with the servers.

Ooops! Thanks, I didn't even notice! lol
---
That's the problem, and a tax is just one small way to slow it down. Without some method to delete caps from the economy they will continue to devalue.
---
Look at how EVE online handles their market - their 'caps' are called isk and is printed by killing npc bad guys. There are market transaction taxes and fees that help siphon some back but over time inflation continues. 
---
PLEX, the real cash currency, can be sold on the market for ISK after being bought from the dev with cash. The cash value of PLEX hasn't changed, although there are sales, so it's a pretty inflation proof way of storing wealth. 
---
The devs use sales of PLEX to help fight inflation as it encourages a drop in ISK price. While this doesn't delete isk, it is used to help manipulate the market to maintain a ideal ratio of dollar to PLEX to ISK balance.
---
You know what?  You're a good person.
---
Just avoid spending THAT much. Let them alone with their weapon.
---
yeah I've seen it happen a lot ;p
---
Says the loser who comments on a thread 62 days old.
---
In 500hours i did it 3times.
---
First one i won (but died cause last guy had last laught perk and droped plasma granade, if i wasn't so hungry on his junk, i may have it)
---
Second one was in middle of scorched earth event, vats was not working there and my target was guy with sentinel/assasin, i did zero damage to him, only melee did something, not much
---
Third was again sentinel/assasin guy. So no way i would join this godmode boizs.
---
Don‚Äôt sell it! Keep it, unlike nuclear codes keycards don‚Äôt expire
---
I think that's the only one.
---
Wait but usually when i have tried that there is never an option to join server, only to add as a friend, mute and such.
---
Caps dont mean anything when there are still duped items floating around. Not gonna call anyone out but i know of a person with over 1000 mutation plans because of duping and that person sells them for 1-2k caps a piece. So with that being said generally caps don't mean anything anymore. 
---
Most of the time people are selling trades and no caps since the market favors those who dupe, own legacy weapons or get lucky drops. 
---
Bethesda still should be removing duped items. Its still a huge problem that hurts the whole fallout community and economy.
---
Workshops can be dangerous. I do think they need to fix the exploit where someone can contest the workshop and then hunt you down on the other side of the map. And if anyone says that's just they way they are and to stop whining, you can fall through the earth, die, and lose your loot bag.
---
Anyways, I love grinding out workshop rewards, so my current MO is to claim the workshop, and then leave. I only come back for the retake event, since the defend event attracts too many scags.
---
Worked for me!
---
It can be. Some argue that it removes any sense of consequence. Fallout 3 didn't have any Respec mechanics, but that entire game was about making permanent choices so it made sense to not have a Respec option. Especially since gameplay mechanics we static since it was a local game and not online. On an online game, with a meta that's subject to change, the devs can nerf your entire play style overnight.
---
Might work out for you. 
---
Troubleshooter‚Äôs had a pretty huge price jump right after Imposter Sheesquatch dropped. Seems to have gone back down though. 
---
The raids is when they‚Äôll shine, that‚Äôs my bet.
---
I played WoW from release, (happy to admit I‚Äôm an old school geek lol) and the auction house worked really well. If implemented with a maximum cap limit that can be charged for a single item it could work really well.
---
You carry a good point
---
Bethesda is slowly trying to force the inflation to go down, the addition of scrip and 10% selling fee for payer vending are ways there combating this.
---
I sold a tee handmade for three guns and 500 caps, that‚Äôs seriously overpriced but if no one pays prices like that, prices drop
---
you'd probably enjoy watching paint dry then.
---
I've said it so many times, hard cap every damage, resist and bonus number on every weapon, armor perk and bonus in the game. Then it would be so much easier to maintain a balance AND difficulty. And they should remove every "percent" bonus from the game too, percent bonuses are so ridiculously strong.
---
Two shot explosive
---
sorry i just saw this. is it still available?
---
Apart from the fan base, everyone else regards this game as flop. Why would they say anything positive about it. Lol
---
Bethesda has only done so much to improve it since launch with their slow update cycle. The controversy isn‚Äôt anybody‚Äôs fault, but Bethesda.
---
Ie dont want to earn guns to compete.  Want to just have them like other pvp games.
---
Nope. 
---
You deleted the body of your post, like a chump, and i called you on it. You made some weak ass excuse about editing. The comments are still there. There is no point in having any conversation with you about anything. 
---
I never attacked nor said anything about spelling or grammer. You live in a fantasy world and i will leave you to it from now on
---
What are the rewards? What do you lose?
---
You will be poor until higher levels, just a thing.
---
This is still a major issue on atleast PS4. These server dc's happen quite often.
---
If they do cap sinks, I hope it's in a way that us semi-solo players don't get fucked by, lol. I haven't ever gone past 4k caps the whole time, I dunno how long it'd take me to get 25k...
---
0h, kewl
---
Yeah, it would seem like certain servers are slow. Most days, theres a delay from the moment I pick something up to where it is added to my inventory.
---
Then this is a good test of your creativity.
---
I believe it‚Äôs doable with heavy build and melee build (bloodied hooks can deliver insane amount of damage per hit, and that thing swings fast). In one occasion I was very close to soloing her, everyone in that particular fight was low level and got slaughtered by the waves of adds. I died several times too, but as soon as I respawned I kept firing at the queen and ignored everything else. A scorched mirelurk queen whacked me twice in a row. The challenge is really dealing with the mobs and the queen at the same time. In the end the queen was down to maybe 5% when the event failed. However the queen didn‚Äôt leave and came back to attack me, that‚Äôs when I finished her off, so I still got the loot (which was a pretty good piece of armor i believe). 
---
A couple of things I could‚Äôve done differently and the process ‚Äòcould‚Äô be different. I.E. I was using Tenderizer, maybe I should have used Lone Wanderer instead so I wouldn‚Äôt die so many times. Also I kept my health low since I was using a bloodied fire axe to one-shot enemies that get way too close (shooting explosive weapons at them = suicide), maybe keeping health high and using an instigating weapon is better choice? There are so many parameters can be tweaked and optimized which is part of this game.
---
Perk card, Pharma farma, chemist,   do the 1st couple of missions you get water purifier plans. After this you'll be overflowing with chems. .308 gun since the ammo for these seem to be plentiful.
---
I'm hoping it won't be the one shot pvp meta anymore. Every time I have been hunted down and killed over a workshop it has been by a TSE Shotgun.
---
the mission never ends, assuming more holotapes to be added later. new main quest line coming in the fall, could add more holotapes
---
Its just junk, man. Its laying on the ground everywhere. Spend a few minutes at sugar grove and you'll recoup your losses.
---
Still looking bro?
---
That would be awesome
---
With all this info I just managed to get knight CPT paint.  Thanks you all I‚Äôll keep grinding
---
I have a gun someone said I could get that much money for. I'm like, how would someone even pay me? They said they'd have to have mules/friends/guildmembers help them pay you. Holy cow I do not want to put anyone through that ffs
---
I've got a few hundred hours and have yet to RP as anything other than an asshole that shoots on sight
---
My guess is that they're going to be used as loot from future missions/events. They might be linked as well to the future scouts mission.
---
i am! and i‚Äôm online i‚Äôll PM you
---
If you are entering West Tech from the same doorway use the other one. There is the front door and there is a back door. I don't know if that will help but it may be worth the try.
---
1 thats an owl. 2 there are no more to find yet.
---
I‚Äôll never understand that! I was looking for trades for my vanguard build and the vendor was so surprise that  I had a 2 star explosive bloodied radium rifle, he was offering 20k for it. I thought we was insane üòÇ
---
That is an EXCELLENT shot. I... don't think you're wearing your dress correctly. ;)
---
I have a two shot hunting rifle. I'm getting tired of it if you want it you can have it (shoots 308)
---
Workshops are flagged as non building areas in regards to your personal camps.
---
What causes people to comment things like this?
---
I've been tuned into the hunter hunted station since I got the game and I've never had enough players join :(
---
because this game was ruined with duping at launch. i was selling guns for 40k when i quit this shit hole of a game 3w in so im surprised they are only 40k still.
---
My bloodied dragon usually takes it out in one shot.
---
This is exactly why I left the game. Content and all was good enough to keep me happy but the lack of stability ruins the experience every single time I have played. Out of 150 hours I disconnected or the server crashed at least once a day but often two or three times.
---
Oh damn, that's a long ass binge, your character's eyes seem to have burnt out from all that he's seen. I have a picture on the same couch actually: https://i.imgur.com/okjWWr3.png
---
It's such a nice couch.
---
I believe there is an option coming up in a future patch, hopefully soon, where something is going to happen with these levels you've already accumulated. There is a name for it, but that escapes me at this moment.
---
I didn't delete anything.
---
You're just a salty little bitch fanboy. You have no argument.
---
Explosives suck against players with the right builds
---
Whaaat?? Darn! Guess I've been wearing my dresses wrong for years üòÇüòÇ
---
But selling to player isn't the same thing like looting caps. You don't create more, you just transfer them between players. And this will delete 10% of that transfered gold.
---
Yep. got a base near it anyway. Xd, but still i hope in next update we get a boost to server stability on all platforms.
---
You lose just junk on adventure and the usual meds and other stuff on survival, but the real reward is the xp and the mountains of caps
---
I know right?? So jealous! üòú
---
This wins my award for best picture I've ever seen from this game. Even though he was retconned in, it only makes sense he was here when the brotherhood fought the first time. He didn't fight then. Now he's out for redemption.
---
It will probably still be one of the best general-purpose builds, but if you're looking for the best meta DPS gun it probably won't cut it any more. Also, isn't Two-Shot kinda worthless on shotguns anyway?
---
I paid a guy in fusion cores when i told him i didn't have enough caps he was asking for.
---
Bought a furious explosive minigun for 500 caps and 20 full fusion cores. 
---
I also bought a two shot explosive .44 revolver with treasure maps.
---
workshops must be reclaimed every single time you join a server. workshops are also PVP zones so if someone wants to they can flag PVP tear down your little base there, and kill you over and over again for free caps
---
Bear arms, heavy weapons, ordinance train foe ammo (I don‚Äôt use this on so don‚Äôt know how much use it actually is) and bloody mess. I have grenadier too for increased blast size but I genuinely don‚Äôt know if the increased blast radius on applies to throw grenades rather than launched.
---
Sorry some of this information is a little vague, hopefully someone will be able to fill in the gaps for you.
---
That‚Äôs not fixing a bug, that‚Äôs a nerf period. The TSE nerf made my shotguns way less powerful than before, yet they claim it‚Äôs doing the same damage as before so they have to ‚Äòfix it‚Äô. Looks to me they want to nerf shotguns because they pose a threat to their magic sent-ass armors.
---
Grenadier too I have heard.
---
All they have to do is make it easier to get 3* Supply and demand.
---
That's why the player shops tax is only 10%. 
---
Keep selling stuff to vendors and you'll reach that 25k cap in notime.
---
One easy way is to go to westtek, kill and loot everything, server hop a few times, then crawl back to whitesprings and sell all the rifles you looted. Walking while completely overloaded from west tek to whitesprings takes 12 minutes.
---
Your complacency is also part of the problem. You keep the game installed, log in regularly and play the game, that shows more to the devs than bitching about it on a non affiliated forum.
---
yeah the server issues really hurt the experience. Lets hope that this issue gets solved in the next major update that should happen this month?
---
That look alone can bring a deathclaw to its knees üëå
---
Ok, I have an X-01 jet pack mod, and the best I can do for calibrated shocks is T60, I do also have 1 each of optimized bracers X-01 and T60. It will be a bitsa PA set, bits of this, bits of that. But throw on a war rider paint job and you'll be the only one that knows. Apart from me, and anyone that follows reddit ;)
---
Prestige system past level 50 is what they promised us.  That should allow us the respec.  I hope for permanent perk cards with prestige.
---
I want to one shot a bully
---
Yes people sell for really high prices but there's more people offering outrageous amounts for stuff they really want, like 2-3 weeks ago I sold a lever action rifle for (check this out) 40k + BE lever + BE handmade + BE 10MM pistol + BE pump shotgun + 8 Rare different outfit, why? the guy wanted it and still I got more offers after I finished the auction on said item cause it got really out of hand, so many ask for alot and others are willing to pay alot more it's a thing go to trading subs or online communitys and see for your self...
---
Again you live in a fantasy world. Enjoy it in there
---
not to be a jerk but shotguns have been a sidearm for the longest time now. in pvp, they're mainly used to deal with invisible players. "pros" use handmades or autos in general.
---
I just keep reading posts about how "shotguns are op and oneshoot me all the time" when in reality you'd be oneshot regardless.
---
I support this.
---
and accept the contract. &gt;:)
---
now where do I sign in blood
---
I honestly fully support this. Even more so if it requires atoms
---
Not always the nearest location, sometimes its just a random location on the other half of the map requiring you to spend upwards to 30ish caps just to respawn.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre screwed (;
---
On a side note, I have also been playing since beta and am 157. I‚Äôm relieved to see that I‚Äôm not playing too much.
---
I've seen that at one of the train stations, not sure which one though.
---
Level 152, playing since beta and you expected an explosive railway rifle to cost 5k?
---
Here's how I view the value of an explosive weapon... you can make 10k per week selling stuff to vendor bots.  How many weeks of playing did it take for someone to loot that weapon? How many would you play for to get one?
---
Is there an issue with him?  Enforcer and some use of a vampire weapon let me walk away at full HP.  Way less threat the mirelurk queen.
---
Wow youre toxic and ignorant.
---
Oh cool, I didn‚Äôt realize that! Thank you!!
---
The 'no ones holding a gun to your head' defense hahaha
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
The fantasy world is where little girly armed men go to shit talk on the internet because they don't have the stones to do it in the real world.
---
In the real world people who disagree with you don't make disrespectful comments because in the real world that shit gets you a black eye.
---
Very Awesome, and the journal looks cool!
---
I can help you out with the framing part.
---
Take it to a framing store 
---
Pick out a frame 
---
Give them some dough
---
That help?
---
Keep lying then, pretty easy to see that the body of this post still says removed. Is that all you can do, call people fan boy?
---
 Sticks and stones...chump squad..sticks and stones
---
Spot on, on every point.
---
People defending this bullshit lmao.
---
Broke international sales laws (Christmas Bundles at 2400 atoms half price to 1200) then when they get called out set the price of the item to the REAL price of 1200.
---
Canvas Bag, the customer support levels, the misdirection and misadvertising. The scummy shit you'd be pissed off about in your regular day to day life but Bethesda gets a pass because your real life identity is tied to the Fallout brand. Fucking hell lmao.
---
Until people don't log in anymore.
---
I'm surprised more folks have utilized an alternative currency in the game, like bullets or stimpaks, in addition to caps. It would much easier deal with than maintaining a fleet of mules.
---
Oh no, I wasn't.
---
White springs, watoga, and top of the world are a easy 10 to 15min grind. And by the end of it you usually have enough stuff to sell to make that 1400, especially with hard bargain perk.  White spring grind the mines mole miners, watoga go a  PA run and loot the weapons on the floor, top of the world kill everything and pick up and sell all the outfits and ski swords.
---
Paying real money to swap from a full melee build to a rifleman build everytime you go to fight the queen, or encounter a scorchbeast in general, absolutely gives you an advantage over people who dont spend real money.  
---
Once you have all the perk cards you want xp is largely meaningless so you could swap all your SPECIAL points in and out of intelligence when you go to craft something, similarly charisma is only really useful when on a team or buying expensive plans/recipes.  In both of these examples being able to swap those SPECIAL points in and out instantly gives you an advantage over people who need to make a build and stick with it.
---
Maybe on PC but not on console, unless somebody had some magic hack method on xbox it had to be pure luck pulls. But one person would figure out a dupe method and maybe make 10 copies of something, then it would get sold to 10 more people who let's say maybe 4 would also learn that dupe method and make 10 more, so on and so on. Early days of the game had a lot more 3* Legendaries coming in from all those Whitesprings nuke zones. Maybe one in 1000 of those were turned into all those dupes.
---
I‚Äôm Looking to spend 50k caps on a tse shotgunüòÇü§£üòÇ
---
:) no I figured :)
---
If memory serves you need "makeshift warrior" at a high level to craft this mod. Is it possible that this is your problem ?
---
Everyone will just be running a bloody build now, the few that haven't already converted. I don't understand it, most of us have hundreds of hours in and have nothing to prove. I'm over explosive guns myself but we all use them because of how pathetic non explosive guns are. Everyone will now use 1 build the same 5 weapons and the same 2 armors.
---
Don‚Äôt work hard, be a drug dealer. Bulk materials are heavy and cost plastics to make. Just pick up the chems dropped by ghouls and also inside many rooms in WS, they are light and worth a lot at the vendor per pound.
---
What console are you on? I think I have an extra set of plans
---
Yea i'd love to have it! I miss using a long scope and frankly its not really smart to put one on a handmade if you like to ADS up close and personal like me. My ingame name is the same go ahead and add me and we'll link up next time i'm on. Its my birthday today so i'll be a little busy
---
They allow to respec without paying Atoms using caps instead. Since the make changes to perk cards that can cause problems with peoples builds. Or at the very least let us break up perk cards.
---
If you claim a workshop, you're open to PVP anywhere on the map.
---
I play it with my wife as well. We started at the same time I am level 28 she is still around level 12... Reason? 
---
She has spent almost every second since we reached level 10 building and changing her C.A.M.P :P
---
I usually give her materials when she is out and any plans i find that I already know lol
---
For rifles you really need to spec into luck for vats critical builds.  It's stacking that with stealth attacks that keeps them viable.  If you want to avoid vats then probably have to go into shotguns to abuse enforcer.
---
I don't even know how people come up with prices of things. I've got a couple dozen legendaries and it's awful trying to sell them. Now I know they aren't the best; but unless its a Two-Shot Explosive, no one is interested in anything.
---
YES. Once you claim a workshop you are fair game, anywhere on the map.
---
I'm pretty sure that claiming a workshop only puts you in PVP in the workshop zone itself
---
Thats exactly what you are doing. 
---
WOW.
---
 You truly are in a fantasy world.
---
For real this time Im done with you, say whatever bullshit you want.
---
 Can't believe how full of shit people are sometimes
---
If you have a workshop, anyone can try and claim it. This will automatically put you into pvp regardless of where you are on the map. Hope this helps.
---
No, it's more like "you're a dummy if you pay cash for something you can simply get free" defense. Only those who barely played or are simply mining for things to hate on keep returning to that moronic argument.
---
As soon as you claim a workshop, you slap a big target on yourself.
---
Happy birthday! I will make it a gift to you, and no rush. Will add you later today, you can come get it at your leisure ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That's a pretty stupid mechanic if it makes it where some schmuck can just walk up to and kill you at random
---
Kill npc and take their weapons to sell. Doesn't take long to accumulate caps. Even easier now that we only have to go to one vendor.
---
obviously you are wrong
---
No. Anywhere on the map. You could be at your camp and you'll be open to attack.
---
Yes... at least I think it is, it causes an AOE damage. I melt most low level enemies just being near them so it saves time on killing them and while not really good against higher levels it still causes some damage so it‚Äôs a minor damage buff.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs translated as poison damage as anything with low poison resistance takes more damage. Also it scales to how sick you are... with half or more of the diseases in game I melted a Gulper swarm. So until someone figures out the exact logistics of it I‚Äôd say it depends on your own opinion, or if you want all the mutations.
---
Electric/nuke explosion and plague walker mutations combined turn you into a freaking murder machine. Also heads up... Grounded cancels out almost all if not all damage to you from Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope.
---
I‚Äôm with you to a a point, but if that make major changes to you most useful perk(s) and you no longer wish to use it (them)?
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the answer.
---
Yet Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care shame on them
---
Is it any good as a shotgun? Does it benefit from shotgun perks?
---
If you want to be in that general area, but not be a bad neighbor, try the side near the snake on the map. There's a nice little pond, and no one will care about your turrets.
---
&gt; Explosive Shotgun Bug Fixes
---
We‚Äôre also implementing fixes for a pair of bugs affecting shotguns that have the explosive legendary effect. The first was causing them to deal double damage, rather than the 20% increase the explosive effect is intended to provide. The second issue was causing the Pip-Boy to display lower damage numbers than explosive shotguns were actually dealing to your targets. While these aren‚Äôt true balance changes, it‚Äôs important that we address these issues to bring more consistency to both the displayed and actual damage output of explosive shotguns. 
---
Sounds grim and I just switched to shotguns. Using TSE Pump Action.
---
"tier"
---
Yeah we call those the scum sucking bottom feeders.
---
I have six explosive weapons and about a dozen two shot after about 600hrs
---
Yah, lately it seems Non-Legends are dropping One StArs quite consistently too.
---
That's part of the risk of keeping and holding a resource that only one player can hold at a time. Be prepared for it.
---
That‚Äôs not griefing, that‚Äôs the chances you take when you take a workshop.
---
Workshops are fully PVP and anyone in a group contesting it can kill you.
---
Oh my..
---
Use disease cure... it‚Äôs tedious but it‚Äôs only active when you have a disease. Also getting diseases is easy so no biggy... take a dip and eat spoiled food and boom that‚Äôs three right there.
---
Only way to avoid paying that that is being on a team with someone!
---
Stealthboys are trash. If you use them offensively, you should feel bad about yourself
---
It's not random, it's people in a group that have contested your workshop.
---
The Dev team all ready know this bug pal
---
Yup. You got it. 
---
It's not hard to kill a grafton monster, but it's tedious.
---
We can use the same idea for fast traveling. You can go from point A to point B by walking, but it's tedious, slow, boring... but you can do it if you want to save a few extra caps.
---
Now you can kill a grafton monster, but i don't think you will do it for every item that's 200 caps just to get back that 10%
---
The fee can't be too high either or people will simply use the current trading system, and sell items at 0% tax instead of putting items in the vending machine. It need to be low enough so people won't care about it and they'll forget it, but high enough to slow down the natural inflation due to unlimited caps from mobs/events/etc.
---
Bethesda will have to work a lot on balancing the economy and i'm glad it's not my job...
---
And that's why I named my character "Creative Name," so if I ever want to go switch to a guy, I don't have to worry about the name being all wrong
---
Okay. I just havent played in a few days and hopped on and that happened so i was wondering.
---
As soon as you take ownership of a public workshop you are open to PVP everywhere on the map.
---
its a common griefing method, two people are in a group. 1 person claims someone else's workshop. the other goes to where they are. waits for the PVP flag to go up, and kills the person. either at their camp. or when they are out adventuring
---
I know it's not random. I've only had issues with players attacking me in workshops twice in six and a half months worth of playing and both of them directly told me they didnt care about the workshops, they just wanted to freely PVP for caps
---
God that's trash. That's what to much work for any one gun
---
Diseased overrides Legendary in the name.
---
Where'd you get an insect one?
---
 Getting my own shit is a big part of my game. Selling Legendaries to Wallace is another thing I really enjoy. 
---
 I bought a Level 45 Instigating Lever Action from him a long time ago, and as he's a neighbor he gets all my Legendary crap.
---
It is a pity they did not give us many details about the player vending feature.
---
IF the cap limit is still 25K, then it will be hard to find great weapons and armors for sale. Or rare outfits and plans, for the simple reason that you will lose money. I am not sure this is their way to try to deflate prices, but given they know about reddit, I already see it coming: vending machines for ammo and meds; Reddit for big things (which involve trading and not caps).
---
It's weird because you must be careful not to sell for more caps than yo ucurrently have. At the same time, you need lots of caps to buy in other CAMPs.
---
It was an owlet, I was mistaken
---
I have an instigating explosive handmade too, killed a three star glowing one in nuked WS, saw the weapon when the loot content popped up, pressed ‚Äòtake‚Äô and the game crashed lol. Logged back in and thank RNGesus my last click registered.
---
That's close to how it's happened. Only twice have people attacked me in workshops and both times were because they didnt want to go into survival mode. They just wanted easy PVP and easy caps
---
And if they do that people will get bored and stop playing Fallout 76 once they have all their desired 3* items.
---
Where's the fun in playing a game if there's nothing to achieve?
---
It didn't always happen that way. When the game was still new, dupers made a ton of money from selling duped weapons; not everyone was generous enough to sell items for cheap or free. They even could have just been selling duped items to vendors.
---
The trading prices went down when everyone realized duping was happening, but then have recently gone back up because of duping fixing and vendors sharing the cap pool.
---
People reached the top quickly when duping was going on, they've been able to keep their prices high because they mainly trade with others who did the same thing, or at least earned caps off duped items in some way or another.
---
I can't speak for every platform, but one of the top ps4 trading communities is full of people who got rich from dupes and have just been able to inflate prices because they know there's many others who also have a ton of caps, who got rich the same way, and would buy it
---
You‚Äôre lost.
---
WHO IS THIS GUY? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_nTpsv9PNqo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo)
---
Well, that‚Äôs your decision. Different people find fun in different things.
---
Best wishes!
---
I agree. Though bethesda cant seem to keep themselves out of hot water lately üò£
---
Ye, two shot is garbage on shotguns. 
---
AA or bloodied are far superior.
---
I've been meaning to test whether Instigaging works with shotguns, to see if the game calculates shotgun damage a single time as a sum of the pellets hit, or each individual pellet procs damage.
---
The former would be great with instigating, the latter, garbage.
---
Yeah not enough people are willing to accept that they just *don't need* that super top tier stuff. There's great guns put there that don't get a second look because that 2nd or 3rd effect isn't as good as one they insist on. 
---
Just the other day I pulled a 3* quad 10mm pistol, nice level 25 gun. Nobody would give even 1k for it because it doesn't have two shot or explosive or bloodied or what have you, but it's still a great gun!
---
Should be learned from scrapping, the chance to learn is listed as ‚Äúvery low‚Äù.
---
The vanilla wow economy really was an impressive thing. member how hard it was just to get 100ish gold.
---
I agree with breaking up our perk cards.  Once past level 50, it would be nice to have more flexibility in trying different attributes to our build without having to grind through several levels
---
Pretty much.
---
Do Leader of the Pack when you see it at the left hand upper side of your world map. 3 legendary weapons for your lvl in short time.
---
I'd pay 4000 or 5000 caps for a 3* weapon I want but even then, I have nothing to do with it but look at it.  If the game had meaningful late game content or raids, I might be more interested.
---
No, while I do need it to craft it, the option just isn't there to start with.
---
I‚Äôm surprised people are still charging that much for a TSE gun, before they patched duping people were just handing these things out like candy
---
Im on PC
---
&gt; There are never less caps in the game if the game is always producing more caps :| 
---
amount of caps produced per unit of time can be lessened by having some of the caps disappear in costs. that is, the rate at which the inflation is driven is dependent on the spending power of the currency and that is directly effected by things that remove currency from the circulation.
---
or to put it in a more simple way, it is precisely because currency is infinite that there needs to be ways in-game to remove some from circulation to prevent inflation (or at least reduce the rate of it).
---
this concept is called "gold sink" and has been used in pretty much all MMORPGs. World of Warcraft used to introduce very expensive mounts with every major patch, and all vendor costs and services with associated fees all served to reduce the rate at which currency was generated.
---
this thing doesn't really exist in real life economy because currency is not infinite in real life.
---
I would t count on it. They have been there since launch and I have to reason to believe that they will ever go away.
---
Issue with me or the sheepsquatch? Yeah the sheepsquatch got stuck on some rubble on the ground.
---
That's not true
---
Yeah, people are dicks. You pretty much have to go into hiding when you take a workshop.
---
Unfortunately owning a workshop is a flag to anyone wanting pvp in adventure mode. I appreciate it‚Äôs frustrating but with the exception completing challenges, I don‚Äôt really find workshop worth the effort.
---
This is just my personal opinion, others will definitely disagree.
---
So are you saying that the 80's and 90' didnt put out game breaking bugs. Because there are quite a few that were. It's just that today bugs can be patched and worked around though sometimes it takes time because code is a little more difficult to do as changing a line or two can cause bugs else where.
---
It sucks that games are being put out that are buggier than they should be.
---
See I‚Äôm 600h in game and didn‚Äôt know you can‚Äôt pick any scrap, before picking my bag. Always assumed someone made it b4 me.
---
I‚Äôll check that spot out, thanks for the tip! üòä

Wrong hole
---
Yeah, this quest has been unable to complete forever, it just keeps going and going. It's kinda awesome.
---
if that one is blinded with hate, then this one is blinded with positivity.
---
took you people months to admit to disappearing items because every single report was a "disinfo agent trying to gaslit the sub"
---
Did you find it at a power pylon north of the ranger station?
---
God this thread is a complete circle jerk
---
It's getting harder and harder to navigate all the crappy posts on this sub too
---
I know we're talking about 76, but another game I used to play was like that. Max money you could carry was 10bil, used to be 2.4bil. Then in storage max was 10bil, people would sell items for crazy amounts of $, you'd need several characters for some good weapons. Now all the good weapons cost real $ just because the sheer amount of $ you would need in game is insane. Everyone who's rich doesn't want the in game currency too much.
---
Joining now!
---
*finding* them is all luck. But there were a bunch of various flavors of TSE that were duped to high hell before they fixed duping, so there‚Äôs still a lot of those floating around.
---
If someone doesn‚Äôt want to sell their gun they might super price it just to discourage people from bothering them about it
---
I haven't gone over there myself, but it's a super cute spot for sure.
---
I don‚Äôt like to say people have ‚Äútoo much time on their hands‚Äù or need to ‚Äúget a life‚Äù...but...
---
I'd love to see that. There was a mod for fallout 4 that added a journal holotape, and the author wrote his own input for it since the game such a mechanic.
---
I'd love to see that in 76.
---
"printing" money takes time. generating currency in-game takes time. time required reduces the rate of inflation. by adding a 22 cap like you said, someone would now have to kill a grafton monster additionally, which would take time.
---
you may ask "but how is that different from the previous caps that were found?" (that also took time to 'print'); the thing is, this additional cost is removed entirely from circulation.
---
this means that, in the end, by the same amount of time, there is less caps generated than there would have been without a tax.
---
From what I understand, this can happen if nobody is around and a low-level player enters the area. If a high level is around this won't happen.
---
ohhhhh man that makes so much more sense. I feel dumb for not figuring it out sooner
---
I‚Äôll check later tonight
---
Max caps are 25k. How can you spend more than that?
---
 Fortunately in fact. That was a terrible mistake.
---
 I have a level 20 Quad Explosive Shotgun and it could do Whitespring when I was at level 28. All the ghouls dead. I can do that now but I'm level 88 and should be able to.
---
I'm interested in the jet pack and the one optimised bracer as I'm saving up for nukashine paintjob how much would that cost me?
---
Bear Arms for weight, Ordinance Express for ammo weight, Demo Expert for damage, Grenadier for explosion radius, Stabilized plus power armor for armor penetration.
---
I think that covers it.
---
It's REALLY good. Like I don't have any shotgun perks and it's still very powerful. Plus it came with the charging mod where you can charge it for more damage before a shot. 
---
And because it's instigating it does double damage if they're at full health.  I can only imagine how strong it would be if I maxed out on shotgun perks
---
500-2k depending on buyer imo
---
So it‚Äôs actually very simple
---
Loneliness
---
Yeah no. What's the penalty for someone snoting and taking your covers? Also you should get every disease they have. And lose food to mooching parasites.
---
It's been like that since the game came out. That's not a Fallout sub.
---
A blend of all of the above would be great lol, I‚Äôd like to see some larger new quests with gritty storylines to balance out the more fun activities like brewing.
---
THE MEME HAS BEEN REMOVED
---
For real. Bring mutation serums back. Made it worth it if you got the drop loaded properly.
---
Wow
---
Well that scks. Anyway get yourself a powerfist or deathclaw gauntlet it does more damage and weight less.
---
i know right? i dont like it so why would anyone else like it? opinions dont exist /s
---
Well it's 30- 40k now... but we all know the item level cap is going to increase to 55/60, so it's gonna be worth shit.
---
Give it another 6 months to a year... max level for items will be increased, probably right around when they do this legendary character business, whatever that's gonna be.
---
Given crafing cost/dmg of 40mm grenade round I would say there is no such thing as viable launcher. And im pretty sure AA doesn't aply to explosive dmg.
---
??
---
 There's that hookah in ESO. I always stopped and had a hoot with the Kajiit in Mournhold by the teleport.
---
 We could use one in this game for sure.
---
You need to think on a grander scale. 4k caps is nothing, on the trading markets good items sell for 10k+. Clearing out the vendors every day is a must, that's 1400 caps. Doing events and quests can get you another few hundred each day. Many people run multiple characters, you can have up to 5 per account, so that's 1400x 2/3/4/5 per day. Clearing out the vendors is the easy part, after that you can try to advertise your spare plans, legendaries, or services to earn caps from other players. If you know the market value of items you can easily make at least a few hundred caps at minimum off fairly easy to come by gear like 5.56 or 1* legendaries. But ofc that's more what you do once you've finished all the storyline stuff, which I'm guessing you're still doing at lvl 35.
---
Don't use stimpacks just die instead. Store all your junk. Build a camp with a bed, overseers camp has a plan for a bed. Sleep in the bed to heal up, free heal ups in your bed. If you can get sometime to build you a music instrument, that will help as well as you get the well tuned bonus and can complete challenges. Make sure you check out the daily and weekly challenges and complete them for free atoms.

There‚Äôs two main category of players, the ones who want all the money, items, shiny things, and collectibles. To be a walking steamroller, one shorting all enemies and being the games equivalent to a billionaire warlord. And they‚Äôll find every loophole and spend hundreds of hours grinding for it. 
---
Then there‚Äôs folks like me, who just kind kick around exploring, enjoying the atmosphere and getting immersed in the lore and environment. Sometimes I‚Äôll stop and think, oh...maybe I should sell some stuff or something... oh well.
---
Lost two weapons and a jacket myself, it's disheartening as hell.  I have a broken camera in my stash, can it be crafted into a new one?  If so I'll give it to you.
---
Mate, it's twitch. I can't trim it out, it was a continuous stream. There's also VOD mirrors that would show it. 
---
I was never trash talking the game, but sort of screaming into, for the lack of a better word, void, around the lack of actually meaningful content.
---
Your explanation of unfair advantage due to veteran-ship of 76 is irrelevant because of the actual tactics being employed.
---
I used a couple of healing items, scrounged around for meds, when fighting a horde of mobs I led them through a slightly narrower area to make sure I wasn't swamped. These are not insane, next level, specific, or exploitative tactics. In fact, they're not even that complex to begin with.
---
Your argument would have been more on point if you had argued I was a fucking synth lol.

I already had the lemonade recipes, but I had to buy a glass of lemonade anyway because the entire fight everybody on Discord (6 of us) was cheering on Mr. Squeeze's valiant assault.

Sunrise Field was good, thanks!
---
I first found out about the vendor change when I was in Grafton. I went crazy and stripped the town of every single thing that wasn‚Äôt nailed down and sold it to the Responder Protectron. Just made it to 1,400. Great day.
---
I play a paranoid, vagabond drug dealer.  I spec‚Äôd heavily into stealth oriented cards and got myself the chameleon mutation. I find groups (mainly), fast travel to them, sneak up on em, and then start with the shady, back alley talk. Lots of ‚Äúpssst, heys‚Äù and ‚Äúhey,yo, over here‚Äù and the like.  If they refuse my drugs, (especially the free first hit) I naturally suspect they‚Äôre narcs trying to bust me. There‚Äôs so many directions I can go from there. Sometimes I run away to hide, sometimes I pop a cap in em.  But it‚Äôs almost always funny.  
---
It‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had in a game in a while.
---
I found one of those in the whitesprings bunker in the brig area.

I don't really care, but the #1 direction the game should take is: Fix the Bugs!

Lol people are still playing this game!?

Found him at Tyler county sitting in a chair set up for like an audience. Gonna be playing for a while if anyone wants to join my server.
---
I‚Äôve seen that before too!
---
Comes up kinda regularly. It's done this since launch as a random encounter.
---
Workshops put you PvP, too, so be careful of that.
---
That's how I found my only 2 TSE weapons way back in the day lol. TSE shotgun in the suitcase outside Whitesprings station and TSE gatling in enclave vendor.
---
This. Pharma Farma is a great perk to pick at low levels. It's one of the first I go for with a new character. 
---
Also, around lvl 10 or so, head up to Morgantown Airport.  Lots of low level Scourged , two vendor bots as well. It's a good spot to farm low level guns to scrap for mods. Also has a small garden area right across from the station a little ways that has tatos, corn, pumpkin, and razorgrain.
---
Dude there are people on eBay selling in game equipment for real money and you are surprised that this is also a thing?
---
Yeah, it still happens too which surprised me a bit.  Found an Assassin's Explosive Vats fill Hunter's Rifle on a vendor the other day.  Could care less about the Assassin part but makes a pretty good gun for burning off .308  in the lower level areas.

I was laughing so hard at the fact he was literally tanking her and coming out victorious I had to pull out the camera mid-battle and snap of a bunch of pictures.

Sounds good to me. I'm here to play the game not listen to how much you think the game i'm playing sucks.

I'm not expecting the bed covers to be removable. I heard somewhere that bed covers in videogames are basically always static anyway.

What is snoting?

I would assume it would if you learned the bought plans as that's what the drops follow.
---
&gt; So what you're saying is, only post positive stuff and nothing negative in this sub?

You can be as negative as you want, as long as it's not negative about how much the game sucks that I'm here to talk about playing.
---
Lol two in a row. He's not talking about the Camden park tokens, they're called Mr Fuzzy tokens or something. He's talking about the generically named "token" that can be found in the laundry room in the outside maintenance/storage building at whitesprings where you find ghouls.

Afaik they don't have any purpose.

Go make your own echo chamber then plenty of that already on reddit so it won't be hard for you and your hard core buddy's to make one.

people want video proof before they run wild on a tangent?  HOW DARE THEY!

Sounds good I'll be on later tonight what's your Xbox name I'll message you when I'm on
---
Same as here QuakeSumo
---
I don't go to the generic Fallout sub much, but I'm gonna guess it's mostly that IH video that just released getting people on that train again.
---
Everything you said about there has applied to here at various times too. Real-world events happen, people react, and we see it in the quality of conversation in the community (i.e. how much it drowns out everything not directly related to \*insert current outrage here\*).
---
&gt; Go make your own echo chamber

Actually why don't you go found r/Fallout76sucks and you can put all that pent up sexual frustration in posts over there.
---
For me, I think it's holding down L3 to holster.
---
Start stacking points in strength as you‚Äôll need bear arms, heavy weapons and bandolier. Ammo usage is the only real drawback so super duper and the ammo production increase perk is a must (can‚Äôt recall the name but I‚Äôm sure someone will for you).
---
Still have that AA plasma? If so, what are you asking?
---
people wanted video proof of a very specific event that nobody knows how to recreate and would require everyone to be recording 100% of the time.
---
at the very least you could welcome the information and investigate at the issue instead of dismissing it as dissent.
---
and video proof has already been posted in case you didn't know.
---
I quit FO76 because of the economy in game, I dont want to have to grind 24/7 for gear so I'd rather trade for it. But with how over priced people sell gear sets for I gave up. Someone was trying to sell a set to me for 50k, I only have one character.
---
Oh I'm not against RP at all I'm just too self conscious to do any of it for some reason. I think it's totally awesome though
---
And then you have no game at all. So i take the atom shop vs no game

And this is exactly why people like you are halarious to watch you seem to have it stuck in your head that people just hate to hate not because bethseda churned out another buggy rushed POS.

Np.

There's a second one but can't remember name. Also sells the lemonade needed to craft the recipes.
---
Because eventually there will be 4 and 5 stars
---
&gt; I‚Äôm here to play the game

Then play the damn game and leave the sub, why are you even here? This place is for discussion related to the game, whether if it‚Äôs positive or negative. Im not even hating on the game right now, I‚Äôm just having issue with that mentality of yours as a whole.
---
Not trying to be a fan boi but this video is just feeding people misinformation, all the stuff that was broken/had problems has been fixed, he makes it sound like the game is still broken and the player base is dead

I don't get why people hate Fallout SO much that they have to make videos like this...

Oh! Cool lol. Well if you want to try it out sometime, I always try to get up ransoms with my characters. If you do want to RP, just add me: Penplateu35

oh im aware, but for "FT item vanishing" being so "rampant and widespread" it took that long before someone tried using shadowplay(goes back 30 min iirc) or xbox recording (goes back 5 minutes) to capture the fast travel caused one? seems like something id do the second my favorite wheel was thrown off.
---
I expected to pay about 5k after giving him a ton of plans for nothing... but yea I've purchased quite a few weapons from other players/vendors and I'd never seen or heard of them being that expensive. I can't imagine guns I'd like better than the two I'm using as my mains. I have a tse lever and an instigating dragon with bonus to criticals... but even if the game ate one of them (like my friends tse shotgun!) I still can't imagine getting separate mule characters as a work around the cap limit to trade for another one. I've met a few expensive traders but the majority of people I've come across in game have viewed things kinda similarly to me so the point of this post really was to get a more balanced perspective on the matter... see if I'm just in a bubble of chill players maybe? I personally think trades that require mule characters to facilitate are kinda silly and was curious how it was viewed amongst other people who play and care about this game.
---
So the thing about marine armor in this game is that it is by far the easiest high quality stealth armor to craft without investing caps into plans.
---
It has the most in world spawn points of any set of armor, and it's rare plans likewise are super easy to find. If you wander around in the mire and bog you will practically trip over marine armor plans if you know what to look for. 
---
A full set of ultra light marine armor is the best stealth armor you can get, and getting the full craft plans for it is easy, the other stealth armor is wood, which is uncraftable and has absolutely garbage resistances, but gets the shrouded mod which is the best stealth armor mod there is. This has to do with how weight effects sneak, and ultra light makes marine some of the lightest armor, and much lighter than heavy armors that compete with it's resistances. Other ultra light armors are also much harder to get your hands on.
---
So ultra-light, easy to craft and mod, good overall resistances
---
There are better armors, but they can be very hard to get, and even harder to get all the plans for to make the best quality items. If you aren't using legendary effects then marine is very decent until you get the "best" armor.
---
I've been searching for a TSE Handmade and so far can only find them for 40k caps OR 25-30$, the fact that people would sell a single item for that much is a bit whacky.
---
My friends gave me nuka cola to sell
---
Mostly yes. Some are harder to keep in ammo than others depending on the flux required but you get more bang for your buck. Most flux is easily farmable at Whitespring with the exception of violet which can be found by the ton in at least 3 regions. I tend to keep a regular weapon for farming low level areas etc. Just don't prime a combat rifle, they're bugged to the wrong ammo.
---
Dad? Is that you? After all these years...
---
I've heard of players selling a TSE Dragon for 30k. Not worth it.
---
On the flip side, I know of a very generous gun trader who has 15-20 people he knows who will buy and sell legendary items. Because he has such a wide customer base he can afford to sell them on the cheap. He's a real bro
---
&gt;At what point does something like this become old news and irrelevant?
---
Never. As long as they see there is still people enjoying the game, they will spit over it until everyone is as displeased as them. So, never.  
---
War never changes.
---
Why would they ban you because of this?
---
"I cannot believe I wasted so many bullets on that Scorchbeast" vs "Bethesda created a turd of a game fuck Fallout 76 I never got my canvas bag the game is terrible the players are idiots"
---
Oh, come on now... you know we are. What are you even doing in a 76 dedicated subreddit commenting that crap?
---
It was a lot, I wasn‚Äôt one of the people with TSE‚Äôs going crazy though, I didn‚Äôt hit level 50 until a few days before I got suspended
---
I'm having this problem, too. I even posted a thread asking if anyone wanted to exchange picture taking, and not a single nibble. :(
---
The problem is there shouldn‚Äôt be an echo chamber, a sub that only praise a game blindly is as bad as a sub that only exists to trash on a game. Discord should be welcomed as long as both side aren‚Äôt just throwing insults and are actually having discussions, even if said discussion might get a little bit heated.
---
Generally you'd want a recap of the events of what actually happened not what everyone thinks happened.
---
Okay, see you later then
---
Not to circle jerk Bethesda bashing, but is it actually anyone's job at Bethesda to balance the economy in 76? Cause it doesn't seem like that high of a priority to them
---
It's always dead, too. RIP. :(
---
I'm confused did you dupe that nuka cola or what?
---
I absolutely see your point; however doesn‚Äôt that explain the Level 9-22 ghouls that spawn (in more formal golfing attire no less) versus the bots that from what I recall were actually higher level than the golf attired ghouls?
---
I bought this game twice for the challenges and to store my items. Am I a idiotÔºü
---
Yeah, but if you have everything you have now chances are you'll take a break until 4 and 5 stars items are introduced...
---
Bethesda wants us to keep playing, they don't want us to take breaks...
---
As a percentage? No, sorry. Just run Uranium Fever a bunch, you‚Äôll have tons of gauntlets to scrap
---
He was probably a scammer.
---
Do the first trade and not do the second
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I chose the +3 STR because I have 3 mutations that are -1 STR so I wanted that extra point.
---
You know as much as I dislike what Fallout 76 is I do hope it makes a comeback like No Mans Sky did. Because I loved No Mans Sky when it came out and in its current form I love it even more.
---
What audio bug in particular? I use the 50 cal constantly, and haven‚Äôt noticed any audio bugs, besides it occasionally cutting out when the game loads in a new area.
---
Hahah I loved this
---
I don't have everything I should have now. I have almost no legendary armor of any star rating. And my guns are 1 or 2 stars. I'm sure there are plenty of people still striving to get something worthwhile.
---
Then you‚Äôre just focusing on the toxic negatives, there are ‚Äúnegative‚Äù comments that are legit or constructive, but your comments seems to imply that all negatives are toxic and none of them are warranted. That may not be your intention but that‚Äôs the vibe I‚Äôm getting.
---
They duped nuka cola, sold it to me for like 10 nuka/cap, then I sold it for like 5 nuka/cap on reddit/LFG, all we did was get max caps which I used to buy a low level suit of excavator power armor I could use then called it quits and now I don‚Äôt get to play my game ~5 months later

Get one of the perks that cripples limbs, the cargo bot's thrusters count as limbs, and crippling even just one of them grinds it to almost a halt.
---
Shotguns work best, damage doesn't matter to the perk, a 0 damage shot has the same chance to cripple, heavy weapons like the 50 cal and minigun with high attack rates are next best. If you are using a slow rate of fire weapon like a semi auto you have to aim for the thrusters, which can be tricky with how fast they move.
---
Yes thats what i said

I just enjoyed one shooting everything
---
I suppose yes that is what this video is. Still, I wanted to point out these things for the uninformed.
---
Hmm well that sucks but i understand why they banned you. Sure it's only caps but with caps you can buy better weapons and armor for pvp and that would be unfair. Also if no one was afraid of getting banned then more people would dupe stuff.
---
it only happens once to most people, and they were clearly not aware it was an issue since the information isn't widespread, so they weren't prepared for it.
---
your character also refreshes on login and fast travel, so it's perfectly possible lots of them didn't realize something was missing up until their next login, DAYS later, or that a piece of armor was missing much longer than 5, 15 or 30 minutes later because they were wearing clothing.
---
don't scrutinize everything because you're afraid of some imaginary boogeyman. that's the point. if people were more welcoming of these reports MONTHS ago, maybe the information would reach more players and they'd prepare for something like this happening.
---
As a guy who has never had more then 600 caps on him, i find this more hilarious then ridiculous
---
Good on you. The least you could do for the guy after that is too buy some damn lemonade.
---
I would like some more difficult dungeons, for sure. The silos are fairly easy if you have a full set of x-01 and have your perks optimized, so something harder than them would be nice. I would also love it if the new dungeons are doable solo, and don‚Äôt require more than one person to complete.
---
Yeah I definitely understand I should get a slap on the wrist or something, but at this point *give me my goddamn refund for the game I can‚Äôt play*
---
Not just an idiot but an idiot savant. You're like the brain exploding meme. I play on xbox but have 2 consoles in my house. You might be on to something
---
Big, big, big thing is to ensure you use the "stabilized" perk in your build. When you're in your PA you get +45% armor penetration and a nice boost to accuracy to heavy weapons. Noticeable DPS difference using this perk vs without.

You get the plans from quests added in the sheepsquatch questline. In Calvin‚Äôs office there are notes on the wall that start side quests that reward the plans. There are also some quests at certain locations that award plans.
---
The best \*\*\* items i have weapons/armour are all toss aways by other players that I purchased at vendors.  After 190 lvs and too many hours, I currently use just ONE \*\*\* legendary that I earned in battle (and even that wasn't what I wanted to have, its just the best for now).
---
My worry about the purveyor is that those toss away items by others won't find there way to vendors anymore, they will just be scrapped for scrip, and the chances of getting the thing that you most want will just become that much worse, as what the purveyor is selling hasn't yet been identified as being "good", just another chance to get something good.  
---
I know player vending might balance that a bit, but I like finding stuff that other players feel is toss away junk at vendors (I doubt any legendary items will find their way to other vendors once the scrapping machines go up) .... especially when every time you take on a level 90 something \*\*\* radscorpion, it drops a \*wooden leg.  I don't mind the grind, but I do wish the tougher the monster, that there is a guarantee  the better the loot.
---
you really don't need stuff like bandolier or bear arms. only ordinance express if you're using explosives, and even I could make do without it.
---
Im not a fan of having Crafting Perks and/or Food/Drink Perks in my permanent loadout (like powersmith or ammosmith / thirst quencher or dromedary), but thats personal preference i guess. However - what i can say is, that PA pieces protect the body part under it from damage, thus making adamantium skeleton pretty much useless for you :) oh yeah and like the one above me already mentioned, White knight only affects Non-PA armor.
---
Ah ok! I do appreciate it, its too bad there isn't somewhere we can turn them in for stuff...
---
but at least now I can get some more carry weight freed up
---
Wondering when they'll actually start to ship replacements.......
---
I don't see a need to increase the prices on things if you have that many caps, just pay/sell at normal prices but judt be rich so you don't have to even put a dip in your wallet, at least that's the way I'd go about it
---
With empath, players on your team take 25% less damage, the person with the mutation takes 33% more damage. If your entire team has empath, and you have a team of 4, you take 66% less damage.
---
If you‚Äôre having problems with food and water, get either dromedary or it‚Äôs food counterpart (I forget what it‚Äôs called). Green thumb and butchers bounty are also handy for getting more food.
---
No, your insecurities interpreted it that way. He made an argument and I countered it to prove he was incorrect. Take it which ever way you want.
---
That‚Äôs a cozy little echo chamber you got there.
---
I‚Äôve played it a bunch of times. It‚Äôs a fun little event and never ends in hard feelings.
---
The 10% is part of balancing the economy.
---
That 2000caps thingy for the imposter sheepsquatch is also part of the economy balance.
---
I do agree that we need even more caps sinks and hopefully they'll add more.
---
Whose job it is? I don't know, i'll assume it's the same people that are balancing weapon damage. They also have to fine-tune everything so it's taking a lot of time and some players will think they're not considering a high priority
---
I have seen ammo being used as currency more and more lately. Stimpacks are too heavy to be currency, but I've been wondering if bobby pins could be adopted as de facto gold, since they're rarer than caps and also weightless.
---
oh, forgot "," stop screeching. I obviously know what am i talking about. If you don't like rant, don't read
---
He had a lot of high cap 3* weapons. After we looked around his inventory we assumed he got a lot of his stuff during the duping era. No way to be sure but often if someone has over 12 tse weapons still in their inventory... it does cross my mindüòÅ
---
Hadn‚Äôt thought about that. I‚Äôve found some good stuff at vendors that others have sold cheap. But for me that has been pretty rare. Personally I‚Äôm more hopeful of being able to transform some of the items I have that are *almost* really good to actually really good. But I fully expect the first weeks/months with the LV to be a trial period that I hope will improve with feedback.
---
that mediocre looking borderlands clone that everyone is overhyping?
---
Apparently the golden 44 paint was released multiple times, so there's a possibility I'll bet.
---
A while ago energy weapons used to spawn as two-shot explosive. Bethesda said that energy weapons aren't allowed to go BOOM! so they removed the explosive effect from the loot table for energy weapons.
---
The lucky people who had a TSE energy weapon before that nerf got to keep it.
---
This means that there's a very limited supply of TSE energy guns so the prices are insane.
---
I got 58 in one last night.
---
SHITTERS FULL!!!!
---
I haven't seen a legendary robot in Watoga in weeks, and I've killed hundreds of robots.
---
I am a Chinese myself playing this game with a Chinese subtitle,so it never showed 'speaking Chinese'however the'Chinese'it speaks isnt so clear to me.I listen to it carefully for several times,and discussed with friends all we can understand is like 'for the people,for the country'.probably the voice isnot from a Chinese speaker.
---
Why does it matter if I don't want to hear people bitch about unimportant things like video games? I like how "echo chamber" is getting thrown around and making it seem like it is such a big deal that some of us are just tired of hearing people whine about a virtual world.
---
Same here I think it‚Äôs disgusting &amp; we need to do something as a community about it.. I‚Äôm 118, been playing since December so about around launch &amp; I don‚Äôt plan on making a mule. I don‚Äôt want a 2nd character especially just to store caps on him for trades like this.. if Bethesda raised the cap limit (which I doubt) then these trades wouldn‚Äôt be an issue but the fact that people are charging over the freaking cap limit FOR ONE gun is ridiculous. For a full SET of unyielding or some shit then yeah maybe over 25k but one goddamn gun..? At that point I‚Äôd rather PayPal the loser $5 &amp; make him shut up
---
I'm hoping player vending machines will help with this redistribution.  I know a lot of players discard stuff I like (my favourite current gear comes from vendors) ... and the best stuff I have won in fights, I don't want, but I keep hoping to find someone that does want it.  (Set your prices low folks ..... we all want the best gear for the way we want to play... it benefits us all to just make the best stuff available and move it quickly).
---
Depends on the player for those; I have 60K 50 cal, 40K 5mm, and little over 900 40mm along with 5 different weapons... I couldn't move without those perks since my stash is used for junk and a few extra aid items.
---
People not playing it still commenting in the games Reddit too. ü§î
---
&gt;insecurities 
---
ü§î you sure?
---
&gt;He made an argument and I countered it to prove he was incorrect.
---
except you didn't prove anything. you said some things without proof and said it was fact.
---
People are still striving to get something worthwhile only because it's so hard to get something worthwhile. If god tier 3* items were easier to get people would get bored.
---
Really? I carry my 2 shot auto grenade launcher, action hero mg, vampire.50 mg, 2 shot minigun, aa lmg and daisy cutter fo a weight of around 10.  Which is around the weight of a sidearm.
---
PBS did a [fantastic documentary](https://youtu.be/VTji1k67Gdk) about this as part of their American Experience series if anyone wants to learn more about company towns/stores, the Battle of Blair Mountain, and WV coal mining history in general.
---
Got any advice on what to replace the crafting and appetite perks with? I got myself talked into Replacing White Knight with the Starched Gene's perk. Gunsmith and Power Smith I figured would be a necessity for crafting and modifying PA and weapons.
---
I'm pretty sure I can craft the things, I'll have to check later.
---
I really don't think player vending is the gear solution. High value gear will stay on trading sites, with people hoping to get their own dream gear. Caps just aren't valuable enough to use as currency really. I was hoping legendary vendor currency would make the new economy, but they killed that outright.
---
You can create a 'mule' character to carry extra items or caps some players I know have 4-5 extra characters just for trading or buying
---
It comes back occasionally, was on the Atom shop a couple weeks ago (originally came out in.. December I think?) Just keep an eye on the store mate
---
Will tomorrow
---
Yes, thank you for this!
---
It made servers incredibly laggy
---
Pal just keep the stuff for tickets for Tuesday's update
---
If you think assassin sentinel is making people invincible unkillable gods, you don't know what you are talking about. Missing "," wouldn't save that sentence.
---
Personally, I'd like to change my characters to "heavy gunner, sniper, mule, commando" instead of their current names "alt 1, alt 2, alt 3 and alt 4"
---
 Thanks I didn't know alot of that.
---
I like the Gaming Historians content, and while people crapping on 76 did annoy me at first and for awhile I not only defended it to people but actively tried to convince them to give it a try at this point I no longer care. it's a really fun game and I will continue to play it for far too long, so that's all that matters for me.
---
Super mutants have no genders. the FEV mutated them into lacking no private parts.
---
I wondered the same thing about skyrim how there are no female giants
---
I started rifle then decided to switch to heavy.
---
Indeed
---
Yep, I'm pretty sure. He made a broad statement that people who have careers and money purchase fake goods for real cash because they don't have time to grind. I proved that not to be the case by example. Enough said.
---
I just talked about inflation in a different thread, this is why the player based economy needs a lot of help
---
I just went to the Whitesprings hotel lobby bar and bought myself all his booze.
---
Either way I think rather than one-off quests or bits of story, it should add interesting game mechanics and game systems (supported by lore).
---
I've seen a few tse dragons and put offers on them but none for the right price just yetüòÅ I'm not sure if I'd like one better than the 3*instigating I already have so I haven't been willing to drop the big caps on one... big caps for me means like 10k üòÇ I haven't even heard of this 30k stuff before yesterday
---
depends on the weapon, ones that spew ammo in seconds.. no. ones that fire one shot at a time, maybe
---
example Minigun prime is not a good investment due to the ammo spent being much quicker, while prime gatling gun is a good investment due to single shot higher damage
---
I guess it's like Melodicmutiny said, it depends on the player. I can barely fit all the damage/survivability perks I'd like since I minmax, and I usually only carry 3 weapons and 10K bullets on me.
---
I also don't pick anything up except worthwhile legendaries. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't sacrifice things you absolutely want *just* for weight reduction.
---
And the friends we made along the way
---
I don't think blackbird was back. was it?
---
Player vending is going to flop unless they raise the cap limit. The people with the largest number of good legendaries are already at the cap limit.
---
I've lost multiple power armor pieces as well. it's so incredibly frustrating. especially when people act like this doesn't happen. it sucks and the bug or coding causing gear to disappear needs to be fixed.
---
i could recraft mine but I had to buy plans to mod them again. I can't find a jet pack for my xo1 armor YET and can't imagine I'd put it on and actually use it for fear of losing it and trying to get that mod for again more months...
---
my power armor pieces were atom shop painted too when they disappeared.
---
Yeah, and it still doesn't do enough for the .50. That 35 degree angle is after perks.
---
Its gotta be possible. You can name your characters the same names as other people. They're not unique identifiers, so that means there must be some other unique ID associated with my character or i could randomly log into someone elses "steve".
---
your journal was awesome, congrats on getting recognition from Bethesda. also I had no idea there was a real Sheepsquatch poster!
---
You're recommending gear that's unrealistic for people to have, and gear that's explicitly not required. That's why you're being criticized.
---
Yes the prices are crazy high, because there is *limited availability* of these high-end weapons. When they were being duped 3-4 months ago a TSE Handmade would still sell for 20-25k. After TSE's were nerfed, the prices dropped and maybe 5k would buy that same weapon. Then AAE and B/E then became the new god-tier weapon class, and because of the fixes to duping exploits, the prices went ballistic again. Someone on the Fo76 Discord I trade on wanted 75K for a B/E Guass rifle. Most people there will not sell any weapons like this for *any amount of caps*, and the same goes for armor such as assassin/sentinel, assassin/cavalier and unyielding/sentinel etc. They will only trade for items of equal value. It's like this because of the *extremely* low drop rate of these weapons and armor, and let's face it Bethesda is not going to change that any time soon.
---
Nope.
---
Sorry but you can only go so far with the outer things like walls and such..
---
this happens with tech data all the time when I log in or fast travel... and poof - it's gone and you wasted you time getting it because it can't be looted from the ground...
---
Nukashine is equally good, just flashy versus matte
---
Side question, as I have never camped there before:
---
Do the nuke drops damage your camp if it is there? I am usually not in normal blast zones.
---
&gt; Not once does he mention atoms can easily be aquired by playing the game.
---
Kinda makes the 500 atoms they offered as a band-aid for the bag even more of a joke.
---
Do events in the ash heap and cranberry bog, these can reward you with the marine tactical helmet plan.
---
1 plastic, 1 glass, 3 rubber, weighs 0.1, sells easily for 20-30 caps depending on perks. It is by far the most profitable use of junk you can build.
---
Also, if you can craft any sort of clothing that sells it usually is worth more than the bulk junk.
---
Aside from that, silver, gold, antiseptic, and circuitry are quite easy to find and sell as individual items. Make sure to always take silverware from tables, there is a surprising amount that most people overlook
---
[](/kcelestiastare)Runs a ton better than launch for me, course with PC you never know what parts have weird problems, but I haven't seen too many complaints lately.  
---
As for bad loot, I have over a  thousand pounds of legendary equipment making me hobble across the wastes that I've accrued in the last 48 hours(with max weight reduction perks for all weapon types).  
---
I can't speak for enemy AI as a whole, it's hit or miss, I've seen plenty of enemies just stare into the void while I walk up to them, and I've also been outmaneuvered by some of the enemy types from time to time.
---
I have all the megazines,most bobbleheads and many toy models( protectron,eyebot etc). After those i'll try to arrange crazy scenes with bears.
---
Wasn't it meant to be 5 months?
---
Isn't the channel supposed to be satirical?
---
I was expecting a more mmorpgesque(?) Game where it would be much farther into the future than the other games and all races had sections on the map and you could choose between say; human, ghoul, synth, mutant. Each would have upsides and downsides with humans being the boring in-between jack of all trades like in all other MMOs.
---
Ghouls could be squishy but fast with high radiation protection.
---
Mutants would have the same radiation resist as should but be a stronger, hardier, much dumber race.
---
Synths would be high intelligence and sturdy but low strength possibly.
---
Humans would be all rounders with high charisma.
---
Skill checks would still happen
---
You could even make it so you could choose between what kind of ghoul you are such as feral or none feral, what gen synth you are, and those could effect that characters charisma score. 
---
Maybe even make it so each race has a negative or positive charisma modifier depending on who or what is talking to them.
---
It would be cool.
---
They can identify as what ever gender they want. Check out past fallout games
---
Put a landmine at your feet, there is a 100% chance they will pop up, especially if it is a nuke or plasma mine.
---
They can be some of the most frustrating and fun enemies in the game, the run so fast, and then circle around you, and when you seem to have them down, they somehow always fly out over a cliff edge so you still have to go hunting after! 
---
I find a Gatling gun with +50 limb damage and targeting the rockets is the best to slow them down. If you can get 2 they slow down significantly.  All 4 and they just stop.
---
[](/kcelestiabeam)My Giddyup Buttercup herd will blot out the sun!
---
Best advice I got for managing hunger and thirst is corn. Lots and lots of corn. Make that into corn soup boom hunger and thirst covered.
---
I'm with you! I only trade plans with players.
---
Its very YMMV. Depends how much you farm for ammo, and nuke zones
---
Counterarguement for minigun prime: When you have 50k+ 5mm UC ammo, and only use the minigun on the queen anyway, its perfectly fine to prime (especially since she tends to go down in &lt; 5 minutes with all the cryolators and Endangerol -25% DR debuff syringers around).
---
Very YMMV. I personally recommend having a non prime weapon for standard mob killing, and a prime weapon for bosses/sb/queens/pvp.
---
Nothing wrong with not participating in the trading markets. Its not about hoarding caps for those of us that do though. Its about the stuff we can buy from other players with those caps
---
I sell random 1 and 2 stars to vendors.
---
The folks at Bethesda definitely got the better end of the deal, even though they sent you some great stuff. That signed poster is excellent.
---
An amazing journal you put together.
---
okay but did you tell him you had 15 Charisma with the Hard Bargain perk?
---
I do it as well. I don‚Äôt care for keeping a one star level 10 bloody hatchet, for instance.
---
There are a few 3 stars I am keeping though, for when the legendary vendor is added
---
Stay dead until the workshop is taken from you. Otherwise, you will remain hostile on respawn. This use to work differently. You could respawn and remain non hostile while someone was taking your workshop, but there was some exploit/bug where you could contest out of combat preventing the attacker from ever winning the workshop.
---
The most interactions I have with other players are if I‚Äôm dropping off excess ammo or scrap that I don‚Äôt need to free up my stash.
---
Don't inject your filthy politics into this game.
---
It was a reference to a YouTuber. He plays on PS4 and the situation in question happened at Whitespring at the golf shop. It might have been you. Look for "Clown Daddy - Bullying the Bullies."
---
But, if you need today's camera challenges, we can do them. :)
---
I'm not sure honestly, I've never built in a drop zone. I think the initial blast does, but not subsequent radiation. Could be wrong though.
---
The spot I mentioned doesn't normally seem to be in the circle. So unless they miss, it should be safe enough.
---
I was mostly going by a cost of ammo per how much damage each individual shot does. the Gatling gun rack does roughly double the base damage of that of a minigun per bullet spent. Don't get me wrong though I do like to use a minigun but I prefer to use a regular 5 mm for it
---
It was on once.
---
People can put any price they want on an item.  The problem is selling it.  I'd spend maybe 10k for a really, really good gun.  The problem is that the players that have the really good guns aren't looking for caps 99% of the time.  They typically deal in trades.
---
I have no problem with mule characters so long as they don't cause server issues.
---
So far it hasn‚Äôt, no. I‚Äôm think I‚Äôm just on the outside edge of the blast radius, if I‚Äôm remembering right. (But I haven‚Äôt caught a nuke being dropped there since I was playing in late December/January so I could be wrong on that.)
---
Personally, I'm gonna stock a room full of Nuka Cola merchandise, (hoping we can also place power armor frames, I'm gonna do that), but finally having a place to put my 50 bottles of nuka cola that ive rangled over time
---
Maybe an ancestor or Goris?
---
For real, how many popular youtubers are going to make massively misleading videos about this game?
---
The majority of people already believe all this shit. They genuinely believe the game hasn't received an update in months and Bethesda ignore the bugs and just add new player vending or outfits.
---
A new meta weapon. I hope bethesda stealth adds this on Tuesday
---
She looks SO CUTE
---
Give me an example of clickbait from his recent videos.
---
‚ÄúHungry on his junk,‚Äù title of your sex tape!
---
Fanboy being a derogatory term? Sure. Actually, you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôd expect Fallout to have even MORE bugs being a larger game with more systems that interact with each other.
---
&gt; Never defend a workshop. You're basically walking into a trap when you travel there
---
It doesn't matter whether you try to defend or not. As soon as someone starts contesting, you can be sniped no matter where you are on the map.
---
This happens to me all the time. If I own a workshop, someone will come find me on the map, sit in stealth, and as soon as their partner starts contesting, they oneshot me before the contest message even comes up.
---
I don't even bother taking workshops anymore, because I know I'll get ganked within 5 minutes.
---
I also had to post here to get someone. Fortunately one responded and we did them fast,mostly because i have cryptids next to my camp.
---
Before that i asked about 15 people on ps4 and it was a disaster. I only asked people 150+ and none of them had the camera,really? Is the camera so rare? Apparently yes. The rest of them had incoming messages blocked ,like the eremitic  cunts they are.
---
Ignore the people saying this is a "Dev Room" item. The plan for it spawns every once and awhile in the Cranberry Bog area. It takes a few minutes of searching in Google to confirm that the plans spawn. Idk why people haven't realized this yet...
---
I know, I'm just theorizing that may be one of the reasons they werent able to do it
---
Oh, yeah--good point on that. I'll probably just keep my Morgantown-adjacent camp for now. Definitely not leveled up enough to deal with frequent scorchbeasts.
---
That's how rare it is.
---
I've been saving to buy the mutation plans. Any word if worht it?
---
I sell Chems /clothing/junk for caps. Drop decent legendaries in overseers box .drop most of them where I find them
---
Yeah this is why I have ruled out ever trading for anything. I only have one character, I manged to get a couple of decent 1 star guns for my character in between all the shitty wood armour drops. I came to the realisation it's pointless me farming for anything better because all i'd use them for would be to potentially make farming easier. It's just a cycle of redundancy.  I've just been hoarding all the 2-3 star things i've been picking up for the legendary vendor, see if I can get even a 2 star combat rifle or shotgun. That would be a step up, but again I just don't know what the point is when i've exhausted the quests and there's no reason to kill anything.
---
Marcus from fallout 2 would like to have a word with you
---
I loved his Fyre Festival and Rainfurrest vids but these just seem too hasty for the Historian
---
I've got 2 psn accounts because I wanted some extra characters for player vending and trying different builds. Comes in handy for these challenges as I borrow my brother's ps4 to do them. I did leave a char afk dressed as a raider next to Rose yesterday for as long as possible.
---
Hey there, we can do it and other daily too. IGN:emreyigit93
---
The higher level you get, the worse this is. I haven't taken a workshop in months because every time I do, I'm ganked within minutes because of this exploit.
---
Yep! First number is with perks, second is without. I only have one weapon with 90% weight reduction.
---
 AA Gatling gun 2.16 (21.6), I M79 0.72 (7.2), TS 50 2.07 (20.7), TS AGL w 90% red 0.18 (1.8), TS minigun 2.61 (26.1). With how fast the three two shot weapons break, I almost have to carry that gatling.  Instigating M79 is 100% for fun against trash mobs.
---
Ammo is the big "wtf" numbers. 60,617 .50 cal 60.6 (303!), 930 40mm 18.6 (186), and 37864 5mm 3 (37.9).
---
I could get away without having bear arms, but I like having a lot of free weight available when I farm.
---
The only weapon in Fo76 to have this effect is bugged so i really hope they fix it if it is added to the legendary drop pool.
---
Also wanted to point out just in case that I don't hate the video or him but some stuff here is misinformation
---
I bet you are fun at parties
---
I think the immobility to rejoin servers is a way to avoid exploiters doing their thing, but I agree regardless
---
I alway off load what I don't need to keep my weight and stash down looking forward to the legendary venders.
---
NP
---
if you are interested, some plan spawn locations that spawn marine armor relatively often and are very close together are
---
bog town (has 3 different spots they can be)
---
Pylon v-13 (rarer, often spawns weapons plans instead)
---
Drop site c2
---
The quarry nearby (rare)
---
All the maps for cranberry bog have decent drop chances.
---
mac's farm (random rare)
---
I've also found it consistently at the radio station north of generals steakhouse in the mire. A lot of random plan spawns in cranberry bog will drop it fairly often as most plans below level 35 don't spawn there, and marine armor is the only armor that's level 35
---
Same, at least until the new vendor gets here.
---
Thanks! That‚Äôs great to know.  Does ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù vs respawn play into that mix?
---
I sell trash 1stars but I keep the bloodied/2S/explosive/assassins/cavalier/sentinel even if they‚Äôre 1 star unless it‚Äôs like a 2S walking cane that‚Äôs trash no matter what you have on it.
---
YEs, Just YEs! lol
---
my explosive bloodied MG does 350 at 20 health with all those perks. Can get it up to 400 but my pack rat is more useful :p
---
I was just in the shop a sec ago and it displays items you've already purchased, but in the same section, must have mistook it for a re-release as I didn't know this happened, sorry lads! Wasn't trying to mislead anyone
---
I read just fine, stop making idiotic assumptions.  You people just don't know when to quit.
---
I guess you could say the bar was set too low
---
The wendigo looks like my mother in law üòÅ.
---
Imagine how much effort it would take to recode all the places in the game where it displays your characters name....
---
It only says it on the pip boy and the menu...
---
And what happens?  TWO player photos today... sigh...
---
Glad I have enough social anxiety that I'll probably never engage with this part of the game. Seems annoying
---
I have a possible reason why it cannot be changed, when you create a character (a new save) the name you make becomes permanent because it is translated into hex code. Darksouls 3 uses this system for character creation, if the bit of hex code that has the name is modified, it becomes corrupted and unusable, It may be a similar system with 76 orrrrrrrr Bethesda are just lazy and not creative enough with a "name change" feature implemented yet.
---
I think the video focuses too much on the rocky launch but the game is still hella fun
---
We're actually already friends, so I'll join you.
---
nah i got 168 from one yesterday.
---
imo it's the game giving you an incentive to get out of your comfort zone and try to socialize, like with the camera challenges that require coordinating with another player. Don't want to play with anyone else or participate in PVP, that's fine, but you're limiting yourself on the dailies and weeklies you can complete. At least these challenges aren't afaik bugged or impossible to complete (and are probably easier to do than the ones that require you to make one of every alcohol or something like that).
---
Yea, if not any time then a 1 time only card to change it
---
Hes is not the hero we deserve, but what we need...
---
And we also need that refreshing glass of lemonade
---
What's going to happen to the tse shotguns then next patch?.
---
No problem, hope you find a cool pet.
---
Somebody killed you in sentinel? Well, looks like it needs some skill after all
---

---
Assassin's Sentinel will still rule. They'll still be able to jump in place and take out other players. 
---
What it *could* do is allow other players to get closer and have a fighting chance. Right now it's rare for a lot of folks to get a shot in. (Cue "lulz I can take em out")
---
I expect Gatlings will jump in value.
---
Yes, percent damage is not for this game, as well as armor ignoring perk. What's the point of armor if people can just ignore it?
---
Yeah, I carry tens of thousands of rounds with bandolier, it may not necessarily be the most effective way to play but I really enjoy it.

Yeah, I was being sarcastic
---
Nah, fallout is in "okay" state right now
---
Where are they
---
Ah, shouldn‚Äôt take too long though, cmon it‚Äôs Bethesda.
---
I have a theory that the camera attempts to register all entities within a spherical range before displaying what it sees in frame. In high-density areas, I can't ever seem to get the camera to register, or even take a picture of anything.
---
My solution? Genocide. As long as everything in the area is dead and I'm not in combat, the camera works flawlessly and instantly.
---
Just make sure the Queen, King, and Spawn all die close to one another so you can get them all in frame.
---
Honestly I would never spend more than 15k on any single given weapon or armor piece. No matter how good the roll was. I'd encourage anyone who actively trades or buys to do the same.
---
Oh my god, commies taken over this place! Run!
---
It‚Äôs well presented - as you would expect from TIH.
---
The actual hunter x hunter is rarely active so this one pretty much has no chance.
---
how did they nerf assassins sentinel?
---
Ah yes. I think it was server disconnects for me. But I wasn't aware of the duping problem at the time. I just thought it was game issues.
---
Quite a bit I imagine.  I am interested in it if you figure out a value.
---
I dont think so lol but ill check it out
---
Right up the road South of Abbie‚Äôs bunker
---
Came across 3 today and I jumped on a van or building roof that's when serindipity worked a treat.
---
I mean, he's not wrong.
---
They didn't.
---
People generally agree that NMS is good now. FO76 is still a cash grab shitheap lmao.
---
Oh nice then! :)
---
People stopped playing when they reduced the caps loss, IMO.
---
They shouldnt be able to jump, it kinda goes against the whole "Standing still and not moving" part.
---
Agreed.
---
Very cool!!
---
That‚Äôs amazing, yes Instigating is super powerful. The tesla always intrigued me because you can switch it between rifle and shotgun at the weapons‚Äô bench.
---
You will have this and a quest to kill a wendigo for the foreseeable existence of your character.
---
I unsubbed a long time ago to that one
---
another one to the unsub list
---
I swear to god if I click this link and...
---
That's why I run a bloodied build with my lever action as it helps killing them gutsys
---
I feel like it‚Äôs gotten really bad recently.
---
Selling legendaries is not efficient. Heavy guns and give with and guns with scopes are the most valuable for selling. Legendaries mostly can just hit the ground without any concern.
---
Why does he have a Deku Scrub pelvis?
---
I sell all the 1 and 2 stars legendaries i find to vendors. 3 stars are trickier: if they have some market,i try to sell them here on reddit.
---
If my 3 stars have no market or i cannot manage to sell them, i sell them to the dining bot at whitespring restaurant ,because i don't want them to go to someone for no effort.
---
You win a vote this time Gadget, Good job, Kinda jelly, Will probably build a tanker to trump your boat. none the Less inspired by you and your floating device! take my UPVOTE!
---
Just relocated there, love it! Thank you again!
---
IS THERE SOMEONE WHO NEEDS ME TO SQUEEZE THEIR ASS?!
---
I sorry emote would be helpful with this as I've done it a few times now.
---
They all share a pool of 1400 caps which resets daily, 20 hours from your first transaction with a/any vendor.
---
Yeah, it caused absolute chaos
---
For workshop PVP, revenge and respawn do not matter. You will remain hostile as long as the workshop is being contested. The only difference is revenge puts you randomly nearby while respawn lets you choose. Respawn is great if you have a protected fast travel mat inside the workshop.
---
For duels outside of workshops, hostility ends when you choose respawn. Revenge keeps you in the fight. I think a teammate can force you into PVP if they choose revenge and you choose respawn though. Everyone would need to choose respawn to end the conflict.
---
They're just kids trying to be spoiled and greedy. Even if they don't sound like kids, they are. They use voice changers to try and trick you into stop calling them squeakers
---
As progamer all challenges are anoying last 2months. (Noob progamer)
---
And whole endgame is anoying, still i am doing it all. Is it love?
---
[](/celestiahappy)I would love a taming overhaul. It almost feels vestigial, or left in by accident in it's current state. Even if we can't fix the current system a way to at least replace them would be nice. Maybe the option to buy pets from a store to give caps some value again? I'd pay top dollar for a pet Hermit Crab.
---
Someone I was already friends with for some trade or another actually responded, so yay!
---
Sweet, thanks! :)
---
I've never seen that mod in all the time I've played the game at any vender.
---
Dang, I thought all factions had a seperate pool of caps. Thanks though!
---
Yay! Glad you like it. :)
---
What does RNG stand for? I see it and I think Run N Gun...
---
That‚Äôs where you leave the bunker, find the silos elevators hidden in sheds/buildings... just google a map if you‚Äôve not got them on yours yet Sites Alpha, Bravo and Charlie... good luck..! üëçüèª
---
Oh look here‚Äôs one from two days ago. https://youtu.be/ACWbqUaeAco
---
I think the toilets are for leaving...to my knowledge, until you launch one ..you can't go in that way....you have to go to the actual launch areas (silos?) and take the elevator down.
---
Sure your gun isn‚Äôt instigating?
---
I played since launch but didn't actively search online for forums or on YouTube so a lot of that news came on the back end for me.
---
Not anymore.
---
I bought one from a vender then learned it was from the Dev room so I scrapped it now I can make them.
---
Hi,the same happened to me the first time.
---
The bathroom is the exit door,can't go inside that way.
---
The best thing U can do is head Silo Alpha,it's in a lake and the only building there is were You need to go,inside the elevator.
---
Hope I helped You.
---
I do not have the 'patients' to argue with ya.
---
Because he pointed out that Bethesda tried to fuck everyone in like, 20 different ways?
---
bloodied
---
Some of these are crazy strong, but I would be all over a rifle with extra sneak attack damage, extra headshot damage or a small chance for a cryo/slow effect.  An instigating/sneak attack hunting rifle would be my grail gun.
---
Tactician would be really OP when coupled with Vats perks, low health perks and adrenal reaction, plus adrenaline and better criticals perks.
---
Stabilized seems kinda crazy too, especially on an automatic weapon.  furious/stabilized would be quite a combo, especially when adding perks on top of it.  
---
Overall, I think you've got a bunch of good ideas here.
---
I played it for 15 minutes to do a challenge that didn't involve leaving my base...
---
Thanks, stay safe out there, people.
---
My best deals have come from.randomn people.
---
Its convenient he puts out a video regurgitating the same nonsense as everyone else several months after the fact when he can get the best audience.
---
I appear to have offended a stan.
---
Now if we could take physical pictures with the camera and drop them into a paper bag for others then sending nudes would be possible. Dirty underwear nudes at least.
---
I‚Äôve had mine hit several times but mainly with my lever. I haven‚Äôt really tried it much with auto. I believe it still does it. It just might not give the notice in the top right.
---
Trying to read the title gave me stage 5 autism
---
Good, adios, tata and run along.
---
LOL.  I just ignore it completely.  I don't need atoms that badly.
---
I think you mean "insert caps to continue"
---
Also as a mostly solo and non-pvp player i feel your pain . If you're on xbox and have a Mic add me and I'll help ya with those kind of daily challenges.  Gt: KillzR
---
You're welcome and thank you too! :) Also wendigo cave was genius, I was totally forgot it.^^
---
 I can do that now with a knife. ;)
---
When are you available to do the combat armor ?....let me know I‚Äôm on most nights
---
Considered gambling so not gonna happen
---
you would then curse others üòü
---
Is that any diffrent from every other game that has 20 dollar skins.
---
You had shit like chivarly charging 20 for a mace.
---
you have very low standards
---
Buying mutation serum plans is an investment. If you think you will be making more than 4 of the serum or just want piece of mind having something permanently available. If I had to suggest 3 they would be marsupial, speed demon, and adrenal reaction.
---
Use a gamma gun or radium rifle, melts right through the ass/sent guys, especially if they are bloodied.
---
Noticed this the moment event dailies became a thing. :(
---
 All Combat Armors will take the BoS mod. It adds a lot to the Ballistic and Energy numbers. Its by far the best mod for those Armors.
---
Who will be the first cap-ionaire?
---
I get that some items require more work to produce due to resource management and all but seriously, the prices are too damn high. It's stupid ridiculous.
---
Might want to save 2+ star trash since they get you more scripts for minimal weight.
---
A flying SheepSquatch would be cool and twice the size.
---
Time to romance other players
---
You have to aim, aiming makes all.the bullets fly straight. If you fire from the hip they just go everywhere, even worse if it's two shot.
---
Sorry i guess? I was using my mic to type
---
I've found light, medium and heavy pieces before with the Boss mod of it. I've personally only crafted it on heavy stuff before, but I assumed you could do it to all of them.
---
My Blood Gatling gun thanks people like you.
---
Yeah you are still crouched but he knows where you are, you just put a bullet into him. ;)
---
I saw a Bethesda boi post that they were fixing it next patch on another thread complaining about losing theirs.
---
Does the chainsaw benefit from any melee perk cards?
---
I guess I would appreciate my funds more if I didn't get so many good/decent combos... I found 4-5 vangaurd/bolstering with either AP refresh or Cavalier just this week, and I always find atleast 2-3 decent guns when I grind out legendaries.
---
Yeah, it doesnt happen *every time* I take a workshop but its happened enough to be annoying, especially when Im level 170ish so Im losing 170ish caps per death
---
Yep marsupial, adrenal, and twisted muscles, speed deamon seem like good sellers. Always can sell a marsupial serum random lower level players  for give or take 1k and the flux isn't too bad one nuked white spring can get you 2 marsupial, 4 speed deamons 1 twisted muscle and 1adrenal probably more. And if it's sbq you can make 2 excavator calibrated shocks Wich sell well also.
---
Any pieces can, if your on PS4 add me, I‚Äôll do it for you for free., just supply material. Wmcg204
---
I was able to put BOS on light combat.
---
Yeah, he talks about the big problem in the video. What Fallout YouTubers do you like, I bet I could show you some apparent clickbait strait from their channel.
---
I sell plenty of legendaries if they don‚Äôt fit my build or what I‚Äôm after
---
I've only gotten a change to play it once, but I actually really like the game mode. I wish more people would play it.
---
I sell stuff sometimes, if people offer me more than I think it's worth, I tell them. I would rather lose thousands of caps than mugging people off and feeling bad about it
---
Like kit fisto?
---
I sell all of them to vendors if I can (the ones I don't want) in case someone else actually wants them. 99% of them are useless stats to me and not worth trading.
---
There's been a few times I bought some from Whitesprings craft area vendor.
---
FEV makes Super Mutants sterile. Tabitha and Lily from New Vegas are examples of females turned into Super Mutants. I think Bethesda didn‚Äôt include female Super Mutants in 76 because they‚Äôd work better as NPCs you could actually talk to, and not some random enemy to kill
---
I would like more I'm screwed moments. Like a big hole and nothing to hide behind and a bunch of sheep squatch. Or a place with lots of terrents fireing explosive bullets.
---
What platform are you playing on? Also if I ever made my base into a bar I‚Äôm gonna call it ‚ÄúThe Hemsworth Arms‚Äù in reference to a friend of mine who is obsessed with the arms of Chris Hemsworth as Thor.
---
Being British ‚ÄúThe Hemsworth Arms‚Äù sounds like a perfectly plausible name for a pub. Feel free to use it.
---
Earning it means getting an appropriately rewarding drop from an appropriately tough monster ...... not the same low probability random crap from radroach vs. a deathclaw.
---
Mine is still active in my data tab, but not bugged.
---
Strange
---
Just going to point out flash sales and disappearing atom store items cause a need to purchase atoms in some scenarios. Yes the argument stands that you don't have to have whatever it is to play, but the argument also stands that you shouldn't have to buy something that is already loaded into a game you paid money for.
---
it *really* sucks if it's stuff you can't just recraft ... and people still downvote anyone that even asks or tries to report it. why?
---
I'm sorry this happened to you. I understand your frustrations and I hope at the least Bethesda will fix this so it doesn't keep happening. 
---
it's probably too much to ask that they actually replace these things - I would not know how to even ticket as i cant find an option.
---
To be fair, Kel-tec is well known and infamous for bringing wacky, impractical ideas to life, and their reputation as a quality manufacturer is not good, to put it gently.
---
The fireball coming out of the muzzle of that thing must be insane, and you can probably hear it from 100 miles away.
---
Bethesda's article says through May 7th.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales
---
Hell yeah pls! With tons of added new itens for the camp we really need a budget increase, encouraging ppl to keep buying them. I really wanna buy some itens to add to my camp but cant take it off many of them already in,  so ....
---
If its got a red countdown box then itll be gone till it gets released again.
---
Hey, could I get Electrically Charged, Herbivore, Healing Factor, Grounded, Scaly Skin, and Speed Demon?  
---
IGN: Spiratic
---
Pretty bad comparison. Very rarely was an item you could buy actually the best, maybe temporarily before raids came out or a specific crafted trinket. But the vast majority of your gear came from a specific boss that you could farm for, a huge improvement for making sets.
---
Bloody builds are very powerful.  perks like nerd rage and emergency protocalls on power armor help keep you alive at low health.
---
Challenges have been annoying since Nukashire. These very specific picture ones are ultra annoying though. At first it was just outfits which I've gotten lucky on when I could eventually find someone with mic on and drop a bag for them for a photoshoot. But now they want me to annoy strangers further by making them fast travel to a specific location + wear outfit. It's like Bethesda sees us actually still manage to complete them so they get upset and stack more requirements on top. The close friends I do have that own the game I really don't want to annoying them everyday asking them to log on for a bizarre daily request either, just stop being weird with these dailies, please. ;o
---
They can't.  I submitted a ticket yesterday, I got a response today saying they don't have the tools available to replace the lost items :/
---
It terrifies me that I see more and more of these trickling in and they get no traction at all.
---
Use a suppressor on your weapon and Chameleon and you'll score the stealth bonus on every hit. I do it with my lever action and handmade.
---
Me too. Do you know how long it took me to get the hunters long coat to spawn on that vendor? For. Ever. Plus I could never get the science scribe outfit as a reward, a friend of mine had to give it to me. I'm incredibly hurt right now.
---
Dude... Have you even gone on to see his actual YouTube channel and the content Internet Historian makes? He is in no way a news channel.
---
/u LedyDevann
---
As long as being an idiot makes you happy and doesn't kill anyone.
---
I love this. I play with some whole families, parents and kids, who play together. It brings a whole new vibe to the game.
---
Basically yea the entire reason we got this game was because of the higher ups seeing how profitable ESOs micro transactions were  and wanted the same with fallout so we got a game no one wanted
---
Fires .223 out of a hand cannon at a possum, watches it explode like a watermelon, sad there is no dinner.
---
Man I hope Bethesda Boi is right!
---
Please tell me there's a way to fix this :(
---
It's the opposite. It's not worth playing since it was nerfed. Now you don't lose much, specially caps. A lot of people play it though.
---
True but hasn't this practice been in just about every MMO? How is this any different? Most MMOs never allow you to gain shop currency unless you subscribe or purchase them directly. 76 didn't invent this business practice. Most people just choose to ignore the past examples for social scores.
---
As for the urgency of cosmetics, if it's THAT important to you to collect them all in order to peacock in the game then that's a personal problem. Have some restraint.
---
my ticket says "4-6" so I assume at least 6.
---
People sell things for more than 300 caps? That's the most I've ever sold anything and only because the person didn't want the things for free
---
Cute skeletons, what are their names?
---
Balance pvp first and maybe i'll play it
---
I only just recently got the longcoat off of an awesome community member, after spending ages hunting for it to no avail. The fact weapons and armour can go is nuts. I'd really like to see some response from Bethesda on this.
---
How they gonna sell more atom shop stuff when everyone outta budget?
---
Me too. I don't even know if I should submit a ticket because any other time I have they just give me a copy and paste "have you checked the forums?"
---
Probably more likely to destroy your eardrums without heavy duty hearing protection.  .223 is pretty mellow, even with a light gun.  Then again, I've never tried to shoot rifle caliber ammo without a stock.  Your wrists and thumb might not feel so great after a few dozen rounds.
---
The anti - micro transaction synth hack programming has begun.  + 1 strength.
---
Do you still have the flowers in the inventory or you have dropped them/they have spoiled?
---
News, documentaries, history, whatever, they're all the same.
---
It seems to trigger every couple of hours. Just watch for the notification that says "Sons of Dane automated alert signal found" to pop up in the upper left corner of the screen.
---
There should be more rewards and benefits to staying clean and sober.
---
Very cool dude. 
---
I feel silly thinking it now but was going to encourage you like sell some work or something.
---
But ofc if you‚Äôre that good you probably already consider that stuff.
---
that is very disappointing. I run a private server in conan exiles. the game has an event log and server logs that show what happens with the items, player etc. it's all logged. so that admins can take care of their players when something bugs out. you read a log amd as admin can spawn in an item as replacement. I'm sure in fallout it's a bit more complex with the affixes etc but I find it very hard to believe they can't replace items. 
---
IMO it should be standard in every game and there should be response from the company so players don't feel like they are wasting their time.
---
(and voicing concerns and wanting bugs fixed isn't me trashing the game. it's literally one of my favorite games of all time, I just want it to work properly.)
---
Same issue, during the riddle my game froze and I reset, and my quest deleted. I decided to keep progressing and got the recipes, onesie I crafted the Nukashine it did nothing. R.I.P my brewing dreams.
---
Say my name......
---
You're goddamn right.
---
I bought some Atoms for the first time a couple days back (PC) and the process was pretty wonky.  The first attempt ended as you say, I got this error after I logged into Paypal.  I tried a bit later on and it managed to go through, and gave me the "Your Atoms have been added" dialog, but it seemed like there was no way out of that confirmation screen.  I had to Tab back, out of the whole process, which threw a bunch of confusing "You're canceling your transaction" warnings.
---
I did double check that, yes, I had my Atoms and my PayPal account was billed accordingly.
---
But yeah, it's not an elegant system at all.
---
All I can say is try again later.
---
Have you played any other Fallout games? They've always been political at their core and are often at their best when they lean into the politics. Heck, even 76 touches on the ethics of automation and workers rights.
---
Exactly.
---
 a fool and his caps are soon parted
---
Oh that's what that is, i tend to ignore the radio üòÅ I'll pay more attention to that now
---
I really want for them to work more on it, I'm tired if losing pets to mobs and players and not being able to bring them back (dogmeat from fallout 4 is a nice example of how it could work). Some people want to have a cat or a dog, but they are usually lvl 1 so they won't survive long. Naming would be also amazing. And some kind of animation like "pet" or "play". Also skins, pet clothing, I would totally buy those from atom store (plus we already have dog helmet in game, just not usable). So yep, would love to see them work on pets more.
---
I got some robot models from Roboco.
---
Dodgy \*3 (Agility) is a good perk if you dont have any other use for AP infight (like VATS or Power Attacks with melee weapons). Consider taking Class Freak \*3 (Luck) if you pick Starched Genes, but thats depending on the mutations you want to take.
---
Adrenaline (Agility) is also a good choice, cuz more damage is more damage :D But you dont need to get it all the way to \*5, even \*1 should be enough in most cases.
---
Since you are picking up Grenadier, consider taking a few levels of Demolition Expert (Intelligence). If you want to drop the grenade based perks all together, Glow Sight is also something you can put into perception, but its highly situational.
---
Endurance is in kind of a bad spot at the moment, the extra HP you get (+5 per point) isnt really worth it and the perks are mediocre or situational at best. 3 points is usually a good base, Fireproof \*3 is good vs scorchbeasts attacks, Ghoulish \*1-\*3 works wonders in nuke zones and Rejuvenated \*2 is also good if you also get Dodgy, anything else is more build specific (like radicool for the so called "bloodied" builds).
---
Maybe if you read the entire description on the card, you‚Äôd know that it does work on Mirelurks. You lazy fuck
---
If they're the kind of folks that people want dead theyre also probably the kinda folks that like to murder and grief, and those are easy to provoke.
---
I play it all the time, unless I'm preparing to play it, my servers are almost always full of people. I just enjoy the pvp only reason I'm still playing fallout 76
---
I bought 5 for 2k caps from someone who discounts @ 5 or more on PC in the "FO76 Grand Emporium" discord. ;o
---
The argument of 'other games do it so its acceptable' is so wank. Its pretty fair for people to expect better from businesses and resent being exploited.
---
I'm ambivalent about that.  On one hand, a Mutation Serum Recipe would be a very cool reward.  On the other hand, because they charge 18,000+ Caps a whack at the Enclave vendor, sucks to be the person who buys them that way when they could have gotten it for free.
---
The same thing is happening with the Jetpacks, of course.
---
I'd be happy if the SBQ, and/or the Scorched Earth event itself, were guaranteed 3\* Legendary drops.
---
You people are so silly, I have am amazing awesome life, filled with joy and family and friends. Even though im handicapt I still have fun on fallout and have many other non video game activities I participate in. I still have 250k on fallout because im good at it. But yet it seems like everyones comments are trashing my life. Grow up people. I usually don't waste my time replying to obvious "hating." But common, you people are telling everyone else to get a life, while you sit here and smack talk all day. Takes one to know one folks. Practice what you preach much? Lol and I won't see any of the hate that this post gets because I don't care enough to come back and read it. Because its obvious so many of you will hate on what I just said. :) Have a nice day
---
Condition is still good and in my inventory. Not sure what happened.
---
How do you tame anyways? Mine only ever says pacify... Do I need 3 points in the perk first?
---
I'd do it, I mean I have pretty low expectations of them now but at least you've done what you can on your end. And who knows, maybe something will happen due to it?
---
Makes me feel happy to see that a huge majority of the people that play this game are pretty supportive of those who enter even months after release. üòÅ
---
I sell all of the 1 and 2 stars that I don't have a use for. If it's ever anything juicy that I don't have a use for (or already have), I beacon someone over and drop it for them. 
---
Even if they offer to pay I decline. Been playing since beta and that kind of goodwill has come my way several times. Just paying it forward and keeping it going.
---
Sorry I meant cranberry glade.
---
I will then. Just really disheartening.
---
Kind of pointless since noone sees it, not even the game itself, other than on character selection, but ok.
---
I think the system has room for improvement, but it isn‚Äôt terrible. I play almost exclusively in Survival. Usually you can expect ~12-15 people in a server. Since they lowered the cap loss, definitely seems to be a lot less people actively seeking PvP. It‚Äôs basically hard mode for FO76. I think the 20% is a good incentive since characters can move between the two modes. I‚Äôd say a lot of players in Survival at this point aren‚Äôt there for the XP. They are there for the challenge.
---
Jeez stalking someone and hoping they might die in order to get their loot seems like a very time consuming for possibly no reward. 
---
What happens if their not picking up much? Or if they just don't die?
---
Maxed animal friend perk card (optional maxed wasteland whisperer card too)
---
No only from event/dailies in that area
---
True, but they also don't look nearly as silly. üòã
---
Hey, sometimes aesthetics win out over practicality!  And for whatever reason, Marine Armor is the only armor from Fallout 4's DLC that doesn't look ridiculous... even if the chest piece makes you look like a giant telephone.
---
you should put an artillery piece on the deck
---
When fighting the Scorchbeast queen, if there are excessive amounts of explosive weapons being used, it leads to severe audio quality degradation.
---
As to the 50, it's not the user, but another player. Sometimes, the sound of it firing will "stick" to a spot, and the only way to clear it is to restart the game.
---
lol thx!
---
Hunter hunted is a dogshit mode no one ever plays, challenges or not.
---
 It is clear they don't want us to **earn** atoms but to **buy** them.
---
You seem like a business expert. Since DLCs are free what plan would you have in place in order to generate funds that would not only keep the servers running but pay a staff to maintain those. Maybe we can work together on this. I create the Power Point slides and you pitch it to all the major gaming studios that haven't seem to come up with a solution.
---
Ohh la la.
---
I wanted to so bad but I don't know where to get the plans!
---
Although paying that type of price for a weapon, I prefer it over the people who only want insane broken items like bloodied,unyielding,sentinel, legacy weapons etc. Yes, you're AAE Pump is amazing, no i dont think its worth an assassins sentinel brother of steel whatever or an AAE/TSE laser rifle..nothing can really be worth those weapons since they cant drop anymore
---
73% upvoted, this sub is fucking pathetic.
---
I didi it. No sure why. On my last sessions game, i was in the blackwater mine, just to see if there was some tag..but no. I left. After some hours i started a new game session and......it's magic...the quest "resetted" by itself, and told me to go to blackwater mine to find the first fragment. Then i finally completed the whole quest.
---
I have no problem with it, i just hate that they force us to do them in specific outfits, fuck that i play PA build.
---
If youre on PS4 i can do it later tonight
---
That's dope, good job üòâ
---
Hey there!
---
Would gladly buy a marsupial and a eagle eyes if you got some (:
---
my IGN is the same as my reddit
---
He spawns around the BBQ place. Also if you wander around the point pleasant forest he might stalk you, seen him twice doing this
---
My vamp is a Gatling Gun with explosive and weightless. It's absolutely fantastic because 5mm is cheap as dirt to make and stimpaks are essentially useless now.
---
It‚Äôs been like that since FO4. Toxic as fuck.
---
where does the mirelurk kings spawn? i havent seen any in there yet and gone through 4 or 5 times
---
:( PC Thx though!
---
I haven‚Äôt found any fallout YouTuber to be good at what they do.
---
Right on. So far I‚Äôve seen one at the pylon near the Ranger District Office and just a few minutes ago at NAR Repair Yard
---
Did you pick flowers outside of the area it highlighted?  I had this problem i think bc it counted flowers outside the area that i picked along the way and she kept doing that to me after a bit the flower count went down to what I'd gotten inside the area only

I agree caps have almost zero value and that's a shame..and your 2k gun was back when thouse dudes where duped like crazy....tse railway wasnt exactly  tier on the dupefest...you cant buy anything special with caps..you can buy "neat" 1 or 2 star legendaries and a few plans from vendors but that's about it...to do serious god tier trading your gonna have to have serious god tier weapons...to me you could show me a furious death claw gauntlet with swing speed and +1 strength I'd say maybe worth 2k-5k...now if it was bloodied swing speed power attack...that's a God roll..your can command other god roll item/items or exorbitant amounts of caps
---
You‚Äôre not the only one. I do it after a farming run. I‚Äôve found several items I‚Äôve wanted at the Whitespring train station when selling my stuff. Nothing absolutely god roll really, but things that definitely synergize with my build.
---
This.  With the suppressor on you‚Äôll chain stealth hits- though I have noticed it may skip a hit. So for example if I have the Fixer- it‚Äôs semi automatic but fast so I can put 6 hits into them fast but every other hit is a stealth one

Level 50 Only Bloodied

A couple of odd knick knacks like that one house shaped teapot and the scorched head in a jar
---
It‚Äôs true. I am one of these people
---
I bought a Weightless TSE double barrel shotgun for like 15k. 
---
Railway Rifles are pretty underrated and cool guns though but I'd probably go for Anti-Armor since you can't mod it in and Exploding, Weightless over Two-Shot. The ammo is super cheap (steel only and recoverable from corpse) but really heavy as well. Two Shot Accuracy will just make hitting stuff with it annoying. Overpriced x2.
---
That doesn't make it ok in a series that hasn't needed it before, live service or not. Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Witcher 2 get content updates without charging anything past initial purchase? And you don't have to collect everything. It is when one thing you want pops up for a 48 hour sale, and you haven't earned enough atoms to buy it. That is when you have to either spend money or not get it.
---
Unsubbed from there what feels like ages ago for that very reason. It‚Äôs okay to have criticisms right, but some take it too far. There is totally $60+ worth of entertainment in this game.
---
I‚Äôll buy it for 8k right now haha
---
Fucking BDO sell outfits for 35euro each. And this is a freaking p2w korean MMO.
---
what about T-pose emote?
---
Funnily enough I would drop what I didn‚Äôt want just to find them for sale at the nearest vendor bot.
---
There are ways to double-side brick walls using door shapes etc, works some of the time. 
---
Personally, I'd just be happy if I could get paintings and posters to hang on walls properly. It's on a wall, what do you mean, it needs support?!?
---
It would be fantastic if they blocked off whitesprings. I am so tired of people‚Äôs turret camps there
---
Sadly, PS4, but thanks, friend.
---
I just look at it as the people that were the angriest about everything that transpired and a lot has happened under the Fallout 76 umbrella. 
---
That and I remember before Fallout 76 was a thing many people hyped it as the next gen Fallout with all of their hopes and such in it, you can see from the crowd at the (E3?) event many people were not expecting a fallout multiplayer game. If the game and everything wasn't rushed the Backlash would have absolutely been lesser and more people could have tolerated the addition of multiplayer.
---
That's what I mean, according to the Bethesda support website we should be able to complete the mission by listening to the tapes in order, but I don't know of anyone that has been able to complete it. There is an optomistic view that it's still there because of future content, but this contradicts Bethesda's own site. So not a bug? Idk. But it does not seem to be not working correctly. 
---
This is minor compared to losing wasted on nukashine, not being able to craft any brewing stations or learn any new alcohol recipes is a bummer.
---
Same. I just have so much stuff ready to sell to vendor that it takes seconds so mine is about weight management lol
---
I play with a girl who collected all the outfits. Can't remember her gamertag right now.... Garbage Can or something like that... but she's constantly smoking meth while we play, then she'll start yelling at her neighbours like really loud even though we are pretty sure she doesn't actually have neighbours, then scream at her grandpa for another beer,  and I'm pretty sure she beats her husband....who we actually haven't heard from in like 2 weeks so ya that's kinda hinky. Anyway congrats.
---
If we had paint for our walls it would be awesome but it will never happen.
---
I already know to not care about the video based on the title - the game is far from dead, and this video is way behind the curve on the FO76 outrage train.
---
Lol I know what you mean! And how can you do that??
---
Yes?
---
Absolutely.  Might as well drop a few caps in your pocket while your at it.
---
I like it. Very nice.
---
My friend tried to sell a asylum forest outfit for 25k (we didn't know about the cap limit then)
---
I'd say stop avoiding the main quest line. You will find food and water along the way and be rewarded with it also for finishing the quests, along with weapons and armor. If you want to farm I'd say hit Morgantown, it's around your level and I'm level 82 and still go back there for easy farming.
---
...but it‚Äôs true man.  Neck beards in moms basement with bowls of Cheetos and mountain dews.
---
Add big Co op events. Like maybe joining one of two factions and every now and then you can load to a new battlefield area that's faction v faction. And it's all players. Maybe NPC botd on each side too, that could cost if you want to spawn them.
---
Hey, thanks for the detailed response.

When I go to do step 6 I can‚Äôt access the tools folder, it doesn‚Äôt show up on my PC

He is Internet HISTORIAN. His other vids cover battle toads, habbo hotel etc. All old news.

There is so much asbestos and no insulation. I should be able to just rub it on the walls. The rads will take me first anyway.

I fuckin hate you lmfao üòÇ

Love to see some more camp builds. 
---
Nice one!
---
I might try their
---
I looked and didn't find it
---
For real.
---
I'm a level 194 it's not bad rng they are patching legendarys without notice. Server hopping is not the same watoga is not even worth the caps anymore unless your going to emergency services or AMS headquarters those haven't been patched. I notice that I get more legendarys when their are other players near by like at white springs, I also noticed that 1times a day you can get legendarys and after which you cant server hop it just doesnt work after that unless other players are near by. But I don't really care I'm excited to see what this legendary vendor is all about and the new scrip for scrap lol. I just want to say the one thing that really made me mad about this game is bethesda getting rid of explosive energy weapons but all in all it's a great game.
---
Witcher is a solo game. Content being regularly free would make sense. 76 is an MMO which requires server maintenance. And let's be honest, those flash sale skins aren't lost in the ether if you don't purchase it. They'll be in circulation and you'll get your opportunity again. Having a little patience helps.
---
I honestly don't remember seeing such a thing in the trailers.  Not saying it wasn't there, but it certainly didn't catch my attention and make me go "OMG Player Vending!"
---
And just downed a fistful of green mentats.
---
My BE laser rifle could easily sell for 150-175K
---
It speaks more about her Caps are worthless than how much these items are worth
---
Well, some of the Sheepsquatch stuff was pretty dark, like the fate of the two girls in Grafton, or Calvin van Lowe himself.
---
It would be nice if they added some support pieces too.  So you can have a second floor balcony that isn‚Äôt just floating.  Some posts or a shelf supports maybe.
---
Oh do one. Just conflate my point with being militantly against anyone making any money, basically I'm the Karl Marx of video games.
---
It not about them making money, it's about the methods they employ. The microtransaction prices are hilariously inflated more than likely due to that crazy statistic that gave birth to the phrase 'whales'. The game industry has done a huge pivot to target these people to the detriment of just about all other players, they could easily lower the prices on the store front or stop doing flash sales or limited time items but they don't. Because they arnt generating content for everyone, they make content for the 10% of pleyers they know will drop more and more money on it.
---
Also given the horrendous launch, anemic updates which have added little past simply making the game playable and all the lies what actually justifys them slinging all this extra shit? I like the game but if consumers don't demand more of corporations then they will push the line out as far as they can. All devs do these days is weather the backlash until people think of the offence as normal then they go right back to some new thing. Development costs are high but when publishers frequently record profits in the 100s of millions they can't also plead poverty.
---
 Rambled but you annoyed me.
---
This would great, cam across this recently and it's annoying. It shouldn't be too hard to do surely? 
---
I am also finding that when I do an interior wall the top glitches on the floor above. So I can always see where the walls are on the floor above. It's annoying as it's ruining my sundeck!
---
What‚Äôs not to love about beer.
---
Another reason the BE Gauss price was inflated is because they no longer drop.
---
That price is still sky high though.
---
I‚Äôd expect to find a be Gauss rather quickly if I were offering 20K
---
I bought my last one a couple weeks ago for 18
---
It‚Äôs easy to get max caps in this game. Just farm weapons and then sell on the reddit market. I do this once every couple of weeks. The key is to know which weapons/armor to sell. There are some 1 star weapons that can sell for 6 to 8k. I farm about a few hours a week and keep my caps replenished to buy other crap I don‚Äôt want to farm for like lead, steel and adhesive.
---
I‚Äôll have to try there.
---
They are not nerfing shotguns. They are correcting a typographical error on the legendary effect 'mod'. These mods are common across all weapons, but has weapon-specific clauses for how much damage to add.
---
The first nerf to explosive legendaries was from (IIRC) 0.5 to 0.2
---
When they got to the part that specified WeaponTypeShotgun, they accidentally wrote down 2.0.
---
It's technically a bug fix, not a nerf.
---
Yeah, I see planters ALL OVER the game on rooftops but I guess we aren't handy enough to make them ourselves?  Oookkk...
---
A lot of people enjoyed Suicide Squad too, its okay to have poor taste and a bad critical thinking skills, you will eventually grow out of it.

Bring the downvotes, friends.

Forgive me if I don‚Äôt answer all of the questions. I just did a quick read and it doesn‚Äôt seem that anyone is eager to help someone out with free info.

Pure flux is the same as stable. You need ten of the same raw flux, hardened mass, glowing mass and high radiation fluids. Your best bet on getting what you want is either buying it from someone or farming it in a nuke zone. 
---
Depending where the nuke is, you get different types of raw flux. You‚Äôll notice that in a nuke zone, the flowers look much different then what was there before. Those are the raw form. Use the perk green thumb. You don‚Äôt have to but I would always suggest it since you would be getting double the amount off of one flower.
---
You can get the hardened mass, high radiation fluids and glowing mass off of any of the creatures, aside from scorch beasts, directly in the nuke zone. I‚Äôve seen people selling those too but I‚Äôm honestly one of those that prefers to be self reliant, so I farm it all. If I‚Äôm lazy, I‚Äôll buy the pure/stable flux off someone. They typically run for 50 caps each for PS4. It‚Äôs a good alternative if you don‚Äôt feel confident on killing in nuke zones. I personally like gathering at the scorch queen. You get a good variety, aside from yellowcake flux.
---
The last part is to head to a chem bench. If you have points in super duper, definitely use that. You gain a decent chance at doubling the stable flux for the cost of one flux.
---
A word of warning, not all colors of plants reflect what you are trying to gather. I‚Äôve seen violet looking plants give crimson and what sometimes looks crimson, gives cobalt.
---
If you need a list of what plants provide what, there are pieces of paper in the enclave bunker. I believe it‚Äôs in the military wing by the crafting benches and downstairs at the mutations vendor.
---
I think people are just getting really good at the missions now, so they aren‚Äôt up very long anymore.   People also know and look for the ones they like, so they get joined pretty quick.
---
A full set of unyielding sentinel would cost around 75-100K at least lol
---
Have you played the past fallout games?. They have super mutants dressed as females I think one identified as a cat as-well.
---
My budget is full thanks mainly to small decoration stuff from events and atom store. My house isn't even that big.
---
I‚Äôve moved on from trying to tame pets.. im all about capturing now. Even if it‚Äôs temporary
---
Long post coming.
---
The Fallout sub harbors resentment for the game, and much of it is earned. The BETA was a joke, launch was abysmal, how Bethesda handled PR and responses to users was flat out terrible early in. It just seemed to get worse every time news came out (Nuka Dark, cheating, exploiting, griefing, etc). It certainly wasn't helped by all the YouTube personalities who latched onto the drama for easy views, "reporting" every rumor and random Reddit post as fact for a while.
---
By and large, the Fallout sub wanted a game that captured the feel of all the other Fallouts that came before. 76 was not that game... at least not on the surface. There's pretty much daily threads there about why New Vegas was the best of the new Fallout games and Obsidian should have had more time, but why Bethesda's handling of Fallout 4 was terrible, constant comments about Emil's writer skills, or that Obsidian should have make Fallout 4, and Obsidian, Obsidian, Obsidian.
---
The sub itself still struggles with reaction to Fallout 4, the game that's fun to play, but overall wasn't a great Fallout title.
---
That's not to say 76 is bad. Truth is, the game was rigged from the start. Launch was terrible, yeah, but the game has also improved quite a bit. Lore hounds have had time to dig deep into the game's story and uncover a lot of great aspects to the writing, the depth of characters found in the game, and subtleties Bethesda put in the story. It's surprisingly dark. 
---
Over time, a large majority of bugs have been fixed. The new content so far has been great, and it seems like it's on a good path forward if the updates continue to maintain their quality.
---
But Todd dropped a lot of promise bombs that ultimately fizzled out. The game they got was not the game they wanted, and there's a good reason that the people who like Fallout 76 gravitated towards their own sub than keep it together.
---
Fallout fans are as varied and diverse as the games themselves.
---
How do you pay 40k caps when the limit is 25k?
---
Not sure how I‚Äôm even going to be able to build my vending machine.
---
Oh well, who needs a water purifier anyway?
---
And exclusive to Epic Store, no thx.
---
Co-op workshops. 
---
If we're supposedly in this together to rebuild Appalachia, why are we fighting over the workshops to begin with?  
---
Someone claims a workshop allowing them to build, fast travel to, and defend it.
---
Another person comes along and... takes a stake in the workshop, allowing them to also build, fast travel to, and defend it.
---
Have the production outputs be player specific (perhaps with reduced output per claimant), so we're not stealing from each other but sharing in the benefit, and also sharing the responsibility of defending it.
---
"Its the apocalypse. Not an amusement park."

Who knows, maybe a yearly thing.  Hasn‚Äôt shown up again yet.

After 50 shots with tank killer rank 3, 18 of the shots staggered my friend.
---
After 50 shots with enforcer rank 3, 0 shots staggered my friend.

I‚Äôm pretty positive only tank killer lets a laser rifle with a splitter mod stagger, because with the enforcer perk, my friend was not staggered even one time.

When I was searching for the camera, I bumped into someone doing the same. Wasn't any communication necessary at that point, no Tourist so we waved and parted. Next location I find the Tourist! Of course, he was in a group so I looked him up on PSN in my own time (my recent players list hasn't updated in... Years) to find out he has messages disabled. I hope he never found the damned camera!
---
My generator also kept getting broken.  A higher level suggested putting it behind walls in the house so no one could mess with it (easily).    The supermutants keep walking up my stairs and breaking my stuff.  Who keeps leaving the damn door open?!?  Oh right..probably me....
---
I price my stuff high for the guns I actually wanna keep but I‚Äôll price stuff for legendary depending on the stars
---
Even aiming, the spread is horrible (admittedly from my point of view, a traditionally rifle/sniper player, so maybe I'm just less willing to deal with it :) )
---
Bloodied something is by far the best, these lowlife builds not only have the most extra damage perks/mutations/effects but also the strongest. At 20% Life you get \~80% damage from bloodied legendary effect, 20% from nerd rage perk and another 50% from adrenal reaction mutation (thats all multiplicativ (ex 100\*1,8\*1,2\*1,5)). But not only that, you also get a lot of defense with permanent serendipity perk and unyielding/bolstering legendary effects or emergency protocol Mod if you play in PA.
---
Other weapon effects, like zealots, ghoul slayer etc. are only effective against a special kind of enemy and give only 30% damage (vs 80% from bloodied). Berserker nets you a bit more, with 50% damage at 0 DR/ER, but are really bad defensive and gear wise (you cant have ANY armor piece equipped, loosing all the legendary effects in the process and you get one shotted by most enemies if they hit you).

Generally that's not how prices work in the real world, nor do I think that's how it will work in the game. Other than income dependent student loans I can't think of many things that cost a flat percent of the salary of a large group of people (other than income taxes and such, which are built into your take home pay, are essentially mandatory and relatively stable over time and therefore essentially invisible) and very few mass made consumer products in the RL market  exist with only one price and no reasonable alternatives.  Therefore prices can be set at what a reasonable number of people are willing to afford, unless that makes the item too cheap to manufacture at a price that can be profitable. Government subsidies to farmers are an example of a way to 
---
In the game, almost nothing for sale is unavailable to you in the wild (especially true if scrip can be traded for specific items) given sufficient time to farm. You're paying in the case of vending for convenience, but it will for the most part be  for common interchangeable items. Vendors won't generally want to sell items to players for less than they could get at an NPC, and players won't want to buy from player venders at a higher price than would be paid at an npc. This sets a natural range for interchangeable items, which are pretty much any consumable other than hard to find recipes or serums. 
---
Specific items (TSE, serum etc) are going to need to be sourced online for any reasonable chances of finding one from a vendor, and if you need to friend the vendor to join their server the exchange might as well be in person to save money.
---
Even if they aren't willing to do the trade in person the 10% is generally not a sufficient change in price to make you unable or unwilling to make the purchase. It's very possible to farm enough to make a few hundred caps in a few minutes time, either a quick run through Harper's Ferry to acquire weapons to sell to the HF vendor, or server hopping for Grafton monster, pond behemoth, etc.
---
well in defense of the people having incomming messages blocked, had a friend, female, went in to survival.. came back an hour later and spent the next three hours (she read em to me as they came in) getting harassed by crybabies that she killed repeatedly calling her every derogatory name you could think of as well as her parental lineage, and sexual preferences.. some she reported others she just ignored.. some dont take loss well.. and some really really dont like losing to a girl then getting laughed at for it.   
---
had a few other friends get messages like "screw you" "f you" "f off" and so on but hers as about the worst i had heard. some evidently feel you have insulted them personally when you have killed em and take it to ps messages.   
---
also had a friend that went in to a trade to buy some aluminum or steel or whatever then guy kept sending him messages wanting to buy his weapons even after being repeatedly told not for sale.. please?.. cmon bro.. i neeeeeeed that for my build.. you dont need it you got others..
---
these posts NEVER get enough traction. and it's, in my opinion, the #1 issue right now. this is a looter-shooter for god's sake, how can our *loot* be prone to disappearing at random? it's absurd.
---
I'd like them to look at server sync and try to recreate the issue. the way I see it, they can't find anything wrong in the logs because, at least on the server side, people are willingly dropping, scrapping and selling these "disappearing" items. I think that, because of server de-sync, the game thinks you have your pipboy open when you actually don't, and when you press the drop key for example, the same one used to reload on PC, the server will drop whatever is highlighted on your pipboy at that moment.
---
this is just an example. there are "variations" of this of course.
---
When is the next patch planning on being released?
---
Give it a few more months, if Bethesda doesn't abandon development it will be fine.
---
What bullshit is in the video? I legit don't know since I haven't played fo76 to know one way or another.
---
Your sarcasm is SOO helpful!! :D. Thanks for contributing.
---
Omw
---
I play pretty much only survival, and I like it.  I think the rewards should be higher to encourage a bit more player hunting, but overall its not bad.  You get a good mix of hunters and folks just playing the game.
---
What I hate about it is how on events someone can come in, back out of the event, and kill you in the event area.  They need to fix that protection, or events are pointless.  I don't care if they kill me right when it finishes, just let me finish the event.  
---
Had some a-hole do this to me at the lighthouse with one biolum to go.  It's so ridiculously lame.
---
Personally, I'd say so.  With player vending coming along, being able to provide a steady stream of serums to customers for a fraction of the Enclave price seems like a good, solid revenue stream.
---
I personally have two mutations that I want to get rid of, but haven't bought all the plans for the mutations I do want.  I'm expecting many players to have the same idea as myself and make serums to vend for a steady income stream.  Why pay 3000-something caps for something I can likely get for less than 1000 in a couple days, and feed the in-game economy in the process?
---
There's always new players and new alts that will want/need mutations, so I don't see the demand falling off ever.
---
id be okay with turret camps..but it would be funny if every robot in the white springs continues to attack your camp relentlessly due to the weapons attacking "important guests". since there are already protective robots guarding the grounds there is little point in having turrets for PVE Defense.

this has been happening to me when i Emote is started after the SheepSquach update

They just have to block a bit more space behind the Clubhouse, thats all.

Afraid not bud :(

I have a cultists robe/rap/whatever they call it and the mask/helmet too. PSN is bgc33. I‚Äôll take pics with whomever when I get back on tonight.
---
The annoying thing is that every single video just shows the same footage of bugs that were there on release and fixed a week or two later, but most people believe that this is still the case with Fo76, a buggy mess.
---
I‚Äôd agree with that. As it stands now, the game is in a pretty good shape with a few details that need riddling up. The game should have been released in the state it‚Äôs currently in instead of the dumpster fire that it was for the first four months.
---
Bethesda: We increased budget so you can buy more stuff!
---
Players: 12 more rocket turrets
---
I bought the game twice for that too, but the second copy I gave to a friend who doesn't at all share my passion for the challenges... or even the game. Surely I'm the idiot for considering buying a third copy?
---
Quad on harpoon gun or broad sider yes..quad on a pistol...waste of time
---
I had no idea about that reference to Vault 76.
---
According to the wiki, they've actually been name dropping Vault 76 since Fallout 3.  Not that they planned it this way, but in Fallout 3, it was called out as being one of the seventeen Control Vaults scheduled to open in 20 years time.
---
Generally that's not how prices work in the real world, nor do I think that's how it will work in the game. Other than income dependent student loans I can't think of many things that cost a flat percent of the salary of a large group of people (other than income taxes and such, which are built into your take home pay, are essentially mandatory and relatively stable over time and therefore essentially invisible) and very few mass made consumer products in the RL market  exist with only one price and no reasonable alternatives.  Therefore prices can be set at what a reasonable number of people are willing to afford, unless that makes the item too cheap to manufacture at a price that can be profitable. Government subsidies to farmers or investment in public infrastructure, both paid for by taxes are an example of a way we pay for necessary items that we couldn't otherwise produce at profit.

I found a level 20 explosive quad combat shotgun. Made some combat armor, pumped the armor and the shotgun out, and dropped it all plus 1300 shotgun shells for the closest level 20 I could find.

Wouldn't object to this at all.  It has always seemed like a bug more than a deliberate choice, especially since crouching does *not* count as standing still.

You can‚Äôt get any energy weapon with explosive for less than Max Caps.

That includes flamers, Cryolators, and Tesla‚Äôs

Lasers are the most expensive and even the worst laser like a ghoul slayers explosive will run you more than Max Caps if you can find someone willing to sell for caps

I have a few... 1. Old man: in bathrobe w/ cane, attack at random, lost and confused emotes. 
---
2. Mounty: ranger hat and red scribe outfit. Make hundreds of soups/ health chems travel to workshops and gift people what they're farming for.. bullets, meds, food.
---
3. Stalker: Civil War suit and sack hood, flaming or "creepy" weapons. Follow people around FOREVER, say and do wierd/creepy thing. Might leave for an hour then show back up at your house while your sleeping just to watch you sleep. 
---
4. Jock: jersey and old man mask, powerfist. Fucking about your camp trying to break in. Shit on beds, attack people holding down workshops just because not even bothering to keep it. Thus guys just a dick.

I kinda have this fisherman guy too but he's just a mix of them all, mostly nice. Showing my camp off and kicking down meds.

Explosive Gatlings have played second fiddle to the shotties as far as I've seen. Got wrecked a few times by an Ass. Sent. guy with a Gatling plasma last week. No idea if it was legacy.

Yeah, the power attacks are what I keep forgetting to do. In the heat of the moment, I forget to stagger.

Still doing this??

Not 100% sure but I think they only drop as quest rewards in the toxic valley

I've used treasure maps...and supply requeistions and Bobby pins...

To be fair each subreddit is flawed. This one could be said to be a circlejerk for blindly liking the game.
---
Although blind positivity is better than blind negativity imo
---
I said 10k+ (haven‚Äôt played in a while)
---
Completely agree with this and hats off to Bethesda, they‚Äôve made massive improvements.
---
Honestly prices are so high for a lot of items because it‚Äôs so rare for a god roll weapon to drop. I would easily pay 25k for a god roll simply because it‚Äôs easier to get 25k in game then it is to get this gun to drop.

I‚Äôve farmed legendaries since beta and the only good thing I‚Äôve ever had drop for me is a marine lifesaving powered cavalier arm. Shitty weapons and armor drop 99% of the time for everyone. I saw someone actually built a drop simulator and it estimated that a bloody explosive vats handmade is around a 1:2,000,000 chance. 
---
Now some insanely high priced items like legacy guns go for that much because there‚Äôs only a limited amount in game right now and they‚Äôre actually insanely good. I have a bloody explosive laser rifle that kills anybody using no crits no matter what assassins sentinel gear they have on. This gun I‚Äôve seen being sold for 300k
---
On a more real note, the people complaining about high prices are the same people that complained about duping. Now that duping is gone for the most part there‚Äôs limited amount of these god roll guns going around. What did you guys think would happen?
---
Nah, I do it too.  Every now and then I find something that seems like it would be extraordinary for the right buyer, but laziness takes over and I'm like "I don't have the Stash space to hold onto this."
---
Caps are not worth enough. Add some serious camp sinke. GUILDS AND GUILD CAMPS!
---
bought the game for me and my stepson, he moved out, left the game, had a friend that owned a ps4 and never played it.. went to his house "your not using your ps4 lemme have it" so he let me borrow it indefinately.  
---
added a secondary acct to his ps4 put game on there and run an extra set of pack mules on it for more storage space.. course with legendary scrip coming i can prolly now get rid of 6-7 mules and the need for 2nd account and his ps4.
---
I've sold loads of crap.to vendors. Or give it away to low level players.
---
Hotdogs, Hamburgers, tacos, whatever they're all the same.
---
World full... wont let me join
---
Yeah man I myself think this is a VERY big issue. I have top level gear on my character that has taken me since launch to grind out. In all honesty I haven‚Äôt logged on for 2 days cause I‚Äôm too scared about losing that stuff üòÇ to stupid server issues or whatever the case may be

---
Ok, ty
---
Level really has nothing to do with it
---
Understood you're annoyed but you're also not being realistic. Let's start with the developers for example. Most are contractual position that not only do not come with benefits but the company is no obligated to keep them around. They can easily be rotated. Not to mention nowadays they get paid shit for the amount of work they put in while higher ups get all the glory. You're simply assuming or spouting nonsense most self entitled gamers repeat at nauseum. As for the items they're cosmetics. You do not benefit what so ever in game play except for your own vanity. There's absolutely no reason to purchase everything in the Atom shop. If you're concerned about a flash sale then either be patient and wait for that item to come back around or when you're Atoms are low play some events and horde them for a rainy day. It's not Bethesda's fault someone is that impulsive. Where's the pitchforks for games like DCUO where you have to PAY for tokens in order to run dungeons more than once for loot?
---
Totally agree it's quite absurd. The market won't change until people stop paying it. Hopefully the legendary vendor and vending machines will help mitigate things. Worst case, Bethesda ups cap limits.
---
I agree with you saying it's not a priority. Yesterday I read something from bethesda about the new vendors coming out in Patch 9 and when they mentioned the 10% tax the we're saying it to help balance the in game economy. So they act like they are aware of a potential issue. I don't think they have the right answers until we as the community post and discuss amongst our selves then they will come up with a good solution.  Or what they think is a good solution.
---
All that does is reinforce the stigma around the game. I still don't agree with the video, and how most of the gaming community seems to *enjoy* shitty launches so they have something to gawk at and complain about.
---
It‚Äôs around a 1:2,000,000 chance for a god roll weapon to drop. Much easier to collect caps than it is to farm for these guns or armor
---
Figures, thanks üòâ
---
The noises it makes are annoying though.
---
I'm not talking about Watoga streets, those have indeed been nerfed, but about the EMS building. I still encounter legendary SMs, Wendigos and ghouls in there.
---
"May 7"
---
I pick them all up and lately have been dumping everything I don't need/want (99.9999%) in either the cash register at the Hotel crafting area or in the blue suitcase at the Whitespring Station.  If I haven't hit my daily cap limit, I sell them at the same places for others to look over and buy if they like what they see.  One man's junk is another man's treasure.  I got a 1\* quad tesla rifle the other day from the Bot at the hotel crafting station, and promptly sold it for like 3k caps on the trading forums.  I also got a lvl 35 TS/E/weightless lever gun at the Charleston vendor the day after the TSE nerf.  I did a nice trade for that piece, as well.
---
Bud you need to calm down you killed someone in a video game and your acting like you burned down an orphanage no matter why People think the 76 community is to sensitive
---
Not trying to sound rude what what's the point now? Didn't the mutation recipes get removed from her loot table?
---
AS to the silos, they can be a little confusing. There's a lot of robot defenders going after you so between killing those and doing the objectives in a silo, it can be a little hectic. I went in not very well prepared and my bro and I died a lot.  You're gonna need lots of ammo, and health. Helps to be a higher level.
---
I didnt play this week , so i cant see the item on the atom shop ;( thats why i made this week
---
Just saw the skins on the internet
---
Ok and just leave the server problem solved no need to cry on reddit
---
Haha love it.
---
I didnt play this week , so i cant see the item on the atom shop ;( thats why i made this question
---
The guns you use are fine for PVE. The hardcore pvp players usually gain caps a ton faster than other and can easily make 25k in a few days or less of pvping. 
---
To make caps faster you buy better gear. A bloody explosive handmade sells easily for 25k because we have the caps and aren‚Äôt willing to spend so much time trying to get that 1:2,000,000 drop chance for a god roll.
---
The devil is in the details. As a different user in a similar post elaborated. It's not that fans are loyal, it's just that people aren't getting the full story.  
---
To quote said user:  
---
&gt;Didn't even mention half the positive things about the game.  
---
&gt;Took context out of a lot of stories. (cheater ones for example)  
---
&gt;Undervalued the enormous bug fixes and stabilty improvements to the game.  
---
&gt;Takes the zero score metacritic reviews seriously.  
---
&gt;Features boogie and quartering who are just massive piles of shits. Yongyea too but Idk if he is a bad person or just a bad content maker.  
---
&gt;There's no source on sales numbers, just shows misleading stuff.  
---
&gt;Player numbers arent dwindling.  
---
&gt;Not once does he mention atoms can easily be aquired by playing the game.  
---
&gt;Shows a guy with a lgbt, metoo fedora while talking about mods of forums and reddit. O K  
---
&gt;I dont mean to disrespect his content making, he seems talented. But there is a lot of bogus in this video.  
---
&gt;I also think fallout 76 launch was pretty shitty. But this doesnt excuse any of the above.  
---
&gt;Internet Historian seems to be browsing this sub. So, he hopefully sees this.
---
Think of watching his video like watching a Fox News view on a nuanced humanitarian issue. Much of the information might be true, but without correct context, or if the context is purposefully off or left out, you might just come out of watching it LESS informed about what happened than you would be if you hadn't watched it at all.
---
That's the internet as a whole. Hating on certain things ends up gaining an almost meme status. Unfortunately, hating on Fallout 76 has become an in-thing in the gaming community. It's easy to take pot shots at, like posting about pineapple on a pizza to stir up easy arguments. People just recycle things to hate and make it a competition to try to out-hate certain things.
---
It's an amazing concept that nobody plays sadly
---
Damn that‚Äôs the life though is it not?
---
It's the cost in caps to start the event
---
Thanks for your help, got pretty frustrated.
---
Now to take out my frustrations...
---
I found the flame mod at Harper's ferry and watoga recently.
---
Play like you're playing now but pick up EVERYTHING. When you fill up, head to your camp: break everything down- put all junk in stash box- go to tinker bench and bulk everything you can- put bulked items in stash box and head back out to play. At the end of the day (if you're trying for the full 1400 a day) or once every few days when stash is getting full head to WhiteSprings, dont carry junk on you because there may be enemies... there's a shop in WhiteSprings that has workbenches and a stash box, go there to pull out junk and sell. Don't sell things like gears, lead, screws (you'll get an idea as you play). But things like, say, rubber.. I ended up with 800 so I sold 600. Things like that I keep around 200 on hand and sell the rest. Also check that stash box junk tab every now and then in case you dumped anything not broken down, you want almost everything there to say "bulk", with leftover 'loose' screws and whatnot. Good luck :)
---
Human heads
---
No kidding? I'll have to hop over there and spam the vendor!
---
I already dropped my shotgun for a handmade.  So if it's just that, cool.  Either way, I'm having more fun with my new gun.
---
I have a TSE Gatling Laser any idea what it's worth?
---
Fyi being part of the SBQ event and defeating her typically rewards you stable flux as well.
---
This happened to me once a week or two ago while trying to interact with a work bench in my CAMP. I instantly teleported a good 10 minute walk away to a random place southeast.
---
You seem like the one that's overreacting
---
I don't like it because it's practically floating and lacks design, but that's just my critique.
---
There is Lilly in New Vegas
---
Additionally I need to get some black titanium...  Maybe we can work out an exchange?
---
One thing I've tried with my group is to, prior to starting the event,  scan the map and message as many as we can that it is about to start.  That way they have some time to prep and get down there.  Usually I don't start it until we have at least a person per pylon.  We have done it a bunch this way and get it every time.   It helps to have one or two heavy hitters with a bloodied build and Serendipity shared as well to just focus on the Imposter while everyone else works on the pylons and bots after getting in at least a shot at the assaultron.  That one shot gets a legendary same as the few doing chunks of damage so it has been a pretty good system for everyone.
---
And a camp budget increase of just enough to cover the extra items I‚Äôm going to need but don‚Äôt have budget left for lol.
---
I used to but since the legendary vendor got announced I hoard that shit
---
How am I overreacting I‚Äôm just pointing out how overdramatized This is
---
Yea but I‚Äôd probably switch out the mountain dews with some cherry Pepsi.
---
Ah, when I saw "how to" was wondering if there was something that made it a tricky fight.
---
There are two other mixed drinks that require tick blood tequila, so they require the flux - - tick blood tequila margarita and tick blood tequila sunrise.
---
Actual nuke keycards that you get from cargobots don't expire.
---
If the flowers are the red ones and not asters at Whitesprings (they can be either depending on server) they make red hot blooms. Between then and the brain fungus oner by the enclave service entrance, there's a fair amount of crimson flux. Get the power substation, too, and pick up four cobalt to upgrade your vault suit to shielded Whitesprings also has enough glowing ones to get the glowing mass, high radiation fluids, and hardened mass you need.
---
The most confusing thing about launching a nuke is finding your way through the silo the first time. Also, it's a good idea to have a backup key card in case you mistype the code.
---
Uhhhhhh considering it was made to play with other people should go more mmo.
---
I participated a few in the past couple of days, beat the sheep every time, but finding the invisible body is a little bit challenging. The location is instanced so each player will find it in a different location. What really needs work is the poor loot of course. Everyone i heard on open mic said they got a wood piece or one star lead pipe.
---
He wanted to apologize to someone you compared us to bring an orphanage down
---
I can't understand that either. Unless your a trader the average player does not have that kind of caps. The the only way they will have them highly sought after weapons are with a "random" drop. So it will cause some issues in the long run for the in game economy. It's still early in the game yet. We will see what happens in the following months with the legendary vendors.
---
Might build some lowbie weapons for display. Other than that, idk, woukd be nice to have some crafting related things near my craft benches.
---
Oh and booze near my still.
---
There are too many restrictions on running the event.  There's a 3 hour cooldown.  And whoever starts it has to pay 1,800+ Caps for the required part, whereas everyone else simply joins.  It's not a guaranteed 3\* drop either, so you're paying 1,800+ Caps to accomplish... what, exactly?  The chance of a drop you could randomly find just roaming the world for a half-hour?  And that's only if you complete it?  Yeah, not worth it.
---
Admittedly, a couple days back, I was playing on The Server Where No One Helps.  It was so unusual.  This one Level 48 spent an hour running a silo and launched a nuke at Fissure Site Prime.  And how many players showed up besides him?  Just one.  Me.  And it's not like the server was empty.  Later, some friends joined into the server and ran Encryptid, and it was basically just us.
---
NO
---
&gt; dumpster fire
---
Is accurate to the early days.
---
I tried to play 4 after 76, but it actually came off as hard to do, because it just felt... Less. Like a step backwards.
---
Its okay to have but it is rare.

The perfect camp is always just out of reach ain‚Äôt it

Bethesda bad, obsidian good.

None. /r/fo76 is triggered because they like the thing this video shits on.

If your on PC get the chat mod and people will help you out. Makes the game 100x more enjoyable.

---
Last gameplay of Outer Worlds looked like a mess.
---
NPCs just crouching and sitting while you whack them to death, streets of the city being almost completely empty, etc.
---
I have no confidence in the product Obsidian is making after the latest things they showed us on their own.
---
LOL, I'm completely the opposite.  My very first "great gun" was a mutant slayer's explosive combat rifle I bought for a couple hundred caps at the Whitespring Station, probably in mid-November.  It enabled me to get my foot in the door and start farming legendary gear on my own, and I'm trying my best to pass that lucky find along to others that I will likely never meet.  I sell anything that's too heavy to stash, but a very good piece, or drop it into an easy to find container for others to look through, or just hold it until I find a lvl 60-ish guy using a heavy gun and drop a furious/ffr/reload .50cal at my feet with a gift emote.  I've made a couple good in-game friends that way, and we now have a great discord group where we share our little 3 star treasures to gift each other before going on the trading forums.  I got [this fine piece](https://imgur.com/o9NTGe8) from a friend that I made by gifting him his first two-shot combat shotgun a few months back.  We team up often, he's become a rad player, occasional comedic genius and trusted traveling companion, and it's great to share legendaries for double the chance of something great.
---
Well said
---
After the plan patch/change I found BoS in the streamer trunks a few times. If you unlock them and take NOTHING out it would reset after a while. Doing this could also help. If you take even anything out of the location crate it will take about 1 irl day to respawn. I haven't played in a month so not sure if it's still like this.
---
TSE was nerfed months ago.
---
That‚Äôs how I interpreted it, it‚Äôs called satire genius or maybe one could say sarcasm the point is that why does it matter if he killed someone in a game ITS A GAME I was just killing some players earlier and you don‚Äôt see me writing a sob story pvp is a part of the game
---
Are you still there?
---
Pan; blckyeti
---
Agree with most of your post.
---
All that "wearing a beerhat and make a photo of a Rad-Toad licking a gulper and another player with cannibal perk, while intoxicated with deathclaw ale and have whoopsis" is straight rubbish.
---
I mean not that most people have the whole day playing a game in the end to wait for THAT event/random encounter happen.
---
It just should be a goody for joining in every day and keep playing.
---
And foremost - no endless server hopping needed to get 10(cts) atoms because you have to find a glowing son of a sloth which has no static spawn like Grafton Monster or a Snally...
---
Yeah maybe we slowly be forced to paying Atoms to keep the system going. And honestly - i would but if i look in the Atomic Shop of all things i'm interested in max 2-3 things and the Rest is not worth the atoms. Not even earned ones sadly.
---
I'm in that boat except I constantly have &gt; 200
---
Lots of crying in this thread.
---
Yeah, especially when they said it wasn't going to be open world, but the mindless Bethesda haters will praise it, and will probably praise it for the same features they hated fallout 76 for...
---
And 30 minutes of load screens just to make a transaction!
---
The only thing Beth can do is raise the max cap limit. 
---
But how do people even determine the cap value of legendaries?
---
Yeah I definitely disregard physics and aesthetics for the most part. Just try to make sure I have the basics around me. I‚Äôve seen some really beautifully built camps and they always impress me. üòä
---
No need to go into SBQ fight, when you see that area was nuked on a server, stay on it for a while until the nuke dissipates, then go in and collect your Blast Berries. You need to get the other ingredients (glowing mass, hardened mass and high rad fluid) ready before doing that because the raw fluxes will degrade over time even when you have Good With Salt equipped.
---
I have a chest full of them, like a 3 star medics gauss rifle... 50%limb damage and reduced weight. What a treasure... but then there‚Äôs decent ones like faster death tambo with and it‚Äôs got another decent perk too... but I have waaaay too many. Can‚Äôt even farm legendaries anymore. Too much, can‚Äôt wait for the patch thankfully they‚Äôre bring the legendary trash can out early
---
Thank you! üòÑ
---
Sometimes if u look at too many other enemies loot before the SBQ, it won't give u anything
---
About 1k, I have one if u want it
---
Lets call it passionate for now lol
---
You added a point to intelligence but picked a perk in something else, it‚Äôs easy enough to accidentally do, not an error or bug.
---
yes
---
I always love seeing them too. Thank you! üòä
---
&gt; Honestly, nobody wants to hear people piss all over a game that they decidedly enjoy and play. 
---
Clearly, you're not the target audience.
---
Modern society has an intense fascination with slow moving train wrecks, even when the train hasn't actually jumped the track.
---
Remember they always keep some stuff in the patch to not all release at once (for example, encryptid and free range). My bet is pioneer scout/vending stuff this coming week and then surprose arktos a week or two later.
---
Someone randomly GAVE me a lvl 50 AA combat shotgun back in Survival mode when I was less than lvl 20.  Happened outside of Whitesprings, they were in x01 taking out spawn campers. Went to the Stash and gave me what would become my primary weapon. 
---
Anti armor tears up players.  If I don't get surprise crackle crackle respawned, I do pretty well.  Even if they get me they are usually left hurting.
---
I really hope they fix this, all I use is my gatling gun and aiming at fast moving enemies is difficult.
---
3 serum equal that.
---
Psn?
---
workshop is a pvp magnet..
---
It does
---
But it‚Äôs so hilarious, I only do it to people who afk at the fusion farms just find a nice spot take it over every now and then the contested part goes away and I just get it making the turrets turn on the person who built them.
---
Nobody wearing those duped armors and blasting others with explosive weapons earned/farmed anything. Hard work is not their thing.
---
Is he hard to kill like a deathclaw? Does he have good loot or is it best to just leave him be and do his thing?
---
I must have been just outside of the blast radius, in that case.
---
It does not make sense in Witcher. You pay at initial purchase, and that is it. If anything, they want to continue selling you stuff to make more money. Yet, they found a way to take what they did make from 2 to make an even better game in 3. Which I believe also receieved some free updates, and then a paid expansion in what was hailed as an amazing bit of content. I get server costs. I get microtransactions. I get it. But preaching patience etc is not even truly relevant in this day and age with the nature of in game cash shops. Yes, the cosmetic skin may be back, but you know what will show up before then? 40 more skins, all of relative quality. It is a never-ending treadmill. If you wanted say 3 of those 40 skins, and they show up at 1800 points each, how long do you have to play to get enough points without paying? They have slowly made daily challenges harder. Some are impossible without having the right setup in advance. Some take a lot of time and coordination to do. How much time do you have to dedicate? Will you have enough to get those three skins and bank enough for when the original skin you wanted comes back around unannounced? Look, my point is, yes you should exercise restraint. But thinking that the system is not designed to make you want to pay is just plain denial.
---
It looks like medical scrubs... which is a cool touch
---
Same, I just have no decent addons for it except the stupid sight...
---
We definitely need "sorry", not just positive and negative emotions!
---
TBH does anyone really need god tier stuff?  It's only useful on a couple big critters if your trying to do them with a minimum number of people.
---
We had a similar experience early on.  It only took a few times doing that before we figured it out.  The point always goes to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L that you entered thru, not the perk card you eventually pick. 
---
It is annoying at first but after we understood the method, it became a non-issue. Just another part of the game to play.
---
PC? On xb1 there is a recent players tab.
---
Sweet!
---
IDK what liking a poorly made product has do to do with a person's critical thinking skills. Seems like you are trying to personally attack fans of the game for no reason.
---
You could always add some posts to connect it to the ground if you still have some camp budget
---
Exactly, and that's why it needs some balance changes
---
Poor rewards killed the beasts and the events.
---
This the type of dude who was sitting in this subreddit saying shit like "The bugs are overblown!"
---
Not sure if Bethesda shill, blind dickrider, or delusional.
---
Checked out the post where you showed the artwork - loved your journal!  Nice work and a fun idea!
---
They should also add a speedy prime receiver and more barrel attachments
---
Aww it's cute!
---
What platform do you play on?
---
workshops are PVP areas. workshops do not really produce enough to make them worth the PVP risk IMO unless your looking to battle
---
It's a joke/satirical channel... So no.
---
The morons on this sub LOL
---
Maybe block off camps located near ghoul spawns, mines at whitesprings in a place that‚Äôs unused on PC.
---
This is a simple solution to the farming problem. Bravo. It'll probably never happen, but it's a great idea.
---
0/10 troll
---
I do have budget left, where do I find these posts? Do I need plans for them? Thanks for the tip! üòä
---
Thanks! I didn't think of it myself, though. Saw someone else with some letters over theirs and was like, yes! Perfect for the bar, especially with the punch bowl. ;)
---
You lose pretty much nothing. It has no direction or incentive to play honestly, that's the real issue.
---
This post is fucking stupid
---
No he's pretty easy to kill, the main thing about fighting him is that he will disappear for a second or two and reappear behind you somewhere to disorient you (essentially teleporting around) but he doesn't deal much damage either. The loot isn't good either, all he drops is some ballistic fibre and sometimes he'll drop a wing which can be scrapped for two acid and one ballistic fibre so he's not really worth fighting if you're in it for the loot.
---
Ah, ok.
---
Thank you!! üòÑ I‚Äôm on PS4, what about you?
---
I‚Äôd love a speedy receiver maybe just a decent damage increase receiver, I‚Äôm at 200+ but 250is would be awesome, and hopefully keep the god awfully slow fire rate or increase it.
---
It‚Äôs a statement of fact my guy
---
On a 10mm with extended mag, it's 51 bullets. Add an auto receiver and you have a bullet hose.
---
it is supposed to be a pvp magnet...
---
He's just softie for hugs
---
Do you have red hair?
---
Saw an Ron with some other guy wearing glasses poking each other with sticks?
---
That's the problem
---
Not exactly. Someone in the same household can play on the live account's home xbox while the live account plays on a different xbox. That's how my son and I play using a single live account.
---
Haven't tried from different modems.
---
Yeah about that. You just gotta pray for Todlet Howard to use Bethesda magic on your enemies so you can beat them. Here we saw the famous invisible ruble that traps your enemies and makes the unable to move till they are killed to death.
---
I'm on PS4.
---
I found one the other day. It‚Äôs currently in my stash.
---
The games not short of bullet hoses with far large r ammo capacity and more damage
---
And that's fine, but fight over the resource
---
attack the argument not the people 
---
taste is objectively subjective and critical thinking isn't even related to any of this
---
See though, it's still a fun gun. Not everything has to be OP- that was the main point of my comment, which you seem to have missed.
---
Seen it once, SBQ bugged so much we couldn't make a dent on her health until some time after the base was removed, and then she went like butter on fire, and then her body disappeared =)
---
Dang it
---
Don't be bummed, most of us have done this. The point goes into whatever one you picked first. The method makes some sense once you're past lvl 50. And you'll be able to move the points around then too, one per lvl up.
---
I really like the no caps for workshop contest. I think it strikes a great balance in the different sides of the argument. And also minimizes potential exploits.
---
Yup, don't think that anything could really bring it close to an interesting experience in the long run. Simply because it would require so much changed or/and a ton of work. Even then a lot will not be satisfied. Sad to see the potential and what it is in actuality.
---
Sometimes the reddit gods smile upon me...today was that day! See you in game :)
---
i remember when hearthstone devs removed sorry emote because it was super toxic
---
What kind of gatling gun do you use?
---
Legendary scrip vending machine plus player vending is going to translate into probably a 400lb stash increase for myself. So for me its probably not needed.
---
See you in game bud!

Well beside the nightvision lense needed or some others like the missing alien...

There were a view undoable lately

Not sure if youre not aware that you can create more than 1 character on one account, or maybe i missed something

Just bought a new xbox one x at gamestop. Fallout 76 edition. It was only $399 compared to ALL the other edtions being $500. Blew my mind a little bit. Lol. So im sure you could find some cheap at gamestop, theyre practically throwing them at you.
---
Ah no problem, yea its one of the limited time ones for now. Should come back later hopefully.
---
This is so cool!
---
I‚Äôm kinda sick of he lOl FuNy People who offer 10 caps when I try to sell my stuff in the Xbox groups

they should have built some extractors then to farm it

The only way for Hunter/Hunted  to take off is if the match making was inter-server and as you walked around you'd be seamlessly migrated to a server with a bunch of other Hunter/Hunted players

I've played over 1400 hours of this game. Im also very active on Reddit. It seems like it's mostly power armor parts that disappear. I've lost nothing from my inventory or mules. I don't touch power armor. 
---
I don't want to say player error, but I feel like player error is a big factor in losing non power armor gear. I keep seeing people say they lost PA parts.
---
Is it weird I thought of naughty things for the female version?
---
Have you done the enclave quests?
---
It took eso a good year to really get a movement going for it and then one tam came and it became the norm to like it. Its gonna be a bit before the community as a whole accepts it.
---
Nice, I‚Äôll see if I can integrate that!
---
lol I just mean I'm getting tired of having to drink beer in the game and all the beer related dlc
---
Im curious how much vending gonna tax my budget. Ive been removing little things from my camp to get ready.
---
&gt; Player numbers arent dwindling.
---
they are and seeing how they keep ruining more and more by disappointing people and breaking with what they announced (only cosmetic atomic shop starts selling repair kits, legendary vendor does not allow modification of legendary mods despite Todd Howard publicly saying so and so on) this will only get worse.
---
Haha, it‚Äôs the opposite, the bitter hateful shit gets the most views. Title your videos like CleanPrinceGaming and you‚Äôre set.
---
No I have not, I have just been exploring up north and ran into 5 codes in an hour.
---
Go and watch it again
---
Cool. On my way, where is the body located? Are you with it?
---
For what I hear Vault 76 has been mentioned in earlier games as well. As the first Vault to open. But I may be wrong.
---
&amp; once you hit Lvl 50, you will max out the amount of points you can apply. At that point, every level up allows you the choice of moving points or grabbing new cards.
---
People tend to enjoy content that they agree with even when its about hating/disliking whatever the video is about
---
You need to make an alt, do the chain
---
Send the low level gun to your main, and you can use parts to craft a higher level one
---
**You require the old gun as parts**
---
 Yes. Do the quest.
---
MTH?
---
My structure takes half my budget and my deco takes the other half.  I got a sliver left for vending and a couple atom shop stuff. How am i gonna decorate with displays?
---
I thought that this sub was the main fallout 76 sub for a while
---
As far as I know you can only modify the one you get from the quest.
---
As when you go to modify it to a higher level, it consumes the gun you already have to create the new one.
---
A more seasoned player might have more knowledge though
---
Have you ever met a game developer before?
---
You‚Äôre a shill
---
The internet is fueled by hate and porn. See, you are angry about them, its a vicious cycle. Probably why more and more people pop pills to cope with life.
---
They definitely need a buff. Unless you‚Äôre planning a play through for a couple of hours, you probably won‚Äôt even get enough resources to justify the cost to build extractors. And that‚Äôs the issue. Hardly anyone takes it to actually use it. Group 1 wants to either to build or complete a challenge. Group 2 is contesting it to force PvP. This has created a system in which nobody is happy.
---
I'd give you 5k for it
---
I agree and in dont think people see the issue. Workshops are useless for their intended purpose. Their only practical benefit currently is taking advantage of inexperienced players through pvp.
---
Lol to a simpleton maybe but how they gonna get 150k. Your delusional no body wants a laser rifle. Pew pew your dead
---
Used to be significant damage because the perks were stupidly good.   Can't guess when folks care that much now.
---
Coordination for events? Maybe for lower level I guess. Witcher absolutely make sense. It's a solo game. You purchased it as a solo experience and there is no reason for ANY micro-transactions. A free DLC for a solo game should always be the case but most studios feel the need to squeeze every dime out of loyal players. Now if you want to compare most MMOs require you to purchase any and every DLC yet 76 is practicing that very Witcher business model you're praising. Being it's an MMO and there's maintenance that comes with it. That maintenance has a cost so there must be revenue streaming in. The solution is cosmetics that have no other use other than "looking cool". If you're that impulsive where you HAVE to buy every flash sale item then maybe you should just play something else. You clearly don't have any self control. And keep in mind if every item in that show was dirt cheap everyone would have everything and no item would lost it's flare. The Atom shop would simply be pointless.
---
Careful, your ignorance about nuanced game mechanics are showing.
---
its at colonel monument fast travel to me
---
Yurp pretty much
---
Exactly, the negative hate videos are for the people that love to hate on Fallout 76. The people that don‚Äôt even play it and just want to be told what a dumpster fire it is
---
If this is you plugging for subs.. think you're doing it wrong, good buddy üòÇ
---
Tarberries can be found in the river north of Watoga too blots more than just what‚Äôs in Flatwood.
---
yeah, id like to see workshop extractors/producers be +50% better then they currently are. and while we are at it they could leave camp ones at their current speed at 100% base
---
I wasn‚Äôt angry, ok, irritated maybe. :)
---
May be easier but nowhere near the same level of pride and accomplishment
---
Or hell just giving you something to work too end game
---
I do now, but I'll probably vend them in my own machine once that's a thing. I think that we're going to see the guys who sell 3 stars for crazy cap values frantically server hopping to grab up everything out of people's vending machines before we kill their market by selling stuff directly to people who want to use them.
---
Although the number of people who inadvertently scrap high value 3 stars for tokens will likely keep the value of some stuff high anyway.
---
Make sure to change this: https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3130/~/setting-power-management-mode-from-adaptive-to-maximum-performance
---
You need to finish the Enclave quest line before you gain the ability to launch nukes, bud
---
**a lot**
---
Seriously man I'm nowhere near as knowledgeable as most of the heads on the trading subs but from what I've read it's def one of the most sought after guns.
---
Not sure if it's quite worth a full set of Sentinel/Assassin Combat Armour but I may be wrong, if you're curious make a post there inquiring on the value and you should get a fair picture.
---
Tested it myself today.
---
PC. Darn!
---
Yeah but you only need like 4 to do the dailies, so unless you want to make a LOT of wine, you don't need a ton.
---
Add me "spmspawnx4" I don't have a mic sorry bout that
---
They are fun/interesting to kill, but hardly anyone who launches nukes decrypts the codes themselves. As the poster said before, we use nukacrypt.com.
---
Must be a bug. I had it the other day. Bunch of them were legendaries. Got some good 3*s
---
I might actually have this. Or something similar. I won't be able to check for a few hours though. I'll send you a PM later if I do.
---
Alright, I'll have to look into it more. Thanks for informing anyways tho
---
Right? I used to have my messages turned off on ps4 so people would message my boyfriend calling me a ‚Äúfat bitch‚Äù lol it was wild but getting yelled at like that was crazy
---
cram them into your player vending machine for 3 caps a nuke, 2 for missiles. someone will buy them... eventually
---
Knew someone would say something but I went with it anyways
---
Dang for whatever reason my phone never informed me that I had a reply.  Sorry!  You still up for it?
---
Oh yeah lol silly me I forgot obsidian entertainment has a *looking* track record of releasing absolute masterpieces.
---
Add me spmspawnx4
---
Marine Tactical Helmet, Im assuming.
---
They need a conversion vending machine. Unwanted ammo goes in and you trade out like another vendor. No caps, just a trade rate.
---
its a common spawning bug, ive seen liberators. level 1 eye bots. and once some level 22 Mr. Gutsy. mostly seems to happen after a nuke zone has vanished and the game scrambles to reset the spawns
---
Barbara and Jimbo. RIP.
---
The gun has a lot of issues.
---
I had a two shot and used the splitter/shotgun barrel and each shot consumed like 30 energy cells. Never bothered with it since
---
Use a sniper barrel and the gamma reciever it boosts ammo count to 15.
---
I'm putting my shop in the forest. Weak enemies and easy access for low levels!
---
Oh well then, thank you. I'll look into it. Doubt I'm high enough love to survive Haha
---
Why did I read this comment in a juicehead voice
---
I have one
---
I'd argue the inverse.  Make mules share caps and would have a hard cap ceiling of 25k which would end the crazy numbers.
---
It‚Äôs all about cap flow it seems like. Caps are already super easy to get and too many in the market will make trade prices insane I think is the reason for it
---
How do people even get mora than 2k caps? I have never had more than 1500 caps. Shit's expensive yo.
---
What's the percentage of caps you lose?
---
Haters gonna hate and ain'ters gonna ain't.
---
I'm gonna get off I'll be on tomorrow tho
---
There's no one answer to that question.
---
Downvoting for opinions is lame, christ it's everywhere on reddit.
---
I don't think it's convenient, it's just true.  And no one should forget what they did to the extremely loyal fallout fanbase.
---
Thank God I decided to wait on reviews.  Wish I would've for BFV.
---
Less about Obsidian and more that you are hating on a buggy mess of a game while defending Bethesda's Rust clone.
---
Exactly, Zero incentive to do these events outside of just doing them that first time. It's May, nobody wants a 1 star item and after 5 straight Fedoras why am I going to try a 6th? I'll just go to the market sub and skip the dumb events.
---
2k for a TSE Tesla is a steal. I wouldn't even consider cap trade.
---
Can't transfer caps solo between characters.
---
Fuck oxhorn. you know he has been using copyright strikes to cover up he was/is a homophobe.
---
Im a loyal fallout fan, what did they do to me?
---
I don't care who you are lol, why should I care if you waited.
---
I just logged out with my silly clown suit at the House of Scares.  Figured if *anyone* walked past, I could hand them my suit and take my chances of it walking.  If not, we could trade snaps.  Waited a bit, the Red Rocket was being defended, figured someone might mosey on over to see what I was up to.  Nuthin'  
---
I'm about to eat, but if anyone on PC wants to catch up in an hour or so, PM me.
---
Shhhhh. Two shot the magic dragon might here you. #mansgun
---
Full disclosure: I spent way too much time futzing with my first build.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the tentacles...it isn‚Äôt good anime porn without the tentacles.
---
Three star Bloodied combat knife with sneak, Incisor, bloody mess and three star unyielding armour.
---
No one in the top tiers of gameplay uses two shot anymore.
---
Yep my husband got 40K for some armour he had
---
I didn‚Äôt know that. I doubt it will change how I perceive his material but it will change my impression of him if true.
---
Yeah well i didnt look at anything else at all. Ive killed 2 in the past 30 minutes and both of them didnt drop loot but it said event completed. They honestly need to fix their shit, beyond pathetic. This glitch has existed since the damn BETA and its still not fixed.
---
well, they may seem very 40k because of it being power armor.
---
I think it is more likely, that they are based on the four horsemen of the apocalypse (emphasized by the "Rider" part): War, Famine, Pestilence and Death :D
---
What are you doing here? Like legit, how did this thread appear in your reddit feed? Do you subscribe to subs for games you think suck? And then feel the need to comment on them saying people that enjoy different games and movies than you do have poor taste and bad critical thinking skills? Genuinely curious.
---
Boyfriend told me he hates fallout 76 today and then I see this :‚Äô) I‚Äôm happy for the ones that do have people that loves spending some time with them though
---
Yeah I think the definition of TSE is misunderstood by many. I‚Äôve see so many ‚ÄúI need a TSE Bloodied Instigating Explosive shotgun‚Äù posts lol
---
Yep!  Fetches 20 a pop base,    Near 30 a pop with perks and charisma
---
And where does the game tell you this information that would have saved countless bags of scrap from vanishing? Nowhere! The mechanics of the game are a black box.
---
Ok that‚Äôs a little more reassuring. I don‚Äôt use power armor either unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary like in nuke zones. And I‚Äôm hoping that losing gear from inventory is player error cause I‚Äôm always very cautious when I sell/drop stuff. I always go back and double check the bag/vendor if I dropped anything important
---
I think Beth should make whitesprings a no camp location but I know it won't happen and it's only my opinion which is worth anything.
---
This could work. Workshop resource extractors should work better than their CAMP versions.
---
Yeah the only place truly without toxicity is r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
I would tend to agree!
---
I'm hoping that there are enough players who aren't playing to sell things for the highest possible amount, but simply because they like playing.  That those players simply would like to have more appropriate gear for their playing style, and would like to help other players achieve that goal as well.  Caps would be irrelevant .... player vending would be just another means to get the things we have to the people that want it, and vice versa. ..... like the many players that already fill the blue suitcases and ice machines with everything extra they have rather than just dumping it in hard to find brown bags out in the middle of no where where no one will find it and it does no use for anyone.
---
Yes please, I think we should have different budgets for different things
---
House budget (House itself along with foundation)
---
Decoration budget (Chairs, beds, shelves, stashes)
---
Resources budget (Water purifier, farm stuff, electricity)
---
Instead once the house itself is built and lined with electricity, you have about 40% budget left to actually decorate the house, and there's no telling how much budget vending is going to take up, I'm worried it's going to be like turrets and take up 45-50% of your overall budget, the reason I think this is going to happen is because your C.A.M.P gets marked as a store on the map for everyone to see, and to ensure every C.A.M.P isn't going to be marked I am willing to bet they will make the budget cost INSANE.
---
Thanks! If I'm not being too rude, you should check out my youtube. I don't have a lot on there, but quality over quantity, right? :p
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lsq\_2GXn2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lsq_2GXn2U)
---
But why have max caps on multiple characters when you even admit there is nothing to buy anyway why not just stop farming caps and play
---
Typo snoring
---
Ive killed event spawn solo and one in thr wild with a buddy.  Enforcer to cripple the legs on occasion, maybe vamp weapon to save on stims.  TBH it would have taken me maybe two stims in T60.  It's a far less risky fight then many others.
---
A guy wanted my two shot fat man and I didn't want to sell it so I put the price high to see of they would but it they didn't
---
Wow, the most caps I've been able to collect so far is 3000 at most.   How do players even get 20-30000 caps?
---
Most video game series subreddits become that way as time passes. I think it's because more entries means more fans with differing opinions on differing games. Eventually they all seem to get filled with circlejerking and memes. Once a series starts growing, I tend to migrate to specialty subreddits. I personally like r/falloutlore but that's just me. It's pretty damn restrictive, so I like to pop in here too.
---
Yeah it's even easier now with the shared cap pool you don't have to fast travel around to sell stuff
---
I‚Äôve seen a couple of traveling bots, one with kitties and one with mongrels - it would be neat if at some point you could adopt them for caps!!
---
I have two of those! 
---
I personally love my vampire Super Sledge with swing speed and strength! üí™üèΩ
---
Yeah it seems like you've got no idea what I'm talking about. That's okay, some people are just a bit slow. I'm saying that Fallout 76 in its entirety is art, and deserves to be preserved as art. Maybe look up video games preservation, because obviously you seem to think that I'm talking about something else, even though I've made it clear as day. 
---
I don't need a book about game development, I've already made a handful of games in my spare time, and created my own 3D engine with C++. I know how long and arduous the process can be to create something with as many moving parts as a video game, and if you did as well you wouldn't want Fallout 76 (or any other video game) to become unplayable for the rest of linear time.
---
Weird that you're on this subreddit yet you seem to have never played the game if you think it's a rust clone lmao
---
Hmm I just had it happen to me again today!
---
Okay!
---
I hope Bethesda is reading this. It‚Äôs really REALLY unwise to limit the availability of your stuff. If you want to sell them, let people look at them. It‚Äôs not like the items occupy any square footage of your physical store.
---
I'd love to ditch Gunsmith and Power Smith, but I'm afraid I would be gimping my ability to upgrade my weapons and PA. What is it that you are doing to keep your PA and weapons up to par?
---
There are pros and cons to rejoining previous server:
---
Pros:
---
You should not lose your workshops on a crash
---
You could rejoin an event you crashed out of such as SBQ (Although thankfully that's not happened for a while)
---
Cons:
---
Some quests can be bugged on a server so you have to hop to fix it
---
Starting some quests like bucket list would be a nightmare (Took me 50 hops to find Ansel)
---
Farming would be severely reduced (I see this as a pro but many others here would go nuts if they couldn't do it without a massive improvement to RNG / legendaries).
---
It would be impossible to get away from griefers (Although adventure changes such as removing camp damage will reduce instances)
---
Personally, I think pros are big enough to forgive the cons.
---
How do you even do this with the limit? Ask them to pay you over multiple accounts?
---
We have been able to sell our ammo to the vendors in the other Fallout games. Should be the same for 76. They put useless pre-war money in this game (76) which is absolutely baffling.
---
I made an a post about this exact thing like 2 days ago and people thought I was just bitching lol
---
That's my worry
---
This would likely be in NV, as most of the computers in the vaults there contained pointers to other vaults and the lore. 
---
If I remember right, there was one that described a LOT of the experiments being tested in other vaults.
---
That's how builds work. They have strengths and weaknesses. Stealth doesn't even work in groups or when there's other people around. This video for example is what this build is best at. Wonder why he didn't show a nuke zone? Because this build can't even function in PA unless you have like 50 cores on you, which is impossible because he has no weight perks.
---
*powder
---
I smash this stupid robot with my full set of troubleshooting armour and vampire explosive 50 cal. 
---
Psn wmcg204 add me if you ever wanna do it, I‚Äôve been getting good drops from this event, especially the 3 star gutsys
---
If you are on Xbox I found a spare broken camera earlier that you can have
---
Legs, what about those nightmare hands?
---
Instigating power fist (puncturing mod) with swing speed. 3rd star is ‚Äúeh‚Äù. 
---
Outside of boss-tier monsters, it‚Äôs all oneshots even with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù stats. My normal-health unarmed dude, about 16? Strength, no bloody mess, oneshots whitesprings ghouls just with normal swings. Power attacks take down supermutants.
---
I'm just biggled.at your free time.  That's 6-10 chars leveled up you care about?
---
Well it's not me, but eirilly looks like an older more grizzled me. Like I sent this video.back in time to myself and its coded with some sort of secret message that I must decode to save the future.
---
A lack of loot has happened to me on a couple of occasions.
---
Thw "internet historian" vid just hit the front page under the r/videos sub, thats a cluster.
---
I believe there is also mention of Vault 76 in Fallout 3, possibly in The Citadel, don't remember exactly but it's talked about on a terminal.
---
Still a constant problem, yeah. Still crashing out of nuke zones down at fissure site prime.
---
It‚Äôs very nicely integrated into the landscape and it doesn‚Äôt look cookie-cutter like a lot of the camps I see. Some support posts would really ‚Äòground‚Äô your design though. Haha.
---
I did it once and it was so, SO busted.
---
I've had over 20 before a few times but it's not common for me. I average over 10k less than 20k
---
Why should a workbench have an upgrade and what upgrades would they be?
---
Making 3 pools for camp budget would be like forcing people to build their camps a certain way, and assuming that camp budget is just to limit the sheer amount of items on a server, doing it that way makes no sense. 
---
Turrets no longer take much camp space at all, and I‚Äôm sure vending is going to be the same. So far it only looks like it will be on vending machine.
---
I wouldn't put YongYea near the others. He just recycles articles and reads them out to you. Crappy neutral at best.
---
Nope, I only have so much room and I usually get crap 1 and 2 star and dont want to keep them so they go for sale all the time... Just dont have space to keep it all....
---
Bloodied pitchfork with the Barbed Flaming  mod. It looks great, has a faster swing speed than the other 2 handed weapons, and more damage than 1 handed weapons.
---
I‚Äôm not farming caps. 
---
I‚Äôm just playing. 
---
Fuck, I don‚Äôt even play much, I play 2-3 hours a day usually. I have over 100 legendaries. I need to sell them sometimes to make room.
---
 I don‚Äôt just dump them because the legendary vendor comes in four days and I want to sell them for scrip.
---
By all means, I enjoy the gatling gun (and its damage to ammo efficiency) too, but I'm just presenting a countercase that it is mostly subjective basis for YMMV. 
---
If someone enjoys or has excess ammo and likes excess Dakka, by all means go prime that minigun. Personally I have lots of ammo and I really should use my miniguns more. I'm not going to run out anytime soon (not that it weighs much).
---
Multiple characters or having teammates pay them as well I assume
---
Watoga is the only place they have changed
---
The butthurt flows through you, padawan
---
This isn't a history of the game. This is a history of the bias YouTube coverage it got
---
nope. i don't have the time to figure out what might be good to someone else, and I don't have the patience and mental fortitude to post and set up trades to other people
---
so it just gets sold to a bot.
---
If you‚Äôre on mobile, the middle text listing the camp items is actually a table, slide the table to view what effects I believe it should carry for each upgrade
---
ME TOO IVE MADE MULTIPLE. I really don't understand some people.
---
As you gather the flux it will come up in the upper left-hand corner of your screen as to what it is exactly.
---
What level was u and he
---
If you dont have an explosive gun, it can take a lot of ammo. When I was below level 50 it took me forever. Shoot for the engines and it will come down quickly!
---
I'm hoping that there are enough players that just want to share the wealth.  Games of chance are less fun, as are ridiculous demands for imaginary things.
---
Given the vast amounts of valuable stuff you find in blue suitcases and ice boxes at railway stations and other high traffic locations, i'm guessing there are plenty of players who aren't trying to dominate a game's economy by getting more than the most possible un-spendable amounts of game currency.
---
But a game like this does allow for a whole variety of play styles interacting, from griefers who do everything in their power to get you to hit them (like jumping between you and monster you are fighting), to pee-wee business tycoons, and everything else.
---
To be fair all most no one wanted PVP in the first place and it was forced in to a PVE co-op game.
---
[Yeah](https://gamerant.com/outer-worlds-open-world-knights-old-republic-2/). It's not open world, instead it's two "planets" to walk through and instead of lots of stuff to explore, it's supposed to be lots of dialogue options. So more ways to get from A to B, but not much random side stuff.
---
 And the plans from the quest.
---
This still happens to me all the time :(
---
I keep hearing different theories about why/how this happens and how to "solve" it, but none of them really work 100% of the time.
---
In other words, this is still a problem and Bethesda still needs to fix it.
---
No.... I made mine for my shotguns but frankly the framing of all the mats to keep the flux to make the ammo is just not worth my time to only get 1 or a few more points of damage over my normal non prime receiver. I just dont think it is worth it for me and I switched back.....
---
Fallout fans have been some of the most toxic people since bethesda took over from interplay. Maybe before. Theres just something about this series that makes people forget to be human.
---
76 reuses virtually every file from Fallout 4 so thats almost definitely nothing more than a left over.
---
First time was a nightmare as it kept zooming down the map but then I realised that taking out the vertabirds that support it first makes it just flys in circles, often dropping right above your head so it has been easy since. I currently have 14 keycards just from random encounters - I've never gone looking for them as part of the quest
---
\&gt; Having no friends,  
---
I highly recommend you make some--and there's lots of potential friends here. Amongst other things, It helps combat the disconnect issue, and avoid longer quests during storms. Once you learn the silo better, the mission only takes roughly 20 minutes, and minimal consumables. 
---
You can rejoin the same server if you befriend anyone on that server, or at least team up with them. Then you can resume mostly where you left off on the silo. You still have to redo the first key part, but everything else remains complete.
---
I see 1/4 on a pretty frequent regular basis... and then nothing else happens.
---
So yeah, there just aren't enough people interested in this.
---
I get disliking it with its release and first few months and all, but how vapid people get over a video game is awful
---
If they released it this year's autumn everything would be different
---
[Skadi](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25307) wants to know your location.
---
Still looks better than the movie Sonic.
---
Yep there are those and I wont call them names because it is ultimately up to us to not carry crap when we are out and about. But there are those who prey on hoping that you drop something good for them if you die.
---
OMG I‚Äôm so excited! I loved all your posts &amp; came here to comment that if you ever sold them, I wanted one! üòÉ Just bought mine &amp; can‚Äôt wait to add it to my Fallout-themed living room!
---
Dragons break very quickly due to the 4 shots being "fired". At least its cheaper to repair than Blackpowder rifles.
---
I'm of the opinion if I purchase something in the atomic shop building it should not count against my in-game build budget. I've already paid for it with Adams
---
 I don't like Bloodied much but I have most of the rest. Knives rule ... stabby stabby. ;)
---
Nah, they are just "purists" on that sub.  Pre FO76 I'd go negative karma just posting positive FO4 things on it.  Last I checked FO4 was the best selling game ever by Beth.  Made the better part of a billion just looking at initial release.  By and large it appealed to a far larger audiance by streamlining it.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie but this subreddit does not fill me with hope at all. We all know there is way more bad things with this game and we‚Äôve even gone as far as to complain for days about something we don‚Äôt like and yet whenever someone attacks the game suddenly it‚Äôs God‚Äôs gift...If we can accept this game is horrendous then maybe we can be better at requesting real change within this game, there‚Äôs no harm in enjoying and liking this game but ignoring many of the problems this game has is just perplexing
---
Obviously they still do. The guys I play with and myself always use tse and rarely get our lunch took. And when we do lose it's to tse even with the nerf, asbestos and fireproof. AND IF TSE IS OBSOLETE THEN HOW IS YOUR TSE LASER RIFLE WORTH 160K?
---
It‚Äôd be really cool if someone who had all the games and a lot of spare time could go through the lore of 76 in past games. It‚Äôd be cool if Bethesda looked at their lore from old games and then updated the quests in 76 over time so we can set those events up to happen. 
---
Either way it‚Äôd be cool to know the other nods in past games, but this is so dope dude thanks for sharing this
---
Hm okay thanks. It's quite annoying though.
---
I was in the WS once, farming it after it was nuked. I was stuck all of the sudden - A player (thankfully for him in power armor) loaded in and then their camp around me. I was trapped in their building and it was locked! They gave the confused emote, laughed over the mic, and let me out.
---
Same it‚Äôs why I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve had this camp for a while now so it means a lot to me.
---
Absolutely
---
Nah that‚Äôs how i‚Äôve been doing it, especially since I usually get pretty trashy drops. Why waste stash space when I could get a few extra caps quick?
---
That said at least now as of Tuesday I can start dumping them in exchange for scrip.
---
I messaged a few people on the server before an event the other day and got a load of abuse back, some just asked why I was messaging which was OK and others were quite rude about it so I won't be doing it again.
---
Think it's the same problem D2 and Anthem had.  For some odd reason an extremely vocal subset expected FtP MMORPG playtimes.  Anything under a few hundred hours seemed to make it a ripoff.
---
Reporting this post, you have my voice in the clip without my permission
---
Did I say obsolete?
---
Also, TSE lasers are not worth 160K it‚Äôs close to 75-80 for TSE.
---
I have a BE. That‚Äôs completely different if you didn‚Äôt know.
---
Exploding energy weapons are worth a lot because energy weapons can no longer drop with the explosive legendary effect.
---
I guess you didn‚Äôt know that either üòï
---
Go do some research about the game and come correct next time you think you‚Äôre gonna burn me with my own words.
---
Actually it was in Fallout 3, Mothership Zeta. One of the captive recordings is from the head of the construction team working on building Vault 76.
---
Mothership Zeta, was an audio log from an abductee
---
Yes, there is a recording of the asst. ceo of vault tec being abducted by the zetans; inside vault 76 during construction.
---
Another way to remove caps would be to remove the ability of Mule players holding them ...... just delete.  Bang ... better economy.
---
First one no, second one yes. Literally every time I go there.
---
Yeah this is 100% my problem my budget is full so no point buying new stuff in the shop
---
I have a couple characters with max caps but I haven‚Äôt been on in months. Those characters had thousands of carry weight though so I‚Äôm interested to see if they had their items removed when Bethesda did that purge
---
My God man, I was talking shit about people downvoting you for your opinion since we were just talking.  
---
They sold you a shitty, rushed, unfinished product that may have broken laws.  I hope you go to the doctor and get some medicine.  Holy shit.
---
Prices will likely plummet after Tuesday.
---
This is why I don't play 76 anymore.
---
Definitely a spawn bug.  I've seen protectrons that Insta die as wrll.
---
I think being able to show your spot on the map means that a popular position (say deep in the mire) May get you some invites for fast travel and a shop.
---
I‚Äôd expect some places to set up around popular events.  I have a camp not far from AWOL armaments so hope this turns out to be true.
---
If you don't want to spend time in market sub or gift them in overseers crates what else could be done?  With no way to solo swap to mules just not much can be done.
---
Oh, I assumed the ‚Äúplan‚Äù unlocked when you got the gun
---
Bethesda seems to have a bad habit of bait and switch.
---
I‚Äôve had 4 workshops for about 4hours in the same lobby, I‚Äôm level 210 I haven‚Äôt been attacked once, I get the whole cap insensitive, but if you follow the rule of Crouc you‚Äôll be fine (:
---
I found a nice lvl 30 TSE peacekeeper that carried me from lvl 30-45, until the nerf.
---
For the former, Im not sure if it's because the game may still be loading (the game is spawning me outside the cavern since I was inside it when the game crashed) when I try to enter it (I don't feel like standing around like an idiot while getting harassed by a scorchbeast that's always there).
---
For the latter, glad Im not the only one
---
I disagree , I've played all the fallouts , we could maybe say multiplayer wasn't asked for but to say pvp wasn't? I feel like that's out there
---
Okay, but Fallout 4 had a bunch of different skins for power armor and you just had to find comic books to get them.
---
Sounds interesting, but not sure what ‚ÄúLobby ‚Äú is.
---
Yeah don't ever mention anything about balancing out well the OP one shot weapons and armor.
---
Main menu
---
Yea. I forgot to mention that one. You do get randomizes stable flux from the queen. Thanks for adding it.
---
I mean, there's a handful of games that have lasted a very long time, people bring up Eve or WoW or Ultima Online and that's all well and good but the majority of games that rely on a central server don't survive. That's why I think it's important for companies to take responsibility when making a game like this and to have at least some plan for if they have to drop support. 
---
See you're the first person here to tell me about private servers being made available. Most of the people in this thread have just been needlessly hostile so far, treating me like I'm stupid for not wanting a product I paid for to self destruct after a given amount of time. So thanks for letting me know.
---
Most of these upgrades look like perk cards. Are you suggesting they stack?
---
NSFW tag admins! You're losing control of this sub!
---
Of all the ideas that come across this subreddit, this is probably one of, if not, the best and well thought out ideas relating to future gameplay implementations. Tying in having the perk card unlocked to have it added to the bench is logical and well balanced.
---
Reduced acid cost might be one of the more difficult ones to balance with how acid usage varies from 1pcs up to 5pcs. Perhaps more material produced when smelting? Could be 50%, 100%, 150%, or even 200% more. Getting 10x lead from 1acid and 2lead ores would be awesome compared to just 5x lead.
---
Worried that people will stop populating the earth over a few atoms? Lol
---
I got stuff on redbubble and lulucom, here's a post for both;
---
https://shia-art.tumblr.com/post/184653370065/as-a-reminder-i-got-some-books-on-lulu-dot-com
---
And I do commissions off and on
---
I dont use turrets. They're a waste.
---
There are metal posts under the stairs section that work
---
Thanks! And I dont know who got the better end of the deal. I had a lot of fun exploring their game and making art about it, I got a pretty awesome experience.
---
Which ones? I thought I was making suggestions that didn‚Äôt involve perk cards unless mentions, eg there is no card for cheaper weapon repairs
---
Ah legacy. Still only worth 50. If it's 160 then what's unyielding sentinel worth. Your still delusional on your prices
---
Its very cool
---
Daily challenges for June 27th:
---
Level up (3)
---
Take pictures of glowing cryptids inside a rad storm (9)
---
Take a picture of a legendary mole rat that dropped a nocturnal wood left leg for the highest level member of your party (minimum 3 player party)
---
At 16:42 CST, take a picture of two people using two matching emotes, synchronized to the same frame, while one of them wears a full suit of unmodded t-45 armor (with a t-51 helmet) and the other wears a full set of raider power armor with a medical torso and explosive vents, all while a 3* legendary sheepsquatch is in the 17th frame of its attack animation directly between them
---
Craft alcohol (25)
---
Yea they work for some spots definitely, but I think some more variations would be nice.
---
I think it's just a way to track your hours played
---
Best weapons are the Deathclaw Gauntlet/Meathook for unarmed, the axes/supersledge/Sledgehammer for 2 handed. Swords are kind of weak but knives are badass. If you're playing for fun then Instigating is by far the best thing you can pick up. Anti armor is badass early on, but doesn't help much once you have the incisor perk. Bloodied is for a dedicated melee build and requires some real specific armor and shit to really get the most out of it. Instigating swingspeed is so good you'll never use anything else ever again
---
Just this very moment, from all the flux I've gathered in blast zones that I never stabilized,  I've been carrying 482(96.4lb) of it on me, it's no wonder I cant get my weight down.
---
May I ask, why in your opinion was Nuka World a bad DLC? Personally, despite just killing everyone everytime I went there, I still really enjoyed the huge sprawling new location and new settlement assets
---
Not related. This has been in since launch. Occasionally connecting to a server will spawn a world-objecy version of a quest item in the players' inventory on the floor under the spawn point. It's inconsequential though.
---
lol I have an unyielding sentinel set
---
People swap these lasers for sets all day every day.
---
I play for karma... When I get a good bit of steel, leather and adhesive I create modded low level armor and pipe weapons. Then I leave ammo, stimpacks, dog food, water, pipe weapons and armor on the corpse outside the door of vault 76. When I started that‚Äôs how I found her. It totally helped me at the beginning so I have been returning and paying it forward every few days for months now. Imagine you come out of the vault and your first discovery is a full set of modded leather armor that you can actually use and a level 5 pipe rifle &amp; pistol that does 60 damage with more than enough 308 ammo to get you to flatwoods. 
---
Btw.., in 6 months of playing I have never been attacked by another player, except that one time when I accidentally stole items out of someone‚Äôs supply drop and I didn‚Äôt know better. Karma works.
---
I'm one of those who's currently at max cap across 5 characters, and using my friends account as a mule for even more. While they have literally no money sink in this game, why not make it unlimited. Caps are useless anyway and the vending machine is not going to change that. Nobody is going to sell great items on them, as those are an item for item trade. (maybe some who don't know the value of stuff)
---
People are selling items/weapons for $30, real money . That shit is much more crazy to me
---
Oooh, you better show me some pictures of it in this living room when you get it!
---
I‚Äôm in that first group. I have no intention in doing anything with the workshop but completing a challenge (and sometimes trying to get the god damn elusive bathroom toilet plan). I‚Äôve claimed them and go on my merry way only to have somebody sneak attack me at some point. My question is: am I in PvP forever after claiming or just in a certain range around it?
---
Stop already.
---
It's a challenge.
---
Thanks for the compliment!
---
I really didn‚Äôt look at specifics so the way certain things I‚Äôve described should be implemented would need to be adjusted eg the acid thing as you suggested.
---
The change you suggested is a good one though, probably better than mine, ultimately up to Beth to decide tho :/
---
It's an absurd challenge that requires almost a year of playtime just for TWENTY atoms.
---
So there's the "take photos of other players", happen to be near vault 76 and see a level 2 so take a photo with her cooperation.  Make a friendly wave.  *Aaargh* I forgot the bug!  Zap!  Die! Disconnect!
---
"It looks like this will be addressed in patch 9"
---
Ehhh that doesn't fill me with confidence. They don't have a good track record of properly patching things, and this bug seems particularly nasty. However I will happily be proved wrong.
---
Even worse are the 3-4 times a day "Is FO76 worth it now" posts.
---
I have a bunch of friends, and those challenges are pretty easy when they're online.  The problem is that they're not always online.  I mean, I'm not crazy about hoarding atoms since 90% of the stuff in the Atomic Shop doesn't appeal to me, but at least the daily challenges give me something else to do besides sell 1400 caps worth of crap to vendors, drink some booze for Biv and make a daily run through my three favorite legendary spots.  The photo challenges are mostly a pass for me when they involve taking a picture of someone in a specific place with a specific outfit, or gathering a pile of specific enemies I need to kill in a specifically placed, orderly little pile in order to get a photo of all of them together, which may or may not actually count for a challenge.
---
Clearly there is no QC involved with daily and weekly challenges.  They're just invented over lunch break as wild ideas, scribbled on a pizza box and let's see how many players will ask how high when we say jump.  I feel like they're largely an inside joke for the dev team, with the most insane idea that gets the most completions being the winner of a free case of beer each Friday afternoon.
---
I think being level 210 is why you haven't experienced it.
---
I'm level 83, use chameleon armour and it still happens to me.
---
Since FO3 actually.
---
Pretty well but your alt needs em' too. Oh. is that the chain? OK. ;)
---
Ah. Thank you.
---
Not on PS4 and this is very specific, but Deathclaws *always* drop some black Titanium, if you can find one.
---
Where is the fun in a game where a player with 3* weapons is impossible to defeat? Where you dare not play pvp cause you don‚Äôt have crazy guns?
---
Obviously a joke challenge and just a way to track how much you've played. No sane person is going to grind out 7600 hours of playtime for 20 atoms.
---
Yeah, I guess mod construction for armor doesn't qualify for white knight. Excuse my quick read. I wasn't thinking of weapon repairs at all, seeing as how those seem relatively cheap to begin with, but I'm not repairing an explosive plasma gatling. Carry on.
---
Yes, that's exactly why. Unfortunately if you did anything in the BETA that would get you a trophy, you'd have to start a whole new character now to get those trophies :(
---
1k for a level 25 pistol with no real power boost.... yeah, no one would give you that much because you are asking too much.   The value listed by the game is about 59 caps.  Your mark up is ridiculous.
---
Its because you reached lvl 10 in the beta. Anything in the beta didnt carry over as far as achievements. Same happen to me i made a new character and got em all after it was released. I still play with my original but thats the only way to get those achievements.
---
Point taken.
---
wouldn't mind that, typo in my name been bugging me from launch.
---
&gt; a LOT
---
Many, FFS.
---
Is there a problem with technical data now?  I keep looting it but itnever shows up in my inventory or activates the mission.
---
You're holding the new camera aren't you?
---
I love being able to play this game with my boyfriend. I'd love to team up with some other couples that play together also. My boyfriend and I don't live close to each other right now, so being able to do everything in the game side by side is really nice.   
---
Feel free to message if you'd like to add me, I really want more chicks to hang out with in game!
---
Is the work station built on some strange edge or over a ledge or something?
---
Looks more like copper to me.
---
PvP is a niche aspect of the game, the majority of us like the hoarding and building and crafting and roleplaying and becoming a demigod aspect of RPGs. The only games i like PvP in are first person shooters. I understand bethesda wanting to push us towards at least trying it, but I think they've already rolled out enough of these to see that most of us do not care about it
---
Make friends.
---
"bud you need to calm down" no man you need to read the text and not project feelings onto the words I post.  Take any perceived emotion out of the equation and take the data at face value.
---
Nah, you'll probably use that as your excuse :/
---
It's not that many caps because they'd have to attempt to claim the workshop every time
---
Don't buy off of them then.  Lots of players with useful stuff that aren't at the limit.  Vending machines eliminates the need to go to griefers who chase you around demanding you trade with them, and shoot you if you don't.  I'm thinking lots of good stuff is going to come available for decent prices ... traditional "Lone Wanderers" of the Fallout franchise would prefer you come to their CAMP, have a look around and buy something you need rather than it be lost to the game's waste bin.
---
And I'm sure that buyers remorse kicks in every time they shoot it lol. Just because they don't make them any more dosen't mean it's good or worth 160
---
I'm about to hop on. I sent  you a request.
---
I am at 800 hours man I cannot wait to get thems fresh atoms boi!
---
I thought we were talking about every single update if so watoga is definitely not the only place that has changed.
---
When you kill them, can you keep killing them again? Or do you have to un-contest the workshop then repeat? Basically what's the best way to do this?
---
My trick it to get help.  If you're at Watoga the robots provide a useful anti-air defense system.
---
I realize that. Just saying it's not really obtainable.  So it's really just a way they gave us to track play time.
---
It was mentioned in fallout 3‚Äôs mothership zeta dlc in a terminal
---
May 2019 still getting dumped from server at least once a day.
---
This shouldn't be much of an issue, a vast majority of the game is static and should be (if it isn't already) completely client-side.
---
Our community managers are frickin dope! [Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ladydevann), you're the bees knees!
---
Floor decor
---
Pre-war money = cloth 
---
cloth + acid = gunpowder
---
its not useless.
---
I also think you should be able to set your camp as visible/non visible on the map so people can find you  if you want them to
---
emreyigit you still doing pictures?
---
I will give you some plastic if you are on Xbox. I'm clearing stash space. Along with anyone reading this, I'm giving a lot away.
---
Currently, you don't.
---
But I wouldn't put it past Bethesda to secretly add a way to get them soon, if not already
---
If be happy if they kept it simple and added use legendary scrip to add extra storage and build capacity.  Like Borderlands did with the purple stuff I forget the name of right now to upgrade item limit
---
As long as it was hard to get like 50 to 100 legendaries worth of scrip = about a 10% increase
---
How is it not?
---
When you already have all the caps you need, selling a great item for just more caps is basically giving it away for free. Of course nobody is going to do that.
---
Why...you like being able to steal without consequences?
---
I don't use pacifist mode...but those who do are using it to steal people's shit with no chance at being attacked for it...its a valid point you stop already
---
Wtf? I been trying to work out how people know how many hours they have played. How do i find this on PS4?
---
You're not the only one I joined the event one violent night and got my ads beat first from the scorch that were already there then the feral ghouls.
---
I normally do a run at Morgantown school and get all the plays, spoons, forks, knives, pumpkins buckets, and golfballs. Then I hit the cat lady‚Äôs house for cat bowls. I get 150-200 plastic in a run (15-20min). And all the golfballs whenever I‚Äôm at whitesprings.
---
Oh I'm not online for now, but I will be online in 30mins and can help to you for pics! :)
---
my current outfit is
---
Ushanka
---
Bottlecap glasses
---
USA flag bandana
---
Bomber jacket (last i played it was purchasable from the atom shop for 800 atoms, idk if its still there)
---
Lol. That‚Äôs where I put my punch bowl in real life.
---
Now imagine that in this example the tax doesn't exist.  They buy an item, then go kill something and get caps.  How is this not making the problem worse?
---
Under floor decor
---
Look for a beer keg, will have an arrow to tab over to your punch bowl
---
Yeah we're different. But i do too have a guy i trade good legendaries for nothing in return.
---
I've seen it on the ground under me when I've logged in or fast traveled before turning it in... more than once. 
---
since the first time of turning in the quest I never saw it in my inventory anymore but have been able to turn it in and sometimes looting it I don't see the quest pop every time but have been and to turn it in.
---
I'm on xbox but it's under the challenge tab when you open the map.
---
Ran to taco Bell.  Will be on in 5 minutes
---
riflegaming is a cool dude i like his vids
---
So far iv'e only seen Nintendo games selling cosmetic's for reasonable prices.
---
The Mii skins in super smash bros only cost 75 cents.
---
Defending the absolute fuckup that was FO76 and Bethesda's blatant greediness. People like you are the problem, dipshit.
---
Thanks, never looked there because I've been focussed on enjoying the game. And trying not to die.
---
I use power armor, but yeah I feel you maybe the rank puts people off
---
Tag plastic as a search item
---
Magnifying glass knows all
---
It's ok. You can curse on the internet
---
Nuka World was designed *only* with the concept in mind that you'll be a raider. There was the barest minimum of efforts made to tell Nuka World's story from a good player's perspective. 
---
Once you do the introduction and arrive in Nuka World there's maaaybe 15 minutes worth of main story if you're playing through as a hero. Find the slave, get the quest to free them, then kill all the raiders. That's it. And there was absolutely no story to the "kill the raiders" plot. You just killed them, and that's it. Once you do that the DLC's hero story is over. There's no "thank you for saving us" celebration, and Nuka World doesn't change in any way. Your actions have zero impact.
---
Play as a raider, go the evil route, and there's easily 15-20 hours worth of main story-related content (including mission times), the entire evil line takes you through all the parks and their storylines, introduces you around the world, and puts you in touch with all the side quests.
---
It'd have been far different had they given you an option to go along with the raiders, pretend you're on their side, kill them by ambushing their own raiding parties, etc. Once you kill the raider boss, the game starts to give your dialogue evil responses almost right away. It's written as if Nate and Nora instantly accept their role as raider boss.
---
They just didn't put a hero's story in.
---
The location was great, the theme parks were well done, and the new area was great to explore. I give them total props there. Bethesda's world building has always been immaculate. But the story...
---
So yeah. I rate it the worst of all Fallout DLCs. If it had a good/bad storyline it'd be something different entirely, but it only gave you the option to be evil... or kill everyone.
---
There should be some sort of stats page where the time played is one of those stats. That'd be the normal way to go about this.
---
There's also a lot of places that aren't worth the trip by itself for plastic but are good places to get plastic if you are there for some other reason.
---
Thunder Mountain, where the tents and tables are, has about 20 or so plastic spread out. I'd love to hear more places to keep an eye out for.
---
That would totally defy the already next to nothing death penalty. You die, you maybe(!) lose some junk. That's how it goes.
---
Not 100% sure of the mechanics. Basically you go to workshop that a player is at (usually I'll tele during a defend event) and wait till event is over. Try to claim and it puts you in combat with the guy. Kill him. When they respawn you're still in combat with them until you finish claiming the workshop then one of you dies I think. I've made over a thousand caps at once from some level 250 in power armour that really didnt want to give up the ammo factory
---
Haha! How many have you played?
---
If you got time I can launch a nuke with you tonight, also on Xbox. Looking for other people to play with.
---
Okay, I need to know....
---
What was his comment?
---
Yeah find corn plant it at your camp let it multiply by replanting it build a water pump and a cooking pot = lots of corn soup and drinking water as well
---
And I'm pretty sure you can build them all from the start though the pump might need you to do the responders quest in which case at up near some water
---
How is it nothing but a FO76 hate circlejerk when the active userbase is so low nowadays?
---
This sub is more popular than the main Fallout sub.
---
I would love to take it off your hands if you haven‚Äôt already found it a new owner! 
---
My build is geared for ranged weapons and I‚Äôve got enough 308 ammo to last two life times. 
---
Thanks, my friend!
---
I love it, so fun to figure out it's secrets.
---
You're *meant* to be able to do this, because you'll pretty much never have the exact right amounts to match up. Particularly with perk packs.
---
The hardest one to get is the Camden Cat costume. The only way to get it is through playing the Camden Daily Challenges. The body suit is 150 coins, the head is 300. Each time you complete a challenge, you get 3 coins. Let that sink in for a little bit.
---
This...this is well thought out I like it.
---
Shopping baskets were my "wait what" plastic item.
---
Legacy Energy? I know what TSE is but I've never heard of that..
---
&gt; I respect opinions. 
---
I don't.  I respect opinions backed by relevant facts.  "IH" made a cheap, unoriginal hit job.
---
I am not saying anything about not dropping junk...im saying taking or damaging anyone's stuff causes pvp to trigger except in thid case...at the very least stealing junk should kick them from pacifist mode and allow that person to try to get their junk back
---
I‚Äôll gladly take some :D
---
Cool thanks, you need any of the pics too?
---
I think it's mostly a joke, but as a way to keep track of hours played it's pretty great. It'd be cool if instead of 20 atoms you'd get like 76.
---
Complete opposite for mine. No planning at all. When I leveled up I took what ever available perk helped me the most at that point.
---
Keep looking around. You might find the secret "ghost".
---
I love my 3 star ghoul slayer fire axe with SS...I feel the need..the need for speed mother goose
---
People: bring up a single, clearly negative point about a poorly-constructed and problem-riddled game
---
u/THRDStooge: you're simply mining for things to hate on
---
I guy said on this sub before that of you personally don't inflict at least 1% of the total damage you get no loot and that goes for all enimies.  So even though you are using all that ammo you might be too weak to actually matter?
---
Where in floor decor? I‚Äôve gone through back and forth. It‚Äôs not there for me. It shows owned in atom shop.
---
Maybe I found another bug. :(
---
A friend logged into his account and ALL of his junk was removed from two of his characters.  Bethesda replied to his ticket that it was something he had but wouldn‚Äôt specify what.  He thinks it was flux he bought from another player.  This is a pretty big thing right now.
---
To have all white walls in every room using brick, put down doorway walls first as they can clip into each other and then just rotate them. Then you just replace the doorway walls for solid walls. The hard part is probably adding a roof to it depending if you use half walls on top of the solid walls.
---
Sorry bud, thanks, but not online :(
---
Basically attacking me
---
I mean, challenges are pretty much your stat page, you just get free atoms for doing stuff.
---
I'd be fine with an equivalent for them. Like a different chem that highlights enemies or even containers. 
---
Maybe they could use the gutshrooms or something.
---
Im gonna try to go on later tonight if you're still on. Will send you a request when I can
---
Oh It's okey, If you need about it, don't hastitate to ask for. If I'm online I would like to help you. :)
---
I'm down, but it'd help to have more people. People will probably show up, though.
---
Laser guns dropped by mutants.  Another reason westek is so popular.
---
Idk im level 115. This stuff shouldn't be happening.
---
What? There is no data here what are you referring to look I get why you felt the need to apologize all I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs unneeded it‚Äôs an online game and your acting like killing players is some horrible deed I suppose the reason is because most fallout players don‚Äôt play online games and don‚Äôt have experience with other player interaction I‚Äôm here to point out that you don‚Äôt need to apologize for using an in game mechanic and judging by the down votes by the players it further proves the 76 fans are indeed sensitive I‚Äôm trying to discuss this topic and your all acting like I‚Äôm some horrible person I mean honestly play any other online game cause you will be in for a rude awakening
---
That works too! Toxic goo could be used as an ingredient to make em
---
Brilliant, just as people wished the same on a smaller scale foe The Burrows.
---
Problem is, I don't believe they have any real instancing set up yet. Maybe they've looked into it, maybe not.
---
Everyone keeps hoping that the vault raids will change this non-instanced trend.
---
Oh nope, I already completed them, but thanks.
---
You made this sound a lot shadier than it probably is.
---
Best one so far, a wave of bloated glowing ones at white Springs were half underground while still alive fighting robots. Crazy.

I don't mind the drinking too much, but I'd love it if they mixed things up a bit and occasionally gave us something like drink 10 nuka sodas or so many different nuka beverages.
---
Doggggg Bowlllll
---
I don't know why I like them so much, I think they're just 1 or 2 plastic. Cat bowl too, I think.
---
They're pretty abundant though.
---
Will be checking later today, only been playing for a couple of weeks as work n family allow üò•

Focus on the positive. Enjoy wholesome posts on this sub like this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bkh01y/i\_sent\_bethesda\_my\_fallout\_76\_journal\_they\_sent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bkh01y/i_sent_bethesda_my_fallout_76_journal_they_sent/)

200 plastic at whitesprings, golf clubs, the trash can behind the clubhouse has like 30 plastic alone, golf balls, assorted nuka cup packs and nuka cups with straws. It‚Äôs everywhere.
---
You can just use VATS too, as long as your not noticed yet. Crouch, approach mob, vats a shot in and bingo bango bongo.
---
Traveling Leather Coat and Leather Coat, I‚Äôd say.
---
I get the idea behind it. Trying to encourage exploration/emergent gameplay/teamwork/etc. However, the conditions required to complete them are ridiculous. 
---
We shouldn't have to tab out of the game in order to find other people interested in earning a whopping 10-20 atoms.
---
Here's a suggestion for bethesda: How about instead of giving us a small handfull of daily/weekly challenges that are themed around whatever big thing just came out with the recent patch, you give us twice the amount of challenges per day + week and set a limit on the atoms that can be earned from them. 
---
This would allow for you to reuse older challenges while also being able to throw in newer ones, and it would give the playerbase more options to choose from to earn their daily/weekly atoms.
---
Technically the game is a mess at times....but it's FUN!
---
Actually it is. They added a flag on all the enemies in Watoga bots that disabled legendary spawns. As for other places that's just based on rng and enemy level
---
Spoiler:  You find a pool full of pre-war money.
---
The moment you drop loot - intentional or not - it's not yours anymore. So no one is stealing anything, simply collecting. This is by intend and was communicated from the beginning.
---
I'm at 1100 hrs atm . But dont play as much anymore
---
Yeah well. Let's face it.  People would rather play with adults if that's what they want.
---
Some don't care.  But I don't need a kid screaming REEE in my ear
---
how about a purple mist for alive targets, green mist for dead ones/meat piles?
---
Yes thats correct but a its better and cheaper to ask someone to help transfer caps rather than getting a new character.
---
But thats just my opinion
---
I‚Äôm level 123 and didn‚Äôt get the trophy for level 100 :(
---
I'm sure they have plenty of buyers remorse as soon as they shoot it lol. You would have to have two live accounts to even pay that much. Not worth any where near that. I'll stick with my BE hunting I got for 1.5. And if they are being traded all day every day they ain't that rare a?
---
Yes this is just a way to track how long u have played it is not serious
---
Debuff:  Child Support.  Periodic cap loss.
---
Whatever they need to do to fix the SBQ. It's absurd that this many months after launch, the final boss fight is still regularly bugged.
---
I never said the game wasn't shit when it launched. The servers crapped out every few seconds, duping should have been resolved long ago, weapons still aren't balanced and there's not enough content. Most of which are fixed but some still exist. You're clearly a dope with that flaccid rebuttal. Had you bothered to read, which you clearly didn't, the topic was about cosmetic purchases. Great job attempting to inject yourself into this discussion and failing.
---
But you also always had a way to get it back...the current settings of pacifist mode hinder that entirely...your point has some merit but things have changed since the beginning
---
Never said I was selling it. I said nobody would even give 1k for it. 
---
It has extra limb damage and VATS accuracy on it as well.
---
But you cant use it as money. Especially odd since other fallout games are hundreds of years after the war, but 76 is only 25 years.
---
I can answer this! As a native West Virginia, I think they are just going for historical accuracy, can confirm beer everywhere.
---
I bought metal security doors plan today and am unable to see where they would be located. I've looked in walls and see "power doors" but not security doors. Am I looking in the wrong area? Help please and thank you.
---
Ja taidat olla suomalainen
---
This is kinda why I hate player decided prices cause they‚Äôre usually ridiculous and not even worth the price people set them at
---
Ahhh I see, so while it's contested, you're "in combat", and you reckon if the workshop changes hands or returns to the owner, it ends upon the next kill?
