Scabs

Exactly, I feel like if the game is making money people like todd say yay all is good while we make money. They ignore that they could be making much more - plus not piss the fans off.
---

---
Back in the fallout 3 days I bought all the dlc for that, new vegas, 4. I didnt buy fo76 and I am just one example.
---
I bought every wolfenstein except the latest one with the twins - I dont even know the name.
---
Doom was amazing and I would have bought single player dlc for that but it was all multiplayer dlc which they later gave away for free, shitting on the people who did buy it
---
Sure, some people are uninstalling, but they aren’t the ones doing posts every 30 seconds here.
---
The ones here...  It is popular to karma whore on reddit - especially on this subreddit when it comes to Bethesda.  Jump on the bandwagon with the kewl kids, pretend like you are actually standing up for your ‘beliefs’...
---
Games being designed in such a way that the purchase of additional microtransactions is heavily incentivized and as such the base experience being purposefully and knowingly made worse is documented well enough. Publishers don't put those things in for people *not* to buy. Also, legality is a weird point to bring up because first off the law is not absolute, there can very much be a discussion about what laws make sense and which ones don't. And secondly, it is slow to catch up to new developments. Lootboxes are on the radar for many countries right now.
---
With pointless posts like these going up constantly i dont know why fallout devs would even come here for feedback for constructive criticism. Its a post with zero substance.
---
No but they can freely take from any unlocked water purifiers or resource collectors
---
Outer Worlds is great. Been playing for a couple of hours. It is very similar to New Vegas and it's more fallout than fallout 76.
---
"lobby's" = "lobby is"
---
I think the word you are looking for is "lobbies".
---
I can steal your purified water though, so lock your purifiers.
---
I just pity Bethesda at this point. They've managed to remain clueless as to what their community actually wants from their games. 
---
From what it seems, they're desperately attempting to both improve the game and increase their revenue by a lot and end up failing at both.
---

---
&gt;the legatus pack 
---
No, thats Star Citizen. 
---
To be fair to other games companies, Noone comes close to the amount of money SC squeezes out of people for stuff like that.
---
Sure does !!!
---
What would be the point? If they did, y’all would just shit on it.
---
I disagree..to me, it sounds like you already give up on Bethesda, and true perhaps I DO care a bit too much about all this , but they were my favorite company, i'm hoping all this backlash set them on a better path
---
Downvoted by people who pay for things that dont work and in fact loses scrap items for u
---
It's people like you who enabled and encouraged Bethesda to be this way. You're just as much at fault as Bethesda is.
---
That's a big eye roll from me, they literally miss nothing besides gatekeeping who they play with. A start for free pay-to-play game locks the strong majority of their content behind a pay-wall, not just a simple "private" server. 
---
This is hardly "marketing tactics of a free to play game."
---
We would probably be allowed one guest. I got you man.
---
As long as it keeps tards like you busy, I’m happy.
---
Love it
---
Wow you certainly got your money’s worth!
---
Is it?! Thank you
---
Stop comparing some video game microtransactions with "predatory business practice "  that's absolute bullshit.  Real predatory business practice, Is things like payday loans, pawn shops,  no credit check auto financing.  These are practices that prey on poor people, people that have no other option.  They hit people, in times of need, with ludicrous interest rates, or fees that the people cant possibly afford.  A game company. Getting some sucker to spend $20 on a stupid digital outfit, or digital gun, IS NOT THE FUCKING SAME!!!
---
Not convinced anyone ever actually bought a repair kit. Literally everyone I play with has a stack of the ones the SBQ drops, why would anyone even need the atom store ones?
---
You pay $100 a year for something that doesn't even reward anything good.
---
Do you ACTUALLY, TRUTHFULLY think that paying either $13/month or $100/year for virtual goods (some of which that have been causing issues for other players) is a good way to spend your money? We don't have to play the game to know how to be sensible with our money.
---
Bethesda doesn't need people rushing to reddit to send them messages... they run the game and have all of the data they need on how many people are playing, how often they're playing, if they're uninstalling the game and most importantly how many people are actually buying stuff in  the end anyway.  Look at the shit storm that went down over the "p2w" collectron and now you can barely visit a camp without hearing bad jokes about scrap.
---
Hi OP's alt. This comment is equally as stupid as the thread. It's literally predatory practices at work
---
Once you start paying for my Fallout 1st service, then you can start telling me what to do with my money; oh wait
---
Yeah, on the store it is $24 for regular and $30 for the tricentenial edition.
---
To be fair--and I'm talking about the industry as a whole now and not just FO--sometimes it's not completely their fault.  Companies are increasingly using unethical/quasi-legal tactics to hook people.  Many games have on-staff psychologists who work to make the microtransactions more alluring and the game more addictive.  I've spent a lot of time with mobile games and I don't think PC gamers realize quite how bad it is there, how many dirty tricks are used to part people from their money.
---
Many gamers also don't realize that FO76 is part of a wave of PC games testing whether mobile monetization can work with full-priced regular games.  You see some of the same dirty tricks and strategies--I believe the Atom Shop has done a few things that would be outright illegal in physical stores, depending on where you live.  Scarily, the answer seems to be yes, said monetization does work.  PC companies aren't even good at it yet--it's way harder to fall for Activision or Bethesda's bull than the master swindlers in mobile--and even then it's still proving very profitable.  Because some people will fall for anything and making the scam super blatantly only reduces the % that fall for it...and a tiny % is enough to be profitable.
---
Lmao. You are so far gone.
---
I'm very not impressed, and rather peeved, by the new P2P/P2W model. The unfortunate reality is people are buying it, which is why they did it in the first place. A company made something some people want, its bringing in more revenue at the cost of a once dedicated fanbase. That once dedicated fanbase may never spend $60 on any of their games again, but the people who like it, make up for that with less than a years subscription. They rolled the dice on what they did, but the dice were loaded.
---
Don't hate the consumer for a company's actions, hate the company. At the same time, if it proves to be popular (and profitable), they're going to keep doing it. When it comes to entertainment, not a lot of people don't think about the business ethics behind it. If you like it, you like it, and if you're willing to pay for it all the better for the company. The fanbase for the original Fallout game may very well no longer be a cash cow and it's time to bring in the next generation who has grown up with microtransactions and don't find it offensive and irritating. $100 a year for two years is a lot better than $60 once and people unwilling to pay real money for atom shop items.
---
Still pissed they lied though and focused on the paid part instead of a major update for everyone.
---
I think paying what they want is totally worth it if they allowed you to customize the world in some way as well as allowing them to be dedicated where anyone can join. This would at least give hosting players more control over the environment and potentially kicking griefers. As it is now I don’t feel there’s any advantage over a public world, but some subscribers might disagree because of the scrap boxes.
---
I would give Bethesda hundreds of dollars if they actually gave us content like the real fallout dlcs. They certainly aren’t catering to me ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Shit, Anthem is better than Fallout 76..
---
The only people to blame are the gamers.  If you continue to play a game you feel is broken, and then spend extra money on said "broken game " you really dont have much of an argument.  But I do agree with your general point.  I dont buy mtx in games, so I would prefer if games could get cooked s little more.  But at the same time, the majority of online games tend to be buggy messes, so I geel.like it's just kind of what to expect
---
It wouldn't mattered for anthem because it's a complete waste no matter what they added
---
There’s no money in ads unless you’re Google or Facebook. If they want to make money they need to stop making themselves a target. 
---
Bethesda fixes this mess in 3 steps: 
---
1. Kill the Scrapbox, make all scrap weigh zero and apply it to everyone. It’s not really a good selling point and it’s pissing off the entire world. Just make that problem go away.  Promise not to do anything stupid like that again. 
---
2. Give subscribers some real controls on their servers—privacy options, toggles for things like PvP rules, ability to kick players, control for number of players etc.—or at least provide a time frame for when that’s expected.
---
3. Offer 2 lower tier subscriptions. One that’s just for private worlds, another that gives the Atom bundle, exclusive cosmetics etc. Each one should be $7.99mo or $64.99yr. It would be more value for money to get both with Fallout 1st, but not everybody wants that. Choices are good. Lower price points are good. Good things are things that Bethesda needs right now.
---
I know, and i don't disagree with that. 
---
From what I've seen elsewhere the whole premium thing seems to be selling pretty well, and us on reddit don't speak for everyone. 
---
So to keeps things less stressful, it's best to not concern yourself with what you can't change.
---
There's two dances! Protectron robot and Mothman rave. Both pretty good. I agree with you, I don't even keep junk, but ESO had the same thing so they just took it from their other game
---
Ill keep playing because i think its fun and im a big fallout fan. Im not going to give them any money in the atom shop, definitely wont buy a subscription to their private servers. But i will keep playing because this game has massive potential and i hope over time it becomes the game i think it could be
---
&gt;I 100% agree. Its popular to be toxic
---
  
---
I always see the 'positivity first' bring this up immediately any time there's criticism against their preferred game, but there's more to the argument than that.  It's not that we **want** to be toxic, nor am I toxic to other players in games I play.  Youtube/Reddit, at least for games, are largely discussion platforms.  
---
I recently played through Metro 2033 and Last Light - phenomenal games.  Have I posted about this on reddit or youtube?  No, because there's nothing to discuss.  I could go and say 'this game was amazing, this was my experience' etc...but that's a pointless interaction, its just circlejerking and doesn't accomplish anything.  There's very little to discuss or game theory to improve upon.  The game was good, it was designed well, there's not much else to say.  If you're a content creator for gaming news on youtube there's just nothing to cover about a game that did well.
---
There's just more to discuss about a game that is horribly messed up and broken.  I could maybe write 2 pages on Metro's design, whereas I could easily write a 50-page essay on why FO76 is arguably the single best example of poor design and implementation of a video game.  You might choose to take that as me saying 'how dare you enjoy FO76' but it's not.  
---
It's great that you can enjoy it and if you so choose by all means do so, but there's probably strong reasons why you can enjoy it while others can't, like a lack of general experience with games (the fewer games you've played, the less you have to compare to, the lower your general expectations - applies to other mediums as well like film or books, food, etc).  I.e. if you've only ever had a $5 steak you might think its pretty good, but people who've had a $50 steak will disagree with you.  Maybe you're just less invested or Fallout is the only games series you play - this radically changes your expectations and requirements.  Other factors like time spent with the game (it breaks more the longer you play), investment in gaming (someone who plays games 2 hrs a week will care less than someone who plays 10-20hrs a week, the hobby is just less important to them), general skill level (there are players of all skill levels, nothing wrong with that, but more skilled players will push a game harder, and the harder you push the more likely a game will break, with FO76 a light tap will do it).
---
&gt;I have always found the community in-game to be overwhelmingly positive.
---
This has more to do with a smaller more focused community than anything.  In any community, people will be nicer/less toxic in a smaller community (think of small towns vs cities) if simply because you can't afford to be mean in such a small group.  Secondly, pretty much everyone playing FO76 falls into the same category of player, so it's easy to get along.  This isn't specific to FO76, and is true for just about any small gaming community.   This isn't a legitimate defense for FO76/BGS's actions.  Saying a non-zero amount of people are extremely happy isn't a relevant point of discussion.
---
I know this will get down-voted into oblivion, but my intention was to show the other side of the argument in a logical manner.  I don't intend to offend people, but I suspect I did anyways.  Bringing up skill always gets people mad, but it's an important aspect of games that needs to be discussed so everyone can enjoy games.
---
Mine works. So does my buddy's.
---
&gt; The game had plenty of issues but the whole package ended up more competently delivered than Fallout 76.
---
That's where I completely disagree with you. BioWare mis-managed everything about that game, and continue to mis-manage it to this day. They weren't able to follow their road map for even a month before they started cancelling things, eventually to the point where they cancelled not only their road map, but the core idea of having a 3 act structure for future content.
---
At this point in Anthem's life, only 8 months in, there's nothing to look forward to, other than "core gameplay changes" and "seasonal events" using re-used assets. It's essentially in maintenance mode already.
---
Definately not an alt account, and please, tell me how this is predatory...  but before you do, actually look up what predatory business practice means
---
aww thought it would be Mothman :-(
---
Awesome. And did you test all the triggers for scrap deletion?
---
Do not support a company that actively lies and breaks promises to its customers.
---
anyone who bought the subscription deserves any bugs and to get treated like shit/ exploit for being such idiots.
---
Or people that dont have a complete mental breakdown when something doesnt go there way. All this salt actually got me curious enough to reinstall the game and buy a first sub for a month.
---
I like it when you are level 5 and can't go and face an army of lvl 70 supermutants. 
---
It Is nice to be forced to run, sometimes.
---
u/nvKiaeneto, big tough guy acting like a big shot and then turning off inbox replies. People are allowed to complain. Take Bethesda's dick out of your mouth for 10 seconds. This isn't China, it's not positive messages only. How about, if you don't like seeing all the comments, leave instead? Take yourself out of the equation, instead of expecting everything else around you to change.
---
"If you see an asshole in the morning, you saw an asshole. If all you see is assholes all day, you're the asshole."
---
I played since release up until last month. Spent money here and there on cosmetics and such. It just got boring. New content is far between and a let down every time. Remember when the barrows was all hyped up just to be twenty minutes of a boring tunnel? It's just letdown after letdown. The loss of survival hurt. Wastelanders pushed back and now it wouldn't surprise me if they put it behind a paywall and call it a service. There are too many good alternatives to spend any more time here.
---
Does anyone know if the survival tents mean a potential increase in players being unable to spawn in with the C.A.M.P.  when a tent is in the area?
---
They should make a deathclaw gauntlet model as well and just have it at the side to compliment the trophy
---
That'd be great, but as a vet past level 150, it doesn't feel too unfair. To me, that much junk is so unnecessary
---
Also, learn when to actually use the term "literally"  because you literally couldn't be more wrong
---
In truth, i've never really been all that concerned with Bethesda itself. I like some of the games, but the going ons of the company really wasn't my immediate concern.
---
They just bought another game company to  focus on mobile. So #3 is basically a go.
---
Hahaha you really got me internet muscles. Only if I traded my s10+ in for some food and shelter for a night or two 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . Haha you spent a 100 bucks on shit that's not even working right. Tell me how private your servers are 😂😂😂😂😂. Did u lose hrs worth of scrap like most lol. Can I have since I'm so poor and homeless I could really use a hot meal 😂😂😂😂😂. Ty I needed that . Been a little bit since I've laughed that hard.
---
With all due respect mate this subreddit doesn't get the numbers to Karma whore anything.....
---
Bethesda also failed to claim their domain for Fallout1st, so this website exists.
---
 [https://falloutfirst.com/](https://falloutfirst.com/) 
---
It sums up what they have done pretty well!
---
What system?
---
It’s amazing how hard you guys are trying to justify scamming yourself. “Smart move economically” lmaoooo good one!
---
If you play the game, and stop reading about it online, you’ll have a much better time. I’m level 228 and the game is even funner at high level.
---
I waited eight months before buying F76; based on issues (bugs) flagged during reviews.  In those reviews or my many months of playing, never once did I feel Bethesda didn't deliver what they said they would.
---
Obviously they didn't provide what some wanted, but that's a matter of personal opinion; hardly a matter of consensus.  
---
They are now providing a new paid option that certainly gives a modest advantage in gameplay, but is largely for those wanting a degree of privacy and/or a path to more diverse customization.
---
I used to play a half dozen new games each year.  Now I'm focussed on two or three.  I'm happy to focus my game budget on maximizing/extending my enjoyment of those...F76 being one.
---
Glad I could make your life better. I've had no issues since getting 1st and I've been having fun thanks.
---
Emphasis on functional
---
what's the point of karma? I don't believe in Karma irl nor see a point to it on reddit.
---
&gt;Yeah they might have said it would be cosmetic only before the game came out because they thought they could rely on that income but they found out they couldn't so they had to switch up how they got more income to keep the servers up, pay the devs, continue on making content and of course make a profit.  
---
#Then why don't they just fucking come out and say that?! 
---
Own it, say *"We thought we could keep this going one way but we have to change course"*. Don't spoon feed me bullshit like, *"the community has spoken and demands we add non cosmetic items to the Atomic Shop"*.  What community? Is there another (bigger) one besides Reddit that is giving opinions to BGS? All I hear is disdain from the community following this decision to monetize the game.
---
I know, right? We can't always protect stupid people from every snake oil salesman, but when these people start playing the victim card and claim its not their fault in order to avoid any responsibility, then it becomes simply infuriating.
---
If its been down that long and went down that abruptly, I'd imagine this is emergency maintenance, not something that was planned.
---
Im one of those ppl who dont care about the politics and just want to play games, always. But they have been so evil with this game that even i won't be getting their games anymore
---
I can't even find the tent thing.
---
And it was clear OW is made with an engine similar to NV's.  They have more funding and time they could've spent any amount of time modernizing it.  They could have just released a co-OP mode as DLC.  It's no excuse for a 60$ single.
---
Yeah
---
Pssst. 
---
Anthem was always in maintenance mode. It got shipped half broken to a different, smaller developer that is also supporting an mmo that is getting its first new expansion in years.
---
The need for bulk is limited to selling now. Just scrap your bulk and put the materials into your scrap box, takes 3 seconds.
---
The survival camp is wonderful and really helps make the Scorchbeast Queen fight more convenient for those of us who farm her.
---
&gt;delayed dlc multiple times
---
Really? Funny I thought there was just one delay of wastelanders. Who knew!
---
&gt;they make us pay for what should have been free. They don't listen to their fans. 
---
What have you had to pay for that should have been free? Also, why should it have been free?  As for not listening to their fans, they've added a ton of stuff people have asked for...and ya, that they'd said they be happy to pay for too. Do a search of the sub if you actually want to know the truth. 
---
&gt;Again, all they want is our money.
---
Well, they are a business and businesses do exist to make money. As a side benefit they employ a lot of people making decent salaries and pay a huge chunk of taxes that benefits everyone,  just like all businesses.
---
I agree!
---
Not if they just made it all weigh zero and didn’t have another box. It’s the new mechanic that caused problems.
---
I could post just a title of “Fuck Bethesda” and a description of “blah blah blah blah” it will get several hundred upvotes in 1-2 hours, even if no one reads the actual content of the post.
---
Yes.

Hello Leaving, I'm dad.

(Also nice choice quitting)
---
We're playing on pc!
---
I've been in this sub for months. When was it interesting stuff and not "Bethesda please"?
---
Good to know. I was thinking about trying it out.
---
Server maintenance isn't gong to fix many (if any)  game bugs.   That needs to be done via patches.  It sounds more like their server farm is throwing an unexpected fit and they're scrambling to calm it down.
---
New theory: the character you play is the Lone Wanderer after the Mothership Zeta DLC
---
Lol wow
---
Ty for the link
---
I tried placing the CAMP placement on top and it works but I cannot place base structures on any part of the main monorail support, on top or in the “hole”.
---
Agreed, I've been in other games that have 'bad press' like Star Citizen, so I should know better. It honestly was running better than I expected. I'm genuinely excited to get into the game.
---
Same here
---
Yo so I've been following this sun reddit just to see the state of 76 and due to the lack of improvements as stated by yall I'm prolly never gonna play it again.
---
One could tell you the same thing...
---
i did the opposite.  I actually like Fallout 76.  but perhaps because i wisely waited and did not buy it at launch.   I played the beta then cancelled my preorder (w00t my level 5 character is still there lol) 
---
but just got it on sale on the store ..got the fallout first subscription and i even just ordered the CE guide book with map cuz well i like maps and while there are online maps it provides a nice area by area overview and such.   
---
i suppose for those who have been playing for a full year now your sick of it and sick of how they delayed wastelanders and are upset over the fallout first subscription
---
granted it has issues i havent used my super scrapbox yet (i am no where near my weight limit on my regular one so ill just use that for now hopefully they will fix the bug with the 1rst version by the time i need it lol.
---
but private servers..the main thing  seems to work for me. i havent seen any odd issues that others have reported. no other other players seem to join the map..the public workbench/zone areas seem to not be already occupied on the map and it actually does give a much different feel to the game.  more akin to fallout 4.. Not exactly of course you still have to eat and drink (hate that really but perhaps as i level up and gather more resources that wont be much of an issue) .. while it lacks real npcs and a real story quite honestly the fun of fallout 4 was just exploring the world. and i really like the look of the world of fallout 76 i think honestly thats where it shines the most.......yes it could have been fleshed out more yes they are glaring issues but......if your an explorer and that was one of your main draws of prevous games  and you coudnt give a shit about the multiplayer part.   I think 25 bucks for the base game plus 13 a month (for now) is fine.   HOPEFULLY they may actually listen to the gripe and eventually come out with full free private server tools.   but if not.  Meh.  I like the world of fallout 76.
---
though i wish you can adjust things like spawn rates maybe even having the option to change the time of day if you are the only person in the world or even disable hunger/thirst down the road. BUT.
---
and yeah as for the perks ..pay to win maybe? but hey if your running around in a solo world doesnt really matter anyways now does it? lol
---
HOPEFULLY they will see the hate and fix some things.  but i dont want private worlds to go away.   Just needs some adjusstments (fix friends coming in without asking..thankfully i have no friends LOL)
---
but i understand the hate. i do.  For those who got it on day one....for 60 bucks (or more) by this time have likely explored every inch of the map (even though its pretty damn big) .....want npcs and stories or something "More" and getting pissed that wastelanders is delayed for this......i get it.   and perhaps people who still buy the game and subscription anyways should be hated on because they are saying what they are doing is OK. 
---
lol buttttttttt in the end of the day all i really care about is a cool world to explore and i kinda wanted to personally check out the private server issue myself if it was not working at all id validate the rage. But it is......you just need to dump your friends list LOL LOL
---
but for me its actually a step closer to what i want it to be not a step backwards. Fuck multiplayer i wanna play it my own way LOL. and now i can .
---
but keep up the rage maybe they will listen lol.   Thats fucked up about the scrap boxes.. thank God i knew about that before hand lol. but mine is only like at 50 out of 800 so by the time i actually DO fill it up maybe the unlimited one will be fixed
---
though quite honestly i would be totally for removing it from the first package and giving players unlimited stash (or say bump it up to 2,000 or something like that)   if it would please the crowd.
---
but the cost for private servers is a legit cost as it requires them to use more space to use it.  and they seem to be actual private servers  just a few glitches at the moment.
---
but im gonna update my amazon review from 1 to 3 stars . as to me fallout 76 is not absolutely terrible. 
---
and at least im not the only one who thinks so because if i was then no one else would still be playing
---
am I RITE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
lol
---
i love the world of fallout 76 but yes there are GLARING issues.
---
it kinda like the Washington Metro . I love it even though there are some MAJOR issues with it lol
---
Yep. BioWare Austin. I wonder how far away they are from Bethesda Austin. They should have lunch together and talk about their games together. Do some brainstorming. Some soul searching.
---
They sold you a broken game and want to charge you $5 a month to fix it to make it work like it should have originally.
---
That's the very definition...
---
Horizon Zero Dawn is amazing. Even picking up collectibles had some effort put in. I don't want to spoil anything but each type of collectible has a different way of getting it. With some open world games I often forget the main story because of all the side missions, Horizon definitely has a bunch but they are nicely spaced out and for me at least, feels like the right amount of content. 
---
Spiderman is a fun game. Felt shorter than Horizon Zero Dawn to me and you can traverse the open world quickly. It has a decent story and good variety of activity. The fighting is similar to the Arkam games.
---
I'm not justifying anything,I'm answering the question YOU asked. But you didn't really want an answer did you, you just thought you were being snarky. I'm only stating a fact anybody can check for themselves. If you regularly buy atoms, you can get the sub and get the same atoms for roughly half the price plus all the other benefits
---
Are you Bugthesda trolling me now i just tried doing Vault 94 with a friend then suddenly i stopped doing damage and instead started healing the enemies i was halfway through when this happened i lost so many health kits and bullets, you ever going to fix the damage bug instead of trying to scam ppl???
---
You can take every workshop on the map with zero threat of attack from other players.
---
You can rejoin the server if you get kicked.
---
You can safely use any world container to mule items without fear of players stealing them, or getting kicked from the server and not being able to re-join.
---
You can have entire nuke zones to yourself and force respawns by leaving and rejoining.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nope no advantage at all /s. I don't even care about that though. That seems unavoidable and even justified considering you are buying your own server. It's the scrapbox and tent being tied to the service that insults me.
---
Terrible idea btw OP. Man what is happening to gamers? Suggesting forced ads to get limited access to P2W features. Yeesh.
---
That's not true. Twitter activism works quite well. The problem is there's no social harm angle they can use to tip them to change policy
---
I am sorry but I strongly disagree , this is larger than just FO76 , this is revolving the entire industry trend right now.
---
For years we gamers have been treated like dirt , with almost EVERY triple A game that came out either unfinished and in a poor state and heavily monetized or just heavily monetized , and it's all because of the f\*\*\*\*\* idiots like the people who hand out 100$ to Bethesda.
---
These people are contributing to a dark future for the entire industry, and for this they should be called out.
---
No one can tell you how to spend your money, but you can be damn sure people can call you a goddamn idiot for choosing to spend your dollar on something that hurts the entire community.
---
Its in the pinwheel of favorited items. Bottom left corner of wheel
---
&gt;Look up Providence Equity Partners and Bethesda/Zenimax.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Forgive the brevity, as I’m on mobile, but the tl;dr is that Providence has been heavily invested in Bethesda, and it’s believed their influence is driving the increased monetization efforts of the company, so that they can drive up share prices for an inevitable public offering.
---
Are there any videos that cover this? I've heard it mentioned before
---
I didn’t know Avellone wrote Outer Worlds! No wonder it’s been so smart and funny. Loving the anti-corporation, workers rights theme, pretty great considering what happened with New Vegas
---
My games not broken, and even if it was, that subscription is not selling a fix .  Please, tell me what bug fixes are included in the sub.  I'll wait.....
---
Dude I'll give you some if your on ps4. 
---
MY1SIN
---
So you admit there isn’t content that is attracting new players and retaining existing players. But your sure that if there was people would complain. I think people complain because of the lack of content.
---
Damn. I got a bunch of stuff I would’ve thrown your way in Xbox
---
I personally don't think by buying this you can sit in the "I don't care" camp. Simply because money isn't neutral, Bethesda is looking at stats, people buying this only encourages similar practices in the future.
---
Don't get me wrong, attacking a buyer is completely out of line. I don't think asking money for private servers is unreasonable, servers cost money to run. BUT I won't be getting behind a service that involves any pay2win advantages (IE: the scrap boxes), especially when it was previously said that increasing the stash sizes in anyway (which is what they've effectively done) was not possible for server stability. And when the private servers have serious flaws anyway, it just doesn't seem like Bethesda even thought about the decision much at all. They keep releasing things far to early, in a buggy state. Sometimes day one issues are likely, but they arise repeatedly, and we still have issues that have been around since launch...it's just not something I can personally accept.
---
Look, if you think the subscription is worthwhile, by all means buy it, nobody deserves to be attacked because of it. But, in the same vein, buyers can be criticized as buying it isn't really a neutral action regardless of what you think or say. The classic phrase: "actions speak louder than words" (and really money speaks louder still).
---
People who support shit like this are part of the problem. So yeah, you ARE Bathesda’s bitch.
---
Waited 8 months post release.  Snagged game for half price.  Made a few Atoms purchases to snag items that suited my style.  No regrets.  Leaning toward FO1st.  Happy C.A.M.P.-er.
---
I like running through Huntersville with my clothes off
---
You can remove anyone from your world that you want, sadly I think dedicated  servers are far too expensive they would lose money on that deal. Major customizations cant exist in private servers it's a rented public room which is all you can expect at the price. I'd be fine with them offering dedicated customizable worlds but people would lose their minds over the cost
---
I wish they would do something about these salt about salt threads...
---
Oh Lordly Lord that is hilarious now with BBC involved many people are gonna see it and Bethesda themselves are probably gonna have a PR nightmare dude goddam
---
i think the devs have a good point if i was reading what they said right that their game shoudnt be used to bring down falout 76 though they kinda poked some fun in their advertisements i think the game should stand on its own.
---
plus to be honest (well up till now with single player private worlds option) the two are kinda two completely different games
---
Lol
---
I wouldn't be surprised if some of the same people that mock mobile games for what they are fall for the same tactics on PC/console.
---
They don't see how important it is to speak out against this because we know what swamp mobile gaming has turned into. This is way past trying to make profit. 
---
&gt;I believe the Atom Shop has done a few things that would be outright illegal in physical stores
---
I assume you mean them tagging items with "sale" even though those items never had the advertised initial price for a single second. Yeah, that is illegal pretty much everywhere. You normally need the item to be on offer for the regular price for a certain period of time before being legally illegible for a price reduction. You can't just pretend that you cut 50% off. That is considered deception and fraud.
---
Based on the feedback, most players are absolutely fine paying for the private server even without other benefits.  There’s no value to Bethesda in keeping this exclusive and it would satisfy (in part) the community 
---
Also, as you’ve mentioned, getting in-game atoms became harder.
---
Funny how BBC actually tried to reach Bethesda for comment...this is getting serious lol
---
I won't disagree that the game was rushed &amp; not what many of expected it to be. I preordered the game and after all the poor reviews the betas got canceled the order. I tried the game for the 1st time when it was free to play in June because I had gotten so frustrated with the c.f. that The Division 2 had become &amp; I haven't played anything else since. I like the game, enjoy it (when it works) &amp; I seriously want it to succeed. Maybe at some point it will become the game we all want. We won't see another Fallout title for years, this is what we got. If Bethesda can't at least make it profitable then we won't even have that. The money for the sub was small change compared to many in the industry. Funding development is the only way anything will get done &amp; the game will continue. The general community I met in this game is what got me to play &amp; continue playing. I didn't care about NPC's, in fact I could care less about Wastelanders. This was 25 years after a devastating nuclear war. There are few survivors, no real communities. Just isolated pockets of vault dwellers &amp; isolated gangs. That's the mindset I play the game in. I think the implementation of the world as designed was perfect. You don't know who you will run into friend or foe. The private server just gives me a way to play in a non-combat environment when I'm on the hunt for plans &amp; goods. I play both public &amp; private with most of my time on the public servers...Ive established myself as a vendor in game &amp; that's where I spend the bulk of my time. The private server gives me a better opportunity to get rare outfits &amp; drops...thats pretty much why I bought the sub (think Fort Defiance &amp; some other locations). I've given plenty of gear, weapons, supplies to lots of players, including full sets of modded power armour. That's really where all my crafting material goes...sell some, give away some.
---
An idiot would be someone who attacks others who spend their money on sone th ing they enjoy.
---
You know what else is unfair? Buying a broken game at launch for 60$ that is still broken and then having them not give content that should be free for the people WHO ALREADY SPENT 60$ on the game.
---
It's the thought that counts!
---
I'm in! I'll so do it.
---
People are expressing their disappointment in the hope that they are heard and Bethesda alters course and adheres to the original social contract they made with enthusiasts by making comments such as (paraphrased), "no paid game content after you purchase" and "nothing in the store other than cosmetics". I agree with their stance. I'm willing to give Bethesda some slack when it comes to minor stability issues and buggy code if they work on improvements and stick to their original statements. I'm not going to cut them slack on gouging their player community. I like the players, I like many aspects of the game but bleeding the player base of their hard earned dollars has to stop.
---
Do you think people karma whoring go for hundreds though? Doesn't seem very ambitious
---
Now that the ranger outfit is in 76, it’s a sequel to New Vegas, New Vegas and Outer Worlds were made by the same company, therefore Outer World posts are back on girls and boys
---
Games not even fun enough like other fallouts to want to play alone. I've gotten used to it but I still think a game with all predictable robots may as well be Minecraft
---
or say 2,000 or so?
---
hell at 800 i only have 50 scrap though im just level 5 lol
---
i havent used my bag of infinite holding as a 1rst member yet. think i wait to see if they fix the glitch ;-) 
---
so far though i am loving private servers. as long as you have NO one in your friends list (which i dont since no text chat and i dont use a mic anyways)  it seems to work just fine.....and really does change the feel of the game to more like fallout 4 just in a diffrent settings (with some changes of course) but i actually quite like it. 
---
and as far as pay to win goes...
---
doesnt matter if your just a solo player in a solo world!
---
Has this shill never heard of a little game called ESO before? They could easily have given Fallout 76 to their Zenimax Online studio. But NOPE, they tried to cut corners right from the fucking start by giving it to their smallest, least experienced and worst dev studio they have out of all of them.
---
Lol what? I've had these views well before First was a thing. In fact, the fact that it's the same game is part of the problem. As far as I'm concerned, they're still working to make the game worth my initial $60. To ask for more money is laughable.
---
As for Bio-ware, I should have specified that I meant the developers. You should look into the working conditions at Bio-ware's Austin location.
---
If you hate it, stop playing, and get off this sub. I like it and that’s the only justification I need. This isn’t a debate. little Ben Shapiro, it’s just what people like or not.
---
I take a lot of your points, and as I said above, I'm not a staunch defender, the game has its faults and especially early on, is broken in many ways. I also think theres fun to be had, and I assure you its not because my experience of gaming is limited. (Platinumed Metro 2033 and Last Light for example seeing as you brought it up.) I was just saying most of the negative reaction which tends to be VERY negative and over the top, comes from YouTube etc, and the games community for the most part, I have found to be cool. 
---
No downvote from me, I'm with you on a lot of what you say 👍
---
I'm talking about like whole map 50 if your 50
---
Those are online games.  
---
Fallout 76 uses the same engine as an offline game. It doesn't need to be online-only, but it is. Just as Sim City 2013 became offline after EA said it wasn't possible, Fallout 76 should have taken the bullet and done the same.
---
Your comment is a great example of publishers and corporations brainwashing you into thinking they're your friend and they need to riddle their games with MTX, P2W, and obtuse design in order to scrape by. The AAA publishers (who you seem to be referring to, as I'll elaborate in the next paragraph) are not in danger of going out of business. Their tactics serve one goal: maximize profit, minimize cost. And that goal comes with the detriment of negatively affecting the integrity and quality of most products they peddle. They don't care about your experience, and they howl with laughter when laymen on the internet claim these scummy business practices are necessary in order to keep the lights on. They're not. This extra revenue isn't going into development innovation either; these publishers recycle the same games yearly, put in low effort cosmetics without content, ship broken products, lie about the products, and have insane marketing budgets. Dev teams also waste tens of millions of dollars with bad management using the "iteration" excuse. I'm quite familiar with development. Iteration is certainly a part of game development, but that doesn't mean bad management should be allowed to waste huge amounts of money.
---
Regarding $60: many games sell for $10 - $60. You cannot claim "games sell for $60 since the late 80s." You may be trying to say AAA games sell for $60 and roughly always have ($50 was a price point for a while, have you forgotten?). While it's true the cost of games have not risen 1:1 with general inflation since the early 2000's, the same can be said of film, books, and other mediums/hobbies. 
---
Another factor people like to forget is the market is huge compared to where it was X years ago. Market expansion = higher profits for actors in the market. The AAA gaming industry is making more money than ever now. They're not hurting for cash. You know who could use your cash though? Obsidian, Focus Home, AA devs and indie devs... this group also just happens to rarely infect its games with scummy monetization schemes. 
---
And you know what else has expanded? Marketing budgets. The name of the game is "sell, sell, sell," not "develop, develop, develop."
---
I am not necessarily anti-live service in general. I think For Honor, MHW, and some MMOs hit the model very well. But when games that never should have been live service are turned into it, the game's integrity almost always suffers. Instead of regular content, you get broken releases/patches and a steady influx of cosmetic/cash shop items (because that's what makes them money and it's a low cost effort) without substantial content. 
---
There's no good reason for you to defend these practices. I get buying them, it's a short-term satisfaction and you may not think it's too serious in the scheme of things. But to also defend them and pretend like it has to be this way otherwise the nice companies would lose all of their money, is a joke. Plenty of gaming companies have made great games without scum practices, and still make great money. Why? Because people buy quality.
---
My explaining is a waste of time though. Enough people either don't understand or don't care, and this is the gaming world we're in. It's only going to get worse. By then, perhaps people will realize their mistake in enabling these companies.
---
Wasn’t this just a visual bug?
---
Im not saying its very hard . But it cost you time while you could've been progressing elsewhere in the game. Time is more valuable than anything. To top it off you had to wait over 6 months to get it when you seen it was in the game months before launch and was suppose to come WITH the game.
---
 Listen I spent a good 5 6 months playing this game I'm a 130 something. I use to defend it constantly but they just keep breaking promise after promise. And when people say hey let's spend a $100 on a broken game ur essentially saying it's ok for them to do all this and it just irritates me that people dont mind being duped. It's just not right. Only way they will understand that enough is enough is through their wallets.
---
There's nothing unfair if we got what we paid for, and don't get what we didn't pay for.  I know...with all the release bugs, early adopters didn't get what they paid for. 😎
---
Appreciate your optimism, but you can ask anyone whose been here since launch. It'll never stop. There's a group of people on this sub who originally said 76 should never be made. They've NEVER left the sub and seem to live off spreading venom. It's baffling they don't just move on, it's like Bethesda murdered their families.
---
Based on the data we collected 1st members will be getting expanded building budget. Since we added that in eso + subscription. (Its probably likely to happen look at eso benifits.)
---
God, this is such a dumb fucking argument.  Stop saying the game is broken, its not!!  Is it buggy?  YUUUP, it sure is.  How old are you?  Are you old enough to have played original nes? Or snes/sega?  those had BROKEN Games.  You could spend 6 hours trying to beat a game, only to have a bug freeze the game.  You would have to restart the console, and there were no saves.  Predatory, would be selling a way to save your games so you dont lose progress.  I also consider loot boxes (especially in madden/fifa) as  those system do prey on people with gambling addictions
---
I mean bioware austin isn’t a fuck up. Its edmonton that dropped a flaming turd on their doorstop.
---
Hell yes it’s a great achievement! Loot boxes have been the most notorious scam these developers have run and COD is one of the biggest brands in the market. When the leaders change their ways, the followers eventually follow suit. It doesn’t matter if they’re changing it just to get good PR. The fact is, they changed it. 
---
It’s fine for these companies to keep trying to make a profit. No rational person wants to stop that, it’s about how they choose to make that profit. They’re doing Battle Passes, basically subscriptions with everything outlined. While not great, that’s clearly a more ethical model than letting kids pump their parents’ money into virtual slot machines.

There is definetly money in ads I dont know where you got that impression. I'm fine with killing scrapbot scrap weighing 0 would instantly crash all markets as they would be duped sadly unless you want to make scrap an automatically collected non tradable resource but I feel like that's not very fun. You can kick people from servers now and you can tell people rules if they dont like them kick them or if you dont want more people on tell them to leave you control all that already. Option 3 sure if you think that would make people happier could probably work. HTC they would hardly make money on the server option and lots of profit with little incentive for option two I also think it would just make more people angry, it seems to me most people's problem has been any amount of money not just the amount they have now, as it stands a year membership is less than 1 day of work.

Wat
---
97.5% of the community is first class. Welcome to WV.
---
Nobody should be buying atoms though? The game has given nobody a reason to support it, so why would you burn money?
---
Dude's a little arrogant to think that he can act as a mediator between Todd Howard and the community at large but kudos to him for making it to the general news media all the same. The site was a some good work done by him.
---
Never for a second think that a vocal minority such that we are, are something to dismiss out of hand.
---
Yet Bethesda is here giving us free updates and free dlc and now you have a option to pay 13 dollars a month for a optional subscription
---
It’s unfixable.
---
I thought that for a long time but I'm just burned out
---
While I agree, unfortunately there's no other outlet for the perceived slights and some people aren't willing to just uninstall and be done with Bethesda til they change their business mindset.  So subconsciously players lash out at each other.
---
Exactly, so why would you pay the game rent each month haha
---
People just wanted to take the story of Appalachia, with their friend, mod out the problems, add in logical lore and interesting dynamics. Though if you asked the same thing of ESO they'd say "That's crazy talk" but it really isn't.
---
Eso for one that happened and is now insanely popular. And 2 shit id buy a lifetime pass for fallout.
---
Saaaame AF
---
Carmacks obsession with engine code is what makes the IdTech engine the best in he industry. It allows Doom to run well on all sorts of hardware including old potatoes.
---
They might not be my favorite company anymore, but it sure still hurts to see them slowly kill themselves over the years and taint their reputation, guess that's why I care so much about this
---
Great job Bugfesda
---
Now griefers have unlimited storage.
---
Fair point - but not mentioning those things doesn't take away from them.
---
I do agree that loot boxes need to be gone, please dont get me wrong.  My point is more that they will just shift to other means of monetization.  I was responding more in context to the theme of the comment section, than your exact point.  This post wasnt about lootboxes, it was about microtransactions in general.  I'm in the corner of defending them because I know they are the reason we dont pay $200 for a game
---
I mean the guidelines are to downvote only what doesn't contribute to discussion, and talking about haters and downvotes isn't particularly relevant soooo...
---
You support a company that actively lies and breaks its promises? You are an absolute fool. Enjoy losing all of your items in a scrapbox after paying Bethesda 100$ for it. I rescind my condolences for you, since you support this garbage, this is what you deserve.
---
Unfortunately, most of us have a lot of "friends" who can join any time and may not be as friendly as we remember...that one time we played and friended them. 😉
---
I hope they'll refine the private server setting to allow solo or invite-only.  If so, here's my subscription $...
---
Yep. Quick posting on a phone. Autocorrect gives and autocorrect takes.
---
Multiple times content has been delayed,not only wastelander, you do your search please. 
---
Private server should have been free. All the stuff that is not cosmetic should have been free ( refregirator, unlimited free space for scrapbox, repair kit, etc) since they said cosmetic only, don't try to defend their lies. 
---
Yes it's a business, it's normal to make a gain of a product, but they overpriced their product without even giving a decent product (plus lies). It's very clear that they are greedy. It shouldnt cost that much money for a game, complaining about the game is reasonnable.  
---
A games should be made with creativity and serve the player( like new vegas was) this game and the way they treat their fans is a disgrace for the fallout community. 
---
Please do search of the sub if you want the truth.
---
I speak french so don't try to win an argument by my shitty vocabulary
---
I'm the messenger saying what I think they're saying 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Thanks god for that!
---
Never claimed people were smart or thought things through.
---
Regardless, you can’t deny that the hate on Bethesda here (deserved or not) is the “in thing” to be doing.  There’s a new pet ever 30 seconds with yet another person who thinks that their claim of leaving the game or uninstalling is going to be the one that ends Bethesda.
---
Reality is, no one gives a shit if you (they) are quitting the game.
---
No one.  Not me, not you, not their mother, not their father, not Bethesda.  Nada.  Zilch.
---
Thanks. :)
---
I seriously doubt Fallout 76 has ever been profitable.
---
I'm not sure but I think fallout first members might just be able to place scrapboxes down in anyone's camp they have access. If so that means anyone and everyone including all the griefers who just want to steal everything from other players have that unlimited storage.
---
wE r GaMeRs
---
You're boring.
---
Sadly if I end up getting it I would never wear the outfit and prob have to keep my scrap box behind a locked door
---
Going to tag u/Aten_Ra as I think he was tracking something similar but slightly different.
---
I will say I would have preferred fallout 4 co op
---
I dont agree that they have crossed an ethical line.  They are not selling bug fixes, and they are not selling lootboxes.  You know what you are getting.  I would be right with everyone if they started letting you spend real money at the purveyor.  If they let you spend money on a dice roll, hoping to get a good legendary, I would say that is predatory, and that is my "ethical line".  But I think I agree with you more than I disagree
---
Like eso gets double building budget we should get double camp building budget.
---
Finally, im done hearing about this game .
---
Doh!
---
Funny story I never got my lvl 100 achievement, think I’m like 130 at this point and I never got it.
---
i agree
---
like it or not people still play the game. do not bash others who still play.  This is an issue with the company not us.
---
if you hate the game now and want to uninstall good for you.  Many of you have been there from day one and so by now near a year later you likely have already seen and done all there is to see ...but for myself i am just starting.  i only played the beta a bit but didnt get super far (only level 5 and yay hes still there!) just bought the game now on sale and the subscription
---
i could give a shit about the extra perks but for me the main deal was for private servers. and IF you have no friends on your friends list Private servers DO work. and brings a whole diffrent feel to the game. it really now feels like a single player game. sure it has some issues sure there are still a LOT of things that can be improved 
---
but some people still like the game.  I love the setting . and some aspects are even better then fallout 4. (i think some parts of the graphics are improved lighting...landscape ..in SOME areas) 
---
the map is 10 times better then fallout 4. i dont mean the actual world location i mean not having to squint your eyes looking at the monocrome pipboy map like in vegas/3 and 4 its an actual fucking map maybe small but a HUGE deal to me. pipboy is easier to read too.
---
Dont hate players who still like the game. This is not a war between each other.  This is all on the devs.  and yes you might say well if you stop giving them money they wont keep doing this shit
---
but you know i still am holding out that some things may be fixed. It might likely NEVER be perfect.......Fallout 76 may NEVER be the game it could have been BUT.......one of the big draw to me of their games are the immersive worlds you can explore at your own pace and that is still the case here........of course since it lacks mods and other deeper content like past games......once you seen it all you might get bored quickly but.......
---
I am now ironically a fallout 76 fan.   It has Major MAJOR issues but perhaps like the Washington Metro.  I can appreciate it despite the major flaws.
---
and i hope that our outspoken voice will wake them up just a bit to TRY to fix some of these issues.
---
but dont kill private worlds. I love em and i hope they only will improve...as i could care less bout the multiplayer aspect of fallout 76 lol
---
Fight the good fight! but dont hate on each other.  deep down i think we are all fallout fans. and thats what matters.
---
I'm still keeping mine on just to pop in and fool around; its not going anywhere, and its not like I have to pay to keep it up. Currently I've been on Destiny 2 a lot more.
---
It's made worse by whales who skew all metrics measured in the MTX shops. Almost all mobile games are banking on these huge spenders, which is the reason why we get these articles where a person spent $150,000 on the shops. Because it makes it so much more difficult to make meaningful change to the current landscape of every single cash shop market, when a few whales make most of the decisions for the companies.
---
Enough people liked this game to make a sub? Jesus standards have fallen
---
And definitely the "fun" in functional.
---
If your spending your "last penny" on video games, you have a problem and should seriously look into counseling.  Games aren't a necessity, self control is expected
---
I thought so, I have been offering a 15k reward for a picture of either armor with unyielding for a week or so and haven't gotten any responses.

Thanks for the confirmation, heard similar but not gotten to test it yet, added to the roundup (and linked to this post)

The gameplay is prickly by design and instead of making it fun they make it costly. I like Appalachia but smh at the company.
---
The subscription service has some problems (it shouldn't give player offline mode and advantages they should already be there in game) but they could make it purely cosmetic fir people like me who spend that amount of atoms a month anyway and exclusive cosmetics but dont go hating on a player because they like a Damn video game
---
&gt;Kinda sucks having to set up my free camp

Bethesda adding P2W/massively convenient features to a game not even in it's second content season, and also in the state it's currently in, makes me want to laugh, but only tears come out  :' )
---
Hey man no need to hate 
---
Know what they say mo money mo problems
---
Agree. I’m not going to listen to a post written by Bethesda’s bitch.
---
Sorry, Xbox
---
People who buy this shit are part of the problem. They are the reason why the big publishers have predatory practices like this.
---
&gt; Bethesda-owned graphics in a way that portrays their IP or company in a negative light 
---
That's parody
---
You support a company that lies and break promises to its customers? You are Bethesda's Bitch whether you like it or not!
---
Bro - just buy fallout first and you will get maintenance announcements before regular plebs.
---
My suggestion is to make junk box available to everyone free and make the private  servers persistent so you keep your workshops and everything
---
Spoiler Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
If you kept a character you started in the beta it ‘forgot’ level achievements. I had to start a second character to get my stuff up to 20
---
People are blaming players because blaming Bethesda does nothing. We tell them we don't like it? We get given the silent middle finger as they unveil the next 100$ a year convince pack. The only way to get a company to stop pursuing shitty buisness practices is to stop buying them.
---
I'm not saying it's fair for any single person to be harassed though, there's proper ways to go about it, but in essence people who spend money on businesses going down anti-consumer routes are enabling them to continue becoming shitter and shittier businesses. 
---
I don't want to say it but you are part of the problem. You can turn the other cheek or face it.
---
They add fun into functional
---
u/uwubot
---
But you kind of are actually.  You're saying Bethesda made this game, and now is doing things that you find questionable or immoral, and anyone who buys this sub or supports this is now thrown in the same boat.  
---
This isn't IBM and Nazi Germany.  It's a fucking video game.
---
We’re all boring... *or are we?*
---
Its not perfect, but I enjoy fo76. Since the power armor bug was fixed I haven't run into any major bugs that affect my enjoyment of the game. I run at a steady 120 fps and rarely crash (no more than I do in any other game I play). The simple fact is that the subscription has improved my playing experience and I don't feel like its wasted money at all.
---
Since you said you have no first hand experience of the game I'm guessing you are just repeating the various points you have heard from random posters on reddit, youtubers, or "news" articles. All this does is pointlessly contribute to the massive circlejerk going on.

You're not special. Nobody gives a fuck about how many Bethesda games you've played.

Still cant respond to my rebuttal?  I offered a serious, intelligent debate about your views on the industry, and you ignored it...  some journalist, eh?  Just shows that your really interested in clicks,  and not actual substance. (Assuming your an actual game journalist who got a review copy, which I hiiiiiiiighly doubt)

MTXs is a viable model in F2P games. League of legends and Dota2 (and plenty of other titles) are two examples that prove that a company can grow without milking their playerbase. 
---
A game that makes millions of purchases means that the company gets at least 60 million (In Bethesda's case at least 120 million). The staff wages for a game that's under development for 3 years is around 20 million. The server costs for the first two years are around 5 millions (that's under discussion but let's assume that it is) and then there's marketting (Let's go way above and say that Bethesda spent 30 millions in marketting). Rounding up again that's 60 million in a game that made 120 millions considering it sold &gt; 2 million copies. 
---
 And i'm exaggerating a bit just to show you how much profit a company can make. Now if you add up the MTXs and the subscription service, you begin to wonder where all these money go. And the answer is unfortunately, that they're not being distributed to the devs or the game.
---
I get it, but it's coming to grips where we are in gaming.
---
Policy changes would be required, I think.
---
No one needs unlimited scrap space, they need better inventory management skills.
---
Acknowledged Freeport 7. See you in about two weeks.
---
How do those examples you gave actively make peoples' lives worse though? I can see how they are annoying to see in a game, and depending on how the game is structured it could affect your enjoyment of it, but it's not hurting you meaningfully. Yes, people have probably put themselves into debt over things like loot boxes, but with events like that there are generally other issues at play (mental health, addiction, etc) and it is a vast minority of people it happens to, so while in those sorts of cases someone's life is made worse, it's not something I'd necessarily hold against the company offering them. So I suppose I should qualify my earlier post by that in most cases, things like Fallout 1st do not make peoples' lives worse in a meaningful way.  
---
This 'pasttime' is full of games untouched by subscriptions and microtransactions (Outer Worlds says hi), it is not hard to go play other games that don't have them, or even fall back on a different pasttime if it's that bothersome. Despite some of the less scrupulous practices of certain companies, gaming has never better or more accessible, so if the presence of lootboxes and subscriptions sours that for you, that's on you more than anything else imo.
---
You're more boring.
---
&gt;I bought the game on the promise that it would be "pay for cosmetic only". If you like to be lied, that is your problem
---
Huh, but from your posts and comments it looks, not saying it is, like you just got it a month ago? Surely you knew then that Bethesda had clarified their stance on utility items in the atom store?
---
I like how yesterday they had outrage, threats &amp; demands..even shaming players. Today they are trying to barter &amp; reason. Before next week theyll all be subbed to the subscription as expected
---
I know the owner of the site. He's always been a cool meme. I did not hear about this until his brother sent us a message showing his Bros face on a BBC article. It's fucking insane.
---
I don't think I got a picture of it, but I do remember seeing a woodpile next to one of the buildings in the community!  I'll check through my pics before I post them.

Thanks for the reply. Yeah I am pretty much done with this dumpster fire myself.
---
Thank you!
---
That what i meant with with the "giving them an advantage" thing
---
Thanks!  I just want people to see the inspirations for a lot of the areas in the game.  I think it's extremely cool, especially growing up in WV.
---
Longtime fans are leaving the game because of their shitty business practices. Felt like something the publisher needs to understand 🤷
---
That would be awesome, and I'm sure they would appreciate it!
---
And fuck the Patriots
---
I had the game since november, why do you defends to death people who doesnt care about their customers. Do you work for Bethesda?
---
He currently has a gofund me and zenimax max lawyers are most likely looking into sueing him into the ground
---
Glad you like it!  There are going to be a lot more to come!
---
All the hard work for a armor i can't even get. Thanks Beth
---
Their original vision didn't work because they executed it greedily.
---
Sadly your doubts are wrong, this game was definitely profitable, you underestimate pre order sales, online game sales and microtransactions.
---
The Halloween event will seal it and the trolls will move back to Activision with Blizcon. It's just gonna take some time.
---
Other companies may also offer to sell us stuff while keeping their core products exactly the same,!?!???!! What?!? No!!!!!
---
People bitched, pissed, and moaned about paying for post launch content. Developers need to do something to recoup the lost revenue. Premium passes are common in online gaming today and Fallout 1st isn't bad in terms of having and not having it.
---
Thanks! Wait until you see some of the buildings.  It's crazy how detailed the designs in the game are compare to IRL.  Although, you could be doing the speed limit and pass by Helvetia in about 5 seconds. LOL  Very small community, but very cool.
---
I have some pics of him coming soon ;)
---
Lmao. Well now, that may be your opinion but quite clearly not the opinion of a very large portion of people that actually play the game.
---
Have they responded to any of this since they dropped the subscription news? I guess they're using the weekend to let backlash fire die off a bit before saying anything.
---
It isn't unfair.
---
Imagine being so naive that you think fallout 76 is a financial success...
---
Rare wards/costumes sound good to me..
---
I've logged off an on periodically for the last 4 hours. Haven't had an issue. It's all still there. Even when into to repair a weapon or armor.
---
That would've been awesome!
---
If I did not have thick skin, I would simply insult you and pretend I know better. It is because I do not wall myself off from others, nor have the thin skin of pride, that I can communicate while being insulted.
---
I have been paying close attention since day 1 of BETA. I do not recognize the conclusion that they are liars and cheats as true nor fair. I recognize mistakes. I recognize failures. And I recognize deceptive marketing tactics. Yet, those instances do not amount to calling them liars and cheats, unless we are holding to a liberal definition; in which case, that can apply to quite a few people and loses significance. Further, doing so is counter-productive and results in nothing but people yelling past one-another.
---
I also recognize that I cannot convince anyone nor am I trying to. 
---
I have made several suggestions for steps forward with this game I enjoy and see a potentially fun future for. Take it or leave it. This whole argument is inconsequential to the very point of this post.
---
Except if someone kills you, boom, hundreds of your scrap is gone.
---
It's commonplace for any game to have a subreddit set up so others can find people that play, regardless of quality
---
All DLC (quests, raids, nuclear winter, wastelanders) is free in FO76, you get a lot of in-game currency (atoms), unlimited junk (craft bag in eso). I can see them adding more perks to FO 1st like exp/caps bonus, increase in scrip (like transmutation crystals), more stash space, more budget for building.   
---
Also, Fallout 76 is just like eso. With enough work and dedication to improving the game it will be worth it.
---
They could have released the game F2P and sole the Ranger outfit for 5£  off the bat and I bet they'd have made more money and had a lot more goodwill then they have now.  But it seems they want to take my namesake.
---
yeah there's no not caring, you either support horrible business practices or you don't. Money talks.
---
Honestly if you supported them after beta its your own fault. Like i bought most of their games but this was such a slap in the face. Right before that we got a bad fallout 4. They made bad VR ports of skyrim/f4... they never fixed skyrim and released it on sooo many consoles.
---
SOOO many red flags. 
---
Alone that people are like "i hope tes 6 will be good" no it wont it will be horseshit. I love elder scrolls but they fucked it already with skyrim. Oblivion had at least a good charm to it.
---
All ive heard is not good reviews lol
---
Some of you need to get out and get some air, my God.
---
Ok OP, deal.
---
Do you feel that people who support and enable very anti-consumer practices by purchasing the subscription are free from criticism? If so, why?
---
Bear in mind this isn't a game that started off with a subscription model. There are two other monetisation models that were already in play - upfront payment and microtransactions.
---
Nor is it just subscription for access to private worlds only. There would be less criticism if it was just that. Bethesda have explicitly placed stashboxes, second mobile camp and ranger armour, highly requested features, behind the paywall. 
---
People who are paying for the subscription are enabling Bethesda to continue doing such anti-consumer practices.
---
Thanks, updated and submitted
---
Bethesda wouldn't be profiting if it wasn't for the players supporting their bad practices. They do it because they know they can get away with it.
---
YES AWESOME!! GRIEF EVERYTHING!!! KILL EVERYONE!!! 1 SHOT LEGENDARIES!!!!! BREAK BASES!!!!!
---
Ah, you are right. It's not like they are a billionaire company or anything.
---
Friendly reminder the first month of xbox game pass is 1$. Outer worlds is on there.
---
Yet you took the time to reply.
---
Lol don’t know why ur getting downvoted for explaining how loot works
---
See I can understand the branding reasoning of it being a Fallout skin much more! I highly doubt it's the lore of it that's bringing you in unless you're just like "hell ya, time to read the 100th terminal!" Lol! But like if you totally love the terminals that's fine too.
---
There are plenty of people who bash the game and never played it, though it's highly unlikely that they're on a Fallout Reddit and much more likely that you'll find those types on YouTube. What I like the most about Fallout is the dreariness (I hate TES and its fantasy environment, what 76 feels like to me), hate terminals (you know how many there are in 76), hate boring dialogue (so those holotapes are a drag), have limited brand loyalty (so a Fallout skin isn't enough to drag me in), love interesting characters (the only character in 76 I can remember is Rose), and LOVE game choice (emphasis on this one, no choices in 76). These have all been elements of prior Fallout games, with the exception of Tactics, Shelter, and 76, so you must be on the opposite spectrum of me on a lot of these details, right? Because obviously what I find is the "true Fallout" is much different than what you must think Fallout is.
---
you got a free game that you got hours of entertainment from, and you're still unhappy. there's no reasoning with a hate-boner like that.

Yes, people posting on the internet, not just in this sub, typically dont understand this. People find like minded people and bounce the same thoughts off of each other. These people think everyone thinks the same because they only interact with people spouting the same thoughts. It's not the case, or even close to the case in real life though. 
---
One need but login to the game, visit player camps and realize the people playing, the only people that matter, have embraced this change. I've said it multiple times, this sub is the vocal minority. Bethesda would be wise to ignore most of whats said here and mine only for good ideas where applicable. 
---
As far as no weight on scrap..no. Because weight matters away from your camp. They've made concessions with common ammo not carrying a weight, which is a fair compromise. Its a survival game, actions have consequences. If you aren't a fan of that, find a game that meets the criteria you want.
---
sickening.
---
1) Any luck?   
---
2) Confirmed and submitted, thanks for the info.  
---
3) Results?   
---
4) Gotcha, thanks!
---
He did WHAT?
---
I'm not sure about that, whenever I log in its just a bunch of scattered masses throughout, with the predictable low levels near Vault 76 and Flatwoods. I always assumed they're just new characters made by longtime players. To be frank, if you needed a private world and camp tent to function you'd probably look like a newbie if a regular player happened upon you.
---
You do great work over here! Thanks do much!
---
Poor effort, which is appropriate, considering the subject matter.
---
This feels kinda cool. That moment were the scrap box ia a better refrigerator, than the actual item XD.
---
Ah! Their she blows
---
This is news to me! I'll double check on it
---
That's probably because the bugs and price tag, they should probably make fallout 76 free and then give early adopters the membership for free for a year and lower the price to the price of a PlayStation plus membership, and possibly team up with Xbox live and PlayStation plus to release a membership bundle where you get the membership for cheaper along with the membership that is already required to play the game
---
The game was rigged from the start.
---
Can you shed anymore insights on the stealth whitsprings nerf? I can surmise a guess but I’d like to hear about it from someone in the know like yourself.
---
That's on the roadmap
---
People who can't grasp the difference between objective criticism and toxicity probably shouldn't be on the internet.
---
&gt; a tight concentration of CAMPS
---
Really?
---
/s
---
Microsoft purchased them over a year ago
---
I think you're completely valid in voicing this. If they don't see how this affects their players (and their bottom line), they won't do anything about it. (Not that I think they will anyway, but still.)
---
Tries to fast travel - dumps me back to where I was.  Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.  Fuck this, switches to a different game - my morning and many other mornings over the past 6 mo.
---
Before or after todays hotfix?
---
Sounds good. Skyrim comes pre-installed.
---
Passive mode negates it, someone tried doing this to me, I thought they were stupid, they tried it like, 4-5 times and then left
---
Maybe rename your ini file, the game will generate a new one &amp; you can work back from there. At the very least it'll let you know if it's the ini file or not
---
BGS has indicated its peeps that have a lot of materials in the scrap box.  Do you know how many items it was?
---
I'm not so sure it's calculated - Youngblood was an unmitigated disaster - are you saying they engineered it as such?
---
Yeah, I still play it though today I really didn't feel like it  but the reason I still play is due to r/PKOA fun bunch of players that kept me in the game at the right time 
---
As well as the community, players helping each other to the point I'd gladly build a full set of PA and whatever else for someone who's new and at a level where I can give them it - for free 
---
Bethesda please for the love of Atom do not ruin this game due to greed, this game had so much potential to become the most wholesome game out there
---
Aren’t there stash boxes in the White Spring? There’s one in the artisan’s corner, a few in the bunker, and one in the train station
---
You do know what anti consumerism is right? 
---
 Is Bethesda polluting the environment?  Are they funding terrorist organizations?  Are they using their gains to spread a message of hate against anyone?  Are they doing this to spread an authoritarian regime in the United States?
---
This kind of move is far from saying that Bethesda is being anti-consumerism.
---
Also, if you’re wearing the Raider chest piece, you won’t be able to see your backpack because the armor covers it
---
People pissed I have fallout 1st probably please don’t downvote me reddit what will I do without my imaginary internet points :( wahhhh
---
It's starting to feel that way. lol
---
Also buying a desolate, content lacking game, that's buying point is the promise of frequent updates to add new content. And then that the content is sparse, infrequent, diluted (content being delayed and then added to another DLC but not adding extra to that DLC), delayed again and again (displays, the other vaults, legendary system, wastelanders), or worst of all, removed and instead has a price tag thrown on it (faction outfits/objects, fridges, robots, survival tents, increased stash)
---
&gt;Multiple times content has been delayed,not only wastelander, you do your search please. 
---
Except you specifically said DLC, not content. 
---
&gt;A games should be made with creativity and serve the player( like new vegas was) this game and the way they treat their fans is a disgrace for the fallout community
---
FONV was a horrible unplayable mess when it came out. Obsidian had to call in Bethesda to rescue them. 
---
I won't bother to even comment on the rest, it's been rehashed too many times to bother. The simple answer is if you don't like it,  don't play it. There is no reason for you to rage hate on something, life is too short. Find something you do like and try that for a while
---
That's dipshit logic
---
Of course I blame players, they're why Bethesda can do these things. Do I go out of my way to belittle and insult someone because they made a purchase I personally think is foolish? Of course not.
---
Wasn’t there a collectron bot and fridge boycott as well? I see those eveywhere now.
---
Good idea. I think to rent a server should be 5$ and have a season pass like other games and have a free pass and a premium pass, but then again, on battlefield games, to rent a server is 25$. So idk
---
Only youtuber i still watch on the subject is juicehead. All the other just post stuff if there something controversial going on.
---
are made of fertilizer? or did they change that in the last update?
---
No, but they had promised before launch that there would be no subscriptions or pay to win services *at all.*
---
I've been playing nuclear winter a fair amount today and I've seen a lot of people at rank either 0 or 1
---
Please Youtubers are the laziest scummiest people on the planet.  They don't even play the game or even use their own recent footage of in game content.  Its far easier to scream loud attention grabbing clickbait nonsense and run old recycled footage stolen from others of bugs longs since fixed since launch.  AngryJoe I'm glaring at you bastard.
---
For me it didn't seem to negate it. I saw them slap damaging me and I thought ehh they can't do proper damage to me. 2 seconds later my dead body is flying through the air in 1 hit after my electrically charged went off and the fucked was hauling off all the scrap i had grinded over 2 straight days of play and server hopping to avoid me being able to "seek revenge"
---
Where did you find it? Wanna see pics for myself
---
Yeah, *and?*
---
Have you never played a game before? like ever? Because every thing in this new insanely expensive should be in the base game and should be 100% playable after a full year.
---
No, all the junk got completely deleted. I’m not sure why Bethesda said it was likely a visual bug.
---
&gt;You could spend 6 hours trying to beat a game, only to have a bug freeze the game. You would have to restart the console, and there were no saves.
---
Not only does this reek of "back in my day," but you apparently have been lucky enough to not have to hard reset your Xbox multiple times because of this game, only to lose a bunch of progress because the server hadn't autosaved in a while and you weren't able to create an exit save either because the game crashed. 
---
Just because games used to be worse doesn't mean this game isn't busted. And, yes, I've played the original consoles. If I had a dollar for every bug, crash, and hard reset I had to deal with just today from this game, I'd be able to pay for multiple months of Fallout 1st.
---
Predatory is loot boxes. Predatory is legitimate armor (not underarmor that adds no protection) and weapons behind a pay wall. Predatory is putting features behind a pay wall that should be standard in a game (forward tent and unlimited scrap) and were even standard in older games (unlimited scrap). Predatory is taking an item people have been begging for for awhile and putting it behind a pay wall for a service not everyone wants (ranger armor). That is literally the only reason they put the armor with the subscription. They knew how many people wanted that armor, so they decided anyone who wants it should be forced to pay at least a month's worth of Fallout 1st to get it, whether they want Fallout 1st or not. 
---
The armor should have been in the Atom Shop, the scrap box in the base game, and the tent behind a quest with skins in the Atom Shop. Instead they pulled this shit. All while the Mr. Messenger event I was in today failed because of the endless spawning of level 62 charred feral ghouls that were able to hit me from fifty feet away and take a third of my health out even though I'm almost level 100 and was shooting at them with a damn good gun.
---
Same here, I have my bot since the beginning and only yesterday I saw Ultracite and ballistic fiber there...
---
I wouldn't mind renting a server, but I think them making a PlayStation plus and Xbox live bundle that includes the server rental, would be a good idea, especially since some of their profits in console already go to Sony and Microsoft
---
Really? Because I thought the guy was close enough to trigger it, I thought passive doesnt allow you to hurt other players?
---
How much of those games were discounted though, it happened pretty fast.
---
I'm not a fan of fallout series, and have never played fallout 76. I'm just spectating on ongoing subscription things and hadn't blamed anyone yet.
---
But I love Oblivion and Skyrim and was really looking forward to play TES 6 when it comes out. With all those scams Bethesda is doing and people supporting it, I think I can see what piece of shit TES 6 is going to become.
---
Why shouldn't I blame them?
---
Yes there are this guy covered it extensively, get ready for BethesdEA.  https://youtu.be/qJt_i2_vsSw I went from anticipating tes 6 n fanboying bethesda since oblivion to putting them in same ranks as Activision blizzard ea etc.. cant wait to see the backlash when new elder scrolls comes out n its monetized to fuck
---
You laid it out perfectly.
---
yeah all people here shitting on this but i see the scrapbox and the ranger armor everywhere lol
---
i did it too but i don't aprove that the tent and the scrapbox being only for those who pay, for me the atoms are a deal but maybe not for everyone idk
---
Really? This happened to me last night but all my junk was still useable in camp, I just couldn’t extract it. Maybe I’ll go back to stash for now then..
---
That's what I thought to but somehow it triggered and the guy 1 tapped me. I saw it flash up around me and I died nearly immediately afterwards give or take a few milliseconds.
---
...stalking in a nuclear wasteland.
---
You telling that to all the people mocking those who can't afford Fallout 1st with shit like "sounds like you're poor" or "begone peasant"?
---
I like AJs videos typically but his fo76 videos are total hateful garbage.  He obviously has no knowledge of the game yet feels qualified to use clickbait and rant about it.  Showing the bugs from release in his recent fallout 1st videos was especially misleading and annoying.
---
I'm not gonna argue with you on that but not all YouTubers are like that, and with AngryJoe that's his thing, is to be angry
---
##JOE MAMA 🤣🤣🤣
---
I’m sorry I upset you. Unless you are not upset and just like insulting people. Truth is I like the game, I just want it to grow and be successful. I think it needs to get new players and retain old players to be successful. Status quo is clearly not working.
---
Does anyone actually empty scrap container for collectron? I just leave mine open for anyone who visits my camp... I didn’t buy him for his scrap.
---
Ya but that adds to my stash weight
---
Still waiting for Bethesdas response.
---
Documented and submitted, thanks again!
---
Even if I buy from the playstation store? How do I cancel???
---
Damn, feels bad, I guess Im lucky it didnt happen to me, but if it did anyways, I didnt have any scrap on me
---
&gt;I had the game since november, why do you defends to death people who doesnt care about their customers. Do you work for Bethesda?
---
Lmao. Since November but never posted or commented on it until a short bit ago. Huh. Isn't that odd to you? 
---
No, I don't work for Bethesda,  I just don't really care for trolls that cause fake shitstorms for no good reason.  Go find a game you like and try that for a while, you'll feel better for it. 
---
Good life to you sir, I hope you can find something you enjoy
---
&gt;Its vocal anger should make you very, very afraid for the future of fo76
---
And what should the sub do? Throwing insults and angry phrases of sorrow and disappointment at Bethesda? Oh no.. how can they live with this. Now all the money they already extorted from the angry gAmErZ will be worthless..
---
As disgusting as this is, Zenimax/Bethesda doesn't care. They will only ever care if somebody takes legal actions. And they will just sweep those away with their infinite amount of money.
---
I'm pretty sure there's a unvocal majority that's going to continue playing but not subscribe; I'm not sure where the idea that everyone will subscribe comes from. Looking at it it really confers no benefits beyond getting an outfit and additional emotes, not to mention the current bugs troubling it.
---
I already have enough subscriptions lol, or i would give it a try
---
Lol you’re kidding right? Lmao. Collectron is useless.
---
People try this with me all the time.  I just stand there, have never been killed.  
---
I run bloodied, usually around 15%.  I'm easy to kill, a random scorched is deadly.
---
I don't have anger... I've seen the latest news and come to laugh
---
In that case, you would need to come across lvl 3 and lvl 128 enemies.
---
We’re totally on the same page there. Especially for online live games. There are a lot of people who just don’t understand how the finances of all of this works, so they scream whenever anybody wants anything from them. It doesn’t help that a huge chunk of gaming consumers are buying products and services with allowance money. 
---
To them, $100/yr for a service is unobtainable, recurring credit card payments are not an option for them—so they get mad that they can’t have it. To most functional adults, it’s enough to think about for a minute, but that’s really all. There’s plenty to criticize with Fallout 1st, but the price ain’t it. 
---
I’m fine with microtransactions and I’m totally fine with subscriptions. My ethical line is just a bit further back than yours. If you add things in the game that make it less fun just to incentivize sales of “convenience” items, that’s beyond my line.
---
It's hard to give a fair and reasoned review when you named yourself "Angry".
---
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
He would love that attention but it's not going to happen.
---
It'll start the same way it always does - cease and desist letter. If he's pigheaded enough to continue, good luck.
---
Dude's made his point so if he bows out a day or two later, that's cool.
---
&gt;I also think there's fun to be had, and I assure you its not because my experience of gaming is limited.
---
I hope you don't misconstrue this as me hating you on but I'm genuinely curious if you could expand on this.  Maybe the basis of my argument is wrong, but I don't at all get how this could be the case, again maybe I'm wrong or misunderstanding.  Maybe our definitions of 'limited' are different.
---
I agree that there's fun to be had and I did indeed have some amount of fun with FO76.  There's also a lot of frustration to be had and it was depressing to watch the game slowly break more and more the further I got in and the more experienced I became with the game.  For example, I'd argue a bug is less detrimental to players that aren't aware of it.  If you're more familiar with the game-state, you're seeing more of the bugs.  Another way of saying this is I would have given the game a fairly glowing review 20 hours in, but by 50 hours I genuinely wished the entire experience could be wiped from my memory.  
---
I suspect some of this is because a number of the bugs are recurring in nature, so they won't happen at all, until they happen once and then they'll repeat frequently.  I didn't have the audio firing bug 20 hours in, but by the time I quit I couldn't go 20 minutes without getting it (which requires a restart to fix, and it takes ~2-3 minutes to reconnect, puts you in a different world, fails to reconnect at times, requires my buddies to wait on me, etc).  A player with poor accuracy might just think they missed, but a player with excellent accuracy will notice that the game server frequently fails to record hits.  These are limited examples, however there's a youtuber I like called Joseph Anderson, who does critical in-depth reviews while generally being less sensationalist than most youtubers, who has a three hour bug reel on FO76 that contains bugs he personally experienced.  That's not a compilation of bugs from various youtubers, that's **solely** his footage.  My experience is more or less the same as his as well.  This doesn't even get into design or balance problems, like how the jump height mutation is developer-approved perching.  Fun but inherently broken design has a solid place in single-player games, but is much harder to justify in an MP game.

Another possible factor here is that the game is more stable with fewer players, so perhaps at this point with relatively few players playing and radically reduced server strain, it operates better on a technical standard and there was a lot of theories about this early on because occasionally you'd get an empty server in off-hours and the game magically worked.  Basically the game can't handle more than a handful of players on a server at a given time before it breaks (which oddly enough, is also the number of players you can have on your 'private' server if you get fallout 1st).  So from my perspective, that's basically them saying if I want to play the game as its intended from a technical standpoint and bug-free, I have to pay monthly for that.  That's digital racketeering.  So is things like nerfing durability reduction perks and then implementing repair kits, or increasing the rate that food spoils then adding a fridge to the cash shop.
---
So I get why you dislike sensationalist youtubers, but at the same time I agree with them that this is an outrage and that fallout 1st is downright absurd.  While I agree they (youtubers) criticisms are sensationalist in nature, I wouldn't agree that it's unwarranted or inaccurate.
---
You could buy roughly 11 copies of Fallout 76 for the same amount that it would cost to buy 12 monthly subscriptions of "Fallout 1." This is beyond ridiculous, and anyone with half a brain wouldn't even consider buying this trash. I'm officially through with Bethesda. No sort of apologies can fix how they treated their own loyal fans. Never buying a single game made by that trash corporation (they don't deserve the title of "video game developer" anymore) ever again.
---
I had no stash space left whatsoever since it's all taken up by scrap so I have to carry it around with me until I get killed by a player or until I use it all since I have no intention of getting fallout first
---
How is my robot hurting the community? Anyone who visits my shop can take scrap out of the container as I leave it unlocked. Quit being dramatic.
---
Literally none of that is actual "predatory"  there is nothing forcing you to have those premiums items.  "But the community was asking for them " does not count to make something necessity.  And fuck off with your  "back in my day" bullshit.  I was giving examples of what broken games actually look like.   Falloit 76 is not broken. Literally every single "online only" game is subject to the exact same issues on server instability, it's not just a fallout thing
---
Here's hoping!
---
The catch is, does the subscription include any pay-to-win edge.  I don't think it really does at this point but they keep getting closer to the line.  While it's just bling and convenience, then having other people fund the development effort for expansions is all good by me.
---
Game rent?  Do... do you think this new subscription everyone's whining about is pay to play?
---
Well I feel like thats on your fault then (not initiating pvp, but losing the scrap) I only collect what I need and bulk and sell the rest
---
Yeah! Then they fix their shit to NOT take advantage and try to at least mend the broken trust
---
Emphatic
---
Like, they stay that way even if you log off log back on 2 months later?
---
Dude! I can see my stash in my vendors! I'm getting a buddy to verify if he can see it!
---
They did fix that line about the oil spill starting with "83a: An oil spill..." :)
---
Thanks, will add the damage bug again.  
---
**Issue: Respawns are occasionally happening in multiples.** (Ticket Submitted on 10/25/2019)
---
A few reports of double and triple spawning groups of NPC's quickly murdering the players and then even more spawns occurring when they return.   
---
Unable to replicate yet, but reported by three sources.

So I'm guessing Anniversary Birthday suit is not an option

Hey u wanna refund me for my 60 dollars, I would love it.

FO76 is crap, and that will never change

(Sigh)

You've never thrown a coconut at anyone, have you?
---
this is real fun post. youre a real fun guy, fun guy.
---
No kidding.
---
IT IS!
---
I've been doing a very similar run. I also hit all the BoS sites to get ammo bags for ballistic fiber.
---
Says the person who doesn't want people to call subscribers names. Little rich bud.

Just trying to do my part!

&gt; Strange seams still all over ~~Whitespring~~ no, it's the entire map.  Not sure if it has always been, but I see it now: [https://imgur.com/a/Vrzpj6A](https://imgur.com/a/Vrzpj6A) 
---
Can you zoom out or give me a map picture? Can't find the seams.
---
I collect everything because I never know how much of something I'm gonna need in any given example, one being how much material I'll need if my camp gets nuked or how much I need to make a full set of power armour or anything else. I always bulk everything but since I haven't been back to my camp in hours and the one thing i only had a few pieces of was plastic I couldn't bulk anything to sell.
---
I was thinking of making one but with all of the hate surrounding it I’d think it would be better to not
---
Yep that was a big deal then too! I just grinded more atoms from challenges to get those
---
 
---
## (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
---
near the Whitesprings, we can build a camp there...and pretend that no one is around. Overprice our items for the volume. And then pretend we're not a fucking clown.
---
Anyone ever tell you the Free States is the worst 76 faction?
---
Hope you enjoy eating shit while the rest of us ask for something better
---
I thought there was something about the refined receiver taking longer to break. Though I’ve never tested it.
---
They have virtual servers off physical servers, per Bethesda every Fallout1st player entering a new World is suppose to trigger a new Server session
---
Yea man, we speak the same language.  Sorry for jumping on ya so quick,  I was just a quick trigger finger  because you all this stuff lately.  I can understand where your coming from on your line, it just doesnt bother me.  I personally got caught up in madden ultimate team when it first came out.  Spent probably $500 on packs.  Realized quickly after that,  I wasnt willing to support a game that way.  I had a bigger problem back in the day with dlc map packs.  Things that split the community, and was much more of a necessity than anything fallout is doing
---
tons of display problems look local but are actually overloaded servers. jump worlds first. if that doesn't help do a clean install of the graphics card drivers, then try in game settings.
---
Wild appalachia was delayed by one day, and update has been delayed. And if Bethesda helped obsidian with vegas, great, they did their job. I have the right to complain on a franchise that I like, reddit is made for this. I have all the reasons to rage on a game I bought. Life is too short for you to reply my comment like me right? There is no reasons for you to rage on the fact that I rage about a game. The simple answer is the complains of this games are reasonnables and people have the right to complains.
---
I'm not....
---
Consider yourself lucky. Now I have to regain everything I lost which took 2 days to get in the first place only for me to inevitably lose it again to a griefer or crash or something else
---
I've logged in and it's been on 24 before, it can change
---
I believe that is where I got bored with it. Right before meat week.
---
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again.
---
Unlimited junk just means you can be lazy or you can create pointless collections of stuff.  Doesn't help you win anything.  2nd fast travel site is of no use whatsoever at end game because you spend all your time bouncing off max caps anyway so fast travel becomes something you don't give a shit about.
---
In the interest of clarity, I have now read my comment aloud.
---
I keep a solid 80 of anything uncommon or hard to get, and 100 if everything else, and anything that weighs .1 each is most likely unnecessary after a certain level, like antiseptic and black titanium, selling those for 1 cap each to vendors will clear up quite a lot of space due to them only being used in like, 2 thing each
---
I only have ps plus, but at least I get 2 free games a month if I want for 69.99 for a year
---
My guess is they must be making something on it, that or too much invested for it to fail so they keep pushin on.
---
Ya I never got into fallout 76 but figured whatever everyone's allowed to screw up but after this I'm not really trusting Bethesda like I used to.
---
No, but you essentially are renting. Once Bethesda kills the servers, all your shit is gone too
---
I noticed this as well. I sort of figured it was players making alts now that wastelanders got delayed. But it also could be a bunch of high levels left the game so you get put on severs with newbies more often.
---
The only problem I'm having (on PS4) is the health button is where VATS is on FO76, so I've accidentally huffed my health puffer about 30 times so far
---
Younger people also dont realize that the price of games really hasn't gone up much in 30+years.  On normal inflation, games should cost almost $200.  So I'm fine with companies making money off most mtx, as long as it's not legitimately necessary to buy in order to play with friends
---
Probably would be good to wait
---
Yeah all 1000 of them
---
Personal attacks are not cool, so I wonder why you started with them? Anyways, enjoy, we don't have to talk since neither of us are going anywhere.
---
It’s a multiplayer persistent fallout game. There’s nothing else like it. What other game can you join a friend and launch a nuke? Take over and defend a workshop? Watch your character and camp evolve over a long period of time?
---
I haven’t spent a dime on this game since my initial $30 purchase.
---
Sure I’m disappointed about the subscription, specifically the implications to the already rough game economy. All in all, I’ll just adapt. 
---
Also, to those playing too much: Take a break! Gaming is much more fun with variety.
---
Very strange response
---
Same
---
The first video I heard about this topic came from YouTuber Luke Stevens, who released the video '[I Figured Out WHY Bethesda Got So GREEDY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJt_i2_vsSw)'. 
---
JuiceHead also did a couple of videos on this very topic. 
---
The first, '[The Real Reason Bethesda Changed Their Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd9jvQG9MIM)' was released in late September, and he also mentions the Luke Stevens video. 
---
He did another one just yesterday, '[The Real Reason Bethesda Added a Subscription Service to Fallout 76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHbXEouo7fk)'.
---
Because I already spent $60 on it and I actually enjoy the game
---
ok bye have fun
---
If you're being serious, I believe it's under your subscriptions when you check your account.
---
r/openmindgamers to talk about games without whiny bitches
---
Glad I’m not the only one
---
Hell, I've had disc in my console since I bought it. But haven't played in months.  The store stopped working so I can't connect and I kept getting DC'd while playing game for over a week so I stopped playing.  Reinstalled and everything a couple times.
---
Month later tried again with same issue so gave up until I feel like playing again.
---
So is it confirmed that it actually got fixed yet? I lost my scrap and checked after the maintenance but still didn't see my lost scrap. Is it atleast safe to use?
---
99% - I enjoy it 
---
1% - spite
---
There hasn't been slap damage in a very long time. And mini is right, with pacifist on it doesn't go off.
---
Yeah, I mean having bought it generally I’d say it’s only really worth the price tag if you really want the skin, already habitually buy atoms, or really love building. I’m only planning on keeping it for a month and scrapping the hell out of everything has been nice but events are pretty lonely
---
Great work as always!   
---
\-They've not fixed it yet :(    
---
\-Let me know if you grab a photo, my performance is still in the toilet so harder to test stuff.  
---
\-There is also a free screw loop as well, It seems these are low priority :(
---
but here's the shitty thing....everyone still complaining, myself included, are paying customers. We wanted a refund when it first came out and Bethesda refused to refund thousands of people.  Like they've been shitty from the start.  And even after being sold a non functioning game, they're charging people even more to play the most basic gaming concepts.
---
Yup that's what I feel like too.  Nothing yet is P2W but each step seems to be a little closer and pushing the boundary a little further.  Still, until someone kills something before I can get a shot in because they had some unobtainable atom-store weapon, i.e. until someone wins because they paid, I'm not too worried.
---
&gt;Life is too short for you to reply my comment like me right? There is no reasons for you to rage on the fact that I rage about a game. 
---
Dood... look at my replies, I'm not raging on anything. I'm not even clear on what you are so upset about? Is your gameplay any different today than it was a month ago? How does someone deciding to get a subscription affect you at all? Some people like to complain because they have no joy in their life...do you have joy in your life? Do you get your joy by attacking people that just want to play a game and have fun? Think about it.
---
r/openmindgamers is for talking about games without whiners
---
So tell me,  do the notches on your pistol really number from one and nineteen more?
---
Yeah I created my account just recently. You know reddit doesnt require you to create an account to visit the website. You have a lot of time for a guy that say " life is short" . You replied all my fucking comments. You dont have to tell me what to play. I can play whatever I want. I can complain on whatever I want. When you complain, its mean you care, I'm not a mindless robot that agree with everything. Stop hating free speech. Stop saying that people who don't agreed with you fake troll.
---
Sometimes the bag doesn't load for others so only you can see what you dropped.

Sometimes also the lowbie isn't really a newbie and just doesn't want the bag of goodies.
---
&gt;Watoga has a magazine that seems to end up inside the terrain, in a sloped stone wall under the monorail cars in the SE of Watoga.  With panapictagraphist, I can hear it, but never find it.  Haven't been able to get into the terrain to check.
---
If you could grab a screenshot of the map it would help, thanks!
---
I too am curious. I lost all my scrap and just spent like an HR and 10k buying most of it back. Probably not even gonna use the scrap box for now
---
As you spend time hating on a game you don’t play lmfao what a scrub
---
I have ps plus also, its a good deal
---
Sometimes the simplest questions have the simplest answers. We like it.
---
Exactly
---
If you were on pacifist mode, it can't trigger PvP unless it's a bug or you were in a workshop zone, had a teammate not on pacifist that triggered it, or the guy was wanted.
---
Like I said it did for me. The person was trying to damage me by weapon bashing which came up on the screen with the red indicator, my electrically charged went of and I got one hit with his explosive laser rifle. I refered to it as slap damage because it looks like you're getting damaged but realistically nothing's happening
---
Well, I'm not gonna say that this harassment you're receiving is deserved, but by buying the pass then you're ensuring that shit like it will appear in future games
---
I suggest you uninstall. That's a metric they see.
---
I have actually. Do you understand businesses at all? People have been paying for all sort of crappy microtransactions, subscriptions, DLC for years.
---
You know what paying for that tells a business? It tell's them they like it! Why? Because otherwise no one would buy it. So yea, the amount of 1st subscribers tells me (and certainly Bethesda) that people don't care about breaking their promises. The message is pretty clear. I don't like it, hence I haven't subscribed to 1st. But clearly over a 1/3 has and clearly they told Bethesda their fine with it.
---
yup....and from now on all their games will be subscription based pay-to-win games...
---
Thanks for encouraging their anti consumer ways.
---
I won’t resort to using foul language.
---
Anyone can do what they like, freedom is a right.
---
But just realize that you are enabling Bethesda for this type of nonsense.
---
&gt;Yeah all 1000 of them
---
Wow, good you, you sure got me! If you thought that only 1K people were playing it I doubt you'd be quite so uptight about it.  Ah well, you do you
---
I mean its pretty shitty, same with half price sale weeks after launch.
---
So, stash it like you always have?
---
&gt;"account  has logged in on another device" NOPE...it hasn't.  No local IP change.   No reason for this.  Getting it on logging in pretty often.  Sometimes  after crashing out.  Sometimes on logging in fresh after not being logged  in for a day or more.  My account isn't hacked (PW changed) and this is clearly a bug (as a quick googling will confirm).
---
Do a Control-Shift-Escape...  Hit "F" a few times to check for a not fully closed Fallout76.exe
---
The client has not been closing cleanly for a couple patches, I found this out one day after picking up my headset after hours away from the PC and hearing the FO76 music.
---
No one was wanted and I was at Aaronholt Homestead. The only thing that had happened is that we had just finished free range then out of nowhere that happened and then when I respawned the person had taken my scrap and server hopped
---
Thankfully it just says playstation plus still
---
And the immature fanboys are already here. I asked a question, man. I domt care about what you have to say. Go have fun playing your broken game, and stop being mad at me cuz i was smart enough to not buy the game.
---
Do you HONESTLY believe Bethesda will change their minds about paywalling content?
---
Ah, fair enough, I ran into those types actually in the game xP Guess I'm not surprised their here too then
---
Anyone ever tell you that raiders don't leg hump?
---
Youre a day late my friend. The troll army that was behind you is dwindling &amp; already moved on to the new controversy of the day
---
Got a bunch of mainframe cores? They weigh 1.5 pds now
---
They call me;
---
#REAL. DEAL.
---
For a reason. That’s just when I stopped countin’
---
Um, okay? I didnt know asking a genuine question was considered trolling now
---
I guess the ultimate test is, would I buy their next game?  Answer, well I sure as hell won't pre-order it.  I'd have to give it at least a month before becoming invested in anything from then again.  I'm one of those 'never another EA game in my life' types.  Bethesda's not that bad yet.
---
what do you do if you are the only one in the world? what do you nuke? lol
---
can you pick them up?
---
Where did I attacked players who play the games????? I just said in the first stance that the complains are 100% reasonnable. What is so fucking hard to understand. Do you have joy in your life to comments every comments I made and called me a fake troll? Do you have joy in your life? Think about it

---
i actually like private servers tho. just make sure you have no one in your friends  list lol
---
You’re really owning me by bragging on the behalf of a company scamming players out of their money in every way possible. I feel really owned when you shill for Bethesda
---
And you keep having fun!. I think t's important for people to call out the bs that is going on. 20 bucks for a skin, creating a need and selling the solution in the atom shop, and yearly subscriptions to private server are bad business. Yes it will make them money, but it's the wrong kind of money and I believe it will kick 'em in the butt, it's very terse. It seems like a ruse they want to pull on their player base and not the honeypot that is to attract players or fans of the series. 
---
I feel like you paid your 60 get your moneys worth, but the subscription is jank and even then if people want to buy it that's cool have fun but it makes you jank too. I guess it's like a meat eater eating meat, like ya if it makes you feel happy, that's great for you but a non meat eater is going to be morally adverse to you. It's non of their business but it sorta is. 
---
There is a better concept for how 76 would be profitable and less hagard and the more I watch they way the implement good ideas in the worst way is  so ridiculous.
---
Battle royale? Great idea....Shoulda been f2p and they make money on selling skins like Fortnite.
---
Private servers? Great, shoulda been an offline modable instance that was just something anyone could host themself.
---
The atom shop, should have been reasonably priced with a bunch of content creator making fun additions,
---
DLC should be big additions in a little way.
---
The lag, the glitches, the griefing, grind, monetization, emptyness and lack of the step to make the world less vapid, the shortcomings of just not adding many cool dynamics and they way the take what the community asks for and uses it as a threat back at us but act like they are doing us a favour is being a bad friend. Of which they are not, they are not our friend. The game is a little fun because the fallout universe is kooky but burn it all they make such stupid choices on how to handle the series.
---
If you set me down with 10 hours to wait for an appointment and had noting to do but play 76 it'd be about as fun as any game....until the internet cuts out.  Some people would not even bother playing it during the wait because it is not living up to expectations and I agree. It's serviceable and can be outstanding but is such a piss off.  Very much like how I feel Pokemon Sword and Shield will be. 
---
Pit it up against ESO under the same company and that game is doing incredibly well in a more tolerable manor.  It would be cool if they had an offline version.
---
It’s the gift that keeps on giving.
---
I'm not sure you do... Like... If you did, you'd understand people value things differently...
---
It ’s a demo riot. Reminiscent of Appalachian prewar days.
---
When you pay a $100 for a subscription to services that should be in the game by default, you’re an idiot. Simple.
---
Nobody is supporting you though? 
---
Ohh you meant the other guy with rational thoughts. Odd.
---
hrm I love FO76 even though it's got a ton of problems.  But having a great first 24h with Outer Worlds!
---
Yeah, they would be
---
Interesting, will try and look into that one.  
---
Do you remember the quest name?  
---
  Rare but hate that one...  
---
Is it any item&gt;? I've not had it happen with blackberry juice or glowing steaks, but have with Purified water, which is weird...
---
Yeah, I feel you. I may need to take a reddit break before my blood pressure goes up.
---
im glad they are gonna address that soon
---
that might help kill SOME of the hate.
---
i actually really like the private servers though i have no issues as i have no one on my friends list
---
it makes it feel like a single player game honestly not perfect but def way better then before. i honestly could care less about the multiplayer  :-p (more since you cant text chat and i dont use a mic)
---
&gt;You have a lot of time for a guy that say " life is short" . You replied all my fucking comments. You dont have to tell me what to play. I can play whatever I want. I can complain on whatever I want. 
---
Well, you know, it's a long ride home and I'm not the driver today, so all I have is time until I get home and log into FO76.
---
I never once told you what to play or what to complain about,  I mearly pointed out that you may want to consider where all that rage is coming from and try to address the problem.  You keep going the way you are you're going to make yourself sick. Relax man. Chill. It's just not healthy
---
Well you kinda need it to even play the game so, it's good 2 have
---
But then everyone has it, which goes against their greedy fallout 1st crap.
---
Seriously, you claim you’re genuinely asking, and that’s how you word your question? 
---
Almost as hilarious as your defensive responses...
---
I swear if i buy ES6 it will be a month after it comes out and only if the reviews are at least OK.. they have lost the chance to ever sell me anything preorder again
---
Got any paint ball guns?  I heard those went up 100 pounds each.
---
i just bough it but i am playing totally solo private world no friends in my friends list lol
---
my level 5 character from the beta is still there! lol
---
It’s very true. Personally, if they just made games cost $200, I’d be fine—assuming they didn’t come out as total crapfests. The entertainment value per dollar would still be huge. But that’s just not going to go over well at all.
---
Hahaha,  some deep breaths and a few aspirins, followed by  a few hours of Netflix should do the trick.  Enjoy your weekend friend
---
&gt; Do you have joy in your life to comments every comments I made
---
Well, I'm in a car on a long drive home and I'm not the driver today, so I have nothing better to do,  how about you?
---
I bought a second copy of 76 recently to have an alt account so I can store and trade items on mules easily with my laptop and desktop. I have been playing since beta and I love the game. I've been making tons of friends on it as well that I might not have met had I not played this game. I have purchased atoms and I bought a few lunchboxes on fallout shelter, who cares?!? 
---
I payed for fallout 1st, used the atoms to buy the fridge I was saving up for with daily atom challenges. I haven't had a chance to extensively use many of the features included with fallout 1st but I will in the next few days. Haven't encountered anyone talking smack but I have seen a lot of scrap boxes in people's camps...
---
If someone is harassing you, report them. If someone disagrees with your decision to pay for fallout 1st, ignore them. Play the game you enjoy and don't feed the toxic trolls that jump on the hate wagon every single time an update/news drops. I can promise that  I will be reporting anyone who threatens or harrases me. 😉
---
Most ps4 online games need it. Kinda a cheap move, since ps3 didnt need it
---
thank you
---
It would completely crash the entire game industry
---
12 people were offended by my post. I’m a monster.
---
Nope it’s literally a fact that is doesn’t but I’m not gonna argue with you over a date on a game that doesn’t matter
---
I mean, when a game is released as broken and then they try to make people pay for features that shouldve been there since launch, the game is usually looked at as awful. Its not my fault you got offended by the truth. Youre allowed to like the game, i just wanna know why
---
i didnt say that
---
i said "please tell me sooner if possible"
---
Sued for what? I'm genuinely curious as I know nothing about laws and sewing. I mean suing.
---
i fell in love with it agian i played the beta and while i loved the world i just didnt like a) the low fov which is now fixed......and the mutilplayer aspect..your wandering around minding your own buisness and some asshole comes up to you and emotes and your like go away im just exploring. lol. now ......private servers (if you have no one on your friends list lol)  you can play it by yourself! no worrying about people killing up the npcs before you .
---
i love the world and while its not perfect i just ordered the guide book for the map and the area guides lol
---
You sound like a fun and reasonable person. 
---
*in the tiniest font "Fallout76is fun but what Bethesda is doing to it is nearly criminal and at worst irks me something fierce" lol
---
Oh really? Damn, I thought they got rid of that exploit. I’ve honestly never seen or noticed a more blatant show of disrespect for a game’s customer base. At least with Activision you get a nice polished game that runs well. Bethesda’s games have always been among my favorites but this whole episode with Fallout 76 has probably turned me away from this company for good. There are too many great developers and great games being produced to accept any bullshit like they are pulling.
---
Lol. Ok, whatever you say man, whatever you say.
---
How would you know dub? You don’t play lmao go watch YouTube videos about how video games are and never play it for yourself.
---
Another keyboard knight
---
 i didnt say that i said "please tell me sooner if possible"
---
Duse, calm down. Dont get mad at me, im not the one trying to take all your money from you
---
Exactly... up until this 76, bethseda was a game company instead of a games as service. They function more as a mobile app studio than anything else. It's the fan that are killing this game and highly likely limiting all future games by going along with this practice.
---
So many of you have invested way more than I have. I sincerely hope that Bethesda treats you all right. You deserve it. 
---
that is very, VERY nice of you. We are actually on PC.
---
This has been a mechanic since the game launched.
---
Because honestly, if Bethesda (or Zenimax) wants to go the multiplayer, microtransaction direction with all their games (something I'm still not convinced they'll do, but is definitely not outside the realm of possibility), then I don't think it will really matter how well Fallout 1st does. If it flops, they'll try something else along the same lines until they find something that works, they wouldn't go "guess we'll go back to doing the same single player games everyone loves" and backtrack. At that point Bethesda and their games would become something different, and you either accept it or move on. I might decide to leave, but I'm not going to bemoan those who stay or the new people who come in to partake, even if I'm disappointed that I won't see the followup I wanted for one of my favorite series. To me, it would be a path they decided to take, not one that players forced them or encouraged them to, at least that's the way I see it.
---
Yeah, but hey if you want you get 24 free games a year
---
Will you message me the dupe glitch?
---
Y r u here if u didnt even buy the game wat the hell haha u cant have an opinion if u dont even play it
---
Overseer may not, but Vault-tec would approve
---
Genuinely? 😂😂😂🖖🏾🖖🏾
---
Fallout 76 is not a subscription based pay to win game. But you want to know what is? World of Warcraft. You have to sub just to play the game after level 20. Actually get some info into that head of your and look up some definitions.
---
Dude, calm down. Dont get mad at me, im not the one trying to take all your money from you
---
I give a fuck, and if Bethesda is smart, they do too.
---
Good chance all your power armor has had the parts taken off the frames.
---
The situation changes constantly. At that time, that line would not have been a lie. What about the current situation? Fallout76 may not be able to continue with an atom shop alone. Users need to be not only obsessed with old language, but also tolerant of change.
---
actually they have responded to some of the issues and will fix some of them soon.
---
i think there just super laxy and a bit money hungry but....i think eventually fallout 76 may take steps in a better direction. and i think wastelanders IS coming ...it just needs more time.
---
i think the rage is a "tad" overblown as its not like they didnt say they will refuse to fix the issues at all..... it just sucks for many that they didnt before hand.   i can wait. i got a LONGG way to go in this game lol  im gona spend most of this just exploring every area around me to grab up all the loot i can build up my resources and then venture out further lol without worrying about other players yay!
---
This fantasy is really important to you, huh?
---
Because it is what Bethesda has been doing.
---
Legit love of the game, the concept, the story. I wasn't a crazy player, but still reached level 240. At the point I stopped, I was well through all content, solo all main events, LOVED fashnact, meh to nuclear winter. Had all the caps I needed. 
---
Was building fun bases (my last base before uninstall was a lighthouse complete with switchable lighting and a dockyard vendor area). Had several collectible costumes. Had the pioneer quests as far as I could go, could NOT get the magazine's or grenade plan. Tried (excessive grind).
---
Honestly I love it, its a real shame. This is over the top though. I want the outfit, I played hard to get it in NV even siding with NCR just to bait a ranger far enough away to off him without consequence. But that much money? I paid full price (CAD). Gimme a break I can't afford to keep dumping cash to enjoy my games further, or have them focus on the wrong things. 
---
Thank you for asking.
---
Stop trying to act like dr Phil. You are clearly not winning the argument and now you try to attack my being. Complaining about a game is not a mental issue. It's 100% healthy to not agreed with everything and complains about it. And I'm not minority, dont you see on fucking reddit or youtube, everybody are trashing bethesda. Even hardcore bethesda fans, even the players like me. 
---
It's normal and healthy to complains.
---
Poor form  and a step in the wrong direction is what Bethesda has been doing. They set a poor example of a large company that hopefully is not imitated in the future.
---
There  are  two hundred thousand people here
---
Im gonna be honest, i couldve given it a better try. The problem is i didnt have anybody to play with. I tridd capturing some factory and was attacked by way too many monsters. Used every last round of ammo i had to take it, then somebody immediately attacked
---

---
I know you're just a troll but on the chance you're just naive, this game was in no way profitable. The reason they're nickel and diming their player base with no care is because they need to make back the massive losses they had making this game. They've basically come right out and said it with all these recent headlines "we don't care how we make the money back, but we will make it back"
---
Are you on PC, PS4, or Xbox?  I'm hearing this tends to work differently, depending on what platform you're playing on.
---
I see they're made an excellent choice in priority regarding fixes, they get a pat on back :)
---
Only the idiots who had blind faith and got ripped off, sure. Anyone dumb enough to buy this game deserves to be ripped off.
---
oh how the mighty have fallen
---
But my immersion!   How dare they make scrap weigh nothing!  /s
---
Im here to find out why people like this game. I dont care if people like it, im glad people can find enjoyment in something. I just wanna know why people stay through all the scams. So far ive been learning that its a lot of fanboyism, what with all the people who are getting angry over my question
---
The ignorance of the responses should answer your question.
---
i say one step foward two steps back is usually their progress.
---
i think wastelanders will come. i think even full mods for private servers will come and maybe some tweaks to iron some things out down the road too.   i am actually positive for the future dispite these major setbacks
---
cuz private servers ARE mostly working (just as long as you clear out your friends list) and quite honestly that was one of the main things that kept me from gettin the game at first. as i could really care less about multiplayer and wanted to go at my own pace/.
---
i can understand the rage but i think it may be a "tad" out of hand.
---
It's not like Zenimax is whispering in their ears... it's like they're grabbing them by the  collars and forcing them a certain direction.
---
You're taking it too literal. Anti-consumerism is an ideology. Being anti-consumer however means you don't care for the well-being of your consumers or about being honest to them. I get what you mean but in this context it is obvious that we are not talking about the ideology.
---
Yeah, this model and texture was in the original base game files. So it's definitely been there from the start.
---
OP Skinner: Could it be the dipshit Youtubers are out of touch...  Not its the actual people who play the game are  wrong.
---
That it has. Its mostly just fanboys lmao. I appreciate all the respectful people tho, keep having fun playing what you like
---
Ok, calling you Ben Shapiro may have gone a bit too far. I'm sorry. 76 will retain a lot of core players, and new players will be attracted to events. But what I can't stand is whenever they do release anything new. The internet goes into all out rage hate mode. No matter what. Outrage culture is so persistent, and profitable on YouTube that it gets frustrating.
---
This thread is full of a bunch of useful idiots who love getting played
---
Lol, is all I can say. More PR bullshit.
---
Because I enjoy it. It’s not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.
---
To expand a little, I'm 34 years old and have been gaming since me ol' man brought a 
---
 comadore 64 home one day. I have owned more or less every mainline console and handheld since (Apart from PS2... Really fucked up there), I play a wide variety of games: Darkest Dungeon, Sekiro, Cryptark andRemnant are in my last 5 played games. I think you're missing my point, I acknowledge the games faults and subsequent frustrations. I been playing the game on and off since beta so have a good grasp of how things were - that fucking firing sound glitch included - and how things are now. I even agree with what you're saying about some of their business decisions. 
---
I'm simply saying there is fun to be had in the game in spite of some of its shit, which is now considerably less than it was in the early days believe it or not. And that the games playerbase is decent. That's it.
---
Exactly halfway between Morgantown Highschool and Bolton Green. Unmarked house full of mounted cat heads, cat traps, and a ton of cat bowls to scrap for a bunch of plastic.
---
It absolutely is. You have to pay them to keep play a game...you already paid them for. Also their mission statement of "save player 1" is a complete joke now because of this.      https://bethesda.net/en/article/56dSIqRXXysEs8ueSkWO60/save-player-1
---
If you ask immature questions you're going to get immature answers.
---
Now hold on professor, I'd probably still prime those missiles; first thing I heard on login was his usual drivel.
---
You guys are really trying your hardest to make this game worse. Screw it, I'll just go to West Virginia in real life.
---
You just described every single live service game on the market...
---
You should be.
---
Diabolical. You’re hired!
---
fallout 76 is just fine for on sale for 26 bucks and or even less on amazon at the moment.  in my view if you have no friends in your firends list the private servers actually are worth the price as they feel like a single player game....not perfect but more how i wanted fallout 76 to be.
---
i love the world and setting.  and i just bought the CE guide book for the maps and area guides.    
---
if you can get over the hate and be aware of some of the issues and some work arounds then i say it actually is not a bad game at all
---
for explorers anyways. for those who  want a super great story and tons of great npcs. yeaaaaaaah maybe not.
---
but 26 bucks or even less then 40 with the monthly subscription is not a bad deal to me.  most other private servers that are hosted do cost.  it would be NICE to have a private server tool for your own but \*maybe\* down the road.  despite the major issues i think private servers does pave the way to the game i wanted it more to be like. just me exploring a big wide world lol
---
The point is that there is no justification for this being worth it... they're charging as much as premium subscription services for literally minimal content... Like a skin, and emotes? another pay to win mechanic, a private server when the game in itself is still incredibly buggy and lacking basic functions? Like I can't but help side more with the people harassing those who feed into this type of bs, its not good for the culture. You're letting them leech into your wallets and telling them its okay, it's not okay, you're just telling them that it's okay to put anything behind a paywall.  Sorry but not sorry, this type of thing should be completely rejected by gamers as a whole, and if that means protecting people from themselves, and for the future of our games then yes I'll look down on people who support this bullshit!
---
True dat
---
Here's the rub. Those people subscribing are making it impossible to get the message through to Bethesda. Yeah you can direct your anger to Zeni-Beth but as long as these spinless sheep are plunking down more money than a new game costs just for broken "private" servers, it won't matter.
---
These people subbing are sending this publisher the message, that Bethesda should be rewarded for treating us all like shit. Because of their lack of willpower, and sensibility, we ALL suffer as a consequence. And not just here, other companies look at this and learn.
---
Valve, for instance, brought loot boxes to the west. Now they are everywhere. Because Valve fans didn't take a stand.
---
Subbing to this game damages the industry.
---
You specifically worded your question to start shit and insult. Keep your toxicity on the regular fallout sub.
---
I've tapered of playing Fo76 recently. I was way more disappointed with the delay to the new content.
---
To answer your question, I enjoy building my camp, stocking my machines, chasing down good legendaries, and perfecting my build. The pve combat is decent and some of the repeatable quests are fun. I have yet to actually experience any kind of game breaking bugs that just turn me off completely, but I only started playing in april (bought the game in December on sale, but life just got hectic). The limited time events I've played in were pretty fun too. Some stuff is way too expensive for me in the atomic shop, but I've dropped $30 in total with the bundles that included extras atoms and an outfit to get the stuff I felt like I really wanted. Nuclear winter is a fun side game I'll play when I get bored.
---
Aww it can read numbers but not sarcasm, you’re a cutie
---
Don't confuse devs with those who make business decisions.  Many times developers have to do things according to the direction of the corporation.  You can't put them in the same boat 100%.  For all we know there may be some developers who don't like these changes but are forced to embrace the change.
---
  My own company recently introduced a change I don't like and disagree with, but as a department head I need to endorse it the best I can.  It's not something that is immoral, it's just silly honestly, but it faced a lot of backlash from my associates who answer to me.  If I didn't endorse it I could honestly lose future opportunities.  Welcome to the real world guys, where life is way more complicated than we think and all you bitching and griping about it aren't making it any easier.
---
I e never had this happen with pacifist on. This nor the explodey rad one.
---
I think 1st is indefensible garbage, but this is using Reddit exactly right.
---
lowSodiumAnthem was also the right solution when their community was dealing with a lot of bullshit too.
---
Otherwise people who don't want to care only contribute to making everything shittier by trying to shut down the angry people.. by.. being.. angry.
---
for 26 bucks on sale on the store plus 13 a month
---
id say its worth it.  its 4 times the size of fallout 4 and while its not as story rich or much npcs if you like exploring a large world and gathering resources and all i think it can be fun
---
private servers DO work.....if you have no one in your friends list (there is a bug currently that any friend can join a private world otherwise) 
---
the endgame may not be quite up to snuff but. for 26 bucks or les then 40 for at least a month  you can def get single player fun out of it.
---
if you liked just exploring in fallout 3 . i think youll enjoy fallout 76 
---
just take your time and dont rush it!
---
and hold out on the scrap unlimited box for now. you get 800 scrap and just starting out that is PLENTY till you level up a bit more
---
I know what ur trying to say and ure not wrong but trust me Pete knows the business exactly after all these years.. Not saying he is a bad person by all means, but havent heared from him since on that particular topic or did I miss something? They try to sell u everything is perfect but if its not they get quiet. And come on bro FO76 got worse and worse with the atomic shop stuff and now this ridiculous Fallout first stuff, milking whats left of the player base and even then selling a broken and bugged product (private servers as example). Be honest with the fans, tell them that u fucked it up, sales didnt go as expected but u wanna make the game better hence the micro/macro transactions etc. Divison 1 admitted that their game wasnt fun, did overhaul it, went honest with the community in alot of streams and got the turn around.
---
Buying the subscription makes you part of the problem and encourages companies to keep these shitty practices up.
---
"First is great! It's an awesome system that is fully worth my money, but I lost all of my scrap... again." -An idiot circa October 25th 2019.
---
Seriously, do you just enjoy the feeling of daddy Todd going balls deep without lube into you? Or are you somehow oblivious to this fact? It's almost concerning.
---
To be fair the recycled footage isn't too far off from my personal experience of the game; they added stuff but a lot of bugs just weren't fixed; I feel it kinda matches the current state of the game if you only consider the technical issues still present.
---
I made it past the main quest and lvl 50 and put it down afterwards. What's in it for the high level players?
---
That's fine. Your opinion on what is credible or not, is worthless.
---
It's funny how you say that because I read an article a couple weeks ago by Forbes on this game.  The article cited various issues with the game using old beta footage that had actually been addressed and NO ONE called them out in that shit.
---
They are :)
---
Pretty confident that's going to remain free for all who own the game.
---
To be fair, fanboys aren't known for their quick wit. I mean, you kind of have to sign off on any deep thinking just to *be* one.
---
Must be a bug that I just unluckily fell victim too
---
I think they might be paint jobs, as using the armor bench on it brings up the pain option.
---
its supposed to be free but no telling the way things have been
---
Why am I playing this awful game?  Because I want to.
---
I quit playing a while ago. I’m just here to monitor the rants.
---
First you have to find Preston Garvey.
---
Most games last 20 to 30 hours for the same price as fo76 I have over 1000 in it along with thousands of other people, how is a company supposed to keep it running ,add more content fix bugs without income from it like the atom shop and the new content, user pays nothing is free for ever
---
To be fair, over time it will functionally be a subscription service. The vast majority of the new features are impossible to earn ingame already. That trend is set.
---
It stands to reason that the value of atoms will fluctuate. Year subscribers are going to feel their $99 investment isn't as valuable if they have tons of Atoms collecting dust. Either the supply of shop items or the median Atom price will have to go up.
---
Lol good luck.
---
I wish I shared your confidence, ESO has a bunch of DLC that you have to buy seperatly and I would not be surprised if they went with that model. I really do hope you're right though!
---
thanks
---
No need to be sorry. Many of us are happy with the money we've spent, and will continue to spend.  New Vegas sucked a lot of hours from my responsibilities.  Good times.
---
The elevator, or the pylon just prior?
---
One thing I've done (have one camp inside the pylon) is to build a camp, stairs to halfway up and the place your camp again up / inside whatever structure.
---
Dude the fuck are you here then, Your on a fallout reddit post and yet your brown nosing, acting all high and mighty, I'm an artist my dream is to work for a video game company and make art, You delude yourself if you think that video games are pieces of art, Go back and think a bit before you come out here acting superior cause your not cultured your the opposite, you ignant
---
Daddy Todd, and Uncle Hines do like money. At this point anything is possible. Although the pr nightmare that would ensue might even stop them from doing something as egregious as that.
---
There is no effing way Bethesda will do that. There are still bugs in FO76 today there identified at FO4 launch.
---
No, they're still framed up.
---
I spent several minutes interacting with at least until its lines started repeating.

---
It's okay to have fun, it's also okay to point out bad business practice. 
---
Cake ,ya like cake ya? Here at Bethesda we take the cake you request and give a an icing covered muffin.
---
"i like muffins and icing"
---
So here at bethesda we add raisins and sprinkles
---
"Cool sprinkles but can I not get raisins?"
---
Zenimax has asked us to double the raisins, we heard your community outcry to add more raisins and we thank you for eating the raisins
---
"That's okay I just pick the raisins off"
---
You can get no raisins from us now for an extra 5£ per muffin
---
"Why, wouldn't it cost less to just not put them on there?"
---
That's just the way it is and at any time we can decide that's not just the way it is
---
"K well I'm happy to just pick them off then"
---
Posts "I like muffins and icing and think it tastes good"
---
Now here is the analogy The reply they get from a cake lover is "This post highlights all the problems with icing, muffins, raisin and you are the issue!" 
---
They just want to eat, some want the convenience of not picking off raisins.   The company is being unreasonable and the situation is full of instability.
---
Good AAA games without transactions and such are becoming exception rather than norm. Yes, Outer Worlds is great and so will probably be Cyberpunk 2077. These are companies that has not added MC's and such and obviously should be held in high regard.
---
Still, think about it. One of the first games to feature in-game purchases and card packs was FIFA, then it spread to MADDEN, NBA, Overwatch, COD and list goes on.
---
I happen to also enjoy spending my free time gaming like most here probably, but thanks to companies starting to shift heavily towards in-game purchases, they start to put focus on it rather than making the game great (we are currently seeing this happen). Skins that could have been added with mods now cost 5$ or more, which is a days meal in some places, and could also be over 10% of the original games price.
---
Sure, there are Outer Worlds and CD Projekt Red, but on the other side of the arguement, there is EA, Bethesda, Activision, CapCom, Bandai Namco, Ubisoft, Konami etc.
---
And yes, I steer away from these practices, but thanks to that my choice of games is increasingly becoming published by just a few gaming publishers or indie developers.
---
I don't have any cores in my stash. There are some on my character, but that's nothing to do with stash.
---
Now if you honestly liked the story you always end up coming back one way or another, I liked the witcher 3 beat it and completed the game yet I come back to it.
---
Not new. Me n son was kicked out during a legendary scorchbeast fight... talking about bumpers
---
You're all the fools
---
Stash space.
---
That THE benefit that made people go crazy.
---
The craziness is justified because store big numbers does not require extra server resources, so they are taxing people by a problem that does not exist - they made it.
---
Where the heck do you get paintball guns?
---
Have you actually *read* your own posts?
---
Thank you for answering!
---
Oh yes. Worst is when you can hear it but just can't seem to find it. Often in the Mire with a dead officer ghoul's body hiding in long grass. 
---
(also annoying: Having the magazine finding perk on and "hearing" it as really close, but never ever finding it. Like it spawned inside the wall or under a box or something)
---
Terrible person.. You must be silenced!
---
lol people actually still play this shit game? Goddamn you guys will buy up everything. Give it a few weeks, all y'all "angry people" will return and gladly pay for the service. Cuz you're suckers.
---
It’s not a good enough reason to support this shitty practice
---
Become a very popular online game?
---
They will offer everyone that bought the game before FO1st release only 500 atoms and one month free subscription.
---
Everyone will forget what a massive Eff You this was and things will move on as normal.
---
This. I would bet that a fresh ini file would take care of it. It not, you can start tweaking from there. I’d start reducing settings until it seems more playable. Then you can tweak back upwards.
---
Lol.
---
Do we know if any of those items will be for the new nuclear winter Halloween rewards? I know last time they were invisible in the build menu but I figured they would be datamined.
---
I think this has been a persistent issue.  I just didn't out the door on mine.
---
Thank you. This bullshit is clogging up the sub and it's getting ridiculous. Go fucking play outside people.
---
Except Bethesda didn’t even buy Fallout76.com so why the fuck would they even want this domain?
---
That's fine. I'll gladly take a safe space. It's a friggin' video game.
---
I *won't*, however, pay a hundred bucks to do it on a largely broken, barren game. And I certainly won't do it when the private server isn't even mine, and the damn thing eats all my materials!
---
How? They've improved a lot in communication, and put out a statement they were expanding mtx
---
Thats all i needed. I may have been a bit overdramatic in my post, but it was a genuine question. If its as simple as you just wanting to play, then thats my answer. Hope you enjoy the game, man
---
Definitely doesn't show in taskman for these. I have default view to all users, so it's not hiding anywhere either. Sometimes (often) this has happened when I've force quit, so I'm sure there are no other instances then.
---
I think it's just on their end--the server hasn't caught on that the client crashed/is gone and has come back. Of course I'm hurrying to get back on if it was Scorched Earth!
---
People are being irrational
---
Apparently anyone on your friends list can enter, uninvited.
---
Yeah it’s the only reason the pick them up. The codes are so complex it’s insane not to let someone else decode them. Not like any of the challenges to pick them up ever work.
---
Well I'm not that stupid to say it's not a real fallout because bethesda made it, I'm saying Bethesda in terms of writing a fallout game, went down hill after 3, Obsidian did an amazing job in New vegas, and then Bethesda got lazy, 76 is heap of garbage no matter how you look at it. I find it more of a spiritual successor to fallout, but hey I see the similarities to mass effect, it could be a spiritual successor to both since Ea and Bethesda abused and defiled both titles
---
What? Designers are part of the mtx team now?
---
What if someone buys it for me as a gift?
---
I'm pretty sure they're gonna go five electrons on Wastelanders.
---
Are they still implementing major changes to the code without telling anyone? This has been a problem identified by us Every. Single. Patch. It was so egregious about 8-10 months ago that the Community Manager here addressed it directly.
---
Sure if you have evidence that my dog is creating a problem amongst other dog owners and dogs alike
---
 Even though he may not directly interact with you but waves of his behavior should they reach you then by all means yes. I'm not so naive to believe that my dog is perfect nor do I believe that I am perfect and the things I like are perfect BUT I will call your bullshit. And you FO76 fans are pure bullshit.
---
The trailer thing? It’s just a building structure,?so you can make a small ready-made building.
---
Sounds like you were already on your way out.
---
AND the super special stash deletes your junk!
---
Can they be destroyed for scraps?
---
I hear you on that, and it too leaves a sour note with me. I feel that most veteran players have become adjusted to the artificial stash limit and kinda just do their thing. Not to mention having that infinite space isn't really an advantage, at least to me; I could craft and obtain as much of what ever  item I can make as any Fallout 1st member.
---
Todd said that all 2020 DLCs would be free, maybe the ones coming out in 2021 if they will be paid.
---
Why? I always thought that its pretty amazing how Bethesda can pull off their past games with such few developers, AND doesnt have any toxic crunch culture at all. But Fallout 4, being made with only 100 people, was pretty underwhelming compared to other games like Witcher 3 for example with double the devs. Thats why I always blame most of BGSs games problems on this. Not having enough people to make and fix the games is a pretty reasonable understanding of game development, I dont see whats wrong about that.
---
Weird how you quoted yourself.
---
An idiot os someone that blindly enjoy something its own way, not noticing its way support a state that let less people enjoy it too...
---
Tbh that should have been the deal.  Then they can just limit how much certain amounts of scrap we can hold to stop super stockpiling if they care to do so.
---
Lol. You're about 15 years too late.
---
My understanding is that it will be deposited into your inventory, however, I have no clue. There are currently issues with items disappearing, so nothing is certain.
---
Awesome, thanks for the insight. This is the type of answer i was looking for. Hope you keep having fun in the game man
---
It just works - Todd Howard
---
"Wastelanders delayed till January 1st 2021"
---
Fun but to a certain extend til the glitches and bugs gets you frustrated
---
Happened to me the other day, load out of your sever and then immediately load back in, they’ll be alive again
---
ESO is better, subbing gets you all dlc and future dlc to play, which is a lot.
---
IANAL but could see legal prosecution for the use of Bethesda's trademark as well as being a 'fraudulent website meant to masquerade as an official Bethesda product'.  Now if they choose to do so or if they will get anywhere with it if they do choose to is a totally different story.
---
You bought into the meme! What did ya expect? Bubblegum and rocket launchers? No, just black licorice and disappointment.
---
Pretty much sums up all the 76 outrage.  People who don't actually play the game lol
---
But....youre the one still playing...so either, you're saying you are still playing it because you have horrible taste and will happily let a company screw you into the dirt, or you're not gonna keep playing it, in which case, why even both making this post?
---
You should ask your daddy for free benefits then.
---
I hate in nuclear winter when a machine gun fires... and then the sound never stops.
---
 Awesome !  but dude,... DO NOT just give them the domain. You have to put that domain name behind a paywall !
---
That's why it went on sale two weeks after launch, right? I bet they're hemorrhaging money on this project. 
---
Fallout 76 cost the company $100 million to produce, and they've sold 2.6 million or so copies. Fallout 4 sold 15 million.
---
Thats all i needed to know lol. Thanks for letting me know, maybe i'll check it out to see if its really not so bad
---
Glad you’re enjoying it. I’ve read some reviews/criticisms and it doesn’t seem like my thing. I’m hearing it’s 80%-90% dialogue and you level up mostly from that. Along with some other not great things.
---
I’m curious to see what people are saying in a week or so.  I’m hearing it’s not that similar to NV gameplay wise.
---
That doesn't even apply here, but I can't expect intelligence from an ape. Especially not a quantum one.
---
Idk why everyone thought private servers were going to be free. But DLC is going to be free, people need to calm the fuck down.
---
They may have been able to put out the fire, but now they have shit smeared everywhere.
---
I would be surprised if it wasn’t free.
---
Things going as expected... Yep, it'll still be free.
---
But will the Fallout 1st money go into improving FO76 for everyone? Or just Fallout 1st players? Or will it go into another game entirely?
---
Posts like this show why nobody here will ever be a game developer.  This is akin to when people say "just go change the 8 to a 2 and it'll be fine, duh, ez fix"
---
lol your logic is astounding. Go on
---
You take one statement on my entire message and call bullshit. Yes, one line of code was almost 100% certainly wrong and so is the inventory space, so care to write as long and detailed explanation on how I was wrong on artificially generating demand and how they are the only one able to supply that demand in their game?
---
It amazes me that FO 76 can't handle inventory space well with server size of 24 to 32 players, while WoW can handle 2000+ players with and their ever expanding inventory space.
---
Oh, daddy is far too frugal too possibly do that.
---
Private sever? lol no they mean your own and sometimes not instance. Private servers should keep your single player game allowing bigger build budget and the instance should remember your workshop set ups to reload the work once you log back into your private server? I've been waiting for private servers only to find this another kick in the face to the population of Fo76 fans that still support Bethesda after all the Bs Fuck yous that Bethesda has already put the community though. INSAINE prices for a adventure instance that offers so many broken game mechanics still...Disappointed Bethesda.... sigh again.

Seeing as my date is back to 10/23/2102, I'm guessing this is just another bug—maybe something showing up too early. Who knows, here's the screen with the regular date I just took though. https://imgur.com/a/a4fNd1W
---
Having now taken the ill advised plunge last night, I see why folks don't think these worlds are fresh--I hit low level mobs a couple minutes after I spawned in, then they came up to my level. Then I crashed.
---
This afternoon, I gave another go, and the same area (Harper's) spawned at least four legendary muties, all reasonable level (most 60, a couple 48).
---
Idk but there is alot of lawyers working at zenimax

Super hyped for the Chinese stuff, have been waiting for them for so long. Hope the standard flag is in there as well.
---
I feel bad for the people paying up for the subscription.  I don't mean it in a mocking, "haha you're so dumb for liking this" sort of way.
---
This feels very much like a last straw desperation play to me.  They know they will lose players, but they will make more money in the short term.  A lot of businesses see this as a good thing - 80/20 rule scenario. (Summary: 80% of your revenue comes from 20% of your customers.  So please the profitable 20% and forget the less profitable 80%)
---
But the problem is for a video game like this there is an expectation that they *keep making more* content, which from the business side means you have to *keep making more* money.  There's only 2 ways this can happen: find new users to generate more subscription fees or find new ways to monetize the existing users.
---
To me, this move is signaling they're trading users for short term profit.  The only thing left to do to generate more money is squeeze your remaining customers as hard as possible (Paid utility items) and then stop all future content development to shed costs.  I do genuinely feel sorry for people who love this game (I did for a long time), but I personally think the writing is on the wall.
---
I like black licorice xD
---
You made up the quote. therefore you're quoting yourself, even if the quote doesn't apply to you. Learn to play with rules of linguistics every once in a while. Regardless, statistically, I'm much more intelligent than you. 
---
Also, you realize humans are part of the ape family, right? I wouldn't expect to get it.
---
Thank you! Heard of it, but never saw it.
---
The hell is IANAL?
---
I gotta log in to check as well, wouldn't be surprised if its some timing issue.
---
You're assuming they're actually telling the truth and this isn't just another fake lie spread by haters to cause drama
---
This isn't Bethesda's fault it's yours as the consumers, you guys stayed, you guys kept paying, and playing. You guys got the short dick of Pete "Lyin" Hines and then asked, nay.. BEGGED for more. Everyone here who accepted a piss poor product turned what could have created a redemption story (no man's sky) into a story of consumers enabling complacency and unfinished products. YOU are to blame. 
---
Dramatic writing aside, it's still their fault for abusing ever faithful fans, but that doesn't make a good hook so pretend I didn't say this.
---
I dont care if bethesda gives a shit about me or not. I'm not trying to buy their friendship, I'm buying a Halloween bundle and getting a month of perks as a bonus for cheaper than outright buying the atoms directly. No company truly gives a shit about their consumers.
---
And that’s where the similarities end. I only pointed out the similarities. Fallout 76 and ESO are both very different games and the dlc is already free in 76
---
Really? I wouldn't have guessed from the backlash.
---
If you’re happy with it, that’s great. It’s good to know that some have positive experiences. I just wish for all players, that this game was released with better quality oversight and reached the full potential that it had
---
I have the same one, it's a skin only. You have to unlock the backpack first, then you can craft the corvega one.
---
I lost my scrap last night but checked after maintenance and still didn't receive any of my lost scrap. Lost over 400 lbs. I'm not sure if the box atleast works or not. Btw some are reporting that u lose it by using a friend's box. I lost mine by disconnecting from my own private server and then starting a new private server. I'm very hesitant to use it again.
---
I don't know about having an advantage; I already find it extremely easy to obtain materials and items needed even on a full server. The key thing is to know where and when to look. Both public and private world loot is time based so its not like you can pick a new world clean and make another fresh one to scavenge from. With regards to legendary I just farm the route from Hunterville, Westek, and the satellite array. If its occupied I just server hop to a new one until there's an instance without anyone in the desired route.
---
Always love dinguses trying to use ape as an insult.
---
Dub
---
Probably thinking how to word everything. They know they cant fix the issue with words, there going to either ignore it or make an attempt to mitigate it that will piss off some people more and make a few feel better.
---
Being adjusted does not mean the limit is not very annoying.
---
That goes exactly real life... we get used to bad limits, but that doesn't mean we very much want it to change.
---
Getting behind a paywall a solution for an artificial problem is too low. I don't support people fighting each other, but on the other hand I cant blame them for being angry and aggressive due the sensation of being deceived and impotent against bethesda's scheme.
---
I guess they could persist for about a week? I assume Bethesda brings everything down for weekly maintenance.
---
I'm ever the optimist, drinking from this mostly-full cup...🙂
---
Wait, I didn’t pay for the subscription and I played 76 like 45 mins ago....you sir are a lair.
---
My friend, you are far too serious. It's an over simplification of what op said. It's fine that you want to take issue with me, but jesus maybe take the stick out of your ass. Also yes humans are technically related to apes, but they have vastly different intelligence levels.
---
"I Am Not A Lawyer"
---
Yeah, I don’t like the practice. I like owning my games, more so my *save games*. For MMOs it’s fine, cause that’s their purpose, but 76 ain’t an MMO
---
Just curious but what's the logic behind making a post like this? You clearly have no idea what you're talking about, admitting yourself you stopped playing because you didnt want to play the online multiplayer version of Fallout as a multiplayer. And you have how many hours in to New Vegas and still havent figured out it was made by Obsidian?
---
That's good money for a bad meme.
---
Simple like that.
---
Welcome to Appalachia! Hope you enjoy your stay
---
I like black licorice too, but hey most people don't.
---
There was another post made of those rewards but I can't find it at the moment. These are strictly the Mischeif Night event rewards.
---
OH MY GOSH, I forgot that was a thing ;/ Super Smash Bros, Ocarina of Time, Starfox, oh my goodness. Thankfully Nintendo isn't AS bad as the worst gaming companies like Ea and Bethesda, they still make pretty great games and don't over monetize EVERYTHING (but stay away from mobile mario kart, that's just as bad as Bethesda and EA).
---
OP, they've said many times in the past renting a server would cost money.  Because it's an industry standard that renting private servers cost money.  No game lets you do that for free. Anyone who was actually surprised it costs money either never read any of the interviews/dev posts and/or never played other online games.  100$ a year is actually pretty cheap compared to other games.
---
Obviously the quote you posted you had to completely stretch the definition of "content".  Content is clearly added quests, areas, weapons, etc.  Pioneer Scouts, Vault Raids, Nuclear Winter, Barrows, Meat Week, Wastelanders etc.  A private server is not "content" it's a service.
---
1. “No paint” did the trick. Seems the assets are merged after all.
---
3. Hunger/thirst are definitely draining fast. Swapping perks doesn’t seem to help. Going through purified water like crazy!
---
To be fair in like 400 hours of gameplay I've probably only encountered like 5 people ever using a mic.  I play on PS4 which comes with a mic. \*Emotes angrily\*
---
Humans *are* apes. Try educating yourself before speaking foolishly. And hilarious you told me to lighten up when you clearly took my tongue in cheek comment seriously.
---
Stop karma whoring and just do it nobody cares
---
Yes every single one. I tried dropping them as well, but mine drop into a bag. I took videos.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Indistinguishable from one another~
---
They literally cut weight by 90% for bobble heads and magazines in the last patch... that’s not enough? Lol
---
Yes, we're giving you the freedom to actually talk about that, by removing posts about TOW (great game, btw). Fuck Bethesda, love Bethesda, say whatever you want. As long as it's related to this very game.
---
You’re free.
---
If you have a friend load into a place it will respawn everything, i found that out farming westek on a friends private server when i had them come over for a 3*. It actually really good
---
Tongue in cheek? Yowza I'd hate to see your serious side Sam.
---
It was so scummy what they did in ESO, and what's even worse is the amount of revenue they were getting from it regardless. But I mean look at F76 in comparison, it looks as though they're learning
---
If Anthem is a full auto rifle, FO76 is a 12 gauge slug.
---
Some people just see Fallout and assume it's made by them and not look any further into it.
---
They couldn't have just said, "I am not a lawyer" ? Haha
---
Well, gosh, I don't mean to offend your finely tuned sensibilities.
---
That's a logical fallacy, saying it's not "mandatory" as if it doesn't affect everyone else. It does, I understand why you would think it doesn't but how about you look at it logically from a wider perspective? 
---
_____________
---
What happens when an item is sold? Whatever the item is, let's even just go with rice milk for this hypothetical. If NO ONE buys the rice milk, it will stop being sold. So now how about people love rice milk but they start getting lazy and not making it properly and it tastes weird, but people buy it anyways. That company is making a good amount of money off of FAR lazier and less work than they used to, so why would they EVER go back to making good rice milk?
---
______________
---
If you buy the cr*p Bethesda sells, you are enabling them to KEEP selling us cr*p instead of possibly going back to when they had good deals, like the Skyrim DLC. Now do you understand? But I think you misconstrued my point because I'm not saying you can't buy it or you're an idiot if you do buy it, you can enjoy what you want, I'm saying you shouldn't buy it because you should have the self-respect to not pay a company that is literally using you knowing they don't have to make anything with quality because you'll eat up anything they sell. 
---
___________________
---
That's the point, so yeah, you can stop b*tching about how it doesn't affect those who don't pay, because it factually does, friend. No hard feelings, but you're just wrong if you think it doesn't.
---
Unfortunate Name
---
If you didn't pay for anything, it's not aimed at you, and quite frankly, that's  worthy of admiration. Thank you for not being one of the people who are making games worse for everyone.
---
You are complaining about $8/mo for essentially an atom subscription. People buy atoms. Buying the subscription gives you those atoms at a 50% discount. If they want to be atoms, who cares? It’s the cost of a large meal at McDonald’s.
---
Go to a general gaming sub. r/theouterworlds doesn’t need posts about FO76 either.
---
Implying I somehow had no idea that NV was made by Obsidian. Outstanding detective work, have an upvote.
---
I'm gonna assume maybe, but hope for the best that there isn't any cost to it. I'm just basing it on their current track record, so really anything is possible.
---
Theres nothing for me to continue saying.
---
Do you have atomic roller balls (lol) because they have weight to them? Also, are you on PC because there were reported issues with a patch and the scrap everything mod.
---
Well I think Starfield is nearly finished now and BGS would need all of their studios to focus on this one, which makes sense.
---
Oh, also to the ape thing. Yeah scientifically speaking sure ya got me, but please walk up to someone and call them an ape. See how well that goes over.
---
You gonna shill for gamepass on it too?
---
so this is not just another shooter?
---
Hahahahaha I was going to say the same thing...OP hypocrite much?
---
I'm far from offended. In all honesty I find this amusing.
---
I don't really agree. The subreddit is a much better indication of the playerbase as a whole than one person's comparatively few friends. It's not like there are other large communities that are positive about the game.
---
I feel its intended, feed that boy more material and you'll soon get a beast of a box monster :D
---
I want to play Outer Worlds, too. Unfortunately, people don't realize that others are put off of a game if they hear about it from a toxic fan base or seeing it promoted by toxic people. Not specifically talking about you but the Fallout community in general spews do much hate when talking about this game. Like: they only mention it to bash Bethesda or Fallout 76, so that's what people are going to associate it with.
---
Is there any other graveyard areas not close to a scorchbeast that can be built on?
---
how exactly are they screwing us? I can still happily play without 1st subscription and I will continue playing without it
---
Exactly.
---
I remember the quest name yeah, Event: Always Vigilant. 
---
It seems to be any commonly used aid item like Canned Dog Food or Purified Water, chems, etc.
---
If you want to play it go play it it’s good
---
Happens every time there's a controversy. It's smart, less death threats that way. Shame the video game community is so toxic :(
---
Lol. Nothing will change. They might give everyone that bought the game before FO1st release 500 atoms and 1 month free subscription. That is it
---
Hey, don't you be disrepecting my David S. Pumpkins suit like that
---
Also there's more stuff you can get from Nuclear Winter, and even though most if not all of the things are recycled stuff from Creation Club, it's still technically new. And free.
---
IF IF you buy the service it costs $13 a month...that is cheap. The year service equates to about .27 cents a day. Are you kidding me OP.
---
You seem upset. Try playing a decent game like outer worlds to mix in a little sweet with all that sour
---
I find it so insane that there are STILL people defending this money grubbing behaviour of 76.  So many amazing games out there, like the one you've chosen, that give you everything you'd want in a game for no addition fees or subscriptions (and function as intended).  Sad to see, really.
---
"The first step towards change is awarness. The second step is acceptance." Welcome to the rational side.
---
Death threats are no bueno, this whole circumstance isnt great, but death threats over a video game are absurd
---
Remember those dudes that say 'any publicity is good publicity'? Yea. They were wrong. This is negative publicity in comparison to a black hole.
---
yep, as someone who has all the trophies and every plan learned, all that i've done the past fee months (when i decide to play) is go to the places with high level enemies, kill them, collect any thing worth selling, then sell it. considering i can since the cap limit is 30k and i basically sit on it due to lack of content/purchases being available in people's shops/the train stations. nuclear winter is still plagued with some people who glitched mutations from the start of the match, regardless, boring and if youre a melee player, good luck because the atks usually miss due to connections between the players (or the server in general)
---
lol sorry all the neg posting has me paranoid and thinking they're *all* astroturfers
---
TLDR
---
Pete Hines literally said there will never be a subscription model and the atom shop will be cosmetic only. Bethesda renegged on that promise.
---
1a. Yes.
---
2a. Hit "T" when in the vending machine to cycle the view.
---
Fuggin snowflakes...
---
Depends on if they're literate or not on basic reality. Remember, you're the one who tried to use "ape" as a derogation.
---
Why would I walk up to some random person and call them an ape? I'm an ape, but not a stupid ape.
---
I always build for the space.
---
If you’re building on a blank slate, don’t be afraid to be “busy” with lots of things close to each other. 
---
I generally find I am happier with my camps when I have a “theme” and use it to also constrain / direct what I’m doing - often it’s from the space I’m in as well.
---
It does show what you have in other machines, but what’s in other machines are greyed out. What’s in the machine you’re looking in will be bright and shown at the top of the list.
---
Yes, you learn mods by scrapping weapons and armor.
---
OP is fine with being a tool and being viewed as a tool, mad tight.
---
No. Rockstar games is a leader in the gaming industry and they have loot boxes ins RDR2 and GTA online. The leaders aren’t changing they just get smarter and give what the people want (for money). All in though it’s a video game, for god sake go outside and have fun with life if a video game gets you this fucked up.
---
Damn bro never spent a cent for atoms
---
You want a billion dollar company to offer us the chance to pay to fix their game..so they can sell it back to us because they do not want to put the money in themselves?
---
Has anyone seen any evidence this game is not making money, other than Bethesda is obviously wanting to make more money from it.
---
 Fucking incel.
---
Whatever you have to tell yourself
---
For the low, low price of $100 a year you can have access to a private* server with nothing but AstroTurf for as far as the eye can see
---
I don't know about him, but I did. Nothing made me lose my scrap no matter what I did, so I think it's safe to say it's usuable again and you can now go back to playing the game Fallout-4-style (read: taking everything in the world that isn't nailed down)
---
Yes it will be free.
---
Astroturf is outer this worlds
---
Neat, me too.
---
I love playing it cuz I still havent run out of stuff to do and havent even seen alot of secret places on the map I spent 30 dollars on the game all dlc has been free I didnt expect private servers to be free most games charge for that the stuff they have added that people say is pay to win is far from it the stuff u buy on black ops 4 is pay to win not this stuff which it's easy as hell to get atoms to pay for skins and stuff in the atom shop the battle royale is fun as hell and pretty rewarding that's y I play there is plenty of fun to be had
---
Played it today!
---
I could care less if I get downvoted, but who really gives a shit about this new subscription. If you don't like it then don't get it, its not pay to win. I'm not getting it, and I'm doing just fine. Lol what's the big deal!!!!!!!! I haven't gotten thrown out or glitched out of a server or whatever in a couple months. I think Bethesda is improving the gameplay of this game way more than people think. Yes it lacks in content, but that's fallout for you. I don't play it as much since shadowkeep and now outer worlds, but I still play it every now and then and have fun. Downvote me you fuckers I'm still playing this game.
---
It's because we've been told since the first teaser announcement that there would never be a subscription model and the atom shop would be cosmetic only
---
You Earn it.
---
You Burn it.
---
Literacy has nothing to do with it. You claim to be a "smart ape" well possibly, but you certainly are an "inept ape."
---
*You monster* D:
---
My prediction, within the next year legendary weapons will be in the atomic shop, some will complain....others will defend it because you can earn legendaries in the game.
---
Not really. People on reddit are choosing to be here.
---
Legitimate polling is *random*
---
It's easy to get sucked into buying more once you buy a few. They know this, that's why they tempt people to look at the atom store items at every available opportunity. You can't even build objects in your C.A.M.P. without seeing items that you don't have access to, and you can't even log into the game without seeing advertisements for the weekly atom store sales. They give you a few free atoms to get you into the habit of going into the store to "buy" stuff and from there it's real easy and tempting to reach for your credit card and buy a few more. Then they give you the option to save your credit card info so you can buy them again with just a few mouse clicks.
---
It's a terrible business practice and I feel bad for supporting it when I already knew better. I am taking this opportunity to re-affirm my commitment not to play games that include micro-transactions. I don't mind paying for some expansions or some DLC but I draw the line at games that ask you to put your credit card information into the game interface itself. If they want to sell downloadable crap they should at least have the decency to do it at the original point of sale and not within the game itself.
---
Exactly, they have shown Bethesda that they could sell them poo at 1000 a pop and people will line up and  buy them before bitching that poo are poo.
---
See SOE and Star Wars Galaxies
---
Quit being a broke ass and sell some shit.
---
Again, polling done right uses random population selection for polling.
---
I think you may have a problem with you amount of spending, maybe consider the end of line atomic stuff as crap that you should not be buying. Lol. But you have probably single handed kept the game going for us and I thank you. You should hav a years free subscription for your contribution...well done
---
😂 this sub is a joke. You literally felt the need to post this? Insecure much? 😂
---
Btw I uninstalled FO76 and played Outer World's for 6 straight hours. Do I get a spanking now?
---
I've been playing the game since it came out and the only, ONLY time I have seen the Flatwoods Monster, he was already dead at Camp Venture. Definitely going to use this, thanks!
---
You're entitled to play it, but it is worth pointing out in a public way that the way they've handled this release is causing them to lose longtime fans.
---
The problem with first is that instead of adding content/improving the complaints the fanbase has had for months, they're loving anticipated content behind a monthly subscription in a game that people already paid for.
---
Sunken Cost Fallacy, that's the answer.
---
Oh cool that makes me happy.
---
Can I have your stuff? I mean it’s not like you’ll ever come back to play so let someone who loves the game have at it, right?
---
Before you second guess yourself and decide talk might come back one day or why let someone else who enjoys it benefit from all your hard work - I mean, don’t be Bethesda. You can spread the love where there would otherwise be none. 
---
I’ve been playing MMO’s since Everquest 0. Everything cost. Monthly fees for an entire game that was called Everquest because you could never finish any of the quests. Still had fun. 
---
“Balanced” Micro transactions and “cosmetic only” digital rewards for preordering or paying a premium price so those who can’t afford it won’t cry was a mistake to begin with. 
---
Of course people who pay should get more. Duh. Make servers for those who can’t play and let those who like to pay to win compete against each other. Why not? At least being on a different server with everyone else who wants to play for free off the backs of those who do would only be competing against equals. Right? Spoiler: They’d still complain. 
---
I love FO76. The only mistake was promising a quality bag (as a preorder bonus? Nuff sed.) and giving away a plastic one. By the way, since then I’ve gotten the bag I want even if it was delayed. 
---
Quests are broken? Nothing as bad as what I’ve been through. You could lose an entire character, not just a +1 Broadsword. 
---
Are haters gonna hate what I’ve shared? Sure. Just like I hate hearing people complain about a game I like very much. The only MMO I’ve subscribed to since the disappointment Skyrim turned into. So you stop playing to show your disappointment, 100 more who aren’t take your place. 
---
So before you leave, don’t hate the player who has a great time after you go. Spread the love by sharing your hard work for future generations of players. Just like I’ll do when I’m done playing it.
---
Stop comment karma whoring a silently downvote it
---
Lol I'm breaking from 20 games but I don't post about it.
---
That’s why I stopped playing. I can’t stand feeling like I’m wasting my time.
---
Roasted.
---
Paintball gun now weights 250 pounds lol
---
wow so brave!
---
Missing the context much? “Why should I care what you think” is not “angrily posting”. It’s saying “why should I care that other people don’t like this game”. I play the game for myself, not them. The “social mechanics” of other people moaning has no relevance on me enjoying the game. You managed to miss the entire point if the statement, cudos.
---
Just keep playing around with it and mess around with different shapes. I had tons of practice from fallout 4, so mine is pretty cool for a low level.
---
I thought I'd be able to shorthand scientific literacy for you. It's a thing.  The second part of the term ' literacy' is competence or knowledge in a specific area. It's not just your ability to read or right.
---
\&gt;imagine enjoying fo76  
---
i literally cant
---
You should be fine, but if it's a good investment ia entirely up to you. Also while I can't force you I do ask you to not fall for the anti consumer practices that they're peddling.
---
I’ll see if that works
---
There is nothing wrong with liking a "bad" game, I have my share of games I like that people would call bad. But the problem is the issue with 76 extends beyond just a bad game.
---
Claim workshops to get plans
---
Xbox live tricks me every month lol
---
Bruh if you got it for free, go right ahead, play around with it, have fun, game isn't as buggy as launch, and fallout 1st ain't required, just try and have fun with it and if you like it, good for you, if not, s'all good
---
Who told you that? That's obviously not true
---
Friend I'm fully aware it still has nothing to do with that. What do you not get?
---
Oh I know exactly what they’re doing, I just can’t be tricked like that I guess. I’ve never payed for anything that wasn’t major Dlc like Breath of the Wild’s dlc, but cosmetics are a fool’s errand. Real money for virtual items is ridiculous. Furthermore Bethesda are foul scum bags for how they’ve treated us from day one! But I will never fall for their tricks!
---
I've been playing for a few weeks now and I'm up to lv 60 and haven't finished the main story.  I definitely think there's a hearty amount of grind to the game, but I honestly don't think Bethesda would do something so catastrophically dumb as to wipe your entire account.  (I hope they don't prove me wrong.)
---
I agree, there really should just be an offline mode. The subscription for private worlds though I'm not to against, would prefer being able to host servers myself.
---
Agreed. I don't like the sub service but sending death threats to the devs is a bitch move
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about that. That's something definitely makes me think twice.
---
I know right? But i guess they are doing some sort of sale on the game this week.
---
Yeah, I recognize that I have a problem with spending money in platforms like this. Of course, I also recognize that the game itself is designed to push all of the psychological buttons that encourage this kind of spending. I also spent way more money than I should have in Path of Exile, but at least that developer has the basic decency to actually limit their store items to cosmetic only stuff.
---
There are probably a lot of other users like me. I make good money every month and I didn't bankrupt myself by spending nearly $400 on this. People who spend a lot of money on things like this are embarrassed to come here and admit it because they know they will be shamed and criticized by other players, but Bethesda has access to the sales figures. They know exactly what they are doing and frankly it is wrong.
---
Hey now, don't he disrepecting my pipe guns like that
---
SLOW CLAP 👏

To the new players: welcome, I hope it enjoy the game. I played it for such a long time and got burned out waiting for the new content only for them to renege on their promise to provide free updates and lock the ability to play in a private server (the only place mods will be allowed) behind a monthly subscription
---
Karma system will make a return. The more nukes you launch in populated places, the lower your karma. They’ll introduce ways to get flux in game without the need for nukes, leading to more choice. 
---
And hopefully dog companions that follow you around.
---
Do you have Speed Demon?
---
7000 upvotes ona  sub 207,000  strong
---
Nah, I wouldn't take this low effort topic as anything important.
---
This would really cross the line, I dont see that happening.
---
Agreed. This whole “protect the dumb fucks blowing $100 on garbage” mentality is horrible. They keep enabling this garbage and then don’t want their feelings hurt by smart people haha
---
Same. I've been playing the outer worlds for 6 hours straight now. Later Bethesda. I hope it hits you in the pocket books
---
Would be cool to see busts of Chairmen Cheng, President Xin and General Jingwei.
---
Yeah I got it for 30 and got tons of gameplay.
---
Check other CAMPS for cheap plans to build up your options.  Hit up the free stuff in the store when it comes around.  Don't be afraid to steal other people's ideas.  Keep in mind the level 15 ppl might be on their second character.  And like /u/voodoogroves says, pack it in tight.  Think IKEA showroom.  Oh, and try to incorporate the landscape into your plans.  Looks cooler if it's not obviously just plopped down in place.
---
Happened to me as well with Pacifist on; lost so much flux.
---
Nothing?
---
Ok now I know this whole post is just bait.
---
Carefully he's a hero
---
So, you're saying you want multiple millions of dollars worth of effort for free. 
---
And it's not like you're even being locked out of anything. People who choose not to pay just miss the ability to control who they play with. 
---
A strong majority of these complaints are tantrums and brigades plain and simple. 
---
P.S. A subscription model is like Runescape, you have ZERO access to 80% of the quests, equipment, skills and abilities without the monthly fee. 
---
FO76 is literally just like a magazine subscription where you get monthly bonuses. If you want extra goodies, you pay.
---
They're talking about the falloutfirst.com
---
I am on PC, but I don't have those roller balls in the stash either. And I don't use mods.
---
No,if they gain monetary success from this crap they'll have no reason to do anything else. Plus when a new game comes out they can just do the exaxt same practices knowing full well that some people will still buy their crap.

---
I didnt have to imply anything lol
---
[r/PKOA/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKOA/) is also a fairly nice '76 place to hang out.
---
This is a great bit. Start making suggestions to make the pay pigs pay even more hahaha lil bit of sabotage
---
r/fo76filthycasuals. I'm pretty sure you can still "criticize" the game there, they just don't allow outright bashing and stuff.
---
Because it just got featured on one of the biggest news organizations on the planet perhaps?
---
I didn't get hours of entertainment, I got hours of mediocrity and boredom and once I ran out of mildly interesting locations and items I realized theres barely any real content in the game, it's a horder's walking simulator where you read notes, look at neat buildings, make a house and try to get the coolest looking gear.
---
Preach

Find the .50 cal plans for it. Can make a ton of ammo and has the best damage.

Let's take a look at what the word "private" means, as per [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/private).
---
&gt;intended for or restricted to the use of a particular person, group, or class
---
Private servers in this context are both intended for and restricted to the use of a particular person.
---
&gt;belonging to or concerning an individual person, company, or interest
---
Private servers, again, both belong to and concern an individual person.
---
So yes, they are indeed private servers. Just because something does not fit the colloquial meaning of a phrase 1:1 does not mean it is not just that. 
---
As I said in response to someone else: Bethesda is not wholely innocent in this. They could have explained what they meant better and prevented this miscommunication. But they have not lied and fulfilled exactly what they said. Just because people expected something that was not explicitly promised does not give right to outrage. It's artificial.
---
Sarcasm or genuine?
---
Bethesda could do right by giving everyone unlimited stashes AND the ability to craft repair kits.  Let people who want private servers pay for private servers like Minecraft.  I understand charging for that.
---
Jesus christ, it's been a year and people are *still* going on about that? Even after the replacements were sent out? That's not even what the bloody edition was for!
---
Can confirm. The eyebot is unkillable
---
Paying to get cancer is literally putting cancer on life support. Players definitely deserve the blame.
---
Thanks! Will check it out
---
Yeah. Why would Bethesda want Fallout1st.com when they didn’t even care about Fallout76.com? They own a website already.
---
you need to understand your actions are affecting the wider industry. every time some slack wit hands over money for trash like this they just get emboldened. please stop helping to destroy the industry we all love
---
I was upvote 666 mahahaha
---
I'm sure you can find Discord roleplay servers of Fallout where you could find ppl to help you, with sometimes good debates. I am myself on one of them (French one), basically everyone gives his pov without judgements or hate
---
Aye, I have 2 machines of camp plans in the Toxic Valley at 5c each.
---
That doesn’t even make sense, and I’m not sure you understand what’s being talked about here.
---
Any idea where I can find them?
---
Welcome to the community man try to ignore the crazies getting mad about the game at the moment
---
It does or doesn't depending on the person or context. If hsve to disagree
---
Lawd... ME TOO!!! That beeping is so aggravating!
---
We went in and killed every ghoul first last night, and then dropped a nuke, and it worked great.  Consider that you're killing the ghouls with a nuke.
---
It does not at all haha they look like they’re getting dumber
---
Yes, and I’ve had it for probably 10 months without curing it lol
---
Yeah there's no need for a separate website, but the point in securing these domains is to prevent things like these from happening. They want to make sure nothing negative is related to the titles of content they release. Just like you said, fallout 76 website isn't a thing right? Bethesda owns the fallout 76 website but they don't use it because there's no need to. The only point is to prevent other people from using it
---
Some things weigh less as bulk, but it is mainly used to sell at vendors or to other players.
---
You know you've hit a list of some kind if the local BBC office is calling you for a comment.
---
oh u guys will have your new fallout/elder scrolls game, it will just be using fo76 as base for what they can squeeze out of their player bases.
---
So you don't put it in the scrapbox by accident and it fucks off into oblivion.
---
Really though you save some weight (on specific materials such as steel and lead, don't waste you plastic on much else). Also you can sell it to vendors if bulked.
---
It’s been a while, but I think I bought mine at the Camden park bot.

Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I’ve nuked Grafton. The mayor was unaffected. But there is a fair amount of violet flux to be had.
---
I've noticed. Everytime I go to repair my power armor I'm out of fucking plastic lmfao
---
It's the only way to sell it to the robots.
---
Fallout 3 was strike 1, Fallout 4 was Strike 2, Fallout 76 was strike 76. I'm never buying a Bethesda developed game again.
---
Is that really worth doing? I usually stockpile junk and stuff
---
yup, i could vote with my wallet by not buying them, but if just 2 people purchase said bad idea, well, it just tells the company that there are people who will buy into it.
---
a fool and his money are easily separated
---
Lol really? Is there any official 76 domain or is it just like bethesda.com/fo76 ?
---
Looking at your level I'd suggest hitting up morgantown high school for plastic.
---
why did they show it if not in the pack?
---
Pleeeeease let this guy be the mediator. Please let him sit down with Todd. I trust no one more to represent my voice, including anyone in congress.
---
Bravo
---
Give your firstborn to bethesda too you cucks
---
Sunk cost fallacy and/or just bad taste.
---
I've never bothered. It's just easier to sell of clothes, weapons aid items. It's just how some people like to do it.
---
Genuine 
---
People shouldn't try to use reddit topics are the voice of a community.
---
LOL... Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me... fool me 100 times, shame on Bethesda...
---
Seems like they got rid of the greyed our lines in favor of a filter button as of this last patch.
---
So now we have evidence that the general market for that game is either ignorant of sleazy practices or just don't care. Either way, it's not a good outcome.
---
They playing outerworlds
---
yes there are western revolvers in the game and they hit harder than the other ones.
---
"Whadaya, think ya smart?"
---
I've heard it referred to as "Yelp for boomers" and I just can't find a way to prove that wrong.
---
Atleast obsidion got there 85 review score
---
I did that a while ago. Trust me, you won't miss it.
---
Man should not have to do that....
---
lol, it looks good though.
---
This. Even if you don’t plan to use the domain you should buy it just in case of the off chance that your business model is a blatant predatory swindling that is so obvious it inspires someone to spend 1/6 of the cost of your service for the sole purpose of Trolling the absolute shit out of your model, costing you potentially hundreds of subscriptions in bad publicity.
---
If they gave away the scrapbox &amp; extra camp i wouldnt need to subscribe because all my friends have private servers i can hop on
---
You’ll find the circlejerk you seek.
---
Truthfully the fridge ain't even worth it. Can Only Hold 15 items and they're not stackable
---
You... you're literally proving the post right by trying to make me regret subscribing...
---
I agree man I hope it gets better
---
That doesn't seem to be what people who actually have tested that theory are finding, despite Bethesda claiming otherwise. https://youtu.be/Icq3GSet4c0?&amp;t=10m
---
People like you handing over money like this is going to give other developers bad ideas that's why everyone is pissed. You are rewarding a company that is taking the piss out of you to an insane level and quite rightly people are mocking you for it.
---
I do not believe there is an official Fallout76 Domain. I looked for it and it did not load anything. They don’t need it and with social media who really cares about trying to suppress bad press.
---
They told us private servers were gunna be a thing, but didn't say a word about it being behind a pay wall, and they blatantly lied about the stash limit being a hardware limitation.  So there's two.
---
What are the other bugs?  I've only heard of the "lost scrap" bug.
---
Good.
---
I just did standard again and nothing
---
This! I grabbed it the first time it dropped to $40 (which was alarmingly soon after when it released) and I think ONE more good fuckup on their part, and I will have gotten my money's worth just from the spectacle. 
---
I'm not even upset anymore; I knew about the launch difficulties but got to try the beta and had a good enough time, so I bought it. But now? I'm just in disappointed and amused awe every time I see another F76-related headline.
---
I'll give them 3 months until the next – I can give at least SOME good faith.
---
you played the best, now try the rest!
---
You see any $20 race options, $50 bank access, or $100 mansions? I don't. Also in that game they don't allow you to earn the currency, it's all cash only. Plus they changed the name from DLC to Chapters so they could get out of giving it away with the subscription. It's cool though, you won't respond to this lol
---
Keep on playing a broken game. I'm sure you'd eat up a premium membership on top of this one and make another excuse
---
Not really. They didn’t buy Fallout76.com and put anything there. That may have been a good practice in the 90s before social media was prevalent, but it’s a pointless exercise now.
---
I suspect they didn’t care and you all are just delusional about getting one up on Bethesda.
---
Lol u are right lol
---
I want some pipe gun skins already!
---
It would be impossible to implement after the fact it was a massive change to the games code. In 76 the world is instanced and you move through it. In Fo4 the world moves around your character, when things go out of sight they cease to exist, unlike 76. That $60 single (which is actually $33) is 4 times larger and has more quests then all of Fo4. Iv been playing since beta and i still havent explored the entire map
---
This really bothers me, because it reflects the state of the gaming industry today. All these excessive new reasons to sell you things little by little, on top of the base game you already purchased. And it’s causing game producers to push out games and preorders long before they’re even ready for the public. I feel like it’s a great time to revisit older games
---
Id agree with that initial stamens if it were still 1998.
---
Hah all good.
---
They wouldn't buy it to use it per say, companies normally buy the related domains and redirect to their main sites as a way to both funnel traffic to the right place and also (more importantly) to protect their brand(s) from this exact thing (or say a competitor redirecting it to their own site).
---
This game is fun as fuck. Grindy as all  hell but that's to be expected from an MMO but yeah I've only been playing a little while but following a bit and itll pass I'm sure, people just need a chance to calm down. If you ignore it, it goes away. I'll be fine without wasting anymore of my money.
---
That’s a little rude don’t you think? The other answer about people not being able to buy the domain is correct, the pr nightmare that this user mentioned is the result of Bethesda not buying the domain.
---
Essentially the same answer, just worded very differently.
---
At the same time it's hurtful. A lot of us are rational, angry or upset and want answers or a change. Silence is an answer in its own right and not a good one.
---
if you dont have your water purifiers or resource nodes locked they can take whats in there. but they can take your purified water and lead while your gone and once you return it will already be replenished

Lmao, I don’t have to make an excuse for I was happy to do. Like I literally could give too fucks about some guy guilt tripping me about a game I enjoy and how I spent a measly 12 on said game to make myself happy. I find it a little weird your so butthurt about the fact people enjoy this game and their purchases. It’s pretty cringy tbh.
---
I feel the same as you. Preordered at full price, played the SERVER STRESS TEST (yes, I’m pulling rank on all the BETA players), never quit even in the dark ages before wild appalachia (again flexing my dedication) and THIS is the debacle that finally made me say “fuck this bullshit”, tired of always sticking up for Bethesda’s predatory monetization because there’s a fantastic open world with great combat and mechanics that just needs NPCs and a story. Not a $100 premium subscription that would get you a 19 year old blonde shoving raw vegetables up her ass on Snapchat any day of the week for 1/3 of the price.
---
Not worth keeping it. Lots of great games coming up!
---
Just hang on, all this shit will blow over.  But know this subreddit will always have something to complain about.  It just happens to be this right now.  
---
Honestly, I can figure out why everyone is so stuck on this subscription issue.  There were some major bugs that still haven't been addressed or crash issues they could at least bandaid till they come out with a real fix.
---
Uh oh, the only other game company I know of that had a former baseball player calling shots didnt do so hot.
---
No I don’t think it’s rude at all. Maybe you’re just a little too sensitive for online discussions.
---
He can't intend to profit off the site, otherwise they could sue him for the website due to cybersquatting. Him simply making a parody website on the other hand is legal and legit.

Bethesda is a joke now. They dont care about anything other than money. It wont get better. Hope is a lie. Have the fun you can. Sure. But dont feed the problem. I for one am done. I cant even bring myself to keep playing it. I feel gross. The Bethesda that once was is dead. Don't hurt yourself by think it will get better. It wont. I love fallout and elder scrolls. This whole thing. A logical outlook on the future of these franchises, is depressing.
---
You can still use the bulk items when crafting correct?
---
Avellone didn't work on Outer Worlds, he left Obsidian in 2015.
---
I got 5 characters my dude. besides the fuckery happening right now its a fun fallout game thats missing an impact site like the glowing sea
---
Yes, if you don't have scrap pieces it breaks a bulk into pieces.
---
Yongeyea made his name by being outraged. Now it's all he has, hard to take anything he says without a grain of salt.
---
+1 I pre-ordered based on having really enjoyed FO4 despite its shortcomings. The Skyrim re-release was my 1st experience with it and I loved it, so I was mistakenly confident in this studio who have greatly damaged the Fallout brand and their reputation in glorious fashion this year. 
---
I’ve barely played. Maybe a full hour I’ve put into it. I keep waiting for Wastelanders or to just read something positive for a change but - holy shit. It’s just one dumpster fire after another with this shit show.

They screw up ES6 and they will crumble.
---

---
They wouldn’t have made this move if they weren’t worried for the future of the game. It’s bleeding cash. The game was a commercial flop and trying to recoup the money through extremely average cosmetics isn’t cutting it. Keeping servers on for a large open world online game is expensive. I think this move is more of a signal of the end than anything. They’re desperate for cash.
---
how about you stop buying into dogshit and ruin it for everyone?
---
The Reddit community doesn't actually represent the active F76 community. They're much nicer as a whole.
---
How do i cancel it, it doesnt show up in my xbox subscriptions like live or game pass
---
You asked a question and got answers. You are shutting all of these answers down despite them being correct. It doesn’t matter that it isn’t 1998, being thorough with domain purchasing is still a thing. It doesn’t matter if social media exists if google is directing people to the farce website more than the real one.
---
Lol explaing why buying a domain to protect somebody for not doing something like they did is a good thing  is apparently us being delusional and trying to get a one up on Bethesda according to the other guy in the thread
---
Exactly the same with me.
---
Wishful thinking. Bethesda's shown nothing to indicate that they will do any better with any other game in future.
---
If anything, they're shown a downward trend in quality since Skyrim's peak and a upward trend in monetisation and anti-consumer practices.
---
What proof does this have anything to do with placating investors. Before you answer, don't mention Luke Stephen's name. He's provably shown to be a person of low credibility, no more credible than any other person with an internet theory on here.
---
I hope you stand by that! That's the right attitude to have. Never buy any product before reading reviews.
---
I applaud your resolve and your will-power. I don't have that kind of resiliency in these situations so I am opting to just avoid them. There are plenty of other games I can play that will only ask for my money once.
---
Hell, I wouldn't even mind paying a monthly fee to play a game if it didn't have micro-transactions. It's crazy to me that they want to charge $60 for the game, charge money for cosmetics, and then charge an additional $100 a year on top of all that for quality-of-life features that should just be in the base game for everyone.
---
Youre a lame ass cckhold that supports this shit game.  Youre bethasda's btch and should be ashamed.

True, but that means he is also on top of it and uploads about new news quickly. I wouldn't have known about Bethesda's response til the day after otherwise. The article with Bethesda's response was updated revealing the scrap box was truly broken in the middle of him filming.
---
My preferred channel for gaming news is [Pretty Good Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodK-9eXEm_hWSDDfLr4QzA), but they probabaly won't have anything about this til their Saturday podcast.
---
&gt;but I don’t want to be part of it. Does this type of discussion even exist anywhere at the moment?
---
Nah, not really. They have a specific rule about bashing and negativity. If it's perceived as negative, no matter how based in fact you may be, your post/comment will be removed. Seen it first hand for comments that'd barely bat an eyelid here.
---
fl4k
---
To watch this fucking trainwreck, definitely has entertained me the last few days
---
It is getting very sad. So long as Nintendo stays true I’ll keep the faith, but I’m afraid of what’s coming when it all goes to gaming as a service. It could be great just a small fee gets you access to every game would be awesome... unless every game uses tactics like this to trick people.
---
Ultimate karma whore response
---
Whoa there, let’s not bring logic into this.
---
I mean you don't have to believe me but companies do this all the time. If your game franchise was under theawakening.com and your sequel was "The Awakening Two" and you wanted to put it on the original website, you'll still claim theawakeningtwo.com just so someone doesn't put rape porn or something demeaning to the company's image. It's pretty basic business practices to claim domains directly related to your product, but sure man whatever.
---
Hehe foreshadowing

---
Well. Revenge on the game for kicking me out of a legendary scorchbeast fight. Shall not allow advertising in game.
---
.38 is a downgrade.
---
What kind of games do you mean? Rpg (try outer world's, much better than FO76), looter shooter (borderlands 3 is 100x the game FO76 is), live service game (ESO is still decent, destiny new expansion is amazing for new or returning players). 
---
There's a lot to choose from with far better business practices than FO76.
---
I'm level 330 and 80. There *is* nothing I need to be progressing other than chasing the perfect legendary set (which I CBA with) and the final few illusive plans. Which I also don't really do. I log on, mess around having fun for a while and log off. I didn't quit any other fallout games the moment I finished the main quest. Same here.
---
In the last 7 weeks I've been given 3500 atoms. Tonight I got 40. Checked the challenges the moment I logged on. Crafted 10 things. Killed 5 things. Levelled up (while I did some dailies, helped some low levels and made a halloween themed camp for my own enjoyment) wearing the right outfit combo. That's all I did towards atoms. I could have gone into the vault for another 10 atoms or server hopped to find the flatwoods alien but I didn't. That would have doubled my tally for tonight. A reward for extra effort; that sounds totally reasonable even if I didn't get it and somebody else will have. I don't have an entitlement to those atoms - i didn't earn them and that's totally fine.
---
I have to say you've got some massive assumptions about the scavenger protectron based on 1 pre-release trailer that shows the back of a bot pod. You don't know what that was meant to be. Was probably a camp guard that was broken and taken out the game.
---
Also, I have nothing to do with people spending $100 on this game. I just said above I get free atoms. You can direct your anger elsewhere because you're arguing with the wrong person - that's nothing to do with me. I'm really annoyed that some other players have unlimited paid-for stash space and I don't. That is specifically what I'm annoyed about. Not the bot. Not the terrible repair kits. #CashForStash.
---
Can we get a response from [u/BethesdaGameStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_/) on why they thought this was going to be a great idea? I think all these great gamers have a right to know. Bethesda, you need to be more transparent at this point, your lossing/ lost all your fans!
---
No worries, be well.
---
I don’t know you, you don’t know me... How much do you make a year?
---
They shot themselves in the foot, and then shot all of their toes off.
---
Why?
---
Patch 14?  I didn't recall seeing that in the notes, my bad
---
I mean, it all depends. If Bethesda’s next game is exclusively a single player RPG, I’m going to give it a month before trusting it but would ultimately buy it. If it’s anything else, I won’t even give it a chance. They’ve ruined their reputation, and anything that’s not Fallout 5 or TES 6 I don’t trust to not be pumped full of Microtransactions.
---
I don't mind there being a subscription service just for private worlds but all that other stuff locked behind a paywall that players have requested as improvements for the game for many months is just bs.
---
No matter how pleased you are with your camp you will move it.   It is half the fun.

because developers purposly make their games worse in order it sell you the cure.   We've seen this since the start of this generation with the first forza game, where they nerfed rate you earned or could buy cars then sold money to buy said cars, they later walked it back but they still tried.  We have assassin's creed oddysey that nerfed exp rates in order to sell time savers from just their previous game.  We saw it in shadow of war, though that was still playable, they still made it a chore to get through some parts if you didn't spend real life money.
---
It's not just, okay X game has MTX or loot boxes, but when they then gear the game in such a way it tries to force you into buying them, or be ready for a tedious grind.  Bad enough with cosmetic, but we see this with games that arn't cosmetic.  IN the cases above sure you could get all those things withotu spending money, but the time to do so was tediously long in some cases.  In forza's case to get a car you could spend 100$'s you would have to do like 50 races and get first place every time, and with around 100 cars of that vlaue...you can see the problem.

Was this a request from shareholders or executives? Are you bleeding money from this project and need more to try to make it right? I think we deserve an answer and soon!
---
Wait they will respawn.  Fresh kills.   Also, if you get kicked from a server, you are sent back to the same world automatically.    This becomes more meaningful when you have a couple of workshops claimed.
---
Yup you nailed it. Paying for servers is fine but locking quality of life changes behind a paywall is a joke.
---
Is this needed in any of the quest?
---
My advice would be to start small, like a 3x2 foundation.  Fill it up with detail everywhere.  If you start too big, it's hopeless to try to make it look dense.
---
Yeah everyone that says what people do with their money shouldn't be our concern, get back to us when elderscrolls is a shitshow train wreck because they learnt all the wrong lessons from fallout 76.
---
I'm enjoying it.   Especially being sent back to the same world if you leave unexpectedly
---
That would be much more fun than the rocket turrets. Especially if you could fire them yourself.
---
With the response that the OP has received throughout this thread, there never was, nor has been any "We" or "Fellow gamers" involved.  
---
People are fundamentally deranged to the point wherein they think its remotely okay to harass, threaten or otherwise belittle someone for spending money on a hobby which they enjoy. They're causing strife, grief and disparity where it never should be.  
---
It's all the more ironic when one considers that almost everyone has some sort of unhealthy spending habit. Be it on video games with microtransations or lootboxes, or any subscription fee available throughout a myriad of services, to the lesser noticeable as twice a day expensive starbucks visits.
---
It is going to be free.
---
&gt; But do we have to attack them for it? 
---
Really depends on what you mean by attack. Call them names and be mean to them, then no. 
---
However, criticise them? Yes, they're deserving of it. Politely of course but criticism all the same. They're enabling the dev's anti-consumer practices by rewarding them for it by paying for it. They are as much of a problem as Bethesda are when it comes to this issue.
---
We should focus our attention onto Bethesda, granted. The people who purchased the subscription aren't immune from criticism though.
---
100%
---
Chillest lads and lasses in Appalachia
---
$13 a month/$99 a year isn’t any where close to 1% territory
---
because 2 words, elderscrolls 6 will have some of this shit if people prove they will accept it, and I don't want to see one of my favorite series get screwed up.
---
3 is more timeless in my opinion.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals, actually
---
If they don't improve this product, considerably, Starfield WILL BE a critical whipping boy. Masterpiece or Not. It will be garbage. Could be the 2nd coming of Pac Man, but people will shit all over it. We're petty and more than a little entitled, but we're the customer and we're ALWAYS RIGHT.
---
Suddenly ES 6 comes out and isn't THE game people are waiting for anymore, say it's ok. Game Over. 
---
They want to be a Mega-Publisher, this is a fly in the ointment, whether they know it or not. I honestly have zero confidence in their beancounters, mickey mouse operation all the way.
---
I love their games, but their business sense is fucking horrendous.
---
Weekly challenges
---
Yeah nv is for people who like fallout and 76 is for people who like spending 200$ a year to wear costumes, pick up cow poop and play house
---
Baahahahaha, oh man I've had that one a number of times. I found myself yelling into the mic a couple of times cause of that.
---
Awesome. Very good to know. Thanks
---
LOL. Board meeting deciding on monetising skins. That's funny :)
---
I'm looking forward to new 4k food and water textures pack :)
---
If your FOMO is costing you hundred of dollars every month in a video game, you probably need therapy.
---
16x the retail!
---
what planet are you on?   Many of the games with the worst microtransactions have been some of the shittiest, content lacking games this generation, and it's gotten worse as the generation has progressed.
---
Didn’t trump just do this to joe Biden?
---
It probably will be fixed in F1 mode at some point
---
And you get to keep the robot. Should have bought a pack work 3000 atoms and asked for a refund
---
Bofors to the rescue!
---
POOM POOM POOM POOM
---
Flak mod for the Broadsider maybe? Finally make it useful lmao
---
👏👏
---
Yeah, I’m not gonna play for a little while. I enjoy the game tho.
---
There is not caring. I couldn't care less
---
\^what he said.
---
A therapist's solution would probably be, "just don't play that game." I mean the game is specifically engineered to tempt people into spending that kind of money. If I had a gambling problem, the solution would be "don't go to the casino." This is a similar situation.
---
I make enough money at work that this kind of expense is no big deal, I mean it's not like I'm making minimum wage and spending so much money on this that I can't pay my rent or whatever. That doesn't mean it is a good use of my money, though.
---
So I don't condone harassing anyone but I doubt I will ever see the modified NCR Ranger outfit the same way ever again.   
---

---
I would never say something rude and insulting to another game but I am bewildered at the thought of people buying this subscription.  This is why Bethesda will continue to fuck us with these practices.
---
take my upvote
---
Man, Anthem. Played it through Origin access, which I have for the sims don't judge. I didn't buy it and expected nothing but I was still disappointed.
---
You laugh but he's hitting the nail on the head, give them an inch and then they'll ram you with a mile long dildo
---
You’ve obviously haven’t worked in the web space boot licker. Enjoy your stash box items vanishing into the void.
---
If you go through the store to the page for it, there should be an option to end the subscription (at least when I last checked). I also saw something about some Manage Subscription page.
---
I agree completely that it will cross the line, but at this point it would not surprise me at all.
---
a strangely glowing phosphorous seaweed in the cold ocean of reception under the dark night when the stars dont shine
---
Same goes for open source commercial vendors. Haha
---
I only do it for stuff like glass.
---
Oh I understand that too. 
---
There was always a basic element of Runescape that spoke to me, that I enjoyed, even as everything else went to shit around it tbh.
---
It's hilarious how the people against this have turned into irrational, insane loons.
---
Who knows, but how long will it last if there's no revenue?
---
I laughed so hard reading that site.  I can't remember the last time I laughed that hard.
---
Aren't 2 shot explosive legendaries basically flak guns.
---
Exactly, OP.  Exactly.
---
The more plans you know, the more likely you get screwed, because there is not a "re-roll" if you get a plan you already know.  
---
Short version is there is not a check before it picks which Plan to assign, just a check right before it's assigned to determine if you have it.  
---
Added and Submitted the bug
---
as opposed to the circlejerk here?
---
18 dollars for a blue tint.
---
He's right, and you probably paid for multiple things that price. That bugs me.
---
People keep saying shareholders as if there are any. There aren't. Investors and partners, sure but they don't work the same way as shareholders. Shareholders would own Bethesda. Right now Bethesda owns Bethesda, or at least a majority stake.
---
You should be mad about it.
---
Funny, because you're doing the same for Bethesda by defending this game lol.
---
For sale and for a couple of items, to save weight.
---
 The arrows over all the enemies heads and the weird crosshair nonsense. You don't see that?
---
yeah even if they say it won't be when they launch.  Cos oh yeah btw we reconsidered that position so now that thing we said we wouldn't do? Nah we're doing that now.
---
Hey old fart here, doing it since Pong.
---
Bugfree from day one huh? Half of Atari's library, was "broken garbage they shat into a box and charged 80 bux for." The quote is from Atari's CEO at the time. The King of the "Golden age of gaming" Glory days indeed.......
---
We got 1/10th of the stuff a game has now, If that.
---
We didn't get shitty DLC. No, they charged us for a FULL SEQUEL for that tiny sliver of new content. Asset flips a-go-go. One or two new mechanics, Gimme 80 bucks. No bugfixes either, it's broken? Tough shit. Truly halcyon days.
---
You're living in the 2nd Great age of Gaming, but there's too much salt on your rose tinted glasses to see it, sweety.
---
Because the video isn't even about that, its about the scumminess of the subscription service. He hasn't said shit about in game bugs.
---
Still haven't gotten their bonus from Bethesda.
---
Precisely. Glad you speak my language.
---
&gt; Anyone else feel similarly?
---
Ah, a voice of reason.
---
&gt; I don’t want any part of a game that requires a subscription to get access to game utilities.
---
On the other hand I'm completely fine paying additional money to host a server if it's handled correctly. Having played around with the private server files of other games hosting a server is not an inexpensive process depending on how the game is implemented, and if GameBryo is anything like I suspect I imagine the resource usage could be very high.
---
My plan has always been to wait for private servers to come out and subscribe to them. I've always known it would be paid and always expect $15/mo. That it's only $8.33/mo (bulk packaging) means I'm pleasantly surprised not disappointed like everyone else.
---
Kinda sounds like it's all games that have micro-transactions, though. 
---
Sounds to me like you're making excuses, but whatever floats your boat.
---
Sorry, the game doesn't hold your hand. Time to get smart about managing your resources.
---
[He Did!](https://todosconbiden.com/) And you have boot lickers who have obviously have never worked in the web space trying to tell me it’s not a big deal lol.
---
I've had two big glitches in the past 24 hours - both of which are new and not the typical ones I'm used to (sad, but fo76 has trained me to check my active quests before doing anything and log out if they aren't all displaying the right status).  Anyway, I was in the jail event last night (first time I did it) and my VATS wasn't focusing.  The VATS bar was full, i had my normal perks on, no mutations/diseases and using my sniper rifle and I wasn't getting focus on enemies.  I played most of the event using a manual zoom.  I've never seen anything like it.  Its better today but I haven't had the volume of enemies.  Then today, I leveled up and the perk I selected is not showing up.  I am hoping this is fixed the next time I login but honestly was so annoyed I figured I'll just wait until I decide to play again to check.  Ug!
---
For some reason, it sells better than the individual pieces from my vends. Idk, maybe people feel like they're getting more?  I can't explain it
---
Nice thanks for this. Wow on all the communist stuff. Been dieing for enclave or BOS stuff forever!
---
They can't or rather the stuff that's happened recently would be a cakewalk compared to the rage of going against the whole microtransactions funding the free DLC. You think people are livid now?
---
Cool, appreciated. I’m not concerned with their corporate structure and was using the term to denote executive leadership.
---
Already have
---
You have some companies that will listen to consumer feedback but for the most part the biggest thing they listen to is money. 
---
It's your money so you are obviously free to do with it as you please. But when you pay money for loot boxes or in this case a subscription for things that should have been included from the jump you've cosigned predatory practices. And that's whether you like it or not. Doing these type of things gives companies the green light to continue to do it. 
---
The reason you have players coming at you in a very toxic manner is that they are more likely to change your mind/be persuaded than Bethesda. Because let's be real this game wouldn't have been subjectively shit for a whole year if they did listen to the consumer. They would have listened to the backlash when the game first came out. You get your point across with these companies with your wallet.
---
This was hilarious. How long till Bethesda buys him out or sues the living daylights out of him?
---
Fallout1% will be a super exclusive, invite only platinum level upgrade to Fallout 1st that launches in place of Wastelanders since it will be pushed back again.
---
&gt;&gt;You’ll get priority responses to all the Bethesda support tickets you open.
---
&gt;&gt;Two free bottles of Purified Water monthly.
---
&gt;&gt;A custom Fallout1% flag pole so you can show everyone how important you are.
---
&gt;&gt;Light aperitifs and spirits each afternoon in the Whitesprings Club Level lounge.
---
&gt;&gt;Your own real life private companions that will finish quests and events for you.
---
&gt;&gt;A signed letter and certificate of appreciation from the ZeniMax board of directors.
---
Aside from this dumbass subscription shit, is this game worth trying to play again? What’s improved over the course of a year?
---
You're part of a community, communities ostracise individuals who do things against the community's best interests.
---
Too bad
---
By gutting and turning itself into a buy to play cash shop monstrosity
---
In Fallout 4 they bought in an actual shooter. Its not great but it works and is way better than the Fallout 3 shooter mechanic. As I refuse to use VATS these things are important to me.
---
Patch 14.0 seems to have caused an uptick in incomplete rendering...  
---
Hope you don't mind but used as an example for my bug roundup.  
---
I don’t know if you know this or not but they are turning big profits from this. The outrage is coming from the minority in reddit cry babies/YouTube clickbait shills.  Most people actually see this as what it is, and buy it if they want, or ignore it if they don’t.
---
When did i defend anything? Im just stating that the tool's speech is basically the same as it was months ago. Hell i left the game for amount 5 months, wasn't till now i actually started to enjoy playing. At launch this game was a sh!tshow no denying it, but it has changed alot since then.
---
This perfectly summed up me today...
---
Well if people like you disappear from the game it could actually become good, if people like you stay it'll stay trash and get worse from there. You tell bethesda through your purchase that the shit they are pulling is fine, resulting in them focusing on more cashgrab-models and more atom shop bullshit, and even less stuff made for the base game people payd FULL PRICE for.
---
So while in general you are right, harassing is bad, in this special case Im actually fine with it. Youre a tool of bethesda, thats your right, but you piss off true fans of fallout by a large margin, so dont cry about the consequences.
---
happens with everybody. lag couples with their terrible netcode.
---
If you buy the sub, you're enabling Bethesda's BS. You're part of the problem, you're the group that makes Bethesda think they can get away with this rubbish.
---
Yh which takes u to subscription but it doesnt show up
---
Really? Because eso seemed extremely bad before they pivoted.
---
One couldn’t be more owned than this.
---
"Toxic" is not a valid argument.
---
&gt; obviously an insane conspiracy theory 
---
That's my point! The idea that anyone thought F1st was going to do well is MORE crazy than my ramblings lol
---
I agree fully instead just like have a portable cooking pot OR USE YOUR F*****G CAMP
---
I like Bethesda's past work, I'm happy you enjoy this release.
---
I don't like this release, I played it for maybe 40 hours (guestimate) won't touch it for a couple years. I let it go, moved on. 
---
Today I'm here trying to figure the latest drama out.
---
However, "Bethesda Bad" is profitable, in ducats (Youtubers) or Dopamine (Upvotes).
---
That's not the whole story, but it's a factor. A Large factor.
---
Sorry.
---
is "Glad The Outer Worlds is out because I don't like Fallout 76 anymore" ok?
---
Faint Pipboy glow of positivity
---
I'm gonna copy/paste this to the official boards, quoting you with a link to here for exposure. Bug or intentional it needs known so people don't waste their Steel.
---
If you want a good community, I recommend r/fo76filthycasuals
---
hope its worse than  battlefronts tbh.
---
I doubt he will. And if he does it'll give Bethesda even worse publicity. Although it doesn't seem like they care at this point.
---
Oh boy, where's the defenders now. Come on, let's see them clown faces.
---
You sure as hell ain't the Joker, but you are a bunch of Jokers for defending it this damn long.
---
Come on, where are you, I KNOW you all want to show your pretty faces... and defend it some more.
---
RDR2 isn't a good game. It's a pretty game and a good story, but it isn't a good *game*; it actually plays like crap. Rockstar used to make great, genre-creating and defining games. Now they're more interested in making cinematic "experiences" that they then hollow out into a husk to fill with MTX crap in the form of a live service style online game.
---
Whereas Bethesda honestly seems like they have open disdain at this point with the mere idea of making RPGs and want to water it down and strip it down as much as possible. And now whatever shred of soul they had left has long since been cashed in with the most recent Elder Scrolls and Fallout games they've made.
---
It's absolutely 100% identical to launch, except there are more random events. If adding more random events makes you happy, then you're gonna love it today.
---
This is so fucking cringey. This guy sounds like an anonymous member
---
&gt; Stop mocking, blaming, and insulting players who buy the subscription. 
---
Yeah I don't think it's right to blame the players.   For people out there who are still able to stomach the game, I don't blame them for wanting unlimited storage space for scrap.  People have their reasons for using this service and I understand that. 
---
My beef if with Bethesda putting something behind a paywall that should have been part of the base game since day one. In a way, I don't blame people for buying extra storage. 
---
I blame Bethesda for making people pay for it.
---
It's hilarious, because it will cost you $180 a year for Xbox pass.
---
Outer Worlds yet?
---
Or $180 a year for the pass. I love how people frame arguments to support their bias.
---
You'll have to log into your Microsoft account to cancel.
---
I didn’t know that, no. I genuinely assumed it was backfiring and failing based on all the strikes against it, but I acknowledge I’m just watching the feedback and have no info on numbers. I own the game and want it to be better. I’m not here to stir trouble, but this genuinely is ruining the odds that I’ll ever want to play this game I paid for - so I’m here with y’all. 
---
(Fingers crossed for wastelanders!)
---
Doing God's work
---
Still playing a known broken game they wont fix and charge extra for things that should already be in the game.
---
I've had the same VATS issue.  Never had it before yesterday when I was in the jail event and couldn't lock on to enemies that were well within range.  I double checked my perks, weapon, health, etc everything and it was all at the settings i normally play with.  I wasn't sure if it was a bug with the event or a patch bug.  I play with a sniper rifle as my main weapon and have never run into it before.  I've done the free range event several times and it worked for me so this sounds like a patch issue..
---
I'm on PS4 so its interesting that its on both consoles.
---
Wait, they let you get a hit on the legendaries and still complain? Well damn, i didn't know the rewards were that game changing, i guess it's a change from the usual "i didn't even get to hit the legendary".
---
Do better then
---
Zenimax is still majority privately owned, but Providence Group, a private equity firm, owns 30%+ of Zenimax, or at least $450+ million. I'm sure there is pressure on Zenimax to stabilize their revenue (such as subscription services). Bethesda doesn't own Bethesda.
---
He's absolutely right. It should not cost that much, but evidently crying about doesn't change anything! I wanted the items I bought , I was in a financial decision to buy them. So I did and haven't looked back. People are different and that's a wonderous thing :)
---
What’s “op” stand for?
---
What do you expect? This community is ravenous for a semblance of content.
---
Yeah it is, But still not getting good reward at the end is annoying especially when the weapons you get are terrible
---
That's the opinion of a toxic person who doesnt understand simple economics.
---
I have been debating on doing this as well. With modern Warfare and Outer worlds out I dont see myself going back to it. I loved the game and can only ask when Wastelanders release that they realize their mistake and remove Fallout 1st along making the game amazing.
---
Can you cite some evidence of the big profits they are making from this? I’m truly interested in the numbers.
---
Yeah, that's definitely possible when everything else gets killed in 1 shot
---
Yeah. I bulk everything and when the stacks get over 5, 10 or 20 depending what it is I just vendor it unless it's a more valuable scrap. 
---
Good way to get some of the daily caps while managing your stash limits
---
Well we are getting the Halloween event next week, and that's about it, I think
---
&gt; I’m not concerned with their corporate structure and was using the term to denote executive leadership. 
---
Shareholder aren't ex- ah forget it.
---
&gt; Any theories on how or why their investors and partners signed off on FO1st? 
---
No. Because there are no credible facts to base it on. And please for the love of god don't mention Luke Stephens as a source. He's as credible as any other person here with a conspiracy theory.
---
Can you even try to see the benefits of doing what they did? Remember you are lucky to even have this game dood because they created it for you...get some fucking gratitude and change your attitude
---
Servers back up? Also ring of fire came with the Nuclear Winter mode
---
Careful he’s a hero
---
That's a genius idea. I'm sick of only getting 1 or 2 caps for all my items lol
---
Are you? Or are you visiting a subreddit of a game you don’t play just to hand out condescending remarks?
---
Uhh, then you couldn’t invite your friends or whoever to the private server?
---
Also that opens it up to exploits and such since you’d be offline and away from the anti-cheat tools
---
PC too...
---
but so far am liking Fallout 76: the Single Player experience
---
though having player venders is nice but you can always switch back to live ..check out the venders then come back to solo :-p.
---
I’m really afraid that Bethesda killed the Fallout franchise with this game. Which is really sad considering I feel it was one of the best franchises out there.
---
Position* not decision
---
He is helping another settlement according to Preston.
---
they did address some of the issues in another post somewhere tho....
---
exactly hence why it should have been a quest item with skins for sale. and the skins are so expensive too!!!
---
You're righ  about one thing.  Absolutely nothing about FO76 has changed. Most you get out of me is a chuckle. bud, don't flatter yourself. It's your prerogative to fall for scams while me and my peers laugh and have a good time at your expense. Keep it up though, that feeling of pride and accomplishment is in there somewhere. ;)
---
Trust me, the only reason to do that event is if you need scrip. The highest a mole miner can spawn is lvl 40.
---
even angry joe has done that lately...
---
i get his anger but there HAS been progress in the last year and a lot of people are forgetting that.
---
and i actually am very much liking solo servers at the moment too lol
---
Nothing they can do, the damage has been done, to their reputation &amp; our faith in the game getting better without getting nickel and dime for shit that was supposed to be free of charge. I don't mind dropping money on games, but it has to be worth the price....it's not, no matter how many times fanboys want flip it.
---
I thought they had no way to restore things lost to bugs?
---
Did you mean irrational? Because rational doesn't go with angry or upset
---
what's stopping you from doing that, then?
---
Happens to me too.
---
"I don't think it's rude at all"
---
Proceeds to be rude
---
unlimited scrap should be base game. so should the tent  and then fix server stability so people can raid.
---
bundling atoms with exclusive cosmetics should have been the only paid features.
---
Even worse. “The fans have been requesting more utility microtransactions. We didn’t want to go back on our word, but you guys kept demanding we sell you more items that should be in the game from launch”
---
same, yet I can't believe anyone is still this fucking stupid to keep playing after this "feature" they added.
---
But one man's trash is another man's piece of shit I guess.
---
I guess I wasn't sarcastic enough,I would totally get a hit in if they didn't die right away
---
Do a Barrel Roll!
---
I do it, to get loads of weapons to sell for caps to a robot vendor at a faster rate
---
it was downvoted by somneone who bought the anal-pass lol.
---
Don't worry bruv, I got ya, and the butter to go with it, you like Orville?
---
Nuked flora is instanced. If you can't harvest it's a bug - either the plants have visually respawned before their actual respawn timer is up, so they'll look harvestable when they're not, and sometimes they'll show harvestable for me and just nothing will happen if I try to harvest. But unless you're very badly bugged you should be able to walk right behind someone and harvest every plant they do.
---
Ok, Zenimax owns Bethesda. What I meant was that Bethesda's owners are still the same as they were, not some shareholders like with a public company.
---
&gt; I'm sure there is pressure on Zenimax to stabilize their revenue (such as subscription services). Bethesda doesn't own Bethesda.
---
Based on what facts? None, right? Or at least nothing within the last 3-4 years at any rate, right?
---
We could use a new meta currency that is harder to obtain such as fuzzy tokens or Bobby pins.
---
it's a term often used in r/legaladvice but yeah
---
I'd say play those games. This is basically like anthem now; dead in the water and not worth your time.
---
you do realize there's nothing special about their build, right? that you could put one together yourself? and then put it in the effort to kill things *before* other people do it?
---
I hope BGS feels just damn right embarrassed at this point.
---
My route is National Isolated Radio Array to West Tek to Huntersville then vendor. All super mutant spawns, so alot of assault rifles and xp.
---
Melee is working okay for me. I'm on a PC and trying some .ini changes to reduce lag / improve fps.
---
You can buy "blue"
---
plenty of blame to be placed on someone who enables this kind of stuff, need to speak with your wallet
---
that being said, we're here with gaming now because of all those CoD map packs people paid for over the years, all those fifa card packs, and so on and so on; realistically its a decade too late to be a gaming sjw
---
Oh, Fallout76 is creating problems for you?  Do tell.  Give specific examples of actual events, not the hypothetical bullshit that you’ve spewed.
---
this game and anthem are giving me what I've always wanted:
---
Unlimited "Content" and I didn;t even have to spend one damn dime lawl.
---
Just gotta come to places like this and the toobs for all the entertainment one could ever ask for.
---
Because I do NOT in any way shape or form feel sorry for the people who bought this and anthem, you all deserve this pain, and humiliation.
---
But, but, it need not continue; delete the game, burn the disc, and never come back. Just enjoy it from the sidelines like the rest of the smart people are.
---
Come on, I know you have it in you, you CAN do it!
---
Except, it didn't used to be that way, Bethesda used to make great games. Fallout 3, Oblivion, Skyrim, and even Fallout 4 were  amazing. It seems after Creation Club they've lost their way. It's sad.
---
Thank you! I appreciate the approach! O7
---
What's cringe is investing in a studio that doesn't care about you
---
Yeah I do realize that, and I do put in the effort to, but sometimes someone else is faster
---
Yeah im with you on that! I was a hardcore free player. Did my best to never spend any money on it and just enjoy it.
---
Huh?
---
MSI reference maybe?
---
Don't really need xp, I am currently level 117 and I only started playing this April and that's a decent route
---
I don't care if it's right or wrong I'm buying fallout first and no one can stop me ...help I have a problem with fallout..wait is it a problem if you love it?
---
If you quit and change toons, can you return to the same server?
---
I think wastelanders has a chance but I think the content released so far has been thin, flawed and not the sort of thing to build the user base.
---
I unbulked to store in my scrap box. Lol
---
I think the klnger your on a server the more time moves with the possiblity of it moving forward atleast a day. If not probably just a bug.
---
If you don't have caps blame yourself and maybe get better. The game is not hard you can literally sell anything in your vendor and people will buy it as long as it's a good deal.
---
&gt;\[...\] but since Bethesda made rewards performance based this is bad
---
The performance-based rewards for public events hasn't been implemented yet.

I like black licorice but if you eat too much the loo is nuked.
---
The head.
---
Clean off.
---
They don't care, that's why they're trying to grab the cash and run.
---
Ugh my childhood hero has sunk to cartoon villainy
---
There’ll be a new one that they actually put effort into soon. This one was just a little side hustle to make some money. It’s the reason why they had a different branch of the company do it instead of the main team. Maybe even made this as a prequel to the next one
---
I’m out.
---
Been playing since day one.
---
The very idea of an infinite pay to win scrap box 📦 is ...
---
Unfathomable.
---
This is Star Wars battlefront 2 level bad.
---
Yet there are only dozens of us,
---
and potentially millions of players of that game...
---
I’m so glad I stopped playing video games. Commercialization has had a shockingly ugly affect on the whole industry, it’s gross.
---
Finally someone who speaks the truth here
---
I know right? Im just trying to be a good neighbor here but this sub is gonna be this sub, I suppose.
---
Bethesda is probably praying the shit out this doesnt turn out to be as bad as Blizzard controversy
---
Then they should have been raising their prices to meet the cost of development instead of splitting the games into pieces to nickel and dime players out of a full experience. Gaming was and always has been an expensive hobby. If raising prices will crash the market then clearly nothing can ever get more expensive like how everything else works in every other market that magically doesn’t crash because of it.
---
Instead we’ve gone down a slow and insidious slope to the point where people are just used to it and defend this kind of greedy, stupid bullshit.
---
For every customer Fallout 1st has attracted, its put off at least 14 more. Because it’s a distasteful decision with game being in it’s current state, where even “premium” items are introduced to the game broken. Not only is there now a lack of content, but as always, theres been a lack of quality. Even from a purely business perspective, this was a bad decision. Its ultimately been mocked to the point where it may have well been Bethesda giving free publicity to The Outer Worlds.
---
“It’s purely optional” is a piss-poor paper thin argument thats been parroted over and over here. Repair kits, Scrap Kits, the Fridge, and Collectron were all ‘purely optional’ as well, but they were undoubtedly content that affected moment to moment gameplay and gave players small advantages if they paid in. And the slope gets slippier as we go.
---
Meanwhile the release of backpacks, a comparable item, was applauded. It was put into the game for free and required players to go through new content in order to unlock. Everything Bethesda has tried to sell on the Atomic Shop could have been like this with a minimal amount of effort.
---
But instead they slapped a price tag on it after promising they would never do that.
---
And people are actually defending it.
---
Well considering we just got patch 14 recently, id say this article is old
---
Keep telling yourself that. Here we are a year later with sheepsquatch to show for it.
---
He hasn't tweeted much of anything for a month. I saw one tweet where he tried to make love connection with Jim Gaffigan about bacon (as if that guy needs Pete Hines' help with being funny).
---
Fallout 76 is the hot pockets of the fallout IP.
---
Fuck that game. Play outer worlds
---
This is neither DLC or a Season Pass
---
That was all added years into the life of ESO though, this game has been out a year. Give them time. They ALREADY are charging $100 for NOTHING haha
---
I didnt make any until level 60 or so. Then storage became a real problem, and I just started bulking everything. I reccomend always gathering some plastic so you can do this too!
---
Keep crying baby
---
Time passes the longer you play, but it revers back to Reclamation Day when you re-log in. Been that way since day one.
---
Time won't officially change until Wastelanders.
---
No?
---
In the end, it’s going to become one of the basics of economics 101, moral and ethical companies will last longer. We can only find out in the future if they go the full monetized route or go with classic experience similar to Skyrim/fallout 4. Just is gonna depends how the future of games is  favored. It is becoming quite popular now for people to spend (x) dollars to become a god at a game over long term investment of playing. Not saying it’s like this now, but it could go that way in the future. Lots of factors but shareholders can control a company like a fish in a little cup of water.
---
I’m busy playing Outer Worlds. Someone let me know if anything changes.
---
Imperial Edition was in from the start, and the $50 bank/merchant characters should have received twice as much pushback as this is getting. I guess outrage didn't sell back then like it does now. I'll agree with the $100 mansions that it took a while, just seems insane as someone who wandered in. And besides, that game is just a generic MMO with an ES skin, at least 76 is the same combat system
---
Scaling with heavy weapons would make more sense wouldn't it?
---
The serious part I believe. The intelligent bit not so much after reading it.
---
Also, the contraction of you and are is “you’re”.
---
“Your” is possessive and indicative of ownership.
---
You should probably make note of that before parading yourself around as serious and intelligent.
---
Lol is a single player they couldn't fuck up again like they did with new vegas
---
Yea... no matter how much you try to insist that this "subscription" is in some way mandatory it isn't going to stick.  You can play this game to it's fullest while missing out on nothing but fancy clothes and furniture while paying no more than the base price.
---
Thankfully I didn't get that game, but yeah it makes sense it's more a graphics thing than an actually good game. Sucks how that's a trend now, that people think graphics are all that matter, or those like Bethesda who think their name is all that matters even if you don't even give them a game, just give them an empty buggy wasteland with almost nothing to do and watch the money flow in. 
---
______________________
---
Cinematic experiences aren't necessarily bad where games are concerned, but when it takes away from the game or gameplay itself it definitely is a problem. Yeah, micro/macrotransaction crap is still one of the worst plagues of the gaming industry. 
---
__________________________
---
Yeah, I think their thought is, "Damn, Skyrim took SO much effort, and we made (this) much money, but we make PLENTY giving them an empty wasteland, so why should we ever try again?" 
---
And that's why I always argue the ignorant people who say, "Don't pay and it doesn't affect you," because the fact people are willing to pay for such useless sh*t is why they feel enabled to keep selling useless sh*t. That means it is affecting everyone who wants them to make good games again. What's the most recent Elder Scrolls? Are you talking about the 6th Skyrim release? Hahahaha, the original game along with DLC and mods is still one of the best all-time games in my opinion, but without mods I would definitely not play it much at all after the first couple vanilla playthroughs I had. Modding was always one of my favorite things about that game, and now it seems Bethesda only wants "paid mods" to be allowed. So disgusting, and I won't be supporting their single player crap unless it's at LEAST as good as Skyrim, a year after it launches. Now that games are waiting for reviews to come out before putting in crap microtransactions, I have to wait a while after releases to be sure it's not a crap game. Doesn't that suck? Should be sued for false advertising if a game changes after reviews and ratings. Significant changes of course that actually would affect the reviews and ratings. That should be false advertising easily.
---
they don't care... you already payed for it. either the game, some mtx, or fofu#1.   
---
they simple don't care, they will continue to not care because.. well.. they want money, not players.   
---
so unless they actively LOSE MONEY from the bank account. you are basically shit to them.   
---
i know because i know people that develop gambling apps. they DO NOT CARE about  you.   
---
you are THEIR CASH COW.
---
Can't wait for this pack it is literally a dream come true, I have wanted Liberator/Infiltrator themed cosmetics since before the game even came out. Was really excited by the Shi skin in NW but this is great, now I really can't wait for the Gauss Minigun to be added in(I really hope it gets a skin like the AR)
---
I love the Power Armor but my only gripe is I wished it looked more like the Chinese Warmachine from the posters. I still love it though and I really hope it spouts off Communist propaganda similar to the Liberty Prime Armor.
---
I also really hope the clothing is a under armor, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up especially with the holsters.
---
Most people are saying that their stash went from 800 down to less than 350 just by moving junk to the bottomless junk stash.
---
That is significant. It virtually DOUBLES the stash storage, but you have to pay to get that benefit.
---
That was the preview for Patch 13. You can read the [patch notes for Patch 14](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5OZH9xTsc8DNuEN539nN6y/fallout-76-update-14-patch-notes-october-23-2019); the section for public events only mentions reducing the cooldown timer between events.

---
Zenmiax. You mean Bethesda?
---
Thanks for that review. You described everything very well and made great points. Glad you enjoyed the game and hope you still around when or till Wastelanders comes out. :)
---
Well I was going to say the same thing but you beat me to it
---
I wished I could up vote you more than once.
---
If you pay for a whole year up front, how is that any different from a season pass?
---
Mr Lennon
---
And it's definitely implemented, because I got terrible rewards this time and I believe we have a few small updates in between 13 and 14 patch
---
Better than the single action ig.
---
What Is It?
---
About 60 dollars
---
I actually just played through that. I really loved it, it felt like a scrape to get by in the start and they really nailed the wasteland, then I got the winterized t51b and turned into a shining white knight bringing peace to the wasteland. It was awesome
---
I also showed my dad all the landmarks cause he worked in the pentagon for a decade. It was really touching to see him be like “oh go that way! Wow!” And eventually take the laptop from me. I loved every second
---
jesus motherfucking goddamn piece of shit more exams to do and more possum shit to do, eight this time for fuck sake
---
But, the people with them are paying for the higher server demand.
---
What?
---
I was hoping  for chainsaw plans personally, well, that and making the chainsaw more than just a novelty weapon.
---
Zenimax owns Bethesda
---
I promising I don't bite (and I do have all my teeth, but still, no biting)
---
Anything on what counts as a Costume? Was planning on using the Nuka Girl Outfit.
---
A subscription service.
---
ayyy thanks for saying Zenimax and not Bethesda. I dont understand why people blame Todd Howard and the devs when Beth screw up but when literally anyone else has the problems, its ALWAYS the publisher's fault. Always
---
They can’t make it weigh zero, devs explained that everything needed to have value for multiplayer to work ,
---
All the rewards are lvl 40 anyway
---
Bye Felicia, if your dumb enough to spend hundreds on atoms and then quit because something isn't the way you want well don't worry you will not be missed. Stop being a baby accept what the (DEVELOPERS) put out and play the fucking game. I mean you Reddit divas that whine and cry over every thing that comes out you don't like the easiest thing you can do is stop playing. I hope you understand no one that matters cares what your insignificant grievances are with the game.
---
I love the little ways my state embraced the game.
---
Do u mean they bought the first pass or bought the game 76 itself?.. your post needs a little bit more context. Honestly if you wanna see how people feel about the game just look through this subreddit, maybe by New. Almost all of it is people bashing the game, with the posts defending the game definitely being the minority.
---
I also love that the game got people interested in my state in a positive way too. We are not fully the lame stereotypes and I hope folks are seeing that when they visit and pass by!
---
how many people At Bethesda right now were actually a part of the original games? Isn't it almost completely different people now except for maybe a couple?
---
You've got a point there.  You'd think they could just lift the code from Fallout 4 on the infinite storage.
---
Yes and? Bethesda is ruining this game. Not Zenmiax.
---
I remember when Fallout 76 was released, and the Fallout subreddit was nothing but bashing, people sought this place out to enjoy the game.. However, I defended this game for a long time but even I have to step back from this. We need to send a message. It's been a year, the Chainsaw is broken, the Alien blaster sucks, and there's so many issues left...come on!
---
I'm not convinced they won't try to charge us a subscription for the next single player elder scrolls.
---
I’m not investing in anything. I’m buying a product I like. The gull on you man! Wow! Trying to tell everyone that things that spend their own hard money is stupid because you don’t agree with something. It’s weird is all
---
Well, some kind of leasing agreement or something.  For the license that is.
---
The game is introducing a subscription service. The game was already half-assed from the start. Riddled with game breaking bugs, nearly 0 real substantive content, and plenty of PR horseshit. All for the price of a full retail game. And now Bethesda is introducing a subscription service. It's a huge slap in the face to the consumers and a lot of the community wanted to boycott the game from day 1. A lot of yall didn't listen and decided to financially incentivize this bullshit.
---
If wastelanders flops this game will die with it. Wastelanders is beth’s last ace
---
He means when the game first game out and for some reason still cares so much about a game he despises to come back because he has nothing better to do
---
LOL - try to keep up
---
TendieWorld
---
Now developers this is why you don’t rush a game
---
So you pay more and get less? Good deal.
---
This is correct. It's just a video game but I also had the random thought to say "I told you so". I just feel like there's been a lot of half assed games lately, and video game companies are going to keep being lazy if we keep paying them.
---
I don't trust any company. It doesn't hurt if i wait a couple of weeks of people playing and reviewing games before i decide if i want to buy it or not. Even if it's CD Projekt Red.
---
People like the game. They want continual updates and improvements. They wanted to support the game so it receives those fixes. Besides it's good value for the price of $13.90
---
Technically. The only difference is the word. It’s close enough to be a lie and there were other lies told as well, like how there’d never be anything in the shop other than skins and other things with no effect on play.
---
Just post it, all the people who have been complaining are “done with this game” or “I’m uninstalling it” so you should be fine 😁
---
Bro you're still a newer player lol
---
I think it reduces weight.
---
It doesn’t effect camp budget
---
It just works
---
He's saying people should have let the game die from the start and asking if people learned their lesson lol
---
I’ve actually already experienced a handful of bugs playing outer worlds like invisible guns and Xbox freezing just comes to show any game can have bugs no matter the developer but I’m not one of them “oh games bugged not playing” type of people it’s a really fun game bringing OG fallout vibes especially since there is terminals in the game with a very similar interface 😂
---
So be faster
---
I was very close to max budget and it doesn’t look any different at all however the bar isn’t exactly a great indicator... a percentage would be better with items even in the atomic store displaying the item percentage would help a lot.
---
Because the sub isn't giving dlc?
---
well they haven't made a core title since Fallout 4. I think people are getting ahead of themselves a little bit in this assumption that because they have shown a lot of shitty business practices lately, they are no longer capable of making good games.
---
Thats the thing youve only been playing a little while. A lot of other people have been playing for a year and know how the game has changed
---
I’m not arguing that ESO is bullshit trash, but they set a precedent for Zenimax. Everything you see 76 doing was learned from ESO. This time it’s worse because 76 offers nothing for your money, just small conveniences and new hats
---
Yeah, thus the idea to outsource development to Obsidian.
---
You realize Bethesda threw a shit fit over this right? It’s the only reason we know this actually happened, they’re trying to win this over a legal battle
---
Yea that sounds great
---
Mine fucked me over about 6 hours ago. I opened a ticket and got this response:
---
Bethesda Customer Support response on 10/25/2019 07:58 PM
---
Greetings,
---
&gt; Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.
---
We are aware of an issue where Scrapbox items are not appearing in game under certain conditions. We are working towards a solution and it will be resolved as soon as possible. We will update you when we have further information.
---
Thank you for your patience and continued support.
---
Best regards,
---
Bethesda Support
---
That is exactly why we do it. Ruining everyone else's experience enhances ours.  It's a give take relationship.
---
I'm literally uninstalling the game right now, this was mostly posted so that the company PR folks might have a chance of seeing an example of a paying customer that they alienated.
---
If you don't realize how big the backlash over this has been, why don't you go check out the top posts on r/gaming today.
---
Except 76 was based on F04's *Survival mode* which did give weight to ammo
---
If I could, I would
---
“Technically the only difference is the word” No there is no technicality it’s not a season pass since you are not paying for DLC. 
---
What in the shop has any affect to play? The scrap kits and repair kits don’t affect your game play. There are plenty of workbenches throughout the world.
---
Those who do don’t care...
---
Well good for you, then,
---
You saved my ass
---
You shod just learn it to free up .25 lbs of weight lol
---
There is nothing to suggest TES6, made on the latest iteration of gamebryo, will have improved in a way relative to the ten years or so since Skyrim. They need a new engine.
---
Iirc much of Fallout’s old team members are long gone from Obsidian.
---
You can’t insult peoples for that.
---
Many are casual, have money and doesn’t care about paying.
---
And even if no one would buy it, it practically cost nothing to a business to implement such paying features.
---
Unless it becomes illegal, it won’t stop and the players has no effects on them,
---
Good input, on behalf of the OP thank you.
---
Ah ok, some people still like the game. Masochists. I will check back after the next time they fuck the consumers again.
---
Wait until you are 2200 hrs in like me, then make a review. Of course everything is shiny and new, ooohs &amp; ahhhhs will fade and you'll realize how empty,shallow and basic the game truly is.
---
Only thing that kept me playing so long were my customers who couldn't believe the God rolls I was selling all the time, became a cap multi-millionaire, bought all plans that can be attained, what's left to do? Run mindless events 24/7? 😆...most people will never achieve what I have....yet want to still act like they have a leg up on me or know more than I do for some self serving reason. 😆
---
I agree with OP.  I won't spend another penny on this game and the chances I invest anything in the future with "Bethe$da" on the game is very unlikely.  They burned too many bridges with me with this game and blatant cash grab "fu first" concept of a horrible reskin of FO4.
---
&gt; why the fuck would they even want this domain?
---
To prevent other people from doing exactly what was just done.
---
Did you delete your characters first? Not one person will ever show a video of that... they’re afraid to actually “quit”...lol 
---
Y’all will be back... they always come back...
---
Hmm maybe having a private server isn't looking so bad after all.
---
I remember him taking 2 weeks holiday exactly when FO76 launched with huge problems that needed answers from Bethesda at the time. No one was managing the community, totally unprofessional. This behaviour continues.
---
13 bucks to collect flux alone... I just dont get it
---
The Fallout Community has been in a perpetual civil war for 11 years and I fucking hate most of it because of how toxic it is.
---
If I did want to it would actually be private, Because adding people as friends on PS4 is dumb
---
Not me man. I'm uninstalling the Bethesda launcher too.
---
To be even more fair, from a programming perspective that issue is ridiculously easy to fix. Simply maintain separate "public" and "private" inventories.
---
Hell, make private servers persistent (maybe even local?) and make each private world completely separate (no shared inventories). Like every other survival-based multiplayer game.
---
Buying it or not, those features get so many backlash that it becomes less common.
---
And seriously, even if no one buys it. Fallout 1st won’t dissappear since it barly cost them nothing to implement.
---
Buyers =/ punishing the comunity.
---
Ah damn, I remember reading about it in the most recent Inside the Vault but it must be lumped with the "as things evolve" bit it mentioned.
---
sorry my comment gave the wrong idea. I meant to say "how many people at Obsidian were actually a  part of the original games".
---
You know, as fun as this is, I think it'll mean nothing. And that's what upsets me. I want Bethesda to change. I want to have hope for ES6 and Fallout 5, but at this point I just don't. Bethesda have proved themselves time and time again to be an absolute disaster of a company. I don't think we can hope for redemption anymore, I think crashing and burning is the best case scenario.
---
The problem is unrestrained, rampant greed. The concern is that even if the studio *does* develop a good game (somehow, despite that ancient fucking game engine) that they'll fuck it up as it's leaving with some new exploitative garbage.
---
I had this exact experience. Gave it a break for 3 months after scouts were added.
---
Came back to - Biv talking like a camp counsellor/instructor, 3 drop outs and sliding dead ghouls at whitespring.
---
'nope'.
---
His name is Robert Paul-  ...wait ...
---
His name is Mark Chapman.
---
Outer worlds is getting so much praise even with its bugs when 76 came out it got so many bad reviews just cause people following everybody else I swear these people need to get a mind of their own
---
I don't agree on the unlimited storage part because they said few months back they can't increase of stability etc..
---
But you guys need to understand every other game that offers private servers is not free as well so don't expect a free private server people, even if a game is making bank f076 is not they charge for servers.
---
If anything, atomic shop items shouldn’t be budget hogs like the Nuka Cola sign!
---
fuck me, they still haven't fixed that?!?!
---
With 16 times times the detail
---
Literally every other game that has private servers has a charge for it, FO76 players expect to get it for free?
---
Get your head out of your butt
---
The problems is that no interesting games are coming out.
---
And all the previous games have been completed
---
Take my downvote because the order of mysteries is fucking gay
---
ya thats what I meant to say.
---
I think the main of argument is, if they were willing to tarnish the image of 1 of their beloved franchises in the quest for greed. What stops them from doing it with the next.
---
People make excuses about the possibility of this being a momentary setback for BGS and the dirty practices of recent are possibly due to delays of other games meaning to be released by Bethesda in this time period, and now 76 is the only way to make some revenue so they're squeezing it out of the loyal community.
---
But in reality. Less than 2 years ago, Bethesda campaigned to "Save Player 1" and immediately followed it by joining the market trend of an online game with shady microtransaction practices and it's only been downhill from there.
---
I'm not saying ES6 is gonna be an online, heavily monetized mess. But I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we saw some ridiculous business practices like over-priced pre-orders for beta access and a couple tiny "exclusive" skins, or paid DLC launched not long after the game comes out, showing that they clearly cut content, just to resell it to squeeze a few extra bucks.
---
To anyone that still supports this game after this... 
---
You are an unbelievably stupid and unredeemable moron. 
---
Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Take your dunce hat and sit in the corner until society can find some job suitable for you. 
---
Maybe you could donate your organs to someone that uses their critical thinking skills? Not sure, just spitballing.
---
Yes, I love it since I'm not a filthy communist 😎
---
They have "Balanced" all of the good weapons. They're trash now.
---
More events.
---
You're not mad about being charged 13 dollars a month FOR A NON-PERSISTENT SERVER INSTANCE THAT YOU DON'T GET ADMIN PRIVILEGES FOR?
---
Because I'd be mad about that.  
---
13/mo is pretty high price to rent hardware to run a genuine persistent private instance that you have total control over - let alone to RENT one of any number of non-persistent instances that you're timesharing with other subscribers.
---
Come back and see how Wastelanders is. Don't worry about making an alt account. We won't say I toadaso
---
Nah my guy I've gotten up to the 26th before lmao. When a server goes online it defaults to the 23rd but can progress
---
I'd really like to do the same! Surely there's some interesting stuff that happens elsewhere. Somewhere in the mire, or maybe the fallen space station!
---
To anyone that still supports this game after this...
---
You are an unbelievably stupid and unredeemable moron.
---
Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Take your dunce hat and sit in the corner until society can find some job suitable for you.
---
If they're so inexperienced that they don't know how to efficiently store simple values, they wouldn't have been able to produce the game (let alone the engine) in the first place. They were absolutely lying.
---
Good luck, I’ll be enjoying my subscription
---
Though, given how big a mess that engine is, is it any surprise that it was a buggy mess?
---
You people are so sad...
---
Happens
---
What the hell are you even talking about? 
---
FO76 on launch was nigh unplayable. Graphics glitches, poor performance, gameplay glitches, hundreds of hundreds of bugs. Servers were garbage, things were broken. All of this for 60 dollars. 
---
Outer Worlds is well optimized and sure there are minor bugs but nothing near what 76 had. A full complete game ON LAUNCH. Not to mention you can literally pay one dollar to experience it on gamepass. 
---
76 even one year later is still unoptimized, still full of bugs, and to top it off they're taking community feedback and monetizing it lmao.  So no Outer Worlds will not receive 76 hate. Go kick rocks.
---
Radiant only keeps daily questing interesting if the quest structure is interesting.  All it does is madlib locations and mobs into a pre-built quest structure.
---
So if all they do is build radiant quests as 'go there, kill that' - like in FO4 - then they're not going to be very interesting.
---
It's not like that's notice directly there, on the page? Now you guys getting dumber, it say right beneath it, that's a recurring....
---
the vault raids are not very fun, the rest of the game is though
---
Find me a single rpg without bugs
---
Nice man. I actually laughed out loud.
---
I didn't know shielded raider plans had a level cap lol
---
You . . . you know that Dr Manhattan was a) never good and, b) didn't end as a villain.  He was framed.
---
Hah yea
---
The practice of getting a domain name that's obviously related to something you don't own is called domain squatting, and it is something every business should defend themselves against as best they can. This site is a relatively best-case scenario, but a hacker could set up a really official looking login and even a payment system. Then, once the user inputs their credentials, that gets forwarded to the real site. The user paid for the service, but their information got jacked by the fake site. 
---
While that's (probably) not legally Bethesda's responsibility, it makes you look really bad, and allowing someone to use your IP's name (and images) without permission weakens your claim to it. People being able to point to cases where you haven't defended your IP weakens your claims against people misusing it. There's a good argument to be made that this site is harmful to the profits of BGS, and is not set up with good intent, and is therefore domain squatting.
---
So yeah, no, Bethesda actually did fuck up by not grabbing some of the most obvious domains associated with their game. falloutfirst.com I can see them not grabbing, the lack of purchasing fallout76.com is egregious.
---
Uranium Fever needs to be completed as quick as possible for a chance at shielded raider plans. That means repairing things as soon as they break down, one shotting enemies, and killing the Legendaries as quick as possible
---
The overall spread for item value towards the budget is maddening as well. Ive been playing since BETA and I just realized that a concrete foundation is valued higher than a wooden foundation.
---
It's recurring for PC also.  You have to cancel it.
---
The game is fun and I enjoy exploring the world and building my CAMP. I played the game during the “Beta” and played a couple hours a few days a week for about 4 months after release. 
---
After that I got pretty busy and couldn’t make the  time to play. But things have settled a bit and I recently started playing the game again.
---
Bottom line is despite the issues, it’s an enjoyable game for me. If it wasn’t, I wouldn’t play it. Can’t wait for Wastelanders.
---
No. Haven't gone to the ship yet but it's amazing. I will play this - I don't play 76.
---
No we are the happy ones, the ones not complaining &amp; playing the game we like
---
We completed it pretty fast, I go not armor or plans
---
I for one never experienced those bugs your speaking of playing 76 and I know I’m not the only one it’s just like anthem people non stop talking about bugs killing a good ass game when I play the game just fine and like I said I know they doing wrong with their membership bullshit and what do you expect out of an online game literally every new online game at launch has server issues even destiny 2 when it went f2p even tho the game has been out for years
---
76 got hate because it was a shallow product lacking a large number of features, way more glitches than it should've had for the extreme lack of content it had, the graphics of a ps2 game, and packed with microtransactions from the start. The Outer Wilds has some glitches but none of the other issues I listed that got 76 the hate. Ive paid a ton of 76 and i'm currently playing The Outer Worlds. They're day and night. 76 has plenty of fun to it to be sure, but the Outer Worlds IS a much better product. So no, I won't give it undeserved hate matching the mostly deserved hate 76 received.
---
I've seen little to no issues in several different Outer Worlds playthroughs, meanwhile.. most 76 playthroughs I've seen involved game-breaking issues xvx
---
Well, registering that domain is called domain squatting or cyber squatting. If it's cost Bethesda anything (and they have a strong case for it damaging their brand since it ended up on national news), then what he did was a federal crime and he'll likely end up having to pay damages. Also, while I think that the use of Bethesda's images and name for the site would fall under parody, and judge might not see it the same way. At a minimum, they could sue him for it and force him to face the legal fees and cost to his time.
---
So, yeah. He could honestly be looking at quite a few legal fees in the near future. If Bethesda/Zenimax is smart, they'll leave him be to prevent further damage to their name.
---
That is what I’m trying to say..
---
Which is worse.
---
How rude
---
because there is nothing more to give for a high level player. Could you imagine any?
---
I don't believe this at all.
---
Lol lol you try to keep up
---
Your computer and internet sucks
---
I've yet to see a paid dlc or season pass
---
What’s he do now?
---
Forgot to mention, we are also happy that the constant complainers are leaving :) 
---
Leaves people who enjoy the game free to continue on without all the hate.
---
He killed frank jaeger
---
Of course, I still have hope they'll snap out of this greed and focus on making good games again. Still waiting happily for news on Starfield and TES 6. Hope they dont mess those up.
---
What's causing my lag spikes? I already deleted over 300 friends and took out some of my personal inventory. When I get more than a few enemies my lag is huge, choppier than a slap chop
---
Well the Grafton mayor is pretty much that. ;)
---
Seems weird and pointless to me. Todd lies. Dunno why anyone would ever ask him or Pete Hinds a question about anything ever again. Zero credibility left there.
---
I want Bethesda to change as much as anyone does but don't see how having dialog with someone whose word is worth dirt would help with that.
---
I've never played NV but thoroughly enjoyed Fallout 2, 3 and Fallout 4. I gave NV a chance but that bald dude in the beginning wouldn't stop glitching out and crashing the game.
---
Sounds like I'll give it a shot tomorrow.
---
Has anyone read any were if we will be able to add or change stuff in the new fast travel scrap tent? Ex use the bigger tent if you found the plans or switch out the bed or add benches to it
---
It’s still pretty poorly optimized. The official patch on the website helps but it’s a mess xD
---
The legs break more frequently than other parts and need repair more often.
---
Probably your shitty internet.
---
4 hours into OW and it's pretty amazing. Combat is awesome, graphics are great. And it's costing $5 a month. As long as I can beat it by xmas it's a great deal. No hate here. No epic here either.
---
Where'd you hear this
---
These aren't private servers, these are private worlds. I think a large number of people would pay for a private server.
---
If I recall correctly in their last expo when they were discussing this, they even referred to them as private servers. These private worlds are the same as the current offerings of adventure (no world persistence ect).
---
I think private worlds (for free) where you can play vanilla 76 with whoever you choose would have been a great offering to go along with private servers where things like world persistence and other things we would all love to have seen could live (at a cost). Similar to basically every other offering out there right now.
---
Somebody call the fucking wambulance.
---
#The Real Deal
---
It was fine before, my friends were also experiencing it but I know it's all anectdotal. Someone did said they were being DDoS'd on the market discord, so yeah this post was made off of a rumor. Mostly asking here to see how people's private servers are running
---
Freelancing. He's working on Dying Light 2, not sure what else off the top of my head.
---
No u
---
I call them nirnroot.
---
Most of them are entitled little pieces of shit. I don’t know how the fuck one’s brain gets wired in such a way that when they don’t like something they come on the internet and fucking cry about it.
---
Hey frogo! The market discord. Tbh I used to think the person who said it was another one of your alt accounts lol
---
Theres a lot of things that they just plain didnt seem to understand about how multiplayer games work. Things like not having a room full of all the games rare items and also items not available to be purchased yet. Inability to auto flag accounts holding or interacting with locked content. Not having push to talk or a proper text chat for the game on launch. 
---
These things are all givens when making an online game. Bethesda's side studio acted like it had never played one before and was all Pikachu surprise mouth when their economy got fucked up so quickly.
---
It can very well be just straight incompetence and not knowing how databases work.
---
I toadaso Julian
---
Yeah no blame players and Bethesda it isn’t a drug, it’s a game thats cheating you. Then buying this shit is only gonna make Bethesda do more of this stupid shit because it’s profitable.
---
Wouldn’t surprise me.
---
Yep, I knew I should've ignored this post. The market discord is stupid, same with everyone in there, that person is probably lying.
---
Todd Howard was the one spilling all the bullshit about 76 at cons and in videos. He wanted to take responsibility for it.
---
You're gonna ignore your ole pal? Sad! But you're probably right
---
Just some of the bugs. Which aren't exactly what people are most upset about.
---
I would love to have a flak cannon you build at your camp that you sit on and fire from. Load it with cannon balls on the side
---
Yo OP. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If you don't want to be criticized for it, stop using your spare money to incentivize developers to make games worse. 
---
I'd never in a million years harass you in game or send you DMs over it, but since you made this post, I want you to know that yes your lack of discernment and willingness to pay shitheels who offer a bad deal is part of the problem. At least if you just lit your money on fire you wouldn't be helping finance the decay of the medium.
---
Not sure that you understand what you're talking about.  Fallout76.com is owned by Zenimax, so crux of your argument is worthless.
---
Yea and the reason why Bethesda needs to recoup lost revenue is because the game sold very poorly and there's not that many people playing it. Something about the game being broken on release (and still broken today) and the overpriced cosmetics on the atomic shop rubbed people the wrong way, I wonder why.
---
You are the ones that are sad, sure Bethesda sucks, but a refund should be out of question after such a substantial playtime.
---
You should also learn about the innate risk of digital product purchases before buying any said products, that is all the companies would say that they can change the game in any way, consumers also have the responsibility of learning what they are getting into.
---
For something that's eligible or reasonable enough for refunds you should look at extreme cases like Wild West Online, or the early No Man's Sky.
---
Bulk lead and aluminum as those are the only ones that get lighter on your stash box

Down to do raids, my group isn't about that life but I need me some strangler power armor.
---
I did too op, I left the Bethesda's launcher, but fo76 is over for me now
---
Oh wow another shill for gamepass lol. Don't you think money should go to the developer and not the distributor? Those deals favor distributors, and take money away from developers who basically only benefit from increased player numbers. Does Obsidian not deserve $60 for that game?
---
This also happen to me when I use an auto laser rifle with the beam splitter tip.
---
This is like the people who don't vote on Election Day because, "One vote doesn't change anything" or "I don't think our votes are even counted anyway".
---
We're standing against this and it's much bigger than any of us, it's about the entire gaming industry and making a change. 
---
No one should threaten you, sorry about that. But, I don't understand the point of this post. Read our posts recently, I'm surprised you've only gotten 9 messages TBH.
---
Side note, if you eeeever manage to find a “Gilded minigun” dont scrap it thinking it will give you the paint job and protect that puppy with your life.
---
Do you happen to be interested in buying a bridge?
---
the subscription itself really 
---
but i am enjoying the private world mode sooooooo i cant rage much.
---
Why'd you come to the 76 subreddit then? Another sheep for the negative astroturfing campaign?
---
Yep, as long as the whales continue dumping money into it they'll continue the same practices.
---
Only if you call it a chapter instead of a bridge

Their games were still buggy messes. They just covered with great story, until fallout 4..

Lol thanks for the info

This needs to change. Anyone who is into the endgame grind is going to have at least one bloodied build.

Can you see/did you notice if any other effects are missing in any slots?

Look for the criptid in the zones and if its not the flatwoods monster just server hop, repeat until you found that thing.
---
Ive had never seen him in all of my time in the game playing sense beta, found him in 10 server hops doing this.
---
Shovel up some Atoms for next month! No questions asked
---
Lmao tough luck buddy some of us don’t even own one
---
I honestly wish posts that simply state that "this game sucks" followed with zero constructive criticism should be banned. They dont help or do anything for anyone. Just becomes a means for haters to karma whore
---
Don’t think this was trump, pretty sure Latinos for trump did it on their own
---
wow, what an incredibly slow news day....
---
Yeah. Paying for a server is kind of expected if they're hosting them. But p2w is a problem.
---
Bruh, I think you’re missing the point.  Think “Union”.  Unions exist because there is power in a large number of people taking direct, coordinated action.
---
I think our friend here is trying to say that a unified message is the only message that will be heard.  And I completely agree.  This WILL become a trend if the gaming community doesn’t stand up against it.
---
not a problem if you are the only one on your server though
---
The broadsider is super useful when you put it away and use a harpoon with flechette instead
---
I haven't played since I was a little kid (and wasn't supposed to be playing it), so my memory of the earlier games is all I have to compare. Didn't play the first two before Youngblood, so I didn't realize this was a departure of the previous games.
---
We didn't have to replay any levels to grind our skills up, though several of the missions took us back through areas we'd already cleared.
---
They don't need to get the atoms back. Atoms aren't a real currency. If you never spend them, they have made the same amount of money.
---
Bethesda is probably making enough money, so the do not need a paid subscription service. But seeing as they want to make one anyway, at least it can be something that some really want, the chance to see if they can help; you know, "if you want something done, you have to do it yourself". And if it could be done for free, I would rather have that, but a company probably would find it more attractive getting paid for having work done for them. Your statement is correct, but you might be missing the point of me writing this post, it is to study the community reaction to an idea.
---
I believe the scrap bin locked to Subscribers is a mistake.  They should have made that and the mobile CAMP free for everyone.  The Scrap bin is a huge convenience.  My guess is Outer Worlds came out today and the subscription was an attempt by BGS to 'lock' the whales to the platform for at least 30 days/optimally 1 year.  To make it attractive, they added athe scrap bin, cosmetics, etc.... They really want a steady stream of income coming in and the 1st  subscription does that.  
---
I'm downloading Outer Worlds now as the reviews are stellar and this game is mostly bug-free. XBox Live for PC is dirt cheap and I'll defenitely be keeping that as long as it stays that way.
---
They probably wouldn't, for whatever reason, but I figured, since no one might have asked, they could at least be given a chance to consider the idea before we are told "no way". It should be free and harmless to ask questions, right?
---
Woosh :)
---
but i like the view :-(
---
And we are going to once the servers stabilizes, we've gotten kicked off like 10 times after they got up and running. 
---
It's just not very encouraging to come back to Reddit burning and a monetizing scheme that will make any /r/MLM fan want to join us, just to see what the fuzz is about.
---
well he has to since he is the face of Bethesda
---
I mean, why would they do that when they can charge their most loyal fans MORE for less?
---
Whales don't leave. They just migrate and come back to the same waters the next year.
---
The real dork
---
Don't feel bad, I'm getting the Subscription soon. I normally drop a $20 in the atom shop for camp stuff once a month. this isn't that much of a financial stretch for me. I don't pvp so I don't view it as pay to win either. I just want the additional perks since I generally solo the game.
---
I’m sorry, but your comment about people not complaining about Rockstar’s approach is wrong. Nearly everyone who likes the single player modes of GTAV and RDR2 are complaining, because Rockstar did **jackshit** with those modes after their Onlines dropped. I bet that if Bethesda were to take similar a approach, that they would also ignore possible single-player DLCs in favor of ways to further monetize online.
---
You make me happy im me, thanks
---
See this handmade? Alright? Old man gave me that when we came outta vault 76. Seen a lotta action. 5.56.. Safety always off. Told me he was proud of me once. Prick.
---
Yeah I like AJ but he never goes back to a game after release; he just does day one and done forever. Which means that he is probably the worst person to watch reviews on when it comes to MMOs and games that change vastly over time; his ESO video also has the same issue.
---
Why can’t I see the amount of upvotes / downvotes for this?
---
Money is why.
---
Yeah...I'm not buying any more bethesda/zenimax stuff any more.
---
Bloody legend
---
Funny you mentioned this. We were at the Combat Zone. 
---
A few bets, a few drinks and a whole lotta jokes. So I'm makin' friends, havin' a good time. Now Pete, he gets jealous, I mean, I can't blame him. It happens to me all the time! People just get upset that I’m so cool.
---
So this big idiot decides he's gonna challenge me to a drinking contest. Guess he figures he'll make me look like a fool in front of the nice folks that work at Bethesda.
---
So, he lumbers up to me, comes up to my table, tells me he could drink me UNDER the table. I'm like, "The HELL you can! Try me!" So, everybody gathers 'round, 'cause it's clear this is gonna be the COOLEST thing that happens all night, and we just go at it, just shot after shot after shot! Now the whole time, he's talking shit about me, I mean, telling me I'm gonna lose, telling me that I'm a piece of shit, telling me how he loves to fuckin’ steal other people’s money, all that stuff, and I'm just laughin', I'm laughin', I'm takin' my shots. Now, I'm so drunk, I mean, SO drunk, that it's crazy. 
---
Later on, Todd came up to me and was like "Man, you were so amazing! I didn't even know how you could still be standing! I never seen anyone drink that much!" **He loses his mind, you know. He’s excited.**
---
So after a while, I see that fuckin’ Pete startin' to get wobbly, right? Like, he's not gonna last much longer. And I keep thinkin’ about all the lies he told at the E3’s and how much of a fucking scumbag he is. But, like, I take a minute to make sure I'm not so drunk that I'm just seein' shit, but I'm right it's him! He is wobbly so I push through it, man! I knuckle down, and I keep takin' shots! At this point I don’t remember his name. Doesn’t matter anyway, shut up. 
---
Finally, ***he just goes face-first into the table!*** **Out cold!** *No question!* And I'm so pumped up, **I pick this guy UP!**
---
#I kid you not! I shit you not! I picked him right up, lifted him right over my head, totally raged out, and just, BAM! Slammed him back down onto the floor right on top of his fucking head, and I'm screamin' 
---
#"YEAH, MAN! YEAH! WHO'S THE BEST!? WHO'S THE BEST?! WHO'S THE BEST?!"
---
And then Todd comes over, he looks me in the eye, and he's like "Oh man! You blew all the blood vessels in your eye, man! That's totally messed up! *That's SO COOL!"* You are the ***REAL DEAL.*** 
---
Then everyone cheers even more, and I was so pumped up, I didn't even feel it! 
---
And everyone's all like;
---
#"YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR REDEYE!"
---
#Swear to you, true story, all of it, every word.
---
#It was pretty great, you shoulda been there!
---
Wtf is this post
---
i though hines stop posting after last year 76 launch?
---
And you gotta pay for it.
---
I think we need to give the game another 10 hours or so before we even start talking about using more money on it. 
---
That being said, we played ESO together, solved the main questline etc. We played 150 hours or so over 400 months and after the first month, we ended up subscribing to get fluff and the crafting bag.
---
But no matter what we do I cannot be mad about Bethesda being capitalist, I mean come on, you don't become a player in any industry without doing some min-maxing. We live in a capitalist society after all.  
---
I do however get angry when I get lied to. And Bethesda's lies are getting close to abuse.
---
I realize this now, but thank you :)
---
Anything for a fellow Raider.
---
That was really rude my bad. You've probably been following this subreddit for a while and keeping up with the drama. It just seems like there's a lot of non-players making all of these negative posts lately
---
yeah even at..say 30 bucks for the armor on the atom shop it still would be better then paying 100 a YEAR for it. vs just a one time price.
---
Hey vomit - you really are a sick fuck.
---
He's paid to talk theae games up, even if he's not the lead developer behind them
---
I'm just a prisoner in the same prison as you
---
One could
---
Buy a multiplayer game then pay more money to play it solo. ya can't make this shit up
---
The publisher is the one in control of the game? Not Bethesda game studios in Maryland, the studio currently working on Starfield, TES 6 and Fallout 5
---
my thoughts: i love private servers :-p
---
(as long as you have no one on your friends list right now to enter without asking lol) they absolutely just work.
---
and i was wrong to post earlier that it was a scam and that they dont.  (i deleted that post i made before hand)
---
Yes to the budget. I mean what the hell. There’s potentially no one else in there or far fewer that would free up the loading limitations.
---
I'd love to visit, but that 4 hour drive on winding roads is a bit much. Some day!
---
Shh, no, getting wasted, backpacks and a battle royale mode are definitely a year's worth of content for an exclusively multiplayer game with numerous MTX!
---
You're implying that not only has someone gotten ahold of the IPs of all of the private servers some how, but also that Bethesda has no DDoS protection at all? Defending against them is incredibly easy. All you have to do is make it so that if an influx of packets is received from a specific address or group of addresses then they are blocked or throttled.
---
When the winds of shit come howling from r/trailerparkboys
---
I'm sorry lmao I found this far too amusing
---
it likely is a glitch.  that hopefully will be fixed....or...do you have any friends in your friends list? apparently they can enter private servers if they are members without asking.  so it may be they did and killed them before you could get there.   
---
this is going to hopefully be fixed (soon) TM.......but i have no friends lol so i have not noticed any such issues yet for me.. but i am not at the nuke stage just yet.    more people who have an empty friends list might want to test that out and see if they run into the same issue. 
---
so far i have been very happy with private servers. they work like they should (aside from the friends list bug) and to me is def worth the subscription (some report they actually make the game more stable too by releaving server strain if your the only one on it)
---
I've personally been really confused by this.  WoW requires buying every expansion and a constant, more expensive subscription to play (similar for a lot of MMOs).  GTA Online has put out "free" content that is gated behind mobile game levels of microtransactions.  Hell, even ESO costs slightly more for the same content.  Yeah ESO also gives you DLC and expansions for subscribing, but 76 gives that for free.  The only thing I understand is the disappointment in the lack of content, to be honest.
---
You would also think they would have secured the Fallout 1st domain lol but that's lowhanging fruit
---
I am not pretending not to like the game. I did convince my wife to give it a go with me and hope we will have at least 100 hours of fun hiking the A.T. after all. 
---
But I am mad at Bethesda for lying and discouraged by the discussions in the sub.
---
I really, really hope Bethesda doesn't let the game die because no matter how trashy they are behaving they do have an absolutly unique product hear. 
---
The concepts for this game is my definition on how like my games to be, but that just makes it more hurtful when the devs behave like shady street vendors.
---
That wasn't an answer.
---
Well then you are the problem man.  Giving your money to this greedy company.
---
Actually, sorry I don't have any kind of link for this, but a dev for a different game (I want to say it was PlanetSide) commented once about the effects of digital currency. Their accountants were basically driven nuts by it cause each one basically counts as debt the company owes. They aren't cashed in and might not ever be so they represent a kinda outstanding commitment that is hard for them to plan around.  
---
Without a link it is hard to explain properly but they are an issue for them.
---
Bethesda is working on the game. Not Zenimax. Zenimax is just their publisher.
---
200 levels and I've never launched a nuke.  I've collected so many pieces of code to avoid that stupid noise tho.
---
Not at all. Why would they buy a domain they dont use? Fallout 1st is sold on Bethesda.net or the respective system website.
---
Exactly, the direction they are going. They have managed to walk a fine line when it comes to delivering on their announcements and the like. Monetizing features and soon mods isn't something I can get behind.
---
some people thrive looking like idiots
---
16 times the detail
---
What do you mean just a game? Imagine if someone did this is in any other hobby. I was going to complain to the skii resort because some drunk guy instead of grooming the paths plowed them. But its only skiiing right? I only commit several ours to this every weekend its not like its as important as a full time job. I have friends and a community for racing on occasions it doesn't matter they are fucking this shit up... 
---
You realize your hear looking for some validation being dismissive and downplaying the importance of a hobby other people care about. This is the dumbest fucking concept on the internet. "It's just a game" like its self evident that these things should be unimportant. Its not just a game, its a hobby, one you might share with a significant other and dedicate a significant portion of time to. One that you know.. might come online and talk about in a reddit post if its something you care about THAT much. Any one on this channel already stepped beyond its just a game, their relationship with it is more involved.
---
Honestly the whole thing was just a step to far for me. I deleted the game and i dont intend on downloading it again. I saw the sneaky shit they were pulling from the start with the repair kits and i get that "ThEy NeeD MoNEY tO KeEp ThE GaMe GoIng" but i just wish it had some content repetitive dungeons and bullet sponge boss fights are not really substantial content to begin with. When they announced npcs i stuck around only to watch them put more functionality stuff behind pay walls and then delay the one thing that everyone was hyped for just to give up pay to play private servers! I know that this is going to offend some one complaining about the aggressive monetization of a game they want to be good will always make someone butt hurt but still i dont like it and im leaving. If i had to say one thing it would be dont give in to apologist or the lies Bethesda is feeding you they are not using you mony to plug any holes in that sinking ship so you better jump off while you can.
---
Disagreed. It's like a mix of New Vegas and KOTOR II
---
it would be nice if they limited pay to win stuff (including unlimited stash) to private servers only.
---
some may further gripe with that but......private servers would have more resources since they are both private and less people per world plus opening the door for mods as well.
---
perhaps eventually what they should do is have SEPERATE saves for private servers vs public ones.
---
that way there is no pay to win.  and that really is what needs to be done perhaps with an OPTION to copy over your public server character to the private servers (But not the other way around)
---
they really do need to do something like that if they plan to add FULL mod support eventually to private servers.  
---
we shall see.
---
i love private servers tho and i think its a step in the right direction and for me worth the subscription for now.
---
why are you talking about things you dont understand?
---
yay for private servers ;-)
---
Most die hard fallout fan are single player fans. The big differences I'd i get to choose what i want to play now and yes i would pay for it, I'm already 45.00 ahead of player who paid 60.00 so that little bit isn't going to hurt
---
the private servers: a plus and totally worth a subscription:
---
the camp /armor/stash.
---
not.
---
One of those slanted walls only attaches to slanted roofs.  I believe it is for if you want a slanted roof a little higher or lower than another slanted roof without a base wall.  Never have found another use for it.
---
no i like fallout 76 and loving private servers
---
despite major issues.
---
its like the washington metro. it has MAJOR issues
---
but i like it
---
The publisher has control over methods in which the game is delivered, ie. Microtransactions, subscription services, etc
---
And to anyone saying "But he's supporting bad practices!" Guess what? If you're in-game to see OP in their ranger armor, *so are you!* There are only two non-hypocritical responses to everything that's happening; keep playing and *don't* take your anger out on other players, or uninstall. Simple as that people.
---
I cant believe how many screws i have been able to collect, cant wait to flood the public market and sit back and watch the economy burn..(insert sinister laugh) just kidding its just nice not to run out of shit well worth the price to me
---
You're part of the problem and people like you ruin gaming for others by enabling these business practices. Nobody has anything against you personally, likely. Your ignorance however, that's something anybody can be and is entitled to be hostile towards. Ignorance and arrogance like yours means more companies get away with locking content behind additional transactions. Instead of whining about how you're a victim in all this, open your eyes and acknowledge what you're doing is only contributing to the downfall of a glorious medium of entertainment. 
---
You don't *get* to play the victim. You don't *get* to be upset about being targeted. *You're* part of the problem.
---
You access the menu by bending over and grabbing your ankles.
---
its one single dude who is all over this thread. hes obviously hurt about how no one else bends over with him, so he needs to pretend its not a big deal.
---
its probably because he spent money on the subscription, sees all the rage here, and now reacts in an infantile way. typical hardcore supporter. bethesda hardcore fans are crazy like this
---
Corporations buy domains like that all of the time. It's critical, especially when people are being critical of the company. For instance, there's no "bethesdasucksdotcom", "Toddhowardblowsdotcom" etc and if you did a domain lookup you would probably find they own them.
---
The games not actually buggy. It's just so detailed that it has a FOURTH dimension
---
yeah the anger is a bit overblown . private servers DO work (if you have no one in your friends list ..as that part is bugged currently) but otherwise it does work like it should and actually changes the feel a lot for me.  (plus i hear seems to make the game more stable actually too) 
---
the pay to win elements and the glitchy nature of the rushed release yes = anger BUT they already said they would look into and i am sure likely soon (TM) fix at least the gliches of hungry hungry stashbox and the private server issues.
---
the pay to win stuff. eh.....if they limited that to private servers only (citing more resources for the private server and less players per private server) id totally get that.  
---
private servers should eventually have separate charecter saves (that you can copy from main but not vice versa)  more so if they add full mod support to them in the future.
---
guy is a con artist and gives gamers a bad name..,
---
he should give them the domain for free..,
---
he just wants attention and glory..,
---
it's the kind of shit people do to extortion money.., only in this case it's fame..,
---
it's the same shit as when the creator of Harlem shake took down pai's meme video..,
---
this is not how we show Bethesda and companies what we want..,
---
it just stabs everything we stand for in the back..,
---
The Emotes are not in Atomic Shop before buying Fallout 1st. I am not paying simply to know what I am paying for.
---
falls under parody
---
That too! Or maybe one of the guns from Hoover dam!
---
P
---
it is routine practice for companies to register domain names for new products and services before they are launched, precisely for the reason that's in this article.
---
I can't say that I'd be too disappointed if everyone who'd rather be watching a 19 yo blonde on snapchat departed. Answering the question "Are you a girl?" 900 times gets pretty old pretty fast &amp; that's just the tip of the iceberg. :P
---
this is not the way to do things.., this paints all gamers in a bad light..,
---
this kind of tactic is used by com artists.., and if we really want the message to get through.., we cannot rely on this..,
---
again.., remember how it hurts people to abuse yt copyright.., but people still did it to Paul's video..,
---
this won't win anything.., and they are after fame..,
---
How far is the Hoover dam? I am not very good with American Geography
---
Thanks so much &lt;3 I respect your passion for the game and understand that it's passion that drives us sometimes. I am still holding out hope that 76 will be the game I desperately want it to be at some point, but in the meantime we have a true successor to new vegas and I am STOKED.
---
It's a prestigious jingle and cool robot dance.
---
On the other side of the country. I'll pm you a photo of one of the guns
---
I don't think it could be worst. One is overcharging for a unfinished product. One is slapping democracy in the face.
---
Thanks
---
Just two extra emotes?
---
You realize that Bethesda is the publisher of Fallout 76 right?
---
Do you believe this applies to Rockstar and Take Two also?
---
Just keep the inventories separate entirely. It's unfair on poor people otherwise. Adding legendary weapons to the shop would be terrible but if they are coming, they should not be allowed in regular worlds.
---
Love it.
---
Why would he ever give it up for free
---
That's the marketing/business brilliance. The content is \****free\**** as far as they are concerned. Want features like the Fridge, just buy them with the \****free\**** Atom points you can get in game. Don't have any left, don't worry there are lots of Daily and weekly rewards to help with that!
---
The marketing is quite well done because they know full well it's unrealistic for a large percent of the user base to utilize this, so just buy Atom to speed things up.
---
It's too bad we're all only seeing this plan unfold now. I would have just passed on this one if I knew this was the way it was going, as I'm sure a large number of people would have as well. Transparency would have gone a long way on this whole mess, if we knew what we were buying a lot of people wouldn't be so bothered as they could have made a much better informed choice.
---
Bloody legend.
---
Yes
---
Silence, cringe wizard
---
They need to recoup lost revenue due to developing post launch content for free. In previous Bethesda Fallout games you would have post launch expansion that cost 20+ dollars a piece, now you get the content for free. There has to be some kind of trade off. Personally I wish we would go back to paid expansions and everything else comes with the game, from cosmetics to all the utility items. Unfortunately no one wants to pay for content anymore.
---
Some people have mics but don't leave them on by default. I'm one of them, cuz I'm not always in the mood for "Are you a girl?" and related (or worse) behavior.   
---
I didn't get the impression the OP was talking about on-mic commentary, though, vs private messages...
---
Bioware was doomed when they shook hands with EA and did that day 1 exclusive content bullshit for ME3
---
&gt;had some content repetitive dungeons
---
I kind of Tower Defense dungeon could be fun. Have something you would have to defend, allow people to gather resources locally to build stuff, while at the same time making "towers" that slow-down/damage/whatever the hoards of enemies.
---
Make the rewards increasingly worthwhile the longer it goes on, and bam, repetitive fun content.
---
"Man, there's a dead rat in my soup, but I can't be angry about it, because there are starving children in Africa!"  
---
The existence of other, worse shitty things does not make your shitty thing any less shitty. Yes, all of those things you listed are serious issues, and worth getting upset over. So is this one.
---
Don't forget mods, you won't be able to use them with out that subscription. Might not even be able to get them with out Atom for that matter.
---
Maybe should we stop blaming Bethesda and blame the true enemy, Zenimax?
---
Except to do so we have drained the resources from those weaker than us to sustain our growth. We have advanced as a culture at the price of eating up the growth of others.
---
Its funny how after most of our wars we have a sudden economic boom. 
---
Capitalism is great because it gives us reason to not care about stepping on the heads of others. You **earned** the right to step on heads because you work harder than they do and therefore deserve what you worked for and if others were smart they would be doing the same thing! 
---
It's a system designed to funnel money up and its plain to see. One of my closest friends is currently working 3 different jobs simply to make ends meet.
---
Capitalism is what is turning Bethesda into what they are. They played nice until  the numbers said they didnt have to anymore and under capitalism that's the next logical step because according to the numbers that is what will keep things growing. 
---
Capitalism is a big factor in why we meddle so much in foreign affairs, cant let another country make a decision that will effect our bottom line can we? Let's just get rid of all these democratically elected leaders and replace them with dictators because the dictator is easier to control and make money off of.
---
Dont even get me started on our wars. Are you aware we might currently have US troops guarding poppy fields in the middle east right now? Not like the opioid epidemic started after we decided the middle east needed some freedom.
---
There's literally nothing they can say that would make things better in the slightest, and many things that would make it worse. They should be silent, it's in their best interest.
---
The article states:
---
&gt;"I would like to sit down with [Fallout creator] Todd Howard and have a constructive discussion
---
Tood Howard didn't create Fallout, [Brian Fargo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fargo) did.
---
The only thing [Todd Howard](https://falloutfirst.com/) has accomplished is to lie, cheat and steal from gamers and flush an amazing franchise down the shitter.

---
I updated the description with some additional issues with it.
---
It's not about quality, it's about how much Fallout game it is. And BoS it's the least Fallout game that ever had Fallout logo on box. That's what makes it worst Fallout game, not ratings.
---
You don't deserve the insults but you do deserve the target you painted on your back
---
yeah, but the battlefront devs actually care about the game
---
Right but capitalism normalizes these things and has built in ideas to mentally distance yourself from the decisions you make in face of the potential gain.
---
Sure under capitalism our society has advanced at a much faster speed, but at the cost of crippling those around us.
---
The folks who no-life the game are probably happily getting on playing with their Fallout1st subscription, a lot of my twitter friends are \*shrug\* 
---
If anything, I would have thought the more casual players would be affected.
---
No, hes confusing the idea of dedicated servers and resource management. These are explicitly dedicated servers. If no one is using them the server instance is stopped. Fallout First advertiser workshop persistence... which means you get your own dedicated world basically. Your friends can join you but they can't join the server directly.
---
Basically what he's saying is wrong. The servers are dedicated and persistent. The only limitation is the one built in to make sure non Fallout 1st members aren't given access to the persistent private server. You can't give them a link to enter it at will... you have to be there for them to join it. 
---
Secondly... there are definitely things that would have made it to the game, like p2w and loot box mechanics if not been for a very vocal community. And p2w is partially implemented, in both this fallout 1st with a very beneficial scrap storage, and other buyable gameplay enhancements.
---
Just started last night! Already in love with it
---
I laughed hard at the fact that they needed to state David was on the left and Vault-boy was on the right. HAHAHA
---
Lol Im on Conan Exiles at this moment. Judging by the look of the things, I wont be coming back to Fo76 for a while.
---
At this point I need to stock up on popcorn.
---
You fucking deserve it.
---
Yeah, I agree that people need to speak up, I'm shocked that this isn't downvoted to hell TBH, normally all I see in this sub is anyone being negative gets screamed out of the place or simply ignored. EVERY TIME SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS IT IS GOOD TO SPEAK OUT, OTHERWISE NOTHING WILL EVER HAPPEN.
---
Isn’t it like 12$ a month? 100 is for the year.
---
did you find the witch? I can't find it anywhere
---
I've played ESO since 2015. They have done absolute wonders to that game. What they have done to get from where they started to where they are at is what gave me hope that FO76 would get sorted out, I didn't buy 76 because I figured it be a rough start and I could pick it up later on sale with a DLC pack and the game would be in a better state. I am no longer hopeful for that or the next ES. Fucking sucks as I own every FO and ES game (save the obscure phone ES games) but this shit has even made a fanboy like me pass.
---
I'm not seeing looted corpses, but I'm definitely seeing corpses around. Also loose world junk that I know I haven't touched in days is not present either in these areas.
---
Your statement is really sensitive to opinion.  You see a rat, I see not enough salt.   Plus, I think finding a dead rat in your soup is kind of a bonus food when you're trying to compare it to the starving kid in Africa trope. 
---
A better analogy is comparing triple A gaming industry to the Wal-Mart, Target, Costco types.  Some cost a membership to get things more cheaply, some repeatedly give you salmonella and a large medical bill.
---
No. I saw someone post it’s in the shop next week, not on the Halloween bundle.
---
In all honesty I have to say this; you vote with your wallet. You give them money for this, you support it. People should not be harassing you or being violent about it, but I'm sure as hell going to voice my opinion that you're just supporting their model. If you're fine with that / know that then ok, cool. We have different opinions and feelings, but I have just as much right to say what I have as you to say and do what you did.
---
ah. thanks
---
Alright, while Bethesda has to be accountable for this 100%. The chain of command would be Bethesda Game Studios at the bottom, ran by Todd Howard. Then Bethesda Softworks, which has Pete Hines and owning both of those you have ZeniMax Media, who is always silent in everything.
---
If ZeniMax is the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, which is the parent company of Bethesda Game Studios, then ZeniMax ultimately has all the say so in everything. Whether they actually push out their say-so's is a different story.
---
What gets me is that since ZeniMax is always mysteriously silent, are Todd and Pete actually lying? Or is ZeniMax pushing something that Todd and Pete originally didn't want.
---
***I'll say this again, I am in no way defending Fallout 1st or any of these actions***
---
But are we pointing fingers at the people ZeniMax would want us to point fingers at? To say Todd and Pete are liars, while could be true, but could also not be true. Todd and Pete could've never wanted Fallout 1st. They could've also wanted Fallout 76 to come out at a later date with more content but ZeniMax pushed the Atom Shop, pushed Fallout 1st and pushed Fo76 release date to sell for the holidays. Don't get me wrong, Todd and Pete could've just as easily lied about all this. But it's extremely easy for a parent company to do something greedy and not be blamed for it, but rather the developers who created the game. 
---
A good example is EA. Everyone knows that EA ruined a lot of games and EA is the parent company. They forced Command &amp; Conquer to be horrible garbage and Mass Effect too. But people jump on Bethesda and not ZeniMax?
---
With how bad this backlash is, it'd be suicide for Bethesda to NOT take Fallout 1st back since even IGN is making fun of them. So, if they don't take it back or attempt to make amends, my money is on ZeniMax controlling this situation since ruining the Fallout IP with a subscription for a incomplete buggy game would be horrible, since Bethesda's other big game is Elder Scrolls whereas ZeniMax has other studios to leech money from. Bethesda shooting themselves in the foot over their biggest IP just doesn't make sense.
---
I'll say it a third time ***I'M NOT DEFENDING THESE ACTIONS MADE*** but rather think about who is actually making these decisions.
---
Cash shop is only cosmetic and you can buy any of it with in game gold so it's really not that bad. The sub is somewhat a necessity because of the crafting bag but that's about it. It's a great game and leagues ahead of what they first put out.
---
&gt; I'm not going to keep arguing by pulling specific points out of your reply, but Oblivion came out in 2007. Facebook was just starting to gain traction at that time. It hadn't even been live to the public for more than a year or so. If we're going to stretch for points like that, we might as well say online poker did it first. I don't care about what was going on behind closed doors at gaming companies. I care about who was one of the first to make it go mainstream.
---
&gt; 
---
My point is that your statement that they were "essentially" the first to INVENT microtransations is completely wrong. As I've pointed out, microtransactions was around in the 90s. They didn't invent squat. They simply jumped on the bandwagon of what others were doing. Just because it's the only thing you were aware of at the time does make it so. Anyway, you're right, it's silly to continue this discussion.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
I think the real linchpin here for most everyone is Wastelanders and how it will turn out.
---
I love me them private servers
---
I see it fine - 0 points, 22% up.
---
Same here. Im spending my time on Conan Exiles at this moment. Fo76 doesnt progress anymore anyway. Nothing really new and interesting hasnt poped out since the release. No point to play anymore.
---
Fuck me. I've stuck around on this sub for many months after uninstalling in the slim hope that *maybe one day* Bethesda will get their shit together and make this game worth coming back to. But every once in a while I hear news, and every time it just *absolutely fucking boggles my mind* how far in the polar opposite direction of "good" they keep managing to go. At this point I'm not just pissed about my $60, I'm fucking *mournful* that my once-favorite dev studio has evidently turned into a rotten, smelly husk of its former self, that not only *still* can't make a stable piece of software to save their lives, but has somehow completely lost all ability to design compelling gameplay systems, *and* turned into a cash-grabby whore the likes of which would make EA blush.
---
Hey Bethesda, you need some extra cash flow? Sell me a fucking Utility Item™ that fires whoever the hell has been in charge of this clusterfuck of a game and uses their bloated salary to hire a few engineers who have fixed a bug before
---
I think it's a VERY vocal minority that are toxic, I dislike how they've massacred my fallout, but I'm not sending death threats. Lot's of people on both sides, BUT there are IMO only a few that are openly hostile/violent and threatening. Plus threatening people is illegal AF, we'd see more of it in the news as they got their fodder to claim how games cause violence.
---
Absolute unit

Some of the people I game with in 76 *are* parents of teenagers. :P
---
please do not get your word definitions from star trek or fictional characters named spock
---
it is rational to be upset about deception
---
There are dedicated permanent servers. Your literally renting one, as advertised its persistent with workshops.
---
They do not generate new instances of the "map". They spin up an instance of the server when players log on. Its and ON DEMAND server model. If a server is not needed it stops. When you rent one of the dedicated servers... your getting a dedicated server to play on (virtual but that is basically 100% of servers these days). It saves persistent data for your usage, so each time an instance is spun up for you, your getting your previous state restored to play in.   
---
The only thing for this that needs to be reworked to make it more traditional.. is add a front end server id for your friends to log into so they can go and play with your workshops. There is no TECHNICAL reason your friends couldn't spin up your dedicated world.
---
I literally wrote 1 year subscripion and you are missing the point. The Sceapbox could have been in the game from Day 1. That was my point.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals is that way!
---
If people can't complain on the Fallout 76 subreddit then they shouldn't be allowed to praise it either .
---
Ok- there has been hundreds of posts making the same point. We get it you don’t like it. Don’t buy it- move on with life.
---
If they do that, expect more people to slate them they need to do something pretty major
---
No you wouldnt have.
---
Fa real. Did it raid today and everything was so smooth
---
Let's hope Bethesda learn their lesson and try to..
---
Ah, cross-play must happen!
---
No its not. Reddit is both a very tiny but very loud fraction of the player base. Its also infested with astroturf campaigns.
---
There really is a huge toxicity problem
---
I honestly don't know what Karma is, I know it exists but not what it is for.
---
Believe it or not but some people are fascinated by how other people think and there reasoning for it.
---
Take this for example. When I read through the answers I don't see many people focusing or trying to defend the controversy the game have had. The bag that was falsely advertised etc.
---
Why? I do not know, the reason can be many. 
---
But the common theme is that they enjoy playing it and even if they don't agree with Bethesdas actions they feel that it won't effect them. No one is thinking about any consequences it could have on future games, that if Bethesda see that people keep playing or keep spending money on it that they will keep going in the same direction and as I see it "get away with it". with false advertising, bugs etc. Or people do not mention it anyway.
---
And that is fine everyone think differently but I think it is important to understand or at least get a picture of how other think.
---
\^ nailed it
---
&gt; Then there would be zero downside to hoarding ALL junk you find. 
---
So what? Then people could just play instead of inventory manage all the time.
---
How good is it mate?
---
Interesting. I'll look that up. Thanks.
---
Group 3: People are saying things I disagree with on reddit!
---
Groups 1 &amp; 2: Let the adults speak.
---
Yes. This is the future of this game. Unplayable public servers and lag free private sesions on recycled servers.
---
You're getting blamed, rightly so, because you are the problem. As long as you and all those like you continue to reward game companies they will continue to get worse and worse. And here's a little something for you to ponder. I used to work for one of the top 10 AAA companies. My last role was as a Producer. I can tell you with absolute certainty they don't care about you one bit other than what money they can get out of you. They only care about their Wallstreet masters. EVERYTHING was about ensuring you hit the ship dates in order to make the quarterly earnings for the stock prices. Wake up and see it for what it is. They don't deserve you being loyal or defending them.  They view in as an addict and treat you like one.
---
How about no. This game has been out for a while now and people know about how much of a shit heap it is. If players still pour money into it they deserve every shit patch Bethesda makes and the ridicule they get for enabling this behavior.
---
Breaking: Outsider with little involvement and understanding of the community tells them how it really is. News at 11.
---
Bethesda's core audience is now cosplayers.
---
They don't care about intriguing storylines or fun gameplay mechanics.
---
Now it's all about cats with bowties and bigfoot tenpin bowling.
---
If you think 8$ a month is a wallet fucking, you must not have a job. Like no job at all.
---
This feels like it should be a reply to someone's post. No offence. Otherwise it's kind of like you're just arguing with an imaginary proposition.
---
PRAISE..
---
In Fortnite's defense, they have a slightly larger consumer base than FO76.
---
Totally understand, but Steam is to blame for being undercut.  I got Epic for BL3 and now have Outer Worlds on it.  Since then they have given free games all the time.  I have 3 Batman games, Metro 2033 Redux, and a bunch of others for frickin free.  They are going out of their way to bring competition to Steam.
---
Lets see, I have Steam, Epic, Bethesda, Rockstar, Uplay, and probably a couple more launchers that I'm not remembering.  I'm not going to be loyal to Steam and not play other games, that is crazy talk.
---
Incorrect, not using recycled worlds. Idiots just dont know how the game works and think they can server hop to refill containers when it has never worked that way since the patch. Outside of events like Lode Bearing, that is. The dead enemies is a bug where they die when they load in.
---
It's sad that all the people who have some understanding of databases has known this for months and have been downvoted to hell or ignored whenever they've posted/commented about it.
---
Same too with those that said that Bethesda is lying to you that they can't restore your lost items/characters in most cases.
---
Better that people are getting it at all now but would have been nicer if they'd gotten it sooner.
---
Yes it is.
---
Finally Indiana gets mentioned
---
Why did you subscribe may I ask? What was the main thing that swayed you to pay them 13 a month for a broken game with no further DLC announced?
---
I'm OK with them charging for servers, what about my comment made you think otherwise.
---
Cunt.
---
I'll argue it to internet death!
---
Swing speed ftw!
---
Someone that doesn't play the game knows more about the game than the people that play the game. Got it. Seems legit.
---
Exactly. 
---
And to repair, the t-60 just need some steel, plastic and Alu.
---
But to be honest, since I use the luck perks to get repair shots and repair hits, I don’t really have to care in repair costs anyway.
---
I'm reluctant to suggest any more ideas of mine to this forum, if you must make suggestions, please make sure to let them know it should be free.
---
&gt;And if you see someone say it once do you really need to say it 6 times?
---
If this was the case we wouldn't need slippery when wet floor signs, warnings that coffee is hot and shouldn't be pounded down like a cold soda and half the other shit on this planet that only exists because people are to stupid to listen to the initial advice they receive.
---
I guarantee you that in a month or so there are going to be outraged players wanting to know why their checking account shows another charge being automatically deducted when they hysterically screech that they only paid for a month.
---
I actually believe that Bethesda intends to fix each and every bug in this game.  🤥
---
76 is in a league of its own, on release it was more bug than game.
---
It seems like this sub believes that the majority of people playing the game purchased it at full price &amp; thus that $60 should be sufficient to fund ongoing development for the next 3-5+ years in the future. But I'm curious where that opinion comes from. Is there publicly accessible data / market research somewhere indicating that most active players paid $60?+   
---
Like many games over the years, I paid nothing for Fallout and I've played it for hundreds of hours. I've typically lived with at least 1 other person and at times as many as 7-8+ roommates. We usually haven't all purchased our own separate copies of games. I've been sharing my games &amp; game library since I was a kid.   
---
I would assume that there are quite a few other people who have access to play the game and didn't buy it at its full retail price. I don't plan on subscribing to the paid service, but even if I did, I'd have to be a subscriber for 5 months before Bethesda would even have gotten the full retail price of the game, let alone any additional profit. And buying stuff from the atom shop is more fun than buying a second copy of a game that you already have access to play.
---
All businesses are based on cash flow. If the company isn't making money they won't produce a product. Sorry, but things in life aren't free.
---
You played for nearly a full year. You’ll be alright :)
---
If people are actually that stupid that they have to be told how subscriptions work they deserve to be blown away with the fact that they got charged again.
---
This happens all the time. Even if you had a fresh World and no one had run it prior to you nuking it can still happen. All just dead, exactly at thier spawn points or frozen with no hit boxes
---
Is it possible to be a bigger bethesda shill? GTFO ith "more quests". Fucking audio logs. One queest in Fallout 4 is like 20 quests in F76 content wise.
---
Reddit is a bastion of gimme gimme losers that always want free shit. Ive had as much fun fucking with them for the last two days as I have enjoying the private server and unlimited junk. 
---
The most hilarious part is when you say something that you know is at l;east partially wrong, and instead of looking it up they go on this mental gymnastics rampage to try and defend their position. My face and stomach has actually hurt from laughing at these idiots.
---
That's good to know. Makes me want to get the membership. I can only spray her for a second or 2 with my exploding plasma with out crashing
---
Thats is it. They destroyed fo76.
---
Agreed, well said. I love 76 and never had any interest in private servers. They cost money?? Guess people shouldn't pay for it then. Ill keep playing because its fun and it still has massive potential in the years to come
---
To be fair this same post has been made by about  39 different people now. It's getting really boring.
---
Always was.  Only difference now is that it's not all positive. ;)
---
They arent that hard to decrypt if you have the word you need.
---
I stopped reading at "I stopped playing after a month".
---
On public I'm the same way
---
Sorry to see you attacked like this and nobody deserves abuse from other players like this.
---
Overall this kind of monetization does not bother me very much. There are no loot boxes, nothing random about it, and you are getting exactly what you are trying to get. You get a private server (once that actually works correctly), some atoms every month, expanded crafting storage etc. 
---
This kind of monetization is also not paying for content so all the content is still available to everyone.
---
I have been discussing doing the same thing with some of my friends. The $100/year is a small cost and having a private server would be nice sometimes.
---
People need to move on or at least make another sub for all those posts
---
The problem isnt the Atoms. Its entitlement and instant gratification society.
---
Way easier just to look this weeks code up on google lol
---
^^ I like
---
I do not think that you or anyone else is onboard with everything they do. I'm sorry if my post came out this way, it was not my intention.
---
Playing something because you enjoy it is a good reasoning.
---
But even if you don't feel that it effects you, is there a line?
---
In my opinion for what I saw, the game came out unfinished. They falsely advertised some stuff or misled (I'm thinking about the bag and the Nuke cola bottle that looked like it was made out of glass but was plastic) and even if they patched an improved it do you not think they get away with bad behavior?
---
And if people buy it or keep spending money on it they do not change their way because they see that they get away with it.
---
Or even tho you don't spending any money on micro transactions companies will keep pushing the boundaries because they see that people buy the games anyway because of the hype and even tho everyone don't spending money on micro transactions they can still milk some of the players for more money.

For example exp boost in singleplayer games. Might not sound that bad because you don't have anything against the grind and you don't need to buy it. But what if they are designing the game so people feel that lvling is a bit slow but not enough so people get upset. So the exp boost is a temptation that hangs there in front of you.
---
Or that they make lvling more of a grind mid or late game so when people start to feel that it is bullshit it is to late to refund.
---
In my opinion I feel that some companies like Bethesdas for example is playing with designing games more like casino where everything is designing to make you spend money but give the feeling that it is your own choose.
---
If people want that it is fine, I will just not play the games. I just interesting in how other people think.
---
&gt; give us free trial periods for PTS 
---
PTS as in public test servers? If so, you do realise the purpose of these test servers are, right? To test things. So you want exclusive access to help Bethesda improve their game... for free...
---
Actually worse, you're talking free trial periods. So you're expecting players to pay for the privilege to test the game for Bethesda to help improve their game. Not get paid like a QA would doing the same but but we pay them?
---
Nice Strawman.
---
Now, are we gonna Tar and Feather it? Hang, Draw and Quarter? Or just chuck it on a bonfire, ready for Guy Fawkes night?
---
I mean, you spent all that time building it up, so how are you gonna tear it down this time?
---
Oh Jesus, will you guys ever stop freaking out. It's been for days now.
---
Speaking about transparency remember the statement they released about how they took the games development as for as it could go and needed us to literally break the game. Then called the "beta" the Break it Early Test, then when we broke the game half the players rage quit and couldn't believe the game was broken... i feel like the only one who actually paid attention and did a little research before the game released
---
What about stop hating and walk away?
---
I haven’t noticed any real lag on my server. Game runs better than I’ve ever seen it run. I am, however, on console (XB1) so I can’t speak for the other platforms.
---
Oof. Hold onto this thought and come back with it if Bethesda ever decides to go with paid DLC or season passes.
---
It's unfair because kids got no money to pay for it.
---
Haha, a special complaints sub would mean this one would become empty. 
---
I agree with the OP, but Bethesda read all these posts, they know they lied, they know we wanted this ages ago and free! They just don't care, they're cunts.
---
Best thing to do is just not pay for anything for this game unless you think its worth it.
---
The people paying for things like FO1st fund the free DLC for everyone else.
---
I was hoping for some whacky weapon plan like a gream reaper sickle or something...
---
I realllllly dislike Bethesda right now and think 76 has a billion issues but yes, If wastelanders is everything I want it to be I'd definitely come back.
---
Response time to features that cost money: a few days. 
---
Response time to PA related bugs that causes players to close the game to fix, lor when entire accounts are wiped in vault 94: Two months minimum.
---
My fault, should have mentioned I'm on Xbox too. So have you ever had a lag when switching weapons?
---
"Sorry Guys, we got ourselves Private Servers and we've all been playing on those the whole last week! Haven't seen any of the community feedback, just been having too much fun with these Fallout 1st Rewards! How you guys getting on?"
---
You ever hear of 21st Century Fox?
---
There's a reason the company still uses "20th Century."
---
This happens quite often, and sometimes years in advance.
---
I personally think it’s worth it once they fix the stash issue- I’ve been working a lot lately so haven’t had time to sit down and play since the fallout first came out- I’ll get some time Saturday to play with it tho. I joined fallout 76 when it was free for that weekend- really loving the game. I love all the fallout games (fallout two is my favourite tho) 
---
I really appreciate Beth bringing fallout back and back to life. There is only so many times you can get a mutated toe.
---
Pls leave the game again. Take the hate with you too little kid. If you dont like it , dont play it! Is that simple. Dont do this kid.
---
"Sorry Guys, we got ourselves Private Servers and we've all been playing on those the whole last week! Haven't seen any of the community feedback, just been having too much fun with all this Fallout 1st Premium Content!
---
How you guys getting on?"
---
It’s not about liking it. It’s about the fact Bethesda lied over and over and said that it couldn’t be done because of server stability.
---
I usually don’t get much on my One X. If you want to see how it performs, my GT is the same as my username and I’ll add you as a friend so you can run around for a little bit and see how it runs for you at no cost.
---
Actually it's not unlimited stash. It's only junk and it can't be bulk either
---
I found exactly one. It was admittedly a pretty big one - a CTD - but I found an easy fix and nothing has bugged out on me since. It's a delightfully bug-free game so far.
---
Maybe they figured it out and decided to Make cash on it. The majority of these people who claim to be quitting are still playing the game and will continue to do so- and pay. 
---
They most likely made a killing with fallout first. And they will make a killing with the next game.
---
Just bought this for my husband and I'm loving it. He hasn't even got to play yet.
---
People have said they only last about 20 minutes or so after they've logged off (no other 1st Players).
---
Might be longer, but they're not permanent.
---
It's definitely right to blame the people that keep giving money to companies after they keep doing this shit time after time, getting ever progressively worse. People keep supporting them with their money, so they have literally zero reason to change. Now, I don't think the players should be getting abusive, harassing messages, but they most assuredly do share in the blame.
---
Wait, you bought fallout 76 and anthem? Both of them.
---
I don’t think that’s not true. As OP said, the stack count doesn’t affect the stability, just the amount of items in the database itself. Whether you’ve got one gold scrap or 100, the data in the server stays the same. So they didn’t figure it out. 
---
And yeh you’re probably right. It’s people like you who are happy with what they’ve done, that are ruining the video game industry. The companies are taking your support and pushing it and pushing it. One day they’ll do something you don’t like, and you’ll feel this way too.
---
I haven’t had any issues switching between melee weapons. I also don’t get that melee glitch anymore where the first couple hits don’t seem to land. Everything runs smoother including events
---
Somebody I asked, said they last about 20 minutes, after logging out.
---
After that, either the server was wiped or they were placed on a fresh one.
---
Or maybe, bashing on something when it's popular to do so, gets you likes, views, subs, and karma even if you are not expressing your true views.
---
Game is 👌👌👌.
---
A nice "AA" title that really scratched that new vegas itch.
---
I won’t cry about it non stop on Reddit, I’d simply move on to another game or some thing. it’s just a game.
---
Then everyone's gonna forget about that game after three days. FO76 had a mistep yes but it'll be here still growing and earning money far after outerworlds is some $4.99 bargain bin game. Subscription from one month of F1st will probably out earn Outerworlds in it's entire "lifetime".
---
Thanks bro, gonna purchase it right now &lt;3
---
Nobody cares about reddit. Even if all of you stop playing the game it won't affect much. And you already bought it anyway
---
This right here.
---
What the battlefront devs have managed to do with that game is pretty amazing.
---
Plus I got my beloved clone commandos and tx-130 in game too.
---
Is that your main problem? On a forum dedicated to Fallout 76, people are still debating the single biggest thing to happen to the game, 3 days after it happened?
---
If you’re that sensitive you should probably quit Reddit. On a forum website, people are gonna...you know....**talk about stuff**
---
Seems like you are the one getting sensitive here bud. 
---
Maybe make another 8 posts about the 12$. Maybe you will feel better.
---
Several Event text is wrong. It's like they don't play their own game.
---
Not all negative portrayals are protected under parody. We have slander, libel, and defamation laws for a reason.
---
And for what it’s worth, I’m not defending Bethesda; someone suggested you can’t get sued if you’re not making money. That’s false. Someone else suggested you can’t get sued if you claim parody. Also false. Like I said, it would just come down to who has the better lawyers.
---
Downvote brigading me won’t change that, but whatever.
---
Eurgh. If 1986 is your birth year, I’m worried for the people around you if you’ve got to 33 and are still this petulant. Enjoy your day bud.
---
Hello sir this is Charles from the central Nigerian sweepstakes, i am happy to tell you, have won one million Ugandan dollars. Please send me your bank account details and sort code to arrange the payment sir
---
Grab er on Game pass if you are PC or xbox.
---
Unlike you I have things in life that doesn’t make the 12$ fallout thing a main thing in my life.
---
I feel sorry for you this is what is the main thing going on in your world.
---
&gt; Be careful! Youtuber fraudsters and demagogues are at the very least recycling other peoples old footage of bugs at launch and presenting it as the current state of the game.
---
Recycling other people's old footage of bugs at launch and presenting it as the current state of the game. Whether or not it's the main focus, that's still what's going on. Commentary channels of any kind generally show off some of their recent gameplay when talking about something like this, not from beta and launch week
---
I’m just having a shit and checking out Reddit man, why are you trying to belittle me? You’ve come onto this post (which you could’ve ignored) then you’ve commented moaning that people don’t like it, then you’ve had a pop at me and said my life is boring? Are you disabled? Do I need to exercise some empathy because you know no better?
---
Your "ooohs &amp; ahhhhs" line reminds me of Ian Malcom from jurassic Park...i guess after fallout 1st everyone is now running and screaming 😂
---
That it is!
---
Is it worh to pay 13 bucks to "solo the queen" and condoning with Bethesda perverse business model?
---
Same here. But I don’t know what to do with them. 
---
I get they launch nukes, but... I’m not sure how to use it to do so. 
---
Obvs, launching nukes is not a priority for me... :-D
---
Untrue, plenty of games allow you to host servers for free on your own hardware. The option to do so would be nice. 
---
That being said, if I were to pay for a private server, I'd expect it to actually BE a private server, not a reused public server
---
So, you're implying that public servers crashing is fine because you can always pay for a private server and have servers that don't crash?
---
Ha you're delusional, child.
---
reddit is full of bluepilled numales
---
I've only seen him once as well, he attacked my camp as I spawned in, I had no idea wtf was happening at first.
---
They are right you know?
---
This sub is just full of trolls looking to jump on the next bandwagon to bad mouth any decision Bethesda makes. I on the other hand, looked at it subjectively. Its a great deal, you get great benifits, you get the best deal on atoms, its not play to win, nothing I get gives me any direct advantage over anyone else. They did this with ESO and it overall benefited the players, community as I whole, and the company by bringing in a more constant and predictable source of income. Im sorry but what's not to like? People are mad because during this interview this one time this one guy said this and now its not completely what he said. Boo fucking hoo. People and company's change their minds sometimes for different reasons and may go different directions then they first thought. That's life. I'm still enjoying FO76, I'm enjoying it more now with FO 1st.
---
Don’t be so sensitive bud. Deep breaths.
---
I think they did after how this week panned out leading up to TOW's release.
---
Keep dreaming buddy. Fallout 76 is dead, if it was ever truly alive.
---
"ResistancesProportionalHealth" and "ResistancesInverseHealth" are such unnecessarily long identifiers. Surely they could find something easier to use than proportional and inverse. Most of the weapon effects are super simple, like CritSpeed or LessDamagePowerAttack
---
Haven’t played the game in 7 months and you just had to post about FO 1st 😂😂
---
Bethesda fanboy detected.
---
Still a problem in private worlds its just not as bad
---
Thanks. Did you ever get the lag on the normal public servers then? Xbox.
---
Tyvm I was passing on that question from the official boards.
---
I'll update it with your answer.
---
Omg there is so much hate on this sub right now. I'm 600 hours in for a game I paid 20 bucks for. I've paid much more for much less. 13 bucks isn't much if I get enjoyment out of it.
---
Yes they broke there promises I guess. But it's my money to do with what I want
---
Yeah, juicehead did a nice piece about how Zenimax is getting cash together to pay off some venture capital investment group.
---
This is honestly what I suspect. This subscription is *eerily* similar to ESO's subscription which we know is under one of Zenimax's child companies. I really wouldn't be surprised if Zenimax is the one trying to push all these monetization methods out and its costing these companies their reputation. We know Bethesda has a passion for their games And all these money grabbing methods seem to be rather bunched up. But again, I don't know the full story so I'm not about to make concrete assumptions.
---
Right Ok, wasnt sure if it was just my connection - bad internet, or if it was everyone that had this issue. It's really annoying, i use 3 different shotguns so switching between them to make use of the different effects can be really annoying during a fight.
---
Well it's worth it to do that AND get 16 dollars worth if atoms, have a private server, have infinite junk storage, get cool dance emotes, have access to unlimited workshop materials, have an extra fast travel point, and get exclusive apparel.
---
And a good part of those are people who don't play the game that are just coming over to farm karma by manufacturing anger. If you enjoy the game nothing's stopping you. I have a lvl 400+ character and never had stash limit issues since the cap was raised to 800, now I'm just using the stash to lug around scrip legendaries, all while having 1000 of each scrap I consider important. What was kind of funny was in all the negative videos I checked out for laughs was that all of the guys were your typical youtube shills with patreon and t-shirt shops, that don't even play the game and just echo the news article in a condemning tone. I think the average player honestly doesn't care, and clearly Bethesda has their own data that would support this. In a month people will forget about this, come back from their little vacations (they'll have to download the game again!) and we'll be back to status quo whether they like it or not.
---
Nope, never said anything like that my salty friend.
---
This guy earlier today was trying to tell me it was his first time playing 76 today, but his entire crappy camp was filled with nothing but atom shop items which arent even for sale anymore.
---
There was a video from one of the many youtubers covering this issue in which they tried to guess what else bethesda had upcoming in terms of games and there was nothing till march2020. 
---
When you also add the other two games bethesda released this year , Rage 2 and wolfenstien new blood, that bombed real hard, you can get this sense that hey this whole year was a disaster for Bethesda and shareholders are not going to be happy.
---
This is in my best guess, and i really hope this is true, bethesdas desperate attempts to get a cash infusion into the company or something. I say I hope this is true because i really want this company to face the music after what they did to a beautiful and beloved franchise and that it serves as a warning to other companies like EA to quit their bullshit already and stop making everything online .
---
Going from history no Studio which has pulled similar antics and pissed off most of their customers hasn’t gone well for them. Difference is though is that those Studios are changing their ways because the industry is changing and BGS is failing to change with it and will be left behind. 
---
Pulling a stunt like this is bad for business in the long run. Only got to look at the history of the industry to see that.
---
They sell it because you buy it. You are helping to actively ruin the game. It’s like giving a child a candy every time he throws a tantrum, your encouraging bad behavior. 
---
So yeah, people will get mad. Get ready to be less popular in your new armor, not more.
---
You are not renting a dedicated personal server... for fuck sake one of the first complaints people had when they started logging into these worlds was that there were areas that had already been cleared of junk or with dead enemies.  This is because when a world empties out the game doesn't just immediately unload it, there's a period during which another person has a chance to log in whether it's someone being assigned there as the first player of an adventure world or someone logging into a private world.  
---
Also no... there currently aren't persistent workshops, that's listed as a feature they're planning on in the future along with things like expanded build areas and increased camp budgets.  But even when they do add persistence to workshops that doesn't mean or require a dedicated persistent world.  The only reason workshops aren't persistent now is because unlike your camp the game doesn't save them and load them the next time you log in, all persistent workshops requires is treating every workshop like it's an additional camp and every time you log into a new version of your private world the game loads in all of the workshops you've built just like it loads in your camp.
---
Farmer Mr handy Incoming atom shop
---
No one said anything like that.
---
Maybe a little later as Wastelanders is bound to break everything. Again.
---
Same, it was fun until all the extra bullshit happened a few months ago. If you can pay for an advantage you can keep it. Fuck that game honestly and it’s still as broken as when it came out.
---
It’s a premium member ship type thing. You get unlimited stash for junk, atoms, a private server for you and 7 friends, a riot gear suit and some other stuff. It’s like 12$ a month or you can get yearly for like a 100$
---
I would just get true 12$ month see if you like it before committing to a year myself
---
I knew from the get go that this game engine was never meant for multiplayer, or optimized or however you want to call it. They even talked about it at the beginning. Seeing the game run on a private world solo really proved it. Everything runs better. I’ve done a few events that were meh before and suddenly hordes are spawning like they should, timers update properly, event stages working as intended. It’s a different world. I’ll give them credit for making a single player engine work with 24 people at all, and also I feel bad about it. What if it was a newer engine meant for this? What if this could have been the way the game ran since the beginning? Lost chances, I suppose.
---
If you ever do decide to visit the States its definitely a good place to see mainly because you get to experience and form opinions for yourself on what the rest of the country would just right off as a bunch of people that sleep with their sisters, cook meth and harass any minority that is in the general area. Not always in that order and sometimes all at once. 
---
Sure you'll come across assholes, but a lot of people there would be excited to meet someone not from the States and answer questions/give you ideas on where to go to have a fun time.
---
Yes, and people like him help drive these hidden costs and fees for players up. In a way, these people make the game more expensive for everyone else.
---
Fair point but I don't think people are doing it to tell other Redditors so much as getting their feelings out there. We all just love Fallout games and don't want to see them head down this very slippery slope. It's purely love for the franchise rather than an attempt to wind other players up.
---
Seriously man you have problems. I won't judge you for payin 12$ a month for it, i'm just judging you that you can't acknowledge that the ScrapBox could have been in the game from Day 1 with zero impact on server performance issues. And admit that Bethesda lied. And that fans have the right to point it out. The quit and move on philosophy you are enforcing will only hurt the gaming industry if people are not even allowed to debate a game developer's tactics.
---
So? If its as random as normal id rather see the money in their hands, than some random person trying to profit from the game and selling items for $$
---
Theyve responded by hiring bots to downvote every negative message and write propoganda messages
---
And its still easy to farm legendarys
---
It's like laughing at people getting stabbed and then being angry at whoever stabbed them.
---
The thing is they probably anticipating that not even 10% of the playerbase will get a scrapbox which is why it's fine and won't affect server stability.
---
Now imagine that number of people being 1000% higher, and seeing 1000% more random scrap dropped around, sold to vendors, the game would have to keep track of 10 times the resources, at which point it stops being just one integer in the database.
---
Lol you first pull my age out and claim to worry about the people around me then whine I am belittling you? Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it you big baby.
---
Can’t take the heat? Get out of the kitchen. I am amazed people like you some how make it day to day in society 
---
Grow up.
---
Isn’t that essentially gambling? It’s like the loot boxes that were made illegal in some countries.
---
It shouldnt have to be that way to begin with.
---
It’s like everyone forgets they are basically coming out more then what you would get if you just bought atoms
---
summary: fo76 was a bad experiment by a dying software development company who thought they knew a thing about games, but couldn't translate it to anything beyond single-player.
---
They tied to a do fallout 4.5 while their real devs went off a Matt McMusceles-esque multi-year gig for bethesda. We'll find out what those devs have been doing in a a few years after a mass effect andromeda-esque wait.
---
The intern-esque devs who are still working on fo76 are coupled with a product management group who have no idea how to make money on fallout, They had no plan before, they no plan now. They are living off the existence of whales (level 300+ who spend $30/mo or more in atoms) in fo76, and yet who are all kind of getting bored and never asked for what bethesda provided.
---
Do the mods even see these posts.
---
i definitely agree with you on one thing, what's definitely going to happen is that this will all blow over, nothing will be done about it, and bethesda will get away with this shit again
---
As someone who plays minecraft extensively, fallouts building system is absolutely infuriating and so restrictive.
---
Oh no, it will be after launch of wastelanders. When everyone see that it will be broken with full of overpriced micro transactions to please Providence assholes. For now, meh it's OK, everything is fine
---
Ahahah 16 dollares of atoms is a great offer indeed. The private servers are not private servers, people are reporting finding dead npcs and looted areas, you're buying a leftovers server. Infinite junk storage? The box is literally making everything disappear. Cool emotes? You serious? Are you a Bethesda employee? Lemme check..... yep all your comments are in the f76 sub reddit and all pro Bethesda. Same as the the first dude who commented that "soloing the queen makes me want to buy a membership".
---
They just nerfed collectrons actually
---
Don't know about that, never really played swbf2, but I dont think it would be, you buy the scripcs, not the items
---
Having a contrary opinion is hate? 13 bucks for a broken product is fun? Right.
---
shamelessly replying to my own post: i am one of those 300+ whales, except I refuse to pay anything for atoms. Fuck bethesda.
---
I can’t state it could of been day one- I am not a software programmer or any of the sort I don’t even have the background to make a statement like that- I work in the medical field. Maybe it did cause server problems and they fixed it and now want to make money on it. Either way it’s been pointed out like 30 times a day. It’s the same posts over and over.  It’s getting pretty old.
---
Don't waste you time bud. Everyone tried to warn this game's community about what this game really was.
---
I mean who has such low standards for a game, it boggles my mind, and i see even now some are defending this game.
---
Even now some people who have been spat on, chewed up and price gouged by bethesda still vehemetly defend it.
---
It like watching a real live case of battered wife syndrome. Anyways I'm real happy with bethesda for this new "update", i love watching this dumpster fire keep getting bigger and bigger and many thanks to the guys forh supporting this game as this woukd not have happened without your support and much sought after feedback. Cheers
---
Do you even care about having a good and genuine game company?
---
See you’ve got nothing, you know it’s the truth. Tell me what sane person pays $100 for an actual scam like this especially after buying the abomination that is the base game for $60? At what point does a person like you start using his common sense, if you even have any, and say: "ok, maybe something fishy is going on here and i should think twice before once again supporting a company who for a long time has been employing dishonest perhaps even fraudelent practices that harm the entire gaming community”? You are simply an addict.
---
The only things I know of that you might and will half to pay for is if you want more Atoms and the new servers. But if you pay for the "not private" servers you can get like 1600 atoms a month with the service fee
---
How so?
---
Your own personal mr farmhand! Only 760 atoms!
---
He's implying that a selling point for a private server is that it doesn't crashes. So he's ok with public servers crashing because there's an alternative. It's darn obvious.
---
Lmao. 1st. The 16 bucks value for 13 bucks is a good deal. 2nd. It's a private world but obviously they dont have infinite servers so it makes since to get a used world every once in a while and I haven't experienced it myself. 3rd. Someone liking the game doesnt make them a Bethesda employee, it makes them a fan. I delete my negative posts because they just get filled up with salty people like you who would rather be irrational and hostile than have a real discussion about the issues with the game.
---
Neither did I but I heard all about it. It’s pretty much the same principle. It’s worse if it isn’t the item (although it’s bad all together) because it’s then gambling, you aren’t guaranteed your role you’d like. It’s just like the loot box system in previous COD games and SWBF2. 
---
You’re paying money for atomic points, you redeem them for scrip points, go to purveyor, redeem them, don’t get the wep you’d like. Same system as the loot boxes essentially.
---
At least 1000- you know we would pay for it haha.
---
Bioware IS the perpetrator. They wasted 6 years of development time all on their own with EA giving them all the money and not standing behind their collective shoulder. 
---
They chose Frostbyte on their own (previous Kotaku interview), they started to develop new tools for it despite having 2 games on this engine, they refused to look into other games of the looter shooter genre, they didn't have a clue on what their game was even supposed to be. They needed an EA executive to tell them that flying is cool and must be in the game.
---
The actual development began 18 months before the launch because of the studio own failures. So Bioware is the perpetrator who failed to deliver a good game to customers, not EA or anyone else.
---
That's not even close to what was said. You're obviously just angry and taking out in everyone and putting words in people's mouths because you have no real argument.
---
Some people don't want to hear it, but it's almost pure entitlement.  
---
There's something new and people absolutely need to have it but they also deserve to have it for free BECAUSE PETE PROMISED.  Bethesda could cut all the pretense and positive PR statements and flat out tell the community that the game isn't making enough money and they needed to find new ways to monetize to keep things going... and a certain extremely angry and extremely vocal subset of the community would go red in the face screaming about promises and how they'd rather watch the game die than let other people pay for novelties and conveniences.
---
Damn. I been emptying them out so much at peoples camps haha
---
The $60 was the fee you paid to be advertised to.
---
Everything about FO76 was designed to get you to keep spending. Promise after promise was made to keep you spending. 
---
"Don't worry about the lack of content, it's coming! We have a roadmap! Just keep buying Atoms!"
---
The sad thing is people were having fun with FO76 *despite* the game, not because of it.
---
It's like going to Disney World expecting a great experience, only to find that literally everything interesting costs even more money to do.
---
Lmao
---
How’s Bethesda gonana make money off it then?
---
"Stop blaming consumers for global warming, blame the companies for making their products that pollute the environment because I keep paying them to do it!"
---
They're bitter having put so much money into this game and receiving the equivalent of a spit in the face. Can't say I blame them.
---
You are completely blind to the fact that Bethesda have purposefully destroyed this game in order to make Atoms more appealing so, (and pardon my offensive language) "fools" like you buy them and defend it as a way to "make the game more fun" I paid 80 bloody dollars for this game it SHOULD BE FUN! There is no excuse in the world to defend this decision and especially not by saying "You can get atoms for cheaper Uhh Duhhhh"
---
Nope. Stating a that it's a fact that private servers run better isnt the same as supporting the low quality of public servers. Are you a youtuber? Or maybe a youtuber fanboy? Seems that way.
---
This is a fantastic idea. It may compromise the value of the scrap box itself, but they could leave the weight on intact junk items as it is and make the box hold infinite amounts of *intact* junk, which has resale value and other uses.
---
Seriously BGS, implement this ASAP.
---
outerworlds. amazing that fallout 76 only came out a year ago. 5 minutes in outerworlds...and just made me realize how old clunky and general shit 76 is. reused 10 year old assets. antiquated game engine. fallout is dead man. i can't believe i even bought that game. uninstalled it today. and leaving this sub.
---
Yea, you're several hours late from the first guy that asked if I was Todd using a sock account.  At least come up with something that original.
---
Haha , yeah but really they need those bots to counteract the "trolls" and "people who don't play the game". No one is really mad about anything they have done with their superb product that has no flaws.
---
It already has private sessions.
---
Yes that was my point. I don't agree with name calling though
---
\#Bethesdawillneverbegoodagain!
---
It's really just for those if us who play it pretty die hard. Nobody should be looking to get it u till they are at end game and determine if they want to continue playing past the questline.
---
I mean lets be real here most just have it for the fact of having a friend at camp
---
I love the three modern entries, they all give me something different. 3 has a fucking great wasteland to traverse, New Vegas just has the best writing and roleplaying in any game I've played, and 4 is fast and fun with settlement building and an active modding scene constantly improving the game.
---
So you spend money on a subscription to buy stuff on their online shop? ahahah awesome. Private worlds was advertised as private servers, there's not second interpretation for it. You should have a fresh server for yourself and not one already looted by other players. So anyone who disagrees with being faithful and loyal to wtv Bethesda pulls up is salty, irrational and hostile? Congratulation on that perspective. Fortunately you're a tremendous minority in the game industry.
---
Cant be every challenge . Just logged on my lower lvl and have alot that reward atoms that I know are completed on my main . Nuked flora for example . Theres no way I dont have a single one on my main who runs nuke zones while my lvl 20 shows 0/76  80 atoms to reward tho
---
Whoa, I didn’t expect to be personally attacked today..lol jk.
---
Very true- I hope they add more comments he makes in the future
---
Ever heard of gameflip? It wouldn't even make a difference at this point. Not that I support that idea.
---
Haha point taken!
---
“It’s not how it launchers, it’s what it becomes.” Look back over the past year and let that sink in.
---
The biggest kick in the gonads with Fallout First is how they think they're being smart dangling that Ranger Armour in front of everyone when it looks laughably shit.
---
That was a pretty childish argument.
---
This could be fixed by automatically removing the tent whenever a real camp needs the spot. I also think they shouldn't exist, but they're here to stay.
---
which isn't even private apparently -- dead bodies laying on the ground and boxes already looted.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't give Bethesda that much credit.
---
You should pick up another hobby.
---
You do know they stealth nerfed the collectrons with this weeks update right? Anything we suggest, including reversing those nerfs to collection rates/chances, will probably be monetised. Stop feeding the dog that bites.
---
What they should be scared of is people like me that bought and preordered ever game before and now wouldn’t dare do that, but treat them like EA. 
---
They saw an online premise, and dollars like with ESO, and went for it.  Totally get it. Market changed and you need to charge with it. 
---
However, that isn’t your niche.  It’s proven now by numbers. 
---
As much as I love elder scrolls, I will not pre-order  anything again. 
---
Only people that know me personally will understand the gravity of what I am saying by saying that, but the reality is that there are lots like me.
---
The fact of the matter is is that until Bethesda comes to terms with the fact that they fucked up, and admit it, and move forward to realizing the magic they made previously, they are going to be blacklisted as another company that can’t deliver a good game.
---
My favorite game to this day is still elder scrolls oblivion, and it pains me to say it, but I simply will not continue to buy at their games when there are a lot of other options.
---
They were lucky that people like me still bought the game day one because they figured that great Bethesda could not fuck up anything. But that goodwill has been destroyed over the course of the last two years.
---
Long story short, do some actual reflection, and realize that even though this game may have been a financial success to a certain extent, it could’ve been so much more and you left ton of money on the table. Because that’s at the end of the day all they care about.
---
What it essentially proves is they have servers that aren't being filled because of the mass exodus. Their response is to let you rent an empty server if you pay 100 bucks. But don't worry, you get 16 bucks back that you can only spend on 'cosmetics'
---
It's a joke! And I Can't believe people are defending this.
---
Haha yes they're extremely anti-consumer.
---
Thats like having an ex-girlfriends name tattooed on yeah. What are you going to have cover it up?😂
---
Yea I’ve heard of that. I think I’d make a difference if they implement a system like this. I’d be worse because you’re never guaranteed the right role with purveyor. But I think it make a lot of difference but not in terms of acquiring weapons if you understand what I’m saying?
---
So you're admitting that they run better. And the fact that they run better it's worth paying the membership. Instead of demanding public servers to be stable, you're giving more money to Bethesda for a private server, because, again, it's more stable than the public ones. ahahaha
---
That was mentioned in the update notes.
---
Scrap you can implement as simple set of counters, same for everyone, while other items can have modifications and legendary effects meaning you can't easily index them.
---
So it makes sense they made a separate container for scrap and why you even can't put bulk into it.
---
Time to dump Bethesda. They've been on a steady decline since the lackluster Fallout4. Fallout76 and Rage2 should by themselves be enough reason to walk away. In my eyes they aren't much different than EA or Activision at this point.
---
You say I'm a minority. I dont think so. I think I'm in the silent majority and you're in the vocal minority. Looking at the servers I see more than half of the players I encounter using the ranger duster outfit or icon. Most of the camps I have visited have had a scrap box. Lastly, looking through my friends list the vast majority say private every once in a while. What makes you salty and irrational is taking a statement about someone's experience and turning into something they never said or implied at all. You are twisting words to fit your agenda.
---
lol found the bugthesda emoloyee!
---
I prefer 76 but I wouldn't want to skip on 4. 76 just has more replayability for me being online is all.
---
I'm still enjoying the game. Repair kits, scrap kits, etc. They have made my purchase worth while. Whatever they do after isn't an issue for me. I got what I paid for
---
Nope. I'm stating that they run better. Never once have I stated we shouldn't expect the public servers to be better, nor have I said that a private world alone is worth the money. The reason you keep building this straw man to attack is  because you know you're wrong. I'm gonna stop feeding the troll if you have nothing of value to add.
---
I went from 800 to 500
---
Nothing.
---
On your part yes.
---
Fireman uniform, eh? Guess they *finally* decided to add that after showing it off in the trailers before launch.
---
NO NO NO, You have to see they intentionally MAKE the game grindy in order to make you (and I hate to say) fools! Think you are getting your “moneys worth” it’s a $80 game it should not have ANY REASON to MAKE you purchase these kits, open your eyes you are being manipulated, so sad
---
Can you check the game files for Purveyor? Looking for information if she can give out HEAVY metal Left legs, specifically the left leg. I've tried countless of times and haven't got a single one. I use 3 characters daily for scrip and also buy a ton of scrip. Not a single heavy metal left leg, I've tried months.
---
I've been offering ~120k caps/5.56 for Vanguard or Autostim with FDC for months and months and nobody has came forward with one. If it dropped from purveyor surely someone would have one by now. (PS4).
---
I've gotten heavy metal chests and other parts, just left leg that seems to avoid me.
---
Absolutely. If you enjoy fallout gameplay you will enjoy 76.
---
Do you think Bethesda is masochistic?  That they just LOVE getting all of this negative attention every time they try to find a new way to make money off of this game?  
---
That promise of providing all new content for free was based on an assumption... that the people playing this game would buy enough atoms to buy cosmetics to keep money coming in to keep developing this game.  Ever notice that the majority of conversations around here about the atom shop are about how atoms are too expensive, or atom shop items are too expensive, or how people refuse to buy bundles, or there's nothing worth even spending their free atoms on?  Bethesda can't come right out and say it but the atom shop has likely been a complete and utter flop... even when they do try and add stuff like the collectron and fridge that push at the boundary of that sacred promise people can still just buy them with their free atoms and not spend a dime.
---
Live service games require a stream of income in order to continually develop... if they can't properly monetize this game it isn't the playerbase you need to be worried about getting bled dry, it's the game... because when a live service game isn't making enough money that's when they start cutting the budget and then patches start to get cut and features start to get cut and eventually entire services get cut.
---
If common sense is an agenda, then yes i have one. Silent majority? You're delusional. Well, good luck to you and you tiny little cult of yours.
---
It’s a good deal on an atom bundle that you can only do once per month.
---
Haha yes, let's all have a good laugh about how fucking busted this game is!
---
Can’t blame the mods- these posts are annoying to us- they must be very annoying to them. Only so much shit you can shovel until you say fuck it.
---
I'm on PS4, and i have a mic. I just leave it on mute until i need it because the default setting when not on a team is area chat. And nobody wants to hear me coming along the road singing with the radio, slurping a hot drink or eating a biscuit.
---
Oh we got a wise guy here eh?
---
You will 100% post here again before next Saturday.
---
Are you really visualizing just how small an amount of data that really is for even your PC to track, never mind their servers?  Even if it was tracking that small data set for every single player of the game?  I'm not sure you appreciate just how small and simple that is for a computer to keep track of even in real time.
---
Define what a "Fallout game" means to you. Because for most, it is The Outer Worlds.
---
X
---
Op ignore this troll. Cant you see bethesda dick so far up his ass that it literally ticking his tonsils?
---
I mean he has to vent out his frustration somewhere. Anyways thanks for the info
---
Got a man telling people his opinion as he sees fit, eh
---
But I haven't spent any money in an entire year playing the game. Don't plan to spend any now. The game is still the same for me. Not sure why everyone cares. If they wanna spend money on something then I'm not gonna tell them not to
---
I have nothing to be frustrated about- I love the game and I enjoy the private server with my friends haha.
---
Opinions? Not allowed here sorry.
---
If you're still playing this game after the year of shit they've been shoveling you, then you clearly enjoy eating it. Why even bother bitching about it, this is what you signed up for
---
Wait the downsize the shit to 8 players in total ofc you then can store more then.....
---
We'll see. the drama is fun. I'm gonna block you tho just so you don't get the satisfaction. Cheers!
---
Played on public tonight just fine. Disconnected 1 time in a 3 hr session. But I also disconnected on a private world.
---
You already gave in haha
---
Thats probably the furthest from the truth of what will actually happen, but it seems to make you happy, so continue believing it.
---
It is good to hear all opposing views tho
---
I haven't got the sub server but I did jump through the camps. You should check it out, he's not lying. I seen a lot of them with the scrap box.
---
BOX
---
You seem to be confused about the discussion here, so I'll reiterate. I couldn't care less about your taste, if you're having fun that's fine. However in your previous comments you have said:
---
&gt; it's the latest installment in a popular franchise that i know and like, and want to see more of. and i got to do that for a 20 
---
and that "people" would like:
---
&gt; new (ish) franchise games made by AAA devs
---
So these were responses on someone pointing out you could have more fun with $20:
---
&gt;  There’s hundreds of games at $20 worth playing over this. 
---
I'm saying that this person is right, there ARE many games as $20 worth playing over this. If they are ALL not to your liking, FO76 is a choice for you worth considering.
---
gentlemen don't ignore replies. blocking now tho. bye.
---
there are two links with donations and support money already
---
World premiere.
---
Not all day everyday and every post.  it’s the same thirty posts over and over again. We get it- can we just get back go back to talking about the content in the game

You have fun bud
---
He's part of the Bethesda hate bandwagon. He wont listen to reason.
---
Here's the thing. The subscription would not exist without the people willing to buy it.
---
Bethesda are shitlords but they're ultimately not the problem here. This isn't just bad news bears for Fallout 76. This extends to all future Bethesda products, and other games if companies look to what is happening here.
---
Anyone who buys the subscription is a fool, plain and simple, and ruining it for everyone.
---
Not played the game in months, come to whine about subscription services, thinks the devs are making him pay money to come back to the game... This guy makes clowns look normal by comparison.
---
I think it went down a hair. I used to be able to wire up the trap when needed (4 wires), but since the update, have to remove some magazines now.
---
Plus I don't mind being labled a fool. I bought a game and I played it without even thinking about updates and new content. I just liked fallout 4. So I did what was intended. I played it... And alot lol. If I quit, I will be satisfied with my investment. Bottom line.
---
If you deleted it and don't plan on downloading again why are you here? Lol. I swear 95% of the angry Reddit karma farmers who say they did this didn't.  If your done then leave. Truly be done with it haha
---
I get where you are coming from and i am happy you can enjoy this game without kneeling to Bethesdas egregious practices, the issue is not that "you" personally are having no issues enjoying the game without spending any money, it is the fact that bethesda continues to SPIJT in our faces by,
---
1. Making the game harder to play "scrap farming etc.."
---
2. Releasing a broken FUCKING MESS
---
3. Not Fixing the broken FUCKING MESS
---
4. Charging customers for GAME-CHANGING items (although you dont personally partake, the fact that this is an option should make you squirm as a consumer of any AAA title which you have paid for)
---
It is not the issue that you havn't spent money on the game, tis the fact that when will these greedy capitalist practices end?! We can't stand back and wait for Bethsdsa to start charging consumers for BASIC GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS IN A GAME WE PAID FOR!
---
Yeah in Hindsight I do legitimately think the Devs cared about the game and pushed for free dlc to unite the player base, and the micro transaction system was the only way corporate would go for it.
---
But what content in game do you wanna talk about
---
Yep. It's pure pay to win. You're going to see people with ultimate loadouts, fully stocked gear and health items come into private servers where the plebs don't stand a chance. It's going to break the game.
---
YOU ARE DAMN RIGHT FRIEND. From what I can tell, most people who actively play the game have normal criticisms of bugs and certain glitches but are otherwise happy with the game, while EVERY SINGLE PERSON who has complained abiut p2w and Fallout 1st haven't played the game in months.
---
Read above reply to see why that is a terrible thing to think, it can and WILL eventually affect you
---
Anything but complaining all day haha. 
---
I really love the new legendary scorch beasts- and super excited about wastelanders coming out! 
---
But really- anything but 30 complaint posts and people in then saying anyone who plays the game ruins the game industry
---
Yeah just got myself a game pass, it's crazy to think I can play outer world's for a month for £1 when it would cost me £12 for a month of fallout 1st 
---
Whoever missed that in advertising fucked up bad, and outer world's has an unbelievable fallout new Vegas feel to it
---
On the contrary, i know i'm right. The sole purpose of your post was to validate buying the membership through 1. soloing the queen 2. server stability. Like they're exclusive to private servers, which is wrong.
---
Value to add = complimenting Bethesda? No, thank you
---
Yeah i'm done also. Bye and have fun collecting cool emotes.
---
Alexa, how can I give someone more than just one upvote?
---
Who the hell downvoted this
---
Uranium Fever is on a timer, there’s no way you can “rush thru it” by one shotting everything. It ends when it ends regardless of how quickly you kill the legendary mole miners. Don’t be a dick just pepper it with a weak gun and let everyone have a shot on it. Don’t let the extractors ever get destroyed that’s what hurts the meter and the rewards at the end, not how quickly you can sneak attack a lvl 40 mole miner with a bloody deathclaw gauntlet 🙄
---
Not every subscription has autorenew
---
"the action of making or agreeing to make an advance payment in order to receive or participate in something."
---
Thanks I found him here  [https://imgur.com/qtdkcmz](https://imgur.com/qtdkcmz)
---
Did a run for the few spawns there, 3 hops. Ran into a legend sheepsquatch and grahm popped up too. I usually hop cravasse dam.
---
I don't think you understand completely. I've played this game since release and never spent any atoms. Never spent a single dime playing this game and today I still enjoy it. People can really enjoy the game despite all the issues. Was it frustrating a year ago, yes. But we all still played it. it's definitely a mega ton better than it used to be. It's an awesome game. Unfortunately all good games come to an end. New games replace and the cylce goes on.
---
This ^
---
Almost everyone complaining about FO 1st is living some crack fueled pipe dream that things are free and no one ever needs to pay for any services. Bethesda is a fucking business. In a business, if you're not making profit, you're losing it.
---
There's some convoluted way to decrypt them into a keyword you can use to translate them into a launch code for the silos, but most people just collect the pieces to shut them up and let Nukacrypt find the numbers for us.
---
I agree with every word you said, and what grinds my gears is that bgs said it took years to make fo76 instead of making what they knew we as hard core fans wanted. Wasting time making fo76 delayed any game we would want as well, and now that bgs reputation is trash i hold out no hope for es6 or starfield.  Just started the outer worlds last night very good so far, it’s probably everything we hoped starfield could be anyways.
---
Ever played wow?
---
76 is not a broken as it was, and what game changes? Unlimitied scrap? So what if i can store a million cork, i usually just drop it anyway, same with many of the other junk items.
---
They are putting in private servers, as a service for People who would like to Pay for that, there was No promise of free private servers or Even private servers when the game launched, its not game changing in Any way other than you get to play All by yourself or with friends only, but hey you can do that without paying for it, just find a world thats close to empty
---
Yes, but how will you know which effect you have if both are named the same?
---
Dude, you're salty as fuck, if you don't want to complain to others about it. Don't even comment. Pointless.
---
Jeezus that's careless.
---
Honestly, I like the game engine, yes it is a bit dated but it helps give newer games the same feel that Skyrim and Fallout 3 had, while still being able to incorporate newer concepts
---
And yet the burger was still eaten.
---
Do you expect Them to keep the game online and updated forever without earing more money than what they made from sales? Games die out if we dont Pay, thats just how it is
---
IT SHOULD BE OUR FUCKING RIGHT!
---
Haha
---
Defenders of fo76 are at the fifth stage of grief, acceptance.
---
 BBC are trash tho.
---
Damn, you no lifed it. Crazy.
---
THEY LIED TO US!
---
I know when it first came out people rushed to buy it and most likely crashed it
---
Are you on crack?
---
I would pay to not have a daily script limit. I am still unloading from the 50% sale
---
Ew, you're still on this sub thats about the game. Leave already. Its just a game, and a sub. HaHa.
---
He's a bigger member than your member downstairs thats for sure.
---
Addendum: Crazies who don't even play the game.
---
What out OP here came the paid fanboys telling you how good is Fallout 1
---
I unistalled it yesterday
---
It’ll get better :)
---
Yikes
---
Yeah I just wish I can script all the stuff at once instead of holding it forever
---
I meant yikes as in that would be a feature you’d be happy with
---
Private servers as a right? You gotta be kidding its a online multiplayergame with hosted servers.. Private servers is a Nice addition for People who want it, but its not in Any way what you paid for when you bought the game
---
Yeah the same way no one remember fallout new vegas and it's loved to death to the point huge teams of unpaid modders are trying to port it to a more updated version. 
---
What a clueless fool lmao
---
Oh for sure- it’s just taking up precious stash space holding onto my guns
---
I honestly believe genuine game company's don't exist anymore
---
It's not about the interface; it's the backend that's a disaster. The physics engine is nonsense, it's beyond buggy as all hell and seems to just drop quest variables, it's brutally unoptimized... it just wasn't made for games at the scope current games are made at.
---
If they rebuilt it from the ground up but had it look largely the same, it might even be okay (despite the fact that it's *also* hitting some graphical limitations). But the huge amount of glitches and poor performance issues means it should have been retired by this point.
---
They're not lowering themselves to the collective stupidity of this sub.
---
Yeah because every single person who plays the game or is a fan of the fallout games or Bethesda is irrational and angry and sends death threats and its not at all a very very small minority. 
---
TOTALLY /s 🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
I came to the conclusion they are being paid
---
THEY PROMISED THEM TO US, IT IS OUR RIGHT, it doesn’t take some fucking quantum computer genius to make the game have an offline mode, you are an exceptional fool since you didn’t mind me just calling you a fool
---
Yeah more lies
---
I unistalled the game yesterday
---
I suppose if you use the current $ to atom rate, then no, you're getting ~$16.50 worth of atoms plus the other stuff for $12. But atoms themselves are severely overpriced, or at least the things you can spend them on are. Adding an atom subscription to it just helps them justify to themselves continuing to overcharge for cosmetic items.
---
I don't want to seem rude at all, but maybe the problem isn't the game making you spend money, its your inclusiveness and addiction to spending. I see something from the atomic shop I like and do go immediately buy it. I save up and carefully choose what I'd like to purchase. Maybe you should go get some professional help.
---
Grow up and get out of your dream world, things die, its not always fair but Even kittens and puppies get old and die..
---
Yes, but I think wow shouldn't be a paid game anymore, just slap a subscription on it that is a bit higher maybe, or make the base game cheaper, I moved to PC to not pay for online gaming
---
not to forget - if i am correct (ps4 player here) you also need to pay for online gaming to begin with on both consoles. so people paid **80(?) dollars** for a game, **100 dollars** for subscription and **60 dollars** per year (that's how it is on ps4 / ps plus) to play online. So, playing online itself in all imaginable online games is cheaper than bethesda's sub for a singular game.
---
Yeah, but I tried as recently as 5 minutes ago and getting same behavior.
---
They've been bashing China since FO3, they're safe.
---
When did they promise us that?
---
I've stopped playing the game totally now, down from 5 to 6 hours a day for the last 6 months. The only reason I'm visiting this subreddit now is to check when we'll hear from them and if so, what they'll say. I need an apology.
---
Oh, sorry to hear that. Hope it gets fixed for you quick
---
Lol, this has to be satire, nobody could be this butthurt about a product no one is forcing them to buy
---
%100......TOW is great the only thing it needed is a bigger budget..
---
But I love the Bioshock/Fallout feel a solid RPG...
---
I am happy for Obsidian..
---
Hahhaha, you’re arguments are so weak you attack me and tell me to grow up and bring up something that has nothing to do with the issue at hand, you know what they are doing is wrong but you’re too far gone to say otherwise, I clearly cannot change your mind, you are naive
---
Yeah but there are different types of making money. Like Witcher 3, it was released playable and good, and later they made very good dlc and sold it.
---
I’m not angry at the fact that I’m “not being forced to buy it” I’m just fundamentally upset that Bethesda is making it and option when they PROMISED us these private servers and cosmetic only micro transactions, why can people not see these disgusting and disgraceful decisions
---
On a game we already paid for smh
---
fo76 is quite bad, and the recent development is very funny.
---
My arguments? You are behaving like a Child, your not in a debate, you dont anwser question, just yell out stuff..
---
Sounds wonderful to me! I’ll lube up and enjoy using the minuscule amount of money it costs to participate in my private server; all are welcome to join in cleaning up my mess which constitutes my enjoyment and your bitter utterances
---
You have touched a nerve yeh. I’m fed up of people like you who talk nonsense, and then make fun of the other person for defending themselves. But that’s my problem, not yours. I am satisfied in life and so don’t need to pick a fight with internet people. I am sorry for the emptiness you obviously feel, where you have to keep pushing like a child. Like I said earlier, you’re petulant but I hope knowing you’ve annoyed me brings you some satisfaction.
---
Then why are you still on this sub? Im just wondering if you hate the game so much.
---
It's one a time limit, you degenerate.  It always ends at the same time.
---
No worries, try a hard resetting from the console then ensure all the billing info is correct, I had the same issue and turns out after the crash the game registered it was still trying to purchase the next day but it never went through entirely. So in some weird error of connectivity or whatever wouldnt let the transaction go through. But afterwards it did and without error, hope this helped!
---
Bulk is no different than scrap is. They're not like combat gear or some consumables where you have to track different stats for what is essentially the same item.
---
There's no other reason other than it's fractionally simpler to manage just elemental junk vs bulk junk.
---
Lmao this is fucking ridiculous. ESO has the same premium service (minus solo sever play for obvious reasons) and they’ve smoothed it out and now it’s accepted. You do not NEED these premium services to play the game. Tons of people play ESO and have played ESO for several years without using/buying ESO plus. It’s doable, and it is still fun and enjoyable. If you want the premium service then pay for it. If you don’t want it, then don’t. It’s not pay to win. It’s pay for convenience. Pay to win would be if this premium service allowed you to make 4-7 star or higher items. It would be giving you an overall gameplay advantage that no one else could acquire without spending money (chewing thru mobs quicker because of the better quality). Chill your collective shit.
---
I'm currently listening country roads, waiting for my shift to end. Berlin, Germany ;p
---
Thanks for the insight. Assholes exist everywhere! And probably some WV folks talk better German than some Germans xD (Caused by accent or just laziness.)
---
Lol- what a goof you are. You first bring at my age and state you are worried about The people around me and then whine I am belittling you? If you can’t take it don’t dish it out you big baby. 
---
Grow up- it amazes me how people like you get by each day in society. 
---
Suck it up butter cup or don’t take shots.
---
Exactly, it works for so many other games, how come Bethesda can't make it work? Are they that money grubbing?
---
Mate, this is actually hilarious with all the caps lock words and all but you’re acting like you’ve never seen a company try and make money before. Get over it they never promised you free servers, and you have to realise when people ask for stuff to be added to the game it costs Bethesda real life money to implement it into the game, so don’t act so butthurt that people asked for private servers or utility items and Bethesda put them in game and asked for payment.
---
Well tbh if they sell something that's for Private Worlds only, it's really fine, as we can own the game easy enough in public servers, private server exclusive stuff can't actuaply harm the game while offering new game experience.
---
I mean they did say there will be mods in Private Worlds anyway, what would you expect mods do?
---
BUT, the bottomline is they cannot ignore and must do as much main game updates and fixes as possible.
---
Regarding Todd and Pete's credibility, I really don't see how it matters who is individually responsible for these decisions. If they don't like that the company made liars out of them (which is kind of ridiculous in the first place, Todd and Pete lying is hardly a new development) they need to find new jobs. 
---
Todd and Pete were representing Zenimax when they made their statements. There is no interpretation of the situation that supports the conclusion that these two dudes are not shameless liars who will say anything.
---
Ah yes, for pointing out “facts” I am the child and my use of caps lock is what makes  me “the idiot” read between the lines and find the emotion, I know this argument was in vein as your mind and chooses can’t and never will be altered, but I and everyone else shall know you are the real fool for supporting these egregious attempts of monetisation, reply with all the insults you want, it is you and only you who will seem the fool,
---
I bid you adieu
---
You are a bit of a cuck for buying it though, you understand that right? You’re literally paying a company to bend you over and do you dirty. We don’t always have a choice when faced with injustice, but you did and you chose to do the easy thing, and that’s usually the wrong side of history to be on. 
---
Regardless, I hope you feel your money is well spent, because I feel pretty cheated out of my $60 after countless lies and scummy behavior by this company. At least you can hide in your private world so people won’t harass you..
---
That's because it's fallout. Outerworlds ain't got no name power.
---
This should be stickied and rewarded.
---
Well maybe because Fallout 76 sucks in content and functionality while compared to GTA V?
---
Since when did. 50 do the best damage? Last I checked, .308 Hardened receiver was still better
---
I've read that Zenimax basically *is* Bethesda, set up by the Bethesda founders for legal reasons or something along those lines.
---
Of course you can't have anything for free, that's why you spend money buying the game, but they are implementing things that should be in there from day one and asking for money for doing what they are supposed to do.
---
Thanks, finally! I didn't know how to say it.
---
Or Borderlands 3.
---
You better take the word of other people not the press 'cause normally... Well, they gave fifa 8,5 and the outer worlds a 8.
---
Buying script is meaningless unless you can offload all the junk legendaries.
---
And I am quite sure no one would care if some fool pay crazy money for scrips while they are so easy to come by.
---
Don't worry, that'll come with the next subscription package, Fallout 2nd.  You can get it then.
---
Just remember that it's a wave.  It'll recede once these they get tired of bandwagoning about how much they hate the game and realize the base game is still there and start playing it again and whining about scrip limits.
---
I'm afraid this is on desktop in a web browser.
---
It’s gambling at the end of the day, I reckon people would care in some way or another
---
shut up todd
---
If they want to gamble I am fine because shit is easy to farm, they'd just be wasting stupid money.
---
Yeah I am not against the feature, but I think it's a bad move on their side to release it when the game is in the bad state it's in. Also the subscription pricing is silly, ~$15 a month, that's higher than most subscriptions around.
---
I mean why blame stupid people that makes the company money and let you ride on free updates?
---
Is the right answer.
---
I don't recall China being bashed in any fallout game. But America was bashed right from the opening cinematic of the first game.
---
I gotta admit I'm a little salty myself about the Wastelanders bait-and-switch.  I'm going to put that one up there with the pre-order bag in terms of questionable Bethesda practices, but I'm not going to act like I don't love the games anyway.  If a Ranger outfit being dangled over them is all it takes for a player to completely forsake the entire rest of the game, then good riddance.
---
It seemed to me that Bethesda missed a lot of opportunities to add good items to the atomic shop. I knew a lot of people that were sitting on atoms b cause there was nothing to buy and these same people would have purchased atoms to get legitimately cool content. 
---
Basically IMO it’s because Bethesda didn’t listen to what the community wanted and then atomic shop sales likely suffered as a result. Purely speculation on my part since I don’t have the data but some anecdotal evidence.
---
Link?
---
“Subscription revenue from one month of F1st will probably out earn Outerworlds in it's entire "lifetime". "
---
Even if that was true, which I doubt, so what?
---
Are you a gamer looking for a high quality game or a shareholder looking for the maximum RoI?
---
I imagine all those thousands of shitty mobile games make a huge profit.
---
You basically need to build your whole character and playstyle around VATS to utilize it properly in FO76.  You need to invest heavily in criticals, probably semi-auto or high-firerate semi-auto weapons, Concentrated Fire, etc.  But once you make the build and get a good weapon, you can just fire a ton of accurate critical hits into somebody's head in a second or two.
---
&gt;making noise and hate for **no good reason**.
---
It's fine for you to like the game, but that's a fucking mouth breather take.
---
Next Gen will be always online games like now but just in vr. Sony is making a new version of their vr headset with the ps5 and Microsoft is also making a vr headset with their next Xbox.
---
?
---
I’m talking about the people complaining about OP’s post, they all posted the same thing and then deleted after downvotes
---
Being an enabler doesn't automatically insinuate ill intentions.
---
The players ARE partially to blame.
---
A company releases an overpriced, underperforming manipilative piece of shit and no-one buys it? The product dies and it sets a positive precedence for the future. People will not be abused. 
---
However, some people just cant help themselves and piss their money away?
---
Flood gates -&gt; Open.
---
Amen
---
Probalbly a mod that did that lol
---
How so? It seems like the people buying the game was their way of paying for their experience. Or was that just to have the opportunity to pay for the real experience, I’m confused by your reasoning or lack there of.
---
Worth the $59 USD or $87 AUD to get Outer World's.
---
Fallout 1st is more expensive than PS plus, netflix and spotify.
---
So go play and don't worry about it, while we make fun of it.
---
Can you link primary evidence, that would be great
---
He tells it how it is, telling us that the game was not worth buying as it's still a buggy mess, the delayed NPC and now have the cheek to ask for $100 for something that was promised to be free. I dont understand how people can defend this game in light of everything that's happened around it
---
I could not get it to work on chrome, switched to ie and worked first time. (note, mine failed at a different point of the process)
---
lol that the bbc can say cunt but not shit. we need to deregulate freedom of speech. its funny that freedom has a price anymore, its time to do something about it. 100 years from now they are going to laugh at what you gave your freedom away for ....  over and over  and over again.
---
"Afraid"... bethesda is laughing at all of you. You wil come begging at the first sight tes6. You got nothing on them.
---
What a big brave hero...
---
That’s a pretty ridiculous statement but not too surprising. People can have legitimate criticisms and still play the game they paid $60 for, understanding that all MTX’s would be “purely cosmetic” and “all DLC free”. While an outright boycott would be grand it won’t do much when people are paying for these things. Censoring people is never the right thing and you should be ashamed of yourself for suggesting it.
---
Noone rushed it, except for Obsidian management. They know the timeframe in advance. They can't blame anyone else but themselves...
---
Define unique items?
---
Probably yes... And so is Fo76. A game can be good and have terrible developers / monetization...
---
Different items in aid section.
---
TOW sucks at exploration. It has no open world... Right of the bat two things that Fo76 does better...
---
You kinda forget about :
---
--the cryptid quest
---
--the borrows run
---
--the vault 94 raid
---
--the legendary merchant
---
But to be fair, since one is broken, the other so easy you can complete it before level 50, the third is just a two hours quest and the last is half-broken, half-used as a sink for your material, I understand.
---
It’s also filled with people who enjoy this game and don’t want to see blatant pay to win mechanics and more broken promises. I guess buying the game for $60 doesn’t entitle you to an opinion anymore, you have to fork over another $100/year or any opinion you might have is invalid. Your reasoning is flawless sir, glad we have stable geniuses like you walking around!
---
I am pretty sure there is chaos on management level in regards to this game. So many bad decisions, I am really wondering how many people have to sign off on these since nobody is speaking up on those internally. 
---
On the other hand....imagine that the management is actually functional and the decisions that they execute are the good ones of all those proposed during meetings...I am actually rooting for them being dysfunctional instead of THIS being their best
---
Well I won’t have too because I’ll have some left over. I do all the daily challenges and weekly so I get atoms regardless.   I  might have enough to get what I want next week.  Nbd
---
And they make 3 videos a day on the same subject.
---
Exactly why I wrote the post..
---
I feel sorry for you if you have spent 2700 hours in this pile of recycled garbage.
---
Are you entitled to like even love what you purchased absolutely, but that does not make the game any better is just your opinion. 
---
This is why Zenimax has a yearly subscription,because they know most people would not spend a dime on this,but there is always going to be that on a person (You) to keep them going.
---
2700 hours hit me up and I'll buy you a game,you really missing on some good games.
---
Yep. And people act like the game suddenly turned bad when the monetization turned bad. The game still plays good... Bad nowadays most gamers are unable to process anything more complex than simple black-or-white thoughts...
---
GTA disables a shit load of options in invite only. Sends you into special p2p connections for races and such.  And there is no real interacting with the game world nor any looting to be done. Theu spawn NPCs around you with very basic walk in a line or run if shot at.
---
$12.99 in the us if you buy monthly . $8.99 per month for a year.
---
I stopped buying after Skyrim. Only when they start investing the money we gave them into a proper engine that is not decades behind the competition and full of holes I won't even consider buying anything from them.
---
I know right? This guy hasn’t played the game in 8 months by his own admission but feels he has to make a stand and wants to be the moderator between Beth and the fo community lmao he’s just a try hard keyboard warrior jumping from controversy to controversy 😂😂
---
Shove it up your ass, along with your BS premium service that is immune to exchange rates $100 does not equal £100
---
No, people like you are the problem. People who think they know the universal truth and have to keep annoying other players with their allegedly "better" game. Get lost...
---
P.S BGS is in this predicament because smart people like you are enabling them.
---
Do you know why I wrote the post because I spent 60, that gives me the right to call them out.
---
But the sole reason Bethesda/Zenimax does this is because those player are buying.
---
If you sell something and nobody buys it, either you lower your price or you change your business. But an artist already proved you can literally sold canned shit, so don't expect companies to be ethical "just because".
---
thats not how political polls. jeez, talk about being misinformed.
---
Haha I saw you offering it in discord and thought wtf? Then I realized that I farmed so much steel, crafted ALOT of vault armor and realized that I never got a single Unyielding part and thought it was actually strange...
---
Either that or it will cripple public worlds intentionally as a driver for the subscription service - makes sense for them to let the public worlds rot.
---
This is a great idea. The people dumb enough to get Fallout 1st are surely dumb enough to fall for this. 10/10
---
It’s the BBC everything comes down to politics with them.
---
I know I can't right now, I was wondering if it's something that said they will change in the future
---
Helvetia? Seems like a bunch of swiss people are living there.
---
You complain it's a greedy system and yet you bought a month? lol
---
Sometimes I'll join the server anyway to see what they've done with the area and compare their CAMP to mine and most times I'm just like "THIS is why I cant join the server? For this crappy CAMP?"
---
Building a camp on a junk resource w/an extractor produces significantly more junk in less time than the junk bot. So it still feels more cosmetic to me vs a major advantage...
---
Troll detected.
---
Yeah. Here in Sweden we have high VAT :(
---
It does now. It's already a well known game.
---
Same as yours, with an extra mention of blocking the path from Vault 76.
---
Oh please.
---
ES6 will be rife with bugs, absolutely lousy with them. Itll look visually good when officially announced, look "bad" when it comes out.  It'll have even heavier armor restrictions that Skyrim did. And day one paid mods, too.
---
And people will gobble it up. People will just say "Oh, Bethsoft released another buggy, incomplete game. Those scamps!"
---
Dont even worry. FO76 wont even scratch TES6's profitability.
---
Dude, I think we got off on the wrong foot. You might want to reread my comment. More specifically how asking for a free trial period implies that there would be a period where it's not free.
---
Let me put this into context - I 100% agree with your final paragraph.
---
This is constructive.
---
They were bug riddled pieces of shit with terrible combat that had charm and style and still managed to be immense fun to play. 
---
When you are having fun you make allowances for the fact that there is a brahmin on the roof again or if another radscorpion is glitched through a rock with only its tail sticking out, or that Oblivion's levelling system was so horribly implemented that you had to specialise in all the skills that you WONT be using.
---
Outer Worlds is absolutely incredible, and I’ll play it all month. Then I’ll be done with it after 100+ hours of incredible play. 
---
Then in a few months Wastelanders will be out and I’ll be playing 76 again and hopefully everyone has calmed down a bit and Bethesda has figured out a way to make everyone moderately happy once more.
---
Ok, fair point, but Elite Dangerous is all cosmetic microtransactions with the occasional paid dlc (currently 3'ish years between paid dlc) but still, they are managing the period between paid dlc with  microtransactions  for ARX (for purely cosmetic items).
---
This is sarcasm.
---
They cant even get the game running stable while sticking to ONE console, imagine how bad it would run during crossplay.
---
This thread and OP is the reason this shitfest exist in the first place
---
You are even worse than Bethesda
---
They just want traffic.
---
I'm honestly curious as to what was the thought process behind sticking to this game.
---
Kept playing, eh, whatever.
---
Kept PAYing though...
---
&gt; What Someone Does With Their Money Isn’t Our Concern!
---
fucking bullshit.
---
Its the principle of things.
---
I know i sound like le whiny redditor gamer right now, but i just dont want to support such price gouging practices.
---
I wish to support live service games like ESO, with good amount of content and quality (bonus: it also has costumes and convenience items but its tolerable since it isnt blatantly bad.) Instead of Fo76 where its just fuckup after endless fuckup.
---
There's a 0,05% or so chance it drops from one of those ash heap events, i think it can also spawn in level 3 locked explosives crates, it's very valuable so if you want to trade for it be prepared to drop good stuff
---
So you laugh at them?
---
GTA V is one of the best selling games of all time, so that means way more people play that than they do Fallout 76. More people = more microtransactions.
---
I hate to say it, but the bugs have been worse since the update.  Blue screen crashes.  Freezing menu crashes.  Jetpack is borked.  Still playing and having fun, but it is frustrating to be this buggy a year later.
---
&gt;They disagree with me
---
&gt;Obviously they are smooth brained mutants hauhauhau. Only i have the presence of mind to understand that my opinion is right.
---
I think if you check with several other games (gta excluded but they are just as if not more grindy just to tempt you to buy the shark cards) will have you pay for a private server because servers are not made of magic and are made of real world electronics. You say make an offline mode but that would require them to recode the game from the ground up to make it work. Which would cost money. Which they could potentially make by having people pay for servers for a while. But they will not do that because they could instead use that money to make more free content for everyone and pay everyone's wages while they work on es6 or starcraft.
---
Are you me? Me and 3 other friends played at launch, quit 3 days in. Then a few weeks ago I figured I'd level a character just in time for Wastelanders. Boy, did that turn out to be a waste of time!
---
This is actually a good idea. Shame we can't mod our protest signs.
---
&gt;That is all beside the point.
---
How the fuck is them disabling the beat money making methods in the game beside the point? The entire reason they do that is because they want your cargo destroyed.  They need it to be destroyed.  Otherwise you don't get frustrated and buy a card shark. Why the fuck do you think even non super cars are costing 700k plus? 
---
&gt;The fact, is, many games offer Solo and Invite only modes for free and support the game with microtransactions. It's a proven business model that works, AS LONG as you have something solid to build off of, and we know what a shitshow Fallout 76 launch was.
---
And how do those games operate? Just because they are online doesn't mean they all operate the same. GTA for example has no inventory or loot system.  There are no mobs that have spawn points and loot to collect from them. They limit CEO work to 1 mission per session. And only spawn hostile npcs when you specially start a mission. As soon as you complete it they despawn as soon as they are not looked at.
---
Weird.  Mine worked first time, Chrome, a few days ago.  I navigated from the Bethesda Fallout76 main page, clicking on Fallout First.  not any direct links.   While already logged into the site with my account.
---
To be fair, ESO does the same and it isnt shat upon constantly. Its made by zenimax too.
---
Its because FO76 has a long string of fuckups punctuated by uproars like this. Lack of content worth $60 plus a bunch of price gouging stuff = unhappy consumers.
---
Please dont strawman everything into "entitled gamer bad, me good, me opinion smart."
---
You can't put bulk in Scrap Container? WTF?
---
I've been reading and watching a few streams on Fo76, whom were once very loyal and hopeful players of the game and they are becoming progressively more negative, and not entirely because they really wanted to be. It's a bit heartbreaking. I don't have the best ideas in the world, but like the streamers, the Fo76 faithfuls who have stuck with the game, we just want to see the game improve and thrive. 
---
That said, private servers should not be free. But rolling it out, with game-breaking bugs, and expecting players to pay full price for it is borderline unethical. I don't have a plan, and if I did I would have been a CEO and not a lowly web dev trying to get by.
---
If you want to read some more positive commentary &amp; gameplay content from people who haven't decided to ragequit the game over this, there are still plenty of us out there too.

I didnt put 2700 hours in, but if you're handing out free games, I'm so game for that! :D
---
I'll Photoshop them in the screenshots.
---
Why of all new posts THIS is getting upvoted? People clearly want to make the game even more pay-to-win. Pay-to-win sells. And those that have bought these pay-to-win things want to make them a bigger advantage.
---
&gt;In this case, I believe it is time to cut the loses and admit defeat.
---
Well it's a damn good thing your not in charge then. LMAO. Even if only 10K out down money for a year, and I'll the number is way low. The still pulled in 1000000 in a day. That's enough for 5 devs for a year and that doesn't even count those that bought monthly subs which is almost certainly many times the number of yearly.  Sadly, for you, it looks like FO76 will be around for quite some time!
---
Well i can farm ws endlessly idc about all the arguments you have but this subscription has a great price especially for the guys that where already purchasing atoms and this shit isnt pay to win its pay for convenience if you guys think this is a competitive game then i don't know any more
---
As the cheap fallout ripoff lol
---
Pc
---
Is anyone else getting sick of these fallout first shills making thread after thread after thread trying to justify their own buyer's remorse? If you love fallout first so much you wouldn't be here every single minute of every single day trying to defend it. You'd be playing it! But let's be honest, we both know you're not playing because the scrapbook ate your 300 ballistic and the tent made you crash. That's why you are here and not in game. You're angry at Bethesda and yourself, but in all you cognitive dissonance you come to take it out on the community that warned you not to get it!
---
But Elite Dangerous has had a ton of support pretty much since the beginning yes? Meanwhile day 1 of 76's announcement as an online game made a ton of people upset because it was not what they specifically wanted. Also would like to say that though I purchased a 1st membership I will not be using the scrap box because 1 it isn't something i need my big issue is extra armor taking up space not junk amd 2 for fear of some angry person on a public server with caps to spare repeatedly destroying my camp upon seeing my scrap box. Oh god I hope I did not give any trolls ideas.
---
This is the most dishonest act I've ever seen in all my days of gaming. Well, other than Star Citizen, but at least they're hard at work perfecting a game. This is a private company pissing on its consumers. 
---
Welcome to the R Kelly show everybody. This company is fucked.
---
Not giving Epic a goddamn cent.
---
I'll wait for Steam next year.
---
Guess what: If they had told the truth I wouldn't have bought the stinking pile of mobile game. Which is why they didn't tell the truth.
---
I enjoy the franchise idea since the first birdseye FO.  How can you test it if you don't try it? need first hand experience to see what the offer is right? Just like anything else... for me to have first hand experience I need to pay? lol won't be for another month though. ;) lol. 😁😂👍🏻
---
&gt;t. I spent most of my hours walking around in a dead world, while being overweight at 27 fps (144 in Overwatch on Ultra). The rest of my time I spent in my CAMP trying to find a way to make it less shitty 
---
Sounds like your just not very good at this game, perhaps you should try something different ? Find something you like and give that a go...or maybe go take a walk or something? The fresh air will do you good
---
"functioning adult" plays fallout 76 oh dear
---
Don't like the posts? Get off the sub. The majority rules - the sub is now a vessel of discontent aimed at Bethesda so that they're tone-deaf asses get the point. You're telling us to stay quiet because it's annoying? Have fun funneling your paychecks to Fallout 76,
---
Been in the same boat. I was there watching Cohhcarnage going from his usual optimistic self being a fanboy of Bethesda and Fallout to eventually despising Bethesda months later, all the while trying to be hopeful in the face of all the problems.
---
Yeah, no reasonable person would expect the private servers to be free. Most don't.
---
However, you know as a web dev how poor things are from top to bottom. It isn't solely a problem of upper management making terrible decisions, there's some degree of incompetence with the BGS Austin team that cannot be written off as upper management issues and is solely their issue. No such issue exists for Dallas (studio behind the NW battle royale). Nor Austin's Atom Store team who are killing it in terms of their work and consistency of quality.
---
Open world games of the style of elder scrolls and fallout. Outer worlds is the 1st one in ages to do so. But they are still rare.
---
I think some may be confusing “lies” with incompetence.   Someone can say something that is incorrect, with conviction.  Happens all the time on this sub too.  Does that may them a liar?  Or just a dumbass?
---
Dedicated server are rarelly free. Battlefield for example has paid server. Remember that it is not a local console acting as server but an actual server that bethesda has to rent from amazon.
---
Like I said the price is high, but if people thought that they were gonna be free lol
---
Im happy because i thought it might have had been a 5 dollars per day to have a private server so this is a better deal than expected.
---
EXACTLY!!! hahaha I do that!!
---
It's necessary. If one person showed up to a protest, would it have the same effect? 
---
That's a rhetorical question.
---
This is necessary, get used to it.
---
If that were to happen it would be Xbox and pc only
---
Love it totally agree
---
Nope. This is the place to do it. Because the sub reddit is literally called 76. 
---
I have an idea - make another reddit called "people who paid 160 for a year of the full game"
---
Problem solved.
---
Wait so you never bought the game and still conplain about something you havent played on a regular basis like those who would buy it. Smh.
---
If this was literally $5 or less a month, I actually would consider tbh
---
Everybody who disagrees with me is entitled.
---
What do you mean $13.80/month for P2W advantages in a $60 game is messed up?
---
That actually sounds like fun. PC?
---
Did anyone see one of Juiceheads latest vids? It is possible the bad timing is due to the hopeful release of Wastelanders but with its delay Zenimax (Bethesda's parent company) probably pushed the membership to be launched anyway.
---
Same as all those.
---
 Mine is that all camp must remain functional,if you use a great structure like the greenhouse for 2 plants and a mothman statue,that's just a waste of budget to me.
---
Oh no, the negative press! Dude, how you been living under a rock the past week? Every single major gaming news outlet is shitting on Bethesda right now, even the yes-men of gaming, IGN! He'll, I even saw the story on BBC!
---
At this point Bethesda is just crashing the game with no survivors. I'm convinced the low-level devs are making the game shit on purpose now to stick it to corporate and their horrible monetization decisions.
---
I found a good one, intelligent and well reasoned and sensible criticism.  12,000 views.  And I found a complete cockhead doing a screaming rant about the same topic, 514,000 views.
---
A giant platform over a cliff.  I know a trap when i see one.
---
Thats the spirit.
---
That is the difference that a lot of peoples dont understand.
---
feel better?  Lol
---
Honestly, it serves you right for giving in to Bethesda's greed. I do not feel sorry for you.
---
I'm going to cop it for this due to the popularity of the game but I had this issue with Zelda BOTW story wise. The world is very much alive sure, and the in world characters are great, but you're alive and you friends aren't so you're very much alone in the world and reliving your very long gone past over and over. It's effective storytelling but it did make it a very sad, bittersweet story for me and I had issues getting through it for that reason.
---
I'm sure they did a way better job than fallout 76, but the description reminded me so much of my unpopular feelings about Zelda. Not sure if it's comparable given I haven't played 76... I stopped at NV cause I felt like 4 was reskinned Skyrim with too much micromanagement.
---

My pet peeve is when I want to buy any kind of food and I see a camp with like 400+ food written in info and you fast travel there and all the food they have is Halloween candy.
---
I got it 3 days ago from battle bot. Took me a couple of months for no less than 5 events a day.   It could be 2 events,57,or 856   just do as many as you can.
---
Its because other games, especially other live service games, dont have a fuckton of bootlickers trying to be the unpaid pr team for a soulless billion dollar corporation.
---
You can have an upvote for your username

They do. They saw the feedback to make a working fridge that stops food spoilage and they immediately thought of a way to monetize it, so that's why it's in the Atom Shop. They saw everyone asking for unlimited storage, and now they're selling that too (even though they stated they could not do this due to technical limitations, so I guess that was a lie too). They saw that repair cost reduction perks were "overperforming" so they nerfed those without changing repair costs, and then they started selling repair kits in the Atom Shop. Then they thought of Scrap Kits to bypass the grind of walking to your stash and started selling those too. They saw that people tolerate a cosmetic-only store in a 60 bucks game, so they promised us exactly that, only to break that promise many times, only just recently admitting to that. They saw that people like it when games vow that all post-launch content will be free, so they promised that too, only to break that promise as well. 
---
TL:DR; They made the game grindy and intentionally tedious just so they could sell you a solution. They will lie to your face and break any promise if they can get an additional cent from you.
---
Nice one lol
---
It’s what, like 12 bucks or something?  Most peeps I know (US) blow that for one meal.  If you are blessed to be able to afford it, just try it.  If you can’t afford it, buy food or whatever instead.  Serious.  Not trying to be funny.
---
Peace.
---
You can contact your bank for a chargeback but you'll get banned from Fallout 76 and there will be no other way for you to play. PS4 and XBOX users can abuse this as creating another PSN/XBOX account still lets you play.
---
Then why are you crying to a community that warned you not to get it?
---
The "only cosmetic" argument they had a very...VERY SLIM workaround iwth how they said it so that they could argue they never meant PURE COSMETIC ITEMS ONLY in the shop. But everything else they've said has been a lie beceause this 1st membership shit goes against everything they said.
---
Thank you.
---
Itll end the same as every other controversy. It'll just blow over and the game will be fine overall.
---
Good. I hope Bethesda notices this and try's to fix things. Bethesda used to be a great game company who cared about the players more than the money.
---
Maybe.   Wait for Wastelanders, next quarter.  Now is not the time to ask this sub and get a true state.  Too much rage at the latest BGS shenanigans
---
Ok there Alex Jones.
---
Not to mention Fallout 4 GOTY is on sale on consoles for £20/$27 which includes every DLC, has console mod support, and a story.
---
Who’s crying? You sound like you have insecurity issues my friend, take your negativity somewhere else, I’m simply seeking information.
---
Are you on PC. I see some people getting behind the idea.
---
Do the negative Nancy’s ever think that maybe discussing negative points, failures, or frustrations with ideas in the game could, through repeated action, alter the way you view and analyze the world? That’s scary. Pessimistic views don’t bring people
---
Together, lift people up and provide positive feedback to continue pursing, attending to and developing, the action or idea discussed. Bethesda continues to try and you continue to bruise them with your language. 
---
Think of a time you accomplished something you found important to not only yourself but others around you, where they identified the quality and importance of your achievement. Then picture having to continue to grow, research, and expand upon that achievement when everyone around you shifts a viewpoint to entirely complaints. Only flaws identified, your idea no longer valued, etc. Not only that, imagine if they blamed you for issues that they themselves caused using your idea. 
---
Blame is lame. Responsibility, honestly, and respect peeps
---
You're welcome, fellow vault dweller.
---
Tes6 is like few years from now. 5 years maybe. Some peoples say even longer. 
---
A lot can happend in just one year. 
---
Time will tell.

* I *hate* floaters. Giant floating turret fortresses; why? 
---
* People that lock their vending machines behind doors. 
---
* CAMPs where you *have* to walk through their decontamination arch to get to their vendor (some players like high rads)
---
* Laggy whitesprings CAMPs that halve my framerate.
---
To answer the question of what games charge you a subscription after buying it. 
---
The elder scrolls online has this model and at first it was not worth it. All you got was some crowns, xp buff, and a infinite crafting component bag. But after a few years it's one of the most worthwhile subscriptions going with by giving you access to so much content that no one complains about it anymore.
---
I say let see what this fallout subscription evolves into. If it becomes just as good a Esos subscription then there's nothing to worry about. But if it doesn't then that's on bathesda and everyone should be angry.
---
SLI
---
I don’t have any.  They can make them any way they want to.  I just move on.   Even when I get trapped underneath one and have to fast travel out when I just fast travelled in.  Whatever.
---
Sometimes you kinda have no choice but to lock down your vendors if you've hit the cap limit though :-(
---
Amazing. David Chapman, you're a hero and I would LOVE to have you as a mediator between Bethesda and us fans. Please explain to them that making the game grindy and selling the solution is not the way to go, and we can see through BS like nerfing the repair cost reduction perk weeks before the release of repair kits. Same with storage. If it was a technical limitation that prevented endless storage then why is it in their premium season pass (that they promised WOULD NOT EXIST?!). A promise is broken forever as soon as it is broken. But it is not too late to make it right.
---
I’m sorry to tell you there will be next year for fo76 my guts feelings never lies
---
[Intelligence 100]
---
Those poor billionaires.
---
Oblivion still looks just as good to me as it did when I first played. It's a real joy, check it out if you get a chance. It has a kinda ye olde worlde interface anyway so it hasn't aged as poorly as some of the other games from that era.
---
I dunno. 1650 Atoms a month as well as free cosmetics and discounts? That alone is honestly worth the money. But thats just me. ESO's sub is good for whats included but considering how much Atoms cost on their own, I think this is a win in that department.
---
I just power them off \*shrug\*
---
And you seem to have no fucking clue about how replication works, figures.
---
I read “cross dress” at first, ngl.   Lmao, as that already happens.  
---
😂😂
---
Seriously cross play console - yeP!  Console and PC?  Nope.  Think about it.
---
Zenimax was created so Bethesda could live. They got bankrupt and created Zenimax so they could fund Bethesda.
---
Maybe a wahhhmburger and french fries. With a cold Whinekin. That's what's on the menu right now.
---
Who touched you?
---
Someone who is actually playing the game and not circle jerking here with fallout 76 bad ? I am amazed, yes i do the same Thing i hate the sound !
---
People can still buy from them when they have no power though. When you turn off the power all you do is make it so that your vendor doesnt show up on the map.
---
Ok
---
Why would I think about it, 3 of my friends won't buy the game on ps4 cause they can't play with us on pc..... how can you see a downside in crossplay?
---
You can buy it in the windows store if you want to avoid Epic but not wait 👍
---
On the topic of the engine the stuff they said they were doing for TES:VI sounds like they might be improving or even remade the Engine.
---
They're doing digital scans of people and the environments.
---
They release them in Thursday’s, FF (Fallout First) released Wednesday. They probably weren’t ready for the criticism, and if they haven’t responded anywhere it’s likely they are going to make a few altercations.
---
They should have just called the game PR nightmare and it would have been less of a PR nightmare. Collector's edition? PR nightmare. The special promotional Nuka Cola Rum bottle? PR nightmare (granted, for the other company more-so than for bethesda, but a nightmare nonetheless). Atom Shop suddenly contradicting prior promises of being cosmetic only? PR nightmare. Pushing back the first actual content update just before announcing a subscription service, only to discover that every single feature in the subscription service is horrendously broken? PR nightmare. If the name of the game was PR nightmare then perhaps this would have been humorous. But Fallout's name is being dragged through the mud by one of the most beloved developers around. At least they used to be.
---
Why?  Each click just gives him more $$.  More $$, more shitshow.
---
I stopped paying any attention to him years ago.  There are plenty of more informative and less drama queens out there to get info from.
---
Yeah but if they had the scrapbox day one wouldn't people just have an infinite amount of duped semi rare junk? There would be 1000s of people with an infinite amount of ballistic fiber or stable flux and the like to this day right? I agree the fact they have it now behind a pay wall is scummy but the fact that maybe they waited seems like in the long haul maybe a good thing?
---
They will surely make anyone who wants to play wastelanders 3 months "early" be a first member though.
---
I would have settled for them to.make.it 700 atoms like the collectron and the fridge. People would of been upset, but not nearly as much.
---
Really? I was under the impression it needed to be powered to work. Guess that means storing them away, which removes everything from them which is a pain in the neck.
---
Vote with your wallets guys... the only language they understand. As soon as some of bethesda starting to loose their jobs they might get back on track otherwise they keep milking their ip’s with more and more BS.
---
Nobody cares.
---
ncr armor
---
Of course, they're the guys who can actually make a proper fallout game.
---
Sigh.
---
Oh god I hope not lol
---
I’d gladly support the game - if they actually supported it too
---
Maybe a wahhhmburger and french cries. With a cold Whinekin. That's what's on the menu right now.
---
Just get a month. You get some free stuff to offset cost. If it isn't worth $12 anymore, go play Outer Worlds. No sarcasm intended.
---
Dude I would actually pay for this update
---
Good advice, thanks.
---
You're crying because Bethesda took your money and gave you broken crap in return. So sad!
---
Lol crawl back under the rock you cane from kid
---
No this is what you do.......you scrap the wire that connects it to the power source - that way it doesnt show up on the map, but you can still power it back up whenever you want.
---
Then once you do that you place the vendor inside a locked room - that way no one who stumbles upon your CAMP randomly can buy anything if you're over the cap limit.
---
You shouldn't ever scrap or store a vendor. Just hide it.
---
Oh, so these were guys with consoles that were talking about refunds. Ok, thanks for clarification.
---
&gt; it’s likely they are going to make a few altercations
---
I don't know if this was intentional or not but this made me chuckle. Nice :)
---
You need to get some perspective. The loot boxes = gambling thing is an industry wide problem, is regularly discussed on major news outlets and involves a topic that governments care about (gambling, protection of children, and it's a potential revenue stream for them) and are actively beginning to legislate against. 
---
This is becoming an existential concern for the current business model of MMO game services as they have become visible to politicians....who normally don't agree with each other on anything, but do for things like this. 
---
The Fallout1st sitution is, by comparison, of no interest to governments....or for that matter major news outlets. I'd like to say that the BBC website was such a thing....but it isn't - you would need to be featured on BBC news 24 to really become visible...does anyone know if it has?
---
The lack of quality journalism in this article should also be telling. There should, at least, be discussion of both persepectives - it is the job of journalists to inform people so that they can make the decisions for themselves. No matter how much we might agree with what is written, this article is a one sided partisan piece - good only to confirm a view you already hold or discount because you disagree with it already. 
---
This said the article will turn up in Google searches and the like but will rapidly become invisible otherwise.
---
Aged 42 and still using Caps Lock to try and draw attention? Also, nobody cares.
---
Is it as dumb as spending your time trying to tell other people how to spend their money? Good job on the PSA then.
---
I'm starting to wonder if it will happen and how much it will cost per month...
---
Mind if I copy and use this as a response?
---
That has nothing to do with someones CAMP.
---
Well just know that you missed the best part of Fo76 life and it was the first 3-4 months before they needed everything from legendary spawns to weapons to events and kept limiting our fun. Enjoy it just know it was better 6-8 months ago. B4 patch 10.
---
Do you know how to cancel it? I’ve been looking but the only info the site gives you is “sign in to your Bethesda.net account to cancel at anytime”
---
I get that. Wow does the double with buying the expansion but ongoing subscription.
---
I was asking who does all three? I can't think of an example at all.
---
Well, death treats and insults aren't a good way to do it, but you need to try and educate some people on the consequences of their acts.
---
Now if said people WANT the kind of game FO76 is becoming, good for them.
---
You know what's optimisitc? Putting out a 100 dollar season pass for basic fucking features on a game that is still broken after months of patching despite saying publically you'd never do that, and not only expect people to pay for it, but also have your players flock to your defense trying to spin it as a positive move. 
---
And you know what? I guess it worked. So, yeah. Optimism ho!
---
What a fool you are. He's a dev. How can you blame a dev? What a grand and intoxicating innocence. How could you be so naive?
---
As a programmer I can confirm. When I read their explanation I was baffled by the sheer audacity of the lies they've spread. I called it out as BS back then and to see this now is... Satisfying really. It's very validating. To see that after all this time, they really have been lying from the very start... It's amazing to me. The truth is out there right now and not even the most rabid Bethesda fanboy can really take that away now. They lied to us, they broke promises multiple (and admitted to it too) and they finally get the flack they deserve.
---

---
oh oh I get it I get it
---
Scrapbox?
---
Are you seriously going to spend 15 bucks only if they can refund it in case your picky tastes aren't satisfied? How cheap can some people get?
---
Be my guest. :thumbsup:
---
Leave please.
---
Would be more effective if there was one huge post where everyone shared their opinion rather than everyone making a new post to.try and get the most attention.
---
how can we choose server section?
---
who are you to tell me mistah?
---
Typo, I meant alterations, but that too lol
---
Here's my thoughts : i would gladly, GLADLY , pay for game content expansions like wastelanders if it means it is accompanied by AND funds a slew of bug, performance and stability fixes so that the game is fully playable and stays that way and they let us yet it for a month FREE first. 
---
I don't mind giving a company money even if they are breaking their promises, because shit happens but the state of the game is embarrassing and no one should be asking money for that.
---
Wait.....  This makes too much sense. 
---
&lt; hands on ears, closing eyes now&gt;
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Agreed.
---
Really I thought the definition of P2w was to give one an advantage for monetary gain but what do I know English is only my first language.
---
True that. Not to mention they sold us the community requested item. The fridge was an idea I saw on this subreddit literally during the first week after launch, and Bethesda representatives responded that they would take the feedback into consideration. If we just got a white fridge, and they sold us futuristic fridges and nuka cola themed fridges, I would be more than happy to buy a skin with atom points I get from challenges. But this... No.
---
There are a thousand other threads complaining about Fallout 1st. You can take it over there.
---
They are in deed modifying it, not "moderating" it.   
---
Moderation suggests fairness. Bethesda's "Forum" is nothing but a business-facade.
---
Thumbs up to you for getting it right the first time.
---
I would agree with your assessment. I've played several MMOs that give out cash store stipends, before FO1st, I have literally never EVER seen one that gave out more of its in-store funbucks than you can buy with the same amount of money. Usually you get like $5 worth out of your $15-$20 sub. This is giving us $15 worth on a $12.99 sub? That's practically begging people to buy Atom shop items.
---
Be careful, Potato. There was outrage for a few days but this sub-reddit is back to being a massive circlejerk again. Saying anything bad about fallout first will get you downvoted into oblivion. There's no hope for the fanboys, they'll defend Bethesda to the death.
---
Everything about FO76 was designed to get you to keep spending. Promise after promise was made to keep you spending.
---
The sad thing is people were having fun with FO76 despite the game, not because of it. They've just convinced themselves of the opposite.
---
🤔
---
but this one's more fun to be in!
---
can i be honest? FF is not completely a bad idea my man, but it was way too early for it with game having 0 new content for this past and future 4 months and all, and you guys buying it this early proves beth that they can get away with anything :(
---
Yeah, I know it's rather cheap as an absolute value. The price for sub in my country is ~18 bucks and still it's a low-end restaurant check. Or like a bottle of some alcohol. So yeah, I see what you're saying here but I never spent money on in-game stuff like that (as for this game I just bought it for 30 bucks a year ago) so I gotta wrap my head around this concept to justify the purchase somehow.
---
Just checked, Charleston WV is about 2000 miles (3218km) from Hoover dam
---
Lol there's no room in my CAMP for me to lock away a vending machine, it's a very tightly packed decorated space. I usually just take stuff when I hit max caps.
---
Thanks! Just want to know how stuff works here.
---
But fallout 4 didn't have 16 times the monetizat-, DETAIL, I mean detail.
---
Are you even surprised? That's what they have been doing since the game launched. They act as consumers white knights, but they are just literally the same as the companies they shit on: they would do anything for a few more cents.
---
“Um.... excuse me Reddit? Can you guys just stop complaining about likely the most controversial event for Fallout ever, just for me?”
---
Imagine GTA 5 asking for $13/mo. to use their invite only lobbies. 
---
"Avoid trihards and Mk.II griefers for the low price of $100/yr. Grind for your gta$ (instead of buying a sharkcard) in peace with GTA 1st."
---
But it makes my miner build complete! We really do need more skins for other guns tho
---
&gt;It doesn't come with 'a' price tag, it comes with 3 price tags - the upfront cost of the game, the cost of purchasing Atoms and now the subscription model. How many games do you know that employ all three of these monetisation models in the same game?
---
TESO :)
---
Timespan
---
Or, OR! People can get angry at the morons who purchased the sub for being the sort of degenerate that helped to let the industry know what kinds of garbage they could get away with. By supporting these shitty business practices, they make the industry worse.  
---
So yes: Be angry at these sorts of player.
---
I also notice the original post has 0 upvotes as well. And some of my comments are upvoted as well. The downvotes i have are from the private circle jerk inside the comments. Probably even duplicate accounts from the same guy. I don't care about upvote wars, i'm more for common sense. Fallout First is a scam and people who buy it are idiots. Simple. Feel free to check BBC, IGN, all all other media surrounding Fallout 76 and Fallout First to see all the "downvotes".
---
Oh wow. WOW!
---
I'm both flabbergasted and not surprised at the same time. I'd always thought it was just upfront and subscription only like WoW.
---
Wow...
---
OP has no appreciation for abstract art
---
By bandwagon you mean dozen and dozens of hate posts against Bethesda? IGN and BBC calling out Fallout First as a shitty product? ahahah whta a circle jerk. Go back to your collecting "cool emotes".
---
Counterpoint (you probably call it a defense, I call it adding info to try to help round out others’ understanding)
---
Some of us (I don’t speak for all of course) have no remorse, because:
---
we piss away on other things more than the cost of the sub
---
we know exactly what we are getting
---
Many of us use it for chill time, and don’t get bent out of shape over every fuck up on BGS part.   Some of us expect it, laugh at it, etc.
---
I could go on and on.
---
The world has changed, roll with it.   Look at the state of US politics.  It’s different now, lol.
---
Everyone who doesn’t play was really angry about the game not having NPCs. Each DLC Drop has three little circles under them, faze 1-3. In drop 2 (nuclear winter) 2 &amp; 3 were cancelled to focus on wastelanders, now we’re here with no new content in who knows how long. I think they listened too much
---
👍
---
It wouldn't be difficult. In adventure mode, if you're on pc you cant enter pvp unless you are on controller. Like the new Modern Warfare.
---
“The BBC has approached Bethesda for comment”
---
I’ll not hold my breath for a response, you know because I like to live...
---
Sounds like a great, but pointless, idea, I like it!
---
Eso dose it. You buy the base game, you buy crowns for store (basically the atom shop in this example) and they have a subscription.
---
That's the only game I can think of that does this other than fallout 76 now.
---
Don’t hate me because I’m beautiful.
---
My travel tent killed the scorchbeast queen for me today. It was fantastic. I just took a nap inside and went AFK.
---
They know that they’ll be wearing it soon enough
---
Hot pockets are amazing, please show some respect and don't compare them to this disaster
---
Every 'contents' included in fallout(fk u)1st should be free for everyone who bought the goddamn game.
---
Here's a guy that did just [that!](https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland/status/1187446248812318720?s=19)
---
It becomes a completely different issue once money, or potential revenue is on the line. 
---
Lets assume the people who told the public that an infinite stash  affects performance, don't have much knowledge about writing code and programming: what would the  developer, that is accountable for this, gain by lying to their superiors or to the PR department that has to convey that message of server instability to the public?
---
And people are not really confusing idiocy with lies, they just assume the worst case. And the companies have proven more often than not what they are willing to do for money.
---
Yep, unfortunate, but it was foreseeable though, last ones left will go this way to. Obisdin and CD Project Red will have to in a few years to compete in the market. All because people can't stop feeding corporate greed.
---
Man, the whining over this update is blowing my mind.  Kids are getting so upset that BGS isn't just giving them everything for free, for ever.
---
I had initial thoughts of subbing for a month to get some solo play.  Don't care about the skins or stash box stuff.  Fired up the game for the first time in a couple months, realized I've already done everything there is to do (except drop the bomb) and I have no real desire to keep playing.  Couple hundred hours and I've got everything out of the game I wanted.  Don't need a private server when the map is mostly empty anyway.
---
Why would I get upset over what BGS has done?  The sense of betrayal amongst the children here is crazy.
---
I hade my hopes up through it all, but all these broken promises and cash-grab moves and lies add up.
---
I had enough and left when the scrap bot went online, with a promise of forever blacklisting bethesda in the future.  
---
This subscriptionjunk just added to the cake and I hope more people are vocal and act against these kind of developer behaviours we are seeing around the globe.
---
CAMPs built frugally out of non-Atom Shop walls, floors, and furnishings are a blight on the landscape. How can other players appreciate your wealth and taste if your CAMP isn't stuffed to the build limit with every premium fixture available?
---
Well here comes my down votes. 
---
It is the necessary architecture for future mods. Yes I know they aren't implemented as it is.
---
Bethesda is synonymous with mods, but this game was created as a live service, funded by the atom store. Problem is that there is no way Bethesda is going to compete with the modding community. Once those are introduced the atom store would be done, Bethesda was going to have to make money off of mods. I personally wouldn't have a problem with them charging for them, provided the lion's share went to the modders, there are many talented people out there who deserve to get paid. Of course that won't happen. 
---
It is an interesting solution they came up with, the 1st service provides players with private servers where they can play with mods, it provides Bethesda with an income to support the game and it even artificially keeps the atom shop alive by providing players with atoms they can only spend there. Of course I anticipate that not working and most of those rebated atoms will just pile up. 
---
Yes I know many say Bethesda is going to charge for mods anyways. If that happens I reserve the right to change my mind. Maybe that is why they are providing atoms with the subscription, for players to offset the cost of mods, a frugal player should be able to purchase a mod or two a month without investing nore than the monthly fee. 
---
Well here they come.
---
Yeah! Stop copying others!
---
it doesn't have to be a fair comparison, it's the same principle. The analogy is hyperbolic because in this context, this is what it feels like. No it's not the end of the world at large. But it is the end of \*this\* world, however small it may be. It's still important to people and that's why these comparisons get drawn in the first place.
---
I dont get why u care what other player do? Stop playing the game and stop posting about it, move on, learn to let go. Your choice and my choice are not the same, i have yet to get burned by this game and actually glad they came out with private servers and really 100.00 is not a big deal at least not to me and i didnt pay 60.00 for the game i paid 15.00  just move on my friend plenty other games out there no one says u have to play this ket alone complain about it.
---
&gt; Played it since the Beta, defended it to my friends and the community but now I can't do that anymore. 
---
Same here, played it, liked most of it, defended it, got disappointed, kept hope up, got more disappointed, lost all hope.
---
And now I kind of regret even defending it in the first place. Didn't play since the release of scrap bot, uninstalled the game and launcher yesterday.
---
Look, it's not being cheap. It's that if some service doesn't live up to your expectations and the company fails to deliver the desired quality, it does not deserve to be paid for, no matter how cheap they're selling it. I want to get at least some convenience (improved server stability/faster server response times), if I won't get it, then this is not worth paying for, whatever their pricetag for this service is.
---
This 100%.
---
The Artillery stash glitch was also proof of this! It didn't cause the game to lag or crash anymore than it already was!
---
If this issue is OP's biggest concern in life (as it appears) then they have a hard life ahead of them.
---
Not pay to win at all
---
Cause they can monetize AAA titles. It's rare anymore to get even single player games without microtransactions, if not at launch then a month or two down the line .. cosmetic or otherwise.
---
AAA games now are closer to mobile games than they've ever been while AA games .. such as The outer worlds are offering an amazing experience in a AA title with no MTX. 
---
I believe it comes down to the consumer now to vote with their wallet and support the games that deserve it and toss the ones that only try to nickle and dime you to death.
---
My camp is a floating, twisting , turning confusing maze with an empty room in the middle placed specifically to block a main road..... lol I can hear your ocd turning the cogs in your head from here!
---
You asked if you can refund it, not if it's worth it.
---
Wait but isn't Bethesda's Fallout franchise a cheap fallout ripoff?
---
Like, isometric RPG turned FPS and more sour with every iteration?
---
It’s a huge mess but with some effort you can build amazing things in 76, and ppl can come to what you build in a cool world. On console it has a ton going for it :) I stay away from Minecraft because I think I’d get addicted to it haha 
---
If they added some more switch/trigger options it would help me a ton. Right now I’ve been working on an “indoor skydiving” place. You go into a room, pull a switch, floor breaks, you fall, die, and a bunch of Tesla coils juggle your body like indoor skydiving haha
---
Nope. Get fucked. I refuse to put play time and login statistics into Bethesdas calculations after this. I'm not to the point of uninstalling, as I've devoted far too much time into my character, but this is a direct contradiction to everything their marketing and promotional teams outlined. 
---
Even if they rescind this asinine subscription model, ranger armor will be shoot on sight. They lied, and players like you enable it. Bottom line.
---
Lol that’s pretty good
---
I avoid picking them up entirely as a few times they have glitched out and infiantely duplicated themselves in my inventory, spamming the centre of my screen every time!
---
Hey 'fellow gamer' it's because of people like you paying for Bethesda's bullshit that they get away with this shit in the first place. The only way to put an end to it is to not give them money.
---
So I can understand their frustration with people like you.
---
&gt; Name a free to play game that didnt also include pay to win features or a crap ton of advertisements?
---
League of Legends.
---
The problem isn't charging for servers. The problem is locking the unlimited junk stash behind that payment
---
I would have bought it, but the paywall for a junk stash turned me away
---
same with hardened mass; I think it's because it scraps everything once you stash them in the box
---
&gt;Buying a broken game at launch for 60$
---
That and pre-ordering is *your* fault.  I did what any intelligent person would do and waited for reviews - and also a heavy, heavy discount a couple weeks later.
---
Outer Worlds is supposed to be the next coming of Christ, but for $60, I'm not touching it until many more reviews are in.  So far it looks like about 30 hours of game play and that's not worth $60 either.
---
Expected them not to be freely traversable as in public x private.
---
That puts public players to disadvantage.
---
Want to play private? Make new char, exclusive to your server.
---
Once there was I time people could host their own servers on their computers. Maybe some expected it to be that way.
---
They are not really private, since you are not being able to become the server and write your own rules. It is more like an exclusive premium mode where there is no lag, no latence, better hit detection and smoother silo runs and vault raids.
---
This is my third refund, haha.
---
If that happens is be Curious to see the validity of a lawsuit. We purchased a product with the promise of future added content without added cost. We received an incomplete product by its very sale definition, and would be prevented from playing this new content, that we paid for with our initial purchase.
---
Then how do they differ from the greedy Zenimax's managers so heavily criticized by them? :)
---
I would expect them to be free. A multitude of games allow for private games to be played with no cost. As much as I enjoy 76, its pretty brazen to charge for a private world. If they took that and the stash limit out, the atoms alone would be worth the sub.
---
Regular sledgehammer? Don't we start the game already knowing how to make them?
---
That could be a practical solution since is more available, the prime explosive bait.
---
&gt;Potato
---
&gt;oblivion
---
I see what you did there.
---
Match-based.
---
That's an apples-to-oranges comparison.  And the sub doesnt give ANY benefits to Nuclear Winter, which would be a more direct mode to compare with at least.
---
And regardless....
---

---
I've also played at launch and the content  was very bleak and lackluster to say the least lost my xbox one than I ended up getting ps4pro the beginning of the year and picked up fallout 76  a couple months ago, and everything I've seen them add since my last time of playing is phenomenal. Still have them random scenarios with gangster teddy bears or Jangles the moon Jet monkey playing golf and horribly missing leaving me to pick up 25 golf balls
---
I say it will be a launch title for the next console generation. It has enough appeal to get people to buy the console at launch.
---
You're kinda late
---
Let’s make progress and discuss: what is so bad about personal servers (write a list of explanations here) THeN write a list of good things about a personal server (write a list of explanations here)
---
What are supposed to be the issues so folks can look out for them?
---
[I’m actually not ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmbtft/breaking_bethesda_updates_stance_on_fallout_1st/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Haha is your brain malfunctioning?
---
Beth is like any other company a company that wants to make a profit. 
---
If they realize (and they obviously already have), that the game cannot be saved into a state that will attract new paying players (bad press and bad game killed fo76), thry try to milk as many loyal fanboys as they can milk.
---
It's the same with a lot of failed games. They have a small, well paying community and you can get even if you reduce support and development to a minimum but add stuff into the microtrans section. 
---
After a year or 2 cease support and after some years stomp the game once you can release something else.
---
Dunno about Xbox, but on PS4 the atom shop often doesn't load for me until after I've been connected to a server for awhile. It frequently just sits on the main screen with a loading icon and never loads.
---
HAHAHAHAAHAHA
---
Mass Effect meets Fallout, so wonderful.
---
Sure sound fun. PC?
---
Yes, it’s all coming together, We already paid $59.99 at launch. Plus no refunds so they should have cash right??
---
Can I be honest? You are not a voice crying in the wilderness, and you are not going to start a revolution. You just come across as somebody crying about a $12 a month optional fee. People are going to do what they want, trust me on that one.. just like you're probably going to go start another thread bitching about the game.
---
Yes. In patch 14
---
It’s 12$.. not a pay check lol.
---
Well, I'm not the boss.
---
Its good its more of a pure RPG play through once or twice not much replay value, I have the game pass on pc so was free lol
---
Oh I think they've created plenty of altercations
---
not complaining but I try to keep my Bethesda expectations around the drunken Uncle at Christmas level. I'm not expecting great, I'm just hoping it doesn't go too badly and leave me with vomit on the carpet and the cat missing. Again.
---
Can we elect this man to rep all of us?
---
Bro i dont even play fo76. I wanted to play first time in 6 months, read that shit and already uninstalled
---
Probably busy thinking of ways to monetize or make Wastelanders only accesible for Fallout F&amp;\*\^YOU First members.
---
i thought they fixed it in the patch, other users reported it working fine in public servers as well. (im also no longer having freezes with my auto shotty)
---
I think it will be like Oblivion. It will still look awsome at launch. The best and easiest way to sell more copies.
---
Next week?
---
I'm here because I'm taking a deuce and my machine is installing outer worlds. probably still try at least a month of the 76 premium service. What the hell, if it isn't fun I'll stop doing it. No need to overthink it.
---
&gt;There’s been a bunch of comments about how this subreddit was never really a positive one. I think I’ll walk back my original statement; compared to the General fallout subreddit, this one has been largely positive.
---
/r/Fallout has a mod announcement about not making death threats, so that's the bar you're measuring this sub with.
---
&gt;by one of the most beloved developers around.
---
What world did I wake up in?!?!
---
Common to see in mobile games. FYI.
---
I prefer this system as it balances the Whales and the Smaller Fish (100 USD was worth a 30 USD Monthly in a game I played).
---
Don't gotta try fallout 1st to see that it's greedy as fuck, that's why reviews exist and why there's plenty of sources available to read up on what you buy before you actually buy it, so idk why you gotta buy something to have an opinion about it
---
They got out cash at launch, I can’t get a refund from them of $59.99 that could’ve been put towards something else. Sure they fixed it but this is a new damn low for them, they just sat there and said “Nah we want more cash, make it so you have to pay for what you want!” What about console players?? They already pay $60 a year to connect....
---
You are like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.
---
Of course. It's also written there before you subscribe.
---
man, I kind of dig it too
---
The Inside Gaming youtube channel said the reason this pay to win mechanic was pushed ahead of Wastelands may be because the microtransaction revenues may be too low to justify putting developers on the game. This could also explain why the release is so buggy and garbage. They did not invest the resources into getting this right. It also means they could sunset development because they are not making enough money. Executves just care about profits. The microtransactions are their to make money and justify continued development. So they pushed out a buggy game expecting the Fallout name to get sales and then microtransactions to make them money to support developers to fix it at additional expense.
---
I have done the Nuke run 2 times,and fallen at the last.when entering the code.3 TIMES
---
First time i just thought i had entered the incorrect code.
---
I decided i would make sure i had 2 Nuke Keycards for the second run.
---
Second run i entered the Code showing up on [Falloutbuilds.com](https://Falloutbuilds.com).= WRONG CODE.
---
Used up my second Nuke Keycard = WRONG CODE.
---
Not sure where i am  going wrong ?
---
The second time it happened another Reddit user had also had the same problem.
---
Does one still need to collect all the code pieces.Even though the code is deciphered ?
---
Written in the info?
---
Wait, what info? Is there something I've been missing? Am I able to give my CAMP a biography?
---
😂 😂 😂
---
&gt;Unofficial Community Patch
---
The Unofficial Community Patch is behind the Fallout 1st paywall, so tough luck.
---
So bad written, they didn't even read the whole original source.
---
Can we all wear matching vault tech suits and do it on multiple platforms? I haven’t scraped my suit yet and finally we have use for it
---
Too late, I already uninstalled the game... but its a good idea.
---
That civil war had largely died down because either people abandoned the franchise, loved Bethesda’s take on it or just got used to the fact that it’s never going back to 1-2 times, or even to New Vegas. But with 76 Bethesda has literally dropped atom bomb on itself and its most loyal fanbase. This game not only necromanced the “Bethesda killed Fallout” argument back from the dead, but converted a large chunk of fanbase to it.
---
We need to chant this
---
They can't Bethesda forgot to add privacy options to the private servers.
---
Yes and no. Ofcourse you as a customer shouldn't be harassed for purchases you enjoy.
---
But at this point it's getting close to warfare and as a buyer(supporter) of the product(ideology), you are actively taking part in the cause of peoples anger.   
---
Supporting the bad guy with resources.
---
Something that never gonna happen.
---
I can't speak for elite dangerous but you definitely wouldn't want the GTA model for 76. With GTA you can buy in game currency. Imagine being able to buy caps. That would remove the cap stash limit and would allow you to purchase a million caps if you wanted to. This would allow you to purchase junk, plans, virtually anything you wanted at vendors. This would cause prices to skyrocket and the value of god roll weapons to be unobtainable by anyone not purchasing caps.
---
Or get game pass for pc and get it included on the windows store.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFcLyDb6niA&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I'm just salty I'd have no friends to enjoy the private server with.
---
Camps that are built high up and off the edge of a cliff. I ft there not knowing and sometimes spawn in before the camp appears. So end up falling down and either dying or I’m crippled.
---
So he is being Peter Hides again?
---
You paid for a subscription with a scrap box, after what they said about the stash limit too.
---
Not saying it right, but you've put a target on your back for supporting besthdea lying. I'd recommend not wearing the ranger outfit till things calm down
---
Dude. No future expansions are behind a paywall that has not changes. Private servers and the related atom subscription attached don’t change that.
---
Heres hoping it makes them get their shit together because 76 is too much fun to be ruined further by their greed shit
---
I still love the game, fun to play. Thinking about getting it? Sure. I don't see the issues you can still play the same. I've been playing since release and have spent no money and I'll continue to do so as long as Bethesda allows this.
---
That is some perspective that is quite depressing.
---
You're right.  
---
\#We'reAllGoingDownTogether
---
Of all things that are not going to happen, this is not gonna happen the most.
---
It's not an atom subscription
---
It seems hilarious, yes.
---
You pay $100 for the year and receive 1660 atoms per month.
---
You do realise these "private" servers are just recycled adventure servers
---
They are not. Do you mind answering my questions?
---
Lol.... internet whiners as always belive forums and Reddit is most of a companys customers. Its hilarious. We are a drop in the ocean.
---
When they are selling and they make it extremely hard to find your vending machines. 
---
Let's put them through this way up this way that way back and to the front that leads upstairs and the back..
---
Nah next camp.
---
Yes I do and I've spent money on this game too, I love Fallout as a franchise but I won't be playing this anymore
---
They are
---
Not really. You’re rely on assumptions and fiction. I rely on facts. 100000%
---
Cool. Thanks for contributing. Why did you say people are forced to play fallout 1st then.
---
Nothing truer could be said
---
AMEN! And if playing on PC uninstall their crappy launcher too
---
We have too much faith in wastelanders.
---
Yeah pretty much including the rumour of them adding P2W weapons etc
---
It's wrong to throw insults at anyone, but if you want hear some constructive criticism: People like you are the problem. People like you are why companies keep doing this sort of stuff over and over again. You pay for a broken product made from a company that doesn't respect you, then cry "blame them, not me!". Nope, I can't blame them for taking your money if you're willing ti give it to them. That's how markets work. It's the consumer, you, that's the problem. You might say it's your right to spend your money however you like, which is true, but that doesn't change the fact that by doing so you are contributing into creating the mess there is in today's state of gaming. So, do report the people that are harassing you, but take a moment and think one thing: You are a tool, and by being so you are making sure others can't have nice things.
---
No. They are not. This has already been addressed. A new server is spun up when a 1st player logs on, however this doesn’t change things that Cary over between servers that are tied to players like looted containers.
---
Owl.........NO!
---
I don’t like this argument because they made NV without having to design an engine, mechanics, and all of the other things that had to be considered on 3. They basically only had to  focus on new models and story/quest lines for the years of development.
---
I wish this come true. 
---
I think the other title becomes that. The one in space.
---
You basically are is you want to have better camp space or unlimited junk storage (which gets destroyed when you leave) that may have been fixed now
---
.38 is good if you want to give a fully moded hunting rifle to a low level. .308 are harder to find at start.
---
People expected a few bucks a month for private servers. The anger is with unlimited stash tied to it. Private servers became even more pay to win. Have a server yourself. Control everything. Stash it all. People not paying are still worrying about inventory management. 
---
Before, it was fine because it was part of the game and part of the challenge everyone had to face together. Now its cheapened cause you can just literally pay to skip part of the experience. It makes the game easier for the people who pay more cash. 
---
Lastly, raising the stash more and more was always promised as part of their free updates.  And atoms and paid dlc would be cosmetics only.  So they completely shifted from what they told us a year ago.
---
Could you imagine the lag there would be with cross play during vault raids or or the sbq event, big groups. 
---
Oh man I could see it now.
---
I would be mad if I had to pay. But its optional. I'm mad about how high the price is for such a small reward. 
---
But as others have said, they expected this, they need income. And it's not even as expensive as some other games. I still play for free so it doesn't bother me all that much.
---
Right.
---
A tiny tiny tiny tiny % engste in forums.

---
I was under the impression that a private server was going to be privately hosted by a player and the server is it's own unique profile for the player. Like Minecraft for example
---
If just this text was inaccurate...
---
True, haha.
---
Camp spec is exactly the same. Junk space is the same. 
---
Scrap spec is unlimited and the bug has already been fixed.
---
You should probably educate yourself on what an actual lynching is and not use that word for anything ever again.
---
But it should..it won't but it should.
---
they aren’t. just a bad rumor.  also no ones forced to pay anything. also why do people keep saying these things should be free since the start?
---
That's good then shame they can't give other things that fast like the power armour glitch
---
Yes. It’s not as big of an issue for a melee character but sometimes I’d switch to a knife for low level areas and I’d get the lag. The hits not registering was a common one and a real pain when you count on killing things in one hit. I’m on Xbox. You’re welcome to try it out with me, I’m usually on in the afternoons EST.
---
We on PC?
---
Complaining about broken game you played for 100's of hours = stupid
---
Complaining about broken game you hardly ever played = stupid
---
Well some fixes are a mater of just flipping a variable in code where other things are more complicated. Not all bugs are created equal.
---
"I aint no Commie, but i get where they are growing from ! "
---
Of course but that's been happening for months 😂
---
Attaboy 👊😎
---
You still have issues? Really?
---
I usually bulk to sell. And plus it's a OCD thing. To many loose things drive me crazy same as a locked door, no more locked doors!
---
Customer goodwill, like everything else in the world, is also not free, ya know. Bethesda can't release a shitty product and expect everyone to buy into the fantasy that it's not shit.
---
Yep me and my friends do from time to time
---
Yes, I go by same user name on Beth launcher.
---
I'm down for that.
---
since you won’t be playing anymore can i have your items. you won’t let me have them because your not gonna quit. i’ve asked this many times. for some reason everyone wants to keep the items in a game they will no longer play. not a single person has taken me up on my offer. will you?
---
Outer worlds is not like fo76! People stop sayong that please. The only way outer worlds could be like fo76 is if it had a ton of mtx and a shitcrap monthly subscription.
---
Nope, the fanboys just heard forever free and assumed it applied to everything Todd said after that.
---
Keep in mind that some of the people complaining the loudest don't even play it.
---
Well if players would leave their purifiers unlocked so you would have water access as you traveled you would not need to come back to a large stash of collected water.
---
Yes, 'Zacrynix' is my name on Beth launcher.
---
Perhaps because Pete Hines said it from the start?
---
🤔👍
---
I may come back to the game in future plans I'm on Xbox one so that maybe an issue anyway
---
Wait a minute and try again.  Still loading in
---
of course you will.
---
You'll just have to add me on Beth launcher through friend request. I'll then invite you.  
---
I use the same user name as Reddit.
---
Bugfesta*
---
Fell free to join, I'm 'Zacrynix' on Beth launcher.
---
lol same reason trolls troll on shit mate ... to get satisfaction LOL. why read about something when there is no better understanding of something then first hand experience and knowledge. If you read about something it's someone eleses opinion and not your personal experience?  .... 😁👍🏻I prefer a hands on seeing and experiencing for my self before someone's opinion based on their experience.
---
Server hop sometimes it glitches. The Burrows also does this.
---
Yes, and I go by same user name.
---
That was my first thought but ive been standing in front of the door for like 5 mins
---
Honestly the stash limit has been the only thing that's really stressed me in the game. I feel like they added this road block on purpose so that they could  charge to lossen it up. And now it looks like they have with the subscription model. 
---
Well fuck em. I'm never going to buy a game I can't mod on my own from them ever again.
---
Yup, just add me on Beth launcher.  
---
I'm 'Zacrynix', same as Reddit.
---
Well if Bethesda puts the wastelanders DLC in the private servers which in fully expecting them to as I don't want to get my hopes up then I won't ever come back plus I'd rather give my items to my real life friends who deserve it
---
Agreed.  Except I don’t think non-BGS hosted is going to happen.
---
With a couple of bloodied players it would be possible in that amount of time, but yeah not nice being rushed and wasting ammo!
---
Hmmmm. 🤔
---
Mind if I borrow this for our chant? :D
---
Game share also shares subscriptions however since fallouts subscription is with Bethesda I'm not sure
---
Yeah they said it was coming out soon. The reporters didn't do any research.
---
I can insult anyone I want. People you like you, people like them. You guys are the reason this shit keeps happening in the game industry. Stop. Defending. It.
---
They already said they aren’t doing this. What is with the conspiracy theories. Future expansions have always and will always be free.
---
I'd join you but I uninstalled the game.
---
&gt;The $60 was the fee you paid to be advertised to.
---
I mean... there is a game in there... it's not he "played a LOT, bought ATOMs, engaged in the community, and had a lot of genuine fun" for ten months in a vacuum. The idea that somehow he spent all this time enjoying himself 'despite the game' and just has convinced himself of the opposite is sort of absurd. 
---
There's a good, fun game in the box with around 100 hours of content. 
---
&gt;It's like going to Disney World expecting a great experience, only to find that literally everything interesting costs even more money to do.
---
It's not though, is it? Because everything interesting in F076 hasn't cost more money to access. Unless you're arguing that the fridge is more interesting Whitesprings.
---
yea bro whatever. your not rage quitting. just raging. no problem with that. if they did put wastelanders on a private server that would be fucked up cant argue with that. if they do that, hit me up and i’ll invite you to mine.
---
😂😂😂. Again, you rely on fiction.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce
---
Under "Icons and Emote pack", they say
---
"The Ranger Armor Outfit, player icons and emotes must be claimed from the Atomic Shop while your Fallout 1st membership is active. If you cancel your membership after claiming them, you will still have access to them."
---
Ding!
---
That’s not new...
---
Have you ever tried trading with someone who was using the infinite inventory glitch? The thing takes at least 3 minutes to fucking load their inventory.
---
........what!? lol sounds like a bug surely? I'm sure they said it's unlimited stash. I suppose it is called scrapbox.
---
It's wishful thinking I know, but as far as I can see it's the only way free mods will happen. Of course I'm not omniscienct so there might be another solution out there.
---
Thanks heaps man x
---
I bought it for 17€ about 2 weeks ago and it sucked me in completely. I’m also glad I waited this long to start with it - even all the recent trouble doesn’t really bother me cause you can decide on your own how to play this game. So yes, 13£ is an absolutely reasonable price. You won’t regret it. There is lots of stuff to do.
---
I think vaulting items with the  "buy now" approach is less beneficial in the long run...
---
🤔😁👍
---
code is just a bunch of zeroes
---
I’ve had that argument with so many people. I can cut the clip from October 2018 where it was publicly announced that the servers were always hosted by them, always online, and as a service.
---
It’s like telling a donkey Kevin Bacon was in footloose
---
Walk around the block. Don’t just stand in front.
---
Werd.  That got it.  Thanks.
---
Wonder what happened here - did this community became so much toxic in a week?
---
I meant when you point your cursor on someone's camp it shows how many items a person sells
---
I'll be the first to point out their mistakes (creation club, horse armor, blades) but they were very loved prior to the creation club. Fallout 4 was not without its flaws but it was very well received and Skyrim is still being re-re-re-re-released because people still love it over 8 years after release.
---
Oh noes.   That’s a server busted thing.  Server hop.
---
The scrap box was already fixed. 
---
The “private” was included in FAQ  and control of who joins is a feature coming soon.
---
i went there last night
---
Oh. Oh, holy shit. I've had a map mod going this whole time and never even noticed that was a thing.
---
Belive what you want. Whats in your head doesnt change reality ;)
---
Unlimited scrap, not junk.
---
I wouldn't blame the hands to the keyboard people for this.  Besides, learning "what not to do" is important ;)
---
Legendary Chapman Cheers!!!
---
It'll be over...until the next round of perks come with having a subscription...
---
What’s in my head is facts, so yes I will believe facts because atleast then I know I’m right. Simple, lol.
---

There you go.
---
Adding private rules for your server is coming later FYI
---
You are really taking this personally bud. Maybe take a break from the game? You shouldn’t be attack people over this. It’s kinda sad.
---
Can’t you jut scrap sledges to learn the mods?
---
You don’t need to have 1st to play on a private world only the host requires it.
---
Why would I want someone who hasn't played the game in 8 months be a mediator?  I would probably want someone more familiar with the current state of the game to mediate rather than someone who has already given up on the game.
---
No they aren’t. Just as long as the server timeout (30-60min).
---
“Oh noes! Da bots!!11”
---
Lol!
---
I haven't played the game in 6 months, bud. Nice copypasta reply for everyone who disagrees with the game or your opinion. I'm here because I supported the game form the start and then saw it needed some player opinions.
---
That's not the primary reason to pay for the subscription
---
I would rather have ammo weigh 0 than scrap weigh 0
---
Goodbye now
---
So you hang out in a game sub you haven’t played for 6 months.
---
Ok- that’s more sad.
---
Bootlicker. Fallout 4 wasn't even a fallout game. No choice no RPG
---
You see, they made Fallout 1 and 2, and many people criticized the new engine and playstyle (and genre, and writers, and, and, and,) of Fallout 3. It was outsourced to Obsidian and they proved that this new format works for the franchise. Their writing was far more interesting and their branching narratives and faction system still holds up. So much so that in Fallout 4 Bethesda tried to replicate the faction-based story, but it fell flat when compared to New Vegas. Bethesda holds the IP, but Obsidian is the one that makes the franchise work. Besides, Bethesda didn't make the engine. They used the Gamebryo engine, which is still being used today. Yeah, they designed the mechanics and made the framework that was later used by Obsidian, but it's not like they had to rush it out while making everything from scratch.
---
I showed up last night to voice my discontent. You're really upset about the hate the game is getting.
---
Just quit replying to my comments. That's pretty easy.
---
Idiocracy cackles in the face of realism. I wonder why.
---
It’ll get better for you kid I am sure of it.
---
I think its so expensive because you get atoms as well. If a cheaper model is requested,  theyre going to do away with atoms include which is a bummer
---
It's been like that for months now, the date and time will go forward and then revert itself back to Rec Day when you refresh the server.
---
Yes that is exactly what adults say.
---
That's not how it works within the industry. It depends on so many other factors beyond what project you worked on.
---
Do you think the writer of the for the Mistress of Mysteries quest or for Biv's dialogue is going to be laughed out of the room? What about the vending machine texture artists? Wendigo animators?
---
Also, the industry is relatively small. Small enough that people tend to know of each other. Maybe not at the lower levels but certainly further up the chain.
---
Not as sad as you may think.
---
it's a cute idea. but that means that I'd have to log in to the game. For me, for my protest, I'm going to demonstrate in a way that's visible on a spreadsheet. By not playing.
---
Camps that show 200+ plans from level 500 players and its things like ultracite power armor pieces, mirelurk jerky, water filters, chemistry benches etc....basically plans only low levels will be interested in. Whenever I get dupes of common plans, I’ll go and dump them in an overseer cache somewhere so a new player can get some new plans. 
---
Oh and underground glitch bases the require you glitching through some wall or something just to access the vendor. Keep your cool glitch base, but make the vending machines easily accessible.
---
Didn’t you already say goodbye? I thought you were leaving?
---
Good idea. :)

Shaming me for voicing my opinion is pretty scummy. Take a look in the mirror some time. Y'might learn something. I came to this sub to voice my opinion on the absolutely garbage decision Bethesda made. I invested money into this game - I'm absolutely in my right to voice that opinion. You insinuating that I'm upset or "sad" is fucking idiotic. Get lost troll.
---
No one shamed you- I actually had to remind you shouldn’t be attacking people over this. Let’s not project your guilt on me now. I hope your day gets better.
---
Couple days too late with this post man. This has been repeated 100 times. Nice attempt at some lhamra though bud. Jesus.
---
You said it, man.
---
Your getting destroyed on this thread. Just let it go dude.
---
&gt; The scrap box was already fixed.
---
It shouldn't have been released broken to begin with. 
---
&gt; The “private” was included in FAQ and control of who joins is a feature coming soon.
---
This should have been a bare minimum feature. It's just been a bait and switch. 
---
&gt; They promised all future expansions will be free. This has not changed.
---
They promised no season passes or paid DLC. No matter how you twist or turn it, Fallout 1st is paid DLC. It's content that can only be obtained through direct monetary payment. You can make that argument with the Atom shop since you can earn atoms in-game, but not with Fallout 1st. Besides, I outlined 2 promises broken, and the other one is not just me saying that. [Bethesda admitted that they will be breaking that promise](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more). What makes you think they won't break another promise just to monetize the hell out of the remaining players?
---
You are arguing and attacking people over a simple game that you don’t even play. 
---
Kinda sounds like you need to get a life to be honest.. when you start bragging about “destroying people on internet threads” that’s a big clue.
---
Protesting a game by playing it? Are you a child or just a huge moron?
---
Since when get the worker blamed for fucked up management and marketing?
---
Get a job and you'll see it's not like you think it is.
---
DOLEMITE IS MAH NAME!
---
And my mother is from there and I've been there a lot. Your area is creepy and you know it!
---
I never said it was... but It’s half price atoms. 19,800 for $100. Pretty good deal for those who buy atoms. Plus private servers and some exclusive emotes and cosmetics. 
---
The only real issue is the scrap box which was just unnecessary and shouldn’t really be in game IMO. That’s really the only thing I have issue with. I’m not going to quit the game over it though lol. It’s basically like adding easy mode to the game. The game is already super easy.
---
You are right, this is better, but at the same time, junk having weight isn't wrong either. Weight management has been a thing for TES games and Bethesda's Fallouts for so long.
---
The whole subscription should be look upon as cheaper atoms with extra benefits, instead of putting those benefits in front of the atoms since the atoms are the only thing that worth something, and the reason they shouldn't so a sub is because they should have fixed the game first instead of asking for more money, but what I see here is that all of you putting the you focuses at the wrong place.
---
"You're getting destroyed" - what's your comment upvote count on this thread? That's what I was referring to. You're so lost!
---
Couldn’t you go get an id?
---
Right? I see the same people every time I log in.
---
Oh my now you are bragging about upvotes lol. This really means a lot to you eh?
---
Some items is different than the others.
---
Every single piece of scrap metal is scrap metal, nothing differs from any other, so the data stored is just the quantity of it.
---
Weapons and armors is different, they have modification, level, durability, and legendary prefix so it uses a lot more data than normal junk.
---
Poorly written in English or poorly translated into English?  That made my head hurt.
---
You are actually right, that's why they offered the atoms.
---
I agree. Its 100 bucks a year. These fucking mouthbreathers probably paid to see Avengers like 10 times with 10 dollar popcorn every time. But 12 bucks for some stuff in a game???!?!?!?!??!
---
Fucking idiots
---
And judging by your comment history, looks like YOU need to take the break and get a life. All you do is argue with people about mundane things. Jesus - talking about projecting guilt and all that. I'm having a fine morning. About to eat breakfast with my family. This took about 20 minutes of my entire day. I'm sorry this is the scope of your existence.
---
yes it was.  Its a Gamer thing - you wouldnt understand
---
Lol ok- going to say bye again and comment another hundred times? 
---
Do you need the last word? Is that it bud? Ok I’ll give it to you- I feel like your day is already starting way to stressful for you and I feel bad for you this is what you got going. 
---
Last word, all yours kid.
---
You are complaining about something that isn’t an issue anymore. Yes it ha a bug and within 48 hours it was fixed. Move on. 
---
How is it a bait and switch? The clearly tell you what you are buying before you buy it. I think you are using that term incorrectly. 
---
Fallout 1st is not our DLC in the sense that they were referring to expansions. Season passes are referring to purchasing all future expansions in a single transaction and then they clarified that individual expansions will also be free in the same sentence. Clearly you misunderstood. I understood from he beginning that all expansions like wild Appalachia and wastelanders would be free.. which they are.
---
Are you dyslexic? I'm honestly asking. Because you're putting words in my mouth and I'm not sure if it's a tick, or if you're actually not understanding what my point was. You've been downvoted about 30+ times in this thread. I"m telling you to stop while you're ahead
---
I think the reason most of us thought it was free because they said we were going to get private servers and be able to mod them. Modding a beth game has ALWAYS been using an offline savable, persistent world affair, And how in the hell do you mod a game session, how do we create those mods and even test them if we didn't have an offline way to do it, for example a dedicated piece of server software. We have no creation kit, no way to bug test. They could implement the creation shop thing but we still need an offline way to create\test before throwing it online.
---
if we have to go online, create a private world and test. How is that even going to work. The mod could have a severe bug that crashed the instance etc... that's not good for their resources. I think modding is also not going to be what we think it is either. I don't even think we are going to get a fully fledged creation kit like the other games. It's going to be limited to texture mods, like skins and the such. Like how am I suppose to mod in an ak47 with 500 dmg per bullet get it in my modded private world and then go take it online to a public server ?
---
One of the most appealing features of fallout and elderscrolls was the ability to mod the crap out of them. Don't bring up eso it's an mmo not coop like fo76 and cant be modded like beths tradition elderscrolls offline games.
---
To be able to make a mod we need the creation kit or similar and a way to test offline, That can't happen if everything is hosted on their servers. I reckon it will be more akin to unreal tournament with the mutators. You pick how you want to change\mod things up and off you go.
---
Don't forget they said we can mod them eventually, They didn't say we can create the mods though did they...
---
A man can dream. I don't see Bethesda coming out of this without doing every single one of these steps. I want to like Bethesda, but I can't if they keep breaking promises and breaching the community's trust. It wasn't acceptable when they made horse armor either. Yet this time it gets worse, because the gameplay has suffered from it. The grind is awful.
---
I'm just letting you know that I"m blocking you, because you're clearly a troll. Have fun with the rest of the users.
---
Conan at the very least works...
---
I couldn't run Fallout 76 (during the free week) with an Ethernet cable to my modem on my ps4...It simply had extreme "lag" but really frame rate, bugs galore, heads growing, and the ONE time I partied up...The framerate GOT even worse!
---
**I surely hope bethesda learns a lesson from outer worlds**
---
With ebay, it's already p2w.  That's unavoidable in any game with trading.
---
What I hate is the "paying to get around game mechanics" bs.  Managing a Stash is a game play mechanic you can now buy your way out of!  
---
Keeping your gear repaired is an important mechanic that you can now buy your way out of!  
---
Gathering junk is an important game mechanic you can now buy your way out of!
---
And any adjustment to those mechanics is now an accounting decision, not a game design one.
---
Appreciated, mate. Thanks
---
They most likely made enough with the sales of fallout 1st
---
What makes you think anyone cares what you think? You do a lot of complaining without offering any actual solutions, Mr. "As a Programmer myself". I don't really see the point of this post, did you think you were going to score some cool awards for your progressive hot take? LOL
---
My bad yesterday I was tired as fuck after university, I meant to say you delude yourself if you think that video games aren't piece of art
---
imagine not realising most of the time its on exec's and publishers and not the dev teams.
---
"Figured it out"? How gullible can you be. That's like saying a Chef only just figured out that water can boil when heated. They decided to make cash on it, yet, "it" being the ignorance and gullibility of people like you. And you are defending them doing so. Makes sense.
---
I don't think there are any mods for weapons are armor that can't be learned eventually except for just a couple rare ones. Like I don't believe you can learn dense for armor or indigo for bats.  But as somebody who has done about 1800 treasure maps I can tell you that there are a lot of mod plans for everything.
---
The community is absolutely what kept Bethesda afloat all these years. Without mods the games are absolutely average. Especially Oblivion. (sorry everyone).
---
What the hell would crossplay change?
---
 A lack of people on servers isnt the issue now. The events are u organized and glitchy, so nobody teams up for anything anyways. 
---
This is possibly the worst idea
---
To be objective...
---
- Scrap Box is only for materials (not aid, not armour, not weapons, etc)
---
- there’s no practical advantage to have hundreds of pounds of materials stashed away (other than emotional comfort for players who must pick up and keep everything)
---
- most players already solved the “unlimited space” issue by using mules (and that works for all categories).  4 mules = approx 8000 lbs.  It’s somewhat inconvenient as it takes 5-10 minutes. But through mules you also get extra caps from vendors and extra scrip (assuming you mules are leveled)
---
Honestly the 12$ a month is worth it for me, I enjoy that game and the stuff fallout first aids on. 
---
That’s it really.
---
Just ask someone on here who has it and join their private server to test it out.
---
? What you mean?
---
Click X to scrap and square to store it.
---
Fallout 4 is smaller than 76...
---
I think a lot of the vitriol is aimed at people because they see it as them enabling this behavior. There's some validity in that, but I do not agree with personal attacks on those people. Instead we should be showing them WHY their decision will hurt gaming and Bethesda games in the future. They're simply attracted to the shiny object. This is absolutely on Bethesda and nobody else. They're targeting people unethically.
---
Fallout 4 was not a great game. They pissed away too much flexibility and options in order to pander to consoles and "muh custom voice acting".
---
Can you run your businesses from invite only? No you can't so actually alot of people would pay for this in GTAO but don't have to because you can change your MTU settings
---
Bro I suggest you to use a VPN and purchase from another EU country. UK Italy France don't need an ID check to buy mature content.
---
buy Outher Worlds i played it 7-9 hours and it´s so good  feels like old bethesda RPGs
---
Are you kidding me? Pre-war America was filled with anti-Chinese and anti-communist propaganda at every turn.
---
I just bought it for like $24 USD and have been enjoying a ton.
---
I'm just.... waiting for wastelanders to drop while playing OW in the meantime.
---
Well, that's on you, and is why the rest of us can't have nice things. But you are out of topic, really. This post is about Bethesda lying. They lied about a very fundamental thing which can't really be done wrong and later "figured out", that's not how it works. Trying to call out people for bringing this into attention just makes you look bad.
---
Did you have over 1500 lbs in your inventory?
---
Selling in-game currency is straight p2w... that’s how
---
League isnt pay to win. I play the game, dont come with this stupid crap. The guy said name a f2p that doesnt have pay to win and its league . Its cleqr you dont play keague cause everyone knows their is no ingame payment you can maoe that will get you to diamond.
---
That aritcle (that you googled to fit your ignorant bias) is shit old because the system they mention is defunct. You can get skins as a f2p player and so much more. You cannot purchase anything ingame that increases your ranking. In actuality thay article you listed talks about how overpriced things are which doesnt equate to pay2win. Keep moving goalposts cause we both know league is a 10 year old game with a heavy f2p model that is extrememey succesful
---
I'm sorry have you followed the news lately surrounding fallout 76? The worst idea has already come out. 
---
And not to be rude but if you don't get crossplay fine.
---
But don't go hating when you know nothing about why people want crossplay.
---
&gt; You are complaining about something that isn’t an issue anymore. Yes it ha a bug and within 48 hours it was fixed. Move on.
---
So if somebody stabs you and then stitches you up 2 days later you immediately forgive them? What's with this dismissive attitude of yours? 
---
&gt; How is it a bait and switch? The clearly tell you what you are buying before you buy it. I think you are using that term incorrectly.
---
"private" worlds. In literally every other game this means an invite-only server. Oh, sure, they announced that they'll make it invite-only. But that's just another case of the bait and switch like the canvas bag. They throw out the cheap thing that people didn't sign up for, and they only fix it after the backlash. It's almost identical. 
---
&gt; Fallout 1st is not paid DLC in the sense that they were referring to expansions. 
---
It doesn't have to be. They said "no paid DLC" which clearly, undeniably implies no paid DLC at all. Fallout 1st content that you HAVE to pay for. That is, by very definition paid DLC. If they wanted to leave the door open for subscription services like these then they should have specified "no paid DLC expansions". You claim I misunderstood, I think you need to re-evaluate if it wasn't you who misunderstood. 
---
&gt; As long as they stick to their guiding principles around the atomic shop as thy outlined I am fine. Why do you disagree with specifically in their guiding principles?
---
What? You're talking of guiding principles? When I literally linked to the post where they admit to breaking their promise and changing those principles? Seriously? The only "guiding principle" they clearly follow is money. Why do you still trust them despite the broken promises? Do you suffer from stockholm syndrome?
---
1) not having to farm rotationally to keep items repaired 
---
2) huge stash of assets that can be sold for Caps at any time
---
3) not having to bulk and use plastic
---
4) able to make ammo as needed at any point without farming
---
Theres 4 off the top of my head. One day of farming on your own server and voila, a huge stash of junk that can last weeks. Can only do that by paying extra cash. Not earning it in game.  Pay. To. Win.
---
M8 a powerarmor paintjob costs 1800 which is something every other game would offer for free. Its not a good offer, you are paying money for things that have zero value.
---
Dont forget to wear your SHEEPsquatch outfits while you ride that bandwagon
---
Yes, but don't drop stuff on the ground it will leave an empty bag.
---
I outlined all the ways to solve these issues. If you see this as "not offering a solution" then you need to re-read the post and try to understand it this time.
---
We were just becoming good friends, why would I block you? I hope you have a great day, wherever you are!
---
Hows the family? How are your kids? I hope everyone is healthy as can be. Good luck on that promotion too! I hear you're up for a big raise. Good luck, seriously
---
They said in 2018 that private servers would be a paid deal.  People weren't paying attention.
---
That and the stash box and tent, which is a misstep by Bethesda.  People are overreacting, but it *is* a misstep.
---
Game has NPCs... just not human NPCs. If rose was a human still and not a robot it wouldn’t change her personality at all. Such a silly thing to be upset about.
---
Thanks for your contribution. Nothing was cancelled in nuclear winter to focus on wastelanders.
---
If your on PC probably a hacker
---
Also PA is only better than Wood, Scout and Marine are better than PA
---
Oops, forgot to smile at you :)))) Much love and peace my friend!
---
Well actually people like me are the reason people like you will get nice things in the future of fallout 76- we are funding it.
---
I won't give you my items for free, but we can use PayPal? I'll sell you all of my junk, rare clothing, armor for $100? If you have Fallout 1st, I'm sure you can afford another $100
---
Camps that are all locked up blocking access to workbenches and stash boxes. Why would you do that?
---
Happened in marine suite too. If it's hacking, damn boys i am getting istant killed a lot nowdays.
---
It sounds like you just want to be angry so I’m going to let you be. You aren’t interested in an actual conversation. I don’t know if this is fake outrage and just trolling or if you actually are upset. I asked what you don’t like in he guiding principles and all you did was deflect. 
---
Have a good day.
---
100% agree. Bethesda has become such a greedy, corner cutting company. The die hards (as with any game) are keeping it alive and allowing Bethesda to get away with this garbage. They won't admit this game is trash. I was that for awhile, mostly trying to defend and justify my collectors edition purchase. 
---
The awful thing is...I'll still buy Fallout 5. In the meantime, loading up Outer Worlds as I type this.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Whoa there, calm down. The point I was trying to make is other online games offer free private and invite only play and still manage to support further development of their games with their existing microtransactions. If you have a problem with the limits they put on the games, don't bitch at me for it.
---
No. 300/400
---
Hey be nice to my friend.
---
Corporations and businesses like money. It’s how they exist.
---
Yeahhhh, but I mean you are saying something is a good deal that's monetary value is decided by is owner.
---
If I were to offer you some Awesome-bucks, that I value as each 1 being worth $4. Who's to say what it's truly worth.
---
The atom amount in question is only considered a good deal because Bethesda overpriced their worth. But in reality the amount per a month isn't even enough to buy most power armor skins.
---
Thank you for your service!
---
Games trash. Deleted.
---
Definitely agree
---
"But it's not pay to win if you get all the perks and spend one hundred hours just farming the Queen!"
---
And my personal favourite:
---
"It helps support the game so they can keep adding content to the Atom Shop so you can buy it to support the game so they can keep adding content to the Atom Shop!" 
---
It gets harder to enjoy new content like Meat Week when the reward have such low drops, are not really useful and most of the event content is actually in the Atom Shop.
---
Yes this is the same level of stupid like burning you already paid nike shoes.... it dosnt gonna do nothing... if you want to boycot, then uninstall or get off the fucking bandwagon !
---
get me a list of what you have.
---
Yep, it's that they put a feature we've all been waiting for behind a paywall.
---
Exactly. Go get an id dude. This guy is right \^
---
People buy atoms currently. That’s a fact. I don’t personally, but others due. This is essentially a 50% off sale for them plus exclusive emotes, outfits and other stuff.
---
19,800 atoms in a year is a lot no matter how you slice it.
---
Skyrim was a massive disappointment after playing the shit out of oblivion (my first "immersive" style gaming experience). It was a lazy port where the previous games had been optimised for PC, so sometimes you'd have different keys to perform essentially the same actions among other obvious porting issues. When I played it on Xbox all the issues suddenly made sense, which is disappointing considering PCs have more versatile controls so you'd think it'd be the other way around.
---
When F4 came out with an identical interface to Skyrim I was so turned off because it seemed lazy and the interface really didn't match the feel of either game - it just seemed to be generic enough to work with anything. It also fell victim to the trend (just starting at the time) of the huge "massive world for you to explore! Innumerable side quests! Your decisions MATTER! You can use everything to craft anything!". Only... your decisions didn't really matter because the game was so massive no one really knew or cared about them, you'd get tied up with hours of boring side quests and spend a stupid amount of time looking for, and having to lug around so much random crap because it *might* be useful later... that you would end up putting off and forgetting the thread of the main story. 
---
I think F3 and Oblivion hit the sweet spot in terms of giving you the feeling of being a part of a big world with some entertaining and/or relevant side quests and a moderate level of customisation. The later games started trying to be too many things to too many players. The level of customisation (your town/home base, weapons, armour) was way too overwhelming and while it wasn't strictly necessary, I always felt penalised for not devoting as much time to those things so that I could actually finish.. at some point in the future! The vast open world element is great but from a completionist POV it was a nightmare. You can make any map gigantic by adding more random space with nothing in it other than a massive forest with the same old cookie cutter animals/enemies/caves etc. Also, the main quest should be compelling enough that you want to finish it and see where it goes, not a chore that distracts you from your billion side quests - they should be somewhat related because otherwise what are you doing there when your task is to save someone/anyone/the world?!
---
Tbh a lot of those things are the parts of modern open world RPGs that people love and I respect that. I just wish they did it well and that the space/quests/crafting elements were more coherent and relevant to the story (which should be able to hold its own) and not just shoehorned in to be on trend. It looks like 76 is just the endpoint madness of this whole thing - absolutely gigantic map, MMO, sparsely populated with v little to do, average storyline, and crazy levels of customisation via a time and resource heavy crafting mechanic
---
TL;DR I don't wanna play this because it seems to be the (il)logical endpoint to the model RPGs have been heading towarss for years, which makes the games a never ending quest for bits of cardboard and bleach to improve your hammer in a map roughly the size of the former Soviet union. The addition of microtransactions, subscription model and shithouse quality of the game is hugely disappointing given the amazing forerunners in the series. It's just sad
---
A couple of patches ago (#12, I think, could be wrong) they fixed the standard .50 receiver to do more damage than the .308 Hardened. All the other .50 receivers are still worse than the .308 Hardened, though. So for a one-shot kill Instigating sniper rifle, .50 is the way to go.
---
Oh I understood fine the little bit I did read, and it was enough for me to realize you're full of hot air. Giving a weird list of "me want free" demands without any way to actually implement them, or like I said - any actual solutions, is clearly not offering a solution. It literally adds zero to the conversation and shows you have no clue what youre actually talking about. 
---
Maybe you should re read your own post and try a little harder next time.
---
Power Armor dosen’t seem as great as it should
---
Peeps can make more vault suits anyway.
---
But you know that you are activelly contributing to whats going on right? You buying their shit means that they keep on doing it. There is a limit
---
So, this is just another rage quit shitpost?
---
*Well in that case*
---
“Who cares?”
---
Xbox?
---
I may return to the game in the future
---
I got your back buddy
---
You guys should  be asking for SERVER BINARIES to host your own server on your own hardware.
---
I used to play LoL.  And yes, it was legit Pay to Win for because you could literally replace the grind by paying cash.  That's pay to win in its purest form.  
---
And no, I am not moving goalposts. You cannot compare a MOBA to an RPG
---
The only thing Bethesda has done wrong is they should have made it subscription based from day one and never allowed the freeloaders on 🙄
---
At least you get the option of continuing to play at the expense of those who choose to pay.
---
Let me guess, you're a Zoomer, right?
---
It makes sense to build it now as well.
---
What did you said, i was browsing the atom shop, i got some spending money on hand, while i drink a nice bit of Nuka Dark Whiskey !
---
Would you say millions? Tens of millions? Genuinely curious what your estimations are
---
If you put your scrap in the scrap box you have way more room for aid, armor and weapons in your stash, duh.
---
Well, I hope you do, and I hope the game you return to meets your expectations.
---
Yes Analgesic and I have plenty of things to destroy
---
Consistent monthly payments look way better to investors than random monthly or even yearly sales
---
An ammo converter sounds pretty sweet, though
---
Me too buddy don't get me wrong I want this game to be the best it can be but right now it isn't so I'll take a good break
---
Damn. Do you know what you did that caused it?
---
The problem is letting people go back and forth between the modes. If the two modes were entirely separate and benefits like the stash were only on the private side nobody would have said a thing about it.
---
The fact that the two worlds communicate also means that there won't be any real modding, because can you imagine letting premium users adjust the amount and levels of what spawns across the map? It'd be basically the same thing as unlocking the Console Commands. And looking at mods like Fallout 4's Cheat Terminal, they might as well actually unlock the thing. Premium users would basically be legalised cheaters able to flood Adventure's economy with whatever they want.
---
I've already seen player vendors full with 60-90 3* weapons and armor, plus hundreds of rare crafting materials like flux at absurdly small prices.
---
Yes u/analgesic1986 and I have plenty of things to destroy as best buddies
---
Adding you now
---
Is your health low?
---
Just your scrap dissapearing lol. Be wary of crashes
---
You didnt know the game was broken? do you not have internet at home?
---
No but we didn’t expect them to be bundle with pay to win crap and the public servers they are providing are awful.
---
The particular plan I mentioned was the "Sledgehammer Heavy Searing Sharp Rocket Plan" I believe. Seeing people offer 30k Caps for it. Along with a random assortment of other plans that shouldn't be at that value, unless they're super rare. Hopefully there's a list somewhere about this, along with finding out why they're valuable.
---
yep
---
Have you played The Outer World's yet? Not one single bug in the game, it's a shame Bethesda couldn't learn a thing or two from Obsidian instead of wanting to fill their pockets by doing the least amount of work possible.
---
They are the only company I know of that rely on their fanbase to fix and actually make their games better, Bethesda are a joke.
---
Collectron are basically cosmetic, as they should be.
---
Interesting development, I don't think I ever thought to check the standard .50 receiver for some reason.
---
Guess I ought to swap over to .50 for my hunting rifles, for future reference. That ammo economy really is hard to argue against.
---
The game does use the radiant structure for some of the Dailies. And no, that doesn't make things any more interesting IME, because they're still the boring "go to X, kill Y, fetch Z" quests, just now with random values of X, Y and Z.
---
Content Density Vs. Map Size
---
Who cares? They always were essentially just cosmetic.
---
Ugh... u/analgesic1986 age has nothing to do with his argument. His argument is well articulated. He claims he touched a nerve, and that's hard to do when you're miles apart - so you should be applauding his skill. He's also a licensed therapist who knows advanced breathing techniques - helping you calm down. You should be thanking him for his free advice.
---
True, which I addressed in the post. I have nothing against them having subscriptions, I only want them to separate the private server subscriptions from cosmetic subscriptions.
---
There comes a point though that once you stick your hand over the fence and keep being bitten by the same dog I have to wonder not what is wrong with the dog, but what is wrong with \*you\* that you would keep doing it over and over.
---
Bethesda is absolutely accountable for this crock of shit, but so are you for giving them money for it when you can \*very clearly\* see exactly what it is, and Bethesda has \*very clearly\* made their intentions with this game as a whole obvious. There comes a point where you can't play the victim card any more because you've been bitten a dozen times now and you keep sticking your hand over the fence anyway.
---
There is more diverse content in fallout 76. Fallout 4 is filled with radiant quests. 
---
Yes it has cutscenes to make it look pretty but if you strip those away there is way less to do and see.
---
Yeah. Had this happen before. The only way I could fix was to move my CAMP over 1 inch and start over. 😥
---
That's PS4? I can scrap stairs idk why that happens to you. In my opinion the building system is ok, but obviously it needs some fixes. But not stairs.
---
Now that I think about it, why this happens to you only with stairs? It happens with more props?
---
Does it auto renew on Playstation? I was looking to see how one would cancel it and I couldn’t find out how
---
I'm waiting to see wastelanders for $60 and perk loadouts for those who pre-order.
---
) everything you mentioned is pay for convenience
---
- Repair costs are negligible
---
- There are cap limits - most players reach the 1400 daily limit within 15-30 minutes for multiple characters if farming. 
---
- If Caps are an issue, I would suggest several easy ways to reach daily limits within minutes:
---
a) Craft outfits (don’t forget to equip Super Duper). e.g. Civil War Top Hat or Civil War Coat sells to vendors for 10-20 caps (depending on CHA);
---
b). Marine Helmet: sells for 22-33 Caps;
---
c) Mutation serums: sells for 300-500 caps
---
- bulking is needed only if you sell materials for caps (which is probably least efficient method to make caps). Except for lead and aluminum, bulking does not save space
---
- ammo as needed... you may have a point as a matter of convenience.  Personally, I have a heavy gunner and never had to buy ammo.  The munitions factory is just too slow to make a significant amount.  Picking up stuff en-route and an occasional trip to Lucky Holes Mine sets me up with thousands of rounds (my heavy gunner even sell extra 20k-40k ammo on in my vendor)
---
It depends on the game style and knowledge of game mechanics.  Much of the above I learned from posts here - which are now unfortunately obscured by lashing out.
---
Indeed
---
Oh no, not just stairs, walls, ceiling, foundations, floors, it's a nightmare
---
Oh for the love of mercy. Subscription services have been the standard for maintaining revenue streams for online games going back over a decade now. Bitching and moaning about a subscription as “part of the problem” means you might as well bitch and moan about online games *themselves* as part of the problem.
---
Would you rather they put *ads* in the damn game and have to sit through a thirty second clip for quip or Purple or Best Fiends at every loading screen?
---
8$ a month is a lot if you are saying this is not a lot pay for my subscription , it is a joke saying that this is a good deal when someone like me had 3-4 hardcrashes on a span of 2 hours.
---
Dude, regarding your edit, please read the *actual* information instead of going off the blowhards. It’s *not* $100 a *month*.
---
Oh my god my man i was just about to put my joker mask on... are you ABSOLUTELY sure i can not start a revolution?
---
I put alot of time and money also and I don’t see it as a spit in the face.Its subjective yeah. But if you say you quit the game and continue to troll other peoples posts for days about how they’re still enjoying the game regardless, you’re just being an asshole. If you breakup with your gf/bf are you gonna stalk their social media talking shit ? Just move the fuck on.!
---
Last year the funniest and best thing in gaming scene was the "april fool" guy at Blizzcon regarding Diablo Immortal.
---
This year it's Fallout 76 Worst# - Bethesda's fallen glory...
---
Ive posted about this before, i have it happen on xbox. They one shot the whole team
---
It's a very good game but kinda short...
---
Finished it in 15 hrs. And I didn't just do main quest, I 100% the first planet and did a lot of sidequests.
---
Game ended at lvl 21 on supernova.

People who are buying it are supporting the decisions that Betheda are making. While not the direct cause of the problem, the buyers are enabling it. It's understandable that people are outraged at the sight of you wearing the armour, because it's a symbol of the issue.
---
That being said; screw those people who are taking it out on anyone personally. That shit ain't fair. Those who are toxic are also supporting the game, and are just as much to blame for it's endorsement.
---

---
So before fallout 1st, how did people win?
---
HOLY XD! BUT WHY?! This doesn't happens to me.
---
But before we start the protest, two words. Twitter. Hashtag. If they don’t notice and listen from the game we can get trending, we just need twitch streamers to join in.
---
....by playing the game?  Putting in the time and skill to make your character stand out...
---
It isn't an offline version, you can have 7 of your friends with you. Makes fighting the SBQ much more enjoyable.
---
Personally attacking you for buying something you enjoy is toxic as fuck and good for you for reporting them. But you definitly should be blamed and possibly mocked if you actually buy that subscription.
---
How do you react when you hear about people donating to kylie jenner to make her the youngest billionaire ? The fuck is wrong with these people right ? Buying fallout 1st is one level under that.
---
I feel the same as you do, but I make an exception for 6 if it looks like some sort of wastelander themed junkyard.

Exactly, having unlimited stash is just convenient. People will still win like they always have by, as you put it, playing the game.
---
EU magic i can travel without a passport using only my ID
---
Oh sorry, I didn’t understand.
---
That bit actually irks be somewhat. Why do the players need a mediator? From what I've seen, the community has been quite unanimous in most things. And sitting down with *those* guys, who've shown time and time again just how much they care about and respect us? Even if they were honest and reliable, it would be unnecessary - and they're neither of those. We don't need a mediator; it's Bethesda that needs a complete changing of the guards.
---
Every Bethesda game with the exception of ESO has been offline. Can you mod in ESO? Real question, don't know, don't play it.
---
His website get more positive feedback than Fallout 76 First.
---
I can't understand why...
---
This is great thankyou!
---
Gonna give that a try tnx!
---
Everytime I can't remove something, not even rotate! That 
---
"~Reserved ~" description shows up, and when that happens, you know you're fucked
---
How much room do you need?
---
All my junk ways around 100 lbs.
---
As many players - I have 3 mules for convenience: weapons, armour, aid/junk.  Weapons and armour mules are handy for future builds and experiments.  I haven’t touched the aid/junk mule in months (though it does provide emotional comfort that I have 1800 lbs of uselessness stuff stored)
---
From reading this forum I learned from experienced players to have “running weight” of 130-160 lbs depending on build.  Also, how to have your stash around 400 lbs and not be needing.
---
I don’t see weight as an advantage.  
---
Convenience- yes.
---
I mean you guys were still playing it up to this point sooooooooo. Fallouts been bad since new vegas, 4 shouldd have been called wasteland scfi adventure. Why did you think 76s halfassed design was gonna go anywhere else. Bethesda says thanks for the cash anyways though.
---
Well, Fallout 76 hasn't changed sooo much over the last months.
---
Hey Bethesda, just a heads up.... Here in Australia, the price for the subscription service is nearly $200. 200 fucken dollars to play a broken game. FUCK NO, I wont pay to play your shit. I can spend that 300 bucks on 3 full, polished games, which is what intend to do. And I say 300 because I still have not bought the game. After the monumental fuck up on launch day, I vowed not to buy it, however the wastelanders update piqued my interest, until you set up this paid service. Not only will I NEVER buy Fallout 76, but I will now treat Bethesda on the same level as I do EA, and that is to simply never spend a single cent towards your products. So to Pete, Todd and everyone at Bethesda, farewell, go fuck yourselves, oh, and have fun dealing with..... the fallout.
---
I’d take radiant quests over one time quests that are completely forgettable
---
Yea I like it too.....
---
And Playstation players must pay PS Plus to even play the game.
---
There is something mildly hilarious about using a *car* as an analogy when complaining about a subscription service. The only way you aren’t effectively paying every *week* for a car you own is if you aren’t driving it (gas). You also have to regularly pay for maintenance (even if you do the maintenance yourself, you have to buy the parts and materials to do so) if you want to be able to *keep* using it. Aaaaand there’s the insurance that you’re required *by law* (in the USA) to carry on it. Then there’s the license renewal fee every year *and* your personal license to be legally able to operate *any* car ever four years.
---
Honestly, regardless of anyone’s stance on the subject, a car is quite possibly the worst analogy to pick.
---
Doesn't matter what Pete would say it would be a lie anyway its his job to lie in peoples face about the horrible state the game is atm, all he and Bethesda PR department will say is that they are looking at the data and some other BS like players wanting more microtransaction in games because data says so lol.
---
Xbox pass is $180 per year (less if you wait for a promotion) for hundreds of games including some AAA titles on release. I don't think pointing at the sticker price of what is arguably the best value in gaming right now answers any of the criticism of the people who are against Fallout 1st.
---
Yes, let's  boycott the game by playing the game even more
---
Providence Equity.
---
Exactly! I’m unsure on Xbox players but all players technically have to pay a internet bill if they play from home so really that’s a stack of cash to get a full gameplay of it.
---
From what iv'e read up on it's visual mods, Like wow addons, Add stats to your view or change the way the ui looks etc... nothing that would add in extra usable content. No texture mods, no new models. It's a fully online mmorpg though so that's the kind of modding I would expect for that type of game.
---
I would imagine that's what they are thinking with 76 too. So my hope of adding mods that i create to add extra armour for example probably isn't going to happen. I'm probably also not going to be able increase the size of my buildable plot for example. Or create new places to settle or takeover, No new quests, no adding npcs or things to make the world more diverse etc...
---
It is an advantage because you don't have to sell potentially useful, but heavy, weapons and armor.
---
The official Facebook page still post news, updates and announcements.
---
But nothing regarding the Fallout First shitstorm.
---
There’s another settlement that needs our help!
---
Ugghh. Convience or lower difficulty?
---
Hopefully Starfield doesn't tank like Anthem.... Still salty about Andromeda.
---
It's why I stopped going the the Bethesda Forums a while ago. Useless and too toxic.   
---
The reddit can get caught up in angry arguments and we have a few too many people on here who overaggressively defend something based less on fact and more on "but I like it so it can't have flaws". But all in all it's a far more productive and pleasant forum.   
---
That's why I come back to it.
---
See Hanlons Razor
---
The Outer Worlds does seem very good though I've just started playing it. And Bethesda's behaviour is the reason I bought it now rather than waiting &amp; seeing for a few months.
---
The guys that don't treat events as multiplayer events (like the ones you're describing) are helping to push people away from public servers.  Why would I want to show up for an event with guaranteed Legendaries only for some guy to burn the room before everyone gets a hit in... when I could instead pop a private server with the friends I play with and share the goodies? 
---
Congrats, 1-Shot Guy.  You're the real MVP...
---
Well I'm sorry but I don't know how to fix it. I hope from the bottom of my heart that you'll get this fixed soon.
---
Have a wonderful day.
---
Right lol insanity
---
You can tell it got some inspiration from Firefly as far as the "feel" they were going for. At least with certain parts of the game that you'll know when you see.
---
Yea that all makes sense. What bothered me is I planned for the not-responding thing (from experience nuking Whitespring on a server that was dying and I ended up being the only person), but I thought they should have at least spawned for me the first time. Oh well. I don’t feel too bothered because it wasn’t really immersion breaking but it was definitely a little land.
---
and those of you here on the sub that bought the premium service, you're anti-hero who continues to tell bethesda wringing people out for money is perfectly acceptable. I legit don't even feel bad for you the service is broken, because you should have known that from the start - considering that's how it has worked every time with this game
---
Funny, to me this has always felt like dripping with snark and sarcasm. "You dared not play like we envisioned you'd be slaughtering each other, so we're gonna punish you with more intense PvP modes and just destroy whatever you do that we don't like." And if that means destroying the entire playerbase with a subscription model - so be it, apparently.
---
Ok, butt that was only one of two examples I used. There is a healthy community playing Elite Dangerous and all microtransactions are for currency used in game strictly for cosmetic items. That is the other of my 2 examples. They are supported by the occasional paid dlc for major dlc that makes huge, sweeping  changes for a lot less than $99 a year. As I mentioned in another reply, it will likely be a 3 year gap for paid dlc and yet, strictly supported by cosmetic purchases. Stuff like paint jobs for your ship, body panels, bobbleheads for your dash, placards for the outside. And this is Elite, there are many other games supporting solo and private play modes AND future development on microtransactions. Some with huge player bases, some with smaller. The fact is, this is $99 a year people will have to pay this year, next year, and the year after that, assuming it lasts that long. If all these features would have been in a $30 paid dlc, they may not have caught as much help, oh, other than lying and saying there would be new stuff added all the time and all future dlc would be free.
---
Yeah better than spending 4 hours a day grinding out more ammo
---
Looking at their previous statements which turned out to be lies maybe the 'support development' has been too looking at how little they reinvested into the game development.
---
My guess is they would've been able to keep developing on the Atomshop alone for the next years but looking at how everyone hyped Wastelanders up (because everybody was hyped for it to be the 'relaunch' how 76 should've been) realized they couldn't release it as expected and are now trying to profit as much as they can regardless the losses in reputation before launching another minimal 'content' patch and then announcing the failure of the 76 project and the shutdown of the servers at the beginning of April next year
---
Yeah everyone watched the same videos, most of this and all of fp76's state is their fault
---
In all fairness, the PR nightmare is Fallout 76. This is just throwing some more fuel on the fire.
---
They weren't at the time.
---
I might be able to answer your question if you know which weapon killed you.
---
Those things all make sense, but that isn't what people seem to be upset about. 
---
I don't get it. Why would anyone think this would be free? Value given is a different argument entirely, but free forever? That's just unrealistic.
---
Wait wait wait. ESO is *not* free to play. You *still* have to buy the base game if you want to play. You also have to directly purchase any DLC modules you want to play if you don’t subscribe. You *also* have to buy the expansion packs if you want to play those and they’re *not* included in the subscription, though you typically can buy a bundle with all of them included.
---
ESO uses the *same* model as FO76 where you buy the base and then don’t have additional fees for the base game experience. Path of Exile is F2P, you can download the game without paying and start playing. Neither ESO or FO76 allow that.
---
Yeah, I stopped playing it a while back because this stuff like this. I used to play solos and win pretty frequently, but after the map changed it's like I get melted by everyone.
---
Who's a billionaire in all this?
---
you left out 250DR
---
That’s all I saw too, it read like “I’m entitled and I want them to just give me everything for free”.
---
Here’s an idea instead of trying harder with his post next time, don’t even make it.
---
Not on all games though. One example I used is Elite Dangerous. It's strictly for cosmetic items. And they support the solo and invite only sessions and future development just fine with lots of free dlc, and currently the occasional paid dlc (currently looking at a 3 year gap in paid dlc).
---
i could use the chest and left side of the van wwr. i got the apparel. junk i’d probably pass on since i’m about a week i’ll have junk out my ass.
---
Also, are you using iron clad and life giver?
---
With proper management (there are dozens of articles on that in this forum) All Junk items will make up approx. 100 lbs of you stash.
---
I agree that having an unlimited stash is convenient - but not a major advantage.  For weapons/armour you can (and probably should) make a mule character and stash 2000 lbs there... Or, if you think that the convenience is worth it, buy the premium.
---
Most active players have already resolved the weight issue.
---
Umm u never get dots for that quest. As you need to get parts and create the uplink under quests at a tinkers bench.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted but you are correct. Like I don't believe you can put Harden mass in it and if you do with scraps it to ultracite. That is a distinction.
---
I've seen some questionable stuff on PS4, but not enough to scream "hacker!"  If you're on PC though, that would be my first guess. 
---
A more plausible explanation is a guy running a hunting rifle/ lever with rifleman, bloody mess, tank killer, etc and taking a head shot (which does double).  
---
If the damage cap from adventure applies in NW (honestly I don't know as I have never been able to get a per shot damage that high in NW as I prefer DPS) then this explanation is bunkum.
---
I mean if they wanted to be worshipped. They should've just added the Scrapbox to the game for everyone. Make the Rangersuit free in the Atomshop, as a celebration of 23/10 and offer the private servers (with a lock and invite feature) for like 5 money a month (if they stay this small.) And have the new icons and emotes just be a thing to buy in the atomshop.
---
You’re doing something wrong if you need to grind like that for ammo
---
Tango Oscar Fifty Five Echo Romeo
---
no beds.. no instruments
---
I too came here looking for this.
---
That's reductive. This game was launched as a live service, meaning it would have updates and improvements. And yes i gave them the benefit of doubt. I've played 450 hours of Fallout 76 and I've criticized the game for its flaws and gave credit for the things they did right. Right now i'm complaining about the lack of content and the scam the Fallout First is. We should voice our discontent (and fortunately people are doing that), not just swallow wtv bullshit BGS sends our way.
---
I'll login and write down everything and make a post later. I want to sell it before I uninstall. I also have over a 1000 scrip of weapons
---
And another example you used was GTA where you can buy cars, houses, weapons, etc with that currency you spent real $ on
---
Correct
---
If they're building Prime, it better not have any parts made by communists. 
---
And I'll eagerly await the Chinese copy so they can fight.
---
Don't know but the joker mask couldn't hurt.
---
If you bought it you deserved to be flamed, the only reason Bethesda and other companies engage in these egregious practices is because people pay for them, so the blame goes 50/50
---
You just have to bulk it when you take it out, if you want to sell it. Alternatively you can start a private server, get all the workshops, and just farm the items that vendors will buy unbulked and easily get your vendor caps squared away for a month after 1 day of farming workshops and looting everything that isn't bolted down.
---
I don't think so its a pretty boring game
---
You used the private servers, didn't you? That seems to be the connection, cause I still got mah shit :3
---
He's talking about Doomsday Clock
---
And in the original he is for sure a villain. He knew what was coming and let it all happen. He even knew that Rorscact had already sent his journal to the reporters- making the whole scheme to kill half of New York would end up being completly pointless. And he did nothing to stop it. 
---
None of the "heroes" did when they easily could have. Rorscact was the only true hero of the whole series. That's the whole point of the ending.
---
ok lemme know. i worked all night. headed home now so may be asleep. it’s 926 am for me.
---
Use credit card and no problems with age verification ever again ;) Had same problem with ps store in general.
---
Thanks for mentioning that!
---
No one i have talked to telling me how video games are art is equally knowedgable in literally anything else as they do in video games to actually have some judgement. And for you, being an artist as you said you should know better, no one in their right mind would call New Vegas or any video game a "legendary" work of art.
---
Trees0fEternity is my gamertag
---
So you have a valid ID.
---
Then switch via VPN to a location where the ID was issued and try the purchase again.
---
I'm with you on this. This game is still in a gawd awful condition. It's a hell of a lot better, but it's still a mess.   
---
Now it could be MUCH better without changing the core of the game (not complaining about core concept here).   
---
But the issues are all on the devs and the bigger studio. 
---
They're big fixing policies are garbage and result in old bugs being put back in by accident. They've been favoring pay content (I mean it makes sense) over new content that could give players more to do or draw in new ones.   
---
Don't like jumping on developers as it's a hell of a job that's desperately in need of unionization. but when the screwups are things they caused via inept processes, or bad management, then that is where the blame has to be placed.
---
It might have been really obvious, and it was generating a bunch of bad press.
---
It also wasn't a complete fix - if you did lose stuff, that's still gone, pending some future "looking into ways of restoring it" which will probably never happen.
---
XBOXONES by any chance?😇
---
I love the game aswell. But love ESO more atm. As im on eso more atm for the Witches event. Zos does there events well. They go on around the clock with zero cooldowns.
---
Yeah, which is why I said "Not all games though...". Trust me, I have a couple hundred ranks in GTA Online and have been ganked by lots of kids that have access to their parents credit card.
---
The fact is, not all games offering solo and invite only sessions that are supported by microtransactions are p2w.
---
i think they should give all active day 1 players the subscribtuon for free. or at least the stash box. i started playing on the crew weekend
---
Maybe...
---
It won't happen to everyone, only people with friends....
---
\*cries all alone\* 
---
The bug affects only those who use the private servers and/or go from a private to another private/adventure
---
Spacers choice in wording, you’ve tried the best, now try the rest!
---
Frekin now idea what those "games"  **Shark Cards, ARX**  are .....
---
Do yourself a favor go on the r/bethesda if you wanna complain about it, there are enough circlejerk post on her enough, uninstall and leave and if you stop supporting. 
---
r/fo76 is for fallout76 ...
---
Yesterday I was placing short and tall metal beams under my CAMP and I apparently wedged a short beam so deep into the ground that it's totally unselectable now.
---
The worse I’ve had was a few staggers and one frame rate drop, that’s it
---
I watched a livestream on that game it looks amazing can't wait to get it
---
This reminds of this over level 200 dude . The killfeed was showing him kill one after another. All I saw for a few minutes was his name killing people. When this guy confront my team and I, he kills us like nothing. Kills us using an assault rifle with ease. He was playing solo. It seemed like my 50 cal shots didn’t affect him. I for sure thought the two over level 100 guys on my team would of got him but no. So I stay and watch to see if he gets killed by someone else. Nope, dude ends up taking out everyone. I think he killed half the lobby, maybe more.
---
Zenimax was created as a holding company by the founders of Bethesda in 1999. Bethesda is Zenimax and Zenimax is Bethesda, at least from a corporate standpoint. 
---
Certainly, the devs and people who work on the game aren’t sitting around dreaming of ways to shake down their customers, but this whole “Bethesda is being forced to do this” line is silly.
---
Yup
---
Maybe zenimax will run it into the ground then sell the IP on to a dev that actually gives a fuck?
---
Ohh didn't think of it that way
---
I played a little bit last night, I’m really enjoying it so far, character interaction feels like fallout 3 and NV in that it zooms to them and they begin talking. NPC’s also converse with your companion too, it’s pretty dynamic in that regard.
---
It's funny two days is a long time.
---
because it isn't permanent, because we really have no control over it, and because it should have been $$ for just the server ONLY. this isn't some massive online game, it's a coop. If it was just a private instance that stayed online even when i wasn't there i could then justify the price tag at least my friends could go back to the same instance we started originally. I don't however want to pay for an instance that isn't even persistent or gone after i leave, There is almost no benefit to paying other than playing just on your own which atm doesn't even work because friends can just pop in whenever, I can't change a single thing in it because it's just a copy of the main world instance. So all i'm really paying for if i chose to is for the extra items and atoms not really the instance itself.
---
Either :
---
1. Make the instance free and put the extras in the sub 
---
or 
---
2. Make the instance the sub and put the extras in the shop for all to buy if they want to use in ANY game mode they want.
---
Yeeeeeeeah, in FFXIV they also said they can't increase the inventory size.... and then magic (read: money) happened, and suddenly everyone could increase their banks by paying an additional monthly fee on top of the game's monthly sub. They could even increase the number of those additional slots, time and time again, to the point where now you can pay yet another monthy sub for the companion app to unlock one more bank slot to pay another monthly fee for. Oddly enough, somewhere down the road they seem to have found some additional bits of code because they even managed to increase several ingame storage options as well, so... yeah. Basically "stability and etc" = "we're planning to profit from this, so you ain't getting it for free until our cash grab becomes too obnoxious".
---
Yesss that's what I love about it I got so much more hyped
---
It ain’t them, it’s the shareholders or whoever is supplying the money
---
 Dont understand how you can feel any form of accomplishment when paying your way through a game
---
It’s in appliances!!
---
Haha well I hope you’re able to get your own copy soon friend.
---
Most People forgot Redguard and Battlespire, after that came Morrowind one of the best RPGs ever made. Sometimes Studios make mistakes. They need to learn from them. Look at ESO, had A rly bad launch. But now is the best MMO in the fantasy genre.
---
They rly did some shitty things with F76. And they need to wake up. But the wastelander update will come soon. Also Starfield on e3 2020.
---
So you're saying... The game was rigged from the start?
---
Obsidian had way less time to make NW than Bethesda had to make F3 and while they didn't have to develop new engine they never worked with it before they had to learn it first. Also keep in mind that writers don't do game design, modeling or programing and vice versa so not having to develop their own engine didn't really affect writer's ability to make a good story.
---
Did you knock? 🤣
---
Better not...or Bethesda might 'loose' our character data and we'll reappear als Lvl1 from the vault again that we just protested in front of
---
Fanboy your opinion matters just the same as people posting that they’re quitting, accept it or leave the sub
---
Tbh yes I did. This is how I envisioned private servers:
---
1. They'd be hosted locally
---
2. The characters would be separate from other modes.
---
3. They'd be Adventure mode only.
---
4. You can freely apply mods to private servers and modify the server as if it was a singleplayer Fallout title. This includes console commands and such.
---
This works just fine for ARK and Conan Exiles forexample.
---
I expect it's due to the lighter load, with only 8 players allowed on a server
---
Back for round 2, I'm 5 hours in and it's got me hooked. There's little stashed crates all over that you can find if you're creative enough. The perks and abilities are well explained and easy to figure out. Character menu has built in manual with codex. Dialogue options are spot on, some funny, some serious. Combat mechanics are spot on.
---
There could be some QoL things added but overall, I think this is the one game that lived up to the hype. HOWEVER, the game subreddit is a circlejerk right now and anything slightly negative is being downvoted to oblivion, so once this honeymoon stage is over, I'm interested to see what kind of bugs and problems people have with the game
---
You have to pay to get in
---
The fans care more.
---
A fans version is always going to be better, they are the ones playing and loving the franchise and so will want the best interpretation of the iconic costume.
---
The developer is only concerned with shipping out a facsimile in as quick as time as possible with little time spent in creating it and man power  to maximise profit for the company.
---
Profit and more profit is all they care about, they don't care for the customer or it's loyal fanbase, money is all that drives them
---
He's a Mark away from an unfortunate name
---
I deleted my install yesterday. Even tho I still had plenty of space.
---
&gt;Except to do so we have drained the resources from those weaker than us to sustain our growth. We have advanced as a culture at the price of eating up the growth of others.
---
Not remotely true. 
---
&gt;Its funny how after most of our wars we have a sudden economic boom.
---
Yeah like after Vietnam, oh wait in the late 70s we had a recession. But there was definitely a big economic boom after Iraq, oh wait there was a recession bigger then the one in the 70s.
---
Honestly I'm not even going to waste my time reading the rest of your communist lies.
---
"bUt U caN't ExPeCT tHem TO KeEp SuPPortinG The GaME FoR FREe!"
---
This is one I have seen a few times on the Bethesda forums.
---
And in response, yesy, I can and I did. And you know why I expected that?
---
**Because that's what they said they were going to do.**
---
Yeah. I deleted it yesterday, even tho I still have plenty ofHDD space.
---
People with a minimum of understanding in how server works know that stackable items has almost zero impact on server performance they could even make it nearly infinite for everyone and it still wouldn't have a noticeable server performance impact, because the server is not pulling and rendering every item that exists in the inventory its just a extremely small stored number in a high capacity server, i dont understand how some ppl could have been so naive to believe that lie.
---
I dislike camps that are floating monstrosities as well, one area in particular has the most of these funky designs...the whitespring station. 
---
Also traders that will literally build their machines about 10 feet east of the stash box at the whitespring station. I've seen a handful in this area that were done properly, and I like the idea of vault dwellers setting up a town of sorts in the commerce hubs of Appalachia.
---
 Another thing I dislike is camps that have no real structure at all. I like to see at least some architectural creativity when I visit a camp. Mine is a great example, and I don't mean to toot my own horn too much but I've only seen a handful that can hold a candle to mine.
---
Have you played any of the fallout games? Have you seen liberty prime. A literal giant robot that goes around murdering any and all communist whilst reciting anti communist propaganda.
---
I feel timespam is accurate.
---
Well that would solve a serious problem for me, haha. Thanks for the response!
---
I remember online games when they first started and they were free because the focus was on a quality game and not this quick money subscription and micro transaction shit we have now.
---
The fact you are so adamant to defend this makes you part of an overall problem and soon it will cost money in this game just to log in to the fucking server.
---
I do believe that you lose everything but keep atoms and scrap in the container but you can’t put anything into the container.
---
I guess I just don't see it. I mean the price complaint that is. Yes, they are putting some great ideas behind the pay wall but you can do a monthly thing here. I mean is 13$ that much to some of you? Do some of you have jobs where this kind of money is scarce? If so then you should be more life focused then worrying about Bethesdas next moves.
---
You can keep the costume &amp; I believe you can keep the scrap box, but you can't add anymore to it
---
And ones
---
Yup this is true. It’s worth a month to dump a shit ton into it and then ride that out for a while.
---
The key difference is that those teams planned out their DLC and micro-transaction systems before launch. But this is all a continuing story called "Bethesda sucks at online games. Please stick to single player for the love of god."  
---
The first thing Bethesda did was make the stupid promise to never charge for content. That's dumb. How to you keep bringing in money to pay for the upkeep and server management then? All the profits from the game itself go into the next project, so that cash is NOT on the table. IMO, they made that promise because they were worried that 76 was going to be a bust so they tried to sweeten the pot.  
---
The second thing is that nothing in the Atom Store made the game better. There were no special quests you could buy, no unique items, nada. Just cosmetics. I mean pay-to-win sucks, but that's how microtransactions in an online game work. They add stuff you can't normally get. Now this doesn't have to be in-game currency or "time savers" like Ubisoft did, but still needs to be stuff you WANT to get and use.   
---
The 3rd thing is that whomever came up with their pricing model for the Atom Store is a god damned moron. They're pricing items like this was "top of it's game" WoW. Why does a BLUE Power Armor skin cost $18? Why? It doesn't even give you PA. At $18 I'd expect a custom suit of PA that looks sweet, and that I can wear at ANY LEVEL. Because what you're selling there is basically like when WoW sold elite mounts. And even then $18 was too much. Hell, $10 would have been too much.
---
Punji boards. Everywhere
---
Is anyone else experiencing scrap disappearing from they're stash? Not scrap box but og stash.
---
I saw a new Fallout game, thought about the fun I was still having with Fallout 4 (and still am,) and bought the game. At the time, I wasn't anticipating a game that was almost entirely focused on multi-player. I wanted a new map, updated game engine, single player quests, and hopefully the continued ability to mod my game. The single player quest line in 76 is garbage.
---
I would have been happier with a bugfixed update to the Fallout 4 engine with a new map and quests.

Omg seriously... please no

u/ladydevann u/valseek
---
Jeeze and people paid for Fallout 1st and the game isn’t even stable, a year later.
---
It is a Fallout 1st exclusive lol, sometimes legendaries don't spawn on these servers
---
People actually bought the premium service, and then got mad at Bethesda when it was broken
---
I legit don't even think they had a right to be mad it was broken. The game was broken at release, and every new patch released was broken. If you can't learn from all those mistakes, you basically deserve to get your money stolen from you by Bethesda
---
I'm sure I'll be downvoted for being an asshole, but that's fine. The truth hurts sometimes, and if telling the truth makes me an asshole than so be it
---
Don't be condescending. I was only starting a conversation. So YOU do yourself a favor and move along if you don't like my thread.
---
Outer Worlds!
---
Ok... still you suggested FO76 be more like GTA online lol
---
To be fair, ESO does the same thing and they are doing well.
---
I even said this would happen from the start. They'd eventually do an ESO type sub and offer more space, customization and maybe even more build space (we got a second camp).
---
Called it.
---
I will NOT be playing anymore. Might check out wastelanders but will not spend anymore money as this is NOT what they advertised the game to be. Was supposed to stay free. Now we have pay to win mechanics that can't be argued.
---
Dont forget the lieral Godmode glitch jn pvp thats been there for atleast half a year
---
4hours is a a over statement but the game definitely has one hell of a ammo loop
---
If you really love Fallout, show that you mean it by paying the developers. You guys are all talk and no action. How the fuck are devs supposed to come up with a good product when they ain't getting paid enough?
---
Thanks, I took this advice yesterday but forgot to reply. It’s slowly turning out nice
---
So you won't be purchasing ES6 or Starfield?
---
Pete Hines has a two digits IQ
---
No, I never suggested anything like that. So LOL yourself. I only said other games support themselves, development and private sessions on microtransactions and 76 already has microtransactions.
---
I think it's more "you can't expect them to support private instances in an MMO game for free"
---
Because I can guarantee you the next single player fallout game will break sales records, that's why
---
Destiny 1 or 2.
---
The division 2.
---
Those are both looty shooty games like f76
---
Death threats are a bit much. Hoping they get fired on the other hand is fair game.
---
I take that advise, thank you very much, have fun playing others games buddy !
---
Pure speculation but what do you guys think of the title of the subscription: Fallout 1st, That implies there may be a second or non subs may get it later. Why was it not call fallout premium or just fallout subscribers club or something... What exactly does 1st even mean...
---
Rockstar clearly sells more things (cars weapons)... the atom shop is limited. It’s that simple. They needed to sell more to support.
---
You still need to find the broken uplink. Which is under Rose's quest. Only after that can you make/repair the uplink.
---
Rose is at the top of the world location, as you arrive to the end of her quest line, you receive a mission to get the codes from the 4 raider groups and then to enter the location beside top of the world and use the card at the very bottom.
---
I did notice when I replayed the story, that the markers had a slight delay, say 5-10mins after the quest started. Might be worth waiting a bit before progressing with the next quest. Or you can always opt for levelling up whilst you wait for the issue to fix itself.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecgdwhc8gkw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecgdwhc8gkw)
---
With player vending it’s super easy to stock up on thousands of rounds. Not to mention you can always switch weapons and accumulate whatever ammo you need naturally. That’s what I do
---
Sometimes the game fails to spawn a Legendary as a proper Legendary.  If you let it live for a bit, it will often resolve itself and gain its stars, but the non-Legendary SBQ will often die before this happens.
---
A sign that this may happen is when the SBQ takes a long time to show up in the first place.  Like you point out, it was the third nuke, so the server was probably decayed to the point where this was a possibility.
---
I get more annoyed due the fact we still have no way to plant food on planteers and that some structures (like small water purifier and craft workbenches) doesn't snap to other structures.
---
Some people like stuff very aligned, you know...
---
Dude this happens all the time. That is not evidence that the server is already in use. Your character ALSO has some persistence... you can't just jump server to server and pick the same containers and stuff so you, as a character experience the server based to some extent on your character.
---
Its a dedicated server. Even if other people can log into it. Still a dedicated server. Do you even understand what a dedicated server is? It has nothing to do with ownership, usage, or lifetime.
---
I got the message “cannot place, selected item would be floating” as I was trying to place a roof on a wall. It wasn’t floating. I know it wasn’t floating. Even if it was... I don’t see why I can’t just have it float. I had another error when I was trying to get rid of a staircase I used as scaffolding. I put down 2 staircases pretty much next to eachother so I could remove one and work around it while still keeping support. Instead of that working, the game decided that actually I need both stairs and can’t remove either
---
I quit playing after update #5. My fiance hasn't played since the first patch that locked the fps making her game look like shit. I keep on the sub to be entertained by the shit storm Bethesda has become.
---
He's rolling around in money rn
---
Compare to their other games? Probably not the financial success they want compared to Fallout 4 or Doom. But they are still adding content to the game. If the cost to produce that content and run the servers was greater than the expected return then they wouldn't do it. They have to be turning a profit at this point.
---
I can't find the parts where they are supposed to be. That's part of my original email that's truncated in the screen shot.
---
So much wrong with your comment, I don't know where to start.
---
Are you yelling at "us guys" to pay more for no reason or not be "all talk" and NOT pay more to show our disapproval?
---
Also, paying at this point doesn't go into the pocket of a developer like a GoFundMe page.
---
And why should we pay a developer for a half-assed product?
---
You mean like every fallout game bethesda made?
---
NO ONE CARES
---
Damn people enjoying a game really upsets you doesn’t it? 😉
---
ESO still gets edged out by retail WoW, but the way they're both trending it may finally unseat that behemoth after 15 years. It still would be a far cry from what WoW was in its hey day but that would be a huge achievement. Some are arguing that FFXIV is heading in a better direction than ESO with some of the mechanics added recently but I still think the newest monetization schemes are nowhere near as bad as retail WoW. Except for unlimited mat storage, but it is what it is.
---
Exactly what I plan to do
---
People like you are why the video game industry is ruined.
---
Get your bullshit outta here. Games used to cost 50 bucks like 3 decades ago. Games should at least cost double that or triple that by now but gamers are so broke their disposable income can't keep up with inflation. It's either you pay $150 for a game or make whales pay so that you don't have to.
---
I prefer to let my action of not dumping any more money after paying full retail for this game at launch be my action.  Why would I want to put more money into this game when it was broken at launch and continues to be broken?  Giving anymore money is condoning bad behavior and business practices they have been displaying.  I mean if you go out to eat and your waiter/waitress decides to dump your drink in your lap and shit on your meal do you too them after paying full price for it?  I didn't think so.
---
Aww how cute you already back peddled on your comment 😂😂😂
---
Do that on a private server. :)
---
+1. Needs to happen. Then I could play with myself.... Yes, I went there....
---
I put 4k pounds of junk in mine 😅 my junk mule feels the relief and I’ll never need junk again haha
---
I had my camp, for a while by spruce knob channel. Couldn't load in, stayed anyway. The offending camp, was on the other side of the pond from where mine would have been. That annoyed me.
---
You'd hope that... when they start a project with a budget... they don't use the micro-transactions to fund said project... I understand they have to be paid, but that's what the money we paid for the game should have been for. It's no one's fault, but BGS, that the game at launch was in a state that affected its sales negatively. We shouldn't be punished with extra payment for features that we should've had. (Referring to infinite storage, the servers I'm okay with being paid for). Hopefully going forward this model stops, and they actually release a fully optimized and playable game at launch.
---
That’s perfectly valid, and I totally understand.  I just half a handful of studios that I feel have kept faith with their fans, so I’d like to support that.  I want there be positive as well as negative reinforcement.  I want the Bethesdas and EAs to see what actually caring for your customers can get you.
---
If you're not paying, then investors will. More reason to listen to investors than these 'fanbois'. That's how it is
---
Wouldn't want people to have a different opinion from the reddit hivemind, would we?
---
On console, Arks peer-to-peer / locally hosted games suck and you're forced to follow each other around. You either have to pay for servers or pay for another separate console to host it. Also, in private servers, would people have to start their characters again for each server they join? or would it be fully customizable empty map / server, with the story mode &amp; event removed?
---
Hmmmmm
---
If you are for shoot&amp;loot i'd go with destiny and division
---
If setting&amp;story i'd say horizon zero dawn, darksiders 1-2-3 (2 being weakest) or a proper mmo like wow classic or retail or final fantasy
---
If you just love post apocalyptic immersion try metro series (exodus has the best hub/open world system ever), tomb raider series and of course gears of war
---
Gratz with taking the big step and leaving this pile of shit with mist of us, have fun, and see ya when wastelanders releases!
---
thanks for the blessing. right back atcha!
---
because that guy has something we don't. leverage(our wallets and disdain hasn't been enough). if they want the site they got to corporate.
---
Have you tried paying 99.99?
---
Sure, for an extra $6.99 per month.
---
You know thats not what im saying.
---
Im just saying for $60 + $12.99/month, you could get a *lot* more than this.
---
100% out door camps where there is no structure. Everything is just scattered about along the ground or a couple free standing foundations
---
Junk should have zero weight when in the stash, but it should still have weight in a players inventory.  I feel that would work best, adds the convenience while not changing the basic game-play loop.
---
Whats an eu citizen?
---
Look. When devs mess up, fanbois are so quick to fuck them over and boycott their product nowadays. It's the investors that's giving them a second chance and offering them a budget to start over. Devs don't have to listen to you. You are way too volatile
---
You realize you can earn atoms for free right
---
And you can earn them at a rate to have most of the things you want in the atomic shop
---
I wAnT EvEryThInG tO Be FrEe 😭😭😭
---
Yes! Outer worlds!
---
Its almost like somethings are more obvious and easier to fix than others
---
Well, all enemy and player levels stay the same. So......?
---
There are two wiring points on the door. The obvious one that looks like a switch powers the keypad. Connect a wire immediately above the centre of the door opening to power with a pressure plate as well

Knowing an ounce of coke is a lot and being able to do simple math doesn't really count as knowing an 'awful lot' about drugs. You're Rick Sanchez, you know more about drugs than anyone.
---
Oh wow grafton mayor bug was so hard huh
---
That's odd. I have a standard Xbox One and a shitty Chinese internet connection but it's usually fine except for melee lag. There are a lot of bugs. It is a Bugthesda game.
---
Ha no it isn't cause no it can't.
---
People either weren’t playing or completely delusional about the fact that this has been a mess since the god damn release
---
All the “it’s not that bad” “I’m still having fun” finally getting the memo
---
Lol, then I guess it was never meant to be!
---
yeah because bethesda really cares about a bunch of morons standing outside vault 76....
---
Yes and you ignore the entire game architecture to do it. A game like Ark because of the massive world and tons of creatures in it puts a tether limit on players preventing then from getting more then 40 or 50 m away from host.
---
Beefer pcs can extend or remove this limitation because they have the CPU and memory to run the server and the game as well. But consoles are SOL on that aspects.
---
I love this game too I just don't like and hate what Buythesda is doing to it all in the name of profit.
---
It's monetising everything we hold dear about the franchise, making us pay piece meal for each QoL item and costume.
---
They are preying on our nostalgia just to line their pockets with cash, all the good stuff is going into the atom shop and not into the base game for us to enjoy.
---
I'm not saying everything should be free, they still need our money to hopefully improve the game but it wouldn't hurt to have at least more into the base game instead of giving us the bare minimum they have been of late
---
Are you guys actually trading in game items or with real money?
---
Excited for what exactly friend?
---
I will soon mate cant wait :D
---
OH NO THEY HAVE FUN ! HHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTEEEEEE !   
---
I mean you must admit, laughing your ass off because of bugs is a dumb reason sure, but you still having fun dumbo !
---
Be gone, peasant.
---
Well I mean, you'd first have to pay 13 dollars.
---
Exactly people don’t realize. Any publicity is good publicity. Especially when it comes to huge companies. They got everyone talking.
---
I mean, I'm not married so I have cancelled significant vacation time when something big has happened at work. Once I have a wife and kids I'd probably be in Pete's boat, but the guy you're replying to very well could be someone who would do exactly that.
---
You really think you paid enough by paying 60 dollars for a AAA game? Doom 2 used to cost 50 dollars three decades ago. You gotta pay some more on top of that to claim that you done your job.
---
Or people just play the game a lot and want extra content even though they know it’s bs
---
I mean, I stuck around for the most part. And if by volatile you mean I don't settle for less than good, then yes I guess I'm volatile. You are right about investors, but I think that if people don't buy into it, it doesn't happen. And they don't have to listen to me or to anyone really, but as someone who's within their target audience I'd hope they do, since the game they are making is meant to appeal to me and those like me. It's a good game, but I know it can be better, and putting a paywall instead of fixing the issues isn't really going to do it.
---
This is awesome. It seems like they got a ton of stuff done.
---
They did some server fixing yesterday actually. Did you check today?
---
Your life must be sad if you are posting on here like this. I’m sorry little guy. Sounds like someone doesn’t have 13$ to their name.
---
Those are much more difficult and a lot more grinding plus division story sucks
---
Obsidian didn't make the decision
---
Not yet but I will
---
How dare you have an opinion.
---
Wouldn't becthe first time neckbeards harrass people because of their opinion. How idiotic do you have to be to think the players are at fault
---
I don't understand the vanguard labeled bolstering thing.   I crafted a vanguard vault armor.
---
You keep everything BUT the tent, and your scrap box cannot be added to once your sub runs out
---
Probably.
---
Guilty on number 3, had to relocate after an update made my old spot unavailable so I just threw it down in the middle of the road to acces my stash and workbenches, after a while rebuilt my old house there. Now it bothers me that I'm right on that road but I don't feel like rebuilding it all over again. I tried the blueprint thing but it doesn't work for my base.
---
I refuse. I'm Australian, it's like $150+ a year or something ridiculous.
---
I like the idea of a Scrapbox but I don’t like the infinite aspect of it. Now that we know it’s not completely impossible to give players more room, I just wish we had more space in our stash.
---
First of all, you've gotten more content out of this game than any other $60 game, so there's that. Bethesda doesn't owe you anything. It doesn't sound like this game is what you're looking for in a video game, period. Why keep bitching about it?
---
Oh wow, sure glad someone who has absolutely no way to know can tell me exactly how hard a bug was, huh
---
This is the same company that said Fallout 3 would have 200 endings, Skyrim's engine doesn't support spear animations (same engine as Morrowind), Oblivion NPCs weren't scripted, etc.
---
It's taking away a part of the game, but back before fallout 76 launched it was a part of the game people familiar with fallout 4 didn't expect to have to deal with to the degree they did.
---
The nature of fallout 76s respawning items made it less of a hassle than you'd expect based on 4s Gameplay.
---
It very notably creates a scenario where a player could plausibly make it so they don't need to think about scrap for an extremely long time.
---
How sad is your life that you have to spend the past three days ranting and screeching about a game you hate.
---
Maybe go see a therapist and talk to someone
---
Here are the people responsible for the decisions:

How do you know stash bug was easier than most friend? Thought so! 😸😸😸
---
Not taking a side but you don’t work at Bethesda and have no clue how hard or easy it is to fix
---
All this bitching over this guy's post, but don't bother coming up with solutions of your own. If you disagree with him then post why you think he's wrong and offer your own solution. At least he's thinking of a way for Bethesda to get Goodwill back while the rest of you are sitting on your asses hoping Bethesda just fixes everything when we all know they won't.
---
For Bethesda to do anything we need to actually complain and offer solutions rather than not saying anything at all.
---
I dont even own 76, i just love comin here to see how pissed off everyone is lol
---
Might want to let the OG devs of fallout know this, cause as far as they can tell this is the best advertisement for outer world's...
---

---
Are you really tryna defend Bethesda even after all this shit? Nothing they’ve done is a good thing they are the biggest laughingstock in gaming along with blizzard.
---
It’s not cheating it just saves time
---
Psychosis these days lol
---
No but we expected more server options and control and them not charging as much as they are. Hell if they just offered the ability for players to make a server people could of done it cheaper and with more options
---
Well if you paid them enough by buying atoms more often, they wouldn't have had to do this. It's always a tug of war between 'investors first' vs 'gamers first' during an online game development. Well, 'gamers first' guys lost because you wouldn't pay shit for their product and that's why 'investors first' guys are taking over. Good job people
---
Yeah, it's ridiculous. I'm just gonna pretend it doesn't excist
---
People here, best fanbase any company can wish, have created fucking threads with code fixes in them aka simple code changes in the game's files and they take months to get implemented if ever and stasher gets a fix in three days? 
---
Do you honestly believe it friend?
---
Gotta echo what others have also stated: harassment and toxicity are certainly not the right way to go about this, the point they are making is not an invalid one. People who pay for such stuff are the people who *enable* more and worse of the same to happen. While any one of you may not be singlehandedly responsible for the situation, you're certainly part of the problem and not the solution. Sadly, it's this sense of collective responsibility that seems to be missing in gaming communities lately (unless some real world-ending shitstorm happens, maybe).
---
Honestly when I heard it I thought it was gonna be a subscription service with all Fallout games included, and some extras

I you like shoot &amp; loot Warframe is great free game.

Confirmed that they only last 20 minutes

Those links are meant for keeping the domain registered and the site hosted. There's also a charitable link. As long as the $$ raised is used for those purposes hes doing nothing wrong according to the law.
---
This post was a smartass show, indeed. "I'm being treated like an idiot, ha ha, you don't have money to be idiots like us". 
---
It's just really sad to see how games that could had been so good end up like this and YET you find idiotic individuals like them that, even after everything that has happened, they still support it. Are they getting payed? I always wonder... 
---
Do people really like to be treated like garbage or they simply don't have enough IQ to reason? XD
---
)) looking at the downvotes. ..  sharing an opinion is unappreciated
---
Borderlands 3 is worth a go, they haven’t yet flooded it with DLC so many of the planets have large open areas ripe for exploration and there is usually something to find. Also the loot is great.
---
4 hours in and no bugs, it actually does work.
---
I tried too, then I logged on the morning of the update and 80% of my friends list was in private servers. A big aspect of Fallout 76 was playing with friends, now they are all in their own servers making it almost boring playing with them, it made an empty world feel emptier.
---
 Normally I would agree but it comes out in 2020 and it’s a good price
---
I would but in protest I’ve removed all traces of the game from my pc.
---
Everythings fine and I went from 800lbs in my reg stash to 350.
---
I play on a X with gigabit ethernet, and an S with a 2.5ghz wi-fi connection. Runs fine on both for me, the only issue I have is some FPS drag on the S.
---
Clear your cache, maybe? This game really is a different beast for everyone. I've never really had issues with disconnects or bugs, but there are *lots* of people who still do.
---
You gotta hand it to reddit, the hive mind and circle jerking is pretty impressive.
---
If the products were actually worth anything, I might spend money on them. Nothing looked good enough to spend money on. Besides, they shouldn't be relying on micro transactions to get the game finished. I'm sure they made estimates on how much it would cost. They should've planned. I would've paid for stuff that was good, but there was nothing. Or at least, there wasn't enough stuff to make me buy currency, since the one I got in-game was enough to buy the 1 every 2 months, semi- good looking item.
---
Please hold your applause, citizen
---
I like your passion.  That being said... Yes I have paid enough.  I'm from that old school thought that once you have paid whatever sticker price was plus the tax that you have "done your job".  Using the inflation argument is smart on your end, but ultimately null.  If they wanted to charge more for their game at launch can't they just charge more for it?
---
GTA5 might not have been the best example, but I have another one - Dota2. All heroes are ABSOLUTELY free for everybody. They haven't sold a single p2w item during the 9 years of Dota's lifespan. And their subscription costs 3Eu a month. (less if you buy subscription for a year).
---
Yo
---
No but there is easy glitches to get in your own public lobby on Xbox/PC
---
I can imagine how a very large amount of scrap could be stored in a settlement....I guess that the thing that seems even less realistic is how your scrap is available at any work bench anywhere. In FO4 that was never the case....you could with the right perks build a trading network between your settlements though that achieved that within your settlements only though.
---
A helmet from an Anthem suit
---
So you want paid dlc, season passes, and direct currency buys? Instead of all content for free forever, and only paid qol, servers, and skins?  what is wrong with you?
---
The only reason those work is they force EVERYBODY to spend.  Otherwise you miss out.  With 1st Nobody HAS to pay for any mission, map, or play mode ever again.
---
Are you a Commie?
---
Excellent stuff. Looking forward to the big wigs coming out cap in hand.
---
On Xbox at least there are usually 6-10 people per event for the ones worth going to (one violent night, uranium fever, heart of the swamp, etc.).
---
Social media is a dangerous animal.
---
Especially for those whose position is easily influenced
---
That is like saying blizzard is happy with all the news about them. If thst were the case they'd not be cancelling launch parties.
---
Ha imagine thinking the only metric for "exploration" and "open" was square miles of unbroken map space instead of a depth of characters, lore, choice, mechanics, enemies, varied environments, etc. There is plenty for me to openly explore with this game whereas with fo76 you hear to one 5 minute holotape "and then they all died" you heard them all, monsters are mostly recycled from fallout 4, nothing you do actually affects your world or matters, the mechanics are loot box garbage where they took the lootbox out last minute for fear of reprisals, and you get maybe half a dozen environments of mostly empty space.
---
Right? I mean, they're all bitching that it's pay to play now, but you're just paying to play by yourself on your own server. You can't leave that server, then go to a public server with all of your shit. Is everyone on the sub 15? How can they complain about spending $60 on a video game? That's like seeing four movies. Sometimes movies are shit. If you go and see four sub-par movies in a row, do these same people also go to the movie studios and complain ad-nauseum that their movies weren't what they expected and they're mad they spent money, etc. 
---
Maybe they shouldn't have played through the game as fast as possible and, instead, chosen to do other things besides sit in front of a screen for hours on end. I don't understand this mindset. Nobody is forcing these people to do anything.
---
You can try to paint it that way but it's just an excuse. Companies do not deserve excuses or sentiments, especially when it comes to heavy-handed monetisation.
---
No one here cares, you could have saved yourself a lot of typing if you realized that.
---
Been a day since I looked at this sub and you guys are still going?
---
What a complete sad joke you all are, just leave or play, good grief smh
---
actually i thought i was talking to you. soooo d/t quitting....giveaway?
---
I'm kinda curious what you're thinking too? PC's problems coming to console maybe? They would have to buff up anti-cheat measures for NW and the marine helmet would become a (usually mismatching) BiS head armor, I guess.
---
Hahaha
---
I tried a few times, unsuccessfully. Keeps wanting to default attach to the obvious connection. I'll tinker later.
---
The service shouldn't be more than $10 and the service shouldn't have been implented until more content was added to the game because we haven't gotten shit for the past year besides a couple events and nuclear Winter. Which is just a joke for a game they supposedly want to keep alive for years.
---
Wait, there's an X-rated subsrciption version, too?
---
While I am intrigued, I don't make anything like that available in my house. Thanks for the info, though!
---
How is giving people the option to subscribe to a private server so they can play by themselves "pay-to-play"? I'm guessing you can't go back and forth from private to public with all of your stuff or your camp. Why does it matter? It's not like it's a race or anybody actual comes in first place.
---
Go to an unlooted area in Fallout 76 and count the number of interactive objects within a 10 displayed meters.  Go into your inventory and count the number of lines of inventory you are carrying.  Add the two together and compare to WoW.  Its the # of lines of inventor and the lootable junk that gobbles up server resources.
---
People discussing an issue about a game in a forum dedicated to discussing the game? Blasphemy, right OP?

I play a lot more than a filthy casual lol
---
While it may indeed amount to some small bit of leverage... If Bethesda'd actually wanted it, I'm quite certain they would've bought it in the first place. It's a way too obvious piece of PR for not having one single person on their team who would've thought of it. If they want something with it now it's only to get rid of the negative stuff it contains.
---
It's the fact that we were lied to.
---
Yeah, but data fields are on every item. Those data fields aren't tangible and shouldn't require extra resources to store.
---
Right? (I'm not a real savvy guy.
---
Of you buy the subscription youre screwing over the rest of us by incentivizing companies to continue these shitty business practices
---
Sweet
---
Yikes I can tell I struck a nerve you seem very upset
---
I think bulk got marginally more code-complicated when it had to have a special case coded to stop people accidentally scrapping it. If they allowed bulk in there it would be another piece of logic that would have the potential to revert that change accidentally (if that had happened on top of this week I don’t think people would have been happy). Since bulk junk weighs the same as normal junk (with a couple of exceptions for aluminum and lead) there’s no reason to mass-bulk other than to sell so it’s no big deal that you can’t store bulk in there really.
---
Also I beleive WoW uses fully instanced loot, FO76 does not.
---
Hold up... Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 are both using the same game engine... we had a camp building limit in Fallout 4 for reasons related to game stability...The stash limit related to server stability excuse is perfectly legitimate, and can be perfectly reconciled  with an infinite scrapbox... if you bought more server space (private server) you can store more scrap... just because you can access your scrap box  in a public server doesn't mean that that scrap is actually being stored on that server... it's probably just connecting out to a dedicated server, which might explain why people's scrap are disappearing
---
It's literally every thread and every other comment in every thread. No not blasphemy. I asked a question -- are there any other 76 online communities other than this one and are they all experiencing the same thing.
---
This guy is a hero!!! Hahaha simply genius.
---
Nope.  Just gonna keep my game uninstalled.
---
I honestly assumed they were shit enough to save it as individual items.
---
I am a junkie commando build. My go to guns are an explosive railway with less vats, FFR handmade, explosive laser, and FFR Tesla for those stealthy boys. PvP rules dictate we can only do a max of 110 damage to players, so RoF and TTK reign supreme. If you can VATs your target, crit shot them, it goes completely through their armor. 
---
As far as PvE damage that railway is one of the best junkies weapons I own.
---
By being a good game. You make a good game and be good to the community then the community will be good back by buying the in game currency or a subscription. Bethesda hasn't been good to the game or community.
---
Cause gamers are so broke they will never be able to pay $150 for a copy. Publishers rather give away the game for cheap and try to make up for that loss by selling microtransactions.
---
This does seem to be the truth, there is politics at play in the development of any game, shame really.
---
Wish that I could demo it for you - can't though as on xbox. I guess that we can't rule out there being a glitch currently - certainly I remember one of the powered door variants' keypad just didn't work. 
---
Are you using the brick / plaster one or another variant?
---
In exchange you get a depth of characters, choice, and events offering replayabilty you'll get your money's worth and be satisfied that's what matters
---
I could be mistaken, but I thought this thread was about professional flacks like Pete Hines and grunts like the community managers who post here on Reddit.
---
Oh wow, I contacted all my friends on the list and we all decided we weren't going to buy into that. We have more fun on an open world helping others
---
I'm definitely not the only one who bought it and I definitely don't feel like I'm screwing everyone else over.. we all have access to the same thing
---
ESO is an actual game with support and content and you can see your subscription fueling the development of the game since it is an MMO. Fo76 is not an MMO and in a year has had no real content updates and still has far less content than fallout 4 launched with. Its a lazy cash grab
---
Whales and shills will continue to enable Bethesdas's shitty choices, and there's nothing we can do to stop them.
---
Was this a defense? Eh not the intent... More like pointing out that the brokenness upon release that allowed people to break it worse by taking advantage of glitches to duplicate everything would have been worse in the long run? Like remember when people were selling duped legendaries for real money? That was nuts
---
Actually GTA5 is a very good example it shares the orignal Fallout76 model a live service game with all DLC free supported by microtransactions, GTAV even shares a similar way to handling the online mode its instanced limited to a number of people per instance (adventure mode) and has an Inivte only mode (Private world Mode)
---
Yeah but at least you'll have a game that's stable
---
You should have known that buying the sub would have gotten other players to notice you and players are pissed at the moment. 
---
Ignoring them, blocking and, reporting is the best thing to do but trying to get sympathy from this sub isn't a good idea.
---
If you think this story has a happy ending then you haven't been paying attention
---
16x the lod wasnt a lie tho?
---
Hive mind .....better follow the sheep
---
I paid £16 for the game and have spent nothing else, getting close to 500 hours, so I do feel a bit guilty to be honest, that is a ton of entertainment for a measly amount of money.
---
I would say your are being a little insensitive because not everyone can buy a $60 game (for base, $80-$100 for special editions) then continue to pile money onto it for something that makes you actually better in game! If this were a free game it’d make more sense! But to sell a final product, then continue to gouge money from me for something that seems necessary for the dumpster fire start you had with this game! Some people cannot continue to pay and pay. Some people do not make what you or I make. If you have them means for a private servers and all the amenities then that’s great! But I can’t support a group of people building and basing games on this model. It’s corrupt and unfair to all those that pay for the game. What happened to good story driven DLC? My point being not all of us are able to do this monthly. Some people live check to check and an added monthly charge is not feasible. What makes me most upset is the lack of sympathy that gamers have for each other. It’s such a toxic and damning environment to be unhappy with a product or vocalize displeasure with business tactics from one of the most beloved game series. I just wish people took a second to think outside their own personal situation and see why these issues are important to other people.
---
Yeah I agree, i would have  paid for the service if it was A, in a bug free, stable, playable state. And B if I got any value for my money. Those of us that have just blindly gone ahead and payed, even if it's just for one month to get the ranger suit have fucked up big style.
---
I've never known any other service these days that just expects you to pay for something straight of the bat like that, no 30 day free trial, nothing. Just pay us please!
---
If you want a circle jerk, that's where you go.  If you wanna see the community response, stay here.   
---
Or just stay off Reddit if you don't want to see whinging. 
---
I don't know what to tell you.
---
AUD too I just realised, not as much of a difference though. I think people have been saying it’s $13 in USD. It’s $23 AUD which is about $15.70 USD.
---
Racism maybe?

Because NW is an unbalanced dumpster fire.

Here's the gist of it. If you tinker around with power connectors points (the thing wires connect to), you can make it look a lot cleaner.
---
Hope it helps.
---
Yeah I am upset. AAA game developers are going downhill while those sellout mobile game developers are raking in cash. First Bioware, then Bethesda and now Blizzard and Ubi as well. These fuckers are trying their best to monetize their AAA platform but while it's costing them billions, they ain't making much money. And if they fuck up, their losses are astronomical. I'm afraid gaming landscape will turn into something mobilegamesque very soon. It really shocked me when Ubisoft announced they are barely making any money this year. Wtf is happening?
---
Autism not even once
---
I do pray the people working in the trenches of Austin make a decent living, they have lives and families to.
---
I've seen the community response quite a bit. I guess all the negativity is irking me the wrong way this morning. 
---
Just tell me the game is good still! Lol. 
---
To be honest I'm afraid of everyone uninstalling
---
We actually left her alone for several minutes and just farmed the mobs, which provided several legendary enemies
---
Gamers are not broke Lil buddy.  You might be.  But gamers on a whole are not broke.  
---
Regardless, this all gets solved on both sides if a superior product had been delivered instead of what was given.  Is that something that we both can agree upon?
---
Yes I think I remember another thread where someone from Australia mentioned the price for a year being higher!
---
Yeah its on your end.  I run an X with no special cooling mods, stuck in a slot on my tv stand that doesnt allow for good ventilation.  Just now my internet was 42 down 19 up.  The game has consistantly run just fine.  Since the last update there have been a few minor render issues, though nothing consistant nor problematic.  Try clearing your cache as others have said and give it another go.
---
Fair enough. There should have been one post that was pinned to the top of the forum that everyone could use to express their disgust, and another where they could openly express that they're are whores to Bethesda.
---
Then we could see how the community actually feels. Because I see a lot of posts and people saying how shit it is, but I also see a good amount of ranger suits out there. So people are buying this shit.
---
Then a game like FO76 is not for you and you should have known that from day 1.
---
There's absolutely no way this game would survive on initial sales alone.
---
They need to make money to support content creation and game sales will not do that. 
---
People want atom shop and all this crap just added in for free... It's dumb
---
Adam Savage is probably available.
---
Oh and now mindless hate for people with autiem, what's next? Black people in power roles or those dammm woman.

I would rather ammo weighed 0

People are expressing their anger! What a bunch of jerks."
---
"-Every smoothbrain and shill on this SR.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
I mean, we all get it, you're disappointed, emotional and incapable of moving on, but enough with the endless "i uninstalled.../I will never support Bethesda again" topics.
---
$100 USD = approx £77
---
UK  are paying £99.99
---
I don't think there has ever been a single point in time when Bethesda gave a shit about FO76. 
---
And that's scary, because even though Bethesda doesn't give a fuck and never did, people still buy it a year later. Both the game and the F U 1st sub service. THAT is a scary thought.
---
Can we all do the robot exclusive dance like literally all 18 of us launching 3 nukes in a pubbie world last night?
---
The only place with outrage is the toxic groups on reddit and YouTube.
---
Everyone else is having fun a game lol.
---
OTOH, I adventured with one guy for like 3 hours with my mic on and him just emoting before he randomly started talking. Some people just prefer not using them, for whatever reason.
---
Honesty I think it would have gone over much much smoother had fallout 1st had just been private servers and some atoms. It’s the gameplay altering perks that are only available with the subscription making the whole ordeal so much worse.
---
They need to stop people complaining about people complaining about people complaining that other players who pay are idiots doing us all a disservice and the company is off the deep end.
---
The relevant game's subreddit is exactly the place for people to discuss the stuff you're moaning about.
---
lately?
---
He’s counting all the cash made from subs.....keep hating.
---
Fuck me that's a disgrace. It's a 100 pounds in the UK, which is bad enough.
---
I don't know what effect, if any, there is on Bethesda's decisions, but Zenimax is partially owned (30%+), by Providence Equity, a private equity firm.
---
"Buythesda" 😂
---
Exactly, stand there and watch us scrapping everything and put it in our Scrapbox. &lt;3
---
Its a little bit stepford over there
---
 Big difference is that its elite.  The guy who owns frontier was a dev on the first game (in 1986).  Super in touch with gaming.  The guys at zenimax are just billionaires who like to play with money.
---
He said he wasn't looking for a circle jerk where criticism gets you banned.
---
That's honestly great. It's worth that. It's honestly worth $60 too. This post is more geared towards how microtransactions have led developers to not deliver a quality product because people diehards will pay any amount for anything, regardless of content/quality.
---
Take yonggo, as an example of the worst of the worst.
---
&gt;\#We'reAllGoingDownTogether
---
Down on what? That's the question O.o
---
I dunno... I'd rather them focus on something that is potentially deleting inventory than fixing a fucking audio nuisance...
---
And to be honest, the mayor thing has been fixed in my fame so... Maybe just complete the fucking quest and see if that does it.
---
I haven't been able to do Dross Toss in months but I don't give a shit if they're fixing actual problems rather than annoyances
---
Good! Enjoy it, you have witches we have with costumes 😂
---
Oh man it works like literally every subscription I’ve ever signed up for in a game.
---
If it didn’t auto renew then ppl would be complaining about that.
---
Not all gamers live in developed country bro.
---
And yes, if devs can come up with good product all the time, all would be good. But they fuck up from time to time. Things happen. But does it justify killing off the franchise? Is a single mistake not allowed?
---
Yeah in a perfect world hey? Lol
---
People are buying it.. I can justify the monthly sub but if I spent 100 bucks all in one go I can guarantee my gf would be a little choked lol.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
This is a good idea.  take my upvote fellow vault dwellers.  We need to do this on ps4 and xbox one too. We have to stand united,  all platforms.
---
3 more waiting, AND the 3 that broke with the fix of one.
---
Everytime they tweak coding somewhere, something else gets messed up.
---
I'm just mainly upset about the issues that persist since beta.  Like fast traveling and weight issues after dying
---
Todd Howard couldn't code his way out of a paper bag. He's a producer/director at Bethesda. For a Beth shill, you should know that.
---
Removed and banned for a month.  
---
All I said was the camps they're selling look like the old, "Look how many crafting bases I fit into this tent" posts.
---
Lol. True..
---
&gt; probably gonna have a PR nightmare
---
Lol, they aready do. Amirite?
---
Why did they bother making the changes if it is irrelevant ? Its not like they dont have a shit tone to do, that they can fuck arround with balance for the lolz.
---
Usually sad
---
You asked who was a billionaires in all this.  I answered your question?
---
I would but im on xbox
---
That is...correct....
---
Because the modders actually care.
---
Yes!!! I sincerely hope this works!! I love that he’s getting attention
---
Probably part of those misc server stability fixes. They do little tweaks like that all the time
---
I have nothing against them or hold a grudge against the devs in Austin, they are only doing what the higher ups are telling them to do in Bethesda and zenimax.
---
They have to earn a wage just like any of us  and have to do as they are told to do regardless of how awful it may be to the consumer/player base.
---
I like the idea, because I prefer to go home as little as possible, but I don't see it happening.
---
Honestly guys you won't be missing out on fuck all. It's had no meaningful updates since launch and you can't play longer then an hour without running out of things to do. No idea what the people who are paying for the private servers are spending their time in game doing.
---
Can we have cross dressing?
---
Oh wait O.o
---
Also. So much of 76 is defined by the term "half-assed"
---
I love this mindset, it's a new introduction with bugs and question marks all over it, but I kinda feel like we could take it from a fallout 4 story, bring those who need it in, help them find their way and thrive. There were mods for 4 that did that.
---
I guess I just feel like it's probably not going anywhere, and the way I play I'm kinda stoked that this "bottleneck" won't be in the way either!
---
I'm not moaning. I'm trying to have a discussion and I am. I think most of the other posts are moaning, but alright.. I think I'm being pretty fair here.
---

---
What is the VAT situation with something like this?  Just wondering since I remember that from my time overseas...
---
True, just re-skins of the suit with different patterns shows this
---
The community response that includes people who don’t play the game or haven’t played in months? That community?
---
Thanks for the point

"Hurr, you disagree with me, you must not play the game!"
---
What the hell man. Yeah I do have a different opinion but that doesn't make me worst of worst. Why would you call me that?
---
If anything my experience is going to be made better by you buying the sub. Thanks!
---
Not my C.A.M.P., not my problem.
---
Weird, I've seen some awesome camps on those monorail towers.
---
20-30 per star or per unit of scrip (multiples of 3 or 5)? Im the only one in my group who sells legendaries for scrip so I have no idea how anyone else does it
---
Shoe fits
---
The funny think is you get 1600 atom each month for free with sub so it’s almost a wash.....lol.  The brats still not happy or maybe they allow feelings and emotions to short circuit their brain.
---
I’m loving the sub and the exclusives and it cost the price of a few TENDIE plates and Red Bull’s.  Before the Atom wash of course.
---
*canned laughter and applause and end credits*
---
I had to!
---
But yeah you are right, they are getting slated dude even when I watching Chibi play Outer Worlds, he played a ton of F76 and even he slated it
---
My advise would be don't buy it yet, there's nothing there to justify it, just broken private worlds, broken scrap boxes, a low res ranger suit, and some wanky emotes.
---
So unless you buy atoms regularly, or really need a tent theres no value in it. It's just not there yet for me.
---
As far as this sub goes, i know how you feel, i was thinking the same thing this morning. But it'll die down like it did with the robots and I see a lot of robots out there aswell now.
---
Maybe its because USA prices are presented without VAT, while EU prices must have VAT already included.
---
That's not correct. So storing an item programmatically in a list and adding an object into the game world to render are two totally different things. What you're talking about in fallout 4 was a limit on the number of placeable items in a camp because too many items rendered in the world could cause performance issues. This makes a lot of sense.
---
However, you could have 25000 rounds of every ammo type and scrap type in fallout 4 in your base inventory or you could have 1 of every type and there is going to be no size difference. The reason for this is what's "stored" aren't rendered in the world. It's just a list of text values coming from an internal database. It might be a kb of difference, maybe. There reasoning behind this has always been two reasons. 
---
1. To add artificial scarcity to the game so trade could be a thing among players. Why would you ever trade for anything if you could just store as much as you want of it for example. 
---
2. Eventually package increases too this limit behind some kind of pay wall like ESO.
---
So it's silly to think that you need your own private server to host "your unlimited stash" because they don't have the server space. I'm a software engineer and hold a masters degree in machine learning for some context. I've written databases with 10's of millions of data points in them and their size is negligable. With correct indexing on a relational database the upper limit on the number of rows is astronomical because indexing keeps the overall cardinality low. So searching takes microseconds, and in this case having 1 in a column or the largest possible BLOB int in a column is also negligable. When I read their original arguments a year ago and just laughed and walked away from the game. It's a business strategy and nothing more. They're just assuming most of their fan base is ignorant to basic data science.
---
I donated the cost of a monthly subscription 😁
---
&gt; Its because FO76 has a long string of fuckups punctuated by uproars like this. Lack of content worth $60 plus a bunch of price gouging stuff = unhappy consumers. 
---
Every uproar actually surrounding the game has countless examples from other games doing worse things.  Further, if you read my first comment "The only thing I understand is the disappointment in the lack of content, to be honest."  Also , I never once reframed anyone's argument (that's what a strawman is), but literally in your sentence in which you were telling me not to strawman,  
---
&gt; Please dont strawman everything into "entitled gamer bad, me good, me opinion smart." 
---
you strawmanned me.  If you can point out where I strawmanned that would be really nice, until then I'll assume you meant to call yourself out.
---
No worries sir, and hey I'm just testing it out. I didn't do the full year lol.
---
No. I’m referring to the many people who outright say they don’t play. Just read through the posts. It’s at least half of those complaining who say they either never bought the game or only played at beta
---
There was a time when Pete didn’t tweet for almost an entire YEAR
---
Oui moi aussi
---
Was just gonna say the uk price fucking disgrace mate

I see a lot of people who are quitting and are justifying never coming back.  
---
Seems like valid criticism.
---
obsidian couldnt afford what B would need to get for it to cover costs and loans they need to pay back
---
Cease and desist incoming for sure.
---
You've got to be fucking kidding me. I have wasted all my vault steel because there isn't going to be a better armorset for my build than the Unyielding/Cav heavy combat armor that I already have. That kinda bites my ass.
---
😂😂😂👍
---
The full year is a good deal for those who already buy atoms
---
“You’re spending money on a game you love? You disgusting bethesda whore! “
---
Pretty sure it's the different laws and regulations about taxes tbh. For once, it may not actually be Bethesda's fault.
---
Seems to be just like ESO-plus, which I don’t have a problem with..
---
But next time please use some paragraphs ;p
---
I agree it's not worth it for what it is now especially for the full year but at least they got around to fixing the scrap. And to be honest after losing all my scrap goin around collecting and exploring for all the junk was actually a really enjoyable 2 hrs last night and now I have more scrap than I originally did.
---
60 dollars is a ton of money?  Is this the first game you saved up for?
---
You get out what you put in sub is the best way to go.
---
Yeah I will defend then you kids have zero concept about the world or you set unrealistic expectations about a video game.
---
Beth lies boohoo
---
Give me a break
---
Really? Doesn’t make much sense to me. They are upset because other people decided to pay extra and therefore want to quit a game they enjoy?
---
Considering that, beyond Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Josh Sawyer very little of the OG Fallout team, even the New Vegas team, remains at Obsidian, I highly doubt it would be anything revolutionary or give the franchise any sort of creative boost. 
---
Now if Microsoft had Obsidian, in partnership with in Exile, and hired Chris Avellone as a freelance writer, then maybe we'd get something that feels like a true sequel to the originals and New Vegas. But Bethesa/Zenimax is a pretty large publisher, and even with these fuck ups they've still got plenty of clout and money left in their coffers. So it's gonna take some real disastrous shit for them to put one of their major in house franchises on the auction block.
---
Oh man, I hate noiseplant!
---
So if i live in Zimbabwe does it cost $100 ZWD (the equivalent of 28c US)?
---
_"Blame is lame. Responsibility, honesty, and respect peeps."_
---
Okay, dood.
---
I'll renew monthly, that's why I did it in the first place because I wanted that dank samurai costume lol that and my gf is big into the cosmetics and camp building so we spend a bit on the atom shop monthly.
---
It’s lag and hit detection.  Especially if using a weapon with super fast swing speed.
---
Hey, thanks for posting this. Very useful!
---
This.
---
Clever man, clever.
---
Calm down there superfan. The corporation doesn't actually love you back.
---
The game has a life of its own really, breathing and struggling to get it right. Like a self-centered toddler who just wants what it wants and you're gonna deal with whatever shit comes at you til the kid grows and learns how to manage better. Not that this kid won't still be out for itself lol
---
Forgive the weird analogy, having 3 of my own kid, it just fits.
---
F76 sold copies based on the love fans had for 3 NV and 4. 3 did good but not because of us longterm fans. NV did well thanks to 3s rep. And 4 drew in even more because people knew and loved 3 and NV. 
---
There are more regular fans than superfans pushing this franchise forward. 
---
76 will be a setback for the series. If it wasn't a Fallout game itd have died 3 months after launch. 
---
The damage to the brand will more likely hurt launch sales of Fallout 5 than anything else.
---
There should be a couple of wastelanders called Todd and Howard  who try to sell you stuff that you have already paid for.
---
Lol I thought about it and decided nope inspires additional correspondence.
---
I agree to some extent. Like the scrap box thing is definitely not necessary for the game. I'm level 166 now though and do have and it's a welcome addition for me.
---
I'm glad I didnt have it through the campaign and I would recommend everyone complete a playthrough without it.
---
I feel it's more and end game addition.
---
It’s really mind boggling that they turned one of the best video game franchises into candy crush
---
You are the reason Bethesda is a thing. You are enabling them to be greedy and like this. Well, Zenimax, really... they're the ones calling the shit.
---
I really hope you're a troll.
---
Wrongo chuckles.  You've misidentified the source of the anger.  They don't give a fuck what Johnny whale and Jimmy shill do.  They're insulted that Bethesda thinks this is good value and has held back community requested features only to hide them behind a paywall.
---
Killing off a franchise and not supporting microtransactions and a bogus subscription to a broken game are just a little different.  If not supporting this dumpster fire ends up killing the franchise then yes that's sad.  But YOU have to remember that THEY killed it by giving us that steak with a healthy dump of shit right on top of it with that nice drink saturating your lap.
---
Yup just dream.
---
Most games aren’t perfect, but most games don’t have more bugs than features
---
you're basically arguing with a brick wall
---
But they stay to troll and insult people who are remaining positive. This dude just asked about another sub without toxicity and instead you get all these assholes complaining about the membership.
---
Lol. Yea ok. If you really feel that hurt do what you want. My experience isn’t impacted in any way. Nothing is taken away from me.
---
Sounds like deeply seeded sexual issues. I think you might go and see a therapist. I kid I actually don't think that is a bad idea. Seriously though keep your sex fantasies private.
---
"Because you wouldn't pay shit for their product" What the what? I paid $60 usd on day one, the price set by the studio, the studio that also promised the atom shop would be "cosmetic only." The studio that promised DLC and future features would be available to everyone playing. You're absolutely right, I didn't spend shit on their atom shop because even though I have a decent job *I couldn't be convinced to spend 20 real dollars for a digital paint job.* I never entered some agreement to financially support a game I already bought in order to access updates for the game. I am the consumer, its Bethesda's sales team job to convince me to spend my money on their products, and at this point they've failed completely because I'm leaning towards never buying anything from them ever again.
---
Everyone is complaining like FO1st is some HUGE advantage and essential to the game so they're being forced to buy it.
---
Does it increase your damage, no
---
Does it increase your damage or rad resistance, no
---
Does it increase the rate at which you gain experience, no
---
(ESOs service increases experience and cash gain and you don't see their community screaming bloody murder about it)
---
Does it give you access to any kind of item that has any effect on combat, no
---
The only advantage I can see is now I have enough storage space to actually cell some of the heavier items in my vendor (which is actually more advantageous to my potential customers than it is to me) while still having room to store my own stuff (my inner hoarder is pleased by this)
---
Other than that please explain to me how this service gives any kind of competitive edge or is essential to the point that it's worth all this complaining.
---
I almost forgot, the ranger helmet does work as a gas mask so I guess there is one utility item we get that everyone else can't have. Too bad gas masks aren't abundant in the game....
---
(If you're living check to check why did you pay $60 for the game to begin with? you probably should have saved that money or at least waited till it went on sale)
---
I think people should actually look at Juice head's video here  https://youtu.be/sHbXEouo7fk to see a really good reason as to why this is happening. Seems to just happen a lot nowadays.
---
Lol. 
---
Yeah man, I am in just total disbelief that they are seriously putting this absolute clusterfuck out there. It is literally insane.
---
People like you are the reason why we went from $20 games to $60 games that have shit quality and a ton of microtransactions.
---
Also stop with the whole, "you think $60 for a online game is too much? Ha! You must be one of those poor people ive heard about" schtick? Ive bought a bunch of $60 games before, what im saying is that fo76 is not worth it compared to something like dishonored 2 or eso.
---
Next week excited see what they about the whole 1st thing and so on
---
No one, I think.
---
sort of a problem from a lore perspective, Synths will not exist in that quality for a LONG time.
---
Calm down whiny, you’re not being forced to buy and doesn’t stop you from playing.
---
People responding to you using in-universe propaganda to counter your point lol. As if you're supposed to "agree" with Liberty Prime. If anything I would say the games are kind of neutral, but they definitely focus more on showing the bad sides of America.
---
Definitely in the UK I'm not sure how it works in rest of EU or how high their VAT is but in UK it is 20%
---
That’s just normal for consoles
---
This is it then. Just like Mass Effect. Fans won't give them another chance
---
That picture is not great lol
---
You deserve every single message you get for spending money on an additional subscription for a full price game. They shit on your plate (once again) and you just enthusiastically eat it all up.
---
They come up with these insane money making schemes because dumb fucks like you keep buying it.
---
I wonder what the highest date is for a server? Appreciate the info, and went to look myself—seems to be true! Thank you!
---
Coming soon to Fallout 1st!
---
No, more information require more resources. Steel scrap has several pieces of information that needs to be stored. What it is, Where it is, how much it weighs, what it costs, how many you have and the 3d model. A gun has tons more. What it is, Where it is, how much it weighs, what it costs, it's durability, it's level, the ammo it uses, how much ammo you have for it, what it breaks down into, which mods it has(this will be multiple data points for each mod), the fire rate, the range, the accuracy, the damage, the name you give it, the skin, 3 possible Legendary effects, the 3d model, each modular piece that updates the 3d model, the firing and reload animations, is it broken, which perks affect, etc. Some of these might be handled by other system, but they are still things that the game has to know. And guns are all unique, they don't stack, so each one is hitting the server. 1 Steel scrap has the exact same data as 5000.
---
In fairness, Frontier did just tell us all that the cool carrier update we were all looking forward to in December wouldn't be out until fucking JUNE.
---
Duh?  Being optional doesn't stop it from being terrible.
---
Yeah VAT is 20% all digital sales are the same and then they just round it up a bit to make digital store/publisher a little bit more per sale. It's literally the same on ALL digital sales. No idea how so many other Brits just magically forget that 20% tax on all things. This is our government not Bethesda.
---
Really. Because there are still tons of PS4 exclusives, that have massive budgets, and release without a bug, with full polish and perfection. They win awards, and make millions. They release some DLC and it sells well because... QUALITY! WHat do people say about CD Project Red? Witcher 3 DLC? Scam? Predatory monetization? No, they say that it is great valuer and moneys worth. And now years later, you get it all in one bundle on sale, as usual with games. When I saw Fallout 76 full price on PS4 store I was like HA! I paid full price are release and I never played such a buggy broken mess of a game. I never crashed so much. Sony should ban Bethesda from releasing games on the platform after that shit. Totally unacceptable. Oh poor multi-million/billion corporations not making enough for 3 new yachts for every executive and investor. Boo hoo! It's time for gamers to stop buying games from these greedy companies. There are plenty of good ones out there, who make great games, with attention to detail, and full polished working order for release. Many people don't even know the name of those developers, but they know the games! Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Detroit Become Human, The Witcher 3, The Outer Worlds! All games should be like them. No game should ever release like Bethesda games do. It's a disgrace!
---
Yeah, staircases can become a nightmare with building.
---
No shit Sherlock thats why I don’t buy shit that I don’t like.
---
And I'm sure you'll be saying the same line when the next obnoxious thing happens too.  Happy trails, sheep.
---
Thanks for the link. Yeah I’ve always heard of this but right now I’m the only person I know who this has happened to.  One dude I do raids with sometimes doesn’t get a reward but it’s only happens to him every other time.  He has only two plans to go and got one last night.
---
Lets be honest, Fallout 3 was good, like really good.
---
Those comments have to be fake, no human could ever be that stupid to understand why he is protesting a game developer in a title he enjoys. Fake or mentality challenged.
---
I agree with you fully and never even thought of the extra space I get to sell my excess legendary weapons which I sell for very cheap as well.
---
This is a stupid question.
---
Hahaha, that was funny
---
don't bother reasoning with these odd people.  they will keep posting rants and griefing until maybe the mods ban this toxic behavior from the sub.
---
At least they aren’t publicly pandering to China.
---
Nope 100% scrap only
---
For what was given at release, BGS probably owes me about $40 in return. I also paid $60 for Skyrim, Fallout 4, GTA 5, RDR2, Borderlands 3, Shadow of War, pretty much every game I've played this last decade. These are titles I put about the same amount of time into or more as 76, and I never touched the microtransaction stores in any of these games. The games listed also arrived in a much more playable condition than 76, so yes I did my job. BGS did not do their job and is continuing to botch every step along the way with 76.
---
You know what? I'm done arguing. I got called out names, called worst of the worst, called a trash, I kinda get what kind of people I'm dealing with. Talking with you on the other hand wasn't as bad.
---
When they use atom shop floorboards but don't make the floorboards go in the same direction.
---
Bonus points if all but ONE go in the same direction.
---
Gottal love the downvoting brigade. Seriously, how fucking pathetic must you be to be so emotionally invested in a piece of shit game made by a company who constantly shows they don't give a shit about their customers?
---
https://www.instagram.com/p/B4DJVxDJztf/?igshid=h0xficol47pg
---
Got it, free stuff.
---
Exactly. 16x the details was said regarding LOD. And the LOD is vastly improves. People just make lies to point out "lies". For some people the end justifies the means, sadly...
---
The mods? Lmao do they exist?
---
You’re missing the fucking point.
---
It’s because Bethesda outright lied about post-launch content being absolutely free.
---
Fallout 1st adds exclusive content and features locked behind a paywall.
---
The block to crossplay has more to do with Sony being obtuse.  I would guess it has to do with the Atom store or exclusivity
---
https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/1/17522794/fallout-76-ps4-xbox-one-cross-platform-play
---
Oh lord...
---
Thank you for your opinion. Fallout is really dead then. It been a good run for about a decade
---
Brick plaster with the plaster facing out. Only way I  could finagle it onto the glass dome.
---
The entire community is pissed off and wants to rant and you think they shouldn't be able to on the dedicated subreddit? You'd like China.
---
I'm going to go with the latter
---
No it costs a hundred US Dollars no matter where it is. (You're doing your exchange rate backwards) Anything on top of that $100USD is a tax added by the country you live in.
---
Hehe, I mean it could have been worse. Blizzard is in a shit storm and their convention is next week lol.
---
Bethesda the Insane, sane of all ins
---
English checks out
---
What this guy is saying. Fallout 1st costs you less than a yearly subscription to wow, for one. And you can at least play 76 without a subscription
---
Dude I remember pre-ordering Secret of Mana in high school for Nintendo and paying close to 80 bucks on my 2.89 min wage from McDs.
---
60 bucks for FO76 which I’ve gotten hundreds of hours of gameplay is worth it to me.
---
You’re a brat with no concept of what it takes a software company to support a platform and try to make a profit.
---
You can think me and all the other thousands of players that put money into the game because our investment will make your broke experience better.
---
If you would stop letting your fee fees short circuit your brain you will see that the free atom each month with sub is a wash compared to cost of sub......even without exclusives.
---
It’s the most fun my group has had in game and it looks like others are having fun too.
---
Oh I know lol why I'm glad Bungie got them to fuck
---
Great idea! Make things even more p2w with collectrons. Maybe give them guns to defend too?  And while we're at it they can find caps for you. Just keep them basically cosmetic as they are
---
 Don't need even more unfairness.
---
All I asked for was an end game.
---
So there is no vanguard or ‘bolstering’ is actually vanguard just labeled wrong. Is there actually real ‘bolstering’ then? I’m a bit confused
---
No, but it's still an additional item that needs to be stored on the server. You could also store Bobby Pins, Gunpowder, and ores in the same way as scrap.
---
Just think of everyone harassing them as raiders in character. Obviously raiders would go after those with more resources, and fallout 1st subscribers meet that category.
---
I agree with you.
---
Glass dome....is that the greenhouse?
---
"Afraid gaming landscape will turn into something mobilegamesque very soon." Honestly what is the difference between dropping $20 on a power armor skin and dropping $20 on candy crush or whatever to play more levels? The atom store being introduced into the Fallout franchise **is** the mobilegames-esque turn for BGS. Its not in the process of changing, its right here in front of you, as you yell at us to spend more money on atoms. Also, "games should cost $150 but gamers are broke," and "you guys didn't buy enough atoms" makes for a very weird argument.
---
Yeah time passes. I’ve made it to Nov 3rd one time. Got off logged back on the next day back at the 23rd
---
Yeah would love to play offline and just build everywhere
---
Yes, I really wish Fallout franchise would just die off. It's been a disgrace. I dread the day Bethesda acquired the franchise. Hope they fuck up Elderscrolls as well so we won't ever have to see their product no more
---
Same here, im just delete fo76 from my ps4 game, better play witcher the wild hunt, would love to play outer world but the price still high in my country
---
What is the TTK abbreviation? Is your railway rifle primed?
---
Hanlon’s Razor
---
You also keep the outfit
---
inbefore Synth Companion 2000 atoms
---
Not everyone plays a murder-hobo like you. Most of the game is focused on resource management and exploration for a lot of players, and 1st alters both of those aspects enough to make it an entirely new game. It sounds like it upsets you that others have found different approaches to the game that allows them to be more creative than "put bullets into face!!1!"
---
Their will always be lazy people willing to pay money for items. Bethesda’s on a sinking ship and they keep adding water.
---
Someone's gotta make up the difference. If you ain't buying the atoms, then someone else will have to. If nobody's buying atoms, then that's subscription for you
---
Man that was fun. Speaking of which outer worlds is awesome, get it on Microsoft's store and you can avoid Epic.
---
I need to have a conversation with my doctor then...
---
How could Bethesda do something so greedy and foolish at the exact same time that OuterWorlds drops and literally grants everyone else's wishes?? How are those fools not getting fired or eaten alive by their own staff??
---
This post should be stickied in the sub.
---
Its all around the same, cant change much from country to country otherwise the State would lose on taxes, as people would just order it from abroad if the difference was to big. I think Hungary has the highest VAT at 25%, most of the rest is between 20 and 23%.
---
When were private servers promised to be free?
---
I dont mind if someone gos and buys it, im mad at bethesda for even thinking about selling a 100$ a year subscription, to a game many people spent 200$ on including myself. I already have to pay for a subscription to play the game at all because of Xbox Live Gold.
---
What happens when you put, say, 2,000 pounds of scrap in the box but then hop to a public server or a friends private server? Can you access the box? Does it show up in your camp while on a public server? Does everything get sent to your stash which would now be way overweight? How did they reconcile this issue moving between private and public servers?
---
I don’t agree with you.
---
I figured if Bethesda are going to make zero substance remarks, I may as well have a crack at it.
---
People supporting scam upsets gamers.
---
Question for you as people have commented about seeing the "Crash while consuming Aid items" (PC and consoles) being back in force, have you experienced that as well?
---
LOL they you add your own not so veiled little attack too
---
We aren’t Racoons we are whales and we don’t fucking care about how you can’t afford anything
---
How is saying “this post is for support” going to be supportive in any way?
---
I think what you should consider, is looking at these posts constructively. Instead of asking 'Where can I pull the wool over my eyes?" you should direct you attention to the direct criticisms being posted here.
---
I will be honest, I loved the game (FO76), and Skyrim, and Oblivion wasn't great in my opinion, but it was my first Elder Scrolls game, and I got kinda lost in it figuratively and literally, but I did play them all for hundreds of hours. There's absolutely no reason for a game to release in the state Fallout 76 did. There are plenty of games that don't crash all the time. It's not a standard anyone should be happy to accept. I won't be buying any more Bethesda games at release price. I might get the used, or bargain bin on sale, maybe if they do turn out to be good, but I will never be giving them full price money again after this shitshow. However much I enjoyed my time in the game when it wasn't frustrating the hell out of me with bugs and crashing. No game should put the player through that shit. And thankfully, most don't.
---
Thank you lol. Not pay to win
---
Omg wow, children please stop.
---
While consuming no, but if I have too many distinct aid items and I use any workbench, it crashes.
---
I don't really care what you think Bethesda 'needs'. This is what they're getting, and will continue to get until they stop with the shitty business practices. The BBC of all places just published an article about this foible and the guy taking the Falloutfirst domain name. That's how far this is spreading.
---
If you don't think that kind of bad PR matters, then there's no reason for you to be here commenting in critical threads. Go enjoy yourself and leave the critical analysis and pushback to people who do care.
---
How is it a scam? 😂 they disclose what you get for what you pay for. Just cause you can’t afford it and are angry about it doesn’t make it a scam.
---
Yeah, the real 'Pay-2-Win' might be in those Atom shop helmets because they don't have the -2 perception nerf! Although, since you can get onr of those for free by getting in-game atoms, it's not entirely so. None of the stuff they added seems problematic, I think the Fallout player base is probably like me: coming from playing the stand-alone games, so not used to paying money for extra content...oh wait, those all had paid DLC! Lol People just like to complain, I think. This is how most MMOs stay afloat and getting new content years after launch. In a lot of ways(like not including an XP reward) this is an even more fair package to non-paying players!
---
I’ve been noticing this a lot with the ones specific to the Grafton Mayor. It’s fucking bad. I mean it’s nice I get the rewards but the atoms are slightly more important.
---
Totally agree with you. But €15,- a month. That’s fucking ridiculous. Including ps plus that’s €25 a month, to only play with all of the features you used to have in Fallout.
---
As someone who has played video games for like 20 years now I understand the hate for these people. They are the reason gaming has become this bullshit microtransaction/ lootcrate/ whale fishery. Their fear of missing out has made the world a little worse.
---
No it's not, TTK means time to kill.
---
You do realize you're part of the problem, right?
---
Continue to support shit practices in the industry and we'll keep getting them. They had every right to be mad at you because you were enabling garbage like that subscription.
---
Also idk if you're new to gaming, but shit talk like that has existed since the very beginning. If you cant handle the occasional dickhead without taking it as a personal insult then maybe multiplayer games aren't for you.
---
I agree. The scrapbox is antithetical to this being a survival game. There has to be scarcity, even if it's easy to get back expended resources, that's the point of playing the game. Going out and exploring and completing event/quests, while collecting things you need in order to keep doing it and survive.
---
Placing items in the world only effects rendering performance if and only if you are 1. Looking at the item 2. The item has a large number of vertices. This game doesn’t have a large level of detail, so it really doesn’t matter.
---
They don't with this bug :( kinda bullshit but legit the only downside.
---
Fallout 76 is full of bad design decisions. They should have kept the basic Fallout 4 gameplay loop and expanded on it instead of replacing it with instanced rng loot. This is a pattern with Bethesda getting rid of fun and properly working systems instead of building upon them and making what works ever better.
---
Interesting bug. You should link a vid it may help.
---
In Russia we often get regional prices (Fallout 76 and AAA games cost about $30 instead of $60), but subscription prices much higher -  $15 per month or $130 per year.
---
I can buy 4 AAA games in Russia instead 1 year of fallout 76
---
I kinda considered it a 'test' before they came up with Elderscrolls version of this. Hopefully, we won't ever have to see that happen
---
Didn't they made it so you get the atoms anyway a while back? I remember how lots of people said they all got a bunch of atoms of various amounts after one patch
---
But still expensive with a additional "service fee".
---
The worst thing:
---
- paying for monthly internet at home
---
- paying a game full price
---
- buying season pass
---
- buying in the ingame store
---
- pay for a additional battle-pass (for reward stuff for games with low rewards like PvP games) 
---
- pay for subscription in games like Final Fantasy 14 
---
- pay to play online on PS4 (PS Plus) 
---
- additional "service fee" like Fallout First for server and stuff
---
So many ways in so many games to throw out money. Just
---
4 downvotes its not a brigade its just a few idiots, im with you I can get into my mind how anyone is able to defend or being fan of a corporation, I understand that you might like I product, I do! Buy being fan its just stupid, plain and simple, at this point in my life I think its not the people fault, but the way a society shape their youth, i was born in a third world country an move to Europe at 21 and maybe that give me a point of view different to any young man or girl born in the heavy corporative and maketing world that is US, its just a guess but im feel bad for people thinking that they need to defend a bussines even when this guys are literaly lying and stealing their money.
---
They don't hate Europeans, they hate *everyone.*
---
They just hate Europeans *more.*
---
It's Bethesda's reason why Fallout as a franchise collapses. One of my most favorite franchises that were close to my heart. And Bethesda axed it with Fallout 4's absolutely horrible written story and world, and FO76 as a whole. 
---
It's because of consumers like you who cave into microtransactions and everything around that garbage.
---
You don't get to play the victim, lmao.
---
But then if they did that they wouldn't be able to sell you a 100$ yearly subscription. (or 12.99 a month.)
---
I agree on some of your points about strategizing what junk to pick up and collect and how that adds some challenge to the game. However... I will say that spending all of the extra time and effort in menus managing inventory is time I wish I could get back to actually play the game. How many times have you or your friends been waiting for someone that is sorting through their junk because they can't fast travel. I hope it will help players experience an online apocalypse simulator, instead of an online menu simulator.
---
I'm 54 years old
---
Just out of curiosity: how many in-game hours do you have in Fallout 76?
---
I understand where you are coming from, but I like that there is an infinite storage place for scrap. I had hit the point where I was avoiding looting junk in the world or off of corpses because my stash was constantly full and I was tired of managing my inventory so much.
---
Since I got the scrapbox I don't feel like I need to be picky with what I loot because I don't worry about junk weight and I have a lot of extra stash space now for other things like legendaries, aid items, collectibles, and event items. For those that enjoy the stash management aspect, it's still there, but much less restrictive.
---
My only complaint is that this should be a free feature available to everyone because it's so game changing. Im hoping that they decide to open this up to the whole playerbase (along with the tent, which could be a smaller version without the stash/scrapbox/instrument for non-subscribers). I would be 100% okay with this, even if it diminishes the value of my 1st subscription.

The 'more room' thing applies more to individual objects. If something is stackable it only counts as one item to the server whether you have two of them or a thousand of them in that stack. The scrap box automatically breaks down all your junk to stackable scrap so you can't store 500 teddy bears in there scrapping those 500 bears turns them into one object (leather) instead of 500 individual items for the server to try and keep track of. Also from what I've seeing other people say here in this group, scrap wasn't originally meant to count against your stash to begin with. They've always intended it to be this way it just took them this long to figure out how to implement it. I don't know that for certain though, I just know what I've read here.
---
I have. I get where people are coming from.. I'd just rather have a small break from all this critisism. Thanks though, I get it.. I shouldn't be ignoring all of this negative back lash.. and I havent been. I respect this community a lot which is why it took me a lot to make this thread today.
---
Same.
---
He hasn’t finished Borderlands 3 yet though.
---
I’m not saying it’s right for console manufacturers to take your money like that, but it really isn’t a problem for 76 or any other game. That’s on Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo
---
There is tons of misinformation. People equate not being able to provide unlimited stash space with unlimited scrap space. People deliberately omit that Bethesda promised 16x more detail for distant terrain and try to spin it that Bethesda promised 16x better graphics overall. Bethesda never promised free servers nor local servers, but act like spoiled children now. Hell, people are still drooling about Horse Armor, while it was confirmed that the price was mandated by Microsoft. And don't get me started whenever someone mentions Obsidian. Even Obsidian themselves admitted that THEY screwed up the development, but people keep blaming Bethesda because BeThEsDa BaD.
---
Seriously, there's tons of fake info flying around, because the outrage crowd doesn't care about facts. They care only about the narrative and for that the end justifies the means.
---
You are a saint. Worked like a champ!!!!
---
DemonGroover you seem to be struggling from a lack of logic condition. You paid for Fallout 76, this is a subscription to certain perks. If you feel you are entitled to these additions to the game I bet you also feel entitled to welfare. Now I am not saying welfare is a bad thing but feeling an entitlement to it well that is another story.
---
I heart u too
---
&lt;3
---
No. I try and keep my outrage proportional to what they’ve done. They shouldn’t have released scrap box. That’s clear. I’m not going to quit over it. I’m also not going to buy it. 
---
Y’all act like the killed your first born child or something.
---
Tell us of the days to come, brother.
---
This isn’t always the case, especially with the reputation the game has already built.
---
From what I've been reading apparently everything over $100USD is some sort of VAT tax that's being added by your government. It's why the European price is different as well.
---
&gt; 16x the details
---
stands true for long distance detail, never stated to be anything else
---
Blame your government for charging you VAT. The other part is from currency fluctuations.
---
Ammos and stimpacks should weight 0, just like in Fallout 4
---
Microsoft didn't. Out of spite of the Epic store they have started bringing there games over to Steam. It was on Obsidian.
---
Hmm, weird. I wonder what caused it.
---
No not this. We're paying nearly 50% extra. No vat on the planet is 50%. Most countries have it at around 20% and we pay a lot more than 20% more.
---
Ofc I know that Why'd you think I feel sorry for the Devs. I wouldn't want zeni or Beth as my former employer that's all. Seems no one got the point I intended but whatever.
---
I just want to see the 0 damage hit markers fixed for it. You can shoot someone square in the chest, get the hitmarker and a 0 will pop up.
---
Agreed, a solid 15% of my playtime has to have been in menus.
---
The battle of mmo vs private coop. There are people who love one but not the other and those that are fine either way. I bet if there were a vote before this game ever was released and the question asked. Do you want a mmo FO76 or a small coop version of FO76? I bet the later would have won. I'm not saying either is right or wrong, or player choice here is right or wrong. It goes back to Skyrim, I think more wanted to play coop with friends (w/mods) and then we got ESO. That said many love ESO. It really is targeting different players, what they are doing here is good and bad, choice is good, splintering not so much. Oh well.
---
Except we pay almost 50% extra on this subscribtion, while the vats are 20%. Where do the other 30% magically come from?
---
Does that include inventory management or farming legendary weapons before chits? Does it include literally working within a video game expecting end game content? If not probably 10 hours. Bethesda has literally shown us how much we are worth with atoms, it's so convenient. Doing the math I received about 6.47$ worth of enjoyment from the game.
---
No one said you can’t have an opinion.  
---
In fact, last time I checked, you don’t need to even own the game to have an opinion on it!
---
But, $100 a year doesn’t give me any more of an impact on the game then someone who doesn’t.
---
$100 a year is me getting things (none of it pay to win, quite contrary to people’s assertions otherwise)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmdqde/day_1_on_a_private_server_why_theyre_more_p2w/
---
With your own personal server, you get free range on all resources, workshops, and legendary enemy spawns. So yes, it kinda does give you access to items that affect combat. 
---
But mostly, my issue with it is the following:
---
Bethesda said they couldn't have infinite storage space because of server stability. I get why this is different for scrap vs a bunch of randomized legendary items, but still.
---
It could potentially crash the market. If you can start a server up and grab all the resources, stash an infinite amount of them, then the market will suffer.
---
Yes the way you described it makes sense. Thank you. However, ESO plus is something that I've consistently compared the Fallout 1st membership to, and have highlighted the fact that no one seems outraged over ESO plus even though it's relatively the same deal for around the same price... I'm not going to argue that FO76 wasn't generally implemented poorly but as long as ALL DLC is free, I don't care if they charge for other things and I will always push back against what seems like an inconsistent application of outrage...THANKS AGAIN!
---
Sorry, on XB1
---
Wastelanders is free... they have been explicit in that.
---
Oh man! gotta love that its 1 day since the launch and we got some meme potential, I loving the game (the name that we cant speak here)
---
im will put paper bag with spoiled food near every scrapbox i found. shit happens.
---
Well you may not like this but I had to do it in a paid private world because that’s the only place that never let me crash after just a few hours. The future was nice if you paid for it
---
I've used them to snap to the roof walls to make connections for atypical roofing situations, not sure how else to explain it. I've only been able to get them to snap to the wall roof pieces(right triangle shaped pieces). I've also used them to make walls for places where actual wall pieces won't snap in at, but the wall roofing pieces will snap into, like where part of the world is overlapping my build. I've had a few camps where I built on the side of a cliff and had stairs, those pieces are useful for making the sort of walls to enclose stairs. It seems like the same pieces used to snap a bit differently in FO4, where they let you close in your open-air builds with them at the ends.
---
Go under "Transaction History" and under "memberships", wait a sec for it to pop up
---
Fallout 1st. You deserve it!
---
Get a shitty costume. You deserve it!
---
Get a scrapbox that eats your items. You deserve it!
---
Get a tent that crashes your server. You deserve it!
---
You could play FO4 if you want to play alone, but you can also pay for playing solo. You deserve it!
---
All that for one year for only 2,5 times the price of an AAA games Season-Pass that lasts forever. You deserve it!
---
Yeah, they’re gone
---
You two still on PS4? If so, I'm lvl 110 and I'll be ultra glad to help you both, sadly my mic has been broken for two weeks now :(. But don't worry I'll help you somehow :D
---
PSN: Weezunder.
---
Have a wonderful day together &lt;3
---
Nah, they lifted the ban recently.
---
That’s quite alright! Thanks for taking the time to reply, if only cross platform was possible.
---
Whoa, 20 years!?....looks like we have a legend here.../s
---
I haven’t played in awhile but I think I have the set....my gamer tag is English-Jim
---
Anyone with the plan learned can make it for you, often people will sell them for 300-500 caps in their vendor. I'd help, but am on PC!
---
Every game they’ve ever released has been broken! We were just more forgiving because they were singleplayer and ultimately good experiences with decent to great DLC (minus Oblivion ofc lol) and endless mod potential. Then this piece of shit releases as a broken multiplayer only game. So you don’t own it, you don’t own your save game, you can’t mod it and the DLC? Well how would you like to spend the price of Far Harbor on a silver power armor paint? Or better yet! Pay for shit ripped from previous games! Any forgiving nature a lot fans had has sailed. I’m amazed that there are stragglers still defending them, their practices, their monetization and their lies.
---
I do believe that had they simply only allowed the boxes to be used in private servers and locked those characters using them into private servers perhaps they would have recieved less backlash. Or at the very least had wastelanders dropped as scheduled but they pushed the membership and the damn box anyway (or maybe zenimax did) and got caught with their pants down again. Idk if it is Bethesda or Zenimax pushing these things but whoever is in charge of this hopefully they figure it out before all possibility of regaining lost fanbase is gone for good.
---
I'll ask around my community, see if snyone can help you out!
---
Hackers in this game can do anything. They try to act subtle in adventure mode but you really gotta visit NW to see how plagued this game is. I tried to report them but they still play till this day. Funny thing; when I try to report them nowadays, they just close my ticket without a response. It's not the bugs that really bother me, it's the cheaters and Bethesda's reaction to them
---
Bethesda and Bioware used to make my favorite games.  Now they make disappointments.
---
It's like they forgot that making immersive, fun games is what built their companies, and they put $$ first and fun last.
---
In the words of Field of Dreams, "If you build it, they will come."  Build a dang good game like you used to, and people will pay for it, rave about it, and more people will come to the table to buy it.
---
They are trying to sell fast food games for gourmet prices.
---
I use to be a big gamer, but the more gaming companies become hit and runs, the less I find myself being drawn to it.  I buy less and less, and even free to play doesn't appeal to me much, because they aren't fun to play.  
---
Without the fun factor, I am not interested in shelling money out.
---
It even does say it too, capitalized, and bold "RENEWS EVERY MONTH, CAN BE CANCELED AT ANY TIME" or "RENEWS EVERY YEAR, CAN BE CANCELED AT ANY TIME" depending on which option you're looking at.
---
Yeah man. I have the plans. I would have just crafted you a few. Its just cloth, and maybe some other dumb stuff. Lol.
---
You're absolutely correct. Part of the problem here is their engine is poorly implemented.
---
Fully agree. These assholes who attack other people are miles worse than the likes of Bethesda. I'm mad at Bethesda, but these insensitive morons are driving me away from protesting, because I don't want to get associated with them.
---
It's noone'a business to care about what other gamers are playing. Why is it that monetization is the only aspect we should care? Why don't we care about gamers who play games made by companies who abuse their developers? Like CDPR? And what about game genre or features? Are we allowed to harass sport game players, if we don't want sport games made? They are also "enabling" games someone doesn't like...
---
I’m no expert about this, but if that’s true, then maybe people just got his comment confused with overall graphics. The meme just came from how much uglier the game is than 4 maybe?
---
You're looking for private division not obsidian
---
These trolls only want to hear that people hate the game.
---
"We understand that some players are upset, **but**"
---
Followed by "based on community feedback, we will be introducing Survival mode servers, available with our exclusive Fallout 2nd subscription for just $21.99 a month!"
---
I love the reflex sight
---
A lot of mine does. Bandolier perk and a at least one of my armor items also reduce ammo weight. I know for certain .38 and .45 ammo weighs zero for me, I'd have to check which others are also at zero. I don't use .38 ammo but having it weigh zero allows me to carry all of it around until I come across some lucky person right out of the vault.
---
Private servers cost money in any game.
---
lol I’m not broke
---
This post isn’t suddenly good now that you moved it to a different sub after getting clowned on for being a cringe wizard
---
I didn’t even know about the spear comments. Spears with the imperials in Skyrim, what a missed opportunity
---
just call them children
---
I wish i could help but i'm on PC. However, head to this location  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Halloween\_costume\_witch?file=FO76\_Halloween\_Plans.png](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Halloween_costume_witch?file=FO76_Halloween_Plans.png) and find a corpse, it should have the plan to make both hat and dress. Keep in mind it's a random encounter, so server hop until you find it
---
Damn I forgot about that F
---
Imagine a group running around, beating up people with the ranger armor with protest signs.
---
They’ve done nothing to acknowledge the people who paid full price before the sell two *weeks* after launch, why start now? Haha
---
I'm hoping for like a bigger variety of sales. The random item idea was cool, I was disappointed that they had to remove it.
---
An idea I had was a once or twice a year, one day event, where we can turn in a greatly increased amount of scrip legendaries. Call it Stash Cleaning Day or something.
---
It can possibly affect the trading community as each item can cost more caps/5.56 ammo to trade and the ones with the scrap boxes can hoard more lead to create the currency.
---
I brought this up a few days ago in my post 3 queens in a row she did not have a star rating
---
I end up spending because this game has no end to shitty legendary weapons and armor that go directly to scrip.
---
Yea I noticed something like this also. There were like 12 high level players congregating at whitesprings station, so I fast travel there to investigate whats going on. Everyone is just standing there messing around. One guy shoots at me and my health goes down a bit and my character makes a grunt sound. The dude stops shooting at me realizing what happened. Im usually it pacifist . But I left because I had some junk on me and didn’t wanna risk losing it.
---
The advantage I see is unlimited scrap resources. It's a major convience thing. It doesnt have a huge impact in gameplay but frees up some time from inventory management.
---
I wouldn't get a subscription until level 100+ myself. I am subscribed myself and  really happy with the decision. Being able to hoard scrap is kinds my thing so it improved my time.
---
Thanks :)
---
Where are you getting 50% extra from?
---
If the person above is correct (I don't know current conversion rates) and $100 is £77 then with VAT that is £92.40
---
ALL digital sales do the same thing where they will add VAT and then round up to the nearest round price point for their store. This quite often gives the appearance that all the store has done is changed the $ to a £ sign.
---
It is the same with all digital sales like these on steam, the appstore, xbox live, ps4. I've seen people complaining about the issue on mobile games to DLC and season passes on console.
---
Your the only one with a dirty mind like that I just thought rose was one of the more interesting characters that we should have more story with in the future
---
What the hell are you talking about? Microsoft owns Obsidian you twat.
---
You're welcome friend
---
Underdog2020 my buddy and I run 3x nukes and encrypted events daily as well as farm high xp areas
---
I noticed the plans in vendors lately. The spawn by dyer is how I learned most of it. I bought the skeleton costume plans in a vendor, but the rest were from bodies. Civil war actor, used to jump the spawn up by Charleston station (robot vendor can spawn by there). Link to the costumes if you want them to wear [https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1916](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1916)
---
You act like the game has drastically changed in 8 months. 
---
Let's be honest here.
---
Thanks for explaining. I feel bad for bethesda's fans.
---
From Oblivion to fallout 4 I was blown away by their games and I look bed them.
---
It is so disturbing and sad to see them shit the bed so bad. It seems on paper this game could have been fun, but it changed so many things of their past success it's almost like it couldn't have been as successful. I just wish they could take responsibility for this blunder and move on, but they keep doubling down and their loyal customers keep paying the price.
---
Hoping Elder Scrolls doesn't fall with it.
---
At the moment, the complete sniper build can 1 shot anyone regardless of drugs/armour/hp values from full if using a scoped lever action while hitting a head shot (2 shot otherwise (1 shot body with wood armour)). The only way to survive a head shot is to use the suppressor perk, alongside dodgy, while running bufftats/defensive DR (basically you need to sacrifice 4/7 card slots). 
---
This build is quite popular amongst players with good aim, though given the ease that head shots can be landed at range on targets, it can be a bit of a duck shoot. I have died to it before and it is not a hack. Just a case of whether this build is too strong or not, which I tend to think it is given that there is very little counter-play long to medium range and the handling of the scoped lever in close range is really good. Your best bet without that specific build I mentioned above is to use a stealth boy and get behind them. Most close range gunfights can be won, though of course you always run the risk of being 1 shot.
---
Did he say long distance detail during the presentation? 
---
What does that mean either way? When I played it, stuff in front of me wasn't loading up, nvm long distance
---
Lod?
---
I wish the mods could sticky this post to the top :(
---
Second Wastelanders trailer huh? Exclusive and free to Fallout 1st members or 1800 Atoms for everyone else. You’re welcome! /s
---
You'd have a much better chance of buying one on the marketplace.
---
He doesnt hate it, I dont play it and like to see people like you defend it, lol.
---
I’m hoping so too. Just got the Fixer plan. I don’t need much, just a bloodied, explosive, 90% weight reduced one.😆
---
lol yeah I guess I still remember when they were hurting enough to ask their fans to crowd fund their last two games. They're just another studio that got absorbed by a big corporation now. Wonder if Microsoft hadn't bought them out, would they still exist or would they have gone under?
---
Nothing I can’t do with a few server hops at Tanagra, West Tek, and Lucky Hole. A few mule characters and I now I basically have an infinite stash thanks to making friends while doing PvP on the way.
---
But no one wants to hear that. Everyone just wants to cry about how it’s possible to pay for it. Good luck and have fun hopping between workshops shooting Molerats for that “premium P2W experience.”
---
There are so many other broken mechanics that people can exploit and people wanna talk about crap you already get for free as if somehow FO1st changed the game. 
---
It didn’t, you just suck and maybe the game isn’t for you.
---
Gamers seem to be glutton for abuse. I look at it as cult level brainwashing at this point except they aren't doing anything outside of poorly written PR to convince you. So I'm pretty baffled how this scam keeps on going
---
I don't mind paying a little to see the game make it to the future! Lol
---
There was this guy that wasted to start a mass lawsuit over Fallout 1st. You might want to contact him
---
I’m PS4 and I’ve been putting the witch and skeleton in my vendor for free all week. I can make her a couple of costumes and hats, just in case she accidentally scraps it. At the beginning I spent hours and hours trying to get that outfit as I really wanted to be a witch. Think it was the hardest outfit I got. If either of you want to add me it’s o0hopem0o
---
Time to kill, thanks. Yes, it’s all about rapidity and placement for PVP.
---
"trashing the game because you want it to do better..."
---
that's not a very healthy relationship Dynamic and that isn't how you go about encouraging results. In business- your best customer is the one paying and not the one who complains about everything because they want a bunch of free shit . That's who you are, that's who all the screaming whining millions of Bethesda waaaaa posts are. Just crappy customers who don't know who to act and think anyone gives a fuck about what you think cause you spent money at the store one time.
---
  meanwhile, you've got loyal customers who are fine with your product and your offerings. You announce some features and they eagerly pay. They regularly visit your store and shop. No hassle no fuss. If you want your business to succeed; that's the customer you focus on. That's the customer that matters. Your regulars. That's the customer you connect with and send surveys too , monitor their data to see how they use the product and what you can do to better cater to them. That's the customer who keeps the lights on and puts food on the table for the grunts actually working and coding not just some corporate shill at the top. So fuck all you entitled suburban kids shitting on a great game. People worked hard on it and you should all grow up and learn to send a god damn email and go protest in an organized fashion. You look like a bunch of maniacs just saying the same thing. over and over and over. Trying to one up each other like some stupid limp biscuit session.
---
You hate the people that finance your  content updates ?
---
Nice one dude.
---
I just don't get why you see any value on this transaction.
---
Me too. Lol. I've only been playing a couple months and actually hadn't been to the purveyor before the sale. (I'm one of those people that creeps through every corner of a game so I hadn't crept that far yet because the map is so huge) I had just over 700 scrip saved up. Spent almost all of it on three star legendary armor pieces at 50% off and only got three pieces worth keeping.  That return ratio has me really gun shy about buying things at full price. I guess if I had seen full price first then the sale would have just made everything seem really cheap,  since the first time I saw the prices they were at 50% off, now that they're at full price it seems really expensive and I'm too cheap for that. Lol. I will just continue to hoard scrip until the next sale or until I have so much the prices don't scare me anymore 😉
---
Disgusting seeing people try and defend this. Are you guys being paid by Bethesda?
---
"Replicate faction-based story"
---
I don't think that is true, because all Elder Scrolls games have this too and those are amazing.
---
I personally think microsoft should consider buying the franchise so obsidian can work on it again.
---
And then let bethesda focus on Elder Scrolls again
---
Let me just try and contain my excitement for a second... THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! No worries about the mic as mine works plus we can always communicate by emotes! I will be off work at 3PM today so I will send you a message around then, my PSN: bigslothdubs .
---
🤣🤣
---
Clear your cache make sure your console has good ventilation all round
---
Better yet, bethesda can you remove pay to win mechanics?
---
It def does have good vent
---
The fact that they aren't makes this even more embarrassing.
---
To play a little Devil's Advocate here, it's not "zero value." The value of Atoms is completely artificial created by Bethesda. 1,650 Atoms = $16.50 or "$16.50" worth of in game currency a month. While that technically automatically makes it worth the "$12/mo" or $99/yr" right there., in theory at least.
---
So with that said, obviously the entire thing is a slap in the face for everybody here and everyone who has owned the game since BETA
---
Well the servers were down for too long so I switched to FO4 lol I don't know what everyone else was doing.
---
Also, if what affects performance are individual items. Why they don't do something about all the hollotapes and notes from quests? In Fallout 3, for example, they were saved in a different menu and you could read/hear them when you wanted, without having the object in the inventory. Adding this would decrease the amount of items in the Stash.
---
I never expected them to be free. I didn't expect this half assed attempt either.
---
Oh boy look at you repeating rhetoric. Have fun with that.
---
And people wonder why the world is almost literally burning at this point, with areas of the world no longer are inhabitable as the temperature has raised too high for most forms of life on earth.
---
But it's okay, because you get to buy all your luxuries for cheap off the back of child labor from other parts of the world and you dont have to think about it at all right?
---
Awesome! It’s really nice to see the community reach out like this over something like a costume so I gotta say thank you I appreciate it! I’m off of work at 3PM today so I can send you a message later when I’m off.  PSN is Bigslothdubs .
---
It’s not pay to win. Grow up.
---
I had it crash(well completely freeze) the other day on PC after taking an Aid, was before patch 14 though.
---
Not sure how recent you were talking, but I checked out ESO after the Morrowind release. In the crown store was the dark Brotherhood questline for sale for 2000 crowns (probably translated to $20 usd at the time). I unlocked it because the Morrowind edition came with 2500 crown points. This dark Brotherhood bundle came complete with its own unique outfit, and the *worst* quest I've played in a long time. Consisted of entering sneak mode and tapping "A" to kill enemies. Had all the depth and skill a preschooler would need to complete it. Also sunk in about 20 hours free roaming, and while it was a pretty game I never died. Not once. Not for lack of trying, I ran my dumb nord warrior head on into every fight, but the combat was so stupidly easy I would have had to deliberately tried to die. Overall was extremely unimpressed, ended up uninstalling to make room for 76. So far as where 76 will go with this? Probably gonna be "unlock Brotherhood of steel quests for 2000 atoms," "responder companion, 1500 atoms," and a sprinkling of more exclusives for the fallout 1st subscribers.
---
Actually Skyrim engine do support spear animations but Bethesda was probably just lazy again: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHaxiqlAQ8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHaxiqlAQ8Q)
---
"It works unless you do this incredibly common thing, then it doesn't".
---
Any source on making the game more "stable"? 
---
Fallout 4 online is broken and has broken the goodwill of the fans. Every game they get more and more lazy. If it wasn't for modders covering the holes in their games they never would have survived this long. They've crowdsourced their job for far too long and showed their distaste for the people who actually do their jobs with the creation club disaster and everything else they do.
---
"Stable" shouldn't be used to describe anything Bethesda, particularly Fallout 4 online.
---
Thanks Jim! I will reach out if things don’t go as planned with the others, I’m always up to make some friends along the way.
---
They didn't give us unlimited Stash, only unlimited scrap storage, which is significantly different from a server load perspective, and limiting the number of players on a Private server also helps.
---
My concern at this point is what happens when 20+ FALLOUT 1st players get together on a public server.
---
Look, man, I enjoy FO76 too, but these posts are getting a little old - every time I see a post like this, the OP is like 'Well, they need to make money, so I get it.'
---
Bethesda Gaming Studios may have lost money on Fallout, but their shareholders are fine.  I'm sure they're feeling pressure.  But the snafus with almost everything having to do with this game have hurt them far more than the 100mil they sank into it.  They've lost the goodwill of the players.  The canvas bag snafu, the $80 bottle of Nuka Rum that wasn't a real bottle, the 'misstatements' made from the beginning by the development team - I could go on, in fact, I *have* gone on in other posts about this.  
---
We all get that they need to make money.  But continually screwing over the players from the start sent the message that this game is a money grab, as much as you and I may enjoy it.  And then, the smaller issues that have popped up over time have been blown out of proportion because - you guessed it - Bethesda had already sent the message that they're willing to screw over their supportive community with cheap gimmicky money grabs.
---
No shareholder of Bethesda is hurting.  People who invest in things like this tend to diversify their portfolios.  They may not be able to take an extra trip to the Caymans this year based on their earnings from Fallout 76, but at this point, Bethesda would do better to forget profit on this one, fix the game, pacify the community, and turn the game into something attractive to buy.
---
Personally, I'm a lifelong Bethesda and Fallout fan, and this entire 76 debacle has taken me from loyal fanboy to 'I'm not sure I trust this company anymore, so I'm going to wait to play their games until I see that they are quality.'  
---
You guys aren't the only people who realize that Bethesda is taking a bath on this game, and needs to recoup costs.  However, any smart investor would know that even if you pick up a little profit with money grabbing nonsense, if you piss off the entire community that's waiting for your next game, and the one after that, you've screwed yourself.  They need to be thinking about reputation right now, not profit, if they want to continue to be successful.
---
All help is always appreciated so thank you :)
---
Ive been playing since the Atari days? Am I legend too?
---
So you're saying you don't make ammo or repair weapons and armor with any scrap materials?
---
They been broken for along time
---
Type up a demand letter for a couple thousand, list cost of game, time spent acquiring and installing the game, punitive damages (cuz its Bethesda and every judge and his brother is going to hate BGS right now just like the rest of humanity) and damages suffered from agony and boredom during times spent trying to enjoy the game, pretend to be a law office, print off a fabricated cover letter, fancy styled legal sized envelope, mail 1st class certified to Zenimax. 
---
Bet theyll just settle without even reading the letter if it's under say, $5000. They KNOW their game sucks absolute a$$, they're probably scared to even try defending it in a courtroom.
---
A tad off topic but when I logged into today I was surprised to see a couple of new players come out of the vault, i wonder what they will think if they came out of the vault only t be met by a protest.
---
That's my question.
---
That can happen. When a server has been up long enough it goes into a shutdown state. No new players can join except from through friends, after a couple hours it shuts down completely.
---
It all counts, I'd say. That's all a part of the game as designed to be played. There must have been something compelling enough to keep it engaging for all that time. Still, even if we're only counting the 10 hours as 'play-time', $6.00 an hour for interactive entertainment seems more than reasonable to me—but I do realize my opinion isn't shared by everyone.
---
After about ten hours servers stop adding new people. It's possible you got in near a server's end of life span. But it will stay open as long as you're on, and people can still join on you, just randoms won't be put in this world. However I don't doubt there was a lot less people playing, but my friends list was pretty full. It's funny, the first night of First almost everyone on my friends list was on private servers. Last night it was pretty exclusively public
---
There is no reason for SONY to do crossplay. It would take away their competitive advantage. They want people to buy more PS4s, not be able to buy any console.  
---
That’s the same reason Microsoft didn’t do crossplay last generation. They only talk about it now because PS4 is outselling Xbox big time.
---
Don’t think it was supposed to be serious
---
Hi. I completely understand the pain of trying to get the plan. At the beginning there was no player vendors so seemed like an impossible mission.  I’m UK so how many hours away is that, just so I know to be online.
---
It was beautiful, man. I was able to main Meta Knight throughout the entire run of Super Smash Bros. Brawl without an update and never had to press a button other than B.
---
You clearly don't know what an anti-hero is.
---
Yes actually. A lot of other things have been annoying or not cool but have not been a big enough deal for me to consider not playing. I'm not a "rage at Bethesda" type, so I hope people like me who have been fine up until now really sends them a message.
---
Let's do simple math. 90*1,20 = 108. That's still 12€ more than the US with VAT.
---
You are the cancer who is responsible, you deserve the blame. Useful idiots who are rocketing shitty practices into common occurrence
---
What do you define as broken for this game? I was able to play through and have fun. Doesn't seem all that broken to me.
---
\&gt; One is slapping democracy in the face. 
---
As if there's anything wrong with that.
---
Why keep defending this game? Do you play with your eyes closed?
---
Haha so I've heard. Guess all the people who said, "Another $100 for a broken game" were right too!
---
Well I said said like him. And he was good. Or wanted/tried to be. And yeah. He was framed. I guess. But he went with it. So like maybe Bethesda is unintentionally at least, going with how fucked things are. And others will band together in the knowledge that. You can even be something like Bethesda. And still end up like ea. So yeah. I'm sticking with what I said.
---
All of their MTXs are pay2win.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
put 'fo76' in request, please 
---
got the fallout first subscription in case you people want to explore and loot, might find yourself a (witch) costumes in one of my vendors
---
That's not what I am saying...
---
There's enough scrap/junk out there that having a "private world" does not offer an advantage.  Whatever scrap/junk you need for repairs and ammo can be easily and quickly collected en-route during a gaming session.
---
If you need to make a lot of ammo - then most players go to Lucky Hole Mine to collect lead (which is instanced).
---
Oh that gives me hope then
---
At random times, a reload can break your prefix damage bonus for some reason. If you’re crouched, it prevents this bug for some reason.
---
That would be awesome.
---
Come back and let us know your opinion after you finish it really quickly and realise that the game barely has any content
---
They said all content would be free.
---
Don’t give them the idea lmao
---
"Improved a lot in communication," I guess going radio silent and not engaging with customers technically is an improvement over lying to them. "Put out a statement they were expanding mtx." Ah yes, from the original "There will be no paywall or subscription fees, atom shop will be strictly cosmetic items not affecting gameplay" to "Well we figured people would buy it, so I guess to hell with that previous statement."
---
I like this idea, but now imagine we could have vendor bots that wander from our camp and into the wastes. Maybe share a sales inventory with your vending machine.
---
What do you mean I'm defending the game? I enjoy playing the game if that's what you mean. I do not at all defend Bethesda for what they are doing with it.
---
It's actually more pathetic that **this** qualifies for newsworthy.
---
You got it Owl, I’ll make sure to put “fo76” . Thanks for reaching out.
---
You very well should feel guilty, you are the reason these shitty practices exist and why Bethesda will continue putting out terrible services
---
...you guys know todd isn't involved with 76 right?
---
Look, I'll try and make this real simple. Todd doesn't have any power over Bethesda's financial practices. As you just said, he's a director, not a business man, so while I know it's hard for simple-minded folk like yourself to not have a scapegoat, I think you should understand that Todd, most likely, isn't to blame. I also don't know where you got the idea that I'm a shill, seeing as I never defended Bethesda, but whatever.
---
Why todd??
---
Why does nobody want the ACTUAL guys in charge of fallout 76 to answer for this? Todd doesnt work on it.
---
"It didn't happen to me, so it doesn't happen" Is the epitomy of a stupid comment. FO76 is shit, always has been shit. You can literally go to youtube and find a compilation of all the fucking bugs this game has had. You're straight up lying if you're saying that you've encountered 0 bugs while playing 76. 
---
Anthem is also shit, poor optimization again, bare minimum product shipping out the door. Oh boy, you can fly around the giant empty map, shooting the same 3 enemies, over and over and over and over, with the promise of them improving the game that will never come to pass. OH BOY.
---
They made 1 bad game and suddenly they're a trash company who lost their way?
---
I mean sure. That works too. It just sounded nice in my head with Manhattan. It's not like he was inherently evil. Shit just kinda ended up being that way. Eh... it sounded chill so yeah. I said.
---
Fair use under the parody clause.
---
Just a closing server
---
But I like the game
---
Do you have unstable isotope on?
---
Wow i didn’t realize the extractors have anything to do with reward quality. Sometimes I keep one running and leave the other two destroyed, at the end it still told me the event was a success.
---
I'm so into this
---
Considering the content updates were the reason I stopped playing, yes. This is going to go too far. You will not be able to mod a Bethesda game without paying for individual mods if this is accepted. Do you not get it? We need to put our feet down collectively or this shit will only get worse due to corporate greed. They are willing to RUIN the reputation of their company to please shareholders at this point, they should not have any validation whatsoever.
---
Wish they’d sell specific weapons for 1000 scrip then have three attachments (star bonus) rolled randomly that have vampiric or bloody etc. Tired of getting shite weapons, let me choose, and randomise effect modules for like extra scrip (100) each roll or something
---
Apparently you don’t know how it works 👌
---
You keep the clothing, icon, and you can’t put anything else in the scrap box but you keep it.
---
I left 4 months ago...didnt uninstall.  I was waiting for wastelanders.  I have no gripes about the game. I got 1400 hours of play that I truly enjoyed...just got bored that's all.  For me, 4-5 star weapons/armor with tougher bosses would bring me back, but no other game has given me as much fun as this one.
---
&gt; The value of Atoms is completely artificial created by Bethesda
---
Well yeah, that's why I responded like that. It's really easy to say that you get the equivalent of 16 bucks just in store credit every month but if you look at the store you quickly realize there is nothing in there worth paying for. If you could buy 20 different actual new skins and a bunch of other cool stuff for 1650 atoms then you would indeed be looking at something with value and you could be arguing that it's worth it.
---
I don't even understand why the store is so bad. Imagine they sold actual good stuff in there for reasonable prices. They would be swimming in money. Instead they go for the "obvious scam"-approach. Why? Is it so much more lucrative to try and scam people rather than trying to sell a good product? Because I personally love spending money on good products.
---
Not exactly a private server but more of a private session on a server.
---
Sometimes the daily is eat candy tho
---
Yea i love it, it’s the best weapon skin in this game.
---
We felt like VIP’s hitting up the good farming locations and actually finding legendaries.
---
But that lead still needs to be collected and the amount of 5.56 you can hold hasn’t changed. Are people really limited by not being able to hold enough scrap to make ammo?
---
Yeah, that's what I meant. Foundation flush and level up to the door portal, then snap on the wall piece. Panels oversized, but doesn't look too bad.
---
Its a fun game, I dont really hate it. NW was a nice addition. I got bored after the "story". Haven't played in a few months. But Bethesda can't seem to get their s$#t together.
---
How are you guys still here being a beacon of positivity with this shit treatment you're getting? Battered wife syndrome much? lol
---
Yes yes, make it easier to sport the furries
---
The second option would be better. Let people use the control scheme they prefer.
---
Lol. You sure don’t act like it
---
Oh I meant spot
---
Hey man, you should purchase Fallout 76 and Fallout First to everyone you know and ask them to join your boycott. That will show Bethesda!
---
At least they charge you in your local currency
---
Agreed, 100%. 
---
But this post is for blaming those who harassing buyers of the pass, not defending Fallout 1st at all.
---
Could just uninstall tho
---
The silence os very deafening. It’s quiet, too quiet.
---
Lol you have 10 hours in and this bothers you? I have 600 and still finding  new stuff.
---
Pete Hines will probably say he went on “vacation” or some shit when in reality he just shuts all twitter activity down because he knows telling people they lied won’t go over well.
---
I mean, the absolute asshole had the nerve to justify changing their mind about the “cosmetic only” purchases by saying “the plan had to evolve.”
---
Evolve, in this sense, means charge everyone for basic services despite saying at launch they weren’t going to ever do that...
---
Which is just a round about way of saying “we fucking lied because we like money.” 
---
https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1185264327428886528?s=21
---
I finish work in 3 hours. If you still need help I can jump on to help launch a nuke if no one else can help.
---
There isn't a free option. You can play free to a certain level, but most of the content isn't available to you.
---
You can sometimes change servers, but that's only if the server is congested. You cannot move just to join your friend's server. Now, it may be that you can play with people across the data center, but that wasn't always the case, so I'll have to take your word on that.
---
Sure, but why are you charging for cosmetics when you're already charging for a sub, base game, and expansions? Not a huge fan. I appreciate that games like ESO and now Fallout 76 at least gives you currency to buy the items and the sub is entirely optional.
---
Lol please. There is a lag problem. Anytime you play the tower mode or whatever, it lags. Any time you join a dungeon, there's lag. The overworld is fine, but the instances are rough. I have the problem and everyone else I know has the issue. I doubt that it's a North America thing.
---
You're also accounting for the cheaper FFXIV option, which only allows for a single character - no alts. Regardless, you also get literally nothing else for the sub, whereas Fallout 76 gives you atoms. And, once again, you HAVE TO get a sub for the game unless you want to be significantly content locked. 
---
I get that people are defensive about FFXIV because it is a solid game and people can make the argument that it's worth the cost, but I can't get there.
---
I was all about the sub cost. First of all, every game charges for private servers. Private servers are the way that modding becomes a thing, which will be amazing. I know people are pissed about the scrapbox, but the issue with storage has always been a computational one. I can see them offering it as a sweetener for the sub because it's a problem that they want to solve, but giving it to all players would be too resource heavy, so they give it to the small percentage of players who sub.
---
ESO did the exact same thing and there was this exact same outrage and now it's regarded as one of the best MMO's on the market. Bethesda has been down this road before and it worked well for them. If they can provide the content and make the game more stable, they can get there.
---
They were also “explicit” in saying they would never add anything non cosmetic to the atom shop.
---
I've had a few corpses vanish or be un-lootable but other than that 100%.
---
Seems like you just came here to be mean.
---
One of the many bugs that literally make no sense.
---
I was thinking more Fallout meets Borderlands. The art, writing, and humor reminds me of Borderlands a lot.
---
I think the scrap box is also in public servers I think the survival tent can be used in them as well
---
Lol protesting by playing the game? Effective.
---
Fans don't kill games, because fans don't own the game or the IP (although many act as though they do, believing themselves to be the only stakeholder.) Fans inadvertently poison their own communities by failing to see what *is*, by falling into the trap of *should*. "Should" is personal, and stops outside your own brain. Many of the complaint posts contain a line or two about being a fan. What fans turn a blind eye to, is that this is entertainment sold by a company that intends to generate revenue.
---
VPs of Global Marketing don't decide what is and is not going to be a revenue stream *next week,* let alone a year after launch.  It's not these fan's "fault" for succumbing to naiveté, but the cry of "but they promised" is just tedious. Fans got their feelings hurt, because when you're a fan of something, you invest yourself in a very personal way into a person, product, company, etc. When you feel like you're missing out on something, that you feel is private or personal, or when changes are made contrary to your own expectation, the fan MUST manage expectations appropriately, or...well, you see the condition of the subreddit.
---
This is what's real: your personal fandom doesn't count for much outside of your own experience. Sales of the game are slow a year after launch. Player base is solid enough. Players want additional content services, this requires investment, a subscription service is a convenient way to offer a solid ROI, supplemented by the core Atom shop.  Fallout 1st isn't a surprise. Why do you think they offered unique costumes + atoms over the past few months? They were seeing what the market would tolerate. Now you have costume + atom + "private" server + convenience item + convenience item + exclusive content + sales in the Atom Shop for roughly the same price.  I'm not arguing that the ethics, morality, or personal integrity of any stakeholder (fan, dev, etc.)  is more or less valuable than any other's. This simply is.
---
If players want this game to offer additional updates, content, and services, *someone* is going to pay for it, and the simplest answer is: if *you* want it, *you* pay for it.
---
tl;dr Truth is...the game was rigged from the start.
---
Yeah, I get you and respect your opinion. I am so against microtransactitons to the point that I would never buy a game that included any other than purely cosmetic. I was duped and bought a product I never would have if there weren't assurances that ended up being lies.
---
 It's like I bought an apple from the grocery store and found out it was full of worms. I might have taken a bite out of it already but I want my money back.
---
Uh... I respect your opinion though. I dont like need people to agree with me. And wouldn't want them to just do that because. Theres lots of different ways to see and understand things. And I appreciate the point you made.
---
Nope. Hes an alt I'm leveling. Just put marsupial on last night after unlocking starched genes
---
Thanks mate!
---
That is an excellent idea for the *Fallout 1st: Beyond* subscription feature list.
---
I guess I'll keep trying then, if it's really not a common occurrence I don't see a problem in using the weapon, it still kicks ass
---
LOL. The very reason I bought a month. To get the armour and piss people off. 
---
 I probably would have bought F1 if Reddit had not gone ballistic and given me such a rich field to plow.
---
Seriously? Are you and the butthurt DV brigade serious? In light of everything Bethesda and Zenimax have done? Literally create a scatter plot (Google it if you are clueless about regression science) of the elements I stated for the last 4 games.
---
Godspeed to you people. Deny reality to the bitter end.
---
Seems like half of this sub came here to beg.
---
Cause they are using all that subscription money to buy their children real video games
---
Used to think atom shop was the mod they were talking about as it works similar to creation club. Really curious to see how modding gets implemented
---
Implying that Bethesda gives a crap about its fanbase. They know fully well that they can just shit out another TES game that has absolutely terrible gameplay, characters, storyline, graphics and DLC practices and people will still buy it.
---
You sound like my wife.
---
It is. New players, mostly kids who don’t know any better, will see someone has an outfit or hat or something they want, but can’t have cause it was “vaulted”
---
That was the Visit Locations challenges. A ton of them would never check off until they fixed it.
---
I’ve noticed this with my medics / explosive shotgun and it’s only 2* so I dont even have that perk. Sometimes I’ll crit and not get a heal until I switch back and forth between my weapons. Makes you wonder what else isn’t working in the background.
---
Look, you're young. It's okay I was dumb at that age too but when you grow up and daddy stop giving you his credit card for fortnite you will understand the value of money.
---
To be fair to ea(please put down the guns)BioWare had years to make the game and only actually started the last few months before release, they were the lazy ones not the ea executives
---
Rose, MODUS and Grafton asshole are the only unique robots in the whole game lol
---
Maybe they fixed it and didn't tell us?
---
Surrrrrre you did.
---
Furry hunter...
---
He should keep ownership of the domain name and charge them $100,000 a month subscription fee to let them use it.
---
Let's go to...the Whitesprings, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over.
---
 Thanks. My high level just crafted the armour, I'll make a hat too if its useful.
---
 The community cried for private servers for a long time. So Bethesda ponied up and said they would implement that. The community was happy and speculated about the price.
---
 They make it happen and you idiots go ballistic.
---
YAY :D
---
&gt; stuff in front of me wasn't loading up
---
just bump up quality settings / render distance lol, or get a better GPU I guess :s, unless you're thinking of a bug I've also seen myself a fair amount
---
but yes, the very-long range LoD is just that much better than it was in F4, I can see weather, landmarks and nuke zones across at least a quarter of the map, and in the south-east, from the mountains I can see scorchbeats flying around far away (but idk if this one is related)
---
Fallout 76 isn't really related to fallout 76 anymore either
---
Dark Brotherhood was a DLC ( I think the 3rd or 4th they released years ago) not a "questline". The old DLC gets added to the crownshop after it's been out a while so people can use stored up crowns to pick up any old ones they want instead of spending money on it (I didn't really care for it either). I have bought just about every DLC in the crown shop with in game gold. As far as overland being easy, well yeah, it's an MMO overland is always faceroll easy. The difficult content are dungeons, raids, world boss and pvp. All group content because it's an MMO.
---
Good luck! I hope it continues working for you; I've got a VE Minigun with 250DR.... shreds the queen, but end up using 30-50 stimpaks, so I've switched back to my 1 star V Gatling Plasma.
---
Nah, don't be like that buddy. Wastelanders will be free for you, me... EVERYONE :D
---
Are you a Bethesda employee? Do you work specifically with their code and engine?  Because I've seen other games claim this exact same thing.  Are you accusing them a lying as well?
---
Sad to see this sub has gone full r/Fallout in conspiracy theories.
---
If you don't find one , I have a friend that can craft them, we're on PS4. Psn is same as name here.
---
Lol. I saved almost 3k in scrip and the missed the sale. As in was away until monday night...... was hoping sale went to Tuesday so I agree another sale around Christmas or before the new year would be great. Have a good one.
---
They technically already are though.
---
You'll only be able to use mods on Private Servers, and you're only able to use Private Servers by paying for them.
---
What about the people that smoke, they are the reason greedy companies are making cigarettes that ruins people’s health
---
Dang! I wonder how it's happening then, guess blocking and jumping servers is the best option at the moment.
---
only everyone
---
Bioware employees have reported EA always looking over their shoulders as they worked.
---
You’re awesome and your kindness is greatly appreciated, if I don’t have any luck I will be sure to reach out!
---
And now? Need a hankie?
---
The fella who did that needs an award!
---
Does it cost $12.99?
---
That's a choice. Next you're going to say I shouldn't have access to bath salts. You'd make me a dull boy.
---
Thanks!
---
Also, why should Bethesda care if you are playing it or not? They already have your money. If you weren't spending money on Atoms, then whether you play or not does not impact Bethesda in any way shape or form.  There are 200K people subscribed to this subreddit and probably 10 times that number that playing the game. If just 10% of the people who subscribe to this sub buy Fallout 1st that is $260,000 a month (using the US price of $13 a month) or $2 million dollars a year (using the US price of $100 a year). So go ahead and boycott the game, go ahead and play something else, go ahead and post your outrage on the internet, it will not make any difference to Bethesda.
---
They aren’t not the reason and I’m not defending Microtransaction.
---
Go blame the real responsable and learn respect.
---
Not nearly as good as Fallout 1, 2, Daggerfall, and Morrowind.
---
Blizzard would like a word with you....
---
Flair checks out
---
I just wanted to explain what i thought was wrong with the game. Not everyone you disagree with is "farming for karma". But if something major changes and i mean major like Bethesda making private servers free or something i might come back. The change the game needs however is never going to happen if people like you dont stop trying your best to shut down criticism.
---
What does the bug do?
---
Bless this wasteland hero!
---
I've taken your advice. My Peter Panning days are over. Thank you for your cunstructive cliticism.
---
BBC running outta ideas bro
---
And the balance result should be 0 euros, the true value of Fallout Last.
---
"Replace the grind with paying cash"
---
How the fuck is that pay to win when the shit you grinding for do not guarentee you a wun in any form. Buy a champ doesn,t mean pay to win because a silver that buys a champ doesn't mean anything. This isn't like an MMORPG where you buy gear and gives you a competitive advantage buying a champion does not give you a competitive advantage. 
---
"Not moving goalposts"
---
Guy says show him a f2p that isnt p2w and i showcased league. I also mentioned fortnite and what about Warframe. This logic is so dumb, this idiot thinks all f2p are pay to win.
---
Only for consoles, there are a lot of hackers and cheaters on pc
---
If you haven’t found one yet (which it seems unlikely since there are a ton of helpful people already) I’ll just give you one (I think I have a few). Add me - LeeroyJenkins032 - and if we are both on at the same time just shoot me a pm on the ps messenger.
---
I think that’s what the PTS is. Only time will tell.
---
If you think the scrap box isn’t a pay to win mechanic then you take that phrase much too literally. Paywalling convenience is a bad thing and it’s spineless people like you that allow it to happen by bending over and taking it like the good boy Bethesda knows you are. 
---
We know it’s a game, we also know what greed looks like and Bethesda has become beyond greedy. Sorry your safe space was ruined by people who actually have a backbone and stand up to this corporate greed instead of licking their lips like you and asking for more.
---
The way to workaround  the bug makes me wonder if their is some difference in damage resistance , while crouched /while standing. I recall something about sentinel armor not working while crouching. It would be nice to have more transparency about game mechanics.
---
Following. Very interesting concept
---
We live in a TRULY wondrous time, don't we?!?! 👏🏽💯👏🏽💦🍆👏🏽💯👏🏽💦🍆
---
That's not a "Gamer thing" It's called avoiding the question. It's a Yes or No question, so which is it?
---
Considering that people can now store more ammo in the stash box with no junk limitations it could  possibly affect it the economy.
---
Bethesda did faction and branching narratives before New Vegas was a thing, so no, nice try trying to think New Vegas is more important and influential than it is.
---
Ok, but that's because you've spent 400 hours sifting through your inventory.
---
They are not amazing for their faction dynamics or quest writing.
---
Try the cigarette machine they have 0 weight so they hold unlimited weight
---
Personal threats are not cool, having people point out you obviously have a very low IQ is fair.
---
Wouldn't a reference to the 3D model enough, instead of storing it as a copy for every item?
---
Maybe you and I have different definitions of "winning" - but if the reward for winning are purchasable, then it is clearly pay to win.
---
And I suppose I should have specified I was referring to open-world RPGs that are even remotely comparable to 76.  I thought that would have been obvious.
---
This was mainly for folk that didn't decide to uninstall it, but are still pissed.
---
Oh i totally forgot about Todd visit earlier this when he aimed an actual ak47 at me and politely asked if I would like fallout 1st subscription
---
Some world containers can hold more weight. Look for one that says 0/0 for the weight. Your best chance of not losing stuff is to find another 1st member to anchor your world, so you know for sure that youre getting back to where you left your junk. Looks like you are on pc? Ask to find some friends, lot of help people out there. Good luck
---
Fallout 4 is part of the problem. Easily the worst game RPG Bethesda had made to date, then they topped it with 76.
---
5mm is weightless and using a tse gatling meant I had an armory worth of ammo on me. I would throw it at everyone who I thought could use it
---
I prefer to think of them as assholes because that's what they are.
---
I've never seen a daily to eat a Halloween candy, maybe I played not enough to see that
---
Fallout 4 is part of the problem. Easily the worst RPG Bethesda had made to date, then they topped it with 76.
---
Some people just want it easy rather than strategize. My recommendation is uninstall Fallout 76 and install Minecraft.
---
I know it is a crazy system,  but I run two xboxes.  Log  in trade with the 2nd account and do not have to worry about dropping or losing anything. 2nd used xboxes are fairly cheap on ebay or other online vendors. If you only have one tv just hook up to 2nd separate feed. Hdmi 1 and hdmi 2 and switch between characters to trade. If you have two TVs even easier.  Have a good one.

Other than things which have been noted previously in other comments: camps which have objects that are not perpendicular to walls (_crooked_), turrets facing backwards,  power wires haphazardly strung about like spaghetti, an  excessive number of power connectors, wall paintings which _must_ cover as much wall space as humanly possible. Surely there are more, but as these are the major issues they are more easily remembered, and I don't necessarily enjoy dwelling on the negatives.
---
IMO juice always seems to have the fairest assessment of the state of the game at any given point
---
They left some holotapes in their wake tho
---
Soon all the servers will do this. RIP Fallout
---
That’s even worse.
---
&gt; They didn't give us unlimited Stash, only unlimited scrap storage, which is significantly different from a server load perspective,
---
I wouldn't be surprised if, in the future,  they announced  "Fallout 1st Deluxe! Unlimited stash space (weapons, gear junk, everything) for $16  a month! For just 3 dollars more  your stash worries are no more!"
---
Well I can't speak for consoles, I'm a PC gamer, but no, each server would have it's own characters.
---
It's the only way to make things fair when you have mods and such.
---
since the game was announced...
---
You only get 20 atoms for completing the “play for 7600 hours” challenge lol
---
It will be added in patch 15. Only 4.99£ per month.
---
I mean even that isn't true. The story of Bethesda games have never been all that good. The pure freedom and amount of things to do just helped covered that up.
---
It's front page neeeeeews
---
Going down~
---
It should have been like 5$ maximum and the shitstorm would have been less big
---
They want you to pick every single item, and when you are overcumbered, to use a Scrap kit and repeat.
---
It breaks your *primary* bonus on reload, which means Instigating, Vampiric, Bloodied, etc which means you lose the damage bonus/regen. 
---
Explosive is a secondary bonus so that won't break. To bypass or fix the issue, simply crouch to reload or unequip/re-equip the gun. If you crouch and reload, you'll keep the 250 damage resist until you fire your gun or stand up.
---
It's not THAT game breaking of a bug. It's annoying, sure - but I'll happily take an otherwise godly gun at a deep discount as long as people keep treating it like it's cancer.
---
I’m always down to talk about the game even when the sub is flooded on one topic. I think patch 14 is good for unpaid adventure mode overall. Public events are popping up &lt;5 mins after the previous one ended which has made me much less bored with it. Legendary scorchbeasts should’ve always been there so it’s nice to have a reason to go after them now. I wish raids were more rewarding and ran smoother because that’s about the only think I have left to do outside of event hopping.
---
ive come across this issue a few times, ive found that un-equiping your weapons outside of PA and then climbing back in works to resolve it. but the issue pops back up when you use a weapon again.
---
People keep claiming dead or dying, but I’m heavy on the trade groups and added a lot of friends from there. I haven’t seen this many people online since about 6 months ago if I’m being honest. 
---
Hell even I stopped playing for a month or two cause it was getting stale.
---
10+ hours is a big bite, and apples don't require maintenance. I do understand the idea behind the analogy, and company promises. I just think Bethesda is getting too much hate for investing time and money trying to give people what they want, just because people don't want to pay for it. How are they supposed to keep it viable from a business perspective if no one new is buying the game because of all the bad publicity surrounding charging people for a service? For example, based on my understanding, Bethesda is using AWS for the private worlds—meaning everytime you log into a private world they likely spin up a machine on AWS, and then start getting billed for that time. 
---
Really, I'm spending too much time commenting about all this. I just want to keep the game viable, fair, and up and running for years, and hopefully MANY content additions to come(looking at you, Bethesda)! That way I, and hopefully many friends old and new, can keep enjoying Fallout 76!
---
The entire community lol
---
Wasn’t it confirmed that the challenge was only designed to be a time played tracker?
---
Boom, roasted.
---
They popped in to tell everyone to pls stop talking about outer worlds
---
People are complaining because Bethesda lied, telling that all game affecting features will be free and that they cannot increase Stash limit because of server stability, and now you can buy yourself more space for real money aswell as they are adding more and more utility items to the Atomic Shop.
---
😂😂 sorry i have a well paying job and can afford to spend some extra. If that offends you maybe you should make some better life choices, and you could do the same.
---
Im not tryinf to discredit the older games of course. But to me Fallout 3 was definitely special
---
Oh boy I hope one of you knuckle heads really tries suing Bethesda. The amount of salt in this sub after you lose would be priceless.
---
I mean, that isn't an excuse or a defense it just shows the pure cancer mobile has been to gaming overall.
---
Your point would be valid if scavenging for scrap and constantly managing inventory weights were actually entertaining game loops.
---
They arent. Just like how packing my suitcase for flying isnt fun.
---
A big problem is that the amount of stuff you need to stockpile is much greater than the space they give you. And the way you scavenge stuff is boring and it's very gamey. There is too much available material in the game world and zo very little items you can actually pick up.
---
The locations that are plentiful are usually picked dry, requiring server hopping.
---
Scarcity in games is important to making aspects of them work and stay fun, but the way it is implemented is critical for it to be a good mechanic. It's not well implemented in fo76. It feels like work. I already do lots of work.
---
I dunno, all I know is they don’t respect you or your time played if they’re only gonna give you 20 atoms
---
I'm so petty I won't buy anything if that's the case.
---
In a database, every gun that differs slightly would be a new row, but scrap being identical can just be quantity+1
---
I don't know anything about code or how that storage stuff really works from the level that the creators or tech minds would know. But I did always think it was a bit strange that they'd say excess items would cause server instability, but you can hold as much "weightless" stuff as you want. Like couldn't you technically have any amount bobby pins just because they don't weigh anything? Or carry around thousands of those blank holotapes, or any holotapes?
---
ahhh ripping yourself off with a bullshit subscription to own the libs nice man
---
What? You can have an infinite Stash by transfering items from character to character with a help of a second account? Why doesn't everyone own 2 accounts just to have more stash?
---
If you're looking for a sanitized forum, it's most definitely not here. I've not looked myself, but perhaps the "official" forums might be your best bet, as they're likely to be more "pro-Bethesda" than third-party.
---
18-25% VAT.
---
Hahahaha “I don’t need a fridge or a scrap box” because you don’t play this shit, you fuckin jack off
---
I see, is it supposed to happen every reload, or random like they say? I'll have to keep testing, I'm very interested in this one. I also have a quad 250 reload Tesla rifle, but I've been using that for a long time and it never has broken the quad effect, it always reloads with the proper capacity.
---
Aaaand you sir are an example of why this subreddit is a toxic shithole.
---
It doesn’t matter how I feel about BGS, or how you feel about them.  They’ll do whatever they want either way.
---
The game fills a niche in my gaming, so I’m taking advantage of it.  I play with friends, enjoy some relaxing time. 
---
If 12 a month gives me some atoms to buy cosmetic stuff, and I can fill my scrap box to my hearts content...  then I’ll splurge on it as long as I feel it’s beneficial.
---
If that sends you into a rage and frantic flailing - that’s a problem that you’ll need to deal with.
---
Have fun being angry at a video game - some of us have other things more pressing to direct our anger at that actually impacts our lives.
---
Czech Republic has 21% VAT. Certain online retailers do and some don't charge us. Bigger like Microsoft and Valve do, smaller key resellers don't.
---
Scrap should have weight.  You should not have million of pounds of weight in resources. The game is a mix of the old survival mode because it was awesome and made it feel more realistic.  Tou
---
No one is actually going to sue, this is how they get away with it. A 100$ investment being false advertising isn't worth the cost of court, obviously. It's shining a light on the fact that not only is this shitty business practice, it's illegal and we're technically due compensation.
---
Or just remove the spoil mechanic completely.
---
I'm pretty sure I have the plans for the witch hat and the costume. My PSN is damian_13_666 send me an add when you get online and I'll give you the plans if I still have them
---
Creation club. Content brought over. Thought they'll really just make god items and other crap and drop it in the atom shop. 
---
No one from nexus is going to touch this garbage fire.
---
I've never tried that combo. Perhaps there's not a direct route for the second wire?
---
I hope you people realize how lame you look for smugly bragging about paying a corporation for a scam
---
PSA you can rename items with a symbol prefix to do just that.
---
You mean they should reward you for your loyalty??? What a concept!
---
Companies generally care less about their base than they do in obtaining new recruits, which is why there are always more incentives to join, than there ever are to stay.
---
Less time farming scrap/managing stash weight is more time spent actually playing the game instead of doing chores. P2w doesn’t have to literally mean pay to the clear the final boss and roll credits. Paying for advantage means other players do not have the ability to keep up with infinite junk and the ability to infinitely stock your player vending, etc. there’s numerous ways and severity of which paying for an advantage can negatively impact gameplay for others, especially considering this is a full price major studio release, not a f2p mobile game or battlepass freemium game.
---
“They’ll do what they want either way” yeah because people like you follow their will blindly, asking for a deeper wallet fucking and to give you those micro transactions harder. You’re the biggest cuck I’ve ever seen and ironically you don’t even know it. 
---
You’re the reason these gaming companies think it’s okay to release a broken game and paywall most improvements. I loved this game for a long time but too many broken promises led to it getting stale and a big reason is because of inventory management. A totally arbitrary thing that Bethesda could change at any time with zero impact on server stability and yet they paywalled it. Because people like you will apologize for anything they do, absolutely shameful.
---
It's not at all illegal. They can change whatever they want whenever they want. You are due nothing.
---
Its everything I've been craving for the past 3 years and to top it off, its taking a lot of self control to not just play it and do nothing else.
---
Tell me that incompetent fool doesn't take *all* credit for Fallout, Skyrim, Elder, etc. Those are his projects, he makes the decisions. He is absolutely to blame for the murder or fallout and Beth continue to support him. Nothing I said is inaccurate.
---
Simple enough for you?
---
I read that it always breaks it, but I haven't tested it personally. I have a VE 250 dr minigun that seems to break the health regen every time I forget to crouch. Also I don't think Quad is affected by this, only things that do damage or regen health. 
---
Did you lose your bloodied damage bonus on reload?
---
He plays at least occasionally - because some players followed him around while someone else nuked his base: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cfsc54/we_just_protected_a_level_47_private_pete_hines/
---
well scrap boxes having unlimited amounts works just like fallout 4 it still has weight on your person but dump it in your scrap box and there ya go.   scrap shoudnt weight nothing its just the scrap box should be unlimited as i think this system worked fine in fallout 4.
---
Ye, but it is a common price for all of the common EU market, rates vary a bit from country to country, I guess they picked a VAT to apply to all that is above 20%. Maybe they are just taking advantage because they can.
---
It's not a challenge, it's to track your play time.
---
so one herd is a better herd to join than another..?
---
how about.. make informed choices that reflect your own beliefs and experiences?
---
You have no idea about how creation engine works. All that works based on your assumption on how it works.

*me, malnourished, slowly crawling towards Todd Howard’s feet*
---
“Di- did I do good, Todd? C- can I have my atoms? It’s been- it’s been 316 days, non stop”
---
But yeah, I agree, it’s still funny how blatant their disregard for the players is
---
Lmao but not to stop people verbally attacking people that enjoy 76?
---
why are you telling me?
---
I hope so...
---
i didnt know you could scrap food
---
Then why does it offer 20 atoms? And why is it located in challenges?
---
I left a long time ago with the hopes that with a year or so the game would get better. Seeing all this shit happening, I’m never coming back to Bethesda. I don’t care what game they make or what updates this one gets. There is plenty of other things to play and companies that aren’t treating their players like idiots and atms.
---
So you can track your play time.
---
This is definitely why they did it, and I'm assuming the reward is low so as not to encourage people to leave their characters online macroing all day to get some great prize.
---
God the drama, twitter is full of people who have a soy drip going or ate all the lead in the gerbers baby food scandal.
---
 I almost bought a year. ;)
---
In my opinion, skyrim was all about the faction dynamics
---
I wasn't only referring to the private servers, and while it may not be a race to win it still feels like these features will still give the subscribers an edge that everyone else won't have.
---
My country, France, is at 20%. The price is still 120€.
---
If they released the tent and scrapbox to everyone regardless of sub's I'd probably sub as that means they are moving in the somewhat right direction.
---
Bloody well said. Long read, but a fantastic read with very good talking points. For all the TL;DR Peeps, Beth has gotten stupid lazy.
---
So don’t follow the herd but follow your herd? Lmao
---
That brings traffic, while outer worlds sends people away. They’re a business after all, except they make no money and have nothing to gain from modding this sub
---
No one is talking to you. You made the choice to read the title, click on the post and make your shitty, not at all clever, commet
---
 Yes, and there are maybe 7 sets at Camden in the Raider area. That's 54 lead!
---
Yeah it's sickening.  It makes me sad to say it, but the game is just getting continually worse on so many levels.     It's bad enough that they have been  trickling out stuff that should have been in the base game since the day one and calling it "free DLC."  
---
It's not free DLC, it's  just them slowly turning it into a complete game.  They released an unfinished game on day one, slowly complete it over time, and call it free DLC, like they are doing us some big favor. But hey at least it's free.  
---
But now, they are putting something that should have been in the base game since day one  behind a paywall.    That is disgusting.  We need to keep raising hell about this.  If we don't, then this kind of nonsense will become the new normal in games as service titles.
---
not the healthiest approach to the subject, long term people who play 76 will need all sides(subs/ragers/indifferent), the subs will continue to fund the game and the rest to keep populations high enough for BGS to continue keep the server lights on, pitting the sides against each other is toxic.
---
Just look at your character on the main menu and it tells you. It’s totally a challenge with no respect for the players that complete it
---
Yeah, I guess.
---
Robot vendors are picking about the junk you sell them. They prefer bulk junk of the scrap you find. The scrap that can't be bulked should be able to sell to the vendors.
---
Unless you are an employee of Bethesda, or share in profit of subscription sales, then by strict definition you are part of the consumer herd, whether you like it or not.
---
It's class warfare and you already lost. 
---
 Guppies salty they aren't whales. 
---
Goes far beyond gaming.  
---
Quit your bitching. 
---
If your really concerned about these types of evolving business practices perhaps you should devote your time to working on social justice and financial reform and not concerning yourself with a silly game.  
---
I am embarrassed for you.
---
Lolol I’ll probably get a 15 ban again for mentioning that they are shit mods.
---
No. Please dont go with this lawsuit bullshit. If that was true NoMans or Anthem would be deep in lawsuits by now.. stop acting like a know-all because "i think it should be like this so it is like this".
---
He's a lot of fun when you're low level, kind of spooky. You hear him before you see him too.
---
The overloading of adventure mode servers is an issue. The private worlds feel so much better and Im yet to find one with the same menu lag that is so common in adventure mode
---
I think you miswrote that 50% right there...
---
Same reason they do it in games like WoW, to take caps out of the economy
---
In the pip boy I was checking the dmg after every reload and referencing it to a 2* be 50 cal I have with the same mods, It was always the same, so I thought maybe visually it appears the same but when used it's not? Though when I went to shoot down some enemies everything seemed the exact same so I've just been really confused by it in general. I'll check when I play again later and scrutinize the dmg numbers to make sure I'm not missing anything, I just feel like I would have noticed if I lost the bloodied effect, it makes a pretty huge difference.
---
There is only one herd - the consumer herd. If you are exchanging currency for a product or a service, you are a consumer. You are part of the consumer herd. You don't have to follow the herd, but what is good for the herd is also good for you.
---
The _only_ possible way for knowing this might be if you become a spectator of your killer, and are able to recognize the weapon that's being used, otherwise there is no way to know (especially with ranged attacks).
---
Can't you just elaborate on your position without knowing specifics, by citing examples?
---
No. Not simple enough for me.
---
He isn't responsible for the decisions that lead to the creation of 76 so I fail to see how he "murdered" Fallout (why does everyone say it's dead after one bad game, anyway?). And why is he an incompetent fool? He created morrowind (which set the standards for all elder scrolls games), oblivion, fallout 3 and Skyrim, all of which were amazing rpgs and made him the first person to ever make 4 consecutive goty. Even then, I've never heard any one give him credit for the obsidian/black isle Fallouts
---
Still not false advertising
---
They want to control the economy, despite introducing methods that can destroy it.
---
A few things I’ve noticed since I posted:
---
I swapped in Good Doggy for Munchy Resistance in Endurance
---
Use Covert Operative instead of Ninja under Agility (I mixed up sneak melee with sneak rifle)
---
I use Grim Reapers Sprint instead of Critical Savvy under Luck
---
I’m trying to use power armor more, and sometimes carry a Gauss rifle, so I have Batteries Included in there to help with Fusion Core and Gauss ammo weight. If you don’t use those, I’d swap that out for a different card. 
---
If you want to pvp you’ll have to use a few different cards. I don’t pvp so I’m not an expert on which cards but Dodgey under Agility and Serendipity under Luck are good
---
David Chapman looks a bit old to be making ass rape jokes.  I’m not defending Bethesda or anything, but am I the only one who found the style of humor on that site a bit cringe and homophobic? Dude make several references to getting pounded in the ass, I dunno. It just seems like a comment from a teenager in 2005. Like what’s the worst and angriest thing I can think up? Oh yeah buttsex.
---
I dont recall reading anything where the tent will be customizable. I could see something from the Atom shop like the vending machine skins coming along in the future though. Id love the tents to have some faction flair to them!
---
They need a way to stop over inflation like elder scrolls online had with the trading system
---
I'm right there with ya man. This Is a solid game but content creators need easy clicks so that's why they're still bashing it.
---
https://reddit.app.link/u10PWhUz60
---
Lack of a cap sink.
---
This is literally what I do for a living. I am just sharing with you all on what typically happens when consumer interests are threatened.
---
Do you understand how analogies work?
---
Yeah, have experienced the exact same thing with paper bags. Always use a world container whenever possible. I like others have said find somebody to do it for you
---
They literally promised the game would have purely cosmetic microtransactions. They promised that because it is a deal breaker for many people. They broke that deal.
---
PC? If you have the money for f1st, then you could get a second account instead and trade f2f.
---
Yeah. If you play in a group of four, it's unavoidable that frequently someone will go over-weight and hold up the group. There's a fundamental friction between survival limitations and action-packed play with others.
---
Doesn’t work like that man. 
---
Either you had passive mode off, since it doesn’t work when you have it on and they can’t trigger it, or you had a teamate consent to PvP, Or you were in a workshop and they contested it
---
I think I heard the game's on sale currently; there were definitely a lot of new players on xbox last night
---
I fck love you bethesda :D :D :D !!!!
---
Can you explain how in the first few months of the game dupers were crashing servers by just having 1000+ of a single item?
---
I Will be extremely grateful to those who reply.
---
I am waiting to do another run.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Don't mind the children throwing a tantrum about not getting a single specific outfit and denouncing the whole game because of it.  They're overactive drama Queens and they'll have to tucker themselves out eventually.
---
I hope you realize how much of a cunt you are for insulting people who support something they enjoy.
---
Statute of limitations
---
I enter the power armor without weapons equipped and then simply cant put my fists up. Also i can equip a sword, then unequip it then i use the one handed animation with punching worth of dmg
---
I assume you've gone through the EULA and can confirm that it doesn't say anywhere in it that things are subject to change?
---
I have said this before. It doesnt work like that because it's a BUG and I'm not the only one whose had it happen
---
The whole argument is about how it changed to a non mandatory subscription plan. The crux of it doesn't depend on whether it's *free to play* or *buy to play* .   
---
I edited it to include that the argument is divided in parts and altered *free* to *buy.*
---
Just use your tent that fallout 1st gives you anytime your overwieght it has a stashbox. I started puting it down every time i become to heavy and dont want to go back home
---
I mean, I suppose that ***I could blame the players*** if I do desire.  But I don't see what that accomplishes. I don't get to decide how other people spend their money.
---
“Cuck”
---
That explains everything.  You sure you didn’t just wander over from the_donald?
---
It’s amazing how a single word can paint a picture!
---
What you are referring to is at least 10 years after the fact. What is your malfunction? Learn to use Google, this information is readily available.
---
Smart move, should be their official website
---
Yeah, questionable stuff on xBox, too.
---
Last night I shot someone point blank, at least 10 times with a combat shotgun, and I have the perks for extra  shotgun damage, and accuracy/spread...although they wore Marine armor...and while they appeared to take damage as shown by  the floating numbers, their health bar did not reflect that damage as being taken, and then one of their teammates killed me. Yeah, highly suspected shit, indeed.
---
Go to Uranium Fever.  It's about a 50/50 chance you'll either end up with a super cool group who will wait for everybody to tag the supervisors and let them hobble around a little after that or you'll end up with the asshats with explosive heavy energy weapons who will light them up and turn them into ash in a second flat without waiting for anybody.
---
whoahhhh thats crazy man im so angry you almost bought 100 dollars worth of fake items from a corporation that doesnt care about you!!! does it come with a free lick of mr.howards boots?
---
Oh ok. Skins would be a cool idea like Raider or Bos theme. But I would like to at least replace the sleeping bag with just a simple cot nothing fancy
---
What kind of idiot bought 76 in the first place and theen actually believe they will fix it?
---
Am I speaking to Bethesda's legal department?
---
I'm gonna call bullshit on that. I think you're a liar. 11 dollars an hour is not a well paying job. You probably spend most of that on weed too. Shits killing off your brain cells.
---
Got the exact same drop (ok.. there was also a mechanic jumpsuit) form mr. messenger in the mire a few weeks ago. Only the BOS jumpsuit was shown in the reward list. I didn't know much about the masks and was about to scrap them but decided to take a closer look at it.
---
Yeah you’re a cuck, glad you admitted it. Now be a good boy and keep shilling for your daddy, Bethesda.
---
f2p will get wastelanders basic but f1st will get wastelanders premium experience
---
So then, no. You guys are all crying false advertising for nothing. Carry on.
---
Having 1k spoiled food in scrap box will be so op
---
Neither did i
---
But if it's really that bad, maybe they should stop making engines?
---
Isn't it just? I paid $50 for the game and it was and still is full of bugs and issues that they don't fix. Now they want me to pay 3x that for a few extra features that people were asking for from the beginning? No chance!
---
They almost definitely own a majority share.
---
PA does offer some radiation protection, however.
---
That's fucking great
---
So then, yes? I'm legitimately curious if you are from the Bethesda legal department.
---
It was probably me, if you're talking about a comment.  That snafu, as well as the Nuka Cola rum that was just a plastic shell over a normal bottle, they are examples of where the company opted to lower quality and maximize profit.  They want us to forget about it, as they continue to do the same thing in other areas - well, I'm not going to forget about it, and I'm going to remind people of it forever, and if we ALL did, maybe they'd stop pulling the same stunts over and over.
---
you can break bulk junk back down..
---
Nope. Just a guy pointing out how ridiculous you babies sound.
---
What’s the False advertising? Please explain to me like I’m the lawyer you’re going to bring this bullshit to.  What part is illegal please enlighten me.
---
Yeah, currently only $1aud to sign up for your first month.
---
Stranger in numbers perk
---
If Fallout 76 is taking the premium membership from ESO, they should also take the paid yearly expansion model and tone down the microtransactions. The trickle down freemium content model is not sustainable.
---
Maybe he uses jetpack?
---
Last night Outer Worlds was released.
---
Thank you for a well thought-out reply.  It was a pleasure to read and ponder upon.  
---
Did not read your other posts - I might do that now.
---
I am not blind to the problems.  There are enough problems with the game and Bethesda overall without the need to make up problems or blow minor things out of proportion.  "My beef" is with destructive criticism of many posters (on Reddit, YouTube and elsewhere) who misrepresenting information.  Some of them don’t understand the game mechanics and don’t even play the game.  Then this information is proliferated, repeated and is taken as fact.
---
In my opinion, the game got an unfair reception from the start and is continuing to get disproportionately negative reaction to minor things.  Other titles (Anthem for example) were and remain far worse and receive a fraction on backlash that FO76 is getting.  Even with this latest backlash… most posts repeat the “pay-to-win” concept and I simply don’t see it.  Not in the game mechanics, not in the advantages given the alternatives, not with “how-the-heck-do-you-win-in-a-mainly-PVE-setting”…  The “money-grab” argument I am seeing also does not seem to be valid – not with the audience it targets.  Many of the players are mature and can certainly decide whether it’s comfortable for them.  IF examined dispassionately, the advantages offered by the subscription are negligible.  I think most people will subscribe to get away from the griefing and play in a setting closer to a single player game.
---
The way the subscription service is presented (with the “automatic renewal” accent) will effect how the project is valuated (you probably saw that too).  It will provide a reference as to how much effort and money Bethesda will put into the project.  Maybe that’s one of the reasons Wastelanders were delayed – Bethesda is reassessing how much funding and support to provide FO76 in 2020.
---
I get it – the backlash is in great part because of the loyalty to the Fallout franchise and very high expectations and players are upset that the Franchise is now in the hands of a company who doesn’t really care about it.  The game could have been much (MUCH) better with very little effort.  
---
I enjoy it.  Even the way it is now it’s my “go-to-game” to unwind.  And hope that with the additional money they get from the subscription service Bethesda and FO76 team will be able to provide a more enjoyable experience to everyone in 2020.
---
Hey kidshion. I have the same problem. GrimSiege here..
---
 I am having so much fun with you idiots, and the chance to upset you over this ridiculous nonsense, that a few bucks is nothing. Its upsetting you, that is my purpose. Its working. ;)
---
No one is outraged because one is an MMO and the other is a barely supported multiplayer game...

ESO is an MMO that has actual game content and developer support...
---
FO76 is a stagnant game that just gets randomly piddly ass cosmetic shit and p2w items added once in awhile.
---
I bought one full price game last year. I was cheated. It's pretty clear there's a lot of hate surrounding this decision.
---
People paid money expecting to not to be gouged in the future for features that should have been in the broken base game.   
---
It’s akin to buying a car and having the manufacturer fix your broken radio and then charging you every month to listen to it.
---
Found a golf bag right outside the main entrance to whitespring resort, has unlimited storage and so far 3-3 times it has worked. Including one time of doing around 15 weapons.
---
Have you been able to replicate it? If so I’d love to see more about what’s causing it and how to avoid/cause it.
---
You don’t need a friend private world will remain active for almost 5 minutes when empty, just don’t use paper bag as those despawn if there is no player nearby
---
Hate does not equal legal action.
---
No he was not running that when we were playing.
---
remember it just works.... just not always as intended.
---
No he did not have a jetpack just jumping.
---
 Speed Demon is probably to blame.
---
Hahahah, nice to see u here bro, I  contact Bethesda using a  ticket, they told me that it’s Sony side not their side
---
it would be nice of energy weapons made scorch beasts make larger piles of ashes/goo
---
You act like he's some creative genius that comes up with all these ideas. He's not. And for FO4, NV, his only role was to make sure things were on schedule and budget for Bethesda. That's on Obsidian/BI, the makers of Outer Worlds. Todd Howard should have been ousted after the 76 fiasco. He's incompetent.
---
Haven't thus far since it was a one off encounter with a griefer. I'll try and see if I can in a little while after my controller has finished recharging
---
Well that’s the only thing that improves mutations as far as I know.
---
They claimed it would have purely cosmetic microtransactions. It's like paying 60$ for an event that promises an open bar but they change that once you're in the door.
---
I sell daily to vendors for the max caps and my prices in my machines are low so items move pretty quickly... so quick that I have to buy stuff from other players to avoid max caps... 
---
At 1400 caps a day from vendors alone that players can get I’m surprised anyone is cap poor.
---
With no persistence, don't forget that part. What is Bethesda smoking?
---
Can anyone confirm that you can have 2 games running on the same system without doing any type of work around?
---
It works 16 times better.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is the hot pockets of the fallout IP. 
---
When it comes out, it looks pretty hot, but once you actually get into it you find it's bland, unpleasant and completely half-baked?
---
 He's moving faster, it makes a difference.
---
I think the issue isn't that he had the holiday, but that it happened at such a crucial time to the game. Everyone needs a break, but surely anyone in the gaming industry (and many other industries alike) wouldn't take time off just as you're releasing your product. That's got to be one of the busiest times for the company. You've got to manage marketing and PR, initial reviews and feedback, unforseen bugs and so much more.
---
Because it's an MMO that provides content and updates on a regular basis?
---
Why the fuck would you have a problem with it doing exactly what mmos have done for years?
---
The fucking hell is with so many brainlets in this post going 
---
&gt;bUt ItS jUsT lIkE eSo AnD nObOdY cOmPlAiNs AbOuT tHaT!

As someone who came from ESO, this subscription service is almost identical to the one that's there (except this one doesn't give you a 10% bonus to earned experience and caps and comes with a private server) for those of us from ESO it's not a 'follow the herd' action. It's more like 'finally a service we enjoyed in another game is offered in the game we're currently playing'.
---
I see it more as buying Atoms once a month at a discount that comes with the added bonus of someplace to store my scrap.
---
I have that also.
---
False advertising does. I can do this all day. I have time set aside and I'm seeing how fast this can get me to negative Karma.
---
You're right, the outrage machine is alive and well within the gaming community.  There are tons of streamers and such that take advantage of it for every game.  This is why I've started doing independent research and I've stopped listening to it.  I ignored it for FO76, and I'm glad I did, because I enjoy the game.  I'll watch gameplay videos without commentary to make my decisions, usually.
---
Still, Bethesda isn't doing themselves any favors.  They ARE listening and responding, but there's still some sort of cancer meshed within that keeps getting control and derailing any attempts and making it better.  They need to root that shit out and fix it.
---
oops....I couldn’t add it to all rise...some bot vendor got that one from me....
---
Backbag and mod and unyielding gear is 550 carry weight, you only need to store ahdesive,spring,screw,oil and some steel to repair weapons n items you don't need to store anything else if you bulk craft ammo, and because with 2piece of ammo weight reduction gear in your unyielding and bandolier 2/2 it weights 0 so you can craft all you can as soon as you get it. And for scrip legendaries you can buy weightless stuff from other players and mod it with ultralight so it weights 0. Or just store whatever you can since you should have like 500lb of room in your stash.
---
I don't use inventory weight perks and my usual carryweight is 150/550, I don't use chems or carry aid besides a little water and 5-10 stimpaks that I only use to heal broken limbs from teleporting to my own camp due to bethesda's bug, eating raw meat from random enemies is good enough with carnivorous.
---
I’m waiting for the p2w peeps to complain about this “paid perk”...lol
---
you bought a subscription to a bug ridden game after a company lied to you dude i dont think im the idiot here.
---
Amen. A big part of this is why I haven’t played the game in a while. There are serious QoL changes that could help inventory management tremendously.
---
You can cry false advertising all day. What you can't do is prove it.
---
I avoided this game because it just sounded like a nerfed FO4.  Gonna have to add Bethesda to my list of 'prove yourself before I buy' lists like EA/Activision etc.
---
Maybe the Frog Legs perk from NW?
---
Yeah because its good
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED IN THE FALLOUT REDDIT!
---
I don't have to prove it. I'm a faceless person ranting on the internet for your enjoyment.
---
He should have put the web address on his billboard
---
Bethesda is bullshitting i think I have no idea.. I made a ticket and they said the same PlayStation issue. But i called PlayStation support and they said Bethesda is responsible...... its a ping pong game now. 
---
I actually found your topic cause im finding for a solution lmao....Fallout 1st can be found in the playstation store for US and Australia. But its missing in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore from what i see.. 
---
Still clueless...
---
Just make stored scrap weigh nothing. 
---
There’s already issues with perks that lower scrap weight when carried that don’t effect the weight in the stash. 
---
Make scrap weigh what it weighs based on perks when carried and weigh nothing in the stash.
---
Well, good for you, I suppose.
---
This is Reddit. Twitter is that other place where people also cry about nothing.
---
Are you saying Todd was heavily involved with 76, but not with 4? Where did you get all this info?
---
That must be pretty rad! I'd love to have a Fallout in an area I'm familiar with. Rather than getting familiar with Boston or WV because of a video game haha.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
Many decisions don’t make sense at any level.
---
It was a pleasure “speaking” with you.
---
See you out there
---
That'll do, pig.
---
Your not wrong. It's a solid 30hrs+ of just grind for division. As far as story, you get about as much as you do in f76
---
Might be the first time I've said that destiny has the most story off the list. Lol
---
You’re right 11 isn’t. 25 is a fairly well paying job. Sorry you hate your life and think everyone else should as well. I hope you get better 😉 Yup I spend it ALL on weed how’d you know? 😂😂
---
If you take a RAD-X it cancels mutation effect.
---
This is the equivalent of the girlfriend who brings up something you said a year ago.
---
i think the infinite scrapbox should be for private servers only  and quite honestly to pave the way for servers having mods which could also "break" the game.     Private servers should have separate saves then the main servers maybe a way to copy over your character to private servers but not vice versa
---
that way you can do your own thing with them but that the main base game wont become pay to win.
---
Everyone has a line. For some, Fallout First crossed this line, and they are no longer invested in the business. Clearly, your line is further down the road.
---
But every consumer has a line. Where is yours, I wonder? Is it when the wasterlander update is locked behind another paywall? When certain cosmetics are locked behind a lootbox? Or a global nerf to loot followed by an introduction of a battlepass for a loot boost? 
---
These will come. And one day, your line will be crossed too, and perhaps you will come to Reddit and rant about it, or perhaps you will quietly quit playing and fade into a daily routine without fallout 76. But it will pass, and no matter where your line lies, you will cross it sooner or later, and there, in the graveyard of dead games, fallout, too, shall pass and fade into disappointment.
---
Yea, it’s super stupid, everyone here is complaining about it yet we are here wanting to give them our money
---
I would be happy for any ash.
---
 Funnily enough the game is smooth fast and runs great on my machine. My 32" 4k display never drops below about 55 FPS and I have a lot of fun playing Fallout 76. I don't remember the last time I got disconnected.
---
 Playing The Outer Worlds as well and Fallout 76 is a better shooter. Its cute but I care more about combat than cute.
---
It's all an Halloween joke cough cough
---
Just a tinge of jealousy - That it seems their budgets are huge - I can’t get 1/2 the stuff in mine that I see in theirs....
---
A dozen rocket launchers, 8 display cases, multiple turrets, 4x vending machines, workbenches, multi story building with walls and a roof...decor all over....I cant get anywhere close to that.
---
It is really sad. Code-wise, something going missing in someone inventory should be fairly easily to find and revert. I assume they just choose the easy way out and eliminate the load on their support team...
---
too strange to be true cough cough cough
---
 I dunno then.
---
Yeah, a lot of the people i used to play with have started coming back since the update and our discord has been getting a decent flow of new arrivals and low levels.
---
I’d like to see that and separate FPP from TPP.
---
Im done with Bethesda.  They will have to prove themselves like any game from EA and Activision.            
---
                 
---
So far, not looking good from those 2.  Bethesda belongs in that group.
---
Can't believe no one has mentioned the additional shipping costs yet /s
---
This is the equivalent of getting into a relationship with a girl and then she suddenly charges $12.99 a month to smash.
---
What faction Dynamics? You could join all the factions because none of them had anything to do with any of the others outside of the civil war factions and the vampire/dawngaurd.
---
Morrowind had more faction Dynamics than Skyrim. You could join almost all of them on Morrowind as well but they at least had intersections between them with some consequences for choices...
---
Never take
---
So it was this fucking idiot who did it...
---
&gt;It makes you think about what you're picking up rather than mindlessly grabbing every item insight.
---
This is still the case with an infinite stash, because you can only carry so much at a time without being overburdened and unable to fast travel.
---
There is enough tedious crap in a game like this as it is without making it worse.  Fallout 4 had an infinite inventory, and nobody was crying out to make dealing with junk more tedious.
---
Why would you buy it in the first place?
---
I like this. Almost nobody locks their workbenches and other stuff. However, I use mine mostly as a fast travel point while exploring if I go to an event or defend a workshop so I can travel back to where I was. Bump it but allow fast travel back if the regular camp isn’t a vendor.
---
My point was how people frame when they speak of the two.
---
It's always $100 for fallout and many are saying you can get Xbox pass for a dollar! (yes. For one month) or F1st is $100 a year and xbox is only 14.99!
---
Wait but isnt nw a pvp arena gamemode?
---
Come on bro , think about this
---
When the rumors came out that it was going to be set in WV, I was hyped.  But then the trailer came out and I was blown away! I kept seeing landmark after landmark...just very surreal.
---
There junk limitations. No scrap limitations. Sure it could “possibly affect”... that doesn’t mean it’s a realistic issue would should be concerned about lol. Anything is possible. Doesn’t mean it’s a problem.
---
If the entire community is so pissed off how come so many camps I go to have scrap boxes?
---
These major issues are akin to plane crashes, there seem to be a lot of them because they are always big news but in reality planes crash very infrequently. I’m not saying the game is not buggy, because it definitely it is, but very very few players experience the issues you’re describing after literally thousands of hours of play. Additionally, Wastelanders has been delayed until quarter 1 next year.
---
If you buy the subscription you are telling companies they can get away with scamming everyone. So you are hurting everyone and you SHOULD be bullied.
---
Sadly no
---
Bethesda hates everyone. They just hate some people more than others.
---
False. 
---
You forgot BIV (almost as good as rose) and the 4  pioneer scout counselors.
---
Real People actually work for Bethesda and other companies supporting their products, I support them by supporting a game I enjoy fully... so you want me to help someone lose their job or prevent others from being hired? 
---
It’s also mine and everyone else’s right to be able to earn money and we can choose what to do with that money.
---
I’m willing to bet a million caps your economic thoughts and your lengthy post mirror left wing anti-capitalism socialism... am I close? I bet I am... 
---
I’ll be enjoying the paid subscription with my friends in a full private server again today because we all love the game, we all work hard and we can spend money we earn on what we like... it’s really that simple...
---
Nothing is free... quicker you understand that the better...
---
Yep, i mean they did at least delayed it but yeah BGS is not know for high quality Quality Assurance ;)
---
Played as a guest on a (PS4) 1st server for about 6 hrs last night. No noticeable issues changing weapons.  
---
Some things seem are faster (enter/exit PA animation), some things haven’t changed (slow scroll at a vendor, loading in/out of a zone).
---
Stutter/lag seemed to be reduced (compared to public/adventure)
---
SBs seemed a bit more animated/harder to hit, but that could be my imagination.
---
Also quieter - not a lot of background shooting/explosions, etc.
---
Hahahahaha you said the same thing in my mind. The same issue happened for the previous atom bundles that came with costumes. Hopefully its just a delayed release for countries in SEA.
---
Yea, maybe it will take a month or two
---
I’m supporting people working by buying their products so they can get a paycheck and healthcare... I’d rather be part of that herd...
---
Creation engine isn't a bad engine, it's better than unreal for a game such as fallout or TES no questions, hands down. Also with unreal you'd have to basically say goodbye to player modding in at least the form it's always been employed in bethesda titles.
---
Aww what that sucks but I guess that means that it will probably be better I’ve been data wiped before but I can see where your coming from
---
Your argument IS sound, _except that Xbox live subscriptions have nothing to do with Bethesda_;  you're getting a benefit from that service, regardless of whether you're playing Fallout 76 or another game, so paying for that service has no bearing on Bethesda's actions. Otherwise, I could just as well claim that my having to pay mortgage, utility, car and food bills is also a factor...but those payments would be just as irrelevant.
---
The argument is that Bethesda was duplicitous in their actions, and that the extent of it. They are trying to make us pay for features which should have been available to all, unlike cosmetic Atom Shop items which don't offer any in-game advantages.
---
Ouch
---
i think you can, BUT i am sure that you would only be able to deduct from it, not add anything else into it
---
Dang! Too late !
---
You can take your scrap out, but you can't put anything back in.
---
You can keep the armor though.
---
No they weren’t lol. Where did they explicitly say they will never add anything non-cosmetic. They explicitly said you won’t be able to buy legendary weapons in shop. And they also said there is a line and they are careful not to cross it. They never said they will never sell anything beyond cosmetics. Merely why was offered at launch
---
You're right. 
---
It seemed everyone hated the Conservatives for good reason but they got the most votes in Canada. I guess we always have to remind ourselves the average person is an idiot and 50% of the population is worse than that.
---
Look, I don't agree with the guy either, but Jesus Christ are you taking it too far.
---
I could help you also around that time
---
The enjoyment I get out of this is the same I get out of Game of Thrones final season. Absolute shit and made me lose trust and respect for the creators, but the memes and outcry have been absolutely fantastic.
---
Removing fallout first would be a great patch
---
I’m confused, Obsidian= Bethesda?
---
Lol this was me doing an underhanded jab at the fact that the community has been asking for in-game chat since before release. At this point they’ll probably put players on a payment plan similar to the old texting plans cell phone companies used in the early 2000s.
---
It's not just Bethesda.
---
Just saying.
---
Tbh, I think this and a whole bunch of stuff to even begin mending anything
---
Playing Outer Worlds now, which uses Unreal Engine. The game looks great and I’ve had zero crashes.
---
Nah obsidian doesn't even come close to them
---
IDK man, at this point I feel like people on this sub are just looking for reasons to be mad.  Case in point.
---
No, and that’s the point genius
---
Maybe a post-Christmas sale!
---
Democracy is non-negotiable.... 
---
Freedom is the sovereign right of every American....
---
Embrace democracy, or you will be eradicated....
---
Democracy is truth. Communism is death....
---
No truer words... 
---
I’ll full support capitalism and the democracy both in fallout and the real world...lol
---
that'll be released in year 3 for an additional 99.99
---
I’ve been data wiped before and so as my friend and it is pretty true that it does rarely happen but it still can happen but the point your making is very true and the fact that it’s being pushed back a year is good cause that means it will be most likely be fully developed let’s just hope the best for the future
---
No we have eso for years
---
I think ESO does this, but it's a much meatier game.
---
&gt; half-baked
---
No, I’m pretty sure they’re fucking lava in the middle
---
Im in Australia but the server is very laggy whenever i join my friends in the US. So im thinking its a routing issue hence i avoid US servers lol.
---
Not entirely sure. It’s outdoors? Can you show the actual photo?
---
With ammo sinks like the legendary sheepsquatch and the SBQ, I'm finding it difficult to hoard lead. I wish I could save up enough led to actually have a surplus of 5.56 ammo to sell to the community. I end up using it all myself.
---
way to keep it civil
---
I spelt new wrong so my bad
---
It is concerning to the people who are trading as most of the best legendaries are being sold in these communities. The inflation of price would hurt the trade scene even more. I've seen people ask for more ammo now than before the update.
---
You start the second, concurrent session by calling the Fo76.exe directly. It'll ask you for login credentials and not use the ones provided by the launcher.
---
My read was weight reduced only if they were in a display case.  Stash or on on hand, normal weight.
---
not really worried about it.. no
---
AA12 anyone?
---
They don't deserve civility
---
What is am armor case? And is that internet within spec?
---
Yeah it doesn't always work like that tho as of now. I server hopped my private world a bunch of times and a few of those my resource collectors disappeared and from what I could tell it was a different world. Using another player will make it so there is no chance of something funky happening and you will be sure you are getting back to the same world
---
Leeegggoooooooo
---
Is that internet within spec?
---
Going to take him a few days to travel to WS?
---
Incorrect.
---
the rules on the sub require it
---
Hell yeah. So excited
---
Try to start it from fallout76.exe most likely your game files are still on your hard drive. If not then it will be some waiting for download for you ;/
---
This is an juvenile post expressing toxic ignorance towards Bethesda's duplicitous acts. Demanding that people drop the topic is just more "burying our heads in the sand" towards corporate abuse of consumers. Posts like this one are rampant in trainer to valid complaints and have no place in the Fallout community pushing for decent customer relations and products delivered as advertised.
---
Lmao so many children posting this week.
---
"Please keep outer realms off this sub"-Mods

This guy - no and screw rule 4

People complaining about how other people spend their money that they earned... I bet most love the word “free” in real life...
---
He didn't know these things.  That was made clear in both the comic and the movie.  Veidt outsmarted him.
---
I swear we are just passing for mods by Bethesda
---
the real witch hunt ;-)
---
Not Even Worried.
---
Doest destiny 2 do this with the annual pass too
---
Coincidence that FO1st came out a day or two before Outer Worlds launch?
---
Based and protest-pilled
---
The part that throws me is that the people who are "attacking" OP are *in game*, and thus *also supporting Bethesda*. People don't seem to realize that playing = support to a company like Bethesda.
---
There is only one private world for you, if you leave it for couple minutes it will get killed and new one will be created when you try to join.
---
You missed my point, none of that exclusive content has any effect on the endgame. It just allows me to have a more comfortable house than you and I get to spend more time exploring because I don't have to spend 10-20 minutes a day bulking scrap so I can sell it to the robo vendor. I also don't see how it affects the economy because the amount of caps that are in the game do not change no matter what people are selling in their vendors. the Caps are either sitting in my customers pocket or sitting in mine but it doesn't magically create more caps that will unbalance the economy.
---
I think the problem is people just like to see things fail/ they want free shit
---
Arnt all CODs like this? Wouldn’t you consider the season pass a subscription?
---
Lmao so many shills posting this week.
---
Outer Worlds is such a good game. So many interesting characters and dialog paths and really amazing deep rpg mechanics. Could you imagine if they made this game a big empty world with no npcs? Why would anyone play that?
---
Preach man
---
yes i will totally do that!
---
cept i am using a private server with just me on it 
---
That is a big N.O. from me. I've seen the posts about how lousy the hackers in Nuclear Winter on the PC are. Keep your problems to yourself! Plus the last thing we need is PC users tossing around dev room items to gullible fools on the console. Already have seen enough Old Man Winter mask wearers get wiped.
---
When I still had the 50 cal sniper, I got a bit more damage from refined than the standard receiver.
---
(Although that might have been because of/in combination with the other mods that were already on it.)
---
You are literally just proving my point. If you're going to speak up about something, you can't just expect them to fix it. Criticism isn't useful unless it is constructive. So if you want something to be changed, include ideas of how, or just keep it to yourself.
---
Yes to armor no to box
---
I won't take anything you said here seriously unless you acknowledge the fact that Wastelanders will be completely free... that's waaaay more than "piddy" content... so yes, considering that, ESO and FO76 are comparable
---
Fallout 76 itself knows its fucked and has self destructed.
---
pwned
---
Corporate shill. It's literally $100/year for essentially nothing. Private servers are the exact same experience except without other people, which aren't really an issue anyways. Plus they aren't even fully private as of now.
---
The scrapbox is proof they lied about the stash limit causing performance issues, and it deletes items for some people.
---
What's the survival tent, a free fast travel point? Caps are pretty easy to get.
---
The atomic shop is a joke.
---
And an outfit and emotes aren't worth 100 dollars a year.
---
The whole thing is a lie because they said all microtransactions would be non-cosmetic and all content would be free. A feature a lot of people wanted, private servere, was promised to be free and then put behind a pay wall. That's lying. This greedy company has lied so many times with stuff around this game yet somehow they still get idiots like you defending them while they rob you.
---
Defending cash grabs like this only let them know they can get away with it.
---
Bethesda-world problems.
---
I want a syringer that when I shoot the officers, it mutes the bastards.
---
Use a VPN to get it for your account :) idk if that would work, but I’ve done that to get games that were cheaper In a different region (actually bought fallout 76 while VPNd to Australia)
---
That's ignorant. Stop flooding the topic with responses that career too the problem and assist Bethesda in ignoring consumers.
---
&gt;People complaining about how other people spend their money that they earned
---
When did I say something like that? Oh wait, I didn't.
---
nah bro fuck Bethesda, fuck fallout, fuck $100 predatory pay to win subscription services. If you want people to bitch about Bethesda in a different sub then please, start a /fuckbethesda sub for us.
---
Sounds like you just lost the game.
---
It’s not an actual challenge. It’s there as a mechanic to show you how long you’ve played lol
---
Thats after a few years of updates. I played it when it first came out and stop after becoming emperor. But then been on off to do new content
---
They should really just retitle the game "Predatory Marketing Practices" the game
---
Here we go again with the "I'm entitled to a perfect game and don't have to do jack to help the developer get better" crap.
---
Your character in the main menu does not tell you in FO76... do you even play the game??
---
Yea, it's an outdoor location. You can see this week's photos at this link:

---
And it should be 5th picture when you press "view gallery".
---
I have vanguard and bolstering thorn armor; both of them appear to function properly.   I also have  vanguard solar armor and it appears to function properly ( adds more than 25 dr at high health).
---
That's the Great Architect telling you to get out while you can.
---
It's not really fair to call it full price any more, it's been under £20/$20 for ages.
---
There already is one. r/falloutpurists. Have fun, kiddo.
---
I can understand that, I'm a melee user so it's really easy for me to hoard ammo and use it to trade.
---
Of course they need to make money, but they should also be smart about it.  Months on end, people kept begging for specific cosmetics ( bos themes, enclave, skins for handmades, ranger armor, list goes on ), they could have released many of these earlier or at all and made money.  Instead the atom shop was full of items that majority made no sense being there.  
---
Also test servers, why these aren't there yet for pc yet is baffling beyond belief.
---
You're comparing 2 different games.
---
This game never promised NPCs. The people who bought the game knew that going into it.
---
I googled destiny 2 subscription but can’t find anything. Also I’m setting that destiny 2 is free to play? What I’m asking is that FO76 is a full priced game still and has a subscription to experience all the content. Plus microtransactions
---
It can drop from other events too you know?
---
Bethesda's is lawfully bound to deliver the product as advertised. Not sure what you keep trolling about.
---
Which ones?
---
You know unless of course this community only represents a small portion of the playerbase, which it does, and bethesda has seen more than enough people purchase the subscription to basically tell this sub to go fuck itself, which it most likely has and should
---
They are pay for convenience as Bethesda would say face it the collector bot, fridge, repair/scrap kits and now fallout 1st are no different from being able to buy ingame currency to get a leg up/improve the grind... and give it a few months and I will bet buying Caps in some form will make it into F78.
---
I'm going to punish Bethesda  by not having fun!
---
Great idea.  Keep it up.
---
Yeah I played the beta and it was really bad.  Looks good now though.
---
Honestly, if you aren't expecting it to be a garbage fire you're a fool, ut if you're still supporting this game at this point you're already a fool, so I suppose everybody in here is a fool, willing to not be worried about wastelanders. Just folks jumping at the opportunity to throw their cash into fire.
---
News flash. Butt sex isn't exclusive to homosexuals.
---
Thanks! That is interesting. I have no idea but looks new.
---
Boycott the game from within the game. Wow. That's some big brain thinking. /s
---
No. If you want the hate to stop, you need to talk to Bethesda, not us. We didn't royally shit the bed, and expect everyone to sleep in it, Bethesda did. We are allowed to voice our disdain for it.
---
If it makes a difference... I would just give the set to you.... I don’t need it
---
I've lost any sort of hype the moment they announced Wastelanders for Q1 2020...
---
You again? More projecting. Grow a spine, Stockholm sufferer.
---
I find 8 dollars a month 100% acceptable for a private session where I can farm in peace.  I understand it’s not for everyone, but that’s also not my problem.  The price of the subscription in my opinion is more than fair for what someone gets
---
Not really. It's a hassle to constantly manage inventory.
---
Of course they could have handled it better, but it's crazy how people handled that, and the way they reacted is the same way a 2 year old would.
---
If you don't like the game uninstalling makes sense.
---
If you do like the game why should the existence of things you don't want to buy make you uninstall?  I just don't see the logic.
---
I thought so too, but I discovered that they can be made into ash or goop or other things than corpses depending on weapon type.
---
I found small ash piles in tall grass especially hard to find....
---
The perk that gives 5+meters of detection range helps a lot!
---
Yea people are such babies lol smh.  They don’t understand reality lol
---
I wounder have you ever heard of a game called world of Warcraft from back in the day?
---
look, if you want to keep living in the delusion that this sub is in anyway indicative of the playerbase as a whole thats fine, just know you're 100% wrong
---
Yes, it is. By buying it you are telling them that it's good and they should continue doing it. At least EA Sports Games actually work and do their job. They don't lie to their community 24/7. Bethesda is 10x as bad as EA. Anyone who buys Fallout 1st should be ashamed and you should shame them. They are hurting everyone.
---
yeah i put all of my vault steel into crafting thorn and solar armor instead of strangler power armor. Thought i was unlucky for a while. Then i started talking to people and realized I couldn't find a single person that had rolled unyielding. Don't really care about the solar armor with unyielding because you need to be at medium/high health ( i think &gt; 59%) to activate the healing effect. I really wanted thorns with unyielding since its bonus applies to melee and unarmed attacks.
---
*shrugs*
---
Hey, wouldn't it be great if they added regular 50% off sales for Fallout 1st subscribers? I feel like they haven't bent us over the barrel quite enough yet, and that would be the perfect way to completely destroy every last bit of goodwill they have.
---
Strange Brew I know for sure.  I believe any of the Responder events can reward it. I believe Horde events may reward it as well. 
---
Here is a chart that shows which events reward which outfits.

---
We're talking about Uncle Pete and Todd Howard man ... do you really think this story is true?
---
Well voice it in a manner that doesn't read 99.9 on my Geiger counter, please.
---
I know where you can get the plans for them. Over by the dam in the mire there is a random encounter spawn. There is three possible Trick or Treaters. The skeleton and witch both give the plans for that outfit. The vampire does not, but does have a fair bit of candy on them.
---
Its definitely gotta be that swampy land in the top right of the map. But I dont recognize it at all. I'll try and hunt it down when I'm able to get back on!
---
I’m really not sure. The way I see it, Season passes offer some optional new content for a one time fee. Subscription means you must pay recurrent amounts of money every month just to keep playing the same content.
---
Console crossplay ok.
---
PC crossplay, never.
---
21 in the netherlands, and yes, here they are also required to show prices with VAT
---
There that ignorant trolling again. I specifically stated that Bethesda is lawfully bound to deliver the product as advertised. Not sure why you advocate otherwise, but I'd like to actually enjoy what was promised.
---
Well no, they do understand but they react like babies. Unless you were joking, which I assume given the lol and smh, but nonetheless.
---
We aren’t trying to get people to buy it dub. Learn the definition of shill if you are going to use it like a big boy.
---
Outer Worlds is an singleplayer RPG, F76 is a multiplayer survival game with certain limited RPG mechanics. The comparison is stupid. The issue with F76 is that it's not a very successful multiplayer survival game.
---
For what you're getting, the price isn't bad. 1650 atoms and an outfit is already on par with that quakecon "special" deal where you got some extra atoms and that uniform for $10. I believe most of the outrage is around A) stuff coming out broken, as usual, B) private servers not being as private as people expected/wanted, and C) the scrapbox (although it is currently broken) completely derailing past expectations and severely messing with the game flow/balance. If the scrapbox and tent were not tied to fallout 1st, and private servers allowed local hosting with admin permissions and modding instead of recycling other servers, then it would be okay-ish
---
But it would also be better if the atoms/outfit were their own separate bundle, private servers were a much cheaper individual sale, and scrapbox/tent were not monetized at all
---
The controller/keyboard problem isn't the real console/pc problem.  The real problem is the hackers on PC.
---
There are hundreds of ways to keep a game’s development afloat without breaking promises and making it pay to win. Overwatch for example has a loot box system that’s completely cosmetic and they pump out new content all the time.
---
Sure, insulting other players or non players isnt the way to go.  Personally, I've been a fallout fan since 1.  I have over 900+ hours in, but I can't do it anymore.  I had to uninstall until I see real change.  My hope is that Beth at least sees everything that's happened, as unfortunate as it is, and regroups to improve the game.  Only time will tell though.
---
If you hate it so much, maybe say, uninstall and leave the subreddit? I mean seriously, if you're this sensitive it's best for your mental health to move on.
---
Nice, maybe they'll open it in 2 or 3 years! Get hyped for 2022 !!!
---
i love you guys
---
No. No we cant. You're free to go elsewhere, though.  Some of us have been playing and supporting this game for a year.
---
We are free to express our anger, our disappointment or anything else.
---
I just saw this subscription like elder scrolls one. 
---
You get shit that others can't, you get atoms for free basically. 
---
You get to hold it over someone. 
---
But the surprise is. It's optional. 
---
All optional. 
---
There's no point to complain about something being optional. 
---
If I had to pay 100 a year to play the game. Then yeah, I'd complain. But it's optional. So no complaints.
---
Shameful. Really showcasing how immature some one can be.
---
you now OW is a 25-40 hour game, right ?
---
Yes, and posts like this are equally unhelpful and self serving
---
They really don’t understand lol they believe the change of circumstances is a pre planned lie. If a dad promises his kids he’ll take them Disney land and looses his job and can’t, did he lie or did things change? Lol
---
Do you realize that's an insane amount of real money for a shitty reskin?
---
 Oh, brother, you have no idea what's going to happen
---
So you are saying a company can never change its mind about anything?
---
Slow your role, drama queen.  I never even said I agreed with the subscriptions.  It *is* pretty greasy how they're delaying Wastelanders for this.  But you don't have to subscribe.  They're not siphoning money out of your pockets.  The advantages that subscribed players get, even with that dumb scrap box, don't really tip the scales in their favor in PvP either.
---
So I just don't see the point in getting my panties in a bunch over something that I would have to opt into and doesn't really affect my experience if I don't.  I'll just keep farming, selling stuff, and updating my camp until Wastelanders comes out a season late.
---
I'm just not going to be a little bitch about it.
---
At least I'm being constructive and sending people to a sub that will wholeheartedly take their rants.
---
Lol call me whatever, but it won’t change how lame you are for letting a company cuck you every chance they get
---
100% agree, I actually avoid playing are 4pm because of it
---
Cope
---
Does you friend have bird bones and you don't?
---
Bird bones stop the speed of you falling so that might look like you friend jumps higher, in fact your friend just falls slower.
---
okay lol those lols are starting to hurt lol
---
WoW - $60 expansions, about the same monthly cost, $20 pony skins (along with other things like companion pets).
---
What about console crossplay
---
I don’t remember who tf BIV is and the 4 pioneer guys are just protectrons
---
I find the Gauss rifles to be the best weapon in game next to the 50 cal heavy machine guns. Won my first match (third match ever) by putting two rounds into a guy's chest and popping him in the back of the skull with a third round when he tried to run.
---
They are at fault though. If nobody bought it Bethesda wouldn't put a paywall on it. But they do, which lets Bethesda know that they can scam people with stuff like Fallout 1st and get away with it. You are supporting this stuff by purchasing it. Anyone who buys these scams should be shamed by the community.
---
Sorry text hurts you 😂😂😂🖖🏾🖖🏾
---
Awesome! I’ll continue hunting
---
Well i was speaking Euro, not Pound. 100 Dollar are about 90 Euro, but we pay 120. Fine it's not quite 50% but it's way over the 19% VATs. 
---
So no the problem is not that they just changed the sign, they did that AND are charging another 20 bucks extra just because they think enough idiots will pay it anyway. Which they sadly are right about.
---
I’m saying a company cannot market a game as having all future content be free except for some cosmetic items, and then throw in content that they had previously stated WOULD be free specifically behind a paywall.
---
That’s called lying. In this instance, the company “changing its mind” is ridiculous. There’s a nuance to be applied and saying “HURR durr a company can’t ever change its mind?” Is some strawman asinine point that just completely misses all middle ground on the subject.
---
You sound like a monster getting angry that civilians don't want it attacking their city when there is an abandoned place that won't destroy the monster next door.
---
It was meant to be taken supporting your original comment... I’m tired of people complaining and seeing entire feeds from this group by many that don’t even play the game... 
---
One thing I’ve literally never done is uninstall a game I paid for...lol
---
I’ll start possibly believing those people when they post videos of them deleting their characters in game before they uninstall it!
---
I swear to god the average age of this playerbase must be like 10 lmao
---
This. But I don't use one myself.
---
Hate what? This is that trollish toxicity that can't accept others who want to love the game as it was advertised rather than paying more and more for what was stated as included.
---
People who waste money on gold teeth dont make me angry, it makes me sad someone would be that dumb to waste their money.
---
Cause there's no other game or real life activity to have fun with instead right?
---
You can't. He's talking about plants that you have growing in your camp. Apparently when you scrap them they go into the scrap box. now that it's been revealed though I'm sure it won't take long so they run a hotfix on that. They don't spoil in the scrapbox just like when you store them in build mode.
---
You’re right, rewarding people with only 20 atoms for playing their trash isn’t something to be mad about, when I could be mad about the bugs, the lack of content, the canvas bags, the lies, the atomic shop pricing, the p2w in the atomic shop, the 1st Pass, the broken raids, the broken battle royale, the
---
Technically, your government hates you. Here is an educational video made by your own government. https://youtu.be/Hgj3MYvrAN0
---
I'm allowed to think the things other people enjoy are bad for them and bad for the industry as a whole when they have predatory microtransactions.
---
That was the first game I thought of. It currently costs $15 per month to experience all the content plus microtransactions. I don’t think you have to pay for the game up front on top of that though. Was it a combo of all three monetization methods back then?
---
It doesn't spoil in the scrap box, it doesn't have a 'condition' just like when you store it in build mode
---
Then that’s even dumber, why put it in the challenges section and add 20 atoms as a reward like all the other CHALLENGES
---
Lights and crops really add up against your budget. Minimize those and you may be surprised how much space they were taking up.
---
Same here! Ignore Bethesda's Choice and enjoy the Fallout game we really  wanted, Outer Worlds.
---
Guess what? You can get really far in any purchased game with nothing but the game itself. If you're going to pay for something optional, don't complain about it.
---
Already uninstalled.
---
It says it right above the name and photo card when you select character or is that something else? And why are you so mad, nerd? You people are so weird about this game
---
For those who don't know, Vault 79 is the vault which is to be featured in Wastelanders. Now some may say "Oh, isn't that speculation?" No, no it isn't. In one of the older images promoting Wastelanders the vault door shown features 79 on it.
---
Those are emojis though. Unless... [flustered emoji x3]
---
But that's the thing. After not playing for a few days I've realised that I wasn't having fun playing the game - I was doing it out of habit. Going in, doing dailies, doing my scrip - honestly? The most fun I was having was trading. I was holding on for the game to get better. When it came down to the fact that for the game to get better I'd have to pat for it again? It just wasn't worth it for me.
---
So I've been playing a couple of other games and having a great time - thinking about them when I'm offline, forming strategies, doing research - all those things that you do when you're genuinely engaged in a game. And in retrospect I realise that I haven't felt like that about fo76 in a long time. 
---
I loved the game and I've invested well over 1,000 hours of my life in it, but there wasn't enough there for me to justify the expense that was asked and it would have been the only thing that would have held my interest. 
---
So yeah - I'm having lots of fun. Lots &amp; lots. And I owe it all to Bethesda being ignorant, greedy and short-sighted cunts. And I can tell you one thing for sure. I will never, ever buy another title from the studio.
---
I'd never pay money for it. The real money exchange rate in the atom shop is and always was absolute fucking garbage. $5 should be 2000 atoms at the very least with how expensive things are and how easy it is to get atoms from challenges. But the lowered prices mean you can get a pa skin after less than 2 weeks of grinding challenges now
---
Technically many of the posts from those complaining said they uninstalled the game...lol
---
One thing those complaining didn’t do was show a video of them deleting their characters before uninstalling... if they meant what they said they would have done that. (If they actually played the game... funny how many never commented and joined only to complain)
---
Good point
---
I think players would like to get what was advertised in the way it was advertised. The subscription is a total ambush. It's ok &amp; justified to be upset about it under those circumstances, it wasn't announced this way, Bethesda specifically stated the opposite the whole time.
---
Right? Idk where the mods are. The retired posts (bethesda plz) rule is to stop repeat topics, but this can go on? Just constant whining and fighting and insulting other players.
---
Lol wow smh
---
Gonna be 2 days before I'm back home, but I can help ya if you still need it by then
---
I can't upvote this enough.
---
I got mine this way about a month I think ago... never knew the event was a thing, always thought it was tea time only there.
---
I've genuinely seen people talk about how it's the best deal they've done, you get so many atoms and it's quite cheap. I wanted to punch my phone tbh
---
Get a running start and hold the jump button
---
Not sure that I thought I was entitled to control the evolution of Fallout 76. Asking for additional features for free also sounds kind of dumb.
---
Too.
---
This!
---
Calling people babies and low key insulting people based off their opinions on a public forum is not helping
---
The sheer amount of infighting is just proof that the fallout community is no exception to the collapse of human culture.
---
When it first game out it was 60 plus subscription and a bit of micro
---
Which part's pay to win?
---
If they're going to advertise a product a specific way, it has to be delivered as such. FO76 l wasn't, and it's an issue. I'm sorry you can't understand that, but you can stop trolling about it in a way that's toxic to the community.
---
This bug doesn't affect premium users so it will be fixed in about 1 year. It's been around since May and it's here to stay, unfortunately.
---
Neither are you.
---
Ahhhh, I see. I'm using the wrong set up. I'll have to try one of these doors when I get back on. Thanks!
---
The talk about engine limitations have allways been about weight limit i believe, not about scrap on its own since that have only been a very small part of storable items until seperate scrap storage came now. As anyone that played back when hard inventory limits were added (and they actually got serious about trying to prevent duping) can attest, server stability got drastically improved overnight. So this is the source for the talk about inventories affecting stability. Because it does, far more than it ever should in a well designed system.
---
Designing enjoyable games doesn't seem to be Bethesdas strong suit these days tho. Putting such items as subscription rewards as well as these "private" servers instead of the moddable actual private servers we were promised was the nail in the coffin for me. At least now i've got one less launcher i need to deal with.
---
You paid money for a thing.
---
There is a thing to buy that you don't want (or to be more exact don't want at the price it's being sold).
---
You like the thing (assumption -- if you don't like it then this discussion ends because you are not "boycotting" it, you are just not using it because you don't like it).
---
You stop using the thing you like because somebody else has bought something you don't want.
---
Sorry, I'm just not getting it.
---
Just want to start by saying I'm not trying to with argue you or anyone.. dont come for me. Pls.
---
I get why people are mad and I also get why Bethesda is doing it. 
---
I have to poke a hole in your arguement though because with minecraft you get a set world that you can invite people to and customize however you want, especially on PC. I haven't tried Fallout 1st (not gonna to either, not for me) but I think you get a random server when you hop on. I also saw some people complaining that you can't invite people but they can join it? 
---
Based on the arguments I've read, it seems people are more upset with the incentives (scrap box, survival tent, etc.) And then the world still being rather limited (not mod-able yet). 
---
I think people are upset that they are putting some of the more requested item behind pay walls. Despite how loyal the fanbase has been with all the other issues that have happened. Like the scrap box would have been a nice "Sorry for the Wasterlander DLC delay, here is a new utility item to help with stash limit."
---
What the fuck, man? We're talking about the fact that people supporting these shitty business practices is what allows them to occur. They claimed purely cosmetic transactions in the atom shop would fund the game.
---
"I put piece of shit between these two slices of bread way back when, so don't go thinking that the Burger is more important and influential then it is." is basically how that reads to me. Sure they did it before, but they never did it well. Bethesda took the formula they basically pioneered with TES and slapped it on FO3. Obsidian took that and did everything Bethesda had spent decades trying to perfect, better, on an engine Obsidian weren't even familiar with.
---
Just join a player that has fallout 1st and ask if you can do your own thing
---
Says the person who has literally been trying to explain why they can be outraged about an optional game expansion they purchased knowing the seller's trackrecord. Clearly somebody hasn't been putting enough special points into perception.
---
Because they lied to everyone. Supporting it tells them they can lie all they want and still get their money. It means they will put more stuff behind a paywall because they know people will buy it.
---
So what? why would you even consider buying it? Do. Not. Support. This. Crap!
---
I have about eleven hundred hours on 76. It started going downhill for me around patch 9 i think then after patch 11( a couple months ago )i was really dissapointed. Your doing all the quests and things i did last year.  Ive just stayed because there werent any other games out i was intrested in and I was basically hanging out with friends.
---
V.A.T.S. It is said V.A.T.S.
---
Ikr smh 😑😑😑
---
I kill robots and serched lootable contaners for them.
---
It's pretty hilarious any time people who claim to be programmers or DBAs or whatever, claim to have full understanding and knowledge of the development of systems they have no visibility into and have never seen the code around.
---
Yeah, wikis have a hard time catching up to online games since it's harder to data mine, test different outcomes and poke around in the files.
---
1. Holding the start button or going into the start menu, social, recent and finding the username with a dot next to it
---
2. It should be random
---
3. It makes at 5
---
4. Not sure off the top of my head, but armor penetration sounds right. There should be a description at the work bench once you learn it.
---
5. Don't use chat, so not sure.
---
6. Your SPECIAL will increase once per level until 50. Where the point goes depends on which attribute you select initially. You can split your SPECIAL point and perk by using the bumpers to filter the perk cards after selecting and initial SPECIAL attribute.
---
7. Tips; take workshops for easy plans (just watch for griefers and store your junk beforehand), always run the leader of the pack event, and if a high level player is hanging around you they're probably trying to give you stuff, look for a paper bag on the ground nearby.
---
And? Fallout 76 is a 20 hour game. By then you could’ve completed the “story” and experienced everything horrible to know it’s not worth playing further
---
Wait wait wait... Games are only $30 there?? Welp I'm moving.
---
If people actually bought atoms this would be considered more than a wash. Even without the "discount" for a year's subscription it's $12.99 for something like $15 worth of atoms.
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/RifleGaming
---
Check this place out.  I have referenced these videos before launching any nuke.  Apparently the space station is a wash :(
---
🤣
---
Ironic how the most civilized person in this thread is named McSaltMaker.
---
Im not the one calling people names and acting like im special
---
This is why we need modding ASAP. 
---
That way people can play the game the way they want to.
---
Why are you being downvoted?
---
Do people really still have hope for ES6, and starfield? After seeing how Skyrim was a step down from it's predecessors, and how Fallout 4 was a giant leap down from Fallout 3 and NV, then the entirety of Fallout 76 not to mention all the other red flags like that mobile Skyrim dungeon game nobody wanted, how can anyone still hold hope in their heart?
---
No
---
Myself, my son and a few friends filled up all 8 slots and had an amazing time, launched nukes and did everything to include killing the queen all without the worry of anyone one shotting the legendary... 
---
Server was smooth as all HE double L, maybe due to no one hopping between words??? 
---
If I went out with the same friends it would cost me well over $100... go figure...
---
You were so close to making a good point and sounding responsible in this thread 😂
---
2. When breaking down weapons, you learn mods randomly. You have a high chance of learning some mods, a low chance of learning others. There are a few that you can't learn by scrapping weapons. 
---
The Scrapper perk will help you learn mods so equip it before a scrapping session if you have it. Higher intellegence will help so pop a mentat first too.
---
I'm on PC so I can't answer some of your other questions. I think this is the best wiki:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout_76)
---
Same here. I got taken out by a few shots from and auto gun. They need to change things up. Power Armor is supposed to be like a tank. What good is it if a few shots from a machinegun can take it out?
---
Even with 25% VAT, which is at the high end, the equivalent price is only 112€.
---
Yeah, neither am I. There is a difference between a comparison and name calling. Blurry difference, but still.
---
Bethesda SOFTWORKS is the publisher. Bethesda GAME STUDIOS is the developer. There are two Bethesda’s that do different things.
---
Yes, that's exactly what I mean by bandwagon. The vocal minority who take a videogame microtransaction that doesnt affect them personally as serious as real life.
---
Bethesda should did your "internets" lol. Get good.
---
Roflmao yeah 🙃
---
1. How do I accept an in game team request on the PS4? I have zero friends as I'm new to PS so these are just random people I meet in game. 
---
I'm on Xbox but if you go into your social menu anyone that sent you a invite will have a green dot next to their name. Hover over them and select accept team invite. 
---
2. When breaking down guns for mods, is the mod going to random or does it already have to be on the gun? I need a scope for my rifle and can't find one.
---
 The mods you get from breaking down guns and armor are random. Sometimes you don't get anything. Higher intelligents gives you higher chance of learning a new mod. 
---
3. Does my water purifier only pump out 5 at a time or can it store it lile in FO4?
---
 Your camp as a whole can only produce 1purified water at a time no matter how many purifiers you have. Each purifier can hold a total of 5.
---
4. What does a "stinging magazine" do? Best I could tell was armor penitration? The wiki isn't complete. 
---
I think its armor penetrate and increase damage, but I could be wrong. 
---
5. Why does my chat volume always turn it self all the way down everytime I load the game? 
---
No clue, sorry.
---
6. Can some EL5 the level up system, if I choose a perk card in, lets say strength. Does level up strength or do I have to have a certain level of strength to use the card. I understand that the card total (including stacked) has to equal the Special total. But I dont understand how to increase the Special total.
---
Each time you level up you get 1 point to put into a special. You also get to choose a new perk, but remember you don't have to choose a perk that corresponds with the special attribute you picked. For example, you can put 1 Point into strength but then choose a intelligence perk. Did that answer your question?
---
Just buy it on Microsoft Game store. 
---
I wanted the game, I refuse to give money to Epic Games Store. 
---
As a consequence I bought it from Microsoft. (Did the battlepass thing, which actually gives me the game for $1 right now (for a month))
---
I'm just hoping they refine the system a little bit and let us modify gear like in diablo3. Still wondering what the "legendary modules" are that I can buy from the purveyor. Costs 50 scrip for 10 of them
---
I don’t believe this comment is so far removed from being a reasonable response that it deserves downvotes. Here’s a upvote to help balance the wackiness of the reddit-karma-beast.
---
No. I still cant use mine in public servers with anything that shoots fast.
---
Oh yea i forgot cigarettes will be in every shop even if nobody will buy them, my bad then.
---
How? Can you describe anything they've done that's anti consumer that doesn't involve that fucking promise?
---
Ok, that's cool.
---
What pisses me off are the people who pretend they like the game but they're going to stop playing because of "outrage".
---
Minor quibble here:
---
&gt; When it came down to the fact that for the game to get better I'd have to pay for it again? It just wasn't worth it for me.
---
Not seeing it.  You think FO 1ST would make the game better?
---
Aww, your trying to come on to me!  How cute!  
---
I knew when you used the term ‘cuck’ you were trying to signal/project your deep down desires.
---
Sorry but you aren’t my type.  I like other girls, not guys.  
---
Plus, I couldn’t possibly even think about being with someone who can’t control their anger and rage because of a video game.
---
I’m sure you’ll find someone though - give it time.
---
I feel like you’re missing the point entirely.
---
Why I should use a practice that isn't practice? Sheep.
---
Yes I know. 
---
It's still Bethesda's fault either way.
---
All of your comments are at like negative 4.
---
It might be a random encounter. They spawn a lot in the northern mire.
---
&gt;Oh your fast, i have 2k + hours in this game, and still finding new locations, and i am still having a great time ;)
---
Ikr. The atomic shop itself is a complete joke. I don't know how anyone can be excited about paying 18 dollars for a power armor skin or 5 dollars for some flooring.
---
Honestly not sure in that regard. I mean as a trader that would open a new market. But it wouldn't be like we could add them as friends or anything given how the social system works.
---
And yours sir.
---
I mean maybe Bethesda knocks it out of the park with wastelanders, but even if they do I don’t see fallout 76 making a comeback.
---
Just too much bad pr.
---
Wow. No pun intended. I never played it haha. Had a friend who did and he got some serious depression when he found out the hours he put into the game added up to several months of real time
---
That’s cool, so bad i have no use for that, can be useful for new players.
---
They should just tell Mom to come off her credit card and stop the salt lol. I love playing without the scrubs, finally adult only fallout
---
Why avoid epic?
---
It also doesn't help that all anyone talks about in regard to that price are the singular features. People screaming about how they're being forced to pay $13 a month just for access to the scrap storage when they're actually getting about $15 worth of atoms a month on top of all of the other features.
---
What's the difference between private worlds and being able to play offline? Either way it's just you alone in a world.
---
People probably just don't like pessimism. Though frankly I don't see how any other outlook can be rational in regard to Bethesda based on literally everything you said. Fallout 76 has been such a dumpster fire from jump and Bethesda just keeps doubling down on it - that's no way to build or maintain consumer trust.
---
Nope.
---
Instead of telling the entire community to "get over it", or to make it trigger you less, maybe you should just take a break from this feed for a minute, or y'know, "get over it" yourself?
---
Happiness is a nuked white springs all to yourself
---
the uh play offline part maybe?
---
Honestly I play solo usually and I'd love an XP boost. Or the ability to instantly kill enemies in squads rather than down them. Way too often I just get jumped in 1 v 4. Even if I down one or two they just kill me and revive each other making it all or nothing and odds are insanely against you for all.
---
And why does that matter to you? You're free to not like something. It's your personal choice. Some of us DO like this. Why is it that those of us who DO like Fallout 1st have to justify it? Why are we supposed to join the crowd and hate on Bethesda? 
---
You hate what Bethesda has done, I don't. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
Ya totally agree. The people who paid for Fallout 1st deserve so much worse than just their items to be deleted. I’m sure phishing scam and con artist folks look at the people doing this dumb stuff in droves as a sign that the future will be very bright. The people who paid for this are the equivalent of the idiot who gets taken in by “a Nigerian prince.”  It’s the same scam but this time they’re doing it in broad daylight.
---
Okay psycho... did you forget to take your meds today? Your arguments are delusional and not based in fact. But like I said, keep shilling for Bethesda and pay them to bend you over, you seem to be enjoying it thus far so I’ll leave you be.
---
That’s fine, but it’s like for what? What do you have to show for it? Do you remember any memorable moments in the story? Any lines of dialogue? Did anything mind blowing happen other than dropping a nuke at the end? I have all locations discovered, all main quest done, some side quests, all in like 100 something hours
---
David CHADman
---
Ha! Thanks! Mc is part of my real name and Saltmaker was given to me by a few of my friends playing World of Tanks where the object is to kill the other team... well people get really salty when they die... especially if you use artillery in that game...lol
---
I think everyone should be able to do and buy what they want... if people don’t like something don’t buy it... 
---
People saying they’ve been lied to... really??? Do they all live in a hole in the basement and never engaged with a real world economics? 
---
Bottom line is people can think and say anything... Problem comes when they disrespect those that have a different opinions than them and go on the attack...
---
Go home Bethesda, with your month old 1 karma phishing accounts.
---
Except you can plop down a survival tent wherever you want for free and scrap it all. No need to fast travel anywhere to unload.
---
I never used mules. Too risky. And I did uninstall the game. However, Scrap boxes were only a small part of the reason. Its a cumulative effect of the way the game and company has been since when I started playing in Beta. The membership, and they way it worked, while the game was in the state it is in was the final straw as I finally came to realize the game was only go to go further and further from what I'm willing to pay for. I would have been okay with a sub  but I have to feel I am getting value for my money which this didn't For one I don't want my own private server. 
---
It made me quite disappointed since I do enjoy post apocalyptic style games.
---
Was the daily a couple of weeks ago... maybe the weekly...eat candy gum or pies I believe it was
---
This is a completely different argument. If they stopped selling cigarettes it would just move over to the black market. Also, there would be many pissed off people jonesing for a cigarette. The already, less educated and high risk portion of society would go a little crazy at the same time. Are you also anti abortion? The solution to cigarettes is educating the public and it has been working if you don't count the vape fad.
---
Technically you **ARE** VIPs.
---
Legit fan. Guess you'll have to just shame me for not sharing the same opinion.
---
You gonna play on an offline server? Word things better and say you want to play offline
---
yeah, it's glorious. Fuck a game that's 100 hours, 50 of which are fetch quests or walking between point a-b.
---
The main thing I want the one-month only purchase for is for the NV ranger armor, but I swear if they end up releasing the riot armor in the atom shop...
---
Your friends have good taste in nicknames.
---
You didnt really answer the question. What would be the ingame difference?
---
Or, and here me out. We chose to pay this, and no one else has to, you aren't forced to subscribe to it. You could play the game as normal, or you can quit. Weird how free will works, right?
---
Hell, you even have the right to be pissed off about it. But you do NOT have the right to demand that other people follow along with the herd.
---
Cuck.
---
Yeah my friend bought me a copy and when i saw how the graphics style look horrible and you had to enter your card information i noped out
---
FO76 is like if you had a fun looking first person RPG then took an ice cream scoop and scooped out all the good elements and left nothing but the shit.
---
Why would we want to play the game still. What new thing have they actually added?
---
It's like all us disappointed fans were served a plate of hot dog shit and a side of half a carrot, the carrot was ok if not completely boring, but how can you get so salty over us not finishing the plate and asking for seconds like you do?
---
No we aren't going to still be playing this game a year after it came out, especially since even though "most" of the bugs and glitches are gone there's still no purpose or fun in the game to be had.
---
Oh i totally forgot there is no black market for fo76 selling all kind of in game stuff for $
---
I was but after fallout76 I’m gonna have to wait for reviews. 
---
I’m kinda doubting Bethesda’s ability to make good games at this point
---
Don't forget a live service is not a singular thing you buy like a loaf of bread, with a loaf of bread you buy the bread then you make a sandwich and eat the sandwich done deal but with a live service game you buy access to the game and then at every point possible the thing you already "own" keeps asking for more money in order to have the experience that it keeps promising is just around the corner. Which would be like the loaf of bread requiring a top-up DLC in order to make a sandwich as sandwich functionality is not included in the base loaf.  
---
Also " You stop using the thing you like because somebody else has bought something you don't want. "
---
might be closer to the truth if you put it like this " You stop using the thing you like because somebody else has bought something you didn't want in the game in the first place and you feel that its inclusion weakens the game or is indicative of the company's goals misaligning with your own. (E.G you want to enjoy fallout gameplay Bethesda, however, wants you to give them all the money in the world for skins at best and gameplay advantages at the worst)
---
When you die... can i scrap you for bone shards ?
---
fuck purists, i asked for a fuck bethesda sub. if you can't give me one then I'll continue fucking them here.
---
He’s just a braindead shill unable to comprehend basic logic that Bethesda loves to fuck. Why are people even wasting time explaining stuff to him lmao.
---
How i do delete it from ps store?
---
Stinging = larger capacity + some armor penetration
---
Piercing = faster reload + some armor penetration
---
Perforating = more armor penetration.
---
I could be wrong,  :)
---
good! now that people see that Bethesda are a bunch of scam artists and one if not the worst company around we can start getting some real changes. at this point Bethesda owes the community a sorry and should be kissing our asses to get us to even give them a moment of time.
---
There's a good reason he hasn't played it in 8 months you moron.
---
No man. Sometimes it puts you in a new world. I left world and joined my private world like 40 times yesterday and a few of those times my owned workshops were gone.
---
lol @ 5
---
Drink vintage nukashine then you will find that and many other picnic locations.
---
I bpught the fridge and was like wtf only 20 items can be stored?
---
I have had no problems
---
No worry, i have 900/370 weight from beta and continue to do it...
---
I have 4k lbs of junk in it and haven’t had any issues *knock on wood* but I also wasn’t affected before the update either
---
I’m sorry, but this is the worst possible way to protest this game. You’re using the product and pushing up their numbers. The only actual way to make a difference is to uninstall.
---
Since he's making no money, and not telling any lies - worst thing Bethesda can do is ask him to hand over the domain name.
---
Rule 4 child.
---
You really don't want PC players in PVP or nuclear winter. Check out some youtube videos from PC about the hackers on N.W. Almost every single NW game on PC has hackers. N.W. has been ruined on PC by exploiters.
---
I wonder how many of those people are Bethesda plants trying to counter the overwhelmingly negative response to FU1st.
---
The point is, I would like to have access to the game I paid for even after they stop supporting the servers or even after I no longer have internet service
---
Oh waaahhh, cry me a freaking river. So what, they changed their minds. You could just quietly go away, not play anymore, and not buy other Bethesda products. This rage bullshit is tiresome. It also makes me want to play 76 even more, just because the thought of people enjoying something you don't, pisses you off, and your anger and angst makes me happy.
---
You spent $300 in two months and yet 15 bucks is your limit ? Holy FUCKING shit ...i hope this is a troll post.
---
I paid £50 for a game that sucks compared to its predecessor, that was released in an awful buggy state, then they added micro-transactions and THEN a subscription service.
---
Why should we have to pay twice for features that should have been part of the game from the start? (and that don't even work properly)
---
The OP wants the FO76 server code running on his own physical server.
---
I really, really doubt that Bethesda will allow that.
---
Grey fox? It can't be
---
The indicator just let you see 0 weight, but not really.
---
Take out bandolier and stack about 10k ammo and you'll see.
---
Uses same code base as other display items I'd imagine, all have 20 limit, just changed the model.
---
Are you talking about multiple amounts of a SINGLE item, or a mass number of individual items?  A stack of 1000 steel is not the same thing as 1000 rocket launchers.
---
And if the amount of an item actually had any impact on server stability, we'd see servers continually crashing from people carrying around tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition (which would also be continually used as you fire weapons).
---
Not gonna lie- I want weightless scrap. Would feel like FO4 again where I could stash as much as I want.
---
Agreed. I think scrap management is an important aspect of the game. Ive been playing since beta, but after getting 5 characters over level 150, ive grown tired of inventory management. I bought the subscription for two reason. One was so i can do vault raids with my friends without lag, the second was the scrapbox. The rest i could honestly care less about.
---
Yes yes yes pleeeeaase!
---
Your analogy just plain sucks.  How does it actually compare to either the scrap box or the survival tent or anything Bethesda has added?   
---
You bought a car (game) and it came with a generic radio as advertised (limited stash space for your scrap).  A year later the dealership calls you up and offers you an upgrade to a satellite radio system (an uncapped scrap box) but although they can install the hardware the actual service comes with a subscription fee.  Now this isn't the BEST example since unlike the scrap box a new radio would give you access to new stations which would be the same as new features, but I'm trying to stick to your car radio analogy.
---
When I saw the pop up upon logging in I thought it was some thank you for original purchases of the game.
---
To be sure it’s a different world you must put something in to the world container first, if it’s gone then it’s different world. I was testing private world last 2 days and wasn’t able to experience ‘used worlds’ and never failed to rejoin my world after swapping characters. I still need to test workshops, testing takes time but it’s possible you can lose them if there is no one on your world similar to paper bag
---
FO76 bad, outer worlds good
---
Or it's like like an open, shared world looter-shooter with survival and RPG mechanics, that doesn't excel at any one of those but creates an interesting experience by blending them and provides a lot of room for emergent gameplay and unique roleplaying.
---
It really sucks cause I love the collecting and camp building aspect of the game. When they added things like the brewing and backpacks, (things that you work for to permanently improve your character) I thought the game would start moving in that direction. I was optimistic, and honestly, I don’t know how we got here. Really sucks.
---
In FO4, wasn't the exterior mostly persistent?  Interiors would replenish, but I think junk in the outside world never did.  I might be remembering it wrong, maybe it just took several in game days to respawn.
---
Either way, junk was definitely harder to scavenge.  My normal routine of going through Pleasant Valley or Harper's Ferry every day to get the same stuff over and over kinda ruins the survival/wasteland aspect of the game.
---
There does seem to be a stock rotation of cosmetics in the Atom shop.
---
Add them to the store, discount then, leaving soon! Rinse and repeat.
---
I bought a year sub. I did it because of people like YOU who are rage trolls and Karma whores. And guess what? I like it! It's fun not having to throw junk away because my stash is full. How does it make you feel? You angry bro, it pisses you off doesn't it?
---
What does wanting a certain flair have to do with age????
---
Well... they should care, but the fact of the matter is they have all the data on their end that they never actually need sob stories on reddit to know when people are quitting.  They can tell how many players they have overall, how often they're logging in, how long they're logging in at a time etc to tell how "healthy" the game is.
---
Don’t fret my friend, you’ll find someone eventually to live out that ‘cuck’ fantasy. 
---
I have faith in you!
---
Uh. No. $10.99.
---
This is a business. Not a charity. Also we're actively trying to destroy all of our good will. So let's releases Skyrim on Android, next.
---
Vampyr is great. If you like it and haven’t played Bloodlines already that’s an even better vampire RPG. A bit on the older side though
---
It's like they're using every monetisation method in the book.
---
Bad publicity from day 1 so they add micro-transactions, then their playerbase slowly dwindles so they try to recoup off the last 'loyal' players.
---
Don't forget the battle royal mode nobody wanted either..
---
All in all, complete failure driven by money.
---
You could stop to play "bugthesda"'s games
---
You are as toxic as the people you are complaining about. You make an antagonizing post and agrue with people in the comments. Shitty post. Have fun arguing and talking shit to people, youre gonna accomplish so much with that. Have a good one, im out
---
What you need those for? They worthless haha
---
they aren't legally bound to a tweet, try again
---
Because they have a mass number of individual items.  If they had 9,999,999 of every scrap item, it wouldn't run any slower than if they only had one of each.
---
Hi my name is "random not in reddit" and I would like one BE gatling plasma. Thank you
---
The bug is said to be a display issue and you should be able to craft with the hidden junk, but some people are claiming that they are indeed losing all of the junk they have stored in the scrapbox.
---
It's something I would like to know also, I want to know if I can subscribe for just one month and fill the box up enough scrap for the year.
---
I’m still not using mine after losing all my junk on Thursday.
---
You said crossplay, I read cosplay... I was going to say when has this not allowed you to dress up like anything?
---
Yeah if it was like $5 I might consider actually paying that.  Or if they separated the private world as a separate charge to make the rest more affordable, I don't see why they have to be bundled if everything works in adventure mode anyway.
---
Same. I was so excited, and then wtf?
---
That would allow posts from people who are actually playing the game to remain visible for a while at least.
---
Good idea, nothing new to be said on the subject really anyway.
---
Things I did: Log in on main, build scrap box, put stuff in scrap box. Log in on alt, build scrap box, put stuff in scrap box. Next day: Log in on main, do my scrip run. Log in on alt, do my scrip run. Notice box is empty. 100% in my own private instance for all of that, didn't use anyone else's scrap box.
---
"Playing the game normally" is what caused it.
---
Have there been any claims that it has been fixed by Bethesda?
---
I’d love some junk.  I lost my junk from all my characters on Thursday. 😬
---
This made me LOL. I never even acquired a BE Gatling plasma in my time playing.
---
But youre the reason the game sucks lol This is an OBVIOUS rip off, bethesda does NOT deserve more money for this trash fire. And now that you bought more broken shit, they will sell you more broken shit. Youre like a person giving heroin to a heroin addict and then wondering how that person died of a heroin overdose. 
---
P.S You think bethesda feels bad for selling you something that is broken, SPOILERS they dont cause you will but anything like a lil lemming.
---
I would appreciate it if the chronic complainers simply uninstalled the game and avoided purchasing Bethesda games ever again. Sitting in the game online wasting bandwidth describing how the game is ruining your life and how Bethesda better listen to your ideas on how to run a company successfully is blarf.
---
"You can pay to do it alone."
---
\- Bethesda
---
Nope. Didn't say that. He was on both cases, as a director/producer. Not as a coder or some creative genius, as I said. He's a glorified PM. He's in deep shit now because he dropped the ball with 76 and is on the hook to recover losses - which is where BS ideas like FO1st comes from. He's a whore and not a very good one.
---
Almost everyone adds paywalls to their games these days, especially if it isn't a full-priced title. Why do you think the game went on discount a week after release? Bethesda thought they could at least get people to buy something off the Atomic Shop if the game was cheaper so they discounted it. They knew exactly how well micro transactions work. This is explained pretty well in the "The Fall of 76" video. If B. didn't implement microtransactions in their game they would have probably made considerably less money than the already extremely poor figures they already had after launch. And an overwhelming majority of the people who bought the game pre-ordered it, making actually knowing what the game was like before buying it impossible. Sure, you can call those who preordered dumb as a box of rocks, but with a franchise as popular as Fallout, people generally had high expectations and hopes, hence all the hype before launch. 
---
TLDR most people preordered and thus had no way to know if the game would be decent or not, and the game had microtransactions from day 1. Bethesda later massively discounted the price to make already existing players spend money in the Atomic Shop.
---
You got it, add me but send me a msg so I remember “in_the_shadows_7”
---
Ahh the old “I know you are but what am I”... seems as though I’m conversing with a child. It makes sense, now go put mommy’s credit card away and learn the value of money.. then you’ll understand. Repeating what I say won’t make you any less of a cuck, I’m glad you’re owning it tho!
---
Am I finally not gonna get down voted for saying Fallout 1 and 2 are the best?
---
When you bought the game you agreed to the terms of service and use which state that when the game is no longer supported you wont have access. Also, 60 bucks for 5 years or more of access is more than fair. Try going out anywhere and getting more than a couple hours of entertainment for that price. You arent a victim, you agreed to it and knew what it was when you bought it. Its the same as every other online game in the world.
---
Yeah, but they also need the goodwill of their consumers. One way to get that is to actually live up to your word. Otherwise your fan base dies a slow and painful death.
---
I definitely have mules, but I moved everything off all my characters into one scrapbox.  Poof it was gone.
---
Why
---
I know. It wont happen.
---
that's one hell of a stretch.
---
I like the photo.
---
Just have to mention the quality and resolution of the game, looking at the picture, it is reminiscent of Fallout 3.
---
My mules are full up on scrap and have hardly any space left because of it. And having to constantly switch between characters to transfer items is a major hassle.
---
Okay, keep getting spoonfed shit, that's your choice dude.  We can lead you to water, but nobody can make you drink.
---
Exactly. I'd like to see some Halloween camp posts or something.
---
Yeah, I do. Because I was starting to like the game again and then they pulled this shit. That’s why people are mad, because they’re smart enough to see that Bethesda is milking their wallet before actually offering anything. This game was $60 remember? By you people paying into 1st, you’re asking for more. And honestly at this point, I think you fools deserve it. I hope they up the price on the 1st memebership. I hope atom shop prices skyrocket. I hope Wastelanders isn’t free. I hope every community suggestion is monetized going forward like they all have been. You guys want it, you deserve it!
---
&gt;Your point would be valid if scavenging for scrap and constantly managing inventory weights were actually entertaining game loops.
---
It actually is for me.  I jokingly call the game Scavenge Simulator because that's basically what I do most of the time.  Same for FO4, basically I spent the endgame trying to build/modify full weapons and armor for every single resident of all my settlements.
---
To each their own I guess.
---
Pulling the gentlemanly douchebag card, are we? We I can do that too. Good day, idiot.
---
Did a quick play through of the game.
---
Now doing a full on every side quest run.
---
Still worth it. Probably not what you wanted to hear.
---
Hey I never said I purchased anything from the atom shop or the subscription. All I said was “you are a cunt for making fun of other people for that”
---
I'm disappointed because I don't have the Halloween bundle in my store. 
---
I probably wouldn't have purchased it but I'd like to see it.
---
You joking?
---
They brought the servers down yesterday for maintenance with little notice, I'd assume it was to address the scrap box.
---
Havent seen any new posts regarding the deletion of items. If I had one, I'd likely still be weary of it.
---
So please community, don’t listen to this prophet tell you what to do with your money. If you enjoy the game and want to buy 1st, go ahead, if you don’t, don’t. Don’t let others tell you how to spend your money.
---
You have to buy Skyrim for the Fallout 76 terminals before you can access the new content.
---
I tried getting into it years ago but never made it far. I might return to it someday.
---
They got hate mail... I’ve been killed a lot and never messaged someone about killing me...lol
---
Thanks, I sent you a PM and I’ll add you when I get on.  Thanks again.  👍
---
I just made mules. Now I use my scrap box.
---
 He wasn't lying, brother ;)
---
Yes you are that is correct, just like I am allowed to call that person a “cunt” for making fun of people for purchasing a service for a game they enjoy.
---
Alright. Cool
---
FO3 was a masterpiece
---
Very true. Ammo weight on the other hand, that’s just a BS mechanic designed to increase the amount of perk cards available.
---
I'm on xbox anyways lol. But yeah that and the fixer are the only god rolls I'm looking for but never got. 
---
Already have BE 25% handmade, BE laser rifle, IE harpoon, Bffr 50 cal, VE combat rifle. Honestly all of them are beaten by my 1 star bloodied plasma rifle with a flamer barrel on it anyways lmao.
---
Also I uninstalled a few days ago so theres that
---
That name is really getting, has got, so old and boring.
---
It's a good game, not a great one. Looks fine, combat is good, companions are reasonably interesting, some interesting NPCs, lots of dialogue options. But... the world areas are small and not very populated. The perks and skills are basic and not too interesting. The facial animations are bland and robotic, which is a bit disappointing for a game heavy on dialogue. I'm enjoying it, but it's not amazing.
---
You’re still white knighting for the dumbest cucks on the planet, which is still pretty lame
---
Hate the player when they support unfair game.
---
Mine has been fine. I have a hunch this maintenance that is coming in 15 min is something else.
---
Please, it’s so hard to try and stay on this sub. I still want to enjoy it the game and all I see is the same posts over and over.
---
1. People who lock their water purifiers and Scrap Collectron Bin.  Keep them open and consider them a gift to people who fast travel to you to cover their travel costs.  You can't clean them out fast enough anyway.
---
2. Gunpowder in vending machine... looks like Mags/Bobble or other cool stuff.
---
3. Camps on cliffs, where we spawn at the wrong top/bottom.
---
4. Really, anyone that locks their doors for no reason.  We can't break your weapon bench, but we would love to use it occasionally.
---
5. Pungi boards.
---
I visit a lot of camps and do a lot of shopping... 1 of the above I can live with, but if you have a Camp on the map with vendors and you intentionally make it uninviting and hostile, I will kill your cow and/or whatever else I can mess up within Pacifist restrictions.  Only once was a camp so vile that we picked the locks, turned pacifist off and hunted down the owner (that was fun).
---
Added, also, no karma needed, don’t think I’m staying on Reddit either
---
It's not just if you play during reset.  If I play NW first before I play Adventure at any time after the reset, it marks certain challenges as complete but doesn't give rewards.  It mostly seems to mark ones that I have previously completed, I'm not sure if that's true 100% of the time though.
---
 brother, don't lose hope ;)
---
The whole cryogenic start did make me lol
---
&gt; at every point possible the thing you already "own" keeps asking for more money
---
To which you say, if you don't thing the more money is worth it:  "no".
---
In this particular case saying "no" loses you nothing.  You still have access to exactly the same game that you had before they asked you for more money.
---
&gt; You stop using the thing you like because somebody else has bought something you didn't want in the game in the first place and you feel that its inclusion weakens the game 
---
The game *I'm* playing after the announcement of FO1ST is *exactly* the same as the game I was playing before.  Nothing has changed.
---
&gt; Indicative of the company's goals misaligning with your own
---
I could give a flying fuck about their goals.
---
There is a game.  I play it.  If they trash the game I'm playing I'll stop.  Adding stuff I don't want to buy doesn't trash my game.
---
Awww a puppet of the industry.
---
Is that what it is?? I've had this at least twice.
---
Same here,played from day one and only carried on waiting for Wastelanders but his debarkle with Fallot 1st is just too far 🤔🤨🤷‍♂️
---
Ah yes, the salt! SO MUCH SALT! HA AH HA HA HA HA HA!

It doesn't matter if someone is a shill or not (and I'm not), if they're right. Don't ignore the message for the messenger. 
---
That's like someone you don't like telling you your shoelace is undone, and tripping on it just to be disagreeable.
---
The problems are real, the criticism is legit, and the number of people noticing is real too.
---
From another angle: social media is giving them data about lost revenue, and they'd be wise to heed it.
---
Because fast travel make you rarely find random encounter after all...
---
I traveled across the map like... many times to sell stuffs. When that times vendor were not gathered at whitespring at all.
---
I was putting stuff in paper bags, a world container and checking world spawn items. Neither of our experiences are enough data to say a definite this is how it works. I 100% was in a different world a few times. I also had a scraping bot show up on one world and I don't own one, i was happy to not be "alone" on that world
---
Like i said, to be safe using a player to anchor the world is a guarantee to get back to the same world
---
That guy not having a flair checks out
---
Specially in 76, the armor is from the Charleston Police Department, as seen on the armor under the trench coat.
---
   
---
He did not lie. Trust me ;)
---
I'd be surprised if when this game hits end of life they don't release the ability.
---
Before that point, it seems extremely unlikely.
---
Could you post a link to your thread on their official board?
---
&gt; Then there would be zero downside to hoarding ALL junk you find.
---
What's the problem with that? That's one of the driving things for me in Fallout 3-NV-4. Find junk, even that I didn't need, and store it in a house. I stopped playing FO76 because there was nothing I needed to do anymore. I could go out and get junk, but no where to put it. I had a balanced store of junk, but playing would have just cost me that in repairs.
---
Too bad you can't control me huh? Can't make me do what YOU want. Kinda sucks to not have absolute control over others doesn't it?
---
That's great so why are you so bothered about what other people chose to do then?
---
Because they throw money at developers for exclusivity for their releases. That usually means that their store has sole exclusivity of a game for 6 months to a year before any other service on PC. Instead of actually improving their launcher/store (which has a fraction of the features of things like the Steam store) they just buy exclusivity for a year. It’s a really scummy way of trying to muscle in on the PC gaming market.
---
They’re basically forcing PC players to use an inferior store/launcher if they want to play certain games.
---
I don’t know if you realize this or not... but there’s only two groups of people who call other people ‘cucks’.
---
So you are either into embarrassment or humiliation kink...  or you are letting your red hat show.
---
With the first - everyone is entitled to whatever gets them off.  Just leave your fantasies out of your discussions with me.
---
The second...  well, it’s fun trolling you types.
---
Haha it’s sad, but getting funnier. You weirdos think you’re cool for letting a corporation cuck you out of all your money for a game that doesn’t even work half the time
---
Meh not really. Best way it to sell purified water to the vendor bots.
---
I have never once had an issue. I'm on PC.
---
It's not that most of us are unhappy really. It that small minority of players that are the loudest and want to have a new mission online to spread their salt on. Ignore the complaints, it's not even a remote sample of the community. Heck Reddit is probably a small sliver of the actual game community in reality. If the majority didn't like it then bes wouldn't be profitable.
---
Nope just not taking your toxic bait, loser
---
The only thing noteworthy is an orange smoke/fog machine
---
Evolution LMFAO. Yeah gating features that are literally in the game files since day 1 behind a paywall cause BGS is a bunch of greedy cunts is considered “evolution”.
---
Whiteknights of this game put up a pathetic defense. I’ve heard way more convincing arguments even in pay2win f2p MMOs.
---
Get ready for the bandwagon of hate to stop in on your post.
---
STHAP the joke bruh XD 
---
(I'm laughing so frickin' hard now)
---
I mean, devs or publishers don't care about little messages in the game. They care about the numbers. Numbers meaning people not playing their game at all. That achieves nothing apart from stroking one's ego that they're doing the right thing.
---
You seem like a cunt
---
And don't you think it's a little weird? ;)
---
In Borderlands you can mark weapons as junk and then hit "sell all junk" at a vendor.  Something like that would be cool here; sell all junk or scrap all junk, or both options.
---
What's this game you speak of? Must be an indi title
---
Finally something all the factions can do! Us responders look forward to working with the brotherhood, enclave, and all others. Come and protect your wasteland today!
---
Even a scrap box with a 500 limit would be okay for non 1 users
---
 I can live with the Atomic Shop. Sure, everything in it is extremely overpriced, but at least It's mostly cosmetic. Plus you can earn everything for free, and the gameplay stuff doesn't really hurt anyone. 
---
I'm mostly referring to Fallout 1st. If you buy Fallout 1st you are supporting lies and putting features that were said to be free behind a paywall. They've acted like they couldn't increase the stash limit and then release the scrapbox. 
---
I did preorder the game because I had faith in Bethesda and liked the concept of an online Fallout game. It will be the first and last time I pre-order a video game, especially from Bethesda.
---
It's a hundred bucks. Seriously. 
---
And this game does work, I've had very few issues with it. Sounds to me like you're not actually a player. Least not on PC you aren't.
---
In terms of bringing fallout to 3D? Yes I agree with that and it’s open world. It’s story was awful. NV though killed 3 in every way possible and really built out the world the way it should have been with immense player choice and consequences.
---
Agreed; I just believe that the blame should be doled out specifically and accurately to the relevant parties.
---
Yeah sorry, I had my graphics turned down because I was also running a heavy 3D program for work at the time. I was clearing out the workshop so I could collect steel while I worked.
---
Because I don't have any in game friends to act as an intermediary
---
15 use at times on amazon
---
How did you transfer stuff, like logging two devices, two accounts?
---
Omg this!!!!
---
Me:  hey Guys I really want to go to bed early tonight so I only have about an hour to play. 
---
45 min later
---
Friend: I still can’t fast travel yet. Hold on I’m just going to walk to the train station. 
---
Me: ok hurry up I want to play 
---
Another 45min 
---
Yea we are finally doing something and I really got to go to bed.
---
I just dont understand how we are nearly a year into Fallout 76 and people dont seem to understand that the game is a survival sim and not a traditional entry.
---
I'm not really bothered.
---
I'm annoyed by the lack of logic and the ridiculous number of people (not you) who are lying.   It's pretty clear that a large number of people talking about boycotting the game don't play it, or in some cases have never have played it.
---
I have bird bones. We stand side by side and he jumps higher.
---
Was actually thinking of leaving this sub just so I didn’t have to see all those posts anymore. Was getting tiresome. This would be a much nicer alternative.
---
Lol! Plasma rifles are fun, yeah my mentality is if I’m not going to make use of it then might as well give it away. I don’t take games seriously and I would rather make an actual persons day vs helping a “trader” acquire items they only intend to profit from.
---
Exactly, I'd rather pay for not having a scrapbox. So why complain about ability to ruin the game for yourself for money?
---
I'll try
---
Don't lose hope brother ;)
---
Anybody who expects Bethesda to release something that isnt completely broken is an idiot.  Releasing broken stuff and not fixing it or expecting other to is their thing.  They have been doing it for 25+ years.
---
Lol whales that pay into first get a private server, an unlimited stash box and exclusive cosmetics, atoms (so you don’t have to grind challenges) all things to make the game more convenient to play. You literally made the perfect analogy and then said it’s not that
---
There’s only one group of people who are cucks and you’re in it. I know the truth can be hard to swallow, but it’s clear that you enjoy paying money to be fucked. It’s not that hard to understand, but it’s apparent now that I’m arguing with a child so I’ll let it slide.
---
Does the Scrapper peek affect your chance to learn a mod?  I thought it just gave you more of the primary resource.
---
It will be, look Bethesda can be dumb but not stupid, why would they even do that. Is a DLC of course it will be free. There's a difference between microtransactions, the subscription and a DLC.
---
To anyone reading this, if you don’t leave a msg about what you need I WILL NOT add you, thank you
---
Cause I’m a gurl? Rude
---
aaahahahahahah
---
Don't publishers deserve the same amount of scrutiny as the developers though? Why are you giving Zenimax a free pass on the monetisation? Either they're both to blame, or Zenimax is to blame.
---
Serious question here, not knocking you at all just asking... 
---
How can you be cap poor in Fallout? 
---
You can  1400 caps alone from robot vendors selling them pretty much anything. 
---
If your prices and location are good you can sell players literally everything. 
---
Super Mutants drop caps...
---
WV Lumber has at least 16 super mutants that are low level... go kill then, take everything and sell their guns to a vendor... boom, instant caps.  That’s just one location.
---
But why? There are so many people that work for their money that need to be told how to spend it. You can take your logic and go elsewhere, fine day to you,!
---
No.  It's a poor way to get XP or caps even if you win every match. You'd get more in adventure just doing quests and making stuff to sell in a vending machine.
---
Conversely, I should not have to scrap 300 tons of junk to get the 34 screws I need for my first set of excavator armor.
---
They're features, not bugs. The radiation is what causes all of your items to disappear, silly.
---
Prepare to be disappointed.
---
Think we are all feeling the love all over to world too.
---
isn't karma on the trade subs?
---
Socialist!!! Oh wait, wrong forum lol well said
---
Yeah people seriously hoard hundreds of god roll items just for the sake of hoarding them. I have my own little collection of all the bloodied weapons I find fun but I'm not holding on to any vampire or vanguard or bolstering shit as it doesnt interest me. Might as well give it to someone who will use it like you said
---
Mules are a pain to use and you can only have a certain amount of characters.
---
So is that saying each item is rewarded by the event directly across from it?  Or that any of the item for the region, can drop from any of the events on the right (in that region)?
---
Ditto. Playing Fallout 76 was such a massive shit show for me yesterday that I had to remind myself my husband bought the game and breakong the disc is a no go, but you know what I did? Upvoted some stuff on this subreddit and went over to Fallout 4 for a bit. Death threats are a no go.
---
If it is it just goes to show how much I don’t know about Reddit 😂
---
$100 is A LOT to ask for this game. $60 was a lot to ask, but $100 after that lmao enjoy your game pay pig. I love how you lot always default to “you don’t play it!” Like bitch, the people who played it from the beginning know how horrible it was and still is and have every right to be pissed that they would want more money from you haha
---
Reply of the day awarded to you !
---
You tried Gtao or played because I see so much wrong in your argument
---
It affects them coz I am a premium user
---
Tldr
---
What do you think you achieve with this?
---
You are part of the problem. Private servers are the exact same experience except you are all alone. Are people really an issue in this game? Combat is entirely avoidable if you want and they can't really steal stuff from you because everyone gets their own loot from enemies.
---
This means you already paid so they got your money anyway.
---
I'd just delete your account and move on, no one is going to really appreciate free stuff anyway, random people you don't know and will never know.
---
This just looks like a **LOOK AT ME** post to be honest.
---
I want a pony!
---
not going to happen, once you leave the server someone else gets the server.
---
NV was good but it was literally just fallout 3 with it's most popular mods built in. I thought FO3s story was alright. Also its DLC were better in 3 than NV in my opinion as well. FO3 had a lot of player choice too, just not as obvious.
---
Then just add anti cheat
---
Friend helped
---
Darn :( okay then
---
I'm just buying it because I like to play without all these asses gunking up my game, for those real angry, I just bought it for my daughter and son on their live accounts too. Hell, may get it for the wife just because I can haha.
---
I got it a month after it released. Because I wanted to see what the reviews were like, when it got totally panned then I bought it, because when EVERYONE online hates something, it's usually pretty good.
---
Well, yeah.
---
&gt; Was actually thinking of leaving this sub just so I didn’t have to see all those posts anymore
---
I unsubbed.  Tired of seeing angry bullshit filling up my front page.  The horse is dead and has been for a while now.
---
It’s right next to my camp lol. Spawns two radroaches, a witches hat, a pumpkin and a cooler with random food. It’s on the cliffs just above camp venture. If you’re in camp venture head west/northwest until you reach a sheer cliff. Following the base of the cliff north will get you to a walkable slope. There’ll be a high tension power line pylon to the north, turn south at the top of the cliff and there will be your witches picnic by a large tree. If my camp is there stop by n say hello.
---
I agree with that. Starting out it took me a while to learn but just the other day I spent all but 80 of my caps and through maxing my vendor and selling at my own camp I had 6k in an hour. Some things aren't worth having there for ages just for 50-100 extra caps.
---
Sweden is 25%, too.
---
Maintenance is coming again?
---
that's putting it lightly
---
I don’t like being called dumb.  It’s not kind. I got this for unlimited scrap space and grief-free courier jobs.  No I’m not happy with what I purchased.  Is it awsome yet? No.  But dumb? I don’t think so.
---
Putting in ink a hard truth that everyone besides the most badly deluded of fanboys are thinking. Unrealistic hope is that people who feel similarly (and this sub is full of them) will respond positively and this will be one of the many harsh posts that Bethesda’s community managers encounter and that such strong negative feedback will eventually result in positive change for the game. But that’s my unrealistic wishful thinking.
---
haha better than this shit show
---
Hey look another pissed off braindead white knight unable to come up with a logical argument that a 2 year old can comprehend. Nothing to see here, move along. You mad cause the game you put half your savings into is a pile of shit? Maybe you should buy more cash shop currency or a statue of Todd’s dick to calm you down.
---
They said everything would be free. They lied. They are charging you 100 dollars for simple features that they said would be free. It's optional, but now you will never get any of that content without supporting their scam. Buy purchasing it you tell Bethesda "I know you have lied countless times, but I'm okay with that. I will continue purchasing your product even if you lie to me over and over." So they will continue lying and putting supposedly free features behind a paid subscription.
---
Ok well you replied to me talking to someone about the UK price. I'm sorry if it is that much in your region, I'm not buying it obviously, I haven't played this game at all in like 10 months... but generally speaking this happens with all digital sales, they'll apply VAT (possibly from what other people are saying in the thread in the EU they chose the highest VAT % and applied it everywhere, which does sound likely) and then will round up to the closest store price point, say with VAT applied it brings the conversion to $112 they will round it up to €119.99 or if it was €3.50 it would go up to €4.99 it is just how it's always worked, whether you're buying microtransactions for a mobile game or any DLC or season pass on console or PC
---
(By the way I'm totally not defending the ridiculous price of this "season pass" nor am I defending Bethesda, I lost interest in this game a long time ago but have been keeping tabs on stuff on here to see if it would be worth revisiting. The title of this thread just caught my attention and then I wanted to point out that people are in here getting outraged at Bethesda about something beyond their control (VAT) and something that has been basic practice on all digital sales (the rounding up of prices) since digital sales began.)
---
Wait, you guys are trying to say that this game is NOT an inventory management simulator?
---
I 100% agree, and was thinking the same thing. It's like when you use cheat codes on games. You think it'll be great, but after playing as invicible for a while you learn how boring it is as there is no challenge. In this instance you would QUICKLY get to a place where you would have more scrap than you could ever use. You would have infinite ammo so to speak. Then you would have Max caps after buying everything possible (if you haven't already). You would have no reason to loot mobs ( except looking for legendaries) and would completely stop getting scrap, no need for workshops either. That really is some of the core parts of the game! If you just want to shoot mobs with no inventory management there are loads better games for this. Ty for posting this cause I don't think people buying it will realize until a few weeks or month in how lame it will be.
---
That's actually a better idea then what they did.
---
But those ideas can exist in any society, look at communism, fascism, or imperialism. All three of those had mass genocide against certain groups. 
---
The idea that the human next to you doesn't have value is pandemic to all nations of all political types. The fix for this is to instill morals and values in your people that the human next to you is worthy of living a happy life however they chose. My argument isn't that capitalism is good, but that systems suck because humans suck. 
---
In my opinion, capitalism is the growth engine, and we need to put socialistic policies on top or surrounding it to keep cancerous growth from forming. Look at the police or firefighters, they are socialistic because everyone pays for them.
---
To single out capitalism as the bad thing is intellectually shooting yourself in the foot
---
I don't think so. I spent around 120 hours playing F76 and had quite a bit of fun with many of them. There is just around zero replayability and it gets boring once you finish the relatively few quests.
---
No worries, now you can play a game that doesn’t suck
---
25% in norway
---
You're funny. It was multiple presentations.
---
&gt; As a programmer I can confirm. 
---
Hey, here's a fun thought from a fellow programmer: the way that they have been rolling back fixes and reintroducing bugs indicates that they're not using version control.
---
It's the obsession with all the cutesy Mr Fuzzy bullshit lmao. It's a wasteland, not disneyland
---
Maybe they didn't buy enough copies of *Skyrim* way back when...
---
But there’s no content you’re missing, neither private sessions or scrap boxes are content.  Whether they make the game easier or not is debatable but there’s no actual content with the subscription
---
More to the point, if I decide to stop using an online service or stop playing a game I just stop, I don't feel the need to broadcast this to the world.
---
Most of this is a chance to whine and complain and probably just *look at me* behaviour.
---
Wow, I feel you. I had a similar (but much less elaborate) 'tent' camp in the same position on a level 5 alt char that has also been deleted. I know I can redo it but...ugggh I'm a weirdo perfectionist and the idea of re-placing 275 individual flower boxes is a bit rage inducing. 😂 In addition to the fact that I loved that location as it was super unique and perfect for helping out new players. Along with the p2w BS -- I'm playing Outer Worlds this weekend. Just can't face starting over yet although I love building.
---
Not exactly lol everyone was right to be suspicious of this game and they were right to trash it and write it off
---
What i notice if i leave and cime back in 30 minutes i still keep workbenches
---
You’ll keep it as long you’re online. Just go afk and either set a controller to spin your character around with an elastic band so you don’t get kicked or logged out for being afk, or use a folded up by piece of paper or paper clip or whatever to keep a key pressed down on the keyboard.
---
Yeh, for the budget and scope of this game I feel like Obsidian did an amazing job, but it makes me wonder what it could have been like with twice the time/budget. Honestly I wouldn't want the game to be any bigger than it is, I think the size is fine, but I would love to see the graphics, animation, and AI all fleshed out more than they are. Plus more romancing quests and outer space side missions (coming across random encounters between worlds etc, ship salvage/ pirates, that sort of thing would be rad)
---
Fallout 1st doesn't even need a name, the update could have simply reduced scrap weight to 0, private world in the options menu and added the ranger outfit and tent to the Atom shop.
---
Sorry, we don't have 48% tax. So no.
---
The thing is though, their strategy for most of their screw ups has been to completely ignore it until they absolutely can’t, which is at e3. I do admit they were making small slow changes players asked for, but recently they’ve only listened to ideas that they can monetize(Fridge, ranger outfit, unlimited scrap storage, second camp) Patience can be earned by showing us they have something worth waiting for, and when they delay the one update that would make this game worth its price tag, and instead push a subscription out for ideas community suggested behind a $13 a month paywall, players have a right to be frustrated.
---
I disagree. This is one mans opinion but inventory management has always been an item in the fallout (and further, the rpg) universe. Without it we have a game where there is no reason to engage yourself as deeply in each new explored area. Yes the pip-boy is a bit of a pain, but with it we find a system that encourages us to role play, and gauge what we can safely bring home. It makes me imagine a world where resources are scarce, and where every decision determines our likelihood of surviving within it. One that says says “yes you can limp back with all of this scrap, but we have bigger things to worry about. “
---
I have missed the apocalypse but I imagined it a little differently. Scrap gives us a purposeZ you want to fix that handmade rifle? Better find some aluminum, etc.
---
I agree, but still don't spend that long. You'll still spend time even with this scrap box. Just go to workstation, scrap junk, create bundles and toss in storage. Takes 2 minutes. But I do still think overall too much time is spent in inventory management, but that is the flaw in the original game
---
Well get used to it. You bought a premium subscription for a game which initially promised there wouldn’t be one to gain access to features that should have been part of the base game and included with that price from a developer/publisher that has had the worst operating track record of any modern AAA game (rivaled only by Anthem). Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
---
But you should still get your money back and should still get the features you want for free.
---
I don't like weight restricted inventories in general. Just give me X number of slots and let me manage that way. Making it based on weight inevitably means I'm going to get frustrated micromanaging my inventory and will just ignore the movement speed penalty entirely because it's easier.
---
yeah, just like 1,000 posts before you
---
Now the floating Enterprise  is pretty cool.
---
Ouch i dont fast travel but no running sucks
---
Your toxic ad hominem aside, maybe Bethesda will deliver the product as advertised/promoted when they said they wouldn't do that.
---
Cheers.
---
Is Outer Worlds fun? Anyone playing it?
---
Okay
---
I do like me some trollin’ of the red hat types. 
---
I’m surprised you’ve kept responding - normally that internalized anger from your lack of winnaring in the ‘discussion’ boils over into acting like a monkey in the zoo flinging poo.
---
I am highly disappointed that your vocab is limited to a single insult though.
---
FO76 has a great story, if you take the time to read quests, notes and terminals.
---
Not 100% accurate. Nuke ws, quit and log back in right away. You'll see nuke remains active but with new mobs. So there are some things not fully reset and you keep your session to some extent.
---
Sorry, I didn't know what you meant when you said "1st". A quick google search enlightened me. I do agree with you that buying something like that is idiotic. Didn't take me long to prove that i'm an idiot
---
Yeah, it's either, "these clowns really incompetent at programming, or they're lying". In all honesty though when it comes to Bethesda games, either one could be true.
---
Because purchasing it means they will continue making these scams. By purchasing it you are telling them they should keep making it. Anyone who says they should keep lying and putting simple features behind a paywall is an enemy of consumers, the Fallout franchise, and gaming as a whole. They are encouraging lies and manipulation.
---
I never noticed an increase in learning mods while using the scrapper perk, but this RNG stuff is mostly subjective with no real way or obtaining true data.
---
breaks the damage increasing prefixes when reloading standing upright. 
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=uRaiufUMdWw
---
And?
---
Definitely think scrap needs weight but I also think stash boxes should be abled to be upgraded multiple times as you progress through the game. 
---
Just a damn shame the servers can't handle it.
---
it’s generic, come up with some new ideas lol
---
If you don’t enjoy this game why play it? I’ve been playing since BETA with my wife and brother.  We’ve put hundreds of hours into this game.  Although a lot of it was earlier on, now that we are high level with gear it’s definitely slower paced.  However, we still play a few times a week.  With that in mind the developers have more than delivered enough content for us to be happy for our 60 dollar investments.  What do you expect?  To never run out of content for 60 dollars or less of you bought the game on sale?  People have very unrealistic expectations.
---
If you're on PS4 I can help you.
---
The atom shop stuff came back all with a discount the 23th October so maybe in one month it will be back idk. Idk what tse means but all guns are worth, the scrap box is irrelevant the private servers are the best thing of the subscription (and no, the subscription is not pay to win), and I think it will be worth to comeback. Even on a PS4 the game has a good performance at least for me, I have 0 disconnects. And while you were off the game Bethesda added a lot of stuff thanks to the Nuclear winter DLC. And also if you ask, that repair kits, scrap kits etc... It's worthless you can do betterment stuff by just playing the game.
---
See you on the Appalachian wasteland.
---
Exactly. This guy gets it.
---
&gt;people talk about how it's the best deal they've done, you get so many atoms and it's quite cheap.

---
Oh but the answer to ops question was correct, I was on a different topic. The workstations are gone for sure
---
Guess what? Son you'll get to a point where there is zero need to loot mobs or grab any scrap. That seems even stupider IMO
---
I don't really want to keep my computer on when I go to bed. But I guess that's what you get for trying out fallout first. Make the players figure out how to keep the workshops keepable in our private severs. Hahaha
---
Who gives a shit? An idea doesn’t have to be new to be valid.
---
Yeah all those things would be nice additions.
---
I am only level 27 I only get a few caps per weapon also I have farmed super mutants and I don't seem to get very many caps from them. But ill def try farming a location until I fill up then go vendor it at a robot.
---
This \^\^
---
I mean, to come up with some new points.
---
Do you farm the water at your camp?
---
But it good for your health and raise the game handicap like... much.
---
It deleted all my scrap and still haven’t got it back. I’ve started using it again after the fix but I’m not putting harder to find scrap in just yet. See how it goes before I trust putting everything back in.
---
Well Star Citizen is a purgatory. It's neither honest about what it'll be or dishonest because it'll probably never come out. They could be working on exactly what they're saying, but we'll never know.
---
Damn... that include Nintendo too?
---
And you somehow think your opinion matters any more then the 100s of other pointless “I quit” posts here from the last week?
---
Why? Again, who gives a shit? The points are being repeated because they’re true and concern egregious behavior.
---
It's not an idea if it's already been said a 1000 times, it's just a repeated comment
---
I don’t care what it looks like or what people think, if you knew what I had or what I’ve been offered you’d understand but I don’t have time to explain.
---
But it's still gonna be free and we have time to mine more void opal.
---
Yeah a shit ton of it
---
Locked doors.. like really why? 
---
And the camp occupying my camp space. (Except when it is cooler then mine)
---
Who cares if a comment is repeated? The fact that you don’t like seeing them doesn’t make them less accurate.
---
Bump!
---
It's campy
---
I never said “I quit.” Learn to read, dumbass.
---
&gt;Each time you level up you get 1 point to put into a special. You also get to choose a new perk, but remember you don't have to choose a perk that corresponds with the special attribute you picked. For example, you can put 1 Point into strength but then choose a intelligence perk.
---
Super important and useful info, I got tied up in all kinds of knots not realising this and had to finally spend more points after level 50 sorting out the mess.
---
Okay, bye, I guess?
---
“Winnaring”? Really? You’re gonna insult my vocabulary and the make up a word, that’s pretty rich even from someone as delusional as you. Also I’m a Bernie supporter but I don’t see how that’s relevant. 
---
You enjoy having gaming companies overcharge you for services that should be free, it’s not that there aren’t more words to describe you it’s just that cuck is such a perfect example and obviously triggers you so I’ll keep saying it till you see the truth.
---
What happened to being done with the argument? You came back to try and get more upvotes from your kin who agree, so yeah.
---
Definitely not, censoring people’s views on a thing Bethesda added to the game is not cool.
---
Comments from an actual educated player! I never need glass, rubber, crystal, and many many more. If I do there is an infinite supply called the game world. I hope people realize after building up all this scrap that most of it just does that, build up
---
no
---
Much better then what we used to.
---
Well considering how well this game is doing I have a good feeling Microsoft is gonna throw a ton of cash at obsidian for the sequel, so look forward to it.
---
I think what he means is if the first 1000 comments before this one didn’t change anyone’s mind, this one shouldn’t change anyone’s as well.  His suggestion of a new point could shed new light on the situation.  So far people have quit, people have subscribed but the vast majority of players don’t give a shit either way and will play the way the exact same as they did last week.
---
*quietly looks around before raising hand*
---
Such an awful sub
---
Durability alone. You can have same exact gun with 1% less durability and it'd have to be tracked separately. Then same exact gun with just different barrel, then that different barrel gun with 1% less durability, etc.
---
Additionally food would be weird to store. It has durability that decays in real time even in storage.
---
So the entire idea of "retired posts" should be removed then?
---
I need them to make serums, lol
---
I actually messaged the mods about this very thing - they’re doing their best to try and keep it under control.  
---
Report/flag the posts that are the usual “I quit” and “fuck Bethesda” types so they can be quickly noticed and deleted.  
---
They show up differently for mods when people are reporting them.
---
The same with getting fusion cores, set up both the power plants and farm while you're asleep
---
Its way out of hand honestly.
---
Idea, play a different game that doesn't have shit mechanics that you have to spend hours on a work around.
---
Saturday afrtoon comics are out early today.
---
&gt;"these clowns are really incompetent at programming, ~~or~~ *and* they're lying"
---
If I know Bethesda, anyway.
---
A link that leads to a quote from them stating that the stuff would be free would be nice.
---
I don’t care about the number of minds changed. Accurate information is accurate information. If they want to stick their heads in the sand and ignore all criticism that’s their business. In the meantime, water is wet, 2+2=4, Fallout First should be free to all players.
---
There is music in the atomic shop? Where?
---
I know what you mean.. I'm afraid to say anything positive around here lately.. thinking I'm going to be chased down the road with pitch forks lol
---
I shoot my shot..you have any tse weapon. My psn is rapperace. 
---
&gt; we had a camp building limit in Fallout 4 for reasons related to game stability
---
By the way, that limit was much lower than it needed to be (if it even needed to be). I even played on console and FREQUENTLY used the glitch to increase that limit. Stability never really decreased.
---
I have. 3 out of my 5 toons are, all 3 are over 1000. Techically my other 2 are too, but a shot of buffout or a piece of radstag fixes that. On my highest level character, although I have just recently got my 5th piece of WWR, with all my weight reduction perks, deep pocketed armor, and wwr armor pieces couldn't get me to FT weight. (My other 2 I haven't leveled up any WR cards)
---
I just can't let weapons go, I mean I was a hoarder in 4 but exploited the hell out of stretching my companions carry capacity. 
---
Also I preferred survival mode so I'm used to not fast travelling (my last play through I haven't even rescued Nick yet) 
---
However the limitations of being so are not lost on me. As a level ~140 I know that it doesn't make sense to launch scorched earth. I never could make it to prime before people killed the queen. Attending most events are out, if I'm not close by I won't make it.
---
I now see why so many Youtubers are mocking the idiots on this subreddit. 
---
The amount of posts I see defending Microtransaction or trying to justify the Fuck your first subscription fee is hilariously
---
None, sorry, but I have other weapons if you’re starting out, never liked the TSE’s so I didn’t really collect them after the nerf
---
Not me, one of the biggest disappointments I've had yet. Blew through 1k script in 5 minutes and got squat
---
I expected the game to work at launch. I expected the game to have interesting quests and characters. I expected Fallout. Cause I like the Fallout universe I paid $80 for the whatever edition and got broken garbage with nothing interesting to do. Are there quests? Yeah. But they’re all fucking boring fetch quests that exist to inconvenience you and send you around the map in the dumbest ways, because they want to waste your time and keep you playing. This game adds nothing cool to the Fallout lore, it even ruins it! The Scorched are the worst antagonist in any fallout ever and the new cryptids range from meh to aight. It’s just the worst. ESO is trash too, but at least it feels in sync with the other games. 76 feels like mobile game fan service dogshit

'Hey there asshole, this is raider radio'
---
I don't understand what you wrote but fair enough regardless, good luck!
---
My favourite posts were the ones that started "I've never actually played the game or had any interest in it, but my view is...."
---
I’ve started reading more posts on the other subs. They’ve got it right and there’s not loads of hate posts going on. I know everyone can voice their own opinion but when it’s just lots of the same hate post and name calling of the players who subscribed to Fallout 1st. Well who wants to read that and especially when it’s mostly people just trolling.  Surely they could keep it to one sticky thread at the top and for those that feel the need to vent, then they can and it’s not taking over the normal posts.
---
It is
---
When I see those kinda CAMPs I always ask them "How are you able to sleep in-game out in the open and not worry about enemies attacking you?".
---
You are mistaken, I love this shit, check my post history, I've never engaged this much in the years I've been on Reddit lol. I love seeing people complain about something they can't have for whatever reason. 13 USD a month is a joke, I spend twice that on lunch every day. I play 76 for hours a day and to have a world to myself for 13 dollars is an automatic decision for me. I've already gotten my money out of it. Please continue to share your ideas, I'm sure it's helping the cause you are part of. I expect the next board meeting will probably have a ppt with every complaint listed on this Reddit on a slide and they will pull metrics on how many upvotes the complaints got and restructure their profit goals accordingly. Actually, your post has caused me to rethink my entire stance on the game, BES is bad! I want my money back and everyone who plays it is dumb! Can I be part of the team now?
---
I didn’t realize the depths of insanity that y’all fanboys had fallen too. Here is a post who’s ultimate conclusion is to make First features free, give subscribers refunds, and to add mod support and yet somehow you’ve become so insulated to criticism that you OPPOSE consumer friendly practices?
---
It'd be hard for them to not realize that what they're saying is BS. Maybe the PR people who actually said it wouldn't know, but that's because they never even ran it by the tech people or the tech people lied or the PR people got the answer then went with a lie anyway.
---
I think it’s because they’re putting game changing features behind a paywall, even though they said they wouldn’t.
---
Well if you’re talking about long periods of time like that, you can just lose the workshop and take it the next day. They’re easy to take. You only need to keep a workshop if you’re going to check in every 20 minutes to collect from extractors.
---
Oh LOL I get you, I was obsessing over the weird textures :D
---
So that’s what they do? Well I’ll be damned
---
You on Xbox?
---
Then people would complain it’s too grindy to keep up with lol
---
I remember back when the infinite carry weight bug was going on i was mindlessly grabbing things
---
"literally in the game files" lol
---
This must be one of your first games you've ever played, because stuff like this has been happening for years.
---
They already said that this is a feature that's coming.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch
---
On a related note, another thing to keep in mind with Fallout 3 nostalgia, something that I came to terms with in regards to Bioware and their fall from grace since ME2(ish): the company that exists today, though it may have the same name, is not the same company that made the game you love in pretty much all the ways that really matter. The developers, which is to say the actual individuals that coded Fallout 3, are most likely not working there any more. The writers, designers, artists etc. are all different. The executives at the top holding the purse strings are different, with different goals and ambitions. The parent company is different, with different mandates and projections.
---
It's kind of like asking someone to bake a cake you remember enjoying from your childhood, but when you show them your cupboard, all you have are the ingredients for a lasagna. It's possible they could make something others might like, but the chances of it being anything like the thing you actually wanted are slim to nil.
---
Interesting I’m curious if this will ever happened to me
---
If you’re not concerned with changing someone’s mind or opinion of the game.  Why post a lengthy opinion on the current state of the game that provides no new information.  Wouldn’t it be easier to just quit or not log in for awhile?
---
Only thing i can swe game changing is the scrap box
---
or make a mega thread, that way no one can cry censorship but the sub can still be clean
---
Ive legit unistalled the game. It was actually kinda frustrating because i genuinely enjoyed playing the game i made alot of good friends by playing. But this was the last straw for me.
---
You really do need to expand your vocabulary...  winnaring and winraring, two terms that have been around for quite a while, and definitely not ones I just made up.  
---
But seriously though - your whole cuck fantasy thing...  I already told you you aren’t my type.
---
Better, actually
---
That old man is still kicking? Good for him
---
&gt; not going to happen
---
From Bethesda themselves:
---
&gt;Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to private worlds in the future.
---
So not only do I pay for a PS server, but now I need to pay for a seperate server as well? How come other MP games can allow me to have solo/invite only sessions, but Bethesda can't?
---
I'll start reporting them, I thought that was a bit frowned upon except in extreme circumstances, cheers!
---
Looks like your dog is about to die, lucky for him!
---
I’m sorry you’re spending $26 on lunch? Daily? Like, if that’s true then this is hilariously out of touch. I have to limit my lunch prices to $7 each day and sometimes I have to skip. $13 a month is kind of a big deal if you’re paycheck to paycheck. It’s an even bigger deal when you were initially promised that you would never have to pay a subscription to access basic features.
---
I ran into that guy and his wife in a game, seemed nice so i dropped them some schematics XD
---
It's not a server, but sure it isn't going to be free.
---
Kinda late to the game though, it's a done deal (and always was, really).
---
You can't excercise a bit of self control and it's everybody else's fault except yours. Got it.
---
Dunno what you're talking about. All the best games come out of China and Venezuela. Haven't you noticed?
---
Each item under the color coded bar has a chance to drop from any of the events listed under the same color bar which is the list of events across from the outfits.
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED!
---
I have defended this game often.  I paid for a full year of the subscription to support the game.  Having said that, this game is now dead to me.  Here are the problems I an finding, some of which are due to the private servers:
---
(1) There is no one to group with.
---
(2) Communication is difficult.  Emotes don't get it done, and most people don't have voice going so you just stand there and gesticulate trying to get something going.  The PC version of the game should have some sort of chat option.  I know that's not very feasible with console platforms, but I am here to socialize, and it's dead.
---
(3) Halloween events are interesting, but I've failed everyone of them.  No one to group with and they are hard.  Maybe I suck.  I'm new to it, so it's entirely possible I just plain suck, but there is no joy here.
---
If you want an online version of a game, you certainly don't have to have a text based chat system, but it's killing this game for me.  I feel like I'm paying money to play by myself, fail often, and in general not enjoy the game.
---
I'm disappointed.  Seems like this game is nothing but a pure cash grab.  Everything in the store is over priced.  They try to do just enough to keep people paying.  I can walk away from this saying "no more bethesda products ever again".  I'm already a no more EA games person.  Hopefully enough people will vote with their wallets so that we get better quality.  FO76 ain't it.
---
I’ve had that same super mutant glitch at Grafton Steel. He just sits there. We took a family photo with him. His name is Graig.

Uh I hope ten year olds don't sexualize anthropomorphic animals
---
Although I would like a solo NW mode, it will separate players and make it even harder to find lobbies, especially for PC.
---
How dare you go to the atomic shop and even consider buying something! /s
---
Wrong.  They never promised that.
---
I did play gtao and it got pretty grindy and the only real way to make money is to do the heists which were more annoying than entertaining but that is a personal opinion and not a fact. It took quite a bit of time to fill teams. It might be just that not having a full group of friends playing with you at all times on gtao makes it less fun but you cannot deny that aside from grinding the heists for weeks the only way to afford the big buildings or nice cars or poweful weapons is to buy the shark cards. I think one of the nicer business buildings is like 50 million or something right? That is like a couple months of grinding or 100 usd and yes I just checked the price for the 58 million megalodon card. That is 100 big ones for a business to grind more heists or to launder money and like a couple decent cars but still. A big carrier base truck costs over 7 mil just for the basic details i think too.
---
Oh, you mean like the backpack every whale was complaining about having to "grind" for? Yet the regular folks didn't have a problem with it?? Huh, who knew you may potentially satisfy both parties by making a something grindy possible through monetization....
---
Response to your title, Probably for the best..
---
Crazy masochists.
---
Btw the reason most online games ignore ammo nowadays, (e.g. Wow) because its just annoying
---
I mean, at best its a "ok-ish" inventory managemanet simulator, i have seen better and i have seen worse, but that aspect of the "game" is great!
---
Yeah true
---
You could only see this as a “conspiracy theory” if you have no fundamentals of programming, databases or server admin. But now that you can suddenly pay to have the unlimited storage, I’m not sure why you act like this wasn’t the case all along.
---
For many, this was very simple server design architecture. Which actually has very little with whatever engine their using or their “code” as you so simplistically put it.
---
https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1032332835896602625?s=19

There's one. They've said it elsewhere I'm sure.
---
There are many method that increase your ap regen just for that. I once tried to rushed from whitespring to sbq and succeed.
---
I basically use ap 45% refill ap perk. A couple ap regen drink and rejuvenation. A jetpack power armor for passing obstacles and landing because applachian mountain environment.
---
After brewing patch, walking to find lemonade stand, discover right after the next day. Able to learn lemonade and hard lemonade, rushing region now too easy. 
---
I used "toggle to run" wisely so it didn't screwed up ap regen.
---
I thought that too initially.   On one of the subreddits I run, we have the automod set up to temp moderate posts with high report rate, and anything with one or two reports gets a tag next to it only the mods can see.
---
Can easily go through the subreddit set to sort new and make quick decisions.  
---
I imagine the mods here have something similar.  Though their volume of deletions must be in the thousands at this point...
---
The dickheads I’m explaining!!! 👋🏻
---
Stinging Mag = Better armor penetraton larger ammo capacity (slightly)
---
Perforating Mag = Best armor penetration no ammo capacity boost.
---
Imagine the outrage on this subreddit when the camp budges increase comes to private worlds but not public ones.
---
Darn I think you must be on a different platform.  I’m on PC and I am unable to add you.
---
Got Green thumb? Go from the Vault down to the overseers camp (mainly river) walk to Flatwoods - pick up *everything*. Make stuff at chem bench, and sell it all. Max caps for the day =).
---
Lol how do you know it was all whales but the backpack was easy to get but a boring quest though to get it. The problem with that I think that since it comes with free atoms it could potentially be free depending on how much atoms they would charge. So Bethesda would loose money or they’d have to make it like 10k atoms a month or something lol
---
&gt;6mb/s.
---
I get kb/s. Wanna trade?
---
Publishers see paid to act as a shield for dev's. This is Bethesda for sure; any talk about Zenimax is just speculation. I prefer facts, thanks. 
---
You can blame Zenimax for ESO.
---
COMMUNIST ENGAGED
---
NO! I bought fallout not inventory management 101. 
---
The weekend of 50% scrip I stayed over weight the whole time, carrying 2 xtra guns so I could scrip them the next day. because of the stoopit scrip limit. 
---
I spend a lot of time managing stash and carry weight  if Im not my teammate is. as much as I have, When I try to help a new player, I cannot make one complete set of modded leather armor, a pistol and rifle without running out of something. 
---
I dont care one bit about the subscription, I care that I have beat my brains out on inventory management since beta, and now I find its not the issue I was led to think it was. ticks me off.
---
Heck, FO4 had it right, all I had to do was get back to base.
---
BTW, after half my time spent on inventory, then I have to play a stoopit card game depending on where Im going. I havent picked or hacked anything past a zero in 9 months.
---
two QOL fixes that beth needs to fix
---
Your not kidding :(
---
Told the mods if any of them are in my neck of the woods to look me up so I could buy them a drink of their choice.
---
They sure as hell could use it at this point.
---
If only I could virtually send my junk cross platforms, so close yet so far, lol
---
Now that point I can agree with. Other than boring quests... grinding is boring if you see it for what it truly is lol. They just made it extra boring for sure.
---
Thanks anyway and good luck.  👍
---
Because the people playing the game now literally don’t matter. At all. Nor do I. They nor I can’t, as individuals, do anything to help or harm the game. And at this point, unless 76 gets full mod support it’s a lost cause entirely with no real future. It’ll get abandoned in time for Starfield and it’s status will be cemented as a laughing stock of gaming (which tbh it already is outside this sub). What’s more important is that the shit pulled with 76 is not carried over to Starfield or, worse, to TESVI. 
---
Best thing that can be done is to grow the united front of criticism within the community which, as the fanboys have been whining about here, already exists. Growing it just increases the chance for the COLLECTIVE to be heard.
---
And la lot of people upvoting and commenting on those crying posts don't even play the game.
---
Yea I saw that. That’s why I posted this. Really disappointed in that change.
---
Some of the best fallout stories have been told by holo/terminals
---
I don't know for sure, but I would imagine that the bigger camp budget would carry over to Adventure Mode, but only for subscribers.  So you'd end up with the peasants having smaller camps while the premium customers having luxury high-rises.  The outrage will be palpable.  It'll be like Tenpenny Tower all over again.

Care to re-read everything I've written here? I never once said I wanted Fallout 76 to have Paid DLC, I only mentioned another great game that supports itself with purchasable "Cosmetic purchase only" currency has supported itself on the purchases of cosmetics and the occasional paid DLC, which will be 3 years in between when the next comes out, and only $30 and NOT $99 EVERY YEAR. 
---
So leave your commie comment out of this. I never said I wanted Fallout 76 to have paid DLC, especially after we were told it would be free.
---
You guys... :) :) :) Beth you are the best... &lt;3
---
Ah yes, that internal anger has finally hit the point where you are trying to find ways to attack me that you think will cause an emotional response.
---
Hate to break it to you, but you are just a source of amusement at this point.
---
Wait... you can get kicked from the private server you're paying for?
---
I’ve said nothing but the truth, I’m sorry you can’t handle it. Keep shilling bruh it suits you well.
---
Honestly it's very close to the satirical humour in the first two fallout games, a little less like the memey humour in  borderlands (not a dig I love borderlands)
---
&gt; How many times have you or your friends been waiting for someone that is sorting through their junk because they can't fast travel?
---
Almost never. Because we just walk to a near by crafting station and scrap it then fast travel.
---
Yeah I'm done moving weapons, armor and caps to my mules. It's a pain. I just randomly give stuff to low levels. Last night a level 17 got 10k caps for a can of dogfood.
---
Bruh ABC news just got caught faking news lmao. What are you even saying that theres no fake news lmao Game is trash, accept that people will hate and it will die soon and all your stuff will be lost sorry, you should have seen it coming by now right ?
---
If they lock these characters or camps into private there would be less outrage yes? Seems like people are either upset about the price which while a bit high is still cheaper than ark or they are upset that these people who have it are gonna become demi gods or something.
---
Fallout 76 is the epitome of everything you shouldn't do as a developer and publisher.
---
If you want a Responder to assist in your travels, add me on PSN (same username). We'll get after it.
---
The ash pile does appear for scorchbeasts that are killed while in the air, it's just that it will be floating in the air and not have a bottom texture, so you'll have to be higher than the pile to be able to see it.
---
At this point they could use a Nuka Cola Quantum or maybe even a Nukashine
---
A never ending cycle. Yin and yang.
---
&gt; You could join almost all of them on Morrowind as well
---
Advancing in the factions typically (or maybe always, I don't remember offhand) involves passing skill thresholds, so while you might be able to be a low-ranking member of many factions (though not more than one of the great houses) you are going to find it very difficult to advance far in all of them. 
---
This is really great because it makes your choices as a player feel more meaningful, and gives reason to multiple playthroughs of different types of character. Contrast this with FO4 and Skyrim for instance, where you can be king rad of everything and it feels hollow because you didn't have to make any mutually exclusive choices to get there, as well as basically defeating the purpose of multiple playthroughs since all characters converge into the same thing pretty much.
---
Me: Okay guys i just need to find a workbench to scrap
---
*runs into an endless array of cooking stations*
---
Me: WRYYYYYYYYYY
---
That's fine too
---
Dude I'm gonna buy whatever I want. I bought a green tea flavour Kik kat yesterday. Not very interesting, is it. Cause it's my business and you don't have to concern yourself with it
---
Lucky you! I had to uninstall manually.
---
I get it - the cuck thing is really on your mind and it’s difficult to ignore.  It must consume you for you to be lashing out at other people.  
---
I’m proud of you for talking about it though even if it’s difficult.
---
Nuka dark for the working class mod.
---
people are bitching about the scrap box because Bethesda made a bunch of bullshit excuses about why it couldn't be infinite, then proceeded to make it infinite and lock it behind a 100$ paywall, you bootlicking moron
---
True, but when I used that glitch (I'm assuming you're referring to the carry weight glitch) on xbox, if I went above 1000 my FPS would take a tremendous hit no matter where I was. Don't know if that was a common experience among players or not
---
Sure would be nice if they didn't use the worst business model every time.
---
The map is fun, the lore is neat, the crippling that they do in every other aspect is sad at best and salty at worst.
---
Got sand off some of that *edge* there buddy.
---
Hmmm
---
One game is being praised for its story, world building, gameplay, graphics, and being an actual finished game.
---
The other is literally one of the worst products ever released by a gaming company. Was unfinished at launch and still is.  And is universally panned as a dont buy.
---
You couldn't suck off 76 any harder if you tried.
---
What level are you because from what I understand the enemies level to the highest player in the area. I'm only lvl15.
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED
---
There's a mod that gives you sub categories on pc thats really helpful
---
You're 900 hours in and are worried that players with more scrap than you are going to have an advantage and win at the game. I don't understand.
---
Most games are $60 and 60€  I thought? So this is literally the exact same thing. $100 = 100€. And if you pay taxes on top of that it's 120. NA doesn't pay taxes on digital purchases also.
---
&gt;Now doing a full on every side quest run.
---
Yeah so see you in about 15 hours.
---
They are not protectrons lol. And you don’t remember BIV e. Ridge??
---
I’m sure at this point, they are doing ANYTHING to turn a profit. They originally were to release wastelanders in the summer, then pushed it to right when Borederlands 3 came out. But it wasn’t ready and pushed it back. I guess this stunt was a bandaid. Too bad it failed. It’s like Bethesda hasn’t learned anything since launch.
---
I'm understanding it is a naming thing. The piece may be called Bolstering but when you look at the actual effects on it it might be Bolstering or Vanguards, it gives both the same name.
---
you guys need to fix your builds
---
The enemies do level dynamically based on party, but it is also heavily dependent on the area you are in.
---
If you are, say, near Flatwoods or Morgantown, the enemies will still be trivial even if I am in your party.
---
**EDIT:** IIRC I am level 30.
---
What’s difficult is seeing people like you endorse the blatant cash grabs of these companies. You contribute to half ass releases we get every year with the way you consume. Be smarter, quit shilling, and have some fucking backbone not to take it from these corporations. Legitimate criticisms and all you can do is create some fantasy in your mind, I’m glad you don’t live in my state tho..
---
Maybe the condition is simply not visible while in the scrapbox.
---
The deal was to keep people who spend and buy ATOMs locked into the platform and not bail to play Outer Worlds.  Not to make $$ of the sub directly as they give you equivalent amount in ATOMS as the subscription cost every month (they make ATOM store profits).  It's to keep you playing and spending ATOMS while a steady revenue stream comes in.
---
From BGS's persepective, those who won't subscribe are the same ones not spending $$ on Atoms and only spent $60 a year ago to buy the game.  They make the most noise and are the ones that noisily quit at the drop of a hat when drama happens which is then used by You Tubers like Yong Yea to make seething videos about whatever drama is occurring at the moment. They aren't interested in catering to the buy-no-ATOM player base.  They went overboard with the subscription service to lure the  'whales'  to stick around and buy stuff at the ATOM store because they have a commitment to the game via the subscription.
---
imagine using a games subreddit to ask a question about a game, so sad
---
I get that feeling when playing (we are happy ). This sub however, seems to have a little sand in their vagina. I'm loving it and joined this sub recently because I knew I would have problems and questions. Thanka for your response.
---
I would gladly trade in my vast collection of holotapes and notes for unlimited scrap storage.
---
I have worked for a digital games store, VAT is paid by the company to the states, no dodging this one. What we have is states like the UK, with special regions with really low VAT, where rich people buy their expensive toys, essentially dodging the VAT of their home countries. I wish all taxes were enforced as stricly as VAT.
---
In fact as it is the consumer paying the VAT, if it is not sent to the state that would not be dodging, that will be stealing.
---
Dude def give SpiderMan a go.  You're not going to be disappointed if your a fan of singleplayer games.
---
I didn’t say you couldn’t buy whatever you want. But if you buy a recurring monthly subscription for a game, despite the fact that the dev promised that they would never charge you for one, that has a year of trackable history of poor implementation and broken updates in order to gain features that should have been included in the price of the previous purchase you already made then you are just plain dumb. No ones saying that you shouldn’t be allowed to spend your money on something. You wanna but Fallout First? Do it. Just be prepared to be made fun of for a while.
---
Wow your a bit of a negative nancy arent ya?
---
10 months been over encumbered.
---
Current weight 1546/390
---
Can't even use power armor
---
Bye Felicia
---
How would they feasibly accomplish that, though?  Like, let's say you have a three-story camp in Adventure Mode, and you're at max budget.  Then you go over to Private Worlds and you build a fourth story to the camp.
---
Then you switch back to Adventure Mode.  How does the game know what to remove?  Thinking about this and other scenarios of building different versions of your camp in between modes that still have to carry over to other modes makes me think of so many opportunities for things to go awry in their coding.
---
Do I look like PS Support?
---
Really like how he patrols around, now he just a chant to play over the voice chat
---
I’m a filthy casual - sometimes I just like seeing the photos people take in game.
---
Funny thing tho, every game mentioned in your comment fucking sucks 😂
---
It is hard for some to remember being lower level and selling 10-20lb weapons for 7 caps. Early game you want to scrap weapons to learn mods, and craft chems and cook food to sell for decent caps:weight ratio. Glowing meat steaks are decent to sell.
---
Using green thumb (per), chemist (int) and super duper (luck) perks help you make higher quantities of items to sell, and hard bargain (chr) increase sell prices, as well as anything else that raises charisma such as beer and grape mentats. 
---
You’ll get into a rhythm of stocking up tons of crap from questing/looting, heading back to camp and swapping in to your crafting perks, go off on crafting, then boost charisma and sell. It’ll help you keep your stash from filling up and get you close to getting all 1400 caps from the vendor pool every 20 hours. 
---
Bulked junk also sells decently and you shouldn’t need to store more than 100-150 of any resource for crafting and building. Bulk anything over that amount at a tinkers workbench
---
I get that you like the game and can afford to spend the money for a few perks.  The problem is that many players bought the game without the intent of dumping extra cash, and were expecting to be on equal footing as everyone else.  So when players like you mindlessly support these bait and switch tactics, everyone else suffers for it.  Simply put, this subscription was specifically targeted at dumb people who don't know the value of their money.
---
No the camp limit one. If you drop an item then either store or scrap it on the ground it still refunds the "settlement value" of it. Dropping an item doesn't increase that value. 
---
There's another minor glitch you can do. You can pick up tires (using the grab/place command) and drag them to a settlement and scrap them there. You can even do it with cars but that's a little harder, you can't grab them, but a "heavy" object can push them. So you drop a minigun, grab it, and push the car to a camp. This is a Bethesda game after all, really weird and dumb bugs everywhere you can exploit.
---
Surprised about the carry weight thing though. I just traveled encumbered a lot and never got something like that. I'd move all objects from an area (dropped guns and junk) to a container near the entrance as I explored. Then when I was done clearing that zone, I'd pick all that up and carry it to the settlement.
---
My problem goes much deeper. Why do you need scrap in the first place? You cannot use it to make best in slot gear.
---
Also the Green Tea Kit Kat is delicious. Buying 15 of those would have been a far better investment than Fallout First.
---
Lol nothing in gta costs 50 million idk what your talking about...is it a grind to make money on gta yes but grinding for a particular vehicle or weapon doesn't take months ....and no heists are not actually the best way to make money...owning the right business or businesses is and even those aren't all that expensive and can be done solo...now if your trying to buy everything gta has that's a different story... if you want to buy everything right away in a game that is 5 years old and has hundreds of vehicles and weapons then maybe the problem is you??... the people who have everything have been grinding for 5 years and you think you should have it all in months???
---
Are the gutsys? I don’t even remember they don’t really do anything important. And no what quest was he in? Is there a Nuka quest I missed
---
Dang.
---
You got me.
---
Also...
---
Running around in my personal server atm, not even wearing the ranger gear, and haven't spent my atoms yet.
---
Enjoy.
---
He’s probably not doing enough damage.
---
Why is that?
---
I like it. I recorded a video of me spanking a team of 4 over it.
---
Fortnite season pass does not cost $10/month. It's $10 every 12 weeks or so. And it comes with literally 20X the content that Fallout 1st does.
---
But agreed, the subscription should grant atoms and skin unlocks, and be purchasable with atoms.
---
Todd is that you??
---
Lol well shouldn't they be playing on their precious  "private server" anyways?
---
Nice one, but how did you move? Walking was not appropriate choice if you wanna play.
---
This dude gets it. And is nicer than me.
---
I've been disappointed in the atomic shop since launch. 
---
Micro transactions are supposed to be exactly that, micro. Not $18 for a color.
---
Or make it when they shoot it decloaks the player like they did in nuclear winter. And make Berry’s work.
---
It's hilarious lol
---
You know what’s hilarious, like I said before I didn’t purchase a subscription but I can see why people would. I would also bet that a lot more people purchased a subscription then there are pissed off about it, since most people are adults and can make a formulated decision on their on for something they want to support or not.
---
You made a post 4 months ago about dying in NW.. 7 months thing seems like a lie now
---
Ty for at least admitting it.
---
bye dude, wish i could have taken some of those god rolls
---
Had my icon on display and emoting all over the place and have only had others do the same. While i don't doubt for a second that this happened its not happening as much as some have said. Ive been on adventure mode all day and haven't heard a sour word from anyone
---
I'm sure there is, and I had a lot of mods for FO4 but I'm looking for mod-free stuff here considering the game already still randomly refuses to let me in after a glitch, saying "Disconnected due to having modded game files." Or whatever the message is. It hasn't happened in a good minute but still lol
---
And by mod-free stuff I just mean hoping they will implement better categories into the game at some point.
---
ESO is more popular then fortnight but uses rl currancy for its Premium sub.
---
Not that it's got much to do with you, I got the game for Christmas. Even if I had paid for it and wanted to continue to support something I like and that I get a LOT of time out of that wouldn't make anyone dumb. A tonne of games have subscriptions. I don't make fun of people for things they like, that would make me a total jerk.
---
&gt; $100 = 100€. 
---
That's not how money works
---
60US$ = 54€
---
54€*1,10VAT(I have taken the highest average tax which is Louisiana according to Wikipedia) = 59,4€. 
---
So this price is much closer to the actual price in Europe (which already include the sale tax in it). I would accept such a difference because both $ and € will change a bit in value.
---
Tell him to shoot the fracken SBQ and not the adds.
---
Lol you actually bought a subscription? My condolences 🤣
---
Probably - Will you help?
---
Drugs caps and ammo will always be needed
---
No I did not say it should take months to get it all I am saying that the nice things are very expensive and that it can take weeks if not months to save up enough for a couple nice things. Though to be honest I stopped playing after a couple weeks because I got tired of not being able to meet up with friends in game aften enough and getting blown to kingdom come every 5 minutes by the people who HAVE been playing for those 5 years. I apologize for getting the prices wrong though.
---
&gt; Supporting it tells them they can lie all they want and still get their money.
---
That's why you don't pay for the subscription.  How is that so hard to understand?
---
76 is literally one of the worst games to be released in recent years and single handedly ruined the reputation of a once beloved publisher.  
---
Anyone who says 76 is good is either delusional or a fanboy. It had amazing potential and I was one of this dumbasses who preordered it just because it's a Bethesda product but no the game is one giant example of Murphy's Law.
---
I love how this is getting downvoted. Just goes to show...
---
Edit: Thanks for the heads-up. It's always fun finding the quiet additions.
---
I use 1 toon and its alwase 2k - 3k
---
Nope. Fallout 2 best fallout.
---
15 kit Kats won't give me 1300 hours of fun. Even the delicious green tea ones. 76 might not taste as nice but I've got more hours out of it than 15 kit kats.
---
Lol have you tried leaving things you dont need in the stash box lol
---
Too bad people can't learn to put their time and energy towards something more productive. Learn a hobby or some shit. smh
---
Don't say anything bad about fallout first in this sub-reddit or you'll get downvoted to hell.
---
A couple shots aren’t enough to get the rewards. He needs to shoot a good 100 rounds or so. If he’s focusing on the minions, tell him to put some more time into shooting the SBQ.
---
Just YouTube “juicehead” videos. Prob other ones too but that will fill you in quicker and with more factual guidance.
---
Lol congrats, you got conned into paying for something you were promised for free. I’m sitting in my apartment playing Morrowind which is still getting free mods with a whole $15 dollars to spend; that’s two meals or even a whole new game if I can catch a sale. And just imagine what I can do if I save it and have $30 next month after, again not buying something I was promised for free. And what if i save for 3 months? Or 4? Or more? 
---
I have a lot to enjoy.
---
Bethesda got greedy again added a subscription to fallout to get a privite server and kinda made it pay to win in a way
---
𝓵𝓲𝓽𝓮𝓻𝓪𝓵𝓵𝔂 𝓪 𝓯𝓪𝓬𝓽
---
Bethesda released Fallout 1st this week. Perks for this paid subscription service include an unlimited stash box for scrap, private server, etc. Plans range from, I believe, $12.99 a month or $99 for the year. However, along with Bethesda implementing a paid service without fixing 76, the paid service is also broken. Stash boxes are eating scrap, and private servers are reused worlds that have already been looted.
---
Basically a game that was sworn not to go pay 2 win goes pay 2 win, and also doesn't work properly.
---
Bethesda sloppily introduced a premium subscription service that, while slightly on the piss side, isn't out of line with online game's business models. But for some reason everyone acted like it was and the reactionaries and trolls flooded in before getting bored after 2 days and leaving again. The usual internet outrage cycle.
---
\*slow clap\* Wow, you called me Hitler, how will I ever recover?....
---
I can walk around normally, I'm not going at a snail's pace ( over over encumbered AF)
---
I am close to it however but normally fluctuate between 1348 and 1546
---
Having unlimited junk is a pretty big advantage
---
Right except those games with subscriptions didn’t explicitly promise to give you the same content for free before surprising you with one.
---
Fucking amazing.  Its the first game in a while that's made me actually laugh and the story is fantastic.  Play it and tell me you dont think Pavarti is one of the best companions in a while.
---
Name checks out.
---
The NPC's got delayed. 
---
Few days later they announced a subscription service including things that had been asked for (couldn't tell you how many posts I saw along the lines of "PUT IN THE NCR RANGER OUTFIT TO THE ATOM SHOP"). 
---
Internet lost its collective shit. 
---
Well, that is to put it very basically. Obviously a bit more to it than that but check any of the threads banging about in here you'll get a pretty good idea.
---
Oh yeah I get it now, I always thought they just changed the symbol but kept the price the same and didn't know the tax was included since like I said, I didn't think digital sales had taxes.
---
Your Right, I wasn’t forced to but I was TRICKED. 
---
I PAID a premium for an underdeveloped, half assed, sort of game that I was promised would be fixed , only to continually deal with MASSIVE bugs and issues which are never handled in a timely manner - AND even put back in after they are “fixed”. 
---
On top of that, the devs have purposely lied to us,  
---
Nerfing or crippling game mechanics just to turn around and try to fleece more money from us in order for us to be able to just play the damn game that we already paid $60 damn dollars for. 
---
FUCK THAT SHITSHOW
---
Ha! Some people don’t get that literally everything we buy or service we get has people who work hard and earn a paycheck... this people also get their coffee and burgers and groceries, gas, toilet paper at other places that produce or sell them... 
---
So technically my $100 I spent along with the original price of the game goes a lot further than most think...
---
Unlimited scrap=unlimited ammo 
---
Unlimited scrap=unlimited caps 
---
It's not instant but you can sell ammo/scrap at your vendor or npc.
---
It's in the same vein as requiring ballistic to repair all non pa armor, or drastically increasing gear breakage rates before repair kits hit, plenty of other examples too
---
&gt;Name checks out.
---
Explain
---
Except your decision to buy 15 Kit Kats affects no one but you. Your decision to support exploitative business practices does and in the long run makes the game worse for the rest of us.
---
Private servers and the private worlds we have are different.
---
Nice try with the meme post
---
Yeah i said to him that he needs to change weapon. Lets see does it effect to it.
---
I spare about 300 inventory units to get normal running just in case you bump into legendary mobs or rushing anything.
---
You must have an Atom shop skin on it? Thats the only time I've really ever had that pop-up occur. Remove the skin, you can scrip/sell/drop it as usual.
---
Because of the atomic shop skin on it. Take that off first.
---
Quite the opposite, actually. Can't even speak in any way positively without getting downvotes. Check out the person who posted on finding V79 -downvoted.
---
Just for the record I'm 40 year old man jaded in this word by growing up reading Mad Magazine Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions. So if wondering the wastes with me sounds bearable, I go by the same name, FlavoredCancer.
---
Maybe they like the abuse.
---
Spiteful attitude.
---
Don't be rude to people, it's rude.
---
For some reason, you can only rename a limited amount of weapons and armor, so this would be a great addition.
---
"Take that stupid robot dance back to your private server" was the best voice chat that I heard lol
---
No.  Dont know anything about fallout 76 other than it got bad release reviews so i skipped it. not sure if its pc or mobile or what. dont know anything about what this gear is or how its monetized or this subscription thing.
---
Yes, but nobody should buy it. The "If you don't like it don't buy it" argument is bad because if people buy it they will continue making it. It has to be a community effort against scams like these.
---
It must be the game engine limitation until next sub lands.
---
How was I being rude? Reach alittle harder
---
Wouldn't surprise me.
---
Sweet dreams are made of these
---
What content did they state would be free that is no longer free?
---
Thanks for keeping it civil.
---
Kinda but not really. Npc is capped out at a ridiculous small amount. Your vendor is still capped out at 30 k and its a hassle to find stuff to buy. Its much more akin to previous fallout and elder scrolls where your house fits everything you would ever want.
---
Of course they're using version control. Here's their folder names:
---
Fo76 current 
---
Fo76 really current
---
Fo76 current 2 
---
Fo76 this one
---
Personally, I enjoy the game. 
---
You seem like someone who does not.
---
So the question is, why are you complaining about it? Why not just not play it? And ignore the game.
---
If that one only use to trade then it don't count. Rarely i could see a playable character can run with that inventory even with backpack.
---
I stay in my private server... ;)
---
Gotcha, didnt think that would bring a problem scripping it. Thanks for the help
---
What always fixed it for me, go into your game files and the 76 files should still be there. Move them out of the folder, start the install on the Bethesda launcher for about 10-30 seconds, close the launcher completely, move the files back in, then it should work. I’d recommend leaving it uninstalled for the foreseeable future thoufh
---
Want an easy method? Buy serums from any player since most go for about 200 caps... use 3* hard bargain and grape mentats and for 3 serums you get a total of 1380 caps out of 1400
---
So buying for 600 caps and selling for 1380 caps gives you 780 caps in about 10 minutes... 
---
Buy bulk from players and resell it... 
---
There are plenty of ways.
---
No. It does not. It says your level. It does not say hours played. You are thinking fallout 4. You sure you play this game? Lol
---
Seriously. I have fo76 on my pc and since i have an xbox one and tv i never use it sure would be nice to let me and my kid coop.I already do it with minecraft and its glorious.  Im not really down to creating and running maintenance on more than one expensive machine. Even if i did 2 xbox's i prefer keyboards and it would require another xbox live sub and putting that hot mess on my cpu table.
---
Hey that's a good idea.
---
I did on my main character until Faschnat. God that was a pain.
---
Why is this getting downvoted if people aren't simply forming lynch mobs on here to punish those who actually play the game? Hmm...
---
Exactly! I don’t remember having to tell anyone I don’t play a game any longer...lol
---
Lmao you serious? Have you just not seen the front page of the sub? Its literally everyone hating on Fallout 1st. Where did your imaginary agenda come from?
---
You were surprised? And do you have a source on that?
---
Not sure I get what you mean? lol if I don't need something it gets sold haha I have random cooking ingredients in stash and duplicates of magazines in there. I'm just saying it really sucks to have to scroll through 100 items before I can even get to the non-display items. xD
---
I dont have multi toons and no friends in the game id ever trust to hold on to my shit while i reloged with a mule. I dont do trading on 76 smh. Im still over weight with a crap ton of guns from the pervayer sale. And my only version of a backpack is my excavator PA.
---
Yes they are gutsys. He is the nuka shine robot.
---
It’s been recycled content
---
Manhattan can see his entire life front to back all at the same time. He just acts surprised sometimes. Even if he got outsmarted, he would have seen the outcome already. 
---
Besides, there's a point where everybody knows the plan and makes a conscious decision not to stop it.
---
Man when I heard that fanboys would take the sloopy seconds of Bugthesda I thought spacebattles were joking.
---
But seeing this...I wouldn't be surprised if the next thing they put out is 500 dollars for some extra shit and the same people downvoting your comments would shit out there money and still defend the game. Even if your paying more than 6x the initial price of the game.
---
Bug where your money transaction won't go through and they still act like its okay. Fucking dumbasses.
---
I did it since beta and still doing just fine or just get used to it...
---
I can't rush away from enemies, my only tactics are gunning them down with mass firepower ( 30+ weapons) or evading them by jumping onto something high or off a cliff ( 100% fall reduction)
---
If I find legendaries and can't move because I'm too heavy, i pop buffout till I can scrip them at a station
---
In runescape you can buy membership with in game currency, if you were already a member it would take you a few hours of grinding to keep your monthly membership

Laughs in the sims 4
---
Sound like poor plebs being dumb and poor...ha ha
---
This is a game play loop created by lack of interesting content. I agree with your point. This is what have kept me loggning in every Day but it would have kept me for hours IF there was less grind like this and more FUN quests. I would have replayed The game several Times on different characters. But now i dont want to because it is too much work doing all The grind over again. Im sick of it
---
Don't feed the trolls
---
You can also prevent this from happening by not buying it in the first place.
---
I understand where your coming from but it sounds like you were trying to compete with the elite...and it takes time and effort...they put it in work and you were just paying your dues as should be...if you buy shark cards would it make it faster to get these items yes...but definitely not required...and even if you had these items a person who is more skilled than you will still hand you your ass...a level 1 with the clothes on his back and a hand pistol who knows how to fly can steal a car... go up to the airstrip and steal a jet and wreck the whole fucking lobby... so p2w in gta?....nahhh....those items are more like bragging rights
---
Then perhaps once a character goes into private make them unplayable in public? Similar to how a modded file in fo4 will never let you get achievements even after disabling mods.
---
Most players have Max caps and they even increased to 30k because of that. 1400 caps a day.. 21 days and you Max it. I've been playing since release. Unlimited scrap you should Max your caps in one month.
---
That's because they started charging players real money to implement the feedback...
---
i did that till yesterday that i uninstall the game.
---
LIKE I SAID ON A EARLY POST WHALE SEASON IS OPEN GUYS.
---
I saw a few of those!!! I’m like... what kind of person who has 0.00% interest in the game and never played it and thinks their “opinion” matters to those who love the game... 
---
I’m in the greater Seattle area which is full of these type people, I can spot them a mile away now... 
---
Funny is when you look at their profile and see other posts...
---
Oh it says last played!
---
How am I a troll? I've made my point quite transparent, if you bought a fallout 1st subscription your a sucker, plain and simple.
---
Most likely, but those are still reference points that each item needs to have in order for the 3D model system to access the correct information for each item.
---
Never.
---
 I have the record and its very fine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxk-yVT6pfE
---
Buy a serum from a player for 200 caps... turn around and sell it to vendor with hard bargain and grape mentats for 450+... boom instant caps... take that money and go buy 2 more... repeat... you’ll be set in no time!
---
I think more people are pissed than the people who bought it. I don’t think too many people play this game as is, so it’s like whatever
---
That sounds like communist talk.  Even if you think something sucks, the market will determine that.
---
If the community truly collectively thinks the subscription sucks, they won't buy it.  But bitching and moaning about the handful of players that choose to throw away their expendable income on it doesn't help anything.  It actually makes it sound like you're afraid that some people will think it's worthwhile(dude, $18 a month.  That's ridiculous).  Just don't whinge about it to every Dick and Sally.  You're arguing to somebody who's already told you they're not buying it, for christ's sake.  Just give it a rest and don't have an aneurysm.
---
Tbh you would not be the oldest human I have shot things with
---
I mean, considering the fact that they may have just enraged every single person with the Fallout 1st membership, I wouldn't be surprised if they're just keeping quiet and waiting for this to blow over.
---
I never bothered to play those
---
Shut up you churlish toaster poop brain
---
Impressive! good job!!
---
It’s great that they only add new music to the fuckin shop haha
---
I get that a lot.
---
Seems like you have some kind of repressed sexual issues
---
You’re*
---
Well generally all content that isn’t cosmetic considering that was their original promise. But they specifically said prior to launch that the unlimited stash would be a feature, then they ran into issues with it and said they would increase it gradually. Suddenly it’s behind a paywall. 
---
Private sessions were also promised but they didn’t say it would be in the base game rather update later. Still, given that they said any content not cosmetic would be free, everyone assumed it would just be an update.
---
The fast travel tent I don’t think was ever alluded to but it certainly isn’t cosmetic. 
---
The atoms and the cosmetic emotes are the only things justified in this package and those certainly aren’t worth $12.99. None of these things are, alone or together, worth even close to that.
---
I did the same with the Queen.

https://segmentnext.com/2018/08/01/fallout-76-will-not-have-a-season-pass-or-paid-dlc-pete-hines-confirms-again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Direct from the mouth from Pete Hines: “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way it’s all free after launch—all our content, there’s no season pass and no DLCs.”
---
ALL our content. Here we were told, explicitly, that Fallout 76 would be a one time purchase to get access to ALL content. We were lied to. Just like they lied about cosmetic micro transactions.
---
And yeah, I was surprised. I didn’t think Bethesda would be willing to risk ANOTHER public embarrassment that they could have avoided by just keeping their promise.
---
I’m interested! My PSN is trebweb, feel free to add me if you like
---
Ok? Lol you sure showed me 🙄🤣
---
Because nothing about this camp is presidential?
---
Though I think people who buy it are suckers, that still doesn’t excuse shitty behavior towards people who bought it.
---
If this would’ve been a battle pass, you wouldn’t see any outrage. RDO’s battle Pass was great. Fortnite’s are give or take but still, they work and keep people playing/happy
---
And I just got a com ban because I'm trying to sell all of my rares before I uninstall the game.
---
Who am I to disagree.
---
Lol never did I say go grief them in game, but yes suckers.
---
I have played a sneak sniper from the start but rebalance it with fast melee.
---
And by priority legendary &gt; legendary scrip &gt; weapon (for mod scrap or caps) &gt; aid &gt; junk.
---
Like i have a lot of weapon so i didn't worry much about don't having weapon to use.
---
The fuck?

People with a grievance love to vent, and the Hivemind is strong in this place.  
---
1. no idea  
---
2. It seems to be random.  I'm pretty sure you'll get plans that aren't even on the gun or armor you're breaking down.  And most of the time, you don't get anything.  
---
3. The big purifier has a capacity of 5; you have to manually empty it. It doesn't put it in your stash.  
---
4. I think there are 3 magazines that offer some level of penetration. Perforating = superior penetration, Piercing = faster reload speed + penetration, Stinging = capacity + penetration.  My assumption is with the latter two is that both enhancements are lesser than the magazines that only enhance one attribute.  
---
5. Probably to protect you hearing.    
---
6. I'm of the opinion its best to discover this by playing the game.  It's both familiar and different from other fallout games.  But if you want a detailed peak, check out [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I think being able to scrap everything with no weight limit is definitely kind of damning to one of the core gameplay loops of 76 for sure.  If you can just pick up everything and store it, it defeats the purpose of various junk weight reduction abilities, and it just means you can hoard anything and everything even when you really don't need it.   But I will concede that having that greatly simplifies thing for the sake of convenience, and I'm sure a lot of people don't really enjoy hunting for junk at all, in fact, it's probably one of the aspects that will annoy people the most early on when playing 76, because not everything is immediately accessible.
---
I've had thoughts in the past on how you could alleviate the annoying part of junk hunting in the past with a specific storage item, but now I don't feel like conveying that idea anymore because knowing Bethesda these days, someone might take the idea, add it in and monetize it so it's behind a paywall instead of available to everybody.
---
Yeah the same way as you would on public. Afking too long kicks you and also, at least on pc, if you’re afk for like 20-30 minutes it full on logs you out of your account and you have to sign in again. No idea why.
---
Right... which is not hours played. Hence why the have the nominal reward under challenges.  It’s just a way to keep track.
---
I somehow doubt that
---
“Shouldn’t they be on their precious private servers anyway” -you
---
That’s you being a douchy, shitty person.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/4sDs8iIPG1xSlsiRdVtHuI/atomic-shop-patch-14-items-and-sales-october-23 is the article. You can see most of the stuff in the promo pics
---
Fog machine is pretty good, it puts out an orange fog with a bonus flying bats particle that looks neat. If you bought the mothman bundle with its black fog machine you can use both as they raised the build limit to 2
---
The "vintage decor pack" are just the Halloween decor assets that have been around since F4; the hanging paper skeletons, bats, etc.
---
Ok? Point is there are NPCs, they just aren’t human. And BIV is hilarious.
---
It was banter buddy. Get over it
---
So it is a challenge, thank you
---
That's not what was said.  
---
Q:  Hey Pete Will Fallout 76 have microtransactions?   
---
A:  **Yes**, as we have said there will be cosmetic ones. And you can buy any of it with in-game currency as well. All the dlc/new content will be free.   
---
The lie is that they were *only* going to be selling cosmetic items/unlocks.
---
But then Berry Mentats would have no counter. Maybe implement a Berry Blaster that renders all Berry Mentats (BMs) inert.
---
Whatever you say, shitty person
---
Both could be true as well.
---
Hey if you’re going to criticize people at least have proficient grammar
---
Nobody ever disputed no NPCs, it’s no human NPCs that was the problem
---
I generally pop shot at them until they land, and I get in on them with mutants grognak axe. 
---
Haven't worked on a heavy guns character yet. That's next.
---
I'd almost pay to see some top-notch griefing videos of it.
---
The atoms alone are worth $12.99 seeing as that is less money then if you were buying the atoms directly lol.
---
r/FalloutFirst
---
I disagree, every time I play adventure mode my worlds are always full.
---
Community backlash?  What the fuck does that have to do with a purchase agreement? 
---
Oh you didn't get the game you expected? How the fuck not? The state of the game was plastered all over the internet. The Beta further dislplayed it. 
---
One week prior to launch there was not one fucking single iota of evidence to suggest the game wasn't going to be buggy as fuck at launch. 
---
Yet a whole bunch of entitled morons, somehow convinced themselves otherwise and expected a different launch experience? 
---
What a fucking joke. "The game was a shitty alpha version wahhhh wahhhh wahhh"
---
And you still fucking bought it. Brilliant. I knew the game was going to be buggy, they always are. I knew what to expect....
---
That's why you don't see me crying like some little entitled bitch. God bless the American education system.
---
No shit. Wearing that ranger armor has got to be like putting a sign on that says "I support Bethesda's bad decisions and pay them to abuse me"
---
Glad they got private servers then.
---
It’s listed under challenges... yes... but it isn’t meant to be something to grind toward
---
Be wary of raid in your "private server"
---
Notice how you're the only person here cussing people out? Yeah and I'm shitty.
---
I should go stock up on more candy and start leaving it at random camps
---
How so? Do you think a private world doesn't take any extra capacity?
---
I never once said that was my reason for the uninstall.  It's merely a symptom of the direction the game is going and I don't agree with what they're doing overall.  I'm not here to insult anyone who continues to play or those who leave.  Besides, I've got my money's worth regardless so I'm good to wait for further improvements.
---
They don’t place you in any empty world, they place you in servers where spots free up lol why does everyone think this proves something?
---
My character build is extremely flexible, i can rebalance it at a whim too.
---
Current setup is rifleman heavy but can change to melee, shotgun or commando whenever I feel like it to suit the weapon I feel like using
---
.* sentences end with periods buddy. If you're going to criticize people's grammar at least use proper punctuation. 😊
---
Of course not, I can’t imagine playing this game for 316 full days straight. It’s just bizarre that they would only award you with 20 atoms
---
That laser is op though lol
---
sorry man but you trying to speak to sheeps, they literally blind by Bethesda.
---
Bethesda can sell them a rape pass and they will buy it and love getting rape by Bethesda.
---
Is amazing how much Fanboys of Bethesda just keep trowing money to a companies that show over and over that they will lie and fail to delivery a quality product.
---
...Sony took the crossplay tech out of beta. Any devs are free to use it.
---
They have a safe space hermit server to hide, they'll be just fine. I'll never buy anything at their vending machines though, you can always tell who the Atom Shop supporters are. 
---
Nobody bought anything from the Atom Shop ever....its not for sale....everything is rented...nobody owns anything.
---
gotta get to a trunk with no limit
---
Yeah, I mean, people are calling for bethesda to be shut down and the staff tortured and executed, why isn't he responding to these rational level headed people?
---
I was hoping it was attached to the Halloween vendor machine. Can anyone confirm?
---
Yeah what kind of fuck
---
Doggystyle fuck or 69 fuck or missionary fuck so many ways to fuck but no one specify how or where to fuck
---
Thank you for your response. However on the last one, I dont want to just discover it. I have been playing fallout since the first one and I know how I enjoy playing. However in this case I don't see a clear road map/skill tree. So I want what specifications if people would share. I'll check out your link thank you.
---
And free lol
---
Thanks for the source, man - I still have the subscription, and won't be surprised the next time something like this comes along. They gotta keep getting cash somehow and while I'd obviously prefer cosmetic only stuff, they've got a new policy. They've changed their business tactic to reflect how their sales turned out. 
---
This is a much nicer conversation than calling each other names.
---
Where did i say i was done? I said im out and guess what i came back. It was pretty easy to do. Upvotes? I have like 1200. I don't give a fuck about made up internet points, however it's pretty clear you do. I'll give you a few upvotes so you can feel good about yourself today
---
Can't think of anything else? Pathetic
---
My only qualm with CD projekt red lies within their tweets
---
Absolutely not true. Once your camp is build. Armor is built your use scrap for nothing. Lead and steel for bullets and lead isn’t from scraping. I don’t ever loot or pick up stuff because of this. Just meds and food. Loot legendaries. All my friends are like this. If you do need junk just buy it from max caps. 
---
Unlimited scrap has me slowing down to loot now. It’s different
---
Weightless scrap is the least of this game's troubles.  I despise having to micromanage inventory.  I want to play the game.  Instead, I'm constantly micromanaging my hunger and thirst now.  At least by paying a sub, I can get rid of one of the micromanagement things that brings no fun to me at all.
---
As for economy, there doesn't appear to be much of one.  I keep an eye out for plans usually.  Like I really want the shotgun and rifle plans, along with the radiation remover plan.  Other than that, I rarely buy anything off anyone.  None of my stuff ever sells even when I put it up dirt cheap.
---
&gt; Oblivion NPCs weren't scripted
---
I watched the E3 trailer a few days ago again. Such a radiant experience.
---
It's part of the art style of Fallout. Mascots like Vaultboy add character to brands.
---
Damn, I thought I did a good sneak with my newish build
---
I am a sniper, don't have any best opt armor but i could tank up to 3 deathclaws at the same time.
---
Seem like a butt head bumrush of fucking going around here.
---
if you run an ec2 24/7 it might. there’s no way they do that. they probably just run as fargate tasks
---
It's true but we only saw a few players doing it. As a pvp player me and my friends are loving it, even more junk for us to put in the scrapbox.
---
This would be nice and convenient.
---
I hit max caps every three days from selling vendor weapons. I guess thats why I find selling scrap laughable. Once you put it up for sale it goes back to your normal weight in your stash since its in your vending i believe.
---
I can do what i want, if i think the game sucks ass i will say it, problem ? At this point im just making fun of dumb dumbs. Youll never see the light so ill just laugh and watch as bethesda rapes you lol.
---
Well done Bethesda. You turned a great community into waring factions with your greed.  I for one am picking up the banner of the oppressed and fighting the FO1st bourgeoisie.  If I see any evidence of a subscription I will pvp.
---
If they can fix fast travel and sudden AP drain, I’ll still spend my atoms and support them. A NW-math based survival would be awesome too.
---
My average has been around $10 a month on Atoms. I want what they're selling and I understand it costs money to pay devs to create the content. I agree that it's pricey, and I do feel Bethesda is sticking it to the faithful players who have stuck with the game, but I'm not going to deny myself something that I like and want to see in my camp, or on my character, because of sheer altruism. It is absolutely not fair, or right, that they're sticking things like the scrapbox behind a paywall. With that said, I was already spending at least $10 a month on Atoms, so why wouldn't I spend the extra $3 on everything that comes with the sub for one month? So I can "stick it to Bethesda"? The only person who would really be denied anything if I didn't cough up a few bucks once in a while, is myself. Be mad at Bethesda, but don't be mad at people who are less fervent about the industry as a whole and could care less about making some altruistic stand. I just want to play my game and have fun. If that costs a few extra bucks once in a while, I'm not going to be that upset about it.
---
BoS Bundle...where is it?
---
&gt; Because they throw money at developers for exclusivity for their releases.
---
Just like Microsoft Xbox exclusives, just like Sony exclusives, etc. Everyone who is upset about this needs to take a step back and think about it. The more money that a game developer gets from deals like this the better their games will be the next time around. Obsidian has very limited funding. Would you prefer a smaller, less polished game just to have it on Steam?
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED IN THE SUBREDDIT!  LETHAL CLAPBACK ENGAGED!
---
Okay seriously, why does every thread these days have to turn into an argument about Bethesda vs. Obsidian?
---
Obsidian just released a critically acclaimed game that everybody seems to love. Bethesda is currently presiding over a train wreck called Fallout 76 that is setting a very dangerous precedent for the future of the industry.
---
What more is there to be said?
---
I wish people would just stick to raising hell about Fallout 76.   At this moment in time- hell yes Obsidian is the better developer, I repeat: AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.  I don''t want to argue about who made better games a decade ago.  I think there are more pressing concerns at present.
---
Fallout 1st sets a very dangerous precedent. If they are allowed to get away with it, this will become the new normal.
---
Good. If you buy fallout 1st you are a telling Bethesda to keep adding stuff like this.
---
Out of touch? No, just a professional with a comfortable income. While you think I'm hilariously out of touch I'm afraid you are confused. I think you are the one not getting it. This is a very small taste of what you have to look forward to for the rest of your life. Not having money sucks, it means sacrifice and not being able to do things others can. I am assuming you are a younger person. Consider making changes now that will benefit you for the rest of you life. Take some night classes, trade school, self study and get a CCNA or even MCSE and start a career vs a job. A good start is to stop blaming those that have as the reason that you don't.  I know I sound like a dick but I was you, probably worse off at 18 and joined the army because I could never pay for college on my own. Not only did I go to school but I grew up learned that if I want something I have to work for it and complaining is just wasted air.
---
Enjoy your upvote for that, well done.
---
Compare the cost to renting your own or running your own
---
IMO, the best thing to ever come to the atomic shop was the Free States bundle. It had a lot of stuff and were pretty well done. I am sitting on 10 K atoms right now and waiting for something similar to drop.
---
its not 1 to 1, not even close
---
They'll never be able to use workshops again in adventure mode. People immediately fast travel there and start pvp
---
There's np season pass and we didn't have to pay for Wild Appalachia or Nuclear Winter (and we don't have to pay for Wastelanders either)
---
I swear, y'all keep misappropriating that quote (and pretty much *everything* they've said). It's pretty naive to think that they meant *everything* would be free after launch (so no microtransactions, no paying for DLCs, no optional subscriptions). That's how you quickly shelf a game once it turns out it's making you a net *loss* over a profit. Literally no game company in the world is stupid enough to do that
---
It's over, I got a 30 min countdown while ayong
---
So wait, when a spot opens in a full world and you take that spot..:the world is still full correct. Which means most worlds are almost always full of people. Do you even play the game?
---
You guys are ruining gaming for ***everyone***! /s
---
Lmao I don't base my self worth on the colour orange.
---
Why not? A full private server would take as much capacity as a full public one in my estimation.
---
If they implement wait queues for private world's it could be even more.
---
It is cute how cash strapped teens get pissy becuase mommy won't up their allowance.
---
“ALL our content.”
---
They could just be cool and give us an actual game without bugging us for money.
---
A gamma gun
---
I was worried when I got a B50250 Handmade from the purveyor because of the bug, but when I tested it to see if sneaking keeps the primary effect from breaking, I was relieved because I was thinking of creating a stealth commando build with it, which requires you to stay sneaking.
---
You can rent a VPS that’s up 24/7 for $5 / month. I understand that servers cost money, but generally when you rent a server, it stays online and doesn’t reset its state every time you disconnect. People had expectations based on how “private servers” work for every other survival multiplayer game, and Bethesda didn’t deliver that. That’s what people are upset about.
---
&gt; monsters are mostly recycled from fallout 4
---
and a dragon from skyrim too, right?
---
lmao I could not contain my sides when I saw that. What a shitshow.
---
Full of the same people. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen the same usernames on different days. And yes I play the game, you dummies keep using the SAME phrase to argue with. People who played it know how terrible it is
---
I cannot wait to see the mental backflips y’all fanboys come up with. About to be like Cirque du Soleil up in these replies XD
---
Why would you log into a game you’re protesting in order to... protest? All you are to them is one more tally of people who still enter their world. Uninstall, that’s the only way you’re gonna get the point across.
---
Don't let this sub fall. This is a big fucking deal. They lied to us to sell us a "solution." They will lie to us to get money, then ignore us when we're angry.
---
My three star legendary flaming pitchfork, Peasant's Fury, will chase you until the end of the map with increased swing speed (I like the spooky music too but "You cannot go that way").
---
Because an AWS server can host multiple VM’s. On top of that if Bethesda is using AWS they are not paying for an entry level $100 dollar sever. They have an enterprise solution capable of spinning up ridiculous amount of server instances. I highly doubt that the overhead for Bethesda here is so high they are making pennies of profit off the subscription. I’d imagine the labor that went into creating the content is the most expensive part of this endeavor. After that initial expense it’s all profit from there.
---
I think he meant that’s the best deal that Bethesda has done. Not all of gaming
---
It is?!???
---
Fin-na shore up my reputation as a horrible punner.
---
Again, it's utterly naive to think they really meant *everything* would be free. I'm pretty sure Pete didn't  mean "ALL content" would be free. Just the expansions (which so far *HAVE* been free)
---
Just hunting whales
---
Good job, it's fairly easy tho. -25% from robots Live and Love #9, a med-x, 10 Super Stimpaks, and a furious .50 cal. 3 minute battle and done...
---
I agree, they need to realize that a second trailer, even if it’s just a 1:00 or two long could keep people hopeful. Time will tell though...
---
If you have 0 rad resist, one shot from an assaultron head gives you the perfect amount of rads to have 20% health after respawning.
---
You know its a radical idea but, they could always try coming up with solutions that you know...DON'T dick over players whove already tolerated more than any reasonable amount of their cash grabbing shenannagins? Maybe they could try sticking to their promise that new features and content updates would ALWAYS be free...FOREVER? Just a thought.
---
Yeah no you’re right. We should have assumed that he meant something completely different when he said the thing.
---
*laughs in No Man’s Sky*
---
That comment, right there, I fucking lol'd. Give yourself a hug you beautiful human being.
---
This is way better than the actual thread!
---
&gt; You can rent a VPS that’s up 24/7 for $5 / month.
---
Yes, but is a VPS powerful enough for Fallout 76? We're talking about a company that has a history with an engine that is more than two decades old now. Your average VPS for $5/mo only provides around 1GB of RAM and a single virtual CPU. Fallout 76's minimum system memory requirement is 8GB.
---
Code for handling the video, audio, etc will take some memory but assuming it takes 75% that's still 2GB RAM for a server.
---
It's quite the buffet of humanity in here this week.
---
Yeah because 100 dollars for a year for a game that probably won't last another year is a good deal 🙄 
---
Not so much cash strapped as it a wise financial decision not to get it.
---
Only if you sub.  I'm going to venture a guess that the vast majority do not.  I've seen much wailing and gnashing of teeth by people about the pay wall required for the private servers, and other goodies that came with the latest update.
---
Here is my question, how many hours did you put in? 200, 300 or more?  Hell even if you only put 100 hours in and paid full price that is only $0.60 an hour. How many AAA games that last like 10-20 hours have you played and not even sweated because it was fun.  I mean you had fun up until this so it seems weird to draw a line.   
---
There are people with over 1000 hours or getting close like myself that do not mind paying a sub just like I did with WoW for a decade. I still had to buy the games and expansions full price. As you probably can tell I place my value on time/money and this is why I have not had a problem supporting this game. I am not a whale I spend $15 a month on atoms and the sub literally works out to coming out on top for me and I am sure for many others.
---
see how i get downvote, hahhahah the WHALE POWER IS STRONG ON THIS REDDIT. 
---
hahahhaha so sad, that this community is becoming a cellphone game community
---
Why have Torches and Pitchforks when you have a Torch *on* a Pitchfork?
---
You’re gonna kick yourself in a week when you return and don’t have your stuff anymore :)
---
Lol whatever, Boomer.
---
Or make a real statement and uninstall so they dont get your numbers
---
imagine actually fixing your game
---
It does. It plays little snippets of the music while using the machine
---
Not all of it
---
Private worlds isn’t DLC content.
---
I keep an Anti-Armor Gamma Gun on me and shoot my feet when I want to irradiate myself.  Any Gamma Gun will do, although I'd probably recommend against the Bloodied one simply because it's less predictable.
---
Berry mentats currently has no use as it doesnt work on sneaking players and they no one needs them for PvE. If they used what you said then people would just use that with stealthboys and once again have no counter.
---
Lol @ factual
---
You only get a 4 for that backflip,
---
I can't follow. I like the game and I'm ok with 1st. Because I'm sane. Don't hate fallout, hate capitalism. 
---
Btw why are you still here in this sub? Do you think anyone gives a shit about your incel tears?
---
fallout76 is garbage
---
You cannot run a server that's capable of running a game like this for 5$/month. You're thinking of a cheap PHP server to host a tiny company website, not something that has to actively run simulations for a game like this.
---
Even for the stuff I do we pay a few thousand dollars a month, and that's not in the same league as as running a game engine.
---
I think unreal probably charge a fee for server installations too, so just adding a server/instance causes extra fees.
---
I currently expect they're paying tens of thousands of dollars a month just for servers.
---
People are saying they lied- I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt as so many say it but truthfully I joined on the free weekend- I was not around when they said every dlc is going to be free etc. Maybe that’s why I am not so salty
---
maybe they should bring their engine up to industry standards then lol
---
 it's just way to easy to become over encumbered and coming from FO4: Recycle the Wasteland it's second nature to pick everything up.
---
Youre the one that brought it up, obiviously you do
---
It really is sad to see, imagine paying 60 dollars for an incomplete game and then dishing out another 100 dollars for a year of "private servers" but don't worry guys plenty of cool stuff and NPCs will be here in late 2020. Hope your still playing this boring game.
---
At this point, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.
---
Yes. Especially since Outer Worlds came out. .. Not hard to do with that incentive.
---
If all they offered was the private servers with no additional benefits at the same price, most of the people complaining wouldn't have been complaining.
---
I for one do not like how they locked the scrapbox behind a paywall.
---
Lol incel tears?
---
XD, My man, a genius 😂👊
---
Good luck with all that money
---
Maybe when your parents give you a raise on your allowance you’ll be able to buy one too.
---
I know, I just like to see the responses of brain dead idiots that let past memories of a company cuck their current thoughts of a company.
---
The atoms would be worth $12.99 if people actually took Bethesda’s entirely arbitrary value for them. Do you really think you get your money’s worth for those atoms? Some of the shit like a fucking bed and a potted plant is worth the atoms they give.
---
Not to mention they’re offering a $12.99 A MONTH for that many atoms, whereas the value for atoms is generally for people paying once or twice every once and a while. Nobody conceivably spends that much on atoms consistently. That would be absurd.
---
In other words, compared to the value other games give and compared to what they’ve promised, and compared to the reception and ratings to their game, $12.99 a month for that sad sack of greed is just idiocy.
---
My camp has also a back story want me to tell it 😃?
---
Okay let us talk wise financial. I have 892 hours across two accounts.  I spent $60 on the game, that works out to $0.067XXXX so basically $0.07 an hour for entertainment.   
---
Now I will add my atoms and 1st in that I have spent That is another $0.081813XXX spent per hour.   
---
So currently for my personal entertainment I have spent a whole $0.15 an hour.  I have spent $60 on games that last 10 hours which are acclaimed games and I just didn't get my money's worth. Aside from my hardcore days of WoW this game has literally given me the best bang for my buck..err fifteen cents.   
---
Now tell me how it is a bad thing to help prop the game up for others. I will wait.
---
Buddy I'm a grown man that works for a living. Take your projections somewhere else.
---
The background music that plays while you browse the Atomic Shop.
---
Awesome
---
Bruh... Who's that? Trump jr. 😂
---
Wat?
---
Please go FB and play fortnite.
---
I imagine Bethesda lost alot of money with the Canvas Bag situation &amp; The Nuka Dark Rum, I'm quite sure they are attempting to make that money back somehow....Hello Fallout 1st! Just BGS making these fools cough up the dough to get back in the black before the end of the fiscal year.
---
Too bad people can't put their money towards something more productive.
---
More intellectual thought put in without the Bias anger or favouritism. I prefer his video keeping in time with being neutral then most of the other I’d seen. Just saying his videos give a broader sense of behind the scenes rather you agree or not right.
---
One of the major advantages of GameBryo (the engine that their current engine evolved from) is that the architecture of it allows for modding out of the box with little to no effort on the part of the developer. It's a major part of why Bethesda supports modding their games. The only thing they have to do is provide their editor which means they can easily justify it.
---
Bethesda lied!?
---
I'm shocked.
---
If the timelines matched up, I'd love to have Three Dog on the air.
---
I know. Im just saying in the guys comment, he said you still have to worry about getting over encumbered even if you have an unlimited scrapbox, because you have to fast travel to store it. Was just letting him know thats not the case.
---
They probably just weren’t able to handle any pvp and need a solo world to be able to do anything
---
The fact that you even threw money at bugthesda just proves you're a cash whale. Also the fact that you did all that math and mental gymnastics to assure YOURSELF that you didn't make a bad financial decision is hilarious. You can't change my mind 🤷‍♂️
---
Maybe because they delayed the primary DLC everyone was promised by the end of the year because they didn’t have the time or resources to get it to the “fallout quality” that we’ve all received from this game. Only to surprise everyone a couple days later that their time and resources have actually been spent creating a premium subscription nobody asked for.
---
Wack

You can buy it and store it in your hanger but you can also steal it anytime you want...its on a military base so it won't be easy but not impossible
---
You have a bug where your payout for 100 dollars won't even go through
---
You have disappearing scrap, you private world arent private.
---
Do you honestly think Bethesda is even trying at this point. Honestly tell me. They didn't secure there public domain.
---
Incel refers to white people, I'm black, way to assume my skin tone.
---
Well, we have experience with this kind of behaviour from valve with steam. They have 1$=1€. A 60$ game in US is 60€ in Sweden.
---
So why wouldn't Bethesda behave like that? It's basically common practice with digital stores.
---
 I cant get anyone to care. I'll try again later.
---
That’s the whole deal. It’s just a nominal value. They could said 1 atom if they really wanted be cheeky.
---
Okay. But you see. People lie. Things change. It's life Amigo. As long as wastelanders is free, and I don't have to buy a sub to play the game I won't complain.
---
That's how game press work now, not just videogame magazines and blogs, but also normal youtubers. If they really want to show how "bad" (and I say "bad" because it isn't actually bad) they better play the game, reach level 30 then talk. But not just for 76 but for all games out there folks.
---
They also said that private servers would be paid as far back as 2018.
---
They clearly meant human NPCs as the robots are just repetitive, boring placeholders that are forgettable
---
I don’t buy atoms, but others do. They usually spend more on atoms, so $100 for 19,800 atoms is a good deal.
---
If you don’t see the value, just don’t buy it. It’s simple as that. I’m not buying and don’t see a need to throw a temper tantrum about it lol.
---
 Yup a vacuum just stays a vacuum.
---
Since when do Betty Mentats not highlight players who are using Stealthboys? I don't PvP, but I do remember hearing that it was a useful counter.
---
What system you on?
---
my camp too has a story. i got bored and taped some junk together. it then turned into an elevated house with built in store
---
you are the reason the game is shit, and Bethesda keep raping us over and over (bc at this point is becoming that)
---
Thank to ppl like you and other that will trow money at Bethesda for any stupid shit they try to sell you, the game bc a sub service to something promise to be free. 
---
AND YEAH IT WAS PROMISE.
---
He also told us early on that there *would* be microtransactions. He was talking specifically about new content in that quote.
---
Lol what a bunch of clowns! Meanwhile, I'll just keep my pacifist mode on and not take workshops. Problem solved. Because with my Fallout 1st subscription I can have every workshop all to myself and all the materials that come with them in my own private world.
---
It's pointless to be an asshat because it's so easy to ignore. So go ahead and grief and then enjoy your limited stash of materials
---
My point is that it’s funny they would put such a low value on your time spent playing the game, while they value ugly outfits and camp items higher. How do you people not get that?
---
I don’t think they are forgettable. Why does it matter if they hve human skin or metal? Their personalities are exactly the same. Anyway, they said no NPCs and I responded to clarify and then you jumped in to tell me I’m wrong lol
---
Not everyone has the ability to mule?
---
Source?
---
Is the scrap box fixed
---
I hope that Wastelanders freshens up the music a bit too.  Nuclear Winter has some dedicated tracks.
---
So. Please remove the posts that make me unhappy?
---
A grown man wouldn't worry what another man does with their money. Think about that for a second.
---
Whats the point of this post? You think they are going to rent an aws server for every subscriber? Do you even know how servers work? omegalol mate what can i say. I guess thats how a fallout 76 superfanboy-post with zero technical knowledge looks like.
---
You're still crying like a baby.
---
I didn't pay for first, yet.
---
They said they want to make it possible to only let in people that you invite.
---
The disappearing scrap is a bug. Not the first, you should be used to it. Software sometimes has bugs.. and they will fix it
---
Wait you said it was not a wise financial decision, I showed you the math for me and all you come back with is an attack because you have nothing else after I proved you wrong. And yeah spending $15 a month on a game is nothing to me I spend more on clothes in a month. Hell I spend $125 a month on coffee going out with friends.   
---
So all you got is your are poor and feel entitled. Be gone brokeass normie.
---
I don't actually care, but it's not illegal to laugh at people's poor financial decisions. Think about that for a second.
---
The sacrifice has been made and it seems fixed!
---
Yeah Wow and Eve still going strong since you were running around the house in diapers shitting green.
---
Try again clown
---
That's totally fine by me. They dont like it they can use their own private servers lol
---
He did. He also said that microtransactions would be cosmetic only. We all know how that turned out.
---
But yeah no, let’s pretend like a totally new gameplay feature wouldn’t be considered new content and pretend like he didn’t mean “all” when he said “all.” Whatever rustles your jimmies my dude.
---
I mean I don't have anything to prove to some loser over the internet that is projecting their insecurities onto other people. But nice try, trying to hurt my feelings and all. That was cute 🤣
---
What's that mean?
---
Dude, they’re not making an atom bundle, they’re throwing atoms into something that should be free, to justify the insane price. The atoms themselves are not worth that price to most people. People make fun of the fact that the atoms they’re gifted in return for their troubles with the canvas bags can’t even afford the canvas bag IN GAME. Furthermore it’s not even the issue. You fanboying for Bethesda and using their own horseshit pay scale for atoms is meaningless, and misses the entire point of most arguments. 
---
The issue is, they’re throwing content that was promised and should’ve been free behind a paywall. A REOCCURRING paywall of $12.99 a month which is absolutely ridiculous. Their atom store is already ridiculously overpriced but at least it’s cosmetic only (for the most part).  That means people don’t actually mind the content being behind a paywall because it’s cosmetic and not important.
---
This however is just some ploy get those most gullible to hand them cash every month for a value the vast majority of people don’t agree with, for content that was promised free from day one. If you don’t see how that’s “tantrum” worthy, feel free to cease fellating Todd Howard.
---
Your first mistake was being on FB.
---
Yes, but did you solo it without getting killed?
---
Oh really? So if somebody were to say that upvotes are useless, their self-worth is now decided by internet points because they brought the topic up? Not how the world works, bub.
---
Who are you to tell someone what to spend their money on?
---
Accept reality and move on. How much time and effort do you actually want to spend flinging your own poo? Is Beth full of shit? Yes. Are you still playing? Yes.  Look at the positives or just find one of the many cool games our there to enjoy.
---
Hating on other players really sticks it to Beth, they care SO much about each and every one of us, it just tears them up inside when someone griefs one of us.
---
I like this idea. Adding the "create your own robot" mechanic from Fallout 4 would be fantastic, I've been wanting a tuxedo wearing butler robot like they have in Whitesprings in my camp for ages. Or just let us "decorate" our scraptron robots.
---
The one thing that drives me nuts is how 
---
1. They suck at the game but are "big" fallout fans 
---
2. As fans they don't know or understand basic lore
---
3. As "Content Creators" all they ever do is play on PC and therefore don't understand how consoles work and report activity on PCs as gospel. 
---
And this 1 thing is a Fallout 76 only problem the whole "oh Bethesda can make stash bigger, if you pay". OMG that being tossed around is driving me fucking nuts. 
---
Mind you I think the Scrap Box being behind a pay wall is stupid.
---
No, it’s not illegal. 
---
It’s just childish.
---
Sorry. I work for a living.
---
&gt;Hell I spend $125 a month on coffee going out with friends
---
That's a lie, a quick look through of your post history suggests that you spend 125 a month on star wars dolls and gaming and arcade subscriptions. Loooool what a character you are.
---
You’re cool.
---
I just don’t think WE should have to fit the bill for their declining sales which are caused by their mistakes and broken promises, solely. And I think that us being told to warrants anger and hostility; if we can’t protest false advertising then what can we protest?
---
Not really, but go off. 🤣
---
Servers arent private. Problem solved.
---
I get that it limits your ability to become economically OP, but gear weight in general has always just been an obstacle, rather than a feature to me.
---
And also, I historically play as low strength toons. So it's a point of frustration often.
---
It’s a bug, exit your server and immediately load back in and they will respawn
---
See. This is what they want. They want people to be fine with them lying.
---
Brilliant system. 
---
$60 up front
---
$60 every two years (or every year now) in expansions 
---
$180 a year in subscription
---
Gets pricey fast if you aren't playing all the time. At least the base game is free now. 
---
F76 should be free now too.
---
I'm not crying. Bug after a YEAR AND A HALF.
---
So i be used to the next fallout game loading screen shutting down each time I load the game 5 years after the relase date.
---
You are wrong! The only time you’ve been right in the arguments we keep having is the time played on the menu lol I said there are only like 3 unique robots, meaning truly unique, not a protectron or gutsy reskin. Rose gets a pass, because she’s a human conscience in a robot. Modus is a super computer, that’s fine. Grafton mayor is an annoying piece of shit panel. There are no NPCs except for 5 robots that are annoying and uninteresting. Oh, and a dumbass super mutant
---
Never be afraid to say something you think is positive.  There will always be rude people who will shit on anything you say.
---
And no one has to justify to you how they spend their money. 
---
I get it. You don’t like the idea of Fallout First. Cool. 
---
But how is it any concern of yours how someone spends ***their*** money?
---
"Hey, is anyone compiling?"
---
Please play something else and leave this sub.
---
&gt;Be gone brokeass normie.
---
Also find it ironic your calling me broke, yet you work at Panera bread making 10 dollars an hour warming up soup lol
---
Does fortnite let you earn v bucks by playing the game?
---
Yes.  And here they are putting a price tag on new content. How can you be okay with that?
---
I get that and I don't love the fact they keep changing their stance. I do love the game and the people I've met and spent so much time with though and if Beth need to change things to keep their revenue up... I find it hard to be angry at them.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism
---
Yep I am a loser, such a loser... I lose so so much in life.... Okay kid you win since I am so insecure with answering a question from a statement you had made.  I am so glad Trump is in office to have you type of people just show up everywhere.
---
Yes, the cosmetic only part was a lie, but this isn't.  
---
Where's the new gameplay that subscribers are supposedly getting here?
---
maybe our parents should have taught you morality and that your actions have consequences we all pay for.
---
I am on xbox and I did not know that at all. If I had a decent group I would probably try it again
---
His quote talked about how they would never cross the line for cosmetics though, going on to say how other companies do but 76 would stay cosmetic only. This is why Bethesda retracted their statement in an announcement about a week before launching this service.
---
A grown man would realize that people that buy into this are why there is a high probablity elderscrolls 6 will be shit, because they are teaching bethsda they can fuck everyone over as much as they want, and some people will bend over and ask for more.
---
Should  I trust it with my stuff
---
What concern of yours is how concerned I am about how someone spends *their* money?
---
Gamma gun. Some random one that dropped from an enemy.
---
it's cute how people fucking up gaming think they are the ones being abused.   Reality check here, you guys are whats going to fuck up elderscrolls, so hope your happy.
---
Ok I just wanted to come back point out that $26 for lunch every day is just under $9500 a year. That’s almost a whole third of what I make in year (with two degrees and six years of experience and a bunch of student loan debt) FOR LUNCH. What about the other meals? If we assume half as much for breakfast and twice as much for dinner that’s 30k just for meals. Either you’re grossly exaggerating or you’re way wealthier than you assume you are and it makes me think we could feed hundreds off of your yearly food budget alone.
---
Wrong again
---
Everybody Liked That
---
sadly they do not.. maybe his great great great great grandfather, -3 Dog
---
“All.”
---
Largely because this isn't new content. Everything except private servers and the monthly atoms is just crap that could've been tossed into the atom shop. It's not dlc.
---
My wife works at Panera as a baker making $16 an hour I asked a question for her. I own a coffee roastery in the Charlotte area and two rental properties. I am 41 she is 35, got anything else you need brokeass normie.   
---
Nice job though showing you were so butthurt you had to go through my posts.
---
Thank you. That worked... but I lost my workshops. Grr.
---
Actually, no they didnt. Let me give a brief explanation. The people who are upset choose to be that way. Instead of just leaving the game and uninstalling it, they choose to come on here and make a fuss and complain. The key word is CHOOSE.  These people choose to be that separate "faction" you're speaking of. If I dont like or play a game, I mind my business. Problem solved.
---
Wish they would add blank protest signs that we could customize like the billboard in the atom shop!
---
Is the actual "bug" that the nuke explosion kills whatever Ghouls were initially there?
---
Why are you like this.
---
Okay I admit I am the minority....I dislike ESO so I do not care.
---
r/thathappened 🙄🤣
---
Bullshit, been playing with the 1st icon whole day, not a single encounter. Try harder.
---
NW has Solo and Squads already (queue solo and do NOT select Fill Team, or queue at Main Menu with your squad).  Do you mean you want separate servers that are Solo ONLY, and Squad ONLY?
---
Yeah that is just going to make the wait to launch take even longer.  No thank you.
---
These clowns actually believe it's because we can't afford it. 
---
How fucking clueless they are.
---
Whatever floats your boat, kid.
---
Scrap doesn't weigh 0, the scrapbox put the game on par with every other Fallout.  I was tired of playing "Fallout: the inventory simulator" and this is one of the most welcome changes they've put into FO76.  Locking it behind a paywall is the real thing people deserve to be upset about.
---
Yeah unfortunately that happens, if I’m wanting to farm a nuke zone I don’t take workshops (you can also reload back into a private server once YOU kill them all and they will respawn again essentially giving you infinite bloated glowing ones)
---
It means that anyone on your friends list can join your "private server" and grief you if they wish
---
HAHAHAHAHA you bought a subscription hahahahahahhahahaha
---
Absolutely love it
---
Ehhh...you don't need a group...just need to know how to fly....and to make money grab your own private server that way your not getting blown up...just adjust your game internet settings manually....leave everything the same when it ask only change your MTU..should be 1500 when you look change to 800...its not hard to make money just gotta know how
---
I’m not sure how it works but that sounds right, it’s happened to me and a few others and that fix has always worked though
---
Not entirely, I had my doubts since the first day it released so I left all my valuables ballistic fiber, acid, and most of the things I use and sell in the regular stash. I still lost a lot of things, but had my useful backups. I still don't completely trust it and still have my important things in the original stash.
---
I said the same and got downvoted to shit. This sub is bi polar as shit
---
Exactly my point. 
---
If I have no valid reason to be concerned about your opinion, you have no valid reason to be concerned about *theirs*.
---
You paid for a private server, but it's not actually private. That's what he means.
---
Just quit the game already. Bye.
---
The new Halloween themed music is nice but sorry I'm still not paying $7 for orange and black turrets
---
well I mean elderscrolls 6, you have to realize that right now fallout 76 is the breeding ground to fuck over future projects like starfield and elderscrolls 6, just have to look at wolfenstein and rage 2 to see some of that starting.   Hell they even made rage 2 has MTX dlc, which is one of the scumier things I've seen, since normally dlc while shitty at times, least you pay the price you pay.
---
I realize I'm a bit angry, just... wouldn't care if people want to waste their money on shitty stuff, if the last 2 years hasn't shown just how quickly 1 game doing shitty stuff that is profitable spreads to most comapnies.
---
Not yet. But nice assumption.
---
When you start a question with So, it means all the stuff after that is made up. Its you implying information that justifies your point of view but isn't part of what was originally said. Pretty weak stuff dude
---
And why you so mad at me, I gave you some upvotes
---
Yup a vacuum just stays a vacuum.
---
I'm leaving for the same reasons.  I've preordered every BGS game since Oblivion.  I did a collection for Morrowind and a mod for Oblivion (DarkUI) that got mentions in print magazines.  I brought dozens of people to their products, and was one of their proponents for years.  They've gone so far over the edge, starting with wanting to monetize mods and culminating in this.    
---
I'm not boycotting.  I'll still buy Bethesda products, but where I've always preordered, now I'll wait for reviews, multiple patches, and give the game enough time that I can see if they're up to any other 'ideas' on ways to monetize the game before I even consider buying them.
---
Lol, your not gonna change my mind buddy just quit while your ahead. I don't understand what your trying to accomplish.
---
No I will leave this server. Just like how you can be an ass to people I can be an ass to you and downvote your comments.
---
Tbf though, playing low strength is a choice you're making. You're actually suggesting that the chest both changes the entire game's balance and negates some of the roleplaying involved in playing a character with underdeveloped strength.
---
You don’t need to hate your own experience to be angry at a corporation. Disney for example, is as close to evil corporate empire as you can get in the real world but that doesn’t mean that their artistic content is without any value because Disney is not the collective effort of the artists they employ. Same with Bethesda. 
---
But they could keep their revenue up if some of the guys at the top took a note from Nintendo’s president and boards playbook and reduced their own salary to fix their own mess.
---
All of it's new gameplay? Or are you just repeating yourself because you think it helps prove your point?
---
Disappointed in the atomic shop in its existence. Bethesda like. Hey. We cuntinue to fuck up the game through breaking it by trying to fix it. Pay us money yeah.
---
Good luck... level 604 and I P2W so you already lost.
---
You sound so entitled it's actually impressive
---
I found that I had to copy fo76.exe to an alternate name (fo76\_alt.exe) in order to have both processes running at the same time.
---
But yes absolutely able to run multiple game instances at the same time on 1 PC.  Recommend running in a smaller resolution and Tiling your display.
---
Thank you
---
He should follow the Plan
---
Or that they half assed the private servers and they're reinstanced regular servers.
---
Glowing blood with traveling pharmacy is pretty light
---
Hell yeah! They deserve it for supporting terrible business practices. Fuck em.
---
That’s my hypothesis.
---
And then being the only one on the server there is no one else there to trigger more spawns
---
We’d have to try on worlds where other players are on, or see what happens if a friend joins after the bomb drops
---
So I actually think it’s working as designed, the design just wasn’t intended for single player servers
---
I can't believe this kind of subject get only 13 upvote while bullshits raise up to 1.9k and +, it's maybe why we have this issue since almost a year now, problems get ignored yet drama stay in front pages.
---
Could be your username? Also people usually seem to click on whichever vote the comment has more of. So if the first couple people that saw your comment downvoted it, more people will downvote. The first few that saw mine upvoted so more will upvote. Idk tho I'm a stoner not a psychoanalyst or whatever. 
---
Regardless, downvoted you just to keep the peace 🙃
---
Well don’t you think it’s time to cut your losses? It’s been a year now, let it go and move on.
---
I just joined my buddies private server without an invite. If they are on your friends list they can join. Read something sometime.
---
&gt;"private" servers
---
I'd suggest that's the difference between a survival game (where you the player are dealing with situations and your character is just a conduit) and roleplaying games where your character's abilities and thought process are a consideration.
---
Collecting everything is just using fo4 to play minecraft.
---
God forbid somebody be displeased about a game that they wanted to enjoy.
---
$120 non-online DLC lol
---
other people can camp npc spawns ...take loot that is outside of containers (loot in containers are instanced...outside are not) and its been reported that private servers when you are the only person in it actually makes the game a bit more stable less lag ..loading issues etc.
---
"That sounds like communist talk" 
---
Oh shut up. Not bowing down to corporations and their greedy cash grabs is in no way communist. 
---
We should "bitch and moan" about it. People like you are the reason companies keep doing this. Because people don't get angry enough. They know  people will buy it so they keep making it. They won't stop until people stoo buying it.
---
I am afraid that people will find it worthwhile, because it really isn't except to crazy people. 100 dollars a year for the same game except without an other people and a broken scrapbox is a scam. Especially when they said it would be free. Every single fan should be completely up in arms over this.
---
🙄
---
Even getting the mod that showed me weight based on item category only helped a little. I want to spend my time exploring and collecting, and since you can't really build anything amazing like a legendary out of scrap, and even just the good stuff requires rare plans, I'm not sure how giving scrap weight doesn't just unnecessarily burden the player with the inventory management minigame way too much.
---
Check your scapbox and make sure its still there. People are reporting stuff going missing, and not just a graphics display glitch like BGS is ~~saying~~ lying about.
---
Honestly y’all deserve it for supporting poor decision making. This is coming from a day one player, and not some non-playing troll.
---
Yep. They really bragged on the cosmetic only part of it.
---
*To prove your hypocrisy.*
---
You can’t legitimately whine about someone having an opinion about your position while simultaneously griping about someone having their own opinion. 
---
It’s not about whether or not you have a right to your opinion. It’s about you clearly being salty when your hypocrisy is pointed out. 
---
Thanks for being so obliging!  That was far easier than I thought it would be.
---
yeah...it's annoying, I don't care what people do with their money hugely other then I think it's sleezy how comapnies prey on people, I care what that means for me down the road.   At this point AAA first party games are about the only AAA that are safe, sure there are some that are safe, but most arn't, it's really at this point 1st party AAA, some like obsidian and such,and AA and indies.
---
This is about the weight of the scrap putting you over the limit, not the weight of unscrapped items.
---
More promises.
---
I am white, own 3 properties out right  (off the backs of those hurt in the last recession at that), I have my own business, and want for nothing. I am entitled I know this, but at least I am not some 1%'er asshole just a middle class one.
---
My god you're absolutely pathetic 😂😂
---
Is it your job to white knight for a video game? Keep seeing you in threads being this vile miscreant who gets his thong twisted when someone has an opinion you dont like.
---
How sad your life must actually be to get this worked up over one of the literal worst gaming products ever made.
---
For the schadenfreude.
---
That was me exercising my god given right to laugh at someone's financial decision, not necessarily toward you. But if you did - HAHAHHAHAAHAH YOU BOUGHT A SUBSCRIPTION HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
So instead of fixing these issues they are going to put it behind a paywall? That's not okay. Imagine if other games made you pay to fix lag and loading issues.
---
There's nothing immersive about it.  Immersive would be scrap piles, not stash boxes.  And piles can get as big as you want them to be.  Stash limit is not immersive for post apocalypse, hoarding would be.
---
You get 0 points for that backflip.
---
I might get down voted for this but I remember it fondly.
---
They mentioned private servers and no one knew if it was free or if it was paid. The only thing we could go off of was that it was called a "service," so all we could assume is that it was a possibility. But even still they only called it a service in articles and not interviews (could be wrong about that little part) so not at the first mention. 
---
As for whether private servers should cost, the way they work they *have* to cost. If PCs could host a server that shouldn't be paid. But that's not what we're talking about.
---
Yea he separates his opinion when he has one out from the news
---
On the one hand this bug upsets me... on the other hand I'm upset at myself for wanting to work so hard for the fucking nickel Bethesda gives as challenge rewards.
---
“Why fix it if we’re still making money off of those idiots? Pass the fucking caviar.”
---
&gt; I despise having to micromanage inventory. I want to play the game. Instead, I'm constantly micromanaging my hunger and thirst now.
---
Heaven forbid they ask you to roleplay in your role-playing game.
---
Numbers and bottom line are king in entertainment and business. Sadly it’s the dwindling numbers that have led to this cash grab subscription.
---
"Almost never" Certainly for people who are trying to get into the game, the convenience might make it a bit more accessible no?
---
Who gives a fuck it's the internet 🤣🤣🤣 you sound like such a loser right now. "Hurrr durr, I won an internet argument, I'll take my achievement trophy now" hahahaha
---
It seems like people are getting down votes for either view point
---
segregation imo
---
You know, when people talk about why this the micro transactions are a bad thing, they bring up the fact gullible people will see value in the garbage.
---
Like, for example, unlimited junk storage. You know, the artificial limitation that Bethesda put in place to sell Fallout first? [or maybe its not artificial, since the stash boxes seem to be eating junk, idk.]
---
How so? My theory is backed by Buttfistas track record of moving the line in the sand, and yours?
---
I think this is just your experience based on how you play. If it took me only 2 minutes to get to my base, scrap all the stuff I want to scrap, bundle the scrapped stuff, then toss it in storage (first I have to make room in storage...), I don't think those of us complaining would be complaining.
---
“Let me give a brief explanation”??    Please enlighten me oh wise one.
---
DLC was not a bad idea but the hate pushed the bounds of loot boxes and now with governments looking to label them as gambling all companies are scrambling to find alternatives. While not completely harmless I can see this becoming more and more of a thing for games online a standard service and a more premium style.
---
Because this is an rpg/survival game, not destiny.
---
They have yet to release an actual DLC. The first one will be wastelanders and it's going to be free so what's your point?
---
Logic.

You can get the same info by doing a date span search around October of 2018 in google

A shameless one at that. This actually really is impressive. You guys are rare. TRUMP2020!

The reflex sight color of the ultracite laser gun remains the same green as the regular laser gun. Set to the same navy color as ultracite laser gun.
---
You’ll punish Bethesda by having your fun and spending your money on games that aren’t theirs. Like Outerworlds.

It stopped working months ago

I dig it. I’d like to have pumpkin power armor there, spooky armor paints and more though.

"Private Servers
---
There are a few issues cropping up here. Fallout 1st players are finding that a “newly created” world they might be heading into is not actually new at all. Players are reporting dead NPCs and looted areas when they get there, implying that these are not actually new instances, but instead re-used old instances masquerading as brand new private worlds.
---
The “private” aspect is up for debate too. Players with big friends lists, ie. merchants who sell players goods in the game, are finding that they can’t prevent people from joining their private servers where they just want to relax and play by themselves or with a few friends. Without some sort of “invisible” mode, other players can see your instance and join it."
---
Thats a direct quote from a forbes review on fallout 1st. Posted 1 day ago.
---
You mean 1-Dog lol. The first one.
---
No, remove posts that are just spam.
---
Hey I mean you gotta do something in the end. I'll fling my poo wherever I like.
---
Who are they to tell me how to spend my time lmao. If they wanna make poor choices then they have to deal with the consequences
---
Imagine bragging about that. What a joke haha
---
Happy cake day!
---
I agree! Why should a roleplaying game ever make you consider the needs of your character or ask you to play a role?!
---
I think next you should move on to something else
---
That’s why you go with the yearly thing. It’d be 8.33 a month if my math’s right. Even then you’re not really missing out on much. Unlimited scrap=/=unlimited stash, the fast travel stuff is pretty cheap anyway as it is, and playing the game alone just seems boring, the only thing that seems like a perk is the atoms and the armor and i’m pretty sure the armor will eventually come to the atom shop anyway
---
Game declared dead. Support stops.
---
It’s become self aware.
---
I mean... Can't they? It seems think the claim it was a technical limitation was hogwash.
---
Why does someone need to help or do anything for you in order for them to not be banned?
---
The way this sub has reacted to things of late. I’m surprised no one is accusing them of charging per ammo spent in the future.
---
"shitting on a great game" I don't think great games release unfinished full of bugs and takes months to release patches but alright man.
---
No issues yet.   It's been liberating.
---
Literally thousands of people playing.  Problem is on your end I'm afraid.
---
Were you trying to join Nuclear Winter, or Adventure Mode.  I could see NW taking a long time to find a game.
---
What kind of insane bugs did you encounter with your newbie character?
---
It's funny you mention this, some ~150 level douchebags in ranger armour were bashing and shooting at me during collision course, then proceeded to take a workshop from a level 7 lol... Seems like they're on adventure to grief people, can't get that on a private servers
---
I'll let my kid know, who bought me a month's sub.
---
I'll tell him some asshole is crying online because his feelers are hurt. 
---
I'll get back to you later with his thoughts.
---
Ah so a lot us just missed that Bethesda found a way to effectively force us to pay for mods. Well now I’m even angrier at the game and at myself for buying it. And for defending it at launch and for supporting it during the flack it got around Nuclear Winter.
---
The lore sounds like it's coming from a grandstanding and arrogant survivalist, together with the FreeStates Flag and it being contemporal, well done.
---
But still, not very presidential, and one building does not make a capitol.
---
Charged 4.99 everytime you shoot your gun
---
I'd agree if they weren't going to be pay-gated
---
Naw I dislike Trump. The first dem that says I will do away with tariffs will get my vote and my money.  I mean we are giving farmers welfare to the tune of 28 billion.
---
48 hours is all the 15 year olds can focus on
---
I'm my day we got dexies from the doctor for that
---
Lol I’m not the one who set $15 of their own money on fire. I’m making fun of you; the opposite of crying.
---
Exactly. This stuff was extremely easy to make and low effort. They are charging $100 a year for it. They said all microtransactions would be cosmetic and besides that all content would be free. They lied and are charging an outrageous price for it.
---
5.99 for song packs and you got yerself a deal partner
---
Thats actually funny
---
Bethesda probably didn't lose any money with Nuka Dark. They most likely got paid for licensing like they do with their hundreds of other priloducts and let the third party who specializes in it's production handle everything else.
---
Aww, someone got mad they got called out on their bullshit. 
---
That’s adorable!
---
I really don't understand why this is taken personally, I couldn't give a crap what Pete or Todd have or will say. I don't know them.
---
I enjoy the game  -  so I play it.
---
The day I stop enjoying it, is the day I stop playing .
---
You can play this game and beat everything without picking up scrap is my point. Crafting is worthless except for the beginning and middle.
---
Well I"ll give you a plus one for that at least.
---
Just going to have to do it again next time Bethesda royally screws the pooch with this game and a new flood of angry posts hit the reddit.
---
How am I mad? I'm literally laughing at your miserable ass. You thought you actually did something. 
---
That's adorable!
---
Online games need to be making money to continue updating, devs need to paid, content needs to be funded. MMOs can't run in the negatives. By buying something or paying into something, the OP is giving money to the continued development of 76 so you don't have to.
---
You mean roleplay in the role-playing game? Unthinkable!
---
No worries, I know there is fun to be had, they just do the opposite of what my gamer instincts tell me is good for the title. They make things choppy when it didn't have to be.
---
Yeah, this is why it's a part of a project. There are multiple camps that my group is building around the same area. As far as it being "presidential" it's hard to remake the White House in the Apocalpyse and it was more modeled off of something like the President's Home from early US history. As for the grandstanding, that's done on purpose (the elites being the ones who stayed in the vault lol)
---
Plan?? What have you got scrap to get that?
---
I do my robot dance on purpose I love the salt it brings
---
This is the solution right here.
---
Same. Thank you for putting it this way. I was wondering if maybe it’s just that I’m so used to the model in ESO that I wasn’t thinking about it critically enough when FO1st launched, but I couldn’t help thinking “it’s about time” when I read about it.
---
Projecting much?
---
Its just people fallowing that angry mexican guy and bearded incel king
---
100% incorrect on old server theory.
---
👍🏻
---
Sure, it’s your right. 
---
It’s also my right to laugh at your childish opinion.
---
Yeah you guys need your own private subreddit for $10 a month
---
Wouldn't be surprised at this point. People forget that the data miners found Lunch boxes (loot boxes) in the game files with things like XP boosters, damage boosters, and a bunch of other shit grade crapium that would make the game about how much money you could blow. Problem isn't Bethesda at this point its the community of whales that support them. They get so mad that you question/mocking their purchasing decisions that they downvote everything.
---
Fallout 1$T
---
Same hate from the release. Some deserved but mostly blown out of proportion. Game is good as it's ever been and still has wastelander coming out, although it was delayed till first quarter of 2020. Dont believe the hate on the internet, its always exaggerated.
---
You need a pair of glasses buddy.
---
Imagine being 44-45 years old and still arguing on the internet lol. Loser
---
A few posts are from people that literally say they don’t play the game... others say they uninstalled it... 
---
None actually show the angry poster deleting their characters... go figure... 
---
If they want to be taken seriously... delete your characters showing their name or GT’s then maybe we’ll take them .01% more seriously...lol
---
I think it's all a pubblicity stunt, a brillant  and genious pubblicity. Like "Hey guys it's all an halloween prunk, here wastelanders"
---
Such a nice guy but no I never lost any junk
---
I know. I just keep a close eye on it and know about how much I can carry. As soon as I'm close to the limit I go right to my camp or other stash location and deposit it.  If I'm over in terms of scrap I quickly bulk stuff and sell it off.  
---
I spend very little time in menus when it comes to junk in all forms.
---
I think the scrap box is the biggest issue people have with 1st. If it was made available to everyone. Maybe craftable with flux or something, things would settle down.
---
Capitalism gonna capitalize. People get mad at it when they don’t/can’t benefit from it themselves.
---
Gta is free online from what I remember. That sounds more reasonable than shelling out 13 dollars for a developer that is leeching off its fan base
---
Ahah you're delusional. No wait you're SPECIAL.
---
Here ya go. (reddit gold)
---
Yes, but your problem there is your moronic choices ends up ruining games for everyone
---
I literally paid $13 for this game from a redbox machine. And I consider it a good deal. But yeah if I paid full price or invested alot of time in this game. I could see how this is beyond annoying. Especially considering the company and how they rarely miss this badly.
---
Move on... or be the crazy ex that won’t let go... play it, uninstall it what ever... literally the only people that care are NO LONGER playing so why would people that do play care?
---
They wouldn’t...
---
lol keep crusading a dead cause my guy
---
This, I'd add that swapping weapons restores the weapon to normal
---
You know your comment history is public right?
---
If you can’t relate to the discussion then don’t participate in it. Because some of us care very much about what our money goes to, even when our entertainment is concerned.
---
As I understand from your suggestion If I left and relog to my private server it is still the same server. But what happens if I relog with diffirent character?
---
I bout the yeti black edition with fallout 76 for $50 at best buy
---
You got him to delete his post lolol
---
*shrug* I remember conversations about this after this was said. People quickly buried it under all their plans of roleplaying even though we knew nothing how the game was going to work at the time.
---
Nobody seemed to care or just assumed it would work out. It was laid out for us. Bethesda was very upfront about wanting to monetize the server. And is there any surprise? How do you have a game with paid cosmetics but allow people to have their own server with mods? People would just take the cosmetic and mod it to their server
---
Kid, you’re clearly mad that someone is spending their money on something they enjoy that you disagree with. 
---
You’d have never posted anything in the first place otherwise.
---
God, this is too easy.
---
Thanks dude, I’m not gonna be on now until tomorrow AM - I’m from the UK - gamer tag ThatGuyOwen be awesome if you guys could help me I’m so bad lol
---
That doesn’t surprise me that they are. It’s a shame the community is now divided because of these poor decisions by Bethesda. The people who are angry about this shouldn’t be playing if they want to protest then instead of hunting others with subscriptions. You grieving them actually backfires because their are multiple scenarios as to why you shouldn’t.
---
1. The person canceled their subscription to keep the benefits for a month then get a refund. Which means they did it as a middle finger to Bethesda. (You are basically harassing someone who feels the same way as you do)
---
2. The person you are targeting is a PvP player (raider) who will take _your_ junk, put it into the infinite scrap box, then harass you instead.
---
3. The player probably you are targeting doesn’t even care and you are wasting your time on here.
---
Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day. Every login. Every purchase. This stuff is tracked by Bethesda. You want change? Stop playing then. It’s that simple. Unfortunately reddit is the minority and we alone don’t have much power in stopping people who want to pay for a subscription service that gives an unfair advantage.
---
Haha ok
---
For sure. Some people saw Skyrim as a bad game (Because of bugs) 76 just slaps good ideas with a bad twist at every available opportunity.
---
Made a post about this the day Fallout 1st was announced, people said that wasn't gonna happen. Well, there you go. Class struggle in Appalachia.
---
Whatever helps you sleep better at night. Though star wars dolls? You mean the tabletop Star Wars? I play both Armada and X-Wing. Yeah I spend a ton more than that on average.  How you are trying to shame someone for spending their money on tabletop gaming trying to make it out as something different but man I must have really struck a nerve for you to be digging so deep.   
---
Are you that sad and lonely? If you live in western NC you are welcome to come to game night one night you can meet some people hell I will even buy you some coffee.
---
infinite storage behind what is basically a subscription is bullshit. It's like I'm watching a old friend slowly committing suicide.
---
Hey man, would be awesome if you could help. I’m gonna be on the game tomorrow now - but add my gamer tag and drop me a message that would be awesome if you could help me launch a Nuke. I keep getting fucked
---
“MMOs can’t run in the negatives” and with that statement it’s obvious you’ve drunk the koolaid. If you think this game is even remotely close to being in the red then you’re sadly mistaken. This is a cash grab plain and simple, sorry you’re too blinded by your fandom to see that. 
---
Remember what was promised, all DLC free.. this is DLC it should be free. Quit shilling.
---
What would Goku say? 😞
---
Youre here trolling for arguments by trying to put others down and give yourself that special feeling of internet superiority
---
I think the main issue is that there has been no new content in 4 months, but multiple new forms of monetization/changing of monetization strategies.
---
Thanks man,
---
I’ll reply to this thread if still needed
---
As they should be
---
FB?? Sorry but it’s literally worse here on Reddit... in this forum you see posts from people who admit they don’t even play Fallout posting... 
---
Guess they don’t have any better game to play so they choose to join a Fallout 76 subreddit and trash it... makes total sense and excellent use of time and energy...lol
---
At least I know how to reply in the right sequence in a Reddit thread, son. 
---
Nope was just stating my opinion, you chose to reply. Now move on if you don't like it.
---
Imagine being a boring hater with nothing else interesting to do. Ah no wait, you don't need to imagine that.
---
Love it!😊
---
It's worth it in atoms alone. ESO's subscription is like that; you're basically paying for premium currency and getting bonuses. Only, over there, the dlc isn't free and you have to either buy them one at a time or subscribe.  
---
$100 a year isn't bad for subscription either. It breaks down to like $8 and some change per month and you're getting 1650 atoms for that. Plus private servers and all those other little bonuses.
---
“Why make it work if people already pay for it? Doesn’t that mean its already working? Pass the caviar.”
---
-Zenimax Media Group
---
Hmm, was the box empty for both characters?
---
Who the fook is this guy? Hahahaha
---
I don't think it is needed. However I do support it simply because it turns out they can do it and lied about it.  This is one of those things that everyone should get it or no one should get it. Or at least require people to start an entirely new character that is restricted to private servers only and give them unlimited storage only on those servers.
---
Bethesda has somehow made a beloved armor into the symbol of anger hahaha.
---
Nothing.  A lot of people are just NPCs that do whatever their favorite duplicitous douchbag Youtuber tells them to do without subjecting any of what they say nor their old plagiarized recycled footage of bugs AT LAUNCH to scrutiny.
---
People are butthurt because they think the game is going P2W, which is ridiculous if your really think about it. How can a fallout game, with the plot based around rebuilding WV with your fellow vault dwellers, be considered P2W at all? P2W is a term coined by the competitive gaming industry. And last time i checked, theres nothing competitive in the base game anymore. So how is anyone getting " the advantage " over anyone when its a non competitive game. They just dont want to pay for features, that honestly should be in the game for free. They have every right to be mad, theyre just mad for the wrong reasons and its getting very, very old.
---
That's true... If you're playing it like boarderlands and not a roleplaying game.
---
All I'm saying is that there's going to be a clear spilt on this issue between general gamers (where you, the player, are interacting with the world) and people trying to roleplay (see the world through the eyes of their characters).    
---
A character doesn't have bis grear... They don't have slots.
---
If the game had real personal, persistent servers, like Ark or Minecraft, us roleplayers could all go off to a private server with survival/RPG mods turned on and leave you normies alone.   
---
Until that's a thing we'll probably disagree with a lot of 'convenience' things in the name of roleplaying (don't get me started on how switching perk cards undermines the concept of characters or character development - I would be very annoying).
---
Some kind of music subscription perhaps?
---
Hope so. A newly instanced server should not load with events already activated and mobs already dead.
---
I haven’t been able to test this because I only have one character but I’m assuming as long as you load into the private server again fast enough it should work regardless
---
I don't have the time to be playing that much therefore, scrap at 0 makes sense for me
---
At least you admit to being a loser and for that take an upvote.
---
Thanks for being so normal haha. I truly hope they use the extra revenue from fallout first to upgrade the servers in general or do whatever they need to to make more stability. It does get annoying when I dashboard time after time and lose work shops or loot
---
No hate here, kid. Just pure amusement at the triggered whiners that think their opinion about how someone spends their money has any value whatsoever. 
---
😘
---
Her keywords still show as an animal.
---
I did the toxic goo thing. I did the gamma gun thing. I tried glowing blood and never looked back. I still keep a couple 4 TG on me in case I need a heavy dose.
---
I bought the one month just to get the outfit and see what the private servers were about. Had the ranger outfit been in the atom shop most of you would have bought it so what’s the difference? 
---
If you don’t like the subscription service, which I actually don’t care for either to be honest, don’t buy it. The games fun but I’ve been playing since the beta and now I’m just bored. Not angry, not boycotting, just bored. Time to move on till wastelanders. 
---
Everyone is getting so worked up about it but in the end it’s a game. Punishing people who spent the money isn’t right either. But that’s the world we live in today. If you don’t agree with someone just torment them till they give in.
---
Anybody still playing that ALSO hates on f1st players are filthy hypocrites though
---
Hold the fuck on, Buddy.   
---
I never said jack diddly about 76 running in the negatives currently, I'm saying that if it were to run in the negatives, it'd be shut down. And folks like the OP are paying to keep it up, essentially.   
---
I think the new service is a fucking disaster, but I don't go around trying to start fights on reddit by baselessly calling randos shills because 'Holy fuck he doesn't lick the nuts of youtube 'journalists' who think everyone who purchases Fallout 1st is a Son of Satan'.  
---
So stop assuming I'm not in the same boat and trying to draw imaginary lines. Nobody is fucking pleased with this mess. Some people are willing to look at it without 'Gamer Rage' though.
---
Just call me Gepetto, little Pinocchio.
---
That doesn’t make sense in the scenario where the bomb was dropped after he started the server
---
I find myself lingering there much longer than I need to because I think I want it as the soundtrack to my life.
---
Yep, not planning to.
---
Well after finding that out I’m not really concerned with F76 anymore. It’s a lost cause to me and people who play can do whatever they want and throw all the money they want at Bethesda. My concern now is will this modding philosophy carry over to Starfield and TES VI?
---
sometimes it makes you think, no wonder the governments of the world are pushing for everyone to be identical and "equal". look how well we handle out differences.
---
I was talking to the jason tool
---
He's paid to ***lie***. That's not something we should accept.
---
Yeahp. No coming back to adventure for them.
---
BIV is interesting... 
---
The fact is there are NPCs lol. Just not human npc. You can say you don’t like them, fine. But they are NPCs.
---
Using alt accounts, nice. Maybe remember to switch accounts before replying numb nuts
---
Bethesda hates everyone dude lmao
---
Exactly. If you hate the game, play something else.
---
Hopefully an even larger purge of a toxic fanbase.... based on this post, id say they missed a few...
---
Because it’s not an actual thing you are supposed to grind for...
---
Couldn’t you just use that method to infinitely farm the white spring, or any other area of the map, for 12.99 a month? I’m just waiting for the dudebros with 1 million 5.56 rounds to start crashing public servers.
---
I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just saying that added gear weight doesn't make the game more fun for me.
---
I got beaten up when I decided to do the Mothman emote in Vault 51. At least 5 - 7 people in teddy bear costumes kept punching me.
---
Dude... relax. You’re flipping out over nothing. Take a deep breath. It’s just a game.
---
Literally "laughed out loud"  Thanks for that! ;D After all the hate of fo76 as of late, it's refreshing to see the laughable side (without all the toxicity)
---
                              ☆♡☆♡☆♡☆♡☆
---
per unit,  so 1 star weapon equals 100 caps if its priced 20 per script and a 3 star would be 800.
---
What ‘poor choice’?
---
Just the Atoms alone is well worth the cost. 
---
$8.25 for twice that amount of value in Atoms?
---
Did you hate on people that bought Atoms prior to this?
---
Sorry not interested in role playing a mid level inventory  manager.  role playing should be a lil bit seamless, stopping everything to rearrange cards that should be in my role playing brain already isnt
---
Youtubers just look at this sub and throw b roll bugged game play in the background and shit on it to get views. Don’t take it so hard
---
Can anyone actually confirm this? I subbed for one month just to get the armor and transfer my junk to the stash.
---
I will not be resubscribing unless they add another cool armor set.
---
I had 6 RL friends subscribe. No one is griefing us in any way, shape, or form. Surprisingly, a lot of people are asking where/how we got the armor.
---
This is on PS4 BTW. I haven't been on the PC version ever since the aimbitches and hacks took over NW.
---
I hate capitalism. What’s more, I hate that Bethesda is displaying a similar type of capitalism to what the Fallout franchise explicitly derides.
---
Rarely.  But i have crashed. Annoying for sure. Never had to unplug though. Seems like a hardware issue at that point.
---
Fallout 76 ist also free online.
---
GTA deals only with in-game currency, that also can be bought. Have you seen the prices there? If you want 2 big things (that for example grants access to new missions or just a good vehicle) you have to invest real money. And I don't mean like 5€/month. Or you play 24/7.
---
It's a different system they use there, they don't use subscriptions but I remember I felt offended by their prices. It's worse than what Bethesda does imo
---
I mean I am hoping they do more than just expand on an existing character.
---
Why you hate the robot dance?  It's funny as hell when it works lmao
---
Whoa, is that your sibling?
---
Their defense is that you craft infinite bullets.
---
Gaming is a hobby
---
Oh no someone in business that mone of us personally know - said something &amp; something diffetent happened. This happens in the real world, things change.
---
Maybe you need to see more of it - bye
---
There are a couple of passageways that are obscured by vegetation.
---
They feel like Bethesda is taking advantage of the gullible, which they are. It makes them angry.
---
Not really, I still enjoy this game. I just think that paying 100 bucks a year for a private server is stupid and just enables Bethesda to keep doing ridiculous cash grabs like fo1st in the future.
---
Its moreso just a giant "I make bad purchase choices" then anything
---
Alt account?  What are you blathering about?
---
“They should be thankful, you’re paying for their experience” 
---
Your original post is entirely false is the point, we all paid for the our own experience and were promised free dlc no strings attached. Because of Bethesda’s poor management of the atomic shop and bad release this game made a lot less money than it should’ve but with over a million people playing a conservative estimate is ~70million thru sales and MTX. 
---
Cost of running the servers is ~5$million for 2 years, cost of making the game is maybe $20million, $10million in marketing give or take.. they’ve already made more than enough profit and the micro transactions keep the servers running and engineers paid.. this is all about greed.
---
So don’t give me some BS about other people paying for my experience, I paid full price and was promised purely cosmetic MTX and free DLC. Instead they paywall this shit and you’re actively encouraging the people who feed this greedy cycle, so yeah keep drinking the kool aid buddy.
---
You're not entirely wrong, but you can game the systems to lvl your stats and skills to be top dog in most of the factions on Morrowind to, but it took serious effort, and some faction quests could have you kill quest givers from other factions for example.
---
What is flipping out? Because I posted some comments that took me 10 minutes total? I’d believe the guy who is initiating the responding and downvoting is mostly a hypocrite for telling someone else to stop investing so much into it. 
---
Let’s be honest here, this is just a result of you having no real defense against this yet for some psychologically irrelevant reason you’re against anyone who has an invested interest in holding greedy feet to the fire. It’s so weird that people are so against others being against such blatantly ridiculous anti-consumer practices. Lol.
---
Games been a hot mess with brief periods of semi okness, not a huge disservice to the game.
---
Stealing footage is not OK and I'd definitely like to see someone whos played for the whole thing report on it. If only because thier critism would be even more damming
---
Again. Why does that matter? Its a co-operative game.
---
I witnessed it a few hours ago on xbox and that's why I posted it.
---
It all depends on if the games are always online or not.
---
see works even when it's not in game
---
That's reasonable, there is always a chance they will make the game both successful and accommodating but each business motivation they implement seems to do neither .  For instance battle royale: they add it to the game, but it really should have been F2P and not linked at all to 76 in the way that if you already have a built character you get an advantage in the BR via cards. They would have made money on their ridiculously overpriced cosmetics with a free to play br, but it just wasn't enough. They wanted to trap people in the 60$ purchase. 
---
They package this as "Goodwill" when it's actually greedy business and they get called out for it. (Here's your ranger armor, or here's your repair kit, or here's your private server) but then it's always behind a paywall, it's always not in good faith and it's always got some twist to it.  For instance the private server isn't any thing but a private instance and is not at all what people were actually asking for but Bethesda wraps it up saying "We heard you asking for this since day one and thank your lucky stars we did it for you!" But it's not at all what people wanted.
---
Maybe they get flak because they deserve it is all I'm saying. Fallout the concept is great. Fallout the business is a heap. And Fallout 76 took many avenues to be worse then the models games 10-20 years ago were running.
---
Thats my point to you. Move on if you don't like it.
---
I've read every single patch note since launch. These changes would have been announced if they'd been implemented, and they haven't.
---
I also went ahead and read all of the data for Uranium Fever directly from the game files. The rewards are based on the **total amount of uranium extracted**. Here's [proof](https://i.imgur.com/SjH7NaA.png).   This is the **only** reward condition. There's nothing indicating that individual player performance is a factor (yet).
---
If the "Uranium Extracted" meter is above 25%, you get 250-300 XP, 20-40 caps, some ammo, some Aid items, and a chance for ***one*** of the following: a weapon, a piece of armor, or a plan.  If it's less than 25%, you get a smaller amount of XP (200) and caps (20), but ***zero chance*** for any ammo, aid, weapon, armor, or a plan.
---
If you didn't extract enough uranium, then the extractors were either initialized too late or not adequately repaired.
---
Some items are serialized and others aren't. Get 100 of the same clothing article and they won't stack. My stash has dozens and dozens (maybe hundreds) of weapons and clothing, and the interface lag to the point I have to wait a few seconds after scrolling for the screen to catch up. Otherwise I'll take the wrong item or it will be unresponsive.
---
Does the condition of your weapon determine the damage it does? I assume yes but the number never changes in my inventory.
---
I mean, if you wanna keep supporting bad buisness practices go ahead man
---
I can afford the console subscription, F1st, *and* my marijuana so I don't really mind so much
---
Oh great 1650 atoms. The isn't even enough to buy some of the overpriced power armor skins. Maybe I could buy some flooring?  Oh please, the Atomic Shop is a joke. Private servers are the exact same experience except you are alone, and other people aren't really a problem in this game mostly. Plus they currently aren't completely private. The scrapbox doesn't even work half of the time. The survival tent is worthless. Principle alone should stop you form purchasing it. They lied and said that the stash limit was limited due to performance issues, when in reality it was so they could monetize it.
---
They lied when they said everything would be free. They said this stuff would be free and it wasn't. That's what lying is. How can you defend a company lying to you?
---
Wastelanders isn't a DLC, it's another update. Unless they go back on something else they said, they won't be doing any DLCs, just updates.
---
Update = everyone has to install it, everyone plays same version of the game.
---
DLC = optional add on, allows the people who install it to play extra content
---
Second the thoughts! Just deinstalled as well and will never come back to this kind of company. 
---
Shame on you Bethesda!
---
I'm pretty sure I've encountered one a few downloads that added content.... have you been playing since launch?
---
Writing multiple paragraphs filled with obscenities is flipping out. Have a good day. Thanks for keeping it civil.
---
i guess bud i enjoy this game and only one person at their company ever said this stuff was gonna be free , and he's a PR guy he doesnt make choices so I knew better then believe him.
---
"Not teasing games years before they launch"
---
And yet https://youtu.be/BCNkwkXHCpI
---
E3 2018
---
When did i say you couldn't? Haha wtf
---
Me personally I could but won't.
---
So hardcore.  They're so pissed off that they KEEP PLAYING the game made by the company they hate and think they're doing something righteous and sending a message.  
---
There are a lot of fucking morons in this community, apparently.  And if you think it's not the people playing a game that they hate made by a company they hate, you just might be one of them.
---
There’s assholes on both sides of this issue. It happens.
---
They are still subject to loss from “defend” events with world critters.
---
Weird. We haven't been bothered by anyone so far, and spend a lot of time in game. The ranger costume is bringing back NV feels, so we are on more often than usual.
---
You dont protest a game by playing it. That's like protesting guns while shooting one.
---
Yeah of course. You're actively promoting shitty business practices and encouraging companies to use you as a cash cow
---
Kill them all, fuck their camps up, keep em in their private servers.
---
My comment is relevant &amp; may be diffetent to some as I am looking at this as an adult.
---
K bye.
---
It's not about keeping above the red line.   
---
More money? More return on investment.   
---
I'm not encouraging people to buy Fallout 1st in the fucking slightest, I'm encouraging other people to not be fucking idiots and try to start fights with someone because they chose to spend their money a certain way. 
---
And frankly, I don't care. The OP was meant to be a joke.
---
They put up a hotfix yesterday, haven't lost anything in the scrapbox myself either.
---
I hope not.
---
There is no forgiveness in this world. You are being punished for your crimes against humanity.
---
It's so funny......remember when...."why don't you goto survival to pvp" was a thing?  Then "why don't you pvp on nuclear winter"  now its.... 
---
why dont you play on your private server!!!
---
The tables have turned foodbuilds you come to the "griefers" to play the game you can't complain now you made that choice.  
---
 Its fun right having a vendor to sell stuff and locking all your customers out of the server lol
---
Targets get shot... that's how it works the wasteland is a cruel place as the Tod intended.... "everything is going as the Tod had foreseen"
---
Muhahahahahaha
---
Agree
---
That's the world. If they don't deliver cash gaining strategies to the investors/stockholders/owners it will be shut down.
---
And they didn't take anything from us with 1st, they just offer new stuff.
---
As an option, you could boycott them by not buying anything from them and stop playing it. 
---
What's going on in this sub atm is just disgusting circle jerk snivelling.
---
Best feature yet.  I had to manually uninstall mine.
---
It’s weird to see other gamers jumping on the ‘gaming is bad’ bandwagon because they don’t like another gamer’s choices...
---
I'm referencing the fact that people said Skyrim looked terrible at launch and, yet, couldn't stop playing it.
---
Definitely, but she was one of the more interesting characters and I’m also curious on how they will expand on the enclave
---
Oh Jesus obscenities. I’m so sorry you had to be subjected to obscenities over Reddit. Take me out in hand cuffs boys. Why is it that everyone who doesn’t have an argument ultimately points towards “obscenities” as some vague obfuscation? Like you need to pearl clutch when you got nothing lol
---
Lmao that's funny. I have wondered the same thing a few times.
---
If you have to beg people to boycott I think you know you're in the minority
---
Need a lot more weapon skins.
---
That's the thing though. If you load an instance of a new server it should be clear. It shouldn't be loading those scripts at all. 
---
Unless it's a crappy image of a public server after those events were triggered. But then everyone should be reporting that same issue.
---
My favorite thing was most definitely when I bought a scrapbox and then lost all of my scrap.
---
Oh! Okay, that makes sense. I charge per set of 3 or 5. Your way is much less complicated lol
---
&gt; Just the Atoms alone is well worth the cost. $8.25 for twice that amount of value in Atoms? 
---
I'm not coming after you for buying the sub, but you do realize the problems with this statement right?  The Atom Shop is grossly overpriced--Bethesda has just arbitrarily said how much they think Atoms are worth.  Evaluating the value of Atoms based on what Bethesda says is a complete trap, one that's used incessantly in mobile games to sucker players into doing value calculations internally within the game rather than externally to what the things are actually worth.  "Oh, a higher rarity skin normally costs $200 but it's on sale for $100 now--that's really good value and well worth the cost!"  It's a scam, and a pretty unethical one at that.  That's how they get you.
---
My tinfoil hat theory:
---
In the beginning, the youtube haters were paid shills. Paid by Rockstar (RDR2 came out around the same time, many tubers told folks to play that instead).
---
But then the bugs got worse, went un-fixed, and no substantial new content was released, as promised. So its kind of grown further into the bullshit persona that was made for it, in the last year. Probably because BGS/ Zenimax considered it a loss from day one of press coverage, and decided to divert resources to other projects.
---
Ou 10k god damn. You ever spent any? I'm on around 3k after getting the Halloween stuff.
---
Because that power armour skin shouts “ democracy is nonnegotiable” and other memorable one liners. But you got me on the flooring. My favourite is the blue and yellow tiles which was a freebie, but I had to get the magenta wallpaper to go with the tiled flooring.
---
"Only once was a camp so vile that we picked the locks, turned pacifist off and hunted down the owner (that was fun)"
---
As a person who spends most of time in game building camps or looking at others camps, that statement was hilarious. I've seen some hideous camps that I just wanted to burn to the ground, and on the other end of the spectrum I've seen some amazing camp's that I wish I could have left the owner feedback on.
---
I have to disagree, the scrap weight hinders a large part of the traditional Fallout gameplay mechanic and fun. I understand the need for that structure in mmo/rpgs; but, these games are faaaaar more enjoyable when stash space isn't such a problem.
---
Pinocchio can’t help himself...
---
;; I'm so sorry. That sounds rough... Glad I didn't go full into that. I'm waiting until they get the bugs out first.
---
And it’s hilarious. 
---
Hell, I might actually buy a month of this just out of spite, lol.
---
I love the map. And the haunted campground. Stuff like that. Stuff where you can see that SOMEONE actually cared.
---
I’d do it in NCR armor for the irony
---
We shouldn’t be relying on constant hot-fixes a year out from release. Same with every big update. I guess we’ve just gotten used to eating crap, so now the crap tastes good 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah hope so! Maybe they’ll go broke and all their staff will lose their jobs! Just before Christmas! Hahaha classic!
---
Then maybe EA will buy the franchise and show us how the atomic shop is supposed to run! 
---
If they do, I hope they take down all the items from the atomic shop listings and just have 3 loot boxes, then thing you buy is randomly generated. That’d be awesome!!
---
Yo dude I will play with you. 
---
I can help you.
---
Bye ✌️😂
---
Ultimately, I think it boils down to the scripts weren’t designed to handle people being alone on the server when the bombs drop
---
GTA has on of the worst microtransaction systems ever and a literal casino.
---
Sorry, i play what i want
---
Well I called you out on it because it wasn’t funny, I’m just sick of these gaming companies doing this shit left and right and people bend over and take it. I have the disposable income to buy it but it’s the principle of the matter. 
---
You’re right I was a dick, but the passivity I’m seeing is so frustrating it’s hard to keep a level head when talking about these malpractices and I don’t appreciate being promised one thing and delivered another and then made to feel like another quota. Anyone who buys this either doesn’t understand these things or doesn’t care, and I’m not sure which is worse.
---
Just the usual hate train after BGS says or does anything.  Some of its deserved.  
---
Most of it is stupid.
---
Wtf is wrong with your brain?
---
You must one of the kids who’s mommy bought them the game.
---
There's a bit more to it than that but that's pretty much it. like I said, fractionally simpler to manage elemental junk over bulk.
---
And they're right.
---
Yeah a am not happy with this because of the history of F76, but wow is not much different. you can say uninstall it but that won't change anything because some people enjoy game with all good and bad things. Yeah if everyone uninstall it and they have 0 players that could change something, but enough people enjoy game to continue playing it and if they want they will get fallout 1. If they enjoy it let them do so. Crying about this won't change anything. I am sorry that you don't enjoy game any more, but 5here are Soo many games and you will find other one that is perfect for you.
---
1650 for $8.  
---
Edit: If you were just buying atoms 1000 would cost you $9.99 or you could get 2000 for 19.99; that's my point.
---
They didn't say everything would be free. You misunderstood. Reread the link you posted.
---
Well said. Assholes gonna act like assholes regardless of their opinions
---
It's very strange indeed.... not sure why I'd get a down vote because gaming is a hobby and one I enjoy.  I can feel the sadness coming for me......muhahahaha
---
Outer Worlds will need more content soon via DLC and If the game is as good as the reviews say, I'll have zero problem buying the DLC or season passes like I did for FO4.  If the weapon modding can equal or replace the legendary FO76 system then that's an instant win for Outer Worlds and a loss for FO76.
---
Art and entertainment can and have existed outside of capitalism and will long outlive capitalism. If that’s the world that art exists in now that’s a problem because art that’s designed solely for profit will inherently lose value over time. 
---
They took modding away; modding will only be possible on private servers which to control you will have to pay. The literally took free and open modding. They also proved that unlimited stashes were in fact possible; they just wanted to make us pay for it. You got one new outfit for $15 a month.
---
Already done. Boycotting silently does no good without a collective voice addressing grievances.
---
Orrrrrrrr people are rightly upset over an exploitative business practice.
---
I got mine from Project Beanstalk.
---
I haven’t bought it yet. 
---
But how you spend your money is none of my business.
---
18 dollars is still insane. You can buy full games for that price. That's nearly about the price of the ultimate edition for New Vegas or Fallout 3. Maybe 5 bucks at the very most.
---
And you must be one of those whose mommy won't.
---
You are not trying to have a discussion. You are only trying to keep the bandwagon moving by adding your hate to it and trying to get others to bite. This title of your post has been reused so many times. Get over it and move on or pay for a month and you will forget about this whiney boycott.
---
Pics of your GT and you uninstalling or no one cares or believes you. Oh and, bye.
---
It's not P2W but a lie from Bethesda. They clearly stated that we couldn't get more stash space due technical limitations but the Scrap Box clearly proves that it was a lie.
---
I love that too! It's alot of fun exploring spooky places in the mire and ash heap.
---
Harassment good if u buy
---
thats fantastic. i'm also enjoying it quite a bit
---
Products only have the value that both buyer and seller agree upon.  That’s true in every transaction.
---
Honestly, if FO76 just allowed for modable multiplayer servers for free...100% forgiven and I'll buy the game.
---
I mean, I realize that. But I'm just telling you that your "check to see if your scrapbox is deleting stuff" comment wasn't needed because they did put out the patch already. And there's no reason to downvote a post that calls you out for needlessly spreading misinformation other than you being upset about being wrong. Goes against Reddiquette, as a matter of fact.
---
Capitalism speeds up growth but again that speed comes at the cost of the growth elsewhere.
---
If you want to attribute the corruption to the human condition then growth can be as well. We would grow and advance regardless without things being sped up, but everyone seems to think the world will just shut down if we aren't sucking resources like a mosquito.
---
Nature naturally heals itself but since the industrial revolution we are damaging the world more than it can heal itself. We have been around on this planet for an infinitesimally small amount of time, and under capitalism that amount of time is getting shorter and shorter all because we want designer clothing at cheaper prices.
---
You need to get out more then. Do something you like. Being negative all the time isn't good for your mental health. Maybe take up knitting.
---
It did in 3 and New Vegas. I don't *think* it does in 76. Don't quote me on that.
---
Wouldn't be the first time that Bethesda lied. A stash increase wasn't possible due technical limitations but the scrap box clearly proves that they lied.
---
&gt;It did in 3 and New Vegas. I don't *think* it does in 76. Don't quote me on that.
---
 \- _Joe_Momma_ 2019 
---
 You have been quoted on this post.
---
Your analogy doesnt work on a basic level lol
---
At first it kills the fan base, but then the exposure rebuilds and sustains it.
---
Other than a brief time where the server stability was bad (which has been fixed) the experience has been fine and no buggier than any other Bethesda game I’ve played that people always seem to forgive them for.
---
I’ll keep playing, thanks. There’s lots of stuff still to do in the game and I still like it
---
How many hours you put in to make you feel like you wasted $60.
---
I don't disagree with you at all. I too think that you should be able to make decisions as to what you should take and what you shouldn't but due to how storage is managed, it can get very annoying for those that like to hoard items like we've been trained to expect every since Bethesda RPGs pretty much existed.
---
Also, for some people the idea of micromanaging inventory space isn't interesting to them at all.
---
It's all about where you draw that line and for everyone, that line is different.
---
Am I constantly acting like a punk who's upset and feels the need to white knight a video game?
---
No that would be you.  In multiple threads. 
---
Dont worry everyone looks at you the same way they do 76.  A joke.
---
FUUUUUUUCK THAT. 
---
I spent the $13 for the 1650 atomic cash and the rangers outfit. I haven’t even fucked with the “private” server.. I could care less about playing alone. 
---
Anyone here acting up against other players because of whatever reason can go fuck themselves.
---
I said have a good day
---
What a boring aspect of gameplay, managing friggin scrap. I dont have a lot of time to game and having to spend an hour just to get screws just to repair a weapon is absolutely stupid and a huge reason I dont play thia trashfire anymore.
---
Now for the low price of $100/year.
---
What kind of argument is that  , do you even have the game ? Because the majority of people telling people to uninstall don’t even have the game and get their info from circle jerk youtubers.
---
Something something let me eat cake right?
---
I didnt mean you specifaclly, I met it collectively. Normally I'd agree but the truth is it effects us all in this scenario. The more people that buy this the more Bethesda realises they can get away with fucking over their customers
---
Do you think anyone from Bethesda tried to tell their corporate overlords that a Fallout like game from a former Fallout developer was dropping in 2 days?
---
One really has to wonder what was going through their heads. This is a PR disaster.... LOL
---
No it's isn't worth it. Game is a dumpster fire.
---
&gt; The horse is dead and has been for a while now
---
The game or the subreddit?
---
Lol. As predicted.
---
...btw it’s still free
---
It’s from fallout 3.  They already have it.  They just haven’t actually given it to us yet, because it’s farther down the “pay for advantage” line than they had so far gotten.  But now with this update, I assume we will get it soon.
---
I might give it a shot. 100$ a year is not a bad deal at all. I would spend it anyways on a monthly bill or Tobacco.
---
I've never lost anything, there was a bug, but they released a hotpatch for it.
---
Counterpoint: nah
---
😂
---
the subscription pays itself in atoms alone 
---
how is that a cash grab
---
Probably by ignoring it. It seems that fallout first has been a tremendous success for Bethesda despite the deluge of negative coverage because to be honest it’s a great deal if you plan to actually buy things from the atom shop! Because not only do you get a bunch of atoms cheaper that what it costs to buy them normally but you also save like 30% on bundles.
---
They said they would have cosmetic only microtransactions and that  all future content would be free. They broke that promise when repair kits came out. 1650 in the joke that is the Atomic Shop.
---
The many times peeps grouped up for some event.  Fashnat for its goofiness, the few times (for me) doing SBQ, meat week.  
---
Oh, and meeting Murgle for the first time.  And the time I was leveling a fresh out of the vault alt and this high-level dropped a ton on plans on me. It’s the unexpected little things.
---
Lastly, I’ve seen some cool camps, especially the one built with domes high up in the Savage Divide.  Camping in the clouds..... nice.
---
Well really it’s not $18 though, it’s more like $10.
---
&gt; on xbox
---
found your problem,console communities have always been sub par
---
ok, thats a fair opinion, but here is what i don't like doing once a week or whatever (i don't play very often): sitting down for 20 or 30 minutes and going through all my shit, putting on my excavator armor with expanded carry weight, taking on as much crap as i can carry, spending caps to fast travel to a vendor, and selling all of it. 
---
sure, i could pick through bodies and containers much more carefully and think about everything i pick up, but PA upgrades for different suits require a very wide variety of materials.
---
eventually i got bored of just killing scorchbeasts and upgrading PA so i stopped playing anyway
---
Enable a crack addict? What lol
---
Yea but the “non membership” servers still have the normal amount of players, but are worse than normal. That’s my point.  Private being flawless is one thing.  Non-private being worse than usual is another
---
David S Pumpkins?  Is he like a part of a local advertisement?
---
Apologies
---
The issue is Bethesda will continue to push things against public approval if they are given leeway. I was alright with everything in 76 and gave it the benefit of the doubt until they started the Fallout 1st shit, diverting resources into that while stalling Wastelanders.
---
You just shouldn’t do that to your fanbase that’s already shrinking. People can still like the game but at this point it’s more likely than not some video game Stockholm syndrome
---
😁👍
---
It would have felt fair.
---
That would be really unfair.
---
I GET cross play man. Still pointless in 76
---
I agree, now I can play with my son in our own little apocalyptic world - awesome
---
Needs money to stay afloat? Do you realise who this company is lol
---
I had to ask my son he said yes, if you do not have the pass it takes two seasons and once you do you will have enough to keep going if you play enough.
---
Dude.. I know this a weird statement considering it’s not gonna happen and it’s a super agro response.. but please say that to my face. I spent the 13 bones for the outfit and the 1650 atoms.. it was a good deal just for that. I say that so you know my mindset but I don’t even owe you that much. I’d love to see you fuck with me irl for spending my hard earned cash.
---
See ya, Buddy! We will be here regardless of how most talk about quitting.

---
P?!00
---
Yeah, let's just accept being robbed blind by Bethesda. You've convinced me, I'm gonna buy Fallout 1st. Fuck the consumer. All hail Todd Howard and ZeniMax. I should just give up and accept that game developers are allowed to lie all they want and still get morons to buy their trash.
---
Being a corporate sheep isn't good for you wallet.
---
Yes, that aspect is cool. But having to sort through the junk is not. It’s tedious, it’s boring, players feel overwhelmed and might even stop playing because they don’t want to play inventory simulator. There needs to be a medium.
---
Go on then, uninstall a game you already paid for, that'll show 'em.
---
Let us know, but most likely a different server.
---
that's how long the game is.
---
That won't change. Mby it will a little bit but not much. It sucks yes.
---
They'll keep making promises, die-hard fans will keep swallowing them, then Bethesda will break the promises (again), people will complain, then those same die-hard fans will complain about the complaining until it goes away because they have to feel like their payments to Bethesda were worth it. 
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Well my lack of concern for the game is literally minutes old as stated in the above comment so give me a sec gawd
---
I’m not sure they intentionally lied about this. Giving unlimited storage to a small subset of the player base is very different from giving unlimited storage to everyone.
---
Limiting it in some way is probably what makes it possible. Especially when those who are getting it are paying a fee that can directly pay for the increased storage needs.
---
More than likely they needed to add more server space to accomplish this, which probably didn’t make sense financially without a subscription fee to offset the costs.
---
No. I am happy with the game now. With Fallout 1st, it is exactly what I wanted.
---
ESO does it so much worse
---
&gt;Goes against reddiquette
---
Thats a joke right? Have you seen the other anti-first and bug annoyance posts? Go ahead and report me.

You should have been able to have that experience for free considering all of the online games that have free private multiplayer, creative, and even single player modes.
---
Make a video of you deleting your characters... then followed by uninstalling and clearing it all, then deleting your Bethesda account... 
---
We’ll wait... you won’t though not one person has... go figure... lol
---
I know there are power armor skins that are at least 1800 atoms  which equals 18 dollars.
---
          I would just like to say to all the ignorant emotional comments most of you are fools. Having a game company make the news regardless of the scandal is publicity that will draw extra attention. To the tear sacks that complain about fallout first sorry if you can’t handle their decision. If it is so bad and so poorly received why do I see so many people using it? 
---
          Sure you could argue some sort of Lemming approach but that’s just inaccurate. It is a convenience that myself and many others could get behind. I mean more atoms than what we already pay for with all the exclusive content and the convenience box well sweet sweet icing. If you are part of a micro group that thinks your feeling about Fallout 76 mean anything or matter in any way or will make change you need to get the doctor to evaluate you mental instability. 
---
          In the grand scheme of things FO76 has been a success by player and financial measure. Hey also know that even if you are one of the ones that actually did uninstall the game you will be back to buy the next good release that Bethesda has. If you are one that has such moral constitution that you will never in any fashion support Bethesda again I tilt my head to you for your dedication.
---
And video of them deleting their characters and Bethesda account...lol
---
There’s definitely a following that’s picking up. People aren’t happy about things and it isn’t shameful to address that there is most definitely an issue regardless of how much entertainment the game is giving you. Bethesda is indeed using predatory tactics and business in an attempt to profit off the least effort possible. Why release a DLC right now when you can put the money into a subscriber package that will pull in funds. 
---
At this point, they’re pretty much just begging you to throw money into the pot and you get a complimentary sticker and keychain. School fundraisers make less and reward more.
---
Did you read that from someone else's post. We play because we like it. If you don't, then please do something else that makes you happy - try knitting. I believe it's addictive.

WoW and Eve set the standard and defined a genre since 2003 and it’s because is a sub.

If they just charged 60 bucks on the front with no sub and free free free they would have lasted 5 years at best.

It’s sad that you as a person will admit it sucks but we still bear through it like it’s no problem.

"High sodium consumption (&gt;2 grams/day, equivalent to 5 g salt/day) and insufficient potassium intake (less than 3.5 grams/day) contribute to high blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.
---
Most people consume too much salt—on average 9–12 grams per day, or around twice the recommended maximum level of intake.
---
Salt intake of less than 5 grams per day for adults helps to reduce blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart attack. The principal benefit of lowering salt intake is a corresponding reduction in high blood pressure."

Honestly have no clue on the trophies and for me in the us it was 13.90 a month but the 100 dollars deal break down to 8 a month.
---
All games have hot fixes man, you dont even know what you are complaining about anymore.
---
Different server, also if there is to much time (load time) between the switch you will lose the server.  If you got a buddy just bounce switching it it is what we used to do back in the day when everyone farmed whitespring.   
---
Mobs spawn based on a new player entering the zone to trigger.
---
I appreciate simmering things down - I wasn't being a class act there either.   
---
The long and short of it is - Concept vs execution and handling.   
---
The idea of paying 6-15 dollars a month for a private server is fine - Let's be clear, that's a normal going rate for this sort of thing. The problem occurs when these private worlds are implemented so poorly and sloppily that they can't justify even that -   
---
Which they are, honestly. Eight players is laughably little, lack of world persistence is a deal breaker and the fact that they can't run independently of a 1st member is really damn sloppy. On the plus side, I've heard they run well latency wise, but man - If they'd have just launched this thing with properly designed, independent servers - None of this would've happened.   
---
So aye, I agree it's a dubiously timed service with some shockingly bad marketing, released in a disgustingly bare bones state. To be fair though, I think there's /plenty/ of misinformation on both sides. People that are buying and people that are swearing up and down that they'll boycott Bethesda and never buy a single BGS product ever again.

You shouldn't get it anyways. I didn't actually buy it, but that has been happening to people.
---
My experience is so different. Everytime Ive done the emotes I get about half a dozen run up and do it back all at once. Hilarious!
---
its the skin, when apllyed it won't even apear in the trading menu, just take it backto standard  and oyu're good to go
---
Yes you are a bot, basically.
---
The people that are most upset don't even play the game though lol they're the sheep being herded by influencers
---
People just like to complain.
---
Come on dudes, that's not cool.
---
Feel free to think of them as idiots for supporting anti-consumer practices but bullying (let's be honest, that's what it is) isn't cool. 
---
They don't deserve it and you're not some crusader who is sticking it to these morons. You're just an arsehole. I truly hope that you get reported and reprimanded for this action.
---
they have the wow syndrome,shit on the game every day then grind the next patch on 10 characters
---
Just goes to show it was not the game, but the toxic cesspool community.  Good job everyone.
---
Low price? It should be free. Locking a feature that was going to be free behind a paywall is scummy and you supporting it means they will continue doing it. I wouldn't call 100 dollars a year a low price for essentially nothing.
---
I enjoyed the game for a while but giving the benefit of the doubt can only go so far. Expressing concerns and criticisms over the game is problematic and allows for discussion. I was addicted to this game for a while but it faded and it’s not that I “want more” or “want only the things I can imagine” but it’s more along the lines of just being fed up with all the repetitive marketing and challenging dedicated players by giving others an easy way to progress through the game.
---
It’s not only Fallout 76 obviously, and I’ve had discussions with others on whether paid subscriber services that reward others with things that put them above others, or buying tiers to battle passes, etc has negative reinforcing behavior and preys on the fact that 95% of working America is forced to pay into modern games to get just as ahead as others.
---
Nobody is telling you what to play. You might as well just start screaming that everybody isn’t your dad because it’s sort of a straw man and doesn’t make any conversation worth it, but I’m also guessing this pedantic remark here was meant to be the last word, right?
---
Yup, been like this for a long time.  It's just another way they make gaining atoms in-game difficult so I'm sure it's working as intended in their opinion.
---
Yep man I agree.
---
The only way to have an "offline" experience is by paying Bethesda a monthly subscription for a private server.
---
Fence Sitting 100
---
Money income is a lot lower tho :D
---
They wear it as a badge of honour. I just feel sad for them.
---
Private servers cost money. I am glad to pay it to avoid the low life pvp griefers.
---
There is many tweaks I would make to the game to make it fun. 
---
They are sitting on a goldmine and they seem to pull out coal. I guess it's cause they are always looking to make money and coal sells.  It's bad for the environment but what ever. 
---
Personally I'd love them to slap the 76 map onto and offline mode and sell that for 20$  update with patches and dlc.  Make the online F2P and just sell awesome skins. The BR was a great chance for them to sell creative skins if it were F2P. The BR should not have given advantages to higher level players.
---
Stash should have been delt with a long time ago.
---
C.A.M.P building should have less restrictions and the placement should be more competent.
---
Lag and glitches should have been ironed out. Instances eating your gear or workshops sucks.
---
NPCs optional
---
Moddable local servers or pay a reasonable amount for a provided server. Not connecting to the main online game. 
---
Factions build over time.
---
Events change the landscape.
---
World building took the extra two steps that make it not only feel lived in but actually rewards investigation. 
---
It feels like they looked at years of gaming industry goodness and the $$$ made them stupid , they'd have gotten a lot more money out of me and everyone else with a satisfactory product.
---
💩
---
That even english?
---
Yeah. Not that I don't want this to be different. I would be ok with this if they give few other things, like I said it's close to wow and in some way its ok, but to change feelings form start of the game it would help if there is more. But things wont change. Best way to change this is to stop playing it if it's not fun for you any more and found something other that you will have blast with and support that. You won't change f76 but you will give chance to something else. If you like shoot &amp; loot mby you will enjoy Warframe.
---
I can agree with that. You see it on Facebook all the time. I don’t think proper statistics can really be cultivated here because there’s a lot of hate and a lot of approval, depends on where you seek the information.
---
There *will* be less and less people who enjoy the game if they’re hard workers who don’t have time to play and are pushed toward a PTW style game.
---
Come on dude, don't support such a shitty anti-consumer practice, no matter how you pay for it.
---
What you trying to say?
---
What picture?
---
This
---
Nukes should be reserved for these people.
---
But some companies/industries are specialized in getting buyers to skew perceptions of value.  The mobile market is especially adept at this and many companies there have on-staff psychologists to make spending more alluring/addictive.  There're a host of named techniques (frustration marketing, anchoring, etc...) deployed to warp peoples' sense of value, some of which FO76 has engaged in and are outright illegal in physical stores.
---
There's no point in berating you for how you spend your money.  But just so you know, what you said about this being a good deal because Atom value?  That's falling for the trap 101.
---
Also, apply what you just said to cons and scams and I'm sure you can agree it's problematic:
---
&gt;Products only have the value that both buyer and seller agree upon. That’s true in every transaction.
---
One way It matters because in the trading community people will use ammo as currency.
---
It happen for me before, but i think its a bug that cause all ghouls to respawn too early. And then they die when the nuke goes off.
---
Good luck because Bethesda never fixes bugs in an acceptable time frame.
---
Except atoms have no value.  There is nothing keeping them to continue putting things in the shop not keeping the same prices now that they have a subscription model that locks people into their environment.
---
yeah they dont like competition at all...
---
Agreed. I think this post does a good job of explaining people’s outrage about it. I would’ve supported this game more monetarily had they lived up to any promises, but it seemed like they kept walking things back and not implementing anything worth paying for. 
---

Lock basic game mechanics behind a paywall.
---
It's for sale right now
---
Wastelanders won't save this game after the delay and the announcement of FO 1st
---
The drop rate for those rare outfits is very low, not sure of the numbers but honestly, it takes less time to use fallout 76 trading Reddit subs than trying to acquire it in the game. Rough value on PC when trading = around 20k caps (sometimes less, mostly more...)
---
This could work ... as satire.
---
I can definitely agree with this! Everybody pulling in to help each other. High camps are sweet too.
---
I take it you are okay with people going back on their word. You don't find to be a betrayal?
---
And that’s why you don’t need to buy it. OP sees value in the product and decided to buy it. That’s how capitalism works.
---
Make it weigh 0 when its in a storage create. If the player is walking around with 999999999 Lbs of lead they should feel it, but if they want to hoard it in their camp let it be.
---
&gt;They said one year after release they would think about adding crossplay
---
Did they? Do you have a source of them saying that?
---
All I've heard is that they're thinking of it as an option post-launch. Nothing about timeline.
---

The outer worlds is shit though. Imagine making 3 poor financial decisions in a row.

I cackled. Yeah, it is funny. But you may look up for it via Win/Mac OS search. Try "Fallout 76.exe" for a chance.
---
Dont forget though, its reddits responsibility to tell you how to spend your money.
---
They inadvertently created a knew game mode
---
You can give it as much backstory as you like- it still looks like an almost carbon copy of most camp builds.
---
It’s because their priorities have changed. They’ve been thinking other ways to make money out of their customers
---
Have faith, also... FO1st IS A FRICKIN' OPTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION MAN XD
---
I’ll be honest I build so much crap I never really had to manage my junk anyway. My problem was keeping stocked. 
---
I have a mild crafting obsession though 😅
---
We don't give a shit that you own 3 properties. Is this some weird way of dick stroking? Stay on topic about fallout 76. Already reported you to mods for nonstop off topic banter.
---
That's a good idea.

Then the problem is not junk weight, bit UX flow.

They just have to be one after another ime. Otherwise too much time is gone and the inventories for world spawn containers get wiped, which i assume is from it power cycling.

Nice lie Bethesda.
---
They shouldn't have said all content would be free then. Perhaps they should have just made am offline co-op mode. Tons of games have co op modes for free. Quit defending lies and scams.
---
I would pay money for that. Say another $13 a month what the hell at this rate
---
Outerworld’s gameplay is bad tho
---
I honestly don't think they lied about the inventory issue. It's been present in every version of the gamebryo engine. What they did was finally figure out how to patrially fix it, at least with generic items like scrap and likely for most ammo too (anything with durability to track would still cause issues). The scummy part is that instead of just rolling it out to everyone like they ought to they're sticking it behind a paywall.
---
I just saw that my post has been removed, but I can only see that when my cookies are cleared &amp; I'm logged out. I can't say I'm surprised in the slightest by scummy shadowbans (or would this be shadowdeletions?) from the FO76 community mods. Since they tried covering it up, I'll see if I can repost all the info publicly here instead (divided into multiple posts due to the length):
---
Yesterday wasn't "the day that Bethesda proved they're liars," nor was it "the day they crossed the line." It wasn't this year. It wasn't even last year. Bethesda's higher-ups have consistently lied for many years; it's only now, after literally more than 20 controversies in the span of &lt;1.5 years, that some of the diehard fanboys have started to notice. Here are some (not all - only some) of Todd Howard's, et al's lies:
---
"Fallout 76 will have 16 times the detail," "Yeah, I'm such a nerd, I was in the chess club" (In his defense he was in a \*lot\* of clubs according to his yearbook, but the chess club wasn't one of them.) Remember how he said Radiant AI was going to work in Oblivion &amp; revolutionize the entire world of gaming, yet it was a buggy, mere shadow of what was shown (and was likely scripted footage from the start, not actual gameplay) at the E3 leading up to Oblivion's release? The list goes on and on and on. Here, have dozens more lies:

Sorry!" which was a blatant lie that nobody with even half of a brain should have fallen for. \*It's a video game. Every single variable, without exception, can be modified as the developers who have access to the source code see fit.\* It's lines of code and GUIs, not magical runes that, once etched, can never be altered by mortal man. And now, Bethesda proved that they were lying about this, which, again, should have been obvious in the first place. They're now offering unlimited inventory space, but only if you pay for it. In other words, this basic feature is ransomware that's locked behind a paywall. They're not even taking one step forward and two steps back: for the past 1+ year, Bethesda has taken 20+ substantial steps back and no tangible, meaningful steps forward.

The decision to drastically dumb down each game more and more with each release really does seem to fall on his shoulders, by his own admission that he loved taking TES, one of the most ambitious series of the 90's and a world record holder for over 10 years for Daggerfall's insane, never-before-seen level of depth in a video game, and bastardizing it into a single player borderline linear game with almost no customization or anything special about it whatsoever.
---

Morrowind was 1 step forward, 2 steps back, unless you count a true, fully 3D world as being worthy of its own step forward for 2 total. Oblivion and Skyrim were both 1 step forward, 1 step back. This also goes over Emil Pagliarolo's disgusting "K.I.S.S." design /storytelling philosophy that mimics Todd Howard's gross oversimplification of the TES series. He was also the senior designer for Fallout 4's embarrassing dialogue system and sees nothing wrong with it. Soon afterward, it covers Todd's weird obsession with cutting as much major content from TES as possible, one of the biggest reasons people loved the games to begin with and why it held world records for game complexity/size before he joined Bethesda and started grossly oversimplifying everything

The fact that people still pre-order and buy games from Bethesda at all, let alone on day 1 even after all this, is proof of the monumental ignorance of people who blindly accept these anti-consumer practices and beg for more.

Bethesda's acted like heroes when they've been the bad guy for decades; look at them for what they really are.
---
I saw this train coming miles away. Do any of you remember Fallout Shelter? Long before that game's release Captain Sparkles was working on and about to release a mobile game he initially was calling Fallout Bunker (or something along those lines). Bethesda sent some pretty scary letters from their legal team stating that if Captain Sparkles didn't change the name of his game, that he was going to be sued in court. They strong armed an innocent man for no reason other than he used the word "fallout" in a title of his game. Dial the clock forward a year or two later and this thing called "creation club" is made. Where modders can submit a mod to the club and be paid a lump sum of cash for it, while Bethesda charges X amount of dollars PER DOWNLOAD.
---
They pay off the hard working guy with a small amount of pocket change compared to the MILLIONS of dollars they are making off that mod. Look I don't want to get into too much detail on their game's main engine because everyone already knows it's the same engine they've had since 2004's Morrowind that they just create more and more add-ons for with each video game they release. (Not just 'within a series,' no with EVERY game they release). But the lovely salty cherry on top is when they kept re releasing skyrim. And NOBODY called them out on it. We ALL saw this very obvious cashgrab. For me it was like watching your 5yo child reach their hand into the cookie jar after you told them not to 20 times already because they want to see if they can STILL get away with it. And now they have. To sum up ALL this garbage of a post I'm making, I want to leave this one last sentiment: We cannot hate Bethesda for being being who they are now. They are only the monster WE created with neglect and lack of accountability.

I'm doing my part and STOPPED financially supporting Bethesda. Are you?

---
\-Some people paid more than $200 for a nylon garbage bag and a plastic helmet worth $17 combined.
---
\-No refunds to downloaders of the game, and everybody has to download it...
---
\-Rum bottle is worth $20 even with the plastic housing, charged idiots $80 for it.
---
\-Microtransaction store offers literally nothing of value, but manages to overcharge even on sale.
---
To whomever bought this game, you got played by BGS big time. Yes, you are an idiot, and yes, your stupidity will help them do all of this again and worse next time with TES6, and again with Starfield. You are half the reason this all keeps going downhill with no end in sight.

Those who cross the picket line are scabs. You're foolish to have bought this. They just delayed Wastelanders to Q1 2020, probably to find a way to monetize it. I'd bet real money on that. I'm gonna watch the news, but unless it 180s, I'm out for good. Uninstalling when I get home today.

---
Screwup #2: Support kept giving people dismissive, mixed messages, such as "We ran out of materials, so we had to switch from one to the other." and "We never made any high quality bags to begin with; the marketing was wrong. Even though it says canvas, we meant nylon. We're not going to do anything about it."
---
Screwup #3: As "recompense" for their &gt;$50 mistake, they're offering affected players a meager \~$5 worth of microtransaction currency to make people more addicted to their cash shop instead of genuinely trying to fix/address the problem; their response to their screwup is to act even more parasitic and scummy.
---
Screwup #4: The insultingly pathetic amount of MTX currency given isn't even enough to buy a virtual version of the canvas bag in-game. Bethesda just poured even more fuel on the fire with this move. They're trying hard to become the next EA.
---
SCREWUP #5; IT JUST KEEPS GOING: Betheseda not only already made high quality canvas bags, THEY GAVE THEM OUT FOR FREE, AT MULTIPLE EVENTS TO SELECT REVIEWERS WHO ARE KNOWN FOR BLINDLY GIVING THEM ARTIFICIALLY HIGH RATINGS.
---
SCREWUP #6; YES, IT SERIOUSLY KEEPS GOING: DESPITE ADMITTING FAULT, THEY'RE REFUSING TO REFUND THE CUSTOMERS THEY LIED TO. They have zero intentions of doing the right thing. / Edit about a week later: they changed their minds only due to the EXTREME backlash they received. It tells you everything you need to know about Bugthesda that it took OVERWHELMING backlash from millions upon millions of people for them to RELUCTANTLY undo their lies, dragging their feet the whole way.
---
I wear it cause I genuinely like it from new vegas
---
Are people actually planning to subscribe? For the love of god, please don't encourage this bullshit.
---
Not true about the PvE. I use it for events like Uranium Feaver so I can find the legendaries, get my hits in, and not have a one shot chump say: "aww, sorry. Geuss I'm just too cool".
---
And yet, about 15 hours is how long my "Rush through everything" play too.
---
So you are saying If I do the same thing, but stop to take time and "smell the flowers" then I would still only take 15 hours?
---
The friends I've made. There the absolute best people I've met. 
---
Also fasnacht donuts don't spoil so now I run round in Slocum's Joe power armour for cooking oil giving away free donuts to people.
---
Can you cite the "promise" I mean where exactly did they say they promise. People say a lot of things and plans change in business.   
---
Did Hines break the trust of the community I would say no, everyone is hung up on a trade show statement and a tweet which were all before the game ever released.
---
The Bethesda hate train runs strong, and people who strongly identify as gamers instead of people who game tend to be toxic man-babies in general.
---
Worse than cod supply drops? I ask because I don’t play gta online.
---
Agreed, its mediocre compared to other weapons. Heck Ill drop one for a standard lever rifle or hunters rifle.
---
In fact i only really use them when i have nothing else
---
While I agree with the thought, “seasons” are bad ideas. I hate playing another game then coming back to a season based game only to realize that because I wasn’t playing 24/7 I missed out on content.
---
Might want to message them if you aren’t actually friends.
---
Anyone in your friends list can join your private server so they aren't really private. Always best to ask to person if possible.
---
All original content is still free. This a new option for avoiding the pvp/griefer jerks. Well worth the price to me. It got me and my friends playing again.

Really?  Ok. I never usually attend that one.
---
Just join them. Not your fault that your are still in their friend list.
---
Inexplicably, they’re equal parts lava and ice cube in the middle.
---
Multiple people completed the game with main quests and side quests and said it took around 15 hours.
---
It is not about the money. It is about the game being broken and Bethesda asking for more money without fixing it first.
---
I know wasteland is a ripoff, but also a reference to the ancestor of fallout, wasteland, a post-apocalyptic role-playing game launched by interplay on the early 80's, it was a success but fallout was better.
---
Also I'm pretty good at nuka taper, what's your higher score/level?

---
So, how did it go?  Got pics?
---
They deserve it. Their fault for wasting $100 on a broken subscription on a horribly executed game.
---
The new emotes are great
---
And if you don't you'll buy more?
---
"Low Cost"... You sound like a sales pitch.
---
"private" "servers"
---
179 for the year 23 per month for aus. Shithouse to say the least.
---
Imagine playing internet cop because somebody spent their money on something they want. It goes both ways.
---
The issue with code versioning isn't even really a project management issue. It would have been maybe before the 1990's or so but we've had systems that automatically manage that for us for decades. It really should be a non-issue in our day and age and yet here we are with Bethesda.
---
Otherwise a nice, comprehensive piece. Very much agree with most of what you've said. It bothers me that some portion of the community just don't get that this is the case.
---
How about a Fallout 1st flair?
---
You’re talking about the spec requirements for the client. The server doesn’t need to handle any video, audio, animations, etc. The server is mostly in charge of tracking who’s online, where everyone is, mob locations, things like that, and relaying them to other players. If we’re talking single digit simultaneous players, a server can usually run in worse specs than the client for a game like this.
---
All rise is a legendary unique supersledge
---
Don't give them ideas :P
---
Like I said in the description, I didn't go through with it.
---
Internet cop? I think you must have me confused with a moderator. Which I'm not.
---
&gt;Multiple people 
---
And yet Ive seen Multiple people say that there is around 25 to 40 hours of gameplay from their own experiences playing the game if you stop to do side quests.
---
Well I guess that's a matter of opinion. GTA isn't even free to play, you have to buy the game then everything in it is behind purchase, or unreasonable amount of hours grinding. And like I said, it has a literal casino
---
I really don’t think you guys get the  whale thing. This games chump change. People spend 1-30k+ a year on mobile games. Star citizen would be a whale hooking game. Bdo has people spending hundreds a month just to be on a competitive level. Fallout has people spending like 20-40. It’s crappy practice but man this is not even close to whale level. 10-15 bucks a month for a online gaming service is pretty much the flat standard since it’s start. While the value to any of them is of a personal view. Being pissed about the bait and switch is valid and completely rational. But making stuff up for the sake of flaming is getting old.
---
Really? You think thats worse than the endgame reward for the highest level of the raid crashing your game if used during the only other end game activity? Damn.
---
I 100% agree with you
---
Yes, they were asked on multiple occasions if they were going to integrate it. 
---
And pete said "if we were to do it we'd be looking at at least a year from now so november 2019 would at its earliest"
---
 just watch any question interview from a year ago, And then mostly surrounding E3
---
Why should I care? Even at half off everything in that shop is still overpriced.
---
If BGS made the UI navigation better, then I think many players probably wouldn't care all that much about managing weight. 
---
However, the UI is painfully inefficient in regards to a game flow. Should be able to just look at a tab in the inventory and be able to throw out exactly what was just picked up. As it stands, you go into your inventory, side scroll to the category tab in your inventory, then scroll down the list (usually in alphabetical order) to the item you think you just picked up, then you press the R button to drop said item, but then your mouse moves to highlight a different item and you end up dropping the item two rows above the item you actually wanted to drop without warning you (the prompt will say that you're dropping the item you wanted to drop, but the game actually ends up dropping the item your mouse was hovering over--known inventory bug they haven't fixed since launch).
---
Not to mention that every time you finish a quest or event, they load your inventory with junk and you don't always get the prompt saying what you got (another bug). So then you have to spend 5-10 minutes going through your inventory to guess what you got to throw it out.
---
BGS has to make the inventory system better in general; wanting infinite junk storage is only a half-measure at best even if it weren't behind a paywall.
---
I can relate to this so much.  There are so many sessions with my 1-3 IRL friends that play this game in which we get on for a few hour session and we end up playing for 20 minuted and then having an hour long conversation at someone’s CAMP
---
Maybe your mom will buy you a new game.
---
People would've lost it no matter what Beth did regarding this.
---
It would be "but you promised everything would be free!"
---
Everyone Im friends with doesnt mind when I join them. Most actually say come back anytime and take whatever I need. That being said dont just join and start taking factories. Just fast travel straight to them and wave. If you have a mic then just ask. They will probably let you know with a thumbs up or down if you are accepted or not. 
---
 I dont know if this is protocol or not. Its just how Ive done it when unsure.
---
Apart from bugs I mean.
---
Servers don’t run game engines; they sync raw state data between clients, which handle most of the heavy lifting for rendering and so forth. A Fallout 76 server wouldn’t be fundamentally much different from a Minecraft server. It’s actually probably lighter since you don’t have radical changes to the terrain to process.
---
Unlikely because from completing challenges etc. I should have MORE than enough to get what I want... if theres anything in there of interest of coarse. I do t just buy stuff to buy it.  And often I wait for it to come back at a sale price.
---
You can't silence people actively criticizing legit issues they have with this game. Do you know how ridiculous this sounds?
---
I wasn’t necessarily talking about you. This community used to be so good and now it’s going to shit.
---
It is worth it it to me to avoid the pvp kids and jerks. And yes, I am an adult with a job and $99 is pocket change to me. Well worth it to enjoy my gaming time with friends.
---
Thanks for being reasonable!
---
Sorta escalated towards the end there to some pretty OP shit. The subscription is perfect the way it is.  Let them focus on Wastelanders for the next few months and let us focus on the holidays.
---
Yea. But thats the risk you take, its like stocks in the stock market. But if Bethesda could regulate a stable economy this wouldnt be an issue, also people wouldnt be usuing ammo to circumvent caps limits because you could buy anything you want with them alone. In their defense, theres people who have 8 accounts selling stuff to vendors  making 30k a day.
---
A $100 usd will get you 8 million dollars in game. That's not  enough to fully mod 2 super or hyper cars as a lot of cars cost around 3-4mil. Clothing costs 30k to 60k. Like a single jacket costs that much.
---
Money talks man lol
---
Missed that.
---
Wore the armor and went around giving out ammo, stims, and purified water. Only had about three assholes try to give me trouble. They were all buddies who had a series of camps with what I would called overpriced goods. Course I think in that case it was because I went to their shops and didn't buy anything. One of them said I was acting like I was too good for their merch. Not too good, just too broke, especially after buying a max level executioner's explosive .50 cal hunting rifle to go with my ranger outfit.
---
*honor
---
its just a nature of servers the less load the more stable a server is.. :-p
---
Hey, look at that: a BGS Fallout game where your choices have actual consequences.
---
I'd hunt those idiots too
---
My man knows what's up 😎👉👉
---
Play a good Single player RPG Outer Worlds which is made by the same group who did New Vegas when FO was in it's prime
---
Ok. Right. Just don’t want to piss anybody off. :)
---
I actually think that should be an alternative.
---
Clearly a troll even though I hate the FO1 sell out.
---
Bethesda likes sheep too.
---
Give to me for free and I still won't wear that annoying power armor.
---
Well I mean the game is honestly going to shit too. I really enjoyed it when it first came out even with all the bugs, but Payed Private server subscriptions and no real new content, Wastlanders getting delayed. Idk if it weren't for the amazing scenery in this game, I would've canned it along time ago. Alot of the time it doesn't even feel like fallout.
---
\*honour.
---
You know there is a whole world outside of the US, right?
---
I really don't think you're understanding the whole whale thing. *I am a whale.* Last year alone I dropped 25k on various mobile games without issue *because they actually work.* Maybe had you *actually read what I posted* you'd see that I **didn't even bring up the sub.**
---
fine by me. i mostly play in private server solo mode  lol
---
still as others point out our enemy isnt each other its the devs im not buying it to pay to win . im buying it so i can have my own space without worrying about "online" lol
---
Cool. Thanks

---
Join. If they don't want you there they'll just kick you off their server.
---
While I like the idea that you're providing suggestions, fallout 1st perks shouldn't come at the cost of any base player's game experience.  I signed up and I very much enjoy it, but people are already angry enough at the subscription and taking away 25% of their profits is going to either drive up costs or make them not sell in the game at all.
---
You can't get a refund on PS4. *BUT* it doesn't auto-renew. So once the one month is done, it's done. You won't get charged $12 per month unless you decide to buy the 1-month subscription again
---
Not wishing it dead. Saying that's the next stage. 
---
Beth scared off more people with this mess. 
---
Doesnt bring in the revenue to keep things going and make the big company happy. Resources are pulled, number of servers reduced. Staff cuts. Fewer bug fixes. Slow death of online game until 1-2 years out when they shut down all servers.
---
You are still apartheid-ing your own community you dingus.
---
I agree it’s just sad to see our one thing (community) start to crumble too.
---
Even the new stuff hasn't been that great, or prices reasonably. The Liberty Prime power armor is exactly the kind of stuff I want to see in there but 1800 atoms is too high
---
Coming with the wastelanders update next year, for 9.99 a month you can get your scrap back.
---
Yeah, except I have to keep paying for a game I've bought over x3 due to Atoms.
---
This is a direct pay to win mechanic.
---
I uninstalled 2 days ago.
---
The shutdown timer is 20 minutes. As long as that private server is still active, you should load back into it when choosing private.
---
This is the equivalent of spitting on anyone with a store mount in WoW and I love it.
---
Ah. So they they have that capability? Didn’t know that. Thanks.
---
23 a month or 179 a year in Aus. Just glad I bought the game at half price lol
---
They deserve it. Really good to hear the community is ostracizing those who contribute to ruining it
---
I'd love a refund for it. Performance is still awful, but Bethesda support isn't replying. Any tips?
---
If they "block for session" you'll be booted from the server. Have already verified this works.
---
Figured I'd be out the $13 anyway which is fine. But that's good to know it doesn't auto-renew.
---
they need to let you swap skins off vending machines. I am too lazy to break down a vending machine and reprice everything. Plus since my house is always at cap im too afraid I’ll be over limit when I try to replace it.
---
It's tough, man. I can't play for more than 1 hour because it's so damn laggy that I have no interest in doing anything more than a run on WS to gather some legendaries because I know I will have a hard time dealing with the lag and stutters...
---
what does having self respect for myself and other people have to do with buing new games?
---
Yeah I feel like the community in fighting will die down soon. You've got people arguing from both sides, "your an idiot for buying into the cash grab" then you got people "hahaha you poor plebs are only mad about private servers because your mommy didn't raise your allowance hahah". It's like a battle of the superiority complexes lol. I'm guilty of it too.
---
You are treading on a thine line. As long as you are not reporting people that are bringing valid points and criticism about why they don't like what is going on... Pretty serious offense when you are trying to silence the majority for only one side of the coin.
---
Honetly is buying it for the unlimited scrap box it’s going to help me a lot for stash space I already spend about 20 a month in cult of the moth man things and skins
---
Interesting, when I server hopped the first day I was getting a new server every time as the plans would change I was farming for, maybe it was the same server but that is just how it works kinda like people resetting mobs?
---
Introduce BEffr handmades in the Atom shop
---
Yeah...it's not like he made those promises because they knew they were annoying people and later recinded on them.   If their word isn't even worth shit more then 4-5 months out then how can we trust them ever.
---
Nuka tapper is my best, I still need 3 games, but I also enjoy the games. When I'm in game and need a break from the grind I'll hang at my base playing these while people shop
---
Scrap Boxes should have been free for all. The Tent thing should be free for all. They should have boosted CAMP budgets for 1st members as the benefit instead.  The 1600 in ATOMS given to subscribers monthly can go directly into CAMP cosmetics which will be in greater demand because of the increased budget.  This does not affect gameplay significantly except maybe allowing you to make more water purifiers or crops to harvest.
---
Buying it just tells Bethesda they can get away with lying to everybody. We shouldn't be okay with companies lying to us. Purchasing it hurts everybody, so we should be angry that people are buying it.
---
yeah.....not like this just shows their word is shit, and they will lie to get idiots to beleive anything they say.
---
Imagine paying money to play a game you enjoy in the Hope's it supports the development team to make bigger better updates. Or we can complain about a game trying to fund itself. Both are equally valid options.
---
And here's all of that in picture form for convenience, just shy of 9k px in height: [https://i.imgur.com/My5i8Kd.png](https://i.imgur.com/My5i8Kd.png)
---
You'll get it soon friend. I got better at nuka tapper when I locked myself on a public bathroom on project paradise XD
---
Only toxic people are those buying this stuff and increasing the chance this cancer will go to other games.
---
And? How does that justify paying for it? This is what they want. They want to normalize paying for stuff like this so they can charge for it. By accepting it you will just encourage them to make you pay for more stuff.
---
P2W mechanics? In a multiplayer co-operative game? Thought that was only possible in competitive gaming... learning new things every day....
---
Unfortunately no.
---
Nintendo did it vice versa. Most of games costs more in Russia and much harder to get than in Europe or US. Some my friends have created SAR account to get online games cheaper.
---
As for Regional prices, atoms cost here almost twice less (249 roubles for 500 atoms, or 3.5€) making that fully priced fallout first membership even more ridiculous.
---
as I've been saying, the whole slippery slope argument doesn't work, when it's been proven time and time, when developers hear sliperry slope, they grab their toboggans
---
I wanted to get it for the atoms and then cancel, but I don’t want to contribute to the business practice. Hopefully things go back to normal soon.
---
But when you can pay to make the game less immersive, there will always be buyers.
---
So 3 super cars are about $100 in real life money? Wow
---
Didn’t think I needed “” here, but oh well.
---
well like most things, they arn't bad ideas, but they take them too far.
---
They need to bring out Stealthtats that put an red arrow on those using Stealthboys, and Berryboys that put an red arrow on those who just ate berry mentats, then the game will be perfectly balanced 👌
---
Same on PS4!
---
Only thing it would do is eject disk, I will update if it happens again
---
No? As the fallout new vegas sequel everyone wanted? Fallout 4 is the cheap fallout rip off.
---
not sure I get that one :&gt;
---
I just follow them around the worldand keep dancing around them until they block me or leave the server. If they block me I have a friend keep updating me on where they travel to. It's been working pretty good.
---
As they should
---
Feeling sad for group of people that bought into a greedy, anti-consumer practice is the equivalent as the practice of segregating and discriminating of a whole race just because of the colour of their skin?
---
Bitch please...
---
Also, don't forget Bethesda made artificial discounts. They said something was half off when it was actually the original price. The Atomic Shop is a scam too.
---
It’s amazing how they didn’t add that and the samurai to the bundle. It’s just constant blow after blow to the community. Here’s our new items you can buy 4-6 at a shot for 15 dollars and here’s the other 5-10 items pieced out. Just bundle it all for one premium price or allow people to buy it pieced out for a higher rate. Would sell so much more.  I mean putting some stuff In game every now and then would make more sense but this is the upside down. Really I like the music but it’s almost funny how it’s ominous and menacing with the service bundle dropping into the menu at the same time.
---
I'm sort of a hoarder in games, so for me mindlessly grabbing every junk in sight is fun and relaxing. I personally would enjoy having a scrap box for free so that I can hoard infinite crafting components. However, I agree that literally making junk weight 0 would be dumb; theres a point where it just breaks the game.
---
I'm playing right now and I have been for most of the day, there are a shitload...I mean asston of new people emerging from vault 76 today. Definitely from either bad press bringing 76 to gaming headlines, or something else? These features will make playing this game easier for first timers. I heard this one guy say he paid for 1st just for the ncr armor.
---
You have done nothing but post off topic on at least 20 of your posts. You also need to learn what a threat is because I already ACTED on my promise. ;)
---
Zero times one is still zero.
---
&gt;  It’s a shame the community is now divided because of these poor decisions by Bethesda
---
Saw the same thing with the "creation club" and paid mods. Really put people on either side of a line. 
---
I suspect the decision to be more with Zenimax than Bethesda though. I mean, Cal fucking Ripkin Jr is on the board of directors, I seriously doubt Zenimax gives a single hoot about online communities.

---
You really don’t have to bully people over a subscription service
---
That’s like bullying someone over subscribing to Xbox game pass
---
Makes swapping things between characters so much less sketchy as well.
---
I don’t currently play but One thing about this community is how much fun they have. Lmao I remember seeing the first responders that kinda became a thing and now this. Oh the way war changes people over time.
---
Do you have any 3* Lmgs or Gatling lasers by chance?
---
What evolution?
---
apparently scrap takes up almost no data space. It is items with unique ids like weapons, chems, bobble heads, etc that take up a lot of storage space. Keeping the junk counting towards stash space to add the resource balance would be fine. But creating a version of unlimited for someone people that work on an official server is BS.
---
I once got lucky and a random guy on the mine invited me and the other 2 players there to a team and we cleaned the place like maniacs, never got so much loot in a single place in this game like I got on this occasion. I think I unlocked at least 20 weapons' mods, mostly to the shotguns, and left there with more than 800 steel scraps by just scrapping the weapons I got from the mole miners. I wish more people would do that, but then I remember the griefers adding random people just to kill then and destroy their camps, and I understand why this isn't a common thing...
---
Let me bully you because you help pay the bills of the game I care enough about to get upset about.
---
And it is intact ultra hard to code on Bethesda's engines, but they're so fuckin' ambitious man, they wanted to push the barriers of their shitty technology. Why they just made 100 + stash I mean it will be worst but at least it will work since day one.
---
Remember that thing of items disappearing? That's because Bethesda's engine isn't capable of such a thing they needed more time to fix that.
---
Btw, unlimited !SCRAP! stash, maybe you know that but people is capable of misunderstand that. And also have an unlimited stash would make the game boring there's a posts that talks about it.
---
You are an enemy of the consumer. Are you happy?
---
It’s fun but it’s nothing outstanding, the maps feel super tiny, and yeah the loot is all pretty similar. Not a bad game so far but nothing groundbreaking.
---
No you can be shamed for being anti gaming and anti consumer.
---
Truth hurts, 10 people who read my post are in denial.
---
Speaking as someone who is not raging or writing death threats, but IS disappointed by this turn of events, I can say the issue is Bethesda's breach of faith with their fans/community. They made a lot of statements about things they 'wouldn't do' (e.g. only offer cosmetics via Atoms, no subscription services), and have reneged on those in favor of what seem like avaricious cash grabs. This is especially egregious given that a lot of the things that appear for sale in the Atom Shop (and the features of Fallout 1st) are things that the community has been asking for as part of the game. Slapping a price tag on that makes it seem that Bethesda only cares about taking people's money, not providing a positive user service. I have personally been a long time supporter of Bethesda, and defended them when I felt they received unjust criticism. But it feels as though they don't have any interest in returning the favor by supporting me, the player.
---
TL;DR I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
---
* Mod access in public lobbies.
---
Wh-  when it WORKS? Even that’s broken?
---
I don’t feel hurt by people buying it. Not everyone is as angry as you are. Some people don’t see it as a big deal. Don’t buy it if you feel so attacked. Clearly you are spending a lot of time on here being angry. I hope you find a way to feel better. It’s not healthy.
---
There are real injustices in the world. This is just a game.
---
God forbid you spend the money you worked for to have fun and enjoy yourself.
---
Oh yeah ive been to Italy, england and germany all very beautiful countries 👌
---
Yeah, but think, they paid for 1st lol who is really winning?
---
Were these your own nuke mines or theres?
---
How?
---
What's shameful is how Bethesda treats its fans and customers lmao. This is fantastic.
---
shitty people...   shitty people never change.
---
Yeah he's a hero.
---
Find yourself some WR armor and run/FT again. But don’t carry junks with you, you can lose them all from crash or garbage players
---
I have a better idea. Get rid of Fallout 1st and make the things already in it free.
---
Honour
---
Flavour
---
Colour
---
Just because you spell it incorrectly doesn't mean the rest of the world has to. :-)
---
I agree. Falls short to Fallout 4 for example in my opinion so far but a solid game though.
---
lol. I don't think he's attacking you, just that most people who bought the scrap bot wanted a pet insult bot and got it as a 'companion' cosmetic.  I leave mine unlocked and open to anyone who wants free junk (it's not that great, but not garbage either) as a community gesture.
---
Exactly. The pvp/griefers want targets. They are upset that we can avoid them now by paying a little money. Screw them.
---
Been playing pc games since doom and the whole "gamer" idea is still pretty fucking cringe inducing to me.
---
People are really still out here calling everything griefing...
---
I have a question. Do you not understand the difference between a post and a comment?   
---
From the sidebar:  All posts must be from, directly reference, or talk about something to do with Fallout 76.   
---
See the post is : 
---
# [Fallout 1st players are being targeted in adventure mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnidl0/fallout_1st_players_are_being_targeted_in/)
---
While what we are doing is commenting. The fact that you are now personally attacking me for your misunderstanding is clearly against the rules under number 4 and number 9.  
---
In fact in the rules is this:  No meme content as posts is allowed. This is not limited to image macros, it applies to popular trends of any kind. Comments are fine.    
---
Notice the last sentence. **Comments are fine.** Which means comments can go offtopic, thus I have been within the rules. You however are now witch hunting me.
---
I’m seeing this quite a bit...
---
Imagine actually caring about your fans
---
All dlc *has been* free.
---
Instead of claiming the other guy's argument is wrong so therefore it is - why don't you both post sources to your claims and debate from there?
---
It's called burden of proof. At least ztreak posted a link discussing total game sales in relation to Reddit thread views (which isn't entirely accurate. Current active players vs Reddit would be a bit more so.) You've posted literally nothing. 
---
Not saying either one of you are right or wrong mind you.
---
You're part of the problem. And people generally don't take it well when company's lie about their projects and walk back their words AFTER the products been bought.
---
Eat the rich.
---
That excuse isn’t real. It’s investors bullying these companies into squeezing as much money out of you as possible. Don’t be fooled, these devs don’t need that $13 to eat next month. No that shits going into investor and boss man pockets
---
We’ll probably give it another day or so, just so that everyone can scream themselves out, and then we’ll post a mega-thread on it. For now, please report off topic conversations, personal attacks, and posts that don’t add anything to the discussion.
---
I wouldn't care if I was the only person in the world that was angry. I'm not just gonna walk away and accept lies and the destruction of gaming and a franchise that I love.
---
That’s a bit hyperbolic.
---
Do you seriously want to get hype for something that probably won't come out for another 5 months, give or take?
---
It was so good for so long. Right up to NV. I know some people wanted multiplayer, but most players were perfectly happy going solo or maybe allowing co-op play.... So they respond with an empty MMO and screw over one of the best gaming franchises in existence. The fact that it sucks as well as being a blatant money grab just adds insult to injury.
---
There's games you can fuck up, but fucking up a series with so much goodwill behind it is just such a poor marketing move I can't get my head around it. Did they think that can loyalty means we would just be okay with all this? They should have realised that the backlash would be incredibly harsh after the responses to mass effect, star wars etc.
---
Thanks for being a huge part of the problem. What's it like being so against video games and so anti consumer? Why would someone willingly fuck themselves in the ass?
---
I don’t need to post anything because I am the don

Imagine screwing up an animation...... damn I'm done.
---
Oh my god, Chappy. Battery nation forever.
---
Hit a nigga up.
---
I have a real problem making this into a role playing game since there are no interesting characters or stories in it. Of course this may change with Wastelanders.
---
HEY....hey....they hate *everyone*.
---
You mean sheep*
---
And then they are called out on behaving irrationally and your karma gets brigaded.
---
Maybe if the suggestion is upvoted and has a lot of comments, it should be at least seen by Bethesda. Right?
---
You're right
---
Yes. Cosmetic only ones lmao
---
This game (outer world's) is like the easy slut you get with because your girlfriend (fallout) cheated on you. It's not really as good as what you're used too but it's better than being fucked over.
---
Then how you not know bout the u’s in foreign words
---
Embrace democracy, or you will be eradicated.... Democracy will never be defeated!
---
He should say nothing is free bitches! lol
---
It would be good if you could buy a mule from the Atom shop.
---
Good. People who dare to think that they can spend their own money on whatever they feel like spending it on get on my nerves.
---
Oh, I have an opinion on the topic. I’m just not going to be toxic about it.
---
Fortnite is definitely a more popular game but yeah they should have the pass for atoms
---
Thanks for sharing. Very balanced. Unfortunately this will likely get deleted as it’s not directly related to fo76
---
Targeting people because the have fallout 1st is definitely griefing. This is coming from a pvp advocate to.
---
Nah, just the same problem with any emote when loading into a server.
---
This would encourage brigading and vote manipulation
---
It's not about whether or not I want to buy it. EVERYONE needs to refrain from buying it. As many people as possible at least. The more people buy, the more likely Bethesda is to do it again. Which means I find it irresponsible to not discourage people from buying it.
---
That's not an option.
---
I uninstalled the game today... mainly to make room for call of duty.
---
imagine they get it in their heads to have DLC be subscription-based too?
---
"Why are players only paying for the DLC once, forever? Let's put each DLC at, oh, I don't know, $5/month..."
---
Bethesda is a perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect. They always think they're the smartest ones in the room. When they are, in fact, the most incompetent.
---
You just don't get it. You have attacked numerous other people who are trying to discuss this game with name calling, etc and have went off topic plenty of times. I won't repeat myself again. It's been cluttering this thread. Your posts have been drivel and not worthy of being in this thread.
---
I mean, yes lol. as I see it, it helps us to role play and increases  immersion
---
Its was 60 for the game 60 for one year of ps4 plus to be able to play the game and now 100, I wish I just spent money on more add-ons for fallout 4
---
Fallout 1st shouldn't even be a thing though. I wouldn't want it in the "cosmetics only" atom shop. They want people to pay for private servers, then fine. I can think of a ton of other multiplayer games that let you set up your own private lobby for free. Whatever. 
---
What REALLY pisses me off is that QoL changes that people have been begging for are locked behind this paid service. When are they going to start charging money for THOSE? Or for full-respec tokens? But yeah, sorry. I do disagree. This doesn't belong anywhere near the atom shop and I don't want to see any more non-cosmetics added to it.
---
The irrationality shown in expecting a game with continuous updates (Wastelanders was never even intended) to not ask for money at some point, let alone be completely optional?
---
Just this game?
---
While there's definitely a discussion to be had about the infinite scrap storage being behind a paywall, and while you're definitely correct about having a scrap storage limit is - or at least *was* - a big part of Fallout 76 (and, personally, helped me with my OCD need to clear each PoI to the last piece of scrap), whether or not having the ability to store infinite scrap is a good or a bad thing is *only* an opinion, and there is no right answer to it. Your opinion is that having limits was a positive thing, yet there have been countless threads since the game's launch complaining about the scrap limits.
---
People who don't like the ability to store infinite scrap can, of course, choose not to construct it in their C.A.M.P., and can choose not to use it when they use the tent, since the scrap box is a completely separate storage and not within the regular C.A.M.P. stash at all, although I know that self-imposed limitations can be harder to live with than actual game-mechanical ones, and I also know that some people are very concerned about what other players are, and are not able to do. But, it's still an option, if you're feeling sad about it.
---
What do you want to achieve with this post?
---
They also never planned for a free expansion like Wastelanders
---
Yeah it takes away the worst part.   Storage management isn’t appealing to me at all.
---
No sorry that's not how it works.
---
Servers maintain a game state so they can issue corrections, otherwise there's no correction against last and cheating.
---
I don’t live in a foreign country so I really dont care about it nor do I pay attention to it
---
Seriously it’s like two starbucks Fappuccino per month, i don’t understand what this whining is all about. You don’t need to get it if you don’t like it, it’s not like Bethesda is shutting down standard Adventure mode
---
I want to see more about wastelanders because I'm interested in. You're not friend, because I can take it none of us like fo1st but hey I leave you a quote here maybe it changes something if not well. Sorry
---
"Positive thoughts are the glasses that life gives to you"
---
Again can someone cite and show me this promise with the words promise? I have seen how they hyped the game but is private servers really DLC? I guess it can be construed as content but he said content first then more clarified how content was defined.    
---
English is a rough language, it is why people get away with so much.   
---
I found his quote-  “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs.   
---
I mean looking at that it was broken day one and content is even the cosmetics. It could be they are at the point of whatever it takes as he wants FO76 to stay online forever as that is another quote from him.   
---
Really what he said for content is things they view as DLC or season pass items. Now if they made DLC a sub thing then that would be a problem and a complete lie. But how it is phrased content implied only to season pass DLC.
---
Nothing
---
No, you just want everyone to see your opinion and agree with it. At least be honest with yourself.
---
Haha yeah, on the list of oppressed minorities “Fallout 1st Subscriber” ranks highest. Jesus, imagine if these nerds were this passionate about supporting something bigger than a piece of shit game made my scumbags
---
Actually even the regular adventure servers have been better since the update and the private servers we did 3 queen nukes on the same server last night with literally no lag and everyone I've talked has thought the server stability has gotten better
---
Hahahahah!! Wow you’re funny 😂....🙄
---
Ruining the game how?
---
Yeah, I havent had anything but opposite experiences.
---
K
---
I'm not sure how that would be a problem, if people all support an idea and it gets bethesdas attention then great. Just because it gets seen doesn't mean the idea will get implemented.
---
"The game still plays good" What game? If you love the game thats fine but don't pretend it's good or plays at all well lol. And complexity? The game has none? Bethesdas been stripping complexity out of their games more and more and people AREN'T happy about it.
---
Pete Hines is gonna go on another Twitter hiatus, I'm sure. Not that he's bothering to respond to anything now.
---
Yet you felt the need to correct someone’s spelling of it, curious!
---
Not really. The only reason games have started getting microtransactions and tons of DLC is because people have accepted those. If people accept scams like this it will become normal.  It will continue getting worse.
---
As they should lol. TOW is awesome.
---
Wastelanders. Freeeeeeeeee.
---
And a collection is cosmetic with a function already in the game.  It provides virtually no advantage.
---
Most likely Zenimax indeed. But still, it’s on both parties.
---
Nah this one is easily considered a dlc. You are getting a changed world as a result from killing the queen. This is no different from a wow expansion or guildwars. all the small 10minute -1 hour content was small filler that should have been there for end game content in the first place . Which still leaves it lackluster and generally boring after awhile. Was it worth stripping a beloved franchise for cash is yet to be seen. But considering the pst year so far I’d say no.
---
People are buying it, yes, not because of what it is, but because of the curiosity of it. That's never a good thing. Additionally, it's very likely the vast majority of buyers are actually reporters, YouTubers and independent bloggers who are solely buying it to find its flaws and use that to criticize (exploit?) an already problematic game "on their channel". Exactly how many more "I got ripped off by Bethesda" rants do we need to see about Fallout 76 by "journalist" vloggers? Just go search how many YouTubers have already posted rant videos. If you factor out the "journalist" buyers, you'll probably find very few legitimate buyers of this membership plan. No, Bethesda doesn't care from where the money comes. However, it's these "journalists" who are feeding Bethesda... and they need to stop doing that on these games to drive the point home and stop inflating sales numbers of bad products.
---
What? Is it also a day that ends in y
---
I see what you mean it has but it always seems to crash at the worst moments
---
That's not griefing as it's used in video games... That's literally just harrassment.
---
Not very successful and not very good in general yeah. Also Fo76 was marketed as being fully playable and enjoyable alone so yeah actually you can pretty easily compare them.
---
Well maybe they like the game but hate the company’s bad decisions? Not that I justify them harassing people but it’s not just black or white.
---
You are really overreacting. Take a step back and think about what you are complaining about and the number of times you jump in to tell people that you know better how they should spend their money. It’s a little over the top.
---
That's fair - although I believe that the intent was that, if everyone were roleplaying, we are all the npcs.     
---
Of course that was never going to work like that. 
---
Another reason that I'd like actual persistent, personal servers.
---
It's pretty likely they faked that crowd at E3. So this isn't impossible.
---
Thought you were in the US no need to get all worked up about it bud😂
---
Honestly, i agree. Let’s get them! True to Caesar!
---
That doesn't sound right. Can you post a screenshot of the gun? All weapon scale up with level.
---
Meh I've been looking forward to outer worlds for a long time, so not really
---
r/TheOuterWorlds
---
Except Fo76 is objectively not a good game. Just because you enjoy it doesn't stop it from being a bad game.
---
Uh-huh. Completely bethesdas fault. Not the players who are irrationally angry at others for spending money on a game.
---
This is the equivalent of people getting annoyed with map packs in cod and even then, they handle it better than you fucknuts have.
---
If the battle pass included solely cosmetics and could be unlocked with atoms, people would have no problem with it. If they released it along with Wastelanders, god, imagine. Probably would’ve brought everyone around like what happened with Red Dead
---
Yes however them buying subscription affects the future of the game for everyone. If that sub will be a success we can expect Bethesda to push more of this kind of BS not only for Fallout but all future releases. It came to F76 because it was successful in ESO (read, people are pretty much forced to pay it to have a decent experience).
---
When Funcom is making you look bad, you know you done fucked up.
---
Sure it’s their money and their opinion, but then again, it’s the opinion and the ability for everyone else to shit on them for being so oblivious, gullible, and supporting of such idiotic practices.
---
Sell the weapons. Can get a lot of caps just by looting everything off of mobs you kill.
---
Purified waters sell pretty well too.
---
r/juatifiedsuicide
---
I came here to comment exactly this.
---
They give us shit things then when we hate on them and get no reaktion we start to taget each other (those Who bought The things bethesda things)
---
But it's not optional. It's just going to be an update for everyone.
---
DLC has nothing to do with size. It's optional content. Updates are mandatory.
---
HAHA GET GRIEFED CAREBEar!!
---
You’re the one who got worked up, not me!
---
It was pretty generally the policy for even Howard to say the purchase were only going to be cosmetic.
---
The company lied, shit in your mouth, and you paid them for the pleasure.
---
I was targeted for having the LGBT flag icon. This community is so toxic.
---
I'm overreacting for trying to stop people from supporting lies? You don't need to be a genius to figure this out. If they know they can get money by lying they will continue to do it. So don't support them when they lie.
---
You have to build floating camps if you want to blueprint and move your camp.
---
Ideally they'd have kept to cosmetic items.
---
Ya I'm definitely not going to say u wont crash at all still and it does always happen at the worst times haha but I think people r just a little too caught up in the drama of the paid private servers that they arent seeing that we did actually get quite a bit fixed with this past update
---
The rise of Communism post the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 is just as evil as the Nazis really. The difference is it isn't taught as much and was dragged out over the 20th century as opposed to the sudden onset that is the rise of Nazi Germany. 
---
Communism likely killed over 100 million people in the 20th century with forced collectivization while generally dismissing human rights. It's yet another slippery slope of history really.
---
The Outer Worlds is actually a finished game tho
---
It is essentially BGS wants to establish a STEADY cash flow from the ATOM store.  I'm guessing it fluctuates wildly and they want to even out he troughs and spikes and make it more 'reliable' income stream.  For what amounts to buying $15 Atoms a month, you get 1st access with the extras.
---
It seems BGS didn't give the cosmetic thing a good run before putting 'convenience' items in the store.  The number of outfits available is poor - should be 10x more apparel options that are cool or themed for a faction.
---
Wearing the max cap backpack allows rads to build quicker, quick enough that I just build it natural. I never really need to add any rads after death as my rad level stays constant. But when I come out of nuke zone, which I use power armour  and aa weapons, I just eat loads of that irradiated meat which doesn't class as food so doesn't build health.
---
Alternatively just get hit by a ghoul or two.
---
Lmao players pushing a source of money going into the game away. Congrats morons, you're playing yourselves. When all those whales leaves you can kiss your servers goodbye.
---
&gt; I asked what you don’t like in he guiding principles and all you did was deflect. 
---
I saw no guiding principles in their message so I chose to ignore it. I am interested in conversation. Yes, I am actually upset. Your dismissiveness tells me that Bethesda could murder your parents in front of you for a laugh and you'd still jump to their defence.
---
Now that is the line, as it was said DLC would be free, and they would lose my trust and support. One of the biggest issues at hand is how his quote has been taken out of context.   
---
&gt; “There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs.   
---
Notice the pause in his quote. He defines content as DLC and season pass otherwise even cosmetics are content. No where else has it ever been said that things like 1st wouldn't happen.  After reading this and seeing another quote by him that he wants FO76 to last forever he could be on the what it takes part of his quote.   
---
The biggest part is he felt he had to define content since it is said twice in the quote everyone has been using as he made a bold statement of it was all free. It was a walk back even then.
---
That's bad beat memory. Poker players can rarly tell you about big wins or how it even happend... But they remember every moment of the time they played perfectly and a player drew out on them.
---
You are what is called a consumer whore and need to think about where your money is going just so you can be entertained.
---
“Thanks for the suggestion! We’ll pass it along to the marketing and financial departments so they can properly monetize *your* idea!”
---
This man is correct.
---
Damn your right I've been really pissed lately because of that stuff haven't seen the little bit of good stuff
---
I mean, that's hardly an unsolvable problem, just don't add assholes to your friends list.
---
Y'all need rust
---
The thing is, it's not just a "me want free" post. It's a "you literally promised this after paying you 60 bucks and you broke this promise". I mean did you miss the part where this is a full-price game or what?
---
there is also the whole nothing pay to win, which depends on your definition which can be a bit weasily, most see pay to win as effecting gameplay and such.  Some see it as literally pay to win, but for me and most it's anything that gives a advantage, like unlimited scrap in a game that can be a pain to keep up with all the scrap you find, or store food, as finding food enough to eat without it going bad was a pain and other such things.
---
And don't be a lawyer, you don't have to say, "I promise this." for it to be implied, just as you don't have to say, "If you don't do X I will kill you." if it's implied.
---
It's more of the mass effect or knights of the old republic style of map. Smaller maps with a hub. Instead of one map.
---
That’s my problem since day one. It never recognizes the file after opening the game each install. I have to manually delete the game and fresh install with each patch. That is with three cpu fresh installs and putting the game on two hard drives and a solid state. He better go searching for that root folder because I’d bet it’s in there.
---
You shouldn’t care for anything other than the fact everything is blighted by the free atom inflation. If only they would remove the free atoms, everything would be cheaper people would be happier.
---
I can fully understand wanting private servers to avoid griefers. And for that reason, I don't blame people for spending money on this.  I just think it should have been available at no extra charge.
---
Real talk, if you're sending death threats to a game dev, you absolutely deserve to be taken to court. People need to grow the f\*\*k up.
---
I haven’t done it but I believe you can do it on Xbox as they have refund policies. Otherwise, I wouldn’t try it.
---
I'm looking forward to the commie theme. Overall the stuff that's been datamined lately looks better than what they've had in the past IMO.
---
Caveat emptor.
---
I think at this point everyone buying into this can be blamed if even half this stuff makes it's way into elderscrolls 6, or starfield.   Frankly I have little hope for those games right now.
---
Just craft better weapons if events arent giving you leganderies
---
It's ten dollars. It's not a lot of money, unless you're a child
---
**Playing the game** says "I support Bethesda's bad decisions".
---
There's no difference between the two. If you're playing the game, you're supporting it.
---
I will post for you. I was asking a genuine question  u want to know specifically about their plan going forward you have a problem with. 
---
“We want to create an Atomic Shop experience where players feel good about spending their hard-earned Atoms. To make the system more fun and engaging for all players, we plan on reworking parts of the Challenge and reward system next year to be clearer, more fun, and more impactful for all types of players.
---
Of course, players can also buy Atoms, and we’re careful with everything we add to not upset the game’s balance. Our main objective is to avoid a situation where players can spend money to gain a competitive advantage or make the game worse for other players. Even more so, we want systems that allow players who do choose to buy Atoms to make the game better for others, not just themselves. With these principles in mind, we make careful decisions about the items we offer to keep it fair for everyone.”
---
Don’t be silly, there’s that new Easter pack!
---
The only way they would make FO 1st by use of atoms is by removing atom gain in game so they can make money to keep that game continue to be online. You all cant seem to comprehend that unless Bethesda can turn a profit the game cant opperate and will be scraped.
---
Yep. If people wouldn't buy it Bethesda wouldn't make it. Anyone who buys it is at fault. That doesn't make Bethesda any better though.
---
&gt;  Last year alone I dropped 25k on various mobile games
---
Honest question, do you feel good about that? Or is it like, a problem?
---
Take my upvote
---
Private servers cost Bethesda money. I understand why they have to charge extra for that.
---
I mean that’s just.....incorrect.
---
Yeah this is very fair. I personally like fallout more simply because it's rules lore and gameplay is more ironed out but outer world's is still good
---
Jesus you don't know much do you lmao every comment you make is countered with fact you didnt know and then you just spit out more BS lol
---
Yeah bro, it's not much better to your West.
---
It's a bad, bad figure and fucking laughable.
---
So to stick it to bethesda, people are punishing players for spending money keeping the game afloat? Ok. I'm sure thats making a good point
---
Yeah, sauce?
---
Salt
---
Would you like a medal?
---
Sure bud 😂 have a good one
---
A Teddy Bear raider group maybe?
---
See. No real argument.
---
Damnit, had my death threat already typed out /s
---
Um, considering the mods themselves have said to report posts that don’t add anything to the discussion...   which is literally like 90% of the posts the last few days...
---
There is no ‘thin line’ when it’s still up to the mods to decide what to leave or not.  If people report things that are borderline, at least they can be reviewed and decided on.
---
I see what you’re saying, but that’s exactly my point. Obsidian got to focus more on the branching quest lines, factions, side quests, and what not.
---
Bethesda did the same thing with fallout 4 as they did with 3 - massive engine improvements, MANY new mechanics (all new FPS mechanics, base building and the digital infrastructure therein, etc), new user interfaces, models, world, voiced player characters (no matter how debatable), and new side stories/main quest, and so on. Bethesda were making leaps, whereas obsidian only made a few modern bounds with their one entry in the franchise.
---
If a secondary studio made a fallout 5 with the same materials, it would certainly be more in depth. And don’t mention fallout 76 lol
---
good lord, why is it so hard to understand? it's right there for you to read. the other guy commented that there are hundreds of games available for a 20, and i've replied that while there certainly are, very few of them have the budget, pedigree, and following of fallout. it'd be like finding RDR2 for a 20 six months after launch - if you're at all interested in the dev or the franchise, you're going to check it out. i'm not confused about the discussion, i'm confused by how others are unable to follow it.

---
You'll find something else to cry about.
---
Actually no. The recon scope no longer works on players, nor does the sensor helmet.  It was in the patch notes.
---
To what end? Bethesdas not going to revert it because some players are lashing out at other players. All it does is make bethesda give even less of a shit about you because it shows you'll literally never be happy, and make the whales leave with their money. Well done, you played yourselves.
---
That's a terrible idea. That would just force you to pay for something that you could have got for free by playing the game. Another cash grab.
---
They have been, but they’re always weaker than this gun
---
I read about it the day it came out, and liked everything about it. Giving Bethesda 100 bucks to support the game for another year was an easy decision as I’ve had lots and lots of fun in Appalachia.
---
🤢🤮 The only people impressed by this style of pvp are immature children.
---
You fix it by canceling your subscription and realize you are killing the gaming industry.
---
Uhh your kidding right these are all things I’d want in the base game to enrich it
---
sorry but i think we got off the wrong foot do you think i attack bethesda or defending it or something because i feel a bit of hostillity
---
I personally disagree, and believe that it’s shameful. I think if it was priced lower people wouldn’t be *as* outraged. Most people just want the ability to host a private world on THEIR hardware for free, instead of paying more than the game cost at launch every single year. It offers very very little for the price, and they claimed that everything other than cosmetic atomic stuff would be free.
---
At this point it's been seen and acknowledged so it fits the criteria for things that have been put into the "retired posts" section. Its not censorship as much as it is the culling of spam.
---
!! C4R3B34R !!
---
Oh it was a serious problem. A two week phone detox and killing those games first thing and I was cured. I've since allowed myself 2 games, one I allow myself to spend and the other not even once.
---
Stop bringing outrr world here. The mods made a post about it.
---
We're talking about a game that was already selling power armour skin packs for more money than Far Harbour or Nuka World.        
---
Games like Ark have free private servers, and you can't tell me Zennimax can't do that. Hell, Bethesda can't even offer real private servers like friggen minecraft can... Once the owner logs out the 'server' shuts down... So this isn't even a real persistent private server like a minecraft realm. Its just a singleplayer mode others can join.
---
I wish i could see but my add blocker isnt having none of that lmao
---
Other games offer it for free.
---
Can confirm this dude games, very likely solely as a hobby. Saw him get chewed up in pvp on a youtube video the other day. Is this where I'm supposed to put the emojis?

In Fallout 3 (the only real Bethesda-made fallout game prior to 4) the only factions present were the Brotherhood and the Enclave, and story-wise it couldn't be more black and white. You will be part of the brotherhood and you will have to destroy the enclave. New Vegas's factions are quite... Different. In many ways. Their end is not set in stone and any of them can be destroyed, allied, or dealt with otherwise at the end of the game. I feel like Bethesda tried to replicate this with the 4 main factions in Fallout 4, adding a "best" ending with the alliance between the Railroad, Minute men and the brotherhood of steel. But they ended up making every faction bland. Ironically the most interesting one visually speaking is the one that is selfishly evil. The Railroad has been the most forgettable bunch of hypocrites (we'll save these robots, they're like humans and deserve to live! Even if we have to kill for it!). And the Brotherhood... Well... It turned into a bit of an oppressive militia rather than being the tech-savvy nerds they have been in previous games. I feel like they wanted unique new factions and a faction system, only to get confused by how to make it work in the story and they ended up scrapping the faction system. Nuka World is another great example of poor faction design.
---
Fair enough on the lawyer, thing.   
---
Okay on P2W:   
---
&gt; "Folks that want to spend money on whatever the hell it is because they don't have enough Atoms, they can, but it's not, 'I'm now better playing against other players because I spent money.' It's not pay-to-win. And it's not loot crates."   
---
Again Hines has a very defined approach to what bethesda considers P2W .  See so much is misunderstood or taken out of context thus causing the controversies we are seeing now.    
---
While you and I agree that the scrapbox is P2W or seriously skirting the line of it, it is not how bethesda sees P2W and at the end of the day they never lied of gave reason for mistrust as they laid it out, just to many people understood it different or remembered it different.
---
It’s not even just players without it though either
---
Thanks a million. A mega thread is definitely a better idea because then people wont be able to cry "censorship". I dont envy you guys having to deal with this.
---
Ah yes.  Well I've been too busy doing events and getting all the *** Legendary rewards to myself to worry about this.
---
For a level 5 laser rifle, 188 dmg is really good. For me the highest level laser rifle doesn’t even come close to that. If it’s working then keep using it till you find something better that you like.
---
Will if it has perks yeah lol
---
I could just play both.
---
The only paid shills are on Bethesda's side.
---
Damn wtf......hows the actual damage output on enemies?
---
Fallout 1st player here. Why might you ask?
---
Simple. I wanted the Halloween bundle and $13 for the subscription was the best deal to get for atoms. I think Bethesda have done nothing but lied their asses off since release, but if you're still playing the game *at all* you're supporting it.
---
If anyone wants to fuck with me for it I'll do the robot right in their fuggin' face.
---
I am and thanks :)
---
The issue isnt being able to afford it or not, the issue is paying for it enables these dumbass executives who thought of this idea to continue on.
---
I’ve been shutting my vendors and camp when ever I see one come bye give a little smack too
---
How can I turn atoms into real life money?
---
I have a lv100 commando built specifically for pvp. This isn’t pvp. This lacks skill and style. We are talking about fallout 76 here this isn’t rainbow six or counter strike. Calm down 😂
---
The people who are targeting Fallout 1st players are idiotic, we understand your anger and quite frankly as a subscription holder I’m angry as well,  we as a community do not need to have a divide, target  the higher ups at Zenimax/Bethesda as they made the decision.
---
Oh no! It was a funny video of fo4 just minden it's own business and then BAM! fo76 and then they catch on fire!
---
Its funnier in the video...lol.
---
The promised a product they failed to deliver as advertised.
---
Just hide from them, the game map is huge!
---
What kind of PR nightmare do you thing they would get in if they told a person”no that idea is stupid”. How will people react if others start brigading to put some ideas to the top and downvote others to get rid of their thoughts
---
What if the idea was just toxic. Why is 100 a good number, that’s a small portion of the overall sub base and even lower of the overall player base
---
It’s just a bad idea. They respond when they want to respond.  If you need a direct response open a ticket
---
And that justifies going after people who don't mind spending $13 to see what 1st is like?
---
8 USD a month is super cheap compared to other games price for private servers.
---
Saw someone displaying the Mr Fuzzy jumbo plushes.. they clipped out the sides and shit but still.. why can't I do this? Am I missing something?
---
Awesome, are you wanting to play on it? If so I'll switch to it.
---
Good. They should be embarrassed that they support greed and anti-consumer business practices.
---
I dont blame anyone for being mad Me personally I'm not I still love the game and have alot of good friends I've met playing it but not every game works out for everybody and I dont no y everyone has to hate on ur post always people just trying to make fun of people and their post on here
---
Pretty sure the subscription gives you more atoms than the bundles, which is pretty strange for a subscription service.
---
Eat the idiots who support dirty business practices.
---
It used to be so good
---
Anyone still playing the game giving a FO1st member shit is like a vegan wearing a leather jacket picking on someone for eating a cheeseburger.
---
The private worlds are way more relaxing for playing with friends, especially due to the increased stability
---
I dont mean this rude at all but wat do u mean Haha I'm sorry I can be kinda dense sometimes
---
So you know better than to trust a PR guy. But you still threw your money at them? Ok bud....ok
---
False dichotomy. They have many other ways to roll out something like this without violating their initial statements.
---
What faction and branching narrative? You mean Elder Scrolls? Because those factions have been pretty poorly implemented. Hell, Skyrim's civil war only got brought up twice during the story and it has almost no impact on the main story. If you mean Fallout 3, then you're making an even worse point. Because Fallout 3's story dictates that you WILL be allied to the Brotherhood of Steel, and you WILL be fighting the Enclave. That's not a branching narrative and that's not a real faction system. It's not like New Vegas and it's not like Fallout 4 either.
---
Yeah seems once youtubers started making critics the sub went on the defense as usual.
---
It’s good. I’m not complaining or anything, just thought it was odd
---
That's ok I'll just keep all my junk on my scrap storage while you guys waste your ammo because you think you have a say in how I spend $13
---
A lie by omission or implied intent is still a lie.  Thats the kind of EA double speak of, "We are not putting loot boxes in our games." then later, "Oh sorry we meant at start, but should have been implied we were adding them weeks later.
---
And your right he has a different definition, and the takeway is don't trust a single thing he says.
---
* Camps with no sealing
---
* Camps what only sell items and plans at base prices. 
---
* Shack cabins to only 2 x 2 panels in dimension that are literally crammed with all the work benches.
---
How much is your government taxing the service??? 
---
Looks like they are to sharing the blame...
---
I mean, most of the "value" they have in fallout first comes from the atoms you get with it. Wouldn't make much sense to cost atoms to get atoms.
---
They could have looked to other games in the genre for guidance on this, there are plenty of low-hanging-fruit ideas Bethesda could monetize like:
---
* extra stash space (the infinite is one thing, but just increasing it is comparable to most games. Use more server storage for money)
---
* dyes. I don't know why this isn't a thing, but being able to dye clothes/outfits/armour would be (relatively) easy to implement, easy to expand, and give lots of atom shop options
---
* temporary boosters. Like XP or I dunno, scrapping amounts.
---
* character slots. I'm not even sure if this is a thing already honestly, but if not it should be.
---
* unlocking some in-game content quickly. For example, plans being in the atom shop doesn't really give an advantage, since you can obtain them in game, and helps regulate the price of them (if it's in the atom shop for a fair price, say 50-100 atoms depending on the plan, then sellers would have to keep that in mind).
---
Keeping in mind all these things could just be in the atom shop for a relatively small price. Having a bunch of small impact items could help them appeal to a wider audience. It would also (if they were hellbent) enable them to shower subscribers with many of these small impact items.
---
What dlc may I ask?
---
I find it extremely presumptuous to tell people how they should spend their own money. You don't like it, we get it.
---
Shoot their cows and loot their crops and water.
---
It’s great! I actually prefer it to the regular music. Really gets me into the Halloween spirit.
---
There's a little 'quest' associated with this which they added that doesn't seem to be active yet, it's a teaser quest like they did with the Vault 51 stuff, and I reckon they will enble it when the Halloween event is over.
---
&gt;!The quest is 'Treasure Unknown' and has you collecting clues leading you to the Grafton Pawn Shop (an interior cell they added but currently not accessible) where you find map fragements. This leads you into the Vault 79 entrance area at the bottom of that elevator where you find the skeleton of the Pawn Shop owner who was on the treasure hunt. Turns out the 'treasure' is in Vault 79 but you can't get inside the actual door (yet). The 'treasure' is probably people as the Vault door is intentionally damaged.!&lt;
---
That's fine and all, but you'll have a hard time convincing anyone that doesn't use the atomic shop that it's a good deal. I've maybe bought 3 things on the atom shop and that was with atoms I earned in game. I don't support mtx for almost any game and I won't start giving them money today.
---
I’m not playing right now but I’ll def send you a request for later if that’s ok.
---
No such thing as a good community when the devs activly ruin the game and lie to the community. People will be angry, their anger will be misdirected at other players. And the circle goes on.
---
Nah its Bethesda's fault you moron, they release a broken ass game, do bare minimum, lie about their products and then try to charge a sub fee. You are delusional if you can't see the dirty business being done here.
---
Other games offer peer to peer for free. Name one that offers private servers for free.
---
Interesting that you've mentioned RDR2 as you can draw an almost direct comparison between the situations. I like Rockstar, but I wouldn't buy Red Dead Online for $20 after everything I know about it. I understand that, while it's true that it's an interesting franchise and made by Rockstar, it's shit even for $20 and I can have more fun with that money when I spend it on something else (I would of course buy RDR2 though, that's another situation entirely). I understand that you think differently, but it's also true that many people don't just buy games reported to be terrible / treating their players like money bags, just because it's part of a franchise... some do, but not all.
---
I agree that the devs are the enemy. But why play a MMO if you don’t like the “online” aspect?
---
Possibly. I think it might indicate that they are using version control, but they have no manager checking if everyone is using it properly. I think the bugs being re-introduced are a result of a branch being merged back into the development (or master?) branch while it has merge conflicts, and whoever caused it merely chose to keep their version, overriding prior bug fixes.
---
Sure
---
But it will continue to improve though, so I don't mind supporting the game. I viewed it as no different than buying an atom bundle. The bonuses aren't as p2w as others make them seem
---
True, I'm just tired of the defense of, "Don't hate those that buy hate X company." or, "If you don't like loot boxes, MTX, pay to win mechanics and such don't play the game."   because after this, and rage 2's MTX dlc *seriously who the FUCK thought making dlc buyable with mtx was a good idea*   that alone worries me.
---
Why not save it instead to buy a diamond pony?
---
LMFAOOOOOO
---
Bethesda hired thugs to make adventure inhospitable to sell more subscriptions...
---
yeah, probably when star field and elderscrolls 6 are shit thanks to idiots with more money then brains.
---
Sounds like some kinda 4chin term
---
I used a level 5 Somerset Special up until I was around level 40 or so. Never found a better pistol for damage output before then, since the anti-armor effect is so strong. Finally gave it up when I gave up on pistols entirely and switched to big guns. Just do what works.
---
I haven't heard of this one before so they may not even be aware of it.
---
If you haven't already, here's the link to submit an official bug report. :) I hope it's fixed soon.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
I don't care if you find it presumptuous. If someone is spending their money in a way which affects me negatively I have every right to by angry about it.
---
I say do it.  The other day I created a new character with Todd in the name, dressed as a clown, and ran around the with the clip of "It just works" on an endless loop playing into my mic.  Cathartic.
---
basicly subscribtion got released, people start to critizie bethesda
---
Critizing bethesda has no use they dont reply back, people start to critizie players who bought the subscription = we start to tear each other into a civil war = bethesda made this community attack each other you understand??
---
I see the picnic spot for a few seconds but then it vanishes
---
Scrapper will increase the mats yield; higher INT can improve chances to learn mods. 
---
Higher INT can also improve Durability value of crafted weps / armor, along with proper Perk card  selections.
---
Higher Luck can also improve Durability value of weps / armor loot.
---
Already gave you my arguments, you're just to delusional to understand them.
---
Btw how is your original post going? Still zero upvotes? Better call bethesda for help. Tell them you bought Fallout First. Maybe they'll give you a few atoms for you to spend on "cool emotes".
---
Exactly, the only reason they care so much is BECAUSE they love the company, and want to to reverse bad trends. 
---
It’s possible to love even Fallout 76 while knowing in your heart that it could have easily been so much better if it weren’t for Bethesda’s direction the last few years. The reason people fight against this so viciously is so that it stops, not so that the game is destroyed.
---
That's awsome! I will be sure to join in the fun!
---
Dude, I got ur point. But could u explain to me how in actual fuck Epic Games was able to make billions in 2018 from a freaking f2p? That shity game is no near fo76 in content richness even in its initial state...
---
FO76 should have been rocking if it wasn't for its bad management and perception.
---
K.
---
You are an absolute moron dude, no one here wants to hate Bethesda. We all loved this company at one point, we dropped hundred of hours into their games, and hundreds of dollars on collectors editions. We hate the bug filled games, the product lies, the delay of a huge content update so they could release a subscription service on a 60 DOLLAR GAME. How are you this daft kid? How can you not see the dirty business.
---
whats not to like, claim all the workshops and enjoy unlimited scrap
---
I'm fully with you there. I think most people make the argument because they really just want Bethesda to give the license to Obsidian. Fallout 1st is definitely the worst though. It's a move that would make EA executive wince at the sheer greedy audacity.
---
It's the devs fault for creative such a horrible system that put this divide between the players in the first place. 
---
Devs make bad designs. Players get angry, players cant direct their anger at devs, so they direct it at other players who show support to bad design. 
---
It can only be avoided by not making bad decisions. Normally I'd say making bad decisions is easy but not making them is hard, but Bethesda is kinda trying to prove me wrong.
---
That phrase is as old as capitalism itself. You need to get out more if you have never heard it.
---
No argument here, from a fellow Doom vet.
---
Thanks, I'll work on figuring out how to do that.
---
But it only affects you in your own mind. You're the one getting your panties in a wad over how random strangers on the internet are spending their money. Meanwhile, people around the world lack clean water, food, shelter.
---
I dont blame you for liking it. I do to alot of the time but the stuff there doing now is super scummy imo
---
It’s like the Soc’s vs. the greasers out here in the wasteland..
---
Ok. But while we're on the topic, have you heard it's fantastic?
---
I'm 35.  I have two jobs and a family.  The thought of spending my free time hate-playing a game for the sole reason of ruining other people's day is beyond me.  So blow me.  Kid.
---
Shoot me your player name I'll friend invite you!
---
You playing the game "enables" Bethesda to take part in these "egregiously vile" practices. If you want things to change, put it in their feedback reports (which they actually listen to unlike what people say) and play another game until you see a change
---
Then maybe don't equip it lmao
---
join mine too, add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Well first, i think you need to just calm yourself a little there chap. And I think it was pretty obvious that I was just kidding with that first sentence wasn't it?
---
Now I don't see what downvoting has to do with anything. I said how many comments it has, doesn't matter how many arseholes downvote something if the conversation is there. 
---
If the idea is toxic then the bethesda response would be a long the lines of 'no', or something. perhaps?
---
And ok, maybe not a 100, maybe 1000? Although how often do you see any good posts with that many comments? It never happens, 100 is a decent amount. Maybe not perfect but decent.
---
I actually kind of like the music in Appalachia radio.
---
You think a company giving you a product has lied so you have given them more money.
---
Wow you are a brilliant consumer, real smarts right here.
---
Not necessarily, but players that do should be aware that they're giving in to a greedy money grubbing business practice and company. They (Bethesda) really don't even care about this community. You can really see their active-ness on this sub.
---
&gt; We want to create an Atomic Shop experience where players feel good about spending their hard-earned Atoms. To make the system more fun and engaging for all players, we plan on reworking parts of the Challenge and reward system next year to be clearer, more fun, and more impactful for all types of players.
---
&gt; Of course, players can also buy Atoms, and we’re careful with everything we add to not upset the game’s balance. Our main objective is to avoid a situation where players can spend money to gain a competitive advantage or make the game worse for other players. Even more so, we want systems that allow players who do choose to buy Atoms to make the game better for others, not just themselves. With these principles in mind, we make careful decisions about the items we offer to keep it fair for everyone
---
These are not even close to guidelines. This is a pipe dream and a barefaced lie. Besides, the previous guidelines were "cosmetics only". Yet again I ask you (since you have been dodging the question): What makes you think they won't change their "guidelines" again to better suit their future agenda?
---
It's funny they'd be paying more than $100 per year on power costs / hardware costs to run it lovally.
---
He's actually responding?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
So
---
Folks who stopped playing after FO4
---
Maybe that's for the best at this point, these idiots haven't lifted a finger to fix the game and have stolen all of our suggestions to hide behind a paywall. Shut it down honestly.
---
What is Fallout 1st?
---
So you are deflecting again and not answering my question? 
---
Ok as I said, we are done here. All you want to do is be combative.
---
If they change their guidelines I will evaluate and determine if I agree with them. I agree with their current principles. If they deviate from them I may be upset. Now your turn. What do you disagree with, currently?
---
I doubt most would be running it 24/7, and the private worlds are not even 24/7 (correct me if I’m wrong)
---
You’re right it doesn’t make too much sense. They’re doing it for fun I guess. Although I wouldn’t put 76 and fun in the same sentence. Not anymore at least.
---
Oh I fully admit that. I want everyone to agree with my opinion because it’s, well, correct.
---
Same name. FlavoredCancer.
---
As opposed to all the other times people gang up on other people...

I see that guy laughing on a pile of money, like this

I'm glad you support predatory microtransactions and lies. Have fun being a Bethesda shill and hurting gaming as a whole.
---
The upvote thing isn't accurate. To many people downvote because they just don't like the game so will downvote anything constructive, but still hang around to bash the game. I say people, but I mean dickheads.
---
i too “had” this problem... https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/diphnw/is_the_youve_reached_a_new_level_in_adventure/ 
---
it’s a somewhat bug with steps to do to see if it works.
---
How do you suppose you'll be able to 'get' me and also why would you care enough?
---
Keep it! That happened to me with one of my characters. A level 5 laser rifle with almost the same damage as a max level bloodied laser rifle. It worked for me until I got to level 50 and I put a recon scope on it (I think it was a recon scope but not really sure) then it went back to normal damage so I scrapped it.
---
Non havent cared to update. Maybe I'll get around around to it in a few day.
---
Im only allowed to play once I have done my dailys in adventure mode
---
Is Xbox game pass a shitty business practice? No.
---
They made it a nice and convenient way to identify who is part of the problem. I'm deleting anyone on my friends list who threatens, griefs, or otherwise targets people for spending their own money on things they find entertaining or useful.
---
Oh yeah PC is tottaly a thriving bubbling community... Alteast the console guys have fun casual pvp battles.
---
Because not everyone is willing to buy a game after seeing how toxic the community gets and youtubers aswell play a huge role in the toxic fallout as manny who want to get into a game thease days they look to youtube first.
---
Keep doing it men make fallout great again 👍
---
Seems odd for sure. But hey if it's a good weapon then no loss.
---
Lmao facts
---
Its not the best choice, Its SPACERS choice!
---
Gotta do something while waiting for wastelanders
---
Game doesn't deserve to stay afloat if they can't incentivize people to actually pay for anything. How is that hard to understand? They provided a shitty experience and everyone knows it so their sales are low. Making a subscription service is just a reach for whale cash.
---
Bethesda is a corporation, not a person, and doesn't need nor cares about their "white knights".  Quit defending their shit, and quit fighting the ones that fell for it.
---
We’re not talking about Wastelanders. We’re talking about a feature that’s specifically not Wastelanders that should also be free. And because it’s not, people are leaving the game and won’t ever try Wastelanders so who even cares if it’s free or not?
---
What growth do you want elsewhere and what type of growth?
---
Society requires growth because society consumes resources, food, energy, and people. With the growing population of the world we have to keep growing our consumption.  I don't have a metric or statistic to show that we are or are not sucking resources like a mosquito, but the system of our growth, what would you like it to be. I am clearly in favor of Capitalism with strong social policies and a population with a moral belief that no one is inherently better than anyone else, but what do you recommend?
---
Now nature is a separate discussion from the political system. Preserving nature requires a leader and a people that identify that nature has a value worth protecting. It isn't capitalism that is causing the devastation, it is greed pure and simple, and greed exists in any political system. This goes back to my earlier point. 
---
I have been around the world many times to 3rd world countries (believe me or don't, your choose), and I have stared evil in the face, Poverty. This poverty came from evil men whose greed took all the money for themselves, and didn't build a system where his people could thrive. They didn't build and maintain roads, electrical system, water/sewage, and an education system. Guess what, the political system wasn't capitalism, they were dictators. 
---
I am slowly seeing more and more of this greed in our American society. I see it all the time in the gaming industry, burnouts and over priced monetization meant to maximize profits at the expense of the player base. We wouldn't really be having this discussion if the corporations actually operated with the intent to maximize profits but divided over a large client base. Which is what capitalism is about, giving the most amount of people a good product at the cheapest price. 
---
This is where we disagree I think. I believe our society is breaking down because greed, and I think you believe that the whole system is terrible and should be thrown out.
---
I do I think it is way cool
---
That’s amazing 
---
I also confused adventure mode with survival mode
---
Roflmao.
---
Wait adults play video games wtf...
---
If someone fired at her as soon as she spawns, she (or other legendary mobs) can stop morphing into starred creatures. I’ve witnessed this a couple of times.
---
Thanks for sharing. This is how exchanges should go. Did it ever get resolved? I honestly rarely pay attention to xp earned so have no idea if I’ve experienced this or not. I have a character exclusive for NW but just curious.
---
No, in most definitely doesnt. More content will get locked behind paywalls and Bethesda will continue lying to us. Oh boy, the old "People are starving so you shouldn't care about this" argument.
---
The one attached for the post
---
I bet you have millions of shallow opinions.
---
Na, it’s just USD is shitting all over AUD/NZD right now. We just cop a 10% GST tax. 
---
Wouldn’t surprise me if Bethesda was charging us extra though thinking they could hide it behind the exchange rate differences.
---
The only reason I would ever pick the game up again is to grief faillout first players... actually, this has gotten me excited to play fallout like no other update lol good job beth, you know how to bring players back!!
---
Edit: grief is only possible if you enable pvp mode, so in a way you’re telling people you’re up for it
---
That’s because they didn’t expect to get the backlash they did for removing a core feature of the Fallout franchise. They don’t get points for taking something out and then adding it back in after getting chewed out.
---
So anyone not willing to spend money or participate and encourage others to spend is part of the problem? If you pay for this, I do not want you as my friend. I don't want you buying things from my store either. Not threatening anyone, Thumbs down emote is not griefing and I'll do it whenever I like.
---
I’m also surprised you haven’t found anything better. It’s not even legendary, just a generic charging laser.
---
I am playing other games *cough* Outer Worlds *cough* but I was just wondering your logic
---
You’re goddamned right I do.
---
Because if no one plays your game dies?
---
Is it a bug or intended feature? (So sad I have to ask that)
---
&gt; obsidian only made a few modern bounds with their one entry in the franchise
---
Oh, did you not know? Obsidian is the studio made by the guys who made Fallout 1 and 2. Fallout 1 and 2 were made by Black Isle studios, a subsidiary of Interplay Entertainment. Black Isle studios decided to split off into its own company, Obsidian Entertainment. Interplay sold the license to Fallout to Bethesda. I guess that's a little history lesson on the franchise for you. Obsidian Entertainment are the real masterminds behind the Fallout franchise. 
---
You're right though, I see your point. Obsidian actually stated they would love to make another Fallout game, if Bethesda lets them. I wish Bethesda would.
---
Lol dont tell them. Let them find out later
---
Folks who are playing Outer Worlds instead
---
What happens when you stop paying? The unlimited junk pile gets locked inside the box?
---
Usually, I don’t grief people, but this service is ridiculous and they are just giving Bethesda approval by paying for it. Let the fun begin.
---
i commented this before and ill say it again sorry i want to farm a ws nuke without the whole server fighting to kill the ghouls and like others said the atoms alone make up for the value and this is absolutely not p2w its pay for convenience and i like convenience and yes i agree the Scrapbox could have been avoided by making scrap weight 0
---
I play it but it’s not the same thing as 76 so i won’t compare.
---
Who do you think you are!!!
---
Its ok

---
I haven’t crashed in months but appreciate your snark
---
Yeah that sweet 25 hour campaign LOL
---
Who the hell pays for Fallout 1st
---
Your a hero of the people.
---
“Great feature” yeah I don’t know about that. Fallout 1st is a stupid idea, I would just feel scammed if I bought it. I don’t care about the people who bought it. If they want to support a sinking ship then they can.
---
But private servers and therefore mods are not and they should be. They don’t get points for giving us a few free quests here and there. The only real content of any meat was Nuclear Winter.
---
How much is a pack of smokes in NZ?
---
See you on the battlefield friend, lets nuke them back to the stone age.
---
My comments have positive upvotes. I'm not surprised the bandwagoners like yourself downvote without even clicking on the post. Notice how no one has supported any if your comments in either post btw. Its pathetic that you spend all your time being negative and attacking strangers on the internet for how they choose to enjoy a video game.
---
EDIT:  looked at your post history and I get it now. It's all just emo music so I guess I know who I'm dealing with here. The same kid that tried to get attention by saying he's a "satanist" and then gets salty when no cares.
---
Freedom I non negotiable.
---
I thought of it too, but it's risky when the subscription expires:
---
\- they can change their mind anytime.
---
\- deny support if anything happens to your scrapbox.
---
\- force you to subscribe again with no guarantee to help you get your junk back.
---
My karma has increased by ten whole points thank you very much
---
oh I plan to do a very unhappy dance telling everyone their at fault hehe.
---
 You think other games don't already lock things behind pay walls? Bungie just did it with destiny!
---
You're so blinded by rage at random people on the internet, you can't be reasoned with. If you think people starving is a stupid argument, then you are a sad individual. Glad I'm not you.
---
I’d put money on OP making it up. It’s crazy that posting a low effort title with one sentence of body text and no video proof to go with it is enough to get everyone circlejerking into a fury.
---
Your first point is absurd lol.
---
Basically everything after that is equally absurd.
---
They die when Bethesda dies
---
What platform are you on?
---
Paul Tassi is a moron. He never knows what he is talking about. Normal servers support 24 users. Supporting 24 on one server costs the same as supporting one user on a private server. 24 times as much.
---
Still can't believe they removed the survival mode for this crap.
---
I think the points and loot are worth it. Don't mind the private server but rather play the public server. Bought the game to be a raider, can't really do that on a private server. Just don't subscribe to the year
---
Im not saying the business practice is good you fucking div. Im just as pissed about the subscription as you rejects. What I'm saying is that players getting irrationally angry at other players for buying into this ISNT bethesdas fault.
---
I'll break it down like this. One guy walks into starbucks and buys the hip new £5 coffee. I wait outside and when he comes out, i smack it out of his hand because I think its overpriced.
---
I do this to everybody who buys that hip coffee.
---
Is that starbucks fault for overpricing their coffee? Or my fault for being an asshole?

Have you met 8-12 year olds whose parents just throw money at them to keep them busy?
---
What platform?
---
Right, so let’s ridicule them because they don’t believe what we do?!  well done fellow human...
---
“Never should have come here, I’ll mount your head on my wall.” 
---
The best death threats in the history of death threats.
---
“[private]””[servers]”
---
&gt; I agree with their current principles
---
You agree with nothing. These are not principles. These are PR speak lies, just like the promises that I have outlined as previously broken. 
---
&gt; What do you disagree with, currently?
---
Did you read my post at all? I disagree with Fallout 1st as a concept. It is a promise broken, no more no less. I disagree that they should get away with breaking promises without repercussion.I disagree with your notion that those are principles. Though it's clear that you'll forgive them if they sliced off your arms for a laugh. You claim that I wish to be combative. I don't. As I've stated before, I want Bethesda to make things right and restore the goodwill from the community. But it's because of apologetic suck-ups like you that they'll get away with greedy BS like Fallout 1st.
---
I got the armor for FREE!!!
---
Cry us a river, you fucking sook.
---
1V1 ME SCRUB CARBEAR!!! IM THE EBST PVPEPR TIN GAMEQAAAA!!!
---
Man you summed up politics and the world so concisely.
---
Bethesda just wants money though.
---
Still not sure where the lie or doublespeak is though. Is it on how we read his quotes?  If we look objectively at his wording there is no lie nor doublespeak. Now if there is a quote by him I am missing or I should be aware of that would give credence to a lie or doublespeak.   
---
I will admit I am not more versed in other things he has said aside from the two quotes I have presented. But I welcome any that could put things into a different perspective.   
---
I also admit if english is not your first language that how he phrased things could be seen in a different light but it would be on the reader that misunderstood.   
---
At the end of the day Content = Season pass/DLC in meaning and P2W = PvP advantage. I just do not see how it could be seen differently.
---
Fine then, ill make my own server with black jack and hookers. You know what, forget the black jack...eh forget the whole thing...(does the robot dance in sadness)
---
Ask the people with fallout 1st icons
---
It just works!
---
I'm on PC. That's a shame.
---
Does starbucks serve you stale fucking coffee with sour milk? No
---
Fallout 76 is the stale coffee with sour milk, and now they are charging you 13 bucks extra a month for some real sugar
---
I appreciate the satire here. This reads like A Modest Proposal.
---
Nah not hired thugs, it's Todd and Pete
---
I honestly don't see a problem here. If people are dumb enough to fall for this scam then they deserve any flack they get. Besides, they can just go to a private server to avoid this whole thing regardless.
---
Hell yeah, super fun!
---
Your right on that. I didn’t realize the complaint was about the optional ability to add content or not.
---
This is Bethesda were talking about
---
Well... I missed out Fasnacht Parade "season".
---
The mechanics are already in the game, I don't know why they didn't think of it specially they already work hard on cosmetics/atomic shop too.
---
Me  I did.
---
Hey OP so that laser rifle you've found is bugged hard! 
---
I consider myself somewhat if a laser rifle expert (can craft both normal and Ultracite lasers, every mod,  us a 3*AA laser rifle for my main) and none of my laser rifles have ever hit that DMG even with all full level rifle man perk cards. 
---
It's not a small difference either. My 3*AA lv50 laser rifle with all Max dmg mods only sits at 108 base damage so that's a difference of 80 points
---
Definitely something to hold on too. Makes me wonder if it's bugged or if I have a "faulty" laser
---
Xbox
---
I don’t defend Bethesda, but mods are cancer and shouldn’t ever be available im a multiplayer game, even if the servers are private.
---
Xbox Live Gold, and more recently, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, has cost me a grand total of **$1** over the past few years, and I have enough built up to last me until March 2022. Microsoft Rewards is awesome if you live in a country that has it.
---
Clearly you just want to be angry. I don’t know why I re-engaged. Maybe I thought you were sincere when you said you wanted to have a conversation. I was trying to have a mature/civil conversation. You insult anyone who doesn’t agree with you. A bit of advice- that tactic is rather counter productive.
---
Anyway, enjoy being angry. I hope you find what you are looking for.
---
Ps- what is with all the violent imagery? It’s a little disturbing.
---
I hope
---
Alex, I'll take False Equivalence for $500.
---
Fair enough
---
Lol why would Rockstar need to pay people to say that? RDR2 was *clearly* the better option
---
I still play it but im kind of gamer illiterate, and i got it for free. everyones talking about outer worlds so im probably gonna google it and maybe get it
---
If anything, only absolute base scrap and bulks should have no weight
---
Its been a while since you posted this but i was of course looking for the same thing - i do recall the exact location you mention and it very much helped me out as there are exactly 5 skulls there.  
---
Head to Vault 76, the go east to where the watch tower is, keep going east and a bit south to where the cliff line is. The cabin is there, you can get onto the deck by going around back and underneath where the murdered skeletons are. Come up through the hole in the floor and the hot tub is on the deck. 5 skulls inside an 10 atom :)
---
Yes, sir! Oohrah!
---
I admit I bought fallout 1st and my very first game froze completely. I’m a sucker.
---
Never played Destiny, not a Destiny fan. If it's anything like Fallout 76 than its pretty horrible. You can lock certain stuff behind paywalls. But it's not okay to say you won't and then do it anyways. At such a ridiculous price nonetheless.
---
The "your problem is irrelevant because there are other problems" argument is just a way to deflect  criticism against things you like.
---
Do you mean survival? If so then yes. Classic would be your regular adventure mode.
---
Controversial opinion but I don't like new Vegas that much. It couldn't enthrall me quite like Skyrim when I still played that. For comparison I really only play fallout 4 with tons of mods to make it actually "Just Work"
---
Low price, more like no price. Should have been for free.
---
They only cost money because Bethesda designed it that way. And I don't think they cost nearly as much money as Bethesda are making from this scam. If the servers were *truely* private (i.e. dedicated servers running on the players own computers) it wouldn't have cost Bethesda a single cent.
---
Targeting? Turn on pacifist. Sad cause someone thumbs-downed? Please.
---
If you're new I would recommend joining this subreddit  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
I just tried doing what they said by killing an enemy that rewards exp but still I have not leveled up.
---
&gt; Clearly you just want to be angry
---
I could not be more clear about this: I don't want to be angry. I also stated that I want to have a discussion here. Your dismissiveness is just infuriating. You'll dismiss me because I disagree with you. You'll call it anger because you don't want to face the facts I've presented. And you respond so damn fast it's clear you don't even read a word I say.
---
how about those of us that defend the game actually you know enjoy the fucking game? we are defending our view on it because people like you decide that you want to come in and be assholes about everything and anything no matter how small it might be. people who fight for the game actually want to keep playing
---
Fallout 3 music is still undefeated
---
Fallout 1st is great. I’m absolutely loving it.
---
Check out what a server instance costs on AWS.
---
No. You can still withdraw, but not deposit
---
I feel like Zenimax is part of the problem.
---
Someone posted about the same thing not too long ago. It just randomly appeared in their inventory.
---
You beat me too it. Stay filthy.
---
Happy to help but in the UK. If that's cool hit me up, GT is Dunda.
---
Damn, really? Wow. Will definitely keep it
---
Starbucks is absolutely fucking vile as it is, and as such my point still stands.
---
You can hate the game all you want. That doesn't justify being a major fucking asshole to players under the guise of "sticking it to bethesda".
---
Lol thanks 😂
---
there is a MAXIMUM weight reduction for everything which is 90%. you cannot reduce weight below that threshold.
---
People shouldn't do this. If people are stupid enough to pay for Fallout 1st ganging up on them seems over the top.
---
Although I thought Fallout 1st gave you access to private servers, so I'm confused as to why Fallout 1st people are playing with the normal (non stupid) people.
---
So players with first are targeting other players with first as well??
---
Seasonal events have been around since WoW at least and are different because they 1) aren’t often, 2) short term as in a week-4 weeks, and 3) usually offer the same experience with minor additions each year. They correlate with real holidays most of the time as well.
---
Seasons like in BFV and Fortnite force players to play that game everyday to not miss out on cosmetics, weapons, and content. No time between and often times, never repeated. The rewards may pop up here and there, but again, you’d have to play as much as you could everyday to hit them all. 
---
The difference is “seasons” meaning holiday events, and “seasons” as in sports seasons. Holiday events are fun short-term events that bring a change of pace, seasons are ways to force players to only play that game.
---
You are all the same.
---
u/ladydevann said she doesn't get notifications if she's not tagged in the comments
---
I was going to quit until wastelanders since the game got boring but after they announced it was delayed AND they had the audacity to launch a shitty subscription service that includes many features people have been asking for for months AND the fact that they lied and said stash budget couldn’t be increased because of server limits but then add an unlimited scrap box, I officially quit the game. It’s boring, they delayed the content update so they could make a shitty subscription service, and they have lied so many times
---
Bethesda can keep the Fallout license. I want to see where Obsidian takes The Outer Worlds after this one.
---
You sure are. Better try and get your money back if that's possible.
---
You simply keep playing like you always have? Yeah it sucks they are screwing people over with locking the junkbox behind the Private Server paywall, but it's  existence doesn't actually change anything if you keep playing the way you always have. I took a break because I am waiting on Wastelanders, not because of the Fallout 1st crap
---
Literally the publisher handles funding and monetization methods.
---
Yep
---
Cause the game itself is still fun. I don’t agree with how they are handling this, but at the end of the day I still enjoy the game, my friend just got ps plus and the game as it was on sale so I’m going to have a good time with him as we roam this glitchy wasteland just messing around.
---
Not sure why you're acting like this is an unpopular opinion or hasn't been posted several times already
---
Bethesda’s whole identity is built around the concept of free and open modding. And plenty of multiplayer games have implemented modding successfully. Mods=/=hacks. We’re talking about mods that add content like quests and new locations; not god mode cheat codes.
---
True to a point, but sometimes dangerous.  There's a reason that some deceptive business practices are, again, *illegal.*  And even if you accept that, it's still completely understandable that someone would be irked when your purchases hurt them.  It's true that nobody can tell you what to buy.  But it's also true that you can't tell people not to express opinions about what you buy when you talk about it in public.
---
Here's a comparison--not perfect by any means, but I think it explains why it's reasonable for people to be annoyed.  Imagine that whiskey companies decided to save $$ by watering down all their booze.  Consumers got mad, but enough of them stayed that it was still a profitable decision.  Some companies watered down further and further to the point that you could barely taste the alcohol or get drunk.  This pissed off most of the customer base, but enough consumers had brand loyalty that the companies still turned a profit by milking the ones who stayed.  Because enough customers continued buying to make this practice profitable, most of our favorite producers are doing this and it's increasingly hard to find a decent bottle.
---
Here, you're one of the people who keeps buying the increasingly watery whiskey, justifying the company's decision to do so.  The rest of us can't stop you from spending your money like that--it's your money after all--but it's completely understandable that we'd be upset about it because your spending habits have cost us our favorite distilleries.
---
It has nothing to do with deflection. It has everything to do with realizing what's truly important in life. How some random internet strangers spend their money is not that important.
---
I thought they could retreat to a private session. Isn't the whole point of it to avoid player engagement?
---
I enjoy it because it's fun to me. I like collecting scrap and exploring. Fun is subjective.
---
I still enjoy the game and haven't put a dime into it after paying $20 for it a few weeks ago. Once wastlanders does eventually come out, that'll add more.
---
Yup that's what I'm talking about.
---
It's fair they monetize their game, grind or pay for a quick and easy access.
---
Learn from other Game as a Service.
---
Now I see what people mean by pay to win. It's not that you win by paying, it's that you lose if you don't
---
I think the people that have bankrolled Zeni might be pulling most of the strings here.
---
Yeah! Cause that GoT season 8 petition really did sumin
---
It’s a hit or miss opinion on this server. Depends on which side finds your post first.
---
Yes, I’m aware, that’s part of syncing raw data (sanity checks) between clients. My point is that the engine is irrelevant because the server doesn’t run the game itself, just like Apache doesn’t run a web browser. Actually running a game like FO76 takes a lot more computing power than running a server.
---
The “Cheat Terminal Portable” mod
---
Ya didnt really know about that, so ya
---
I love the idea of weight for scrap. I just wish there wasnt only 800 space in your storage box and I wish that scrap didnt weigh as much.
---
I see what you did there
---
To think that you have to buy the fallout first to have some decent pvp again. (Don’t @ me)
---
Yeah, survival. I wish we could get it back.
---
Ok. I'll be off and on tomorrow ...  I hope you are too! I'm gonna give you stuff ok!
---
Thanks now I know I can filter the assholes by throwing up the FO1st icon.
---
My AutoAxe I've been waiting for since creation club released &gt;_&lt;
---
What system are you on? I'll come grief you.
---
Hello me! How is you very unpopular opinion? 
---
I got more into fallout tactics back in the day then I did Vegas and I got both day 1
---
How exactly are they targeting you?
---
I’m not being dismissive at all. I’m just refusing to engage with insults.
---
I read quickly... I’m a grown adult
---
They are targeting people with the fallout 1st icon
---
We wanted survival back and this will end up being a way better pvp than before
---
holy shit this comment had me rolling hahaha so true though..
---
Good, don’t think they would wanna be friends with a big fucking NERD
---
&gt;"Positive thoughts are the glasses that life gives to you"
---
Sorry dude. This changes nothing as my comment had nothing to do with general negativity or Fallout 1st. It's more why get a company that historically has always left hype to the very last moment (except with Starfield and ES VI, but that felt more like a cushion for the Fallout 76 multiplayer announcement for single player fans)? Especially considering that they obviously are struggling to even get content that they promised to get out now many months later.
---
Nice saying though. BTW, you're LOVE The Secret! Omg, it's so you! You should check it out.
---
I'm still trying to figure out if its worth it.  Soon everyone will be on their own private server and the public will be empty.
---
interesting, thanks. I suppose for people disposed to gambling-like addictions (or things like it, obsessive in-game purchases, whatever), some of these game companies have gotten it down to an absolute science, much more than slot machines and other types of gambling I'd imagine, with increasing technology and data and so on.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
You have to do the idle explosives daily in the mire.
---
Who's leaving the game? You have a census on fo population now? Because people on reddit, a small part of the fo population are saying they're leaving, but most won't. And those who do, a fair amount will return.
---
You say it has nothing to do with Wastelanders, but you know it does and will.
---
Again, I'm not here for upvote wars. And I don't need help from friends and clone accounts to validate my opinions. I spent 450 hours around this game and have been actively trying to support this thing long enough. 
---
But in the last few months it became obvious that Bethesda doesn't give a shit about it's players and fallout first is the final proof of that. The massive backlash is also proof of that. Are you going to deny the massive backlash they're getting?? Is it a small bandwagon? No! It's a fuc*ing huge train! 
---
If you can't step out of your shell and admit that fallout first is a scam, then yes you're delusional. 
---
I started by arguing that soloing the queen and server stability are not worth the value of subscription. If you can't handle a different opinion, you're acting like fanatics.
---
Look, I'm out. I even left the sub this afternoon. Downvote all you want. Be happy with Fallout 76, I'm going to the Outer Worlds. Bye.
---
Edit: no, i don't listen to emo music. And I'm 39 yo btw.
---
That last edit revealed your true colors. Thanks.
---
What big company hasn't lied to you?
---
Do you care about the environment and still drink coke or drive a car that strictly runs on gas?
---
Do you disagree with animal cruelty while still going through McDonald's or eat Tyson's chicken from time to time?
---
Do you disagree with Bethesda's methods yet still play their games?
---
Or do you sit in the woods playing with sticks and empty jugs?
---
I don't condone Bethesda's unethical and consistent lies but its typical for a company to do that. *They all do.* If that makes me dumb then I guess you're dumb too. Welcome to reality. /doesrobot
---
Yeah, it's not a broken piece of shit.
---
It’s a product like anything else. You wouldn’t be saying the same thing with your car. You should expect (bar any reasonable bugs) that the game would be feature complete at launch, sadly these games as a service are basically just a way for developers to ship half complete buggy messes. 
---
If the intention is to ship half a game, it does not warrant or deserve the full RRP it demands. Because let’s face it, most of these games are dead through succession at a later date, or dead for lack of content keeping people other than the dire hard fans around.
---
Except this wasn't free. The game was already 60 bucks and it was advertised as a full-price game, with every update afterwards beings entirely free. The argument of me being entitled to free stuff is ridiculous, because none of this was free.
---
It’s easy. Don’t the servers host like 8 people? Split the cost between you and 7 friends
---
What's truly important in life is entirely subjective.
---
It is important to me because it affects a big part of my life. The random stranger's purchase does affect me.
---
Ppl will cry even if everything was free. Lvl 200 plus got their money’s worth but want to bitch cause nobody’s kissing their ass. I’ll spend my money on what ever in the F@ck I want and dint need dicks telling me I’m wrong for doing it!
---
I play because I love fallout and I havent gotten bored with exploring and the interactions my shop brings. I seriously dont want to be briefed harder now because I continue to play. I'd never get a sub to any game but I dont think that's going to keep a target off my back. Griefers are griefers a cause is just to justify their actions. That doesn't mean they wont just say fuck it and use it as a reason to steal scrap and caps I guess.
---
I feel Ubisoft would handle the title better
---
Should of just let us host it on our own servers.
---
Nice.  You get rewards as subscriptions to live? 
---
How much will Xbox game pass ultimate cost you next month?
---
The saying "you do you boo" applies here. I think you will eventually get bored, and be in the same bucket as the rest of us.  I played with my SO and kid, and enjoyed it. Eventually, you'll realize you fall in a category, Whale or shrill.  No matter what you are or what you spend, you can't keep a sinking ship from sinking.
---
whataboutism 101
---
It won’t. This last blunder was it for me. Considering the sheepsquach quest line could be done so quickly solo I doubt wastelanders is going to be much different.
---
I guess, of course thats not even getting into how sleezy it is, to sell stuff people want as features, especially when some things like weapon repair and such seemed to have been broken on  purpose to sell a fix later.
---
Targeting by doing what though? Going in voicechat to harass you or what?
---
poor rich basterds
---
If you buy a month of fallout first and put the icon on you’ll get a great pvp experience.
---
hairless cats
---
Health and wellbeing of your fellow man is only subjective if you are a sociopath dude. It's not that deep.
---
You're dismissing every time I mention promises broken. That's not an insult is it? I chose to insult you because it's clear you'll take Bethesda's side no matter what. That's why I make those graphic remarks. Because judging by your current behaviour, you'll literally take Bethesda's side no matter what. They broke promises, lied to your face, and they admit this, and you praise them for their new guidelines (even though those guidelines are the actual admission that they broke their prior promise no less!). It speaks to your character, or rather the absence thereof.
---
Sounds like a 'I don't like either candidate, so I won't vote' argument. How's that working?
---
I know right? How can anyone have a different opinion than you.  It's disgusting.
---
I think we should string up and stone anybody who doesn't think along the same lines as you.
---
Dogmeat for camps
---
They totally are, but maybe they’d want to avoid future PR disasters and give it back to Obsidian to try? A new developer? A man can hope...
---
LOL?
---
That sounds pretty on the nose about the demographic paying that much
---
Sure is optimized like shit though. I can't even go to the Groundbreaker without my FPS dropping to single digits
---
Because the name "Butt Stallion" has already been taken and I will not accept any substitutes!
---
Sorry again, well thanks for your opinion
---
Zzz
---
I think RDR2 is so damn boring. I still am having a hard time getting engaged a year later. Only have 10 hours logged but damn is it slow. I thought fallout was slow but damn lol. 
---
Maybe it’s because I never played either of the other entries in the series but I have played Many iterations of GTA and bully so you’d think I would know my way around a rockstar game.
---
Like I said, I have Game Pass Ultimate until March 2022. And I'll extend that by getting more points on [Microsoft Rewards](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/rewards).
---
It actually made national news and is at least partly to blame for the creators ducking out of Comic-Con last minute and going into hiding. HBO PR wasn’t too pleased with the reception. 
---
I hope that Bethesda has fucked up enough now that Zenimax notices and wants to give another team a shot at the franchise!
---
We almost made Appalachia a better place when we were working together and seemingly rebuilding our virtual society. Now things have plunged into chaos due to different ideologies about how 76 should be handled. I guess it was only a matter of time where we would go back to fighting each other. War never changes.
---
I suggest Outer Worlds for a buck the first month...
---
Pretty sure I saw someone on Charleston Junkyard with Ranger armor griefing a low level.
---
Modular legendaries
---
That would not be fair for the community. Just hide your stuff until things cool down. People are angry at Bethesda and anyone that gets in the way
---
Gta online and red dead online are 100% pay to win games. You pay to get everything instantly. Yea you can play missions races, so many different game modes  of pvp which are fun and Rockstar also publishes player made game modes if they're worth putting up but all the money you spend irl is to not have to grind for money to buy stuff. Gta online works like real life. It takes money to make money. You can open up a business, multiple business in fact. Hire body guards they get a cut of your profit and get paid a small amount per in game day. If you have a high end apartment or underground bunker you can set up a heist which are the highest paying missions in the game but you need to good players for it. One person dies in the 4 player coop, the whole mission is reset. Each heist has 4 or 5 parts to it cause there's set up parts and the final part is the heist itself. The leader pays into the heist to get it going and has control of the precentage his teammates can get. It's always the leader get 40% and 3 other players get 20%. If the leader is greedy then the 3 other guys will only get 15%. There's a very big pay out challenge though to compete all the heists and all secondary objectives flawlessly with the same people and no one dies for a huge payout at the end of all 5 heists which I think is 10 million dollars plus the final heists payout. That's only do able once per character. Some guys like youtuber gta videos, have done the heists multiple times on 2 or 3 characters and made so much in game money grinding out those heists and then doing business missions together.
---
Why did survival even get axed in the first place? I hopped on for the first time in forever the other day and was confused when I couldn't find it.
---
Use Contractor Perk to save mats while building, it's not just for workshops. 
---
Doesn't help with raising CAMP budget cap, though.
---
So you're defending this paid feature by pointing out that it's broken for everyone and that's fine?
---
That's criminal.  All outfits I can craft I consider common and charge a base 50 caps for hats-helmets and 100 caps for outfits.  250/500 for uncommons like Science Scribe Uniform and Bomber Jacket.  Rares and limited event rewards are closer to market price.
---
They are too scared to respond to complaints
---
“Identify as gamers”
---
Ah yes, the most oppressed minority
---
nope
---
Maybe. It'd be interesting to see a new Vegas in a better engine.
---
Ive been rocking the icon and wearing my ncr armor and no one has tried to pvp me. But also 50% of the camps or players I encounter have fallout 1st stuff as well.
---
Communism bad
---
**Capitalism good**
---
Ok thanks
---
I really think they shouldn't have made a traditional season/battle pass either. Don't get me wrong, it would have been better. But it would still have been awful. They promised us "no season passes and no paid DLC". This being another promise broken on top of the "cosmetic-only" promise being broken, it's infuriating.
---
Because my enjoyment of the game is in no way related to the business positions of the company that makes it.
---
Did I just read a YouTube video?
---
Shills
---
I love democracy
---
I play both at the same time and FO76 is so dead I allow myslef to get disconnected and turn my other rig off to save power!
---
..and I can filter the irresponsible consumers responsible for this continued pay to win fuckery. Fun times.
---
Perfect example of why inequity is bad for society
---
That seems to be exactly what they're doing. I did the maths on it when the details were first released and AU/NZ are getting charged 20-25% extra after currency conversion as opposed to the 10-15% that would make sense for GST+ exchange rate wiggle room.
---
If you are only in adv to sell, then there is nothing anybody can do to target you.
---
You do not make any sense.
---
Am I upset that they changed their guiding principles? No. Of course companies can change and evolve. If they couldn’t, Amazon would still just be a book company. I looked at the current statement they put out and evaluated whether or not I agreed with it. I decided “yes this sounds like the right direction” and now evaluate future atom shop and paid content decisions against it. 
---
For example, I think the scrap box is a bad idea and not in line with their principles. That should not exist.  I’m not going to tell someone it’s equivalent to their parents being murdered but could understand someone being upset by that. 
---
As I illustrated above I would not take Bethesda’s side no matter what. You would know that if you took the time to engage in a civil dialogue like I asked.
---
And again, you just can’t help but include some insults in your response. It makes you come off as a teenager (which maybe you are, I don’t know). My point is it is very immature.
---
Nooo... but thanks I guess this was my opinion anyway if there's a YouTube video about this I'll be glad to watch it.
---
Yeah, the community is falling apart.
---
Yeah. I’m honestly not surprised though
---
BETTER DEAD THAN RED!
---
[It has been used in lots of places.](https://daveola.com/Pages/Stuff/Consumer_Whore.jpg)
---
Bethesda’s reasoning: it never functioned as intended and had a low player count 
---
Conspiracy reasoning: they just wanted to use the servers as the new private servers
---
You can't.
---
The server while only stay up if there is at least one person with a Fallout 1st subscription active. It wil shut down if the last subscriber leaves.
---
I think you're under estimating how big of a role zenimax plays in the direction that these games take. Look up the zenimax board of directors to see what I mean.
---
Oh ok. I was gonna ask for your game name to avoid buying shit from your vendors. Never mind.
---
Hell yeah lol
---
Nice try Todd
---
Because they never engage in cynical predatory monetization schemes....
---
Lmfao
---
Build anywhere
---
While yes it is getting ridiculous (I received a message telling me to kill myself) I aint shook. If people feel like a game is worth getting upset over it says alot more about them than it does the people that paid for Fallout 1st. I played since BETA, and definitely got my money worth. Ive met some of the best people I could ask for, battled the scorched and grinded for that perfect build that im yet to acheive. At the end of the day I enjoy the game, the community and everything in between. Im not going to let someone tell me how to spend my money or time. If you want to pay for Fallout 1st do it. If you dont? Then simply don't. We live in a world where there is plenty more things to be concerned over than 11.99 a month.
---
"Probably"?
---
I'm trying to be in their shoes, it's fair they try to monetize their game as a service even if we bought the base game just like RDO or The Division. 
---
With something pass or a ranking system we would have something to log in into the game for, and they could just keep it grind or pay.
---
I'd rather just message them and explain how much they're hurting the franchise, as well as future entries in Bethesda franchises. Paying for such an awful subscription gives Bethesda free reign to do it again in future games.
---
But to be honest, and I know how this is going to sound but I don't care, if you bought even one month of Fallout 1st, you deserve to be griefed. How dumb can you be? You already paid for the subscription so you're used to abuse anyway.
---
I would attack you non stop for being stupid enough to buy it. That's WHY people attack anyone with fallout 1st. Because we want to teach you not to be stupid
---
Oh shit the mods made a post about it better shut up right away or their gonna get you!!! LOL TheOuter Worlds is awsome for the record! FO76 has been a bug ridden piece of crap since launch and the Bethesda fanboys on reditt are some of the most toxic goodie goods around...
---
I injoy survival base biulding games and i love fallout. 76 is the best of both worlds
---
Hey I tried to do my best.
---
Why you say that :(?
---
Hahahaha you guys play with friends
---
Not a smoker but I think at the moment it’s roughly $25-30 NZD
---
Yeah it's actually fun LOL
---
Fallout: 1st Civil War
---
*Order now to pay 12.99 a day!*
---
Ok.
---
It's slow cause it's like 90% a simulation game. I feel the same way about the game. Gta 5, 4 and rdr1 felt like games that were fun cause it wasn't nearly based on simulating the old west as rdr2 does it. I hear it gets faster paced once you're out of the first town though but I haven't played rdr2 since last Nov.
---
The mods are gonna get you!
---
You could have just answered the question, ya'know. No need to be a jackhole
---
&gt; RDR2 was clearly the better option
---
Except that it was universally admitted that RDR2 online was way, way worse than FO76.
---
Because many players fail to close doors, and NPCs can enter when they're open.
---
Same reason you might see a staircase with a barrier or Punji board in front - YOU can jump over, but the NPCs can't.
---
Congrats! I buy most of my cards from player vendors.
---
Ouch.
---
Yeah its tottaly improved since the beta :/
---
I’ll attack back and use the robot dance emote above your dead body or ill stay on pacifist and follow you around doing the robot emote over and over
---
I missed the repair drama as it was a busy time for me. Did the event reward repair kits come out at the same time or later added after much outrage?  If it was done out of outrage yeah that is some sleazy shit right there and I agree.  As for weapons I never had an issue with gunsmith on I know luck perks were broken for a long while I think it was feb they were fixed.
---
No my sheep can't hold a conversation, they do come when called though- funny animals
---
Well i for one bought the membership because I WANT a competitive advantage in the game.
---
Now that I have a scrap box for my junk I have 100lbs of extra storage in my stash so I have more room to hoard legendaries!
---
Now I just need to wait THE EXACT same amount of time for the scrip machine to reset to sell them for scrip.
---
Wait a minute that doesn’t make sense because even with Fallout 1st I still can only get 150 scrip a day which means that being able to hoard more legendaries makes no difference at all.
---
Hmmm maybe I wasted my money trying to “pay-to-win” 🤔
---
At least I got the sick cosmetic ranger outfit! Oh AND more atoms than I could normally get for $12! That means I can buy MORE cosmetic items because why would I spend money on repair kits when I continuously get the improved ones from killing the Scorchbeast Queen????
---
Hmmm maybe this whole “fallout 1st is pay-to-win” narrative isn’t true.
---
Yes, but, horse testicles!  Gotta get that all-important horse-sex demographic!
---
I love it so far, it’s way better then getting mixed up with all the shit going on in 76.
---
Again, another saying im defending this. I'm giving this person an actual response instead of ranting on how it's not fair. I know this bug too well, I encounter it every time i spawn in a server to trade and try to greet the person with a wave. I end up switching weapons instead.
---
Thank you! Yeah that’s what i was thinking, just not sure when i will find someone selling them.
---
If Bethesda made cars they would make Yugos!
---
Sounds like we are in the same boat lol. I mean... weapons get dirty and I need to spend time cleaning them.... wtf? Lol
---
You're right, but I look at past games: ESO, NMS, D2 (Destiny) and I remember how awful they were at launch and how much they recovered. I also look at how long it took them to improve. If I'm having fun in the game, and I know it's gonna get better, then I'll probably stick around long enough if I like the series. I didn't with those, but they did get better and I want F76 to get better so I decide to support it
---
OMG I didn’t even notice that. If that’s for real that is hilarious.
---
Time to check out The Outer Worlds!!!
---
You watch. They'll sell us an additional radio station through the Atom Store for like 2000 atoms. Not even new songs, just the ones we've already heard in past Fallout games.
---
One issue I’ve always had with R* games is how you don’t unlock all the necessary activities and privileges until like 1/3 into the game. But really once you get the ball rolling in chapter 2 with hunting, completing challenges, unlocking trapper clothes, strangers and the awesome random encounters you start the understand. The game just has a vibe to it and you kinda fall in love with Arthur and the other characters, but mainly Arthur
---
I hear the Outer Worlds is pretty fun!
---
New Vegas has an amazing story and quests, but they sucked the replayability out of it. If you wander off of their intended path, you just run into Cazadors and Deathclaws. There are massive stretches of landscape that are nothing but rocks and cazadors. And not letting you play past the ending definitely didn’t help.
---
Say what else you will about FO3, FO4, and Skyrim; in those you can just wander in any direction and you’ll just constantly run into things to find and places to explore.
---
you're not the only one with weapons and armor, dumbass. And you still take damage even in pacifist, just heavily reduced. I could attack you for hours and hours if it means you learn your lesson. You're dumber than I thought XD. Fallout first and assuming you're invincible? Damn you're stupid.
---
I feel like these sorts of players would riot at McDonalds if they discontinued the McRib early and didn't give them all a free Big Mac.  Get over yourselves!  "We disagree with your sales model and won't contribute to it, but also give us free stuff to placate us!"
---
What is fallout first
---
I’d say they were on par. But RDO 180’d real good recently, which should’ve happened with 76 once Wastelanders came out
---
Same 99% of those people dont play the game they only hate hate and hate  and ignore all the good things that happen in 76
---
Huh. I havent had trouble yet. I'm running the ranger icon. Hopefully it isnt a new fad. But I am paying for my own server so I'll use it to my advantage while the haters are roaming the game they said they were quitting.
---
Well most of them claim that they deleted the game and that their bethesda days are over but they’re still here....🤷‍♂️
---
Where are you getting that statistic from?
---
I have my icon equip because I'm apart of that community. I have been approached by LGBT people showing love to me, I love that Bethesda did something for Pride month.
---
Congrats! You can track the drone carrying the Nuclear keycards at a terminal in the Enclave bunker :)
---
Same happened for weapon balances and nerfs.
---
It has though? Still bugs, but enough content to keep me interested. First few months of release and aside from trading, which legitimately saved this game, I was put to sleep several times. I mean I would decide to go to bed rather than play the game on a Saturday night lol
---
"OMG BADthesda how dare you do $MILDLYANNOYINGTHING.  I thought we were besties!  I had no idea you were a soulless corporation out to make a quick buck with a spinoff!
---
This game is completely and totally RUINED now.  Even more than the last 17 times it was ruined!  It's mega-ultra-ruined!"
---
That's a nice feature. I had to it manually.
---
Bye, Juliet.  Just don't expect a Romeo to fall on his own sword for you.
---
Much less need to eat or drink constantly. That is very irritating. I want to explore and enjoy the world. Imagine what life would be like if we have to stop and eat and drink every 10 minutes. Bad design.
---
Absolutely. I love me a good shit show cause I’m a dramatic bitch, but Outer Worlds is worth way more time
---
Don't  log off &amp; rubberband  that controller or mouse.
---
Oh okay i’ll try that, Thank you!
---
Wow. I mostly blame this subreddit for that shit. People should not be bullied for buying premium memberships. Thats wrong on every level. I hope they are reported and some bans issued for extremely toxic behavior.
---
not sure, I played at start, but then patches kept breaking the game and stopped playing, but never got back into it.  Every time I think I might they make the game worse.
---
you cant really grief anyone in adventure unless they have a workshop
---
How is it a slap in the face? Not once did they ever say private servers would be free, and content is strictly defined by bethesda as DLC/season pass level. Also they define P2W as a PVP advantage only.  Anything else is just hopping hate train bandwagon. You obviously were playing up until this and enjoying it but now you feel the need to be one of those people.
---
It's just like everything takes forever to do. Getting off your horse, turning around, pick something up, cooking, carrying, killing animals and skinning them all have really slow animations but it simulates real life super good! But it's just not really fun...rdr1 animations for things were a lot faster and simpler I guess which made it feel more like a game an overall more fun.
---
But ur also comparing apples to orenges as Fortnite is a free to play game vs a game that requiers purchase.
---
The mod that turns the fireman outfits into the NRC ranger outfit is pretty sweet!
---
Lol I didn't buy the game for the promised free stuff is what I'm saying
---
No one is saying it isn't fair.  They're saying it's broken and instead of being fixed we just got sold more.
---
Probably because Bethesda is about as original as everyone flooding this sub everytime some new controversy happens.
---
Hmm. I really liked GTA5 story. Maybe I just really hate horses or something. I just need more time to really sit down and get into it I think no can always pick up 76 for some mindless gameplay (not a bad thing), but that game seems to need more of my attention which is hard nowadays.
---
A snide remark by you followed by a snide comment by me, finished with a victim claim by you. 
---
We're all jackholes here, bub.
---
Then why don't you go to there reddit.
---
Fucking Appalachia elites.
---
I'm level 330 and have been playing since last November. Don't generalize that 90 percent of the people outraged are people who don't own the game. You have no poll or anything to base your assumption on...
---
Let's go to the Winchester, have a nice, cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over.
---
They are most likely prohibited from posting anything until Bethesda has first "assessed the situation". I am sure they are doing damage control right now.
---
But hey... it looks pretty! Right?
---
I've had a blast playing it, but I enjoy sandbox open world style games. But that is just me.
---
The thing is, the game was rigged from the start.
---
That makes no sense lol playing another game IS voting. Turning in a feedback report IS voting. Continuing to play the game yet shitting on it online anonymously IS NOT voting. It's saying "mmm yeah I like both candidates but I can't decide"
---
Gee it’s almost like legendary scrips aren’t the entire focus of the game or the fucking determinate for the game being P2W? If you have unlimited storage for junk vs someone else who doesn’t, you have an advantage. If you have another fast travel point you can set up, you have an advantage. When you get atoms to pay for unspoiled food and repair for weapons, you paid to win.
---
Congratulations. You pay $12.99 a month for a company to piss in your mouth, and you’re fighting SO hard to twist it where you’re not, LMAO
---
Explosive round. Shoot at my feet
---
His ass
---
Sorry about not commenting, I've been playing FO 76, mixing it up between adventure mode and private server. If you forget to pay your subscription or that you even have a subscription... you need to start writing that stuff down. Or have someone else manage your money for you. Im an adult, I know ALL of my bills and subscriptions. From WoW, FO 76, ESO. I also handle my husbands and son's subscriptions. And the Roku, Hulu, Netflix. I used to include Star Wars and Minecraft, but I cancelled those, why cause I didn't need them. I adult like that.
---
It's the only online game my wife plays, I want to game with her.
---
She doesn't even spend the atoms she earns, let alone buy a subscription.
---
They removed slap damage months ago bud.
---
Good luck sorting all this out, everything is a mess right now. I don’t think I’ve seen this much discontent from this subreddit before. It’s kind of sad to see everything like this.
---
Im not the only one with weapons? No shit moron. You take zero damage with pacifist you goofball. Bring it on. Im Spicytuna84 on ps4. Fucking dumbest fucken idiot Ive encountered on reddit so far.
---
Boow their house up over and over
---
Outworlds is a cheaper borderlands knockoff, that tries to feel like fallout NV but falls short. There how is that for an opinion.
---
Yea its superbly pretty lol. Probably will hold the record as the most detailed single player open world game for a while if cyberpunk 2077 doesn't beat it.
---
I think the guy who draws saladfingers probably goes to 4chan
---
Nope, 2 dog is his dad, 1 dog is his grandfather, 0 is Great Grandfather, and it keeps going down from there
---
Yes, but it didn’t change anything. It didn’t change that they profited immensely in the end. So what if people are upset anymore? There will always be dummies to pay and support garbage.
---
I get it, I wish Obsidian would get the rights to Fallout, but it’s not gonna happen. Well not anytime soon. Never know with Bethesda’s failure and Microsoft purchasing obsidian and outer worlds possible success. Well now that I think about it, years from now...
---
99$ a year ass raping.
---
Becuase I'm BuckshotEarl and I do whatever the fuck I want! There once was a man who got all the girls and that man's name was BuckshotEarl!
---
They're often at top of the world. I normally find the cargo bots and escort outside the train station.
---
 Good sport killing them mo-fo's
---
I'm confused... The picture of the guy or the screenshot of the website?
---
If the guy, it seems like a fine picture to me.
---
Oh okay, cool thank you!
---
Thats why this guy is a fucking moron. Doesn’t even know what the fuck he’s saying
---
We will EAT the rich!
---
I have actively been griefing people with fallout 1st emblems
---
Wrong. I played since Beta. This is all I play. I don't care about points. I care about people being stupid consumers and allowing businesses to get away with this BULLSHIT.  The ONLY issue I have is that someone can pay money and have better server stability. THAT..is shit. You are paying for something you should already have. You are telling me I can't have what I should already have unless I pay. This is insanity.
---
Ha
---
Hi! 
---
What's your job?
---
Are you willing to don it for free?
---
Agrees they need to go.
---
This! It would be so fun to be able to build inside towns.
---
I absolutely understand. I still haven’t finished it cause I never feel like I have the time, even when I do. I just want to appreciate the game I guess, so I give it time, so instead my dumbass would play two hours of 76 trash and be like “ok” haha and the horse riding back and forth can get tiresome but luckily there’s tons of random encounters along the paths and sooooo many camps to go bully
---
To be honest, I didn’t like NV at all. I did however, love fo4.
---
Yea, but there are alot of successful multiplayer (Even singleplayer) games that has base game purchase as well as something pass (PUBG, RDO...) fortnite is just an example in my post.
---
People are actually purchasing that membership?! SMH
---
New PC time.
---
Someone doesn't have enough goodboy points for tendies and 1st. So sad. Maybe some day you won't have to go to mommy for the money, at which point you'll probably be old enough to realize what other people spend their money on isn't any of your business.
---
Can you name a game production company, or any other company, that doesn’t want to make money?
---
That would explain the reports of private worlds not functioning properly, or already being looted. As if the survival worlds were frozen at removal and resold.
---
Also probably ties with why Wastelanders was pushed back.
---
Maybe even ties with the release of &gt;!Outer Worlds!&lt;, to compensate for an anticipated drop in sales, but that's probably coincidence.
---
War never FUCKING changes, my man.
---
I cared about the game but Fallout 1st damaged my trust in Bethesda and any future online game that they wil develop.
---
Take my upvote sir
---
Yep it worked, just gotta refund around the same day you purchase since that's what I did. Like taking candy from Todd himself
---
Using random numbers that sound real makes people think you know what you’re talking about. 40% of people know that
---
Hey, I'm also on PS4! If you need someone to play with, feel free to send me a friend request. (: 
---
Username: ToxicFluffle also I'm 26 and have a mic, but that's not a necessity if you don't want to voice chat.   
---
I'm only like level 78 right now, as I stopped playing for awhile, but I'm coming back and am looking forward to the Halloween event.
---
Juice head does not even play fallout76 because if he did he would be well over level 100 like.and yes they were definitely paid to make videos about these games by the company that made it. He was even on a plane and went to play fallout before anybody. And now the game sucks and there is no content for it. He does not play it and there nothing new to record so why should he play it especially if he does not like the game anymore. And never says how the game is truly doing with all the bugs and problems.  
---
When I login to play fallout76 and this happens only on this game not any others. I experience huge lag for 10seconds at a time. I don’t even want to play anymore because of the lag. Only thing gonna bring me back is wastelander and that’s if the dlc is good
---
Might be his ass but a lot of these posters will admit they don't even play, just came to pile on the shit show lol
---
Then report it to the mods then.
---
I've had people try to grief my camp. A player can not cause damage to my camp unless I initiate pvp with them (if i were to shoot back). I've had players launch mini  nukes at my camp and it did nothing. the only way is to launch a nuke which takes a while
---
I. Said. It. Happens. To. All. Emotes. Nothing. Else.
---
Do you like Metro Exodus? Do you agree that Far Cry is feels like a GTA knockoff? Are all these games Skyrim knockoffs?
---
Better conspiracy: Bethesda is going to sell survival mode as one of the potential mods you can enable on "private" servers.
---
Given their track record, we shouldn't expect mod support to mean community created mods but simple feature toggles for private servers, like "survival on/off", "long nights on/off", "severe weather on/off", "Todd's meaty man meat in your mouth on/on", that sort of thing.
---
 Basic supply and demand. If there is a demand for a product, someone will supply it. If the demand for an existing product drops too low to sustain that industry, the industry will shrink and potentially collapse. 
---
Look at Blockbuster Video compared to RedBox today.
---
The ones for sale in the atom store for $9.99
---
That's messed up.
---
The amount of comments I see condoning this is worrying. Nobody should be harassed *at all* they got something that you didn't agree with, you can express your disdain for their decision by silently grumbling about it, not targeting them for it. The hell happened to this community? We were targeted for liking '76 and now we're targeting each other, grow up.
---
Me too. But hey psst, we are on a fallout reddit forum, keep it secret and say it quietly.
---
OH SHIT, HERE THEY COME, RUN! 
---
ANGRY NEW VEGAS FANS!😨
---
😂 I'm just joking, keep it calm everyone, let's love each other okay... don't crucifix me pls....
---
Supporting these practices is what encourages them. First users dont think about anyone else thsn themselves so i thinks it makes sense the community that got fucked would be angry
---
And they're using broken emotes to sell Fallout 1st.
---
I'm still choppy in my private server but I am carrying over 50 3* weapons in my inventory :(
---
Lol someone called them peasants u know they did  now it's a peasant revolt.
---
Not quite. If your set to non passive they can do *ccontinous* damage and destroy your camp.
---
Nah, got the game cheap.  Grabbing trophies and aight imma outta here
---
&gt; The initial descriptions, provided by the staff at the shows, immediately told me that these were either set up to be "micro servers" or were instead just a specific session/instance created within a larger server which would actually support multiple FO76 "servers"... From my background (software development and system architecture) I saw how they could go either way and was not worried about it really. Personally the concept of using the lowest tier of cloud server made more sense since this would help prevent memory-leak issues/bugs from affecting other instances and that was an initial worry since I saw that they were essentially using the scripting engine in the game to run things and not building fresh code (.dll's and .exe's) to really handle things with proper bounds checking, memory leak prevention, error handling, etc... Okay, I am find with that, been gaming long enough to see this being the standard. Heck, I used to build such things back in the day. The problems we saw from this is that they never actually fix a lot of the underlying issues pre-existant in the game engine and now that gets used and abused by more than a single player at a time. This is the second sign of a problem
---
Random collection of words to make poster seem smart
---
A lot more people than you think
---
Yeah its a really common practice, people just end up using what works, like how the Allies in WW2 copied the V1 with the JB-2 and how the most famous Russian SMG of WW2 is just a knock off of a Finnish smg.. I would also assume that the gladiator style armor is meant to be a costume. Really glad the Riot Gear has the appropriate markings as well since its was a pre war armor.
---
Really excited for the Chinese stuff and can't wait for them to drop in the store, really hope there is a Officer's Sword skin when the pack comes out. I also really hope that down the line they add skins for the upcoming Gauss weapons in Wastelanders. A green Gauss Minigun with the Down with American Empiricism characters like the Chinese AR skin would look awesome.
---
Nope, the people that pay money to bethesda, encouraging this level of greed, are negatively affecting pretty much everyone who plays bathesda games at all in the future.
---
The people who simply kill those who reward bethesda for their shitty decisions, are only negatively affecting the **people who negatively affect people who play bethesda games.**
---
I stand corrected
---
Metro Exodus is just a Metro 2033 ripoff, the others are garbage. Again my opinion
---
This community is infinitely more creative and hilarious than Bethesda.
---
i've had people try to destroy my camp. They cant damage it unless i initiate pvp with them. Maybe i am set to passive? how can i check?
---
U misspelled trash
---
Thw what daily?
---
Why you here then?
---
Go play outer world.
---
New Age Cannibalism, lol.
---
Wait, I thought it wasn’t pay 2 win?
---
Aw, where did the griefers touch you poor child?
---
Everything I do is original! I'm the nkst original poster you have ever relied to, ask yourself is Buckshot the most original and ask everyone! Everyone will tell you I'm original and a genius! An original genius!
---
And they also said that private servers *wouldn't be* free last year, shortly after release.
---
It is ridiculously easy to platinum this game but I don't see any difference between paying for Fallout 1st and "wasting" money on buying games just to platinum them. It's something you enjoy, so you do you. Same for Fallout 1sters, maaaaan
---
Yeah in the UK we have to pay £99, even though $99 is £77, would a  VPN work?
---
Yeah, that random dude enjoying the game and therefore playing it is part of the 'problem' alright.
---
If it was a policy to always respond to any post over 100 (or any amount) of posts.  You will have trolls brigading to get their stupid “Hitler did nothing wrong“-esque ideas to the top of the page.  They can come on with a horde of fake accounts and upvote their post and add stupid comments.  It’s now on the front page of the sub (along with a bunch of other stupid ideas).  They vote down any other post into oblivion.  
---
This creates a situation in which the mods are challenged with trying to maintain the board, many people have their ideas quashed, and the devs have to basically deal with trolls.  Look at any contents with a “choose our product name” and the votes and you see the stuff that trolls get forward and how people upvote them for the “lulz”
---
it won’t do anything to get people’s ideas to not be repeated again in the future.  Good ideas that just don’t get attention will be ignored.  It creates a situation where people will complain if for some reason their idea gets missed for one reason or another. 
---
It’s a bad idea. Reddit isn’t the official forum. If they want to respond to something, great. If not, we aren’t entitled to it
---
I think it's fair to monetize a game as a service, unless you advertised it as a games as a service that would not be monetized other than the cosmetic store. It's like the canvas bag debacle again except this time they seem confident in the nylon.
---
Oh, good point, that could be what's going on.
---
WoW, at least the classic version is actually made with genuine passion, it wasn't a rushed product with maximum greed and profit in mind, we don't bash on every game we just see how amazing everything else is in comparison to the absolute garbage fire that fallout 76 is and point it out.
---
It's entertaining to see jokes like you throw cash at a company for features that should have already been a part of the base game, it's like your house is burning down but you're saying everything is alright, you're getting fucked in the ass so hard yet you don't even remotely feel it, and greedy game companies take advantage of that, and in turn people like you, affect the rest of the gaming community negatively.
---
The subscription is wrong cuz they tied in quality of life improvements that are essentially hotfixes in with the private servers. Charging for servers is fine but charging to fix inherent issues with the base game is no beuno.
---
Bethesda hates everyone equally!
---
Probably looking for a less stressful job
---
I love this
---
Oh another fallout player wining about getting targeted and killed by other players too much, go play Minecraft if you can’t handle multiplayer. That’s the number one thing that was wrong about the fallout 76 community was too many people not enjoying the rivalry and the fact that people wanna play as marauders but can’t handle simply leaving the game if they’re losing. They’re too stubborn to quit and will complain instead to the developers
---
Its not, its pay for convenience   /s
---
Bring it 🤷‍♂️ I'm not going to lose any junk 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Take mine! Someone took yours!
---
You've got to be seriously stupid to think they'd waste their budget on trying to astroturf instead of just working to make the game better.
---
Be aware of a company being greedy by the community actively ruining their time with the game?
---
That's beautiful!
---
Try $30-40. We have like a 60 % tax on them
---
I’ve seen people In Ranger armor get swarmed by people. I haven’t heard anything negative be said though
---
I don’t care; they should be, regardless of what Bethesda said. Had I not missed that statement, I would never have bought the game and would never have defended it at launch. Restricting control over private servers with no offline single player or limited multiplayer alternative effectively gates modding behind a paywall and gives Bethesda a total and complete monopoly over it. My guess is that “modding” for 76 will be limited to Creation Club content only.
---
I have a good amount of experience modding their previous games, and I have a list of mods I am going to create for a private server for my friends and I.
---

Armor Mods RE-balanced
---
Consumables Re-balanced (mostly changes to food and drink effectiveness)
---
Fast Travel fees re-balanced
---
Legendary Loot drops re-balanced (2* and 3* enemies have a much higher chance to drop 2* and 3* loot, but not 100%)
---
There are a few more but it is all mostly just re-balancing all of the shitty systems in the game to make more player friendly and less tedious bullshit.
---
But I refuse to buy into the private servers until server settings and mod support are added.
---
Settings, gameplay, should he a check item there. Granted it may also be bugged, like I can start pvp players but they cant with me because im "passive"
---
If (private)
---
     {server};

You need a YT channel! I would like and subscribe!

MAH NAAAME IS DOLEMITE!
---
Fortnite, pubg and Rdo has a huge child influx aswell hence why Fortnight right now is facing lawsutes atm because have grown so obsessed with the game and buying Vbucks its become a huge issue.
---
ESO has worse monetization and didn't affect Fallout 4 at all. They put these "predatory" practices in their online games. They feed them same as Fallout Shelter. This game won't affect future Bethesda games. Besides, you missed the point. The people **STILL PLAYING DESPITE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE SUBJECT**  are hurting their own cause to enact "change." They're not putting in feedback reports, they're not uninstalling, they're not doing anything about what they're upset about lolol
---
I have been trying to at least, since Bethesda removed any real ways too all I can do is take your workshops really tho
---
bye bye! :)
---
Different ideologies might be overthinking it a bit.
---
 I think some people just saw the atom count being awarded (which they might've bought anyway) coupled with the skin, emotes and private surver stuff and thought 'fuck it, I'll do a month - see how it goes'. Its bullshit people are being singled out for this.
---
60% of the time it works every time

Engaging with irate customers is a no-win prospect. The internet has an outrage maximum attention span of about 5 days, so expect the community managers to start posting again around the time the holiday event goes live to distract everyone.
---
You have every right to be angry, but you should probably stop making it about what they said in the past when this move *perfectly aligns* with what they said in the past.
---
Precisely why I'm playing on private worlds away from the toxic community
---
*a small part of the already small population of the game. And why would they return? Outside of your little fanboy bubble, Bethesda has lost pretty much all of its good Will and this game is a laughing stick,
---
If I enjoyed it before, why would anything change because of new content that doesn't affect my game?
---
This is just outrage signaling.
---
That's not cool it's their choice to buy it and we should respect their choice as consumers. How ever fuck beh and I would never buy it .
---
That’s why I included the two edits.
---
Lol they are doing you a favour
---
I have one but it is only for certain types of product reviews and not PC/Console game related.
---
&gt; Its pay for convenience and I like conveniences
---
Congratulations, you're a mindless cash cow
---
I'm seriously curious what games do you like besides F076? While F076 can be fun at times it's super easy and the bugs are never ending...
---
I play and played this game since the beta and paid full price only for it to drop by more then half 2 weeks after it came out and i was still fine with that, but fallout first feels like a bitch slap. Anyone saying that 99% of the people who find fallout first a bit insulting, don't play the game are a bit delusional, i say maybe about 20-30% if i be pulling numbers out of my ass and they are probably very wrong, vocal minority tend to be the most loud when it comes to supporting or opposing.
---
I'm surprised the game didn't crash while you did all that exploring. Country roads definitely took you home.
---
Or maybe they are just fans of Fallout who simply don't want to see their favourite franchise get destroyed by a greedy corporation which is apparently dead set on becoming the new EA.
---
Shotguns in Fallout 76 are primarily ornamental. Have you tried mounting it on the wall?
---
Because the announcement doesn't affect the game I've been playing until now.  I don't have to subscribe and players that do don't make any difference in my gameplay either.
---
I still think it's a skeezy move on Bethesda's part.  I hate subscriptions for games and I'd much rather have Wastelanders the season it was slated for, but that won't cause me to throw out a game that I've enjoyed playing so far.
---
It's not happening so much on PC because there are more adults
---
“Youre as stupid as i am!”
---
I'll usually find at least one person on a server selling a few but it does take some camp hopping. Check camps of high level folks for best results. Good luck!
---
You're right, but good luck getting anyone this irrational to listen to you.  They want to feel the rage, not look objectively at what was actually said.  They were never promised what they feel like they were promised.
---
There is no fix though. It is the same servers with the same bugs. Now if you are talking about the scrap box again no where in any context or quotes could I find it to be a negative practice to do this.   
---
Of interest is this :  If you cancel your membership or it expires, you’ll still be able to access any Atoms received as well as the resources stored in your Scrapbox.    
---
I am sure that will be next months issue though when people are like but I bought a month of 1st and now I can't add stuff to the scrap box, or it is also possible that they will be like I bought a 1 month got my 1650 atoms and I now own a scrapbox and it still works.

"It just works" - Todd Howard
---
Again, I've never disagreed (except in the case of outright scams and marketing practices that're either illegal or skating by on a loophole).  But the way you're willing to spend your money is against the best interests of many other consumers.  So they're annoyed by your habits, which is completely 100% fair.  Anyone who doesn't like (following the example) watered-down low-value games gets screwed when you vote for exactly that with your wallet.  In summary:
---
* It's your money, you're free to spend it how you want.
---
* Other people are still free to take umbrage when your spending habits hurt them.
---
It's a free world.  You can spend and they can talk about how you spend.
---
Red Menace and Nuka Tapper are my fav games.  I haven't really gotten a chance to play Automatron though sadly
---
You nailed this on the head.  One common argument I’ve heard, on Reddit and Facebook is that they promised free private modable servers.  But I can’t find any mention by Todd Howard or Pete Hines about it being free.  The best I saw was their QuakeCon 2018 remarks saying private servers were something they would consider.  
---
It’s like that Sinbad Genie Movie. Everyone swears they saw it, but it doesn’t exist.
---
Yes okay thank you man, I’ll try that for sure!
---
It's a great game you can get free magazines at the horizon's crashed plane on the forest region.
---
Fill one hand with sugar, and shit in the other hand. Now tell me which one you will ignore while you deal with the other. I've been playing since Beta, and while this game is better than it was, the constant lies, and greed has really killed any trust, and respect I had for Bethesda, and made me doubt that this game will ever be one of Bethesda's legendary games, unless you count how many times they have created a massive shitshow as legendary....
---
It's odd, if Fallout 76 is such a piece of shit, you would expect me to have trouble playing that. But 76 usually works fine. Outer Worlds is optimized like shit. I'm loving the game, but damn those frame drops are awful.
---
&gt; 1 post.  
---
&gt; Tries to tell me about 90% of people here don't play the game.
---
Right, guy.
---
ESO was an MMORPG and that genre has long been known to have microtransactions far before the release of that game in general, fallout 4 was a single player RPG FPS game, microtransactions and subscriptions on fallout 4 would have been wonky at best so they waited until 76 to implement that idea, since it would also fit a lot more comfortably, being more similar to an MMORPG.
---
Obviously, with the reception they got, they still failed at implementing their greedy tactics into 76 without extremely negative public reception, but fallout 4 and 76 were of different genres and different times, i for one have never played this game and after seeing the massive dump bethesda has taken on this game, i never plan to.
---
But you could be the next JuiceHead though! JuiceHead with a dash of salt...
---
I'm pretty sure actual people who play the game are mad as well. You could always avoid the sub until the news blows over. Probably be a week or so considering the attention span of most people.
---
I think the story is the best in terms of importance as well. In other games humanity is at risk, in 76 **ALL LIFE AS WE KNOW IT IS AT RISK** and the brace few of us stood up against it and held our ground facing the threat of total annihilation head on, only for history to forget what we did, becoming the greatest unsung heroes of all time
---
Lol. Fanboy bubble. You're pretty fucking clueless about me.
---
Funny thing, I see and agree with pros and cons.
---
Youre all bitterness. You're trapped in a fanhate bubble.
---
IN FACT IT DIDN'T CRASH ONCE, and I started playing the game on December so... well... [luck 15] I guess. I don't say it, the number say it.
---
But hey did you like the post :D?
---
Not sure how much it will improve -- we don't know if Bethesda is gonna put the Fallout 1st money back into the game.
---
There are A LOT of different kinds of games in this world and there are lots of people with different tastes. This game is fun for me and a lot of other people and has more gameplay depth to me than games of a similar design. I expected private worlds to be paid because Beth already said they would be through Bethesda, and private worlds on similar games through a hosting company are also paid. We take issues with some ilof the things done like the scrap box, but the rest of it allakes sense and hinders my gameplay none.
---
Just play new vegas. That's a private server, aaand had npcs lol
---
They literally built in a weight restriction in the game to make it grinder which has been a requested fix since day 1. They told us they could not due it. Now they magically have a solution for 14 dollars a month. This is a tactic ripped straight out of Korean MMOs playbook which has been universally not accepted outside of the Korean market which is why we don't get most of their games. It's pretty obvious tbh.
---
Mah man, hey give me that bro fist 👊
---
Legend
---
So Dog? as in... Snoop Dogg?
---
Lol I said I enjoy it didnt say I was good.  I just find pvp fun man it makes me laugh win or loose i don't much care.
---
Full servers and joining others... doesn’t seem like it’s dying at all...
---
I can assure you it works.

---
I hear you there. I always lose in pvp fights, but it's fun as hell!
---
You still haven't answered my direct question.
---
Bet you’d buy cat shit if someone told you it was brown gold.
---
So I assume you'll be cancelling your internet and cell plans then, right?
---
Just a heads up I heard the scrap box can delete your items
---
I wish we could see what perks some people use
---
There's nothing wrong with enjoying it. People enjoy bad things all the time. The issue is defending or supporting it. People who do that are part of the problem.
---
Well I have a couple of pinball machines 11 arcade games I spend most time on those if I am not on FO76. I sometimes torture myself and play league of legends since I self hate when I am drunk. Console wise I was having  fun with Kingdom Hearts, Resident Evil 2,  Creed on VR and battlezone. I try not to stick with one genre really since it has all been played out anyways so I try to stick to classics at the end of the day.  I played Dark souls once, then had to smoke a bowl since I snapped a PS4 controller in two. Then went on to play it for 10 more hours straight while loathing it for me breaking my red controller. And don't get me started on TVs and fighting games or sports games with friends.
---
So glad someone broke it down this way. The humbled but made my eyes bleed.
---
Yes. Peer to peer would have been ideal for 1 to 4 players. Breaks down with very many more. They screwed up in the initial design, not realizing what most fallout fans wanted.
---
👊🏻
---
Here you go, bro
---
bro 😎💪
---
It’s not my responsibility to spend my money in a manner that serves other people’s interests. Those are called ‘taxes’ and ‘donations’.  I do plenty of both. 
---
My personal spending money is mine. Anyone that takes umbrage at how I does so is a ridiculous child and needs to grow up. 
---
I do respect your point of view and the eloquent manner that you present it. Thank you for the civil discussion.
---
Are they used for anything? They are under the 'Quest' section in the craft menu but I haven't found anything?
---
No, because those are necessities in today's world. An optional video game subscription is not.
---
That's a weak argument honestly.
---
Not at all what I was saying, dude.
---
In fact, I literally am asking for someone to explain to me their opposing point of view so I can better understand it, and instead of trying to do that, you decided to just assume I'm being xenophobic in my opinion of the game.
---
&lt;applause&gt;
---
Lol, you already lost me at the first sentence.  
---
They deliberately shut down several private servers that were doing absolutely fine, just so they could release their own version to pull in more subscribers.  
---
The only reason WoW classic exists is greed.  
---
That being said, in spite of some questionable decisions by Blizzard lately, it's fine that they want to make money from it.  
---
But saying its done out of passion is absolute bullshit.
---
Well yeah because you’re some anonymous rando on Reddit. And as far as I know, you’ve done nothing of import and may very well never. So why should I have a clue about you? Your comments certainly don’t paint you as a person that I’d be dying to learn more about or even someone I’d get along with. All I have to go on are your comments and all you’ve done is uncritically shilled for a broken game’s anti-consumer business model but instead of getting paid by the devs to say nice things, you pay them and somehow still think “Hmm yeah that was a wise purchase.”
---
Not defending anything just said it's funny.  It kinda has to work to be seen so yeah when it works it's funny to me and seems others.
---
You dont have to buy it to find it funny just have to see it and enjoy the fun times
---
They never said free modable servers, in fact they outright said they’d charge. On mobile so can’t get the copy and paste of the link, but in October 2018 we knew servers would be hosted by them, always online, and paid service
---
Yea it is really weird if you place it you see that the 'hitbox' does have the hair outlined. They will probably fix it in the next patch or at least in the next decade.
---
Thats fair, I don't disagree with that. Thanks for not being the guy above you who just assumed I was being an asshole
