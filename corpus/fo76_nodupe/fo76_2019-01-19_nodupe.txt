I've had better performance with every patch.
---

---
But my network is squeeky clean and unique.
---
No more than 2 wireless devices connected and my ps4 isn't behind my router so no shitty cheap router nat to deal with.
---
I will say most of my problems revolves around whitesprings and nukes which always involves lots of players or lots of robots.
---
---
---
*Quagmire voice*  Look. I've gooified a lot of women in my day, but this game takes it to a new level... 
---
Heh heh aww right.
---
Well I missed all that probably from the flood of TSE posts. I‚Äôm sure in those trading posts there is a market for anything people don‚Äôt want to spend any ounce of time looking for. I don‚Äôt visit them. I probably should for a good chuckle. I just know what I see on the main sub and it‚Äôs all TSE most of the time.
---
I've been melee since I found my first sledge hammer. And when I needed ammo I just did munitions factory. Kinda boring waiting around for it to produce but easy and free ammo. Woot.
---
This should stickied with an "Attention Bethesda" flair on it. 100% haha.
---
Move your camp to the top of Seneca Rocks. You'll be attacked daily.
---
I usually go in with ten, come out just fine
---
Well, that's up to the devs. Personally I'd say Martial Artist needs to be split up, one perk for attack speed, one perk for weapon weight. Currently it's double-dipping, on a build that already doesn't need to carry ammo. Incisor knocked down to 55%. If heavies make do with 45%, and rifles with 36%, and shotguns and pistols get none at all, melee can do with 55% instead of 75%. Mutations can probably get tuned down also. Not sure how much, I think down to 10-15% from 25% might be a good start. They can always test it out and see how it performs in a test environment. There's also improvements for quality of life they could make that would be direct buffs. For example, I'd love to get FO76 Slugger version, where at max level you do cone damage in front of you. 
---
I have a floating camp with a floor and a staircase leading up to my actual building. I placed the floor a little high up so you have to jump. No problems. Load bearing staircases are a thing.
---
Why would you report them? You might not have liked it, but it's within the playset of the game.
---
Inside the Vault: sneak peek at the next big nerf...
---
Perhaps you got reported by someone.
---
‚ÄúThe fucks an argonian?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda like a deathclaw the size of a person.‚Äù ‚Äú....prewar people were weird.‚Äù
---
You on ps4
---
it's the same thing in fallout4, except beth fucked it up again. like the power armor station, the atom shop fireplace, and this pass through, it gets placed one floor above. when used as intented, it should reallyt work the same way as in fo4. of course oxhorn has a video about it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2hPDPRIj4
---
I'd certainly back down from a fight if you were wielding the legendary cockknife
---
Don't forget a *perfectly* maintained corvega. In red.
---
Carry on with the quest line, look at the main quest line tab and keep following the quest. You can ignore the side quests so you don't get distracted from the main quests and try get those completed until you can't and then decide what you want to do.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Make sure you doing your daily and weekly challenges each day and weekly to get free atoms. Just this will keep you super busy.
---
What if it‚Äôs made of plutonium?
---
The extra rads in the fallout universe makes it heavier!!!
---
Or you know...it‚Äôs part of the same reason lock picks were 1lbs each...stupidity 
---
I‚Äôm trying out the harpoon gun with the flechette mod. 
---
&gt; It's not TSE killing the SBQ in 15 seconds, it's stacked bobbleheads with the curator perk **exploit**.  
---
You called it an exploit yourself.
---
If anything it's borgore 
---
Excavaator is super necessary if you want to carry around 210/310 extra weight and fast travel sometimes.
---
I was thinking they make a salty perk and rank it up with TSE tears.
---
I didn't have the small purifier at like level 135 lmao... I bought the Clean version from the Atom store thinking i'd get the plan - I don't regret it though. They look nice hah
---
Never had a problem with ammo honestly ever.
---
Arseholes go everywhere homie lol. To ease your suffering, and your farming requirements, simply place your camp somewhere else, can even be in pretty much the exact same area, and all broken stuff will have been blueprinted. This allows you to just whack it back down again and all will be good with the world again. Just dont allow the actions of a few cock gobblers to affect your experience, there are a lot of ok people in the wasteland too.
---
I am level 90 and still haven't launched a nuke.
---
I would never want most of the things you listed.  Particularly the team loot and the ability to view other players info.  I'd quit and uninstall if these things ever we're I'm.
---
5lbs of duct tape to hold it all together.
---
Fuck: Fisto!
---
Marry: Fisto!
---
Kill: anyone lot Fisto!
---
XD
---
The vault was left open.... Some went back in and closed it.  Just a theory.
---
How safe is g2a, I heard it is risky buying here.
---
I don't think so, as far as I know this is automated. I'd hope that if it was a person they would actually check my inventory. If they did none of this would even happen because I certainly don't have anything outlandish. 
---
They are the ranged version of the Mr handy buzz blade.....sigh
---
Ok update I have found 5 doors but not the dome 3 door.
---
You cant even put your camps in there...
---
It and a scorchbeast regularly visit my house in the forest.  I always hide when I log in because about a fourth of the time one or the other is hanging around.  The monster hovers on the other side of my roof, about 3 stories up with a cliff on the side he is on. He turns my turrets purple.  Haven't gotten close enough to see if it turns my turrets against me. Am not a high enough level to take it on so just sign out and log back in. It's pretty interesting to see. One of these days when I  grow up I will take it on. 
---
Indeed. Hated that!
---
So because I admit I pvp I‚Äôm a bottom feeding griefer? I already admitted in this very post that I pvp. In fact if you read that comment you have linked I literally let anyone hit me first. Just because YOU haven‚Äôt had success or fun in pvp doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else is the scum of the earth. I don‚Äôt see what could be more honorable or consensual than giving the other players a chance to attack first, full damage, with extra caps on the line for killing me. I mean listen to yourself. That‚Äôs LITERALLY the best, most honorable, and most consensual offer I can give someone. I have a feeling you may be one of those people I killed...
---
I'm dling it now and I'm in US
---
Not really no.
---
What ppl might be shocked to know is up until level 35 or so unperked melee hits like a truck.
---
I lucked out and found an instigating power attack baseball bat that one shots most enemies from 35-50+.
---
My first character did run melee but it felt like a trap i got sucked into early on.
---
Have you considered cleaning up after your ass so she doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by the clutter?
---
And before this Inside the Vault, the prices of TSE weapons was dramatically decreasing while the prices and desirability of high powered melees were increasing.
---
No u. Real marure run the numbers yourself, get a two shot exploding pump and have them remove demo expert and see for yourself. This misinformation that they do 3k unbuffed is dumb and wrong as well.
---
Second time up I didn‚Äôt find any magazines or bobble heads but I did find a plan that I didn‚Äôt have. Still a win for me üòÇ also a mutated sloth or something roaming around the bottom dropped some good stuff. 
---
Even if you ain't about the cleaning up part, its hilarious watching these families cope with the fact that they have to take responsibility for their lives. There was only one episode i didn't care for but the rest was excellent entertainment. 
---
No one that has appealed has received a reply yet as far as what has been posted here and elsewhere
---
Exploit is a different word than cheat for a reason. It's currently possible, with existing game mechanics, to stack infinite bobbleheads and keep those effects running with the curator perk card indefinitely. Exploit is an unintended, but legal use of existing game mechanics. Cheat is breaking the game "rules"
---
While I find your points valid and your fixes would make the game better for me and my friends, I don‚Äôt see how reddit is the correct platform for change. I‚Äôd be willing to start a writing campaign through reddit with the support of other fo76 fans, but just this post alone wont help us much unfortunately 
---
Watch Rifle Gaming‚Äôs new video about dropping a nuke on Monongah. Lots of glowing ones with legendaries. Claims to be as good as White Springs.
---
[Video Link](https://youtu.be/z_rI3YyqtA4) 
---
I managed to get in by following somebody once - so there are three steps before you are able to get in using the handprint at the other entrance? I guess I'll just keep signing in and looking to see if anyone is nearby that entrance.
---
Bethesda did answer my ticket but they weren't especially helpful - here's what they said:
---
*Greetings,*  
---
 
---
*Thank you for contacting the Bethesda Support Team!*
---
*We appreciate your report of this incident and will hand the details off to the development team for review.*
---
***Please  be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support does not have  the ability to restore items, progress or reset quests.***
---
***To provide feedback about "Fallout 76" you can use the "Feedback" category under "Submit a Ticket" of the*** [***help website***](https://help.bethesda.net/)***.***

---
*Note: Feedback submitted through the "Feedback" category are not sent to our support team and will not receive a response.*
---
*Kind Regards,*

*Bethesda Support*
---
I did try resubmitting my message through "Feedback" instead of "In-Game Support." I also wrote the following back to them:
---
 *OK, I don't mean to be rude, but how am I supposed to get around this  problem? This isn't a single-player game and there are no saves to  restore, and if I can't redo the quest or recover the keycard, am I just  supposed to accept that I can't finish the game without restarting from  scratch and losing 70+ hours of progress? This really doesn't seem  reasonable, especially given the price of the game.*     
---
Sounds like a real healthy relationship. 
---
Because you like a bad game, don‚Äôt feel bad.. I do too. But yeah, it‚Äôs still a pile of glitches, a copy paste if fallout 4, reskinned dragons, a disgustingly poor excuse of a PvP system, barely nothing at all to do end game, no meaningful story(somewhat subjective?). That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have fun with it. But you having fun doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it was objectively bad. I guess most people can‚Äôt accept this so they just act like idiots when discussing things. Fuck common sense! This is the Internet!
---
You do not need "infinite" fusion cores or stimpacks to play solo. I've played 99% percent solo and I have two characters above level 60 without any exploits of nonsense. Go explore different parts of the Forest or Ash Heap (the two zones you've been in so far). 
---
You seem to have missed a major early quest chain for the Responders that sends you from Flatwoods to Morgantown and sets up the lore for the Scorched and other stuff. I don't see a reason to maximiize experience gains as this game is more about the journey than reaching the ending. There is very little endgame at the moment, so I would advise taking your time and exploring the map, doing events that pop up relatively near you, etc. 
---
They've basically set it up so that by the time you get to the southeast portion of the map you're doing quests for the level 40 to 50 range. Work your way slowly across the map following quests and interesting looking places, and you'll level as you go. To me, it seems like the issue is you're running past stuff in order to get to the next objective. If you do that you're missing exp from enemies along the way, missing loot and plans from locations, etc. 
---
I found both at a "Halloween themed" lookout tower.
---
&gt; This misinformation that they do 3k unbuffed
---
Nobody said that but you.
---
&gt; run the numbers yourself
---
This is your thread, it's on you to prove it.
---
Watoga. Endless robots, high chances for legendary enemies. Bots don‚Äôt have tons of xp but the sheer numbers make up for it.
---
I checked it out today. Much smaller than the Treetop version and I didn‚Äôt have a lot of luck on loot, still a very good area. I decided to build a base there just for the heck of it and see if I could build up into the treetop base. Still a bit of a work in progress. 
---
Well in that case I guess it's probably a rip. Maybe I'll appeal in a few months when the game has more content. 
---
This cringey even for a shitpost. Are you ok?
---
I had that problem when i built on the edge of the map
---
The plans or the costume?
---
No glass for you!!!
---
You can go into your pipboy and select find dropped loot under misc quest. Hope that helps. 
---
Thanks ive always felt Legendarys were pointless for pvp. They could also just make it so players do way less damage to each other. Or just cap the damage amount to like 200 to 300. Shit they could even scale the amount of dmg dealt to other players based on the weapons dmg. So many options that would be better than nerfing in my opinion. 
---
I cannot tame anything with WW. I have 50% of my budget at camp, and have tried the deathclaw mentioned in this post (crashed vertibird north of abbie's bunker.) I put my camp there, and kept server hopping and trying all the deathclaws that spawned. I have not yet seen the "tame" option. : ( Idk what I'm doing wrong. Level 89 currently. 
---
If I take radicool my hp is garbage. I die easy.
---
That's a trade off. That's not a good example.
---
How about I stead if nerfing everything you ask for consumables to work on ranged?
---
Sorry but it's fucking stupid and childish to ask for nerfs. End of story. 
---
Lol. Yeah. Seems like everyone has them. Im happy for a nerf. I found an explosive handmade.(not 2 shot) so mine is fairly earned but I will be happy when they lower the damage. It will still be a great weapon. Right now its just a little too much. I shouldnt shoot into a pack of ghouls and they all die. 
---
It was a dumb joke my friend made so he told me to post it on here lol I‚Äôm fine don‚Äôt worry, Todd definitely isn‚Äôt holding me hostage making me post positive things about the game
---
Damn. Ok, well don‚Äôt wanna get banned for entering lmao
---
The issue I'm having here is one I'll explain, I see this on every thread ranging from weapon nerfs to buffs to camp items it's hypothetical RPrs,
---
 here's the thing though when you chose to RP your limiting yourself WILLINGLY if that limit makes things harder for you and you come into the forums to complain it will do nothing but make you look stupid(because it was you who set said limitations). if they had to cater to people who claim to be Rping my level 2 should oneshot everything because I made him look like one punch man. Iether use a build of some value if you want sufficient dmg to roll endgame or don't but don't then come on the forums and whine.
---
I've only seen him north of Harper's Ferry. I guess if he's been to 63 then he does indeed travel.
---
I missing the following recipes, and from examining the game files, I believe they are not in the game:
---
* Recipe: Cramburger
---
* Recipe: Delbert's Traditional Chitlins
---
* Recipe: Cutting Fluid
---
* Recipe: Refreshing Beverage
---
* Recipe: Steeped Black Bloodleaf Tea
---
These are the ones I am missing that do appear to be in the game. Does anyone know if there is a static spawn for them?
---
* Recipe: Disease Cure (Ash Heap)
---
* Recipe: Healing Salve (Ash Heap)
---
* Recipe: Healing Salve (Cranberry Bog)
---
* Recipe: Healing Salve (Mire)
---
* Recipe: Healing Salve (Savage Divide)
---
Nah dude it's a hunting rifle that shoots .50 Arab eliminator not BMG /s
---
See, I guess I should stop using the smg 10mm because I go through so much ammo with the perfect storm weapon. 
---
Im trying to get the roaming vendor bot to spawn and i crashed like 3 times cause i didnt wait after i was able to move i was pretty salty 
---
Ah yes. A sarcastic joke.  
---
But you do realize that it implies you did not play for your weapons fairly yourself, making yourself look bad as well?
---
Down by the river.....
---
I kill all like a real American would there is no hunting law when you are the law what's that Civilian put down my gun that sounds like communism talk say allow to my 12 gauge of American freedom 
---
Where exactly?
---
Ill look into it. Whys robotics expert do to help
---
Honestly, if you have scaleosis or are generally hunched, it will help. I can't sleep on a soft matyress/couch anymore because it gives me back pain. 
---
more detail please
---
Wooosh
---
Just curious, what happened? Did he go hostile?
---
It‚Äôs not instanced to you. Lots of us just go there so you have to catch it right. You might be hitting it after someone else looted it.
---
Ok update #2 found it. But I have a new question whats in dome #2 and how do you get the key for it?
---
If you take the munitions factory put a lock on all the doors, and put doors with locks on the doorways with missing doors. Put a defense concrete wall up over the loading bay. You should be good to go.
---
I have a shotgun and can see it myself, what about you? 
---
https://imgur.com/a/WN3THJv

New Gad. Seriously. You get SO. DAMN. MANY. You'll have every mod in no time flat.
---
Couldn‚Äôt find it on mobile, I‚Äôm sure I just missed it but :(
---
Seems plausible.  Though given the rate of fire of the weapon and the fact that .308 is one of the most common ammo types, that's sort of a mixup.  You'd have to work **really** hard to actually run out of .308 rounds in this game.
---
Super cool build! Good job and thanks for sharing.
---
Not at all. Where have I suggested that they take something that doesn't overperform, and doesn't underperform, and do anything to it? Such things exist. Nothing would happen them. Which breaks your "if one then all" argument. All I said, *some* things will be nerfed. *Some* things will be buffed. Based on their performance. 
---
FO4 was a single player game. Where we had full control over literally everything, via creation kit, console commands and save file editing. This is a multiplayer game, with PvE and PvP, where we have no control. Apples and monkeys. Not even oranges, monkeys.
---
TSE is one peak. Melee is another peak. Pistols are a valley. Nerf TSE. Nerf melee. Buff pistols. Not complicated. If, after that, a new peak appears, be that VATS crit builds or bloodied laser guns, those will be dealt with as well. It wouldn't be an escalation though, just a progressive refinement of the things that need it.
---
Many of these things would also be highly situational. For example, lasers would perform well against certain enemies, not so well against others. Might not necessitate a nerf. We'll just have to wait and see. 
---
If you look at the MMO world, this is an ongoing process. WoW last month got 6 patches, with dozens of fixes, +5% here, -5% there. It's been going on for 14 years. As levels increase, as new items and new classes get added, adjustment is necessary. This is nothing new.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I, learnt how to swiiiim
---
The far left side of the map along the river. I had my outpost but I got tired of people taking my spot all the time.
---
What are you a hippie or worst a commie you get out there and blow the brains out of those little monsters don't even eat the meat leave it to rot 
---
Divison for starters, redditors complained about the grind to the point the game became some shallow version of itself.
---
&gt; Lot of people in this sub seem to think there the centre of the universe 
---
Thanks for reiterating my point. Now go ahead and comment how Division is different   from FO76.
---
Up on the mountain.....
---
Oh no, the open secret is revealed!
---
There is no mob enemy that should take more than 2 to 3 shots from maxed out endgame ranged weapons. Bosses, sure make them tanky, its expected but mobs, that's stupid. Melee users aren't at a disadvantage running into mobs if they build their character right. That's why it's such an op and easy option. And the most popular. The ranged weapons dont take skill to use, they just dont deal damage like proper melee builds can. That being said, with a maxed out guass rifle and the right perks, you can easily one shot high level mobs. 
---
Whitespring resort, constantly.
---
That junpsuit looks so damn good. 
---
Turns out it was a bladed board... :( 
---
one spot or just all around? if you got a location that would be very appreciated, I may be able to help people from taking your spot after a couple weeks
---
I have both normal and TSE shotguns, normal and TSE rifles. I can compare the damage for myself.
---
Really? That's what would make you quit? You've been cool with server crashes, dupers, and a variety of other bugs, but sharing loot with other people is where you draw the line? 
---
I want better bases, not just turrets and the basics for ghoul greed
---
Can I ask how you out locks on the doors in CAMP?
---
Unfortunately no. Even if you have a friend with the quest and do it all over again you just get standard rewards(caps, stims, ect.)
---
I saved that quest on my second character to get my friend a lvl 50 all rise
---
Found an executioners missile launcher that weighs .2. I haven‚Äôt modded it at all and don‚Äôt intend to. No more dropping missiles I picked up by accident. 
---
There were a few YouTube videos where a few guys confirmed that brick and metal walls do have more damage resistance than the wooden ones.
---
Please also put a cap on scaling on players level. Because I have seen level 999 running around. 
---
Weird question: Does my Super Duper perk work on junk bulking or am I imagining it? I thought I was so clever bulking stuff to get more...
---
No, but I have a level 50 all rise I could give you. No charge
---
Yeah I forgot mine had that big and experimentally attached a floor to the back. Welp. Guess I have an extra bit of floor now. 
---
Its so boring.
---
Alright thanks
---
I wish the weapons at work bench also showed u what u COULD mod it with so u know if a plan exists 
---
I can see your points. If somebody wants to invest in a pure melee build. Which I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd want to but I guess some people don‚Äôt like variety and that‚Äôs where they get screwed once something gets nerfed. You seem to have a more common sense approach than the mostly this-for-that posts I‚Äôve been seeing where melee needs nerfed immediately to make things equal for the TSE nerf.
---
All in all.
---
There's no reason to make the assumption that melee will be nerfed and the rest of your changes outlined aren't particularly grounded.
---
We've waited 3 games for energy weapons to be useful.
---
It's wild speculation and your initial "logical progression" is just a slippery slope to the next popular thing.
---
What?
---
Fleetwood Mac - Sweet little lies
---
For what? 600 is a lot more than most even need. You want more. Well I want more stable servers so I want less.
---
because it's an incredible game hand crafted for character building freaks and oldschool adventure gamers.
---
there is a cross section of at least 4 styles of games that have all been done quite well in classic gaming and only had slight presence as the main gameplay of modern games. I was most amazed at first by how close to the turn based action points combat system it was able to feel despite the online persistent action. this grew on me until I had absorbed the full impact of the 4 pillars its built on - Treasure hunting with a wide spectrum of challenge level, Vivid vast open exploration making the player feel small and invoking a lot of zen, building/player choice aesthetic centered (role playing needs lots of this this to qualify as role playing), and the survival mood set by darkness and the lurid hazards of what destroyed all of those that came before the player, captured only by the greatest horror and action games of all time.
---
Then you've never done a tabletop RPG or roleplayed for real then. There's two different types of roleplay. The original term of RPG typically involved role-playing from the sense of the person actually taking on the role of another character. That changed in future games particularly Japanese RPGs where they basically gave you a character to put your role into. 
---
There are plenty of opportunities in Fallout 76 to have your own role created. do you think dungeons &amp; dragons just distinctly tell people how to play their characters. No. You could absolutely still do that type of role playing in Fallout 76. It is a blank slate. And it lets you do it with people. In all of those ways it is superior because Fallout 4 was tired. I don't need plot device baby. Give me some background Lore to look into if I want to, and a game that lets me play with people who also want to actually role play. 
---
Imagination is something even older gamers had. Somehow this discussion just reminded me that I actually was able to role play with people in Halo 2 which gave you absolutely no function to do so. We would do so on custom maps and we modded are Xboxes to be able to do it. It was interesting. 
---
:/ Didn't need a game to tell us what our role was.
---
&gt;Not quite getting why the argument goes from TSE nerf straight to BURN DOWN MELEE immediately. 
---
It's the salty butthurt kids upset because their overpowered build got nerfed 
---
Don't worry, they'll grow up someday
---
Okay, here you go:

Thanks mate, but what console are you on?
---
Not sure, but I've been looking for a place to gush about the SeeBotsChat Vlad and Mia, a twitch stream from forever ago, show up as Mr. Handys talking to each other in the forest. God damn. I love that so much.
---
Actually I changed to melee at lvl 100 becaus I was sick of ammo farming.
---
Honestly I liked my sneak/vats/luck crit rifle build a hell of a lot more then I do melee. But fuck that ammo grind.
---
This is why I keep arguing against melee nerfs. I WILL go back to my rifle build one day when they do something about the ammo grind because that build did a fuck ton of damage and I got to shoot everything from safety. Everything except bosses died in 1 or 2 shots. 
---
Nope, next patch is a unilateral melee nerf
---
Mine's by the overseers camp
---
I've had zero water textures since I started playing.
---
Fucked with .ini files, changed gpu drivers, changed in-game water quality, none.
---
Everything can one shot.
---
Crouch, Black Powder VATS crit headshot with Pistol or Rifle.
---
Shotgun, same deal. Automatics too. I took down two level 70+ ultracite bounty hunters with a blank Automatic Combat Rifle I looted. 100% hit critrate for the entire clil.
---
Explosives, Fat Man to the nose.
---
PVP needs a damage cap. 
---
I haven't played warframe, but this sounds like a solid way of doing it. 
---
like 3 of the 10 servers i hopped into had small structures which is reasonable. But it started crashing after I would stay in for a second
---
It's a small place right between firehouse (the bar) and sky city (now called Garden City something...)
---
What level are you?
---
Mod plans for that weapon, yes.
---
Yeah, it's cool. I just don't get it....that enjoyment they get from destruction, you know?
---
Like when 7 year olds break a toy, and they get a kick out of it. 
---
I'd understand if there was a perk, or a benefit from destroying someone else's work, but there isn't.
---
In CAMP or Workshop, in the build menu there will be an option when you target the door. On PS4 it's L2 I think.
---
Yes you can get mods from scraping them 
---
Crit vats is very powerful. Especially in stealth w the perks.
---
I just hate the ammo grind. 
---
Stable servers would be nice. Since I want to be a trader I hold on to many good weapons for several different builds. 600 is barely enough for me but I'm glad it's good for you!!
---
My issue with Kondo is her no more than 30 books BS

It's ok. I launched  nuke (by myself) and felt all better after. ;)

Do you still have him?

Alive last, eat ass.

It's not that common any more, especially at higher levels. They nerfed the .308 drop rate pretty heavily last year. I actually run out fairly often, especially when leveling, and running into meatier enemies. I'm working on a new rifles char (lvl 42 I think?) and lvl 25-35 I was constantly short on .308, because I was constantly fighting lvl 68 enemies, because most players around are way higher level. I had to alternate between Handmade (5.56), Lever Action (.45) and Hunting (.308) to keep from running out. And if you go heavy guns (I have a heavy char in the 50s), you DEEEEEFINITELY run out of .308 lickety-split if you try using the LMG, so just don't. It's genuinely utter garbage of a gun right now.

I got the level 1 perk the other night. Essential when farming XP at Whitesprings...

So dramatic.

I‚Äôve started really enjoying the price bot. And yesterday I followed the messenger until he went to an abandoned house, and announced they were selected for Vault-Tec. Made me a little sad

I‚Äôm pretty sure they do, but I could be wrong. 
---
I‚Äôm on PC. But judging by the word ‚Äúconsole‚Äù that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre on

I think of you were able to run any faster you would outrun the load. I already have that issue with Speed Demon alone.

Yep. It‚Äôs also fun as hell.

I tried to do that, but I didn't get to it in time. I was kinda shocked when they started, cause they weren't even trying to fight me. They just stood there, and watched. I was just taken aback. But I was JUST about to switch servers, when the bombs dropped. And when I finally did log out a few seconds later, when I came back, my house was in ruins. Oh well.

Mods come in legendary boxes that have the weightless effect, so when you take the mod out of the box you lose the it xD

It basically turns enemy robots non-hostile like 75% of the time. It won't let you tame the robot to follow you, but it will leave you alone for a while.

Yep I'm on PS4, but thanks for the offer it was very generous

no worries from my end, I can hold on to it until someone else is looking. I wish I had realized earlier I get a ton of plans from workshop farming most of the time i dump them on the ground. 
---
Not sure if your missing what I'm saying or? Cause if sounds like we agree, it's easy to do good dmg with ranged damage but it shouldn't be the one shot room clear it is now
---
Anyway you could do a comparison with different levels of STR? Should be easy to spot if you lower it a single point.
---
yes
---
140x1.25 for the two shot gives 175.  Explosive is 20% off base damage so 35.  So as I understand that would give you a base damage of 210 with zero perks.

Nope
---
Well, I think it should, in my opinion. Just like there's a boxing ring. You CHOOSE not to get in it. And sure, other people can still punch you in the face outside the ring, but it's mutually understood that you are not seeking a fight or to be bothered if you're outside of it. So, I don't believe it's irrational to say that if you choose to not get in the ring, and choose to stay at home, not even go out at all...that you SHOULD expect to not be bothered. 
---
Just like if someone broke into your home and burglarized it right now, it'd be a big deal, and you'd call the cops (or worse, you'd pull out your shotgun and gun them down) Point is, it's a big deal if it were to happen. 
---
I just wish there was a way to fully avoid being bothered.
---
Somehow my all rise is now lvl 50 and started as lvl 35.  
---
I agree with your assessment!   Wait on the main quest, it‚Äôs all errands anyway.  Explore and find places your level, claim and defend workshops in low level areas, and try out events  (the gold hexes on the map) in the forest.  
---
Questing isn‚Äôt a huge deal and you don‚Äôt need to always be doing one.  In fact my alt is level 60+ and still on rose‚Äôs syringer .....

Have fun!

I'll make sure to check that out thanks

Farm for lead and steel, take the ammo crafter perk, and you'll never run out of the ammo you want. 
---
I tried the junk/lead, I placed a camp there but I didnt get the msg your camp could not be placed 5 times in a row sadly
---
It‚Äôs pretty sought after, I would definitely hold onto them and sell them
---
Huh, I just looked it up. They even added a later event to rebuild the relay (relays are like big lobby areas, you can see other players and visit NPC representatives for different factions and such). But yeah, first event was basically a fleet of giant ships were attacking those relays and as a community the players had to do enough cumulative damage to destroy them before they got into position to destroy the relay. It was interesting in that there was a real active consequence to failure (the loss of one of those lobbies). And on the wiki page it shows that a lot of relays actually got destroyed.

Customer support != developers, the developers of course would have the tools required to manage their game and players, altho customer support should have tools none the less, in this case they don't, but everyone seems to confuse this fact and think that just because customer support doesnt, then the game in unmanageable or something. And it is possible that customer support do have tools, but are requested to say they don't, we don't know their internal procedures.

We also need water purifiers that don't need to be placed in water or dirt.

Yes, also there are workshops there and if you claim while nuked the defend waves get pretty crazy!

You can have insane damage mitigation with a low health build, it's not a risk vs reward thing you speak of.

I will from now on. I have like 3 warehouse and 1 metal also, also get a lot of small letters guess those are the rarer ones.

Thanks.  Charleston FD was full, 4 lead.  How often do they respawn, 24 hrs?  Midnight?
---
LMFAO, do you need pictures or something?
---
Hold on. I have the text she sent me when I happened. I'll upload just so ya'll stop throwing a tantrum like the children you are.
---
Yep, you get no screws from "battered clipboard" only "clipboard"
---
Ah okay then you need to buy them from someone. If you are a level 20 or below, they very easily spawn at the harpers ferry vendor- above that, you won‚Äôt get them, which is very stupid. I bought my plans on PC at level 30 for 900 caps from some guy. 
---
Yes. it worked on every single thing you craft. bulked items included. I have gotten bonus bulked items. 
---
More risk than anything. I mean with low HP you‚Äôre playing risky. I would think?  Honestly don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve just heard that‚Äôs one of the ways to get this super melee damage.
---
Bobbleheads are consumables now not collectors items.
---
It is stupid lol
---
I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding of her method that leads to this conclusion. It's more about getting people to re-examine their relationship with "stuff".

okay
---
Pistol user here, only weapon I use is a western revolver. Can‚Äôt find plans and they drop somewhat rarely. Spending all my levels trying to go deeper into luck for a critical build, I feel like grim reapers sprint needs a buff, when you run out of AP your options suck. Run away and don‚Äôt let your ap regen, or hold still and let things rush you while reloading or aiming manually. I can do decent plugs of damage to big bosses... if vats would work all the time, missing a hit with a non 2 shot gun that says it has a 95% hit chance and I can see the target is not obstructed several times in a row feels so bad. Pistols are my favorite but I want to play something else bc it feels so bad sometimes. Not to mention there are more perks needed for a pistol build then you can even fit in agility and only one other perk outside of it. 
---
I also had horrendous disconnects and crashes after load last night on XB1
---
Yes, but the process of getting them is a little longer. 
---
I go where I want! I camp where I camp!
---
I‚Äôm a Man‚Äôs Man! *thumps chest*

I‚Äôll be lucky to break even lol.
---
If you choose shotguns as secondaries i suggest enforcer (agi), at least one level. Crippling is a great mechanic, it slows down ghouls and crippling mutants legs and arms can render them absolutely defenseless. Overall a must have shotgun perk
---
Yea you'll have to buy them from someone. The going rate is around 1000c.
---
I have the same problem. I suspect it's from playing in the beta. Challenges might have been reset without resetting the flags for discovering locations. Also the challenges for killing some enemies are bugged for me, like yoa guay.
---
We purge regularly, and we're both neat freaks, so there isn't much to organize at all.

Ima tinker and I‚Äôll sell you all the 5.56 you need.

I dig it so hard

You haven't tried to build a brick house yet by only needing 50 concrete. However that's only time I ever really used it.
---
Yup. Been in the game since beta day 1.
---
Had the same problem. Came to the same conclusion.
---
Somehow that has made my game so much worse and it is literally unplayable. That is not an exaggeration. I can't even join a server now.
---
I 100% just blasted through 2 of them at full health in XB1. Not sure if it‚Äôs bc if the new update or what.
---
[removed]
---
Not necessarily. Low HP can be tankier than regular.
---
The easiest is the Power Armor melee variant. You take power armor, and slap Emergency Protocols on the chestpiece. This cuts all incoming damage by 50%. Then toss in Blocker against melee, 45% reduction. Dodgy from Agility for 30% reduction. You might consider Suppressor if you feel you need it, I personally didn't feel the need for it. Between the obscene DR on full PA suit, and Emergency Protocols, your health is pretty much not moving any more. Throw in additional DR from Nerd Rage, and it's just gravy.
---
The no-PA is a little more grizzly. Serendipity is 45% chance to dodge ALL damage. A swing is coming, and it does 100 damage. You have basically a coinflip chance to completely avoid it. Where with Emergency Protocols you'd take 50 damage, with Serendipity you take 0 or 100. So you  have to be a bit more careful. The rest still applies. If you are low-HP melee, go Barbarian, Evasive, Dodgy, again possible Suppressor for long fights against hard-hitting enemies. This build is slightly more flexible, because armor is a big wild card. You can take the set that increases DR the lower your HP gets, and be tanky as fuck. or you can take the one that increases all stats by up to 3 (except Endurance) and 1-shot everything, and have infinite AP and crits (you'd be sitting at 20+ on all stats but Endurance). Heck, you can run around naked, or in a Hazmat suit with this build, and do fine. Mutations, of course (Scaly Skin, Grounded). 
---
With PA variant of low-HP, my health doesn't really move any more when I fight. With the Naked Mole Rat (I use the mole rat glove) build it's a bit hairier, but still quite stable.
---
You really shouldn't die with either one, if built properly. Too many people skip out on Blocker and Dodgy and Lone Wanderer. Just between those 3 you barely take damage from most sources.
---
The reason I don't ask for ranged buffs (actually I do, but that's beside the point) is power creep. If A overperforms, buffing everything up to A's level is NOT a good idea. Because it'll make the game far too easy. Not to mention it's a lot of work to bring B-Z up to A's level, you need to change 26 things. If you nerf A, you have to change 1 thing. Which do you think is easier? That's why the nerfs. But also buffs. Peaks and valleys. Sand down the peaks, fill in (buff) the valleys. Nerf TSE, buff pistols. That sort of thing.
---
There's nothing childish about asking for balance. And nerfs when it is sensible. 
---
Because it's another Vault Tec experiment. Get a bunch of sociopaths together, call them the "best and the brightest" to give them big heads, then send them out unsupervised into the world and see what they do. 
---
I remember getting a bunch of hunting rifles to scrap after being mobbed by a bunch of low level scorched when I used to hit up that traincar area up toward morgantown train station for the power armor there. The collison course event at morgantown airport also tends to net a lot of low level hunting rifles from the waves of mobs that trigger for the event as well as a bunch of medical boxes to hit up in that nearby area. (I used to set up my camp east of there, and the event would trigger every time I snuck in through the eastern fence)

Ammosmith and super duper.  It does take a bit of farming for junk but I have lead marked so its not too bad.

How dare you, Green Thumb is indispensable. Between sugar farming for those sweet stews and farming adhesive at home no other perk comes close to such a general QoL improvement (save for maybe Lead Belly).
---
I'll updoot you regardless. 
---
Oh, take your upvote and leave me alone with my 3845 pounds of crap.  Bethesda won't allow me to join some servers because of my encumbrance, apparently.  I just want a stash large enough to store my shit (which is a lot, to be fair, but who conditioned me over a period of decades to hoard everything, eh?  I'll wait for your answer), and then I'll happily run merrily around slaughtering in my patented ultralite ballistic armour underwear.
---
But the game that this is makes the central point about encumbrance and inventory control.  I work hard.  I do not have an easy job.  6 days ago someone tried to kill me, up close and personal.  Again.  I live alone, I have extremely few people that I hang out with, and most days when I get home I just want to kill ghouls, super mutants, scorched, whatever, and take their stuff for an hour or 2 to process what happened that day.
---
But inventory management?  Being kicked from servers because I'm encumbered?  Yeah, that's shitty.  Let me play the way I want to.  If my running around encumbered is a problem, then give me a bigger stash so I can put some of this stuff down.  All my friends have rage-quit the game, and they're pissed at me for having recommended it after I was in the beta.  Hell, I am sincerely thinking about quitting myself, and I have been a huge Bethesda fan for decades.
---
After probably the 6th visit mine finally stopped attacking. 
---
I don't know, with my TSE Lever Action I pretty much one-shot everyone.
---
This is why we need to be able to add our system to our flairs :P
---
I literally made this post a month ago
---
serendipity and dodgy along make you pretty much tank anything, then you have nerd rage among others. If you can afford sentinel you become immortal. I play a low health melee build and I know it's overpowered, range needs a buff of some kind.  
---
Are you ok why are you this far into the subreddit

You could use the mod from nexus. I use it and can quick switch between different builds. I have traveling, shotgun, AR auto, heavy gunner, melee, nuke whitesprings PA, nuke whitesprings no PA. You can save up to 8.

They kill everything but the queen in one hit.   If you think that is not OP, I don‚Äôt know how much more powerful something needs to be for you to consider it OP.
---
Yeah, of the various survival perks, green thumb is the only one I still use at all.  Lead belly and cannibal are good, but I left them behind a while ago.
---
It's getting nerfed. You lost. Move on.
---
The random encounter spawns a corpse of a trick or treater.. I've gotten two plans from that. 
---
So somehow my game is literally unplayable now. I was just in a game when I was disconnected randomly and I had tried to rejoin a friend but it keeps putting me on the same EXACT  server I was on a play session before same people and everything. It's a different server than him so when in a team it says like we aren't even in the same server and can't communicate. And since the shitty Bethesda launcher doesn't have any way of communicating aside from in-game voice chat I can't tell him what's going on. And now I can't even join a server without disconnecting before I have finished loading in. Great job Bethesda, I give you my money for a game I actually can't play. Probably wouldn't have this issue if this shit had a single player.
---
I‚Äôm almost certain this is the only location you can find him
---
yep - gonna get farmed now. We need private servers. 
---
Eh...that'd potentially skirt copyright infringement when coupled with the mole miner gauntlet with extra blades.
---
but yeah, they could do a lot more with mutations, and I hope they do expand it over time, or at least give us custom servers with full modability for doing so
---

I've given random outfits away in an odd way twice now involving cannibal for people just starting to add some "flavor" to their gameplay.

---
So. See a new player in the vault? Clearly taking their time with it so they're new? Go near Flatwoods and drop a Government Supply Requisition. There's a bug (or feature?) right now where only the requisition owner can loot it, making anyone else poking around Wanted for 5 caps.
---
Most of the points are within early game natural sight lines. They're going to see it and innocently walk up and give it a look. Can make a level 2 wanted even though pvp starts at 5. Hack them up and be entertaining, not mean with it. Don't want to ruin their time. I get weird on the mic personally, hah. Eat them. Leave extra items in their bag left behind or drop your own. Run away. 
---
They never talk back as I'm sure most new people don't have their mics set up quite yet. They get some extra BoS tech data outfits early along with whatever else. 
---
So then melee shoukdnt be able to do it either its op. Will be the next nerf
---
Absolutely üëå
---
I call bullshit
---
My friends and I love taking it also. We do the exact same thing we walk it off put up turrets and then build a house full decorated. We always have fun at that workshop.
---
Junk+lead node in Toxic Valley
---
South of Top of the World (theres a lot of water, a junk node, an acid node, a brahmin spawning location, a waterfall...centrally located too). There are some camps along the railroad leading north from TotW as well, think there are a couple nodes.
---
Everywhere in that big chunk of land between Sutton and Morgantown
---
Along the western-most river, north half usually. Lots of nodes along there, also close to the workshop by Flatwoods or Deathclaw Island
---
Around the Whitesprings golfing course
---
Even high level players will camp out in these low level areas. Not much reason not to...it has what you need.
---
yeah bruh most the ppl i encounter are mad cool..once someone punched my character and i just walked away lol
---
Not really any bad ones these days, alot of times people will invite randoms to teams and just chat it up. I think all the angry greifer type people are starting to leave. Can hope anyway. 
---
What levels can you get those at? I'm at 28
---
Why not take both
---
Thanks my mans
---
I just made a that build. I die all the dam time. I'm talking NO PA. I don't have the armor that increases stats at low health.
---
Thinking everyone has it because - and I'm not saying this is you - someone saw a YouTube vid of some dude rocking a deathclaw gauntlet w perfect armor and on a team that let him get full stacks of adrenaline and that other perk that ups your damage when you die twice isn't something 95% of melee players can do.
---
So I don't proc all that lovely stuff you mentioned and I'm sure most people don't either. If you are going to nerf anything you nerf the insane stacking melee gets. Or, as I would prefer give ranged some stacking perks.
---
Just "nerf melee" would completely kill it for a huge portion of the player base that can't have perfect conditions or perfect armor.
---
It's crying and honestly it sounds like you might think you can just go melee and achieve high damage numbers. Let me tell you this. My average damage for my pole hook is about 368 damage. It's instigating and not bloodied.
---
See? I dont have a bloodied weapon nor any of the armor you mentioned. So nerf me? That's stupid. 
---
...we'll see? I mean, there were people who thought TSEs wouldn't get nerfed too. But now we know. It'll be the same with melee. 
---
Previous games, once again, are not really relevant. Apples and monkeys, remember? Single player vs multiplayer, PvE vs PvP?
---
All else aside, do you honestly think that melee will be allowed to run around, 1-shotting pretty much anything except SBQ? Call me crazy, but I just don't see it. Frankly, I'm amazed it lasted this long.
---
Electrically charged mutation means Mole rats can be killed with no effort.
---
Hmm....maybe have him have a more human flesh color to denote he's not aaaas mutated (he's still a super mutie, but he retained his inteligence....mostly)
---
Oh god, if any one's been to watoga, there's this one shop where they were reselling second hand appliances, wouldn't it be a hoot, if Grahm was the original owner of that place and they added a quest to bring him something from that store?
---
alright I'll look for those, thanks
---
Bethesda did say they realized people want it so I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get it eventually.  Poor console people need it too.  I‚Äôm PC and have the mod and it‚Äôs a delight.  That and better inventory sorting and now the plan one all need added to base game ASAP

I know there's a post somewhere in here that categorized what all the plans contain with pictures. Someone will probably post it. But you could probably Google it if you wanted

Hope they do! I switched to pc last year and will never go back to console haha

I have no proof but I believe the random encounter of the dead responder who drops cramburgers has a small chance of dropping the recipe.

Agreed, I will definetly do so. I was just scrolling and it popped into my head. 
---
Higher damage numbers than pretty much anything but a fatman, not sure why you don't think these numbers aren't OP even at base stats. Wish my guns hit that hard with no perks lmao but then again it would kill any difficulty in the game when you can one shot almost anything expect for the boss type enemies.
---
What? Wasteland was the inspiration for fallout? Aside from being post apocalyptic I don't see how.  No vaults, ghouls, super mutants just raiders and robots, feral dogs. Don't remember much else... snake Vargas was a starting character.

What if people started trading by using explosive vent plans as currency because there's a cap limit but no limit on how many explosive vent plans you can hold.
---
Shit nevermind the plans have weight so we can't hoard them.
---
I've got some problems with the perk card system, but I don't mind that part. You're still restricted by your SPECIAL and the fact you actually have to collect the perk cards. The lack of any mechanics for swapping out perk loadouts says to me that Bethesda intended players to mostly keep the same perks equipped, and just swap around a few flex spots. That and the prohibitively slow respec option they added means you can't just swap to a completely different build on the fly. 
---
I think it's a neat way to add an "effective" level cap at 50, while still allowing players to level up and collect cards. Plus it's well-built for them to add additional perk cards in the future.
---
You type up a paragraph to my few sentences then try to act edgy at the end? Cute.
---
Maybe you should try taking that advice of yours and chilling out, 'cause "I don't know who hurt you lol" but raging at me to feel better ain't going to fix that.

Melee needs to be in your face when it comes to dealing damage, right now PA absorbs way too much damage so it's currently easy mode for them. If they were without PA you would see them dying alot more than they currently are.
---
Some people are looking to increase their bounty to instigate pvp, but some people are just looking to set the work on fire. 
---
In the future if this happens don't waste your mats repairing. Move your camp slightly then place everything from storage. It will be fully repaired. You'll have to pay some caps but save on the materials. 
---
Since we were all residents, it would be cool if we could unlock our rooms again and make those our vendor stalls, and customize them like a mini-CAMP, and if they are unit based, it could be placed in one of 24 slots, instead of a specific apartment.
---
I love these suggestions.  üòÅ
---
Melee does need a nerf they have less upkeep than guns but more value so long as they're tanky enough to get near. In a Pve focused game, that distance means nothing. The only enemy that causes melee problems is SBQ. Hell the meta from the nuke zones I've done is cripple its wing so it lands so the melee players can decimate her.

It gives me the notification, but the yellow diamond indicator doesn't show up so it is hard to see where it is, sometimes I wonder if A) someone else grabbed it or 2) it disappears. I have gone into the pipboy and turned the notification off and back on but nothing happens. The most recent time this happened today and I was killed by a Scorched beast and when I went to collect it(it had the notification) the scorched beast landed right on me before I could collect the dropped items and killed me again, this time it showed retrieve your dropped items notification but there was no indication where it was, I looked but nothing. It doesn't always bother me but sometimes I was grinding for springs and screws. I usually drop them off at my camp or a train station but I was far away from both.
---
I know I was trying to be funny
---
Damn, that's a god roll and a half!
---
Yea. He did know the regular nukas existed until today. All my grenade types do more damage. Trying to figure out the cause. 
---
Thank you, I have been just thinking i would broaden my searches \^.\^ 
---
People needing to log off and back on to get respawns is a fault in the game design. They should just keep respawning on a fairly short respawn timer by design. Like maybe a minute after they have been cleared.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it is set time. I was server hopping and got caught up in an event and then stayed on a server and they respawned in a couple hours. 
---
When you log out of a camp, all the stuff gets stored, I took bog town and just built turrets, logged out and in my camp were all the workstations and resource pumps... I was trying to plant crops at my camp and it wouldn‚Äôt let me saying I was over budget, I wasn‚Äôt over budget before.
---
Its not a fallout game though right?
---
No making alts for new builds or anything like that
---
Thanks for the information! Sounds good 
---
Okay, I admit it.  I made that up.  I was feeling snarky.  But now I think maybe you aren't a native English speaker, so I feel kind of bad for misleading you.  The truth is that PSA stands for Public Service Announcement.  It's like saying "Hey everybody, this is a thing you should know."  I'm not lying this time.  (really)
---
Didn't see the grandfather clock, I definetly regret not getting it now. Thank you for the link, I did see alot of things I now want and the locker description was great. 
---
I did sorry I didn't notice the "shotgun" part. I see it now thanks.
---
I love it! Thank you for following up!!  :)
---
Yeah I have a open community area and a locked area where I AFK to grab a bite and I found out because a friend jumped through and decided to kill me for fun....i had no idea üòø
---
You can pretty make a kind of weapon one shot/quick burst kill in this game. "tse" is just a trigger to some people I guess. Yes it requires minimal perks to get to good dmg but it's also meant to be rare as hell. I would like to see any ranged weapon even come close to the dmg of a well built melee after patch.
---
That's kinda part of the problem. Whenever the nerf is announced, everyone shifts gears. Even if the nerf isn't actually all that horrible. I mean, yes, 75% for TS and 75% for Explosive looks bad. But it's still a TSE weapon. You spend less ammo, you do more damage. Damage is still explosive (AoE), and still doesn't suffer from range falloff. So the TSE gun, compared to a base weapon, isn't even that bad, especially on explosive build. And especially now that you don't KO yourself with a single blast, with the new Fireproof perk. 
---
BUT when nerf is announced, people are going to scramble and start changing their build. Change it to what? Next best thing. Which is currently melee. If Bethesda is going to nerf melee, which is likely, they had better nerf it immediately to make the next-next-best-thing not quite so clear. Because if they wait, and let all the former-TSE users respec to melee, and THEN nerf it, it's adding insult to injury. I'd rather the got the massive nerfs out of the way in one go, like ripping off a bandage.
---
This is actually one of the mistakes the devs in Elder Scrolls Online keep making. They take a sledgehammer to the game's balance once a year, with a few tweaks every quarter. Problem is, it REALLY pisses people off! They add some new armor sets, people spend months getting them, improving them to legendary level, at exorbitant cost, which takes say 6 months. And 6 months later, devs take a sledgehammer and fuck that shit up. So you wasted 6 months, and now you have a set of gear that is completely worthless. Rinse, repeat. Many players survive this happening once, and the likelihood this happens to your exact spec every year is pretty low. But getting double or triple-whammied like this is a big problem. A lot of people quit from this. It's too soul crushing to come up with a build, spend time and effort gearing for it and farming for it and learning to play it properly and then BOOP, it's gone! It doesn't work no more. 
---
So I'd actually be very in favour of immediate nerfs to the worst offenders, whatever those may be. Melee is the obvious one. But after that, it becomes a little unclear which one they will target next, currently TSEs just obfuscate the rest of issues.
---
And look, maybe melee won't  get nerfed. I think all signs point to yes, but if the lead dev gets a supermegaboner for melee, it could stay unbalanced. God knows we've seen that happen enough times. 
---
Considering I had 80hrs in the game before I was level 50 just because I spent all my time exploring the world, learning the stories in various places, instead of chasing quests....I think this entire thought process you have on it is...bad
---
Different people will experience a game in different ways, you don't like it, okay, but who gave you the right to say 'because arbitrary reason x, your opinion/view don't mater/count'.  Like I could understand if some one said they'd never played the game and were stating their opinions on something they've only experienced Vicariously, but no, this whole 'gotta b x level to have a valid thought' is moronic, at best.  Enjoyment of something, isn't determined by your level in a game, but how you personally experience the game.
---
Charleston vendor bot sells. Nuka cola clock, cuckoo clock.
---
Whitespring sells. Gilded clock (Asian style 1), elegant clock (white winged clock) and I think antique clock? (Not sure what that is)
---
If there are others missing im sure it would just be a wall clocks plan from responder vendors or workshop events
---
PA needs nerfed more than melee. 
---
Grahm just hates you. 
---
Which section of the place is that at in WS?
---
Okay I‚Äôm done lmfao. That was funny 
---
That's super interesting! I would guess anti-armor effects would follow the same formula? You start with the lowest percentage perk and work your way up, correct? I'm working on an anti-armour build.
---
Thanks so much for this, definitely helps a lot!
---
Overdrive allows for crits out of vats, at least that's what I saw on YouTube. Heh.
---
&gt;but you're making it seem like Fallout 4 was balanced,
---
Neither the comment you're responding to, nor the parent comment even mention fallout 4.
---
That, and the point was that speccing into melee strictly outclasses ranged builds without TSE. That's even keeping in mind the potential of taking damage while being in melee range, and while melee *should* absolutely be viable, it's right now superior to any ranged build that doesn't include specific weapon prefixes. That's no longer just incentivizing melee; it's just imbalance
---
You might be right. I am level 30 and have no problem. It‚Äôs still fun for me. I see the bugs/problems but I can ignore them because I still have new places to see and quests to fulfill.
---
^great info I‚Äôm gong to try this soon 
---
Where dis bitch be?
---
Ammosmith is level 34 in Agility. Super Duper is level 50 in Luck.

Studio 58 ,the one yellow room at the end of the hallway

Everyones opinion matters, anyone who has played the game to level 10 or level 250 has valid input.

TWO workshops? Who am I, Bob Vila?

Max endurance player HP is 325, having 400 vs 600 vs a million damage is irrelevant.

lol not trying to be edgy or raging man, you really think trying to reverse what i called you out for on me makes you look intelligent or correct? It makes you looks unintelligent and shows further immaturity, and that you dont know how to respond to being called out. If you dont want to be called out dont be toxic, pretty simple.
---
My intentions are to call someone out for being toxic, and we dont need toxic people (like you clearly) in this community. 
---
Ohhhhh, yes sir I am. Why? You should add me. Username: Navybluepaint
---
The apples and monkeys thing is cute again, but consider for a moment why that's interesting.... It got nerfed in a single player game. Think really hard about what makes that very special. Does it click? Single player PVE. That's very special, right? Does pointing it out again make it even more obvious of the extent of why "round 2 - let's do the same thing in multiplayer" is even more nonsensical than your analogy? It was inevitable and a repeated mistake. Energy weapons.... Well, historically, no one gives a damn.
---
People go great lengths to claim how disadvantaged melee is. We'll see. Right off the cuff, with the exlusion of the _recent_ Fireproof change, there are a lot more options to defend against melee from stagger reduction to damage reflection. Just look through the perks and power armor mods - the anti-explosive paint is missing, but the plates work.
---
Super legit, there's definitely some mods on it.

-Xbox One S

-Trap Daddy C

-When first loading into the world if I try to open my pip-boy before all the assets around me have loaded in, it freezes my character in place and makes it to where I am unable to move him. Even if I fast travel after this occurs, it still loads your character into the desired location in a bugged state.
---
Thanks bruhv
---
I 100% agree but the 50cal also works best on critical hit builds as it's main property is increased critical dmg
---
Neither. Marsupial, twisted muscles, and healing factor. He has no mutations. 
---
The only things it should reduce are rate of fire and magazine size.
---
Awesome, I'm actually interested to see the area nuked
---
I'm level 12 and what is this
---
That's cool.  I wish they'd do this with more zones.
---
Fun one was coming across a Scorched Megasloth and 2-3 Scorched Yao Guai. 2 dead baby sloths on the ground further away. 
---
All together... meaning Scorched altogether? So mama sloth fighting off bears gets dusted with all of them, then comes over and kills its kids?
---
Oh cool, was just server hopping at this spot looking for a new base pet. Just gonna go find a new activity...
---
Black Blood Leaf Tea may be the Steeped Bloodleaf Tea perhaps? 
---
 Refreshing Beverage has the 'cut' tag
---
Detox Items are pointless as the Tasty Radscorp Egg Omlette removes all addictions (regular removes 1 random addiction)
---
Cramburger is the Bunless Cramburger, I have the recipee and have made it, once
---
Jet wouldn't be doable with how it worked in 4 as you can't slow a multiplayer game so....
---
And not sure on the Chitlins, but if the first vault to open is the 'missionary' vault that Delbert is from that could be a new recipe that's inside it.
---
The aditional healing Salve/disease cure options would be nice....if they made larger batches, as it stands the savage divide disease cure is more expensive to make than the forest version with no real benefit.
---
The way I fixed it was to replace the piece it was connected to.
---
Edit mode -&gt; select the floor piece or whatever, push "T" for replace to swap it to a new type (if floor, go to concrete for example). Then I was finally able to delete the dumb wall that was keeping the floor anchored.
---
Would be nice. Also would be nice to know where to get it. We're somehow supposed to magically know that Handmade (which is usable at lvl 15) plans appear in Watoga. They started so well with cooking recipes - they spawn in kitchens, makes sense. Wish they expanded that to other things. Like energy weapons plans in research centers. Ballistic plans near armouries or other weapon storage. Medicine recipes near hospitals and trauma centers, etc. 
---
My first build that I got to 100 was pure melee ( had to get a gun for scorchbeasts &amp; cargo drones sadly).
---
My second and current build now level 50 is sneaky pistol build.
---
If I keep interested I will probably try pure explosive build next.
---
That's good to hear you got a chuckle from it buddeh
---
Both of you should take off all your perks then compare
---
We tried that lol
---
I'm not sure if this is the issue but if you have marsupial and die in the air the loot bag floats, on another note it does let you know if someone grabs it and the quest dissapears from your hud after that. Not sure if either of those are the issue because it could just be a bug. I understand completely about the grinding, I've accidentally forgot to drop my stuff In a stash and walked into a nuke zone only to realize I have no radaway. After the last update if I kill myself over and over the radiation doesn't reset so I lose a pile of junk. Most recently it was 157 steel. Steel is easy to come by but that's alot of ammo in my eyes. 
---
Agree 100%
---
But does it cause the mole rat‚Äôs head to explode with a satisfying sound?!
---
I'm running an armed build with only 3 legendaries. 1 of which is an assassin piece. Overall I sit at about 280 ballistic and 198 energy. Sometimes I'll get one shotted, but generally I can take two or three hits before I go down. Now that fireproof is a thing I can take an additional shot. This is against people in the 150-250 level range. So they aren't noobs.
---
I'm not sure how everyone is going down in 1 shot every battle. Am I just lucky to find running non optimized builds, or is there some exaggeration going on? 
---
Not calling you out. I just hear this story a lot. What kind of defense perks are you running? 
---
Glassed caverns is also a great spot to level at 14 :)
---
Thought they patched that exploit 
---
not very clear, seems like a leading question looking for an answer
---
Thanks for the info! and as I just learned, StingWing meat is +2str as well!
---
I made a Deathclaw wellington or two, but the eggs are a bit hard to get. If I sat down and properly farmed the cave with all the nests in it I could probably have enough since they dont perish, though.
---
(I kinda have a dumb idea for when marking your camps comes out, long story short it's a restaurant called the 'melee buffet', so this is super helpful)
---
I found a two shot one of those, was so excited and went thru 1000 ammo on a molerat my aim wasn‚Äôt good.
---
Interesting, if only I could remember to equip ammosmith each time I craft bullets.
---
What endgame? You fight the queen once and that is the end of the game. If you already have a TSE shotgun there is no chance the queen is going to drop a better weapon or something. 
---
Well if you buy it now. It can be bought with around $12 I believe. Since it‚Äôs cloud and no district restrictions, some place is really cost effective to buy this game from.  I
---
I didn't play in the beta, though. That's why I'm a little confused :P
---
It's because you called him Graham
---
I think that may have been he first workshop I ever took
---
Not AFAIK. 
---
can we can an update my dude?
---
being able to goal  kick the little 
---
shits as well 
---
I've crashed every time I try to play on ps4 since last patch. Only able to log in for about 10 minutes and then hard crash. Tried rebuilding database and fresh install and neither has fixed it.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah I had a Randi invite to team and we took a workshop I went to his place was chill then he warped to mine hung for like 2mins then he kicked me from party and started blowing my house up had a 300^ bounty and blocked me and left server... with contractor 2* mats p fix everything was minimal but the feels.
---
I'd love events that involve adding songs to the radio, or opening up another radio station. Finding tracks or unlocking artists or something would be super. Maybe we find evidence of a secret radio DJ.
---
Was thinkin nahhhh big dreams, until you mentioned cleaning up the shell. How great would it be to chrome some shit out. If we ever get robot stuff turned on, they would add paints in eventually I'm sure. Why not trick out our living pets too? Add crabs to the tame pool and look through the model library for ideas for shell mods.
---
Could be sweet.
---
Also a tuxedo for a friendly deathclaw but we don't needa start talking about that till everyones ready
---
Fellow pistol build here. Also only use revolvers and high luck. With grim reaper sprint the trick is to do lots of killing adds/trash mobs i like a single rank in gun by and 5 in adrenaline to go along with the damage perks in agility, keeps the damage output high enough to one shot most non boss enemies whick keeps your AP up. Also the western is in my opinion the best pistol in the game for damage output even without legendary effects.
---
The Whitesprings/Fissure grind was never worth doing more than a few times unless your sole desire in the game is to get the perfect TSE weapon. The end-game was poorly designed but much of the game world is quite engaging and fun to explore. I‚Äôve been slow rolling my game mostly solo and I‚Äôm only level 52 after over 100 hours. 
---
It‚Äôs fun to experiment with camp builds and workshop extractors that compliment your current goals in the game. Some days I concentrate on stocking food and junk and other days I concentrate on ore and acid to smelt for selling. I quest during the down time but most of my time is spent just trying to eke out a living in this harsh environment. It‚Äôs an oddly satisfying experience. Now if I could just convince a few friends to jump in the game it would be even better. 
---
Did u call his Brahman a fat cow?
---
The spoiler in an earlier post I had in this thread denotes where they originate from but it's marked with a spoiler so people can discover it for themselves if they want
---
First, could you provide a source for the FO4 explosive nerf? I honestly don't remember it.
---
Second, what is the "stagger reduction" you are referring to with melee? And if you search through my post history for "Blocker", you'll see I refer to it all the time, how melee has to deal with it, and there's no equivalent for melee players to use against ranged. Not that it's in any way relevant anyway, because it's not an argument against melee doing too much damage too easily. 
---
Someone's been watching the new Punisher season on Netflix, it seems 
---
A garden plot box (like the ones we see in flatwoods) would be kind of nice to set up an indoor garden or rooftop garden. I think they had something like that in FO4. An idea for the atom shop is glass walls so that we can set up greenhouses (like at the vaulttec agriculture center) for this purpose.
---
I know once trick reportedly used was to place a small outside ground campfires down which register as dirt that I've seen some youtubers place water purifiers or plants on. (I don't know if this has been patched yet)
---
Mine started out at 50 gb then i paused it and it went to the right size
---
That was the only attack that relieved ANY of the stress in that game. God damn was it surprisingly powerful when shit was all up in your business
---
How then would you handle new players who are leaving the vault on the same server...
---
True, the materials are pretty easy to get since I passed level 50 and have good power armor and weapons , but it is annoying. I still get the notification to pick up my dropped loot. It doesn't happen often, probably a glitch. Sometimes it is disappointing.
---
I don't much really give a crap about the two shot nerf... but I do echo a somewhat common complaint: there is not enough viable weapon builds. 
---
It is a problem when there is but one single end-game place to be. That is a failure of game design that we can't have a nice diverse landscape of build options so that many different gun types or melee types can ascend to powerful, SBQ killing status. 
---
Game design is forcing min-max behavior.
---
So if you chose to sit at level 1 and collect tin cans the game is good because you enjoy it? You are the people I'm talking about.
---
As mentioned, it's probably the divide between developers and support, as well as a bunch of that red tape between the two.
---
I agree to an extent though, not having character / item recovery tools (ones the public was explicityly aware of) for live play was shortsighted. 
---
Thanks Champ!
---
They are still going to drop
---
Im level 90 and still love the game. Ur post is not valid
---
I‚Äôm thinking of nuking watoga high school,  the ghouls respawn  really really fast, I just think a lot of people would assume I missed prime. 
---
That would be really obstructive of the player's view
---
u're welcome !
---
Sounds like dork logic to me. I have 14 explosive vent plans. Yes I keep them as trophies 
---
Haha what a tool.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
This is nothing new. I‚Äôve seen people nuke the town and have nuked it myself for the last month or so. 
---
How hard is it to go look at the official post to confirm what that person said?
---
Whatever dude, lvl 33 here, my wife is level 15 sorry not sorry us having fun frightens you, I can say it's a pretty decent game considering I've logged hundreds and hundreds of hours with FNV, FO3, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skryim and FO4. And I mean hundreds of each game not across the board, so stuff it dude, if you've explored the map inch by inch and completed every single mission possible do you really have a right to complain?  Maybe you need to go outside more, go bike riding, find a girl/boy to spend time with because you sound like a basement dwelling gatekeeper. 
---
The boxing analogy was really bad though
---
Name a single AAA online game without them, or even pose one way the lack of them helps the overall functionality and longevity of the game.
---
r/whoosh and r/gatekeeping all in one. 
---
God damn it Todd has done it again
---
He said nothing about looting. He focused on a couple different aspects of the game and not the quests
---
I‚Äôm thinking of trying Watoga high school for both the monster mash event, and that the ghouls respawn really fast, no idea if any legendaries will spawn though. 
---
I've seen the water park up north nuked before. It's worse than what you described at grafton. No increased spawns, no glowing enemies, and next to no flora. Just a bunch of level 68 scorched.
---
Ur level 12 u are not aloud to talk about the game on the games reddit lol
---
Never claimed to be a coder but I do have a lot of experience modding Fallout games so I know how these changes are made because I've made some myself. I'm guessing this is your first Fallout game based on your reluctance to believe how the CK works, which is fine. Hope you enjoy the game, pal!
---
Xbox? I can craft you one with all attachment 
---
Just Google it? It was kind of a big deal and there's an entire trail of steam posts and more. You can even take a trip down memory lane on "how tf does explosive even work?" in Fallout 4.
---
You got a bit out in the weeds, I think. The point is that there was very little mitigation for TSE damage and, to your blocker point above, there is for melee. In fact, in PA, you only had base explosion resist with no other option.
---
There's an armor mod to reduce stagger. There are PA plates to reflect damage. Two separate mutations inflict damage on melee attackers. Blocker is a fine example. All of these are perfect examples as to why explosives, with only options for padded and dense, stood far above melee.
---
Damn all right. Yeah Grafton was terrible itself, but worse than Grafton, man... 
---
I just wasted a level up cause you took off the "owned:max rank" for perk cards. Thanks alot. 
---
Lemme explain this slowly for you.
---
If you have fun playing a game, then in your opinion, it is a good game. One person's **opinion** shouldn't effect you at all. Why does it upset you so much that somebody else enjoys the game? 
---
Are you illiterate?  I literally said the game was fun until I got to endgame, you knowill the part that's supposed to be a big part of an online game?  Here's your second chance to actually give a worthwhile reply.
---
A shocking display of levilism....you Sir, should be ashamed.
---
They really need to add some new spawns and events to different Nuke Zones.
---
It sucks that it happened to you but it was a legit cool story anyway. 
---
Yep lol, it was terrible.
---
Added to first post.
---
it does! i need it to complete my set lmfao
---
Nope.
---
I have also noticed an increase in budget from dropping excess items im my camp. I built nothing just dumped excess mats and it took out a turret since my budget went up.
---
If you're on xbox you can gimme the mats and I'll craft it for you 
---
Love how high possums fly when shot üòÇ
---
No, no, naw, no (yes!). That would be (hilarious) mean spirited. I would never do something so (awesome) callous as that.
---
We've had very different experiences. Pvp  has been one of the most captivating parts of the game for me. Getting a wanted level and fending off bounty hunters is a recipe for exciting gameplay. Sure I get one shotted sometimes, but it's far from every encounter. 
---
Pvp has also proven to be a great source of income for me. Of course it's dependent on how often your winning and the level of opponents you are fighting. If I get a kill streak on a level 250 I've just made almost the amount of daily caps from vendors. 
---
Add on top of this thrill of fighting something that can actually strategize against you. 
---
Hell yeah. It'd be cool as fuck to play as someone half as cool as you :)
---
Speechcheck-passed tho
---
Fireproof level 2 and dense negate most damge from explosive
---
ehh turrets are weak and arent very effective since they never seem to target the threat until its too late
---
practically speaking, just have one so you can hear it activate when enemies are nearby
---
No random event reward for that lol 
---
Yeah people cry for nerfs, then when the nerfs hit they'll cry that the content is too hard because they just neutered their damage dealers.
---
Game's fun.
---
Level 87 here so my opinion matters yo.
---
guess you can say im on the *lonesome road*
---
It is.  I got mine at level 40ish running the on patrol event at the Prison near grafton.  
---
Let's just say the megasloths are not as genial as the brahmin
---
Quit bitching. If you can't kill a melee with a gun then you are trash. This isn't up for debate. Case Close. Case dismissed. You already posted this countless times. I'm going to start tagging it for spam.
---
Wait wait wait, is there Jet in the game??? I need to know! I'm a consistent Jet addict and I've been in withdrawals since this game released. 
---
Where did you hear that? I've looked at their Twitter and re-read the ItV but saw nothing about a melee nerf (whut?) or TSE weapons being removed from the nerf.

Most of the time you can break into bases by using a bed or workbench through a window anyway

For violet the best place I‚Äôve seen so far is south of the water park. Keep meaning to get the screenshot uploaded off the PS, but it‚Äôs over the water puddles to the south of the park.  I got over 100 raw violet and a bunch of cobalt as there‚Äôs tons of ferns and bloodleaf in the area. 
---
Enemies were kinda meh though. 
---
Yeah should've guessed the 40+ year old game wouldn't be able to keep up.
---
Put all it junk in ur stash.  Saw this answer earlier
---
I think this could be better stated as "Your opinion on endgame content carries less weight if you haven't experienced it yourself."
---
Once, I  removed a perk to make room for ammosmith right before crafting.
---
Crafted a whole bunch.
---
Went to go take it off but I realize I never actually equipped it, just made space for it.
---
RIP
---
Thankfully yes. Got the speed demon plan so it was very worth the frustration
---
No, not really. Sorry
---
I had in encounter to me allow a road at the north of the Forest
---
Yeah I added an edit at the top. Didn't think it would be that hard to comprehend what level 50 meant.
---
Start reporting everyone of his posts. He spammed this numerous times today and it's the same bitching and moaning.
---
I don't think so. If you read what I posted more carefully, you can see that this is a recipe that exists in the game files but that I don't think can drop in the game.
---
"not so well known" uh, yeah, it's well known. There are posts pretty much every day on here when people hold him for others. There was literally a pic on here when someone was holding him and within 5 minutes there were like 7 people in a line. 
---
I'm just looking for weird places not many have seen nuked, not too interested in anything in particular, I don't find whitesprings too fun

Well, if you don't have it, it's not a complete build. I've been collecting pieces ever since I started that character. Some of the armor pieces I have are lvl 10. Doesn't matter, because they still give +3 stats, the only difference is much lower DR, but with 3-star lvl 10 legendary, other bonuses somewhat make up for it. 
---
The things you mentioned, like Adrenaline and Revenant, apply to both melee and ranged. So I'm not sure why mention them at all.
---
It still leaves stuff that is *unique* to melee. Like melee damage scales with Strength. Melee damage increases with more consummables (alcohol, glowing meat, etc), melee damage increased substantially by mutations, etc. There's no 25% increase to ranged damage mutation, where melee gets two, which stack if you go unarmed. 
---
But I would support reviwing how we procure weapons and gear. I absolutely would. You actually hit on that problem, just a bit indirectly. Currently everything is RNG, and without a global marketplace the odds of any player getting a perfect full set are pretty low. But if we are given some control over modifying legendaries (such as picking one perk and rerolling it over and over, the way we can in The Division) it might help. I'm not saying nerf melee into the ground, and leave it there. Just bring it down to reasonable level, and continue to improve the game. 
---
Personally, I don't even play my melees any more, too boring.
---
At this point it just seems like everyone that doesn‚Äôt have Sentinel/assassins and TSEs are just salty and want everyone to be in suboptimal Armor with crap weapons. 
---
I just want to run around the wasteland and not bother anyone. Leave me and my trades equipment alone. 
---
Downvote me. 
---
Is that the one near Gad?
---
Good idea!! Although, the map is large enough to create a whole new player hub anywhere that can't be nuked and that has no pvp options and a free fast travel location. Just a social area and vending/trade area. Maybe make a store front area outside that you can put up signage or decorate to display your goods. Just like a small diameter camp.
---
This is a very helpful post, thanks. You'll have to imagine the 50 points I have you though ;-)
---
Aww, you're right, I read too fast. üò¢
---
I take over the munitions plant a few times a week. I use melee because it does more damage and I'm a tank in Power Armor.
---
But he wants it, he needs it. He must hoard the precious.
---
Well there goes my theory
---
one of many good ideas that couldve been in the game at launch if they wouldve taken another 6 months-year of development that the game needed.......
---
Look dude, if your issue of endgame stuff being limited to nuke zones you clearly don't understand the direction the game will be going, also, you do realize you can have alt characters right?  I'm starting to doubt you've ever played an MMO,  and you must be the illiterate one considering you put in the OG post my opinion doesn't matter when in fact it does, I payed $40 for a game that I enjoy, a co-op fallout game which I've been wanting for years, go be salty somewhere else, sorry we all have friends and family to play and laugh with while you just do nuke zones griping you have no-one to have fun with. 
---
Take some Jet man, and slow down! :)
---
Demolition expert is 100% damage at level 5 correct? Explosive is nerfed to 20%. So 120%?
---
Bloodied is great but I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be king. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but in the PvP server I just see it being too weak to rad damage and too complicated to maintain when fighting enemies AND players. Personally I have never used a bloodied build but I‚Äôve taken down 2 so far and died to 1 repeatedly. It may be though and Im excited to see how it all plays out
---
2 shot was TOO strong. No other mod in the game gave a 100% damage bonus with NO downside or sacrifice. It had its time but this is long overdue. Explosive would be ok at 50% and demolition expert nerfed to only add 10% with each level instead of 20%. I think they didn‚Äôt want that because explosive guns (ML, Fatman, etc) need all the help they can get. I could get down with buff to explosive guns (not the mod) nerf to demolition expert and bump up the explosive mod a little
---
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt aware. I was going from personal experience, talking to people in game and only ever one person knew it existed. 
---
I crashed within 10 minutes of trying to load into the game. Every time, every day since the first day of this new patch on PS4. I played since beta when people were complaining about occasional disconnects or crashes but nothing like this. Since the newest patch it has taken longer to reload than game and load in than the playtime before the next crash. 
---
If they didn't go around harassing players with them like 98 percent of them did, I would be a bit more reasonable and sympathetic. Off with their heads I say. Loving the salt.
---
Water park has some flora but it‚Äôs mostly a dud in my experience
---
I wouldn't mind a system like that, and it certainly gives it a plausible in-universe explanation for how the sharing occurs (even if it's not as immediate). It would certainly be much better than what we've got now, even if I'd still prefer account-wide unlocks. 
---
If either system were ever implemented, I could also get behind a "fresh start" character creation option the restricts access to account-wide plans and/or character plan-sharing features. That would also fully enable both playstyles: folks that don't want to grind plans over and over have options, and those that want a more purist experience can start totally fresh and grind things out anew.
---
Do they use buckshot stat or a slug stat in this? It looks like a pepper shot to me on YouTube. If each pellet does that damage it would be a few thousand damage. Can any one clarify how the rounds work?
---
I'm thinking simple vending machines that go down the hallway where all the vendors are in whitesprings.  It's all ready a hub for people once they reach a certain level.  Seems like a good idea to keep it there.  The only issue is that area might be nuked. 
---
The cannibal perk works even if you're an herbivore. Until I discovered razorgrain soup, people were my go to.
---
 Also, when you kill a player, you can execute them by eating them. Not a lot of people seem to know that. It's pretty traumatizing I hear (from my victims).
---
Just want somewhere interesting that hasn't been nuked much / most people haven't seen.
---
the first patch notes indicated there is no longer a 2nd shot and instead changing it to 25% flat damage boost.  So if that's correct, there will be exactly 0% extra explosive damage from the 2nd shot though it will take testing to find out for sure.  
---
There goes about 100 wood scraps trying to learn the spiked walking cane mod. No luck.
---
yet another clear sign of the Transformers crossover DLC in the works.
---
At what level is this perk unlocked? I was wondering if there was something that'll dissipate your rads. 
---
I got a one star legendary hunting rifle, exterminator.  Haven't junked it, cause it was my first - and so far only.
---
What does age have to do with it ? 
---
I need to hit that up. Can you help me out on where on the map it is at?
---
You can get 120 violet from Nuking Cranberry Bog, and spawn the SB Queen. Just grab all the ferns in the patches of trees, and the pitcher plants and purple stuff in the water.
---
Don‚Äôt forget super duper perk! Def worth it.
---
Glad you found it helpful thanks for letting me know 
---
How is sneaky pistol?
---
My 2nd is vats riflemen and tbh i won't go back to melee focused anymore.
---
Its fun to run up and smash things but shooting 6 bullets and killing 6 targets in a couple of seconds feels so much better.
---
Right. It gets nuked a lot. If you have power armor it's not a thing but it would be nice if low levels could buy/sell too. Pretty much anywhere people gather will be good. I dont want to have to travel all over spending caps to check out people's items.
---
Seems after each update the loading screens and server crashes get worse. The server crashed 2 times in 15min so far for me and tales much longer to load in anywhere.  
---
Not cheating. Assassins sentinel armor plus with some other perks basically make you unkillable if you dont move. Or the same with cavalier if you sprint
---
It would be cool if Workshops were claimed less related to PVP and more like a strategy game. Like "Oh well I'm going to deploy my army of Gutsies on your workshop so it' dies' and I can claim it." ..."Oh your gutsies are nothing! I'm deploying my Assualtron army then!" 
---
Wishful thinking but it sounds good in my head.
---
I expected nonsensical replies more so than anything, hell another guy on the post just got downvoted for saying he'd be willing to support it.
---
Quitting over an info screen to see stats and gear of teammates is as much nonsense as defending single player vendors.
---
I‚Äôm well aware of that. It‚Äôs just not as convenient as the one up north since you have the SBQ to contend with. I‚Äôve had a lot of bad luck with her where she‚Äôll glitch and not take any damage, meaning I‚Äôll have to put up with her for 1/2hr while trying to play gardener. 
---
Dropped to 1 gb! Thank you so much!
---
I blame vault tec for dropping the bombs.  Their logo is on the bombs in megaton
---
Xbox? 
---
I've been stuck on the loading screen for 32 minutes now....
---
That would require the game to allow you to play long enough to play. Since the console patch it's been constant crashes. It's become unplayable.
---
Lots of places have gyms with dumbbells and other equipment that have a lot of lead. you can get steel from lots of sources. it's a bit of grinding. you can also find lead and steel using extractors at workshops or just at random deposits. 
---
At low levels I suggest using melee as it is relatively cheap to repair and no ammo. I also didn't make ammo until I was way past lvl50 as there was so much dropped from random enemies. 
---
How is explosion damage going to be calculated for players with multiple ranks in explosive perks?
---
Well since you're playing, you chose to get into the boxing ring. 
---
I'm good at two things, eating ass, and beating ass. Bad news for you, buddy; chow time's over.
---
Yup :D
---
Yeah, having it all one location is nice.  And Whitesprings all ready has vendors and all of the crafting stations, and a stash box makes it work well that way.  And it also works from server to server where your vending machine is automatically added.  
---
She wrote a great book about being organized et al. It's a bit like the 5S method from LEAN manufacturing with a human touch. Very zen. I listened to the audiobook a few years ago. 
---
Super mutants no longer spark joy.  Time to eradicate them...
---
But 4 was supported. They even corrected one instance of glitched balancing by correcting McCready's Sniper perk to the intended 20% boost instead of 20000%. Quit making excuses for Bethesda to be lazy in balancing their own game when many many other devs do the same.
---
Hell Obsidian even released balance patches down the line to make more builds viable (giving energy ammo some DT shaving, reigning in some crazy things like the 5x crit multi on the Gobi Rifle, boosting Service Rifle damage a bit and its RoF by a ton). There's no reason Bethesda can't tweak some number values ala Equilibrium in 4 to make things like heavy weapons not shit.
---
The conditioning is real. Since I stepped off the boat to Morrowind and realized the flatware fit in my pocket....
---
If it's not nailed down, it's leaving town.
---
You clearly misinterpret my post then. I am actually voicing the concern about the mentioned weapons' innate incompetence on mid to high level content. The only real way they had anu value was with TSE, with those nerfed to the ground, said weapons SHOULD obviously be buffed accordingly. What boggles the mind is why they were left unattended like this for so long. 
---
They are way less powerful than a great bunch of other weapons. Their faster fire rate not only doesn't bring them up on par with dps, it also results in times more ammo consumption and faster durability loss.
---
I believe this bug occurs in the following scenario:
---
1. Do not have enough of one or more scrap material in your personal inventory
---
2. Do not have enough of one or more scrap material in your stash inventory
---
3. The sum of materials in your stash and your personal inventory is equal to or greater than the amount required to craft the item
---
Simply put. You must have enough scrap in your stash OR your personal inventory, not split between the two.
---
Dont bother with it. Its literally nerfed into the ground.
---
And not like these morons would know how things are calculated, they didnt write the code.
---
Don't feel bad I didn't know either. I've never seen a post about it. 
---
They need to fix this.  You have fissure sites all over the place so you would think this would he good places but no they are all shit except the 2 places.
---
And on that note if you are nuking cranberry bog dont nuke so 1/2 of the nuke site is beyond the map limits.  
---
Yes, perk card ranks include the benefits of all ranks of the said card.  
---
Advanced Power Connector pans can be found a lil' here an there via vendors. E.g Watoga and Harpers Ferry are two possibilities. Might take some server jumps before they appear. 
---
Ya, they really only have to allocate enough "spots" in the area to accommodate the amount of players on the server.
---
Yes, but it seems to be a bit funky. One of the first mod plans I came across was "Serrated" for the machete.... from scrapping a combat knife. 
---
Why? Its getting nerfed into the ground.
---
Any suggestions on how to trigger the fertile soil quest?
---
As someone with a melee build I use occasionally, thanks to PA and serendipity, if it's not explosive weaponry, I can just spam stimpaks till I get close and instantly 1-2 shot anyone. Yaoi Guai meat, death claw meat, hell even PA again, kinda raise our damage as well. That's just pvp too. We also got Pve, where, it's basically a two step process. 
---
If it isn't a scorchbeast I win. 
---
If it's a scorchbeast I just sit around till it lands then I win, or I just leave. 
---
I honestly think we still need a nerf. I made a ranger character as well just to see and now there's more upkeep and maintenance for less damage. More reliance on rng for my required legendaries to even deal "OK" damage, more weight issues, ammo needs crafting, etc etc. Idk, the all rise was just immediate relevancy, where as with guns, the only one I know of is perfect storm, which still isn't great. 
---
Don't even get me started on energy though LOL.
---
Honestly I want melee nerfed a little, with ballistics being our baseline, and energy being buffed, but I just figured I'd argue my piece here. I stopped playing my melee guy cuz since I got marsupial on it too, it's just been Hella EZ to yeet
---
Wasn't BGS banning people for using mods and saying they were 'cheaters'?
---
For those cards you get all the effects. 
---
Advanced connectors show up at Watoga if I‚Äôm not mistaken.  The wall pass through conduit is in the slot for conduit pieces with wire connectors on them. 
---
"it's my goddamned house"
---
Problem solved
---
can you nuke the mothman museum?
---
I did, couldn't find it in the patch notes. 
---
And why do you keep bringing PvP into this? PvE enemies don't shoot you with TSEs. What your power armor has or doesn't have against TSE is irrelevant. PvE enemies also don't have Blocker. 
---
I'm also absulutely not arguing that TSE didn't stand above melee. It did. Even if it didn't measure up to melee in sheer damage, the amount of effort it took to make TSEs work was trivial - you need the weapon, and the Demolitionist perk, that's it. The rest was gravy. But TSEs are being nerfed. They're gone. You can't use them as a shield any more. Melee is exposed for what it is, and you can't "what about TSE!?" it any more. Hence the nerf is coming. Because with TSE gone, melee is the worst offender.
---
You're not alone. First hours after the last patch everything was running smoothly. Now the game disconnect or crash all the time (PS4 pro).
---
you guys are doing amateur ammo numbers. Here's a guide, use it. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag1q7a/miner_mikes_guide_to_ammo_crafting/
---
Well thanks for being such an asset and making the community at large aware of this...
---
Why the fuck is plans in quotes?
---
We just replying with assumptions all day here, let's not
---
The one time I've seen explosive guns impact the queen was when I showed up as soon as the quest triggered for me, and then the quest was immediately over. Explosive weapons decimate everything. 
---
If anything ever actually needed a nerf, it was definitely explosive. Heaven forbid you can't dedicate more than 4 minutes for essentially a raid boss. 
---
+1 to this. Also, FO players don't really seem to be the PVP type. FO probably appeals more to the minecraft crowd than the fortnight crowd. Speaking of which, you guys should reintroduce recruitable NPCs like Boone and Charon (Not the exact characters but characters like them). They were absolute savages. Make them attainable through near impossible missions if you have to. I guarantee this idea will blow people's minds. Or at least give us a dog meat's grand-dad(dog?) insert some lore and also maybe some side quests with cooler story lines. I know you can do NPCs because there is Graham. So what up? 
---
Yes. 
---
Can you get banned for a vault b&amp;e
---
Yeah, however the #butthurt PvP folks not using TSE must have something to blame for their fails.
---
And no, I don't bother with PvP in fo76...it's just stupid.
---
Thanks. I was looking online about the effects but nowhere in the game or online does it say that all three effects are applied to that specific card and I haven't had a chance to test for my self yet. And I'll keep an eye out for those plans. 
---
There is a small explosion and a sound. It's a little satisfying like flies getting killed on a electric lamp
---
Is that in Point Pleasant? I've never actually stepped inside the museum. If it's in Point Pleasant though, it's unfortunately in the safe zone. 
---
They harass me and then I'm the douche for mocking them.
---
Weak. Its weak stuff.
---
One of the problems with storage is it is weight based. So if you have a bunch of heavy items, you'll run out of room faster than someone who is only storing junk. 
---
I earned my Ultracite armor last night at level 42. Had a bit of a brain fart and set down the wrong power armor chassis. Because the armor is level 50, I had to strip everything back off in order to pick it up again. I waited 5 minutes to see if it would recall and it didn't. So now, I have a full set of Power armor taking up a HUGE chunk of my storage space for 8 levels. 
---
Hell, just my junk alone is like 400. 
---
Its actually very boring, i didnt even find mothman there i found him in the mire a part of the cryptids daily
---
I'm happy to be surrounded by TSE players --- while shooting the SBQ!
---
I respect you,  sir. You, though a CRIMINAL... have morals
---
What system? I have the skelly mask on Xbox tomorrow for you if you want. 
---
Level 106, I agree, there ends up being not much to do. I haven't played near as much over the past couple weeks, only picking it up again yesterday. Just grinding for legendaries at this point; and I'm after absurdly specific stuff at this point. 
---
I really wish they implemented some kind of system that would let you remove legendary modifiers from weapons and armour and apply them to others. Hell, even if it costed like 25 stable flux, or some other super high cost, at least it would give some excitement to grinding legendaries, and you could craft yourself your dream setup. 
---
Combat rifle is shit and lever is slow.
---
Haha
---
Its called a shit community.
---
Thanks. Can you see the peice in the build menu even if you have not unlocked it yet. I have been looking though them all and really have seen anything that I think could be that specific peice.  
---
I have my camp rigged up now going through shutters and other things. But I hate the way it looks. Lol
---
Yeah, why so heavy handed with the nerfs. It's all knee jerk. I also think that shotguns are waaaaaay underpowered. Close up they should be way more devastating. And missiles are under powered too. If I am going to lug around 6 missiles at 2 stones each, they better do some damage.
---
I've only ran into him twice so far, both randomly down roads. I know he's a random encounter, but only found him down highways. 
---
Yea i enjoyed the game untill endgame, then enjoyed tse farming whitesprings, i can handle the nerf, but im not spending hours farming power cores to play the game im taking a break from fallout for a while
---
People dont want an easier game.
---
Its just people are tired of the difficulty being "How many bullets you have at the moment".
---
Most people want to get stronger weapons AND get stronger enemies.
---
As of now the only way to get stronger weapons is get super lucky with a legendary or go with a super min max build. Which shouldn't be required to feel powerful.
---
You should be able to, it‚Äôll just have a lock over it meaning you don‚Äôt have the plans for it. 
---
True but I try to keep my work benches and stuff away from windows for this exact reason, but if they can just hop through your window then I might as well left the door unlocked :/
---
You see that window there?  You can jump through them. 
---
Try getting up on the overhang and you can just walk through the window
---
Thats cool maybe you find him more often in parts of the map that are actual mothman sightings
---
This cuck goes around posting this on everyones post.
---
Easy enough to understand: "Ooh la la, I'm over level 50 and I am the be all and end all to you puny level under-50's! If I'm bored, we're all bored!!!!"
---
Your lack of imagination doesn't invalidate my gaming experience.
---
I will admit that I took it as him comparing this game to previous titles solely because he replied on my comparison of the two, however, that still doesn't change the fact that he was correct about the game being terribly unbalanced.
---
As for your point, your entire Strength build will consist of either two-handed or one-handed melee perk cards to fully reach effectiveness. What you do next, you need to consider the fact that:  
---
* You can no longer reduce the weight of your junk, chems, armor, shotguns, heavy weapons, explosives and ammo.
---
* You can no longer master in shotguns, unarmed, heavy weapons, or explosives.
---
* You don't have any room for perks mentioned above or for the following: Blocker, Barbarian, Full Charge, Strong Back, etc.
---
So now you have to determine what perks to choose for the remaining of your play-style. You can decide to either further your defenses through armor/PA/endurance or further improve your offense, but need to take into consideration that the weight of armor, ammo, and weapons will affect you. Aside from that, going full melee limits your ranged engagements, especially in PVP, and current endgame unless you plan to stand around as you wait for the Scorchbeast queen to descent, in which case you'd be useless. I've never played a melee build in previous Fallout because they were crap compared to everything else. The fact that they're strong right now gives incentive to use them, especially those who love melee. If melee weapons were on-par with ranged weapons, the majority would still use ranged weapons because it would still overall outclass the melee weapon in all situations.
---
The only mod is the heavy barrel that they all come with, so not really.
---
Watoga or the cabin raider by top of the world 
---
Because it‚Äôs not like tthey will be horrid bad or anything 
---
Hmmm you might be right tho
---
I will be 41 in 2 months, have been gaming since before your parents smashed to create you, and am level 99.  I still love the game even understanding the issues, all the issues even the ones that didnt affect me, and still respect everyones right to love or not love the game.
---
So is my imput not valid?
---
The thing is there's like two viable types of play, melee and explosive guns.
---
Regular guns are pretty underwhelming, but still feel solid. It's just they rendered almost irrelevant by melee and TSEs.
---
Lower extreme is energy, which deal low damage and have high maintenance prices and nothing particularly redeeming.
---
I ask for melee and explosive nerfs because they feel like the outlier in which they start trivializing the game. Fights that can take 10-25 minutes can be anywhere from seconds to a minute with melee and explosives. 
---
Someone nuked Harper's Ferry yesterday, it wasn't tooooo bad, enough respawns to keep a few people busy and plenty of plants around that area.  Nothing compares to pre-nerf whitesprings mayhem of course, but we shouldn't be comparing everything to that broken scenario. I nuked the mire swamp some time ago, not as many nasty animals there as I expected though.    Next time I am thinking Monongha because FUCK that damn event :)
---
You arent kidding that would be good i would enjoy it again, im level 93 by the way
---
&gt; I said, I don't need you either, but I keep you around 
---
When Keepin it Real goes bad
---
What's the question here?
---
interesting, ya he was not moving really at all and he had someone giving him directions on where other players were coming at him from.  seemed pretty exploitive to me but so is the current state of the game so i just moved on and went about my play.  im wondering why my crit bar never moved when i hit him though
---
Someone did clarksburg, north of grafton. Probably 12-15 glowing ghouls in town and some glowing mirelurks further out. It was kinda fun running around somewhere else though.
---
I wouldn't wait that long.  Do it now while they still have all their logs and records. 
---
I guess, so why don't you wait until the nerf goes out and pick it up for pennies?
---
Theres also a great chance bugthesda will bork it and actually make it terribad.
---
if you learned how to make the skeleton mask(or witch hat) they are bugged and dont show up to actually craft
---
Good. Thought you'd never leave.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing lol. Accidentally got my fusion generator plans from doing it, but took me about 30mins solo trying to figure out wtf to do
---
Little things please little minds.
---
You're pretty much saying "I have a sandwich thus I've cured world hunger".
---
Or to put it in a way you would understand (maybe), you're simply retarded. 
---
I like to think the single posts can snowball into those campaigns you speak of. It got us this far, weeks of hell but we got actual patch notes and some of the biggest small post issues fixed, at the very least they came up enough to be discussed, because eventually people gave up on downvoting things they couldn't argue.
---
They left their dev room in the same place as every dev room in every game, for multiple patch cycles, exp doesn't split through teams outside of quest steps erroneously multiplying for every player (everyone gets split completion XP for everyone who completes steps, even if they're the same steps).
---
Eventually enough posts become enough posts that they have to address it, or atleast can see it.
---
Your entire post is an assumption that your way to play, and your experience of the game, is the same for every person playing. 
---
Raph Koster lead designer of Ultima Online and Star Wars Galaxies has wrote a bunch of interesting things about game design if you're interested.
---
&gt;**Everyone who dislikes your work is right.**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This is the hardest pill to swallow. I‚Äôve never gotten a piece of feedback that was wrong. You see, you can‚Äôt deny a player their unique experience. Whatever they felt, was true. For them. And *something* in your work triggered it.  
---
&gt;It is useless, and worse, actually self-defeating, to attempt to deny the critique. Sure, there are sometimes reviews that seem spiteful, unfair, and the rest. But the vast majority of the time, people are giving their honest reaction.  
---
&gt;And the bottom line is, you put the game out there in order to get reactions. If it were not for reactions, you could have just kept the game in your drawer and gotten everything you needed out of it.

Bye. 
---
Suppose any time is good, just hoping to get my hands on one. It‚Äôs my favourite weapon 
---
unknown.  it's reasonable to guess that at rank 5 you'd get 40% base weapon damage.  so if a standard receiver damage is 100, then explosive would add 40.
---
But ultimately you are asking questions that I don't think anyone outside of testers at bethesda (if they have any) will know the answers to.
---
I thought the haters left? 
---
It's not even bad. To me it's copy and paste FO4. Unless people are bitching about how similar it feels then I don't know.
---
"You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed. If. You. Are. No. Refunds."
---
2shot had the negative to accuracy, which makes vats shit with them. That 100% bonus actually helped a lot guns that are inherently too weak. Like I said two shot didnt need the nerf, all other effects needed a buff. Two shot wouldnt make you 1 shot anything, just waste half less bullets killing anything. And everything is a sponge so it was a good change.
---
And thats not how demolitionist works, it makes explosive damage 100% more. On a missile launcher, yes that means 100% damage is explosive. But for explosive weapons, only 20% of the additional damage is actually explosive. So demolitionist will buff that part to 40%. Explosives did not make ballistic weapons an actual explosive weapon, just added an explosive aoe that spawned wherever the projectile made contact.

I think explosives at 50% would be fine if demolitionist worked on it, cuz then for a 50% damage boost youre using up 5 perk points which is a decent cost. Otherwise to me, explosives being made a prefix and unaffected by demolitonist wouldve been good enough. Since now you would have 1 more viable options for legendary prefixes and no OP ass comboes. Oh and still buff other prefixes. There is no reason for enemy specific legendaries to do such little additional damage.
---
since X-01 are impossible to find I use T60 calib. shocks with my X-01
---
Alright. Going to try and image search it. 
---
Question, how many projectiles come out of a shotgun? 
---
That's why always use the double windows for the ground floors or anywhere that has access.
---
Save the singles for up top.
---
I believe the cook stove is just cosmetic, same as a nuka machine. 
---
This is what Bethesda is failing to understand. I wish I could up vote this twice. 
---
Cue the ‚ÄúGood, leave.‚Äù comments 
---
Literally saw my first mega sloth today at Treetops in probably 100 hours playtime. He one shot me with some throwable item and I was at like 80% health in all my normal armor lol. What the hell was that about?
---
I know what you mean. I did what the guy above you described when I fought the Murkwater Queen, and the fight lasted all of 20 seconds.
---
Radshield
---
Ok so fine. You're lucky you got all the correct gear. Myself and tons of others aren't so lucky.
---
I saw the build and know what it can do. But again that's the insane stacking. Look at that. Or give guns something similar.
---
I don't even like melee that much except for the fact I don't need to farm ammo. I got seriously sick of that by lvl 100 which is when I changed to melee. I MUCH prefer my old sneak/vats/crit build.
---
I'm just saying nerfing melee isn't the answer. Stacking is something to look at. If you nerf melee then you would completely ruin it for a lot of people.
---
We don't seem that far off. I'm just completely against nerfing "Melee" when the problem is how it stacks w gear etc. Melee is fine as it is. Like I said I'm not super power w my current gear. And I'll be lucky to get perfect gear.
---
And I mentioned AR/Rev only because I thought you were using  it as part of your reasoning why melee damage is so high. I didn't even take AR because i wanted to keep my option to sneak and snipe. So I need my sneak and... Dam it the 2.5 damage from stealth perks. Couldn't invest in Agi much when I swapped to melee. Need my rifle perks instead.
---
Again I simply don't feel melee needs a nerf. Melee is fine unless you get the gear you have which most of us don't. Wish I did but unfortunately I do not. 
---
It's not like either of us have much of a say in the matter at the end of the day anyway. Good discussion though. 
---
Oh last thing I almost missed. You brought up mutations and consumables. Don't you think that's a bit dumb that there aren't any consumables for guns like there are for melee? Makes zero sense to me. Not including bobleheads. 
---
Can you still?
---
Nope. There‚Äôs a lot of BS floating around on this sub. People who entered the Dev room using the cheat engine are getting banned. Everything else is just people‚Äôs opinions or what they want others to think. 
---
This. I'm only level 34 and do alot of stealth snipering with my .308 sniper rifle. I am constantly running out of  .308 ammo. I picked up a handmade rifle to help conserve my .308 ammo but now I'm running out of 5.56m ammo too.
---
I tried  using the Ammo Munitions factory for a while but its more trouble than its worth. 
---
They really need to change the ammo making receipe for .308 or something...its annoying. 
---
All Assaultron are lusty, so there is no point of writing such a book. ;)
---
Click the right arrow on the cooking station fire camp thinghy, you can create a stove or the bbq rotisserie style thing that goes above a camp fire. You can cook on that stove.
---
It's pretty easy to make explosive weapons do 0 dmg against you 
---
If the only thing "keeping the game alive" for you are the toxic, exploitative sacks of shit who are destroying the game for everyone else...don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out, you toxic sack of shit? 
---
I have no game? I didn‚Äôt know I was trying to pick chicks up here. Don‚Äôt make such baseless assumptions either 
---
After 3min waiting i close the game then come back into it
---
Exactly the same here on my Xbox
---
I saw some fella wearing a hazmat suit sniping ghouls in whitesprings. Looked kinda fun tbh.
---
So what perks do you use on gauss?
---
I used to have one that did an ass ton of damage, then they changed it, i thougjt to rifles, which I have maxed out.
---
Now it does under 100
---
Actually no, if level 1 gives 10%, level 2 15% and level 3 20% you get 20% not 45%
---
Mood.
---
YouTube it. There is a group that has nuked jist abour every place in the game and uploaded a video each time. There are quite a few decent places 
---
There's definitely a story, but it's like a crime scene.  You have to piece together what happened.
---
I just found this out myself today lol a kind vault dweller gave it to me and I thought I‚Äôd try it out. I had probably 100-150 cells. Blew away 3 low level ghouls. So there‚Äôs that lol
---
I learned both but only craft armor
---
yeh i noticed this also..must be a glitch...makes that weapon un usable
---
Vault 76 was supposedly a control vault though, right? Of course it wouldn't be the first time Vault Tec lied, but wouldn't the Overseer at least be privvy to the vault's TRUE function if that were the case?
---
Late to the party but can you still?
---
wew that was hostile. i never said they were keeping the game alive, I said the meta around them being attacked 24/7 by vigilantes and other dupers lead to a lot of roleplaying. I don't know if you actually read my post to see my relationship with them, was getting summoned in to go attack duping/trading groups
---
Hope it's permanent. 
---
In my experience, no. First time, I had a stack of several and got just ammo and stims. Since then I've turned them in singly and gotten outfits fairly often and T-60 paint twice so far.
---
I learned both but only craft armor. I hope fix too in the new patch...
---
If they lock it you can shoot it 
---
Oh damn okay, I figured with it being out about 2 months most people would've done just about everything now. 
---
Those reactions make sense tho. Why announce you're unsubbing?
---
The key you find in the middle of the bridge unlocks the east gate.
---
It was in the last series of patches. Explosive legendaries were late in the game, and if you're looking for it in patch notes.... It isn't there. Seriously, just trip through the steam forums. It's a wild ride with speculation about 5x+2x damage multipliers and all sorts of fun "science" (most all of which was eventually busted - explosives don't do damage to every limb and trigger a headshot....).
---
The announcement from Bethesda is not made in the vacuum of PVP and includes PVE. The explosive effect is present in PVE - scorchbeast screams are explosive.
---
The argument you'll most often see about melee (PVP or PVE) is that melee is at a disadvantage on approach. Colonel Gutsy doesn't care if you have a hammer. Colonel Gutsy is deleted if you have an exploding lever action rifle. A player with perks equal to what they would have at the level you can get a TSE (25, right? 35?) has melee counters and options. They did have options against explosives that mattered (Dense is the best you have and isn't all that helpful in PVP).
---
So, holistically, it's still difficult to accept claiming that "Duh, melee is broken and next on the chopping block before they nerf all the other things" is just wildly speculative and..... A slippery slope.
---
Have an upvote on me, personally I think it‚Äôs a shame if someone feels that they can no longer enjoy a game they paid their hard earned cash for, even if I can‚Äôt directly relate.
---
With how long it takes to get through the silo most people dont want to "waste" their nuke but this group of kids decided to hunt for good nuke zones 
---
Nobody fucking reme.bers when you couldnt kill a sbq.
---
I do.
---
It was before tse.
---
Im going to laugh so hard when these cucks QQ cause the bitch flies off having not even mutated.
---
First you cheat and then you're willing to get back? Really hope its permanent.
---
Yep, happened to me too, amazing that This has been around since launch. The worst part I didnt even hit anything!
---
Create your ideal build and then remove the cards you already have maxed. Then you can pretty much see what you need to do. What cards to level up and what points to change around.
---
If it weights too much, I could lift it off our hands. 
---
How does he ruin gaming? Can you give me the source of your claim for Bethesda admitting the game isn't good?
---
You say you don't hate the game but your tone speaks otherwise. Perhaps you don't like that op enjoys the game? Join the rest of the trolls that clearly have nothing better to do
---
I hope the don't ban them, instead they should an inventory full of instigating drills and rolling pins and take away their perks and perk points
---
He thinks the plans are still in your inventory and is saying if he was you he would drop them because Support can't do that for you. Try explaining that your character has already learnt the plans.
---
You can create a new character, just buy the game again and create a new account. This time maybe don't cheat
---
Pretty sure you're a melee build I keep running out of lead and have to hit lucky hole.   I need WAY more acid.  The .50 is hungry
---
K then. Glad you felt the need to explain to us why you're leaving. 
---
Your heartfelt reeeeeee has warmed the cockles of our cold, cold hearts.
---
I do all that as well (minus the pictures part, never got i to that). I prefer not to group up, but when I come across someone (especially low level) I just give them stuff. Makes me feel like a decent human being in this shitshow of a wasteland. (Had several bags of junk stolen before in case my bitter, petty, social isolationist attitude wasnt obvious)
---
no it is not. the have scripted responses and dont give two shots about your specific issues.
---
wat?  You don't think it's because both double weapon damage unlike every other mod?
---
I have all the rifle perks / tank killer/ also have that mutation that gives more damage the lower your hp. so normally i sit around 50/50 hp
---
Thanks so much man it worked
---
You shouldn't have framed it in TSE related conversation if that was your intent.
---
These weapons have been broken for several _games_ now and are certainly deserving of their own post not wrapped in TSE drama, right? Energy weapons are the same.
---
We got a tiny bit of love on the Gatling Laser last patch but it's minimal.
---
So I got in. Doesn't the CAMP machine itself usually tell you who it belongs to? Cuz this one isn't telling me anything.
---
Found this opace last week. Never found any bobbleheads or magazines there though.
---
Wish i could out my camp there. 
---
It's pretty clear "The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage" I read base weapon damage as no perks, 
---
Can I have your Legos?
---
[Feedback]
---
This is feedback regarding the "Distant Thunder" event.
---
I would like to point out a deep inbalance of loot drops from this event. [The top 3 plans displayed on the pipboy](https://imgur.com/d67Ez7L) is the result/reward of doing 10 Distant Thunder events. 
---
I am literally drowning in plans for Motion-assist servos. Is there any possibility you guys could make it drop something else? Maybe decrease the chance of getting the same reward all the time? 
---
Since you guys asked for feedback about the events, here is how I handle a Distant Thunder event: 
---
I look at the map, see there is a DT event going on, and fast travel to it immediately, no matter how far away I am. This is to get there first, as any other player can finish the mission within 2 seconds, and the event might be over once you get there. 
---
Once I get there, I wait 2 minutes for other people to show up, and then start marking enemies with that recon rifle you can build. If I forgot it at home (rifles weigh too much in this game), I still wait 2 minutes and then start plowing down the enemy. 
---
Then I wait the 10 seconds it takes for it to register that I did the thing required, and gets sorely disappointed over the reward. The reward is usually the same if not less amount of caps I spent trying to get there, which is a big bummer. 
---
The plans I get, is usually the same. I have done almost 100 DT events total, and in over 80% of the time, I get plans for the T60 motion assist servos. 1 time have I gotten an arm for a T51b, that's it. 
---
Please change how often you get the exact same reward. Especially in events. 
---
In my initial message I clearly said I used them on myself (i didnt realize it cut off so ill add the message).  
---
It's a different person for each response so I don't think they're reading all previous messages.
---
Hahahahahahahaha!
---
Bethesda..
---
Address support tickets!
---
Laughing mexican video!
---
Nice.  Its ridiculous how much having defensive turrets prevents you from building the rest of your stuff.  My camp is so fricking small because of those limits.  I mean, sure I could get rid of the guns.  But I shouldn't HAVE to get rid of the guns :)
---
The initial article they posted only mentioned 2 shot, and said it will be changed to 25% flat dmg bonus and also removed from future drops.  
---
Then they updated the article to clarify that while the change to 25% flat damage boost but it will NOT be removed, and added the nerf to explosive in there.
---
My GF would agree 100%, she loves my game play
---
I know this is an old thread but... 
---
I can semi confirm the wiki is correct. I server hopped for 3+ hours looking between harpers ferry and watoga without ever finding one. A friend and I started an alt together and at level 16  he was able to buy 3 in an hour. What I'm wondering now is could that be why I can't seem to find mods I feel like I used to see all the time? (combat armor specific mods, shielded under armor, other weapon plans)
---
I'd love to hear anyone else thoughts on that
---
Gotcha. Go with whatever the latest update is, I'd say.
---
Yeah it really sucks for people like you who go them legitimately.  These weapons have been duped to oblivion and way more people have them than what was intended. That is the real problem that Bethesda should address, not the legendary effect itself. 
---
Easy fix. Just get a new account. 
---
When Kimbely said "I would go ahead and delete the items from your inventory." what she meant was, "If I were YOU, I'd go ahead and delete the items from your inventory."  
---
I agree, though, neither of them appears to understand that what you have is PLANS that you already LEARNED, and as such are no longer items in your inventory. (If I were you) I would keep track of all this and, if the ban hammer comes, trot it out in your own defense. The only other suggestion I have is, just don't use those paints until they're released.  
---
Never seen them, if they exist at all, im kinda wondering if they might be accidentally level locked like the handmade rifle?
---
It would be cool if learning raider armor had a unique mechanic, where you just learn the plans overtime, like you are becoming a raider just by surviving the wasteland.
---
As a lowly lvl 40, I hit SBQ last night with 1400 ammo in one critical head shot as she was landing.  A little hello from RobCo's finest!  Took out half its life, then I charged with my next best thing, a flaming barbed pitchfork!  
---
So when that subreddit does get created we know it is you on a different account 
---
It is similar to how the listed price for moving your camp is actually not at all the cost it charges. And what happens to our caps when trading to a merchant robot?
---
Lol that sounds so far above anything I've seen with this game. 
---
We can dream

I have been thinking about this since I leveled it up last night. I'm going to have a closer look and test it when I play again.

nah, just the people who whine.

how about a useful response? what is this bethesda support?
---
I'm lvl 160 and at this point all I do is give out goodie bags to new players and farm SBQ, but for some reason being a high level has now labeled me as an exploiter to the low levels I run into, get a lot of abuse when I'm just trying to hand out stimpaks and some leather armor.

raw flux is easy to get but the hardened mass highradiation fluids etc are hard to ciome by..im always selling my raw flux cos i cant find the rest of the ingredients to convert it to stable

Yikes, that a kick in the nuts after I fully ranked my explosive perk. I only have an explosive, (not two shot) lever action. Dang, i just found it tuesday too.

I‚Äôm the opposite. I have a surplus of the others from farming Whitesprings. When making UC ammo I ran out of UC scrap and started scrapping hardened masses. 
---
Minoy mi hoy!

I read your post, then I read between the lines of your post. "the only fun I'm getting out of this game is because of dupers" I mean, if that's the case...

If you make a even remotely positive post about dupers, and this was, you deserve shit for it.

How do you mean how long?

3 bar Budget
---
Resources: Significant Room enough for a minimum of three large purifiers and 30 crops 
---
Structures: what we currently have 
---
Defenses: 1 + 1 room for a Turret per 10 Levels up to 50: Home Defense adds 1 more at max rank, addition items in defenses can take up the additional space provided instead of turrets
---
I would love to be a part of this. My C.A.M.P. is just south of the Gorge

They are a possible drop from the Signal Strength quest. Unfortunately it can only be done once per character. I'm thinking they may be also drop from helping a teammate complete the quest but haven't been able to try yet.
---
I still take a fair bit of rad damage in power armor, with radshield. 
---
Point.

NERF MY SALAD!

I just made the decision to stop being over encumbered as well.  Sure they only weigh 0.03 but when you have several hundred Rad-X's it builds up.

 If you slide that just a bit further you will see the Cooking Stove which needs to be unlocked.

 That's what I'm trying to do.

You're op says it would be nice to be able to create a character.

Did you just say that for giggles? Because you're indicating you understand its an account ban.

Perfect. Never change.

Either youre in a party and they flagged you or you capture workshops.
---
What kind of gameplay are you looking for? Are you trying to get advice on end game pve? Do you want to know about pvp? Are you confused on perks? 
---
Happy to help you, but the question is kinda broad. 
---
Items will be stored in the "stored" tab and can be placed back down during build mode.
---
Good places to build include near a water source if you want to build a water purifier, or near resource nodes for things like ore. 
---
Too bad all the nerf tse crybabies couldnt grasp this. I take zero damage from tse
---
I'm having similar issues, particularly near Poseidon Energy Plant, I'm running a Xeon x5670@4.4, 12gb ram, and a GTX1060 6gb, I'm wondering if this is a 6 core CPU issue?  I also ran on a i7 2600, 16gb ram and the same GTX1060 6gb with no issues.
---
Where?? Omg!
---
You'd have to ask them. You could get lucky with a responsibly-worded support ticket. The alternative's creating a new account, or moving on.
---
Unless this is your first online game you must have known how it would end.
---
Fallout 4 was supported through planned content and bug fixes, but the majority of the bug fixes was done by the community, hence the unofficial patch mod.
---
&gt; Quit making excuses for Bethesda to be lazy in balancing their own game when many many other devs do the same.
---
How does that justify the fact that it's okay to be lazy and not support your game? Bethesda Studios is not Obsidian, even people in this subreddit would love the idea if Obsidian made another Fallout game, but it's never going to happen. This is Bethesda Studio's first multiplayer game where balance plays a bigger factor than their previous titles. This game will be their proving grounds for future titles.

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! 
---
Fuck off you autism soaked faggot
---
Graying out wouldn't work.  It's already used to signify above cost.
---
Oh damn that puts my damage with perks to 336. That hurts. But thank you for the double check.
---
Figured it out, he was holding an axe that does more damage with less damage resistance and it was affecting his grenades somehow. He switched weapons and it went back to normal damage lol. 
---
Green checkmark then? 
---
You do realize perks and a chest mod can make you immune to explosive damage right?
---
The nerf has nothing to do with pvp.
---
Same. Today I even sat in front of a tse shotgun guy and laughed horrible over the mic as he did 0 dmg. All these kids would rather just cry and complain rather than figure the game out and become a good player. 
---
I just want deathclaws that like... bring death... with their claws
---
YES! I agree with this. Also, who wouldn't use their pipboy while in bed?
---
You'd be lucky to be sent to the dashboard from the crashes. The game can't handle all of those explosions.
---
It doesnt add, it multiples. The formula goes like this:
---
Actual DR= DR * (1-A) * (1-B) * (1-C)
---
DR is the targets damage resistance
---
A, B, C are the different anti armor values
---
Actual DR is the actual damage resistance the target has when the game has factored all that information and calculates how much damage the target will take. So to answer your question we will use the max armor penetration values in the game and assume a target has a base damage resistance of 250.
---
Actual DR= 250 *(1-.5)*(1-.36)*(1-.36)
---
Actual DR=250*.5*.64*.64
---
Actual DR=51.2
---
We will assume the gun does 180 damage, so when the damage is calculated it calculates the damage of 180 against the targets resistance of 51.2 because of armor penetration perks where it would be 250 with none at all. .5 comes from anti armor legendary effect, .36 is from level 3 tank killer, and the other .36 comes from the max armor penetration a gun can have on the magazine mod. The armor piercing mags scale in order equal to tank killer:
---
Armor penetration=12%
---
Improved armor penetration=24%
---
Superior armor penetration=36%
---
This was not discovered by me, I wish I could remember the name of the person that discovered it but they were the person I learned it from. I hope this helps
---
No it's not, I have the "Cooking Stove" on two characters, and it's functional. 
---
Don't look at me; I'm not complaining about exp damage in PvP.
---
Yea it‚Äôs pretty sad now.  But if you are looking to snipe you could go for Instigating and +50% limb damage, just gotta aim weird.
---
*Oof*
---
Glad it worked :D
---
That's what I did when I used the brick, I just didn't see anyone commenting on it so I thought I'd post,
---
What is better, 3 star or 1 star?
---
Each star just means what type legendary they may drop 3 being the best but it doesn‚Äôt always happen... when you look st the item dropped each star is a perk that‚Äôs added to it so 2 stars has 2 different ones and 3 has 3 different ones 
---
I just found out what caused it, some other people had the bug too and it only happens while you have the scaly skin mutation, got rid of that and my ap regens all the time now!
---
Did you buy the "kitchen stove" or "cooking stove"? Kitchen stove is a cosmetic non-functional item, cooking stove is the crafting variant. 
---
If you did by the proper one, it's weird that is didn't unlock. I haven't seen anyone else have that particular bug. 
---
All you have to do is create a new account. It takes 30 seconds. 
---
I was thinking bloodied explosive and run high rads. I play a support role anyway.
---
Just northwest of Twin Lakes there is a super mutant behemoth inside a pond. If you follow the stream of water out of the lake on the north side it will lead you to a smaller pond. Inside this pond is what seems to be a sleeping behemoth. He is only aggresive when you attack him first even though his name tag shows him being aggresive.
---
I do believe there is the swamp at the base of the location which will have water. Just have to lug it up back to your location. 
---
Ohhhhh, so in order to get a two shot explosive, it must be a two star or above?
---
This is the rarer version of the stretchy naked PA set.
---
From memory:
---
All three riflemen
---
Demolitions expert (because the gun is explosive)
---
Tank killer
---
I think those are the main ones that have me maxed.
---
Plus any bobble heads or other perks that may happen. 
---
Ammosmith exists. So does super duper. In junction you get tons of ammo from what ive heard.
---
Says the kid with a 19 day old account who trash talks everyone in all of their post history. Pvp me im on xbox bet youll lose, hell I wont even use an exploding weapon
---
Totally agree if you need something buff others to make up for lack of gun play. Next update we'll see what happens have a good weekend friend
---
The stars just mean how many perks are on the item.
---
1 star 1 perk. 
---
2 stars 2 perks etc.
---
Peek/bonus however u want to call it.
---
So 3 would be the current best.
---
There are 4 stars but they don't drop. You need to add a mod. Don't worry about that if you're new. 
---
My problem isnt lead but the steel. My base is on a steel extractor just so I can try to maintain myself.
---
I answered you as a new post by mistake. See above. 
---
Why Bethesda didn't go with the time proven PVP/PVE/RP server idea is beyond me. Maybe they thought it was intuitive. But you don't have to reinvent the wheel when it works.

I also worry this new PVP mode will just funnel PVPers together but the griefing shitlirds won't opt in cause they suck at actual PVP and will continue to grief people who aren't interested.
---
Have you been able to get the recoil to go down with it? I've got a tse one that I barely use because the recoil annoys me. I always end up going back to the perfect storm for more manageable recoil
---
Considering it says 20% of the *base weapon damage* I assumed it wouldn't include Demo Expert at all. It'll be interesting to see. 
---
If you can't kill a melee person with a gun then you are trash at the game. The only thing that needs balancing is your skill. Enjoy the much needed nerf!

Not the sharpest knife in the drawer are you?

Edited, thanks. Honestly that part of the post came from what I‚Äôve heard around the community, the camp thing though I‚Äôve had happen to me.
---
Items are stored and as a new player you'll want to build near a good sized water source so you can make unlimited purified water.

Add me aphillyated xo

Haha, that's awesome!

Harpers Ferry to the East. Climb the cliff next to the bridge and explore the top. There's a nice rare node up tby here too. 
---
Be careful with base placement in both locations as sometimes building too close can cause death when loading in. Also fast traveling is a bit tricky unless you pacify the cats first but you can always just walk away from them.

---
I'm not seeing it in the patchnotes, and I really can't take a bunch of random Steam posters as gospel. Especially when some of them are calling it a myth or a hoax or a rumor. 
---
For the rest of it, I just can't see the aruments there at all. Yes, there's explosive damage in the game outside of TSEs. I probably died more by standing too close to cars than I did to TSEs. But how is any of this relevant to the fact that now that TSEs are gone, melee is king of the hill damage-wise now? 
---
Yes, melees do have disadvantages, nobody is disputing that. At the same time, melee has advantages. Again, nobody really disputing those either. Problem is, melees are capable of too much sustained damage. 
---
I don't know about TSEs, but explosive damage weapons start at lvl 5. Again, not sure how it's relevant to melee. Especially, again, that explosive guns are down by 75% (total damage reduction on TSEs is closer to 60%). 
---
Melee is broken in a way that is not related to any of this, in any way. Melee scales directly with the base stats, ranged doesn't. Melee benefits from two mutations (adding to up to 50%), ranged doesn't have the option. Melee penetration via perks is 75%, ranged is 0-45%, depending on weapon. Etc., etc. I mean, I would just be rehashing the same thing that's been said a million times. 
---
Bottom line is still the same **TSEs are gone**. With them gone, you no longer get to use them as a shield or a distraction. Now the sights will be square on the next-best-thing, which is where most players will now flock to, with TSEs gone. And that is melee, for those who can tolerate the gameplay. Hence the likelihood of a nerf. 
---
And for heaven't sake, stop saying "slippery slope". Slippery slope is a minor event, which leads to a chain of events, culminating in a significant event. In layman's terms, minor action leads to major consequences. At no point did I suggest that melee nerf is a minor action. That alone kills you entire slippery slope as a logical fallacy. You are honestly like those people who see a comparison and start shouting "whataboutism!", no, not every comparison is whataboutism. And pointing out someone's hypocrisy doesn't make it whataboutism either, sometimes it's just about pointing out the hypocrisy, and is perfectly valid on its own.

Damn I‚Äôll always take unloved mini nukes :(

This happens on Xbox as well.

Np man.
---
I realize the majority of your post is about base destruction too.
---
I'm not sure how bethesda can tackle that much as the cap cost for wanted isn't an issue when your cap capped anyways.
---
I think immunity is a bit much although there are no reasons outside of griefing to attack a base
---
;)

It's possible the support staff don't play the game and aren't fully aware of the whole plan learning mechanic so you may need to spell it out for them. Something like "the item is no longer in my inventory as my character has learnt the plans, therefore I'm unable to remove the item as advised."

---
This makes me wonder why they‚Äôre still nerfing the guns, if I‚Äôm specced for damage and your specced for damage first hit wins. So instead of figuring out how to play defensive  people cry out the offensive? I just really don‚Äôt understand a takeaway at this point when they gave a cop out for this entire category of guns.
---
I mean, why not, right?  Why else do they make thieving a skill?  In the last decades of Fallout games, they have been training us to hoard materials.  Now they want us all to play FPS Six Sigma Black Belt?
---
The story after the dlc was added was good. Vanilla was boring as shit. The first third is an on rails tour of the Mojave, unless you can sneak past the deathclaws. Also invisible walls everywhere, and so many bugs on launch that it was borderline unplayable. Hell if you said you liked NV for the first two years it was out you got downvoted to hell. Then the goty was on sale for almost nothing and a shitton of people bought it, and suddenly it's the best fallout game ever. It's really good, but honestly the circle jerk is starting to bug me. 
---
you want my unloved mini nukes, eh?

There hasn't been any cats up here, just this friendly dog. And yes, spawn placement took a bit of time to get right, but I got it pretty good now.
---
All this does is give non-PA users the extra rad resist while still using their set of standard armor.  Non-PA users can already play in nuke zones through using rad shields and perking for rad sponge while in a group, this just offers leeway for solo players or in some cases duo groups. PA users will still have vastly superior DR/ER. Since all this does is add rad resist, it just makes nuke zones work for non-PA the way the rest of the game already works for them
---
 I'm almost positive it said 'Cook Stove'. I got it from chad at Camden Park. I read this stuff right away, and it said Cook Stove unlocked.
---
 I dunno. I guess I'll try some more. Its fun this stuff. This alt is my Handmade Gun and other plans guy and has been very successful through hard work and its relaxing looking for house crap. 
---
The stars on the legendary enemies just show the rarity of that legendary enemy and they have a possibility to drop a weapon/Armor with that many modifiers. The crown above the level next to their name means they are a "Boss" enemy.  They are stronger then their regular counterparts and yield more XP.

I just live on boiled water anyway, so doesn't really matter a whole lot for me, just wanted to let others know!

Im so glad you are on xbox!
---
No one is talking about pvp when upset about the nerfs so this is irrelevant. The problem is a full server of rifle users will have a tough time with the queen. In a whitespring run melee users will run around 1 shotting everything and gun users wont get any xp or drops.
---
It's already wicked easy to make explosives do 0 dmg to you in pvp so that also makes the nerfs irrelevant in a pvp situation. 
---
I believe i understand thanks dude
---
I edited my comment. Left out how to get to the cats. 
---
 Is the dog always the same breed have you noticed ?
---
Yep east of Harper's Ferry where the train tracks converge. Just at the top!
---
Yep if your appearing online we can‚Äôt join

There are 3 plans for a "stove", only one of which is functional. Are you sure you didn't get the "Wood Stove" and the "KITCHEN Stove"? Both of them are cosmetic only.

Didn't realise he was a random event at the time, I was only level 9 at the time and I've not seen him since (level 87 now). 
---
Thank you!!!

What system are you on?
---
One thing that immensely helped me is farmind those dangling cans. There's many of them in the ski resort right next to Top of the World, there's some in the Penitentiary between Morgantown and Grafton. There's the mutant base, I forget the name, along the road in the Mire that has like 4-5 garlands, each one is like 9 cans (9x lead). Steel I get from breaking down enemies' guns. That's pretty much  how I managed to survive until I got Ammocrafter. It gets easier after 40, you get many more weapon options (like Teslas using energy cells) and Gauss that does a lot of damage per shot.
---
How many legendary drops do you get per spawn? I was thinking that could be a good spot, but half the time I have been there I get mole miners which max at level 40
---
I got the skeleton plans off a dead body that was wearing the outfit. Haven‚Äôt learned them since I already have an outfit 
---
I unlocked the plan, but can't find it in the building menu :(
---
I can't recall. I believe it's always been mottled brown dog of some sort.
---
Agreed 
---
I thought this was before the dev room was found. When they banned a bunch of players and asked them to write an essay about why cheating was bad. I probably have these events mixed up though. Lol
---
No, I'm complaining about the power-armor-melee spec people who one-shot legendary enemies and I can often not get a tag on because they're either too quick or in the way.
---

Can't a bloodied gun build do the same thing?
---
 Its possible I did. A record of read plans would be nice as many have noted. I am a kinda 'make all possible mistakes' guy so that may just be my fate. I'll get it next time. ;)

Get all the spawns dead, FT to 76 then back to Watoga and you'll more likely to have a spawn. I put my camp down there to make it cheap. I've had times were 3 or 4 laps with no legendary bots then do the trip and get 3 or 4 the next run. Once had so many spawn that i missed 2 because one blew up before i could hit the others.
---
Part 4 is definitely a better option then. Destroying bases when people lock their water purifiers is my life. 
---
Thanks for the offer to help, really appreciate it! =) will add ya the next time I‚Äôm online. If you have some time, I‚Äôd like to see if you‚Äôre able to snap the roof on for the same problem I faced in this post. My camp budget‚Äôs full now, so can‚Äôt experiment that there, but if you‚Äôre up for it, we can grab a workshop and try it there? Let me know, and no worries if you don‚Äôt have time to try it out!
---
I did all the treasure maps in my inventory the other day (had about 25) and they all gave me plans. 
---
I had literally just caved and bought warehouse building set, and then got it from a treasure map. So if you have any of those, do them! I had to look up a guide, since even though I knew most of the locations I couldn't see the damn dig spot for the life of me. 
---
Also workshops give you plans. 
---
Damn raiders 
---
We where talking about the said card he was wondering about.
---
In the vid there was at least 3 per spawn for glowing ones
---
Imo bloodied/unyielding/melee is going to get a balance check too.
---
I got a feeling everything shouldn't be so hilariously easy.
---
Agreed! Be nice to watch some YouTube while resting :p
---
yeah I have Lead tagged for search. I always scavenge those tin can alarms. You still go through alot of lead making ammo though. 
---
That's quite a nice one if only for the explosive.
---
It'll make nuke runs easy.

I ended up making a spreadsheet of my current perks and my nukesdragon build side-by-side, and then making a todo list of all the cards I needed and points to shift.
---
The ONLY one hit kills in PVP should be 1) Mini Nuke, 2) Stealthed/From Behind Melee "Surprise" attack, 3) Sniper Headshot.
---
I mean, if you sneak up behind someone and cut their throat with a knife, they dead.  If you heashot somebody w/a .50 BMG Sniper and their helmet is less than 1 inch of solid steel armor plate, they dead.  Armor Piercing .50 BMG rounds can actually go through MORE than an inch of steel.
---
You nuke somebody point blank, they dead, no matter what.
---
Ok. You can doubt it happened at all. That's a trendy way to think lately.
---
You're off in the grass again. You required I speculate as to why the "obvious logical progression" was a slippery slope and I did. It is indeed a slippery slope to move from _TSE is nerfed therefore melee is next and every other build type because every MMO rebalances everything after TSE gets a nerf and then nerfs melee_.
---
I don't know why you're denying that. You literally called it a logical _progression_ and detailed how it would have a large range of effects through several builds.
---
It isn't. Melee being up next for nerfing is currently a fictional escalation. That's a slippery slope.
---
It's a slippery slope. It's false. You've invented it entirely.

I will look into this

If you're on PC, there's a mod for "Known Plans" that'll show you what plans on a vendor you already know. Not quite the same as a list, but helpful nonetheless.

See my edit above, too. That's the easiest way to tell. Use the imgur link to tell you what the name of plans are, then go through your buildables and see which ones you've opened.

They should take your final damage and put it through an inverse log limiting function to clamp down on the EXTREME cases of max damage - other than that, yes, totally agree w/your post.

whitesprings (nuked or not) and any quest/event that will have legendary enemies (like uranium fever)

Huh, maybe a turret accidentally got a shot on him or his cow ??

Hes saved my ass before. Made my first workshop when I was rank 20ish and had a raid of lvl 50 super mutants attack me.  Grahm then came by and 1 shot all of them for me :')

That's hilarious.  I just came across that corpse and thought what a compromising position.  Well played.

Thx. World is full but I‚Äôll wait in the queue and hope to join.

You go to whitesprings is how i did it their is normaly 6 to 10 legendaries there per run

Buddy of mine said he had noticed a few different breeds. The cats are not consistent.
---
 Sometimes you get 2 black cats, a tabby, and a housecat. Other times it's 2 housecats, 1 black cat and a tabby. 
---
Interested if there are other cats in game like maybe a white one or tom cat. Haven't seen the named ones yet either. 
---
I got my Nuka Clock from the wandering robot vendor near charleston
---
Totally agree with this. The sense of in-game community is lacking. I get wanting to give the game a feel of isolation, but a game that‚Äôs solely online needs something more. The idea of the vendor machine hub would help, especially if the machines are made indestructible. 
---
What do you mean gone?   I agree totally that TSE needed a major nerf, but, it should still be a "powerful" weapon, just not insane like it was with Max Demolition perk.
---
Basically, they should make Demolition not work w/TSE, and nerf it [the TSE damage base] some.
---
Perhaps what we're truly looking at is the Exodia set. Too bad no one will ever find the right arm.. 
---
I believe the there is no timer, I‚Äôve played many hours straight with the same crit still being available afaik. When you log off it does degrade but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just instant or over time.
---
The amount of hits needed is based off I think agility, the weapon, and there are perks that help it as well.
---
Actually they do more damage than an stock assault rifle when you first craft one. Mine was like 30 damage above the one I saw.
---
Im so mature and adult I keep replying
---
Err i guess.
---
Having 1k rad res as an outfit is crazy to me.
---
What no. Why?
---
life imitates art :)
---
I thought that was fixed
---
The bug is that a "Hardened .50 Receiver" is missing from the game.
---
They don't have to be? With enough damage resistance and drowning enough of myself with stims, it doesn't even matter if they shoot me that often. Top that with PvP usually being triggered by someone instigating, its on *my* terms when its time to fight... and the fight starts when I'm in VATS range.
---
It becomes a game where they use 300 bullets on me, then they die, at my cost of 15 stims.
---
Yeah, I had a lot of fun with PVP until min/max douchebags found was to get stupidly high extreme damage that just always kills you in one shot.  It's not a game at that point, it's ***NOT FUN*** at that point.  The *purpose* of a game, is to have fun.  Not to get fucked by some douchebag who basically exploits flaws in the game design to achieve insanely high damage...
---

Love the blurb about them acknowledging the weak justifucations for abusing exploits.
---
there has only been 1,472 PSA about this previously.   
---
Same thing happened to me earlier, can confirm
---
It's fun, greatly different gameplay to melee. Having to get close to do as much damage as possible per shot then possibly needing to pull back &amp; wait as the mob chasing you calms down enough for you to go in and start picking dudes off is exhilerating. The joy of managing to execute several high level super mutants in a row without being discovered brings different exhilaration.

Without more than just a few "Rifelman" perks (didn't have Tank Killer, stealth bonus Perks etc.) I was able to 1 - 2 shot kill Super Mutants up until I was over level 50 with "just" a max level .308 Hardened Sniper Rifle.
---
I had the MOST fun in the game when I hit level 15 and could finally use my first such Sniper Rifle.  Then, when I was around level 60, my beloved Sniper Rifle felt weaker than the pellet air rifle you'd buy your kid to plink in the back yard.  I had to hit a *fucking rat* like 5 - 6 times to kill it - W T F?!?!

Oh, absolutely. If melee nerf comes in form of nerf to stacking, that works too. Trouble is, stacking nerf will affect everybody, though not necessarily to the same degree. I mean, this same low-HP build can be applied to ranged. It won't work as well as melee, but it'll work (you'll basically end up with 90% hit rate at any range to the body). So nerfing stacking will just kill those, but relatively speaking melee will remain the strongest. 
---
And yes, melee really does require a lot of work to get a build going. But once it's built, it is completely out of hand. That's why TSEs were so popular, you need one item - the gun - and tone perk, that's it. 
---
And yes, there's a huge discrepancy in the number of things that assist melee builds, vs the ranged. Mutations heavily favour melee, and don't do much for ranged, especially non-VATS ranged. A lot of mutations that are seen as "anti-melee" in the sense that ranged players can use them against melee players, still work *for* melee players against their enemies. Most enemies in this game, by a fair margin, are melee. All animals, and among the few things that attack from range (scorched, skaven, supermuties), many will still run at you with a melee weapon. And melee builds *want* to be in melee, and many enemies will even stop shooting and start weapon-bashing you when you get close. All of which benefits melee.
---
Remember when FO3 was announced, and people called it Oblivion with guns? This game is totally Oblivion with guns. The core mechanics still favour melee. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a complete melee-fest is literally ONE enemy type - Scorchbeasts. And even those land eventually. 
---
I just don't see melee staying the way it is. It's too easy, too hassle-free, too strong. Too many people get fed up diddling with ammo, and constantly repairing guns, and go melee.
---
I could be totally off though. I remember playing WoW in early days of Arena, where 97% of top teams had precisely one shaman in them. And 4% had a feral druid. And I thought no way would developers be dumb enough to nerf druids. But they did. So, who knows. If devs really like melee, it could happen. One theory early on was that we're ALL meant to be melee to some degree. Think Walking Dead - guns when you are closing in, then melee to completion. Which is why the game is built so much for melee (mutations, consummables). Meh, who knows.
---
Set a limit on how much damage an attack can do on a player, don't let it ever be a 1 hit kill unless it's a sneak surprise critical attack (melee) or sniper headshot, or nuke.
---
bad bot :(
---
This is one of the reasons I put down the game in early December. Gonna pick it up after a few months have gone by and some of this stuff gets cleaned up and the ban wagon calms down.

Yes.  I'd say among the New Vegas faithful, Dead Money is revered, predominantly because the story and the characters are great.  And, if you're a NV fan, that's all you tend to care about.
---
It's a weird phenomenon because, at the time, it was a highly divisive DLC.  I maintain it still is, but you'd never know it from r/Fallout.  I can accept that the story and characters are great, but the gameplay was a pedantic, bottom-of-the-barrel attempt at stealth.
---
I‚Äôve been using a TSE Combat Shotgun for about a month now. No chems, no bobble heads, no buffs of any kind other than perk cards focusing on shotguns and the damage rating on the gun is 1200. It is so unbelievably OP that I one shot entire groups of mobs with one shell. The range is only 72, it‚Äôs very easy to blow yourself up if you‚Äôre not careful, and the damage against the queen is terrible due to her near immunity to explosive damage, but the bottomline is the prefixes need to be adjusted.
---
Awesome =D Just give me a holler if you see me online when you log in later tonight then! 
---
They should simply put a limit on the max amount of damage a player can do to another player unless it's 1) A Mini Nuke, 2) A surprise critical hit from behind (Melee) or 3) A Sniper Headshot (if you want, make it have to be from Stealth to be a 1-hit kill).
---
Solid
---
Luck helps the critical build rate iirc
---
You‚Äôll still be able to tag enemies, they‚Äôre not changing the radius. Melee is no comparison to a TSE weapon that does AoE damage.
---
I haven't seen any difference, but good god with BGS anybodies guess.
---
I got plans second try on patrol duty
---
Just limit the max damage that a PVP attack can do, eliminate 1 shot kills.  Because they simply aren't fun - we can go play "instagib" in some other game if we wanted that.

You standing exactly in the center of the blast zone when the bomb drops?

It's good to have the option because if you're trying to join a server that your team is playing on you might rather join then everybody server hop.

and if your team has bases all over the place there could be a potential need to server hop a lot to find one for all.

That's the first time it's happened to me.  All I can say is that it was an epic fight.

Yeah good forbid you gotta walk a couple minutes to farm materials. Why don't they just give you unlimited materials and make it like Minecraft creator mode too!

What is PA doing to our characters hands?! My God man...
---
Would love this and have made similar suggestions but I really don‚Äôt think the creation engine is good enough to do this properly. If it did they would‚Äôve done it already 
---
So you are saying one shotting things is fun, and Bethesda just fixed dupers, they are trying to make tse not one shot, the bugs may still be there but it isnt as bad as the start of the game.
---
Just calm down, we like this game and you saying things we already know isn't going to help your case.

Q

You must not be able to pick up chicks, because if you could you wouldn't be attempting to (and failing) to troll a subreddit for a game that you don't like. If you could pick up chicks I think you'd be too busy to act like a child in the way that you are, but whatever help you sleep at night guy.
---
Dumb question, how do you find how many hours you have in game?
---
Rifle Gaming is a duper tho
---
Are the small water purifiers able to be placed? 
---
That's cool of you, man. But really they'll still be the top dps rolls on ranged weapons. Maybe should have kept one. I guess you could get a bloodied fire rate

Just pretend it's .50 Beowulf.
---
It would be better if players built a hub. In front of / beside where 76 is? cool.
---
I don't want to go back in it.
---
Scorched animals also seems to have a certain resistance to ballistic and physical attacks as well. A scorched mirelurk took 20 rounds from a 50 Cal in it's face before it started to take damage. Deathclaws are even more tanky.

Thank you for this post by the way. I currently use a tse gauss rifle and my max damage output at low health and all perks geared towards it is 1.7k so I'm still hopefully going to be seeing over 1k but just barely if my math is right. My gauss is lvl 45 or 50 what is yours? Also does yours have a third perk? Mine has 250 damage resistance when reloading. My math might be wrong and that's at half health with adrenal and no strange in numbers, I think I could push it to 2k with the right set up. 
---
I would‚Äôve but im done untill they stop nerfing the game and  or  finish balancing the game
---
Hey, I hear you :-)   Just wanted confirmation that at least one other person had seen one today.
---
I have a couple buddies going to a 24 hour Lan event this weekend that starts in a couple hours that they plan to play some fallout 76 at. I was just curious if you where gonna be at the same event because of the timing lol
---
Rifle gaming on YouTube has been nuking different areas looking for spawns like whitesprings and legendary enemies. He nuked Monongah town today and had very good results. But other than that I haven‚Äôt heard of any other good places to nuke. 
---
Where do I get this nifty doodad? 
---
Patrol duty garrenteed gun plans, got handmade 2nd try from it
---
This has happened to me multiple times, usually just have to sit around for a few minutes and let the game unfuck itself so I can continue
---
No I'm at home (:
---
Hmmm, that‚Äôs one thing I have not tried- thanks for the suggestion!
---
You can hop out of another empty frame, attach it, and then it should recall if I remember correctly. 
---
Yeah, they still exist. CONSIDER IT CONFIRMED! lol
---
I'd like to say I did The Messenger once, and that was enough.  But that would be a lie.  After a few of us dealt with the Scorchbeast south of Whitesprings, I noticed some of them were following Mr. Messenger.  So I joined in.  And it didn't take long before he went off the road and became permanently stuck against a log.
---
There's nothing fun about following a slow-moving Mr. Handy.  It's even worse when it's a Protectron.
---
That may help to explain [this poor fella](https://imgur.com/eDnK9AY)
---
Hey maybe once I get better gear and can play melee at full strength I'll agree w everything you first suggested. For now w what I have I'm not seeing it. Again though I changed to melee at lvl 100 so I'm sure that has something to do w my stance about it. Ammo! Lol 100% the reason I made the change. I miss my old build it was a hell of a lot more fun the melee.
---
I remember the feral druid nerf. Ha and then when they over buffed them. Fun times but I can't complain I mained a rogue. 
---
Let's see what they do. I really won't be suprised if melee gets a nerf next. I just hope they do it right. Or instead buff some other areas instead. 
---
Whitesprings is all garbage drops.
---
Just play the game. I just walked into sunnytop station and found a 3* legendary 3* metal chest piece. The ghouls at Whitesprings don't drop anything good.
---
Tried your solution and it worked, I'm so happy I can play again. Thanks :)

I've also seen them at the northern most raider vendor and sometimes at the Harper's Ferry vendor.
---
Thank you so much. I had no idea it would be that large. 
---
Every time I searched I kept coming up with results on how to glitch the regular connectors through walls. That's all well and good but not what I was looking for. 
---
Thanks again man!
---
lol
---
Come back after a content patch, there will be more things to do
---
I'm inclined to think if it's not in patch notes, it didn't happen. Plus I don't remember it happening. I remember explosive weapons being ridiculously OP. I remember Bleeding weapons being ridiculously OP. I don't remember any balancing or nerfs. And then I skimmed patch notes, and couldn't find it either.
---
But I see where we disagree. You view progression as escalation. That is not what I said. Think of it as a binary counter. It goes from 0 to 15. Four switches. And the rules never change. All switches down, we're at 0. Moving from the right, is the switch up? No. Flip it up, and flip all switches to the right of it down. We're at 1. Repeat. Moving in from the right again, is the switch up? Yes. Move to next switch. Is the switch up? No. Flip it up, and flip all switches to the right of it down. We're at 2. Repeat. Moving in from the right again, is the switch up? No. Flip it up, and flip all siwtches to the right of it down. We're at 3. At this point, first 2 switches from the left are down, two switches from the right are up. That's 3 in binary. That's how it works. Do you see the phrase "Is the switch up? No. Flip it up, and flip all the switches to the right of it down"? This phrase never changes, that's how it works. There's no escalation here. But you ARE progressing from 1, to 2, to 3. Get it now? You are attributing escalation to progression. I'm telling you, it doesn't exist. It's the same logical steps being applied to the same situation, over and over. 
---
Still no slopes here, slippery or otherwise. Sorry.

Shredder barrel is love. Shredder barrel is life.

Maybe with an alt i started recently, but i cost 1 cap per week which is not negotiable.

Yea im going to start a mew character at that point and have fun that way

Actually I think that guys name is Paul Ryan, a self proclaimed important figure of the Republican Party in American politics. I've seen him on TV. 
---
I haven't walked away, but I have stopped bothering to launch nukes. Felt bad leaching off others' SBQs the other day and ran through Bravo, nuked prime, dumped a few thousand rounds of ultracite .50 into that bitch, and then got disconnected after bringing her health bar more than halfway down following her health refresh. 
---
Said fuck it, no more nukes for me for a patch or so.
---
You're welcome! I'm a woman, though. üòò
---
For the lazy:
---
&gt;We recognize these exploits are currently ‚Äúpart of the game‚Äù and we know we need to make fixes, but it doesn‚Äôt mean taking advantage of them is acceptable. It‚Äôs why players must specifically agree not to take advantage of them when they acknowledge the Terms of Service and Code of Conduct¬†
---
What if 2 caps per week (;
---
Region : NA West ( I'm online often)
---
Character:  I'm lvl I think 107 don't really even pay attention after lvl 50. Name is Enzth.
---
Playstyle: I pretty much just shoot the shit with people that are like minded an build CAMPS for hours such as http://imgur.com/gallery/806clCH or http://imgur.com/gallery/byHn3Tn
---
Sometimes grab workshops an farm some nukes occasionally.
---
Hit me up I'm down for whatver.
---
It‚Äôs damn solid with armor penetration mods or the legendary effect.
---
But still, that shouldn‚Äôt be required to make it usable 
---
This is actually great

You're welcome, but I'm a woman. üòò

Is that all it took to get your panties in a bunch...
---
‚ÄúHahaha‚Äù
---
Because there are those who wouldn‚Äôt be able to differentiate between plans and the actual gun.
---
Now pull your panties up, dry your eyes and go get angry somewhere else dick...
---
Rip
---
There definitely needs to be something. I‚Äôve rebought plans because I couldn‚Äôt remember if I had it or not. Was there anything in fo4 that was the equivalent?
---
Is this the Flatwoods monster I still am yet to encounter???
---
Wouldn't know what to do with that kind of moolah
---
Awwww man that's horrible!
---
Try getting a .50 Cal receiver! :P Seriously though, it does help, your ammo costs drop significantly, and your damage not all that much. Heck, there was a point I was using a .38 Two-Shot pipe rifle, just because I was running out of ammo. I was just too lazy to transfer ammo from my melee chars to the ranged. 
---
 Was up there yesterday and considered that as my new CAMP. Instead I just moved it down the hill towards Watoga a bit. There is so much water up there. You could have strings of CAMPS all through that area.
---
 I moved it from a very popular spot at the top pond down to a nice spot on the really long pond below it.
---
Me too. They should have made stashes not have weight, but only at camps and then take away fast travel and make the camp super expensive to move. Also when you die, you should have to spawn back at camp and trek the whole way back to your body to retrieve your weapons and armor (Unless you wisely stashed a backup in your camp) And then they should have a health regenerating deathclaw that randomly spawns and starts hunting you wherever you are on the server. People would definitely travel in groups then.
---
"Boss" enemies (or "Alphas" in the game's terminology) can also spawn additional enemies until they are killed.
---
O:

Well it's got monster wood, but it sure as shit aint flat!

If you‚Äôre shooting bullets out of your minigun, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.

Chill out mate its just a game lool
---
I'm on PC and was dcing constantly, post patch I've seen two total.
---
I'm a bit disappointed there are no mods for it with the exception of Prime Receiver.  
---
It says it does 94 damage, but actually did that per cell used. Farm more, one-shot SBQ, revel in glory (and ultracite explosive vent plans)
---
So is your name like adoom or is it like a doom?
---
It all depends how perk cards affect damage.  Like in that math above it may all be wrong if perk cards are applied after the legendary effects, or before the legendaries.
---
My character retired there after completing all the main and side quests. No I run a way station for travelers in need between the light house and slocum‚Äôs joe. Love it there. Lots of players stop by to chat.

General (probably unrelated) observation: When I get a really slow render of the camp, the turrets appear long before any of the other items. It‚Äôs such a long delay compared to the other items, I have to think there must me a considerable amount of housekeeping that has to take place when they are created in world...
---
This explains why the blast from the assaultron is so damaging.
---
I can only produce metal armor chests and arms, if you wanted to provide the plans or roughly 5 sets of level 50 metal armor I'd be happy to try it again. I'm simply limited within my crafting means.
---
At some point I wanna try all level 45/50 pistols and armor though with more likely 20-100 shots each. Just not sure when since that's 80-400 shots and alot of gun/armor repair not to mention recording and organizing the data.
---
Why do you think they also nerfed xp again?
---
I stalked you last week but you were too busy camping
---
Ign is the Same, can add me if you want. I'm on Aus time, but you'll probably regret it. I'm quite an ass, descended from a long line of magnificent  asses.
---
Make a new character and try again.  J had to for some achievements because my character was from beta and there were no achievements for beta.  I didnt auto get them when the official release dropped either, so.  Yeah try making a new guy and give another go.  Good luck.
---
the first one. it was a childhood nickname and at the time I did a lot of tcg card trading so Adoomistrading was born.
---
Oh lmao sorry (':
---
I find that it's an incredible game hand crafted for character building freaks and oldschool adventure gamers.
---
Narrative games satisfy the treasure hunting style if they are filled with secrets and branching paths, and often also inextricably contain the vast open feeling, but not always. Wolfenstein and doom were filled with bonus areas and finds without being branching or player building, but had the deep darkness that violent gaming made available to the earliest PC gamers. Only when fallout came along did the feeling of character building merge into these, for an interesting and entertaining experience where killing everything in sight wasn't the only approach available to tackle the challenge and obtain the secrets. RPG players began to thirst for greater customization and the ability to build cities and housing in the online gaming setting, but modern games failed to deliver this or often even self sabotaged their attempts to become player choice driven... you can look at the whole spectrum of games from the earliest MMOs, to SWG, to bioware RPGs, to warcraft and the absurd mishap of the garrison and so forth, wildstar's rise and fall. City of heroes. Now here we are in fallout and while we don't have a collaborative/ongoing base to level up yet, just a mobile outpost, its still way way beyond almost everything that came before and its fallout true to the roots of player determined role playing. Comin up on 200 slow play hours of the best PC gaming in a very long time for me.
---
Noice
---
I moved CAMP, and found I was at 157% budget when I put it down.  I'd only been at 50.  
---
Game had triplicated my entire CAMP into my budget.  I had 34 corn, FFS...
---
I get it. You didn't directly observe it therefore it doesn't exist. Like I said, popular way of thinking.
---
Still a slope. We have 0 things nerfed. The announcement suggests we will have 2 things nerfed so that the TSE combo is less strong. So your speculation is melee is next, followed by bloodied, etc, because going from 0 to 4 is not an increase in magnitude but merely a sequence.
---
Wait.
---
Slippery slope. There's no actual reason to believe the sequence you presented has any reason to occur and the sequence is all conjecture.
---
Slippery slope present.
---
‚ÄúClip‚Äù
---
Oi same lol
---
Last night I sat on the porch of my CAMP and watched some robots duke it out with a massive mutant. The moment the mutant won and came after my CAMP I server hopped 
---
Maybe if if the QA was better they wouldn‚Äôt have to acknowledge these problems in the first place 
---
They have what I assume is a 20# sledge with a magical 90% reduction soooooo...we can't hold this up to real world standards. 
---
The ONLY question that was asked is:
---
"When I join a random server why even waste my time ‚Äì just put me on a server where my camp is available?"
---
You're response was to point out the SAME exact thing the OP said - it's nice that this is an option if you want to join your friends server.
---
So....
---
"Why even place me on a server where my camp cannot be placed?"
---
you need armor piercing magazine attachments. It goes such a long way.
---
But in general yes, there are no shortage of weapons that need some love.
---
Good luck mate!

Add me gm. Like username

What plans are the neon letters?

---
I was wondering if your intel is pretty high, and you have contractor perk, shouldn‚Äôt you already get some discount on construction?
---
Ok
---
Oof. Man, this is a new character. I put my beta character to the side when I didn‚Äôt like my build. I don‚Äôt know why it did the same thing that a beta might. 
---
Yeah, ammo. I'm starting to wonder if the devs didn't make a mistake with that one.
---
Everyone I talk to says they just loooove how much fun Heavy Guns are....as long as you have ammo to feed them! And then I think back to the recent shooters I played, and in most of them ammo isn't a factor, not really. In The Division, for example, ammo drops like rain, and every dungeon has crates that when you interact with them completely replenish all of your ammo to full. You get to just have fun shooting, and don't worry about ammo at all.
---
I kinda wish they did this in this game as well. If they absolutely HAD to give us survival elements, they should have made food and water more relevant. Both are trivial right now. Pick up Lead Belly and Cannibal, and you pretty much never have to carry food or water again, with a few rare exceptions. You can just drink from the river and eat whoever you kill. But ammo? Forcing us to keep making it is just another loop for us to hop through. And with some weapons, it's just not sustainable, a minigun will waste ammo faster than anyone can make it. A TSE minigun was fine. Normal minigun really doesn't work. And LMG is an absolute joke, it wastes .308 like it grows on trees, but if you try to craft it, it only makes them in increments of 12. That's a few seconds of shooting the LMG. 
---
This! I'm so confused about plans. Which ones do I have. Which ones don't I have. I want them all but I don't know how to deal! Ahhhhhhhhh!
---
Relax man, it's not real. It's just pixels and code.
---
my IGN is Doomy76 if you wanna add me though, Granted im 12 hours behind Aussie time, but still.
---
Energy weapon durability in general needs a buff. 
---
Did you miss my second point?
---
Maybe you need it explained a little bit better. Let's say you put your camp in really popular spot where everyone else has camps. If you didn't have the option you would basically keep a waiting for a server forever.
---
Niiccceee!
---
Okay sis (:
---
Like maybe if there was a way to break them down or trade them into a robot somewhere that gave you a specific legendary crafting material? And then a machine somewhere (or maybe recipes/plans, but that might be just yet another thing to grind lol) to let you use the materials to apply properties to your existing gear. Might be interesting for them to finally address an in-universe reason for legendary properties lol
---
Nice post with some good information I can definitely use. Thank you! 
---
The. Fuck?
---
This is great, what system? Id love to stop by
---
Are you offering? 
---
Sis, yeah. sis. Right..
---
Ya it's insane how hard it can be sometimes to shower lower level players in hand-me-downs and extra Chems/Ammo ü§¶
---
Hold x on said objects
---
That's exactly what I did last time I saw one of these.  It didn't obliterate the entire base tho, so then also went in on it just targeting things like workbenches...ended up with a 240 cap bounty but it was sooo satisfying.
---
If it means anything, I refer to my wife as "man" all the time. "Yes man! , cool man! Awesome man!" 
---
No spot is like that.
---
Any time I've ever ran into the issue I had to just hop once or twice to get a server that's fine. This is a hypothetical issue. Do you know how many servers they have going at any given time? Can you break this hypothetical issue down with some stats like given the amount of servers and the popularity of certain locations, at any time it may take an average of x hops?
---
We don't solve for problems we don't fucking have and can't fucking measure.
---
&gt; the next Bethesda game should just be single player. I had more fun back then.
---
I just play it as single player anyway.  A single player mode that disconnects from server all the time and has terrible netcode.
---
I find most of the fun in building up new characters with different builds. Fun way to play, especially when new content drops.
---
Id believe a handmade with 85 rounds is ahout 20 pounds i got an sks with out any rounds is 11 
---
I call everyone sis (((:
---
[Their website](https://www.liquorama.net/nuka-dark-rum-750ml.html) doesn't make any reference to the materials, but the simple fact is there are no pictures of the interior bottle.  They created a label for the bottle with a different font and everything, so they obviously wanted it be seen, but they don't show it anywhere.  
---
At best, I'd say it is a failure in licensing and advertising.  At worst, a shitty ploy to capitalize on fans and collectors.  
---
And are you telling me that Bethesda would just sign off on any freaking thing with Fallout on it?  No, they definitely had an idea what would be sold, and they obviously didn't care that it was a plastic bottle.  Which is *fine*, but I'd argue that any Fallout customer, when presented with this opportunity, would say "I dunno... our fans would really prefer a glass bomb-shaped bottle" which goes to show that Bethesda doesn't understand their playerbase or doesn't care.
---
You mean IRL, not in Fallout 76.
---
I agree I‚Äôve seen and operated a browning .50 bmg there is difference.
---
But, this is a game and laws of physics and gravity don‚Äôt necessarily apply.
---
I was confused because I don't remember ass-eating being in the beginning of that video.
---
/am old
---
I wish the real world worked like this so someone below or above you woke up first and you just didn't exist anymore.
---
just for clarification, i tried with multiple weapons not just an explosive one, the anti armor assault rifle had the same issues.  i only used the explosive combat rifle as an example of a weapon that does large amount of damage.
---
this would've been popular amongst twelve year olds in 2010, but "trolling" videos really aren't entertaining to any other audience. 
---
You make us all fucking a bit dumber every time you talk.
---
That's crazier than a coconut...
---
If Bethesda put it in the game it would be weaker than 10mm, look what they did to .50cal!
---
Dude. I found that cave in beta and have spent many hours searching for it since. I thought it might have just been a dream haha. Thanks for the reassurance
---
All armor pieces with deep pockets and having any weight reducing prefixs or just havjng perks 
---
How is this still a problem?
---
There was 20 table plans you could learn 
---
One crafting station, naaaaaaaaaaaaah.    
---
You can build an outlandishly large CAMP on what we're given.  I had a 3x2 base floor with all crafting stations, a cooking station outside.  
---
I had a 2x3 room full of generators upstairs, sectioned off from a 3x4 sleeping area.  and a 4x5 top floor with all instruments and a PA station.  
---
I also had a Junk collector.  I then built a 2x2 fully walled and covered port-o-potty and bathtub outhouse.
---
It's pretty clear most of us only want TSE's nerfed for players, or at the very least much less than an 80% nerf for PvE.Hopefully Bethesda will see this and the many other threads and change it up before they ruin the game for us
---
You can skip the part by picklocking a door and hacking a terminal.
---

A quick fix is to drop all your  fusion cells then pick them back up. I can't recall if it resets to the bugged state if you put it away and draw it again. I lost all my fusion cells once to an Instigating one I found.. and I missed. 10/10 assaultron'd from beyond the grave.

My level 35 2* explosive double barrel(not two shot) with only 3 points into demo expert can 1 shot a lvl 91 glowing death claw from 200 yards no problem. Explosive is broken as hell, it is way to powerful.  
---
Have a seat at my table, then!!
---
Wasn't that the overseer's goal and what we're all meant to be doing anyway? 
---
The only problem is that you can't build CAMPs close together. 
---
No. Go look before posting. 
---
There are black "towers". Around 6 of em.
---
Didnt rhe recent patch notes say that they buffed all weapon damage?
---
This is the most amazing thing I've seen today, thank you for bringing it to my attention lol
---
I figured haha. have fun!
---
If i for example had, a set of metal or marine, with the reduced weight prefix, put deep pocketed on them, would that leave me with positive weight from the set or negative, not sure about the numbers :/
---
I had troubles with it too.

Go right to the radioactive symbol at the center.

---
Ugh xbox screwed again thanks Microsoft you can power almost every pc but not get easier mods for xbox
---
Trade you a table for a table? 
---
You too :)
---
This, deep pockets and weight reduction perks or armors with weight reductions and deep pockets along with perks. I actually prefer to run without PA because of the quicker movement speed. 
---
You know, I tried. I got bored of how much idling I was doing with my friends because every 5 minutes someone was inventory dumping and screaming about missing out on a legendary ghoul.
---
So I set off on my own for a few sessions, and i am constantly being greifed. My Xmas "welcome newbs" base was flattened within 20 minutes of placement. Any useful workshop I grab is stolen by someone with a 2 shot explosive or bobblehead glitching, and it destroys my power armor so I have to go farm known spots for springs and aluminum, which is fucking boring.
---
Its been a fun run, but I've done pretty much everything and I'd rather go play modded 4 or Skyrim now that MP is almost done.

 Alright I got that mod. Should help a lot. I have all the Marine Armor stuff to score and I have some and kinda stopped till I hit level 35 and can make it as I'm not sure what I've read. ;)
---
 Thanks man.
---
Seriously, man, everyones bitching is going to kill this game. Everyone wants their hand held. 
---
It really should have been the bobble stack that they fixed, they just ruined a perfectly viable PvE weapon.
---
They could have nerfed it for just PvP if that was the case, but instead its ruined for everyone.
---
Glad we agreed.
---
Trade u 3 tAbles for 2 
---
Deep pockets lets you carry 10 more pounds per armor peice and weight reduction does as says but having one or 2 weapon ones isnt bad junk ammo and chems are the high tier 
---
You're awfully snarky for someone who can't provide an image _or_ a specific location for what he's talking about.
---
Crit would be irrelevant if you weren't doing damage. As someone else said he could have been wearing a bunch of sentinel and assassin stuff. Hell maybe something happened and you weren't hostile to him anymore or something. I don't know the specifics because I wasn't there but I'm just trying to let you know not to jump straight to "hes cheating." It is possible for this stuff occur legitimately. It is also possible he WAS cheating. I just wouldn't assume right away 
---
No, we don't need every weapon in the game to 1 shot basically everything but the SBQ. It is stupid. Nerf explosive and two shot as planned and either nerf melee OR nerf power armor. Melee shouldn't be so powerful while also being indestructible.
---
I didn't observe it. You claim to have. I asked for patch notes. You told me to go fish. I fished. I didn't catch it. Therefore, based on all available evidence, I concluded it probably doesn't exist. You can end all this is you can just find me the patch notes with the nerf in them. You choose not to. What do you want from me? To believe hearsay, contrary to all available evidence? That too seems a very popular way of thinking in certain circles. *cough* /r/theworldisflat *cough*.
---
Going from 0 to 3 is a progression, and we are doing it one switch at a time. The process is the same. Where are are (at 0, at 1, at 2) changes. For it to be a slippery slope, once first switch is flipped, we'd next flip 2 switches, then 4! Anarchy! No. It's a progression. And it's logical. If we went from zero to five, yes, that would be snowballing.
---
At this point I think you're just intentionally being obtuse and pedantic. 
---
It is safe.
---
The message is very poorly written.
---
Putting the new paint on destroys the old paint.
---
It is referring to the paint as a mod.
---
Nuclear football
---
I see. You make some valid points. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt get nerfed too hard as it‚Äôs not my primary attack but it‚Äôs good to have some muscle when the bullets aren‚Äôt enough.
---
I agree and disagree. I don't think we can building 'outlandishly' large camps, certainly nowhere near what was possible in FO4. You can tell the struggle is there because a lot of the shared home posts are rather low detail. But we can certainly build a cool place with what's available, as many have done. That's why I said the crafting suggestion is just for people like me who want the most aesthetic value, since stations are medium consumption. :3
---
Oh and generators are low cost so building a lot is fine if you need the power. But again, if you want to maximize your budget for aesthetic purposes, you do save a little chunk by avoiding generators/conduits/the items that use power entirely. 
---
Ah roger, thanks man, ill have a look into collecting some weightless armor and deep pocket mods :)
---
OK, but only if you take 6 modern tables and a an office couch.  I can't give them away
---
You just made my day.
---
Side note:  So would this maybe be a workaround for the herbivore mutaution? Toss salad technically is a vegetarian food I guess ;) 
---
Flux is under the Aid tab. You likely still have it in your inventory. Go stabilize it before it spoils.
---
xoxo
---
You want longitude and GPS? 
---
I'm pretty crystal about where they are and what they look like. üëç
---
Yes please!
---
Thanks! I server hopped forever to get Kinetic servos for my second X01 build and didnt install them after I changed the paint. Didnt want to lose it. 
---
It shouldn't be spending 2 days of collecting mats to make ammo just to use it up in a 20 minute SBQ fight. I'm exaggerating a bit there but not much.
---
They need to re tune a lot about this game or it's not going to last. And too bad because I do like it. Seems like they didn't think things out very well. I don't even bother w those 2 perks you mentioned. I have a farm and purifiers and I'm good. I used to have other perks for eating/drinking but took them off once it became trivial to have a steady supply of food and water.
---
The more that I think about it maybe the first thing they should look at is the ammo grind. It really is terrible. 
---
Weight less is when the armor weights 90% less and can have weight reducing perks as well its probably the best for player hoarding 
---
Honestly you gotta change how you play the game.
---
I run a rifle vats build with 3 str and 180 weight. I carry 2 guns and that's it.
---
My 3 str is for chem weight reduction atm but I'm weaning myself off that by only carrying chems i use. 10 stims,10 radaway, 5 diluted radx, next too no buff ones.
---
Thru hiker is my other perk but i have a hard time not having 5x too much water on me.
---
I hover at 100/180 for normal play. 
---
Gattery Pack
---
Nah man he means stable 
---
 Yeah I have done one on my higher level char and I forget what, but I did get something useful for my CAMP. 
---
They have answered your wishes!
---
I kill nearly everything for their meat though I do feel a tinge of guilty on the ones who aren't actually hostile even if labeled a such. The only thing I have left completely alone are cats which is odd since I think they are cute but sociopaths. Some creatures I have started to leave alone more often. I will always kill frogs. Those little guys are a nice source of uranium.
---
No
---
What's ridiculous is that after WEEKS of dupes, I got three plans I didn't know from Lakeshore Cabins, today.  SMH
---
You're a dick, I was ganna help you out but you can figure it out for yourself now.
---
Wonder if those 5000 cells would've one shot the sbq?
---
Dude nobody can see exactly what you mean. Post a picture instead of being an ass
---
Air purifiers i think.
---
Going to them is nothing though.
---
Its like the dog on the map in the savage divide. There isn't a giant dog there
---
Yea i got bored being op rile anyways and i want to try something new when new content comes out
---
Ha, just realized there's a "Display Name" I can set.
---
Damn it,. Already duped and for sale on eBay lol
---
I bought the skeleton costume from the roaming Charleston vendor. 
---
Wowza!
---
I couldnt even tell ya what they are i just looked as well time to make a G A M E  T H E O R Y
---
Heh.
---
Haha fuckin gotem!
---
LOL
---
Nah dude I swear I found all 6900 of them legit. 
---
Automatic weapons already received one buss. It just wasn't enough.
---
Also your pal who comment seems very freindly 
---
Shush, you're not fitting the narrative being pushed here.
---
Me and all of my fellow hoarders are still waiting for the stash limit increase, over 600. 
---
It just works.
---
I'm also an asshole!
---
I'm GMT -5 though. :-(
---
I can end you not having experienced something? That doesn't make sense, friend. As mentioned, you can do your own research into explosives in Fallout 4 since you have decided it does not exist. I don't need to help with your denial. It doesn't change anything.
---
At this point I think you just think trying to argue the meaning of a slippery slope somehow strengthens an argument to nerf melee next.
---
It's a slippery slope.
---
I did it right out of the Vault! Level 2 and just stumbled through a magic portal!!!
---
When people realize how little thought was put into this game they will hopefully just move on and let it die like it was meant to. 
---
If were being honest if anything miniguns should weigh 40 plus 
---
Enjoy Prison!
---
Shit
---
Because the game isn't going to poll hundreds of servers to find you a spot.
---
That polling done for every player with all the server hopping going on would bring the already shakey servers to its knees
---
The funny thing is when they first announced the update they said this it would prompt you if the camp wont work on the server and give you the option to choose to join or not.
---
What we actually got was you join a servers wait for it to load only to then be told that it's not there and have to join another server anyway...
---
I'm not looking for too much reality in a game that has flying scorch monsters, but I would like a little. At least 10 hairpins don't weigh 1 pound anymore
---
What system you playing on. I got this on PS4 no problem. Just stood near center of blast. 
---
I doubt it, when it happened to me I had 1300+ rounds hit a charred ghoul and only took 1/3 of its health 
---
Yeah, I've been thinking about The Division more and more, especially its survival mode. It was pretty interesting. You start in a snowstorm, with a gun, and nothing else. Get too far away from fires for too long, you freeze to death. So you run around and find food, water, meds, guns, ammo, clothing. The entire time you're competing with other players in the zone, because all these items are unique spawns. And PvP is a thing, obviously. So if someone ran ahead of you, and grabbed a winter coat, you now have to seriously think about murdering them, because you can't get too far from the fires, but you already cleared all the areas you could reach, and you really need that coat. At no point during all this was I worried about ammo (pistol ammo in Division is infinite). It still pays to get other guns, but pistols are still perfectly viable, in fact one of the more fun builds is pistol and ballistic shield. They did survival elements very well (cold, food, water, disease) without having to force us to farm or craft ammo. Kinda wishing FO76 did the same thing. I should really send it in as a suggestion. Doubt they'll do it, but it's not the worst idea in the world (unlike chainmail condom). 
---
I don't know why, but that's hilarious.
---
I'm guessing that's my issue. I'll stand dead center
---
Maybe mine headshafts?
---
That was my thinking, but couldn't find anything at the spots o.O
---
Finally. Way too many people have been nuking whitesprings lately. The last 40 nukes were whitesprings!
---
I can't tell if I'm not using them right or if they just have a really short range.
---
EMPTY. Add on 250 rounds of .204 Ruger and it only goes up.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a 204.  Only 5mm I know of that would make sense and work in an AR type rifle (there was such a rifle in FO:NV that uses 5mm). 
---
 Finally. Way too many people have been nuking whitesprings lately. The last 40 nukes were whitesprings! 
---
I bet. I'm not a gun person but i got a feeling 500 5mm weights alot.
---
Or 250 .50cal. 
---
Iirc those are the "magazine" sizes in game.
---
# "For the time you want literally everything in camouflage patterns", Ok but this literally only applies to one thing.
---
I said it before and I'll say it again. Weapon paint should apply to many guns, if not \*all\* of them. I'm not paying 500 atoms for a skin for 1 gun. 
---
Considering those guns are built like tanks, it makes sense. Look at the assault rifle. Water cooled barrel with all steel construction?  Yeah, that isn‚Äôt going to be light. 20lb seems reasonable. 
---
I was crafting something at a bench right in the Whitepsrings bunker there. And when I turned around, there were TWO of those guys just staring at me! Named Imakeapoopy and Imakepoopys (spelling may have been different). Lvls 130 something and 90 something. Creeped the shit out of me.
---
(Starts Slow Clap)
---
I especially like the ‚Äúin the game‚Äù part.  
---
I think it might be 'assorted lights' but I'm not 100%
---
that 40+ year old gamer just destroyed your ass with simple logic, so who's actually keeping up? 
---
Only 5? You‚Äôve gotta up those numbers, those are rookie numbers!
---
MY taxes pay YOUR salary, dammit!
---
Kind of amazing at the same time haha! Unique, at least 
---
You seem upset.
---
Do you want to group up and kill scorched together?
---
ya i should have elaborated much more, and i didnt mean to actually accuse anyone of cheating.  just trying to figure out what exactly was going on in this situation.  most people without power armor go down pretty quickly from sneak headshots. i think he blocked me cuz i could hear him talking to his buddy who gave him directions on where we were coming at him from.  was a unique experience, not butthurt about it or anything.  assassin sentinal sounds likely, and maybe if its infact 0 damage my crit never moves, even with all my crit gain perks.
---
Pve kill what you want as fast as you want...PvP definitely nerf yes 
---
Longer barrel increases range but decreases accuracy .... Yeah nuff said they've never handled a firearm
---
This. I've been there so much and it's all the same shit. Anything worthwhile you are better off going to anywhere in the southeast of the map.
---
Shut up and take my atoms!
---
This. It‚Äôs a typo. 
---
I'm not a big fan how the tile says "camouflage paint" but then the expanded says "Camouflage HUNTING RIFLE paint.. Don't really use the atom shop so i had enough built up, but i'd be fuming if I paid for this and got a bamboozle for not paying attention to the expanded pop up.
---
&gt;Carry what you need, not what you can carry
---
That. Absolutely that. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty ugly tbh and I mainly use the hunting rifle. Would not put on my baby.
---
That's strange, I've had the scaly skin mutation for weeks now with no issues like that.
---
Props to u/bolsey for putting this together....

Men try this trick and all ghouls will be bending over for you left and right.
---
Yet OP does not understand this. 
---
Not disputing your experience, but I‚Äôve played both XB1 and PS4. I stopped on PS4 because I found the player base far more toxic. Ps4 was never fun because of other players, but xb1 has been a blast.
---
Yeah, I give exactly no f*cks.  It‚Äôs a worthless weapon above 30.
---
So bulking does save weight ? 
---
You may want to say that to Bethesda instead of throwing a tantrum on a subreddit, though.
---
Unless, of course, you were... looking for attention? *gasp*
---
G-G-G-GIRL
---
My thoughts? It's exactly what we've been asking for: finally, a useful weapon skin, at a reasonable price, in a good color.  So of course, let's get ready to shit all over it because you're only cool on reddit if everyone else knows that you PROMISE you'll never spend an atom. 
---
Why is the currency bottle caps???
---
Explosive is being nerf ed as well down to +20% from +100%
---
So TSE weapons will likely see a 30-45% decrease in damage.
---
You can remove all doubt by providing evidence of its existence, yes. Because it is impossible for me to prove its universal nonexistence. And as mentioned, I did do "research" (a bit glorified, to call a Google search research?), and didn't find it. Aside from some hearsay, which others called a myth and a hoax. Which is why I asked for concrete proof of its existence. Such as patch notes. 
---
I wasn't really arguing, it's really a pet peeve of mine when people say "whataboutism", "slippery slope", "strawman", "ironic", and it is not of those things. You are one of those people. And I did my best to convince you that you are not using slippery slope properly, just like there's hordes of people in /r/politics that yell "whataboutism!" when it has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
Clearly I failed. I am sorry.
---
yes I'm the femoid
---
Just keep trying. Frustrating as hell, but they'll end up eventually.
---
Tried many (many) times myself - never did see the Witch at all. Saw the skeleton several times - got nothing several times, the mask plans (which are bugged and don't work) twice and - finally! - the costume plans.
---
Going to take a break from the Dam for a while, but I'll likely be back for the Witch's costume eventually.
---
&gt;Tell me how this makes sense
---
Like any true operator you use 5lbs of spongebob branded band-aids to connect the mod to the gun.
---
Did anyone else go to the dog on the map hoping for a giant dog? Cuz i sure did lol. 
---
Damn. Dog or proper hydration. This is a hard decision. 
---
The game needs a giant pass on balancing weight.  Without a doubt, item weights were inflated for the sole purpose of creating more perk cards and making them useful.  There's a perk card to reduce weight for literally every category of item in the game and this reeks of poor design.
---
We want our game to be "Wasteland Survival Online 2019", not "Weight Management Simulator 2019".
---
Try going to stash and storing all junk
---
The reasoning that ease of crafting ammo balances damage falls apart when you see that 5mm is another bulk-craft  round, but the gatling  gun hits like a truck.
---
They just forgot about the .50 ammo type again and only put more thought into the MG than other weapon chambered for it.
---
HOYHEE HOYHEE HOYHEE
---
it happens to me if try to equip two of the same masks at the same time, my head goes *poof*
---
I had a problem like that once and then I took the springs out of the stash into my inventory and it worked.
---
I‚Äôm still confused. What‚Äôs the difference between armor penetration and damage?
---
&gt;Because there are those who wouldn‚Äôt be able to differentiate between plans and the actual gun.
---
Thats why the word plan is there.
---
Yawn
---
After weeks of trying I got one calibrated shock and one jet pack. Still looking for a second shock so I don't run in circles :D
---
Godly

God-tier Shitpost/Troll.
---
Kenm would be proud
---
It's all about the karma.
---
Okay so I agree with you wholly. So what would seem to be the correct correction (from a realism point of view) would be to increase the dmg and cost of .50 cal ammo.
---
Seems like the matte green of the marksman stock etc is likely a better camo
---
I liked the idea that "your player base could be nuked at any time" prior to the beta. Turns out that would only happen if you built in WhiteSprings. Pretty boring that everyone only nukes one area. 
---
Ask him i hardly understand 
---
My old locations were good, but my current CAMP is taken on just about half the servers I join. It's on a lake in a central location with an acid spawn.
---
what
---
I still think that it should be nerfed on both, sbq gets one tapped all the time for tse
---
No doubt.  They go by the methodology: "Does it have name recognition?  Ok it's more powerful."
---
So... where the eff is the most common pistol round out there? 9mm?  10mm is kind of a bastard child of pistol calibers.  No way I should have as many rounds of that, and no 9mm.
---
They're worth learning - ALL plans are worth learning (there's literally no downside)! - for trade if nothing else. The build costs 3 cloth and 5 plastic  and has a base value of 250 caps and weighs 0.10 lbs. Even with my crappy charisma and no perks, I get 31 caps from any vendor. Caps collecting made easy.
---
Unfortunately not, it seems...
---
I have a level 45 TSE Pump Action Shotgun.
---
Eh, it's not too bad for early alpha. Which is what this is.
---
The client deleting itself was funny, but not even close to the fuckups I've seen over the years. EVE Online once released a patch which deleted boot.ini from peoples hard drives, which bricked their PCs. True story: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/12/eve-online-trinity-borks-windows-deletes-boot-ini/
---
Because he knows that he can't get refund, at all.
---
Because he already downloaded the game
---
Nor that but did go looking for a giant bee. I was very disappointed :(
---
Creepy!
---
Was wearing the combat helm last night however and didn't see this. I did load into the server as a floating head a few times, but no android-with-face-removed type appearance. 
---
They look like big, strong hands. Don‚Äôt they?
---
‚ÄúEverybody disliked that‚Äù 
---
Was the junk in your stash? Because the perk only applies to your character inventory
---
I hear it's the forbidden one
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer_ - please pass this onto the devs, seems like its worth looking at
---
Only Aluminum and Lead. Rest of the things weigh same bulked as unbulked. So no real penalty for bulking other things, but you'll waste plastic by doing so.
---
Yeah, there‚Äôre a lot of assholes who ran out of things to do so they look around for people‚Äôs homes to destroy (you can sometimes tell if you see somebody in one random location for a while). Same shit happened to me two days in a row - just groups of 3-4 shitstains who destroy your camp and try to taunt you into pvp. 
---
They‚Äôre douches, and there‚Äôs no way to avoid it other than switching servers. Hopefully when the pvp server comes out they‚Äôll play on that and leave us alone. Until then (even though it doesn‚Äôt say so on the card) the contractor perk card reduces repair costs by 50% just like it does for building costs and you can repair everything at once from your C.A.M.P. 
---
Launching in 5 minutes. Add me if you want in
---
R/Bethesda sorry I forgot it. Happy now? No? gasp
---
Maybe it's server freezing them. Or making you freeze, without bringing that server is not responding thing.
---
 I know when server is heavily lagging, certain things require server side confirmation, to happen. (sometimes when Im trading and end up on probably US server, the lag is like 2 seconds, so it's very notisable)
---
Things like activating pipboy light, sneak to activate(for the text to display) all require server input.
---
So it's possible the client is waiting for server to respond properly but it's not, so nothing happens. 
---
I has a lot less to do with bloodied and whole lot more to do with the fact that all low life builds use perks that are multiplicative instead of additive. 
---
Lol right? What a dick!
---
Not quite related, but this reminded me of a house in my town but in my town that was built in top of an 1/8th mile of a lava tube cave. It was pretty roomy inside. It came up for sale about six years ago, I so wanted to buy it and build a subterranean room down there. The previous owners didn't do much with it apparently. There were stairs from inside the house down into the cave. And they put a big fan at the opening of the cave to pull in an endless supply of cold air for air conditioning.
---
You have opted to state that testimony is not evidence so I have no way to resolve your denial. As already mentioned, explosives in Fallout 4 had a massive amount of contention as to how they worked. Ultimately, they were changed, and they were changed across platforms (testimony again). As is popular these days, you've chosen a single testimony to trust and no others. I can't help you and have no responsibility to.
---
It's really a pet peeve of mine when people like to try to redefine (as you did) terms because they see the terms used and find then offensive when they are leveraged against an argument they are making.
---
"If I turn off one light I may as well turn them all off" or "If they patched TSE obviously melee is next" are the same thing. They are slippery slopes with no context or basis. There is no reason to escalate one pair of mechanics being nerfed to those mechanics with melee "logically" being next. That's a fantasy escalated from one nearly-known to a logically derived known - that's irrational.
---
update: They never even responded!!!. I sent 2 tickets in and nothing. I'm done. I defended this crap company when everyone was hating on it and I was proved that they are in fact trash. I'm done
---
Are you fat shaming?
---
Not everyone cares about internet rates üòÄ

Monster hunter world had set ups like that and it was amazing. 
---
This game has like a year of bug fixes that have to come it's way before they can even make headway on actually providing new and exciting features which i'm sure will be highly bug tested and mostly bug free /s
---
This poor game never stood a chance at coming out polished and well done.   
---
I'm glad people like it here but I just can't get over how poorly made it is.
---
That sounds fancy. 
---
Ok there captain crankypants, hope your life gets better.
---
People are having this problem, my buddy moved his camp because he couldn't place it after 10 server hops. Not all platforms are the same you tool :)

Holy shit!! How does a bug like that make it through development???!?!!?!

Hey I have an issue with how you guys nerfed the only good guns in the entire game
---
I'm big boned!

Yes officer, this comment right here.

---
These skins need to be for multiple weapons. Releasing one skin per weapon at a time is one of the biggest whale fishing attempts i've seen.
---
Love to see a shit ton more adds too 
---
If you have a weapon with TSE and it does 1500 damage it will not drop to 375. That would assume those mods do nothing. You will still get the double dip just at a significantly lower amount. It will be (375 x 1.2 x 1.2) which should result in 540 damage. Considering those weapons one shot most mobs we will just have to see how this balances out.
---
Yeah I've seen people selling them for 10k and up
---
You lose all your amour perks however as you are naked under it. So only the perks help now for any damage resistance. 
---
I'm personally waiting for *just the right item.* While I believe the prices in the store are a little off, I really dislike when people start insulting each other over cosmetics. So many hostile comment sections in this reddit. :'(
---
It's definitely a cool paint job, my only complaint is that it's **only** for the hunting rifle. I do see that Bethesda is slowly moving towards a better Atomic Shop For now I think it'll stay either really slow or where it currently stands and we really just have to wait for the next batch of items that haven't been datamined yet to see where it's going next.
---
How many?
---
Nope, he was fine. He had damage but I don't know if that was from me or the mutants he was fighting. His health reset afterwards though 
---
Lol that sounds like a horrible deal for them but amazing for you
---
How have you not exceeded the budget lol
---
Yes! When i get overencumbered i equip a card, travel home and go back about my business
---
Note to self take the cabins 
---
How many what?  I‚Äôd say someone just fat fingered the keyboard and set 44 instead of. 45 as the preferred ammo for it. 
---
I want one as a mount.  Put a little seat on top the trailer.
---
Damn, that's huge. Nice job!
---
Reminds me of a baby booster seat, you have in the car.
---
Could be.
---
Perks are a thing.
---
If you can't change your habits then perks are the solution.
---
I wanted to get the Xmas lights power armor, but it was only for one type. WTF?!?!? no skin should be single item exclusive
---
Have you considered making an interactive map? This was a popular tool when the game first started, but it hasn't been updated much since then: [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
I think it's a better way of displaying the information you're trying to compile, especially given the audience. There's definitely room for another level to the map with screenshots, descriptions, farming route suggestions, etc. but I think you'll spark a lot more interest with a map tool than a classic website layout.
---
I mean, the coat has a very rare chance to appear in the trader, and the trader has a very rare chance to appear. I would rather get my own but I understand people not wanting to hop 1000 times for something

Are you sure? That downvote looks like you do care.

Given the people we're speaking of seem to value story over gameplay, I guess you've got a point.  Because the gameplay of DM was weak, especially compared to how much fun OWB was, but it did have some really deep characters.

Haters will say it's photoshopped
---
No I‚Äôm on PS4. The only two friends I have in the game are the SBQ grinder types who just talk the whole time about this gun or that exploit, it‚Äôs kinda annoying. I‚Äôm just over here like ‚ÄúHey I got the garage door plan!‚Äù
---
Ok! I just did that and restarted my game. I wasn‚Äôt wanting to fast travel back cause I‚Äôm posed after wasting so many caps lol. Thank you! 
---
+karma
---
Abraxo. The shit is everywhere. 
---
Okay, this is a relief.
---
I'm not the only one who finds Assaultrons sexy.  Good.  
---
Anyways, about this book...
---
You got to consider, it's not "only" for the hunting rifle. It's for the hunting rifle in every conceivable combination of mod applicable to the hunting rifle. 
---
In any other game it *would* be several different weapons, because of the model swapping involved in attachments.  I get what you're saying, but I think it's a critical point you're ignoring.
---
You sir are a friend of mine
---
There‚Äôs a small pond by Charleston vendor, but people don‚Äôt like you camping there because it interferes with the rare vendor spawn there.
---
Depending on how fancy they want to get, I'd say anything from recoil to high aggro radius.
---
Recoil on .50 can look like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMJhpk5gWyU
---
They can keep the damage as high (above .308), but squeezing more than one shot in quick succession would be impossible. Also, obviously, the weight. 
---
Aggro radius is a fun one. Quiet weapons - little aggro. Loud weapons? Major convergence of enemies. To the point where you start shooting .50, and enemies start spawning around you, and coming to your location to investigate. State of Decay series did this very well with zombies. When you got too loud, the game would spawn more zombies. Same with XCOM 2: War of the Chosen with the zombies, that start spawning on the edges of the map if you get too loud (explosions). 
---
Though overall I would really like a complete overhaul. The small ammo does little damage, little penetration (and no perks to increase it!), but doesn't take much to make. With Crossbow and Bow and Stake-Shooter being your fallback weapons - extremely cheap to make, ammo takes wood and steel, or just wood for Stake-Shooter. Then as we increase the size, so does the weight, the damage, the penetration and the decibels. Meaning, a .50 Cal machinegun will shred ANYTHING in seconds. BUT it'll be oh-so-fucking-expensive to shoot ([like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHgZh4GV9G0)), recoil would be horrendous (except in Power Armor), and it would be loud as fuck. You may kill someone with it, but then you'd have to deal with waves of enemies. 
---
Weight of ammo should matter, and again no perks to reduce it. The more overloaded you are, the slower you move. Want to fire a Minigun for 10 mins? Fine, but you're not going to be jogging anywhere. Maybe throw in overheating. I mean, M60 machinegun's barrel would literally [start to melt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sFNXRvMbIg) after 2 mins of sustained fire. 
---
Stuff like that. 
---
Hopefully it works. It worked for someone else earlier
---
I don't think it needs changing. My carry weight is 105/225 and stash 450/600. I'm wearing some heavy marine armor, carrying 3 pistols and 2 shotguns, and not using any weight reduction perks. 
---
I only carry a small amount (&lt;20) of medicines with me, and consume food and water when I find it so I don't carry any with me. 
---
I can understand if you're a heavy gunner/rifle user that they're heavy. 
---
Pvp sucks donkey dingle in this game.
---
They are heavily nerfing one of the two ways to do any amount of actual damage. With this nerf the only viable weapon build that will actually make a difference is melee weapons. Without the TSE weapons being good queen fights will be infinitely harder, in fact I would gies as far as to say the Queen will be killed 60% less often if not even more and then on top of that the problem still exists of her dropping shitty loot and glitching out all the time. Once this nerf hits I doubt I will see anymore Queen fights at all
---
Excavator is hugely useful for ammo crafting tho... Can go thru lucky hole mines and come out with basically unlimited lead
---
Shhh Mr. Gutsy shhhh
---
I'm sorry to hear it did that.  
---
But why on God's green earth did you pull out all of them!?!
---
Funny! Oh well, guess its a good thing I have the lone wanderer perk maxed out.
---
I somehow find it impossible he didn't. I've never been able to place nearly that much even with no turrets
---
I hopped about 30 times just to find the vendor, then I had a friend hold the vender for me so I could keep rejoining the server to reset his inventory. I did that about 40 times before I gave up
---
Anytime. It was passed to me and now I pass it on to you. 
---
I had just made a build centered around laser rifles. And I carry all my ammo on me as I have bandolier, batteries included and the explosives one. 
---
He/she is probably in the corner in the fetal position at this point, rocking back and forth.
---
There‚Äôs an earlier post about vendors in this sub. Google should pull it up. Basically, there are a few different types of vendors, and each type shares a pool of 200 caps per day. I hit 3-4 each time I play‚ÄîWhitesprings has two, Watoga has two and then I hit Top of the World. Some people hit more. 
---
I was precious about my junk and saved it all until it hit me how easy it is to make money. Basically, pick stuff up, and sell it all to these vendors. You‚Äôll find that certain weapons sell for more than junk and you‚Äôll find your own balance, but basically, pick up crap, and sell it to vendors every day for riches. 
---
But also remember to pick up crap for your own uses like repairing and crafting. 
---
God: God kills everything
---
F
---
Damn
---
Took a shot of this close-up in photo mode. Now I get to see "hubba bubba bear" as one of my load screens! So funny! üêª
---
Completely FUD.
---
We killed the queen with plain old Gauss rifles and Laser Gatlings before _and then they nerfed her_.
---
Boohoo 
---
Compared to the queen, these weapons do average damage without them the queen will be nigh impossible to kill
---
Am I the only person who can‚Äôt find this house?
---
what do you use purified water for..im finding i dont need it for anything and end up drinking it or selling it
---
well with the new nerf SBQ is a waste of time ,that means i do 3 times less the damage which means 3 times more ammo wasted (which is already expensive since i use ultracite ammo) might as well go bloodied melee
---
I wish there were more homes in-game you could use and add onto. Saves my buget and the walls can't be destroyed.
---
That‚Äôs really nice. Is that the spot with the dog next to his dead owners?
---
Oh, another one. Learn how to tag for components. You can google that or search the sub. 
---
Tag plastic, aluminum, adhesive, lead at least. These are components you‚Äôll need a bit of. As you move on, you‚Äôll find other things that you personally tend to use for your build that you might want a nudge to grab. 
---
It's found under Data in the Pipboy. Date and time, right at the bottom. 
---
so, 2 things.
---
1, you did not fire a super charged laser, you fired a tier 1 charge for the cost of 5k ammo.
---
2, if you want to actually test out the weapon, store all your ammo, pull your gun out, see that it has 0 ammo. pull your ammo back out, and now your gun is 0/ammo. press r / reload to charge up the laser. spoiler: it still sucks.
---
Looking for one too. Will pay 1000 caps too!
---
I know right? I was shocked at how much it let me build. It's at absolute capacity currently haha. I just make sure to completely scrap everything in my camp every now and then, then when I rebuild at a higher level the cost of placement is lower per item. That's part of the reason I've built so many, well that and I just enjoy building stuff in this game!
---
A complete lack of turrets helps a lot though. This location is in a position that is pretty difficult to get to for any NPCs (and even me sometimes!); I have yet to have an NPC attack it. I did have a scorchbeast event spawn right near it once when I happened to be AFK. It was a total disaster.
---
Yeah it's really just an overall odd choice. I can kinda defend the xmas lights because it's a little bit more than just a simple recolor.. But when you think of it, it's really not that complex and could of very easily been converted to the other PA types. 
---
As for recolors and retextures, they should definitely all come in packs. The only time I can understand induvial weapons / power armor items being in the shop is if they were remodeled in some way to change the look of the item. We have yet to see an item like that.
---
Thank you!
---
I think they should change it. I mean I end up wasting too much time doing upkeep type of things.
---
For me it's too restrictive. I can't keep a nice selection of weapons and junk and PA. I end up having to carry bullshit with me that I can't store at my camp. 
---
Imo the balance is screwed up and storage should be able to be ramped up through a style of play that wants it.
---
Thank you! 
---
Bullet mechanics mean nothing in any iteration of fallout tbh üòÇ
---
Have you ever packed a 10lb rifle around hunting? It's not fun. Besides this game lets you hide a Gatling laser up your butt so you can't really compare to irl.
---
Status tab in pipboy has time and date displayed IIRC.
---
What console
---
Thanks
---
Idk what FUD means, and I also don't doubt that you did kill her with those weapons. But if i am by my lonesome and launch a nuke with randoms I have yet to kill the queen with just randoms
---
Does that one too? üòÄ
---
oohooB
---
To drink. You always need to drink 
---
Oh my
---
This last patch my power armor is almost like not wearing armor before patch. I'm lvl 120 and my physical resistance is 543, energy 460,  rads 423 and a super mutant that's lvl 68 with a board can now kill me in 6 hits. I was at pleasant valley ski resort and I'm used to being pretty strong in armor so when three lvl 68 mutants went to town on me, I wasn't expecting to die in 4-6 seconds. I went through 8 stim packs clearing out the area when I usually consume 4 rice soups. Without armor it's almost instant death if more than two get close enough to melee. 
---
My TSE lvl 50 combat does 346 damage and I still have to shoot most enemies over lvl 50 more than once. Like I mentioned in another post I know people that keep high rads and use bloodied weapons with explosive effect to do serious damage. 
---
I got lucky yesterday by getting one but it‚Äôs only armor piercing. It was dumb luck and I‚Äôd spent 1 hr farming whitesprings. 
---
Can you just skip to the camera section? I didn't have enough mats to craft all my pieces. Stepped into a friend's suit and just registered in front of the camera. Quest completed, skipped crafting.
---
I've heard people say Intel is capped at 25. I don't know for sure. Having high Intel when crafting gives the item better durability. Though you can get 200% durability by repairing an item with Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan, which as far as I can tell is pretty much the same thing, as people have said. You do get more scrap with high intel and with scrapper even more. I guess that would be a reason to get your intel up there. There are different ways you can achieve that though and might not even need to put all the points into intel. I haven't spent any time trying to figure it out though.
---
Hope he tipped you well after that spit-shine.
---
That's cool. Yea I haven't had time to even call my first play worth while. I literally spend all the time I play looking for ammo to go through whitesprings once ... Takes the fun out of the game. 4 hrs grinding ammo for 5 minutes of shooting.
---
It is indeed! I love that little guy.
---
I just completed it now! Thank you guys. I‚Äôve been doing this for weeks lol 
---
False
---
I got a sweet one last night
---
PS4!
---
Um...no
---
I mean you can buy a paint job in the atom shop and the frame with that paint job will have an atom symbol next to it...but that will only identify 1 of them...if you have paint on all if them, then they'll all have the symbol...so you'll have the same issue.
---
I have only have 4 so i just pop them all out to find the 1 I need.  
---
Why so many?
---
Obviously, you need a better gaming chair! /s 
---
For the bottom, definitely. It's still cannibalism for the guy tossing the salad.
---
That would be great advise if the blueprint budget wasn't less than half of the build budget.
---
Its probably on your end.
---
You cant honestly think their simple webservice is down
---
Well damn. I‚Äôve been sitting on a gold mine then to get caps easily lol
---
i was killed while minding my own business once..not one shot but about 3 shots.. i dont even know where the shots c√†me from but game said i was killled by another player..i had pacifist mode on too.
---
That‚Äôs still awesome!
---
I haven‚Äôt had any luck all week lol
---
 Another floating piece of shit. That garage door in the middle of nowhere really makes sense. I really don‚Äôt get it. 
---
If you repair the missile launcher it sells for more lol
---
Shit happens. Trinity was a hell of an expansion though.
---
Selling is always bad in most games
---
I kinda wish you could apply a couple perks to your Stash, maybe 3-5 slots for weight reduction cards for it? Partly because it's frustrating to only shed 10lbs of gear that becomes 100 in my stash, just because I prioritized carrying that kind of item. Makes it hard to justify putting it away instead of only stashing things I'm not rocking weight perks for.
---
See, that is what I was thinking! Players should be able to contest &amp; take stations, as well as commit train robberies. 
---
Yeah I just hate being fully speced into rifles and having a random melee weapon doing more damage and not using ammo :/
---
For better reference, look around the Charleston Capitol Building on the map to find a white 85, go directly south up a hill from there to find the road it's on. It's on the North side of the road across the street from a partially burnt down building
---
Your ten year old Tumblr saying needs CPR.
---
Ahhh you baited me. 
---
Known exploiter, they are.
---
I logged into a nuke zone without PA, Got empath... lost Bird Eye and Marsupial trying to get rid of it.  
---
I didn't even know I was in a nuke zone until about 3 minutes after I died.
---
High luck, and grind whitesprings. That's how my whole team got all our weapons. Most of us didn't find anything good until we were all above lvl 70
---
Oo I like like that alot More then the simple nerf it mentality
---
JEBAITED!!! Well done &lt;3
---
Definitely maybe!
---
West tech 20 to 30 super mutants depending if the ones outside are also max it‚Äôs 195exp a kill with no bonuses so 3900 or 5850 every 10 minutes  not including load time and I get 2/3 stars fairly often 
---
It is firmly planted, good sir! It's not for everyone though I guess, thanks for having a look anyway!
---
It was literally like the last ghoul of the last second of the nuked area. Yeah thing is pretty nice! 
---
Nah, sparse lighting and decor relative to the overall size, most of the budget is in the shell of the CAMP. Totally makes sense to me. 
---
i never got ultracite from a bos quest. i have 2 arm plans and thats it
---
I'm always out of ammo in this game and ammo farming doesn't provide enough for a quest. No wonder everyone just uses melee. 
---
sorry for the long reply but what I did is I just stacked fold-up tables on top of each other to make a natural looking staircase
---
In other games we can sell ammo also, it's not really the point of the post, it clearly makes no sense and the vendors should be rebalanced.
---
Supply and demand.
---
That vendor bot knows he'll sell a bunch of Bobby pins to low level players who haven't stockpiled them yet. But who has EVER bought an unmodded missile launcher from any vendor ever?
---
No demand = low price. 
---
Yea I tried that for a while myself ..really how I got leveled this high...but a combat knife can only take you so far.
---
I just don't know :P I'm a collector, I guess :O
---
It wasnt broken and even if it was why would you waste materials to sell ? Lol 
---
Canadian at least
---
Agreed.
---
For the first whatever of the game I didn't even know you could pick a perk point then a card from another perk. I played numerous times before I saw a video that showed that you can...
---
My game was already well going to where I said if I start over I'm just sell the game so I kept going. 
---
My shit is all fucked up and wasted etc.
---
 It's so bad I don't even have a certain style like melee, auto weapons, pistol etc because I'm now trying to pick the perks that help much more overall than a weapon perk.
---
Shrek, I've been looking at this image for 5 minutes straight and it reminds me of Shrek.
---
This is probably so the 50 caliber machine gun does not become the best weapon in the game
---
Ive been deceived 
---
I'm not disputing that explosives in FO4 were a contentious topic. I am disputing that there was a nerf to explosive damage, by Bethesda, in FO4. your testimony is insufficient, because by your own admission the topic of explosives had a massive amount of contention, and you are not immune from this. Patch notes, however, would put this to rest. After checking the patch notes, no such change appears to exist. Also, you do have a responsibility, if you state something is true, but when asked to provide evidence can only respond with "it's true because I said so". A nerf to explosives, by Bethesda, would be documented, by Bethesda, in official patch notes. 
---
The rest of what you said, frankly, makes absolutely no sense. At no point did I redefine the terms, you simply keep attributing random things to what I said. 
---
Ohhh, I found it. Thank you. The house was actually yellow to me. 
---
Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. Specifically fear, uncertainty, and doubt that any builds except TSE or melee can be successful.
---
If you are completely solo and rushed by a bunch of lowbies and all you have is a vanilla handmade..... Time to cut and run. That's just how it is. It's intended to be a raid event and if your raiding party is you and 10 level 10s that's an entirely different issue that has nothing to do with TSE or melee. It's going to take a whole lot of effort to win that.
---
You roll what you want, but if you find yourself in that scenario and are tired of it I suggest a plain old Gatling Gun, Stabilized, One Gun Army, Martial Arts, and Bullet Shield. You'll most likely not force her to land and the low levels will just go away. When they leave she'll be squishy. As you get used to that build you can add Adrenal Reaction, Emergency Protocols, and maybe a Bloodied Gatling.
---
You have to do responders for firebreathers lore. I already did both.
---
I agree. Or at least vendors have way more caps
---
You didn't pick up Twisted Muscles did you? 
---
Touche üòÇ
---
Well the nerf to white springs has made finding 2 and 3 stars pretty rare. Thats why we need a new spot
---
All those listed, blood but probiscus or however it's spelled. There's a few enemies that drop it too can't remember what. Best way is abraxo cleaner though.
---
I‚Äôve gotten stuck on the loading screen as well. 4 times in 10 minutes. And power armor is broken. I can‚Äôt put a fusion core in. 3 tries in the past 5 mins and I get stuck. 
---
wtf  how do you get a pet dwathclaw? does it fight for you? like defend your camp?
---
Oh jeez..Anybody else downvote, then open the post, then remove downvote? 
---
I just updated the game and it is fucking ridiculous how much more difficult it is to kill someone. Everyone I spawn on my camp it's surrounded and I die no matter where I place it. 
---
Shrek is love
---
There is a ranger tower full of little planter boxes in the world that make me wish I could just live there. Corn, tatos, melons, carrots and all kinds of stuff there. I wish I could litter my house with those things. Much better than my crops getting trashed all the time.
---
Yeah and it's not my style. You ever get caught in that loop where you go farming high level enemies and use up all ammo, all stimpacks and water and spend the next 2 days trying to refill your stock. Feels bad man 
---
that was the 76th comment and this is the 77th, I will be deleting it to keep the number of comments at 76, thanks
---
This is probably the 50th PSA I've seen on this exact issue since the pre-beta.
---
Tf r u talking about
---
Nah just your first try at this kind of fallout. 76 is hard enough, if I don‚Äôt stop to do some workshop quests soon I‚Äôll be out of stimpaks and then I‚Äôll start to die. 
---
Shrek is an All Star
---
This is a good way to demolish the SBQ.  Bring your assaultron head to the party and lose that excess weight for a cause!  P.S. Use a critical to ensure all that ammo hits.
---
Wish I had known this while I was actually playing :c
---
Perks. If you want a full glass cannon damage build, you don't get to carry much. If you're in adventure and exploring mode, you sacrifice some stopping power to shoulder the extra burden.
---
If the weight system was only interacted with when you hit arguably ridiculous arbitrary weights, it would only be more annoying because the whole system wouldn't feel like it had value anymore anyway.
---
It's obnoxious to get used to, but it's a part of the survival experience for the game. I didn't worry too much about weight once I loaded up on the QoL perks, well before calibrated shocks and weight reduction armor. It was fine
---
Did that work?
---
Very nice. My camp is right under there beneath the bridge. I‚Äôve thought about moving up
---
Just to get the dog. 
---
Marine combat armor, deep pocketed mods. I have carry weight of 285 and one of my legs is a three star legendary with +1 str, and 20% ammo reduction for all types.
---
Im running the 75% reduction of negative effects, is the damage hit that bad?
---
wow the most poweful gun iv found is a shotgun that does 115 damage..so i stick to melee. guns just take too long to killll things iv seen other players kilƒ∫ enemies in 1 to 4 shots..but im lvl 104 and have not found a gun that can do that yet...
---
It's does..I do Everytime I play. I have a water farm so I ha epurfied out the wazoo.. I have 3 toddlers so by the time I get them to bed and start playing I get like two hours..and it's enough to get enough acid and steel to make a few rounds of 50 Cal..takes me like3 weekends to get enough shit to do anything. They need to have a limited play time perk card..all shit half off. I love fallout..but this shit is taking my will to play it
---
I'm not asking you to believe it because I said it. I'm telling you my experience on a point of contention you've latched on to in order to weaken the argument that you've created a slippery slope that melee is indeed next.
---
I have never said it was true "because I said so". That has never happened. You invented that entirely, just like you've invented that you haven't made a slippery slope because a slippery slope must have a specific measurable order of magnitude difference. That's a redefinition.
---
The argument that TSE will be nerfed and that the next logical progression is melee and then other builds is a slippery slope you invented. It is not a logical progression. It is not a sequence. It is a slippery slope that one aspect was changed, therefore all of them will be nerfed starting with the next most popular. There is no evidence. There is no support. There is only a slippery slope you invented.
---
If you check Monogah for to make sure Ghouls are spawned and nuke that, it's the best thing ive found besides Whitesprings
---
Good show
---
I discovered this when fighting a Deathclaw as a Scorchbeast was attacking it. The Scorchbeast released the gas and I got a Scorched Deathclaw. Both turned on me and I died.
---
same. it's bugged. can't dig, no prompt.
---
I dont think this is a real outfit. The paramedic is as close to a bmue and white outfit i can think of
---
wait. oh. yeah. I want that.
---
I had this exact same glitch. The solution is weird. At the screen where it says it is dispensing the holotape, mash spacebar over and over again. It will prompt the next screen to appear and allow you to progress
---
Ah, well it worked for me and some others, must be how that mutation interacts with something else that gives the bug
---
Yeah that's what happened in my case
---
I‚Äôll give this a shot, thanks. 
---
I'll buy the *fuck* out of a camo combat shotgun...
---
... but not a rifle.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs awesome but mega grindy. Plus you have to be level 50 to get one
---
When you're in Appalachia, look behind you...
---
 "If you‚Äôre equipping 50,000 Super Stimpaks, a million Bulk Ballistic Fibers, or any other absurdly high quantity of other ‚Äúrare‚Äù items in the world, we can find out how many you have. "
---
Cuz that's where Bethesda's gonna be.
---
Ok so here's something. 
---
With Berry Mentats you can get +5 Intel.
---
With Unyielding x5 pieces and low health you can get +15 Intel.
---
That's 20 Intel without taking into account the points you already have in Intel. If it is capped at 25 (I haven't checked for myself) then it would be relatively easy to reach that cap.
---
I was out of line, especially as I am reading through your responses above.  I must have been having a bad morning, and I apologize for the comment.   
---
Peace
---
I am at 203/270 while carrying 18 weapons (including 1 heavily modded long barrel combat rifle, 1 Gatling gun, 1 gauss rifle, 4 super sledges) 40+ grenades and mines, 70 purified water, 93 Rad-X, 62 Radaway, 42 Stimpaks, and an assortment of glowing meat steaks, mole rat chunks, and various soups. 
---
My super Sledge base damage is over 200 damage points which is more than enough two hit glowing ones with the Glow Sight perk active. 
---
Yes, the weight management can be difficult but I find the challenge to be quite rewarding. 
---
Thissssss
---
Haven't been getting legendary at Wes tek. U r?
---
Doesn't that just affect accuracy?
---
Omg lmao!
---
He seems nice, but if he suggests karaoke, change the subject.
---
Did you exit the terminal and then log in as "unknown user" rather than "Natasha whatever her name is?"
---
All no stars tho. Looking for anything new
---
Weights are ridiculous. Have been since FO4.
---
Bethesda have no clue how to balance a game. So...the better the weapon is, the more it has to weigh. Because...trade offs. Or some shit.
---
Seriously, there is no logic. Make a game about building bases by scavenging. But gradually DECREASE the amount you can scavenge by constantly increasing weapon weight...
---
Make the game 85% combat, and REQUIRE combat perks. Make scavenging a pain in the ass if you take combat perks.
---
I love this game. But a lot of times, I love despite the mess it is, not because of it. I'm so sick of watching this studio make the same stupid mistakes over and over...
---
Uranium fever only drops low level gear
---
The .50 cal ball does what the 50 cal bullet should.  It's stupid.
---
What i find messed up is when you buy stuff from them, only a small fraction of what you paid shows up in their cap stash, making it impossible to buy useful items from them and sell them stuff you dont want
---
Yes officer this comment right here.
---
Seconding this.
---
I give myself a hard limit on any item I carry. 10 max of any Chem. Three guns and one melee weapon. Only as much food and water as I need for my current trip.
---
My carry weight is around 175 before using anything like Grilled Radstag. I come in around 160 when I leave my house. 
---
Yeah same. I don't know if it gets better at higher levels but the ammo shortage shouldn't take days to build just to use up in one or two events 
---
Yeah. Not every time tho. Try it a few times before u give up. My first time I didn‚Äôt get any legendaries so I was like F that place. Then I tried it again after hearing about it some more and got 3 *** legendaries on one run. So right now it‚Äôs hit and miss. But you do get some good xp and 5.56 ammo if u need it. 
---
This game is nowhere near a finished, polished state...and the pace of patches is sad.
---
A Walker Reference?  In 2019?  I like you.
---
I just purchased this plan as well and for some reason I was only able to get the letters to snap together in a vertical line. Idk why but if I snap them together horizontally they just attach at a very odd angle and with a small gap in between. Also for some reason they are using a fair amount of my C.A.M.P. "Budget" I'm hoping its just a glitch and it might be patched soon.
---
oh...no  i use plants and boiled water  and food to make soups and drinks..get lots of buffs that way
---
You can be lower than 50. You just have to be twice the lvl. So if there's a lvl 21 deathclaw you just need to be 42
---
That's what happened to everyone while we were busy shredding guitars in the vault.  But ya, took me a while to see it in game.  Once they're scorched they're all mind controlled too, if you can believe what the scorched chat about in their free time 
---
Not to mention the IDEA of a rifle weighing 20lbs is so mind bogglingly stupid its hilarious. Honestly I dont believe they have a QA team.
---
Just gotta make camps out of the way really, if its a commonly travelled locale you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time. My base has never been destroyed and has been in same spot for like two months now
---
Awesome. Good to know. 
---
So you can keep all the dupes you want as long as you cease. Interesting mindset 
---
"I am not asking you to believe it because I said it."Fine, accepted. On what basis ARE you asking me to believe it? "I am telling you my experience". And what is that? That is you asking me to believe it, because you are telling me your experience, is it not? How is that different from "because I said so"? Do you see the problem? It's true because I told you it's true. Don't insert slippery slope into this, we're not there yet. You've yet to provide anything to back up there was a nerf, by Bethesda, to explosive weapons, in FO4. Which, if it did occur, would be documented in patch notes. Where no such thing exists. Hence my reluctance to accept your claim that such a nerf took place. 
---
As far as me redefining slippery slope, direct quote from Google search:
---
&gt;A slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a consequentialist logical device in which a party asserts that a **relatively small first step** leads to a chain of related events culminating in some **significant (usually negative) effect**.
---
Emphasis is mine. Do you see where my "redefinition" of measurable difference comes from? A **small** change, resulting in **significant** effect? That's the magnitude change. I never said "order of magnitude" (and if I did, I apologize, it is late), that is an entirely different concept, order of magnitude is typically a factor of 10.
---
Let me try one more time, see if I can get through this way. Imagine a graph, with peaks and valleys on it. Both peaks and valleys are bad. Peaks are things that overperform. Valleys are things that underperform. TSE is a peak. That is bad. Hence, it is being nerfed. One of the other high peaks, comparable to TSE peak, is the melee. Hence, it is highly likely it'll get nerfed. Similarly, pistols are one of the valleys. Just like damage of all automatics was a valley. Automatic damage was buffed last year. Hence, it is very likely pistols will see a buff in future. Makes sense? 
---
I used to server hop those 2 gyms regularly for weeks to keep my rifleman supplied with lead, but they got so popular thanks to youtube videos on farming lead its no longer viable. They start to respawn after one hour but its pure luck now to beat the farmers. If your after lead the best source I've found is robots in Wotoga that all drop lead and steel which is great for ammo crafting, the trick is to get a melee weapon with troubleshooters mod on it so killing bots doesn't require ammo. So instead of 30 minutes server hopping for lead 30 minutes of robot farming gets you more lead, steel, xp plus a bonus bag of legendary weapon drops.
---
Yup basically if you arnt useing a BS auto aim vats build your rifles are useless. The TS effect is the only thing that made aiming possible for a rifleman. Now we all have to level up 30 times have a screwed up build for however long that take to swap to a vats auto aim joke build to even use our rifles we already had a just fine build with. Gotta love the non existent broken one shot fest (even without TSE) ruining pve for all rifle builds. 
---
Camp somewhere outside of common areas?
---
That would be my first suggestion.
---
so how do you get one?? you use the perk where you point your weapon for a chance to tame an animal? it then follows you?
---
Ok, well in another comment in this thread you asked where Morgantown was. That led me to believe you hadn't been there yet. That seems worthy of a downvote. 
---
Get a load of this guy
---
You stop gaining bonus durability when crafting new items at 20 Int.
---
Get to a little over fifty, and head to whitesprings
---
I'd be happy if I didn't have to spend 99% of game time trying to get enough ammo for a quest tbh 
---
move your camp as far the other direction as possible and you should spawn closer to base. had this happen several times, except I just spawned at the bottom of the mountain looking up at my base. by moving the camp item (where you repair all structures etc) it changes your spawn in point, though having your camp item on the far end right by the circle sucks for repairing all, but solves the spawn in problem.

After the Jan 15 patch I now have two loading screens, one right after another everytime I travel but the worst part is that the damage bug was not only NOT fixed but it is much worse. I keep hearing people talk about explosive damage being bugged but that is not the case at all, it's ALL ranged damage, not just explosive. Tried killing the queen twice today and failed both times cause no one was able to do any damage. This game breaking bug has been in the game since day one and has only gotten worse somehow. Please fix this asap!
---
Hmm, so if dupers start dumping hundreds of thousands of pounds of stuff and someone comes by and picks them up, would they be able to differentiate that?
---
I think it is a play off between .308 has higher chance to proc critical while .50 has a higher base damage?
---
Sniper with .50 caliber is at 160 dmg (non-primed, when all single shot rifle perks are attached). With bloody mess and sandman most mobs won't stand a chance anyway. With silenced rifles you just need to sacrifice some range. It is easy to have shot mobs out of your rifles effective range, giving player an impression that .50 might be weaker than .308.
---
Combat sniper with a medium scope make short works of many high level mobs also.
---
Hazmat suits should just be an underarmor with no other upgrades (though some would be nice). Probably won't happen since Bethesda has a hard-on for PA. The Rad Resistant perk is an absolute joke. My favorite character is a non-PA unarmed build. It's biggest weakness is radiation (as I play it). I suppose if I had top tier equipment it wouldn't be so bad, but I'm not so fortunate.
---
I just don't get it...throw on a hazmat suit and lose all DR/ER outside of perks? That's just crazy! It can be done but only with very specific builds, which I feel isn't a good thing for the average gamer who simply wants to enjoy the game...without PA. Either allow the Hazmat Suit as an underarmor or substantially buff the Rad Resistance perk.
---
I've shelved it. Love the atmosphere but the sheer number of broken or nonsensical systems, contradictory mechanics and the dumpster fire perk system, coupled with stutter and disconnect issues...
---
Honestly I cant be bothered. I might revisit in a few months. But I doubt it.
---
I found they use as much budget as other lights. It's more than I'd like but just because I'm not happy with something means it's a glitch lol.
---
Btw when attaching letters horizontally you can rotate the letters so they all snap together without clipping into the wall. Definitely not as fluid as FO4 but not bad enough to only do them vertically. It all worked out for me. 
---
It is known.
---
Appreciate it, cheers 
---
Move it to a less traffic area or log out when you see it. Sucks but that's really the only options.
---
ok thanks that's pretty helpful. Iam in the dried lake bed for the steel deposit thats there
---
It doesn‚Äôt follow you. It goes back to your camp by itself. You have to have animal friend and wasteland whisperer. Find a random spawn for a deathclaw and have fun
---
ok thank you
---
We know.
---
Doesnt make it any less stupid.
---
Exhibit A on what we have all been saying to those defending the TSE.
---
How the fuck?
---
I'll be on in a bit, maybe 30-45 minutes. I can take you farming for stuff or you can give me mats and I'll use ammosmith and super duper to maximize the ammo creation for you.
---
GT Kasv0tVaxt
---
Now you're appealing to Bethesda who, historically, omits things from patch notes. You're really trying to leverage that, but even if it is true that no such change ever happened: you still created a slippery slope.
---
I get it. You really want to believe that you haven't created a slippery slope but no amount of typing or cut and pasting is going to change that you did. There is no reason to believe the prediction you made is anything but a slippery slope based on "TSE is nerfed therefore melee is next". You built that.
---
Great idea man 
---
Those rad aways alone are like 20 lb
---
yeah I didn't stand a chance against it
---
You think they might fix it
---
The shredder barrel does more damage than the tri barrel.... why????
---
No it doesnt. It cant attack anything from your stash. And thanks to your 20lbs of armor, 15lb rifle, 12lb handgun and 10lb walking cane, theres no way your carrying around 50lbs of launcher and ammo without losing AP every time you move.
---
Nothing like punishing players for using better gear.
---
It‚Äôs not a more powerful beam
---
Your looking for r/fo76bazaar will have better luck there
---
Not to mention i would happily waste money if there were actual things in the shop. With the current speed of releasing items i can make more credit then i can spend. 
---
If they could just release every skin for every armor and weapons, even as separete skins, and they would add more items the following could happen:
---
-people would actuall buy them.
---
-people would be happy because they can get the items they want.
---
-people who don't want to waste money would play more to do the challenges.
---
-people would rage about the prices and such, but after that they would play the game to unlock/buy the items they like.

I am also waiting for the power armor colors from the trailers.

So I've hung out at whitesprings a bunch, and have frankly gotten bored of it.
---
I now find myself in watoga, after a certain mission (tying to avoid spoilers), and just shoot the legendary robots safely. Got all my best look there.
---
I have mine in flatwoods next to te church and no ones ever started anything 
---
That sadly does happen when these events are held. But there is only two people searching.  
---
That did the trick! Thanks again...
---
Nah, mostly cause I don't downvote for idiotic reasons.
---
U make me hard
---
I learned this the hard way too. Epic drop for me one day. Three effects. TSE &amp; + 1 Agility. I equip it right away to see how it does.
---
Sure. It took out the l42 ghoul at the Whitespring in one attack, but at what cost? Somewhere around 40,000 fusion cells
---
Fair
---
Bethesda doesnt have QA. They depend on customers for that. Sad but true.
---
This made me laugh harder than I'd expected. *THIS GUY takes his oral hygiene SERIOUSLY*
---
I've completed everything up until the overseers journal haha. Quest is still buggy. Good lookin out tho 
---
Oh sure. Totally not Bethesdas fault, for releasing a bug ridden mess of a game. I mean, I love the game...but it's a fiasco.
---
Traveling pharmacy.
---
It is hard to believe that it has been three months since the beta and one of the most-requested features still hasn't been added to the game.  I cannot imagine this would be a difficult task ... given the fact that it took Bethesda three GD months to reduce the weight of bobby pins ... simply editing the value in a data table shouldn't take so long.
---
I get it, there's priorities, but there's also low-hanging-fruit and this kind of shit should just be done.
---
Doubt it, but it can't come soon enough!
---
Yup, Bethesda Fun Police are probably already on the case. 
---
Weight is a restriction, I personally made the transition to not worrying about weight as much and I am doing fine.
---
Some items are really out of wack, but that needs fixing on a case by case basis.
---
Do you really want mods to have their weight as applied to an item when they are in inventory, because I would rather not have mods that weigh 6 in my inventory.
---
It's not really prohibitively expensive if you know the harvest locations for the raw materials. The excavator suit plus super duper and ammo smith greatly increases the yield.
---
I really wish they did patches faster. I mean, I get it, consoles don't like frequent updates, there's certification and such. But on PC, they could be dropping patches weekly. Blizzard was doing *daily* patches when they released the expansion. ESO does weekly patches. This game is more broken than both, and patches a few times a month. And patches aren't even that big. 
---
I have mine by nuka cola plant on the road and never had it messed with
---
I see. But I did just check and was able to get my Int above 25. I wonder if the other bonuses associated with int cap at 20/25 or not. I'll do some testing later with scrapping stuff above 20 and 25.
---
Suppressed Combat Sniper might be a thing you wanna look into, quite an op mid-range sniper. Now I just use a.50 sniper and .45 combat sniper with my stealth sniper character.
---
My current is level 45 and just tse with piecing capacitors. If I'm at 20% health with adrenal reactions I can hit about 2,200 but nerd rage and psychotats bring it up to 3,000. If I keep my health low with rads and purposely die and get picked up by someone revanant brings me to 4500. These are great numbers and I'm really annoyed to lose them because people are saying pvp isn't fair.
---
Ah, great tip, thanks
---
40,000 fusion cells... Sounds legit...
---
Doesn't work on rad aways tho? Or did they patch that? Haven't played in a week and some change. Xbox got stolen :l
---
It used about a thousand for me. At nothing. Wasn't happy. 
---
Thanks for the announcement! Was able to get in and chip in!
---
Mine‚Äôs on a cliff overlooking whitespring, maybe we just got lucky

Damn wrong group i posted in

"Oh."
---
Pve servers. Its past time.
---
Rebalance and more caps. 
---
Meh. It was a western revolver, so terrible accuracy and long reload time and after using it for a good time yesterday I'm not too salty. Lucky for me I guess since I already have a bloodied dragon and an instigating power fist and the power fist really is stupid strong and I can probably clear out a location faster than a guy with TSE shotgun or handmade because the fist lets me run at full speed while swinging and oneshot enemies even without damage perks (but ofc so can TSE shotguns)
---
OK, so let's put the explosive nerf thing to bed then, and shift to slippery slope exclusively.
---
No, I don't want to believe anything. I gave you the definition, which specifies the magnitude change. Where you claimed there's no such change is required, and that I "redefined" the meaning of slippery slope to suit my agenda. 
---
I do agree that there's no reason to believe the prediction I made. At worst, based on "TSE is nerfed, therefore melee is next", you could accuse me of extrapolating based on incomplete data. I am absolutely guilty of that. But it's still not a slippery slope. You are wrong. Rather than admit it and/or move on, you keep running doing god knows what.
---
Yea twisted muscles isn't affected by the Class Freak and it drops damage of guns drastically. I had to clear all my mutations because of this. 
---
It‚Äôs called the Responder‚Äôs Fireman Hat and Uniform and it very much is real, it‚Äôs just very rare. Only ways to get it are as rare drops from certain Responder Quests and Forest Area Events. Or by trading with people who are willing to part with it. I‚Äôve been occasionally farming for it for a week and have come up short. Starting a new character over and over again until you get the pieces from the Responder Quests is apparently the most efficient way so I‚Äôll probably try that next chance I get
---
No it also drops damage by the same precentage it drops accuracy.  
---
Radaway weighs .25
---
Despite the current gear ceiling being at 50, there are a few reasons I can think of to still scale the caps. The main two are perk cards and gear. 
---
While at level 50 I might be able to use the best weapons and armor in game, there is less likelihood I found as much as someone level 100. 
---
Same for perk cards. While the special points stop at 50, between 50 and 100 I got a lot more perk cards to fine tune and better my build.
---
Aside from those two there's also a experience factor. Someone level 100 has a lot more experience and should have better tactics if they paid attention.
---
Your idea isn't necessarily bad, but I think the current payout factors in some other aspects of the game beyond weapon level.
---
Yeah.  Scorch Beast attacked my CAMP, then a mirelurk queen, who shortly became a scorched mirelurk queen
---
Effing Scorch Beast.
---
Thought they finally patched this crap 
---
Agreed
---
Yeah, OP is not too bright. 
---
Don't we all? *giggity*
---
Yeah it's still bugged :l what's the radx weigh? They're supposed to be the same
---
Completely agree.
---
Guns need a 50% damage increase, and a 200% durability increase. 
---
Automatic weapons need larger mags, even default mags. And less recoil.
---
556 and other automatic ammo needs to be more readily available. 
---
And it should not take 6 perk cards to make a gun type useful.
---
Wow I never noticed that, just as well I got rid of it!
---
That's a strange projection to make about refusing to accept something.
---
There isn't a reason to believe your prediction made as a statement as what would happen as the result of the TSE nerf. The TSE nerf happened therefore melee is next.
---
Slippery slope. There was no reason for that statement to be made and further argued.
---
Because TSE was nerfed does not create any reason to suggest melee would be nerfed. One is unrelated to the other. Slippery slope.
---
Beth hasn't responded to my job application, so not yet.
---
.03. So when they fix it I will be and even better shape.
---
They're in the Dev room guarded by Wooby and his legendary Banhammer.
---
Based on what I've seen, you'll need to find some good tires too.
---
Agreed. That gun is a joke.
---
The entire weapon system needs revamped: damage, weight, durability and ammo economy. 
---
Store all materials in stash and try again. If that doesn't work try taking all junk into.your inventory.
---
Watoga or whitespringring
---
I thought the purpose of the assaultron head was to use all your ammo up in one shot but it did a lot of damage. 
---
Just wanted to say thank you for doing these limited item posts.  I work a lot of hours and appreciate knowing what‚Äôs on a timer so I‚Äôm not missing something good.
---
So much this.
---
Stop using carry weight increases on better gear, and actually balance the game.
---
I also played Wasteland, FO all the way through 76.  4 and 76 are my faves.
---
I can't tell you how many hours we spent, drunk, in college, playing Wasteland, manipulating the floppy diskettes to avoid death...
---
Yes! Pistols are hilariously bad.
---
This is why I have trust issues.
---
I highly recommend the manga. It's a relaxing and good read.
---
I‚Äôd settle for vendors not losing 75% of whatever caps I spend. I‚Äôd actually buy stuff from them that way. 
---
[Well they‚Äôre one piece up on my teammate. ](https://i.imgur.com/LIr23QK.jpg) 
---
I think they balanced it for automatic heavy weapons.
---
Pls no. Some of the best laughs I've had in a while. Patch the loot drop issues first. Leave this alone. :(
---
Damn when I get a new Xbox I need to go through me shit... I had like 4-6 weapons, 30-60 water, 20-40 radx and rad away, only a few food items. Ammo, like 4 fusion cores. And a few other things. I was always at like 200-220/260 :/
---
This should not need a perk card. The entire perk system is just a Bandaid for bad design, at this point.
---
Have a downvote for being a fortnite child
---
Tried it, it‚Äôs working, thank you!
---
I never liked the find your son part, I enjoyed the interplay between the factions, and I took the Minutemen's side over everyone else.
---
Male sure you take it to T-Ray after you find it ;)
---
Yeah, its really killing my hope for the longevity of this game...
---
Our group purposefully avoids TSE weapons due to how boring they make the game. We have not once had trouble taking down SBQ, leechers or no leechers (although we tend to have a melee on kill leecher duty). Even beyond that I'd had little to no trouble in most pub SBQ events as well. 
---
All this is moot anyway because the bobblehead exploit hasn't been addressed yet and folks are nearly one shotting SBQ using it.
---
This is what I liked about it from day one. It‚Äôs got such great atmosphere, I just like exploring. It‚Äôs almost like a survival game. 
---
Um, the BoS in different areas has different perspectives, maybe?
---
Watoga, White Springs and West Tek
---
&gt; No it doesnt. It cant attack anything from your stash. And thanks to your 20lbs of armor, 15lb rifle, 12lb handgun and 10lb walking cane, theres no way your carrying around 50lbs of launcher and ammo without losing AP every time you move.
---
I'm not sure what you're on about, but who the hell walks around carrying a variety of weapons when you have perks that allows you to specialize in particular type? I get that you walk around with least a cane perhaps to kill trash mobs or a rifle because you're a melee build, but wth is everything else for?
---
Further more, a missile launcher would be considered a complementary weapon for heavy weapon users and used against a group of enemies. Why would anyone want to main a missile launcher other than to troll? That's like trying to main grenades instead of using them to complement melee weapons.
---
There‚Äôs a cap I think. I tried it on the SBQ with a bunch of FCs on my inventory. Was expecting major damage (and an instant death from rads). Would have been faster to just drop them all. 
---
That's possible, one of the mutations gave me infinite sprint on PC for like two weeks.
---
#RobotsHaveRights
---
Uh... Queens were getting killed pretty consistently before the flood of TSEs.
---
Why in the hell would you dump it?  It sells for 1c each at the vendors. 
---
And as others mentioned, Abraxo is the best source. It‚Äôs everywhere.  There‚Äôs a ton of boxes of it scattered around the Whitesprings. 
---
The Fallout designers, in '96, said it was.  There are references in Fallout referring to Wasteland.  
---
"In early 1994, [Interplay Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment) announced that they had acquired the license to create video games using the [*GURPS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS) [role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) system.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(video_game)#cite_note-NGen18-7) *Fallout* was then created by Interplay as a [spiritual successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_successor) to their 1988 post-apocalyptic role-playing game [*Wasteland*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)). Although it was initially developed as an official sequel, Interplay did not have the rights to *Wasteland* at that point."  
---
"Although the time frame of *Wasteland* is completely different from *Fallout* ‚Äì and despite the fact that the game's designers deny that the *Fallout* franchise takes place in the same universe as *Wasteland* ‚Äì there are many references to the events and the style of *Wasteland* in the *Fallout* series, which is why *Fallout* is sometimes regarded as a spiritual successor to *Wasteland*. For example, the protagonist can meet an NPC named Tycho, who mentions that he is a Desert Ranger and, under the right conditions, will talk of his grandfather, who told him about Fat Freddy, a character from Las Vegas in that game. "  
---
I don't have a memory of that whatsoever chief, but I salute a fellow enclave member
---
I haven‚Äôt killed one yet. And now I won‚Äôt. Thanks. 
---
I get you.  I was getting bored with the game until I picked up a Gauss myself.  Really fun weapon.
---
Bloodied and instigating can't roll on the same weapon BTW.  There's slot 1 properties, slot 2 properties, and slot 3 properties.  Instigating and bloodied are both slot 1.  So is two shot.  Explosive is slot 2, and it was WAY ahead of the other slot 2s.
---
isnt the damage listed per pellet
---
OP sounds like a duper to me
---
Same thing- about 1400-1500ish cells lost, just firing into the air to see what it did. I don‚Äôt really use fusion cells, but holy crap- that‚Äôs a shock to see ammo go to zero in one wasted shot!  Guess I‚Äôm scrapping that turd after all :p
---
Your comment made me remember how they have in game graffiti saying ‚Äúrobots will not replace us‚Äù and I‚Äôm literally talking about robots replacing players
---
That's 100% DLC but we don't know what it'll be. Whatever it is it's gonna be something cool and I wanna set up Camp there.
---
It only happens on the first shot if I remember correctly. Just put one cell in your inventory and fire, then it should work fine.
---
Day after the patch I found a level 50 anti armor one on a vendor.  Pretty sweet luck.
---
Yes and no. It‚Äôs only useful if you‚Äôre dry firing without any ammo. Basically using it as a high speed continuous bash attack. Which does stack with basher perks btw.
---
Basically... It does more DPS than anything. It‚Äôs fucking nuts. That said... it drains the durability faster than a 40 year old virgin nutting for the first time. But hot damn is it fun while it lasts 
---
TLDR if you‚Äôre using ammo stick to tri-Barrel + stabilized. If you‚Äôve ascended to a higher plane, use the shredder barrel and don‚Äôt stop til that shit breaks (within minutes)
---
Yeah certain items use up Alot of it
---
Thank-you for calling it MG42.
---
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Talk about projection. Where have I said that the melee nerf will happen "as the result" of the TSE nerf"? Why are you attributing causality, where none exists? TSE needed to be nerfed. Melee needs to be nerfed. TSE is getting nerfed. Melee nerf probably happening soon. Extrapolation? Yes. Slippery slope or claim of causality? No.
---
The genuinely hilarious thing about your whole slippery slope thing is that, even if it was slippery slope, it doesn't make me wrong!
---
The funny part is, slippery slope isn't even always a fallacy. It is a flawed argument, but not automatically invalid one. So even IF I made a slippery slope argument, it could still be correct. And yelling "slippery slope" doesn't disqualify it in any way.
---
&gt;Some people think that all slippery slope arguments are fallacies, bad arguments. I
---
just heard someone last week on cable TV claim this. It simply isn't true. There's
---
nothing automatically fallacious about this kind of reasoning. So, you can't say
---
"That's a slippery slope argument! It's a fallacy. We can reject it out of hand."
---

In short, even IF you were right, you still wouldn't be right, as paradoxical as that sounds.
---
As a lefty I like seeing it ..despite the character being rignt handed.. but irl I have to modify weapons to be ambidextrous or left handed ..maybe the dev that created the hunting rifle specifically was left handed and thought about it from his own perspective..
---
What system? Xbox/ps4/pc?
---
I made myself a challange to see how far I can get without spending a single special/lvl.up :) lvl16 atm.
---
To be fair this was mostly a unplanned challange since I had to start a new character to allocate special and perks better. But I can't figure out what I'll want to play with in the future. 
---
This is like real life, decide what you want to work as for the rest of your life while being a teenager deciding on your education.

I downvoted, then left it at that because I liked this joke a few months ago.

Blockers or filters on your network or PC?
---
I have a 2 shot one ...it leaves much to be desired despite being a full on rifle spec 
---
I hate the lazy ass way they did the PA hud for 21:9.  Instead of moving the HUD components to the screen edges they did nothing but slightly blurt the edges. So now my HUD just sits in the middle 2/3 of the screen.
---
I would have even been ok if they just stretched it to fit the screen, but not even that low effort was given.
---
Sorry just crusty about just how bad their 21:9 upgrade was done.
---
go explore? if your in a group or solo invest in the perks that give extra xp they both have one..

I think the only reason this isn‚Äôt done is because removing a perk could cause you to go over the 600 limit as items revert to their normal weight.  To do it, the perk cards used would have to be permanent or a check algorithm would have to be written to verify that removing a card doesn‚Äôt put you over the limit.  Otherwise, everyone would just equip all the weight reducing cards, stash crap, then remove them again. 
---
Exploring is what I‚Äôm doing and I do have an XP buff. I‚Äôm just asking what the best way to level up early is.
---
Can't build outlandishly large camps?

Okay: [https://imgur.com/a/xPbndmV](https://imgur.com/a/xPbndmV)

I downvoted you if that answers your question. 
---
I'm level 108 - today is the first day I used VATS.  I think the only time I'll use it is when the Scorchbeasts are going nuts with constant spamming those noise rings.

Otherwise, I almost never miss my target.

At least now you can use the screen edges to see trough walls with a 21:9 monitor... /s
---
&gt;the only way to get stronger enemies is to go for SBQ which is only "Difficult" because she's a bullet sponge
---
This is the single most frustrating thing about almost every game around. Game developers equate difficulty to the time taken to kill something. This leads to tougher enemies having stupidly high resists because that's far easier than making it tactical in any way.
---
It doesn't help that we literally have just the SBQ to fight as any kind of end game content and that's unforgivable. This isn't an early access title, it was sold as a full priced game with big promises. What we got was a highly unpolished port of Fallout 4 assets on a new map.

Even the three nuclear silos are copies with the exact same layout. How lazy can you get?

You can put down at least 7 - https://i.imgur.com/5x8rPHu.png

I didn't have the nuka paint yet for the 8th.
---
That‚Äôs where mine is and I‚Äôve never had a problem.  Sounds like you just got unlucky with a troll.  It could happen anywhere.
---
That'll be up to you whether the change in damage feels  satisfying or  not . Their blog post. It has all the values changed 
---
yeah that's just my kinda luck I guess
---
the fastest way was nuked whitesprings but they nerf the xp drop on enemies.. still is pretty good for xp though. but besides that events.. do any event that pops up doesnt matter if you complete or not still get xp. 
---
they really really need to start a dedicated balance team (not just bugs and content). for me bethesda rpgs always equaled open world adventures with terrible balance. you start semibalanced and by midgame there is no challenge left. most lazy balance by them was oblivion - not wanting to balance around weapons or armor or spells no... lets just autolevel enemies. autoleveled enemies in rpg is the most horrible thing ever. but sadly skyrim (just visited first city - here have a dragon fight, cool you slayed a dragon here have a dragon soul) and f4 had that problem too, but as many had said all that is fine if its a single player game (altho dissapointing), but mp equals meta and like it or not its a delicate thing. its gonna be interesting to watch how they do balance this time.
---
They‚Äôre not nerfing TSEs exclusively. What they‚Äôre doing is nerfing the two effects individually. TS is being nerfed to only a 25% bonus as opposed to 100%. E is being nerfed to 20%. 
---
In other words, your exploding guns, despite not being TSEs will be nerfed. 
---
Run with a group of higher levels, hit the enemy's they kill once, then you'll get the xp. If you need a group and your on xbox, I'll help
---
How?  These were taken without the perk on - another bug?!?
---
At your level you havent touched much, also do quests it helps
---
Indeed a projection.
---
&gt; ...because after TSE, melee is the biggest offender when it comes to doing obscene damage. It's perfectly logical progression of events, and has nothing to do with retaliation or spite.¬†
---
A perfectly logical progression of events that, after TSE, melee will be next. You're reading this, right?
---
The consequence of the TSE nerf is that melee will be the next logical progression.
---
The consequence of one action has a direct result of an unrelated action.
---
You're following along, right?
---
&gt; ... in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a¬†chain of related events¬†culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.
---
This is what you pasted, right?
---
The question was "Why does this have to be a slippery slope?" and not a statement of "you are wrong". You are out in the grass again.
---
Hooefully just bugged even if not its still pretty light considering the norm also are you on xbox and is that mini furious explosive by chance?...getting desperate üòÜ
---
Wish in game clock would display this. Also wish there was a way to display my real world time so I can not keep staying up to 3am.
---
That's actually why I specified the stash having its own perk slots, not a lot, just like 3-6. Sorry, thought I made that part clear.
---
When I tested it I did 15, 20, 22 and 31 and 20, 22 and 32 all gave the same bonus. I measured it by the bonus damage melee weapons get from the white bonus bar.
---
Basically, bonus durability caps at the same point Weapon Artisan and Fix it Good repair up to: 200%. 20 Int gets you there.
---
Thank you for your feedback.  Your opinion is important to us. 
---
I do wonder about that sometimes. Were we meant to naturally progress between weapon systems, not just pick one?
---
What I mean is, melee blooms early. You get your first melee perk at lvl 5, I think? You get your ROF and weight melee perks before lvl 20. And so on. Melee is very, very viable, very very early. Heavy guns, on the other hand, really don't work until late game. It is impossible to equip one before lvl 20. You don't get your first heavy gun perk until lvl 30. And it's not finished until lvl 52 at least (Master Heavy Gunner is lvl 50). 
---
Did they mean for us to start as melee, then slowly migrate to rifles and shotguns, and then finally graduate to heavy armor and heavy weapons for endgame? I mean, this build doesn't work until way late in the game. Heavy guns need Stabilized, Stabilized needs PA, PA isn't truly usable until late 40s either (Power Patcher, Power User, etc.) 
---
Would make sense, then, that the game is balanced towards automatic heavy weapons. 
---
üëç
---
Nah cultist gear
---
Why not accelerated barrel brrrt for more DPS? If I want ammo economy, might as well go gatlin
---
20 percent less damage?
---
An entirely separate set of perks for the stash?  I don‚Äôt see that happening. I could see them allowing us to lock a few weight reducing perks and have them apply to the stash though, but even that has little chance of happening.
---
All you need is enforcer perk or one man army to force sbq to land while keeping the op melee build.
---
On PC you can scroll through the perks from different special categories with the c and z keys. If you at your level all perks are available you just have to find them in the list to select them. Again for you issues I would recommend the Lone Wander perk which is in the Charisma tree and the Blocker perk in the Melee tree as well as looking for a radsuit. They can be found a few different places including power plants.
---
I hope this helps. Good luck and keep playing :)
---
I never understood the +2int PA mod as you cannot craft in PA at all.
---
I'm sorry but for every cool idea somebody puts forth for this game all I can think of is how buggy it will be and ultimately be a waste of the players resources. They'll cost tons of springs, gears, and screws and then the robot will either break somehow, or disappear, or glitch out and become hostile. I think we'll have to wait until private servers with mods come out before we get anything cool because modders can troubleshoot and fix their mods a thousand times faster and more efficiently than Bethesda.
---
And you sound like a synth.
---
Had awful amounts of it and vendor caps 200 a day...
---
Now I use it to craft, lol
---
You wish!  
---
As of now the explosive effect increases damage by 100% iirc. They‚Äôre reducing that to only 20%. In other words, your splodey gun that does 200 damage will now only do 120, a 40% reduction. 
---
My biggest issue is less about price and more about how they aren't delivering the skins for more than one or two items... Just sell them in bundles got all the skins and run individual skins as limited items or sales. 
---
Worst thing that could happen for me would be my ideal skin coming out exclusively for a weapon I hate or don't use. 
---
I‚Äôd like to see a nuke dropped on the area between Anne‚Äôs Bunker and Excelsior Model Home. Pretty sure it‚Äôs Southampton Estate?
---
I don't like it when people destroy my stuff either but wasn't this supposed to be an option for people roleplaying from the beginning? Also, I'm pretty certain people can't grief kill you while you're in pacifist mode and don't attack them. If you're at a workshop and someone tries to take it then I think it automatically takes you out of pacifist temporarily (not sure why) and also makes you vulnerable to their full damage. I was defending one of my workshops from super mutants one time and even though I was in pacifist mode, a level 300 something griefer killed me immediately with a TSE shotgun for no reason. I then came back to get my junk and he did it again because I chose seek revenge which definitely turns off pacifist mode. Kind of a dumb system.
---
Make sure to get well rested for added xp bonus. Also doing the feed the people event gives you canned meat stew with xp bonus and path to enlightment grants you xp bonus st the end as well. 
---
Will do mate! 
---
Yeah the whole NPC thing boils down to the fact that they could have done it with any number of the NPCs they did include. Watoga could be all interactable bots but they chose not to. 
---
I do suspect that may be coming tho. When I launched my first nuke the automotron like robots that help you launch it tell me at the very least we may get unique bots like that in the future in some capacity. 
---
Not sure if we'll own the but we'll see. If they don't do anything with the bot stop stations all over the place place tells me that at some point we're going to need to summon bots or have the means to at some point. The stations are all over Appalachia being unused. Plus they all have terminals at them 
---
Not almost, it is one.
---
Well not separate cards, so much as a few card slots that are separate from your build, and apply specifically to your stash. Basically just the normal weight reduction cards, but allowing you to apply a couple specifically to your stash. It was just a thought ü§∑
---
You only need 6 at most.  Raider, excavator, t45, t51b, t60, x01
---
Thats not accounting for the explosive buff card though thats still a bunch of damage
---
Vendors cap at 1400 a day. There are 7 vendor cap pools, each with 200 caps.  I say pools because all the Whitesprings vendors share caps, all the responders and all the raiders vendors do too.  Watoga, BoS, Modus, and the one in Harpers Ferry are unique. 
---
This isn't even 76 and doesn't belong here.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Screw this glaring bug that completely ruins a unique weapon! We gotta fix the meat stew bug first!

I'm stuck at that point myself. Crafted all the motors just to be short one (had all the materials). Logged out and back in hoping it would reset and now i'm stuck where your at.

Holy crap, he's making the game look like New Vegas
---
We dont give a shit about someone using hacks for fallout new vegas....
---
L105 mate, I know how it works :)
---
Was back when I *wasn't using it* as an ingredient and didn't have weight reduce perks
---
True. The demo expert will let you double the bonus, so in my example that‚Äôs 140 instead of 120. That‚Äôs an even bigger hit as now you‚Äôre down less than half of what it was (300, which would be 100 base, 100 from explosion, and 100 bonus from demo expert). 
---
White Knight is in the Agilty tree, Power Patcher and the perk to make fusions cores last longer (name is escaping me) are in Intelligence.
---
Or just build your base on a lead node and never need to farm it again. I moved off the node a week ago and still have over 400. Steel is what I am constantly out of and with the scrapper perk and a run through west tek grabbing all the weapons I get like 500 steel.
---
Still trying to find some legit proof it exists that's not from the dev room, anyone find at least a video of someone wearing it or some more pics?
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
So the two shots only deal 70 each or 140 each?
---
Mole rat detected
---
Can't believe you wasted that 10 damage!
---
That did it. Much appreciated 
---
I always just sold it. Only crap I dumped was worthless junk i didn‚Äôt want to waste plastic to sell. 
---
Your bit about the vendor cap implied you were unaware not all vendors shared the same cap pool. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people unsure of how the vendor caps work, thinking someone else could drain them or that they could only get 200/day. 
---
I agree, but we still need cool content. I‚Äôm a console peasant (I know there will be console mods but if Fallout 4 is any indication of what that will be like, it won‚Äôt be good; especially on ps4) So I need actual content from Bethesda. This is absolutely something modders could easily do though since it‚Äôs just porting a feature from fallout 4.
---
I had to buy a giant clock to remind me :)
---
Yeah, I'd say a good 50% of my overall kills is with the gauss+tesla rifle. Mobility+dmg mutations so I can jump on rooftops to snipe and tesla so I can roast entire packs of ghouls instantly with one sneak crit. It's so much more fun than just punching everything in 1 hit with instigating power fist that doesn't even require you to have dmg perks.
---
That's not true tho, I've never seen it decrease damage unless they just changed it recently 
---
It was someone's hard work. 
---
ps4 player here.. for junk the only thing you should save are gears,plastic,screws,springs. those are common essentials for almost everything plastic is to bulk junk and make it weigh less in stash 
---
as for weapons i wouldnt really worry about it to much trying to find good weapons because as you level up the weapons you find will keep getting better than what you have max cap for weapons are either 45 or 50  depending on the weapon  just pick up and go 
---
as for mods scrap excess weapons you have to unlock mods for that weapon not sure what lvl but under  intelligence tree there is a perk called scrapper helps with getting extra chance with mods and matierial
---
as for what you should do its up to you. side quest events for more xp, explore more areas of the map on the east dont go to west more high leveled hope what i had said is helpful for you in your journey
---
Since it's late, I'm gonna go discover that location. I'll do it tomorrow morning and I'll post it here and try to tag you and give you some credit
---
Nope, nope, nooooooope.
---
You keep assigning equivalence willy-nilly. Progression of events doesn't mean causality. Like I just finished saying above, TSEs needed a nerf. Melees needed a nerf. TSEs are getting a nerf. Therefore it's likely melee is getting a nerf, as the second worst offender. The two things are separate, without any causality between them. Both needed a nerf. But since one already happened, it is a logical progression that the next is about to happen as well. Melee nerf does NOT happen as a consequence of TSE nerf, but as a logical progression of a series of nerfs (and buffs) since the game launched.
---
So, to recap, at no point did I say "as a consequence", that is entirely your own doing.
---
And your last paragraph, I don't know how to respond to, because it doesn't make any sense in English language. You were the one who brought up the words "slippery slope". I since then tried to figure out who said anything about slippery slope. Nobody but you. You keep insisting what I said was a slippery slope. Even if it was, to what point? I provided a quote and source above that says that even IF it were a slippery slope, it still doesn't mean anything for the veracity of the argument. So...what are you even trying to say at this point? I am genuinely lost.
---
Steel is really easy to come by, so I would definitely move to a place more out of the way
---
Ah ok I knew one of the perks did. Is it agi that has the card to only use 85% for crits?
---
Was only talking about the explosive effect, not talking about TS. Both were nerfed individually so Two-Shot guns are getting hit too, even they aren‚Äôt exploding. Same for exploding guns without the two-shot effect like OP has. 
---
The TS guns will get a 25% bonus to damage over base instead of the current 100%. If your TS gun does 200 damage, it will now do 125, a 37.5% reduction. 
---
What you qualify as a "great" game, is eye-brow raising.
---
&gt; In cases where you are contacted, there will be leniency towards folks that cease participation in these activities. There will be greater consequences ‚Äì including permanent bans from the game ‚Äì for players that continue take advantage of these exploits.
---
If you honestly did that, I feel like you can just tell them and they'll be like ".....ooook, well, sense we can't prove this, just please drop it and don't go picking up 50,000 of something again"
---
They are used. I don‚Äôt know if it counts as spoilers to tell you what they‚Äôre used for but they‚Äôre used for a primary faction‚Äôs quest. They could definitely be uses for this too though.
---
Nope. Not any that I know of. Even tried on my friend's network and same result. He tried as well and nothing...
---
What... Is it us? ...Are we it?
---
I dunno about events, they‚Äôre bullet sponges.
---
I use accelerated barrel when I rock the shredder. But tri-barrel is best if you want to actually shoot stuff with it. 
---
I just got a nocturnal minigun with +40 bashing damage and I equipped the shredder and I did the heart of the swamp at midnight gametime and it was foolishly efficient 
---
All I know is I got it and was all excited, then looked at my TS handmade and it went from 180 something down to like 85 with class freak and all 3 rifleman's maxed out. Once I got rid of that mutation my damage went back up. 
---
No leave the area man, get far enough away so you can trigger it again. At least what I thought.
---
I get the feeling that it only spawns around the area of flatwoods. As the only time I see the Mothman is in the Forest area.
---
Depending on legendaries pretty much means the game is too constrained.
---
Anyone know if the paint we extends to a recon scope? I always hated the weird color the recon scope where and how they looked on my rifles. If this paint colors them as well maybe.
---
Probably a dumb question, but where do you see your daily/weekly challenges? 
---
He also admitted to being supplied by dupers a d basically said he misses using stolen duped goods.
---
You are measured by the company you keep and you openly said many of your friends have been banned for duping.
---
Yea just saw a video about this. Gonna try it tomorrow. 
---
Wow, well i imagine an explosive gun is still powerful
---
Either it's a glitch or they did a stealth nerf.....again
---
Thanks man, I appreciate that. Looking forward to seeing what you find. 
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda so it can be patched. Eventually they‚Äôll bring the ban hammer down on anyone deliberately using a glitch. 
---
Pretty much means that's your opinion and not a fact.
---
It has AoE damage, but I don‚Äôt know if they said whether it would be the bonus damage that was AoE or all of it.  
---
Awful for heavy weapons sadly. Ever machine gun bullet counts as much as a sniper rifle shot
---
It might be where you're placing your camp? I know there are some popular locations where building a camp will block a random encounter.
---
One specific example is the pond next to Charleston Station. There's a rare vendor you can get to spawn there, but won't if there's a camp present. I've seen people say they will destroy camps when they find them in locations like this.
---
Or you're just really unlucky and run into more assholes than I do.
---
I kinda understand where people are coming from but I see your point of view as well, I'm assuming you are not a low level. If you are you are atleast knowledgeable about the game and have put some time into your build. Say the Tse weapons are OP the same can be accomplished with the right build with non Tse weapons in pvp, I know I can take shots from explosive weapons and my gear isn't exactly top notch, it's the perks I have and the chems I use before I get into a fight, I have a TSE prime lmg as well and I have a build centered around that as well.i guess what I'm trying to say is a lvl 50 isn't going to have the same gear or weapons or perks as a lvl 125 or a lvl 200, that's time spent for those items and it shows in pvp which makes sense, in any of the previous fallout games you wouldn't just rush a lvl 50 behemoth at lvl 5 or a deathclaw. I admit the Tse weapons and other good builds are crazy effective but they take time to get there. In any rpg levels count and contrary to popular belief someone that's a higher level in fallout most likely has some form of advantage, not saying it's impossible for a lvl 5 to kill a lvl 50 deathclaw. It's just hard. Having a Tse makes you the deathclaw and that means they need a bit more preparation. The nerf will hit hard but it still won't make the guns useless so no worries there. In all honesty they need to fix bobble heads and the fact that some people can stand still and tank shots constantly without losing health. Even with your gauss or my prime lmg all perked out we wouldn't be able to scratch someone with enough bobble heads or the right armor. If anything those should be nerfed. 
---
Added!
---
watch the live action trailer for the game. The ending scene they're around a camp fire with a pet deathclaw and Mr. Handy.
---
My guess is they have bigger plans for the robot CAMP system than what was ready at release so they kept it removed. Left in what was ready for animals as it's semi workable, then left it for the future updates.
---
It's obviously intended, Robotics Expert is in game and it's clear the framework is there. Just gotta wait unfortunately.
---
yeah i guess now she has a poison damage aura sometimes, its similar to the damage of her swooping but its constant around her and also she puts off a radiation aura. This is great for my unarmed build because it drains my ap to 0 in half a second, and i go down and when i'm picked up for revenant i literally just go right back down and can't be alive longer than half a second. Gotta love this end game update! :) when the aura is active she has a frostlike aura thats visible. 
---
I have had this same issue crafting mods for guns
---
I'm not sure if his name makes this better or worse
---
Cheers thank you man! Was very helpful actually.
---
Yep yep yep yep yep yep.
---
"Logical progression" were the words used. You continued the suggestion with statements like "with TSE out of the way". You said that. The melee nerf will happen as a logical progression of the TSE nerf once TSE is out of the way.
---
A logical progression from point A to point B requires starting at A and you most certainly started at A to reach B and C and D.
---
You'll also remember me suggesting that melee was probably already more balanced (or at least had more options) and may not even need a change. The reasons TSE were nerfed may have absolutely nothing to do with the damage, but rather the options for damage mitigation (you'll remember we talked about plates, etc).
---
Somehow you haven't made a straight line with the statement "a logical progression" and insist you never implied that a logical progression was occuring when.... that's literally what you wrote.
---
It wasn't *my fault* I stole the money! The bank shouldn't have left the safe open!
---
Lol I lost sooo many friends....üò≥üôÑüòÇ
---
What do you need all that steel for? I constantly have way more than is needed. 
---
You guys gonna put this on your tombstones? For what good it does since nobody is going back in time. 
---
You could also try to be ahead of the pack and find more places to nuke.
---
No, legendaries by definition, not opinion, will not be available to everyone.  Especially those which require more than one star, as do all the weight reduction ones you use.  This is, in fact, a game design issue.
---
I use it primarily as my cure for hunger lol. I didnt know it was rare to see. 
---
If you play in a team rad sponge, radicool is great if you don't have a choice with the radiation. Other than that there's some reg armor that I think has rad resistance but other than that you need a hazmat suit or radx and rad away. Diluted rad x if you have mutations. Most radiation related perks just give you nice boosts and not really any rad resistance. 
---
This is interesting, we have 2 types of ‚Äúbody takeover‚Äù enemies in Appalachia, I wonder if there is a conflict there I haven‚Äôt seen, or that hasn‚Äôt come up yet.
---
What if we have to join the strangler faction to battle the scorched!  
---
But that is how EVERY mmo is. High level and high tier people always beat lowers. Taking away our best pve weapon is not the answer. Make fire proof cancel up to 90% of explosive damage and boom pvp is fixed with us still being able to fight the queen without having an army.
---
Factually incorrect
---
PSA: Do not place anything that you can interact with like a chair or workbench near something that you can reach through. I have broken in and out of CAMPs by accessing workbenches through windows or gaps and getting out by using chairs placed on porches.
---
Not.
---
‚ÄúPower Patcher‚Äù and ‚ÄúFix It Good‚Äù. The first reduces repair cost significantly and the latter you may already have as it applies to both regular armor and PA. 
---
I don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs much good PA specific for a rifleman build. Make sure to replace any DT buff perks (like ‚ÄúEvasive‚Äù or ‚ÄúBarbarian‚Äù) as they don‚Äôt apply when in PA.  I‚Äôd also set out looking for the stealth-boy mod.
---
You don‚Äôt need any weight reducing perks for the PA itself. Yes the pieces are stupid heavy, but if you put them on a frame the entire unit only weighs 10lb. 
---
Turrets should be limited to 4 of each type of, so you can have 24 total
---
Maybe the dmg maxes out at the 5 cells it's meant to use
---
I haven't even played in a week, I could give a shit
---
Carrying 18 weapons is completely unnecessary. I do not need the legendary armor to play this game how I want to. The legendary armor is allowing me to play the game in a way that is obnoxious.
---
I would prefer to keep TSE and eliminate PVP.  
---
Man that is just the worst. Took me a week to recover my cells. 
---
I agree 100% I would prefer if it didn't get nerfed at all as well. I know that is an unpopular opinion but like I said, other things deserve a nerf over Tse. 
---
Claim wade airport and lakeside cabins. Then defend them. Wash rinse and repeat.
---
They also had a girl dual wielding SMGs and spinning in a circle. I wouldn't trust the live action trailer to be indicative of game features.
---
What was his name?, cause there‚Äôs been a guy going around stream sniping around lvl 175 and just destroying peoples bases 
---
Tried nuke zones a couple of times. Marine armour, wet suit and rad X helped but I feel a decent set of PA would help. Especially when I get mobbed by glowing bloated ones. 
---
That‚Äôs the fastest method, if you don‚Äôt mind respawning more often and feeling weak. 
---
Linkie no workie.
---
I love that they shoot green lasers! I want to use one so bad but i cant use it before needing to change to another, usually ballistic weapon that has 20x the durability.
---
I wonder if it comes down to luck or... what... I hear people have experiences like this in the game and I haven't had any of that yet. I never played it as MP though. I never accept team invites or add people as friends. Zero people on my friends list in game. (On PC here so no external friends list). I have seen maybe... two or three people with wanted levels over 100 the whole time I've been playing (level 70ish been playing since November). I have a pretty conspicuously placed house too, which I figured would definitely get wrecked by now at least once, but nope.
---
By the time you get to Watoga naturally you have already outleveled the drop table for the plans. I had to take an alt to 15 just to get them.
---
Thanks for that, man. I really appreciate it. Have a good weekend.
---
The only energy weapon that can be used is the gauss rifle. Everything else breaks too quick and deals too small damage numbers.
---
it was alphax_shark
---
If you want to go to the extreme level find a building  that allows for camp something with doors and walls intact,build no turrets You can have every bench and a full farm for a quarter of the budget.
---
Also make sure to capture a workshop when you log in. You‚Äôll get XP and plans for your C.A.M.P. for defending them along with any resources they produce.
---
Go ahead and make fun, but eventually they‚Äôll catch on. Camp items that are (I presume) actually outside of the map is a big issue. 
---
They did fix the outside the map issue in the silos didn‚Äôt they?  I was thinking they had and were pretty quick about that one. 
---
Damn .. I haven't played all the way through the quests. Level like 220 tho haha. Egg + my face 
---
I am confused: that sounded like you just said you are playing the game differently than you want to.
---
Please enjoy your game.  I don‚Äôt need to flog this dead horse any further.
---
Hit the gyms and scrap all the weights for easy lead if that's the ingredient holding u back from crafting ammo. It was for me
---
It was easy enough to do that the [modders could get it done](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214). Small problem, Bethesda won't give us a straight answer on what is an acceptable mod and what might get your in trouble.
---
"it's not even bad."
---
It's shit. Like actually, it's a garbage game. If I was feeling charitable, I'd give it a 3.5/10. Every other day when i'm not feeling charitable, I'd give it a bleedin' 2.
---
you should focus on what build you want to run look up online for viable builds once you hit lvl 50 you can no longer put points in the special tree(str,per,end ect. you can still pick out perk cards each level you just cant add another point to special.but each lvl afrer 50 your given the option to use that lvl to move 1 point from any special to another (Example take point of str and put it to end)  do that you cant pick a perk card you still recieve 4 random perk cards every 5 lvls
---
each weapon( pistols, shotguns, autorifles, semi rifles, 1H melee, 2Hmelee &amp; heavy guns all have 3perks that can you can level up 3 times each for 9 points in total for 60% more damage.. hope that makes sense
---
They could use the shit emoji and it would be an improvement over the current system.
---
And Ultracite.
---
I would assume that BGS will remove the massive stacks of items before returning control to you. They're slow and sloppy, but they aren't morons.
---
It was dumb of me to say that it‚Äôs spoilers since you‚Äôve launched a nuke so you obviously know the enclave is there. It‚Äôs an Enclave event. I forget what it‚Äôs called.
---
It doesn't surprise me that you are confused. Have a nice life. Hopefully you don't spend the rest of it trolling Reddit.
---
An accidental dupe....  right...  
---
Seriously though, just move away from the spawn point. It can‚Äôt be all that great that you‚Äôd tolerate the SBs all the time.  If you have difficulty fighting them, then you really should move.  It‚Äôll save you a lot of headache. 
---
Idk I noticed it about two weeks ago. I ended up removing all my mutations just to get rid of it. 
---
I'd have to watch it but I would think that choice to include them gives a little idea into what they envisioned. There's for sure a bunch of stuff in the game that seem like first steps to greater features. They knew it wouldn't be finished on time so they're in the game like a teaser.
---
it's totally possible the marketers just knew about the camp me mechanic and assumed certain features or at the time were planned but we're scaled back
---
Yeah, i noticed this.
---
I LOVE the idea of reduced weight meaning heavies can come along for the regular adventures.
---
Unfortunately, whats the point of a weapon without its mods? Which can weight HUGE amounts making it mostly useless.
---
I know that you can sometimes trigger respawns that way, but the reason so many people server hop Whitespring etc. and use that log off and rejoin method which a solo player can't really do on PS4 at least, is to make up for there not being good fast respawning already a part of it without metagaming some trigger system. The problems are too many people fighting over the same mobs for one thing, unless people are considerate and let everyone tag the mob. Faster respawning would solve a lot of problems. And the server hopping thing is probably responsible for some of the server problems. Fast respawns would solve a lot of server hopping. When people grind in MMOs they like to just grind mobs nonstop. Only stopping to loot and take some consumables and then back to grinding. It would just make it a much better experience if there was higher abundance of mobs and respawns I think.
---
...your worst nightmare 
---
I use it now too. I haven‚Äôt come across another player using it since that interaction. It just started me because I was a really low level (5 or 6) and his high level self just came out of nowhere!
---
Nah they Beam Slpitters on their weapons and they broke after 5 shots
---
I'm not sure what you mean by investing heavily?
---
I've been kicking around in a plain set of T-60 armour for a while now.  It's only recently, at level 80, that I've been hunting for PA mods for the T-60, just to see what this puppy can do when fully modded.   
---
I picked up the pieces a few at a time while doing various quests and checking out the BoS sites, etc., and just repaired them.  I have the Power Patcher and Fix it Good perks maxed out so I repair it to 200%.
---
Gotcha I know I've seen it on the map but assumed it would be boring, escorting a bot while it rambles and wastes my time. 
---
Probably where it says you have to build them then escort them right?
---
We're they regular protections and stuff?
---
It's terrible design, it's metagame crud for a rich RPG world that never needed it. But sure, go ahead and add a meta-layer of nonsense between the player and the world.
---
Even worse, it's exploitable. There's a mod with 20k downloads that lets you swap out perk card loadouts with a single button click.
---
Which is obviously abusable in PVP. Start with a ranged loadout, switch to melee, switch to escape loadout if you're losing.
---
PvP  is literally unplayable because of duped TSE, bobblehead binging, perk card cheaters, and other exploits.
---
You don't know what hard work is. 
---
The lack of this feature IS why I walked away from the game.
---
Getting killed by mystery-damage-from-nowhere while my health was low was irritating enough, but then being disconnected from the server before I could go collect my sizable pile of junk was too much. The game had stolen my time from me too many times. I was done.
---
My only guess is that it's a copy and paste from fallout 4, but I'm not sure. I'm still working through 4 and my character is mostly sneak/rifles so I've only used PA a hand full of times.
---
No it‚Äôs an assortment of robots that you defend
---
&gt; And starting this week, our Customer Support team has become better equipped and more vigilant in the practice of suspending and/or banning players we identify as using exploits in the game.
---
How does it take this long? Four months after it's released, when most players are already gone? Should've been addressed in the beta, if you bothered to have a real beta, instead of just a marketing gimmick.
---
Me too. Mine has the prime receiver, which when I crafted it I did not realize meant it needed ultracite 556 haha. That stuff is hard to come by. We need bigger stash sizes for all these mats 
---
Ticks. Outside of the Vault there is the Moonshiner Shack and lumber mill. Tons of reliably spawned ticks there. Scrap their buts and you should get plenty. 
---
If you build a siren at your base it will... sometimes... alert you your base is under attack. Otherwise you have to be looking at the map in the 10 second window it takes to level your stuff with an explosive weapon.
---
Damn,I love the look of the mix and match bots. If we do get them hopefully we can build ours from scratch or mod one we take over in the wastelabf. Seeing as they already designed the automotron bot crafting
---
Worst game I've played in years....
---
Dunno, but it shouldn't
---
Does anyone think past limited time item offers will come around again? I had missed the blue/white hot rod flames power armor paint, and a lot of people ask me about my Blackbird. 
---
They also had location after location that you'd find in game. So, while silly, seems a little on point. The beginning was supposed to feel more dream sequency. Hell, everyone in the last scene with the scorch beast has an in game costume on.
---
I'd expect it
---
Can we also do complete resets on our perk trees so we can try different builds? Im basically a mix of melee and rifleman but i want to go full melee. But im 54 so id have to level up like 20 more times to put all the points i want into the trees then upgrade the cards to the max
---
You are still badly confused.
---
"Logical progression" were the words I used. I also said "with TSE out of the way". I did say that. Yes, melee nerf will happen as a logical progression of TSE nerf once TSE nerf is out of the way. Maybe not verbatim, but basically I said it, yes. 
---
Where you are confused is that logical progression requires causality. Here's a definition of "logical progression" for you:
---
&gt;any order of events or things that makes sense.  
---
Notice "any order of events"? Notice how earlier I said "TSE needed a nerf. Melee needed a nerf." Those are two separate things. They are events. And they can happen in any order. It just so happened that TSE nerf happened first. Which means...drumroll please...there's no causality here. If there's no causality, then there's no "from point A to point B", and therefore...second drumroll please...no slippery slope!
---
The state of balance of melee, or the reasons for TSE nerf, are indeed debatable. But it has nothing to do with slippery slope you keep accusing me of. This is you moving goal posts yet again.
---
I cannot make a straight line from "a logical progression" to "slippery slope", because none exists. Because you don't know what these phrases mean. Even though I gave you definitions of both during our conversation. Like I said, very early on, "slippery slope" doesn't mean what you think it means. To that, I now have to add that "logical progression" doesn't mean what you think it means either. You keep implying that logical progression requires and/or contains causality. That is not the case. These are completely unrelated things. Just like earlier you confused "magnitude" with "order of magnitude".
---
So I'm going to wrap this up. So far you've erroneously accused me of making a "slippery slope" argument. I'm not sure why, because even if it were, it doesn't automatically make it fallacious (see quote and PDF above). You made statements, and when asked to provide proof, first attempted to shift the burden of proof onto me (and we're not in court, if you make a statement, you are not right until you are proven wrong, burden of proof is still on you), and then refused/were unable to provide it. You moved goal posts too many times to count, all the time accusing me of running out of grass. You attempted, several times, to assign causality to my statements, where none exist. And then you attempted to conflate "what I literally wrote" with things you figuratively pulled out of your bum. When confronted with your fallacies, you simply dropped them and moved on to build a new strawman argument, using my quotes, yet inferring from them things entirely of your own, yet still attributing them to me as a statement of fact.  
---
I am sick and tired of you. I am going to bed. Please don't be offended, but I am blocking you from future communication.
---
Yeah, you need to listen to the highest **Order of Mysteries - Rank:**  X holotape in your inventory to complete it.  I think that the ranks are Initiate, Novice, Seeker, Misteress.
---
My ding ding dong
---
Have a poorly designed mechanic that can easily be abused? no worries just give players the option to ignore it!
---
"Had" moved away in a couple of hours. Was a great spot with two resources in the area I was doing quests and exploring.
---
Good luck man all the power to you, i created a new acount today and you've inspired me to not trade for op gear and do it on my own, I'd join you but im on PC.
---
Ammo, automatic combat rifle. I have an explosive shotgun that can just one shot everything and make ammo last forever but I try not to use it because it kills any fun left in the game. Which is ridiculous considering it's just a lvl 35 double barrel and I'm not even specced into shotguns, very happy explosive and two shot are being nerfed.
---
has anyone found the recipe for rad-x? not the diluted form, the regular form?, and was buffout confirmed at enclave?

It's on this list as a purchasable plan/mod:

The Harper's Ferry vendor stocks hunting rifle receiver plans, but I'm not sure about the combat rifle receivers as I never wanted one. Maybe the outer responders like Grafton/Welch/Camden.
---
This is a cool thing to do!
---
I didn't know because the ultrasight on there wings glow
---
Ah, that would be nice. But yeah I got tired of being able to easily obtain what I want so I'm deciding to make a new character to grind for everything this time 
---
There‚Äôs a nice spot not far from Vault 76 that has both steel and copper inside the build area. 
---
Just curious though, where were you that you had two nodes inside?  SBs don‚Äôt bother me.  They‚Äôre easy ultracite. 
---
Sorry. Are you sticking it to Bethesda or the sorry kinds of people who say stuff like "It's not an exploit bruh. It's in the game. I can play however I want"?
---
Its like an ironman mode
---
Not sure it's worth mentioning because it's definetly not advised but even wearing a torso chest and a couple other pieces helps with the ghouls for me. (only because scorchbeast have a tendency to tear my PA apart) I usually use mismatched armor so I really only benifit from the fact that it's unyielding and vanguard so I'm still squishy without it for the most part. A full set of PA offers amazing rad resistance, another helpful tip there's one set that requires practically no resources to repair (sorry I can't remember atm it's been a long day) 
---
Yup, totally their fault for your decision to abuse bugs to gain an advantage in the game because you are to weak willed to play legitimately and fairly like 90% of the playerbase. I mean, it's not like you want to keep playing anyhow, getting banned before the new content even comes out and the game evolves into something amazing like ESO did is all the rage these days.
---
Trivette was the real hero.
---
I have never seen someone try so hard to not understand something.
---
There isn't even a reason to assume more nerfs are incoming and this person is still begging that their statement of melee being nerfed next (and then bloodied, etc) as a result of TSE being nerfed can't be a slippery slope _because they don't like that term_.
---
It's rewarding when a blithering idiot chooses to just stop.
---
I would also like to know why we‚Äôre shooting a left handed gun right handed
---
I got your point, but I don't feel like it looks glowing to me. Glowing enemies usually really, yknow, glow.
---
I'm on PC, but I'm kinda hoping to do the opposite. I started a new character, she'll be my twink. I've already given her a bunch of plans, some lowbie armor (none of it legendary, though), and some caps. I'd like to get her to 50 doing as few of the quests as possible, and get her mutations, before I actually start the quests. My reason for this is, some of the quest rewards are pretty nice, but they don't level up, and I'd like to see if any of them are truly something special at max level. Plus, I just got mutations on my main (level 100) about 10 levels ago, and I'd like to get them earlier and have the use of them while questing.  
---
I didn't do a great deal of grinding on my main, so it won't bother me too badly (I hope) to do some on this one.
---
Write a request to Bethesda studios to restore your equipment then - they DO have the tools

It‚Äôs another infuriating thing: ‚Äûcustomer support‚Äú no actually ‚ÄûSUPPORTING CUSTOMERS‚Äú

Didn't realize there were ones in silos.

Excavator gives me 535lb of carry weight with shocks so long as I dont die or get out, X01 is 335 even with shocks, guess which one I use and why. (Excavator is 435 if I die or get out forcing me to relog to get back to 535)
---
Yea just thought id ask and see if there was testing
---
No, because 
---
I went looking for the Giant Bear on the very bottom right of the map...   I found two and they batted me back and forth like a pinata...
---
Did you bless your C.A.M.P. first?
---
What the heck. I must've wandered past this spot dozens and dozens of times and never saw it.
---
There is, or was.  I watched a guy do it. Right at the entrance there is, or was, a way to jump outside the map using Marsupial. Doing so let you skip all the BS and go directly to the control room right after stepping off the elevator. 
---
I know it worked because he did it and mere seconds later I hear launch prep starting. 
---
That makes sense till you look at the Light Machine Gun and Gatling Gun, with 16 damage from a .308 and 44 damage from a 5mm.
---
r/fo76bazaar would be better
---
I actually prefer
---
It's not my fault I cheated on you with your brother while he lived with us. If you hadn't built that spare bedroom he wouldn't have been here and it wouldn't have happened. 
---
it was before the dev room, but it was still involving Cheat Engine and other 3rd party programs (not just mods; things like shader "mods" that involve stuff outside the Mod folder like directX injections). Also, as far as anyone knows, only one person was told to write an essay, and that seems to have been a joke on the part of the CS person.
---
One player with enforcer and shotgun... 10 players with any melee weapon. It's gonna be LIT (it's gonna fucking suck)
---
For the Chinese officer sword. 
---
There's a secret bunker under Mama Dolce's factory. There are 3 swords in the factory plus a power armor. Be aware of turrets as you enter. Lol
---
Here's a video link: https://youtu.be/0frQs1ocJrk
---
I'm currently level 87 and never use power armor, only keeping a chassis to put ultracite armor on it. It's not that bad actually, for nuke zones I just hop in a hazmat suit and keep moving. Can't die if they don't hit ya! Also helps that I'm a completely ranged player so I don't have to get all up close and dead in that hazmat suit
---
That would be moronic as they wouldn't increase the budget for it they would just chunk out the current budget hurting people who don't use plants or turrets
---
Nothing, they won‚Äôt even respond to my appeal, I just want to know if they are even considering so I can stop waiting.
---
It only affects enemies with 'Glowing' on their name.
---
Right. Triple the damage 1/3 of the attack speed sounds good

They helped me refund their garbage product they call "fallout 76"

It is just west of Cranberry Bog north of a lake (can't remember the name ATM). So there is Acid in a cave and lead above the cliff. To get both in you must:
---
1. Go to the lead deposit.
---
2.Scale your self halfway down the cliff.
---
3. Place camp there on the side of the cliff.

It is the best endgame location IMO.

And 5 lv 10 noobs in the shed with there combat rifle that does 6 damage a shot 
---
Heckin go check it out bud
---
Let the noobs get involved. How can any other player "ruin" your experience just by being there. It detracts from your gameplay in no way at all. It's a multiplayer, open world game. Get used to the noobs or find something with skill based matchmaking.
---
Take this downvote. 
---
A pox upon you, sir.
---
Good day.

With the TSE nerf scorchbeasts will be more annoying then ever. Waste all your time and ammo for trash drop. When i see ond i just kill it to get some peace and quiet.

PS4 old man here...I have never bought a thing from or otherwise traded with any other player.  Yeah...no explosive weapons for me, though I‚Äôve found a few two-shot weapons.  But I‚Äôve enjoyed exploring on my own pace.  
---
I‚Äôm now level 77 and ready to finally enter a silo to try and launch my first nuke.  It‚Äôs been fun and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve gotten my old-ass this far on my own. Might need a bit of help. I can‚Äôt aim to save my ass.  
---
I hope your next adventure is just a rewarding.   
---
They need to just make some areas level dependent...
---
Thanks that's a useful tip. I assume it's also because I'm only level 18 and will be able to produce and farm more at higher levels making less of an issue 
---
We are the good ones, if u are ok with sparing some psycho, so do you have any psycho?
---
See I agree with you but at the same time my TSE guns were legit and I even gave a couple to friends who just couldn't do pvp. Alot of greifers are gone now and it's only used in real pvp, I honestly just wish they nerfed the whole "I can stand in one place and tank 4 2shot rockets with quad barrel to the face and a sneak crit 2k damage gauss to the head shortly after." you could literally have six people throw a variety of grenades, use a mirv Fatman at point blank range, and unload an entire clip of Tse fifty cal at the same time and they don't flinch. Nerf that please. Alot of builds can take on people using Tse guns even with normal legendary weapons, I mean people can run around naked. I can survive maybe a few rounds clipping me with a shotgun if I'm in full PA and nerd rage with the right chems. 
---
Define hurt here, because a .50cal will hurt you to death in a fine red mist, a .308 will just hurt you, perhaps to death but no mist.
---
Just saying that getting hit by a .50cal is pretty much certain death, even if it hits you in a limb itll kill you up from fragmentation or massive blood loss.
---
Yes please, GRAY OUT recipes we already know in Vendor Windows, Trade Windows, and Dropped Bags :)
---
You obvs haven‚Äôt hit the queen up yet 
---
We say something is dumb, when we dont understand it.
---
I think it could be an issue with some of the items being split between stash and inventory. Though I could be wrong. Like say you have 6 screws in your inventory and 10 in the stash. Maybe it has a problem because they are split between the two and not all in one place. I have experienced this before and taking the springs into my inventory from stash fixed it.
---
Oh wow. That's crazy, I'm happy that's patched then. I've seen the base videos under the map and I kinda feel like it's not hurting anyone in any way serious unless they can still damage players from underground. Then it's bs. 
---
The patch spawn reduction for mobs seems to have affected these kinds of spawns as well.  The civil war reenactor that sometimes showed up near the overseer‚Äôs camp has been absent lately, and often now there is no spawn of any kind there.  Pre-patch usually something was in that spot.
---
Same with the Charleston station spot which sometimes has the rare vendor.  Used to see something there almost every time, now empty much more often.
---
:(
---
Thanks man I'll be sure to mess them up 
---
hmmm so you want the gun to hurt the user and kill the target, I like your style.
---
Oh, buthurted downvotes, I feel you man.
---
If the game is so bad then why revisit the subreddit of such game and write an emotional essay post on such game?
---
TBH, I one shot most things with the 2 shot gauss, even without rifle perks.  I'm a stealther, so between sneak attack and a full charged shot head shot, I get the job done with one shot even on most legendaries.  The difference: I actually have to do something to set up the one shot, instead of derping with a 2se.  That makes it more fun for me.
---
Well I guess I cannot PM pics
---
You bash it, others defend it, people are allowed to do what they want.
---
You're saying this game isn't for you. Who are we to try and change that?
---
No, and if I did I wouldn‚Äôt trust you üòÇ
---
The sorry ppl.
---
Their justifications are rediculous and its nice to see a dev calling their bluff.
---
Because in 76, you get to strap explosives to bait, as opposed to posting it online
---
Bla bla bla... 
---
STILL not fixed.. wasting my time lol. Didn't know this was a thing -_- ugh 
---
There is no build variety.
---
Laser weapons suck, plasma‚Äôs suck, the other vanilla stuff is meh.
---
They‚Äôll nerf melee eventually.. end game is non existent. Bethesda fucked up and they will pay for it in the long run and they know it given their desperate attempt for cash from the atomic shop. Leave the dumb fucks behind to cry for nerfs at whatever killed them last. 
---
If the AI is too taxing on the server.....
---
Allow us to LEVEL UP our turrets with more resources.  Like a level 20 costs 20 of some resource, but a level 70 costs 70 of some resource.  Heck I don't care if it's rare stuff like Ballistic Fiber.  I'd like my turrets to be more than "mole rat and dog killers".  I'd like it to actually deter people from attacking my camp :)
---
You can use robot expert to hack her and make her act as a follower.
---
They wont add this till they have patched out the duping exploits, being able to reconnect to your last server would make duping even easier since you could then do it on your own.
---
They helped me find out that they do not give a fuck about black market sellers, after i reported one.
---
I gotta say some people are secretly enjoying this game. I am one of them but I am not defending it because I believe everyone has their own opinions. 
---
Like I said my experiences with this were pre patch, I go to new gad every time I play now and today I had the game crash on me when I started looking around the area because Noone was in the boxes. Could be coincidence, could be they saw me nearby on the map and rushed the server crash. I just don't want to send you on a wild goose chase, it doesn't hurt to look though. 
---
Wasn't there a post a few weeks ago that proved that the quantity of players didn't affect the Queen's Stats?
---
Rather, it was the level of the first player to spawn her that did. If it's a player under Level 50 you get the easy Queen, but if they're over 50 you get the crazy stat Queen.
---
I've never messed with bloodied but keep in mind you can still wear a hazmat suit as it has 0 dmg resist I belive
---
None of them have a legitimate reason to lock them. Just bitter ass stingy people that don't need more than 3-4 bottles an hour even with speed demon... That's why they downvoted but didn't comment and guaranteed they'd get their shit trashed and message me like a few others have crying about their base. #orbitalstrike

yes but why defend it as OP asked? got any solid reasons?

I think you're mistaken, that is Squidward Tortillini.

This and Power Armor naming.

what do the secret people to do get enjoyment out of it?
---
Well my main is 190 for this sole purpose of convenient respec.
---
I have conserved around 120 points and am waiting for patches to stabilize.
---
Recently spent several points to pump my E to 3 in order to accommodate buffed version of Fireproof.
---
What i hate most is that from almost 40 card packs i got only couple useful cards. Never seen damage bonus card from a pack.
---
But garbage like lead belly? I have all color and levels.
---
I wonder why Beth didn‚Äôt come up with idea of selling perk packs to people, pretty much like hearthstone does, cause i hate to spend every point after level 50 to get a card.
---
probably disappointment. I'll admit, i was overhyped for this game so even though I enjoy it I was also disappointed 
---
97% because I just enjoy it, period. 3% because I get to check the reddit and watch man-child posts of people trying to crap on the game unsuccessfully.
---
That's going to confuse and piss off the 99% of people who are not us, and don't have the same extremely basic bullet knowledge that we do. "But is says 50, why can't I use it? Fuck this game, -50% metacritic score. Obviously bugged".
---
I think maybe a more idiot-proof caliber would be like a 400 blackout or something. It'd make sense with the size of the current rifle model, and wouldn't confuse the shit out of the general public playing this game. 400&gt;308. Simple enough. I guarantee the interns they hired to port over fallout 4's weapons were like "huh, 50 is a smaller number than 308. I guess I will make it less damage". 
---
Step 1 - Don't plant  your base on a fissure site....lol
---
Step 2 - Yes they should allow us to UPGRADE our turrets, so they are more than "mole rat and dog killers".
---
Step 3 - Profit? :)
---
If there was I missed it 
---
It was even in fallout 4
---
I did talk to you about your methods in your topic. It sounds dickish but i can understand your reaction a lot better myself if this really hits.   
---
I do not know if you have a TSE yourself and how you got it. But heck. I played for nearly 2 months now and did only get a explosive one so far. Not a TSE.   
---
The amount of luck you have to have that moment and the joy getting it. Now? It is all destroyed, just because some couldn't research properly what really made it so overpowered.   
---
Take out the stacking bobbleheads. And i think everything would be fine again. There will still be some people bitching about TSE weapons being strong, but you ALWAYS have this issue with the strongest stuff in a game. And if we always now start nerfing the strongest weapons and builds.. we soon run around with nerfdarts. (Not that we wouldn't have them already with most normal weapons.)  
---
Today it is TSE. Tomorrow it is melee. Soon it is the Cryolator. Then it is the Gauss Rifle... People won't stop demanding nerfs everywhere until the game is even more broken as from the start. And then everyone cries around again that Fallout 76 is the worst game ever.
---
I'm also saying that the game is objectively atrocious and I don't understand why people would try and defend a game that does not work.
---
Bunch of losers defend this game, honestly.
---
Because I enjoy it and I have fun playing it. Dont need any other reasons.
---
I stopped reading after the first paragraph. You are going to get alot of downvotes and just delete this post so why post it? It happens every time. People are allowed to enjoy it. You either haven't played it and are on the hate train, played it and just said yknow what I don't like it, play it and just talk a bunch about how it's terrible but still play it, or you play it and actually enjoy it because you find it more enjoyable than queuing up for tdm or grinding out stuff on another game or something. Idk. 
---
Someone calculate how much Fusion Cells you'd need to oneshot the SBQ with the Assaultron Head pls thx
---
Fair enough
---
Wrong subreddit 
---
Considering the Vickers looked smaller and weighed over 23lbs irl without ammo or another 20lbs of Water I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre getting off real light with that one too.
---
I think this is due to different rate of fire. Gatling is very, very slow. It absolutely does not shoot the advertised 400 rate (to LMG's 295 RoF), even with Martial Artist perk, which makes it shoot faster. Typically rate of fire affects the damage guns do. Which is why automatic receiver on the same gun, using the same ammo, still does less damage than semi-auto receiver. I guess the tradeoff there is higher cripple/stagger chance from corresponding perks (Tormentor, for example). 
---
That's why Hunting Rifle, with .308 vs .50, made sense. Rifle is the same, same RoF. With Gatling vs LMG, it's different guns, different RoF, so difference in damage can't just be attributed to ammo costs. I have a feeling 5mm ammo was balanced to Minigun. Cheaper to make than .50 because Minigun wastes more, and because of its extremely high RoF it would burn more of it, at lower damage per shot, and be punished by DR more brutally.
---
I think it still sort of makes sense*. The asterisk is because the whole thing is a mess, but it has some kind of insane consistency to it. The whole thing needs a rebalance though, start to finish, top to bottom. 
---
What I really would like to see is actual DPS on each gun. Damage per shot is fine and dandy, but RoF isn't displayed accurately. There's no way Hunting Rifle is a 3 (3 shots per minute?) and Gatling is 400. The difference between the two, even factoring reload time, isn't that big. 
---
ByeBye
---
It doesn't look the same but I'm not going to watch it because I don't want to spoil anything for myself, if I'm right this one has all the dlc stuff. Someone at work mentioned it. 
---
That's actually quite a nifty come-back. i like it. But seriously, the game is a shit-show. Stating the obvious is not bait, it's just accurate.
---
I have a camp in the swamps so I can say in a Shrek like voice: ‚Äûget out of my swamps!‚Äú
---
Actualy i heard of this weeeeks ago. Too much ppls spam here ther opinions, rage, suggestions, how to fix game(yeah bethesda dont know) etc.
---
You just dont find it in this spamed reddit. I belive in few weeks someone will like omfg sometimes scorchbeast queen have radioactive aura and melee guys gets 30rads/sec outside of nuke zone near here. I did 2posts about it, but check most upvoted posts. Only fucking sugestions that will never happen.
---
Because people think that the more players that are around the stronger the Queen is.
---
i'm sure you think that shoving a pine-cone up your own ass would be enjoyable too then.
---
Except it actually does.
---
Every player engaging the queen bumps her stats up. With a bunch of levels tagging her and being unable to deal significant damage, you get a harder if not impossible to kill queen.
---
Bethesda on people exploiting them "but it doesn‚Äôt mean taking advantage of them is acceptable."
---
Me and tons of peoples money getting exploided/stolen by Bethesda "sending out a product is not the same as sending out a finished product."
---
In the future all Bethesda games will be bought used and supporting other peoples wallet and not Bethesda.
---
You're talking about spamming the server. "Come buy my stuff." "Come have water." "Lets all role play."
---
I don't want that. There are proximity audio chats and that's enough. If I'm clearing a silo or working on mayor for a day, I guarantee you I do not care about whatever you're doing.
---
If you want to get a message out to as many people as possible, use Reddit or discord.
---
I'm having fun, that's all that matters.
---
It cost me $53 canadian which isn't much for me. My gf are going to a movie tomorrow that will cost the same.
---
We spent $100 at costco today and another $50 getting groceries.
---
Ultimately its one of the better $53 I've spent on a leisure activity. A leisure activity i won't get bent out of shape about because ppl on the internet are still upset about.
---
There should be a sub just for fo76 C.A.M.P.S y‚Äôall have some good ones 
---
Damn, it seems my comment hit a sensible spot. I‚Äôm sorry for hurting your feelings, buddy.
---
I watched 20 year sheriff who was ex military poke some serious fun at the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a magazine not clip‚Äù folk so I don‚Äôt sweat anyone using this term one iota
---
If you're having trouble getting X01 Calibrated Shocks and Jetpacks.....
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  People sell them for caps all the time.  They generally go for 3k to 5k depending on the trader.  Sometimes they can go lower than that.
---
If mine cant be placed i go to it and see who is in it. If its less nice than mine than it gets destroyed if it is nicer it stays. 
---
You must be new. The Scorchbeast Queen's health get multiplied by te number of people present making the Queen unkilable if you don't all contribute equally to the damage. So far people with TSE weapon done enough damage to compensate for the low level noobs that just showed up to get a piece of the pie with weapons that don't even tickle her. Even so you had moments when you barelly got to kill her in time before the time runs out. Or fail because everyone run out of ammo/durability. Now with the TSE nerf it will be impossible to kill the queen as you can't control the number of low level noobs that just decide to come to your nuke with trash weapons.
---
*keep TSE and fix pvp 
---
wow really? 
---
i have no intention of deleting this post. The game is a complete joke. About the only decent thing i can say about it is that some of the music is nice and there was some sort of effort put into appalchia itself. Everything else is just a shit-storm
---
I never said that people couldn't enjoy it. I asked why people are defending it. I made this distinction at the end of my comment. Learn to read. With that, now I'm getting something to eat.
---
I have a nice camp with nice things, and some more nice things that I would like to get. I have nice weapons and armor, and I have a nice world to explore and sometimes I fight some super mutants and sometimes someone comes near my camp and I will give them something, a weapon or something nice. Let them take whatever from my camp if they need water or food or want to take something from the junk extractor I don't mind. Yeah. I have a lot of things still to do and I'm not in any rush to do them. The biggest problem is if the game crashes. I hope they are really focused on fixing that and it's not some needle in a haystack.
---
Maybe something like you have to sprint down the slope/course in a set amount of time, meanwhile: spawns
---
I think they did care they just didn't admit it for... "legal" reasons maybe. I've heard that they check the subs involving the game for exploiters and stuff. Could be wrong because it was just work talk. 
---
It's new to me. I wonder if it's to show/test how all the generic building assets fit together.
---
&gt; I'm not going to watch it because I don't want to spoil anything for myself
---
[You know you want to](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xvDf9Kyp_DI/VXq0pwy4O8I/AAAAAAAAL3M/YmPcc2wzgUo/s640/shia-labeouf-just-do-it-green-background.gif)
---
Oddly enough you're not the first person I've heard say they are so far north on a ledge.
---
I assume you're by the ammo depot, arguably the only workshop worth capturing?
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
Honestly it's better to get plans for swords (and other weapons) because you can then craft high level versions of it. Those swords are likely level 15. I actually have the plans now. Funny enough the level 45 bladed ski sword is better than the level 50 serrated Chinese offers sword. 
---
There are Fallout fans out there that have been waiting for a FO multiplayer for years and now that time has come. Some people love to spend hours and hours in the wasteland looting, crafting, killing and building. Okay we get it the game was buggy and it still is and I won‚Äôt deny that but it‚Äôs the closest to get to play with your friends and have hours of fun. If you‚Äôre looking to be lone wanderer and level up yeah it‚Äôs kinda hard and if you wanna do that then go play FO4. Hell i spent over 100hours on this game and I am not even complaining about it. Yeah we get it the servers down most of the time and crashes but let‚Äôs face it. Bethesda is trying. (Still not defending) If you like this game, good. If it‚Äôs not your cup of tea then move along. It may be a shit game to you but it may be an AAA game for others. 
---
Which is uh never cause they don‚Äôt seem to respond to anything :(
---
It does have problems, I am not blind to that. Could Bethesda have waited instead of pushing for a holiday release? Absolutely.
---
At it's core though, bugs aside, I very much enjoyed the exploration and the world of the game. It's one of Bethesda's strengths, and it really shows in 76. 
---
I was totally willing to cut them some slack, as this was the first multiplayer game they have put out. It worked well enough for me, and they're only making it better IMO.
---
At the end of the day,  I don't blame the devs for the bad release, I think it falls more to the people in charge of the company. The game has to go a long way, but I don't think it was as bad as everyone made it out to be.
---
How did you get the clean shelf at 54 seconds? And the fancy white legged table at 55 seconds?
---
In the mean time use fireproof 3. Their attacks are explosive
---
I agree that ammo is a problem but claim a workshop with lead and frequent Scorched areas and ammo isn‚Äôt a massive problem 
---
I have maxed out barter and charisma sitting around 16-18 
---
But I can‚Äôt win against ANY vendor - it‚Äôs annoying 
---
Alright thanks 
---
I believe there is nothing they can do about that.
---
You GAVE them your money willingly, no one stole from you.  Get over yourself.
---
Most ppl waste their time asking them for stuff they can't fix.
---
I can only assume you don‚Äôt play with friends all that often.  We consider it an RNGsus miracle if we can get 3/4 of our teams CAMPs to spawn in the same server let alone when we‚Äôre rolling 2 teams on the SBQ.
---
Have you tried going to the enclave and using deco shower
---
Well that escalated quickly O_o lol
---
Incredible! 
---
Platform?
---
My three person team just server disconnected and we are at the main menu with a "Waiting..." option instead of play. We're on Xbox.
---
That‚Äôs why I suggested just not be able to simply type in a box and send a message to everyone. 
---
Spamming could be stopped easily. Like I said, there could be a small quest, or even spending a certain amount of caps, even adding a cooldown period between messages. The message could pop up on a radio station perhaps,and you can listen to it if you want. This would also allow it to feel more real and immersive.
---
And as you suggested Reddit and discord are useful tools, but they are not immersive. Often trying to join someone‚Äôs world it could be full. Also constantly server hoping as a salesman could also be annoying. 
---
There's a terminal in the enclave bunker that you can use. It'll mark one on your map.
---
Why do you care? Jesus. If they ban everyone the game will die
---
Lmao I can see that happening with interns. But yeah adding 400 would definitely make improvements, might as well add .338 for shits and giggles
---
Roam the wasteland and listen for the vertibirds. 
---
I‚Äôve had decent luck hanging around Whitesprings and getting the 3 vertibird/ 1 cargobot patrol.  But that has its obvious drawbacks of being nuked at any given moment. 
---
ok i get it, but you are defending it pretty hard. And its probably the only game besides NMS that I can think of that was a dumpster fire masquerading as a AAA title on release. NMS got better; this game has released zero new content and the patches rarely fix any bugs.
---
Welcome to my world have a ps4  pro running on fiber internet but people like to blame me and say it was my fault somehow lol
---
Try giving it a minute to fully load all the textures adn what not before opening your pipboy, entering/exiting PA, and I wouldnt move if you can help it. Was happening to me yesterday and just waiting a minute before really doing anything worked for me. It also seems to be dependent on the server as well. Some were better than others. Hope you get it working.
---
Why would we bother? You don't seem interested in even doing more than "casually scrolling" and you've clearly established a bias against the game as a low information person. It would just be a waste of time. 
---
The short version is that there's stuff you can defend &amp; stuff you just can't objectively. There's stuff that has nothing to do with the game that's coloured opinion on it and there's a bunch of stuff that use to be shit that have been fixed. 
---
I view you the same way I view a blind apologist fanboy - morons. 
---
If you want a genuine answer to your question, be more open minded.
---
Really?  I‚Äôve not seen that.  Must go find now.  
---
I hope so. something resembling 'thanks for bringing this to our attention' in their reply would go a long way, but no.
---
Okay. Like I said I didn't read past the first part where you called it "garbage and runs like a homeless guy on Crack" after you said that the rest really didn't matter, you asked why people defend something that you obviously just bash on. We can't enjoy it in your eyes because it runs like shit apparently (I personally haven't had this experience) that is obviously how you feel and I don't understand why you had to make a long winded post just to get people riled up. I gave my opinion on why people defend it and you focused on the first thing I said which makes my experience and yours about the same. The music isn't bad. I personally defend it because it plays like any other shooter on the market, the enemies are not always the same cookie cutter bs, I always find something new when I play, and yeah the music is definetly not bad (except that one song where the chick sings about a fuck it bucket or some shit WHYYYY) 
---
In one week they will be lvl 200 again. I don‚Äôt see the point here.
---
Devoted people will outlevel less devoted, you just propose the unjust grind for those with less time on their hands.  
---
This is me and my experience almost to the letter.
---
I agree there. Acknowledgement is nice. 
---
Lol yes profit.
---
To be fair, it was a fairly considerable distance.
---
I care because it is wrong. If I owned this game I would be pissed if I saw my images being used. And I guess your upset because you yourself is guilty yes?
---
I didnt downvote you. 
---
My man rolled out of the Vault and found Mothman. Seeing a few shrines here and there but ultimately becoming a changed man when entering a cave system only to find proof. Real proof. Giant stone heads in the ground, uncovered by work and time. A strange living tentacle monster that sways in a shrine to the Father of Light. Mothman observes from above. Protects from above. Coming to bear gifts. Striking down the sinners. He will guide you to the Light or He will remove you from it's glory.
---
My guy is an acolyte of Mothman. Ritual attire and a massive gallery of photos at every shrine I find.
---
Yeah, in theory the Responders quest that makes you immune to the scorch plague is  what prevents us from becoming scorched in a SB attack
---
You are very persuasive. (we know it's you Shia) 
---
tl;dr
---
I hate the game and everyone should hate it with me.
---
For a complete product. Buying a car that runs half of the times and parts falling off is also not a complete product.
---
It is easy to cheat people even though you give them money for a product willingly. I dont believe you were born yesterday so no further explanation needed. But you are welcome to disagree.
---
So why are you still playing the game if it's a dumpster fire? You literally posted 20 min looking to trade items. 
---
Nice! How do I find the traveling super mutant? I'd like to get the jet pack plans. 
---
Big Chungus in disguise
---
Do people defend it? 
---
Most of what I see are folks defending "themselves" by saying they enjoy it then get bashed by some random and then have to explain to the random as to why they enjoy a game only to be called Bethesda apologists or "part of the problem".
---
Do folks even bother to comprehend the words they read when queing for a "why not admit it's bad and say you enjoy it" response?. Literally almost everyone does.
---
I love this game but good god there is no way to defend it. But I brought it for $20 NZD
---
Which I‚Äôm pretty sure is why I don‚Äôt care that it has its issues.
---
November14&gt;December14 = 1 month.  December 14&gt;January 14 = 1 month.  That's 2 months.  Nice try though.

It's against EBay's own rules, or at least it used to be. Here's a quote from their rulebook:
---
&gt;Your listing clearly states that you legally own the content (sometimes called intellectual property) or are authorized to sell it by the owner, the owner's authorized agent, or the law.
---
You have to own the IP to be able to sell it. And since seller doesn't on Fallout IP, they cannot sell it. If Bethesda reported it, I really don't think EBay would hang on to a vendor like that.
---
Meh, I have fun punching robots and exploring stuff
---
I logged into a "Server is shutting down for maintenance" popup over an infinite load screen.
---
Then I submitted a feedback ticket about and the page hung while submitting.
---
Tried logging again, camp cannot be placed, and crash to desktop.
---
I think they're having server problems tonight.
---
It‚Äôs just shameful balance
---
i feel ya there! My team has tried a couple places and this weekend I‚Äôm deff gonna do more areas
---
I've met him a few times but not recently. I've personally never seen jet pack plans for anything other than X-01 armor, which you get from the Enclave bunker. I rarely use my jetpack though. Hoping they add one for without power armor. 
---
Yeah I'll take garbage from a bag but I have my dignity 
---
Is it hard to defend workshops when you first claim it?  I haven't tried yet because I figured I'd die solo
---
Take over workshops and do events . Good for xp an plans .. 
---
No, you gave them your money for the product they offered.  Your bad for not assuming it would be riddled with bugs like every other Bethesda launch or bother to watch or play the demo.
---
As long as the player limit is 24 people per server player hubs and even vending is pretty much pointless. Player vending might work if you can set it up and have the shop persist after you log out but I don't know about you I'm not going to leave this game running for hours on the off chance someone actually comes and checks out my shop. On top of all that we don't even have text chat so a player hub is even more dead in the water.
---
And grenade launcher. Lol.

Well done gave u a gold reward for that reply üëçüëçüëçüëç

i based my expectations on other AAA games-as-a-service titles with daily/weekly quests. I honestly doubt there is any new content coming besides the new vaults being short Events and PVP crap. Wouldnt be surprised if teh vaults never open like that fucking Quarian Ark

Doesn't 50 cal have better armor penetration? If you put a refined 50 cal receiver its only a few points shy of the hardened receiver.
---
Weapon system in New Vegas was closest to reality
---
Right on perfect much appreciated 
---
Thank you! :)
---
My precioussssss... 
---
If your weapons does 100 balistic dmg + 100 explosive dmg + another 100 explosive from demolition perk that is 300 dmg. After the nerf it will be 100 + 20 + 20 = 140 dmg. It might not be worth keeping demolition pwrk and go back to gunsmith for extra durability. And with just 20% extra dmg you mighg hust trow the weapon in the trash and use a regular non legendary weapon because you won't even feel the difference. 80% nerf was too extreme.
---
just pack up and replace your camp.  cost 40 caps iirc and rebuilds the whole thing.  
---
The ammo spent destroying a camp is more work to replace than the caps to replace it.
---
Crazy, just logged into whitesprings and its smooth as butter.
---
Doing my vendor sweep right now.

Find a ‚Äúplinker gun‚Äù

A low end weapon to wipe out low level mobs in a single shot conserving your good ammo for later.  Make sure it‚Äôs a common ammo type like .38.  The .38 receiver on Combat Rifle was a good early pick for me.
---
Pick up lots of metal, gunpowder and lead when looting. 
---
Take Ammo Smith in Agility to make nearly twice the amount of ammo when crafting and also take Super Duper in Luck to gain a chance to double the amount of anything you craft.
---
Expecting a polished release of a game not a broken mess. Everyone who's mad about that has  right to feel ripped off
---
You swap you *6-12 cards at a time? Wow.* Make a build you're happy with and stick to it. That's the whole point. 
---
I guess my issue exists due to duping and the economy. With TSE being so cheap, its easy to save up enough to buy one at 50. The perk cards dont make much of a difference as you can easily have good set ups by 40-50 with not much effort and minimal planning. The experience is sure a factor, but I dont know if that should count into caps lost in pvp. Someone could be lvl 200 and pvped twice in their playtime, while someone could be 50 and pvped all the way through every chance they got. I think a cap on caps lost at max level for perks makes sense and harms no one, but i respect your opinion. 
---
I read on here that that can happen if she is targeting a player and they DC. no clue if its true. still that sucks.
---
There's the door. I think you are about five more downvotes from reaching it. 
---
No. I traded my money with them for what was meant to be a working, finished product. Would you be happy if the toaster you bought didn't actually toast bread?
---
Taking money on a false pretext is fraud, a form of stealing.
---
I disagree with duping, especially the systems which required you to purposefully crash out but there have also been benign methods of duping which have been impossible to tell from actual game play, example the bulk acid thing where you essentially traded 2 plastic for 5 acid.
---
Releasing a product in such a state and then expecting players to know which event is an exploit and which is a game mechanic and then banning those who make the wrong choice is poor planning on Bethesda's part. Especially as players ALWAYS push their boundaries yet the developer leaves in bugs and weaknesses from the beta to be exploited.
---
Build a better product before fraudulently taking my money and banning me for your poor programming. 
---
Where is the enclave by? I can't find it and have gone over my map 5 times 
---
**Spoiler**
---
BoS created the Sonic emitter that forces the scorchbeast to land. It's literally a small satellite tower with dish in the event It's a Trap. 
---
Abbie discussed this throughout the entirety of the Free States sequences. She even directs players towards the BoS to find the plans. 
---
Still can't build it and no mention of plans or even scribes keeping their research. 
---
Obviously this tech is the most important thing in game when considering a queen fight, but nah, let's not try to recreate it. 
---
Does serendipity any good for this build? Seems better than Bloody Mess as it gives 45% avoid damage while below 30% health.
---
I understand the explosive effect part but, the two shot effect does not need to be nerfed that hurts TS heavy guns badly. 25% of 18 is only like 3 that's such a small amount. Right now my TS minigun is 40 with some perks. It's only going to be like 23 -24. Heavy guns already suffer from the needing damn power armor to be effective. &gt;.&gt;
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm just
---
Trying to keep interest in the game. 
---
It's in a sad state .. yes, it's buggy as hell .. yes .. it has flaws because directions were partially taken .. yes .. but it's still a game with activities and offers a semi fps shoot em up with an mmo collect em quality with being able to build a base. Let's be honest BGS has been listening and they have made changes thus far based on said feedback so there is still hope a survival game will become what people want., or changed into what the majority wants. Until then login play for a couple mins have some fun and log out, it's a game.

The irony is I still see what you're saying about this dumpster fire but it still offers me entertainment. Yes they tried some very questionable business practices(lying about sales/selling things on atom shop way over value) and they have made some decisions that don't actually meet an acceptable level of their player base ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ iunno it's a survival game that has the survival part finally done right, is the balance off .. yeah absolutely, are there bugs, yep check does the design team have no idea where to go in direction in relation to what a majority of their player base want, oh absolutely .. but .. it's still fun for a few hours here and there, plus we got females.

West tek is the best spot

Is your core depleted?

Scrap it! Scrap it all and start over!

Ok but if your character is your connection to the game 
---
What CAN they fix?
---
Hidden triggers it.
---
Like a pimp suit?
---
This and the assaultron head beam when you're long range. That's some serious bs. 
---
That man child comment real hit a sore spot on him lol.
---
I guess he didn't get into voice work after getting trapped in a room forever.

1) Bethesda is known for releasing buggy messes and announced that this game would definitely be one since they're trying to convert a single-player engine that already has bugs into a multiplayer engine
---
2) You could have either played the beta or watch streams of people playing the beta.  The ones I watched, people were not happy.  Many bugs were prevalent, and the textures were also a common point of concern from streamers.
---
Most of the time I would agree that it would be unacceptable, but Bethesda flat out told and showed you there would be problems with this game.  No excuses at that point.
---
I thought they moved on to the paper bag dupe method now, where you don't even have to craft anything.
---
Capping all the workshops and then doing the defend events all day will be sure to boost your level significantly, especially in a group woth buffs to exp active.
---
Except you claim to have refunded the game months ago.
---
Either you‚Äôre full of shit or you‚Äôre dumb enough to refund the game and rebuy it later at the same price. I‚Äôd go with the latter.
---
There aren't enough players per server to ever have a place like that in the current game that is used, that plus no text chat. Think about it, if the game really needed a player hub there are plenty of places already that would be used, there is nothing stopping people from congregating as it is now but they don't. 
---
The only way I could see it work is if it was instanced like you said elsewhere and it was it's own separate server so it is linked to all of the main map servers that way the game could have you join a hub that actually has players in it. I have big doubts Bethesda is capable of doing something like that though.
---
Dick Shales sounds infectious
---
I see tips for damage mitigation but that‚Äôs not really the issue is it? 
---
I mean it‚Äôs the onslaught of audio and visual effects that‚Äôs the real problem.  Even if you set aside the fact that having 3 of these bats around dam near guarantees a server disconnect, you can‚Äôt see a mother loving thing so you have no clue wtf is going on.  
---
Haven‚Äôt found one yet 
---
Yup. It's hard to shoot them when they're screaming at you too. I use a heavy weapons like Gatling gun to pew pew pew pew pew them in the wherever I can hit them as they flail around in the 3 dimensions. But soon as those screams come at me I can't see what I'm shooting. Gotta run around and jump and Sprint and try to get underneath them so they fly past me. They seem to only scream half as much as they fly away from you so it gives time to reset and aim and I tend to miss a lot with the Gatling gun anyway lol. 
---
Grenadier doubles the explosion radius. You're thinking of the other ones.
---
Sweet place! Wanted to do something like that near Cranberry Bog!
---
I've been farming Harper's for the VTU Jumpsuit and turned around to see where you house would be! Nice spot!
---
More joker esq
---
Also when you just setup a couple workshops then boom disconnect. 
---
1. Bethesda is known for releasing buggy messes and announced that this game would definitely be one since they're trying to convert a single-player engine that already has bugs into a multiplayer engine
---
2. You could have either played the beta or watch streams of people playing the beta.  The ones I watched, people were not happy.  Many bugs were prevalent, and the textures were also a common point of concern from streamers.
---
Yes but you know damn well this is over the top level. If they KNEW it was going to be THIS bad they should've pushed release. 
---
I have been playing since Beta, I played most the Beta I could and started on release day with everyone else.
---
I'm not so mad as others because I was gifted the game but this level of mess is inexcusable for an 80-100 dollar game. They should have ironed it out more before taking everyone's money
---
LMAO triggered 
---
I am on PC and I find the keybind a bit of a pain. 
---
Press E to activate or pick things up but if you press it a faction of a sec too long it ejects you from the PA suit. 
---
I get ejected at odd times but mostly when I am harvesting lots of stuff or looting.
---
They decide to nerf TSE across the board instead of fixing real issues. That combo is suppose to be OP. Its called endgame for a reason lol.
---
I honestly had no idea this was the new method, I try not to watch videos on it but that's not surprising. I've only heard the new method after patch straight crashes the server for everyone. I wasnt sure how it was performed. 
---
I've had this happen several times. I find that if I leave the game and come back it is done. It is frustrating to have to exit, but it is better than using up my stimpacks, etc.
---
I remember them saying that the notification comes up your spot is occupied and you can change servers or place your camp elsewhere for free. 
---
It was, spread to speakers and holotapes all over Appalachia
---
That happens sometimes. She always came back for me. Capt the one or two times I've seen a tram fail.and have her legit fly off 
---
It's the sheer weight of being a slightly more complicated, customized item for the servers to bear.
---
A 50 cal pistol, bassically a hand cannon. Only real life pistols of that caliber are some desert eagles and the .500 magnum. 
---
A 50 cal pistol, basically a hand cannon. Only real life pistols of that caliber are some desert eagles and the .500 magnum. 
---
Yeah, this happens occasionally to me (on PS4 also).  Like he^ said - just don't do anything until all the textures load.  
---
.50 round should be expensive, heavy and require gunsmith 5 to craft. M2 .50 MG should weight 100 pounds as real one and overheat when long burst (I know it‚Äôs too complicated to implement with the current engine) . There are different ways to balance this MG, but Bethesda choose easiest and shameful one
---
Like I said before Bethesda is trying. Give them a break. The game was buggy when it was released and now they are slowly patching it. Put yourself in their shoes. If you think the team are sitting behind their desk and not not doing their jobs that‚Äôs where you aren‚Äôt paying much attention. I have been playing pretty much all night checking their twitter updates on patches and fixing it and these guys are on it like pretty much every week trying to solve issues. Dude it‚Äôs not easy as it sounds. I‚Äôm trying to be the optimistic one here and if people are still acting like a cry baby that these game is trash so be it and go play Fortnite or something. 
---
Indeed. I bought a 2shot Single Action and it felt right.
---
Without the extra 100%dmg, it was flat worse than every other revolver.
---
Lower damage, longer reload speed by a factor of 4, no advantage in AP use, only a single mod option ( and Ivory Grip doesn't even look ivory.... i mean.... you had one job...). Like... why even have it? Give it a reason... make its refire time instantaneous and its AP cost half of other revolver, then suddenly it has a multi-target burst weapon, along side the single-target burst damage of BPP. It needs a relevant identity, i don't care what, just something other than "the worst revolver".
---
She remembered she still had something in her ultracite oven 
---
The loophole is they are selling their time.
---
Oh. I was totally getting on board with the idea of a wasteland stereotypical 80s movie pimp character. You crushed my dreams. But I know what I wanna do now. Time to make an unarmed suit wearing build.
---
It's crazy how fragile they are. I didn't use my tse all that much but it was funny to watch them instantly explode. Even with a two shot they're laughably weak 
---
Aw darn. Thanks for the reply
---
My toon looks like nurse outfit joker at the moment, but I want a purple suit
---
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.  The fact is they didn't, and they informed the public of the state of the game and people chose to buy it anyway regardless.
---
You have to use a cane
---
Yeah the title says it all. 
---
Stealing money is wrong. Writing fake cheques is wrong.
---
Picking up money dropped in the street is not. 
---
Can‚Äôt you make new ones at the fabricator 
---
Something must be going on with the trophies because I got the 10k caps one even though I haven't held 10k caps at all.
---
Your arguments are horribly flawed. I don‚Äôt even like the game at all but I can see that I didn‚Äôt get ripped off.
---
Anti-materiel sniper rifle with the damage comparable with Gauss rifle
---
2019-2018 = 1... One year guys, it took them ONE YEAR!!!!!!!!1!!1!!1!!!
---
I've been griefed like that before with artillery shells. You can repair all your stuff and it's expensive as hell or drop your camp again for 40 caps and just replot your blueprints. Saves so much time and resources. 
---
They were researching how to get internet on more than one computer.
---
They just released an update, so I‚Äôd wait a while before the next one. 
---
Or at least I‚Äôm assuming this based on their lack of communication to their users. 
---
&gt;part of the post came from what I‚Äôve heard around the community
---
Wow. Such disappointment. When one person lies bevause they're an idiot and others make more posts based on that lie/misinformation. Welcome to r/fallout and r/fo76
---
Agree. When I was level 30, three 100+ individuals hunted me down then took my shop. 
---
I we killed each other back and forth, until it ended up costing me 200 caps. Eventually I returned to my base only to have them hunt me down again until I finally left the server. That encounter cost me almost half my caps, and for them it was trivial. 
---
The main aggressor had a demonic clean mask and would go invisible until he could hit me with a legendary Miner gauntlet. Points for creativity. 
---
I had a fusion genny, I think that definitely instigated some of it. But with bounties, there is no timer signalling you are a bully (re GTA bad sport lobbies). It's easy to remove the trace of you being a dick
---
Its basically billing support
---
If he didn't have a penis I wouldn't have a way to cheat in the first place!!
---
3 ranks in Fireproof and Dense armor mod give you complete invulnerability to TSE weapons.
---
You clearly have perks equipped that reduce your carry weight. Those perks don't apply to items in the stash box. 
---
Nope. Pimp slap. The cane is just for my pimp walk.
---
Many people do not use theirs. What system are you on and someone will possibly give/trade them to you.
---
Looks like a yellow adult diaper.
---
Time to post this again... https://imgur.com/gallery/edvItzL
---
They often get around this by stating the are not selling the item, just the time they spent getting the item.
---
Or they sell a Pen but if you "Buy Now" as a bonus they will gift you a 5 star Gauss rifle....wow what a deal.  Now it is a case of you are buying a pen not the gauss so it's legal.
---
It semantics but eBay in the past has turned a blind eye to this legal grey area and does nothing unless the game company makes a major stink about it.
---
Your perks don't apply to your stash.  Those chems and food are lighter when you carry them. 
---
Last one happens to my team often, even when standing next to them. It says they arent in the same world. 
---
Friends lists go blank. And if we do team up the option to invite to team stays over their character permanently. 
---
They also will go invisible often. 
---
It's so broken. 
---
It‚Äôs not legit unless you have the hat
---
Wow that sucks. Well i am affraid that ppl will get banned for no reason.  They should rly check the account and the whole inventory, i hope bethesda is not banning accounts  without any decent proof. 
---
He wasn't screeching. He made a valid point. If you hate it so much, then why not move on or play other fallout games? Seems weird to keep following a game you hate and flip out on anyone who disagrees with you. Grow up.
---
Thank you, I always love that little bit extra height. I have the marsupial mutation üòÇ
---
Barney the dinosaur?
---
What I‚Äôve been doing is placing a foundation and once I‚Äôve built the walls and removing the foundation. That will leave bear ground inside your base to plant your crops
---
This one doesn't crash the server or lag it or anything. It just involves someone dropping a bag full of items, a friend looking at the bag, then moving the bag, creates 2 bags of same items.
---
I hope they get to the bottom of it.
---
The noise of cheering in celebration about an improvement to game balance? Sure, I'll make some noise! 
---
I was reading about it , it‚Äôs harsh move , maybe half of what they do is good, some weapons with that prefix don‚Äôt really benefit much from it 
---
It could be the new pvp area they mentioned in the latest Inside the Vault
---
uh, have you seen him?  IN Watoga, Phoenix PROtect you
---
If that would happen with my account then i would switch to RD2. I am lvl 96 and i dont feel like starting over again with a new account tbh
---
Funny but I‚Äôm thinking more like a purple business suit 
---
Yeah same. Honestly had to download mods for Skyrim and FO4 to match considering its hard to go back to normal "hop" height after that mutation. 
---
Eh, disagreed on this. So it's checkpointed to half way for you, you log back in to a different server that it's recently cleared and locked on .. what's your plan then?
---
For that one you just have to have had a total of 10,000 caps throughout the history of your character. 
---
Agree. Everytime I have to bring all the armor frames from the stash because I don't know which PA is 
---
Sorry but your reasoning is piss poor here. Not once ever in the history of time did someone go ‚Äúwow a weight mechanic limiting how much I can carry? What a fun mechanic! 
---
And not once did someone say ‚Äúyou know what this looter shooter completely dependent on picking up junk for every action needs? More ways to waste that precious weight cap!‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm sure you going to say that rifles having no weight reducing perks was meant to be that way for a balancing purposes right? Because a guy with a double shot explosive mini gun having a weapon that weighs 2.5 lbs and can level a horde of scorchbeasts is sooooo much weaker than someone with say a bolt action rifle or combat rifle right? There is no level of versatility that makes that trade off okay and only punishes people wanting to focus on those builds for no reason
---
Get real dude, changes need to be made to make this game more fun and more open to new players. And with the stash limit as low as it is and every item known to man weighing 20 lbs you spend more time worrying about what items to keep than playing to acquire new items. 
---
Make some noise about it? Have you seen this sub in the past 30 hours?
---
There's plenty of noise.
---
The problem is that most of it is just noise.
---
Too many people just bellyaching.
---
Happened to me the other day as well. Restarted my game fully 4 times and still said waiting. 
---
No i dont do that but I enjoy playing this game. If everyone gets banned there will be no more game. The market place has already gone down the toilet. You act like you stand up for people who get wronged but I guarantee if you weren‚Äôt behind the keyboard you would be to cowardly to say it to there face. You‚Äôre jealous is what it is. It literally effects you in no way
---
Hack that terminal and turn on the decon arches. 
---
It just works. Country road take me home...
---
Some are glitched. I don't have the ones for hacking terminals or missing weapons but have easily surpassed the required amounts on both. The magazine one only went off yesterday yet I had clearly read more than enough several weeks ago.
---
The caps one is cumulative, you do not need to get 10k on your character in game to achieve it.
---
Fucking Dick Kickem.
---
Enemy leveling and respawn times are my biggest complaint. Even when there are no other players nearby the enemies will instantly respawn near objectives after clearing an area. I've run out of beatable questlines at level 20 because every quest eventually brings me to a horde of enemies that are at least double my level (40-70) and they immediately respawn in the rare event that I'm able to use all my stimpaks and explosives to kill them all. At this point my armor and weapons are exhausted, I'm out of stimpaks and caps, out of adhesive to repair, and out of motivation to go find more just so I can have a high level enemy horde instantly respawn on top of my head. I didn't know a fallout game could make me feel so frustrated and defeated. 
---
Nobody wants to play this game with terrible weapons. The scorch beast was to hard everyone was saying before duping got to out of hand and now that you have good weapons and so do the people around you, youre complaining about the means those weapons got distributed. It ridiculous 
---
I'm just a welder in bay 9 that games when I get the time these days. I'm lucky if I get over 10 per week
---
Like your comma?
---
They should make a new incurable disease in game called Proverbs10:2 that kills you repeatedly every few minutes till you drop any inventory items that are above the "this has to be duped" threshold.
---
Are you trying to tell me that storing 300 gears and 300 Black Titanium is excessive? 
---
Lol I ain‚Äôt jealous, I have a legendary hand made I did all the mods myself and no way in hell will I part with such a powerful weapon. So your logic is flawed, I am not jealous. I hate cheaters and profiteerers
---
It can handle snow atleast, people did mods for it back in 4
---
Yeah, you guys all spread stuff like this as fact. Why? Why would you want to spread rumors like this? It cheapens any actual feedback you might provide and spreads it around for other people that blindly spread it around more. 
---
I think what that stat does is reduce hip fire accuracy, which would make sense
---
Not sure if the plans for .38 receivers exist, but I kow you can find .38 variants of the combat as drops... you'd think they do exist somewhere though.
---
How did TSE personally affect you?
---
Have an upvote.
---
I dont care for most legendary weapons or effects, I'd say do whatever us best in the name of balance really. 
---
Hahaha im sure you got that tse handmade dropped or you bought it off the someone in the market place that doesnt dupe
---
Yea I got someone from the market to make it mod it for me so the plans are available in 76
---
Ppl need to earn there legendaries like I did, not opt for the cheaters easy way.
---
1. Xbox One X

2. SudsiestOdin7/N.A/KailC

4.  So I tried to get the Fallout Classic Collection through the Bethesda.net launcher since I bought and played FO76 last year, only to be shown the option to buy. Curious, I opened a support ticket. They asked me what bethesda.net account was linked in my copy of Fallout 76. When I checked, it had someone else's account and email address. They then had me confirm that I purchased the game, then informed me that: "As it stands, we are unable to move entitlements from one account to another. All the progress done in Fallout 76 is saved into the account that is currently linked to Xbox. Any changes could cause issues. I understand that this was not the answer you were hoping for when you contacted us however I do appreciate your understanding regarding this matter."  
---
So, my character progress, my purchased atoms, my earned atoms, and the Fallout Classic Collection all belong to someone else, and that someone could probably revoke access to what I EARNED FAIRLY at any time!
---
5.  190116-001747  
---
Tl;dr: Someone else's [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) account is in my xbox copy of Fallout 76, everything I earned in game belongs to them and Bethesda Support says they can't do anything to fix this...this theft.
---
I suspect from the wording that they are flagging accounts making a large amount of items quickly. 
---
However, I also suspect that such a process is potentially liable to falsely flag accounts, which may have either
---
A) Made a bunch of a particular weapon or Armour to scrap for mod's
---
or
---
B) Made a crap ton of ammo/Chem's/etc. in one go.
---
If (B), Beth. would probably end up buried with false bans that they now need to sift through, which would heavily delay the process.
---
Reality is OP, while checking any single account may be a simple process (although i'd imagine they'd have to check logs to see what it was made, and where those items went, not just what's on your account now), if they have a large number of accounts to check, and not many people checking, it could be awhile.
---
Pacifist has nothing to do with the slap damage you take just fyi. Not sure if you were implying it did or not.
---
Because she leaves the Lonely Mountain and is heading to that town on the lake. Don't worry Bard will shoot it with a Black Arrow
---
Pump the brakes guys... heard from many people that they were being 1-shotted...blah blah blah. Seemed like enough people to assume it was true. When someone showed me that it wasn‚Äôt possible I immediately acknowledged my mistake and fixed my post. 
---
Looks like all junk items are affected as well... steel weighs 0.01 in my backpack, says 0.01 in Stash, but takes up 0.05 of the Stash limit.
---
I think the weight reduction perks must be broken for the Stash, what a bummer.
---
Then why can you nuke the other vaults?
---
I earn it honestly, not dis honestly. Me thinks your jealous cause there is an actual honest person in this thread doing things the right way and playing the right way 
---
I know what youre talking about but thisbisnt it. I'm going to bed, hopefully it just resolves itself.
---
As the saying goes time is money so you can say you earned it but so did the person who put in extra hrs at work so they can buy. No different
---
Was just about to ask you but luck has it I'm in your world
---
Pacifist does nothing but make it so you can not damage other players. 
---
üòÇü§ôüèæ
---
AFAIK, you need one to make a better one. I‚Äôve tried briefly to access the Fabricators but not much luck.
---
As someone mentioned earlier, many people don‚Äôt want their Voice of Set or Blade of Baset; you may be able to get one.
---
When you finished the BoS quest you would have gotten a PA chassis as a reward. It has all the ultracite armor on it. Some people don‚Äôt realize this (they don‚Äôt do a good job of telling you) and scrap it
---
Thanks for posting this! Based on your suggestion I reached out to u/RandomLettersMS for a bunch of serums and he responded immediately and hooked me up with everything extremely quickly. Anyone on XB1 who needs serums should be reaching out to him without hesitation. Thank you both!
---
Lvl 97 never used PA either.  I pretty much just call it pansy armor. XD
---
Haha I bet!
---
I mostly encounter them randomly at top of the world, because my camp is there. I have 6 nuclear keycards by now 
---
Playing the right way? Earned it honestly? Those are opinion based statements. You might have had it ‚Äúdropped‚Äù but very few do it that way that you consider the right way. You are in the minority of the people, the majority use the market place
---
Yes! 
---
They only affect carried items not stored items.
---
It's working as intended.
---
EXACTLY 
---
Eat in Gass? Where is Gass, sounds German or Polish.
---
Tesla is probably the most underrated weapon in the game, it's great since the damage spreads from enemy to enemy and the ammo weights nothing. It's like spamming AoE in wow when you have enemies bunched up.
---
Then why are you here running youtr mouth get rekt.
---
What's the price on the shielded BoS armor plan? Also where did you get it?
---
Yes they are!!
---
if only the end game was more interesting
---
Those people know this too as it‚Äôs their twinks passive leveling
---
I have yet to find an actual new player stumble all their way down there to fissure prime and sit in the bunker because they are afraid to leave 
---
The next time a low level player shows up, stop using those 1.5k bullets on the SBQ and start using them on the low leveled player.
---
It is. I have a default melee loadout, a hack-and-lockpick-and-trade-and-craft loadout, a heavy-gunner set, and a second crafting set because you can't fit all crafting perks into 15 INT =)  
---
It's really gamechanging. While fighting Scorchbeasts/SBQ I can switch between melee and heavy in a matter of seconds (you still have to to push 4 buttons consecutively, but it's acceptable). Lockpicking and hacking are only slowing you down ever so slightly.   
---
But tbh loadouts are not optimal. They need to make non-combat perks passive/zero point to get rid of senseless switching alltogether. It doesn't add any depth to the game, it just requires extra messing around every now and then. 
---
They patched it Dec 7th and it looked like crap have not played it since then, waste of money...... I bought a fishing simulator on steam and it had 21:9 support and it looks good, so lame
---
But on the other hand my .45-70 Gattling uses 5mm and does more damage than the 5mm Minigun
---
Nerf the cancer bats
---
SWITCH TO YOUR PISTOL, ITS FASTER THAN RELOADING!!!-cap. Price
---
We'll see how the nerf works. Changing it from a 1 shot gun to a 2 shot gun still doesn't help. :-P
---
I've seen them in vendors as many players don't keep them past level 50. I got a lv45 black diamond that way (mine was lv15). But you'd have better luck getting them direct from other players.
---
Oh no, I need to spend a miniscule amount of materials to completely rebuild my base instantly because you are such a badass. Best part is it probably costs you more mats and definitely takes longer to destroy a base than to repair it. You sure are teaching people a lesson lol.
---
2 months is still pretty unacceptable 
---
I did this with my trapper legs, except adding the lightweight mod to them brings the weight down to 0. 
---
Yeah no joke man please hurry and add private servers so I can just kill her myself 
---
I think you have too many switches. 
---
I have the roll up door. 
---
From my generator (inside) I have a wire to a switch. Then I have a wire to a pylon (inside). Then I have it to a pylon outside via a window. Then I run it to the connector next to the door. This allows me to have a switch for the door that is secure inside. 
---
Woke 
---
The market place is just an easy way out. Where is the fun in earning it honestly and the satisfaction. ( I earn this) this is mine, there is pride in your accomplishments.  Using something is in my eyes cheating and no pride in your hard earned work. And yes I am mature aged, this is where my logic will win. Lol 
---
Yep I lost 1k the first time I got one 
---
It was a bug moving your camp would copy everything up to 5 times ended up hundreds over budget any time I moved camp.
---
Only time i enter douche mode when i'm bored is by taking over a workshop. Your warned about possible pvp if you take a workshop so you should be prepared. 
---
But its impossible to die from slap damage in passive mode even from a OP tse weapon.
---
There is the bobblehead exploit but that will be fixed soon with the crackdown on dupers. 
---
But yea one thing that should be changed is players should not be allowed to attack other players camps who are in passive mode, even if the player gains a huge bounty if they have a friend it can just be claimed by them.
---
It ain't fake. I'll have to grind out everything today.
---
You're very welcome :)
---
"A normal lvl 45 or 50 weapon will take fucking forever to kill one lvl 68 mutant."
---
Get good.
---
Seriously though. I use a 29 dmg 10mm pistol and kill a lvl 68 in second. High luck build, multiple VATS crits to the head.
---
Sure, it'd take 100 shots if I just unloaded mindlessly into the torso. But actually using the systems the game has in place, it becomes an easy kill. 
---
This sounds awesome, like you being a legendary criminal accruing wanted signs wherever you go 
---
But yeah, most likely a bug 
---
FYI I did not mention a used car... Bad try though.
---
You are also welcome to not disagree.
---
Well the only reason they‚Äôre nerfing it is because of the same reason
---
Almost 2 months on TODD'S DIIIIIIIICK
---
thnx i might.give ot a go
---
It let him passively let others with tse kill the queen for himüòÇ
---
I am also a mature age so idk why you brought that up but anyways...all that is you opinion and like i said from what it seems is that most people would disagree because there is so many people who use it. And if we went off your train of thought and these others were dishonest then they wouldn‚Äôt have put trading in the game. Right?
---
Try using a light machine gun and say its the most common ammo type.
---
I really don‚Äôt mind workshops, I accept that is a risk, but camp, there is 0 benefit to destroying someone‚Äôs camp. 
---
They're only bullet sponges to people who don't know how to strategize, make good builds, or actually aim instead of holding down the trigger on their automatics. 
---
I tried the nuka cola factory and it doesn‚Äôt work sadly 
---
lol yeh i probly thought it was an empty chassis and scrapped it..dayum
---
And this is why NV was the best. 
---
I am curious too
---
We have yet to hear of ANYONE getting their ban appealed and removed 
---
Just like with customer support, I am not sure what they actually do 
---
Cool, does that mean they can give me back my TSE gat plasma the game decided to delete on fast travel?
---

Its a giant toilet. How you fell in is anyone's question.
---
I don't do much cap farming because it's boring, but when I do I cycle through cap farming methods a lot... because it's boring, and one method involves spamming a ton of aid items. I hope something like that isn't enough to get gigged.
---
What platform are you on? So far *I think* the only confirmed bans were from Xbox players.
---
Your world is full 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, here... but I think there's more to it than just that.
---
Private servers should have full damage buffs to TSE and the like. That way the crying bitches don‚Äôt complain about it (ignoring bobbleheads)
---
Not everyone should have to run the same builds. Using a 50 cal machine gun will take you ages to kill a single mutant
---
Nerf TSE weapons? Yes. nerf TS weapons? Yes. Nerf Melee weapons? As soon as you give us the abillity to disarm. 
---
That‚Äôs not even a joke.  I mean I‚Äôve had to look away from the screen at times.
---
Then what is it? Pretty sure all the people that get one shotted by them are the reason for them getting nerfed
---
yeh iv dropped 50 stimpaks for a teamate and the bag doesnt appear on the ground...and im down 50 stimpaks lol. happened with ammo as well..so now i just go to trade menu
---
See what they need to do is simple stop the queen scaling off people under level 50. Once the TSE hammer hits we will see alot of posts regarding queen events not finishing i hope they have thought ahead about this issue.
---
Do you use 50 cal exclusively? I dump mine. No one I know uses it but I'll gladly hold on to all I find and meet up with you once in a while to give it to you. 
---
I‚Äôll finish at this. I see your point. Thank you for your input üëç
---
As long as the Christmas noobs are out of my queen fight I don‚Äôt really care
---
All the better reason to use prime receivers. Really not hard to make ammo for them just use green thumb while farming and superduper when crafting. I was farming whitesprings near all those little buildings and was able to get a ton since everyone loves to farm the golf course and i was able to pick up enough mats to craft about 30 stable within an hour or 2. Paired with superduper think i ended up getting 40-42 stable and then just put on ammosmith and got around 2k ultracite 2mm before i stopped crafting (lvl2 power user so only 60% reduced weight isnt the greatest for that ammo).
---
I like when they show up and they are Nekked. Just undies and a gun... 
---
Or when you go hunting and you can't see your friend but the creatures around you are taking damage because he's really killing them although you can't see him... And he didn't use a stealboy
---
And do some slap damage that does nothing? Both are a waste of bullets
---
Honestly gives me a headache and makes me feel dizzy
---
What? You don‚Äôt want hunter leg armour pieces anymore? 
---
Oh, uhh, thanks! It's just my Tumblr name (without the hyphens) because every other name I tried was taken 
---
When I first heard of this game I thought this. "Oh, so the vault will have like NPCs in it but only the world will have players in it." You would be the overseer bringing back resources and scrap for your people. But nope. Get out and stay out. No vault home for you. 
---
Right?  I don‚Äôt remember ever having this happen during the Fire Breath attacks In Skyrim.
---
If you are going to waste them anyways you might as well send a message.
---
I do like having a bounty so it did make it more fun to have it go up. 
---
I have found that sometimes my old camp would not be placed due to mob spawn in the area. So a few opossums walking around the Camp area and boom no camp if I log on to that server.
---
Nice. Gonna try again later
---
Also I wish there was forced landing of scorchbeasts with damage like the dragons they are literally the same code and yeah fire breath was not nearly as annoying 
---
She‚Äôs dead 
---
Yeah it's not. Like I could only attack in vats, couldn't turn or move, and was only able to map travel.
---
Haha, that is a definite no.
---
It sucks so hard. They taking away my baby.
---
Bethesda just want get billions of dollars from players without fixing ang bug, they just fix few bug any month. Just because people mad about it in Reddit.. I LOVE FALLOUT SAGA, and i am mad with bethesda to ignore us, to ignore the bugs, and let the most beautiful game to die slowly!!!
---
Its only a matter of MONEY! probabilly they are not working so much on this game because they saw how hard is fix a s**t work.
---
Probabilly they are already try to work for making next game.. Who had pay 100 dollars for this game shoul be very angry. NOT ALL PEOPLE is into Reddit reading stuff and news about softwork houses, exist also people who just saw the trailer and got scammed by bethesda.
---
This game is not a game, is a pre-alfa game.
---
If u are not agree, probabilly you have some "interest" or just silly.
---
What caps are we talking 
---
It‚Äôs Fallout that‚Äôs really all I got. I‚Äôm still playing missions and storyline stuff. I‚Äôm also pretty casual and like lvl40. I am still a little fuzzy on what would be worthwhile once I hit like 100 and above. 
---
I‚Äôll let you know once (if) I‚Äôm there.
---
Daaaamn! I played fo4 but usuallt got hung up on the settlement building lol
---
If you have access to a lot of acid like i do since my camp has an acid extractor, just doing one breach and clear event with net you around 200 lead and steel with all the ore it gives you. Supplement that with normal junk grabbing and you never run out of lead and steel. 
---
I honestly cant remember the last time a queen kill took longer than 5 minutes. Im curious if region and console matters here. Im australian and i often see people chain nuke the queen at roughly 7-10pm some nights, but almost never see nukes prior to 7pm.
---
The game needs to make it so lower level players can‚Äôt do any damage (actual or just tagging) on the boss (SBQ).  If your level is 20 below the SBQ‚Äôs level (just a number for discussion) then too bad.  No damage by you or tagging on the queen and therefore no loot. Lower levels can still help with adds. 
---
And more importantly, make SBQ rewards worth the effort!  
---
You launched it yet?
---
You could start a new character and go directly to do those quests. You'll get both the sword and gun (level 25) upon completion, and then can trade them to your main for producing higher level variants.
---
Name your price, I'd appreciate buying in bulk of possible. Thanks for your reply :)
---
I can snap their wings in 3-4 four shots of my My Explosive Limb Damage Dragon and it seems to have little to no effect on them.  Sometime, but not always, they land but only for normal duration before taking flight again.  And that‚Äôs with TWO broken wings.
---
That's not really what I'm bringing up. It's more the fact that you can barely if not at all organize your crops while having a flat surface in many locations. Especially if you wanna live on a rocky cliff with almost no space but you wanna have crops. So I thought, hey why not maybe get a foundation that's basically a giant space to plant and grow crops like melon and corn and such things.
---
My goodness the madness haha. Just got another one. We out here west Virginia mf 
---
Melee needs a nerf. Bloodied weapons+unyielding armor just makes melee too strong. Maybe don‚Äôt nerf the base damage but there needs to be some sort of cap. Tse is high damage but lower than bloodied+unyielding. And now that tse is going to be even worse, the disparity will grow. When your strength is 30 and that‚Äôs the only SPECIAL that directly contributes to damage, it becomes a problem.
---
I understand the argument that this kind of build leaves you vulnerable, but dying has hardly any consequences. That‚Äôs my opinion, curious to hear yours.
---
Does the queen buff with extra players? I haven‚Äôt participated in this event yet. 
---
Something else was going on. There's videos of people disproving death through slap damage with absurd amounts of damage. No videos of anyone getting killed through it anywhere that I have ever found or seen. I know there's an exploit with workshops where people have a small window to mess with you even if you're not technically there defending it. Workshops in general seem pretty wonky. 
---
I just solo'd a silo and dumped 13 fusion cores into her to fail because some lvl 40s were baiting every regular beast spawn to come to bravo.  What a fucking waste, most annoyed I've ever been at the game, like she landed why are you fucks killing mobs and I'm the only one taking a sledge to her face 
---
9 perk cards!!! It‚Äôs insane. And none of the SPECIALs increase damage other than strength, leaving ballistic weapons lagging behind
---
[deleted]
---
I have earned a lot of legendaries. I would like to earn my perfect legendary set of Heavy Combat Armor with my perfect ideal stats. I also value my time, though I do waste a lot of it spending time in places like this. Games would themselves sell these weapons if they could get away with it without the backlash of pay to win cries. What's the difference between farming caps and buying a legendaary, farming for 200 hours to get it, killing 1 3 star legendary at level 30 and getting it, or paying $5 for it? No difference really. Except I feel very sorry for that guy who spends 200 hours on it. That's bad game design making that poor fellow do all that work for an item that then gets nerfed into the ground.

What if we have to join the human faction to fight the robots!?!
---
It was almost identical to FO3 with the addition of ADS üòÇ
---
I found this out while watching a mirelurk queen vs a scorch beast, didn‚Äôt end well for me
---
Yeah, should be close to over by now. I crashed so I don‚Äôt know.
---
"Be more open-minded" Oi, genius. Being "open-minded" does not entail being "so open-minded" that your brain falls out of your bloody skull.
---
As for why you would bother, let's class it as an experiment. i can get behind playing shit games for enjoyment. Ride to hell: Retribution is one such example.  Acknowledging a game is absolute garbage, and yet enjoying it for those very reasons - that'  it's terrible - can be a great way to pass the time laughing. What I don't understand are people defending a piece of shit which barely functions. So that's the experiment bit - I'm wondering why people are masochists. The rest of your comment is just useless assertions, so I'm just going to ignore it
---
Aliso "low information person" Fucking lol. Boi, I could wipe the fucking floor with you on information. Want to talk about science?
---
I wish it had that falling effect like the dragons did when you crippled them and yeah it‚Äôs like they can heal from crippleü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah even small planter boxes would be nice to have tbh. Just wish they did this already. I hate being on a cliff that can barely hold my food due to trees and small rocks that conflict. Plus floating plants aren't so good looking.
---
Only people upset about tse are the ones getting griefed by dupers. They just complain a whole lot so Bethesda thinks it's a major issue, which it really isn't. Tse is a legendary weapon for end game materials which have been exploited for PvP one shots and griefing bases. Bethesda is working on exploits, but the easy fix is to Nerf damage. Because nerfing something 75% is going to take the duper from 4million damage to 1million damage. 
---
I might be on in an hour or so. I only have one, you can take it off me for free. 
---
That sounds nice, wonder if the 20% stacks with the 90% perk card..
---
I got trolled there once near the workshop
---
I had the same thought lol
---
Probabilly is way more fun than probably
---
Is the space bugged in regular clothes?  Or just PA?
---
Why didn't the rest really matter? Everything else i have laid out with 76 are serious issues with the game - terrible "story-line", brain-dead AI and the game being unplayable because of constant bugs because Bethesda has no pride in their games. Those are not small matters and bringing those sorts of issues up is not "bashing" the game. There are serious, major flaws with the game that start from the foundations.  
---
The game fell to 10 fps on the fuckin' consoles. 10 frames mate.  On pc, it's a bit of a different story but on consoles, it was the worst experience I've ever had playing a game.
---
it doesn't play like any other shooter on the market either. At all. if you've played 76, you know damn well how freakin' clunky the combat is. What other shooter on the market has enemies randomly speed up their movement speed to stupid levels? What other shooter has a nonsensical enemy levelling system which makes no sense whatsoever? What other shooter has NPC's which don't take damage and regenerate health just 'cos? What other shooter gives you as damage bug in PVP? 76 is fucking **broken.** It. Does. Not. Work.
---
The wife spent just about 14 hrs over 2 nights server hopping to get the plans. It can be tedious but you know the spawn point, so keep at it. 
---
I‚Äôd honestly wait a while. Patches have been coming but they‚Äôre fairly slow and only a shovel of dirt into a very deep hole that needs to be filled (giggity). It‚Äôll be more enjoyable by then and you won‚Äôt be burnt out on it when they are fixed.
---
They're OP in PVE as well as PVP.
---
They're still going to be some of the best affixes out there after the nerf.
---
It just gives Bethesda a chance to buff weaker shit like all Pistols and not have them grossly overshoot their intended power level.
---
It sucks but that's what's up right now.
---
Ive been lucky enough to get both an explosive lever action and explosive assault rifle. Explosive is straight up the best affix to get. Suppressors still work on explosive rifles too. Both guns are ghoul slayer affix with explosive. The LAR 1 shots almost everything and the AR usually can 2 shot most things and 1 shot any non glowing ghoul.
---
If im playing sneaky sniper i never have points in tank killer, the explosive damage is just simply too good. I cant wait for the nerf to them so i can experiment with Nerd Rage and unyielding armor as a sneaky sniper.
---
I had heard that but when I checked someone's today I didn't see anything!
---
Her damage resistance goes up with each player in the event
---
Been wanting one from the get go but nothing yet. Since i was a young lad i adored the Joker, i have alot of the merch , tattoos and all my accounts and lads based on him since i was a young boy. 
---
So i would love a purple and if possible a touch of green.
---
You can get green hair at least 
---
Is it so wrong? We need to carry all the Christmas noobs to queen kills anyway and they wouldn‚Äôt have bothered nerfing them if people didn‚Äôt bitch about them
---
Maybe it was wishful thinking then :P
---
Green hair with forced smile, purple makeup and blemishes for mucked paint for a Heath Joker look. I currently run the Nurse Joker look but i would loooove for purple suit.
---
Ive been playing with the better perk loadout mod since the day it came out. If they ever outlaw mods without adding this feature baseline i would almost certainly quit. Im level 380 with 650 hours played. It is without question the single most important quality of life feature they can add. Its insane it hasnt been added yet when a mod did it so fast.
---
Yet you can't give up on telling Reddit about it. 
---
Nah, they need to make it so you only get loot/xp/quest completion if you do a certain amount of damage. They can hide all they want after they put their percentage in and if they aren't strong enough then they obviously shouldn't even be there.
---
If you really think there is no point to playing it, dont?
---
Sidenote, RDR:O was an utter flop, at least this dumpster fire has given me hours of entertainment.

Here's a before an after screenshot of my stash, basically 107 lbs of weight in my backpack turns into **425** lbs of weight in my Stash!

IMPORTANT PSA
---
Nuking anywhere other than Whitesprings or Prime is a waste of a nuke.
---
\- Whitesprings gives you plenty of legendary enemies, lots of flux materials, and plenty of hardened mass, glowing mass, etc.
---
\- Prime is good for the SBQ and violet flux.
---
\- Every other place I've seen nuked has sucked hard balls.  Few enemies, no legendaries, no people rejoining to respawn the mobs, areas in the ash heap with no flux.  Please don't do it.  If you keep it up I'm going to write down your name and find your base and waste a nuke on THAT.
---
Ok so as a lvl 40....I have tried to mainly spec for 1h melee....I‚Äôve never even attempted going into the hot zone after a nuke just because I read about noobs screwing up the queen....what should I do once I make that jump so I‚Äôm helping and not hindering?
---
Don't forget to say no homo. All it takes is one time and then you're gay for life.
---
The solution is simple. Melee! Even better if it's bloodied. And you'll also outdamage most people with TSEs. And when she's flying don't bother.
---
You can find someone who sells it for 1k. People just suck and like to oversell.
---
I personally haven‚Äôt seen a buff yet.  What makes you think they will ever buff anything?  
---
She found out about the other experiments, so they HAD to tell her something to throw her off guard. She was part of the experiment.
---
I mean, would they REALLY task just the overseer alone with securing nuclear weapons? It was a test to see how she'd respond to the pressure. 
---
#wow
---
.
---
1k
---
2k if you're desperate
---
3k if it's on a built torso...
---
I had one I was planning to sell for 1.5k but it got auto scrapped.
---
And people kept saying they didn't have the tools to do this.  I always thought it was pretty obvious they would. They have a database, they can query that database.  
---
Those fucking invisible assaultrons are annoying, impossible to VATS, tanky, and can deal a ridiculous amount of damage. Still, the servers are the most dangerous enemies in there.
---
I feel your pain
---
Lost a shock &amp; a stealth boy in one run D=
---
Crazy.
---
I've seen steady improvements with every patch.
---
They're nerfing the fuck out of everything with no decent buffs in sight. I definitely agree with that.
---
I would hope that Bethesda wipes characters and accounts but allows some players to recreate new characters and start fresh. 
---
Majority of dupers need to be banned.
---
Man i have zero problem with escort quests, they just arent worth the insanely long time they take for the garbage you get as a reward, wow thanks, 20 .10mm ammo! Woohoooooo
---
From what me and a few friends have tried and *normally* works is if you wait until there about 2 minutes left before you start repairing (it only takes like 30 seconds to repair them all even solo) AND make sure not to repair any pipes before that part of the quest starts or it'll fail everytime.
---
Thanks guys! I'll probably just server hop until I find one on sale at Whitesprings Bunker (or an active Queen to kill!)
---
Oh this is great üëç 
---
It took me a while to see the typo 
---
The other poster was referring to the change proposed in this post, that the hazmat suit would become an outfit that could be worn over your armor, which would be massively OP without big drawbacks like cost to repair, etc.
---
The one change I would really like to see as a stealth sniper who hates power armor, is for the hazmat suit to replace all your armor but not de-equip it similar to how power armor works. I've reluctantly started using my ultracite PA in nuke zones simply because re-equipping all my armor and outfits are a pain in the ass.
---
P.S. Thank you to all the people nuking fissure site prime off to the side so the queen fight takes place out of the nuke zone, you guys are the true heroes.
---
Patience, my fren
---
And much more real-based ballistic weapons
---
And ammo-based damage
---
And much more different ammo caliber
---
And different ammo types
---
And ammo crafting/scraping
---
And collecting of ammo cases
---
And repair kit
---
Together they are, sure. But, TS by itself is not. And I did say explosive effect is a bit op. My point was it is going to hurt a list of guns that are only TS not TSE. Honestly they just take explosive effect off of automatics and shotguns. Idk why that is even on those kind of guns. The point still stands nerfing TS down to 25% is a bit much. 75 - 80% is understandable.
---
Working on it! If it didn't keep crashing on me tonight, it would be easier....
---
Hahaha. Exactly, and I just find them to be very boring. They're nice if its 3am and you just want to do something chill, but...
---
You got that hot-ass real estate bb
---
You can place fireplaces and slap a small water purifier on it. Fireplaces count as dirt. 
---
Well thanks Bethesda we are to the point of play melee or don't even try. Thanks for ruining every gun build that dosnt want to run around at 20% hp and destroying toons people have put months into. Spend 2 months farming a weapon so your not useless and only get to use it for 2 weeks. Bye bye fallout 76 I will never buy another Bethesda product again. Hell I wouldn't play anything from them even if they paid me to play it. Have fun suffering through them trying to turn the game into fortnite 76 guys I'm done with it.
---
Sounds basically like what just happened with me.
---
 *You want sympathy, look in the dictionary between shit, and syphilis!* 
---
You have to care some amount to post this. 
---
God Damn Shed Noobs!!!
---
Yeah.... Trust me when i say don't waste your time hopping 
---
Just keep posting
---
Make your adds to request like 1.5k
---
Someone will bite
---
im asking if theve fixed anything or added anything new
---
Melee is op it will be the next complained about build and will suffer the same fate
---
That isnt realistic ballistic mechanics.. Thats just an addition of unimaginative weapons and an ammo recycling ability üòÇ
---
So no.
---
I never specified what kind of hole ;)
---
Yeah it's been a real letdown for me too. I was properly hyped for the game at announcement but the hyped crashed and burned during B.E.T.A. and release, haven't touched the game since
---
Really? My buddy bought one there last week for 300 and change though
---
Again, I'm okay with explosive nerf. Although making it where perks don't increase the legendary effect would be better. TS is not op as people act. I'm okay with a slight decrease fine but, down to 25% is a bit much. I
---
This is literally my play style 100%. I play purely solo and im level 380. I will happily go out of my way to help people. I wandered into a level 32 players camp bringing with me a bunch of supers that nearly killed him because he was using unarmed. After we cleaned his base up I gave him a twisted mutations serum and a couple of cool 2 star level 30 melee weapons id been saving. Got a love and a thumbs up and moved on to the next thing.
---
I didn't say it didn't. Perhaps you didn't understand what I was saying ü§®
---
50 Cal munches ammo faster than the minigun, in my experience. If you're set up for heavy weps, whilst its pretty mediocre damage-wise, the laser gat + power user 3 is your friend for saving ammo whilst dropping most things, since fusion cores are still very easy to get, and PU3 gives you 999 rounds in the clip, without the core needing to be fully charged. 
---
The terminal can be anywhere, as long as it's connected to the same generator. The switch should be connected to the door.
---
It's worth keeping an eye out for the Wool Fisherman's Cap as well; it's slightly smaller and dark green, but it leaves your character with a trace of their hair. I prefer the color mismatch over being bald, but that's just me.
---
If the perks don't apply to the Stash box (which is a major bummer, reducing the perks to worthless) it would be really nice if they at least **update the weight in Stash** so you know what is using up all your limit. It's pretty stupid to display weight values that don't correspond to the item weight.
---
Just in case anyone from Bethesda is reading this...
---
Kill a Dragon, get crafting materials for best armor in the game.
---
Kill Scorch Beast, get some food IF it doesn‚Äôt clip through the world.
---
I really like your idea for the 'Battle of' quests, but do you think the seevers are gonna be stable enough for a whole hour to do this? With all the enemies coming non-stop? They can barely stay up long enough to complete a silo run, or Scorched Earth as it is.

Yeah this game does have the best community. Love it when the community abuses exploits that causes my game to lag
---
He was screeching. If you think that's a valid point, then I have news for you. You're an idiot.
---
Let's go over the reason why you're an idiot shall we?
---
 First of all, you're an idiot for thinking that I don't play other games. Right now, I'm playing D:OS2, reading overlord on the side when I get a bit bored of sorting out my inventory in D:OS2 and then I've got Reddit open on my secondary. [https://imgur.com/Qk0KSNi](https://imgur.com/Qk0KSNi) I'm the multi-tasking king, bitch.
---
Second mistake is to think that JMP's stupid comment was a valid response to me. Unlike what you think, the world is not all daisies and fucking roses. I care about the Elder Scrolls franchise a lot. Fallout, never really got into, I'm more of a high fantasy guy. Know why I'm in a subreddit bitching about 76? Because i don't want the same fucking thing to happen to TES. Fuck me for not wanting a series I love to turn into absolute dog-shit - there's already enough bloody issues with Skyrim as it is.
---
Sell them on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  I see people buying them all the time for 1,000-1,500 caps.
---
I think there's even a guy who has an alt between level 15-45 that just farms the handmade plans....lol
---
TS and explosive should not be on the same weapon. That combo is definitely op. I'm speaking of TS weapons, not TSE. Explosive weapons do get quite high in damg with demolitionist, bloody mess and etc. (A bit too high in my op and a weapon with TSE gets in the definitely op range)
---
&gt; nothing changed
---
Ok. Bye. 
---
He was extremely lucky
---
I've hopped hundreds upon hundreds of times and the best I've seen was a stealth boy and calibrated shocks, both once each
---
I cant get the switch to work, even alone, does it need to be directly connected to the generator? or are some conduits and wires okay?
---
It's (sometimes) available from the same vendor bot as the Long Coat. I grabbed it on one of my farming attempts just because I knew it was unique. On the plus side, it's much cheaper; I think I paid just under 200 caps.
---
I am having the same issues. More server disconnects than ever, crashes and most of the time I can't send and accept team invites anymore. It also takes AGES to load into a server and it sometimes gets stuck in the loading screen (have to restart the game then, after waiting 20 minutes to join a world).  
---
My friend's screen also turns black fairly often after fast travelling (but you can still see the PA menu). She has to restart the game all the time.
---
I was explaining what happened to me and how it was dumb because I understand how dumb it is. Why don't you explain how the system works since you obviously understand it better than I do
---
Just swing like crazy, kill random mobs if she in the air. Don't stand around watching other people kill things. If your damage isn't high enough to take them out on your own, shadow a higher level and attack the same things they do. Only thing I can think of but don't let these triggered folks determine how you play the game. Do what's fun for you even if it is standing there and watching g in awe as the lag slowly takes you. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm totes down for not restricting PVP servers to specific PVP only characters.  Im planning on having the gear and perks to counter TSE if need be like you mentioned.  I just dont want to start over in this hypothetical scenario of needing to roll new characters on PVP servers.  Seems a little too much of a PITA for those of us who have already started leveling second characters for PVP and such.
---
I try turn it on at the start of every play session, but never hit the 4/4 needed. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say it is realistic. I said it closest to reality among whole Fallout.
---
And what is imaginative weapons?
---
No, not at all. But they should work on making it work, lol.
---
Reminds me of the arbiters from Halo lol
---
I have some reasonably decent guns....non legendary but decent all the same. But this is the type of advice I‚Äôm looking for....thanks!
---
I was an idiot and sold or scrapped my old power armor.... I am on xbox though, looking for anything specific?
---
turrets need a buff. 
---
1. their levels don‚Äôt scale, but enemy levels scale to you. 
---
2. their range is really bad. any enemy with a gun out-ranges the turret, making them useless. 
---
I'm all for weapon/build balance but, some will naturally excel. Just how things work. My problem is the TS nerf is a bit much, seems more like a knee jerk repsonse than a calculated one, eh.
---
Did buy any items/plans off players recently before the ban?
---
Focus on killing the mobs please :)
---
As a  high level melee player I can 1 shot most of the mobs myself.  But that's wasting DPS not killing the queen.
---
Also if your high level ranged characters are having to stop and jump around to avoid / kill the mobs, same thing.
---
Take care of the mobs, and the higher level players will take care of the queen.
---
Yea I had time to check it out. It gives you all the effects of the other levels. Thanks again. 
---
I accept your points.
---
Mine was just that the reason for the nerf isn't pure player bitching.
---
If that made Bethesda do stuff... then they'd already have implemented some really crazy shit, due to player bitching.
---
&gt;Sorry but your reasoning is piss poor here. Not once ever in the history of time did someone go ‚Äúwow a weight mechanic limiting how much I can carry? What a fun mechanic!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;And not once did someone say ‚Äúyou know what this looter shooter completely dependent on picking up junk for every action needs? More ways to waste that precious weight cap!‚Äù
---
Would you have preferred to be limited by inventory slots instead? The best part about these two sentences is that you just described some of the core elements for a survival game. I think I may have just diagnosed your problem, you don't like survival games. Therefore, this game is not intended for you.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm sure you going to say that rifles having no weight reducing perks was meant to be that way for a balancing purposes right? 
---
Yes, and I did. If you actually read the parent post, it clearly states this and that it gives incentive to using other weapons because rifles are currently the go-to for all situations. That's like when people complain that melee weapons do too much damage right now, which gives incentive to use them, if they were to perform similar to rifles, people would rather use rifles because they're overall better.
---
&gt;Because a guy with a double shot explosive mini gun having a weapon that weighs 2.5 lbs and can level a horde of scorchbeasts is sooooo much weaker than someone with say a bolt action rifle or combat rifle right? There is no level of versatility that makes that trade off okay and only punishes people wanting to focus on those builds for no reason
---
That's great, bringing up a problem that is already being address in the upcoming update, that'd make your point valid! /s
---
Versatility is mainly depended on your perk build, which determines your play-style and gear. The more you remove conveniency from your build, the more the game rewards you by freeing up slots for perks, which allows you to either focus more offensively or defensively at the cost of inconvenience. While TSE was a problem, and those who wield it refused to agree, it's being taken care of. However, why should people care about what other people are doing rather than playing how they enjoy? Why would someone want to do something that feels like a punishment? You're obligated to do something you don't want to. It's not like enemies has been buffed to compensate for these weapons.
---
&gt;Get real dude, changes need to be made to make this game more fun and more open to new players. And with the stash limit as low as it is and every item known to man weighing 20 lbs you spend more time worrying about what items to keep than playing to acquire new items.
---
I assume that you played previous title where you essentially hoard enough items to fully neglect the looting feature of the game to the point that the rest of your mats and ammo are coming from vendors due to the limitless bank of caps you possess. As far as promoting the game for new player, I'm pretty sure those who don't like survival games are going to avoid this game, plain and simple. This game was not advertised as your traditional Fallout game, which disappointed people even though it was stated that they were doing something new. If you're not enjoying the gameplay now, you're not going to be enjoying in the foreseeable future. 
---
Also, inventory management is fine in this game. Not only do I keep a certain amount of resources of each type, but I sell the excessive amounts to vendors to hit cap and purchase mods/plans that I yet to own or purchase bulks of resource that I do need. I don't the problem is the game, the problem may just be you and your mindset from playing past Fallout games. Time to adapt my friend or play something else.
---
Bloodied+unyielding will get nerfed for sure. It‚Äôs just too OP when you have 30 strength. And sure you‚Äôre low HP but there are no consequences for dying. 
---
So guns mainly rifles should be unplayable? Interesting. Go take a hunting rifle out with full perks and have to go through 2-3 mags to drop a single super mutant while chugging 3 stimpaks so while his buddy's smash your face in and then tell me this is good. Oh wait you won't because you will play over powered melee. I can see nerfing explosive but TS was the only thing making a rifle build playable. Now anyone with a rifle build won't even be able to kill things to swap to melee.
---
Hey buddy please no more than 2k. I promise ya people will let you know if they find one.
---
Check.

---
They do stack (multiplicative), but it's likely that there's a maximum damage to DR ratio after which armor penetration has no further effect. Not sure what that ratio is yet.
---
Well, they staying on the same weapon just only 1milllion duper damage. Unless they just eat some more bobbleheads. Lol. Exploits the problem, high level end game need high level damage. A proper build anything can seem OP. 
---
I want a tse western so badly. Have an explosive one rn and I love it. Will be sad to see it be suddenly terrible.
---
She's in the basement of the Whitesprings.  At least I think that's her.  Same voice actor otherwise :)
---
Pacifist = you dont enter pvp unless you are fighting over workshop with someone else.
---
If you dont understad this, u die, bcos you are probably not experienced. No offence.
---
Glad to hear it 
---
Heavy guns and slow reload guns benefit quite a lot from a TS effect same with certain guns that talking behind in damg late game. Makes those more viable in the sense of being able to handle/kill stuff without it taking forever.
---
we should retain ownership of public workshops for 5 minutes after you leave the world. when the game inevitably crashes, you can join your last world and everything‚Äôs fine. 
---
Agreed about the melee weapons 100%.
---
Whitsprings nuke zones.  Don't try to melee or kill things.  Bring a pipe pistol and a crap load of .38 ammo.
---
Hit every ghoul once.  Let the higher level players kill them.
---
You still get XP, loot, and legendary drops.
---
You'll power level a lot faster there than other places.
---
Aim for the engines, get some decent hits and it'll start trailing smoke and slow right down. If you have something that improves cripple chance, equip it.  If you don't kill them fast, they sometimes spook and flash off across the map at stupid speeds, thats been a thing since beta. 
---
pacifist mode should really extend to camps. 
---
They're only making it better? i'm sorry, are you alseep at the wheel or something? The first patch they did was larger than the bloody game itself (or was it? idk, the patch was absurdly large, I can remember that much) and it did Jack shit to fix 76's issues. it took Bethesda one whole month to edit an .ini file to implement a bastardised 21:9 aspect ratio support. One whole month to edit a bloody .ini file. One. Whole. month. Bethesda doesn't give a rats arse about the products they put out.
---
You know what's depressing though? Even if Bethesda did actually care about 76 and patched it with a modicum of intelligence and competence, 76 as a concept would still be an empty, hollow shell. No NPC's (yes, i know there technically are, but you know what I'm talking about), a "story-line" which revolves around listening to cool shit that happened to everyone who's now dead, a PVP system which does not make the blindest bit of sense for it to even exist in the first place.
---
I mean Jesus. Do you really want me to continue? Even as a concept, 76 is fraught with massive flaws.
---
How dare you kill Ghram!
---
I would've helped him out if I saw that :)
---
I wasn't fighting over a workshop and you are ignorant as hell. Later
---
True. Don't me get wrong though, I'm all for needed balance.
---
I'm pretty sure each thing checks original damage and adds up from there. 
---
So if you do 100dmg crit plus 40% from perk your new crit is 140. Then get a 15 bonus to crit from food it checks the 100 and adds 15, total of 155. Etc etc. 
---
I‚Äôm well aware of how the bug worked. The issue is not having it happen as it would happen to pretty much everyone.  The issue is using the bug  to place an excessive amount of turrets. 
---
AFAIK the reason for the turrets taking up so much budget is because of how they tax the server. Having an excessive amount could cause lag issues for everyone else, especially with missile turrets. This is a dick move. 
---
Lol at the rate of rng plans that's fucking impressive killed sbq 9 times this week what I got? 9 fucking explosive vent plans 
---
If you want to use more than one requisition, you have to at least wait until the previous one is delivered, or looted, before you can use the next. At least that how it worked in the Beta... haven't had much use for them afterward.
---
To clarify, I have some plans and stuff that I no longer use that I am happy to give away or trade for something of equal value. I don't get super into the selling thing
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Tl:dr People shouldn't be praising / defending a game which doesn't fucking work and is flawed from the ground up\*
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Not at all worth it 
---
Make a post asking to buy one for a reasonable price...managed to get mine off a duper for 500, or at least I‚Äôm assuming cause he had 100 of them.
---
You want to post something that's not a complete waste of my time, I'll take you seriously. Till you do that, I'll throw shit right back you. Simple really.
---
I don't miss either while aiming myself. Just does no damage at all. Ushally under 10% for a body shot. I guess with auto aiming being the only way to kill things with a rifle build this game will be uninstalled an Bethesda will never get another dime. Total waste of 2 months building a toon and they just destroy it all in one day. They can go to hell and take their shitty product with them. They got the money though so I guess now they just want to cut the cost of keeping the servers up.
---
In order for the switch to work, it needs to be wired in between the generator and whatever you want to control. You can have intervening conduits, the only requirement is that the switch has to be able to govern the flow of power between the generator and the target. If it's out to the side, it's not doing anything.
---
They stack. I don't know the details, but I can say that it stacks.
---
Little late but I followed you for future kills

You want to try again?
---
Nice! I may do that eventually, but none of my friends are playing tonight. Figure I'll roll the dice and server hop a bit since I have nothing else to do.
---
I have one on hand i'd be willing to sell at 1.5k if you decide to go that route. On Xbox.
---
I try to launch 3 nukes a day. I‚Äôll be inactive from Saturday - Wednesday 
---
I'll join
---
 Aye I guess you are right, the weapons being abhorrently bad in the first place is the true problem anyways. 
---
I guess the fact that I spent time caps and resources looking to trade for said weapons with one or both of the affixes is what drove me to include them in the title.
---
Have you launched it yet?
---
I appreciate it, and will let you know if I do, but since I have just over 2k caps, I'm gonna test my luck for a bit. 
---
4 more min 
---
No worries. I've done the hopping game many times. Sometimes you do get lucky.
---
K joining now. Soundlessaxis7
---
One way to make sure that happens, dont launch a nuke at Whitesprings.
---
Yeah because all this crap I just got bored and quit playing fo76 !
---
Someone who actually offered something substantive and not just screeching at me. Fuckin' finally. You're one of the few people who actually did try and explain. Thanks for that. 
---
I strongly, strongly disagree with you on the survival elements done right. It was very watered down. Personally, I would have loved for them to do Frostfall for fallout and do a realistic needs and diseases take. That would be survival done right for me.
---
This is awesome thanks for sharing 
---
Haha. I did it opposite then. I was in PA till 50, and really couldnt wait to get out of it. The benefits at lower levels hard to overlook.
---
I mean honestly I would believe 40k cells over 40k .50 cal, since energy weapons are all trash.
---
World full
---
We‚Äôre at the command center now ready to launch. But the thing is saying there is a cool off period for 1 hour!! 
---
I remember how Bethesda's lackeyes on this sub just a few months ago called people critical of the launch as entitled. Funny how that actually describes the Fallout 76 dev team. It's these nebulus plan names and a long list of other "fit and polish" issues that shows the team just half-assed it. It's like a high quality meat cut that has been dropped on the floor and forgotten about. Then they just picked it up off the floor, dust bunnies, mold and all, threw it on the flat-top for 30 seconds, and sent it to your table. They gave zero fucks about anything other than shipping the game and related merchandise. 
---
          
---
Dev Team looks entitled to me. 
---
Damn 
---
Disnt that place get a nerf along with the shotguns?
---
THANKS! I finally understand this damn switch!
---
This is assuming the .50 in this case in .50BMG or something comparable.
---
I don't think it's ever specified: It could be a low velocity .50 round, which would absolutely be weaker than .308 Winchester.
---
I'm queued to join. Hopefully someone leaves
---
Yes to both. 
---
They kill everything but SB, SBQ, MQ, and Behemoths in 1 hit without perks. With perks they can also kill MQ, almost SB (atleast with a TSE Gauss), and Behemoths. Melee without perks is the same but with perks they can 1 shot EVERYTHING including SBQ and thats without stacking bobbleheads you just gotta have the right build and weapon for it. 
---
IMO I like the nerf for TSE but they also should've nerfed the fuck out of melee and fixed the bobbleheads. BUT since they're nerfing the 1 thing that makes SB less annoying since you can take them down quicker they should atleast six their fucking endless screeching that makes it where if there is more than 1 SB around you literally cannot see anything on your screen. They don't do shit for dmg but damn theyre annoying.
---
Idk if the, shotguns Already got nerfed
---
We launched now so it‚Äôs going off in 2 min 
---
Hopefully I make it there. You in a party?
---
Someone nuked it in my lobby, nothing good to be honest. I was the only one who showed up because I believe it was nuked a bit before I got there. Had enough Bloated Ghouls for me though, only saw 1 legendary but it was a 3 star. Saw 2 Scorched Berserkers lv50 and heard One Colonel Gutsy. Went inside Monongha and there were more bloated, that's where I found my legendary. 
---
Not yet, but TSE combo will still be pretty good and probably the fastest way to kill NPCs from a distance.
---
Level 113 and almost 500 gone :(
---
&gt; As a level 20
---
lol.
---
Haha, I have a spare chass if you need it mate to affix to
---
Needs a bunch of stable flux though
---
I know there's a quest that requires you to find an in-tact hallucigen gas container to craft the quest item but as far as ruptured ones I think they're just junk. 
---
Yea i trade a lot from facebook. I would also point out though that my inventory is no where near full, i had like 150-200 pounds on me and my stash isn't even full.
---
Legend. I'll give you something for your effort though. Please give me a 5 minute warning because my gf is playing Detroit. Thanks again
---
" For me, playing 76 was like wading through a dumpster bin that was full of flaming faeces. "
---
That's how you feel about it. Others enjoy the game, and see the issues the game has and it doesn't affect them. Are they wrong about not being upset? No. Are you wrong for being upset? No. At the end of the day it boils down to your opinion and how you emotionally feel about the game. I'm 50-50 on it, as i've played other games with similar/worse launches. The key here is how they move forward.
---
As for why they defend it? Emotions. People tend to want to defend things they like. It's just natural.
---
Side note, what is a reasonable price to ask for ultracite 5MM ammo?
---
That camp is right above mine! I built under the bridge, right up against where the mountainside and the bridge support meets.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

I have only ever played by myself and have never once been attacked by anyone, not even the guy I accidentally shot.

Looks like someone took a dump in his cornflakes.

Same for me 
---
I do recall reading many threads on the cost being higher than advertised‚Äù. I believe Bethesda is aware. 
---
Yeah but 40K? I believe 4K maybe. Maybe if they've been playing from the start collecting every fusion cell they've come across and never used any. Lol. Or maybe they put on Ammosmith and Super Duper and started with tons of raw materials... My bro uses the Tesla rifle constantly (which is by far the most viable at this point) and he's always having to craft more ammo even though he finds a lot. So I guess it's possible. What do fusion cells weigh without Batteries Included? I forget. I know it's not as heavy as fusion or plasma cores but I can't imagine it's that light either. And with that being said, does it mean he's been carrying all of them around just to make them weigh less while using Batteries Included? ü§î I'm just curious because it feels like that would eat up stash space. Although on that note, it's completely plausible that he's one of the many colorful people that choose not to manage their resources and would rather be hoarders with mule characters created solely for the purpose of carrying things they don't and probably won't ever need üòÅ Hmm, I probably just answered my own question in there somewhere. I overthink too often ü§Øüò≥

if i launch the nuke i‚Äôll do what i damn please 
---
Amen!
---
People have been duping Dev room items and selling them out. It's possible you may have bought a duped dev room item and learned it/used it and it flagged your account. It kinda still goes under the dupe tab so that could be it. If not then IDK man, sadly we'll have to wait till CSS responds. Which i'm sorry man, I work next to severall CSS reps and lemme tell you they do try, they just gotta follow alot of BS before they can do their jobs.

I haven't noticed the photo gallery, but when my son plays before me on his account, when I sign him out and log myself in, my level shows as his when I'm loading in.

If that makes any sense.

Either that that or he's been servwr hopping for twenty uears.

I use my non-explosive shotgun and just tag ghouls. But if people are being dicks and killing everthing with TSEs, I pull out my explosive pump and all the perks and no-one get's a shot in lol

It's ok to be upset because you feel the iPhones you bought is an overpriced piece of junk, but that doesnt mean apple stole your money. It's fine to be upset. Making up bullshit like "dey stole my moneyyyyyyyy" is a different matter

I didn't claim they did, but that they would (twice).  ESO had the same issue where they had to develop tools to fix duping.  It's not an impossible task that people like to think, why it takes to long? Nobody will ever know.

Find a Weapon that gives you a 30% boost in damage to super mutants or ghouls. And if you can find armor that gives you -15% damage from them and grind kills.   I use ghoul armor and shotgun and kill em at whitespring from the window where they cant get you.  
---
There's an equivalent challenge for nearly all weapon types.
---
I'll stick on pc, not as many badass 12 year olds.

Whitesprings‚Äô ghouls did get an XP nerf. The TSEs have a nerf coming, but hasn‚Äôt happened yet. 
---
Adding you now 
---
Most of the QOL mods are so incredibly good that if they ever came out to say we weren't allowed to use them I would most certainly stop playing. It's a completely different game using them (and feels like a more complete game).
---
The part I dont understand is why these weren't in the game in the first place, we shouldn't even need to use mods to have these sort of functions. 
---
If you mean the foundation floor is high up, even max height foundations can be walked up without stairs. Your character and enemies just walk up an invisible ramp.

I'd buy it for 2k; thats about 2 days of vendor caps so its really not that bad

Low level people DO NOT JOIN you ruin the event for everyone else because you give her more health then you can damage. Please unless you have correct weapons do not join.

I got banned for no reason i wasnt duping or exploiting at all yet i get a email responseing saying ive ben duping items in the game like wtf???  
---
I wish my turrets killed molerats and dogs. 
---
And the descriptions for the items are so bad its impossible to know exactly what the BPs will make. Clicking preview on a BP should show you at least the first option for that item set not a preview of some papers that make the BP.

I didn't kill him. He went after the STA missle emplacement and then my turrets targeted him. I don't think the stupid game should have him be targetable by missle emplacements OR my personal workshop turrets but they can

Yep. It has to be intact to craft the grenade.

exactly, i went from a level 30 wanting things to be fair, to a level 200 who ain‚Äôt give a shit. it rlly sucked. why be nice if someone‚Äôs not gonna be nice

It feels like Bethesda has gone completely radio silent again. How fucking hard is it for a community manager to talk to the community just ONCE a week?

Yeah yeah yeah. Even if I was PC you wouldn't add me. üëéüèΩ
---
How many hours played? U.s. timezones?
---
I enjoy it because I enjoy most games.

I can look past the bugs and glitches and just play for fun. I will agree that a chunk of it is just reused stuff from previous games but as long as I enjoy it that's all I'm looking for.
---
Also. Have you ever seen a hobo on crack? They run real fast for about 5 meters.
---
Your allegory is very flawed. Here's a better one: You went to buy a car from a junkyard paying a price of a brand new car. However, the seller at the junkyard told you the car haves several issues and thus isn't new at all, yet you still bought it.
---
you would have to be a moron to assume they would do something like add a defense budget by just splitting what we already had into 2 bars..
---
that would accomplish literally nothing but showing us how much turrets used but in a different spot.
---
No but the patch notes did mention a fix for this.
---
Using mods will get you banned as reported by Bethesda and other players.
---
If you call someone a name three times and say hail cheeseburgers full of grace you get 5,000 points to use towards sex with any anime character on your shelf of your choosing... We got badass and 12yr old so far. 
---
The problem is that this wouldn't work that well with the obscene amount of TSE weapons, since people are probably only duping 3 or 4 at a time and probably moving them to different accounts. I suppose you will get caught eventually, but when you are selling them for 10$ a piece on eBay and a key for the game only costs 9$,you don't really care. 
---
ah, haven't been on and thought it might have been the most recent daily challenge
---
While I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment, it‚Äôs not going to do anything unless you drop the event on your pipboy. Being in the same event means you can‚Äôt harm each other, similar to being on a teamed.

Then there‚Äôs the slap damage issue.

You can always leave it in your stash.

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes

I think they just did it so the more interesting side of rifles (with ejection port and such) are visible in 1st person view of right handed character. It does irritate me a bit.
---
No there isn't but dupers would love that feature.
---
Yeah, put it in your stash like a normal person xD
---
Unless you have 700+ of the same legendary. If that's the case... Enjoy the ban when someone sends the screenshots :)
---
Pacifist should make it so you do no damage to players and players do no damage to you. Pacifist has a cool down. Turning pacifist off has a coutdown. During this countdown you can be killed but you cant kill. Maybe a 3 minutes countdown that is visible with a message above the players head that reads "leaving pacifist" so players around them know that person is about to be able to damage them.
---
Having pacifist on makes it so you can take the different base sites but if anyone not in pacifist wants it they dont even have to contest, its theirs instantly since you cant defend in pacifist. 
---
This would allow those who dont want to PVP ever to stay in pacifist. They can take workshops but they cant defend them from other players. If someone tried to grief by leaving pacific to kill everyone around them would see via a timer above their head that they are about to leave pacifist. 
---
To enter pacifist you must do so before joining a server so that you dont go greif someone then go pacifist.

I should probably buy some nice armour

This is a normal bug. I spent 600 caps moving my low level base when it said 22 caps.
---
Try it and let us know how it turns out.
---
im starting to wonder if every single conversation about gameplay quality (or why do we even try to review games, it feels super ludicrous to apply numeric measurements to what is experiential) is now gonna come all the way down to the philosophical itemization of RPG as a concept, how do we describe what is essentially classic within gameplay systems more complicated than Mario walking forward and jumping over / upon obstacles and foes).
---
Thank you for all the comments. All very helpful and food for thought 
---
Yeah your probably right 
---
Whether or not you have the numbers right the idea of farming one place then going to farm another then hitting the first place again to respawned loot is true. At least for junk. 
---
I‚Äôd be happy if they‚Äôd just fix the current bugs with her. I‚Äôve been down there with just a few people in the zone and been unable to injure her or get her to land. If she did, it would be brief, a second or two before she flew off again.

One glitched run we were able to kill her though. Got stuck flying in place for some reason. High enough for melee guys to not be able to hit, but low enough to take her down with a UC 50. 
---
Idk how you can look past the bugs and glitches. tbh dude. They stripped Fallout 4 game bare and then it's riddled with the worst bugs in a Bethesda game to date. With the bare-bones state that 76 is in, the bugs and the glitches are centre-stage. 
---
A lot of us used to give Bethesda titles a bit of a free pass for bugs and glitches because the worlds they provided to players were quite incredible. And of course, the modding community for Bethesda titles made these games exemplary. That option isn't available in 76. So without a massive modding community to support it and the content in 76 being more shallow than a puddle on the road, I can't just look past the bugs and the glitches. And especially not when they're this prolific and severe in 76.
---
There's plenty to do it's just that all the enemies are over double my level and instantly respawn after clearing an area. Did you read my post? Apparently we had different experiences in the game. 
---
Look up series circuit 
---
No damage on her and also no scaling for those who can't damage.
---
I would hope so unless your build doesn't work or your aim is less than great. So, where is your stuggle then, because I m doing fine without the guns you are using? 
---
I mean technically that's a completely different genre. Mario would be considered platformer. And honestly people HAVE argued how that feels. That's why we have Mario kart and tennis and literally any other type of Mario game that exists.
---
Including a super Mario RPG in multiple forms, which mostly still use the JRPG turn based format....
---
I've been running 15 mods, some since right after release, with no issues.
---
HAven't played the game for awhile now because of that, really shit house it does that.
---
Or make it mission dependent. If you haven‚Äôt gotten to the point you could launch, you can‚Äôt join the event. You can hang out down there, take out adds, whatever, but no event rewards and no effect on the SBQ. 
---
That happened to me last night.. I'll have to try the solution suggested
---
Links from Bethesda please? As I have used and still am using servael mods and i'm perfectly fine. So far the only claims from people who are "using mods" and are being banned are people using CE or people who are using exploits trying to lie through it all

Tonight I have been kicked from the server about 6 times (the last few times my cap was not where it was supposed to, the last time my cap was co platelet gone and I was frozen aka stuck in place yet the game was not frozen sadly this game is becoming more and more broken or having issues not to mention the weight of everything (weapons, Armor, ammo etc), the need for unlimited space (for our  boxes), grievers, etc the game is becoming a lot less fun...
---
The reason I can look past them is I havent encounted any real bad ones. The worst I've encountered would have been when the food processing plant ate my primary weapon that one time. Other than that only time the games bugs anger me is when i disconnect during a nuke lunch.
---
I guess I've just been real lucky with the bugs in this game.
---
So I might just turn off the radio mod to be on the safe side.. Thanks!! Do you use the text chat mod by any chance? 
---
Hmm. I‚Äôll see what happens when I log on in the morning. I‚Äôve got a decent one going right now from hitting workshops to trigger PvP. Had to try it. Gotta admit, it was kinda entertaining.  My character may well turn into a full blown raider. 
---
"Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?"
---
That's what they did with the stored budget people asked for a stored budget and the just made it show how it was used.
---
That was great! Thanks for that!
---
I agree
---
That was the most lag I've ever experienced in this game. Literally unplayable. Seemed like the entire server was in the event
---
Times are hard in wasteland.
---
Stealboy. LOL. That‚Äôs a more appropriate name for it. All I ever used them for in FO:NV. Cleaned out the Silver Rush with it every time. 
---
I guess it‚Äôs just me that has seen a drastic decrease in the amount of times the SB screams at you. After this new patch they seemed to have stopped spamming me altogether. Killed a bunch and have yet to run into this problem again. Guess i‚Äôm just lucky?
---
Banning dupers is a good start but the damage has already been done. Thousands of pieces of OP PvP armor and weaponry that have been unjustly handed out to people who didn't earn them. 
---
I really hope the banned accounts also have all the items they generated disappear so the players who bought duped items get some form of punishment, even if it just means losing some caps or better, their real money.
---
I have been banned for exactly this as well as 2 others when we found a duper and stole their bag of stuff.
---
Currently waiting on an appeal
---
Somewhat useful for xp I guess? Int defines your xp gain rate, but other than that I guess it doesn‚Äôt have much use
---
You are prob right, I do wish for some balance tho and yes some players will have dozens of hours over others and they will def have an advantage for sure. However I'm still excited to too see how things go on the pvp servers/mode!!
---
Y
---
Please can you point me towards the best tips for perks etc that help with surviving a nuked area without PA. Really want to be that guy who rocks up in just a dress and a clown hat. 
---
yeh it happened at a workshop but it was unowned workshop
---
I'd rather just see three server types: Regular (like we have now) , PVP (unrestricted), and non-pvp. If you don't want to get pvp'd at all, you log on the non-pvp server. 
---
Garage door is the Jetpack Power Armor entrance/Exit :P
---
I mean they are pretty left politically lol. Just sayin'
---
Armor pen determines how much of your targets armor is ignored. So if your rifle does 100 damage, has the legendary AA effect (+50% armor pen) and your target has 250 armor, then before their armor reduces the damage of your shot it acts as though the target's armor is 125, which is calculated into the damage taken by your target, effectively increasing your damage per shot.
---
He also mentioned they were multiplicative, not additive. Meaning that AA (+50%), Tank Killer 3 (+36%), and the Perforating Magazine (another +36%) does NOT equal up to 122% armor pen, reducing their armor to a negative number. Instead it reduces the armor of your target by one effect first (not sure in what order so as an example we'll just use the 50% of the AA weapon to begin with) so using the same value of 250 armor the AA effect reduces their armor to 125. Then the next effect happens again reducing their armor to 80 and finally the last effect reduces it even further to 51.2. All of this is calculated with every shot you fire.
---
 I'm not sure how much armor resists how much damage though, so this is the best explaination I can make. Lol
---
If they have an automated system for flagging dupers, there‚Äôs no reason to think it‚Äôs not as buggy as the rest of their products. 
---
I never said they stole people money 
---
Yea you're lucky üòÇ because every time I run into one it's non stop screaming, now I understand the Scorch beast Queen doing that but not normal Scorch beasts like come on now
---
Haha really the only way is to get your hands on an undamaged hazmat suit. Without that or PA, you‚Äôre going to be taking a ton of rads even with RadX/Away and any perks for radiation. You can google suit locations if you don‚Äôt have one already. Good spot is the Emmett mountain disposal locker room, small trailer on top of Poseidon energy plant, nuke silos and there are a lot of others.
---
demo expert works with missile launcher? i thought it was only for grenades..also.what is RNG?
---
The actual special stat itself, has no cap. I‚Äôve had my intelligence several thousand high, and while things like durability eventually caps, the xp gain rate does not have a cap at all. 
---
When I used to run with super high intelligence, I recieved anywhere between 5.000 - 60.000+ xp per kill (depending on enemy level). It caused me to level after every single kill and I‚Äôm now level 935. 
---
The super high intelligence was at the time just a side effect of what my intentions were of what I was doing, but it does unfortunately no longer work. RIP.
---
Here's something you might find interesting.
---
i laughed ten times harder than the both of them just watching this i need a new set of fucking lungs and ribs 
---
Yup. Spot on and I don't blame you. 
---
Only reason I launch them now is for caps and tech data. Do kinda enjoy the silos though, as repetitive as they are. 
---
And yes I know I can get tech data from Whitesprings Bunker Military Desks :)
---
Yes! I like the idea of set bonuses. The only PA set bonus is the excavator 100 to carry capacity. No other armor set has a bonus, which is odd to me that one can have it but the others, nah. Your suggestions are pretty spot on as well. 
---
I think excavator was a new concept and that's why it's different, whereas the others were copy and paste into the code and not really redone. Only made a few adjustments to defenses, skins, and names. 
---
But these ideas are brilliant. 
---
&gt; 80% boring grind. 20% actual gameplay
---
There's a lot more to do at your level than 80% boring grind. If you find the process of leveling boring and grindy you're going to hate "end game". If you're getting high level shit spawning repeatedly it probably means there are higher level players spawning in nearby. 
---
Here's a map someone made: https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc#c0QaSvc
---
If the level of mobs are skewed it's probably because someone higher level is around. Best to hop servers or go somewhere else for a bit. 
---
heh, legendary wood
---
is there mods for ps4?
---
TS is the only thing making Laser Gatlings and LMGs usable. They‚Äôre garbage without it.   Even with TS and a prime receiver, a max level LMG only does ~50 damage. Sure, the DPS is high, but it‚Äôs mostly eaten up by armor as the per-shot damage is still quite low for anything at that level, and it eats through a mountain of ammo to do so. 
---
Friends with Rad Sponge will do it
---
The magnitude of this problem mostly depends on your perks. My perks are all combat, I have nothing that reduces weights. This means I have to spend at least an hour every day sorting my inventory and visiting vendors before I can actually start playing, and even after that I have to track very carefully what I'm picking up.
---
The heaviest section of my inventory by far is Aid, particularly stimpaks, since while I often don't use very many, I still need to keep at least 30 on me for scorchbeast attacks or nuke drops. Add radaway, food, water, and a small collection of chems to that, and suddenly Aid is half the weight I'm carrying. 
---
Please add me I need friends. PSN: Navybluepaint
---
There's builds that don't require TSE. My revolver has neither mod and takes scorchbeasts down in 18 to 24 rounds. People just think that the TSE nerf is so big because a lot of people used it as a "get strong quick" scheme in stead of thinking out builds. 
---
No such thing as a Radiation Miniskirt then? This game continues to disappoint me. Still, rocking up to help out higher level events where everyone is PA'd up to the eyeballs and there's me in my red sequinned number is still pretty satisfying.
---
Uranium glass is a real-world material that could fit with these! It‚Äôs green, and was usually used for fancy glassware.
---
Sounds like you are projecting to me, there's nothing wrong with being badasses or a twelve year old. Would just rather not play with them personally.
---
They prob cant ebay wont let anyone interfere with sales. Maybe if BGS bought all the duped shit then ya. But not without making a sale tbh.
---
Yeah workshops are derpy. If you don't mess with them you'll basically never die to another player in pacifist. Even if you do use workshops I don't imagine other players are much of an issue unless you go fight them. I usually just let them have it because workshops are kind of pointless anyway. Most of the time I have a workshop for the fast travel point. 
---
I've seen a couple nos to this question, but I have 2 pieces of food/chem weight reduction, and it appears to lower the weight by 40% (Stimpaks weigh 0.6). I don't have any other weight-related perks equipped... 
---
Has anyone been able to test more than 2 pieces of food/chem weight armor?
---
Uh, sometimes. 
---
I‚Äôve caught it on its own and took shots at it with a shotgun w/enforcer perk. I could cripple an engine or two and it would still take off like in the OP. I hit it at Whitesprings and by the time I opened my map, it was all the way to Top of the World (where it got stuck on the roof after being crippled again). 
---
When I first noticed this bug, I assumed it was because I was kinda poaching it (I didn‚Äôt have the marker, just a chance encounter). Turns out that‚Äôs irrelevant. 
---
it also only gives 2x background, banana's give off more radiation then it. MY school had some in their science lab for testing the geiger counters. 
---
(Insert griefer pvp story)
---
I needed some of that lucky charm you've got when I was playing. i got the damage bug so often and that infuriated me to no end, disconnecting from the server was a frequent occurrence. I mean there's still bugs in 76 which have been around since fuckin' Morrowind. I have no idea how you haven't encountered any real bad ones, but i envy you for that. Though the constant onslaught of minor bugs did infuriate me as well.
---
Hey non PA armor is better that PA in pretty much all stats but radiation. I don‚Äôt use PA unless it‚Äôs a prime nuke for the most part. Keep up the unique approach! I like to see players like you mixing it up. Like you said, everyone is in PA. 
---
The face in the heart is my fav
---
Is this going to be a continued cycle or will new content actually arise. Stay tuned listeners. üôÑ 
---
AFAIK you can only stack the same kinds of bobblehead and I do not know if magazines replace the bobblehead, but I would assume they don't. But don't take my word for it, BGS is great for having things not make any sense. (Like bobbleheads stacking in the first place)
---
So you don't own the game??
---
That‚Äôs Bobblehead stacks, not TSE. Try again.
---
Don't forget the REDRUM on the wooden blocks.
---
&gt;You were supposed to bring BALANCE to the wasteland! Not leave it in darkness!
---
I am racking my brain to remember which movie I've heard this quote from? Please put me out of my misery. And yes, the misery persists in the flimsy servers. Worst it's ever been.
---
I wouldn't mind the grind as much were it rewarded with decent gameplay. Like I said, there's plenty to do at level 20, but every questline I get becomes impossibly difficult due to enemy level and respawn times. I even check the map to make sure no high level players are nearby. Did you encounter anything similar in your playthrough? 
---
You can transfer items between your own characters, by placing the item into a container in a world, re-joining off of someone else to get back to the same server, and then returning to the same container with a different character.
---
Still a complete pain though and carries some risks.
---
It might be time to put the tinfoil hat back in the stash box and take a break.
---
I check this sub at least once a day and this is the first I've heard of this vendor. 
---
Lol of course I do, u know what i meant, don‚Äôt act dumb üòÜ 
---
I'm thinkin I read wrong,  guessing you have it but you mean you are not BGS so you dont own fo76??
---
Agreed. I like that BGS called em out. 
---
Hmmm that's good to know. I'll try to get my int up as high as possible next time I'm trying to get some levels. Thanks.
---
Definitely looks like a PVP map.
---
While I get the idea of your post, there‚Äôs no way to implement this well. People may have unknowingly traded for items that were duped and it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be fair for them to lose their items.
---
Maybe 500 Atoms or a nylon bag would be a good compensation if they took the items away.
---
Haven‚Äôt found one yet. They‚Äôre protected scrap though aren‚Äôt they?  Maybe they‚Äôre planning on a way to repair them. 
---
Same.
---
You know what is even more simple? Name it ".50 rifle" or ".50 sniper". Who knows what in the world a 400 blackout is and why do I need to craft it for my .50 Cal sniper?
---
U gotta get into JustWorksQASmoke for them sweet customization

Didn't think of that, thank you. I'd even settle for shared caps cap on account - that would basically solve my problem.

If this game taught me one thing, don‚Äôt lug useless stuff.

Has Bethesda developers ever tried running up a mountain? I mean this stam regen is fucking ridiculous. On top of they have they ever really tried to go to sleep? No one falls asleep that fast. Have they ever tried to carry 235 pounds all day and night? So unrealistic.    /s

Oh you mean like how my Automatic Scattered Laser Rifle melts in my hands after firing a single clip more often and faster than my M&amp;M's do?
---
Its PA..that's your  first person helmet hud.. it been in fallout since fallout 1... it will never go away it is part of fallout nostalgia and aesthetic. 
---
Not much but I played from the beginning when there weren't high level people running all over the map messing with the spawn levels. I was also melee which is a faceroll to begin with. Also the quests are stupid and take you to higher level places before sending you back to lower level ones again. It's a bit messy but you get used to where things are.

that still call stealing money
---
Put all of your scrap into your stash, I think it's a bug with using resources from inventories and stashes at the same time
---
Do people still say that?
---
It's one of those things where if you play solo you're going to have a hard and risky time trying to transfer items to an alt. While people who have a trusted friend who plays can easily transfer stuff to mule characters. I have stuff I don't want to sell or drop. It might turn out to be pretty good stuff, especially after the nerfs. I've been keeping a bunch of anti-armor legendaries. Nothing special but a few good ones. Some other bits and pieces that most people would probably just drop in a bag. A shared stash would let me actually play the game a little more. And I have a feeling all the legendaries I carry around with me could be the cause of some of the crashes I experience also. If I could just give  some of the weapons and armor I've been collecting to an alt I could really enjoy the game a lot more.
---
 No bbn I get it now after reading mybad lol!!
---
Can't blame them. One of the worst companies to be running community relations for right now. I wonder if Bethesda is just trying to drive them to suicide, and all of the upper management has a pool going on how long it'll take.
---
I found The Lusty Assaultron Maid - [https://clyp.it/kqlwrbri](https://clyp.it/kqlwrbri)
---
I have three separate characters 
---
Cassandra: A rugged raider apart of the Gourmands with a slight buffout addiction.. She can whip up and amazing meal but it may contain those she's slain. She wields mainly shotguns and has learned quite a few ways to trick them out. 
---
Dr. Sanchez: Everyone's favorite of the wasteland. She's a medic with the sole purpose of saving those trying to rid the wasteland of scorched. The only thing that gets in the way is her crazy alcoholism, sometimes she even uses to alcohol to revive players! 
---
Scarlet: Apart of vault 76 as one of the many members to rebuild the wasteland. Scarlet had the tastes of a bit more lavish life and to put her knowledge to the test though. She currently resides outside of whitesprings in a safe brick house and fancy interior. She has become a master of all trades and spends her days learning as many new plans and modifications that she can. Her brahmin Sally is her only true companion in these wastes. 
---
I don't think you get it man. 
---
For people like him complaining about 76 on Reddit IS playing FO76. 
---
Reminder: In the past few years no one was able to buy finished or polished games at release. 
---
So can you have more then one pet ? Could you just get as many as you want so long as you have budget in your camp ?

All it does is cede power to the bureaucrats.

A **massively multiplayer online game** (**MMOG**, or more commonly, **MMO**) is an [online game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game) with large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game#cite_note-1)\[[*not in citation given*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)\] MMOs usually feature a huge, [persistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_world) [open world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world), although some games differ. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer), [video game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console), or [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone) and other mobile devices.
---
MMOs can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many [video game genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre). 
---
Just because the servers only hold 24 people at a time doesn't make it not a MMO.
---
Serums players are selling aren't usually duped. The recipes can drop from the queen and they don't take much to craft. Not much else to do with all the flux late game after all your armor is set.
---
I crash every time I go into a whitesprings nuke. Guaranteed
---
Im not dum
---
Fallout 76 bans are alot like Prison....
---
Miraculously every person who tells their story is innocent.

I also did some work on this subject. The damage bonus is a curve based on how much Dr your target has. I tested with high Dr, and anti armor legendary and regular.

Some enemies are crippled by armor penetration like the sbq. Others, not so much.
---
Trust me, a proper system would be league's better. Trying to transfer things among 5 characters becomes quite time consuming, and a few times I've had oh crap moments where I joined someone who left to another server, and my back up went offline. 3+ joinable people is key.
---
U still selling? 
---
Vendor's reset 20 hours after you use each one, it's tied to your account so no amount of server hopping will change that.

"Plan: High Tech Table"

Oh, that should be cool.  I mean, a high tech table sounds sweet.

---
Great move!! No offense the the pve ppl BUT US PVP PLAYERS WANT THIS AND ITS OUR GAME TOO.. empty servers??? I cant join my teams map often due to server population. I understand the single player appeal to fallout as that's where it started over 25 years ago. But its 2019 and fallout had to change to survive. And fo76 is the ticket once BGS figures it out. Give em time they get it right I hope!!
---
Yeah. And amazingly out of all those people....
---
They are all innocent.....
---
Amazing how much duping was happening and yet now that there's bans no one was duping.
---
No, I agree with you 100%. My alts are only holding caps for me, but still, a seamless way to transfer stuff is just needed.
---
I have 10% stored, nothing in stored tab because it's my dead and missing Mega Sloth I tamed. The 10% stacks every time you move the camp.
---
I'd just like them to fix the game, before making any additions. Not hating on it, it's just frustrating to play at times.
---
No they aren't. They are literally putting BGS IP up for sale. 
---
When I first found one I was like: THIS is my weapon of choice from now on
---
When I first tried it: yupp, never using that again
---
The damage it does is miserable...
---
I have just one fried who plays as well, but naturally can't rely on him being online at any time I might need it. 
---
Beth can't see player's inventory they said  
---
Beth won't ban cheaters they said  
---
Beth won't "hurt their playerbase" they said  
---
Well they are not saying this anymore. Well done, Bethesda, better late than never. 
---
Thanks man! See you out there sometime.
---
Except one of those people is violating the ToS and the other isn't.
---
Naa i wouldn't have got anything that i know wasnt suppose to be already in game. But at this point i don't know. You try and do your best and still get banned so... who knows. Meanwhile you got people still open about duping and selling stuff on sites for cash with no issues at all. 
---
Wow I thought my [friend's](https://imgur.com/a/sn6CsuO) PA is sexy but you got him beat by a mile
---
So your saying every single person that was banned was in fact duping?
---
I'm always curious when I see certain shades of green glass at antique shops. It makes me want to carry a [UV light](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/9zawns/i_came_across_a_shop_selling_vaseline_glass_that/) with me.
---
I'll never stop upvoting topics like this because otherwise they might think we dealt with it. 
---
Yea im on xbox.
---
Sorry but no. Weapon weight is a real issue everything weighs too much and it needs to be fixed. Just like they did with bobby pins when they realized that they made them too heavy.
---
Just because a game has fantasy elements doesn't mean that you can't use real world examples to enforce points about an issue.
---
Or would you prefer that in Skyrim all Iron daggers weighed 50 million pounds because dragons also exist in that world and Dragons aren't real so nothing needs to be realistic.
---
Yes. Very few people got their item to drop...
---
Because it has a low drop rate. Because it's a high end item. 
---
The people who bought them for money? They violated the ToS and I hope they get the fuck banned out of them
---
Bethesda: we want you to go out, team up and reclaim the wasteland, oh, and kill each other for junk.
---
Ohio too
---
Violating ToS that you agreed to is literally the definition of dishonest. 
---
Yeah I'd rather actually have my weapons displayed on my character.
---
Since these weapons are based on real life version somewhat they should weigh appropriately.

I defend it because for me, it hasn't been a big buggy mess. I don't get DCd. I don't try to run 76 on my PoS PC using WiFi I'm stealing from my neighbor.

Maybe some daily events that are more rewarding some single and some team based same for weeklys as well.(endgame events that are tougher then base game events and only available at endgame like scorched queen but maybe moth man,flatwoods monster ect)
---
Better challenges, taking photos in front of train stations or crafing 5 lights in camp are just to cheesy. (most people have there camps set up the way thay like them)
---
No charge of caps to fast travel to events,paying thirty caps to get to the event then getting twenty four caps as a reward just blows.
---
Just a thought for pvp(i know i know just here me out) team death match where you have the option to select from main menu and its a section of the map for example west tek 4v4 same for deathmatch 8 player matches where you have the option to play different modes like all players are equal in one mode and another where you play how your character is(a heap of games do this i know fallout is not like other games befor you all tear me a new one just putting it out there)
---
Fractions would be good with a fraction leveling system and rewards for said fraction could also be good for pvp one fraction v other?
---
Thats all i can think of at the moment..
---
This was suggested since Release of the game and I dont know if Bethesda ever replied to such a plea. Dont know if this will ever come
---
Having a camp near whitesprings has other problems too. Namely a pack of lvl 62 ghouls, when your only lvl 22.
---
Why did I move here toddamit.
---
Gotten worse for me. They didnt fix anything just made it worse
---
You get a code if you buy the PC version from a 3rd party like retail. Someone got me 76 for Christmas and inside the dvd case was just a piece of cardboard with the code.
---
Bad reference for me cause I don't play the ES series, but I understand your point.  Here's the problem though, whats the limit? Where does the line go? Carry weight will always be a touchy thing, no matter if it was lower or not.
---
Yes please. Also inspect should show what the plan is for, like for real and not just a document. While we are at it, also have inspect show what do mods do in PA, armor and weapons
---
 Yes indeed. Its the "Cooking Stove" plan. 
---
I played for 4 hours last night and had to restart about 6 times from loading screens, 3 crashes and 2 dashboards. x1x
---
Really? Seems like a weak response. 
---
These people have already reaped the benefit and will be let off if they just stop. 
---
Christ they annoy me so much whenever I tried to do the fire breathers physical exam I constantly got chased by 8 of them (I mean Ik there weak and) and then a snallygaster spawned and I got sandwiched between the two, and had to do it again.
---
TL;DR molerats are annoying as hell and only ever spawn at bad times.
---
They still haven‚Äôt fixed this bug? This game I swear, is beyond repair, it exsists since 4 years ago for fucks sake Bethesda, your fuckinh programmers are clueless and you don‚Äôt have any care for your products, abandon them as soon as you could!
---
If you store floor with a turret on it, it should just get stored as a plan, if you place that plan the turret should be there.
---
There's a website that tells you all the nuke codes

youre on a console I guess
---
This is really awesome! Good Job man. Thanks for sharing this. :)
---
Right??? So good! (My partner is the main photographer - he‚Äôs so good at it!) 
---
I saw the same, almost made me wanna reroll a stealthy sniper.
---
HE-MAN!!!
---
i am Xb1, but go to Map, then hit LB or your key to get to the menu and then you should see something called challenes. Its the main menu when you login but after you login. Try do your daily and weekly challenges. Dailies need to be done each day, weekly you have 7 days to complete, most of them are pretty easy, some are tedious.
---
I don't use the text chat. I only use voice chat in game or Discord with friends sometimes. I was going to try out text chat, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
---
Same but I use forced smile and the harlequin paint 
---
Exactly. Even mods like better inventory are really good. Honestly they could just look at the 76 nexus page to see what QOL stuff people have already made. That said, I love the fact that we even can mod the game. Its a huge factor for me in games I play. SW:TOR had no macros and you couldn't mod it. If it had a clunky system you had to live with it. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear that the lack of this feature is why almost no one takes workshops in the late game. I love them in theory, but having all your worked wiped with no chance of reconnecting feels terrible.
---
I wanted one for a long time. Just got it off the Grafton Railroad vendor two days ago 
---
Or they can make restoring you camp free if it was damaged by players and not by NPC.
---
I bought every raider underarmor lining plan from the vendors save shielded. Then, after completing the first mission for Rose, I got the shielded plan as a quest reward.    
---
    
---
About the same experience with the BoS linings, I had bought the first three from vendors then randomly received the last one from the technical data turn-in.
---
I generally thank kind Appalachian dwellers for providing access to their C.A.M.P. facilities by leaving some kind of gift for them.
---
I left just such an assaultron head for someone only yesterday.
---
Hope they‚Äôre enjoying it!
---
Yes. Because you asking a question you've already come to a conclusion about on Reddit is going to "save TES"
---
"HeY IdioTz. 76 is trash. Tell me Y you like it so I can call you dumb"
---
I hope they ruin TES. Just for you. I love TES, but if it makes you so butt hurt, ai hope to fuck that happens. 
---
Also, real Atheists don't debate creationsim. Real Atheists don't befrudge others for their faith or feel the need to prove them wrong. 
---
No, just the original wallpaper on the background.
---
Read the end of my post, you illiterate spastic.
---
 I'm actually looking for the keycards you use before punching in the code. Thanks anyway :)
---
It has, for me at least. The performance hiccups might not sound that annoying, but when you're actually playing, you realise how aggravating it is.
---
Works for me. 
---
It was a typo but fuck it... I like it better. 
---
Get a shotgun, mod for range/accuracy, equip Enforcer, shoot wings. 
---
Additionally use Padded or Dense on your chest. The sonic attack is explosive damage. Or the newly changed Fireproof.
---
Its meant to be a mutated flying bat. Why the hell would it want to land if it can murder you from the sky.
---
Nearly 300 bugs were patched in just 2 of the major updates. 
---
Also, this game is barely 3 months old, and we're crying about no new content?
---
They have the same effect has for example shotguns or melee. 
---
Sniper rifles are good to clear surroundings of buildings or shot enemies from afar, but when you get inside a building or mine, sniper rifles although can be used from short distances, they clearly loose in damage effect to melee of shotgun.
---
Example: clear the surroundings of wes tek from the top of the cliff with a sniper. But when you inside the building you may want to have a good combat shotgun (possibly the best gun in the game).
---
Don‚Äôt have to run that far.  Just step onto the first red ridge where the  downed power line is.  
---
congratulation, where and how did you get that tse handmade?
---
Glad I'm not the only one having this issue.
---
It's virtually unplayable for me too, like you can't NOT notice it the more you play, and can be detrimental in ways like when you click to shoot, and the game ignores doesn't register it if you clicked during the short FPS drop.
---
Fucking bethesda, wanted to play a little after giving up the game. *Literally 15 seconds in game while looting some mobs* disconnected from server. Game is damn unolayable
---
This post was a complete waste of time.
---
You asked a question so you could tell people how dumb they are for disagreeing with you.
---
nah
---
Yeah, make the unnecessarily long, boss fight even longer. That sounds like a fun solution. 
---
Of all the...damn, it worked! You're awesome!
---
Wait, why have they still not fixed the limb issue.
---
If you are part of a team and that member or others are still in the game world you can rejoin the same server. That‚Äôs a solution to worrying about DC and fighting in nuke zones. 
---
I do agree with you. There should be an option to joining the previous game world or try another that is more stable if the laters stability caused the disconnect. 
---
Haven't we all been so called 'noobs' (how I hate that word) at some point?
---
Why not let everyone play and have fun the way they want? I mean, it's not that anything is depending on you killing the queen, is it?
---
It's an open world/game so we/you/everyone have to deal with one or another annoyance all the time. So what? The next queen will come. Eventually. 
---
Yep that was my thoughts when I first saw it as well. 
---
Is this a new industry developing?
---
I'm not sure I can help. I stood around in mine last night trying to think of some improvements and ended up just putting an instrument on the balcony.
---
You can craft it for free at the ammo factory
---
Image is most definitely NOT a joke!! ;)  
---
I'm usually not a collector/completionist, but since installing the [Known Plans mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214), I've easily been having 5x more fun in-game just collecting plans without needing to consult any spreadsheets. This is needed in the game so bad.
---
They weigh almost nothing. I also use the Tesla Rifle all of the time, and even so i have 2k fusion cells, never once crafted some. And ive played only perhaps 50 hours or so.
---
Also, who in his right mind would dupe Fusion Cells?
---
Yes because dupers surely would dupe fusion cells, the most ubiquitous ammo next to 0.38. I use a Tesla Rifle all the time and still drown in them.
---
It‚Äôs indeed odd, I shoot lefty irl but I‚Äôm such a minority it‚Äôs out of place. I presume it‚Äôs to make it look better in game
---
Relatively new to the game and discarded my syringer after Rose's quest. How/Where do you get vox syringes please? That sounds awesome. I love when the vendor bots talk smack.
---
1 single click and the cost of minor resources and your entire camp is magically and fully restored.  If they spent 12 orbital strikes to blow up your base, then you‚Äôre really the winner of that fight.  
---
No problem
---
because im looking for plans i dont have, and not having fun playing the dumpster fire
---
Ah yes everyones fav part of any game, inventory managment ¬¨¬¨ 
---
Don‚Äôt forget grenadier. Greater radius of explosions. 
---
I'm pretty sure I was one shorted the other day? I was just chilling picking flowers then BANG dead
---
So only put 49,999 stims in lol
---
Seriously, if you don't have anything intelligent to offer, kindly go stick your dick in a blender. When you can offer something more substantive than bullshit assertions, then I'll pay you more attention.
---
Since the last patch, I've had a drastic decline in disconnects. Have started claiming workshops again because of it. 
---
Yes there is a difference, what?
---
The entire semantics of the saying is grounded in reality.
---
FO isn't real life. The work you put in FO doesn't directly correlate to real life. The work you do to function IRL shouldn't and doesn't translate to FO.
---
Secondly, work and crime aren't exactly equal either. Someone working an 8 hour job for the same pay as someone selling meth on the street has the crucial difference of legally being allowed to keep the money. 
---
This is like saying someone who stole your wallet should not be punished because the effort they took to mug you, for you see, *time is money, and they took the time to mug you.* 
---
Also thirdly it isn't legal, so there's like, more than one perspective that criminalizes this. 
---
Hell I could go on but it's like 5am bro. 
---
I know but i don't have materials to do that and i need lots of ammo so I'm asking if anyone want to sell but there ain't many people who wants to sell some 
---
If they didn't consolidate servers during off-hours then you'd have a lot fewer players per server, not enough to kill the SBQ.
---
I feel like the "weight" is meant to reflect overall carryability, and there isn't supposed to be an actual ratio to real world pounds. A longer rifle has a high encumberance because its that, a big long rifle. 
---
With a red tricycle next to them. 
---
One flew the cuckoo's nest!! I found it can you??
---
Well, wouldn't that be a cripplingly brutal splash of realism...
---
This is the type of shitpost I like to see. Have your upvote sir.
---
Then don't go after the bounty. No one is forcing you.
---
Smells like bitch in here
---
So God damn pretty ashamed the game is fucking useleas
---
Yes on ps4
---
Just power up the Monoga power plant and you won't really need much in the way of resources, plus there's a junk extractor to help replenish what you do use. Its a fun workshop imo.
---
I had a weird moment of zen the other day about this - was headed from Fort Defiance up towards the Whitespring and three Scorchies (two lvl 50s and a lvl 80) flew in out of nowhere and just started wrecking my shit with their screaming. About ten stimpaks and a whole lot of pointless strafing later, I was really getting angry and sick of the whole encounter and started questioning why they were all just bombarding me with screams constantly when I suddenly had a thought:
---
*They're BATS. They're echo-locating me. This is what they do. What must it be like to hurt something just by trying to look at it?*
---
As if on cue, the screaming stopped. One of the level 50s chose that moment to swoop down, land on the ground, turn straight to look at me - and just stand there, staring at me in a silence somehow more deafening than the screams. As if it somehow got its own version of the same thought that gave me pause, as if it had suddenly gleaned the same general point from its own plague-ridden perspective.
---
I approached slowly, deliberately.  The beast remained still, tepidly considering me. Its brothers were distracted for the moment by a clutch of Super Mutants on a nearby ridge, shouting them into bloody oblivion while we considered this strange development between us.  I got up to an arm's length from the beast, and for a moment regarded its warped, misshapen figure - how despite the horror of a world forever scorched, despite the genetic twisting and carving that created this *thing* from a simple fruit bat, there could still be that rare moment in this world where man and nature lock eyes and, if but for a moment, simply *understand*.
---
I then pulled out my Super Sledge and brained the bugger across the highway. Its brothers got the same a while later.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is: Bethesda plz add Scorchbeast mounted head trophies to CAMP
---
Did you finish Belly of the Beast?
---
Agree 100%.  I've got a small pathetic shack with 3 walls and half a roof and my budget is full so I can't do anything else. Then I see photos of other players' mansions, I just don't get it.  
---
Pics or it didn't happen 
---
So you're basically saying like "Hey FO76 Is shit and I must tell the world." Like if you hate the game so much why must you tell the world? That's said, self opiniated. Yeah sure I hate Fornite but don't go on spreading hate like a cry baby. Geesh. Grow a pair will you. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to balance because earlier today I couldn‚Äôt even get a shot in before she died, I was there when she jumped out of the pit and she died in what must have been seconds it was crazy. Everyone having there TSE combat shotguns smh
---
I read that in Samuel L Jackson‚Äôs voice. 
---
Either that, or Bethesda could just reduce/eliminate the visual distortion effect so you can shoot back while they are spamming that crap!
---
I would love to see this build. Please. I just want to sleep in my camp with peace and quiet
---
This has been a thing since beta
---
I think this is a good idea. Dont fight with a scorchbeast if you dont have at least 20 stims otherwise you will simply just dir.
---
I'd say it works similar to weight reduction affixes and perks
---
Perk gets the initial proc. Then the legendary affix procs off of that so 25%/2 for the anti-armour affix = 82.5% armour ignored
---
though I haven't personally tested this and this is just based on the weight reduction affixes
---
Come on man, just one more hit of that good stuff and we‚Äôll never bother you again, I promise ;)
---
Excellent post. 0.0002 out of 100. 
---
Glad you took the time.
---
There‚Äôs far too many spelling mistakes from this supposedly AAA studio. ‚ÄúShoguns‚Äù, ‚ÄúTechncial‚Äù, ‚ÄúPasssword‚Äù

Usually bait is witty but this is just long-winded and kind of stupid.
---
Why are you even trying to validate yourself to "look reasonable" at the end lol? You just come off as a hostile douche hat telling everyone they eat shit and love it.
---
Its a survival lite. If it's too complex for you to understand it's merits and pandering base even with that on *top* of fallouts brand name, idk what else to tell ya man. 
---
Todd clones -Gary approves 
---
Yep, just realized it says PA chassis and not ultracite PA, is it the standard reward ?
---
quick tip Ghoulish works both in combat and out of it so if you have a few rads you can hide and regen or regen while you fight
---
This happens for a lot of games. Google a fix.
---
Yep! 
---
Amazing how you could "wipe the floor" with him on information...
---
But can't seem to properly take advantage of spell check...
---
I love when people wax intellectual. "I'm so smart. Allow me to prove it by flexing my high school graduate vocabulary and diction" 
---
Yet they can't properly punctuate. Or have poor grammar. Or can't figure out how to start a sentence with a capital letter, even if it's the word "I" which is by default a capital letter. Or use a question mark. Or use "are" where they should have used "is". 
---
Or how they imply they are some kind of science buff, while confusing asking people a question ("why are people masochistic?") with an experiment. I'd think someone who was challenging someone to a random science trivia contest? Would know the difference between a question and an experiment.
---
If you're going to go the "I'm going to use my vocabulary in a condescending way" route.... Maybe try to make sure your entire post reflects that. The sloppy, half assed everything else sort of undermines it. 
---
I think they should eat dupers.  Then they would crash-land. Boom.
---
There‚Äôs plenty of resources in and around the area, all you really need to run the machine is 20 power. The only downside is other players will likely try and claim it from you if they see someone‚Äôs up there on the map
---
Nice build! Where abouts is this one on the map so I can look out for ya?
---
Ok thanks ! I'll delete my post
---
I love these suggestions especially the battle of one but I think it would absolutely murder the servers lmao 
---
I'm with you to an extent, I've bought all the fallouts at launch and 3 was probably the smoothest (discounting 1&amp;2 of course).  NV I knew what to expect in terms of bugs at least, and compared with 3 it felt far less on rails to me (at launch at least).
---
It was good enough that I enjoyed it, but not so good that I've been back post the DLC additions (though I did buy them).  I keep meaning to.  In your opinion, post DLC, is it in fact the "best fallout game ever"?
---
Lots of posts about this today. I suspect they‚Äôre just having worse than usual server issues today. 
---
Agreed. Also, it's pointless firing up a power station because you don't get to take advantage of it at the workshops for long enough before being disconnected. Of course, the real solution would be to stop the disconnection, but being able to reconnect would be a start.
---
You picked a bad time to come back. Lots of posts about server issues today. It‚Äôs worse than usual. 
---
Slap damage is negated by bobblehead exploit
---
There is no trying to avoid. If they‚Äôre blocked they can‚Äôt be put on the same server as you. 
---
West of grafton dam
---
You can avoid this by storing all but 1 of the ammo for it, firing it, then taking it back out and reloading. 
---
I wouldn't bother, but there is a workaround to make it usable. 
---
You don't seem to understand the fact that you can add whatever caveats to anything you write to attempt to disguise the motive behind it. 
---
A good hint on the radio is to turn the volume to zero. The rest of the sound still plays as normal but no music ever plays even when you turn the radio off in game. Then use a Spotify playlist and play it in the background. There are tons of premade fallout playlists or really you could do whatever floats your boat.
---
Personally I keep the current radio on but sound level of like 10 so that I just kinda hear it in the background every once in awhile.
---
THE CUCKOO CLOCK! I took a picture of it the first time I saw it because I absolutely loved it and wasn‚Äôt sure if it was something I could craft!!
---
My camp is near Charleston station, I hope I can find the vendor one day.
---
No. Just amazing how no one is duping...
---
I put down a portapotty and stuck a whitespring bust in... It's the one that looks like jfk and his head is just perfectly sticking out.... Then I put a poster on the back wall that says HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR MEDICATION?
---
Also I flamingo bombed the area for good measure. 
---
Anyone who uses my toilet is in for a show lol
---
Nice no true scotsman fallacy. I don't understand this subreddit. Why not point out and discuss flaws so they can be addressed and fixed instead of the constant shilling?
---
"reee people are mean to me on a videogame so that justifies me being an asshole"
---
I respect your opinion but i disagree entirely with that statement, tse weapons are on a totally different damage output threshold compared to any other weapon, nobody is going to sell you a ghoul slayers minigun when a tse pipe rifle can deal more damage per second lol. My build is fulky specced in heavy weapons and i had to actually buy a tse harpoon gun just to protect my character from griefers, one shots them no problem.  All of my other heavy guns lvl 50 legendaries do nowhere near that much damage. 
---
Really? I haven't played many games recently but most of them were playable on release.
---
But even then, other companies crimes don't absolve this one. 
---
I bought it and though it covered multiple guns 
---
Well, this post has nothing to do with discussing or fixing the game's flaws. 
---
There are many other posts that do that very thing. That however was clearly not the OPs intention
---
This is probably why it's best to have fissure site prime on the edge and fight her from outside the blast zone. You get less crashes and disconnects (still plenty).
---
No it literally isn't. 
---
The weapons and device can be built by someone who's completed it and can build them slightly better for you at a higher level. If your on Xbox lmk and ill get them remade for you as they're not expensive 
---
I gave up and decided to just invest in every perk related to regenerating AP, reducing AP use, etc. It's a lot easier and more enjoyable to embrace the overencumbered lifestyle fully than to embrace constant inventory management...
---
You‚Äôre right, normally I don‚Äôt really have any issues but today was a challenge.
---
Your camp can get destroyed by monsters while you're away if a player is in the area to keep them loaded. My base is near a train station and often gets attacked by mobs. It's cheap to repair for a reason. 
---
There are strangler scorched enemies. All kinds of fun going down in that swamp.
---
Would you also like a difficulty slider?
---
It would be "Try to defend" not "try and"
---
For a guy trying so hard to be condescendingly intelligent, you sure are sloppy. 
---
Do that. Still happens when I do that
---
We had two teams trying to run Silo Charlie tonight. Entire world crashed.
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
You're doing it wrong if you're going to nerf the two-shot explosive weapons because this will not solve the problem of having over powered players. You have to stop the stacking of explosive bobbleheads to solve the issue and not reduce the power of two shot explosives (tse).
---
You see, a TSE does a base damage of around 200. It can go up to 6-700 with maxed perk cards, which is quite reasonably within limits.
---
The real problem arises when players eat (stack) a lot of explosive bobbleheads thus bringing up the damage to like an unrealistic 20,000 and I heard they apparently also skip servers so that the timer resets or something.  
---
By nerfing TSE's this problem will not be solved because instead of eating say 50 bobbleheads players will eat 150 or 250 of them, which is not an issue for them since apparently duping is still going on.  
---
So PLEASE, do not nerf TSE's but solve the explosive bobblehead stacking instead!  
---

Legendary drops. It makes more sense to have 1\* enemies drop 1\* loot, 2\* enemies drop 2\* loot and 3\* enemies drop 3\* loot.  
---
Plans - it's better if plans &amp; recipes we already know are tagged while trading. There's already a mod on Nexus which fixed this but I'd rather not use mods.  
---
Some protectrons at Watoga explode when killed?  
---
Certain camp items don't work well. For example:   
---
The Neon signs clip into the steel walls.   
---
I couldn't place resort planters on the floor where there was the other planter before, it said there was no support.   
---
Also I can hang pictures on steel walls but not the Whitespring resort pictures.   
---
I can't place a decontamination arch on the ground floor because it skips up on the roof.
---
Getting out of the camp when they close a locked door on you is one reason. 
---
Well if if used 400 blackout ammo, you wouldn't call it a .50 sniper now would you? 
---
But sniper vs MG might be less confusing. I'm fairly certain an IRL Barret shoots 50 BMG for simplicity sake right?
---
most of us (myself included) have given Bethesda a pass on bugfs and gltiches, but 76 was the one whiooch broke the probverbial back. You want to know why? Because there's no bloody content to it! The "story-line" consists of listening to a bunch of holo-tapes, They've asset-flipped a fair amount from Fallout 4, PVP implementation is brain-dead (not to mention, it doesn't even make sense story-wise), you regularly can't shoot enemies in a fucking **fps game**, it crashes constantly, AI is reminiscent of Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder
---
Modding communities have worked tirelessly to fix Bethesda's broken fucking games (USLEP read like a bloody novel), and yet despite all of that, Bethesda thinks it's all fine and dandy to just copy and paste stuff from their previous games and build a new game off that. That is what caused 76. It. Doesn't. Fucking. Work. There are bugs in 76 which were in Fallout 4 from 3 bloody years ago. There's **still** glitches in 76 from Morrowind! Fucking **Morrowind**!
---
I'm telling the world, because I'm over idiots defending a broken as piece of shit game. Their stupidity negatively affects me and every other person out there, because Bethesda will see this rubbish and go "hey, it's all good. People still think our glitches are cute." 
---
Because of 76, I am dreading the release of TES: VI. That is not something that should happen. I shouldn't be dreading the release of a beloved franchise, so you can piss off with your claim that I should grow a pair. Unlike you, I'm not pleased about Bethesda taking a steaming shit on my chest and then calling it Christmas. And unlike you, I don't exactly feel the need to zip my mouth whilst a Bethesda fucks me with a 6 meter long pole!
---
Trade menu sucks, but at least you don‚Äôt have to worry about losing stuff. 
---
Clunky statement. 
---
It reads significantly better as 
---
"...up your own ass would also be enjoyable"
---
"...too then" sounds dumb.
---
That's exactly right.
---
Prove they bought it for money. Prove someone didn't message them on discord and offer them it for free. Nobody agreed to any ToS. They can flash up anything and you will mindlessly click it. Did you promise your first born to Rumpelstiltskin? Who knows? That stuff gets thrown out in a real court. And you can hope for all you want, but Bethesda and their shareholders are in the business of making money, not appeasing spiteful idiots. But sure if they want a large part of their playerbase to never buy another one of their games again, and forever spread bad word of mouth, maybe you have a good plan.
---
When I posted saying they needed to delay the patch release to consoles I got downvoted, yet here we are
---
I have never had this happen
---
I'm calling bs.
---
Then there's nothing else to be done except only launch when you have a team member so you can join back in when you crash
---
When all you can do is point out my spelling and grammatical errors, that's scraping the bottom of the barrel. You have no arguments. You're a joke. Fuck off.
---
That is awesome hahaha XD Ive been thinking about redoing my whole camp and disguising it as a public restroom, i think players would get a good laugh out of it. Maybe rig the powered door with only one pressure plate to allow them to enter freely and let it slam shut after they go inside with no way out. stick a few traps in some of the stalls with powered speakers everywhere lol.
---
Maybe it's just the difference between systems then.  It is a handy feature on XBox. 
---
&gt;, if i add the mods to drop weight they actually weigh more, so i just shoved deep pockets on them.
---
That depends. Weightless armor with lighter build usually weights quite less than just the weightless. 
---
Most of my weighless armor in stash weight 0. All of them together might weight like 0.1 total.(about 10 pieces)
---
I think in your case the extra weight comes from the base mod. Lighter build mod should always drop the weight.
---
I read that in Gandalf's voice, talking to Gollum. 
---
The fix is "switch batteries or make sure your controller stays plugged in". In other words, there isn't a way to fix the underlying problem.
---
A couple of other games seem to have the same issue, but it's not very widespread and personally it hasn't affected any of the other 100+ PC games I've played over the years.
---
No. The only way I know to have mods in fallout on console is if they're built in. They were in FO4, but it's not supported in FO76. Even when they did have a mod shop, it was tiny compared to what was available for PC
---
I've been running mods since day 1. I wouldn't worry about it
---
No I'd say get a better attack for them, I absolutely hate them now and often just try to hide from them than bother to kill them.
---
I still need to launch my nuke and become death, but I don't think I'll be doing it today. Will hit you up if I do tho!
---
‚ÄúMulti-tasking king, bitch‚Äù this couldn‚Äôt get more cringe üòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks!
---
Cringey, but still true.
---
Every single person who played 76 agreed to ToS. 
---
Also Terms and Conditions get thrown out in court?
---
Amazing. My entire previous job was working support specifically for answering questions about contracts and ToS.....
---
Not reading a contract or terms and conditions does not nullify your responsibility to the contract or terms you agreed upon...
---
And amazingly, of the few instances where a customer took our company to court over the T&amp;C's..... The only time a customer won was because a repair clause wasn't worded to exclude a very specific situation. 
---
I‚Äôm getting downvoted on this too. From one chavez to another even if you ain‚Äôt a chav cuz I am.. I FEEL YUH BRUH
---
No, the fix is usually updating your controller drivers. I exclusively play with a controller, and haven't had this issue since fixing drivers.
---
Its so frustrating when two are spamming at you so much that you cant actually see where either of them are. VATs only go so far :(
---
Yupp
---
It's just a play on words. Victor Hugo+Hugo Chavez
---
I have the pocketed chest and limbs if that's what you mean. Or did you mean the plan for the armor themselves 
---
They released a post somewhere saying they now have the topls to look i  people's inventories and see how much of something younare holding
---
The actual plans :)
---
Amen to that. I run melee but have a gatling as my ranged. Im lucky if i hit half my shots
---
i don't recall seeing post from everyone that's been banned saying they were duping. Infact on facebook i've seen more post about dupers making new accounts than people saying they didn't do anything wrong. Could you please link to a source where everyone is saying they haven't duped that was banned?
---
I would prefer make vault 76 a pvp area.
---
I actually love the idea of seeing a scorchbeast feeding on a human corpse littered in bobbleheads and nuka.
---
Where is Scorchbeast Daddy to make scorch babies? 
---
How did the bat dragons get so big in 25 years of radiation? 
---
What exactly are they? Where can I learn note about them? 
---
I think her scaling can get bugged. Sometimes I've had her scale to something unbeatable with just 4 players in the fight
---
Only Putin is stronger.
---
just nuke the entire game and start over.
---
Maybe bethesda should hire the RUST devs to make a decent game.
---
just build your base in the middle of no where, you can check it every minute then :P
---
The Scorchbeast Daddy is the other Scorchbeasts, the bats got so big because of (implied) government testing, Ultracite exposure, FEV exposure and radiation exposure.
---
I assume you do run the heavy weapon perks for accuracy. I really have no issues with using the GG at med to long range. As far as the model goes, I am thinking of ghouls and scorched. Are you on PC or console?
---
"Everything that can kill a man, I sell...except suicidal depression". 
---
I have except for the last patch. The only thing I notice since last patch is that hardened mass doesn't get scrapped. Over half of the claimed bugs fixed I still experience
---
Hell ya I hope they can, I play fair so I want balance as much as the next guy. Even without duping and cheating super high level players still have a decent advantage so ya, create a unique I'd for crafted items like ark(all items have the player who crafted its name attached to it).. I got legendaries but nothin too sweet and def ain't found and TS E or TSE so bring it on!!
---
I tried but between PS4 and mobile app I just can't figure out how to post a pic?
---
The only pics I could get though was the route I took on my map and me with my pipboy open at my camp in Cranberry Bog. 
---
God bless your heart
---
I'm sorry, criticism of the game isn't allowed on this sub, it hurts the fan boys feels. 
---
I gotcha. :) I'll be on the lookout. 
---
Just wanted to say that this is really cool, but also that this is accurate to the real Harper's Ferry. Live near there IRL and there is actually a specific hotel that I'm thinking of that looks like that. Good job.
---
Support as in you worked in a call center or answered emails with canned responses? And nobody agreed to anything. EULAs and ToS are not worth the paper they are printed on. Forcing a contract under duress for a product that has already been purchased does not equal any kind of agreement. I add my own stipulation if I click the button I am not agreeing to anything, and that I reserve the right to a full refund if at any time I am made aware of any part that I disagree with.
---
Thanks sis &lt;3
---
Helps that the cannibal dude looks like Jacob Seed
---
‚ÄúEat or be eaten‚Äù
---
Kind of like how a bloodied build with unyielding gear and radicool is OP? I'm just gonna drop from OP build to OP build until they understand wtf game balance actually means
---
oh shiiit. i think i have metal picnic table. but its 4am... ill check tomorrow. wish me luck!!!
---
Bethesda got their money when the game was bought, there is no monthly fee and atoms are optional. 
---
They aren't getting money from eBay sales of their IP.  And, the sellers don't own it.
---
Many developers shut that down pretty quickly.  You can be sure Bethesda will follow suit.
---
You need Marie Kondo
---
Already tried that, also tried downgrading, uninstalling, and reinstalling the driver. No change.
---
You'll note that the very first non-MS response in that thread is that "reinstalling the driver did **not** fix the issue, and the only solution is to not let the controller die". You'll also note that the MS response helped 0 users, but the user "fix" helped 29 users - a strong indication that no, reinstalling drivers is not a sufficient fix.
---
That's really good idea. Not only in Whitespring, but almost anywhere there's a chance that your 3star Lege vanishes to the abyss. Be it tall grass, pack of monsters or an exploding vehicle, more often than once I have lost loot, because of the fact.
---
They could simply leave a corpse glowing green, as they do glow when spawning.
---
In the Prima game guide they mention 1. Player CAMP vending machines and 2. Harvester Protectrons. We are already getting the former, so my guess is they are coming later too.
---
It would be like confiscating counterfeit money. It doesn't matter if you didn't know, they're still going away and you're shit out of luck and you should just be thankful that you're not getting arrested yourself. 
---
4 missile turrets and a MG turret are just as good as an ASAM, offense wise. The problem is keeping them running.
---
This was happening to me. Loaded into a new server and didn‚Äôt have a problem 
---
They lack like hell as well sometimes but not always 
---
I've tried that once, didn't help unfortunately.
---
*incoming ban for life*
---
Take the junk out that is required and put it back into your stash. There is a way to fix it. 
---
I don't think you can buy them, I've been looking since beta. Best I've gotten is ability to craft sturdy legs but I have no idea how I learnt it. Heard rumours it can be obtained through Mire events but I can't confirm.
---
Okay thanks for the info :)
---
Nerfing weapons is pretty low, generally. There are always going to be players who rip off the system. Given that we are generally not competing against each other, I don't see how it's necessary. Every time weapons are nerfed because of misuse by experienced players, it unfairly hobbles the rest of us inexperienced players, who play by the rules and don't dupe, mule or anything else and who are just politely working our way up to the boss beasts. Most players fit into this latter category.  Please make the rest of us your primary concern.
---
I only wish people wouldn‚Äôt build Camps at the pond. It prevents anything from spawning. It‚Äôs not a huge deal since I can just hop servers but it‚Äôs definitely an annoyance.
---
Already dude, go buy it and find out 
---
Ohhhhhhhh. We should rename it SaltBoy76.
---
:') that was beautiful..
---
PVE servers won't stop people from griefing or trolling players. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ 27 downvoted. Sorry but this sub is a fucking joke. Actual Bethesda arselickers who can‚Äôt admit when there is a problem 
---
That‚Äôs a start, but not exactly game changing. (Well I mean it technically changes the game but not significantly, although it is convenient)
---
As long as the npcs aren't humans, but like ghouls or super mutants it could work. Let's be real they aren't going to magically add human npcs to the game. Would diminish the whole design/point of the game and at this point, feel out of place with all the human players. 
---
That worked, thanks!
---
You live in a democracy full of opinions, get over it 
---
Not a problem, knew there was a fix, had it happen when I was trying to make power armor yesterday 
---
Well they are currently banning dupers and their statement was even if their is a exploit in the game you made the Choice of using it so suffer the consequences 
---
They should make a Perception perk card that highlights unlooted corpses in green, similar to how the Scrapper perk in Fallout 4 would highlight loot you have tagged.
---
I found the toolbox and large tool box plans at the harpers ferry vender.
---
Quality post, 11/10.
---
OMG. And they basically said they don't give a shit?  They've made an offer which you've accepted in good faith and they've failed to deliver. Not acceptable, legally or morally. This is like the canvas bag fiasco. They really need to fire some people.
---
Use area chat or the neon lettering for your CAMP. 
---
This feature would be easily abused. It's a bad idea.
---
I have it. 
---
I still have never gotten an answer anywhere to this
---
Am I going crazy, or did the camo combat armor used to have screenshots with the camo hunting rifle for a little bit before it was taken out?
---
Yeah, it seems like such wasted potential to create that whole system (which had potential but wasn‚Äôt very fleshed out) and not only not expand upon it but straight up scrap it!
---
They should just make it so that equipped or favorited items don't show up in trade windows.
---
the game never left beta lol
---
It sucks when your low level
---
Did you open a ticket for it?
---
They got the money when the game was bought, and apparently it did so poorly it was being sold at half price within a month after release. Have you ever considered there might be some collusion between gold sellers and the company that owns the game? Or at least some kind of symbiotic relationship, of continually banning them and them rebuying the game over and over. The money they make from gold selling and farming is enough to buy many more copies of the game. It's an economy of its own. Lineage 2 was always filled with bots and RMT farmers. WoW was always filled with bots and RMT farmers. Some of the biggest and most popular games for RMT. Eve Online also, though they started selling monthly subscription in game items that could be sold in game directly for in game currency, basically becoming the ISK (in game currency) seller themselves.
---
Over between robco and the generals steak house
---
What duress were you under when you clicked Agree to play a video game?  You think those forms are made up gibberish?  They hire lawyers to write them so they will stand up in court. Bethesda is a powerful company.  You want to try and fight them in court?  Not only will they easily win, but those aforementioned lawyers will drag that shit out for years to bleed you dry of every penny you have so you are forced to drop the suit.  Then they can counter sue you for breaking the ToS and EULA.
---
Yea thats what's happening too me
---
Signs and letters - the 11000 cap one.
---
PC :)
---
No it doesn't. I'm still unsure if Hunter's affixed to weapons works, but I can tell you Hunter's Armor has 0 effect. 
---
Using lone wanderer is actually better than any benefits from a team when it comes to damage mitigation. As for the rest I've no idea beyond assassin / sentinel gear and good perk loudout, but 10 mins seems excessive. 
---
That‚Äôs a good point, DUAL-WIELDING CONFIRMED!!! I wish lol. It would actually be really cool since hip firing is already less accurate so it practically balances itself. I know that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre saying but I had to since you brought up dual wielding
---
Do like me take a few months break till next patch.
---
My lucky egg!
---
No, it's not. It means people don't know how to uninstall and reinstall drivers correctly. You can uninstall them from your hardware skipping the xbox accessories app. 
---
But how would those guys know ? *rimshot*
---
You have none, bitch. keep going you are amusing üòò
---
" 
---
**~~edit:~~** ~~To get some things straight,~~
---
* ~~2-shot weapon = 25% damage~~
---
* ~~explosive weapon = 100% damage~~ **~~AOE~~**
---
* ~~2-shot explosive = 250% AOE &lt;-still the real problem.~~
---
"
---
so what now? they will let untouched the two shot weapons or they sill plan to nerf to 100+25%?
---
nope, it‚Äôs been absolutely terrible for the past week, even worse after the patch. instead of constant disconnects (that i still get like once every two hours) i keep crashing to desktop more than ever. sometimes it‚Äôs so bad that i cant even go full two minutes without crashing, and a third of that little time is spent waiting for the game to load after the loading screen because otherwise it‚Äôs a sure crash or freeze
---
Exactly, basically every level 50+ character i see around has a TSE weapon of some sort, bought from ebay or from fallout76market dupers. Bathesda will probably never find and punish those who has duped those weapons, nore subtract them from the people who bought them (knowingly or unknowingly).
---
TSE weapons should have been the most rare and powerful weapons of the whole game, and now basically everyone have at least one.
---
Right now I almost feel to be an idiot not exploiting the game and buying some TSE weapons, since everyone around have at least one...
---
Wait it works with the rads you already have?  I thought it healed once rads was inflicted on you
---
the community manager already said that vendor level cap is getting addressed next patch. Everyone should be able to buy multiple copies of handmade plan after lv15 from Harpers Ferry or Watoga soon...
---
I hope you‚Äôre right. I also hope it isn‚Äôt as basic and lame as animal friend.
---
I love the game and don't feel ripped off, but I paid $13 for it, not $60.
---
Doesn't mean I can't be annoyed with crappy in game mechanics.
---
My excavator glitched on me and now I can't put it back out. On a side note it did somehow duplicate my ultracite armor. I'd still rather have excavator though.
---
I'm really sick of White Springs.  My team wanted to drop a nuke tonight and they chose White Springs, of course.  I was having way more fun nuking fissure site prime and fighting the SB queen, but even that is starting to wear thin. I was trying to kill as many queens as possible hoping to find plans for ultracite calibrated shocks, but finally found a guy who would make them for 2000 caps and I bought them because I am sick of farming them. 
---
Yup they cheating or stacking bobbleheads. Seen this two days ago. Literally 5 players were all attacking one guy and he wasn't dying. No power armor and flying around one shotting everyone. Had a 80,000 bounty on his head. 
---
RUST is a better survival game than F76b with better base building too lol
---
Too true 
---
For me the opposite worked. Was building Excavator and had this issue so I thought the game was having problems taking stuff out of my stash. Took all the components with me and had no issue crafting it
---
They are too busy nerfing stuff. No time for real problems
---
I forgot about that gear set, but even so it seems unlikely that he would take so little damage in so much time. He didn't even need to stim at all. 
---
I'll return to playing once the first ban waves roles out; that way I'll know Beth is serious about the cheating. Until then these are just thin veiled threats in Hope's to curb thecramoant duping exploits. I've been away from any fo76 for 6 weeks now, I'll return when I see progress 
---
I wish the recon scope wasn't a dirty white colour. It ruins the aesthetics of guns so much I don't use it.
---
&gt; We recognize these exploits are currently ‚Äúpart of the game‚Äù and we know we need to make fixes, but it doesn‚Äôt mean taking advantage of them is acceptable. It‚Äôs why players must specifically agree not to take advantage of them when they acknowledge the Terms of Service and Code of Conduct before being able to participate in Bethesda services.
---
hahaha, did this argument actually get so big that they had to address it? "I'm capable of cheating, therefore it's ok". 
---
I hope leniency here means a shorter ban, not getting let off free. Cheating in this method is a conscious and active decision, everybody who did it knew exactly what they were doing and decided to do it anyway
---
&gt; As we have discussed, this game will continue to evolve through the years, and we want to make sure everyone knows how we‚Äôre making changes in the game. If you have thoughts and feedback, we want to hear from you.
---
Lovely, I know this is one we have wanted for a long time. I'm glad after such a long time of apparent carelessness they're cracking down on cheaters
---
I never clicked agree. See that's the thing. I never signed anything. I never clicked anything. And I'm not the kind of person who would take it to court. I'm the kind of guerrilla warrior who would if provoked become a massive thorn in any giants side. A small flea can drive even the biggest dog insane. Big things don't scare me. And I personally don't have a problem with Bethesda. Nor do I have a problem with people buying and selling their time in a free market.
---
Actually, if you can't damage the queen it's a fair move  to kill the mobs around. 
---
Yes. All duped items should be deleted. To hell to those that bought them 
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314752/regarding-dupes-and-exploits?language=en
---
There you go the response from Bethesda themselves 
---
Nope. Be lucky you're not banned. An item deletion is justified 
---
Maybe it's a set amount until a certain amount of players are in the area.
---
Once thing I've noticed since the last patch is that I now need to have an extra adhesive to repair my armor. The repair list will say something like
---
    adhesive (2/2)
---
    steel scraps (2/2)
---
    screws (2/2)
---
With none of them showing as red. But when I try to repair it says I don't have the resources. I go off find some duct tape or wonderglue, scrap it for adhesive and will only be allowed to repair when I have adhesive (3/2). I think that it happens with adhesive but that might be confirmation bias as that is what I usually have the lowest number of. 
---
After the repair I'll be left with 1 adhesive in my inventory.
---
Wow. I have never seen a bounty like that. It's very infuriating when someone starts out very scrubbish and talking trash, and then comes back completely invincible. 
---
My turrets just look at them without a reaction. 
---
I'm not talking about crashes. I mean fps. I bought this game because fallout is my favorite franchise. But I'm waiting for the performance to improve before I actually play it. I just pop back into the game when a patch drops to see how the fps is, and if its bad I just leave. I can get decent frames on low settings, but everything is blurry and looks terrible.
---
And every time it feels exactly the same as launch. I have a gtx 1060 6gb so idk what is happening. 
---
I live in Illinois and my mom used to be obsessed with that show at one point
---
oh dang that's a lot.. really hope they'll will fix it soon !
---
100% agree.The BETA state is indeed the FINAL version of this game , with all DLCs. Everything is in there, waiting for release. Nothing will be added.
---
Thank u for answering the question !  :) 
---
Turns out Todd wasn‚Äôt kidding when he said *youll never see a server*...at least not for very long.
---
There is a scene in the ASOIAF (Game of Thrones) books involving a Dornish prince and a dragon that this really reminded me of. The ending is even similar.
---
Well written and I second the trophy idea!
---
Yes I do run the accuracy perk and PC. After 20 feet I start missing about every 3rd or 4th bullet due to it just flying off to the left or right. At 30-40 feet my gatling gun only hits about 2/3 of the time. Further than that I miss more than I hit despite aiming perfectly. Heavy weapons shoot in a cone and while the gatling gun is one of the better ones, the spread is still quite large. It doesn't seem as bad as the others mostly because it shoots slower.
---
Does your dude have crawdad arms?
---
Shucks, discovered this way of executing as well when hunting Wanted players, thought it was funny. People started to get confused and disgusted when they say me do that.
---
That‚Äôs not true, someone nuked Morgantown airport, inside all the ghouls were lvl 68
---
Good for him, at least that guy is having fun.Bethesda should focus on adding content because there will always be cheaters and glitches no matter how hard they try to stop them. 
---
Looking crisp ! Thx for sharing this with us.
---
Yes! My shelf of peanut butter jars full of screws would be the envy of the wasteland. 
---
Isn't there a legendary set that has a -15% damage if you stand still? Can you combine that with lone wanderer and get a 90% damage reduction?
---
You slighty late with this topic.
---
I‚Äôm just flying along near my own F.I.S.S.U.R.E. and these three other beasts stun lock me with their stupid op sonic attacks and steal my slaves.  Please nerf sonics.  I didn‚Äôt sign up for BvB (Beast vs Beast).
---
The point of the beta wasn't to solve problems so much as test server loads. I will say, on PC at least the servers were up for the majority of time after launch. And Bethesda had good fan feedback to get started on early patches. The game was planned to be updated from the start, of course they weren't going to fix anything. The game was already gold for at least half a month before the beta. So I suppose in the end, you're right, the beta was the finished game, but I don't think you're quite right in saying they did it just for the extra pre-orders. 
---
What do you mean Power User and 60% reduced weight? Don't you want Bandolier 2 instead? 
---
i‚Äôm used to low fps and been running the game on potato mode without anti-aliasing or anything since launch as i‚Äôm playing on a laptop but i get what you mean, it would be nice to try even medium settings for once but the game becomes literally unplayable if i go higher than low settings.
---
I witnessed that too, and usually the mirelurk queen just wrecks the scorchbeast quite quickly. 
---
Yes that is sentinel. That's is the setup that I am using. When wanted it is still possible to be 1/2 shotted with the right weapon especially if they are using a high powered anti armor like the guy that killed me. However that same guy couldnt do barely anything against this wanted player.
---
Worked for me today.  Repaired thunder mountain and then took over workshop.  The core processor immediately kicked out 2 cores!
---
Fo any other first timers, the core processor is down the slope next to the transformer yard.
---
You probably have another issue. I have an RX 480, which have the same performance of a GTX 1060 and the game runs very good most of the time with maxed settings in 1080p.
---
2mm counts as energy ammo which doesnt get reduced with bandolier 
---
This makes me so happy yet so sad at the same time. 
---
Happy they're acknowledging the bs going on from some player and are working to fix the issue permanently and thus making another big step to how the game should have been upon release. 
---
This makes me sad, however, that I wont be here to enjoy this games future depending on how long the game will receive updates. I love this game but sadly my heart has been set on Metro Exodus for years now and I'll be packing my things in Appalachia and heading back to my true home in the metros of Moscow. I'll be back some day but I'll be damned if I miss out on that experience. 
---
So with the sentinel set you can only be killed by anti-armor ? What about TSE gaus? Also,can you combine sentinel with lone wanderer?
---
Sweden too üòÇ. 
---
Todd Howard is on his way to your house with brass knuckles with 76 on them so you remember your wrong doing.
---
"Oops we couldn't find that page"
---
Pvp room in development?
---
That‚Äôs happened to me way too many times.
---
I think that most of the problems were related to connection infrastructure. If so, then Beta should have been started way earlier. Anyways, they probably learned something from these issues.
---
I agree. Nerf her health so it isn‚Äôt a chore. 
---
Your M79 Grenade launcher has broken dude. 
---
Send to bethesda, happens to me every login to new server
---
Two shot down from 100% to 25% for 2nd projectile.
---
Explosion down to 20% istead of 100%
---
Tse got a 75% nerf
---
Which is fine, it puts it more in line with the other mods.
---
Really cool base!Could you please give the location?
---
Bethesda's response to those people 
---
I have noticed with the now very long load times that your character has spawned well before your game finishes loading and so enemies have spotted and started attacking you for a good 20 secs or so before you even know about it...
---
I had not read it. Thanks mate. Great news
---
Where have you been?
---
Oh ok. I thought it was a ballistic type because Gauss cannons just use regular bullets, they are just propelled differently. 
---
It's a pretty standard tactic, they're being purposely vague so that people have to assume the worst and can't think of ways of getting around their punishment. Leniency in this case might mean a lesser ban or a character wipe instead of a ban, and ceasing activities might include not owning any duped items. At least I hope that's what they mean
---
They have a huge range. I often miss flying scorchbeasts and the nuke takes forever to reach the ground. 
---
Scorchbeast are already easy enough for being something near an end game mob. For risk of being downvoted.... Get better or run away. If they shoot less, the 15 seconds it takes to kill them will be dropped to like 5 seconds.... . I'm getting tired of everyone that can't handle something wanting to "make it easier". That isn't how life works and shouldn't be how we treat our games.
---
Pacifist mode always.
---
So many times after a car explodes or a robot self destructs, it's time to play hide and seek
---
Oh Brother you are so right those Brotherhood thugs seem to think they are incharge
---
I don't think that's it. I've taken her down easily with just two other people before and it's usually really easy with less people in the area. There's def some sort of bug that kicks in now and again where her damage mitigation is ridiculous.
---
You can be killed by anything. Anti armor has been destroying me lately. Basically with my dense armor, full sentinel set, fireproof perk, and lone wanderer most explosive weapons do hardly any damage to me unless they stack bobble heads. I tested this by having a friend engage in pvp with me and I just stood there. From about 10 feet he fully charged a gauss rifle and it took just under 25% of my health. He has all rifle perks, demolition maxed, bloody mess, tenderizer, etc. The only TSE that stood a chance was a TSE dragon at close range with over 50% damage on one hit. To answer your last question, yes they work together as far as I could tell.
---
This would be amazing. I usually don‚Äôt have a problem at whitesprings because once they are all dead I just finish a minute going through all their bodies but in nuke zones especially during the queen it is so hard to see all the bodies especially when they turn into meat piles.
---
I have a high level pistol character that's just bearly usable with a TSE Western revolver. Will have to respect after they need 2 shot for sure.
---
Energy weapons of all types are also completely useless.
---
Ah yes, the classic "I'm right and if you disagree you're stupid" argument. 
---
Assumption is the mother of all fuck ups.  Better testing would have avoid these mistakes. 
---
Violated TOS or just used an in game mechanic in a way the developer didn't expect, but honestly should have?
---
And yeah. Actually. Just doing something because you can is the battle cry of raiders so why not entrepreneurs? Shitty game mechanics and hoping people don't do things isn't a winning combination. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a great way to get loot and xp without putting any effort into it but I can backfire so I guess that‚Äôs karma for you
---
It works fine forever UNTIL you store it. Disconnects, swapping weapons, removing/adding all cells from your inventory are fine. But once you remove it from your inventory, it will be broken again once you take it out
---
Unlucky mate but always remember passive mode, sucks people abuse the situation but at the same time you gotta little fault in it.
---
Thank you for this ! Gotta get my ass to the bazaar and buy a few sentinel. I have 2 items with -15% DR while standing still but are not sentinel. 
---
PC
---
i also have a small issue with the potential nerf to explosive weapons. but i do see that it is understandable (sort of) you just gave us the fireproof perk's explosion resist to then further nerf normal explosive guns' base damage. i do agree that bobble head stacking should be something you fix first before dampening the effectiveness of explosive legendary gear.
---
also as a suggestion for future content. i would love to see legendary power armor come into play. possibly with "Legendary Chips", an attachment for power armor (armor that you found or crafted) that would permanently add the legendary effect to that piece of armor. example: you come across a "t51b Assassins chip" it can only be attached to a t51b torso and would the assassins effect. there could be chips for some pre-existing legendary effects and some power armor exclusive ones. said chips can be an unscrapable mod and for the sake of "balance" allow only 1 effect per power armor piece
---
another suggestion, more power armor arm mods. some examples i think may be good
---
Tuned Joints - increase normal melee damage +10% (at cost of breaking melee weapons faster)
---
Modular Knuckles - allow use of fist weapons (maybe at a small durability or swing speed penalty for 1, none if using 2)
---
Compensating Bracers - +10% ranged weapon accuracy (each)
---
That is sentinel. It can be the main perk or a secondary.
---
I think Bethesda already said that they were working on a fix for this.
---
Missle launcher targeting computer
---
Unless they glitched their damage with bobbleheads, their tse combat shotty aint wrecking her that quick. Yall gotta be slightly more realistic.
---
Wouldn't it be better if they just put 2shot and explosive as the same tier so they can't spawn together from this point further.  And then the ones in circulation (mine included) just become a corrupt item in the system.  Everyone gets to keep their characters, and no more tse guns.  Even better if they come up with a witty name for the corrupt item in your inventory.
---
Man, that sucks. Fortunately those experiences tend to be the exception, not the rule. If you're on PS4 and ever want someone to watch your back, hit me up.
---
 Underrated comment right here.

Stop crying . You act like you never went down there at lvl 20 or thirty. Hypocrite

Go into your game settings an enable pacifist mode.  This lets you freely shoot people without doing damage or becoming wanted.
---
There are a ton of generic challenges just to reward people for playing in any play style. Craft/scrap ___ X number of times, kill _____ with ______ X times, modify or repair _____ X number of times, etc. You can replace almost anything into those blanks and it's in there, even if it's misspelled or happens to be broken and not counting
---
Hear, hear. I'm with you on this. Scorchbeasts in general are such a waste of time and bullets.
---
Not always grievers. I found someone‚Äôs base and some mole miners were chewing on it. His turrets were just sitting there. 
---
Ffxiv was so bad on release most people uninstalled it. It was pulled from the shelves and set as free to play for a year and then was released as ARR, look where it is now. This game is no different, it needs a complete overhaul.
---
You not people?
---
that damage bugg i only encountered when using my explosive shotgun. i completely forgot about that. its what made me switch to melee/heavy guns
---
Loaded into game, died as soon as loading screen was finished. When I respawned there was not one, not two, but three scorchbeasts circling above me blasting me constantly. Plus about 20 scorched who were melee attacking me. Nice way to start the game. 
---
This is what made me finally quit. Not that I even have a TSE weapon. It is just that it has demonstrated all they will do to this game is try and fix the worst bugs, and nerf the things that become too popular. There is absolutely no will to look into the deeper balance problems behind why people are duping TSEs, just a lazy nerf bat.
---
Also if you're on PC, I'll trade you the missing pieces of sentinel for the rifle lol. I have extra combat and Marine sentinel pieces that are 3*. If so and you're interested PM me.

My weekly quest is to scrap 50 sports equiptment so I guess thats a subliminal message for fuck EA sports

Yet you play the game....mold and all. Would love to know what you do for a living so we can criticize the fuck out of you too. 
---
I would've never thought of duplicating.  Anyway, how did anyone discover the glitch?
---
Were they accidental but then kept repeating afterwards?
---
Is that the one just east of spruce knob? I think I tried getting at those both with my base but (at the time) couldnt find the acid.
---
That‚Äôs right by a fissure, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôll be having SB problems!

Thanks for the offer but will keep the rifle for now.

tbh the time isn't the problem, it's the people who are a problem. A good squad even without retardedly overpowered TSE weapons is capable of taking her out in a few minutes. A group of low level (or any level) leeches anchoring you down can mean even an hour is not enough to kill her. Realistically the proper solution is making her scale based on how many people are actively dealing damage to her, not just whoever is there, OR making sure people only get rewards if they deal enough damage to her
---
Well you must have the perfect combination cause my TS Handmade damage dropped by exactly 50% when I got it. 
---
No worries.
---
Did I mispell it?
---
Stay away from my current camp site...
---
I think both of those are "rad"
---
No, I'm not. Didn't really think about it until my mate who I play with pointed it out. Have done the same with a few randoms I've briefly teamed with and they were like "Oh yeah! Hadn't really thought about it but you're right!".
---
I'm not saying they're gone entirely thought.

---
Yup this is why games like Destiny and Division limit or flat deny player trading.
---
Woah, I swear I've heard that somewhere before....
---
I don't mind the speed of the attack but I do wish that the attacks themselves were much more transparent especially since the hitbox for the SB is kind of wonky.
---
Can you even build a camp with 5 turrets in it? Surely this leaves you with about 5% of the budget left to build a camp
---
'Unknowingly traded for duped items."
---
You'd have to pretty fucking thick man.

That's usually what a beta is
---
I've traded for one thing since launch and it was to help some random guy free up some weight. It was a ghoul Slayer explosive 50 Cal but aside from that I've grinded it all. Still fun even after doing it on my third too. (Sadly none are above 70 though)
---
Oooo nice one
---

---

---
This bug was listed as fixed in the last patch. As we can see nothing was done.
---
Bam the cheaters 
---
These two things are unrelated. What are you even talking about? Enjoy Metro, but there is no reason you can't play both, and his game will be around for 'years'. So not really sure why the second part of your post was even necesary
---
I've got a two shot western revolver, and even with perks it barely scratches schorchbeasts, whats your build?
---
Nawh, i didnt seen it, lol should go to nature for week. Sorry....
---
It's hard to keep the toilets clean when all you eat is mole rat chunks
---
Missile Turrets = 12%
---
MG Turret= 10%
---
At least as far as my camp budget is concerned. Some people say their turrets take up less, so it wouldn't surprise me if some people's turrets take up more. This discrepancy has to be some kind of rounding error when Camp budget is calculated.
---
If you don't pvp the people cheating barely effect you except for when they crash servers. It's fine that you aren't playing, we just see so many 'I'll come back and play 76 when...' posts that we really just don't care anymore. Play or don't.  We don't miss you and couldn't care less when you come back.  
---
Division is more like Destiny imo, cant really compare it a to a Fallout title. Apart from the crap the devs took at launch....whats worrying about that is Division is still shyte and the developers never got round to putting in everything  they promised before launch but are now taking pre orders for division 2.
---
I get they tried and tried and pleaded with the community, however the7y were a lot more transparent than Bethesda are being as well. Hamish's weekly streams, having the devs on the stream to speak about the biggest topics / issues players were having etc. They tried.
---
Bethesda promised more communication but have done 1 weekly empty inside the vault since :/
---
Division was more of a MMO and failed miserably in terms of what it was supposed to be / could have been. It was there first game in the franchise though and from looking at division 2 it seems like they may have learned some lessons....Bethesda on the other hand :(
---
Lmao are you serious because i tried it out that you can stack it just check it for yourself try equipong big guns 5 times youll definitely see it
---
It just wanted to spoon
---
Huh but that only happens if you stay outside the area, and it is not instant.
---
So that you know you‚Äòre wearing PA :D 
---
They haven't done anything yet. In every patch they say they have fixed some things and those problems are still in the game after every patch. We can expect that these empty words are just same and nothing will be done.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm seeing Boy meets Ghoul or Girl on Ghoul action.
---
It's just so gross tho :( 
---
Thanks but I‚Äôm on Xbox sadly
---
Eh its 2mm "electro magnetic" cartridges. So I guess that part is what makes it energy. Sucks because its   .04 lbs a round (.02 for non ultracite) and you have 2k ammo on you that's 80lbs in 2mm alone.
---
How do you put it on?
---
Totally agree. Stopped to drop nukes too, cuz u never know if u win lottery ticket with disconnect or u dont. Upvote!
---
This is the most annoying thing about the banning thing. The dupers and cheaters are still doing their stuff with impunity. 
---
Really? I actually like it. Gives you a more tactical feeling 
---
I have a 1060 3gb and it runs alright at medium 1080p, not great but maybe 40-60fps.
---
If you're on a laptop (those have hybrid graphics), double check the nvidia control panel, in the program settings, to ensure Fallout76.exe is using the nvidia gpu and not the integrated graphics. Sometimes it auto-selects incorrectly and runs a game without using the nvidia card. [People get 20fps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QxlqAAdxg) with just the intel integrated graphics on low.
---
Turn down CPU heavy settings and turn up GPU heavy settings. Your 1060 has quite a bit of headroom so you could even get Reshade without any additional drops.
---
Overclocking the CPU could be another solution.
---
Might lead to a good forking

one of the reasons i run in third person view these days :| the compass is so unbelievably broken too
---
It was added in the latest patch that some armor needs ballistic fiber to craft/repair. Check patch notes.
---
Apparently all armor lvl 25+ now takes ballistic fibre to repair according to the natch potes. Git hordin!
---
Agreed! I rarely die while fighting the Queen, but daaaamn, she takes a long time. And when you get 'er down to half and then she HEALS?! Aw man, the frustration!
---
Been fantastic for me since mid December I no longer get framedrops (PC though)
---
Yep. Anything over a 20 or 25 I believe. Pretty shitty too since I purposely went with garbage armor before to avoid having to server hop and farm ballistic. Now even my level 30 garbage armor needs fiber. 
---
Yea, we all know this bug since day one. We also know that Bethesda isn't doing anything to fix these problems. They just release empty words without any actual fixes. In latest patch there was listed 150 fixed things and almost all those problems are still in the game.
---
Nah man it just covers the whole screen really takes me out of the game tbh like it just really bothers me haha üòÇüòÇ
---
False, also letting them regen does not increase the likelihood of a legendary dropping vs not dropping.
---
I dont use any turrets at my CAMP as they are worthless when I'd used them in the past, even if they would defend it, the amount of space they take up in the budget I would much rather spend elsewhere as an actual building since things dont attack your CAMP unless somebody is there, and if someone if there that wants to wreck it, your turrets wont stop them, and if someone if there that doesnt want it gone, they will kill whatever is attacking it anyway
---
Yep, everything 25 and up.
---
Wow that's such garbage üòí
---
Spoiler Alert, ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù has Marsupial
---
Just bought it. Not that great but it's a 3-day-only so why not. I still keep 3K atoms in case of more weapons/PA cool paints show up
---
Every 3* Legendary does that. Just saying.
---
Imitation Seafood and Cajun Rice &amp; Beans will really do a number on any crapper.
---
then turrets should take up proportionately the same amount  of space at workshops, but they don't. I can have 20 turrets at a workshop. 9 in my camp is i forgo actual camp things that aren't turrets. 
---
So salty and defensive
---
It‚Äôs not really worth it since the copper extractor only provides ore.
---
I hang out on acid nodes because I like to the mining events in the ash heap. 
---
Yeah, but it's so much worse when it's the queen!
---
You're an idiot. lol
---
The next 4 perks you want to get are 3x white knight and a lucky break. Never repair armor again.
---
Whats wrong with the ore?  
---
I have quired a load of copper from it that I needed to make my X-01 armour so its done what I wanted it to do
---
Workshops generally have a significantly larger build area though.  I see your point though. 
---
Hahahahaha. 
---
Hahahahahaha. 
---
First off. Canned responses work when your involved involved in the intsallation, maintenance and repair of Fibre Op infrastructure along the East Coast. That goes over super well. 
---
And you completely miss the point. Court has fuck all to do with this conversation. 
---
Who gives a fuck about court in this situation. BGS doesn't need court. They can just ban you. It's their game. Their servers. Their service. 
---
I've been wondering this also. And also if this has an affect, like a damage increase, on enemies that don't wear armour? Or only on those who do?
---
Nothings wrong with it, it‚Äôs just more hassle since the patch that changed it. Now you have to refine it with acid, and for me that‚Äôs an aggravation since I‚Äôm always burning it up smelting other stuff or making gunpowder. 
---
let's put it this way: I can think of at least 2 other combinations that are just as op. Bethesda put them in the game, and even capped them in some way or another. which means they were fully aware of what they were doing.
---
they wouldn't have nerfed TS or E if it wasn't for reddit. and I say this because this is probably one of the largest Fo76 communities that continuously bitch about TS/E.
---
and I wouldn't be so mad if you people were right, if you knew what you're talking about. but the majority of players here don't know the first thing about the mechanics in the game. you essentially shaved off a huge chunk of enjoyment off the game for me, for no reason whatsoever except HUR DUR EXBLOSIVES
---
I'll agree that every other mod sucks in comparison, though. but that's not necessarily because TSE is OP, but rather because X slayer or nocturnal are stupid ideas.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt understand why they weighed as much as well.
---
Happy hunting 
---
I have lucky break maxed out but I never see it proc when I am fighting scorched beast
---
I usually try to play with a friend, so luckily we can rejoin each other when we enevitably crash or freeze (hopefully not at the same time).
---
It's only what, 30 caps? Not sure how many CAPs you get as a reward for taking it, then doing the first defense. But it's probably 30 caps.
---
I love how there‚Äôs soap EVERYWHERE, yet it‚Äôs impossible to clean items. How hard would to be to have a standard version and then a clean version that also required soap/antiseptic, purified water, etc. 
---
At least it made acid actually worth something.  
---
Before you needed it to smelt ores and make gunpowder it was worthless
---
Make sure you toggle 'craftable items' at the bottom of the crafting table HUD. If the mod you want is present, but greyed out even though you have all the requisite materials, make sure all the materials for the mod/upgrade is in your inventory and not in your stash (especially the required flux). 
---
For some reason, shielded mods can't be crafted directly from stashed materials.
---
Random Mobs wont attack your CAMP because they're a local spawn but Scorchbeasts will attack your CAMP as long as they're spawned
---
I find people with TSE ruin your nuke zone, they kill everything before I get a chance to fire a single bullet. 
---
Does Xbox have pacifist mode to enable lol if so that would be so nice 
---
No you can‚Äôt, without the original worn piece.
---
E.g, tattered dress = garb of mystery 
---
Bump, I had something similar happen, lost the blade of Bastet, &amp; garb of mystery on my main. My alt is working them now.
---
That may be one of the dumbest things I've read in this sub in a long line of dumb as fuck shit that gets said in this sub. 
---
Yes.  And fix photo mode while sitting or playing certain instruments 
---
Me and a buddy tried this, unfortunately it didn't work but, he could share the expert and master of the perk and if I had the first card equipped it gave me three levels in picking.
---
He wants to Claim an already claimed workshop, FT to the Owner, kill the owner, then come back to the workshop. 
---
Not sure why they can‚Äôt add a shared stash box. You have your normal stash box and then build a second shared box. They could even make it a smaller limit since the idea is to safely transfer versus hoard. If the main is 600, the shared stash could be 100-200.

---
Im pretty sure your CAMP isnt even rendered when there are no players nearby, I personally have never had a scorchbeast attack my CAMP while I wasnt there, only after I got there or within render range of it.  
---
I could be wrong, but even then, turrets tend to lure scorchbeasts in to attack your camp when they otherwise would have just flown past
---
You have to spend atoms. The clothes otherwise are pretty boring.
---
At level 70 I had my first PvP experience and didn't even mean to initiate it.  I always have pacifist enabled and have no desire to kill other players. 
---
I was in watoga and got a quest alert about a supply drop near me. So I go check it out and to my surprise the supply box is locked. I quickly pick the lock and bam wanted for 10 caps. Suddenly two guys pop out of no where and they decimated me. Typically I would not care, but had been doing some significant farming trying to save up resources to finish building my X01 power armour.  So that was annoying.
---
But my question is if anyone else has seen this happen with supply drops? Was this a glitch or can people lock them if they fall close enough to a workshop or camp? 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 (U.K) and can help! Never launched a nuke &amp; don‚Äôt know how but would love to learn!
---
turrets are blind, add an automatic searchlight and suddenly they can see. 
---
Why the fuck would they put it in the game, knowing it was broken?

He was a boy, she was a ghoul, can it get anymore obvious?

He had a gun, she was dark grey, what more can i say?

He'd wanna shoot her, but she couldn't tell, and loot her as well
---
He was a raider boy, she said "eat ya later boy," whitesprings wasn't good enough for heeeer
---
Same. My husband rarely if ever plays on my Xbox. One day he asked if I could rebuild his camp, so I logged him in on my Xbox (while I was logged out) and was surprised to see all of MY photos on his load screens and none of his. 
---
I means, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, but It seemed really weird that it would pull files from a user it shouldn‚Äôt have access to.
---
My base did have turrets. but i was nowhere near my CAMP, and basically all the other players were at Whitesprings or the Nuke Zone fighting SBQ
---
Many times when I spawn in the enemies are invisible. I can hear them attacking so I normally back myself into a corner and start swinging until I see xp popping up
---
its work i did before i got own lead extractor.
---
They haven‚Äôt even implemented a system yet where you can see which plans you already own. I‚Äôm afraid QOL improvements like this are a long way off. Which grinds my gears, too, as it seems there‚Äôs not an intact pane of glass left in the whole of Appalachia.

On the West Coast bottlecaps were used because the Water Merchants of The Hub backed it up with water and because bottlecaps are just really practical. We don't know exactly why it is used on the East Coast and especially why they are used in 76.

Only power armor users should hold heavy weapons. That'd be one thing.

A 50 cal MG should weigh close to 80 or 90 lbs - not a little more than a rifle.

It can initiate PvP?

That's not okay. What if you did all the work and spawned the queen, and were working on her when some supermutant with hypermode TSE kills her doing the majority of the damage. You and everyone else that only did a little damage shouldn't get credit? Like I said, that fix won't be fair.

I was furious about this for a long time until I realized that it was a decent opportunity to check out other players' CAMP designs without having to make much of an effort to do so. Prior to that, I came across other CAMPs fairly infrequently...

That‚Äôs the fastest way to farm junk. Kill other players. I didn‚Äôt do a single mission till after I was lvl 100. You can‚Äôt be in a wasteland and expect there to be no marauders . Come on now!

Plus when you have a maxed White Knight card, armour requires only 1 peice of ballistic fiber to repair when neededüëåüèΩ

It stops you from initiating pvp.  It's so players can't jump in front of your shots and force you into pvp or so you don't accidentally shoot another player.

Better yet.  Let me craft a "clone" that will group with me and hold weight for transfers.  That way when I disconnect I can get back in.

Maybe a sink or toilet paper? the rug‚Äôs been getting noticeably dirtier everytime my friend uses the restroom.

Yea a front moved in its pretty cold...

Someone robs a bank, and drops a bag of stolen money during their escape... if you pick it up and keep it, you're guilty of stealing.

I really like how you bring up the Dunning-kruger effect as if I've somehow not heard of it before. but I'll bite - tell me. What am I ignorant of in relation to 76?
---
Level 61; I ain't got jack shit.
---
I did see a level 15 today with an explosive shot sub machine gun.....hmmmm?
---
Genius, leave a nuka mine outside and walk away, maybe entice players with a fake scavenger hunt that lures them into the porta potty looking for the next clue.
---
If I see a better event going on I don't go lol. Have a great time farming legendarys no one in my way and usually better loot
---
Genius idea, maybe leave a nuka mine outside and walk away, could possibly entice curious players with a scavenger hunt that lures them into the locked porta potty looking for the next clue lol.
---
One day to scrap 76 shotgun? 
---
Excellent! Does it also stop damage on other people's camp? Like if I shoot a ghoul or such near someone's house and a bullet goes stray. 
---
The part about the roundhouse kicks vs guns to solve differences is true. Chuck Norris always wins.
---
I don't think I've seen a real answer to this.  One of the unsolved mysteries of this game. 
---
not with that attitude
---
ps4?
---
The discussion is about the .50 receiver for the hunting rifle.
---
It is most definitely this. I use sentinel assassin armor, with dodgy and the fireproof/dense, I am immune to any damage from players until my ap runs out
---
Bravo m8. 
---
You have to go to the area where you get them, so all of my Camden park ones trigger as soon as I get to the Ash Heap ect...  
---
Then it should be the same way as when you first do them
---
You're on the money, Sentinel Assassin armor set, Dodgy perk, Fireproof/dense, lone wanderer, all ammoint to greater than 100% damage reduction and dodgy allows you to bypass the games cap to get true 100% however your ap drains with damage instead, and you will take damage with no ap.
---
&gt;FYI, any used car you buy is by default legally considered an "as is" sale, even if they don't tell you it has problems.
---
Not true.
---
I havent but it sounds like a good idea, I usually just nuke where I see a load of people bunched up or taking a workshop
---
I'm not positive but I don't think it does.  
---
Modern Warfare. Modern Warfare never changes. If that really will be the new PvP mode, an arena and not the entire map, then I'm fine with it. Less assets to load means less lag, and an okay way to test out a build you're working on. Now if inventory (mostly junk) can be separate from the main game, and you don't drop precious materials upon death, we're talking.
---
Games dead. Maybe it'll be something worth visiting 4DLCs later &amp; 10  patches. You can't stick to anyone because they've done it since October &amp; its 2019 and still no action, just threatening words with no action.
---
I just destroyed a Mirelurk Queen in 2 seconds - literally before she could even attack me back and I don't use VATS.  So, my TSE Handmade Rifle is clearly still OP without VATS?
---
If I didn't have that gun, I'd use my Gauss Rifle, and I'd have to shoot it from stealth if I wanted to have a hope of taking her down quickly.
---
Sorry Xbox and Aussie servers üòè
---
I‚Äôm not annoyed about being attacked, I‚Äôm annoyed about people abusing the system
---
Where did this "fight" take place the Atomic Wrangler?
---
Wow. Would you look at that. A quote by [BigBoyardee](https://www.reddit.com/user/BigBoyardee)
---
"I quit my job highschool because I could earn a near full time income after school by selling power leveled Diablo 2 accounts loaded with items."
---
What a hypocrite.
---
Sorry to necro your thread. But the answer you are looking for is Hornwright Test Site #3. Roughly 200 iron Ore with an excavator armor. Add super duper and relog to farm it and you'll be swimming in steel.
---
Ill answer this for you, I have a full set of sentinel gear with secondary assassin effect, thats 75% plus 40% reduction from players. The game caps the reduction so you will always take a little, however the perk dodgy allows 30% damage avoidance at the cost of 30 ap. This bypasses the cap and gives you 100% damage avoidance until your ap runs out (while standing still that is). If you have dense and fireproof, then even once your ap runs out you will take miniscule damage because explosions will do nothing to you either. Ive literally stood in place and been shot repeatedly with an explosive shotgun. I was able to draw my weapon, turn around, and line up a shot to down the guy. I took ZERO damage during that time.
---
When you wake up after a long night of drinking and don't know where you're sleeping.
---
I like the music. Reminds me of some N64 games. 
---
Not me! Lvl 58 rocking a hunting rifle with no legendary effects. Those op weapons make the already pretty easy later game dumb easy 
---
Yeah the issue is if say you need 16 aluminium. If there's 8 in stash and 8 in inventory it will show you have enough but won't let you craft, they all need to be in the same place. 
---
Pretty sure a bug exists that double stacks the excavator armor bonus temporarily when logging in.  
---
It‚Äôll be fixed one day. 
---
That's not how bugs work.
---
Im pretty sure it can be in the third slot as well, just alot rarer. I have two pieces of "poisoner's" pieces that have both sentinel and assassins on each.
---
Or when you get excited about killing a scorched with a fire axe only to drop a lead pipe..
---
So... what was the problem?  
---
You said you came off because you had to eat, then you submitted a ticked?  
---
A ticket for what? eating?
---
&gt; You can become wanted from opening a supply crate. You can become wanted from claiming a workshop where pvp is enabled but you hit a turret during the fight.
---
This is exactly what happened to me.
---
Actually when I heard about nerfing two shot, explosive attributes I felt myself a bit sad.
---
I personally have a few two shot and explosive weaps, but these attributes obtained separetly. I obtained those two shot weapons by killing mobs. I play 200 hours overall and I want to mention, I had 0 weapons from mobs with two shot and explosive attributes in the same time.
---
I didnt dupe. Played fair. Im a high level. I should kill scorchbeasts eg easier. But mainly when I use explosive weapons I deal no damage to them at all. Even with double shot weapons I cant deal high damage. I need to shot plenty of times to kill scorchbeast.
---
On the same time I see ppl who one shot scorchbeasts with handmade, and kill queen in 2-3 shots, and these players have less lvl than I have.
---
They probably have tse. Bobbleheads stacked. Is it normal? I saw u, bethesda, have been writing here and there that u are against cheating/exploiting? Well I dont see that. I still see people with op damage. U can even not to start pvp in the game. Someone for sure has 20k damage. These people easy kill you even in pacifist mode. Also if to talk about weapons, I still use minigun for 600 rounds and it breaks, what makes a use of minigun just pointless. 
---
I want to sum that.
---
I don see that you, bethesda, fix really important things to make the game interesting. As I said, plenty of bugs, including fast shooting weapon fast breaking, bobbleheads exploit, servers crashing without any reason when you try to kill queen or drop the nuke, disabled pvp system, no any new content which should make the game more interesting for players who play from beta, cosmetic bugs. Nothing from those were fixed, updated.
---
U have just stolen my money bethesda without keeping your word about supporting a game. And now I dont see any reason to play the game anymore.
---
NANI?!

---
In the golf club there is a clown doll with a red balloon in one of the fridges. Seems like an IT easteregg.
---
Thx for posting these. BTW, I'm German as well, but I would never play the game with those language settings. I hate how every item name is eingedeutscht. ;-) 'Doppelschuss Der Drache' and all that.
---
Im not really fussed either way, as long as the TSE players cant run rampant on the normal servers I dont care what they do with PvP
---
Yes it is. Go there before you do the silo and see what enemy‚Äôs there are. If there is anything besides ghouls or scorched, relog and go to a different server where they have ghouls or scorched. Then drop the nuke, and you get a lot of glowing ones, as many as whitespring 
---
You‚Äôve contracted Ghoul HIV, Your SPECIAL AREA is enflamed.

love like a scene from a HBO prison drama.
---
&gt; tell me. What am I ignorant of in relation to 76? 
---
My god... You want me to read your mind?
---
&gt; I really like how you bring up the Dunning-kruger effect as if I've somehow not heard of it before. 
---
I'll remind you of a prior comment you made:
---
You know the Dunning-Kruger effect isn't just about a stupid person being WAY over confident in estimating their ability in something and lacking the very skills required to know they lack that ability. It's also about how poorly highly skilled people underestimate their abilities and expertise.
---
&gt;Boi, I could wipe the fucking floor with you on information.
---
If I had to pick one, you seem more the over-estimating type. Just a hunch.
---
At least I know not to be so arrogant and stupid as to make such a declaration without first knowing the degree of knowledge that the other person has first.
---
I'm just embarrassed for you now.
---
A conju"ghoul" visit?
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre talking about there. Ores have been in since before resource collectors made ore instead of the resource. Lode Baring and Breach and Clear gave large amounts. 
---
Be warned, I just did this today, there were scorched there before the nuke, and all there was afterwards were 10 or so scorched. No glowing ones. Complete waste of time for me
---
Yeah, same. To this day IDK why it was locked and I got wanted, but I'm guessing it had something to do with the nukes. I also got wanted from killing a super mutant attempting to destroy a camp ( single headshot, did not hit any structures) very confused by that one too.
---
It's also notable that you don't drop ore when you die. I can carry around 500 lead ore and not have to worry about losing it if I get killed, allowing me to free up stash space for things that actually matter like flux and springs while still having all the lead and stuff at my disposal I need.
---
How is that not how bugs work? It was broken in the last game and still is in this game. Its the same asset being ported over, which has the same bug.
---
You made the claim that I pretty much embody the Dunning-kruger effect, you back up that claim by showing how I am woefully inept about 76. Go ahead, make my night.
---
You can. Favorite 
---
Not us, NOT US!
---
I agree. The other day they nuked her and there wasn't too many people there. Like 12. Only two were in the forties. Everyone else was above max and everyone was pounding the hell out of her. I saw two explosive shotguns and my gatling setup that melts the lvl 80 scorchbeasts not doing anything to her. 
---
  I ended up blowing over 1000 5mm just back pedaling and firing at the stupid amounts of scorched ads that everyone likes to ignore. I would even cripple her with enforcer and everyone would dump into her face and her hp bar would barely move 
---
I'm sure if you tried, you could have thrown in few fairies and magical cave too.
---
Might have gotten this but it does not change the Recon scope color so no thx.
---
Dang, no ban on my account for something similar. In stealth I snook up on their container and quickly R R E'ed it then fast traveled to the acid pools in the toxic Valley and dumped it all. 
---
You can especially tell if something's off if you have the show health mod. You might not be able to see some of the details behind the scenes, but you can see how much health she's losing per shot.
---
Hi, I'm new on reddit. Can I buy the explosive weapon on market. Please
---
Looks like a rare wendigo.. I wonder if its a legendary 
---
damn that good!
---
I'll definitely be back. Probably mid spring. 
---
Cool! I'm not a melee player and it seemed pretty good at offering high ground and seemed to have a fairly refined circuit. Forgot about scoping the enemy types first. Glad you mentioned that!
---
It literally does though. 
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs been mentioned previously but is there any official word on the state of energy weapon durability? I can‚Äôt get through 100 rounds without my weapon breaking.
---
Pretty sure they fixed it, as I've been using it in FO4 for the last two weeks with no problems. I've been playing FO4 waiting for them to fix 76 before I return to 76. 
---
ah the classic, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" move. The Scorchbeasts are pro's at this!
---
Portable power saves if you have one frame of each pa(raider,excavator,t45,t51b,t60,x01,ultracite) in your inventory while wearing none of them 52.5 lbs. Make sure that you put your pa pieces on frames, a frame weights only 10 lbs, while a single piece is heavier=&gt; easily storable within your stash. (Raider and t45 are bad, excavator has utility but the weakest defence, t60 is cheap to repair but gets outclassed since it's defences are just mediocre and power patcher exists)
---
Considering the 90+ lbs I'm pretty often saving with batteries included...(gauss ammo,plasma cores and fusion cores are heavy af)
---
If it's fixed before the crashes or shared storage is added I'm probably done with this game.
---
There was a great shack roof in F4 that had one corner missing, a gap large enough for the pylon to poke. Shame we don't have that...
---
This doesn‚Äôt make sense, tons of modders of fallout 4 already make awesome looking right handed animation and they look so much professional and awesome, even some use Battlefield 1 animations, and you can also clearly see ejection port and the animation looks so vivid and punch a force!

One of my teammates bought from the same vendor https://i.imgur.com/LPRYSYT.jpg

I didn't even see the typo in your title let alone the screenshot until I read the comments lol
---
The mirv mod is bad, bugged, and should be avoided.
---
when the bomb package splits it spawns the nukelets at your feet and shoots them to where they should drop from, and if anything gets in their way they detonate instantly, never shoot down or from cover, you will die instead.
---
Whatever you do dont ask bethesda... or even tell them about it. They dont give a rat's ****
---
Thats why i have 2 dumpsters at my camp with the 'male' and 'female' sign above it.

I have Favorites reserved for other items. My favorite items. Not trash..

SHAMEFUL DISPLAY

Can always go through the 5 or so steps Sony suggests all the way down to wiping your whole system and reinstalling everything... wont help though

I friend requested everyone on my server last night.  After 3 accepted, I captured four workshops.  Stayed up till 3 am lol, didn't get disconnected though but at least I had a safety net if I did xD
---
hey oh!
---
So you somehow aquirred 1000 Savage divide #8 plans but have no idea how you got the ban
---
Nothing out of the ordinary then?

I try to honor that code in the streets of Sweden everyday.

Ed McMahon, Nice

Crafting catsoup at a cooking stove  and drinking ot gives you better sight at night for 3 hours
---
Yeah me too.
---
Lol. Million of bulk ballistic fibres? Well not only ballistic fibre can't be bulked, but unless someone proves otherwise, I won't believe you can even have 0.1 million of anything. I once saw a player die, and on his bag were conviniently ~64k of steel and aluminium, which makes me believe the max limit for anything is 2^16. Which is high enough that there shouldn't be much reason to increase it.
---
Anyway, that's irrelevant technicality.
---
I means it's all nice and stuff. But I start believing it when I start hearing people complaining about how their've been "nuked" by CS. Just claiming they will do something won't impress me. It just feels too much of PR move. Even on that thread, few posts down the line and someone is rejoicing that and saying they spent 20 dollars on Atoms.
---
Also stacks with calibrated shocks, and marsupial, so if you log in wearing excavator set your carry limit is 520 but I dont lose it when I fast travel on PC, only drops to correct 420 when I exit the frame, very handy for vendor runs.
---
I found that if you empty your inventory of all your cells but one for the first shot you can then pick them up and it should work fine.
---
I agree.  I've been stashing it all, then repairing weapons or making them and breaking them down for mods.  
---
If you're on PC, you can have my sword. I'm not on at the moment though, since it's currently 5 AM.
---
Have you gotten all the perfect weapons and pieces of armor you want? Learned all the power armor plans? Collected rare outfits? Gotten the top tier underlining plans for all underarmor? In my opinion, the end game isn't quests and missions. It's collecting and finding rare things. It's getting that perfect set of gear or that perfect weapon for your playstyle or build. And in the process of doing so, you find all kinds of cool stuff on the map. 
---
There's a Beetlejuice r√©f√©rence too.
---
AND you are actually a toxic piece of shit. And if you like Bethesda and FO76 you should probably stop posting here, because you're not doing them any favors.
---
What do you have stock options on straw? What's with these strawmen arguments? 
---
Do I really have to spell it out for you?
---
Ok:
---
Strawman 1: Low information was in context to Fallout 76 not science.
---
Strawman 2: Dunning-Kruger comments were regarding your apparent awesome about of science knowledge, not in context of your knowledge of Fallout 76 (though that may be true too).
---
&gt; you back up that claim by showing how I am woefully inept about 76 
---
Like your prior statement "tell me. What am I ignorant of in relation to 76?". It bothers me a little that you don't understand the problem with asking such a question.
---
Let me repeat - I. Cannot. Read. Minds. Nor can I prove a negative within this specific context. If you're so knowledgable, you. should. know. that.
---
Look dude, this was fun and all but now I just feel bad for you so I'm just going to end it here.
---
I hope you have a better day tomorrow dude.
---
Pretty much every enemy above level 10 has armor, and some have a lot, especially over level 40. 
---
Armor piercing has a cap, but until you reach that cap is in essence a damage bonus. 
---
Armor is also effected by your weapon's base damage, armor piercing loses effective on weapons who's base damage is higher than the armor of your enemy, so a buffed, drugged up, unyielding, power attack from a super sledge hit can deal enough damage to render armor almost meaningless through sheer damage and benefits less from armor piercing, but unless you are dealing damage in the 600+ per hit range then armor piercing is always good, and if you are it doesn't really matter because most things are going to die instantly anyways.
---
Change it up use it as a trash marker lol
---
Is it bad that I read this to the tune of Wouldn't it Be Nice? 
---
Fwend request ppl and reconnect through them.  Sucks but it's a method lol.   Reclaiming the workshops after a disconnect isn't toooooo horrible if you're back in the same server.  
---
Don't use their pronouns.
---
My only gripe with that is that the game is a grindy system that has you endure so many repetitive quests that the thought of aquiring this level of armor and weaponry doesn't feel satisfying as it does a waste of time. 
---
Bunker buster quest reward was like 40lbs.  No way I could keep it!
---
Good on ya mate, very kind.  I'm on ps4 or I'd hit ya up.
---
A bit early to be hitting that ol' sauce though.  Just saying.
---
Oh no, now people can get into your base and steal nothing!
---
Hazmat suits provide too much protection from radiation for this drastic of a change - so as its condition degrades, so should its protection (holes in the suit, ya know, like a damaged hazmat suit).  There's other advantages to normal armor like protection from explosives that you can't get in power armor, plus some regular armor also provides some radiation resistance.
---
Hazmat suits if this change is made has to have an additional factor beyond just condition.  Degrading radiation protection would be the way to go.  I'd also make a base suit 500 RR to start (at 100%), if you want 1000 RR suits must be over repaired to 200%.
---
I was the exact same
---
Yes. There‚Äôs a YouTube vid on it.  Guy goes around nuking different areas.  I‚Äôd say if the right move are there is better than white spring 
---
Bro last time i checked its currently insanely cheap like the 10 - 15 dollar range for most areas. So not sure what the issue is?.
---
Well, that kind sucks. 
---
But then, what difference is between you and some duper and his friends. Servers don't know about actions. Servers only know what you have.
---
If you still have some in 11 hours I‚Äôd like to pick some up

Gt: The Tower Ball

Yea i got rid of all my stuff and quit the game untill they fix or stabilize the game
---
I can't pronounce it either lmfao 
---
Nobody know any place for farm whiskey??
---
Some glitches I'm happy to keep
---
I've run into similar issues when trying to craft ammo with just enough lead split between stash, and inventory. I think the crafting system can only pull from one source at a time.
---
Idk. I'm level 310. And keep logging on every day. I make rounds around the whole map. I do events and nukes. I hang out random strangers I run across. I rebuild my camp as my collection of learned items grow. At the end of the day, it's an rng grind game. And if that's not what you're into, you're just not gonna enjoy fallout 76 much once you finish the main and side quests. 
---
ask the dupers to gift you a few thousand ballistic fibers from their stash of millions. 
---
I hope the community agrees with my points and maybe has feedback to expand on what i posted.
---
That sounds like cheating to me how are they allowed to damage you?
---
If they had the tools, they would have done something about it..? People have been duping for ~2 months and they finally made a statement about finally making tools to stop duping.
---

Thanks I'll give this a go!

Let's speak about that in a few weeks when people can't stack bobblehead nor have duplicated guns :)

Not saying you are, but downing the queen regularly in 5min is not supposed to happen.

My Gamertag Is Tycen shoot me a msg on there and I'll rig u up got too much

Wont they just fast travel out of the kill zone? What would be the point then, just for fun?
---
Three level 100+ guys were struggling to get my level 12 alt out of their workshop.  Fake problems.   Plz stop.

Maybe 5 people slap damaging you at once adds up?

Good sir, I regret that I MUST correct you.  His name is Sir Pippers the fourth.

I can confirm the turrets. I recently moved camp and it stored four copies of my base. Sounds cool, but I only wanted to keep a couple big things like my rad shower and fusion generator. Instead, before I could build anything new, I had to scrap hundreds of wall pieces, posters, lights, etc. 
---
Obnoxious. 
---
It‚Äôs not like I needed 4 fusion generators or rad showers anyway. I just scrapped the extras for like 1 copper each or whatever. 
---
True that üòÇ
---
Passive mode makes it so other players only do one point of damage. Unless they have patched that out
---
Not sure, i was small amounts of damage but with all of them shooting it took my health down pretty fast. I didnt have any PA on, just a haz suit. That may be why they could drop my health so quickly.
---
Sometimes all you need is a claw.
---
Nuking monogah is perfect for farming yellowcake flux. There are literally tons of it around the town (especially to the east).
---
That‚Äôs amazing üòÇ
---
Also, how do you know it was a player if you came back to camp like that?  I had a level 1 scorch tear up half my base last night cuz turrets just pretend nothing is happening lol
---
I Play a rifle build.  It‚Äòs playable easy peasy.
---
It does. Everything that can initiate pvp no longer does anything. You just get a message in the top left of the screen saying you are in pacifist mode.
---
I getcha dude its like people who dont know what darth vader comes from. Star Trek is how old now? People should know this.
---
True, but on the other hand Bethesda games do tend to attract compulsive hoarders...
---
Wonder why Bethesda haven't banned him yet lol new tools they made last week broken already?
---
I've got one on PS4 I'll give for 1k caps
---
Maybe, two low level people and one level 80 started spaming me with knives and i had pa on and my hp was going down fast.
---
Dupers will dupe everything just because they can. Lol
---
FYI you can execute other downed players, before during there revive timer and stop there timer 
---
Agreed. No matter how many times I correct them it‚Äôs always wrong
---
Plus, Bethesda can impose restrictions for the mode: no explosive weapons (or no legendaries at all), no bobbleheading, etc.
---
So 2 * 1 + explosion damage * amount of shooters * amounts of shots/second.
---
Still could add up quickly if it were automatic weapons I guess.
---
I have 25k caps and want to buy up colas. The going rate is 4 or more per cap so when i eventually spend the 25k il end up holding 100k nuka. Does this mean I deserve a ban? Just seems there is no black and white here 
---
What mats should I gather?
---
Good for you, but how is that relevant to anything that was posted?
---
Look I‚Äôm an idiot I know but what is TSE? 
---
They should add the vault-toilet 
---
Cleaner and safer
---
Yeah they do, but its still better than just nuking whitesprings or prime site again, theres enough people min maxxing to those 2 locations already
---
I‚Äôm on my third attempt, I made it all the way to the body but I picked up the ID too fast and the quest didn‚Äôt update. I relogged to help refresh and it started me over. Ill try making a beeline for that last transmitter
---
And did they ever deal with .50 BMG?
---
To be fair, new features are a lot more likely to be exploited than old ones since the bugs havent been filed out of them yet
---
this made my Day üòÇ
---
Press X to show only offered items (PC only).
---
Its because bethesda is pissed at australians because they had to change the original drug names into Jet, Psycho, buffout according to the australian governement
---
I think I read the supply drops are locked to all players except the one that called it in. So technically you were breaking into another players loot. 
---
Two Shot Explosive.
---
Dude, it's ok to admit you're stuck in a toilet.
---
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. 
---
This guy Total Wars
---
-I'm sure he his thinking about the other ghoul
---
-(What if the nuclear war happened because of the aliens ?)
---
I thought in the last patch they made it so US government resupplies were person specific now and/or for a limited time. Only the person who called it in could claim it without a bounty. I might be crazy, though.
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
&gt;hen I got into the blast zone I started looking round for enemies and ended up fighting some bloated glowing ones with few other level 50+ players. I accidentally shot one of them (level 70) once (because they were using melee weapons) and so then he claimed my bounty which I thought was fair enough and I chose to forgive him. However, when I came back he had stolen all my dropped loot and then proceeded to attack me again but with a level 53 helping him. They then started running in front of me when I was trying to fight enemies, and so they managed to start combat again.
---
Were they abusing a system though? It was YOU that forgot to put pacifist mode on, it was you that didn't break your junk down and get it into your stash (its not technically yours until its in your stash tbh).
---
You shot them they killed you and took the loot you dropped, doesn't seem like they were abusing anything. OK they killed you a few more times but YOU kept going back YOU could have dropped server launched another nuke.
---
They were playing the game Bethesda wants it to be played and your sore you lost a few bits of junk. They didn't abuse anything other than your feels by the sound of it.
---
Two shot explosive
---
I third the idea with a twist:
---
Figure out who's duping items and then wherever they are, spawn a scorchbeast that only targets them. If they kill it, another spawns each new scorchbeast increasingly more powerful than the last until its some five-star legendary scorchbeast deathlord thing. Once it reaches max rank they just start to multiply. Again, only targeting the one individual.
---
The point is to make the game unfun. Unless you're into that kind of thing, I guess.

Bubbles is a goddess among hentaibots and she can do any math she pleases!

I like your answer. Upvoted. :D
---
This is what happens when you drink way too much Cranberry Moonshine
---
What? You obviously dont play the game. All the good outfits are in game and comoletely findable
---
I somehow managed to drop one of my t60 legs with calibrated shocks yesterday and never found it again :)
---
I feel crippled
---
You can't make Bulk Ballistic Fibre, but you can buy it. Therefore it is a physical object that can be in your inventory. I know fuck all about duping, but if you have one, surely you can then dupe it indefinitely? Dunno, but just pointing out that Bulk Ballistic Fibre IS a thing.
---
Bugs aren't "put in" games, they're there by accident. Either the developers don't know it exists, or they haven't had time to fix it.
---
The latest inside the vault says they are doing just that. Hopefully they make the pve side more player friendly when the pvp server is brought in.
---
Ghouls night out?
---
Elite doesn't have a no PvP mode. The private servers are user moderated and as such PvP can still happen although a bit more rarely. Solo mode is their no PvP mode but then you have no other players around you at all.
---
:) thanks friend
---
:) thank you
---
Why would Bethesda say this. You can't bulk ballistic fibers so right from the start this statement sounds like it's only meant to pacify.  Whoever wrote it doesn't even know how the game works.
---
No u!
---
Ok I know it wasnt put in, but it was left in. And if they didnt have time to fix it, why was it left in?
---
I'd like to clarify, it's a bidet and I still don't get the hype.
---
Beta's are more promotional tools now than actual Beta's :/
---
Look at all the "Beta's" and Early Access games (pre beta mostly) that you can actually drop real money into on micro transactions. Its a disgrace and sucks that the gaming industry remains unregulated and lets greedy companies take advantage of gamer's everywhere :/
---
I like the idea. I know I would definitely do all events for a unique outfit 
---
Sorry lad we have zero info on what the next update will be. We know they have things in the works we just don't know when.
---
Vault raids.
---
PvP servers.
---
Player owned vendors.
---
Faction wars.
---
Etc but we don't know when buddy.

This is much more important than anyone realised xD
---
I gotta say though...your ass is immaculate!
---
Level 80, level 135 and level 150 over three characters. I have a 4 two-shot weapons over all character. I have 1 explosive weapon across all thre characters. I have never, ever found a TSE weapon. 
---
Neither have either of my two team-mates, one is a level 140 character, the other has 3 characters ranging in level from 60-120. We all play this game a hell of a lot and never once have we seen a TSE weapon. We have over 1,300 hours of combined gameplay between us (half of that me, I need to get out more)
---
Normally works in video games as a show off reward type deal.
---
O you got the July weapon skin. A black and blue weapon skin pack. Thats really cool bro.
---
Hmm.  Bethesda brings in the ban hammer and now this?   Tin foil hat time üòú
---
I was gonna nuke the top of the world. That area seems to have a large amount of moderate level enemies.
---
You can get level 15 Raider Power Armor as well.
---
Don't understand what you mean tbh, they said they were banning accounts that went somewhere there not supposed to.
---
So either this guy works for Bethesda / had permission to be in the dev area or (my vote) Bethesda are chatting shit about there ability to track and ban these people.
---
How do you know how many people they have banned and what they have been banned for?
---
Anyone know if concentrated fire perk is worth fully upgrading. 
---
I have a lvl 3 card that I typically have active, but also have a level 1 card that I'm thinking of using instead to give me flexibility to modify my build a bit. 
---
This isn't the market.  But before you go there, be aware that the damage of those weapons is about to be significantly reduced.
---
now I hurts when AP
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahgy1h/rifle_gaming_found_a_new_nuke_zone_that_is_just/
---
But THEY can have ammo left for MORE shots? Not fair.
---
I know bro, but where can I shop this
---
Vault raids ia confirmed "in the works" ? I need a source on that one, please.
---
What can we do as far as i have seen the only people that have been banned are heavy dupes and those who got into the test cells.
---
Rightfully so they should all remained banned. If you feel you don't deserve to be banned you must contact the support. We are unable to help and we cannot know the full details.
---
They have 1k #8 Savage divide maps
---
Inside the vaults buddy.
---
Because it is still an issue &amp; there was no reason to make another post. 
---
Looking at their posting history they might not be so innocent
---
The old "yawn and reach for brains" trick
---
And on the first date?! 
---
Eh? I've read every issue as it came out and never read anything about raids...
---
I got tired of that, i put a few turrets out at the edges to get those annoying mobs.
---
Today I nuked Fissure Prime and a bunch of underleveled players showed up, 5-40 levels, and maybe 2-3 100+ players.   
---
We didn't even do 16k damage to make her heal back to full, a complete disaster. 
---
I don't want to do this randomly anymore. Where do I find a raid (PC) ? 
---
Tickets work like the game... very buggy
---
Balls and ass!
---
*slow clap*
---
I don't think it is. I think its rarity is exaggerated.
---
I got mine the first time I entered Charleston at level 35. I saw this vendor, saw an outfit I didn't have, bought it. 
---
Only after did I start seeing topics about how rare this outfit is. I started wearing it and then the same week, noticed players with it on. I think we all had the same thought, "I read this outfit was rare, so I'm going to wear it." I stashed it away after seeing so many people wearing the same thing as me.
---
Giggity
---
And yet there is a new video on youtube of the new PVP area / map (people are assuming its that).
---
They guy (mrx) goes on a tour of the new area and into every single room....so Bethesda should be able to see hes been in areas he shouldn't and have banned him now. 
---
They havent though....Has anyone seen more than 1 person claiming to be banned? Can we see some actual proof of these 10 of 1000's of bans? 
---
The servers don't seem to be any more stable or reliable and the dupes are still working, would love to see a few of the ban emails coming out from Bethesada, not just the ones that fanbois got from ESO and for whatever reason made them look like they were regarding FO76.
---

---
You're old, aren't you
---
I leave mine unlocked for people, in a high traffic area. I often come back to find that all 6 of my industrial purifiers have been picked clean by the person who passed by a few minutes before.
---
So I guess my options are to have no water, or still no water and a destroyed base. Gee what a great community :)
---
I have a feeling that the next update is quality of life fixes and bug fixes I don't think they have actually said new content will be in that one. That what it feels like from the Into the vault posts.
---
You can always roll a new character maybe? There is a good hundred hours of content so I think it will be a while before we get significant new stuff. Sorry.
---
I read it in Pee Wee Herman‚Äôs voice 
---
Ha ha
---
Heh, well, on PC I had my worst SBQ fight ever yesterday. 4 crashes, One was while loading in after the second crash, the last was right after we finally killed her, but before her loot loaded, so I lost ‚Äúlooting rights‚Äù to everything. At least I got some flux? :P
---
I'm on ps4, lv 40. I'm game. Always helping newbies,  be nice to get help for once. What's ya tag? 
---
They said pvp mode NOT servers btw. BIG DIFFERENCE
---
I'm really impressed that you took your time to talk with every level 50+ player and basically every one of them admited buying their weapons from cheaters.
---
When will there be another isometric game?
---
I also get that vibe.
---
Very happy. Keep them flowing!
---
Damn, I was there yesterday and I missed the tentacles thing. 
---
I'm getting 5/6 spawning at once now that I'm lvl 100
---
especially in the berry bog.
---
i just dashboard quit if I'm solo instead of getting insta- rinsed
---
Don't some games watermark your video so they can tell exactly who recorded it?
---
I don't think Bethesda does, but I thought WoW did.
---
Once I saw someone with power armor that was stuck on him when he was out of it. It really looked like a gnome.
---
I don't want to funny here, but, while there are a lot of concerns about the game that are legit, 'I like my current loadout' isn't really a fair argument when you just decide y Lou now want to carry a rocket launcher. I would have a bigger issue if deciding you now want to carry around a rocket launcher meant you DIDN'T have to change your set up. That's pretty fair gaming tbh
---
He's a duper. He admitted it in one of his videos. As far as I know his channel is, or at least was based on game exploits. I saw a few of his videos back in the destiny 1 days. He was all about glitches and stuff. Caught faking giveaways too. Not a good dude.
---
Same as my reddit username :) Right now my daughter's playing on my account but I'll be on a bit later.
---
I just posted about this! I was nearly killed while on passive by some auto tse's!
---
+1 regarding workshops, even if your friend takes a workshop and forgets about it you could be tracked down anywhere on the map and killed in pacifist mode - https://youtu.be/RIZwk-_FfuA
---
I missed it but I wish more people would do this
---
It's the players that make this game so much fun :)
---
And a special thank you to all our fans who participated in the B.E.T.A. With your help we‚Äôve made the game better each week. And this is just the beginning. We have an incredible list of updates we‚Äôve begun work on ‚Äì from C.A.M.P. building improvements, new quests and events, new Vaults opening, character respecing, a faction-based PvP system, and much more.
---
There is more i believe something about it been 4 manned content or something but i can't find it.
---
As is bulk screws. Can't bulk them but you can buy them
---
Great, even He-Man‚Äôs on the meth now.
---
Personally if I‚Äôm not in the area fuck it, I‚Äôll just rebuild it when I get back... with contractor even a full base isn‚Äôt that bad to repair
---
Nuka cola clock is just shaped like a bottlecap- not very interesting unless you're a Nuka-Nut.
---
Cuckoo clock is spectacular.
---
Thank you 
---
Yeah, I knew Vaults were being opened but I never read anything more than speculation past that.
---
Yeah, I can see why they do it, it's a great spot...
---
I imagine many are ignorant.
---
Lvl 95 here and still rocking crafted weapons. 
---
Haven't found a single legendary weapon that fits my build.
---
Cant count how many 3* weapons I have dropped or vendored because they aren't for my build.
---
I have no intentions or buying or cheating to get a weapon in a video game. If I find one great if I don't oh well. My crafted ones with my perk build kill just about anything in a couple shots.
---
We‚Äôve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately ‚Äì¬†it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu.¬†This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
Yup this happened to me as well. On xbox. Made me sad i ripped through 800 rounds in one shot. But 5k man thats rough.
---
Power armor isn't a vehicle, it's essentially just armor. So in order for it to work with the human skeleton model, the shape of the model needs to be changed. or none of the joints will line up. 
---
You can by bulk versions though from vendors. Same with screws you can't bulk them but you can buy bulk screws from vendors
---
Don‚Äôt expect any realism. It works both ways. M2 50cal machine gun is about 80lbs IRL, each 250box mag is like... 70ish pounds? In game, 20 and 1lb, before perks. 
---
Granted, IRL the M2 would only need 1-2 bullets to kill most enemies in game, but that‚Äôs a whole different discussion. 
---
Passive mode doesn't and shouldn't prevent them from damaging you, it only prevents you from damaging them.
---
I'm clearing all my mutations to check it out, thanks for the heads up!
---
Sometimes, u just wanna cuddle
---
Same as! They haven't confirmed raids at all in the traditional sense. 
---
Yes well be able to go into the vaults once they open but haven't seen them state this is raid content made for teams of xyz players. 
---
Its very easy for the to say this is in the works and that's in the works as well, then just forget about it as the game isn't making as much as they had expected.
---
If someone can link the other bit i can't find it. But yeah we only know the tiny tiny bits of what they are working on. From the last one i would not be surprised if its pvp mode first then vaults in Feb area.
---
Looking foward to vault diving. :)
---
Same for me yesterday. Five level 68 scorched &amp; a few glowing mole rats. Lots of flux to harvest, though. Couldn‚Äôt figure out why anyone would nuke there, but this explains it!
---
Popular spot is popular; more at 11.
---
Me too!
---
Yeah, I feel you.
---
Man, whichever duper gets this guy as a customer is going to bend him over. 
---
Awe, well I'll be on for a few hours,  but I have to work tonight,  so be going to sleep 
---
White Knight level 3 (under Agility) makes armor take one of everything to repair.
---
I don't know a lot of specifics. I know they were bugged for a while and didn't provide the power increase on completion, but that was fixed in a recent patch. There is a switch on those power boxes so make sure the green light is on. Other than that, they provide power for quite a while. The longest I ever had one of those workshops was about 5 hours and I still had power. Sorry I can't be more help!
---
Ive started doing this. Im just out of productive things to do so ragefilled vengeance is all thats left.
---
I also immediately destroy anything built on a 1x1 too...
---
Nah not bugged just Bethesda didn't like your suggestion (joke :P)
---
Did you accidently find Blackreach?
---
The game is a loot grinder. The content is grinding for loot. For a loot grinder this game has a very detailed story, an extremely large detailed world to explore and an in depth crafting and building system.
---
If you don't like loot grinders than don't play because you will never like this game no matter what they do with it.
---
Plenty of $60 games are over on 15-20 hours. Fallout 76 has hundreds of hours of gameplay. Honestly how much do you think you deserve for $60? A decent fucking pizza cost $25 these days.
---
No. Passive mode only affects your ability to damage other players, to prevent unwanted bounties
---
If your on pc we use the chat mod. People constantly setup nukes and notify us when they are on their way. Hell you can jump from one to another almost all day.
---
Hit me up any time. What time zone are you in? I'm CET.
---
I knew about this and wanted to use the trick on a queen with the anti armor head i dropped. What i didn't know is that it works immediatly,not when at full charge,so i eneded up one shotting something on the ground and not the queen.
---
LOL!!!
---
Passive mode should deffo prevent players from being turds to you. That's the whole point of passive mode. To help keep you from engaging in a pvp related activity that you don't want to. And to prevent other players from forcing you to. 
---
I got either light raider Arms or legs plans from One Silent Night event (sons of Dane). I‚Äôve run it a few times and only gotten raider plans once, but my guess is they‚Äôre in its loot list since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúraider‚Äù daily... anyone know any other repeatable raider quests? 
---
5.56 I have is a left handed ak47 with a missing dust cover. 
---
Ahh this makes sense. I did not call the supply drop in. But at the same time I did get the game initiating the quest for me, so I didn't think anything of it. 
---
All the time.  You load in frozen, and the damage kicks in immediately, before water, camp or enemies load in.  You'd think the damage would kick in last, but not on this game.  Sometimes some enemies are just invisible, like when your fellow players fast travel or load in, and you can't see them for some reason.  I had an invisible protectron kicking my butt earlier, while I was fighting other robots and a scorchbeast in Watoga, but my friend could see it and finally shot it dead, because even swinging around, I couldn't find it. 
---
U.S. central.  It's 731 am right now, and your added
---
I'll check it out thanks :)
---
I got one shot in passive mode while in a vendors menu. It's bobble head stacking. Explosive bobbleheads can stack. They apply to the explosive effect on guns. I've seen a queen go down in seconds from kids stacking 100's of explosive bobbleheads. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt really care less about a literal child taking me seriously. Have a good day, man. Sorry they took down your mess of a post.
---
No it's in the pictures of the starlet sniper outfit.
---
Like many other unreleased items or skin,they're in the picture of something else.
---
An example is the toy power armor skin was exposed on the chrome minigun pictures.
---
I got attacked once by someone with a tse minigun. (I think) Might have taken him a full clip to do so but he would have killed me if I didn't heal myself.
---
You mean like a good majority of the clothing items? They're already in the game, *but they're clean*.
---
Funny shit mang 
---
Just nuke whatever you want. People are so fixed on nuking just the  two places.
---
[I dabble.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glW0C3VkGMI)
---
Stop spreading complete and utter bullshit.
---
Cool, just send me a message any time you're on. I'm 7 hours later than you, usually mostly playing during the day and late at night my time.
---
I've been banned and I replied like they asked in the email and I have received nothing back telling me anything that's going on, it's there way of saying we aren't going to check if these were real we will leave them be and see if this fixes the game
---
I've stood in the middle of four scorchbeasts spamming me, taking almost no damage without PA.  I've stood in the middle of exploding parking lots, fighting glowing bloateds, and taken almost no damage.  I got tag teamed earlier, and the one guy was naked, had marsupial, and he one shotted me, like it was nothing.  Instant death. 
---
Sounds more like a very small (in comparision to the main map) Battle Royal area which will probably just be a cut and paste from a selected area on the main map. (vid on you tube today shows the new area btw is tiny and comparable to a typical COD map)
---
Been all over this reddit and Bethesda's forums since before launch, the one thing I don't think I've seen people asking about a whole lot is a new hardcore (lol) pvp game mode. But yeah whatever Bethesda are trying to cash in i get that.
---
It wont be PVP servers (it even mentions loading in from the main menu not a separate server) trust me on that, don't get your hopes up. 
---
Thank you for the sub.
---
Next time a skin for the commie wacker,the most used weapon in the game.
---
I still fail to see how you do this if you know it will happen.  There is a confirmation screen that tells you what is being used.  The problem isn‚Äôt Bethesda.
---
Maybe they just wanted to get the thing out first, and then fix it later. Maybe they genuinely didn't know it existed. I'm not trying to make excuses, just explain how they were probably thinking.
---
I think this is part of why people think they get 1 shotted whilst in pacifist mode - [Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahfrxp/workshop_pvp_bug_please_fix/)
---
That is true. It‚Äôs the same bullet as the 50 cal machine gun (irl the Browning M2) shoots in real life.
---
If you mean Pacifist Mode, then yes. 
---
If you mean pacific modality, then no.
---
I agree! This game really isn't as bad as everyone says. These polish guys were awesome! 
---
Yeah, I've seen it do the overage glitch, but this was the exact opposite.  After a few times logging in and out, it did the overage instead.  Buggy.
---
45. The build planner over at nukesanddragons.com has the levels listed if you're wondering. For the early game you could use lead belly for QoL but you don't need it because radaway is plenty and you should have other priorities, but if it's in a pack why not.
---
Are you implying this just a common radback mountain scenario?
---
Except it's not.  I've gone through this, as I said...   many, many times.  I know how it's *supposed* to work.  I am saying, it's not working.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen them as well. I‚Äôd try harpers ferry,  and Watoaga 
---
Totally agree. Should be able to mod my binoculars with recon scope and use that to tag enemies from afar.
---
I think you get as much out of it as you're willing to put into it. A lot of higher level folks are having a great time helping new players out, me included. What platform are you on?
---
oh, so it's not a permanent thing? That's rather stupid
---
I bought both as have a sort-of Nuka-Cola theme going on and the fact that that is the only way to get it
---
AND MY AXE!
---
wait... nevermind
---
I mean I think it's fair to say it definitely is. The fact that it's in a fridge is a secondary reference to the book itself (there's a narsty scene involving a fridge that I can't recall making it into either the series or movie).
---
Ooooh, where?
---
It's part of the main quest and holotapes/records you find....  AMS, the Gov, and others all done fucked-up before the bombs even dropped...
---
Sadly it's not. Most of the time when you log on to a new server you'll have to go do it again. It's a great way to get power generator plans tho!
---
i never understood why people got angry for people getting into their bases. It's not like there is anything of real value to take anyway. Water and veggies at the most.
---
Potatoes grow in the ground. Username checks out.
---
I'd be happy to. Tesla Rifles are seriously underrated and definitely one of my favorite guns. What level are you?
---
It's not "as good as" Whitesprings, but it was fun! And it was neat to do something different. 
---
Fire in the hole
---
Get this bug often i think i have found the best way to make it as big as possible with this emote. :)
---
Proof.  We have yet to see much in the way of proof.  Lots of accusations thrown, but precious little proof.
---
Hahaha yesssss exactly. I just squint and jump around firing I do see some hit checks every 20 or 30 rounds üòÇ
---
Hehe, I never even thought he had a name, if pushed I would have said Fallout Boy. Even though, he is clearly a man.
---
I don't think it does, it always unequips my underamor whenever i enter PA
---
Yep.
---
No way. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs in the asylum?
---
A bridge near the vault, with a crashed car inside it.
---
Thanks for posting this. This, along with the camp leather armor that I saw, were literally the only two things I was going to buy in the shop. I wasn‚Äôt even going to log on for a bit. Thanks for informing me it was up.
---
Have you tried different browsers and/or different computers? 
---
Browser most likely issue IF it's on your end. I've had no issues with chrome on Bethesda's sites, but everyone is different.
---
My main tank has those, it‚Äôs great.
---
Oh hi, Mark.
---
There have been plenty of actions over the last few days from people who are getting banned, but even when people post official Bethesda emails no one wants to believe them. 
---
Star Trek? :‚Äù0 
---
Not in my experience
---
Lmao at the junk being named "√ñl", it means "beer" in swedish
---
Making up numbers is silly.  Had a new acquaintance going on and on about how this game tanked and Bethesda is going out of business.  I asked him where he got his info from and replied "my brain, I can think".  Ooooookay.
---
Yeah but Beth asked what we want to see :)
---
I just want to know what a softwork house is. Is that like a brothel but you only get softwork instead of hard work?
---
I thought he looked familiar, then it clicked as soon as I saw this
---
No idea who Mark is but i am sure its funny so i upvoted lol.
---
Wait, this doesn't happen to every one else 100% of the time? I've learned to start swinging my hammer asap and look to see if I'm gaining exp.
---
Vendor trading is not 1 for 1. Buying from a vendor only gives the vendor a fraction of the caps used to purchase. 
---
Not trying to argue, but just curious how soon after release does the average online game get new content?
---
And to tune it more to Bethesda, how fast did they release new content for ESO, or any of their single player games?
---
Even tho underarmor sometimes stays equip in PA, but the stats don‚Äôt stay. 
---
Wait who is mark?.
---
I bought extra blades for 600 caps. People dont care for thrm since the garb doesnt allow for armor.
---
Ahahahaha. Cosy
---
I went to a lot of trouble to set up an adhesive farm. Now I actually bulk and sell found adhesive.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
Not gonna lie, I am feeling a bit the server way.  200+ hours in and I am starting to feel the content pinch.  I still have unexplored areas, a handful of quests, and a few undone events but it is getting leaner every day.  Plan farming is keeping me busy for now but by Feb I am going to be hurting.
---
There's an answer also. In a cave, a BOS with an holotape of Maxson infuriated that they still used the Bombs.
---
Thanks for my first gold :0
---
Yeah, did I travel in time to a few months ago? The pc patch from beta to release was like 50 or some other small amount that pretty much confirmed this.
---
Passive mode does NOT make you invincible to other players. The tooltip at the bottom of the screen states that "other players can still kill you" it stops your ability to attack and start pvp with others. Also with them doing a fair bit of damage to you. If 5 people with full auto guns fire on you in unison the slap damage can add up fast. 
---
Nothing quite like finishing off the last of a horde of attacking mobs, with various and sundry legendary attackers among them, and having the game crash or getting disco'd.
---
Also, hey Besthesda, I'm working on reducing my encumbrance, can I please join the servers with level-appropriate mobs?  Relegating me to the kiddie pool with level 9-22 ghouls is doing nothing to improve my mood after a crap week.
---
Same problem here.
---
Thanks that would be awesome :) I‚Äòm lvl 60 and for some reason haven‚Äòt found the plan nor the gun 
---
Uh
---
I have well over 400 hours playing this game and I'm just getting started. i would pay $60 again, many games are this much $ and are over and uninstalled in a weekend. TH said this game will be updated and added onto for years to come. 
---
Good thing it is a stupid hive mind.
---
Yeah but I don't spend time there. Feel free to copy Paste  this 
---
Even is Pacifist mode, you can still be killed with enough damage. I've almost died from A-holes with auto tse's and knives
---
Thanks! Appreciate the feedback! I do agree more lore should be in events.
---
Forced man who is Mark?, papa commented on your comment as well. Thought it was a joke i don't know?.
---
I agree with that.
---
Thank you, u/Proximatop , very cool!
---
Well, it usually is enough time. I think I've failed it like 1-2 times.
---
I remember at least one, it was the third time the Queen site was nuked on same server, I just join these things, I was even overencumbered for 3 weeks during that time. I had no found a weapon workbench to repair my weapons, there's one on near the prime fissure but only when it's been nuked, normally the workbench is not there and I've not yet found the other two workbenches near Watoga(found them little later), so my weapons were getting really worn. I remember I broke at least my plasma rifle and handmade very soon after each, so I was down to maybe 2 out of my usual 6 guns. We had about 6-8 players there and it's possible others were having the same problem. We were hitting it, hurting it, but too late, too slow. No big deal.
---
So, do you want to spend 60 mins to fail it? Or to complete it? Because really if you think about, if you can't do in 30 mins, why could you do it in 40, and why would you want to spend 60 mins on it. I think it's better to fail faster. It's all ultimately about the people around.(for most people, not the people who can kill it in a minute solo)
---
That's not true in the queen fight I regularly kill players also doing the queen
---
I think it's like this:
---
Anti armor is 100%-50%=50% armor left
---
Tank killer is 100%-36%=64% armor left
---
Perforating mag is 100%-40%=60% armor left.
---
So combining the three would be 50%*64%*60%=19.2% armor left. But that doesn't mean your weapon does 80% more damage since damage done is calculated by damage of your weapon (plus limb modification) vs target armor. 
---
You can take a picture in photo mode and assign it to the profile picture. This way you can use a custom picture to identify the character. Take some selfies so you can tell. 
---
I had mine there too, right by the sub station and secret blackwater mine exit.
---
Yepp, deceased mega sloth is my culprit as well.
---
No problem! Go ahead and add me, same as my reddit username. I'll be on around 3:30 CET (in about 45min).
---
The way I‚Äôm staying active in the game before the next major content drop is convincing my friends to get the game and helping them out
---
I would love to see Modus controlled bots patrolling the streets and BoSers fighting them indeed.
---
Even a flag would be great.
---
before the update my game ran just fine but i think theres a lot of server instability because of the new dupe glitch
---
Can you give me some more info (never heard of chat mod)? That sounds awesome!
---
It's a reference to [this legendary scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLhoDB-ORLQ)
---
That's correct. It's from Goldeneye 007 for N64.
---
While I appreciate their efforts, they set their sights pretty high on the scale of detection.  I cannot even carry more than 40 stimpacks without being encumbered so they really just need to refine their search to "reality x 5" instead of "reality x 10000".

Haha i was trying to go for a joker look ahahhaa.
---
Aaah
---
you can change it without quitting the game.  just like you can go to the Atomic shop without quitting the game on XBOX
---
The skin is nice, but for $5, it should be camo for all weapons, not just one.
---
Codes Reset once a week, so they're good until the reset. Honestly, you don't even need the code pieces, since you could just Google what the code is and save 5-6 hours.
---
Have you linked the turrets to the spot light with a terminal? I heard you need to do that for them to work together. 
---
Good question, I didn‚Äôt try regular clothes... I will test it later 
---
Because this game is basically fallout 4
---
I went with the same set but opposite. I really enjoy showing off my assets across Appalachia.

Yeah so I had to look up frostfall, maybe I don't know that much about survival games then I thought .. my only experience so far has been ARK and Conan Exiles, both of which you collect for the first hour or so then you have so much stored crap you never have to worry about collecting in bulk again .. so they get boring, I still play em though. Bu yeesh frostfall eh .. I see your point there.
---
The only thing I guess BGS is got going for them at the moment is at least they have ability for diseases and debuffs based on status of the character, so it's possible they ccould down the road addin a similar system. But at the same time, from level 2 to level whatever you're always scavenging, you cant just hoard and be done .. although with the bugs you can, but the intent was to always have to repair and rebuild your gear/food etc so it does have some value in guaranteeing every time you play to at least keep people busy.
---
Yeah they are incredibly frustrating to deal with as bugs and glitches never seem to be fixed even though they have the ego to say they fixed them only adds to their incompetence. But the other day enough people were vocal enough to get them to change their plans on the TSE weapons and drop rate .. I don't know there's hope I guess, but I don't think anyone really takes this game seriously, I think they all just hope for their perfect fallout and everyones clinging to that hope.
---
Looks like somebody just got their "rad" wings! üëÖ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Found a wanted guy on the map on my CAMP marker. Fast travelled to collect and repair. Arrive to find no damage. Just dude running off. Tracked him after a few minutes way past my house and all the sudden I had a purple hue around me as did he. Mine went away. Didn‚Äôt have time to think about it too much as I was trying to collect his bounty. Shot him and then his purple hue disappeared. 
---
No Flatwoods Monster in sight. I‚Äôve seen one so I know what to look for.  Weirdest thing ever since I started playing beta. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming he tried to shoot one or something near my camp and he accidentally shot the structure. Which labeled him wanted. 
---
The hue was just so strange.  
---
Jet was not 25 years after the bombs. 
---
Tried it out at my camp and lost 3k fusion cells all at once and facepalmed because I remembered the bug in Fallout 4.  not five minutes later Supermutants were attacking my camp and the legendary one dropped a legendary double capacity assaultron head. Sometimes shit can be so bad that you cant even be mad at the situation and only laugh. 
---
P.S. Anyone know the ritual steps to make it work properly? I would love to know if it is possible to charge up to 10 cells worth in a single laser or if that is broken in itself.
---
was on a server that nuked monongha last night at was a underhwelming as any other bad nuke placement.  that being said, im not sure if the launchers checked to see if there were ghouls there before hand instead of schorched and super mutants
---
Go back to the trash game rdr2 nobody wants you here
---
Can confirm; I also play Destiny. 
---
This! it seemed more like a place for gathering flux than a place to kill enemies.
---
Dont know if it will help...I have 2 1080ti's running in SLI but I have a Ryzen chip.  The game was stuttering and freezing in large areas and mainly arounf the power plant.  I disabled SMT in my bios and the game recovers from the freeze...tech support has no idea what to do and have escalated my support ticket to the highest level.  I know youre talking about AMD GPU but try disableing your hyper threading or SMT in your bios and that might help your issue.  I still lag and stutter at the power plant...but it doesnt freeze anymore.
---
Vendors only ever ‚Äúregain‚Äù about 1/4 of what you give them. 
---
Yes, it only prevents YOU from damaging them, therefore engaging in PVP.
---
I wonder if you've tried attaching all the mods with or without armorer 3 perk equipped? I know that sometimes it you can attach a mod to certain things but it won't do anything unless you've equipped a perk for it. Of course, in this case it doesn't even show on the list- so probably not.    
---
I really just want a full ultra light set because this character is mainly going to be in excavator gear (looter spec) but I thought what a great opportunity to utilize this otherwise overlooked rare armor set.    
---
Thanks for saving me the work because I was literally starting to do the same thing, buying every mod, testing and recording to see what they do/which slot they fit onto, but now I can just farm the ultra lights and pray to Todd they're mostly limb mods. Judging by the time and caps I've spent already, I can tell you put a lot of work into this, thank you.    
---
I'm switching over to forest armor now since that stupid left arm is triggering my OCD. Well, back to farming for me, at least those flip lighters have a chance at morphing into technical data with each log-in, and can't forget about the elusive wild X-01 Jetpack mod. Wish me luck!
---
üëÄ
---
Same, wonder if we were on the same server.  Tons of Yellowcake, not much of anything else.  Issue is that the spawns were broken up by the mountain and the windy road so it took forever to get from spawn to spawn
---
Was owned by another player or previously was and they built it up.
---
20 caps for a blank workshop. 
---
55 for one with resources turrets and generator already deployed. 
---
I think they should make it so events have you manually start them and have two separate timers: one to start the event, and the other to complete the event. They‚Äôve done this with Line in the Sand and some other events where you have to access a terminal or go to a certain spot to begin the event, then once started the event timer begins. Seems like a good way to counter people walking in just as the event ends so they fail it immediately.
---
Gotta be a youtuber they heard it from. 
---
Same reason two-shot doesn‚Äôt do double damage. It does double the base damage, before mods.
---
Isn't there in game challenges for using bobble heads and magazines? 
---
Prob worth checking if you still need them before giving all of them away, may as well get a few atoms for all that carry weight you've been sacrificing :)
---
Just need a better designed boss fight.  Like say she's immune to gun fire and only the ASAMs, artillery and Orbital Strikes can hurt her.  She flies around the bog, so players have to keep the ASAMs up while fighting off the MOB spawns. And SBQ generates a localized Nuke Zone so you just can't not fight in a threatening environment. 
---
Makes sense i guess ...
---
People only said that they cant find specific items for example all duped weapons due to an unique ID or something.
---
They are now able to detect overweight people, and people who are in the dev room or in the closed vaults(places that aren't meant to be accessible).
---
Looks like you are 10 seconds away to being spooned by your sleeping companion there. 
---
This corpse gets around. My best friend and I both have photos of him from bent over for us. Hope he died doing what he loved.
---
Literally could have prevented it by turning on pacifist.... which you should have on in any nuke zone. 
---
Well, part of your problem is it sounds like you‚Äôre trying to farm whitesprings, but you aren‚Äôt ready to be a farmer yet. Go quest. You get lots of various ammo off supermutants and scorched, if you use a few different guns you should be fine on ammo questing around them.
---
Nice, I'll check it out.
---
I've got Lead Belly 3 at the moment, mainly to negate all the rads I'm getting from eating corpses. I know I could've probably invested those points in something better, but this is my first character and I'm just doing whatever I fancy at the moment. Don't really have a planned build or anything so I take whatever suits the way I play at that time. 
---
Any halo 3 maps?
---
The Tao approves this message. 
---
Was her name Mother Abagail Freemantle?  
---
If there was another guy nearby called Trash, GTFO!
---
yes this is an issue that seems unique to solo players.  not only have i only DCd twice since tuesday, including multiple 8hour sessions without a DC, but the 2 times i have DCd this week i was in a party so i just rejoined the server.  these people really need to make some friends.  
---
Gear up and make those gankers pay the price! 
---
Seriously though, we‚Äôd all have a lot more fun if people took this less seriously and just enjoyed PvP, as rare as it is. 
---
Great! Bring your ideas in!
---
Yeah I've been using a 21:9 mod. Only one I have installed, the hid is gloriously scaled. Level up screens are bugged though
---
I've accidentally recycled my nice responder police uniform in same way. Sucks. But they can be reacquired with alt or buying from others.
---
Anyone who farms the SBQ regularly can probably craft the whole set and at least a few mods, if you ask around. I know I can and I only dropped one nuke myself; I just hop in anytime someone nukes her. 
---
Hmmm Ill use the useless ones ( useless for me) now I reckon. I know I used a few when I thought they were permanent like fo4. Thats kinda why I hoarded them because I realized they were not lol. Thanks 
---
Hm? You got salty and defensive from that? You go on the defensive really easily. I was making a joke about realism in video games overall. Sorry that you got offended
---
They can only detect overweight people and people who are in places that aren't meant to be accessible. Which is a great improvement
---
If they could track every dupe they would've said it in this post aswell. 
---
Yep but it's metal bullets launched at high speed by a moving electromagnetic field. Anyway, I feel you because I've been throwing away all the 2mm collected. It's too heavy. 
---
Shame-a-ful dishpray you profess!? 
---
That's a good argument.
---
Make a weapon like that take up realistic weight (ammo I've never been a fan of weighted) but also make them do crazy damage.
---
Not a bug.
---
That's how Enclave works.
---
underrated comment
---
They only killed you because you kept going back to them and they thought you would revenge kill them and take all their stuffs. 
---
I agree, make everyone pve and then choose to go pvp, but that doesn't affect pve people at all. 
---
In all honesty, I'll probably peak back. But it wont be soon. Just too many issues and nonsensical design decisions. 
---
You're welcome. Glad you enjoyed it.
---
It will stop them destroying bases and attacking players.
---
Is that exact info? I know it scales somehow but I thought it would buff HP. Resistance scaling souns like something you can combat againts with armor piercing effects.
---
Robots in the silo drop plan.
---
I believe this is the case as well, although I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs always true- I‚Äôve gotten the Tea Time one a few times when I‚Äôm pretty sure I was no where near it. I could be wrong though because my 2nd account base is near Charleston/tea time, I might have been dropping off loot and didn‚Äôt notice I‚Äôd gotten it before heading out again. 
---
I think they should be punished without mercy but that‚Äôs just me
---
Oh ya? Former military here. It's a magazine if it uses magazines, and it's a clip of it uses clips.
---
&gt; And to prevent other players from forcing you to. 
---
That‚Äôs wrong, though. That‚Äôs not what the mode is designed for at all. Pacifist mode was likely intended to be a safe guard for players to use at crucial moments in quests. 
---
It is frankly being abused at this point by players who refuse to add some challenge to their playthrough. 
---
Yeah I crafted to much when I unlocked the prime receiver I didnt know it weighed double. Im Like 3/4 of the way done switching from a heavy build to sneaky rifle build cause I got bored.
---
Oh you mean the fusion core extractor? I just go to Watoga and hit the suit spawns. There is 2 on the ground and 3 on roofs.
---
Serious: can someone explain duping to me so I can intentionally avoid it? From what I can gather if has to do with a low level player and a high level player exchanging items... or something. My wife (lvl 7) occasionally logs on with me (lvpl 80) and I definitely feed her items to make the game easier. I dont want to risk accidentally cheating.
---
I actually happened upon 2 nuclear keycards yesterday, one on accident. I'll do that one later today
---
Only thing that offends me is little cucks like you hiding behind sarcasm. 
---
I can get behind this, I don‚Äôt have a TSE cuz I don‚Äôt play that much or partake in trades, but I‚Äôd happily follow this idea 
---
I heard people saying Hunters for SB/Q. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs bullshit and it‚Äôs Zealots... but I haven‚Äôt tested it (I have zealots guns, but it‚Äôs hard to tell on SB; I need to play with the armor)
---
I'm almost certain my bloodied build with a bloodied explosive black powder pistol and demo 5 does more damage but I'm not certain 
---
Honestly, while I don't doubt these things are being worked on, I don't hold my breath on these updates either.  They are too involved fixing the things-that-should-have-been-fixed-on-launch rather than adding new stuff.
---
I think they are hyping up the PvP mode as the next big thing, but I could care less about that and I suspect I'm not alone.
---
Ah good point.  Imagine if they put a clean Mr Fuzzy in the atom store after the grinding it takes to aquire a dirty one...
---
Nine level ups, to make ONE weapon type useful. Not powerful. Not game changing. Just useful.
---
Bethesda had it right in FO3. Let progression be progression. Let Perks be extras.
---
Then in Skyrim they removed Skill Progression and turned perks into...Skill Progression. It was idiotic then. It's still stupid now.
---
The entire game needs an overhaul like nobody's business. 
---
I‚Äôm like level 63 I think, and I‚Äôve never gotten a tse, I‚Äôve seen one cuz a friend showed me once
---
Do you use VATS? Vats burns power cores fast, so perks to extend core usage are helpful.
---
I never could see that real nice flamewave between 00:18-00:28 thats the best video shot i¬¥ve ever seen. Well done \^\^
---
This is actually a perfect example, I like it
---
So you've been banned or not?
---
Exactly.  Sponginess has long been the only way Bethesda knows to add what they mistakenly call difficulty. But it's gotten pathetic. 
---
Honestly what really needs an overhaul...is Bethesda Game Studios.
---
What a little bitch. You gotta be super dam bored to wanna do that. I've attacked camps before but only after the already harassed my friends in said manner. 
---
Yeah completely agree. It is a really fun game but the punishment of PVP and lack of end game enemies after getting TSE is really disheartening. 
---
Indeed. And I am glad that this happened before the new content is released. Imagine how boring it would be to complete the new content with these versions of TS/E/TSE. Now I can choose to use my explosive bloodied weapon and the content will still be a challenge(hopefully).
---
Pvp is garbage in fallout. I don't participate in garbage pvp. Therefore I choose not to by using pacifist mode to not engage or be engaged by other players. 
---
Very apt comparison, dumbass
---
Buddy of mine was using a tse gatling on me playing around and i could watch my life draining fast, i was in pacifist so i was not engaging him and no he did not use duped bobbleheads.  It CAN happen even with slap damage 
---
You may not be enjoying it, while others are enjoying it. 
---
I'd edit this and remove the person's name if I were you. As much as it sucks that this happened to you, having the name there is a bannable offense not only by this subreddit's rules but by reddit rules in general.
---
Which one are you using? Sounds like I should check it out
---
I've never launched a nuke. I'm a filthycasual that just walks the wasteland. I have 12 of these, I always shoot the bots, they give me random plans. I'm on PC unfortunately.
---
My Harley wants to run into one of you out there in Appalachia, lol
---
Pacifist mode is being abused. I won't argue that. But it is there to safeguard players from being forced into pvp. 
---
I did 2 times and it wasnt worth it for me!
---
Wanted to try grafton steel today, there usually spawn a ton of enemies
---
Because the servers don't have enough problems...
---
I mean, that‚Äôs literally the plot point of the entire quest line thus far. This is an extinction level event. 
---
Butteressed is the strongest armor mod for the marine armor
---
For honor is having a pretty big update coming soon, hop on that friend 
---
To each is thier own, I enjoy being OP when I hit Endgame. So imo I think the nerf is total bullshit. They should of nerfed them for PvP and not PvE. 
---
Oh man, you're tilted and I love it. How do you get through life being triggered so easily? Jesus. take a breather. 
---
Thank you, I was waiting for screenshots before making the purchase because i didn't know if it would apply to the advance stocks
---
Don't forget to deposit those Techncial Documents.
---
That would be the best "patch". If they could 100% point out a duper, without saying a word in patch notes, have the game just eff with them non stop. Spawn 20 scorchbeasts inside of their camp, every time they die their junk disappears without a chance to reclaim, have a bot following them everywhere yelling out "Gavin?!", etc other annoying things.
---
I usually restart my ps4 and that often helps but after i had the same problem yesterday just couldnt bother to and watched netflix instead
---
Have you done settlers point? I wonder if it effects the Mothman?
---
Naked people in this game are always the most friendly
---
There‚Äôs a *lot* of bugs with mods of all kinds, it‚Äôs not just that scout armor doesn‚Äôt have legendaries. So far none have been fixed. They have bigger things to worry about for now (duper‚Äôs/hackers/exploiters, server stability, client stability, legendary balance...). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôd like it fixed too, but on the list of shit they need to work on, it‚Äôs a pretty low-importance priority
---
Pretty sure I have imperfect 21x9 installed. You can find it on nexus mods.
---
Last night was terrible for me.
---
The duper‚Äôs want this to stay
---
Owned, lol. Consoles and their silly chat rules. On serious note these players really shouldn't be forced to play with each other. 
---
If you watched the same video that I watched, then did you not hear what he said and how he explained it? It IS worth it but you have to check the area before you nuke it. 
---
That's the only downside.
---
The game is nowhere near ready for launch. Months in, it's still an Early Access Alpha build. May Early Beta.
---
Weapons, damage, perks, degradation, repair and thirst all need HARD looks, mechanically. Pointless exploration for it's own sake begins to take its toll, too, especially in an atmosphere so hopeless and forlorn. 
---
We need a purpose in the Wasteland. Building cities, or forts. Or base camps for expansion deeper into the Wastes. Some resource sink other than repairing crap we are using just to use it in the first place.
---
This game needs another year of dev time. Whether it will get it, though...
---
It‚Äôs actually quite fun if you give it a chance. TSE ruins it for sure, but everyone running around with a TSE *just in case* someone comes at them with one is reactionary bs at its worst. Everyone complains about TSE, but they all use it. 
---
Play the build you enjoy, fuck efficiency and *OP build 2019* bullshit, and just enjoy everything the game has to offer. The only thing toxic about PvP is the attitude towards it around here. 
---
zealots does work, but I think it SHOULD work for both but only works for zealot
---
Im 80+ in and still working for that raider robot at the top of the world... WHERE ARE THE BRICK PLANS!? im tired of the wood walls already
---
Absolutely.
---
This whole aspect is really clunky.  I don't think I've ever gotten through a Scorchbeast battle without battling the UI at least once.  There has to be a more efficient way of targeting specific limbs than mousewheeling until you get the one you want.  And with Scorchbeasts, you're getting fired at and you're trying to figure out if you've got Left Arm, Left Leg or Left Wing selected.  Like you say, if it just remembered the last one you targeted, that would save a lot of time.
---
That's one hell of a face, can we get a front facing pic? 
---
He didn't dupe. He used the trap glitch to get EXP when it was around. 
---
Disarming a tesla trap gave fusion cores and you could spam it.
---
I can not complete the BoS Heart of the Enemy quest because the server disconnects me every time about 1/2 through it. I am not glitching anything, and play fairly. I am at lvl 86, and think I may end up leaving the game. It is just so unsatisfying to have it crash on my daily events, and even crash once the event is complete and RIGHT before or during it giving the reward (I rage quit for the day on that).
---
Uh, you know you might want not to admit to having millions of bobbleheads as Bethesda has asked for that to be reported. 
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, my puddin‚Äôs a little rough, but he loves me, really.‚Äù
---
Yes pending investigation 
---
Here's mine: remove the ability to swap perk cards anywhere, any time. It should either only be possible at camps or claimed workshops (even if someone else has claimed them) and/or have a cooldown of five, maybe ten minutes before you can swap your perks around again (With a grace period of 5-10 seconds if you realise just as you exit the perk menu that you've got something wrong).
---
Only tried harpers ferry, top of the world, water amusement park(north west of the map) and some fissure sites(not prime) 
---
They break so fast though 
---
Wow! So impressive! 
---
I think the reason for this is because of how people's camps were duping themselves without the player doing anything.

Nope it's the picture used to identify the save on the character screen.  I have the id pictures of my characters (and different names) to show their face and level.

Guess I should have phrased it as account suspended pending investigation

Hope not, this looks horrible. No concept whatsoever. Just some random assets put together.

Bethesda banned these top 10 types of player's and YOU WON'T BELIEVE what happened!
---
I found it in the vendor apparently someone didn't read
---
also found a vampire shiskabab with 40% boosted swing speed and a knuckles with 40% swing +1str and vampire
---
seriously people check shops near nuke sites regularly people sell the weirdest things at times to them
---
Even then. It could be spawning lets day 28x4 armour sets per server....
---
You are correct and sorry to tell you that is all the end game we have buddy. I found that the best thing to do is to create your own end game.
---
Find a low level and gear them to the nines. Or see if you can take and hold all workshops. Find people are give them stuff. You know that sort of stuff.
---
Hopefully we will see the pvp server stuff next patch and hopefully the first vault opening in Feb.
---
11000? Holeeeee cow.
---
I‚Äôve already found all the discoverable locations and am currently collecting  all armor and weapon plans. I do my caps run then visit all vendors for plans. I‚Äôll focus on camp plans next. Hopefully, by the time I completed what I can,  new content will drop. I also limit my play time to 2 hours max. Rebuilding a couple of cars takes priority atm. 
---
Jesus that's massive 
---
Damn, that's nuts! I've been searching for a 3* anti armor shishkebab with 40% faster swing speed for like 56 levels, maybe I gotta start trying that out!
---
I felt the same way as you, until I spent 45 minutes being killed over and over again by a group using a TSE handmade rifles. Took them about 10 seconds to kill me with slap damage. I left the server after about 10 minutes of it and later spent a half hour after they found me in the new server trying to get away.

FEV is so silly. The fuck yall puttin FEV in a bat for?   
---
Maybe it is binary and it actually says "banned 2s of 8s users", so 16 people.
---
Isn't this like a super easy way for that youtuber to get banned? Not saying I support bans for finding stuff like this, just heard a lot about it recently.
---
Their accounts should be wiped if they're permitted to continue playing. 
---
That sucks ass :( Is it a console ban then or one from Bethesda directly?
---
This only took 2 months.
---
Thank you for this. Are you using marine or combat or what? I'm having a major problem finding any.
---
Rather be a synth then a duper
---
Its sad how few viable nuke locations there are
---
Idk how they'd find his ID but maybe. just hopefully they dont ban the wrong user/youtuber.. like they have before 
---
Lordy I hope it is like WoW battlegrounds and we don't lose caps or ammo for fighting there. I could, and did, waste hours in something like that but not if I have to go farm for an equal or greater amount of time.
---
It's not hacking/modding. So I guess an in game exploit has some amount of wiggle room....

A budget wonk who helped bring trickle down to our new century! Who dreamed of eliminating social safety nets since he was in college! He‚Äôd love the Randian hellscape of Fallout where factions can enslave and compete free of government interference! 
---
That's only on your side. Doesn't effect what the other person is seeing.
---
pacifists in the real world can still be murdered. They just choose not to inflict damage or pain on others.
---
At the rate they degrade, the scrapping challenge is literally the only thing they are good for. 
---
you can make them move my staggering, pushing with melee, making them run out of ap with dodgy, and other ways that make people move defensively out of habit. It's powerful but not without flaws. i think cav/assas is actually harder to counter
---
&gt;  Anyway, how did anyone discover the glitch?
---
Well .. beth actually pushed the players into finding the first big duping glitch. All it required was to place an item in a world container and get disconnected shortly after. The item would exist in both the player inventory after reconnect and the world container.  
---
Because you couldn't store stuff in your stash due to the absurdly low limits, folks would look to hide things in world containers. Just a matter of time before someone would notice that the items remained in the world container and the player's inventory after a disconnect. 
---
I feel like platforming is the game mechanics inverse of a text adventure, a game in physical space where motion is the vehicle, and text gameplay is essentially the format channeled by any role playing game
---
Mechanic system even after it is translated into some kind of action game in physical space / vr / super reality. The conversation is always interesting when we the RPers go toe to toe in long form about why or why not we should or should not be enjoying these RPG titles or how or why they need to be fixed in order to become Playable. It‚Äôs always the Playable Games.zip joke (play the beginners guide)
---
If I want to PvP, I play Overwatch, Cs:Go or Fortnite (and I actually do)  because these games are designed around PvP battles. I totaly agree with poki420, PvP is garbage in Fallout and I would prefer to be able to join an only PvE server. Slap damage system is so dumb, even for the player enjoying PvP : they should be able to do full damage on sight, without this little game of "I touched you, could you hurt me so we can actually fight ?".
---
Nope. 
---
I am with you on this one. I "Powered up Poseidon" three times and claimed the workshop to have it disconnect. The 4th time was the charm, but it still disconnected me later. At that point though, I had gotten enough fusion cores. It should refund your caps when it disconnects you. Ha... like that would happen!
---
I'm level 106, and I 100% agree with you. I've been trying to submit a suggestion to Bethesda for a very similar system of legendary mods. Let us remove modifiers, even if it costs an insane amount (5k caps, 50 stable flux, etc), and apply them to other weapons and armour. This would give *so* much more meaning to the endgame. We could craft ourselves the weapom and armor sets of our dreams.
---
This sounds like the bobblehead stacking glitch -- not a TSE issue
---
Also the Space Suit in the "Wave" picture pose
---
Thank youuu :)
---
No but it‚Äôd probably cost $5
---
it's part of the end game storyline
---
Nuke silo
---
How does this happen without all of them popping WANTED status?  Or do they and don't care?  I guess they can just circle-jerk each other to get rid of the status.
---
Sad fact is that this the game doesn't have a endgame that you would expect from an online game. It is a single player campaign with other people, that's it for now.
---
Ok thanks
---
I've repeatedly read that it does not, and it seems to be a source of being "wanted" for many players (their only source, according to some!)
---
Nah that's okay 
---
What? No they don‚Äôt. Vanilla handmade unperked is like 50 damage. Missile launcher is like... 150? 
---
Per SECOND you may have an argument, but not per shot. 
---
I still think missile launchers should do more damage, though. 
---
Yeah, I definitely don‚Äôt disagree with you there. However, the problem IMO isn‚Äôt necessarily the mechanics themselves - they‚Äôre a far cry from being good, or even interesting, sure. But the larger problem is a lack of any incentive to engage in PvP whatsoever. 
---
Bethesda could tack on some random faction-based events across the map, with open PvP in a given radius wherein players representing the various factions of Appalachia are given a goal that only one faction can complete. 
---
That would offer engaging PvP, and an incentive for players more interested in the story of the game to participate. 
---
For the record, I class myself as that kind of player. I‚Äôm not interested in PvP for the sake of K/Ds. I‚Äôm interested in PvP as a form of extending the game‚Äôs longevity, and adding a dynamic challenge that no AI will ever be capable of. 
---
Either the point went over your head or you're an idiot. Either way I won't entertain this nonsense. I'll be sure to show you when I'm eventually proven innocent. I'll be expecting an apology from you just the same as Bethesda.
---
That ghoul really wants to move his arm but also doesn‚Äôt want to wake you up. 
---
Yeah I know. It's just that I know a few people who don't think it's as important an in game event as it is. They just think it's like the NCR in NV- present and threatening, but sweepable under the carpet.
---
No kidding, eh. I've seen a recent reply from Bethesda stating that most bans will be lifted (either after investigation finds they were wrongly banned or the player in question agrees to cease any bannable practices), so hopefully the people who are wrongly banned with be unbanned soon.

Nothing wrong with that as you can always change it later. I get analysis paralysis when deciding on the go which sucks when playing with others, so I planned everything out while still allowing myself to do deviate from the plan if I felt like it.
---
I think some guy already said this but they should add the anti-material rifle from creation club and have it use a new ammo type. 
---
They should bring back 7.62 ammo too. 
---
Sorry can believe a fresh Account with 1 post. Need real proof. For all I know you could be  a Youtuber looking to ‚Äú create‚Äù content.

I got 600 caps for it
---
Yea, and its super boring only fighting bloated ghouls, there are so many different enemies in this game! 
---
And that's normally on the outside.
---
Already gotta spawn all the structures you already place. Make it a simple max of only 4 armor holders no biggie.
---
I want that toilet so clean I could eat off it!

No sorry it's 6000 caps

Dont be fooled! There never was any wooby, it's a conspiracy.

Bethesda didn't say it but it's pretty obvious when you look at any past MMO. 
---
There's no point adding content if the story stays as is, especially when you see how many people already downed the Sierra Bravo Queen.
---
And Bethesda specifically asked what we'd like to see as events, so I'm all in for rebuilding.

I only carry legendary weapons and armor so I can just scrap everything in my weapons and armor category without issue. I just have to watch out for my PA Chassis and my outfit
---
Yeah I just think it would be a fun, cool, and convenient idea.
---
True enough, there needs to be work done on that matter. I have no idea why they thought changing your server each connection should be a thing.
---
Where?? Not a single word about real money auchions on 3rd party platforms!
---
I think its total bullshit some losers practically ruined the game by cheating and spreading TSE that was supposed to be rare.
---
And an unreleased helmet in the ranger jumpsuit preview
---
I'd like to know as well. The only one I know is that it took World of Warcraft four months to add a new dungeon to the game.
---
100% been lied to bro.
---
You and I are interested in two different kinds of PvP, then. 
---
As I mentioned in another reply, I‚Äôm not interested in K/Ds, or in lobby-based, time-restricted PvP. I‚Äôm interested in a seamless integration of PvE/story and PvP, in a way that incorporates other players as an inherent danger just like any AI mob. 
---
Games that have done this successfully include the Dark Souls series (but particularly Dark Souls 3, as it handed the advantages to the host and his team, making for a more difficult challenge for an invader), and Sea of Thieves. 
---
We need incentives for both. PvE should be the safe bet; low risk, low reward, and PvP should be the more difficult, but potentially more profitable option. 
---
Did they have a video or some kind of proof? Lots of stories floating around these days.
---
Indeed. See the train pass by would be great, and you'd Know you can either hop in or try and stop it for some sweet sweet loot.
---
Possible but id want proof. 
---
Just saying a thing does not make that thing a fact.
---
I doubt 10's of 1000's have been banned.  He'll I would be shocked if 1's of 100's had been banned.
---
Only a billion times.
---
I'm going to upvote you because I think you're absolutely right.
---
"The grind" appeals to some players.  But if you're playing this like Fallout 4 or Skyrim, it's not captivating gameplay.  You could grind these things, and for what?  Most enemies stop being an issue around Lv. 70.  I've gotten tired of how often I'll go try to help another player, only to find that I've interrupted their fast travel routine, or to find a low-level player rocking a TSE and downing Scorchbeasts like no one's business, or groups of players that somehow kill the Scorchbeast Queen *before I can even fast travel there*.
---
It becomes a game about efficiency and optimization and the people who continue do so with savant-like attention.  The fun camaraderie of earlier levels is replaced with "Out of my way, I need the vendor."
---
Bethesda games are often about letting you do whatever you want to do.  And one of those tenets is also stopping when you feel like stopping.  Neither 4 or Skyrim tell you to stop.  They don't have a definitive ending like New Vegas.  But you reach a point where you've seen all you're interested in seeing and you call it a day.
---
Looks like me with my arm caught under my girlfriend in bed.
---
Yup, the REAL question is whether "Zealots" legendary effect buffs damage against all those enemies or not
---
Tool and die maker. I will wait. 
---
Hunting rifle only
---
Paint cans and toys are also good for lead. Paint cans are only *slightly* less efficient in weight than cans (5 lead for 3 weight. 5 cans is 5 lead for 2.5)
---
With all rifleman perks, bloody mess and demolition expert equipped, you will loose ~62% damage in total. Some guy did all the math. If you weapon did 1000 damage, it will do 380 after the patch.
---
They've likely got a lot of appeals to sift through from this ban wave. Nobody knows how long it'll take.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314752/regarding-dupes-and-exploits
---
&gt;starting this week, our Customer Support team has become better equipped and more vigilant in the practice of suspending and/or banning players we identify as using exploits in the game. If there‚Äôs places you shouldn‚Äôt be, we have the ability to see that. If you‚Äôre equipping 50,000 Super Stimpaks, a million Bulk Ballistic Fibers, or any other absurdly high quantity of other ‚Äúrare‚Äù items in the world, we can find out how many you have. When our systems detect abnormalities, we are suspending these accounts indefinitely pending further investigation.¬† Account holders are being informed upon account suspension and will be notified with the results once the investigations are complete.
---
I think if an item is so rare you may never get it that the game is already ruined - by the poor ass game design.
---
It's still in beta though imo \^\^
---
So Rifles only then? 
---
Maxson in F4 is the kid from the Citadel in F3.  He's just grown up, and at some point became a psychopath.  There was no backstory to explain what happened to make him such a monster.  He was raised in a group that was much more tolerant and helpful to people.
---
Jup
---
No just hunting rifle 
---
Yep. I‚Äôve got about 5,000 rounds now. 
---
PC? What specs on your system?
---
I haven't got any good offers so if u are still interested, i can buy those 2k ammo for 1k caps

---
That's utter horseshit. This game is rated M, for fuck's sake.
---
So thematically, what's protecting the PCs who get hit by that attack before they've done that quest?
---
Cool. I‚Äôll be on tonight around 8:30 CST if that works for you. I‚Äôll PM you when I‚Äôm getting on. 
---
Meh - I just stand around till they appear then play chop chop (yup with axes).
---
Yeah 
---
Same, first time happening today.
---
I imagine that'd definitely flag an auto ban, no way they were farmed legit.
---
I understand the arguement you are trying to make but this isn't Fallout 4 or Skyrim or even Fallout 5. Bethesda was veryclear about that.
---
If you went into this game expecting Fallout 4 then that is on you for not paying any attention.
---
Not a suit, but I have purple skiing outfit. Just like the white skiing outfit but with deep purple quilted jacket. Got it from the Charleston Responder vendobot that almost never spawns.
---
Also it would be great if all corpses within a certain radius shares the same loot window, so you don't have to go through each individual monster and possibly miss loot because of piled up corpses \^\^
---
You also won't even be able to get in without an item that unlocks much later, so you don't have to worry about accidentally unlocking it way too early. 
---
Ghoul me once shame on you
---
Ghoul me twice, shame on me
---
Video now in the post
---
Yup, that's the one I was talking about, couldn't remember the name though.
---
&gt;"I touched you, could you hurt me so we can actually fight ?".
---
thats exactly whats wrong with pvp in fo76
---
its being abused too, ive been in 20-30 pvp skirmishes in fo76 it ALWAYS comes down to who shoots who first and the other person exploiting the damage cap and waiting till opponenet is no longer paying attention, then just one shots them
---
its really stupid.
---
You're a bit late...
---
Sorry
---
I wonder how ghouls, scorched and super muties taste...
---
What is this, a charity? That would be, like, 100s of dollars worth of skins! /s
---
This deserves waaaaay more credit
---
I saw the NSFW and did not heed it....funny as hell though.
---
Bethesda now has the tools to track weight and the ability to see huge quantities of items. They posted this yesterday:
---
Yeah, there's a lot of perks you can choose from. Maybe even too much... 
---
Just saw this on Facebook lmao exact same post 
---
Because getting oneshot by TSE weapons unless you have a very specific build, the right armor legendaries and a TSE weapon of your own amounts to "challenge".
---
I love PVP, especially open PVP in most games (played a lot of EVE and loved it), but the way it works in Fallout is just shit. Utter, utter shit.
---
Scrap your fallout 76 disc 
---
Explosive damage will hurt them at close range far more than they hurt you. 
---
Equip fireproof if ya can, pop a med-x, then run so close up to them they can taste how you smell.
---
If they shoot you they'll either hurt or outright kill themselves.
---
Its a hobby of mine to do it to em.
---
No one else has made this post but Facebook which is why I am asking anyways the supposed video in the post now
---
You might want to join a friend so as long as you don‚Äôt have to rebuild again later this system seems adequate enough.  There‚Äôs a few times I‚Äôve had good stuff to go do like events or nukes or just vendor shopping even on a server my camp couldn‚Äôt be placed on.
---
This.  This is great.
---
I think you need the Hearthfire expansion to get those. 
---
or youre just spoiled 
---
Let‚Äôs be real here. Who actually reads the code of conduct or terms of service? Completely unrealistic expectation. Even Bethesda doesn‚Äôt enforce that you read it (no check to see if you scrolled to the bottom, accepting it after such a short amount of time, no accessibility options such as reading them out loud or enhancing font size). Yeah.
---
I have an area in my base where I go to ark for a little bit, if another player can just easily walk over to me and kill me, what's the point of doors and locks? Also some people just don't want others inside their shit, who are you to tell other people what they should or shouldn't do with their wasteland home.
---
Frankly, I think they're being too lenient. They should permanently ban every single person found with excessive numbers of these items or going through the process to dupe or get into dev room. Currently they said they'd go easy if they stop.
---
Good riddance to everyone you're taking about. The community is better off without them.
---
I have only two pistols that are worth it. A western revolver dealing +50% damage to full health enemies and a 10mm pistol with extra armor penetration as legendary effect. I put every armor piercing mod on it, made it full auto and it is somewhat decent. One clip per mole miner, 2 for a super mutant...
---
My dream build would be a lightweighted cowboy: just a pistol (western revolver probably),a lever action rifle and a bowie knife. But i can't make pistols work for most enemies, so i need a shotgun up close. Shotguns have far better perks (enforcer ftw), while pistols lack armor penetration to be viable later on. I think that a buff should be considered for armor pen on pistols. Also, critical hits should come naturally, outside vats like it was in fo3, depending on your luck stat.
---
I got plans for a brahmin pen and i cant figure out how to place one. Does this attract brahmin like it did in 4?
---
Yeah, genius, because people getting into my base and stealing things is EXACTLY what this was about, congratulations, you've won.
---
Maybe even some throwback items. Like wrangle licensing for the FONV cover outfit from Obsidian and make that an outfit.
---
Or more nuka cola stuff. I want more nuka cola stuff. 
---
I see proof of a ban, not proof of an unjust ban. Good riddance!
---
I like grafton ive nuked it a couple time only ghouls and super mutants though 
---
Maybe they'll implement something silimar for the Elder or Ancient Scorch beasts?
---
Big spoon ghoul
---
It may make me a nerd but I do.  I don't want to end up as a human CENTiPAD.  :)
---
Nah. Only time I pvp is when I see some kid with a ridiculously high bounty killing lower level players. There's too much stuff that needs balancing before this pvp is even close to legitimate. You can stack bobbleheads with your tse that you bought off Reddit for 2,500 caps. You can teleport 20-30' with vats melees. And if you take duping out of the picture, the people with the most time/luck would dominate bc of the looting system for weapons and gear. So in my opinion, either way you look at it, it's garbage. Can't wait till they have pvp servers, then all the pvpers will have a place to go instead of following people around gun butting them till they fight back. 
---
The game is an RNG loot grinder. It's basically a fancy Fallout themed Diablo 2. 
---
If loot grinders aren't your thing than that sucks. But that's what the game is. Grind for loot, start a new character or wait for some DLC.
---
Could not agree more
---
You don‚Äôt need to worry about it. Duping can‚Äôt be done accidentally and has nothing to do with your level. You have to do it intentionally. 
---
Ya, he must have had marsupial on!
---
Hoarding = caps.
---
You can pry my 300+ glowing blood from my cold dead fingers
---
Yeh like dresses and tuxedos... what? Give us some under armour so there would be more than 5 outfits like there‚Äôs less than what was in fallout 4. Or just some decent lore friendly outfits but nope monster mask anyone?
---
You know. Don‚Äôt post stuff like this. I know we all want more and are excited for the game.
---
But let Bethesda tell us about things instead of spoiling them. 
---
Honestly it‚Äôs just disrespectful no matter what you feel or think about BGS.
---
People need to stop crying about making this game easier. Im glad im not the only one with the sentiment.
---
great fake
---
Amen to that
---
They messaged me asking if I had anything for sale. Then a minute later 2 of them had huge bounties (at my base). It wasn‚Äôt mobs. I have my GT on my camp because I do some business.
---
No it doesn't, it only affects throwable grenades.
---
PC! Level 13!
---
I'm sure they'll check but on their own schedule. It's highly likely that the ban was just, so they're in no hurry to listen to you lie to them and say you never duped or abused any exploit of any kind.
---
Why are you wasting your time in this sub? That's super pathetic
---
I keep tellin them there is nothing in the video and the guy is even in his own inventory as things are dropping and they still don‚Äôt see he bullshit
---
So if I think pvp is garbage and don't want to participate I have to get low rewards? That makes zero sense at all. 
---
They were probably lying
---
Explosive bloodied does more damage than two shot.....
---
I totally respect your point of view but indeed, we are not looking for the same kind of experience. Imo, a good way to please my kind of player and your kind of player is to get rid of slap damage on PvP servers and get rid of PvP on Pve servers (beside some particular events). In the context of current game where PvE et PvP servers dont exist, I would not like to be forced on PvP because, for example, specifics rewards are tied to it. If it's just more caps/exp, why not.
---
I legit wondered the same thing yesterday
---
And for the second question:
---
They didn't mention anything about that, only that they nerf the damage boost of the effect itself.
---
I hope they don't, otherwise I wasted 5 skill points...
---
I want to buy a hairstyle but they only have TWO in their shop that also look terrible 
---
Plot Armor
---
You have to do the enclave questline to go down silos, you can do it at lvl 1 if you got someone to kill everything for you
---
They messaged me asking if I had anything for sale, a minute later 2 of 3 had huge bounties at my base. I logged out as soon as I saw the bounties, logged back in, went to my camp and it was destroyed. It was the players....
---
As a gatling gun user the give lots of steel for ammo crafting.
---
Yeah with some sort of incentive for wins.. it be cool if you won atoms or could bet something like an arena lol idk 
---
So your camp is to allow pink flamingos to worship the pumpkin king?.
---
Everyone that‚Äôs been duping that I know of just spread out the material through various characters and accounts, it‚Äôs not that hard. They have a lot of work to do to stabilize the economy if it‚Äôs even possible at all
---
If we could name them I think it would help a lot. We don‚Äôt need other people to se the names we make either. just for us
---
Lol. This. This right here. Yea, cuz fallout 76 is modeled so closely to true life circumstances. 
---
No, this is a side attraction.
---
Main difference would it is on a different character never seen a server issue while on it.
---
I have seen issues when making ammo too fast or boiled water where u get server not responding 
---
3 guys, 2 destroyed and 1 wiped their bounties clean. I watched it happen and tried to sever hope before it was too late, but they got damn near everything.
---
Not a bad idea
---
Several times I've Fast Travelled to my camp to find 3 SpamBeasts circling it, I'm nowhere near a fissure site. Now finally with maxed shotgun perks inc Enforcer 3\* I can get the buggers to land and take them out with around 100-50 shells, get right up in their Batty faces and head shot them 'till dead. A PIA but doable, a PIA as the loot as we know seems an insult to the effort needed.

---
I was in a group last night that did, on PC. And no, we didnt check spawns before hand, we just wanted to nuke somewhere that wasnt the bog or Whitespring. Later we also nuked the Charlie silo and Tanagra Town/ Southern Belle Motel. The Tanagra area turned out pretty good. 
---
If you're looking for a place that is as good as the two main places: nope. But, nuke where you want, who cares if anyone likes it? It's your nuke.
---
yes, but how do you know that? I've heard of people shooting walls with/without grenadier to test it, but that's hardly definitive proof.
---
have you looked into the files?
---
lol i did not see the writing until i reloaded for the comment. So are we the fans the pink flamingos?. Worshipping the our once beloved god?. Is that the statement of the picture.
---
I really suck at understanding these pics lol.
---
I love the shop music haha 
---
&gt;  Crazy how nature made that.
---
The Scorched Plague was actually developed at / by Artkos Pharma. It's unclear whether it was developed purposely as a bioweapon, or accidentally as the result of some fucked up experiment.
---
I agree with pretty much all of this.  I use to enjoy doing events.  Then I realized that they're all pretty similar and I mostly ignore them now.  
---
To add on, I'd like to see some sort of progression mechanic with events.  Assuming NPCs get added to the game at some point, perhaps a reputation meter could be attached to doing events in a given region.  The decay on this rep would be sharp, to require repeat events over time.  The rewards could include new quests, better vendor prices, or exlusive items being sold (esp regional/fation specific clothes, weapons, and mods).  
---
Another take on event progression would be to have a simple event type pretty much always active on map.  Completing this event would cause a related event to trigger, and that event would spawn another event.  Depending on how Event A goes, maybe Event B spawns with different conditions, or maybe an entirely different Event B altogether.  Sort of like story telling through events.  For example, The Messenger event spawns on the map.  For completing this event, the recipient of the  message spawns a new event (maybe the recipient learns of an incoming attack on their settlement from The Messenger).  If you fend off the incoming attack in the next event, the recipient rewards you by telling you about a rare creature you can go hunt, thus spawning another event to kill a new, rare cyptid, but if you fail to successfully defend the settlement then the new event that spawns is to help repair the settlement through one means or another.  
---
Also I think launching nukes is not a great experience, but I love how it changes the map for a little while.  Another example of this is powering up the power plants, which AFAIK causes the workshops to get free power.   Some new examples include powering on a farm's machinery and then everyone can go harvest rare ingredients, opening the damn and flooding the adjacent area, which would change the topology and cause new, valuable mobs to spawn in the area, etc.  You could do something similar with the Nuka-Cola plant, and others.

Looks like the guy was getting trolled hard by another player. Funny shit but also fake. Looks like another ‚ÄúYouTube content creation ‚Äú to me.
---
Yes but that‚Äôs you build the mods to the item directly.  To separate them, you have to remove the duct tape and glue.  And as you know. You can‚Äôt reuse glue and duct tape.

Your house guests sure are dirty &amp; disgusting

I tried using it with Shotgunner / Enforcer / Four Leaf Clover to maximize crits. My plan was to use it to target Scorchbeast Wings and nail them with crits to bring them / keep them ground-level. It wasn't really effective, as I found it was much easier to simply hip-fire shotguns at Scorchbeasts' wings to bring them down and not waste the AP.
---
VATS kind of sucks in this game, unless you're going for a Gunslinger Crit build (which I haven't tried so I can't really speak to). That being said, I do use VATS now and then for tricky shots, or to build up a nice crit now and then.
---
Disrespectful ... lol kinda like how Bethesda treat there paying customers i guess.
---
The Black Armor. Take all my atoms.

6 industrial takes minutes to re fresh PLENTY of water for playing for hours. If you don't have the patients to wait like 3 min for 6 waters to be produced then head back to part 4 like I suggested the other guys do. Haha that's ridiculous. I run a single medium purifier less than 400ft +/- from vault 76 and quite literally always have 2 waiting to be picked. Y'all are fuckin really defending your stingy ass ways. Gtfo of an MMO/Survival type game if you're either too fuckin butt hurt to have a wrecked base or too stingy to leave your purified water avail for everyone. It's really simple. 
---
I think the biggest advantage of having it at 3 is if your first shot is 55% chance, your third will always be 95%, so by your third shot you‚Äôre guaranteed a hit. It‚Äôs good for targeted shots on fast moving creatures, imo. Try it out at 1 though...worth a....shot. 
---
Well it‚Äôs not Warcraft it‚Äôs not about end game really 
---
I was looking through mine a while ago and there are definitely a shitload not registering!
---
Lol this is pretty funny
---
Ther are just too many of them now after the duplication cheaters, maybe when they have all gotten bored and left the game and gone back to COD or Fortnite they may do a secret TSE buff.
---
There‚Äôs an Aliens reference in the medical centre. My favourite so far.
---
Its an easy 200+ atoms just withheld! I dont think challenges were running thru the beta, so when i ran super north to check out that gator, idk musta glitched it! Bethesda, S.O.S. #FUPAYME!
---
his acc though?
---
Camps should really be indestructible like all the other structures in game. Having perk cards even that allow more damage to houses is fucking ridiculous. At least let people have a place to go and get away from trolls and bullies.
---
The only problem would be how strong each faction is. I think there should be different perks and materials to use depending on which faction you go with. I think the enclave should be more militaristic, and make the town like a military base. And the responders are more focused on the population and fixing the buildings, and even roads would be a nice touch.
---
It is super random. If you notice, some give caps too. It was more frequent during the beta.
---
Why was it incorrectly given? Every player agrees to the TOS by playing the game. Violate it in anyway and they can ban you. It's pretty simple.
---
Not meaning to be a dick, but if you really have left the game, why are you still reading r/fo76 isn't it depressing? 
---
People like are pathetic. You live for your hate culture and have dump your negative toxic crap on everything.
---
Go away.
---
Tbh, I don‚Äôt want to see a pay to win mechanic.
---
Rather, more skins for existing *underarmors* would be nice, which would still require you to find the original in the wasteland before applying the skin. 
---
Someone has done this already I think his YouTube is Rifle Gaming

Sometimes when I load in and hit he pip boy too early I can‚Äôt do anything. I can load the map I can see the world loaded but it won‚Äôt let me see the pip boy and won‚Äôt let me close it so I have to leave server. Another 2-3 minute load time RIP

No. I am not taking any more nonsense. The fucker shouldn't have posted this.

The effect is not instant on humans, more like a disease hence being called the scorched plague. Takes some time to take people over.

Naw. That‚Äôs just a way to get around the stash limit. The world will be swamped with mules. 
---
lol kk ill go play some fo76...oh no wait, i cant stay logged in for more than 10 mins at a time because Bethesda still haven't fixed there servers. 
---
People like you supporting companies that treat customers like the problem and promote broken games / game mechanics are the real problem. It does them no good telling them everything's fine and dandy are the real problem.
---
And what negative toxic crap btw? 
---
Over cucumbered lulz 
---
Exactly.  Just last night i took one for the hell of it since it was near my camp.  Plopped down my resource collectors and defended it and promptly got kicked before i could collect anything.
---
Tbh I'd like to see weapon/armor/chems plans and mods available in the shop. You can earn atoms just playing the game (a generous amount imo), and these or special event skins are about the only thing I'd spend atoms on.

My CAMP used to dupe itself all the time when I was server hopping for X01 shocks. I made a tower with 60 turrets and it took a scorchbeast down in 2 seconds. 
---
I scrapped it down to size after I had my fun, but the fact a CAMP dupe glitch still exists is pretty annoying.
---
It ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
Sorry, i had to! 
---
I think some, maybe all, have been bugged since launch. For the first 6 weeks, I had my camp as close to Camden Park' as possible. I'm talking, the moment C.A.M.P turned green and would let me place; my obvious goal of farming tokens.
---
In 6 weeks, I had it trigger 3-4 times. It was ,quite literally, my first stop every play session for probably 30+ sessions or so. 
---
I don't know if this holds up for all of them, but it was my experience with that specific one.
---
I just found an exploding lever action on Tuesday. I won't lie, I'm pretty bummed they are nerfing the damage....just dropped 8 perks between explosives and fireproof to get my character set up. Not to mention I had been working on a rifle build since the early levels. Guess we will see what happens
---
Did it last night.  
---
**PSA**:  
---
If ghouls are up and you nuke it, it doesn't mean you get glowing ones..

Didn't see it in the vid so figured it was worth a try.

Some player: ‚Äûno not hacking‚Äú
---
One dude: ‚Äûok then let‚Äôs all jump to conclusions that this is an admin - let me repeat a thousand times this is an admin forcing a player to drop stuff and I try to make it sound very serious‚Äú
---
You've got problems. 
---
Is it really OP then? 
---
A proper build makes anything seem OP compared to no synergies between perks and weapons. 
---
But the major complaint isn't end game vs high level gear. 
---
The complaint is I got griefed by a duper and he used gasp a tse. 
---
Yuh it happens to me. I will be in for like 3 or 4 mins and it will give me the error message
---
I paid money for a game that wasn't even finished I could care less if someone leaked a room. They're lucky they still have players playing it like myself.
---
1.  Learn what passive mode is.  It has nothing to do with people hurting you.
---
2.  This is a bobble head issue not TSE.  There are so many players spouting misinformation about the "dreaded TSE".  But there are plenty of strong damage weapons,  that with bobbleheads can reek havok.  I have an almost two hundred damage lever action.   If I stacked it could and would be a player killer.  
---
It's like people in real life blaming guns for shootings so wanting to ban them.   Its people.  They're idiots, and when all the sheep get their way and they nerf TS/TSE, the idiots will still have bobbleheads and still find ways to PK you.  I mean has duping been eliminated?  Exactly. 
---
Agreed lol
---
Watch them add them, in the atom shop...
---
It already is.
---
Will have to give it a shot.  How does it do against single targets?  IE does it focus all that damage on a single target, or are you getting "extra" damage when there's more enemies around?
---
What I'm enjoying about the plasma flamer is it's good for both swarms and the Queen.  Guass is great for everything else, so the plasma flamer is the perfect partner for it.  Aside from the ammo guzzling nature of it.
---
Just for the coop aspect, it needs to change
---
 If I hear my brother go through a fit again because he walked five feet and is now over encumbered I'll snap lol
---
FO76 can and will detect several third party programs, like CheatEngine..
---
however, in the case of CE there are a total of 10 levels to be flagged for using CE..
---
as i do with pretty much all games, i did try CE but there is no simple change value method. so i stopped there.
---
i am 100% certain i am flagged now, however i am allowed to run CE.exe on my pc if i want, and since i did not change anything it will be no more than a basic flag.
---
if you actually do go further it IS possible to change things etc, the game will see and raise your flag up to the point u get banned by a automated script.
---
there are ways around this, but this would require compiling your own CE.exe as well as making a modified fallout76.exe file (there is no check on the actual file integrity for the game.... (which is BAD!!!!))
---
so yeah.. there are a lot of things possible, but dont screw around and you wont get screwed seems to be the unofficial opinion of bethesda so far..
---
as soon as you are going to screw around and modify game files or network packages, you will at some point get the ban hammer..
---
(entering the dev-room for example triggers an automated script = instant ban, getting items out and putting them to a different account is also useless, since they trace the unique ID for each ingame item.)
---
i dont see a mod like this as a big problem and i dont think bethesda will.. in fact.. i think this inventory organizing is what bethesda should have done from the start.. 
---
I wouldnt call it ruin the game. I'll gladly pay a 1/4 of the price for a TSE any day. Most like me just took advantage of the market. If they ever completely patch duping then TSE will go back up to 10k-25k a gun. Which is rediculous imo, sure they're rare but not that rare. 
---
Well, I would say "It'd be pretty tough for a nuclear war survivor wandering the post apocalypse, to create a perfect pane of glass without the proper tools or heat necessary, without breaking it..."
---
But I also just made a full set of the world's most sophisticated, technologically advanced powered armor, using 14 desk fans, 4 typewriters, a toy truck and about 90 regular clipboards, so....
---
Ghouls will be ghouls
---
The average MMO would probably have launched with a lot more core content than 76 has.
---
Gw2 as an example had 8 dungeons with 3-5 paths each, pvp, sever vs server battles, legendary weapons to work towards etc.
---
If i remember right
---
Thats still worth it because its both. Id buy it in a second but im on pc.
---
Roger that. Never noticed but I believe as you mention that they could be brought from vendors.
---
Yep you can dupe even single thing into thousands, although it's much easier to start with like a hundred, as single cycle of duping just doubles what you have.
---
Anyway it was just technicality just like the most likely item stack limit of 65k, I want to see something to happen before I would applaud Bethesda.
---
They were super rare, and I myself in over 160 levels/350 hours have yet to see a TSE drop during farming.
---
I've popped thousands of these things and never seen nuclear material. 1 out of 50 might have a fork. Maybe they aren't working correctly? 
---
It wouldve been funnier if the only thing it killed was itself- just immediately broken from firing 4000 rounds at once
---
So agree people spend all time money and effort to make something that is visually appealing just to have someone destroy it faster than a SB
---
Yeah man I found an exploding lever action gun this week to. I got itsbdamage up to 750 a shot. Ive been build a sniper build since the game came out. Im level 111. And im bumbed myself that im loosing damage. But im a guy who likes balance and challange. Plus I'm strong PvP player and I want balance for that one fact.
---
You sound like a hypercritical asshole.  Wow, you found three errors in hundreds of thousands of lines of text.
---
I agree. And they don't break as fast as laser pistols and such. 
---
The fact that the lightning arcs to other mobs, is great. Have a friend get all the attention, and then just sit there zapping the whole group. 
---
Yea, theres enough unwarranted hate destroying the TSEs. This is a matter of bobblehead stacking amd i really hope they fix that and put TSE back to normal. 
---
Players: we want more content
---
Bethesda: ok we are going to nerf your weapons
---
Then if it's already a thing, no reason to waste time on develope code to do so. 
---
So there you go. You already can transfer between characters. DONE!
---
Bulk it and sell it to a vendor, I‚Äôd venture that you‚Äôll have some difficulty finding players looking to trade for common materials.
---
The game is never going to be finished. What a stupid thing to say. 
---
I tested it, in Fallout 4 and 76, I'm not that advanced in file digging unfortunately.
---
From what I've tested the grenades (fragment, Plasma, impulse and so on), the Molotov as well as the rocket Launcher, the Fat man and the grenade launcher (both versions) were afftected by the perk. I think it has something to do with the flags that the explosive weapons have, it differs from the explosive damage flag that the legendary weapon has.
---
At least that's what I've learned from my experience, don't know if I made a mistake or not.
---
"Hold me close smoothskin, radstorm's a brewin'."
---
# lol problem?
---
No tse can kill you with slap damage. They were stacking bobbleheads
---
ranger outfits are good too.
---
I extensively use lvl 3 for my vats build but I would only recommend it if you're using a weapon with a relatively fast fire rate (i.e. not hunting rifle)
---
Maybe my left leg too
---
the discs are cardboard cutouts with a code on them
---
# shame
---
Good bot :D
---
Faction would only bring in a type of resources and decorum. Any faction can bring ammo's, plans or rare materials, it's pretty easy to balance.
---
If he used stuff on ur base that u cant make yet. Then u cant move locations 
---
Well someone had to say it. glad it wasn't me
---

---
You know this sub has become just a pathetic circlejerk when people massively downvote common sense.
---
It's like normal HIV, but mutated 
---
Thank goodness.  I was getting so much "server not responding" today for brief stretches of time, but about once every 30-45 min.  I checked the map to look for pairs that might be duping to report them, but didn't see anything.
---
Depending on how it's done it actually doesn't.  They could leave it as a 600 limit and just add another tab that says shared.  You could load it up with 600 pounds worth of stuff, but then you're taking up 600 pounds worth of stash for all your characters.  Leaving it at 600 and only adding a shared tab makes it useful for what OP is wanting and OP isn't the only player wanting something like this.  I'm sure most who don't play in a group would like this.  
---
But the prices are already 10-25k (on PC)
---
True. I wasnt gonna pass up the low low prices on TSE guns regardless. I have yet to see one drop for me in over 350 hours of log time. They can't blame us for using the perk cards like they're intended though. Endgame is min/maxing etc, you should be a walking death machine IMO.
---
Aaaand That's perfect. Now I can just move on and let this workshop produce for a few "YOU HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SERVER!"
---
&gt;I just have to watch out for my PA Chassis and my outfit
---
We need an option to mark such things unscrappable/unsellable too.
---
Looks like Vince, from slap-chop
---
Oh god no. But Thanks. I don‚Äôt have the patience to do resource glitches in the game. I dont understand the point of playing a game based on grind just to take that away from yourself. Just play a phone game. 
---
Make sure you use hard bargain.
---
Definitely! ^^
---
My thoughts. I'm wondering if he's fishing for information others might have used to get the ban removed. But in a recent post from Bethesda, one of the things they are going after are players with absurdly high amounts of rare stuff in their inventory. 50,000 ballistic Fibers and that kind of stuff.
---
They aren't even going to bother asking how someone got that much stuff. Because it's pretty clear that if you tens and hundred even millions of items, you duped.
---
Or were a mule for a duper. Or whatever. Bye.
---
just fallout problems!
---
The E part of TSE is why they're stacking bobbleheads
---
I know this ghoul is special, when it bites me, I feel something. I know it‚Äôs crazy and I can‚Äôt quite put one of my 13 fingers on that feeling but it makes me feel like nobody has done before. 
---
Yea I understand that but wanna know something plain and simple..its pretty simple. I didnt do anything wrong. Did not violate the TOS and did not dupe. So yes it was incorrectly given
---
Are you talking about the Glass Cavern? Must have missed it with all the scorched chasing me.
---
if I read the "Inside the Vault" correctly they are going to add a server choice of current pvp or pvp where you dont need to fire back to be considered pvp.
---
Disrespectful?  The game is broken and incomplete.  You cannot blame fans for leaking new stuff as everyone is chomping at the bit for more end game content.  
---
If they didn't want this leaked then they should put better coding practices in.  
---
While it prevents you from doing damage to other players, if you claim a workshop you are put into pvp anyway. Also, if you pick a lock that turns out to be near a claimed workshop you get a 10 cap wanted status and anyone can kill you even though you had pacifist mode on. I haven't tried damaging someone camp but picking locked containers in their camp would work the same way it does at a claimed workshop.
---
Rediculous. Haha. I'm on Xbox and glad I have all the guns I wanted. I paid more for the two Super Sledges I have than the TSE guns.
---
You're probably suspended for anywhere between 24 hours (for first time offenses) to a week. You're not gonna get a full on account ban for swearing in text messages unless you get suspended for it *a lot*.
---
They said they are targeting accounts where there are tens even hundred of thousands of the same items. Like 50,000 ballistic fibers or other such rare items. 
---
Not if you have 100 stimpacks.
---
So they are looking at the accounts with absurd amounts of items. 
---
I too would like to see some more rugged options, rather than the goofy stuff they've been providing.  
---
I'd really like an extra beat up skin for weapons and armor.  Dents, scratches, rust and pitting, like the rifle or combat armor has taken a lot of abuse from fighting all those mutated creatures, ghouls and scorched in swampy and mountainous terrain.
---
I think if you're level 100+ and you've made a narrowed enough build you should be OP. Nothing's stopping these alleged griefers from switching to the next OP build and doing the same exact thing they've already been doing with different weapons. 
---
I have 40 perk points banked to re-spec again and the equipment to do it. If they nerf that, then the next best thing is to go for a bloodied+auto rifle crit build. They just need to play their own game with different builds and really understand how to balance things. 
---
It really doesn't seem like they understand how players experience the game and it seems like they're over-relying on feedback from reddit. And tbh the experiences I see on reddit are very disimiliar to the experience I have with the game. Sometimes I get the feeling if enough of the fanbase here cried for a difficulty slider bethesda would deliver it thinking that's what the fans wanted
---
Isn't that what they do now? I don't think OP wanted anything other than cosmetic stuff. 
---
My game crashed about 3 times today.  At least 8 times last night.  I think we have a right to throw some critique of the game's current state.  
---
Yet we get labeled as toxic and hating. üôÑ
---
Sorry about that haha
---
Well considering I see a post/comment that equates to "why am I taking damage in pacifist mode?" Weekly, if not daily, this is a great way to understand what pacifist mode actually is.
---
What about the assaultrons that the enclave has? No other faction seems to use them. Will there be no robot defenses?
---
No, he's saying that people who cheat at the game, aren't going to be honest when they say they were unfairly banned. These people are part con artists. They want you to think they are good people, that didn't do anything wrong. 
---
That's how they justify what they do. I'm not a bad person.
---
Stlii cant be placed.  No one has a camp built even remotely close to it.
---
I don‚Äôt see why you would want to basically have two exact same characters.  Its not like my new character can use my level 50 weapon or  my higher level character want to use a level 15 weapon. 
---
So far we know there will be option to join a pvp server that does not have slap damage, and the TSE weapons everyone has chased the entire time will be nerfed 75/80%.  Probably some random fixes.  They probably have to do something content wise right, probably a change in dailey events.
---
I also wish it didn't take up a quarter of my screen.  I just use the regular medium scope  because it's lower profile.
---
So you launched a nuke and 5 raiders showed up and didn't want you there. The game is working as intended. Go play Fallout 4.
---
Learn recipes is another.  Kind of sucks when the very thing keeping end gamers playing is broken just like the servers.  
---
Yeah, I've been wanting that feature since the beta. I accidentally sold my best weapon during the beta
---
Go read the newest "Inside the Vault" from Bethesda, it's in there and will be straight from the horse's mouth instead of filtered through player biases.
---
... but what I could tell from reading it, it basically seems they want to implement servers with open PvP, ie. no slap damage, no pacifist, just unrestricted murder at all times. They'd be accessible from the main menu like how normal servers are now, but like as a second option in addition to normal servers. But we'll see how that shifts by the time it's implemented ü§∑
---
I know
---
Ah, but you still have to go into the character screen. My point is I want to see who is actively selected from the main menu
---
be sure to be in your power armor when you spawn in. O\_o it is a long way down.
---
Also I dont know if it is true since I dont build high up, but apparently while there is an upward limit there is no downward one. so you might beable to build steps to the bottom?
---
That sounds cool, Thanks!
---
No, and its straight north of Hemlock holes driving range.  In the mountain range.  You literally run into the edge of the playable map just outside my camp.  The crosshair camp is south west of my camp.
---
Right ;)
---
Noooo. They don‚Äôt lol. I meant that more in the sense that it would be nice to see recolored Military Fatigues, or a camouflage Marine Wetsuit, etc. 
---
I find it funny that they just say admin and everyone believes it. Also squeaker alert.
---
And there is nothing built in my camps location.
---
I put mine in and on top of it, that was my gf and I have a fast travel spot for this end of the map. You can actually fit a few workbenches inside and the plain beds will actually sit on the seats. Fast traveling there usually results in you being stuck in the seats by the sleeping back, but since I got beds there you just lay down and you're free.
---
Lost 1800+ cells to this one. Needs to be fixed ASAP.
---
It should of been a finished product on release not a very early prealpha 
---
There a lot of people salty over the nerfs (and for good reason), others had there mules banned.  There really isn't much to do otherwise at endgame other than to cause problems, for entertainment or to vent.
---
There is nothing built on my location.  
---
Yeah I was going to do but thought some people may need some!
---
Maybe the problem is on your end? Or your exaggerating. 
---
I find people greatly exaggerate things. Like the guy who claimed he got disconnected 4 times in a minute.
---
People always exaggerate when they are frustrated or upset because they believe making things sound worse than they are will get them quicker fixes. 
---
Ya honestly, go read the article, it's short and also details what they're implementing for legendary changes (ie. the TS &amp; Explosive nerf)
---
You won't get banned, you'll get a soft lock. Bethesda will lock your account till they can purge it of any item you're not suppose to have. At least, I think that's how they've been doing it, could be wrong. But a list would be helpful.
---
Probably from a person besides me, on a site full of opinions... But I do like the idea.  I feel it doesn't completely undermine the players that legitimately enjoy the game and actually try to play it.
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll get one. But fully expect it to appear in the shop for about 10 bucks each.
---
Nonexistent dick hard in the butt,

your man titty in ma claws,

TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
---
Bobblehead stacking is an issue regardless. TSE weapons are not just an issue for pvp.... as your post seems to suggest. PvE suffers from every atom worshipper under the sun using them.
---
Its intresting how many posts have come to defend TSE lately. I can only believe its those that paid real money for them or large anounts of caps for them that don't want to lose them.
---
TSE needs a good nerf regardless. Sorry if you paid for these mass duped items but start prepping. I knew this one comming i prepped tonnes of weapons for any change.
---
so the explosion radius did get bigger for those weapons? grenades, missile launchers, etc.? like, you could actually "see" the difference?
---
I'm asking because I figured by "radius" they could've meant the hitbox alone, so it wouldn't necessary increase the size of the hit detection box. but if the perk does increase it for other weapons, then I suppose it doesn't work with explosive legendaries indeed.
---
Dev room can only be accessed from PC, so if your not on PC not an issue.  It was unreleased outfits and paint jobs.
---
Scorchbeasts and mole rats spawn there just so you know. Also a plan spawns in that car.
---
I told them they are getting trolled by this kid am no response
---
Not everyone that was banned/suspended actually duped or used any exploit..so not eveyone is lying when the email them back.
---
I‚Äôve heard of at least three dupers who have had their accounts banned.  This is just the people that one of my friends knows.  I think it is more than just words at this point.
---
There is a downward limit. I built on top of the mountain at Top Of The World, was able to build very high up and deep down but after 4-5 levels downwards, i hit a limit and could not build deeper.
---
But we all knew that. We've known for weeks.
---
I think it's too late if the item has passed through your inventory, but I may be wrong. Saw someone else who was thinking that was the reason they were banned.
---
Bethesda has released some stuff saying most bans will be undone, the "culprits" (or those mistakenly caught up in it) seem to just have to explain what happened if it was honest, and agree to cease activity if it wasn't.
---
It's been stuck on an endless loop in my head for the past three days. I don't know if I love it or not.
---
Most likely people who suck at the game and bought those weapons on Ebay.
---
Top gear for it and PA gets blown away in pvp bro.
---
You want stuff like this.
---
https://imgur.com/a/2LikOtT
---
Without a doubt.  Wearing PA is basically saying "Hey raiders!  I am a walking pay day for you!"  
---
I think a special stash box that actually shares your player stash limit but actually allows other players to collect/drop items. Maybe have a set able limit for that box. That way I could leave out outside my camp full of ammo/water etc for anyone to collect.
---
Even better allow the water purifier to feed into this box to top up?
---
Ah thanks for the info. 
---
I have someone on my friend's list that's an unapologetic griefer. He farms people for caps. His build is entirely built on dodgy, assassin, sentinel, dense armor mods, and fireproof. I have a few TSE weapons and he can stand up to them with ease. It would seem to me the people arguing that a griefer is wrecking them are having encounters with PvPers when they aren't properly set up for PvP. 
---
The outcry in the community is sort of misplaced. It's not that it's OP (because yes, melee is also OP, a crit rifleman build is OP), it's probably something else. Likely other exploits or people not being properly set up for PvP.
---
Not sure why people are downvoting this. You are right; that does happen. 
---
I'll check them out :) 
---
Cool! I wish my high school had Geiger counters.
---
Either that or they did, and I didn‚Äôt get to use them because I didn‚Äôt take chemistry
---
this used to be the case for me, but now when I equip one it works fine. I don't have to drop my ammo or anything.
---
I thought it was fixed. 
---
How do we know that like the moon landing it's not just an elaborate fallout 4 mod I mean have we been there?
---
Most likely been seeing tonnes of them popping onto here lately since the word came out about it. Heck we had been saying for ages don't spend real money on this crap its gonna get nerfed. They don't just outshine a little they are leagues better than anything else.
---
My friend built in one of the little buildings on the green (the Driving Range) and only had two turrets to keep his brahmin safe. The build was a test to try a friendly public CAMP for all the people around that area and also because we wanted to see what happened when it was nuked. After the nuke, and the hilariousness of seeing it explode, he moved back to Flatwoods and had like 30+ of each item in storage. His budget was like 646%. We had no idea that could happen. He had to place everything to scrap it including the turrets. He obviously didn't leave them out but it was pretty funny seeing the turrets spread all over. We contemplated leaving it just to mess with people but ultimately decided not to because it's not right. I'm surprised more people aren't exploiting this though. He had mats for daysssss. 
---
Use it for crafting power armour primarily. 
---
[When I did that my mole rat partner got kinky](https://i.imgur.com/Q5mA60N.gifv)
---
Thanks to all! Very helpful! I should be good then!
---
can I just use it in the state is is though?
---
My friend found the plans for Civil War Era Dresses. Now she just cranks them out in her armor workbench and sells them to every vender in the game to make as many caps as she can.
---
I nuked it when there were scorched. Was not worth it.
---
That happened to me once. I just left the server, bye bye workshops. Just about everytime I play, someone with explosive "tse is just a specific e" will blast through wiping everything out. 
---
Bobbleheads are a problem, a bad one for sure, but rare.
---
TSE rears its head often. 
---
That too
---
I figured this out a while back. The real trick is to find an outfit you can craft that's worth a lot. A friend of mine crafts civil war era suits for caps (2 cloth and 5 gold scrap) and I craft halloween witch outfits (2 cloth and 5 plastic). I no longer need to collect up chems, glowing blood, and other things for trade fodder. The civil war era suit sells for ~25 with hard bargain and the halloween outfit sells for 49.
---
It's worth mentioning outfits usually weigh 0.1 lbs, so it's a really high value:weight ratio.
---
I've seen a dude dupe .38 rounds. they will dupe anything. 
---
Apparently Bethesda does not.
---
Fully ranked out Hard Bargain, then go to Whitesprings and there's a load of Golf outfits that sell for around 100 caps each. 
---
Aw that's awesome
---
It doesn't get stronger with each cell used, that would be a mildly cool mechanic, this is just a stupid bug
---
Bingo
---
100% 
---
Don't worry about idiots saying were toxic or hate-full, they clearly have no clue what they are talking about.
---
Anybody that "defends" a broken product is an idiot. Just because someone complains about something being broken doesn't mean its an attack on Bethesda or Fallout but the fanboi's see if that way. I mean its probably as they are pre teen and never had to work for anything ever in there life and / or are farming for internet points on reddit to show off to there mates or give them some sort of weird validation.
---
Customer should always come first as without them there's no more products, and if the majority of your customers keep telling you something is broken then something should be done about that.
---
The product isn't up to scratch and a lot of it is broken. Bethesda know this as well hence the patch that "apparantly" fixed 150 different bugs, the patch they are aiming at the the end of the month will be mostly made up of bug fixes as well.
---
If you find the Plans to an easy to craft outfit you're basically set for vendor runs forever. Found the Halloween Skeleton Costume Plans, and it takes just a bit of cloth &amp; plastic to clear out all the vendors each day.
---
That or do a pass through the penitentiaries for straight jackets (sells for ~50 caps each) and other accessories (asylum worker hats &amp; uniforms, prisoner collars, etc.)
---
The atom shop is not being utilised to its full potential. 
---
I refuse to spend real cash on items that are blah. 
---
Give me a glowing ghoul skin for my character and I will give you money Bethesda. 
---
Also, nice more interesting PA skins and character apparell that is immersive and not stupid. 
---
It's all about planning, if I see the server is full of low level players then I won't launch on that server. I also make Reddit posts for players to join my game as I'm finishing up launch prep. The last time I did this we got the whole server to join and defeated her in less than 5 minutes.
---
Yeah. You use the scrap
---
I've been trying 60 times a day to get the entire fireman outfit. So far I've only gotten two forest camo jumpsuits (that I've traded) and one vtu cap. Going on to day three today.
---
Have a similar problem. Suddenly the game runs like shit in some areas :/
---
why do you think they're always naked üòè
---
If you keep running into that change your build, there is a way around everything. I have different characters for different situations. Just because of it.
---
Man are you gonna not remember anything when you wake up.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. I think that‚Äôs the easiest way to tell it apart from regular glass.
---
I used to have a uv light that was attached to a pen that used uv reactive ink that was invisible under normal light, but I haven‚Äôt seen it in years.
---
I got acclimated to the stash weight pretty early on.  I've managed to pare down even more, reducing my stash scrap to 50-100 units except for lead and steel.  I hover around 500lbs.
---
I used to never have enough screws, but now that I'm not swapping and modding out a new pair of rifles every 10 levels, I cut it down to 100 screws.  Now I can't seem to ever have enough lead, even as a rifleman build.  Scorched Earth will really drain your ammo.
---
My end game is largely involved with killing legendaries at Whitesprings and Watoga, vendoring and doing nuke sites.  I'll use that extra 100lbs to save interesting legendary weapons that someone might like.  I gave away a 2-shot combat rifle and an instigating sledge today to  &gt;lvl75 people I saw using said weapons and were willing to give me a wave.  They're great weapons, but I really don't have anything to spend caps on and they take up a lot of weight in my stash, so I'd rather just pass them along.
---
**everything**
---
Im not having any issues
---
Good thing there are few blankets in the wasteland, he looks like he would hog it.
---
The small shop where you activate Steelheart for "Back on the Beat", ghouls around drop 1-2 screws usually, the patrols are filled with them too, and the shop alone sometimes has up to 5 screws. It's lot a but easy and accessible right at the start.
---
Maybe Beth changed the edges of the map...
---
Can you place it down anywhere else? Like somewhere more central on the map not at the very edges?
---
I have a 3k cap bounty on me I‚Äôve not died since I created this pvp character with a certain setup there is only 1 thing that can kill me. And nobody has one lol
---
Ah nice! I can probably see you from my patio on top of Seneca Rocks lol! See you in the wasteland!
---
Just keep running silos and hacking every terminal you see. 
---
This is a really late reply but I'm the same! My sister runs in with a sledge hammer while I snipe from the distance. They never have a chance to see me.
---
Oh they know.
---
I follow the same rule. I look at the levels of players in my server and say to myself "will I get help if I launch at prime?" 
---
Big thing is if you don‚Äôt want pvp don‚Äôt play a survival game. I have different characters for each situation. The only thing you cannot handle in game is bobblehead stackers.
---
I did think that was strange.  It must be an oversight.  In Fo4, the .50 did significantly more damage than .308.
---
Damn that was half a month ago.  Anyway yeah this is what I thought too but it's a rumor that's been debunked.

There are multiple ways someone can be killed without knowing they're flagged for PvP.  One that even could catch veteran players off guard.
---
I have not got anything from them since B.E.T.A but even then I only ever got a single cap.
---
pvp is not for everyone.  
---
I'm sorry but I can't remember, I only had eyes for the HP of the enemy and didn't check if the visual explosion got bigger or not.
---
I could test it out later on FO4 if it actually gets bigger or not.
---
I crash on ps4 at least once a day. Its the same code everytime which is just i think a general hardware failure. Some people say to rebuild your hdd but i havent done that yet as others have said it doesnt help.
---
Currently ‚Äûyes‚Äú
---
But bethesda is free to nerf legendary effects into the ground as they see fit 
---
So I have to say ‚Äûmaybe‚Äú
---
One set of servers until pvp and private November 2019.
---
A few weeks later: heres your pvp servers please leave us alone
---
Everything coming out for a while has been [datamined.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wkrj9/datamined_atom_shop_all_items_pictured/)
---
Nothing too appealing coming out for a while.. I hope the next batch will be much better., especially considering all of the player input. 
---
I want to see some more creativity in the Atomic Shop, not some lazy recolors and ported over fo4 items.
---
There is a lead deposit right next to an acid deposit right next to a fissure sight. I tried to build there but the scorchbeast said no.

It'd be less legitimate if there weren't glaring QA issues all over the place...

Reach level 100 trophy not popping.

Tried dying, logging out, changing character. Nothing seems to help.
---
San?! How dare you refer to a taikun as to your equal, peasant?!
---
Also, this task is impossible to complete because there were only 45 syoguns.
---
Yaaaaaaaaaas. Is your name Viviun? I just ask because of the Uname. And the tenancy toward stealth kills. I feel like we might be the same person. 
---
Anywhere that you farm plastic? I frequently bulk up my junk, and I never have enough
---
Bleeds will kill you and so will poison.
---
Apparently not this has been going on since beta.  If they knew it would not be a TS/TSE nerf. Got to love it people almost  playing 600 hours or more farming doing nukes traveling to nukes, farming mobs and all that time spent will be for nothing. 
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve fixed this now. In the graphics settings, any slider you see, just turn down to like 25% instead of 100. Fixed my issue right up.
---
Gunsmith + Luck Of The Draw = no more broken weapons. 
---
Best place to do this is the vendor at the ski resort. His shop area has a bunch of clothing and ski blades you can pick up and sell to him.

Half the time I wind up in the weapon selection dialog because I ran out of action points spinning that damn wheel.

Feel free to try.
---
Pay to win option respec or caps.  Idc. Should be an option tip completely revamp
---
Coyote ugly
---
Other than bobble head stacking I can‚Äôt die. Even to other sentinel users because I can counter them 
---
It's not that I don't want to make friends in the game (well maybe that's half of it) but I can't voice chat when I play (for many reasons that I doubt you'd want to hear). So the extent of making friends in the game is limited to sending blind friend requests and emotes. PC really needs native text chat.
---
You can always scrap it.  It's the thought that counts.
---
It's honestly my favorite part of the game right now, helping people out.
---
I basically farm legendary gear for my end game at Watoga and Whitesprings, and I wind up with a bunch of interesting stuff that I can't personally use, 3 star armors, shotguns, melee weapons, etc, but others might get a lot of enjoyment from.
---
I got a lvl 50 furious/nocturnal pole hook today if anyone wants it.  Shankwell on PC.
---
I'm not sure if that's as pervasive as reddit makes it out to be. All I do is farm the queen and I have yet to see someone one shot the queen. You'd think a guy with a 132 explosive vent collection would've seen that happen at least once. 
---
We demand proof when someone alleges force trading or power armor theft, but when it comes to being griefed by someone who stacks bobbleheads we just accept it without any proof. It surely is a problematic exploit, but I'm not sure it's as widespread as r/fo76 makes it out to be. It does need to be fixed, as all exploits need to be, but this game has more balance issues than TSE.
---
Buying a or picking up a single duped item, though incredibly petty and I doubt that is why you were banned, would be a violation of the TOS. Swearing on a hot mic would be a violation of the TOS. Depending upon the words used badmouthing the game on here or facebook or YouTube would be a violation of the TOS.
---
If you think you are innocent then write them. If you are then hopefully it works out for you.
---
If you were truly wrongly banned than I'm sorry for you but accidents happen and cheaters needes to be banned.
---
Not helpful whatsoever, but thanks for the "input." I crash multiple times a day just walking around, not even doing anything graphically intensive. 
---
As far as bounties go, the game takes more caps from the wanted player than are rewarded to the player who kills them. It's double. 
---
For example, if you see a player with a 40 cap bounty, it's actually displayed as an 80 cap bounty to the player. So when their bounty is wiped, they lose 80 caps, but the player who wiped the bounty only receives 40 caps.
---
I think this is partially to discourage teams clearing each other's bounties, because the game essentially taxes you 100% for getting a bounty in the first place.
---
Your friend isn't griefing, just because he thinks its easier to farm players than anything else for caps doesn't make him a griefer. He's into PVP and he's using the mechanics that Bethesda are encouraging players to use.
---
PVP doesn't = griever 100% of the time
---
I crash multiple times. I couldn't imagine it's a hardware failure, but I run every other game perfectly fine-- especially with much more graphically-intensive gameplay. It's *only* Fo76.
---
So, after some testing, with Marsupial and all, there is an even faster way to check for snipers.
---
If you're on the road to the west of the civic center, there is a set of hedges against the wall, with small black outcrops behind them. You can use both to get to the second floor entrance. From there, you can go straight forward and look directly at the target area. I tend to use rifles, so I just walk in, tap the guys at the entrance (once the legendary was right there) and scoped out the area real quick.
---
Well I use this name in all of the games I play! Without the numbers. It's not my real name tho. If you see someone named Viviun in game it's most likely me hahaha.
---
What would it be?  Sama?
---
Make a new character
---
No. No it's not. Bc fallout in no way shape or form is realistic or meant to be realistic. Lol. And I may have to go back and re read, but I think OP was more concerned with being annihilated instantly in pacifist mode. So as of right now, there's no way for a player that doesn't wanna be involved in pvp to avoid getting killed or thrust into it. What if he's a fresh level 35 in his first nuke zone and just loaded up on junk and hardened mass bc ya know he's in pacifist and doesn't have to worry and some ass clown comes and one shots him and takes all his stuff? So now he's being punished even tho he had no intention of participating in pvp at all. 
---
TSE was just fine Bethesda
---
Fix It Good increases the DR for a time too until the piece falls back to 100% or less.
---
No need to use perks for it if you dont use it. 
---
This is correct, and whoever downvoted it should be ashamed.
---
Been having the same issue. Last night, couldn't place camp after 4 server hops, &amp; today I can't place on this current server. I am in a popular area along the west river, but I've never had problems before. 
---
the game is already pay to win with the duped TSE's 
---
you want to be able to one shot other players, cough up the dough
---
I honestly would rather have nothing than the shit show that is their respec option. Cause either way at the end of the day, you can make a new character and get it to lvl 50+ 100x faster than respecing a character to make a different build, and making a new character adds more loot more money more storage. They really didn‚Äôt think this through.
---
And wh6 can't I bulk screws?
---
Point of my post was, it could be on ur end. Game works good for me. Didnt have to be an ass.  You didnt ask a question 
---
Well, I‚Äôm not online that very often, but if you don‚Äôt mind it I‚Äôll add you. Playing with a bigger group brings more joy, eh.
---
Looks like he is about to slip you the Rad Worm... 
---
All the Alcoholic Stuff used to give good Money too, then Bethesda nerfed it with the first Patch.
---
Same here on xb1. Travellling and the boom stuck on endless loading screen. Hooray Bethesda thanks for the bug fix...
---
I like this idea. Would love to see it and the enemy-specific damage bonuses buffed to make them more desirable. Like, would a +50% damage bonus against Mirelurks be that OP with the weight restrictions this game has already?
---
It's obviously not, as I just stated that I'm not having said issues on any other game. I've switched between two physical locations with quality connectivity (both hardwired and WiFi-based). I play IT enough at work, I don't/shouldn't need to do it at home too. 
---
And from what I'm aware, more than just one person is complaining about it after their most recent patch.
---
Well apparently I am your spirit animal. I will delete this later but I shit you not Vivian is my real name and I sometimes use 93 if I need numbers for my birth year. So from Vivian93 to Viviun92... stealth kill on sister. They will never catch us.
---
they're that rare, you just don't realize it because so many have been duped 
---
there is a growing majority of players with 100's of hours logged who haven't got one to drop, they get two shots, they get anti armor explosives, bloodied, etc but no TSE
---
so anyone with fewer hours rocking a TSE more than likely, a 80% chance, bought or duped one, didn't get it in a drop.
---
Had the exact same thought, nice image.

I've been trying to find the plans to make these items. Where did you get yours? I've tired for weeks to trigger the civil war events an can never get them to trigger. The random event trigger place I know of by overseers camp isnt working for me after 2 weeks of trying.
---
I don‚Äôt believe rumors about server limit because if you make one mules, you pretty much double (or in case the character carries it) triple the stash load on your account already 
---
And you can make multiple mules 
---
PvP != griever for all times
---
I have seen people on here going into safe mode and doing something there and it helped
---
Long lost sniper sisters? Don't tell me you have red hair bc that would be scary. üòÇ
---
We‚Äôre going down down in an earlier round and sugar we're going down swinging.
---
You don‚Äôt become wanted for slapping someone, only if you kill them with slap damage or shoot their base.
---
I had a similar experience during a rare nuke up in Toxic Valley.  There was a trio of higher levels mowing down everything in sight.  I gave them a wave and one of them shot me.  It didn't hurt too much and maybe it was accidental, but he did it again when I started following their group.  Seemed like kind of a dick move, but I just went my own way to avoid conflict.  I did get 5-6 pieces of cobalt flux so it was a good nuke, even if I missed out on some legendaries.
---
I almost always run with passive on, because I'm not interested in hurting other participants that accidentally jump in front of me or are in the zone of my explosive rifle.  I just want to get some splash damage on the legendaries and be able to deal effective damage on the queen.
---
The high school cafeterias are full of plastic plates, forks and knives. 
---
Easy to farm. Server hop a couple of times and you will have heaps of plastic. 
---
I'll give it a shot, thank you.
---
Happened to me too first time I fired it, used it after and didn't do it again
---
Why did it take them this long to publicly denounce exploits...
---
Yup, and it‚Äôs a survival game, there are other people that play like raiders. Don‚Äôt want pvp a survival game might not be the best choice. Be thankful all your gear does not drop.  Mats and caps can be farmed for and replaced easily. Weapons and gear is not.
---
There is a jaws reference in the river... I think it was down near the ash heap.
---
Hrmm, I don't actually farm it tbh, just pick some up along the way, but I'm 90% sure there's a big pile of plastic to be gathered at all the schools. Lots of toys, fake pumpkins, cafeteria trays, and plastic cutlery/plates/cups. If memory serves Top of the World has some plastic, as does the top floor of Fort Defiance, but honestly I think you'd be *much* better off with hitting the schools, or anywhere with a cafeteria.
---
Crippling arms and legs using vats and nailing head shots for bonus damage
---
I learned about it from Twisted on YouTube initially. He has a lot of vids about using existing locations!
---
This is amazing. 
---
Yeah, but explosive gets nerfed too...
---
No, he's definitely a griefer that likes PvP. He says so himself. He enjoys enraging players and trolling them until they rage quit. Collecting caps is just fun for him because he knows he's taking them from other players that value them.
---
I died a thousand times trying to do this event the other day. I‚Äôve NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE BUT I really needed a naked guy.
---
I dont remember what they do in safe mode. You will have to search reddit. Sry
---
While I get your sentiment, the game allows you to fast travel to every other map icon, and even workshops when you own them. Not being able to FT to them when unowned doesn‚Äôt fit with the rest of the game.
---
Trash game?  
---
Last I recall RDR2 has won more awards than F76.  
---
It has sold far more copies than F76.  
---
The multiplayer while may be in beta is not buggy and broken like F76.  
---
The game has an actual story unlike F76  
---
Oh and it has human NPCs  
---
Need I go on?
---
Yeah, a bit late to be asking for so much with damage reduction inbound. Still a good rifle, but I think I bought mine at 3k. I guess free market will dictate. 
---
So how about summarizing the video in your post instead of clickbaiting us?
---
It says specifically customer support handles it, meaning they really can only go by submitted videos and screenshots and have no tools or it would already have been banning people
---
Both populations, but *before* they were angry or apologists or anything else. They represent all Fallout players at the time of E3. 
---
Breh. It's not even about the raiders being ass hats. It's about him clearly not wanting to engage in pvp and being killed repeatedly anyway. It's about a playerbase that's slowly ruining any chance this game has bc they would rather glitch, duplicate, and exploit than play it. They wouldn't even have to nerf tse if people hadn't made 6 million copies of the guns to hand out to everyone. I'm level 311. I've only had one tse weapon drop in all that time. 
---
I wanted to share my experience from last night.
---
I am level 70 and I play in pacifist mode, generally to keep from accidentally damaging other players during group events due to latency or lag spikes.  I prefer pve and have little to no interest in pvp as a whole unless I opt-in with a workshop takeover.  I was at my camp, in a party with a friend, and feeling pretty safe, I stepped away to grab a drink.  When I returned to my PC, I had been pushed outside my camp and was getting slapped repeatedly by a level 58 with a 300+ bounty.  They had what *appeared* to be an explosive two-shot pump action shotgun.  As I got back onto voice comms, my friend was telling me that they were destroying my base quickly.  I flipped out of pacifist mode, thinking I should be able to defend myself against a lower level with my Gauss sniper build.  I shot him several times in the head using V.A.T.S. with 95% accuracy, and didn't do a speck of damage to him.  (Maybe you have to restart for this setting to take effect?)  Suddenly, a level 170 with no bounty showed up and killed the bountied player.  Thinking I just got some outside help I gave him the thumbs up.  Boy, was I wrong.
---
I went back up to my base to find that a third party with a bounty of 500+ was just disassembling the entire thing - also with an explosive two-shot pump action shotgun.  The other player respawned and came back and started to wreck the base again.  I shot back, doing no damage again, and he and his friend killed both me, and my friend, and leveled my entire base.  The level 170 killed both of them, erasing their bounties, as I respawned.
---
Rather than having to deal with the social menu to block them, I logged out and server hopped to escape the situation.  Needless to say, repairing my base was more expensive than I'd liked it to have been given the fact that I neither started the ruckus and seemingly was unable to defend myself from someone of a lower level.  Granted, I probably suck at pvp, but something about this entire situation didn't seem right or just.
---
This
---
I feel like someone at their game design studio was very stubborn in his vision and refused any and all input concerning experience with previous online titles 
---
It feels like they themselves are surprised that ‚Äúmule characters‚Äù exist 
---
So explosive bloodied will still do more damage than two shot explosive 
---
i wish there was a clean version of all machines, rugs etc.
---
How much would you do this for if I have the mats already? Only interested in the shocks.
---
The bobblehead exploit is a big problem and wide spread lol. I encounter it daily get one shotted yup, the queen dies in seconds to a couple minutes. Yup once again.
---
Explain how I'm clickbaiting? 
---
There's some glitch that sometimes makes you appear naked to other players.  I've experienced it myself and had friends tell me I was naked after fast traveling, even though I was wearing my full armor kit.
---
&gt; Where do I find a raid (PC) ?
---
Use LFG on the [subreddit discord.](https://discord.gg/falloutreddit)  99% of it is just people nuking alerting high levels to join the server.
---
But it wont be as OP as it is now, when the new content comes.
---
It‚Äôs good to see people asking for proof. The proof of Bobbleheads and magazine stacking has been posted all over this sub this week. I have seen no less than 3 posts,  with pictures of ungodly DPS posted either by the Victim, or a friend of the perpetrator. 
---
Saying stacking doesn‚Äôt exist, or even denying it a bit is only helping the folks that are abusing this mechanism. 
---
Cool so his ban is incoming then :D
---
Goddamn hell of an edit. I'm jealous. I feel like a chump with my PS4 capture. That was sick.
---
Enclave bunker , Modus : We have now gained access to our neural-control interface¬†(NCI) machine. For the price of 5,000 caps that are used as currency in the wastelands. We can implant you with a chip allowing you to reset and relearn abilities. 
---
Also Bethesda something you need to do is clean up the perk cards. If a perk card is maxed you should he able to choose the star level used in it. Instead of requiring up to 5 versions of the same card ( pointless system ). 
---
When you do this the best thing you can do to make sure no blow back is reset everyones perks. Allowing them a free full respec. Do this at the same time as bringing in the NCI chips and boom the community would love ya lads.
---
I would hope so
---
Don't forget to add fix it good in the mix. Combined with white knight you'll be handing out ballistic fiber next Halloween. 
---
We'll be masters of logistics if better player-player marketplaces are put in place.

I've tried 5 times to complete the Government Issued ID quest.  The 1st time I was disconnected from the server and no progress was saved. The next 2 times I had to do something so I backed out of the game, again no saved progress. The 4th and 5th times, when I enter the Charleston Capital Courthouse to get a stamp for my application, the game just sits on a loading screen and never recovers. No saved progress.
---
At lvl 15 i got my first glowing one kill, a lvl 40, by aiming at his right leg with vats. Once he limped, it was go time. Now i vats rusher mobs with a shotgun to the leg to keep them away, and save the big crit shot for the boss mobs. Maybe mot endgame viable, but im enjoying it.
---
You definitely should re-read what the word pacifist means. That's the part that keeps wooshing you in this conversation.
---
And don't get me wrong, I would love for there to be a PvE mode. Not arguing with you there. 
---
Well I have the ginger complexion, but not unfortunately, the lovely hair. I am dark haired, while my siblings blaze red!
---
You‚Äôre missing the logic here. Let‚Äôs use numbers.
---
Bloodied = 2, two shot = 2, explosive = 1
---
2+1 (bloodied explosive) - ignored
---
2+1 (two shot explosive) - too OP so let‚Äôs nerf two shot and explosive
---
1+0.5 (new two shot explosive) 
---
2+0.5 (new bloodied explosive - still OP
---
I second the multinational flags, I would also love to see better emotes if we aren't getting text or direct messaging. They also need to take the non-purchased gear out of the build menus, it's just clutter which for some of us will never be bought.
---
Very very true critical.
---
no, well sort of
---
you can store the item and re-place it to refill its health
---
Sprinting
---
Sounds fishy. Like the big white van with free candy. Stranger Danger!!!!!
---
cool
---
THANK YOU!
---
Ima big fan of my instigating fireaxe has been really helpful to 3 shot glowing wendigos at level 30
---
I prefer gradual reshaping. don't like this idea.
---
If you are complaining about balance updates, change your build and learn to play without a TSE crutch.
---
Disagree. I run around with all but 4 perks or so.
---
A small buff to the mutant legendary would be great to make it viable. 
---
So maybe limit it to 5 mutations or less?
---
While they're at it, maybe some curtains or roller blinds (keep it period correct). It's weird when you're cooking and there's some random person standing outside looking at you.
---
I've seen video of someone one-shotting the queen. I have yet to see a video of someone being killed through pacifist. Also, when I've tried to re-create this I haven't been able to see a stack of damage without enough damage to do meaningful damage through pacifist. The only thing I get is bobblehead refresh
---
people seem to be missing the fact that they give free atoms for playing the game
---
I‚Äôm just entirely convinced that nobody at Bethesda has any understanding of online games or online gameplay whatsoever. There are so many off-mechanics and missed opportunities the only online experience in this game is other people being present...very simple example...why don‚Äôt the trains work? Why isn‚Äôt there some type of transportation that moves you from one area of the map to the next?
---
He was referring to the former part of your post. Pay to win versus cosmetics.
---
This!
---
The longer and longer this shit show goes the more and more i think this is exactly it.
---
Some shitty Dev team leader or something that does there gaming on a DS or something. I dont understand how a respec option takes longer than leveling a new character. So pig headed and power crazy that they literally ruined Fallout as a franchise for Bethesda. Hate to say it but they need to start sacking the coders that let the game get this way and hire a team that actually knows wtf they are doing or at the very least hire people that look like they know what they are doing.
---
The whole point of a respec in most mmo's is so that we can stick with the characters we put some much time and effort into but be able to try out other things the game has to offer.
---
Its not a big issue at the moment....wait till the TSE nerf happens though, all those players that get hit by it are going to need new builds which a lot of them probably wont get with the respec'ing the way it is.
---
It's a great response to the idiot's that said duping is Bethesdas fault and not those who are doing it. 
---
To my understanding, any mods that you craft onto a weapon are not removable as an individual mod.  For example if you craft a ‚Äúshort recon scope‚Äù  onto a 10mm pistol, and then craft ‚Äúglowing sights‚Äù onto that same pistol, the short recon scope is just deleted, not added into your inventory as a mod.  Took me a while to figure out how it worked and still is frustrating sometimes.  About if there are mods that can only be found and not crafted, I am unsure.  Hope that helps!
---
you don't need it.
---
Could be the plans for future dlc?!
---
Was thinking the same today! So many potential to make money if the add cool stuffs, Ive already play for 300+ hs and I dont mind to spend 10 or 20 once in a while. But for now Im keeping the Free atoms until they wake up.
---
I was only able to play one beta session due to my work schedule. Seeing as I didn't get very far I started fresh when the game was released. I also am experiencing this issue so I'm not sure ok sure that the beta is the cause of this.
---
Wtf i did the exact same pic i the exact same spot months ago wtf schrodinger
---
That repair functions a real bitch, huh?
---
Yes that works, thanks a lot 
---
You can give them to me.
---
weapon mods, excavator power armor, etc..
---
You tease interesting new information, but then leave the reader hanging.  The only way to find out which location works well as an alternative to Whitespring and Fissure Prime is to click the link and watch the video.  Baiting us to click the link.  
---
Can I say the female hairstyle options in this game overall are *unforgivably fucking atrocious.*
---
I haven't been less pleased with a character creator since like... Everquest?
---
The only benefit really is the fun of it, to roleplay as raiders. Some camps make great PvP arenas too. There's even a perk card (wrecking ball) for doing camp damage. It IS an intentional part of the game. It is cheap to repair bases for a reason.
---
Sometimes I'll go to someone's camp with no intention of fighting but just to check out the base. Other times, I'll show up and drop goodies, plans, etc. And occasionally I'll try to initiate PvP. One of the best ways to initiate PvP is to develop a bounty, because it gives other players the advatange to hit first. If they really don't want to engage then it's simple enough to hop servers.
---
agreed 100%
---
Monograh town is the new location :-). If you can't even spend at least 12 minutes to watch a video idk what to tell you Harold 
---
What, at level 15 it‚Äôs hard to find one legendary lol but yea the stash seems to be what I need to do thanks!
---
It's not even my video. I'm just a messenger boy 
---
I hate watching shitty YouTube clickbaiting. What can I say?
---
I had one guy completely destroy my camp while I was there peacefully just trying to organize my stash. Then he proceeds to kill me and my group every time we go back to my camp. And I didn't have enough materials to repair it, nor did I want to spend all the materials repairing it. I ended up having to replace my camp and rebuild it completely from scratch again. We did not want to pvp and there was no way we could avoid this unless we ran away or server hopped.
---
Attacking bobble heads being an issue does not magically preclude the fact that both two shot and explosive doubled base weapon damage making them head and shoulders the most desirable legendary mods. Online games undergo balance changes. It's a fact of life.
---
2 Shot should not have added 70% more damage to all enemies than enemy specific modifiers. It was unbalanced and did not make sense.
---
Explosive should not double the weapon damage and an AOE. Honestly I don't think it should add damage at all as it adds AOE.
---
After the nerf those modifiers will finally be more online with the other legendary modifiers allowing for more build variety and a healthier economy where more than a handful of guns have any value.
---
Also now that those guns will be brought online with the rest of ballistic weapons it will allow tweaks to be made to the entire ballistic system to balance it more with melee.
---
It‚Äôs not a crutch even on melee build if your opponent is using the bobble heads exploit  there is no build change or setup when they can hit for up to 150k+ damage. 
---
You do realize that with the current way turrets are a SAM would likely be 50% of your budget at a conservative estimate. I have a 2 shot .50 prime machinegun for any beastie that gets near my camp, a level 80 is about 400 rounds.
---
&gt;ported over FO4 items
---
Idk if I'm alone here but charging us out the ass for recycled content is incredibly insulting to me.
---
Fuck the atoms store
---
Could be but i doubt it, the way things are at the moment its probably just bugged out, although would be curious to see if the OP can place it somewhere else.
---
If its got anything to do with DLC shame on Bethesda, no business messing around with dlc when they have so much to fix for there customers.
---
Definitely no.  This helps dupers and exploiters way too much.  At least right now, dupers and exploiters still need 2 or more people.
---
You can fast travel or log out...not necessarily stuck more...baited. Potentially trying to force a bounty.
---
This is the content I want to see more around here +1
---
So then you don't watch anything on YouTube Then? YouTube is all about clickbaiting so I imagine with your logic you don't even touch the app. Nice job m8 
---
sorry I have to say thats really annoying. The end game is build around power armor. And having to run around so much to look for these cores now bugs me a lot. 
---
‚Äûhey lets kill the scorched queen‚Äú
---
‚Äûi cant. I have run out of power cores‚Äú
---
‚Äûme, too‚Äú
---
sounds fun. not.
---
There are different versions of the bug. I made a video of my main and set it to Bethesda and they said it "may be fixed in the future."
---
Guess unless a bunch of you get taffy limbs I'll never play my PA heavy again.
---
New guy I'm playing is level 60 now and only been in PA once to finish excavator quest. I'm afraid of having to start over again.
---
OMG! The Vermin that inhabit a ghouls crotch
---
Three.
---
The Flatwoods monster does it also.
---
Bobble head stacking is an exploit, it‚Äôs not attacking it. You can become nearly immune to TS/TSE with some cards and the right armor and mods. It‚Äôs not the problem, want to drive TSE/TS players messing with you equip the right cards, armor with mods. Problem solved.
---
If your on pc we have a mod that does this called known plans. Been using it for abit now and this mod author is just unreal he has created the best mods for 76.
---
Was not be serious. Sorry
---
It doesnt appear on my ps4 settings for some reason.
---
I just keep a log book. Better than nothing.
---
 For him you will look like a serial killer. 
---
Just a thought but vendors caps and certain lootables reset on a 20 hours (in game time) dont they? or something along those lines. Maybe the terminals operate on the same basis...perhaps? just spit balling
---
I'm on Xbox1 and hope to see something like this on console soon.
---
I found my first (Lvl 50 TSE Pipe Rifle) as a drop from the SBQ at Lvl170, 240hrs in.  They are definitely supposed to be rare found weapons.
---
I got the sturdy raider arm plans from the Messager quest.
---
the easiest way to make money in the game:
---
equip green thumb.
---
harvest plants in nuke zones.  they sell for 10-12 each, you get two flux for each plant harvested with the card equipped.
---
in less than 15 minutes at whitesprings I get more flux than I can actually sell in a day.
---
yeah so many mods on pc are too useful that i hope Bethesda implements into the game for our console bros.
---
Every year or so I get a knock on my door. It's a parent with their 10ish year old with something to sell. Here I am thinking...you're taking your child door to door and introducing them to absolute strangers. What could possibly go wrong?
---
Damm, I thought this was a passive perk. I didn‚Äôt realize that I needed to scroll the mouse wheel. üòæ
---
It‚Äôs a sphere centered around original camp placement. 
---
exactly!
---
2500 Atoms, 1 week sale
---
My phone autocorrected to attacking. K have edited my post for spelling. 
---
I don't give a damn about people attacking me with TSE it hasn't been an issue for me. That does not change the fact the guns were unbalanced. 
---
yep.  there are several places i need to "discover" for acheivments, despite the fact that I can fast travel to them.
---
Cranberry Glade is one of mine, I suspect we have nearly matching lists.
---
Please accept my upvote. There needs to be a mechanic for this, although I'm afraid it won't happen because Bethesda is afraid it will facilitate mule-ing and (provided another exploit is found) duping too much. :-(
---
It's all about the camp items.   Those  are the only things I keep an eye on.
---
Also,  there's only like  one  good  pose  in  the shop too.  Sitting.    Got that for some future pictures.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve made a ton of other videos using Sharefactory, I love throwing edits like this together. 
---
Some balls to go on my pool table would be great.
---
Chill with the hostility, bro. I'm speaking out of my  experience from when I've had 10 cap bounties. They've been on me for hours at a time. I'm not forcing anything on anyone just giving my opinion on why people with bounties should be able to keep on fast traveling. 
---
Excellent post.
---
To add to it, I've found that moving and organizing plants can be problematic.  The area where the plant previously sat still recognizes that something is there, so you're unable to place a new object unless you log out to main menu and back in.  It's not the end of the world, but it does make reorganizing a garden a bit tedious.
---
I imagine after Bethesda tackles the more pressing issues of duping and server stability, they'll be able to shift focus back to more QoL improvements and hopefully addressing some problems with camps, like the one you described, the garden issue, and making fences and gates actually functional.
---
Upvote for the NS reference :)
---
Kept happening to me the other day, I got a really good piece of  ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ level 10 armor I couldn't give away. 
---
The fact that it can be mitigated with perk cards has nothing to do with those two legendary traits being vastly more powerful than all other traits.
---
They never mentioned anything about nerfing stacking bobbleheads
---
Yea, i wish they would apply the skins to all weapons, not just one, same goes for the armor.
---
I want the chrome skin so bad :(
---
The dark and light wood floors,  the fireplace,  the fish lamps.
---
Theyre all quite visually appealing.
---
The new nuka quantum sign is pretty cool too,  but yeah I agree.
---
They need to do less ‚Äúlimited time‚Äù items and more cool items.   Really wish the black PA paints would come back.
---
That seems like an exaggeration to me. I'm level 290 and haven't seen anything that resembled it. Either I'm living in a bubble or its prevalence isn't that common. Where it does exist must be game breaking
---
Judging by the boasting of other people using it, I suspect that maybe is more of a ‚Äúprobably‚Äù for these effects. Apparently they don‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt stop them from stacking.
---
Tbh I really really want them to just scale back PvP in general. New mode? Awesome, do it. But let‚Äôs be real, PvP is gonna eventually screw over every nice thing we have now.
---
What about the cargo bot supply drop?  I shot one down and had to pick it to open it (steal).  It didn't seem to give me a wanted level.
---
Didn't even know that was an option. Very well done.
---
/close 
---
It‚Äôs not the TS/TSE you have an option to get the stuff not to die then wreck them.  It‚Äôs The bobblehead stacking exploit. They don‚Äôt use a TSE or TS rifle they will just use a rocket launcher, fatman or flamer to wreck your camp in the same way.
---
Thank you! I wanted to make sure I wasn't stupid for re-crafting mods on my new guns.
---
I feel like the mods were detachable in previous Fallout games? Am I crazy?
---
Goes on sale 1 week after hitting atomic shop 50% off, Just like the game itself on black friday after preorder. Smdh XD
---
Well I guess everyone is lucky that not everyone knows how to stack Bobbleheads. Because you are unable to reproduce the effect does not mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. Again I point you to this sub. If your looking for proof then search this sub. There‚Äôs plenty of instances with pictures. 
---
Well, can't be done intentionally if you don't count the camp duplication bug (which seems to have come back for myself and a couple friends) and some bug where I duplicated by level 25, nearly broken power armour.
---
But yeah you're not going to end up with 1000 stimpacks accidentally, either.
---
Are you over level 5?  It should appear on your in-game menu when you hit level 5.  I think a big pop-up page comes up and mentions it.
---
Seen a level 2 at the overseer camp last night, so put some chems and plans , including a stim pack plan, into the overseers chest for him. I look up and the little fucker is gone.
---
Sensei is probably the most correct honorific in this case
---
If you‚Äôre on PC make sure you Block him so you won‚Äôt be put on the same server again.
---
That sounds thematic, and with the way mutations work the drawbacks of having every mutation are rather sever. There are what 24 mutations, I would love for a 3-4 % per mutation, allowing you to get a decent bonus with a few, but a huge bonus if you go for the full glass cannon mutant build.
---
The thing is though, because having some mutations is so good that nearly everyone has at least one mutation by level fifty they want, that mutants being a fixed 10% bonus makes it pretty decent compared to a lot of other variations, because there is no drawback really.
---
I'm sure there is an option to 'repair all structures' if you approach the main camp thingamy that you place when choosing your location.
---
Yes but with a twist. I just got marsupial, bird brains and a jet pack and just wow, it is amazing. A real game changer. You fly onto tops of buildings and explore like you never have before. It is amazing to see the tops of Whitesprings or throughout Grafton. I want to start a newbie all over but give him these abilities right up front. To fly is to live!!
---
If you‚Äôre placing the long version it does that.  Place the short version, or remove the roof/upper floors.  Same bug happens with the fireplace from the atom store :)
---
lol don't know what we are talking about?  There's people doing 36k damage crits without bobbleheads or other exploits with TSE weapons. Fact. 
---
Nice place, but outlandishly large? Naw. It's also not very detailed inside as I've been pointing out. :P  
---
Again, it's cool if you're happy with what you have, and it's a nice size. This post was for people want to 'maximize' their budget to get every drop for aesthetics! 
---
I edited the comment above to act as a ‚Äúreply‚Äù to everyone that commented on the thread. I‚Äôm still not sure exactly why that amount of cells is suspicious, and I thought I‚Äôd let you know that whatever sort of witch hunt you wanted to start on me isn‚Äôt appreciated. 
---
Fort defiance actually.  I'll send screenshot if I find it later
---
They are not unbalanced when you can get the gear, mods and perks. There is an option. Now the camp killers will just snag a rocket launcher, fatman, or flamer and do the same thing and still stack bobble heads and may possibly kill you in one shot with those weapons anyways. 
---
A screenshot of a damage sheet isn't the same thing as a video of someone dropping through pacifist. That's the proof I'm asking for and what we should all be seeking when these claims are made.
---
Im lvl 21 now. The settings where you also have the option to quit server, right?
---
I'm on xbox 1 but I did block him so hopefully I dont have to see him again
---
I'll check it out (:
---
Thank you, i was so confused as id never really had the issue before
---
&gt;  I was just too lazy to transfer ammo from my melee chars to the ranged.
---
How do I do that ?! :o Seems like each char has their own stash. (I'm a solo player, so I might need a friend ?)
---
Yeah Fort Defiance was an asylum before the war.
---
The "kids" theme is really lame tbh, or whatever it is I forget. I totally agree I want more immersive stuff not all this CrZaY wAcky stuff that the atom shop seems to be filled with.
---
Anyone get banned for having duped item in there inventory yet and not actually duping. 
---
I feel the same way, although I tend to avoid killing harmless enemies that prefer to be left alone.  For some reason I feel sorry for the possums.  They look so pitiful.  The exception is glowing, erratic and devolved radstags.  They'll attack you as soon as they see you.
---
I also go out of my way to avoid conflict with the one Mr. Handy with his pack of dogs.  He sounds so bummed out if they attack and you have to defend yourself.
---
Yep using the materials that you just spent time collecting to build something else to instead repair what some spoiled little tard had to destroy in order to get his jollies off today but I guess your one of those aren't you
---
New to this page I see. Type "assaultron head" into the search bar and keep the search in the fallout 76 Reddit page.
---
Yea. You take reduced damage from enemy players and do no damage to players and player structures. I know exactly what pacifist mode is. 
---
This is a good suggestion too! I haven't spent much time looking for preexisting structures to use, mainly cause I usually pick my camp location based on its views. But I might do this for my next char. :D
---
How much do you play? I run into this nightly and most weekends. Almost 600hrs in. 
---
Why not just tell us instead of trying to get us to watch his video 
---
'Passsword' is a rather cool typo, actually. My Blade of Bastet often gains me free passage whenever I use it...
---
Not true in pvp areas like "verses events" and workshop loctions.
---
I.... did not. I remember hearing about the disarming glitch thing, but I thought it was for some other trap. Cans? The string/flamethrower thing? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
System?
---
My workmates refer to him as Tintin. They know that he's called Vault Boy, but when wearing a tshirt with a selection of perks on it I will almost always get 'Hey, you're wearing that Tintin shirt again' Grrrrr......
---
Oh man.....  poor thing.
---
Maty want to post the system you are on.
---
And adamantium skeleton to negate staggers which bypass sentinel.
---
We get the patches first because any issues can be hotfixed right away. The process for console patches is very different going through Sony and Microsoft. Think of us as the patch tester to rid as many issues with the patch that could be major issues.
---
We don't know when the next one is due currently. But from the inside the vault it could be set to be before the end of Jan.
---
If you are talking about the dead body in the boat with the giant fish, it's by the river on the far western side of the forest.
---
Dupers and exploiters are getting bans.  Bethesda can also now detect when a player has excessively many rare items and is banning them pending investigation as well.  And of course they‚Äôre eliminating the most common exploits.  If they implemented that in the next update, I‚Äôd see little reason to think cheaters would have any more options available to them than they do now.  
---
Also I think it‚Äôs more important to cater to those of us playing the game without exploits than to avoid implementing a feature that may benefit the exploiter.  I will benefit; a cheater might benefit.  A subtle but important difference if you ask me.
---
Make it 20,000.
---
It looks like you are not in the clonking robots business, yet. Start clonking, you'll love it!
---
So sorry! Ps4
---
Sorry about that! Ps4
---
Wrong, pacifist mode only prevents you from dealing damage to other players or their structures. It does not reduce incoming enemy damage.
---
i did the same thing today at whitespings. ended up dying.
---
Almost 100 and the best I've managed is a furious CR and mutant slayer HR.  Haven't seen a single TS or E, much less both together.
---
This guy Stephen kings
---
I agree, tse is not a pvp problem. It has a decent counter now with fireproof. However it is not a lot of fun watching someone with a tse play, first charecter had an automatic Tesla, and I still had trouble tagging anything at white springs. Tse was supposed to be super rare, but you see them every day. 
---
If bethesda cant remove individual items, they had to just make them "normal guns" in order to move forward with higher level guns.  There will be a new "TSE" but it will be rare, and pretty cool to see someone with one.
---
A tad pricey bro i would say 5 - 10k would be good for all. Could have it work closer to wow style. A growing cost for repeated use that slowly decays with time.
---
People need to stop assuming every Explosive weapon is a Two Shot though - there‚Äôs other strong Explosive legendaries.
---
I'd like a shared stash for other characters on your account as well as one for teammates
---
oh yea I totally did too but I whipped out photo mode first cause it was too good lol
---
Yea it does dude. 
---
[op through the eyes of the lvl 15](https://youtu.be/jLducOdddE4) 
---
Sorry, xbox player or I woulda hooked you up. 
---
Ah, the blind hopeful
---
I am not talking about the balance in reference to armor or perks j am talking about their balance in reference to other legendary modifiers.
---
For example: enemy specific modifiers gives a 30% bonus to a single type of enemy. Two shot gave a 100% to all enemies types. This is unbalanced. Two shot will now give 25% to all enemies. Much more balanced.
---
Explosive gave  100% damage bonus and AOE. No other modifer came close.
---
The nerd will balance them with the other legendary modifiers. They will still be good. In many situations they will still be the best but now other guns will be viable.
---
Doesn't stop me from wanting to knew if there is a better nuke zone.
---
It's the first site 
---
When you're in pacifist mode, and an enemy player walks up and hits you with a melee weapon, it will show a white damage indicator and you will take minimal damage. 
---
Sprinting and bashing. But like others said you don‚Äôt really need it. 
---
I seriously check the ATOMIC shop every day for the princess bed.  Also...want my money?  Make my jetpack smoke rainbow colored!   LOL  
---
FYI - none of the power armor paint paints the jet pack.  annoying.
---
was going to say that.
---
And that is the problem....... Most of the items in the atom shop are lame.  Nobody wants to buy a clown suit they can get in game.  Most people don't want a lame play time paint job for their armor.  Both are stupid.  Give us some Enclave or BoS themed stuff or some cool skins for our characters an we will spend our money Bethesda.
---
See what I mean. Why ask to defend when you just bash any opinion other than yours? It does work, you are just watching too much YouTube. The damage bug was fixed last patch unless you are reffering to the take no damage thing? That's armor that does that. I believe people refer to that as a Meta and they definetly need a nerf on it. 
---
It's under resources, is called fertilizer producer, looks like a wheelbarrow and hay bail, requires 4 razorgrain to make, is really wonky to place down, gets shot up constantly, require 3x more resources to repair with the repair all function, and can't be seen while broken outside build mode.
---
You can use butchers bounty to search the brahmin, meaning you can turn razorgrain into steak % of the time.
---
From what I've read on here, if the power armor mods don't have a specified name then they are for the Excavator.
---
Happened to me some times, I just do nothing a few mins after I log in to avoid this.

Game is getting worse after each patch Jesus....

If I could get the Monster Mash mask as a power armor helmet that would make my day. That or the Mothman mask you see on shrines here and there.
---
You‚Äôve been missing out
---
yeah I use the knuckles when I'm on foot and the sword when in my power armor 
---
whats weird I've had terrible luck at finding weapons then land slide of them recently in shops my best guess is without as many dupe tricks people are having to farm and all they are looking for is tse and dumping any weapons without that in shops without thinking 
---
I believe that the mods such as "calibrated bracers" that dont tell you which kind of power armor it is, are always for the excavator set. All the other mods say which type except that one. 
---
R3/L3 like in destiny to lock would be nice
---
They were detachable.
---
Dang alright, well thanks for responding man!
---
The pumpking
---
Awesome, that‚Äôs what I thought but I‚Äôve never tested it myself, so I didn‚Äôt want to say anything misleading.  Thanks for the extra info!
---
Shit like this is why we can't have nice things 
---
Well God damn you may be right. *Tip hat*
---
I thought for sure that you take reduced damage anyways until you engage in PvP, and pacifist mode simply stopped you from doing damage. My b.
---
Ive never come across any skins i believe
---
I thought the head weighed around 10-11lbs. XD
---
How do i place one?
---
fight mole miners its basically all they carry and you can stock up on black titanium same time 
---
also I think its a weekly challenge since dailys are mostly 5-10
---
yes...  umm.  have u been inside bunker 3?  i hope all that becomes camp items at some point.  however, some outfits/paints may be waiting for you for free in there already ;)
---
No and I've got multiple spares. 
---
Nope. If someone attacks my base its an invitation for murder, so I enjoy the free ride.
---
Expect someone to plunder your camp. Store your workbenches and 90% of your costs are gone. 
---
Even then most building materials are easily acquired. 
---
People who attack food productions are cancer though. Dont touch my tatos. 
---
No I think you are correct.  It‚Äôs been a while since I played FO4 but I thought the same thing when I started 76, so I think you are right that they used to be detachable.
---
If your level 50 character finds a great level 15 weapon, wouldn't it be nice to have a reliable way to give that to your level 15 character?
---
This. 
---
-items are lacking. (looking at the trailers colored PAs
---
-with the current speed of feeding new items i'm sure the majority can unlock things just by plaing the game, releasing a few basic colors for armors and weapons once would probably mean more money for them...
---
Thank you good sir!
---
It happens... I found a level 40 shovel in flatwoods before I hit level 10.
---
If they are stable then they are already pure, look at them in pip boy and they will say what they turn into when scrapped, pure flux!  Raw flux will need hardened mass, glowing mass and high radiation fluids combined to make them stable.  The chemistry table will tell you how many of each you will need.  Hope that helps.
---
yeah the game runs fine when people aren't intentionally trying to crash the server you're on to duplicate stuff
---
There was a patch just released earlier this week for consoles. 
---
PC will be getting the latest patches first, since they are the easiest to work on incase something doesn't work out. 
---
The next patch will be at the end of this month..... like Bethesda mentioned.....a quick Google search will yield you better and faster results than to wait for answers on here. Just saying......
---
Have you tried to rebuild it from the ground up?
---
Yeah good to know! Thanks for confirming!
---
Well how will you handle getting one shotted by a stealth melee when you cannot one to even five shot them back? That is the only defense a rifleman has against that build. Kill them before they kill you in a single hit. Stacking full resistance to not be one shotted by melee you are pretty much doing the damage of the alien blaster at that point.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that it won‚Äôt let you ‚Äúrepair all‚Äù sometimes even when the structures are damaged...
---
Actually, you're right.  That's what causes it.
---
Yes...same!  Healing factor is good too :)
---
I remember the first nuke zone when I had Rad Sponge perk and shared with my team.  OMG!  life changing!  Nuke zones had just felt like never ending Radx, RadAway, shoot shoot, repeat
---
Have all the same gear. All they have to do is stagger you. A good shotgun build will do it if they get a few shots in. Only guarantee is to kill them before the stagger procs.
---
This ^
---
I've had it with these monkey-fighting math problems on this monday to friday sub!
---
I can get behind that kind of pvp, but as of right now most of it that I've experienced devolves into griefing quickly
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but this is what I believe to be the case.
---
Any mod you craft onto a weapon via workbenches is one you've either unlocked via scrapping similar pieces or reading a plan. You can make as many of those as you wish. If you decide to change, say your scope on a gun, more than once, the previous modification and the supplies you use just gets deleted. 
---
Mods you find in the wild and at vendors under the mod tab, are one time use. They do not use resources like mods you have to craft. They'll show up in the work bench as an option to craft onto an item just once. 
---
I play a vats crit pistol no stealth build with a focus on max AP and AP Regen.  I can say without a doubt 3 in concentrated fire is game changer. Currently, the dmg bonus is not working but the to-hit bonus is working and it's amazing. With a lot of AP I can use Concentrated fire to snipe mobs at Max range with my pistol in vats or take out groups of 8+ level 60+ mobs without leaving vats while standing in the middle of the road Gunslinger high-noon style.  I don't recall the last time I was not fighting in vats - with AP regen, food, grim reaper etc.  If you run out of AP just reload and boom your full again. This game is not a good twitch style fps game- however, vats turns this game into a truly fun shooter.  With focus on vats you can turn a corner and come upon 6-8 mobs...3 rush you - you pop vats on the charging close range mobs-  headshot, crit the next one, head shot the next. The remaining ranged mobs will have low percent headshot and lots of torso armor...take out the legs with high percentage shots - when crit repops headshot. Lots of fun!
---
No. There is not an option to do so. You have to wait for it to be destroyed. 
---
The repair all in the camp station is only for destroyed items. 
---
To be fair, when I started the game, I didn't want to talk to anybody. Was too interested in how the mechanics worked. How do I not die? Oh, someone wants to talk or trade or something...maybe later.
---
That only repairs destroyed items. Not damaged ones. 
---
Oh cool, Thanks for that!
---
**screams in duper**
---
The spawn will not happen if someone had a camp in the area it stops it from happening. The spot is an amazing camp spot as well so you will see it used alot.
---
Are you sure? I got the reflex of removing pacifist mode for a few minutes to defend my workshops, then turning it back on. Is that actually non needed?
---
see I'm basically the desired audience for atom shop as I'm a huge buyer of costumes to customize characters and spend a unholy amount to do it
---
andddddd I've got like 10$ worth of atoms day one to grab a few things and never bought any more sense as the in game costumes are more immersive then the atom shop ones
---
few ideas  
---
In game items pack - lets us reskin in game items - for instance a pack that lets us add responder logos to different in game outfits   
---
Reskin gas masks - lets face it we all wear them sooner or later so why not add some more varieties of them  
---
a pack that just lets us craft 10 in game outfits for a dollar so we can use them on demand 
---
I mean there is a lot of immersive things that wouldn't take much time to make and could be sold cheaply to make the game more immersive and people less hateful of the atom shop so why not do it?  
---

---
The Atom Shop is Creation Club all over again. Sparse offerings and a lot of 'meh' options.
---
I honestly have no idea why Bethesda courts the wrath of public opinion when they release these things. Is it really worth the blowback you get?  The returns must be garbage compared to what they \~could\~ get if they just released a cash shop that had many cool items. It's not like they lack the assets.... \*says hello to the hundreds of FO4 assets that are not in this game for inexplicable reasons\*
---
Truly odd. It's like Bethesda has a brahmin handling their cash shop lol. 
---
TSE weapons are OP, just as melee is. The nerf is deserved.
---
There are TSE players that can literally one shot the queen.
---
His name is a clue. It's Wooby. That's military slang for the poncho liner that commonly gets used as makeshift security blanket by deployed soldiers.
---
He's in there to provide comfort to the devs/QA testers who miss having the comfort of living human NPCs in the world.
---
Doesn't mean human NPC's will never make a comeback via DLC, but it's not a clue that they will be.
---
Once more people switch to melee it will be more well known so I am expecting a nerf will come to melee soon
---
Wait!  There's the solution to all the duped TSE's - change them all to AH's. 
---
End of fallout 76 if its true lol
---
I have no reason to be tilted I literally have a unkillable bloodied build
---
All scrap should be able to be bulked. Makes zero sense that only half of scrap is. 
---
Tse has the strength of melee without having to close the gap/expose yourself to harm. It‚Äôs apples and oranges. Tse had its time and its over, accept it.
---
Not sure why anyone would want to nerf the spawn for the Vendor Bot.  
---
Not sure about recent patches but my teammates  gun placements agree with me
---
Mules arent all played at the same time. 
---
I know this, and I know what OP was saying as well. It was more so just my thought, not a response to anything in particular.
---
I believe the ones made at the fabricator were not made using 'found materials' but with specific quest items.
---
All I see is a barrel and scope
---
I've learned almost all of them and have credit for 4. 
---
It's telling that your mind breaks down players into those two extreme categories. xD  
---
I would love to meet these melee that 10 shot a queen. TSE needs the nerf hammer swung hard fuck these weapons. I don't enjoy mine anymore everything is a joke.
---
Mind you we have been saying for a long time this was comming. Yet 1000s have bought TSE weapons with real money from ebay alone. 
---
All weapons need balancing and i am sorry but TSE out does most other effects and makes all pve content a joke.
---
Bethesda time to nerf stimpacks and concrete extractors. Too OP in PvP. 
---
yes, and there are other combinations that are just as egregious. but I don't see them ever brought up, maybe because there are not enough people screaming nerf pls in the front page.
---
that's my point. people in this community know nothing about the mechanics in the game. they'll just parrot whatever the hivemind wants nerfed because it's been mentioned enough times. you think 36k damage is bad? just imagine the shit I can pull.
---
I just found the Cranberry Glade two days ago and was excited as it was one of the ones on my list but it never registered on the challenge. 
---
Most i see camped there don't know about it. If you see them around the camp let them know. You will see them want to move fast lol.
---
Bound to be leaked
---
I dont know if its possible, but instead of straight damage, it could add effects for each mutations, so radioactive isotope adds rad damage, eagle eye adds crit damage, marsupial adds range, eletrically charged adds electric damage, twisted musvle adds bash, etc.
---
It could be split into affix and prefix (major/minor) legendary effects so you could need mutant's mutated laser to get all the possibilities. 
---
I've never run the numbers, but I can certainly tell you that an armor-piercing handmade rifle does just slightly less damage to a scorchbeast compared to a 2-shot lever gun with a much higher base damage number.
---
Here's the stats and pics of each for comparison.  The handmade is my close quarters option and the lever gun is for long range shooting.  The lever's hip fire accuracy is not good and the durability degrades rather quickly, even with 5 ranks of gunsmith.
---

---
I have tank killer 3, but neither rifle has an armor piercing mag.  The lever gun has no option, and the 85 round drum is just too good compared to a 10 round piercing mag.
---
I understand that there's a limit to how much armor penetration you can get, so if you're using tank killer and an armor piercing weapon, it's probably safe to go with a drum or quick change extended mag.
---
I can get you some of the stuff with my alt - I know the cultist dagger is one of the level locked items.  Harpoon fun is the same IIRC.  Interested in trading for BOS shielded and Ultracite servos.  Will have to check later but feel free to trade them if you find someone sooner.
---
Srsly? How???
---
But I theoretically would hit the limit cap for the level 50+ characters weapons/ armor. Plus the level 15 would out grow the lower level weapons. I understand what you mean. I have played destiny. I just think it would not make sense to have shared stash until the limit would be a lot higher than It currently is.

 it needs 30 minutes coding, and it's too much work to ask.

Today it is TSE. Tomorrow it is Melee. Soon it is Critbased Weapons. Then it is the Cryolator for being able to freeze you..  
---
Seriously. This is all you gonna get when you listen to people claiming something being OP without researching why that weapon was so overpowered.  
---
But go ahead. Nerf the TSE weapons. Punch everyone who farmed honestly and hard for months to get such a weapon and punish them.   
---
Then people cry around the melee will be op. Then you have to nerf that. Then somethign else is OP. Then you have to nerf that too.  
---
And soon everyone who had their fun in Fallout 76 starts calling it the worst game you ever made (again).  
---
Simply because you listen more on people who have no damn clue about what the issue really was instead of to those who try to reason with it and end up having to do that over and over and over again. Simply because you will always have to nerf the "strongest" weapon again and again. And soon we all run around with nerfdart guns. 
---
First my wife was in the process of building it up second it's not plunder it's senseless destruction with no benefit and no provocation and third the guys over fifty levels above me and over 100 levels above my son so it's kind of bullying and lastly he wiped it out even down to the damn melons
---
you should get your eyes checked. the front page is either news or circlejerking about how great of an experience Fo76 is. and anyone who dissents is downvoted to hell and met with sarcasm.

My gut tells me melee will get looked at eventually.

Specifically str and how it gives linear bonuses to melee.

Diminishing returns is easy to implement.

Bloodied can be looked at too.

Passive protects other players from you. It does not protect you from other players.

I was thinking that tonight.  Probably should. They all seem to be 20-40 level player camps.

I'm on PC, which is unfortunate.  I'd love to help you guys out.  Good luck!
---
Good call!   Now I‚Äôm even more into body-snatching factions 
---
I wouldn't want to always it to remember but if you could while fighting a mob "favorite" that body part just for that fight I think it would be cool!  Especially for long fights like SB or queen etc.  I use Concentrated fire to take out different body parts on different mobs depending on opportunity, distance, weakness, etc.  
---
I use vats 99.9% of the time and absolutely love concentrated fire.  A vats focused, max AP, max AP Regen gunslinger is just fun as heck.
---
I disagree.  Outside of the faction war and conversations, the game is a *lot* like Fallout 4.  In fact, it capitalizes on my favorite aspect of 4 and Skyrim: the way the game morphs around what you want to do.  It's an entire game built upon the same principles one of my favorite quests in Skyrim, the Aetherium Forge.  It even made the settlement system into something I care about, because now it's *my* house we're talking about.
---
And like Fallout 4, there will inevitably come a point where I put it aside and stop playing because I'm "done" with it.  Not because the game told me it was over, but because I had played it to my satisfaction and the desire to grind for the best of everything held no appeal and I don't really consider it "the game" as others do.  For me, "the game" was getting to that point in the first place.  Exploring new territory, being outmatched, having to run from things I couldn't kill.  That was thrilling stuff.  Outside of the Glowing Sea or some of the areas around Quincy, Fallout 4 never had that.
---
I don't see how that's any less "the game" than the grind.
---
I'm just so happy with the consolation prize of the first three games that were included with my pre-order edition.
---
Sure, it depends on how they track that. Easiest one would be to just scan inventories for too high amounts of things that can't be had in that quantity. And in that, there's no difference.
---
Yeah I agree. Reddit is the complaint section for griefed victims to vent. It does seem they are over relying on the complaints on Reddit. 
---
Dammit, fine, I'll try it out. I started a new character and have relied heavily on Excavator for the extra carry weight and of course while looking for shocks I find a x01 jetpack instead (I wasn't even hopping, wtf right?) Now I just have to figure out how to get under 220 weight... I don't know why I am so heavy :(
---
No consequence?  You ever fire a TSE?  If enemies get too close it‚Äôs a useless gun unless you are a fan of suicide by splash damage.

Yes it does. If you're on Xbox you can come to my camp today and I will prove it to you. 
---
Well, from your own quote "an online game with **large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server.**" Fallout 76 does not have hundreds to thousands of players on the same server. So it's not an MMO. 
---
I would define this game as a multiplayer online survival game, multiplayer online role-playing action game, etc. But it is not an MMO. Developers of the game don't call this an MMO. Publishers of this game don't call it an MMO. It's not an MMO. People just have been playing fast and loose with the tag for too long, and it's starting to lose meaning.
---
As an example, EVE Online (released in '03), right this minute, has a single, persistent game world, with 33,426 players on it. Big battles in EVE have 2,000-3,000 players in the same solar system, shooting at each other, with hundreds on the same grid (direct line of sight). That's an MMO. An old school, "classic", single-shard MMO. As good as it gets.
---
Now look at Guild Wars ('05 release), the towns/trade hubs had dozens of players (a hundred?), but when you ventured into the world to do missions, you could only do so with your group, or solo. The developers specifically said it wasn't an MMO, they called it CORPG (Competitive/Cooperative Online RPG). Because outside of the hubs, the game was down to just 4 players.
---
By that same token, Destiny isn't an MMO. Neither is The Division. Battlefield 3, despite having 128 players per server, also doesn't quite qualify as an MMO, because (again from your quote) it lacks a persistent open world.
---
Some people called MAG (on PS3, '10 release) which had 256 players per server, an MMO. Trouble is, the "persistent open world" element was missing, and the game was split into matches. When you join just for a match, do a match, and everything resets, it's not really a persistent world. The developers didn't call it an MMO, but some gaming sites and the Wiki page do. So this one is debatable, depending on how purist you want your MMO definition to be. It meets the numbers quota, but not the rest. Those who see MMOs as purely a numbers game, would consider it an MMO.
---
But FO76, with its 24 people per server? That's less than half the people of a Battlefield 2 server, 10 years ago. There's nothing massive about that. Dark Zone in The Division ('16 release) was 24 people, nobody called it an MMO either, even though Dark Zone was actually persistent.
---
There is some leeway, I'll give you that, when it comes to what exactly is an MMO. EVE ('03) is an old school MMO. If you and I go to the same star system, and jump to the same coordinates, we WILL see each other. It is a highly persistent world, and it is single-shard (one world). WoW ('04) was split into servers initially, so people on different servers would never meet. However, people on the same server (I think player count was between 1,200-1,500 total) could go to exact same location, and would always see each other, interact, etc. This was in vanilla WoW. More recently, WoW added phasing (phasing was even in vanilla, but only used when you were dead, no living players were phased out). This meant two players, on the same server, could go to the same location, but NOT see each other, because they would be in different phases. It was still an MMO, but not a "classic" old-school MMO like EVE or Ultima Online, where wherever you go, there you are. You never blink in and out of existence for the observer, unlike current WoW.
---
Age of Conan ('08) release, is a funky one. People called it an MMO. Player base was split per server, and the world was split into persistent zones. Trouble is, whenever the number of people reached a certain limit, another instance of the same zone was created. And nobody was quite sure what that limit was. So, say the zone was called Khopshef Province. You'd talk to your friend on the phone, "Where are you?" And he'd say "By the pier, just arrived to Khopshef!" and you go "I don't see you." And then you mouse over to the corner of the screen, and see you are in Khopshef 5, and your bud is in Khopshef 11. You don't see each other, you can't interact with each other, even though you're in the same place. And if the cutoff for the instance was less than 100 people (and I have an inkling it was closer to 60-80), then technically it wouldn't be an MMO. Yes, the *server* could hold a thousand people. The zone could hold hundreds. But when the zone is subdivided into instances, which cannot see or interact with one another, which only hold 60-80 players, it's no longer massive. No longer an MMO. It's a highly debatable topic, but I never viewed AoC as an *actual* MMO because of instancing limiting the *actual* player numbers to 60-80 max.
---
Elder Scrolls Online ('14) is another interesting one. It's an MMO, imho, but with a caveat. Players are split by servers, but these are megaservers, one for North America, one for Europe. So the numbers, per server, are tens of thousands of players. So far, an MMO. World is persistent, still an MMO. Trouble is, once again, phasing. Beyond a certain point, the game once again starts putting people in the different phases of the same zone. But unlike AoC, which let you know which phase you were in, ESO does not, it is completely hidden. However, the game does a good enough job of putting players together. Like, if you group with someone and come to where they are, the game will already have you phased into their instance. So it looks like they've been there all along, even though they weren't. And the cap per instance seems higher than AoC, it is not unusual to have 50-60 people on screen at once. More importantly, the game's persistent PvP zone holds 3 factions, and roughly 300 people per faction. I've never seen more than 200 on the screen at once, and it was a shitshow FPS-wise, but in theory nothing is stopping you from seeing all 900 on the screen at once, except the client/server would probably crash. Which happened in WoW as well (vanilla). When ~150 Horde went to Ironforge, and ~150 Alliance came out to defend, the server died, and stayed dead for a few hours. This was '04-05, but when EVE can pull off 2-3k, it's not very impressive. Bottom line, ESO, in some areas, potentially goes to hundreds of players on screen, maybe up to 900, so it's an MMO.
---
Oh, speaking of EVE. With 3k player battle, the game server cluster couldn't keep up with the number of player inputs, so what they did was add time dilation to the game. When you jump into a system with too many players, time slows down, locally. An action that would take 30 seconds, like warping to the sun of the system, would take 2-3 mins. But what this did was allow everyone's inputs to be properly processed. If you activated your shields, and did so before the other guy fired his guns, even if the server takes 10 seconds to actually process it, your shield would stop his shots. Which is a pretty amazing technical achievement, I think nobody managed to replicate this, or the numbers, in MMO world yet. 
---
TL:DR - FO76 isn't an MMO. 
---
You win the internet for the day!
---
Use mic lol

So I haven't played the game since late December so I don't know if they've added it yet but hey. So whilst I haven't personally unlocked the terminal, my friend at Bethesda is friends with some of the high ups one of which knew the rough details he also told me that the terminals data had been leaked here: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/ATLAS_Observatory_terminal_entries
---
haha, oh wow. you people really don't know shit about Fo76, do you? it's ludicrous that Bethesda actually takes your "feedback" in account.
---
you can raise melee damage per click to something like 15K+. *legitimately*, without bobbleheads.
---
yes using a bobble head exploit, the problem isn't the weapons themselves
---
Wow your an idiot....
---
Rifle Gaming is a rip off artist he learns about things from others and then doesnt give credit or does and still tries to pretend its his idea. Such garbage. Much wow.
---
Also for the record even looking at it relative to armor and perks it is not balanced. You are using a full set of legendary armor with mods a maxed out perk and mutations to counter 1 legendary mod (because everything you are doing is only countering the edplosive) and a perk. That is not balanced.
---
Many of my high level friends are already doing that knowing the patch is coming
---
I've run into him twice.  I bought both of the clocks, but didn't know he sold rare cosmetic clothing.  I usually travel to Charleston Station to do my vendoring, and always run over to where the grafton monster is, kill it, run back and see what spawn I get.

Even by non ass-game design standards, I think you‚Äôre right!
---
I figured out a way to not stagger. Even the quad double barrel enforcer combo doesn‚Äôt work on my setup. That was the old counter. 
---
And you‚Äôve apparently never tried to max a character in a fallout game before.
---
Mods, in this game, seem to contain the materials needed to install them.  Hence you actually need a separate mod for each arm/leg.  Very different to a plan which is ‚Äújunk‚Äù dependent.  This is a big change from FO4.
---
This...This is the hill (plant) you chose to die on. 
---
prove it.
---
Yep, got it. Goes nice with my camo suit and camo PA paint. Turns out I like camo.

I would imagine that flapping those giant wings would be like a human constantly running.  You couldn't do it forever.  You'd get tired and have to come down.  The birds that spend a lot of time in flight, like vultures and eagle, are basically gliding around, not flapping.
---
The problem with the sonic blast spam is that the visual effect is overwhelming.  You can't see what the heck is going on when the green Cheerios start flying.  It's even worse when you're in the Cranberry Bog and have one of those surface-to-air missile launchers involved.  It's a visual mess.
---
I scrapped my black rimmed glasses...so pissed and cannot find any.  To be honest, It was late and I might have been drinking so...
---
But, we seriously need this!
---
Adrenaline and fireproof make 3 in each mandatory imo.
---
??? I do this with rank 3 hard bargain and they're only going for 25, I guess you're boosting charisma/have it at a high level?
---
I only use atoms earned in game.  I'm not going to spend real money on it
---
I think the legendary Mutants effect doesn't even work.  Last time I checked, it just had the same damage as a regular non legendary weapon (and yes, I am mutated). 
---
My OCD knows no bounds!
---
The same gear will eventually show up in pvp servers too. There needs to be a total damage reduction cap. You can already get 95% explosive resistance with just perks and 1 mod for 1 piece of gear.
---
My eyes are fine, literally the first three posts are petty complaints.. you can‚Äôt say anything bad about this sub because people either love the game too much or hate it. 
---
And the fusion generator, and the decontamination shower... it sucks.
---
The attacker sounds like an ass... I mean if they were RPing a raider it's reasonable, but using the invite function to track down camps is a dick move, not an IC move.
---
In the end though, I never understand these grief stories. As soon as he started attacking, why not just log out? Also, you can easily repair the camp with the click of a button, so is it really a big deal? 
---
Last thought... something is wrong with your claim that your account is being suspended or banned for saying the word 'fuck'. VERY wrong. It makes zero sense on two levels... one, this game has no language rules I've seen when it comes to casual swearing, and two, why would you ever be suspended or banned for using a word that NO ONE CAN PROVE YOU USED, since it's all over mic and I can't imagine Bethesda is using resources to record all of our conversations?  So like, this guy submits a report and on his word alone they just up and shut down your account for a period of time? What?  If this is really what happened then this game would be a griefer's paradise because they'd just run around reporting everyone and getting their accounts shut down over nothing.
---
No, I don't really buy into this part of the story. I'm not saying you're a liar, OP, but I feel like something has been misunderstood here. Maybe you had the account lock for some other reason, like accidentally stumbling into an exploit?
---
And the award goes to....
---
I'm not opposed to a small nerf, but the nerf is way to hard espeically considering I hate how everything is a bullet sponge in this game without godly weapons I hate having to use 100s of rounds to kill a super mutant.
---

You have to wait now. :\
---
If you check your map there's a carry weight at the bottom right. When you first load in it doesn't seem to count your perks. I've been using that to judge when everything is ready.
---
Like a foot race whilst doing a handstand.
---
Add malduke its my psn i can do it for mats 
---
You seriously thought a kid that sounds 10 was a dev? Nice try bro..
---
I'm not gonna condone attacking low level players ever, thats shitty for sure and petty as hell.
---
But it is a part of the game as a whole and only one real incident. 
---
That said, he deserves nuked for what he did to them melons and Id do it myself if I could. Thats real gangster tears shed for those melons.
---
So while I will agree that it shouldnt happen quite like that and people should stay in their respective lanes, it does happen, and a reason I rarely accept team invites. 
---
So perhaps instead of removing something fun (for the aggressor, preferably of an equalish level to the defender) there should be a cost mitigation from pvp destroyed equipment until lvl 25+
---
He‚Äôs fine to be with as long as you don‚Äôt call him bloated.
---
This is the reality...
---
Explosive weapons are a problem.
---
Bobble head stacker are a problem.
---
Two Shots are NOT the problem though - they just get a bad rep due to the other effects above.
---
Yeah you have to wait meanwhile any mobs that spawn in your vecinity do not lol
---
I use photo mode when action is happening all the time, I took multiple shots and didn't choose the ones with extra stuff in the frame. #hater
---
One nitpick - the numbers don‚Äôt quite line up.
---
Explosive is more like a 2-3, not a 1. Even with rough numbers. I know you‚Äôre just illustrating and not going for super accuracy. Even still I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs loads better than two shot rn.
---
What system lol i have some low level toons that could use a good weapon lmao
---
Til they ban you for it. Many people are getting banned for quality of life mods
---
I don't know, I don't have a ton of experience, but I know as a level 50+ I've found some decent legendary weapons that were level 25.  Even if my second character would outgrow the level 25 weapon, it would be nice to have while it "fit"
---
Cleaver. But the problem is, Bethesda. If I have 600+ Steel scrap/bulk, it shouldn't use my mods before it finishes using my standard steel scraps. Trust me, I've been that guy just like you. I know. But when you craft ammo, you're not paying attention if you're mods are being scrapped or not. Anyways, I'm not the only one. Everyone is having this issue. (Maybe not specifically solely you). 
---
Even after the nuclear apocalypse golf clothes are way over priced.
---
speak up and don't be shy
---
No it was not in 4 and so far 3 star is the highest unless you put one of the very few mods on that make it a 4star
---
I literally saw this last night and marked it on my map!
---
Don't look Ethel!
---
Mate. I hate to be the one to tell you. Darth Vaper isn't from Star Trek, he's from Battlestar Galaxy.
---
You're cooked, mate. Next you're going to tell me Samwise Tarley is in Vikings and not the Shannara Chronicles.
---
Honestly, I have no idea.  I've used a missile launcher maybe a handful of times in every fallout game that had them.  I'd imagine demo expert works, because the missile explodes.  If it doesn't, it should.
---
RNG is random number generator, which is the system games like Diablo, Fallout and many others use to create what drops in an enemy's loot.
---
They did what was necessary. 
---
I‚Äôm adding this to my laundry list :) 
---
&gt;Accidentally hit "rest" while fighting ghouls...ended up napping next to this snoring guy
---
ok. but it illustrates my point regardless, it's stupid shit like that gets on the frontpage. 
---
Speaking of the mothman cult have you seen the gas mask version of the cult mask on corpses? I've seen it on like 2 bodies but not as a pick up item. Any idea of we can actually find it and wear it?
---
So. Someone destroyed your CAMP and you got banned?
---
Perfect. Kinda proves CAMP smashing  is a mechanic &amp; yall shouldnt be swearing at people that do it because the devs intended it to be part of the game!
---
Block n' Hop next time. (If you dont wan a fight the guy).
---
Imo the game has enough mechanics built in to avoid getting "greifed" like this. 
---
i need a facepalm emote, all those countless times i would‚Äôve needed it before i started using discord..
---
Ouch. It's my shielded road leathers I'm always nearly selling/scrapping. Accidentally scrapped my PA once too but luckily it just scrapped the frame and put the pieces in my inventory.
---
Delete this post. We need this bug to stay.
---
No one has been banned for modding and even devann and Jess said if anyone believes thats the case to submit a ticket to support right away.
---
This does not include cheat engine or reshade as people did get ban for using them.
---
I got those! I want the... Everything else lol 
---
It's a login spawn. You can't just drop a camp on someone's head otherwise
---
I bet it's a tiny minority that ever did
---
They should allow us to customise our armour by selling individual pieces instead of full sets.
---
Sell LEFT and RIGHT Legs separately, Same for the Arms and a torso and helmet paint job. All for about 200 Atoms each and then we'll get some real individuality out in the wasteland.  Even just plain colours would be better than nothing.
---
Sure, but the point is that bloodied will still be incredibly strong. They should not have nerfed two shot, just explosive. If they were going to nerf two shot they should nerf bloodied.
---
They've publicly denounced exploits multiple times. This is the first public acknowledgement of duping though, and they probably waited to do so until they had a system in place to track it.
---
It doesn't make a lot of sense for a company to tell people how to cheat before they've figured out how to stop it. 
---
Dude, you don't NEED marsupial to do this one quickly. There's a stairway in the wall behind the first spot you're saying to jump. You don't even need to jump the FIRST jump, just run up between the bleachers, take a left, go around the corner, and there's a stairway to the top directly on your left side. Takes less time to just run up the stairs than it does to jump twice, especially if you miss that second jump. Also, the legendary is often on the lower level anyway, so it's better to run the stairs instead.
---
Nope not exaggerating.  Infact just crashed right now trying to fast travel to whitespring station.  It's only when in a Nuke zone I'm getting a lot of crashes. 
---
Also did the queen about 6 times and the second nuke always crashes someone from our party.   The disconnects are worse than they have ever been.
---
Make sure you visit a couple of times over different days. I‚Äôve gotten different outfits from there üòÅ  like 4 types 
---
It varies a little between console and PC.
---
On PC, you need someone on your friend list. You join the server they're on (Social-&gt;Friends-&gt;Select their name, click Join). Go someplace quiet, where there's a world container (suitcase, burlap sack, box, drawer) and put your stuff in it. Exit to the main menu, select another character, and again join that person on your friend list. Go to that same container, and get your stuff.
---
This is a little risky, because if your "anchor" friend hops to another server, you can't get to the same one where your stuff is. If the server crashes or shuts down while you're switching, items are gone also. If someone finds your stuff while you're switching, they can just loot it (it IS normal world loot at that point). So it's not 100% safe.
---
On consoles, it's supposedly easier, because you can also join people on your Recent list (so, Social-&gt;Recent-&gt;Select name-&gt;Join). But I play on PC, so I'm not 100% sure. But the same caveats as above apply.
---
I've transferred many guns, and tons of ammo, only lost one "shipment" when my anchor server-hopped. Hopefully in future they will also let us have the option of "Join Last Server", this would eliminate the need for anchors at all. 
---
I mean... I didn't say I hope OP gets unbanned.
---
I hope Bethesda gets to the bottom of it. Maybe that means they figure out OP actually is/was duping and uphold the ban.
---
Errrr how would bulking to to make room for more items make storage instability better?
---
Me, I'd change servers. I would never try pvp with my crafting character  that would be silly. But if I was playing my pistol build, I'd probably jump around a lot to avoid melee. Shame on me for not paying attention to my surroundings.
---
There is work to do on pvp, but I dont have the pvp experience to contribute. However I pve A LOT. Tse is a huge problem in pve. A lvl 25 1 shot explosive shotgun is enough to clear the bunkers. Anyone teaming up with that person ends up following them around handing them shotgun shells. Fun the first time sure, but gets old for everyone. With so many epic level guns available, the whole base game was just way too easy. 
---
A lot of people pve, and a lot of pvp players are "raiders" hunting soft targets. Pvp maps are coming, that is where balancing will be important 
---
 But this nerf should improve the game for pve and raiders. I hope.
---
Thanks for the tip! 
---
It takes a lot of your budget so make sure you have enough space for it. 
---
Nearly all skins have to be purchased via the Atom-Shop. There is only a hand full you can get by doing missions or following secrets. Like the BoS PA skins and the Nuka Cola PA skin.
---
I've got all this Abraxo, and that tub and toilet are nasty.  Meh, think I'll just scrap it. 
---
Eh. The only thing I‚Äôd disagree with is:  
---
&gt;&gt; everybody who did it knew exactly what they were doing and decided to do it anyway.  
---
There are a number of people who picked up a bag with 50000 of something in it. I almost did when the grenade leveling glitch worked. We forget. Reddit is a very small percentage players (especially since half this sub‚Äôs subscribers seem to only be here to troll). Banning some young kid, who is not a redditor, and doesn‚Äôt know that duping even exists, just because he saw a bag of 50000 screws and thought he hit the jackpot of some hardcore player kinda sucks. I think that‚Äôs why they allow for appeals. Yes, everyone who duped knew what they were doing, but not everyone with fat stacks got them from duping.    
---
Until Bethesda has a launcher with a news feed, we have to accept that some people just don‚Äôt know any of the hot topics we see here six times a day.  
---
:-(
---
Well played Psycho. Well played
---
You don't absolutely need it, but at some point, the ability to cripple limbs becomes very nice to have.  You could, of course, shoot in the general area where the legs are and do it (particularly with a Shotgun), but when it comes to something like a Scorchbeast, it's convenient to have VATS lock on.
---
Whatever, my dude rocks the sharpshooter, chic, and laying down to pose in pictures all the time.
---
When did I say that? I was asking I anyone else had this type of experience 
---
I read a suggestion about adding a dragonrend sort of mechanic to force them to land. I think that'd be pretty cool
---
Lol are you serious?
---
Server limits are per character. Muling is not a proving point that storage size is tied to server stability.
---
The weight exploit proved it easily.
---
Yeah the scene is in both.
---
In Fallout 4 weapons were capped to one legendary effect to one weapon or armor with a few exceptions like  Kremvh's *Tooth* which has the Sacrificial Blade Machete mod. 
---
If that is the case, I really wish bethesda would let us use curved walls. I wanna make a dyson camp!
---
Maybe they just don‚Äôt care what you have to say?   /s
---
Ticket worked fine for me earlier. 
---
What are the odds? Brilliant. Lmao
---
I crash a couple times per hour since the most recent patch.
---
Crashed very rarely before the patch
---
Worst legendary is "junkies"
---
The reason for the nerf is the same reason you will never be longer able to find them naturally in game anymore. They want all of the explosive two shot weapons to fade away to never be used again.
---
I pay attention and know others do as well.  It‚Äôs a tedious game where you have to pay attention.  Still don‚Äôt see you point beyond ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt paying attention and lost my shit‚Äù. It‚Äôs mama dolce‚Äôs but at a crafting table.
---
Ha nice pun
---
Found the kid with anxiety. Someone call their mom.
---
..... not scrapping mods was part of the same announcement.
---
Hah! This literally JUST happened to me.
---
I found it in a cache. Equipped it to see what it looked like. Immediately fired a 1400 cell ion cannon
---
Pretty sure the numbers referenced are hyperbole, not the actual threshold they're using. 
---
Well that explains it. 
---
I've tried a second run, but unless someone else just fast traveled and is doing a similar farm, nothing new will come out of the pods.
---
Today I did figure out that going into either Watoga High or AMS headquarters seemingly resets the exterior spawns.  It's quicker than a server hop, but only works once.  If you're lucky, you'll also get Monster Mash to pop up in the school, which is a great source of xp.  Now I make a run, pop into Watoga High, hunt for legendaries in there (there's almost always one 3 star in there, usually in the cafeteria area), pop back out, make another circuit and server hop.
---
I know, it‚Äôs crazy. I have a very lazy resistance build that can face tank a mirelurk queen and scorchbeasts. Once I stop being lazy and max Blocker and Fireproof...yeah gg mobs.
---
But you‚Äôre right, and that‚Äôs kinda what I mean. PvP is where everything gets optimized. Also I just realized I wrote something wrong. I mean that I want them to scale back this general wonky PvP they got going now and fix it and also add in more PvP specific things to do.
---
Does it take any to make?  
---
Makes me think of needing springs to repair a plasma gatling, yet it didn‚Äôt take me any to make it from junk...  
---
Only one I've found is a mutant slayer - honestly I'm pretty happy with it considering the sponges those damn SM's are.
---
They just want to be like &gt;!Fortnite!&lt;
---
Yep.  Look under Settings/Game. 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have required anything nor cost anything if you had the pre-made mods.  
---
For me it was weapons. Boarded the legendaries I thought MIGHT be useful - got rid of those and now in X01 with shocks I‚Äôm at 135
---
It's the left mouse button.
---
Jet isnt in game as you cant slow down time in real time games. 
---
And innate how much bobbleheads weight. I've been playing since beta and saved all the ones I've found figuring they'd help with end game content but they just take up space. I've stopped picking them up entirely now. 
---
What good is a bobblehead that makes lockpicking easier for an hour if you can go two hours and not stumble upon any locked safes. I wish they had just been collectables like previous games. 
---
Because it shouldn't?.
---
You found the mods so you can out them on. They only cost if you have the plan because you can then create them.
---
Well, the reply said "Isn't that what they do now" in regards to "no pay-2-win" but then you replied "noooo they don't" and proceeded to discuss underarmours skins, so it seemed as if there was some confusion there.
---
Bethesda's concept for profitability using the Atom Store: "Give them things that look like something they can wear that all their friends will see and say, "man you are so crazy LOLOL!" but then after 2 weeks, nobody finds funny any more so they're ready to buy the next crazy/silly pose/skin/hat we are selling."
---
Now I know to scrap all the bulk I buy before crafting anything. I didn't know crafting stations use  scrap - mods then bulk. A Terrible and overseen UI mechanic that is being addressed. 
---
Really? I'll have to go check that out. :)
---
Not against ghouls...  
---
I‚Äôm not sure but that would be handy
---
Jumping, Power Attacks
---
My in-game name is Shankwell, without the E.  I'm always game to provide fire support on a silo run.  It gives me an opportunity to dust of the power armor I never wear.
---
Not too good. Apparently, Monogah spawns are really good but you have to see what spawns there before you nuke it because liberators and something spawn there as well
---
I haven't found the plan yet!
---
Nice thank you so much! I'll be on in about an hour 1pm est.
---
Well they added a few more bugs in the new patch.
---
Like..
---
* Freezing when spawning in.  Can't move.
---
* Trade slider doesn't stop at 0 and goes to 25k
---
* If you have junk on your person you must remove it to stash otherwise it will say that you don't have the materials to fix, even though you.
---
* Infinite loading screen
---
* Double loading screen.
---
These are facts.  Having people argue we are hating for wanting them to improve the game is only detrimental to the game itself.  
---
Not true melee has an advantage because of the slap system which allows melee to get on top of you without a ranged player being able to harm them
---
For example i wanna know whats the price of a TSE gatling gun or TSE shotgun
---
Ever thought about how hard it would be to buff every other legendary modifer and pve enemy rather than bring two modifiers more inline with all the others?
---
I think they are using nosql instead of database.
---
Technically, nosql reduce the overall difficult of development when dealing with networking and require less hardware workload. Considering their potato server..
---
Which also explained why you laggy as fuck for a small moment after joining the world. The server send you the json string, and your clients start to render json into in game items. Traditional db can avoid this by using on demand query.
---
That also explained why they can't easily do the query like
---
Select account where inventory.certainitem.length &gt; 1000000
---
And ban those accounts during a coffee break.
---
Technical wise, the lead developer, project manager, or whatever position in their company, who may just started their it career, thought nosql(or whatever weird ones they are using) is cool and fun.
---
Then forget about they need to monitor the online game unlike other fallout titles.
---
Ofc there is a solution eventually, but the damage is already done
---
Ah, I see what‚Äôs going on. I thought his response was questioning if Bethesda already had a pay to win theme going on in the Atom Shop. 
---
LOL, me too.  I did buy the hunting rifle camo skin today.  It looks pretty cool.
---
Awww....I actually like the stupid mall music. Reminds me of The Sims for some reason, in a good way. So bland and non-threatening.
---
But seriously though, they could get so much neat stuff, tattoos (face and body) and paint would be a pretty big seller. Hairstyles. Beard styles. All kinds of outfits that aren't just utterly ridiculous. 
---
Really? That's messed up. Why did they get upset that BoS were in it?
---
One of the forum comments is an apologist trying to find greater depth in terms of a definition of ‚Äúexploit‚Äù. Like; he‚Äôs planning on taking it to court.
---
There's a Maxson in 76, too.  Related?
---
I really like that idea. It should be a quest in DLC.
---
Mmm I have marsupial and speed demon and fly everywhere no jet pack lol can only imagine with a jet pack the places I‚Äôll be lol
---
Many do because they want to impress their friends with the new rare silly costume they have. They'll wear it twice and then put it away just in time for Bethesda to tap them on the shoulder and say, "psst - none of your friends own a one piece vault tech footie pajama"
---
classic
---
While I wouldn't be surprised that they do that as well, I'm just looking at the (unessicary) wording "
---
Yes the fort defiance asylum not alephany or whatever north of vault 76 lol!!!
---
no he's right melee can get that sort of damage legit
---
I have the same with my X01 power armor, i use it for like 30 levels or more, i doesnt break or get damaged.  I am not upset about it though 
---
The market is in free fall bro you can almost name your price as dupers try to clear their stocks before the nerf.
---
I also hate having to unlock babies bunker everytime
---
Power -&gt; switch -&gt; door
---
The switch box has a little green light that will tell you if you have power. Maybe check that first to make sure you don't have a misplaced conduit/wire.
---
The terminal can be connected anywhere - even just connected to the generator. You should see a switch control item on the terminal if it can "see" (is on the same circuit) as the switch.
---
19, I think, but two of them are mutually exclusive. So you can have 18.
---
We love the music.  But the items are not inspirational, and the short term offers for overpriced material?  
---
I'd like my dollars to buy a broad wardrobe, not 4-5 things that cost me $40.
---
Same thing has happened to me. Just a metal box with no doors too. Couldn't even fast travel because there were enemies nearby.
---
I mainly sell my excess but keep a bit so I can upgrade legendary wood armor with the shrouded mod that reduces weight, improves sneak, and has more resistance. 
---
\*tips fedora\*
---
Today you've discovered perks. ;)
---
I'll note as some others have that I think one of the most exploited elements of pacifist mode is that even if I have it on, if I own a workshop, I can be flagged into pvp if someone tries to claim it and they can fast travel to me and kill me anywhere on the map since my node is visible. It is griefing and in my opinion harassment and should be bannable, as well as fixed. 
---
no, bethesda put in as little extra work as possible to bring out this game. 
---
They don't sell for anywhere near that. I have hard bargain 3, and run 15+ charisma pretty much all the time. 29 caps.
---
Sell price is only a fraction of the "value" heading.
---
Yeah, I have the plan but it still shows as unavailable....and yes, I read the thing
---
IMO you should be able to store  2-4  weapons, another set of armor, a couple nuke zone runs worth of aid and food, and about 200 of each scap.  My estimate is we need another 300-400 in our stash to make the inventory game more bearable but still fair.
---
 I think they should have had this situation ironed out way before the game came out but I'm fairly certain they will put in shared stash and figure out a new way to deal with stash "weight"...so many other games that they can use as example to deal with stash.  
---
That‚Äôs fine.  You can only log onto one at a time and I don‚Äôt care if you want to stockpile crap you‚Äôll never use.
---
Cheap now that they are getting nerfed
---
Then soon Melee gets nerfed too. Because that sticks out just as much. 
---
You don't realize that trimming down weapons that stick out a bit isn't the answer because every damn time there will be a weapon that does it.
---
Soon you run around with nerfweapons. By that time however i will not care too much about it anymore because i have left the game.
---
Fighting the SBQ with these "normal" weapons once every damn idiot lowlevel player joins that event is already making you feel like you have nerfdarts firing at her. 
---
What do you think happens then? The TSE is nerfed. Then everyone packs out his melee weapons. Uses the stacking bobbleheads there and then makes everyone screech for nerfs on melee weapons. Then those get nerfed. Then next up someone finds the next good weapon to use against her, sticking out. People screech about that, Bethesda nerfs that weapon.
---
But go ahead. If that is what you want?
---
Like whats cheap
---
1000 caps? 
---
In so I can hear the thoughts. Just got plans for both, trying to decide what to go with 
---
Me too
---
Kinda raises the question, why are they constantly adding emotes when they should he encouraging mic use.
---
Let me guess, rad damage is what can kill you.
---
Not when there is 7 lvl 40s killing mobs and only 2 lvl 80s fighting the queen 
---
Guess the plan for it is worthless then. I hope in the near future they will have some
---
damn, my posts never get traction. but yeah, %30 limited time only pajamas??!! OML
---
The problem is just being an asshole.  I get that it's the new normal in online gaming to behave like a complete sociopath, but 76 seems to be different and I want to keep it that way.  If you want to be a creep, play Rust, Unturned, or whatever.  If you want to run around griefing people, I'll make you pay for it if you attack me.  You're free to do it, but I feel inclined to warn others in case they see this guy on their server and want to hop before he can turn a bunch of flux and plants into smoke. (plants are a PITA to fix)
---
I want to collect low level fun legendaries for a new character.  I‚Äôve thrown out awesome level 10 weapons I‚Äôd love to play with at low level.
---
Why this shouldn't be a post: see post.
---
No, I don't relish the idea of farming black titanium, again!
---
Didn't even bother to tickets are just copy paste replies 
---
You forget explosive is aoe damage.
---
I don't have problem either when I pull out my tse shotgun.
---
But full perks pistols still deal less dmg than shotgun even I have no perks for it.
---
Here's what I got outfit wise:
---
Bottle and Cappy Orange Jacket &amp; Jeans

---
I agree in fact nerfing 2 shot and explosive even goes too far. Traditionaly this legendary effect has always doubled damage.
---
Everyone asking for nerfs is an idiot because Bethesda will listen. If we keep asking for nerfs pretty soon it'll take 5 minutes to kill a level 68 super mutant.
---
If they make the game unplayable noone will play it.
---
While I like a challange I also ocassionaly enjoy feeling like a god in PVE
---
Fix all the exploits THEN consider fine tuning damage not nerfing it.
---
Sometimes I feel Bethesda doesn't even play thier own game
---
I would love a Followers of the Apocalypse outfit even if it doesn't fit in with the lore. Not like they give a shit for the history anyways so 'gimme. 
---
I use VATS like crazy. Guaranteed shotgun and sniper headshots work great
---
I think I found Rambo in the Wendigo Cave, a skeleton with a red bandana and a combat knife.
---
I've only had them drop it a few times. You're better off going to lockers and filing cabinets and looting alarm clocks.
---
Well, in essence, that's what a limb cripple perk + relevant gun is.  Enforcer + Marksman's Shotgun = Dragonrend.
---
I didn't know about that until someone here mentioned it, but I like how it is a very *Fallout* solution to the problem.  Of course wings count as limbs!  Why wouldn't they?
---
Neat!
---
I'd like the ability to safely leave one set of power armor out in the crafting stand.
---
Black titanium isnt that Hard, just kill a bunch of moleminers and scrap the moleminers suit 
---
Huh? Ranged player has vats
---
Little spoon 
---
I've only bought a couple of things, the main one being the General outfit, the rest is hot trash
---
Well that sucks. Add it to the sucky list.
---
They redesigned it I believe this game 
---
Oooff X-men plot in here will make me use the syringer  
---
I would like to see more clean skin versions of items like walls, doors, fusion generator, ect... A funky paint job for Raider Power Armor. A Chinese Stealth Suit skin. A stark white Ski suit. BoS camo outfits made for different parts of the map, like an urban camo for towns or a camo of junk to blend in with the Fallout world! Icons for those of us doing melee builds, maybe even mixed icons so people now you're a melee medic or something of the like,and  all the Faction icons would be great too. A high priest version of the Cultist outfit, made even a warrior version also.
---
Ty for this post!
---
And...sounds like I‚Äôm a dumbass. 
---
Pistolets pleaseeee! I wanna be a goddamn post apocalyptic cowboy ü§† 
---
I just played a nuke zone in that town and I can tell you, it's shit! We had NO ghouls, and when we had killed The 5 that were there there was notting left.. Maybe it's different for different servers etc but i do not recomend nuking that part of The map 
---
I use pen&amp;paper, it reminds me of the old school D&amp;D days.
---
i have the white knight and the power patcher perks...the only PA i ever have to repair is my T51b
---
I really didn't have the opportunity to get screen shots, as I was busy defending my house and myself from a guy with an explosive shotgun.  Sorry if I came off as pretentious.  Here's a pic of my unbroken house.  It doesn't prove anything other than my build and the expensive shit I had inside.

---
Close enough. A Nuke ;)
---
I must have a fundamental lack of understanding of the Perk system. I've been told here that by my level of 61 I should have access to all of the perks, but three of the perks named, Lone Wanderer, Blocker,and White Knight are not there.
---
To be clear... all of my Specials are full, no yellow number under them showing available space.
---
Below that, scrolling each catagory with z/c (and arrow keys on the longer ones) does not show these perks.
---
I do have 3 in Armorer
---
Two perks were mentioned without exact names, battery perk and power patcher but I have nothing doing what these are supposed to do.
---
Help! What am I doing wrong?
---
I figured it out. If the mod doesn't have an armor designation for it, then it is for the Excavator set. You can also tell based on the components it would yield, usually 2 black titanium.
---
Ah, that I didn't know.  Knew workshops and killing Deathclaws.
---
I sell junk and extra stims to vendors, the lvl1 pharmakarma gives me ample resources and is light carrying weight.
---
Thanks. Do you think a suppressed combat rifle is better than suppressed handmade rifle? I found one if those the other day. 
---
Are you in PC? Let's do it together! What's your profile name so i can add you
---
I'm really confused about why a "Clown Outfit" is available for purchase when there's already one in the game. The images look the same as the standard in-game outfit, except one image has the hat bent and laying down. 
---
The space suit is at least different. The atom shop one is orange while the in-game one is metallic.
---
Not for me unfortunately, I tried the mods with every set of PA I had including Excavator :/ 
---
Are you willing to pay $10 for it?
---
Did you really need to read the terms of service to know that actively cheating was against them?
---
they made the same mistake on another outfit earlier but they fixed it, i wouldnt be surprised to find more of the wrong flags
---
Unfortunately I'm on xbone.
---
I would try contacting Bethesda then. That is super weird.
---
Sorry this happened. I don't know what keeps me playing this game sometimes. 
---
Been wondering about this myself. Wanting to know what the shadowed mod looks like and haven‚Äôt found a piece I can use forest or urban
---
Well, they had the Stars and Stripes bandana wrong in FO4, too... But other flags have the 13 stars in both games, like the trifold flags.
---
Can I use it as it is though?
---
I have a char just like that. I call him the Naked Mole Rat. He uses a 3-bladed Mole Miner Gauntlet though, not the Deathclaw hand.
---
Thanks a lot for the explanations. I figured it was along those lines.
---
Radiation weapons seem to be made for PvP. However, I have no idea if they would be useful against scorchbeast. Probably great against yau gui?
---
I am not sure what the right patch would be then. Since they are supposed to be officers before the redesign of the flag was at hand if i am right. To my knowledge, the Enclave was the one who redesigned the flag after the bombs fell.
---
Confirming the OP's assertion that late game players  could have up to all seven sets. I don't see many people actually doing what I do (since that's 50 units of stash used up), but I know a few others that do.
---
I picked them up hopping the bobble head stand was still in the game. From what Ive been reading end game is just two shot weapons one shotting stuff end game so I cant think of a situation where 20 or 25 percent extra damage makes a difference ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I realized how much it was worth a couple days ago. I've had the plans for more than a month, and now clearing out the vendors is much easier.
---
Go north from that spot a bit, there‚Äôs a camp on the ground with a long monorail crash, it has 1 entrance. Making a camp there would be cool, barricade the door and set turrets all up in the windows.
---
Dude....chill. I can place that nuke wherever I damn well like. Breaks absolutely zero rules. You cant tell someone how to play a game when they spend good money on it and they aren't breaking rules or griefing other players. Your attitude gives me the impression that maybe YOU are the one that griefs people simply because they are not playing to your standards. Your the kind of person people hate in FO76. PSA- Dont be an obsessive,controlling dick. (you'll never get laid that way kid)
---
I like the Radium Rifle more than the handmade and the combat rifle in terms of handling. It works just fine on auto, too. The noises it makes gets slightly tiresome after a while.
---
They're hard to find and expensive to build compared to Combat and Handmade rifles (handmade might actually be harder to find, but I feel like I've found more of those....) so the mods are tricky to get.
---
It works fine overall. Even while shooting a glowing one. You'll outpace the rad damage even against a player with Ghoulish - obviously not optimal damage in those scenarios but I wouldn't avoid it just for that.
---
I would say even 2k is cheap. As most of the 2 and 3 stars I saw were going for 4K and up.
---
There is blackbird pa

---
Has anyone else been CTDing without an error message constantly since the Jan update?
---
I get CTDs in nuke zones and WS all the time, and since I‚Äôm level 160 ish, I literally can‚Äôt play the end game stuff.
---
I‚Äôm feeling more server lag, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
Was way better before the patch for me. On PC.
---
I've been able to rejoin old servers by server hopping and looking for my paper bag I dropped lol (like Hansel and Gretel, leaving breadcrumbs to pick up my track) it's works 1/5 times 
---
Two Shot and Explosive are legendary modifiers. Melee is damage type. You are comparing apples to oranges.
---
If you are attempting to say that next they may nerf bloodied you may have a point. I wouldn't be upset with that being nerfed either but at least bloodied has the drawback of requiring one to use a low health build.
---
I personally would love for SBQ and all enemies to be harder. This is suppose to be a Fallout game, I know none of the Bethesda ones have been difficult but 76 is a cakewalk. My personal preferences aside though if the SBQ being such a bullet sponge is a problem for you then you should be happy they are nerfing two shot and explosive because by bringing them inline with the other legendary modifer they can tweak ballistic damage as a whole.
---
Line in the Sand and other Cranberry Bog quests.
---
‚ÄúWeight‚Äù is an arbitrary variable and presumably has no real bearing on server load. 
---
Quantity of discrete items to track...that‚Äôs another story. 
---
So if bulking items reduces the quantity of tracked items by 10-20x, that‚Äôs a direct reduction in load. 
---
Assuming server load is the real motivation in limited stash size. And assuming I‚Äôm not being a dumbass on this too. 
---
What am I missing!? How do you all just DECIDE what mutations y‚Äôall getting?
---
Fwiw, the servers seem to be getting better day after day after this last patch, havent had a server disconnect since maybe 4 days ago, I still crash here and there but its definitely gotten better. I'm on PS4 btw. I've been playing since this morning on the same server with no issues (ik it's hard to believe lol)
---
"There is a corpse in there... but if you can look past that it's really cool."

GEH√ÑRTET UND PANZERBRECHEND
---
That's nasty....
---
This is correct.  People also say moving your camp by just a small amount also repairs partially damaged items. 
---
They updated the post and made clear that the weapons will continue to be dropped.
---
Server hopping and travel around the military camps in Cranberry Bog
---
Dunno for sure its the best one, but bos events in watoga (some of them) give you 2 core pear event
---
You just admitted to killing a good portion of this subreddits  diety, nice knowing ya pal.
---
Try buying Skyrim across multiple platforms and in VR. Should fix the issue
---
You're not the first person to want to find and display every teddy bear. I think they should allow it.
---
That's a surprise, thank you though, sounds like it'll work. 
---
I never had to repair mine from level 25-45, but I would see it taking damage. It's just that I would gain 10 levels and craft a new set before anything broke. I believe it just has alot of durability by design. The terminal entries/lore for it talk about having to use black titanium to build it to increase durability for mining purposes. 
---
I have the Shadowed mod on the left arm, color does not change. I haven't tried to use it on any other piece, in fact I only have it installed on it because I can't put fiberglass on that arm.
---
They are insanely easy to get depends on how many you want bro. Just take one day out of your time and grab the 3 workshops thats 8 fusion cores each per hour. Don't reccomend carrying more than 100 on ya with the perk to reduce them by 90%.
---
I grab all three and throw up Netflix and grab them. Don't forget they only stack in threes so check on them every 20 mins or so.
---
This is what I'd like more than anything. For people who are bored with game content, they can all go on one server and beat the piss out of each other and know and expect that it's coming. 
---
People who want to play strictly thru the game content dont have to worry about being attacked. 
---
It's the best solution. 
---
Honestly I rarely if ever use the Excavator armour so it‚Äôs not really an issue for me.
---
That said I‚Äôm with you on your second point. I have no idea what keeps me coming back, because by Christ this game frustrates the shit out of me sometimes üòÇ
---
Are you on PC? We can team up so IF one of us disconnects we can rejoin each other 
---
Im a very mutated boi, and i approve of this idea.
---
I wish the black bloatfly mod made the flies your followers for a while... go around in ‚ÄúBinding of Isaac‚Äù style.
---
Im building it again in the same location to see what it does when I relog.
---
No, that would not be nice. I know exactly how many times I need to scroll up or down every time I target something to hit that particular part. If they remembered which body part I was targeting, I wouldn't know which way to scroll whenever I needed to target a different body part.
---
But would be nice if we could rebind buttons to instantly target a specific body part. Or unbind the weapon wheel from the scroll wheel.
---
Using camp budget to store armor/weapon sets independent of stash would be a great supplement to storage limits, and nice quality of life aspect of switching gear for different builds on the same character. 
---
Even if one armor stand or weapon rack cost as much camp budget as several turrets I would utilize the function. 
---
My melee build has a set of mutants marine armor and a set of unyielding that I carry around all the time. 
---
My rifleman can only really carry 2/3 guns at a time, and extra guns that I use situationally clog up tons of stash space.  
---
Even if it‚Äôs a 5k atom shop exclusive...
---
But it‚Äôs gotta work, and not lose full sets of legendary gear, or allow players to duplicate items. 
---
Where?
---
Fwiw I've never had to repair my raider armor, either. Either it isn't degrading or it's going so slow that I've literally never had to worry about it despite heavy use
---
You can farm them. It is a HUGE pain.
---
Good, good, let the dark side flow through you...
---
I believe Bethesda went on record saying they would not ban users that used non-game changing/unfair advantage mods. I've been using a hi-res map, known plans, and inventory weight mods for a while now with no problems
---
Don't hate me because I'm different üò°
---
Thatd be one funny mechanic though.
---
Side effects- the mutations are 2x as strong after initial effects. 
---
That'll really kick things up a notch.
---
Oh don't give me that. 
---
We are talking about damage done. There is no "apple and oranges".
---
Damage is damage. You people moan about the damage of TSE being too high. Even though the only real problem you don't see yourself are the bobbleheads stacking method.
---
But sure go ahead. You don't know what you got yourself into. 
---
I predict it for you. It doesn't take long till melee gets nerfed too. The damage there can be just as perverted.
---
But if you are blind towards this even after i told you about it, i can't help you.
---
Take all 3 power plants on the map and power the fusion processors, youll get about 15 per hour 
---
Where can you find the plans for these things?
---
Wow. And Beth is a Bethesda employee?
---
Yeah, the thing is I don't play 8 hours per day ,so even if I fought mole miners I'd more probably end with 10-20 shotguns max. 
---
Awesome, definitely upgrading my suite todqy. Been rocking the classic spacesuit since the beta. Love the orange 
---
Take my up vote, you filthy fan! 
---
If you don‚Äôt sprint and are surrendering your combat mobility, you‚Äôre a poor tactician.
---
üôÉüôÉüôÉ good thing In a medic I preformed cpr ?
---
All I'm saying is this is the first instance this has happened to my character and I would have done things differently than my wife but she just likes exploring and building so for the crowd that wants to just be wanderers can they implement some form of no pvp I'm no developer so 8 don't have the answers but it would be nice to include that group in their thoughts since those are the people that have grown FO into what it is now.
---
I was playing with my friends the other day, and I dropped two weapons (TSE IIRC) and instead of going onto my floor, they went under my house. I have no idea why, but it could be anything--the lag spike when I log in, the terrible trade system, or the broken PVP and duper kill squads, but there are so many problems with this unfinished game.
---
Bethesda is lucky they have their consumers to conduct post-release reviews for them.
---
Do you have the red asylum uniform? I will trade you the leather coat for that
---
Just bought Scout Armor Custom Fitted mod again for fun. Tried with both 3\* Armorer and 3\* Power Smith at the same time. Tried to mod it on all five armor parts on both urban and forest. Doesn't show up as a mod. It's because it's a leg specific mod and not a limb mod. Specific body part mods are broken at the moment. Good luck farming ! I don't have the jetpack yet :D
---
Then you wouldn't have to shoot so loong?
---
Wouldn't it be nice to play together
---
On the kinda server we belooong?
---
You know you're gonna get disconnected
---
World is full so let's waaaait togetherrrrr
---
It‚Äôs in the picture
---
I thought the same thing at first too, that they were collectable. Most of the benefits on them arent even useful to playing though. Unless you're certain you're going to be in a situation that it will help. 
---
Server hop and yoink them from found frames in the world
---
You just need a keycard and usually the weekly code will be on Nukacrypt within several hours of the reset. I've watched some of [their](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCor-sh_Kz80yHJe5T7pc6Tw/videos) livestreams as they're trying to crack the code once the reset occurs. It takes hundreds if not thousands of cards to do sometimes. 
---
Your pride
---
I had some level 200+ guy following me around last night. He showed up at my workshops when I was there and would just hang around. 
---
I tried to say Hi on the mic and gesture him. But he didn‚Äôt reply. Made me super paranoid.
---
He would fast travel to where I was and just go around killing mobs with an underpowered Rifle.
---
I think he was trying to be my guardian angel. But he was so creepy about it. Just squatting next to me and shit.
---
This happened to me in beta! The small camp w the hanging rad stags in Flatwoods. I was trying to loot the dead ghoul I shot but instead climbed in the sleeping bag with it. I was like oh god no ugh! And as fast as I could lay down and get back up I had swamp itch. Fuuuuuuh
---
Zelda is the guy in the green hat, dont @ me
---
Agreed.  We need more wasteland/faction themed stuff.  Despite being the lowest tier armor, I always liked the Raider power armor because it's so crusty and piecemeal.  It looks like something that would be authentically made by survivors out of cobbled together bits and a damaged suit found in some vertibird wreckage.  I don't really like the bulky, spiky look of the regular raider and trapper armors, but the power armor looks excellent.
---
Still nothing about player-side, quality-of-life mods. I don't want to risk my account getting suspended, but there's a lot of good mods out there that look to make the game much more user-friendly. Like *known recipes*, as an example.
---
One droped shotgun ammo for me. It was odd, just kinda shot out of it.
---
Literally Unplayable!
---
Love this idea
---
Yah man, language is fluid, it lives and breaths and changes with the times.  More then just facts and letters on a page It‚Äôs an expression of will, intent, motives and ideas.  
---
If someone says empty the clip or give ‚Äòem the whole 8 yards we know you don‚Äôt have to be packing a Garand or piloting a Wildcat to understand to keep our finger on the trigger until we can‚Äôt fire anymore.
---
^ this has happened to me as well. Recently having camp items "ghosting". Example~ Rocket launcher Turret. I will have a RLT on my base camp, Next time I log in, RLT is not there, but the wire is there, and my camp build percentage is the same...
---
Well they are working on pvp specific servers. It aughta cut down on these incidents.
---
Even with pvp and weapon balancing I think TSE weapons will still be OP and prob impossible to fight against. 
---
There was a more recent datamine that showed a few cool things like four sets of power armor in the theme of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I'll link it if I can find it.
---
 Monongah Town. But its situational, you have to confirm there are ghouls there or it won't be worth it. If there are Liberators or Mole Miners its not worth it. 
---
You are right. However, I have seen a lot of posts where people tell lower level folks to kill the trash  and let the high levels take the queen.  If I ran to a queen fight with one of my lower level toons I would take out the trash mobs too.  Looks like people trying to do the right thing in the wrong situation.   Seems like a communication situation.  Possible fix- we need area text chat so people who don't use voice can be communicating with or too.
---
If you had read everything including the discussions you would have noticed it was my wife and kid who were just building in the woods and the team thing had something to do with it but since you just skimmed and commented I'll just leave it alone. 
---
I picked one up at lvl 55 ish. It uses normal laser ammo and does weak damage. I think It's supposed to be a new weapon, but seems broken to me.
---
What happens in the apocalypse stays in the apocalypse.
---
It also appears to be backwards 
---
No shit, Sherlock. I know how to exit PA. For PC, it‚Äôs hold E. It wasn‚Äôt working due to a bug. Thankfully that bug was fixed early on.
---
Absolutely,  has gone up at least 5x for me, mostly within about 20 seconds after loading into zones 
---
Think I‚Äôm camped in the same spot, see that patch off weeds every day, lol.  
---
When I got the cannibal perk I forgot about it and never used it until this happened
---
Theres another p9n with stairs to the top closet to watoga, on one of my alts I built a camp on top. But since you can't use a foundation it's made of lookout platforms, and I spawn on the ground nearby.
---
Yep, gonna get farmed now. 
---
Did you know ypu don't have to spend any monet at all?
---
Who'd a thunk it?
---
Also yeah i agree most items look pretty dumb or unlikeable in a post apocalyptic world.
---
Cos every scrub and his mum have paid money or caps for tse and its become a farce. If your salty about getting one hit by a player with a melee weapon, then just realise that player probably spent a long time to get to the point where they could do that, getting perks etc. Whereas anyone can pick up a tse and be op from the get go. Even if you did get a tse from a legit drop, you just gta live with the fact that the damage has been done and everyone you encounter thinks you are either a duper or scrub who has to buy weapons to feel special lol
---
They also need to add them to the legendary loot table.
---
(Unless its already on there and I'm just super unlucky.)
---
We just got some depleted Uranium glass color in at my glass studio, I gotta say it looks wonderful in the nuka cola bottle shape, let me see if I can't get a picture when the studio reopens on monday 
---
Probably a duper...
---
Somebody did it today while I was on.  Enemies were scarce, but it was yellowcake heaven!
---
You were the Chosen One! You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them. You were supposed to bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.
---
I keep afull set of assassins leather gear with padding to reduce explosive for this reason.
---
Idk about yall but i am digging that rawhide johnny depp look.
---
You are killing it with the puns 
---
LMAO.  Made me laugh thank you!  I know exactly what you mean.
---
Unfortunately no. And they really need to buff the damage on it because its practically useless unless you have a damage boosting legendary effect. 
---
Why? 
---
Look on the floor above or the roof lol
---
Golf outfits from white springs or the straight jackets from fort defiance= Caps
---
Personally i would load my stash with more unique items if junk took up less weight.
---
But i personally hit thresholds with junk and stop collecting them.
---
I will say my stability, stash wise, has improved with these patches. Loads seem longer though
---
Morgantown high school! One run through gives me 150-200 plastic. Don't forget bowling pins and golf balls.
---
Plus it's just low level scorched I can kill with a switchblade and they drop a decent amount of shotgun shells! 
---
yep, checked also it's 12 only not +12.
---
I for one use loads of mutations and find this pretty neat. Go ahead, take me down! I'd like to see you tryyyy
---
Ye thats a thing now apparently
---
I actually purchased from many different players and that's the only thing i had a massive amount of. Plus the email didn't say i was banned for the items, but for duping. If they cant tell the difference perhaps they should not ban people till they can, or at least ban every single person in the game that has a duped item to make it fair. I purchased those treasure maps the same way every one else had purchased items.
---
I haven't seen it as an item anywhere. I'd definitely use that instead of the Firebreather's mask though.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt see any malicious intent from them purposely blocking spawns. I‚Äôm sure there are a few, but yeah I think it‚Äôs just people who don‚Äôt know. Which is fine, it‚Äôs a great spot no denying that.
---
Xbox, sorry. Plus I got one last night in a great deal!
---
Check your perk cards. You probably have something equipped affecting the weight
---
The bunkers in the free states region all have generators in them
---
Isn‚Äôt that the goal? It sucks only having one option for farming in such a big world. Hopefully they add more epic boss battles like the Scorched Queen we can active with nukes as well.
---
Serums from Enclave
---
+ Starched Genes
---
+ class freak (optional)
---
Had this happen on my login, received notice my camp couldn't be placed, ran my floating head over to center of where my camp should've been, bam stuck inside someone's locked house
---
LMAO thanks for this!
---
Oh....well that sucks :/
---
I got one! A guy traded me one in exchange for Ultracite 5mm rounds. He also gave me the prime gatling receiver plans, lol
---
I just want the male mohawk 
---
You haven't told me anything. If they nerf melee bring it on more power to them. I am all for balancing play styles.
---
I play a no sneak, no vats, no power armor railway rifle sniper. The current meta of the game means nothing to me. But this is how online games work, a meta is discovered everyone uses it, it gets nerfed and the cycle continues or the game dies.
---
The bobble head stacking exploit has nothing to do with balancing legendary modifers. It needs to be fixed but that doesn't mean modifiers shouldn't be balanced. 
---
Probably shouldn't discuss exploit theory.
---
Definitely feels bad when you‚Äôve been hunting that bulgy eyed, grass hiding, window peeping creep for a whole session, only to get the kill and get some fairy dust and a Mothman wing!  
---
Holly shit :O this is the longest patch note I've ever read. Bethesda this game is already garbage...delete it or make it F2P! U failed as a game developer studio
---
Sheer.  Dumb.  Luck.
---
Though I'd love to know if the camp owner was able to take your shoes.
---
Tradition, y'know.
---
Going to say what I said to the last post like this.  Please put the info in the post instead of this clickbaiting teaser.  I don't want to watch some YouTuber asking me to like and suscribe for 5 minutes before he gets to the point. Thanks.
---
"We are going to take a hard stance over the scourge that we allowed. Please let us act like the good guys while we try to kill off the other bad guys." 
---
I want waves of glowing deathclaws piercing fear into our hearts! I'm bored of farming bloated dudes... gimme duh action! 
---
It‚Äôs a survival game, but because you are for a nerf of the TS/TSE you have taken one defense/option you had, even with pvp servers going to be fun people that will keep finding you even on server hops and keep wrecking your stuff you block them they get friends to look for you and join the server. All that could had been avoided if ts/TSE was not nerfed and you fought back and won using the legit mechanics to do so. 
---
Lol this happened to me at whitespring golf course. Ended up shooting into a wall that loaded literally into me and becane wanted. Then the ass whose base it was, of course the little turd had tse, tried collecting the 10 caps.........i went up to 50 caps pretty fuckin quick üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nuka-Cryolator where?
---
And damage isn't damage. Reducing two possible modifers on all ballistic weapons is no wherenear the same change as say a blanket reduction to all melee damage. Of course you are well aware of that and are just being intentionally obtuse.
---
I actually purchased from many different players and that's the only thing i had a massive amount of. Plus the email didn't say i was banned for the items, but for duping. If they cant tell the difference perhaps they should not ban people till they can, or at least ban every single person in the game that has a duped item to make it fair. I purchased those treasure maps the same way every one else had purchased items. Plus they said themself they would work with people. and re establish accounts for first time offenders. Given i didn't dupe anything.... Then they need to establish whats an allowed number of items or cap how many we can have if its going to be an issue. Why would i only dupe one type of treasure map and NOTHING else? I have no issue talking to them and getting this worked out and i'm sorry but compared to whats going on in the game right now... me having treasure maps... isnt an issue. Would be nice just to get a response. All im asking for is for them to do what they said they would do and lets talk about a solution. They want to delete the treasure maps then fine... However thats not the reason the email said i was banned. It said i had been duping... which worries me because apparently they cant tell who is actually duping or not.
---
Tse shotguns are inn the 2k up to 3k for pumps. 
---
Tse gatling is actually popular as its one of two good heavy guns. I see them go higher up to 4k.
---
An anti armor explosive weight reduction gatling will go for 10k and beyond sometimes. 
---
I have the same problem, mine is with most of the challenges, said for me to get 500 wood or something and said i collected 299 when into the start of the game i collected 200 and used it and collected tonnes more, seems like they dont exactly know how to measure how much people collect
---
nope, that's mostly everyone. I used to never CTD, but I have maybe 10X since January 10th patch. 
---
yeah, it‚Äôs kind  of lame how there‚Äôs only a few places where nuking it is actually worth it. people are starting to nuke more places so i hope we find something new 
---
The Crash to Desktop with no errors or dialog is always fun.
---
Definitely moreso since the patch.
---
Yeah that one is not registering for me to and I‚Äôve put over 200 hours of gameplay in
---
Yup, get a ton of it from uranium fever.
---
There‚Äôs a sub Reddit for that I think it /fallout76mostwanted
---
Yeah I'm trying here and there since I find Whitesprings so boring personally. 
---
You may have glitched slightly outside buildsvle area when you placed it originally and now the game engine has a conflict everytime you load in and it tries to place it. Maybe move camp 5ft south?
---
I didn't have tens of millions of anything so.... 
---
SERUMS FROM ENCLAVE!?! WHAT THE WHAT!?
---
Ooh that‚Äôs been happening to me since the Beta üòÇ
---
Only with me it‚Äôs been dropping through the floor completely and disappearing!
---
I wonder why they implemented it if they cant even count it right, hopefully it will be brought up and fixed 
---
And that is how countless people have lost calibrates shocks and jet pack mods to bullet making. At least they're going to fix this in the next patch. Hopefully. 
---
It's a ammo crafted thing - as pointed out in other posts.  IMO They need to add a new 50cal ammo for sniper rifle.
---
I would argue that mutations is the best thing that came out of this release *(there are plenty, but if there was a battle for the top spot)*.  
---
From previous games, I've always loved the movement in Destiny 2. While they're not the exact same thing - Marsupial and Bird Bones combined by them selves in this game brought the happiness and satisfaction of such movement into this game as well. A very big *win win* for my own sake.
---
Keep 200 sell rest to vendors, same for ultracite 
---
So only people who can find someone to help should get to dupe and rule the market?  Right, that makes sense.
---
this shit always hapened me in that building on the ghoulf course..fighting 10 of them, sure, let me sleep a little
---
Obviously some can't grasp this concept
---
*Dispray
---
Atom here, From Atoms Atom Shop, you‚Äôre wish has been received and is currently being processed. Keep an eye open in the Atom Shop near you. 
---
Yea thats what i was thinking but hell a confirmation email or something would be nice.
---
One star legendaries sell for roughly the same as normal items in my experience. Two star and more seem to have a fair bit increased value when selling though so they can be worth it I find. But the base item needs to be at least somewhat valuable. A pool cue or rolling pin is going to be worth nothing, caps wise, regardless of number of stars.  
---
Also it seems some pre modded weapons sell for a huge amount of caps, like 70+ for a modded assault rifle I found the other day. Still not as good a cost/weight as the outfits but much better than random other stuff. Gear repair level matters too for price.  
---
I understand that but I also feel like the guy who figured it out deserves some credit, that‚Äôs why I linked to his video instead of just posting like it was my personal discovery. I assume YouTube is this guy‚Äôs job and he‚Äôs been putting in a lot of effort so I‚Äôm not about to steal credit.
---
The location is in his title so you don‚Äôt even have to watch the video if you really don‚Äôt want to. 
---
Get off my lawn! :D
---
Meh, in pa the sqb already tickles.
---
With fireproof 3 she'll make you giggle as her attacks do explosive damage.
---
Imo melee is probably going to be looked at eventually. Since str is the only special that directly effects damage something as simple as diminishing returns would bring things in line.
---
Up to 30 str sees nice bonuses, up to 70 and it slows down. 
---
But i don't see bethesda nerfing anything just because of sqb. Its obvious they don't do that simply because of the tse nerf and how it's being done.
---
I believed the atomic shop hairstyles are the same two unlocked in F04 by the La Coiffe magazines.  Hopefully future updates will see a bit more creativity.
---
Welk that's not player owned. 
---
This is all true and I did not miss it. I was just talking about how these upcoming nerfs affect the new content. I was not talking about what nerfs we need.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt say 100s or thousands. I said tens and hundreds of thousands 
---
Reading for the win,
---
Important to note that while certainly everything from this datamine has either been or (likely) will be released, it also looks like there's at least a few things that came out and weren't included here. Biggest things that I immediately see missing here are the Santa outfits and the exploding Red Rocket CAMP item.
---
[wrong patch on officers](https://imgur.com/gallery/0L0Et7p) 
---
They are wearing a different flag from the in game period of time 
---
Conversely, I've had it happen more. This game is all about individual experience. Some people couldn't play it, especially at release. Some people have had a blast. As time has gone on, this game has just gotten more and more soul less for me. It is an MMORPG without people. You are Wall-E scrapping the junk heaps trying to find a connection to something. 
---
I probably meant to respond to op. Mobile, sorry.
---
Has anyone figured out how to fix this? 
---
&gt;tried to sever hope
---
Awesome typo :D
---
That sucks and sounds super frustrating. The fact that they abused the bounty system is doubly annoying.
---
I wasn't suggesting that world enemies were what did it, just that pacifist - even if implemented in that way - wouldn't protect you from base damage.
---
Not being able to damage bases would also open up now opportunities for trolling. I read a story about the "raiders" who were luring people into death trap bases. I've also seen people get locked inside somewhere on accident. Or on purpose. Having server hopping being the only way to get out of those situations would just push the base issue to a different set of people without solving it. 
---
Bethesda made a big point of base repairs being cheap. It was an intentional design decision to let these things be in the game. For all the bugs, this is one part of the game they put a lot of thought into and a core part of the online aspect. Personally I think removing the limited PvP from the game would detract from it considerably and be a big change to its fundamental nature. 
---
But I also haven't had my base wiped out by trolls. Just Super Mutants. 
---
maybe no perma death but robots could be a good item sink for high level players. also if i could have a liberator legs with an assultron head on it that would be super adorable and deadly. 
---
Well there is a ridiculous number of enemies nearby and people are probably using TSE weapons which also hurt the framerate.
---
I like alts. I like trying a completely different build. I have a pure melee, a shotgun build, a rifle single shot build and I'm always interested in trying out other stuff that seems interesting.  
---
As others have said, finding a cool level 15 legendary as a level 120 - you probably don't even pick it up. Sticking in your shared stash for the character you've been thinking about trying would be great. I've been seriously considering buying another copy of FO76 just so I can trade this stuff around. If I see a PC copy for $15 or less I'm jumping on it.
---
We WeRe JuSt bUiLdInG
---
Well They were just camp raiding. 
---
I see no problem
---
But its remembering what armour including legebdary attributes are on the sets
---
I spam craft my ammo baby, that's what I work for! That sweet sweet sound of super duper popping off. Can't punish me for that ;_; 
---
This is what they say:  "(UPDATE): We‚Äôve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately ‚Äì it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu. This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
You may recall late last year we mentioned we‚Äôre working on a new way of playing the game that removed PvP restrictions. While we‚Äôre still doing some tweaking and adding, we thought we‚Äôd give you a little more info to go on. Think it of it like playing the game you‚Äôre playing right now, but with no PvP rules. We want to introduce significantly more tension, drama, and consequences with every encounter with another human player. We‚Äôll go further into this new mode next week."
---
The guys were my friends on Facebook emphasis on were
---
Because it wasn't already declared in the earlier Fallout games. Seriously.
---
I've had this same issue. I'd love a "foundation" square for crops that is nice and level for the same reason another brought up. My shizzle disappears into the ground! In addition, if the ground has any kind of slope, putting a fence around it is nigh-near impossible.  :(
---
I would pay atoms for pretty planter boxes (the cosmetic upgrade to a basic planting foundation).
---
It‚Äôs so sad, I tried to build there last night, but I know the constant SB attacks is gonna kill it :(
---
It really wouldn‚Äôt be soooo bad if there was some kinda cool-down in the sonic screech, but just being constantly lit up and draining stimpacks is too much 
---
Shame to, what an amazing view! 
---
You on Xbox? What's the name of that uniform?
---
Eventually, you can be killed. I almost was, they were killing everyone and looking through their bags.
---
I‚Äôd love that too. But only Bethesda can make those dreams come true.
---
Gross.
---
Yeah, that always sucks when that happens. 
---
You know, if you're on xbox, we could play together.
---
So you're saying the dude who spent all that time researching doesn't deserve for you to spend a couple minutes on his channel. Also, since I have watched the video, I (unlike you) am aware that it didn't start with the dude asking you to like and subscribe (he asks briefly at the end). Even if it did, so what? You can skip such things if you want. 
---
Furthermore, why would he spend his time typing an in-depth explanation when the same people who get impatient about the possibility that someone who creates good content might ask them to like and subscribe will inevitably demand a map location (which is in the video) in the comments anyway.
---
Lastly, learn the definition of "clickbait." You're embarrassing yourself.
---
Someone stopped reading...
---
High end. Can't remember specs but im running a titan x
---
i don't have one :/ 
---
Ty for letting me know 
---
Psn mjesticbattlecat add me, might need components but ill do the mods for free üëç
---
Regardless they are worth a nice penny to clearing vendors. The mags seem more useful but I can actually hoard those since they weight next to nothing
---
Yes, you have to equip it, drop all your fusion cells and take them back and it will work
---
That's what I wanted too, sadly it doesn't protect you from death. 
---
My god a deathclaw nuke zone would be spectacular.
---
The come up in the WhiteSprings, Watoga and Phenoix  vender bots stores pretty often. People sell them when they need extra caps. I've kept my eye out and picked back up the sword and gun, I originally sold mine thinking I could just make new ones. 
---
Can you explain, please?
---
Im not gonna lie, i have a bloodied explosive shotgun. im sort of responsible for the quick kills. its gonna be interesting in a few weeks if there is an influx of new players whether the tse craze will need queen nerfs. 
---
Welcome... maaaaaa'aam
---
Wooby is there, I honestly believe it. I think I may be the originator of the freewooby movement. It must happen #FreeWooby
---
I get this error after I press any key and cannot get to the game start menu.  I have a 6700k and a 1080 so we are not that different.
---
But that was fibe before latest update
---
Yep! And the animation is soo slooow
---
Indestructible camps isnt even pve.. and this is fallout, a harsh wasteland where you are rarely safe from the environment. 
---
That would be awesome. 
---
They were right on all counts. Actions, not words.
---
Not disagreeing there.
---
Ah awesome! I‚Äôve only got one friend I was playing with, and he‚Äôs abandoned the game for now as he‚Äôs already past level 100 and got nothing left to do! 
---
I‚Äôll PM you my GT üëç
---
mutations and their downsides? I think it's fair
---
Lol well then im afraid you are stuck screaming impotently at the tv screen/monitor. Get a mic tho, seriously, i played this gane for the first two weeks like silent bob. Then i met a south african called crack tooth and i havent turned it off since. Waaaay more fun way to play the game.
---
Awww cuddle buddies 
---
Great write-up.  Lots of positive suggestions.
---
Farm? Like stay in radiated areas and keep healing yourself?
---
Yes it's make your own endgame right now. My endgame, become a master crafter: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Another thing, there should be a limit to how many events can be simultaneously active on a server.
---
I've been on a server with something like 8 active events at once. That essentially guarantees you'll be doing it by yourself if you try.
---
Also events should need to have an active participant to stay up, it's annoying checking to see if there is anyone doing events to join and every event is barren.
---
Also I agree, there needs to be an announcement system. Radio is a good idea. 
---
 Stop that nonsense. Make em' walk. 
---
 As well Harper's Ferry is a complicated toy and people running around mindlessly, just make it difficult for the regulars.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea! The liberators were so hype, but ended up being basically radroaches with lasers, so it would be cool to see then live up to how cool they looked. The assaultron head is awesome to so that‚Äôs a great to do that.
---
We were promised free DLC but instead they‚Äôre just fixing their game. FML never preordering again 
---
Hate how the SB wing flaps will drop you out of VATS if you are targeting the head and they pass in front of it.
---
What a tangled web they‚Äôve woven.
---
I feel like the Atom Shop shows what Bethesda thinks of this game...
---
A game for casual kids, no roleplaying, and shallowness
---
Ha! I can‚Äôt believe you got both! I thought it was some kinda Sophie‚Äôs choice by the level designers to make you pick which was more important to you 
---
I chose the acid, too bad the cave isn‚Äôt just a little bit larger and you could just entirely move in there.  Right now I imagine it must really suck for my character, sleeping on his bunk bed right next to an acid seep! ;)
---
your opinion is just as irrelevant.  Bethesda doesn't want a player exodus over this though.
---
üëå raiding signifies that there was something to be gained but there was not so pointless to pick on newbees but whatever. 
---
I could fight back, I could get out my full set of assassins gear, or my reactive armor for melee. Sure. But if I'm farming resources, it's because I just got done spending everything and need to rebuild. If I'm doing that, by definition I'm not ready.
---
I'll be trying this now, let the "raiders" kill themselves
---
Yeah i am starting to do that i try not to be expensive because idk the prices about certain weapons.  Like for example i sell a 3*  junkies gatling gun for 300 caps and two legendary 1*  fatmans for 100 caps, is this cheap or not? 
---
Np.
---
Obviously those are ballparks and prices flucuate due to alot of factors.
---
But if you toss up a post looking for a tse pump and offering 7k you'll get offers in seconds 
---
And shooting it at normal person gives them a temporary random mutation, but only one.
---
A whole lotta fun could come outta this. 
---
Id probably be real shitty if I went from running mach-5 to being normal speed, or over cucumbered.
---
Then id have to laugh it it. "Ope, ya got me!"
---
Yup. It's a multi-player game which has inherent stability issues the dupers take from a fairly minor problem to a game-destroying frustration for the vast majority of players.   
---
If you use dupe exploits in this game, you deserve a game wide permaban. None of this "but my alts and other accounts weren't duping". An alt account, in the real fucking world, is known as "ban evasion". 
---
The law protects consumers from stupid contract stipulations.
---
Like a thumbs up? üëç
---
You don‚Äôt really need that many unless you use core weapons or you are farming for a clan. 5-10 will get you by fine. Just keep an eye on the level. And jump servers. Ultracite cores last a bit longer too. There‚Äôs also a perk card but I can‚Äôt remember the name rn. 
---
*Xbox. Never even seen a report button on ps4 üòÇ
---
I'm on now, sent you a friend request
---
And what about ultracite PA plans, how much are those worth? 
---
Unless we all dressed up as deathclaws and roleplay... I'd sign up. 
---
Add calibrated shocks to it for 200 carry weight. It's fantastic that way.
---
You can buy them from genelab.
---
Rest you can google. :)
---
 I'm replacing my level 40 X0-1 with level 50 and I'm a bit apprehensive that it will start taking damage, 'cause its taken none so far. 
---
95% of my weight issue comes down to wood and ammo for guns I don't use. 
---
Locations have a level range
---
For example, one area could have a range of 30-45 for enemies. The levels they have are determined by who enters that cell first
---
If a level 30 and under enters, the enemies and loot will be 30. If a level 50 enters, enemies and loot will be 45. The only way for it to reset is for everyone to leave the cell until the enemies respawn
---
I crash twice as much on ps4 since the update. It's annoying as hell.  If I figure something out I'll let you know. 
---
so much potential in the game and so much wasted shit game unbalanced unoriginal cash grab customer fuck
---
1.  Thank you for your insight. 
---
So youd like to see it pay to win?  
---
Theres weapon skins in there which is fine but giving people an advantage just makes it p2w which 99% of people do not want
---
I'm actually looking forward to the plaid hunting cap, the road goggles, the knit beanie (toque?), the modern art rugs and paintings (I have a degree in fine art and love seeing that stuff), and maybe the Garrahan engraved revolver if the .44 wasn't the lamest pistol aside from the pipe and laser pistols.
---
The outfits are largely pretty lame.  I personally wouldn't buy any of them.  That raindrop/leaf pattern power armor skin is kinda ok.  The tattoos and face paint are just plain gross.  The punk hairstyles are kinda ok, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy a mohawk for 500 atoms.  The best power armor color was easily the black one that was on sale for a couple days.
---
Its based off of players entering the area at higher levels than you are 
---
Mines a lvl 50 X01 PA and i never took damage 
---
THAT is what last laugh should do. 
---
The game is not working as intended, you obviously don't know the definition of passive. Go read a book.
---
Yay I've been searching for a few days now! Im sure I got what you need to craft it.
---
But im not home yet, I'll be online in about 1-2 hours
---
Whats wrong with casual gamers?
---
Yeah they are supposed to have [the 13 stars flag](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/File:USA_Flag_Pre-War.png). If you look on the fallout wiki the flag has been around since probably the late 1960's early 1970's as that was the [formation of the 13 Commonwealths in 1969](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/United_States#The_American_Commonwealths).  
---
tbh that my main pa it weighs 2.5 pounds for me i have 2 others as battle ready ones and prototype x01 and an ultracite
---
Fort Defiance has ghouls.  Maybe try there?
---
I wonder if it's in the dev room. I don't get why we couldn't have it anyways since we find it on corpses
---
Are you kidnapping players looking for Grahm? Release them this instant!
---
You've got some good points there, and it's fair to say I'm a bit quick to jump to being grouchy.  Guy does deserve credit for putting in the work.
---
only other combos that can do sustained are junkies and bloodied. No one uses junkies because it's nearly impossible to get enough addictions (possibly bugged), and no one knows, and no one wants the withdrawal effects which temper the net effect. Bloodied may well get 'adjusted'. 
---
So don't worry, other nerfs will come. 
---
And without exploits, you aren't going much over 36k.  With any primary legendary capped at about 25% sustained, the cap is closer to 10k.
---
Nuka Cola stashbox is like the only thing I dig
---
It‚Äôs not just legendaries. It‚Äôs all items. Lost 400 44. Rounds I was giving to a buddy. Really though they give you a trade option so why even gamble. Just my opinion.
---
You've never crafted large builds, or black powder. 
---
F4 used to allow the display of magazines and book and stuff, I think it‚Äôs a good idea.
---
Not only that, but allowing to properly decorate your camp means less weight to carry or stash capacity being take up.
---
Np add me and join my world when your on and ill hook u up 
---
Infinitely better than the original lyrics
---
It works. Goad them into attacking you. Talk trash about how only a weak player uses TSE. 
---
I love it.
---
Wear fireproof perk though. it helps ya live.
---
I also like to be irradiated to half health.
---
Really inspires them to get rekt.
---
Good idea, yeah has a small amount of ghouls / scorched can turn in my technical data while I'm there too.
---
Right. Like i didn't say myself that maybe splitting TS and E would be the best solution.
---
But you are just ignorant to it the, if you really believe nothing will happen to even your playstyle.
---
Just you wait.
---
Ammo is a huge sinc, but if you're building a metal base, you need probably a thousand steel or more...
---
So the game scales based on who got their first. If a high level is there before you then enemies will be higher level.
---
In some cases its a blessing, others its a curse.
---
Fortunetly some areas only scale so high. The main forest only goes up to level 6 but when you go east to the golf course it can go ring up to 68.
---
North in the toxic valley i found it capped in the 20s, same with South in the ash heap.
---
The blessing side is xp. If you tag the enemies then run away and later a high level kills them you'll get big boosts of xp
---
That second paragraph hits hard for me.   Being able to choose the star level of a maxed out card would be huge.  A couple of times I‚Äôve found myself with 1 point too little to equip a 3 star card which is absolutely aggravating considering you literally had the level 2 version already and it only makes sense to have a little organization and combine cards.  
---
Just tried this out 30 mins ago, wasn‚Äôt bad but I still feel whitesprings spawns more legendaries. It is certainly a nice change of scenery though. We encompassed Seneca rocks too and got some 3* wolves to spawn on the cliffs
---
I was at white springs before and nearly every non legendary ghoul  i killed dropped a legendary item . Idk if it was a bug or not 
---
Ive built a giant cage that kills anything that leaves. Come check it out........
---
No, your fine. 76  still retains the RPG element of having to level up. Think of it like Pokemon, u get a gym boss thats too much and then u have to level up pikachu for 10 levels etc. So the idea is if u come across an area/set of enemies that are not defeatable - you then are meant to go off about your way and uncover new areas and missions. BTW at your level, the north and central are all good but never be afraid to go anywhere (in the exploring sense). Also, level is important but I promise fully repaired/high condition armour makes u last a lot longer. 
---
Take a risk and try with another player, it really opens up the game. 
---
Only seen legendary ones
---
Put everything in your stash and it should fix it as I stated above.
---
Same, i wouldnt be dead set against spending money on it if i could actually get a lot of atoms for a decent price, but when ¬£5 will buy me 1 thing its a no deal from me
---
And to be honest, I dont enjoy killing players. Not at all. My beta build is super op and at any time, especially with a buddy, could have murdered most servers. I just never did. 
---
Still have 5000 Atoms from the game, only bought one pose for photomode.
---
Skins are just way too childish and ridiculuos. Why would I ever pay real money for atoms if I don't even have anything to spend earned in-game atoms on?
---
With tses, bobbleheads alone can't do it
---
That‚Äôs a bug I wouldn‚Äôt mind!  Nuke zone or nah?
---
My on-character inventory isn't too hard to manage. I only have an effective 1 strength, so 160 capacity. I carry a sniper rifle and a tesla rifle, and I carry 10 food, 10 water, 10 stims, and a small collection of Chems. And my PA, and a couple cores, of course.
---
For scavenging, I use packrat. Everything else is in my stash or built on demand. My base carry weight is 99/160 give or take. If I go over and need to fast travel, I'll hop into my trusty T-60 and make a trip to clear inventory.
---
For nuke silos and SBQ, I'll load up on more Chems and ammo. Maybe swap my sniper out for my handmade. 
---
When the armor carry weight glitch was still there, I used it because in my second play through of FO4, I finally caved to just modify my carry weight to 10k or so and it was so much fun. I didn't have to worry about being overencumbered. I just went back to base once in awhile when I wanted to and picked up everything to use as building materials.
---
Honestly, *not* being able to carry everything I want in 76 has made the game more engaging. I would like to have six different guns I switch between and carry a dozen of each chem, and all the food I could possibly need, and take all of the junk, but now I find I pick up what I need at the moment. My scavenging runs are targeted. Finding food and water matters because I'll eat it right away rather than just relying on the piles of gourd soup and melon juice in my inventory.
---
I don't think a rifle should weigh 20 pounds and it bugs me the heavies can use bandolier and get their base weapon weights down by 90%, but adjusting my play stole to carry only what I need has resulted in less inventory management than I was doing before. I stop by base, scrap my junk, deposit what I need into my stash, drop the excess, refill my base stocks of food/ammo/chems, and am back out playing the game in like five minutes instead of the 20 I'd previously spend trying to organise to keep everything.
---
I do want more stash space/more stashes though. Maybe a reason for those signs that say "ammo" and "armor" etc. 
---
&gt;expensive
---
Sorry but this game was built for good margins, all the atom store content was either developed some time last year or during FO4's development and is obviously just on a drip feed while most (if not all) of the studio's manpower is busy getting this game ready for launch.
---
I want long hair :(
---
It's not QoL you're being a munchkin. Here is your role play challenge: next session you're not allowed to change perks! Find a team mate if you need to pick locks.
---
Go to Watoga.
---
* AMS building - there are 3 fusion generators and one laying around and outside a PA by the crashed Vertibird.
---
* Emergency Services Building - top floor, left room, after the stairs next to a enamel bucket and PA on the roof. North of this building is another building with a crashed vertibird with PA next to it.
---
* Transit hub - Fusion Generator behind a level 3 lock pick.
---
And use Power User perk.
---
You cant use melee weapons like deathclaw hand on PA because they are part of the unarmed perk i think
---
It's likely they have some kind of distributive queue that spreads us out evenly over all worlds and servers.  It may be just 30 minutes to code the change, but I'd bet there'd be a lot more time spent on discussing what the changes should be and how to implement them without creating an unstable distribution.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% for this feature.  It's just that, as a programmer, I recognize this is a potentially bigger / more time consuming change than it may seem.  I honestly hope they've already considered it and just haven't figured it out yet, so have said nothing about it.  
---
Yeah but sometimes I want to drop something I don‚Äôt use for another player, but I don‚Äôt trust them to use the trade option. Since I think that trade/steal glitch is still a thing.  
---
The best way to get to the point where tour lvl is appropriate for where the story is sending you is to thoroughly go through the areas you have been sent to previously. The enemies youll encounter will be easier and youll lvl up enough to take on that next area. Its best not to rush through at low lvls cos there is a buuunch of crap youll miss. I know because i didnt do this. Im lvl 273 and there are things that my lower lvl friends have discovered that i had no idea about lol
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been kicked out by griefers for being too close a wanted resource.
---
Next you‚Äôre attacked logging off and server hop
---
You mean since the last Fallout game? Lol
---
Role players vs munchkins is as old as the internet. The meme before memes.
---
A custom paint for the excavator would be nice, I'm about to rebuild my entire set from lvl 25 parts to lvl 45 parts.  Acquiring the requisite springs has been a fun exercise in scouring the map for battered clipboards.  It'll be a nice Dr/er/rad resist upgrade making it a bit more practical in nuke zones as opposed to my t-60 set.
---
You could mod hunt the vendors for calibrated shocks to put on your t-60 legs to increase your carry weight 50lb per leg as well.  Excavator has them too but I can't remember where to find those.
---
Raiding signifies no such thing. 
---
Although there is plenty to be gained. I camp raid all the time. 
---
Looking for your foul mothed wife and kids next time!
---
No nuke zone and yeah i didnt mind at all üòÅ
---
I get downvoted whenever I disagree with a post and lay out my discussion for a response. So now I just refuse to post on stuff like that. I only post game info now. 
---
Hell yeah, makes sense to me.
---
Could add a fun new element to the game
---
I've been collecting all of the outfits I can find in the hopes that I'll be able to display a horde of mannequins in my CAMP.  :)
---
I'm just waiting for "Confessions of a Skooma Eater." I've been aroused by the maid for too many years, still can't break my skooma habits unfortunately. 
---
&gt; Your "find and rely on teammates" argument when it comes to perks would hold water IF we had a way to find teammates!
---
WTF do you think reddit is for???
---
I use mutations, perhaps 6. I think this would be a great idea! A real tactical tool. Obviously open for griefing, but what isn‚Äôt.
---
I bought the camo hunting rifle as soon as I saw it without even thinking about it. The only other things I bought so far are a pip boy skin (roadster) and the blackbird power armors. I can't be the only one to whom only this kind of stuff has any appeal. 
---
Or have it just less damage per mytation but increased with every mutation you have
---
I couldn‚Äôt find it
---
The landscape is much more difficult then whitesprings or even the bog, I found myself fighting the landscape more then anything else. 
---
Good amount of resources. 
---
If you look carefully at the publisher of this game it will say Bethesda........there is your answer
---
Something I did to combat this was to do literally everything I could to level up. I went to every location neadby, fought evedy enemy. Everyting. You need to explore, rather than doing quests all of the time. By the way, where did you find the map with level recommendations?
---
Fake
---
Haha! I actually built above my extractor. It really was a pretty cool set up! I just hated having to run 10 km from my camp to fast travel.
---
I have a Zealot‚Äôs explosive LMG‚Äîand even it is utterly pointless.  
---
Cores come from quests, power plants, and random fusion generators scattered around in buildings. If you want to produce some take over one of the workshops at the energy plant
---
Its nothing compared to real life, this is a video game. The issue is being forced into pvp/killed because damage can still be done to a player with passive mode on. All passive does currently is reduce the damage taken from other players. Since its specific for player interaction and nothing to do with PVE, it's a broken system. 
---
I like that the portable toilets I build come pre-filled with poop. 
---
Oh. So that means unarmed isnt just fists? Some melle weapons too?
---
You will get more fusion cores by simply just playing the game, keep an eye out for them in the large generator machines scattered around the game (google it so you know what to look for). You can also find cores on the power armor chassis that spawn around the map. Carry weight only goes up with the excavator set I believe and if you upgrade your carry weight card. As for the best power armor it‚Äôs usually a debate between x01, T-60, and Ultracite armor
---
For fucks sake guys! This post again? I've seen this so many times. Mods, how bout pin this post and the annoying power armor post and stop letting people repost this shit a thousand times! 
---
I first did  the forest, then the ash heap, then the toxic valley then the savage divide, then the mire and as last cranberry bog
---
Again man, I like that play style, but that's not this game. They designed perk cards to be interchangable. That is why you continue to get duplicates of the same cards after you've maxed. To mix and match. Don't know what your problem is with playing the game as it is intended to be played.
---
Yeah...can‚Äôt argue that.  
---
Bugging out got bored 
---
I keep mine locked. When I have stuff I don't need, i open them up and drop a paper bag inside. I never considered people accidentally locking themselves in. That's hilarious. 
---
Makes sense.
---
I don't think people will have trouble with the SBQ, everyone will just build melee, which is far more busted. Well, those people who don't quit
---
Or a door without broken glass panes
---
Why would I build that??
---
I've been saddened by the lack of booby-trapped bathroom stalls.
---
I try to be brave about it.
---
FWIW those were datamined too, here‚Äôs the RR sign and most of the Santa stuff. OPs link just hasn‚Äôt been updated.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a57csu/datamined_new_atom_shop_items_11_december_patch/
---
I think its stuff like power fist, death tambo, knuckles.  I think they all are in the unarmed category
---
Was*
---
That's exactly what I thought they meant!
---
I totally agree that this nerf is both one sided, silly and likely to make a lot of folks quit.
---
Good to know. Dissapointing my T-51 isnt as good as I thought. Oh wellü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Thanks!
---
From what I know about PA ultracite is the best physical protection while X01 is the best energy protection.  T-60 is in my opinion the best all around f armor because it offers really good protection from both, and is super cheap to repair only requiring aluminum, steel, and plastic.  Fusion cores are really easy to come by once you get to know PA spawns.  You can find a map online to grab a bunch if your running low.  
---
I‚Äôm holding out for the suit that allows underwater breathing, protects against airborne and water disease, and provides radiation resistance.
---
Maybe it's different in the fallout universe, but irl it is definitely backwards. 
---
I'd like to buy new music.... I get tired of hearing the same songs on loop.
---
The north and east sections of the map are best for low levels
---
Just check the vendors constantly.  You'll find them.  On a side note, I got the warehouse wall plans defending a workshop. Not sure if brick drops that way but the workshop quests almost always drop a plan. 
---
Ingerestung. Perk isnt as bad as I thought.
---
Like I always say, I wanna build a Post-Apocalyptic stronghold, not play Barbie Dream House. 
---
I like the shop music tho. 
---
ahhh, thanks. appreciate the updated stuff
---
Well most people practically live there.
---
I actually was camped there for a while, but there's very little usable room in the car itself for workbenches, and I couldn't find a way to remove the existing objects, like the sleeping bags. Kinda underwhelming, actually.
---
Is it still going? 
---
I buy and sell on the trade market regularly. Probably 100+ this week and have never encountered it.
---
Thanks! Is there a reason alot of people talk about excavator PA? I have a quest for it so....
---
Only with one or two at a time but I can see where the problem would arise. Most people seem to have camps in similar spots i.e white springs so that would be somewhat problematic.
---
Still its annoying u cant use it with power armor,  for ppl who like to fight unarmed Power armor seems useless 
---
Yep 17 mins left 
---
Middle finger emote!   Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure if we got on its the only one people would use.
---
T-51 is still better than T-45 and the raider armor in most cases as well as the excavator armor. You will eventually find even better armor. At level 30 the T-51 should be more than enough to keep you alive.
---
True. I keep ending up with 100 stored corn in my CAMP. 
---
wait, i thought that ghouls were the ones that were converted first? Did i misread that? It would make more sense to me that they were all base humans or ghouls and not ferals tho-- as they can still somewhat talk. but who's to say ghouls cant still ramble a word out or two, i recall they did once or twice and it fucking terrified me. 
---
That would be nice, and the ability to go prone.
---
Of course. That's why I put what I wanted to see in the comments. The only reason I said that' there are things to take care of' is in regards to the comment before mine. Not to put down peoples opinions on where the game should go.
---
To be dead honest, it's a split between spiteful bitterness over wasted money and time and yet hoping that I'll eventually see signs that things have gotten better and it's worth playing again.
---
Added you 
---
Oh for sure.
---
I have every mutation except herbivore because you cant have it with carnivore, and its not really that powerful, it gives loads of strabge little things that happen but without class freak level 3 its not that good
---
You're just a munchkin; if i was on your team you wouldn't let me play a lock picking thief because you'd be swapping your cards and whining about it constantly. You probably can't play with lower levels without carrying.
---
Role players vs munchkins is as old as the internet you're simply being too literal.
---
You probably brag about your damage numbers *cringe*
---
Thanks for the info. Question: What has more carry weight....the EPA or T60 with calibrated shocks? (PS-I have both sets max built with lvl 50 pieces)
---
Thats true. 
---
I saw something in a doghouse not far  from vault 76, looking inside there were bears having a cosy afternoon tea 
---
Thanks for the updated post! 
---
When you say "search the Brahmin" do you mean while it's alive?
---
&gt;I invented a device called, "Burger on the Go." It allows you to obtain six regular-sized hamburgers or twelve sliders from a horse without killing the animal.
---
You cant 
---
Lots of CTD for me too, during SBQ and just randomly while playing had about 10 since the update, had none before...
---
Don't look at the weapon damage, look at the damage it says your character does. The mutated armor doesn't show it having 10 higher defense, but when I equip it my stats show the extra 10. 
---
But the Tool Chest plan?
---
Depending on the size, just go to build and when you place the object you will see the obstruction disappear. It is not all trees and rocks that leave though. 
---
It's an online game. If I am exploiting a game mechanic and they rebalance it I have no problem with that. It adds to the life of the game by making me adapt.
---
I wouldn't be suprised if some of the perks I run are nerfed. White knight adds a crazy amount of endurance to armor. Wouldn't suprise me to see it reworked. I have honestly been considering running a lower level of it because I think it is making the game too easy for me. I already stopped running a max level blocker perk for that reason.
---
Fallout 76 is supposed to be a game that lasts years. If you can't handle balance changes to gameplay mechanics you should just quit now and save yourself the trouble.
---
Excavator armor gives a 100lb carry weight bonus with the full set that is really nice.  With calibrated shocks it can get up to 200 bonus.  The protection isn't great tho.  In between raider and t45.
---
I kinda hope you can't just hop back and forth and that PvP characters will be wholly separate. 
---
Lemme guess, You just got 1..lolz
---
Ok I‚Äôll look I think I have an old comment in the sub. 
---
Noted my man
---
Is it even possible to die in this game? Tse weapons more dangerous than beeing in the face of enemies. Im lvl 202 and last time i died i was about lvl 30 something i think. Except when i killed my self with a tse weapon. Soo i dont think its a fair argument that melee would be more exposed. But just thoughts
---
RIP I thought they were adding that?
---
Dang. I see why its called excavatorüòÇ
---
I suspect they're holding out on display stand type items for some future content release.  
---
Maybe in the future 
---
Constantly since patch, and almost never happened pre-patch.  
---
All hard CTD's 
---
it's fucking slow, no idea why. both going down and standing up 
---
Yepp. I get the same thing quite often. Sometimes it asks for it and sometimes not. My friend for example never gets asked to relog. So what causes it, no idea. :P
---
I love finding a nice or cool scene that the developers set up. I'll have to take a trip to see those bears in the doghouse. :)
---
On this sub you're alone
---
Some things you can, some you can't. But placing a floor or wall, concrete block, ect.. Sometimes when you come back to your camp you'll have a tree or something respawn, just replace the floor again. 
---
Def not alone. At the absolute least they should all be bundled together if being resold at all.. I get that they wouldn't have these items normally lore-wise but I personally believe they should of either already been in or slowly patched in through quests and vendors. 
---
I absolutely hate that they're repackaging and reselling fo4 items. I believe the Atomic Shop should be a place where Bethesda could have some fun and get creative.. not this. 
---
The easiest way to get power cores at mid level is to do one of the Powering Up events, with Poseidon Plant being the easiest. After restoring power to the plant, take the plant's workshop and farm cores out of the processor. They produce 8/hour so check back often. And remember to put a lock on the processor if you don't want others to come by and take them from you! Eventually, you'll learn the fusion generator plans so you can bypass powering up the plant first.
---
X-01 is the best power armor, but at level 30, it's likely way too soon for you to even think about getting the plans. You probably wouldn't even be able to wear it due to level restrictions anyway. I'd think about getting the excavator plans from the Garrahan Mine hq quest. It's a fairly sturdy armor and gives a bonus 100 to carry weight. I'm level 49 and currently rocking it.
---
Power armor is supposed to give a bonus 4 strength. If you're not seeing an increase in carry weight when you step in one, send a ticket to Bethesda.
---
I believe you can't use unarmed weapons in power armor, and Death Tambo is an unarmed weapon. 
---
Most of this information is readily available on the internet, and in this forum. I honestly don't understand people who don't run a google search BEFORE they post. More detailed analysis of exact statistics and analysis are available in moments than will come to you from this post.   
---
1 and 2 are literally a google search away, we shouldn't have to do your homework for you. Fusion cores are everywhere, there are set spawn points for power armor, generators, etc, which may have cores. There are literally fucking maps.  Which power armor is best depends on your metric. T-51 has the highest armor, t-60 is the cheapest to repair, and x-01 is the best radiation resist. For specific stats, again, MULTIPLE people have done detailed analysis.  Personally I run t-60 legs, as they take the most damage in my experience, t-51 torso, x01 helmet and arms.   
---
3 is a couple of things. First, power armor does provide bonus str bellow 11, it doesn't after. After that?  The motion assist servos torso mod adds +2.  If carry weight is your concern, excavator armor as a full suit adds 100 pounds on it's own, Calibrated leg mods add 50 pounds each.    
---
4 is actually fascinating,  and is carry over from 4.  Death tambo, and specific other weapons, like the power first, aren't melee weapons. They're unarmed. They aren't affected by the melee skill, and they cannot be used in power armor. You can check for this by favoriting them and then looking at the favorite wheel...it's it's a fist, it's an unarmed weapon, and cannot be used in power armor. As I remember this, the power first worked fine in NV and 3 with power armor, but in those games power armor was just a clothing item and not an entire system. 
---
Hey donta1979 thanks for engaging in a civil discussion and not downvoting me for disagreeing with my opinion.
---
Guess i should add i dont give a fuck about pvp. Tse weapons may have different impact there
---
85 down to 55 at 3 stars
---
To OP- lots of things ‚Äúreset‚Äù when you log off. Crits are one. They don‚Äôt ‚Äúdegrade‚Äù, it‚Äôll stay the same as long as you are online, but if you log off, it‚Äôs back at 0
---
Alright, I well pay attention to that. 
---
Also, with class freak, your mutations have almost no downside. Jump in a team with herd mentality and strange in numbers and you become super powered.  
---
You can look up methods. Most involve irradiating yourself in Blackwater Mine. I'd wait til you have Starched Genes of you haven't already got it.
---
Wow real gangster your probably a pimply kid who just wants someone to listen to you since your parents lock you away in the basement I'm not impressed since I know what I'm about and raid by definition means quickly and illicitly take something from a place. 
---
Yeah it's a really nice set to have.  It also gives a mining bonus when mining resource nodes, do you can get a good amount of scrap from them.
---
It had been alright, but then this morning lag was atrocious and d/ced 4 times. Froze twice. 
---
Thanks.
---
Having the same issues and error codes since this last patch, went from never CTD'ing to a few times an hour, happens most frequently when:  
---
-Entering perk menu. 
---
-Firing a scatter gun. (Tesla, Harpoon w/ flechette's, shotgun).  
---
-mob triggers a special effect.  
---
r/fo76bounties
---
Imo it's good nuking the mire around those parts if you got enough hardened mass and fluids, you can find ~20-30 of each flux there. 
---
Afaik people use that location purely to farm flux.
---
Just unlucky then I guess lol. 
---
As for the not giving strength bonus, it only gives up to 11, if you have higher base than that then it doesn't effect your stats at all.
---
&gt;Keep seeing posts about it. If you have all the materials to craft or repair an item and it is greyed out, put everything in your stash and try it again. There is a somewhat common bug that doesn't let you use inventory from stash and what you are carrying for some reason.
---
Thanks. It wasn't working for me, but then I realized I had toys in my inventory and that fixed it right up.
---
I think the Cat just spawns dead :'(
---
I have my Brotherhood of Steel CAMP set up litteraly near 'Overseers Camp' the Cat is always dead...
---
My theory: Those 'Scorched Corpses' were the people who wrote the note about the Brotherhood of Steel's downfall. Afterwards I assume they were hit by a Scorchbeast attack and somehow the Cat was immune but sadly it's Scorched owners killed it since it's not Scorched :\
---
I've launched so many nukes just to get disconnected when charging into the nuke zone. After a while I just quit playing. There isn't much end game content anyway and a good chunk of the time I can't enjoy the content they do have because I'll just get kicked out of the world anyways. Eventually I just gave up on the game now I'm back to playing GTA. Hope they sort their shit out cause I love fallout but it's become unplayable for me. 
---
Are you telling me people use their budget for things other than flamingos....?
---
Wow a real moron qho doesnt understand i get:  Caps and Junk from killing his family. 
---
Its part of the game, quit if you dont like it. 
---
The character I made during BETA was a purely gun build, all shooty shooty. Never really got any good weapons. So I made a second character, a pure melee build. 
---
The melee character was constantly getting sweet legendary guns, no TSE's but a couple of TS and one E lol. Some solid Furious or instigating guns. Completely useless for my melee build but really good for the main character who has found sod all. 
---
Thank you fod the info. You are right about google. However, as a relatively new redditer, its neat to post things. Discussions are also better to have. Thanks üòÅ
---
How about a set of skulls that you could place- like the succulents?

I think it does a teensy bit, but it's definitely less than you'd want or expect.

Something I only learned recently is that wearing PA pegs your strength at seven, which is fine if you have five points in Strength, but means your weaker if you have eight. Mind you, only heard that from one source. Needs confirmation.
---
The only melee weapon I've come across that I can't use in PA is the Moleman gauntlet. Slightly annoying. I'm assuming some weapons just won't fit over PA.
---
With regards to cores, I just visit sites that have nuclear generators and/or spawn power armour and steal them. I've build up a list of places I go to regularly.
---
How much did you pay mate?
---
Good to know.
---
Or don't because they literally just stole ur money
---
Never killed them so didn't get shit
---
I've only seen one regular Ultracite Laser pistol myself, which was the one I got from a quest reward
---
Wow I'm trying to join but both times I entered that server it won't let me move. Awesome. 
---
What drives me crazy about this is that this game is pretty much a re-worked port of fallout 4 in a lot of ways, and fallout 4 HAD a garden plot. It was super useful! Why can't we have it in this game? 
---
Really they arent worth anything, just read any new plans and store the rest in the blue suitcase at Watoga Train Station.
---
It was near a location when i was travelling from vault 76 to sutton 
---
Aired and regularly watched in California. 
---
Btw. Its not abug. Others said only does it until level 11
---
only problem i see is teammates will can shoot each other in order to get mutations boost
---
They cut the generator fusion core spawns hard in the last patch. On the plus side, Line in the Sand now works fine and drops two fusion cores.
---
Glad to hear every time someone tries out pvp and has an exciting experience. TSE nerf controversy aside, it is definitely undeniably good for pvp at least and hopefully more people will try it knowing they at least will have a chance to fight back after one shot.
---
Yes, me and lots of others. 
---
&gt;if i was on your team you wouldn't let me play a lock picking thief because you'd be swapping your cards and whining about it constantly. 
---
lol idek what this is supposed to mean? that I would get upset if a teammate picked a lock? why lol.
---
I think you're just an elitist prick, really. the only cringe ITT is literally everything you said. who tf says "munchkin?" you're bragging about how well you play a game because you intentionally opt out of mechanics. there's no being "too literal" about it. the mechanic is there, I am using it as the developers intended. this game, unfortunately, isn't super deep in the rpg aspect. im glad you like to challenge yourself in different ways to enhance your own experience, but it doesn't make you better than anyone. you're kind of just a fucking weeb for slumming comment threads just to jerk yourself off. 
---
I noticed the same thing, with multiple mutations.  I had a mutant's handmade that did the same damage as an anti-armor/vats accuracy version I picked up later on.  By far, the anti-armor does more damage.  Against a scorchbeast, it performs just slightly poorer than my 2-shot lever gun, despite the lever gun having exactly triple the base damage.  The hip fire accuracy, rate of fire and magazine capacity make it a much better option for close quarters and engaging multiple enemies.  The VATS accuracy is a big help, too.

Just take a break from the game man. Maybe it will be patched to a point where you enjoy it again.  If not oh well. Life goes on and there are plenty of games out there.
---
The Forest and the Ash Heap are the places with the weaker enemies. I'd stick to those Regions till you level up a little. There's plenty to explore there.
---
I didn‚Äôt down vote you
---
Personally, I'm not carrying mine, at the moment, because I have calibrated shocks on my t-60 legs...but if and when I find a single calibrated shock, it's coming out of retirement. 10 weight in my inventory for 150 weight for fast travel isn't even a consideration. 
---
Silos have a cool down. You have a Holotape in your inventory (Silo Holotape or something) that will tell you which silos are on cooldown and for how long.
---
TL;DR someone else already fired that one
---
Like +5 damage per mutation capped at 5.  25 extra damage is significant, but not game breaking.
---
Interesting. Never seen that before. Thanks
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre not obligated to join the pvp mode. 
---
Inventory weight mods seem like a cheat unless I am misunderstanding what it is. 
---
Can power armor have legendary effects?
---
Yea you said it. There are freezes, dc, and ctd. All 3 types are happening much more often compared to before
---
The C.A.M.P item IMO are the items where I think they're getting the most creative. I really dig the unique stuff. The only items that got me upset in that section are "Clean" versions of in-game items and that horribly lazy Red Rocket garage door.
---
I really hope they step up their outfit game.
---
Foundations, stairs, and floors are indestructible. Build a foundation with a stair case and build a cover for your resource miner. 
---
Of course not. The whole point is: this game sucks extremely, why waste time and resources on something that is going to suck even more, instead of fixing what we already have?
---
Yeah same for me. Everytime I try to respawn I crash.... this game is un-playable
---
Also Bethesda support don't asnwer to email so dunno what else we can do
---
These Shoguns are really old now, noone will miss them, you can scrap them
---
People know.  It‚Äôs always cleared out even with multiple server hops.
---
I don't remember exactly. I think it was in the "high" CAMP plan price category, which shows up around 900 caps and is reduced down to around 600-700 with Sweet Roll, Grape Mentats, Magnetic Personality, and Hard Bargain 3.
---
PVP not worth it?!  HAH!  PVP is incredibly lucrative, it is just not consistent.  Caps are straightforward with hunting higher levels while junk is random.  I just killed someone today at their workshop and went from 220lb/265 to 812.  I am currently roaming the wasteland dispersing it to lower level players.  
---
&gt;They cut the generator fusion core spawns hard in the last patch. On the plus side, Line in the Sand now works fine and drops two fusion cores.
---
No, they actually fixed Runnemede in the last patch after nerfing the shit out of them in a previous patch. They are back up to 8 core an hour. 
---
Correct me if i'm wrong but it's virtually impossibly to keep mutations before L30. It would be impossible to remove rads without losing at least 1 from radaway diluted.
---
Unless you had a team mate with you who could share Rad Sponge perk at least. Does dying refresh rads?
---
And a stove. The one you put in your house is filthy. I don't want to cook on it
---
Simply put, I refuse to give Bethesda *any* money beyond what I paid for the game until I see they are adding content outside of the atom store as well as inside.
---
The fact that half the shit they've out in the store is 100% recycled assets is just salt in the wound.
---
Mole Miners, Welch. Scrap their gear.
---
I *think* this is a glitch, and the  user is actually fully clothed and protected. 
---
I had a friend go into a mine with me, and he instanced I‚Äôm naked, equipped a power-fist and Leroy-Jenkins the mine naked. To him however he did have clothes on, and he did accidentally also remove his armor for the full effect.  
---
Never though about making an outfit to sell. What's the deal with only having 200 caps for vendors though? 
---
That would make for a good upgraded last laugh.
---
the silos were a perfect idea, I don't think I realized there were that many terminals to hack down there. Thank you! 
---
Yeah I know you didn't and I appreciate that. Did I mistype?
---
Because this isn't PvP. That's why it isn't worth it. It's hide and seek, and whoever loses gets one-shotted.
---
Okay thank you
---
Also need the upgraded machine gun turrets. Found some that were VI or IX in Harper's ferry and they were shooting me with explosive rounds. 
---
Same thing happened to me, I even dumped everything shortly after picking it up because I was nervous about being banned, then it happens anyway for reasons unknown to me, I wasn't over-encumbered on either of my two guys. I guess it was because I kept some of the ammo and 3 serum recipes I looted out of the dupers safe thing he was duping in. Should have known better I suppose.
---
I had considered that, but you'd need a team to do it and you'd need to time it right.
---
2 minute debuff/30second buff (post debuff)
---
Both effects end on death.
---
It could be worked in a non-broken way.
---
I had to rebuild.  It loaded for 2 days with no problem before that.
---
Yeah, nerfing honest players is disgusting. I guess that's what I'll be up against. Another reason not to get excited about playing. 
---
It just adds total weight values, so you can see how much 50 stimpacks weigh all together, or see how much of your weight is in weapons vs aid vs junk. 
---
Doesn't give you more inventory
---
I just moved my camp and it made 4 copies of it. It's pretty common. I would really like Bethesda to fix this because it's pretty damn annoying to scrap hundreds of floor just because I decided to move from the cranberry bog to the savage divide
---
Back to the grind photo mode initiated. you must scrap additional pip boys.......system error controls disabled .....you died. respawn?
---
Server disconnected.
---
They should make weapon skin packs, instead of make you pay one skin for every weapon. They do that for PA, should also work for weapons
---
Same answer mostly, use uranium fever.  One run through you should get plenty of gears.  And black titanium.  
---
Is it the "Brotherhood Fatigues"? Because those are blue, but that image looks green
---
I agree, but I'll buy it since I'm not actually paying for the atoms. 
---
I‚Äôm the only one with a CAMP near Whitespring in our 8 man group.  We got bases all over the map to minimize fast travel expenses.  But good spots are good for whatever reason and attract other players.
---
Heavy gunner 
---
Wow  sorry to hear. 
---
For PC players it crashes EVERYTIME you click on respawn... It's not about drivers, it's Bethesda engine...
---
Better spend the money elsewhere like you said. 
---
First and last time I spend money into this company
---
Nah lol you are assuming way to much shit to fit your narrative. The amount of damage needed to get credit could be as little as a few %.
---
Really need those WEAPON skins. Really need those golden revolvers. Come on son. Some armor skins too. COME ON.
---
Yeah any v.fast weapon would benefit the most from it.
---
But the damage buff could be based on weapon speed/fire rate. The slower it is the more damage.

4. Was near the Watoga train station idling and suddenly heard laser fire start up. Went inside and found two Watoga protectrons going ham on the train station vendor. Vendor was shooting back and saying "The Grafton Monster is a personal friend of the mayor, you are not authorized to protest this peaceful event".
---
+1.
---
If the event is up there's also Census Violence near the power station in the Bog. Deathclaws.
---
You find them a lot at research centers.
---
Something that always bothered me in the later Fallout games is that we're supposed to be hundreds of years from the nuclear war yet nobody thought to take a wet rag to some of the things and perhaps clean things now and then. Everything is absolutely filthy. Unfortunately, I think Fallout 76 will only see clean things as part of the ATOM store. It's annoying but I would prefer cosmetic only items there.
---
Man how does it feel to be so wrong?
---
Crying on reddit like a turd.
---
Smashing camps is my endgame. Go blog about it. 
---
Oh shit i just got 5 bulk ballistic fiber from pvp initiated by me raiding a camp while we are speaking. Nice. I needed that shit. 
---
But nothing to gain right?
---
Dude was lvl 5 who dropped it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You only get one shotted if you do not have PVP gear and perks.  
---
It has a canvas bag, what else do you need?
---
That does happen during peak playtimes, but if you get on at odd hours real quick just to clear it it's usually untouched. 
---
Can build as far down as you can up. 
---
Any news from Bethesda on this yet? I have the same problem where if I get anywhere into Charleston everything freezes for 1-2 minutes then it‚Äôs 50/50 on if I crash or can start moving again. Playing on PC myself. 
---
2 Ghouls 1 Cup
---
That's the workshops. We're talking about the fusion cores that randomly spawn in fusion generators around the map. 
---
The workshop production is pretty good but they enable you for PvP griefing, regardless of where you are on the map. You can mitigate that by walling in the workshop bench.
---
I think you mean northwest. 
---
I found my main weapon a 3* super sledge at lvl 13 so it's not uncommon
---
My boyfriend and I have. We had to fast travel some where and it helped. Or you can't do that at all? Sadly a lot of the time just gotta close the game and restart to fix stuff like that. Ugh.
---
Agreed.  The only one I ever wear on occasion is the BOS scribe outfit, which I found somewhere and have never seen again.  The backpack is pretty cool.
---
I did fast travel a few times. I switched servers and closed the game multiple times and it still hasn't fixed it. 
---
Kill whitespring sentry bots and server hop.
---
The BOS Watoga Vendor sells the plans, and you can get the pistols from enemy drops
---
4 parts of Assassins Sentinel armor, dense mod, Fireproof max rank, Blocker max rank.
---
I didn't.  But I also never unlocked it.  I don't think it exists, but that's just my unverified opinion.
---
I'll have to make a special trip tomorrow to exact a little revenge.
---
I agree.  Why on earth would my in game character go through the trouble of learning plans and then building a busted up crapper and tub.  Wouldn‚Äôt you think we would build it nice and new?  Another CAMP oversight of a rushed launch.
---
Just a heads up, with the last update something changed with the way renderings were handled. I too noticed the change in FPS in certain situations, mainly inside bunkers/buildings/mines. 
---
Update your Nvidia driver in Geforce Experience, and then go to your game tab and see if it changed your suggested "optimized" configuration. For me I had to stop super sampling at 4K and it dropped it down to somewhere between 1440p and 4k. This solved a lot of my stuttering issues in buildings. 
---
And misses a curly hairstyle (for male). There are only afro hairstyles but not with big curls.   
---
Outrageous   
---
I finally got ONE piece of my Excavator to turn red on the monitor after using it for 21 levels with no perks. I‚Äôve been seeing more Scorchbeasts lately and that finally brought me down enough.
---
Seriously, PA lasts forever right now.
---
The game is working as intended. You go read a fucking book, asshat. 
---
At least you get a mouse wheel. On console we have to hit a button to switch to each body part. Then by the time you have it targeted, she flies out of range or behind cover and breaks vats and you have to start all over again. 
---
Mine took tiny amounts of damage, but I had to repair it eventually.
---
If you have black titanium ore, then you use acid to process it into usable scrap.  Basically, just horde the black titanium scrap.  Eventually, your armor will need repair, some mods will need it, etc.  The other things, steel, plastic, springs, gears, and so on are easy to come by elsewhere, but black titanium can only be found from a select few sources.  
---
On that note, Ultracite is just as rare, so horde that stuff, too.  Fortunately, it's only used for a few pieces of high-end gear.
---
I been trying to figure it out seeing different stuff on YouTube. But I figured it was heavy with it being a .50 cal just wanted to make sure. Thanks guys 
---
That's awesome
---
After 200 hours and probably over a hundred visits to the whitesprings bunker, I finally found my first x-01 jet pack for sale. I already have marsupial and can buy a bird bones serum rather easily...time to join in on all this fun
---
3. nope
---
4. Went inside Watoga High School for the first time. Spent at least five minutes moving around the place exploring and scavenging. At that point, an extremely loud noise that sounded like many shots/weapon hits/'getting injured' noises played all at once, I lost a massive amount of health, and multiple enemies (robots) spawned in and attacked me. It would appear that the robots were fighting me all the way through the school, but the combat and damage didn't register until their assets completely loaded (literally *five minutes later*, I'm not exaggerating). This isn't limited to Watoga HS either, I have experienced this in many locales within the game intermittently, from any kind of movement into a new cell - passing through a door, fast travel, or even just running (not sprinting) for a good distance from one cell to another - the enemies, some structures, etc., don't load quickly enough. And please don't fix this by making longer/more loading screens, or restricting the player's movement for 5 minutes until the game is ready to kill the player - make it quicker to load.
---
ok so I use standard black titanium to build and then scrap to repair?
---
I figure that it's the lowest-weight thing to collect.  :p
---
I'm willing to spend dollars on the Atoms shop but there hasn't been anything I've wanted for weeks now so my earned Atoms are simply accumulating. 
---
It's like they don't want to earn extra money this game, the selection is so bad.
---
That's what I'm saying.   
---
Your inventory is a spreadsheet or a database table somewhere. If you know all about databases, i'm sorry, I'm about to bastardize the crap out of explaining this to make it more layman friendly (ie, lie a bit). So do yourself a favor and look away.   
---
 So you have 1 line (so to speak) per item. But it's not all equal. You have 1 line/entry for "stimpacks" and that's got in it an ID code linking it to the "Stimpack" core reference in the game's main objects database table. Ok? So it'll say, like "line 1, stimpacks, see ref code 12345 on table abcd for rules, weight per 0.75lb, quantity 41" now your power armor torso is the exact same about of data "line 2, power armor torso-t-60, condition 70, see ref code 54321, weight 25lb, quantity 1".   
---
Now those 2 lines in your inventory take up the exact same amount of space. So when you load a character into Fallout 76, it's loading up your character's inventory/stash as well. So, 100000000000 stimpacks take up as much data-space as 1 power armor leg. The item's "weight" is not real and does not factor into this. This is why the Stash limit is bullshit the way they have it setup, by weight. 4 pieces of armor take up as much space as 4 holotapes.   
---
But, when it comes to custom naming, here's where it get's tricky. Now if I was designing a game, I'd give the player inventory a special field or 2 called "original name" and "current name", so you could customize your name. IF the developers forgot to do that for some reason, adding it in would require going in and adding that field to an existing database table. Something that could easily screw up the system if it's as wobbly as we know Fallout 76 to be.   
---
My point here wasn't really to utterly savage the explanation of how databases work, or deeply offend any programmers but to get across the idea that this might not be a simple fix depending on how they modified the Fallout 4 engine and how wonky and unstable the servers really are behind the scenes. 
---
ok i have a better understanding of this now, i recently heard someones dog barking/howling the whole time i was in their radius.  its easier to sympathize now with why some people cant really be on mic and coop even if they have one and want to.
---
Is it the whitespring?
---
*Had to hide the forbidden game name because it's usually insta-downvoted.*
---
This is the way it's been since beta. This is the way the game is. I've been passive and been ganged up on. Did I like it? NO. Did I go cry about on reddit? NO. What did I do about it? I LOGGED OFF AND BACK ON. Every day there's threads just like this from people that want BGS to change the game. Do I have a TSE? NOPE.
---
The chat mod community, clan and the community otherwise i would of left ages ago.
---
I had this glitch once. Went away when I rebooted the game.
---
Why not?
---
No it‚Äôs not.
---
Ppl buying duped items with real money, empowered dupers and created the duping market.
---
You cannot have demand, without a need.
---
He does exist 
---
I‚Äôve yet to see him alive tho
---
How were you able to share rad sponge? Every time I try to share it I get a message that says you must have 3 points into perception and I have 6. Any suggestions?
---
that thing‚Äôs existed since the game was released, nothing new really. there are other dead merchants too that spawn randomly
---
Tis a well known bug. :)
---
Take a picture and enjoy the idea of sentient Deathclaws returning to the Fallout franchise lol.
---
He was a boy, she was a ghoul, could I make it anymore obvious?
---
Man if we ever get manniquines and you can dress them up. Share those pics bro. That would be hillarious
---
Make it so that you can only join the same server if you don't switch characters, should avoid the muling problem. You can already join the same server by joining a friend so i don't see why a simple QoL change such as solo-rejoining servers wouldn't be possible
---
the forbidden paint
---
Noooo. U! 
---
Beyond just exploring random locations, try to do any of the events that pop up in the forest area (look for the pulsing hexagons on the map). The power plant event takes awhile, but most of the others can be done in a matter of minutes and give nice XP and an assortment of aid items, some ammo, and usually a weapon or armor piece.
---
Also, try to figure out what kind of build you want and focus your perk card accordingly. Something as simple as a 10-15% damage boost to your favorite weapon class can make the difference between life and death.
---
Nukesdragons.com has an awesome tool where you can design your ideal build and it'll tell you which cards to take at each level. 
---
No, it's North and east eastern section of map is easy (left side) and the north is easy northwest is medium difficulty
---
South west *cranberry bog is high level
---
This worked
---
I thought the shake head thumbs down emote was for this purpose?
---
As a long-time redditor, seeing the same exact question a thousand times is, at best, frustrating. 
---
SUPPOSEDLY there is a way to remove them at one of the energy plants. Didn't sound legit to me but I haven't tried.
---
No. Most are smart and have pacifist on. Too many new players don't use pacifist when they go to the scorch queen. They can be killed when they shoot me and my team accidentally. 
---
Check your sorting settings.
---
No.
---
Black Titanium Ore is unusuable.  You need to use acid to turn it into Black Titanium Scrap, which is what is used for making some high end mods and repairing things like your excavator power armor.
---
How about adding levelable skills to go alongside perks? After 374 lockpicks, I should be and am pretty good at it. Make it a 1/xxxx skill, like your other games already have. Do this for hacking and other perks that are tedious to swap in and out. Thanks for reading!
---
It takes 3 points in Charisma for every point on the perk card to share. Example:
---
3 points in Charisma = you share level 1 rank cards
---
6 points in Charisma = you share level 2 rank cards
---
9 points in Charisma = you share level 3 rank cards
---
and so on and so forth.  
---
I have 9 points in Charisma so that I can share a Max Rank (lvl 3) card that doubles fusion core length most of the time.  But in Nuke zones I share a level 1 Rad Sponge.   I have not ever heard of needing perception points to share any card.  
---
I‚Äôm 51, have a busy job and play to release the stress by stepping into another world for a few hours before i go to sleep. It‚Äôs like a medicine.  
---
I play utterly alone minding my own business. 
---
Leveling up goes extremely slow and i‚Äôve poor weapons but that‚Äôs ok√©. No hurry. Just enjoy everything that crosses my path.  
---
Well. In the beta people weren't stacked to the gills with op weapons and hundreds of bobbleheads to stack......soooooo it wasn't really a problem since most of everyone was pretty evenly matched. But I think you need more caps lock to get whatever point you're trying to make across. 
---
Yeah. Thats fair. You must have cringed at "redditEr"
---
That last sentence metaphorically  captures the eye rolling essence of being a typical woman trying to have a good time out while a typical creeper ruins it.
---
Are you sure you weren‚Äôt out in the real world getting drinks? Christ, in this day and age the rifle line isn‚Äôt even that far off.
---
I hope it's not Bethesda Austin's fault for this, but they are very inexperienced. I mean they helped the id team by doing some post release multiplayer work for Doom, but mostly they failed to build a working game on their own with Battlecry. I mean, after Bethesda made them kill the project everyone thought they were just going to be turned into a support studio for the bigger Bethesda studios.   
---
[https://www.pcgamer.com/battlecry-studios-is-now-bethesda-game-studios-austin/](https://www.pcgamer.com/battlecry-studios-is-now-bethesda-game-studios-austin/)  
---
Though after Fallout 76, I wouldn't be surprised if that was what their future held. 
---
I ... have not. Never needed the extra step before but I suppose it never hurts to test it out.
---
You need 3 points in charisma for every rank of the perk that youre sharing.  So 3 CHa for rank1, 6 for rank 2, etc.  It doesnt matter which special stat you are sharing from, you have to have the Charisma points to share.
---
Next time have more people than the enemy has bullets.
---
I play it because I enjoy the interaction between other players, Aggressive and friendly. 
---
Its a great open world multiplayer fallout idea with an absolute shitshow of an execution. I enjoy the story, the gameplay entertains. 
---
But it's a game that is exercising portion control in what should be an all you can eat buffet.
---
Wheres my meat and potatoes. Wheres the "get an elite team of friends and crawl through these caves to kill a mutated scorchmother that looks like 300 scorch bats all writhing and trying to escape its living hell, all while shitting out scorchbeast queen babies"
---
Give me a challenge that isnt just a bigger version of the scorchbeast I saw at level 5.
---
I need to eat the crunchy heart of an enclave super computer. 
---
Most importantly, and I cant stress this enough. What we need more than anything, is lockpicks that arent made out of. Compressed lead.  
---
10 lockpicks is 1lb. Ridic.
---
You need Dodgy too. 
---
 I disagree almost completely. Its a great game. Its huge and full of stuff and complexity. Its not a bad shooter which is all I really need, and the huge amount of RPG functionality are always gonna be difficult.
---
 Why youtube assholes are your go to is beyond me, they are mostly just trying to scam up views and so anything they can do to shit on something everyone else is shitting on is always gonna be their game.
---
 I've been playing it solo and its almost hard enough. ;)
---
Sorry said the wrong special. That‚Äôs the answer. I need 3 points per card level. I will get level 1 and share 
---
Thank you. 
---
That's like asking if jumping like a kanga is worth it lol.
---
Well that's just stupid...but then again so is Bethesda selling something ultra cool for 3 days only, at least make it a week so people (I) can get paid, their seriously losing money and I think people would be a bit more open to the atomic shop is armor and weapon paints worked on all armor and weapons esp since they are all different...
---
And I didn't even know there was a princess bedüòç
---
Yes. Use class freak perk to minimize the negative effects. 
---
Oh lol still waking up 
---
I generally refuse to use TSE's, and have a couple explosive weapons as "play things" (harpoon guns are fun but amazingly under powered, same with Broadsider) but I rarely break them out, if ever, vs anything but a scorchbeast with the bugged never ending screech.  
---
I'd personally suggest you trade it for a few other good Legendaries, depending on your build. (I can make some suggestions for powerful but balanced items etc)
---
Lol this happened to you 
---
im naming my larry
---
Somewhere on this subreddit you will find a table that lists the resistances of the different power armors. The three you should consider are ultracite PA, X01, and T51b. IIRC, T51b has the best total damage resistance. Ultracite has the best rad resist (again, IIRC), but there's been other posts saying the rad resist applied isn't necessarily spot on and taking rad x equivalent or exceed PA and hazmat suits doesn't mean you take less rad damage in nuke zones. X01 is for energy resistance, and that's sort of limited in the game IMO.
---
I think T51b is the best, but don't be afraid to mix types. I run T51, but I have an X01 helm and T60 legs. T60 is cheap to repair and the legs cost a lot of springs on everything but the T60
---
Maybe go find one of the ( many) market places where dupers are selling these things, or, better yet, farm for your own fucking gear instead of buying it? 
---
Absolutely. One of the chores of this game is running around, and Speed Demon makes that process much better. Move speed is capped at +25% though, so if you have other perks to increase movement speed, it may not be worth it. The reload speed bump is nice too. But you eat and drink way more. So be prepared to have more stuff loaded on you aid tab than normal, or make more frequent stops to stock back up on food.
---
No worries!  It was confusing at first.  So far lvl 1 Rad Sponge seems to work just fine with no need to level up further.  :)  It was a nuke zone game changer for us!
---
We shall remember Larry well.
---
I have a SAM Turret at my base.
---
On PC, since the last patch where you "fixed infinite loading" I get infinite loading far more than I ever had before, like 2 or 3 times a session easily, had it I think once before the patch.
---
Also CTD is way worse, get that at least once per day/session, typically twice.
---
I'd rather you hadn't "fixed" it to be honest, approaching unplayable.
---
it wouldn't be an issue if you could just type in the price
---
Looking at it objectively in comparison with other games while you objectively dismiss any concerns because you play it with friends? Something isn't quite right here.
---
Your friends play it because their experiences with it are enjoyable. You play it with them because your experience with it is enjoyable. People that hate the game and make YouTube  videos about it have an experience making videos that they find enjoyable. People that swear they'll never play it again make angsty Reddit posts because they find that enjoyable.
---
For some reason, the same experience isn't available elsewhere for those people.
---
There's your answer.
---
I don't know if I'd risk it when there's a chance that when you drop something it disappears without a bag. The outcry would be pretty terrible if by placing an armor or weapon on display there's chance it blinks out of existence. I haven't heard of one instance so far of customer support restoring a lost in-game item. That's not a knock on them, but I would like some safety net in place before they implement this type of mechanic
---
The majority of people I've actually talked to in the get have been cool. It's been a great community so far in my experience!
---
https://gearnuke.com/fallout-76-zone-map-level-range/ here is where I found the map. And good advice thank you!
---
Yep. No problem. Thank you for thr map.
---
Oh...that's actually brilliant.
---
If on PC, restart the launcher and log back in there. That will fix needing to log in again in the game client.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  look at that just made a couple hundred real dollars while you texted that needed that shit üòÇüòÇüòÇ you don't get to me it's a game enjoy you life youngen 
---
I can log in or out in Charleston at all. 
---
And serendipity 
---
Yeah true. But it cant be harf to implament. They could just do the same type of coding they do the stash or budget
---
Yeah, apparently you need all kinds of legendary armor, mods and perks to get two-shotted instead of one-shotted.
---
The sad thing is I am mostly solo because the friends I started playing with would not tolerate Fallout 76‚Äôs major issues. I‚Äôd agree that things are better now server stability wise now and better in general but the people I‚Äôd normally be playing with aren‚Äôt coming back anytime soon.
---
In the end I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say solo players just need to group. This is something Beth could and should add.
---
Ya I want to try and power level a friend a bit in the nuke zones. Gonna help 
---
Where are you choosing to respawn that's covered in enemies?
---
Choose a train station. Logout there. Log back in and wait a minute.
---
Are there certain enemies that give you certain mutations or is it randomized ? 
---
Cuz i only manage to get the egg-head mutation.   
---
See with me I like being left alone, I did all the content. I have farmed for hours on end. You mess with me I will kill you again, again and again. Going out of my way to find you even if you have me blocked. I will fight back and well get some enjoyment messing with whoever messed with me and attempted or successfully griefed me. 
---
I said it was a wholely different task to do so. Whether you want everyone *with* duped items banned is a different conversation.
---
That said, demand will always exist, however many people didn't line up to dupe items despite that demand. Possession of a duped item is in a whole different league then actually duping.
---
‚ÄúExterminators‚Äù a serious contender too
---
I had this glitch once, went away when I uninstalled the game, had an old priest and a young priest sprinkle holy water on the motherboard, then put an *unused* condom around the memory unit, THEN reinstalled.
---
Thank you
---
Game Changer.  Im not kidding.  I was sick of managing radiation in nuke zones.  I have mutations too and didnt want them suppressed.  Then I learned about Rad Sponge from reddit...tried it and sweet yes that was the answer.  LOL 
---
Yeah. But that means exiting to the desktop, right?
---
I have been having the same problem I even double checked to make sure I had weapon artisan equipped so idk. Seems like sometimes it works and sometines it won't.
---
Real talk....
---
Who tf puts their camp in Welch 
---
I prefer heavy weapons but i want to obtain them in the world.
---
The satisfaction finding a good and useful weapon killing legendaries mobs is not comparable in my opinion
---
I think the mode will be really good. Really looking forward to it.
---
Yeah, I feel your pain.
---
Everyone says it isn't possible but I have been one-shot with a sledgehammer a half a dozen times (in and out of PA) on both my 80+ character and my level 19 in pacifist mode. I'm still trying to figure out what this mythical slap damage is. The times I have been attacked were all one-shot kills. So... Yeah. That's not fun PVP, but whatever. 
---
What bothers me is I still lose caps and junk. Let's face it. This current system rewards griefers and dupers because they get the stuff you farmed *and* they steal your caps (basically). It's weird that it is setup this way, but since they get goodies, there is no reason for them to stop griefing, oh whoops! I mean "RPing a raider." lol
---
If I'm in pacifist mode, they shouldn't get one piece of scrap or one cap. Period. Wrecked my CAMP but I'm in pacifist? 0 cost to repair. I shouldn't have to server hop because they are being lame.

Note: I know people would rather not die and have no CAMP destruction, but it might be easier to program a toggle option to pacifist that doesn't drop caps/junk and free camp repairs from player damage. It would also need some kind of cooldown timer to prevent abuse. Just a thought. 
---
It used to work for me everytime. Now it hasn't worked for about a week or two without fail....
---
Calm down.  OP is on console where players can send each other messages on their platform. 
---
A lot of people also underestimate how loud their footsteps are. 
---
&gt;lk versions though from vendors. Same with screws you can't bulk them but you can buy bulk screws from vendors
---
Are you sure that's all you kept? Maybe something that didnt seem too rare like an outfit item, or something that was a Dev Room exclusive like the Owl or Trapper masks?
---
Thanks. What does IIRC stand for. And also, how would i get T-60. Just plans or is there an easier way?
---
sometimes i dont want people in my camp/workshop when i am trading with friends. needs to be a way to tell them to piss off. usually if i start shooting them, they just do confused emotes because slap damage doesnt really do anything
---
I only get things for my CAMP.
---
Who says i wanna buy one, i just wanna know the price. 
---
Holy shit you have issues. Those crowns are jokes, barely statistically different than their identical counterparts.
---
The SBQ being one shot by a TS Fat Man? Do you have down syndrome, or is it that you don't realize that that is impossible without ABSURD amounts of exploiting
---
Hopefully they will get it fixed 
---
I tried building up there before and it is t too great. Very restrictive.
---
This is exactly what I've wanted from a fallout game for close to a decade. A nice way to just screw around somewhat aimlessly. In the single player games, I either reach the level cap too quickly or get bored going through the main quest or something else happens. The games have very limited replayability within the same character, if you want replayability you need to start a new game. Here you're not missing out on much and can continue doing the main appeal of the game forever on the same character. And, obviously, the being online part and being able to cooperate dungeons or bosses with people is fun. The game's obviously pretty botched and has some features implemented very poorly or missing altogether, but none of them get in the way enough to stop me from enjoying the game entirely
---
Totally get that.. But sometimes the RNG can be a jerk.  
---
I have a vampiric Gatling gun I love, solid damage output, heals me as I fire and not super OP, for example 
---
Only case where i've found myself stuck on this bug without solution is when I place one of those small slanted walls to make angled roofs with, and then place an upside down one on top. Now they will both support eachother and neither can be removed.
---
I happen to like the music ^ ^
---
It's also a great way to tag a bunch of kills at once for xp :D Not to mention how much ammo you save on the low-level stuff, where you can kill 3 or 4 with a single fusion cell.
---
I noticed the same thing!
---
They did fix that bug in the last patch, or so they claim. So you should be able to scrap it now.
---
I mean the PA skins have some scratches and dings to them. 
---

I mean that princess bed is so awesome - why dont I have it yet!!!  \*stomps feet\*
---
The Atomic shop and limited deals are the same tactic all stores use to try and make things feel exclusive...and the music is akin to slot machines in casinos.  Im an adult and am aware of all these things.  Ive got a bunch of atoms just sitting there waiting...waiting on the princess bed.  GIMMIE SOME GIRLIE SHIT!  LOL :)    Wallpaper would be cool.  Im not holding my breath though.
---
I play it because ARK turned too toxic and anthem isn't out yet.
---
Yeah that would be ideal, and an easy item to add you would think.
---
I end up loading into my account, it just shows his info while doing so, even if I've completely logged him out of Live beforehand.
---
I've run into a dead Deathclaw vendor but haven't seen one alive.
---
Nothing, but it is hard to cater to roleplaying, "hardcore" gamers and casual gamers at the same time. As far as I'm concerned, casual gamers just don't have as much time on their hands hah
---
The Atom Shop items are childish and silly for the most part, and it kinda sets a tone and certainly breaks immersion. Almost as a constant reminder that this is a multiplayer sandbox game, not a single player RPG.
---
legendary ghouls that are diseased will only display as diseased
---
I've watched him move and blow up upon getting close but I am sure that was just the load in animation. 
---
They are not necessarily my go to, but finding any favourable reviews anywhere is difficult, because there really is a lot wrong.
---
Yeah I love it because my high level friend and I play together and we both have it so it works great. 
---
Great? I have a job too? 
---
My whole point is that Camp raids are not greifing and ppl like you are just plain wrong. 
---
Ill continue raiding camps and playing 5he game the way its designed.  Keep up the crybaby reddit posts. Very adult of you.
---
have you found a fix?
---
Hey where did you find out movement speed was capped ? Never seen this bit of info 
---
Against top weapon you need top defensives. But Dodgy makes it so that Agi is consumed before your HP. Get rank 3 Dodgy, if it doesnt make a huge difference, give up on PvP. 
---
I never wear power armor (stealth sniper build), but I carry my Excavator set everywhere I go JUST for fast traveling home when I'm over encumbered on loot. 
---
because the trade window is slow and sometimes when you try to set the price to 0 caps it flips to the top at 25000 caps
---
If you die from rads, I think respawning only removes 25% of it
---
I know 4 was capped around 40% I think but haven't seen anything on 76 
---
Word bruhv thanks for the info.
---
Please, please, please, either mark which plans and recipes we already have. Please.
---
Also, can they weigh less or nothing? A piece of paper should weigh the same as a bobby pin now.
---
Please?
---
PvP not good? Say my nearly 2 million in carry mule would say otherwise. 
---
A syringer mod for meds delivery would be hilarious. You try to range stim a downed friend only to heal the monster next to him. 
---
I do see some potential to be able to radaway a random person at a distance. 
---
They just have to figure out a mechanic to consume the meds with the syringer ammo in conjuntion to a mod. Maybe require a syringer ammo be crafted separate in the similar mechanic to ultricite ammo?
---
A mutation ammo would be pretty pricey if it required the serum found in the enclave to craft it.
---
Why is this downvoted? The same post complaining about buying doubles of plans is posted at least three times every day. 
---
PS4 (pro),.. supramurkat,... My issues. 1,.. Logging in  A,... Logging in, Since 1/15/19 patch, logging is three part login screen, with a new to me black screen with icon bottom right. B,... Camp items. Recently having camp items "ghosting". Example~ Rocket launcher Turret. I will have a RLT on my base camp, Next time I log in, RLT is not there, but the wire is there, and my camp build percentage is the same. C,... Multiple attempts to log in to get to my camp. Do not bump me into another server without my camp, just put me in Q for my server.... MY FEEDBACK, RANTS!!! I've been a fallout fan for quite sometime. I appreciate the hard work that has been put in 76'. But... the "fun" level is not up to where it could be compared to FL4. A, I am not into "survival mode" 24/7, it sucks. B, I am into any kind of "PvP" bull ash shyte at all, being wrecked by endgame hotdogs that have nothing else better to do than wreck somebody else's enjoyment is just not fun. Nerfing anything trying to attempt to stifle the endgame hotdogs just gimps the rest of the player base who just wants to PVE. Make your, divide your  PvP / PVE servers NOW for fook sake. Oh... Okay, I'm getting irritated and my blood pressure is rising. Not good for a 58 year old trying to have a lil fun with spare time :(
---
vally galaria, or what ever the mall is called has a lot of them once you go inside. 
---
If this is happening to anyone else - it‚Äôs an issue with your turrets! I tried everything but as soon as I scraped the turrets, it was fixed. You can rebuild them after you connect wires. 
---
&gt;We recognize these exploits are currently ‚Äúpart of the game‚Äù and we know we need to make fixes, but it doesn‚Äôt mean taking advantage of them is acceptable.
---
Doesn't seem like they recognize that exploits are *part of the game*. What's unacceptable is the state of Fallout 76. 
---
Exploits affect nothing balance-wise that wasn't already crippled by poor design decisions. The only thing Bethesda cares about is crucifying the players undermining their business and public reputation by monetizing their shoddy netcode for actual dollars, and they're so insecure about it that they are *hijacking the accounts of paying customers* (on suspicion alone, despite what this "alarms" nonsense leads one to believe, driving in a Cadillac while black is also an "alarm" to some people) and holding them ransom until the account holder can explain to Bethesda how their own game engine works. Maybe management should just consider this money part of the back pay they owe these players for testing this game and exposing its problems?
---
Furthermore, has it occurred to this community that many of these testers have been writing and modding inside Gamebryo for over a decade longer than the novices they relocated from Battlecry to actually make Fallout 76? Consider that, instead of the blind assumption by this community that Bethesda hired skilled labor to make FO76, they instead hired the *cheapest* labor. The players breaking this sloppy and unfinished software are miles ahead of the studio tactically, have decades more experience, and Bethesda's only real management response, like any out-of-touch and highly insecure business team, has been punitive. This response is likely based on the limitation of the tools available to them, and like hammering screws instead of just buying a screwdriver, **Bethesda's only potency involves holding accounts ransom and extorting them for unpaid technical consultations.**
---
As a greater issue, this community is suffering from some kind of pathological collective delusion if it's default orientation is to just accept anything coming from the mouth of a company that's on record as liars and grifters. It's like people who still think voting works or that Starbucks is "ethically sourced." Just because you're an addict doesn't mean you shouldn't learn to be skeptical of the people cooking your drugs.
---
Yes, it's in the bunker, you have to go to the military wing, then up to command. 
---
Vendors. They're not clearly labelled though.
---
Oof downvotes cause people had seen it before love this community
---
I play because I enjoy it and it's a pretty good game.
---
It isn't for everyone. The story is told in a way that those that need to be handheld and shepherded thru a game will not get or even find. People that play like that will objectively think it's shit. If I was one of them I would agree with them.
---
I happen to enjoy mucking thru the biomes learning how all these various survivors ended up dead. That even after a nuclear war people just couldn't come together and overcome a common threat. That people walled themselves up into their various factions and refused to cooperate with other factions until they were all finally overwhelmed by the scorched.
---
It's a good story.
---
Now, after a round of bug fixes in the next patch we will get a new game mode that is much more hardcore, and a vault opening DLC.
---
The game will grow. NPCs will be added, there will eventually be a player hub and even more DLC etc...  
---
Yup.  Im almost always in a team of 3-4 and Perk Sharing is amazing.  I dont think we really got into Perk Sharing or understood it until about 2 weeks ago.  Now we co-ordinate who's sharing what and even discuss what we're going to level up next.  Ive got Power Patcher and that never opened for a team mate...now I just share it when they need it and they dont have to be frustrated anymore.  
---
You're not going to get everyone to agree with you.  Let your own arguments stand on their own without devolving to baseless assumptions regarding age, living arrangements, or complexion.  
---
I don't agree with raiding low levels either but with this many players in 76, ESO-WW is just as likely to be an adult as a teenager. 
---
Nah, but it's never really bothered me enough to try to look for one. First thing I'd try is restarting the Xbox between logs though. 
---
Personally, I hated it.  I run with 2 stars of class freak and felt like I was always having to stop and drink, even with rank 2 dromedary.  The benefits are great, but I disliked the tedium of always having to drink.  I guess you could hotkey purified water, but I was going through so much that I could foresee a point where I'm resorting to drinking dirty water from stagnant pools.  The food wasn't that much of an issue.  It's up to you.  Try it out and remove it if you hate it, preferably after you have tons of caps to re-acquire the mutations you may have lost in the process.
---
Welp keep playing russian roulette then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Boiled water has calcium, magnesium and/or potassium where as purified water removes those essential minerals. Also, this isn't why, I just made that up to justify dumb game mechanics.
---
I dunno. I really want those PVP servers but won't the trolls just stay if everything stays the same on the PvE servers? I.e. The broken bobblehead stacking, etc? 
---
Green Thumb is vastly underrated. Makes it a lot easier to get food/drink items.
---
Most schools rent them, the school I went to the science teacher owned it and most radioactive materials it was used for. 
---
since you can only take so many photos and I take uit a lot and it shares the gallery it sucks, but i'll try restarting and report back
---
Like a heal dart... heals your teammates/pets removes enemy mutations for like :30 seconds 
---
The butthurt tho lol
---
Own servers?! When?!
---
I've had an obsession with him over the last 3-4 days.  Been trying to get him to spawn. Some times others spawn instead.   Around 60-70 hops over that span.
---
So far I've had:
---
Pied Piper eyebot
---
Responders eyebot. ( He asks to scan you, but I didn't have a responders outfit.)
---
A dead Responder vendor bot
---
Enemies, usually 5+ of them.
---
Actual vendor x 3 (got cuckoo clock. Union outfit for 1000 another time)
---
And a shit ton of nothing more often than not.  
---
even weirder when said stanger teleports through your window to use your chem table. 
---
lol! I've ran into a few people who still have their mics on all the time. Last one I could her children crying, it was disturbing.
---
Por que no los dos?
---
I take one before a queen fight and try to offer them to my team if I have an extra.  
---
Harper‚Äôs ferry vendor bot ;)
---
The datamined Power Armor skins look quite nice but I have no clue when they are coming.
---
I honestly just want them to bring back the Tribal Power Armor and Scorched Sierra Power Armor.  They look awesome because they are modified suits.
---
Nobody knows.
---
Maybe the Deathclaw statue and the Kill, Laugh, Love sign. I mean I've got almost 6k saved up.
---
It's fun as fuck, the world is beautiful and expansive. It's frustrating and it needs to be balanced, but I'm having a blast.
---
Purified Water would be too precious. Why build foundations with gold, lead or aluminum, if you have concrete. But yeah, no real reason why not use Purified Water.
---
Yeah I'm 100% certain, all I had was my normal junk and armor stash 10000 of my 3 ammo types I use and the serum recipes. I figure it was the recipes as I had 5 of each of the 3 types Chameleon, Speed Demon and one other I can't remember now. Pretty obvious I didn't buy them at the vendor since they're crazy rare but I didn't make them myself so I thought I was good. He had 500 of them when I first opened the safe.
---
What you do is drop anything else. Once you see the bag, you press r to transfer. Then you place your junk.
---
It‚Äôs not Russian roulette, it‚Äôs just a bug we work around because that‚Äôs what you do in Bethesda games
---
Pfft, ffffp, pfft, worth it?! "Worth it" he asks! Of course it is! I've had it for like 80 lvls and I didn't even realize it had a negative to it. -4 int, what does Int even do for me anyway? Doesn't help me hit or shoot things so nothing, that's what!
---
Yea I watched the video on Monogah, and if there are scorched, its a hot bed of activity. I didnt see the other video on Bolton Greens‚Äî bummer!
---
Whitesprings. Clothing shop across from the bookshop. next to where you can get the ratty dress.
---
Most of the time people don't bother picking them up.
---
I found a vampiric tesla rifle which I‚Äôve not used.   If I am pacifist mode, would this rifle allow me to mass-tag enemies without damaging other players?
---
How is it pay to win for plans that you pay caps for in game? Using a currency that you also earn by playing the game.
---
I didn't say buy weapons with currency. I didn't say buy legendary equipment. I said plans. If I want to use my atoms that I've saved up to buy a lever action plan, instead of fast traveling from vendor to vendor and world jumping trying to buy the plan with caps; how is that pay to win.
---
(I'm level 59 first play through, and I've earned over 4500ish atoms . They're not hard to come by)
---
Yeah i found it thanks m8
---
Sort of. The flag is meant to be facing different directions depending whether it's wartime or peacetime.
---
I use marsupial, bird bones, and speed demon.  Then get strange in numbers for a huge boost when in a full group.
---
I love the mutations system.  I have 8 mutations currently.
---
Purified water is for medicinal crafting
---
Been looking for ages, never seems to have em!
---
I want to point out the files for these horsemen power armors have been in the game's data since the BETA. I've been waiting this entire fucking time for them.
---
More like every.dev wants MTX since it became a muti billion dollar thing close to a decade ago.  At this point MTX probably makes more then sales across gaming indistry.
---
r/asslick NSFW 
---
you dumb dumb
---
End of month patch will be more fixes, not content. 
---
They are holding off on releasing new content so they can release it at the same time as the new game releases happening in the middle of Feb (Metro Exodus, Far Cry New Dawn).
---
Cool, always nice to see another programmer also like fallout title.
---
30 minutes was a joke to start with.
---
Let's rethink it from software engineering perspective.
---
Currently they're doing it with a simple 'fill in' distribution, you always assigned to a server with less than 24 population, they won't put player into an empty world unless they all full, so players are normally not see 'world is full, queuing' notification unless you joining friend's world.
---
There is no other consideration during this process. Your friend list doesn't count, your camp location doesn't count.
---
What players asking now require more than just a distribution engine change but also a separate database table to store user's last joined world id to make it happened.
---
Judged by the time they spend for controlling dupe issue, I can't believe they have the ability to implement said feature within a reasonable timeframe.
---
As I mentioned in another post, they may using nosql to store character data without a relation database, when user joining a world, client download json from server then render the items from the json string. That's why they can't write a single SQL query (where item.count &gt; 80000) and ban accounts during coffee break.
---
And explained why you need 10ish seconds to load your items, appearance after you joined the world. No 'on demand' query so the game has to load them all at the same time.
---
The current structure is not suitable for those things because seems no one thought it during the design stage.
---
This is a unbelievably crap product because the IT project is bad in the first place.
---
Flavor
---
Your right just having fun riling up someone that is just trying to get me going
---
If it's a decon shower it will take away mutations unless your have 2 star starched genes
---
Rubbery ghoul &amp; supermutant masks.
---
What a bitch! I‚Äôve seen them there once. Happy hunting 
---
Well, looking for good weapons is pretty much all of an endgame there is imo.
---
Ha..made me lol for real
---
not very pricey if you know serum recipe
---
Honestly, I pick up more stuff than I can sell each day. There's no real need to try to maximize profit, as long as vendors are capped at 200 a day, with only 7 vendors. I don't bother with hard bargain, or the mentats that up selling price of any of that, or farming for specific high value things, because at the end of the day, you can make 1400 caps. All that other stuff just means you make your 1400 caps with less stuff, and then you have a bunch of stuff that you wind up just dropping, because there's nowhere left to sell it.
---
THIS IS ~~SPARTA~~ WASTELAND!
---
I like the sepiatone photos.  I also love the ushanka hat.  It feels very wasteland-ish.  What outfit is that in pic 3?
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeah theres question Mark's emote?
---
I do, but I‚Äôm not the one on trial here. Provide proof. You have done nothing but dodge my reasonable request. It really doesnt show well of you. So, proof bitch.
---
Im on PC. 
---
New photo and name "Forest Camo BOS"
---
Nope. I agree that demand will exist, but not everyone w/TSE  items, duped.
---
It‚Äôs those folks who put the time in legitimately, to  get  TSE, that are pissed. Now they‚Äôre going to get stuck with all TSE folks who duped.
---
You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion that folks who bought duped items are held to another standard. But from the published Bethesda TOS,  guilt by association applies.
---
Everyone in game, wants better, faster meaner.  Everyone in game  does not cheat, to get there.
---
But If it helps, Bethesda will inevitably decide what‚Äôs fair and reasonable.
---
Yeah, when I come across a legendary of a weapon or armor I use, with a useless effect, I'll mod it and lug it around. This way in the weapons tab I can scrap indiscriminately without worry
---
I hear you tho' we shouldn't have to
---
I built a camp with 5 missile turrets, a heavy laser turret, an extractor, two small water purifiers and a extremely minimal shell and platforms for each turret except the laser all spread around a circle with the wire connectors protected from damage. Basically it dominated anything that was stupid enough to come close including ScorchBeasts.
---
I assume it was a commentary on the community. You want to act like a bunch of children, well then here are your toys.
---
Maybe if you play for hours on hours every day. Others, like myself, would like to make caps quickly
---
Pretty sure it's on the Bethesda plz list.
---
So why it wasn't taken down is beyond me, c'mon mods you guys are slacking here. 
---
I spent all my video game money on it and I'm bored with my other games. I'm saving up and I'm going to get Monster Hunter next and then maybe someday a PS4 so I can play Bloodborne and RDR2. Also, and I know I'm a jerk for this, I'm kinda enjoying what a clusterfuck the release and development has been, sorta like warming your hands by a dumpster fire.
---
well gold and lead would probably be to soft and aluminum cant really be forged it has to be casted. but i am not a smithy and probably very wrong.
---
on topic: the only reason is they probably since some of the stuff you cook still gives you rads they thought people would complain about purfied water cooking giving you rads.
---
Yes this too
---
The key is to have lots and lots of ghouls and to verify they are there *before* you launch. Places that occasionally have bunches of ghouls include Morgantown (downtown area by the uni.)
---
what do you mean? is that a statement or a badly structured question?
---
2x fireproof plus dense makes you immune, as does jumping using marsupial. 
---
Yeah, i was thinking the same thing, even if my explosive gun is pretty normal, considering the future nerf, is not op at all
---
The brick wall when going through the main quests solo is when you reach Top of the World.  That's where higher level players hanging around causes mobs to be much higher levels, typically.  Best course is to do other activities for awhile until you've leveled up enough to tackle them.  
---
Might be a blueprint of your home if you moved camps recently. Should be under stored or blueprints, you can scrap it or place it back down in the shape it was in before you moved
---
‚ÄúAk-shew-ally‚Äù nerds can throw a fit and deny it with math all they want. You absolutely can be one-shotted with slap damage.
---
It happened to my husband, and I was present to kill the griefer. No, we were not wanted deliberately or accidentally (we despise pvp). No, we had not taken a shop (we were at a station).
---
Piss and whine with ‚Äúliar‚Äù or ‚Äúyou were mistaken‚Äù all you want. Yes, it happened, and shocked the hell out of us.
---
If I spend 6 hours getting 3k caps in-game I‚Äôll do whatever the fuck I want with it. Thanks. 
---
He's not disagreeing with your bobble head claim.  He's explaining that's unfortunately how the passive mode works as currently designed. 
---
 Je suis sur PC.
---
Nouvelle photo et nom "Forest Camo BOS"
---
So don't?  You get a steady amount of atoms from just playing, and only a small amount of stuff in the store looks good.  Think I'm stifling on 4k caps and have used a couple k on camp stuff.
---
Thanks! I think I wore the drifter outfit in most of these. I could be wrong though, since I took these back in november lol.
---
*plot twist*: There's another bear, tied up, covered in honey, and gagged with a cherry, in the oven. 
---
Because he's complaining about something a good 90+% of the community wants (myself included) and that's a big no no on the internet. 
---
Yeah no problem man. There‚Äôs another sub just search up r/fo76 and more may pop up. 
---
Bravo
---
The harpers one is the old one that was actually connectors I‚Äôve been looking for them to. I have seen a video of them drops g on a table in the shack at the power sub station to the east of whitesprings right across the road. ( I haven‚Äôt had any luck with that but I have only tried 12 times). The other I have heard is Watoga brotherhood vendor I tired 3 times and got the plans for Cali shocks and forgot entirely about doing it. Lol so I can‚Äôt vouch for them but that‚Äôs some Iv heard you can get them at. Also heard somewhat that doing events and defend events at the dirt track workshop north west side of the map has a high chance of dropping them.
---
I see them frequently. If I find them today I‚Äôll let you know and if you‚Äôre still looking for them I‚Äôll give it to you. 
---
Laser weapons.
---
Unfortunately it isnt. I have no blue prints or anything 
---
In game vendors sell the serums for 100-200 caps each.   /r/f076bazaarif you're on XBOX  Micro Uzi Stock sells them for 100 caps, makes them himself, has very neat shop building.   
---
Because I like it.
---
The only filter I see is to move between abilities and on percetion I only have 5 cafds in the idle tray
---
The cards are gone, like they never existed
---
The area you port to is inside the elevator, just on a different floor. There shouldn‚Äôt be any geometry, unless they changed something.
---
I think it's perfect for the shop
---
I flip between that and enclave uniform myself, both just look good to me.  Odd that most outfits looks like goodwill rejects pulled from a dumpster.
---
Non combat robot pets for my camp.
---
Same, but I wouldn't mind getting a power armor skin if a decent one ever showed up. 
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
I guess you are the one hiding and one-shotting from a bush somewhere.
---
A challenging PvP experience!
---
It is possible. They‚Äôre wrong.
---
Yeah, definitely has its uses, I was just feeling trapped by it. Like I couldn't play without wearing it. Now I'm freeeeee
---
I rather they fix this dumpster fire.
---
what would HAVE to happen, is yes, it would allow you back onto the same server, however if the world is already distributed / full, you'd have to sit in queue or be given the option to move to a new server.
---
Another issue is that the servers should be upgraded and additional people per server would be nice.
---
Funny thing is that some people LOVE unbalanced pvp and this mode will keep them entertained. 
---
You've not thought this through **at all**. First off, if the stash's were shared you could just make a bank toon. Since toons can hold an infinite amount of shit you could grab everything out of your stash on said bank toon and then go back to storing shit on your main. Obviously leave enough in your stash to get by on, but store excess shit and weapons/armor you wont use often or plan to use in the future on the bank toon. Thus you have infinite stash space with a shared stash. And that's exactly why we'll never get a shared stash.
---
That being said I don't understand what you mean by:
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt see why you would want to basically have two exact same characters.
---
Are you trying to say that every character is the same? Or is there something else I'm missing here? Because I have 5 toons and they're all very different. Yes, they do all have access to the same perk cards, but they all have vastly different SPECIAL points.
---
I‚Äôd also like the ability to craft the raised planter boxes that can be seen throughout the world for build a greenhouse or indoor garden. 
---
Ah damn it I forgot to greet and my C.A.M.P. / House explicitly. I will correct this today.
---
Confusion 100
---
That's what she said.

What we have now is proof enough that it won't.
---
If you get 11 charisma and hard bargain 3, you sell items to vendors for 25% of their base value (listed in the pip-boy). That's the most you can get for selling items, you'll never get more than 25%.
---
The halloween outfits you're selling have a value of 200 caps, right? if you have 6 charisma and hard bargain 3, take some Grape Mentats for +5 Cha before selling items to vendors and you'll ensure you always get the best value possible per item.
---
 I do exactly what you do with crafting the halloween outfits, I carry a stack of 100 on me at all times (only weighs 10 lbs), and sell them 4 at a time to vendors for the full 200 caps perfectly every time!
---
I'm still holding on to enough Black Titanium for a full excavator set whenever my gf feels she's ready to take that step. 
---
There‚Äôs no friendly fire on a team though, right?
---
I recently made a post about how to recover some of your lost camp budget. 
---
I would like to see a Tech Tree of sorts with all the Plans and Recipes on it...
---
Just this morning I was heading interested a nuke come, all ready to go, and I disconnected. I tried to friend request a person on my recent players lost, but they didn't accept, so I had to just live with the disappointment of having little to do. So, I loved over to my alt to do quests, etc. I'm not bored with the game. I'm just tired or being denied end game content, what little there is. 
---
No.. you're right.  If you don't attack someone, you normally take reduced damage.  It's their "slap" system.  You have normally have to concent to pvp by attacking them back.  Pacifist mode disables your damage to other players so you don't do damage back.
---
The problem isn't with that, it's with systems in the game like workshops that "concent" you to pvp without you necessarily realizing it.
---
Currently there's an exploit where if you own a workshop, someone can go to that workshop, start to claim, then cancel the claim.  This "concents" you to pvp so they can now travel to wherever you are on the map and kill you.
---
This man is on the money
---
I guess that's because they are afraid of a PvP that actually puts both parties on a level playing field.
---
I think it came from one of the Brotherhood quests. I have it too and don‚Äôt recall ever finding it and sometimes miss the full list of rewards because I‚Äôm focused on something else. I figure it was a quest, because I got the Enclave equivalent after completing one of their missions too.
---
Mutations are stupid and take away from the Role Playing aspect of the game. They are also overpowered as it is because you can stack them meaning that you pretty much have to be mutated to be able to compete. The last thing we need is to make mutations even more powerful.
---
Boy meets ghoul
---
Been happening a lot to me too. Just log out and reload is my only solution.
---
Aaaa
---
Awesome I will check it out. Thanks!
---
Yes.  I run with healing factor, speed demon, marsupial and bird bones.  LVL 3 Class freak to reduce negatives by 75% so Speed Demon only takes a -1 hit which I counter with an armor piece.   I like to run without power armor all the time so its great when I need to "nope" the F out of there.
---
I have a farm at my camp and every day I will cook all my plants and meat.  I have max lvl Good with Salt so food doesn't spoil quickly and I dont go through it all in hours of gameplay.  Im usually the 'mom brought snacks ' for my entire team.  I dont find I have to eat that much more often than before...maybe because the LVL 3 class freak?  
---
Youve missed the point you cannot damage a player in pvp until you hit each other does that benefit melee or ranged?
---
leave team, shoot each other, and join team again
---
True, but I'd like something that says "I fight deathclaws".  Like deep claw marks or scrapes in the paint, bullet dents/spalling, and perhaps some surface rust.  
---
Something that looks like it's seen a LOT of miles on the road and withstood tremendous abuse, kinda like the popularity of "relic" guitars, where it looks very, very well loved.
---
I like stuff that looks old and worn.  The atomic shop seems to have a lot of pre-war flair and dazzle items.  A designer party dress may have been expensive before the collapse of civilization, but it would be worthless in an existence filled with mutated animals, bandits and hostile environments.  I'd like to see more shop items in that theme.  Really grizzled, crusty armor and weapon skins.  You're not going to take a boxer too seriously if he doesn't have an eyebrow scar or two.
---
But have you noticed the lunchboxes that are shown in the background while your browse the shop? Just see for yourself. Hit the store and watch the background for about 15 seconds
---
I'll check em out, thanks!
---
Much appreciated!
---
Yeah, the limitation on caps I think actually contributed to the RMT sales for the same. I've watched three different multi-player games *stop* being tight fisted about earning in-game currency and poof! Gold seller markets dried up. 
---
Starve the player base of the means to get X (X being caps or other resources) and it becomes an RMT breeding ground. 
---
&gt; but I'm fairly certain they will put in shared stash 
---
They will never put in a shared stash... at least not like the way the current stash works. They might make a weapons/armor bank like borderlands 2 where you can put a limited number of items in it to share across toons, but a shared stash is actually a bad idea from a developer standpoint. That would enable everyone to make a mule (something many already do, but it's a PITA to do now) and just grab everything other than ~100 of each crafting mat out of their stash leaving it at around 150-200. Your mule or bank toon, whatever you want to call it, can hold an infinite amount of stuff so if the stash just becomes shared, then the stash weight limit becomes null and void. You just park it next to a stash and never move it.
---
Ohhhh I see, yeah that's a little deeper than I was thinking. I thought it was kind of glitched out and showing his instead of yours, not straight-up joining your gallery. 
---
Don't quote me but I think it only counts what you gather from logs.
---
Mutants should become wanted when discovered.
---
There is an actual message that says, You cannot travel to Forbidden Areas!
---
Yep. Same.
---
LOL so true.  In landscape as hostile as Appalachia, who in their right mind would be walking around in a party dress?
---
They patched the getting stuck in armor, mostly.  This will either clear up after a bit or can server swap to fix.
---
I get what you mean and why that would change how it works, i always collect from logs and thats what makes it so frustrating 
---
Like the vault boy ‚Äúnuke check‚Äù emote but instead of the thumb the finger?
---
Currently, I use a VATS-crit build with heavy use of the drug Overdrive. My weapon of choice is a prime anti armor western revolver. Anti armor works insanely well against scorchedbeasts. A shot against a SB does about 5-ish % if its health and a crit does about 8-10%.
---
I randomly found a two shot the dragon when I was like at level 30, it was on a wendigo in white springs, it was not a nuke zone too
---
Not really. Not like it would be. Right now, maybe like 1 in 10 people have mules and those mules (outside of dupers and cheaters) don't really carry a whole lot of stuff, mainly just weapons and shit. If everyone had access to a shared stash then everyone would create a mule and then the stash wouldn't have a weight limit anymore. Your mule effectively creates an infinite stash.
---
...But did you open it?
---
You're going to be done with the game because you've gotten used to the extra 100 cw that you shouldn't have had in the first place?   
---
You supposed to do this in your 20's, but I did that my mid 30's and those beasts were hard, then you get sent around the map into the thick of 30-40 level beasts for related quests.
---
I went back again after posting this and tried even just building a single foundation with nothing on it. Still wouldn't save, and I'm now disconnecting within less than a minute of building anything there. Finally gave up and went exploring and didn't have any more disconnects for the rest of the session. I genuinely feel like this spot is cursed or something.
---
No one is stopping you. Come join us.
---
Anti-armor tears apart SBs.
---
The It's a Trap event it works.  The sonic emitter is, I think, just a game caller.
---
No it was just laying on the ground and locked
---
havent seen the issue i repair every day. grognaks will not repair to 200% btw.
---
I find the game relaxing to play and fun to explore.
---
No one else HAS to like it but I can't stand those who attack people for daring to like the game.
---
Just add in radx, radaway syringes.  Radaway can also mess with people's rad builds and also stim syringes to mess with bloody builds as well as heal teammates. 
---
You obviously don‚Äôt know what your talking about, which makes me smile. It does not matter if you have 1 purifier or 100, the rate the water is produced is the same. The only thing that changes is how much is stored. So yeah I‚Äôm not gonna stand around for several minutes for 1 water to be produced. 
---
I will continue to leave them unlocked, just as my entire camp is, because its really only a big deal when I need purified for crafting. I can just boil some water if all I need is a drink. Then again, so can all of the people that come into my camp and take every last water, yet you don‚Äôt seem to find that as stingy? 
---
Seems your the one that is trying real hard to defend stingy actions in an online game. If other people want to lock their water because they need it for crafting, that doesn‚Äôt make them an asshole who deserves to have their camp destroyed by the water police.  
---
I did not know that. Any reason why?
---
Take my up vote, sir! 
---
Is this bunker titled Bunker 3? I‚Äôve never seen that yet. Where can I find this, please?
---
Completely deleted at thisnpoint
---
I can empty out all the vendors with 2.8 lbs of stuff I don‚Äôt have to farm form. It keeps the stash and carry weight light. And if you‚Äôre doing it with crafted outfits, you never have to farm for it
---
We'll see. Since they'll nerf Explosive and TS that much, there's reason to expect that they're willing to make changes in the future too. Keeping in mind that this game is not an E-Sport game, the PvP is not too bad.
---
There're groups of people who organize PvP battles, where they ban all TS/Explosive and 2star Legendary combos that are too powerful. I can imagine that being quite fun. Never tested though... 
---
Oh damn, you‚Äôre right. 
---
That‚Äôs why we need playtesters, if I was a developer I wouldn‚Äôt have even thought of that.
---
I enjoy doing events but often I won't fast travel to them if they are to far away. I have done this before only to find the even is nearly over and impossible to complete. Now I'm out caps, gained nothing and super far away from what ever I was doing last. Very annoying. 
---
No, because everyone wouldn't use the normal stash space anymore, everyone would just use the "shared tab" and then make a mule. Grab the excess shit off the stash from the shared tab and leave enough to operate normally (50-100 crafting mats, a bit of back up ammo and that's all) leaving your stash with maybe 300 weight in it and your mule **loaded** with shit. Thus you're effectively getting infinite stash space with your concept.
---
The only way to make a shared space work is to vastly limit what you can put in it, maybe only weapons and armor.
---
I mean dedicated pvp servers for the pvp crowd, mybad. So hopefully the 2crowds wont clash so much anymore
---
Because vendors are not garunteed, anyone cold start the game and even before playing for the first time, drop a load of the parents money into weapon plans for the atomic shop, get into the game for the very first time, go to a weapon bench and build any of those weapons that should be rare or harder to come by.  
---
That is pay to win, if it actually effects gameplay, it is pay to win
---
Or have a shared stash to transfer items between.  My other character has magazines as I collect in the hopes of displaying them one day.  But takes up too much space on my main.
---
I kill those robots like nothingüòÇ
---
30 minutes in the nuke done gives me enough to Max out all the venders in one trip.
---
Question: Why do so many gamers not use a mic for communication?
---
So if you have 19 charisma (unyielding), is there any point in taking grape mentats? 
---
Yeah Monongha is all right, better if you're lucky enough solo (I was) got a ton of yellowcake flux like everyone else was mentioning. I had a hard time respawning the bloaters though, and only found one legendary inside the power plant. 
---
The only cosmetic clothing I swap into from time to time is the brotherhood scribe outfit.  It has a cool backpack and looks well-worn.  I'll have to keep an eye out for the drifter piece.
---
FYI, the bottlecap glasses actually look really cool when coupled with a veil or bandana.  I was wearing the welding goggles for a while, but the cap glasses look a bit cooler and larger.  A veil, cappy glasses and combat helmet make me look like a grizzled survivor.  It's probably weird for me to show up as a lvl 130-something in shadowed combat armor and a fully cloaked face with a suppressed combat rifle and be friendly to other players.  I probably look more intimidating than if I was wearing a dirty suit.
---
Yes.  It is a bit of a 'wild goose chase' to get the key.  https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/26/fallout-76-nuka-cola-power-armor-paint/
---
Hope that helps! :)
---
I unlock it, just for the exp. 
---
Don't just make a skin for one damn weapon, have it apply to all weapons.  
---
There's a quest that in Watoga that makes all the robots friendly towards you. Called Mayor for a Day. Listen to the radio and investigate the mayor's office. 
---
You would be surprised at how hard it is to kill someone in pacifist. It can be done, it is all about timing. Most dupers (no ex dupers...so so so many people I know got banned) that mule have to walk away to go to their other xbox in that time you can slaughter the mule gaining the loot.   
---
If anything it was two fold this last week. I stole a shit ton of junk off of mules and some guns/ammo/armor/aid from world stashes and then before they could replenish their mules they were banned.   
---
Still been a bit worried I will get flagged for my weight but it seems that it was only those that spam to create items including ammo.   
---
As for normal PvP I use terrain but I don't hide like a cuck in the corner. 
---
**I'd love to see plans GRAYED OUT if you know them (in vendor windows, trade windows, and dropped bags).**
---
Just like the weapons looked when you were level 20 and got a level 40 weapon, it was grayed out.
---
You could still buy grayed out plans, but at least you know you knew them first.
---
20 minutes he was walking north from Poseidon Plant
---
Yep, making the planter a foundation (like you see at Flatwoods church) would be a godsend
---
Yeah, first time I tried to get up there I was maybe 20.  There was a level 60 or so radscorpion up there, which I hate those things to begin with since I have a weird phobia about bugs.  The other times I went up there there were multiple level 40-50 flying bugs of some type.   Which is why I then decided maybe it would be a good idea to hold off on the main story quests for awhile.
---
The stupid thing is when I did go back at level 45, it happened to be right after an update when the servers were taken down.  I was the first person there when the servers came up.  There wasn't time for any high level players to bump up the mob levels, and the only things there were a couple level 10 ticks.  Which shows you how much the dynamic mob scaling system currently used completely changes the experience.
---
Its exactly like real life.  People are blowing tse proportion when its not the issue people and bobble head duping is.  Just like rl, guns aren't the issue, people are.  Remove guns in rl, or TSE in FO76, people will still find a way to kill.
---
That's what the people under the stairs want you to think.
---
But options to bring up the map. Hit L1 to bring up the menu. Scroll down like 7 or 8 times to get to settings, and hit x. Hit x to enter game settings. Scroll down 4 or 5 times to pacifist mode, and hit x to toggle it on or off. Then hit circle about 4-5 times to back out of all those menus. It's really cumbersome to turn on or off.
---
I play it because i enjoy it. 
---
That would be perfect!
---
We keep calling it a stash, if we get away from that term, leave the current stash alone and as is then I'm fine with this. Put a mail system in that can hold up to 6-10 **non stackable** items at a time and mail shit back and forth between your toons. I'm fine with that, the problem comes when you start being able to trade mats back and forth easily that the stash loses all meaning.
---
Not to mention all the implications this will most likely have to dupers.
---
Buy serum at the enclave for 5k caps. Or trade with players, around 1k caps.
---
They could raise the stash limit to 1200, raise the encumbrance limits about 50%, then make the stash shared across characters and just stop you from pick up anything when encumbered.
---
Great so I‚Äôm not alone what are you supposed to do? Or is it just time to give up on this game. 
---
He just made a vid, folks have been nuking  it on and off 
---
Maybe it is because I'm a male, but I fail to see this correlation
---
Thanks !!
---
We found the Cali Enclave member.
---
Spooning f76 dirty little secret
---
Oh I never knew that. Just always thought it was supposed to be like waving as if you're walking forward.
---
you are a god send for finding this out.
---
I read it as fluff
---
It's a stupid rumor that spread through this subreddit a couple weeks after launch. 
---
Seriously takes the spot
---
I use speed demon and a bunch of other mutations without class freak and I haven't had any trouble with the water drain. If you've caught dysentery and managed to keep your water up through that speed demon won't be a problem.
---
The benefit to scrap that can't be bulked is that they can be sold to the vendor I think the list includes silver, gold, anticeptic, circuitry, crystal, fiberglass, asbestos.
---
To manage my stash weight I bulk everything and sell any excess over 10 bulk. Exceptions springs, adhesive, aluminum, plastic, lead, along with ballistic fiber, loose screws, black titanium scraps and fiber otpics
---
Speech 1
---
Some other thread here on Reddit. Search for Speed Demon. Someone checked it in combination with other speed perks and found no further increases we're possible.
---
That's free real estate! 
---
I have anxiety and am very quiet unless I know you well. I would rather use emojis and send a quick message. The only time I communicate with ppl at all is if I‚Äôm trying to help lower levels or at an event. Though there was one day and one griever that Made me realllly wish there was a middle finger emote. üòÅ 
---
just sent you a request
---
I would like it.  Right now I have to build a much larger footprint than needed because I leave an open space in the center of my house to plant crops in a protected area. 
---
It‚Äôd be nice if they balanced all the legendary perks, like junkies doing 40-60% more damage, depending on how many bad things you have
---
For some reason I was hoping it would work a bit more like lonesome road dlc and massively crank up everything there.
---
In wartime, yes. The flag on military in the US has been advancing because of 9/11
---
Funny but I have a serious mutation addiction. I just think it would be fun if I had to hide it.
---
LOL.  This has happened to me before while sleeping on the bags while AFK to the east of the station near the petrified corpse and nuka-cola machine.  I come back and I'm dead.  Eventually I finished Mayor For A Day and this doesn't happen anymore, but swamp itch is real.  Between rad-pustules and this, I eat disease cures like candy.
---
Additionally, it's people like you that are spreading misinformation. Passive mode does zero from stopping people damaging you. Passive mode is only so that you cannot initiate PVP or damage other players or camps with your weapons.  You just proved my point!
---
That's nowhere near Watoga
---
Yes, just one time though. After that the launcher will stay logged in few a long time (days/weeks).
---
Do the quests. They give access to plans. 
---
Yeah
---
It says YOU can repair weapons to 200% not, weapons gain 100% extra durability. I believe it will only auto repair to 100%
---
\--close
---
No, if you do that, the stash is then effectively unlimited. The stash cannot ever be shared across toons end of story. I'm not saying they shouldn't allow us to trade weapons and armor between toons, because I wholeheartedly want that. I just also realize that if they make the stash shared, then it immediately becomes infinite in size due to mules. Stopping people from being able to pick things up when encumbered isn't going to stop anything, then you just make a couple STR mules and boom now you've got 4000 stash instead of 1200. Besides 1200 stash shared between toons is tremendously high for someone who only runs one toon and **incredibly** insufficient for someone like me who runs 5. I don't like abusing systems so this would **really really** hurt me.
---
If you're looking for legendary gear and flux, Whitesprings and Prime are the only two places really worth the effort to nuke.
---
I've been to a ton of other nuke zones and they all pretty much suck.  They empty out, the mobs don't respawn, you have trouble getting nuke materials, etc.
---
Thats what you think....
---
Just wear a headset and yell at them, or signal to them with those stupid communication buttons. 
---
Thanks.  That is very helpful.^^
---
Only if you're buying items from a vendor. When selling to a vendor there's a hard limit of 25% value which you can reach with 11 Charisma + Hard Bargain 3 (with or without the grape mentats "better barter rates" effect). So you can hit the sell limit at 6 Charisma using grape mentats.
---
If you're buying, however, the hard limit is 175% of an item's value. At 15 Charisma with Hard Bargain 3, you get 176% value buying from vendors. So I believe the hard limit is achieved at 16 Charisma + Hard Bargain 3, with or without the grape mentats extra effect.
---
I tested all of this with halloween outfits (200 cap value). I could never sell them for more than 50 caps, and never buy them back for less than 350. I got myself up to 21 Charisma using Unyielding armor and stopped seeing increases past 17ish charisma.
---
Yeah similar story here. It was crazy bad before that hotfix for me (I'm on PC), and now it's only every hour or so. But, in this most recent build, I've still DCd on 4 of the 5 SBQ fights that I've attempted (just realized my 80% was exact, lol). 
---
I also feel like its on a server to server basis. The ones I DC from will be a bit choppier even before the fight, whereas the ones that are running smoothly before the fight, I've noticed, are less likely to DC me. I think it's that the server is already unstable and the SBQ just breaks the camel's back. I think that's why my instincts told me not to go. 
---
It is my first time! Thank you!
---
I think this bug is caused by the random encounters over lapping. I was server hopping for the encounter to get the Halloween costume plans, and I noticed that both a deathclaw nest and a dead merchant could appear. And every now and then they're both appear and in those cases the dead deathclaw would be a merchant.
---
What mod did you use to see sleeping animations?
---
The forbidden cake...
---
Yep, you're boiling the feces out of it anyway when you're cooking. The same applies to the restaurant industry in real life, purified water is for drinking, poop water is for cooking.
---
I think I'll pass. It'd ruin the immersion for me. 
---
I can understand that to an extent. I have alot of anxiety issues too (especially social), but communication with strangers on the internet shouldn't be as terrifying as real life scenarios. In fact I think it could be used to train yourself for real life social situations. Is it a problem with the community within the game? How in game situations play out? Or just not having enough value to be worth using?
---
But bulked scrap can be sold to a vendor too. So that makes no sense. 
---
I like bulking because it gives me a much clearer idea of how much of each item I have. Plus on the go you can just grab some out of stash to sell.
---
Not everything that doesnt bulk can be sold either. 
---
bethesda games are very dependant for ram. 
---
the benchmarks are with the 3gb version of the 1060  ?
---
anyway you should run fin at medium with that setup, but ryzen seems to have some issues atm
---
getting one shot, probably bobbleheads.  
---
Getting ganbanged by 5 TSE's and not one shot but rapidly losing health?  Probably NOT bobbleheads.  
---
Slap damage iirc is 1%, but if you have 5 guys with 1k+ damage per shot weapons that's 50 damage per shot if all 5 hit.  TSE's can easily surpass 1k damage, and player base health is only 250 before endurance and other effects.  
---
So moral of the story in the op's situation it's 100% possible 5 completely legit players were killing other players with slap damage alone.
---
There is a nuclear holotape. You can load it up to see if any silos are available. 
---
Pacifist does not prevent you taking slap damage.  If enough people hit you fast enough your going down.  I've also been killed at vendors for one dude with a fast melee, maybe 30 sec TTK.
---
dont nuke whitesprings train station pls if you nuke whitesprings, my camp is thete haha
---
Hope it helps. üòä
---
This guy was fighting me, and I could only assume he was also on the toilet, as he was struggling...
---
I play because I have a good time. The online trading is a ton of fun, and just the ability to play a fallout Co-op with my brother has been extravagant.
---
I also run into (apparently) only about 1% of all the bugs and glitches people talk about so it has been a great experience.
---
Not much to do endgame tbh but what games actually have any good endgames anymore?
---
Doesn't fireproof prevent this now?
---
It's true, you could make some STR mules, but right now an alt account is unlimited storage for $34.  The STR mules would be limited by the number of characters you can make.  I don't know what that cap is.  I also think plans knowledge should be common among tunes.  I hate trying to remember which toon has what recipe.
---
No shit. Where did I say anything about the amount produced in a given time changes from machine to machine? Nowhere. I said 6 industrial purifiers produce enough in a 3min time span to play the game for hours, I never said having more machines equals more water per machine so yeah learn to read. Yes clearly the more machines the more water per hour duh. 
---
Stingy is stock piling and locking, not grabbing 3-5 waters and heading off. The people taking all of your shit are the stingy ones. I grab what I need for the short trip and head off. You need all that water to craft then use it, nobody said not to. Nobody even said not to lock your shit up, just that I would come destroy it if it was. Lol water police. That actually did make me smile. 
---
Friend of mine on xbox invited me to trade with his mule a couple weeks back.  Asked me what I wanted.  Had about every TSE weapon imagineable and each was in a stack (so same item, same durability)... in quantities of 20k to 92k of each.  
---
92-fucking-thousand.  So no, they arent low balling it.  Why?  Because everyone else is shitting out TSE handmades etc. faster than the USSR during the cold war.
---
Honestly I barely play and hate duping.  Hope they just start a new server game mode where we can start over once they fix duping.  Otherwise I won't trade shit with anyone.
---
"Tried". I think we might and different definitions of that word. 
---
Great job. Looks awesome!
---
It's a daily quest that starts in the basement of a house in Monaghan. I usually see it pop up when I'm there capturing the workshop for those sweet fusion cores. It'll show in your miscellaneous as "investigate the house"
---
Plants?
---
Game "jounalism" is utter garbage. Speaking as a former managing editor for a Curse gaming subsidiary.
---
Pretty sure because it's because it's built around the concept of people role playing raiders, not balanced pvp.
---
do you think it's better to go from 8gb to 16gb?
---
He breathes through his dick.
---
That article talked mostly about upcoming changes for the game. You don‚Äôt have to play it to inform people of what the devs are saying.
---
He may have been extra critical on the ‚Äúvery buggy game‚Äù part, but he‚Äôs technically not wrong. 
---
I also suggested this. But a point emote, then combo it with the puke emote would be nice. Theres just too many aholes, like the selfish people who solo kill a 3 star legendary.
---
I play it bc I just like it. I'm the kind of Fallout player who forgets about the main quest or whatever quest bc I get lost exploring the world. 76 looks amazing so yeah... 
---
Also it's multiplayer so I can play with my sister. We both love Fallout. Even tho it's a multiplayer the servers are not too crowded if you feel like being alone.
---
Yes it's whit the 3gb version.
---
I run It at low- medium and the game run very bad 
---
Nah lol you are assuming way too much shit to fit your narrative. The amount of damage for tagging could just stay the way it is, and they could not allow below 50's to participate in the event, seeing as they have no need for the event until 50+ anyway.
---
he spawns right next to the barn by the charleston train station. By next to I mean in between the barn and the little lake. It's just a rare spawn because there are like 15 other things that can potentially be there, including nothing, and there will be no encounter there if a player built their camp in the area. It just so happens that being next to a vendor and having a fresh source of water makes it a popular camp spot for low levels
---
Depends on which head ;)
---
And I still cant finish those quests, since you supposed to go back at some point, but the mire quests the precedes that with the motors are still broken. But, there are still areas where lv 5 &amp; 6 are the max. Mainly the forest, following the road from the overseer's camp to the NW corner of the map.
---
Thanks for the help. 
---
it will be much better. and dual channel is very important for open world games. 
---
Well the explanation ive seen for that kind of makes sense. You're hundreds of years away, which means your several generations out from people who lived pre war and excluding frozen vault dwellers, everyone you'll encounter in game has likely lived in this "filth" their entire lives. And doesnt even realize cleaning is a thing, or that things can even be clean.
---
Not that Ive encountered.
---
They take explosive damage because the explosion is triggered in their hit box, damage is based on the gun. 
---
They dont take less damage just because you do. Thats how they kill themselves at close range. 
---
Hell yeah.  It's what I miss second most in my low level alt. Obviously Marsupial is first.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I mean, if you imagine that all players with TSE weapons are player characters of single player fallout games, and everyone without ones and/or without the right armor legendaries are NPC raiders, its pretty accurate.
---
That's why Blackwater Mine is a popular site. There is a Decontamination shower inside just a bit from where the irradiated water is.  You can use it to lower the rads
---
2019  Dear Bethesda,  
---
please add:  
---
Plan: boiled water
---
* purified water
---
* nuclear material
---
* wood
---
I feel the same way, but what I understand from people I know who play almost exclusively in groups (rather than as Lone Wanderers), is that the silly and utterly pointless items are oddly important in a group--they add something to the experience in a way that can't be replicated in single-player, and so is hard to understand if you play mostly on your own. I can imagine it going something like this:
---
Lone Wanderer: A clown outfit for $10? Why? Pass.
---
Group Player: A clown suit? Too funny--wait until the guys see me in this; it'll be meme-worthy! Well worth $10.
---
I am searching for those too, i a have warehouse plan  for sale aswell
---
Please dont post this dumb shit to this Reddit
---
No wonder why I enjoyed it so much
---
There's no maybe:
---
* Slap damage is 1% of total damage (iirc).  
---
* Explosive shotguns can easily hit 2k+ per shot 
---
* So that's 20 slap damage per shot.  
---
* Base player health before endurance or other effects is 250 
---
OP said there was 5 guys teaming up, so do the math.  Slap damage can absolutely kill players pretty efficiently at this time, though the upcoming nerf to explosive mainly and 2 shot very much so secondarily will mitigate this.  
---
It's only available as part of a daily quest that starts in Monaghan. It'll show up in your miscellaneous when you're nearby as "investigate the house." You dont get to keep the syringer, but you can do it over and over, it'll send you to shoot three random creatures each time. Turn those in along with the syringer, the quest completes but asks you if you'd like to continue the research, so you can keep doing that.
---
With the upcoming nerf, I would try to trade for a bloodied explosive variant asap
---
Bro I know its needed but why not use one post to have the majority of upvotes, not 10 a day with 12 upvotes. 
---
Gtfo with that shit.
---
Yeah, get green thumb and go pick Flora. 
---
you sure they were TSE's and not just explosive shotguns?
---
Found it, but i swear i couldnt see it before. Im lvl 23 now. If someone is wanted or attacks me first, does this allow me to retaliate?
---
I mini nuke assaultrons all the time, just keep your distance 
---
LOL.  I could see this being a niche fan fiction genre.
---
Go to Charleston station. Cross the red bridge. Go back toward Charleston station. This should create the spawn. If you see vendorbot, Brahmin, or eyebot guard‚Äîthen you‚Äôve found the rare vendor. If you don‚Äôt see him or his crew, leave world. Rinse. Repeat. It can take a while.

Took a quick video for you - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRv1xDz1vXQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRv1xDz1vXQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I'm gonna stick with the lever action plan for my example here. If a fresh level 1 decides to drop $100 on atoms, and buys the lever action plan all they have done is unlocked a plan for later. They can't craft the lever action until level 25, regardless of how the acquired the plan. This provides no pay to win scenario as even at level 25, the player has little to no advantage over another because they still need mats to craft it, and they wont have any craftable mods unlocked for the weapon. I bought the plan with caps at around level 16-20, and just started at until 25.
---
For weapons mods, it doesnt have to be specific craftable plans that you pick or choose. It just unlocks a random feature such as long barrel, or hardened receiver for the lever action in question. Lever actions are a good example here, because I've found maybe 2-3 in my entire playthrough so I want to try and unlock the hardened receiver or a suppressor i have to make a whole new rifle, just to scrap it.
---
Same goes for 10mm subs and submachine guns, i have very little mods available for either of these weapons just because they dont spawn very often. They're not rare weapons any means, they are not special. They are only hard to come by because enemies dont carry the 3 I mentioned, and it's up to world spawns and chests just to break them down. 
---
Once again, I'm not referring to TSE mods that you drop in. I'm not talking about legendary mods/effects that can only be found in the atom shop. I'm talking about Plans that are 100% available in game, and our 100% guaranteed to be found in game. Ya'll either are not reading, or are misunderstanding. All this does is eliminate an unnecessary grind, which is what all MMOs use a shop to skip. We earn the atoms, if you decide to use yours to buy a skin more power to you. If you want to spend it on hair, or emotes whatever cool. For a player that doesn't care about cosmetics or camp items the atoms are useless. If you want Beth to keep adding content, the cash shop needs to have incentives for every type of player. For crafters this is an appropriate bargain to encourage spending. Which generates free dlc for us all to enjoy.
---
Also, isn't trading from a player the same as taking from a corpse? One is just consensual.
---
Awesome
---
I just had a thought. you could pull up the map of all the power armor locations, typically each frame has a fusion core. Couple that with the locations where fusion cores are available out in the open you can end up with a bunch. (The game repeatedly crashed for me while doing the maiden of mysteries questline and in the their supply area I kept coming across a fusion core in the same spot - without trying I ended up with 3 fusion cores.) 
---
Insult to injury would be what the other people suggested which is grabbing the workshops.
---
On top of which a full sell run hitting up all 7 faction vendors at 200 caps each is 1400 caps. Fusion cores sold at the Enclave vendor last I checked was like 200-300 caps which I feel is cheaper than using flux to creaft a fusion core. 
---
Does anyone here have the ammo search perk? Does it ever net fusion cores? I use "can do" and "farma pharma" religiously and I wasn't sure if it was worth picking up.
---
It's best to do that at around level 50 so you get the best version of All Rise.
---
Same i kill those robots like bending coca cola, cans.. 
---
Considering yellowcake is literal uranium not really
---
Or, you could just not make a shitty system like that and do what I said. Allow weapons and armor to be shared and make the stash for mats and individual to each toon. 
---
On one hand I agree for the plans/recipes for each toon and on the other hand I disagree. I see it both ways, I've put a **lot** of effort into getting camp decorations for two of my 5 toons and that makes each of their camps special and unique to me. On the other hand, I hate not being able to mod shotguns on my newest toon even though all 4 of my other toons have most if not all shotgun mods.
---
Thanks! It's the first time I've spent more than 5 minutes building my CAMP. I'm missing a lot of Plans I didn't realize, so now I want to hunt them down and expand it.
---
Yeah was never told about what quests give best rewards, ended up getting it at 30 unfortunately, but have a decent light weight pole hook... same exact thing happened with the mistress of mystery quests. 
---
Block them
---
On top of that how about we get a sink too? Bathtub: Check, Toilet: Check, Bathroom mirror: Check, "Employees Must Wash Hands" sign: Double check, A sink to complete this scene: Nope. 
---
Oh man... Not good. Haven't had that happen. Hopefully you find a fix!

Get rid of the SLAP system and this game would be great.

How do you know if an outfit is clean? 
---
Nah dude you're making excuses. 
---
Won't fix how utterly broken it is, and beings how ammo is do easy to come upon ie from dupers I'm sure most people wouldn't care

This is a great idea! I think it would be hilarious!

Click bait plain and simple unfourtunately your now driving traffic to this article

It came up randomly in a train station vendor yesterday. An hour later i got a hunters grognaks axe too.
---
My understanding was that ghouls were *also* healed by radiation.
---
Exterminators wreaths a mirelurk queen
---
You know you have won when they start mimicing you.
---
So we have to assume they will unlock more stars within legendaries at some point 
---
Isn't the trouble that radiation also heals them, so they gain more hp from radiation than they lose?
---
Chose one: mathesda or bethesdatica
---
Now just watch out for other players that want to play bug bad wolf. A good tip is blueprint it and if someone or something does tear it apart you can set it down with only the cost of a few caps. Great job BTW! My camp is currently two shacks one is beds and instruments and the other is workbenches. 
---
I take no damage until my ap runs out, which it doesn't. I use all of that but not serendipity
---
Way to go above and beyond lol, thank you!
---
As a trader I refuse to stock this item as it is downright irresponsible to sell to anyone. Anyone who would sell it is an asshole. 
---
You can craft the weapons you got from The Mistress quests at higher levels after. Up to level 45. Too bad other quest rewards don‚Äôt let you do the same.
---
So as a result of not liking it, you post it here and people go to read it which gives them clicks and results in more articles like it.
---
I get wanting to share something you don't agree with but for articles like this, and the useless YouTube videos (not all are useless but a lot are), ignoring them and not clicking or doing things that bring them more traffic is the best way to go.
---
Whether someone clicks because they like or hate the content, it is still revenue and will encourage more trash and lazy content.
---
The weapons/outfit from Mistress of Mystery line are upgradeable via crafting. That's assuming you kept them around.
---
Maybe i can try to find it in the world
---
Oh shit, thanks!

Nope sorry didn't realize at first you said tool chest haha, though I've seen people say pleasant valley ski vendor might have it

Bro I just finished doing the same thing! Even brought the wife into it and she was more excited of the decorations then I was lol. Used up all my material and all my budget and still not finished. Lack of plans had a big factor in the matter also. Oh did I mention the wife is high maintenance so I sure used up all my 5k atoms on decorations lol. She even put a room in for the kids lol. Anyways, I put about an hour into my camp and hands down yours looks better! Definitely going to be stealing your living room ha!
---
Anything to help &lt;3
---
Furious weapons work great too.
---
....I know that, that wasnt my question at all
---
There is no correlation, the commentor has a victimhood complex. 
---
Well i think yes, but with all these duped guns is like you are trading for a fac simile
---
What I'm getting at is that there are probably multiple worlds per server, with each world housing 24 players.  If several worlds in a specific server start 'holding' a spot open for us to rejoin after we've been d/c'd or simply left, then other players just joining will be pushed into new worlds, potentially in other servers.  If we then decide not to rejoin after all, it may mean that those players that just joined were pushed into a sub-optimal server, from a distribution perspective.   In effect it may lead to unnecessary load on random servers, which would likely in turn effect every world it hosted.   Because most of us play for extended periods of time when we do join, the distribution across each server has the potential to further deteriorate.    
---
Each world may try to keep 24 players at all time, but the total population of players also needs to be distributed evenly across all available servers.  That's the issue I'm saying they might need to address.  
---
And of course this is pure speculation.  I'm actually a comp physics and data scientist, and while that does mean that I'm a programmer, my skills are focused and very narrow.  I could just naively be inventing a problem Bethesda doesn't actually have.  
---
I forgot that lore, thx.
---
I agree with basically everything except scavenger, but that‚Äôs just me not liking tedious‚Äúfind‚Äù mechanics
---
EPA has an innate 100+ carry weight not even counting calibrated shocks when wearing the set, or at least the two leg pieces, not sure which.

If you use X01. the repairs require black titanium. I eventually broke down and built east of harper's ferry for that titainum node just for this reason. If you're on xbox1 and you see my name pop up. feel free to come by my base and take it from the extractor since stops pulling once it gets to 10 ore.
---
"I need to get it to a stage where I can use it" makes it seem like you have ore and not scrap. It takes 3 ore at a chemistry station under smelting to create titanium scrap to be usable.
---
I completely agree with you but I was more pointing out how funny the wording is.
---
I scrapped or sold my green bandana. I feel so naked without it. The Camo one just isn‚Äôt the same. I feel ya. 
---
Easy solution, open friends list, go to recent, and block the player for this session. Makes you invisible on the map to them.
---
Cool, thanks man
---
Looks pretty good! If you ever want tips or ideas, check out norespawns on YouTube. He's my main inspiration 
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/norespawns1
---
I feel the whisper of intentional and fundamental game design.
---
Sometimes you get 3 outfits spawning in the room the vendor is in.
---
And even if it was a plan available at level 1, this wouldn't remove the restrictions imposed by science expert, gunsmith, armorsmith etc. Or the time needed to gather materials to craft said item. This is not a pay to win scenario regardless of how you try to spin it.
---
These are some killer puns.... Ik that was bad sorry
---
How do you know if an outfit is clean?
---
Do they really? I haven't tried cause they cap out at +30%.
---
Xbox
---
Same here. Even having trouble relaunching. After a crash, it takes a couple times of booting the game for it to get me in a server without freezing on the loading screen. 
---
Overdrive got nerfed... or they unintentionally changed as the patch notes differ from in game.   
---
Anti Armor 50 cals will be the next go to for sure, furious seems to have a hard cap on damage output as I dumped 250 rounds into her belly never missing and it was pitiful in comparison to a anti armor or a straight 2 shot. 
---
That won't fix anything. TSE is still in a good spot after the need, I really don't get the drama over it.
---
Good question, it will just simply say clean within the name, either at the beginning or the end of it üëç
---
i read that as battle.net and was like y wuld u need battle.net deets and then realized u meant bethesda, dawg, maybe you should avoid BNET acronym, Lol
---
Nice! 
---
Thanks for the advice, hopefully mine is far enough in the boonies no one will come for it.
---
Mmmmm, uranium.
---
I agree. The music is one of the best things about the atomic shop  
---
Er... after some wiki combing to double-check, there doesn't actually appear to be a "pistol grip" for a double-barreled shotgun, and the sawn-off barrel weighs less than the full barrel.
---
Also overdrive got nerfed for most, but for my build it was actually a buff because 1/2-2/3rds of my shots are already crits. I carry around about 130 of them atm lol
---
Furious caps at 30%.
---
Awesome, thanks! I'll definitely look into him.
---
Ahhh okay, I saw a post about this a couple days ago on here. I haven‚Äôt done this yet. Thanks!
---
You know the answer... Do they explode?

I love it!

Can't remember how much offhand, but straight jackets from the asylum sell for a pretty decent price.

There‚Äôs video proof that you cannot be one shot with any amount of glitched damage.

The guy‚Äôs weapon does 240k damage but still only does 5 HP max on a non flagged opponent. There‚Äôs lots of misinformation out there about this.

That would be enough of a reason for me to get a mic

This just happened to me last night; I wasn't aware of this. I've used two assaultron heads since beta and didn't have an issue and didn't suspect there would be a problem using it a third time. Lost about 1k cells and was baffled. Party member asked if I knew about the bug......... 
---
I haven't tried looting them since the B.E.T.A. because i never got anything from them but rads. ;\\ 
---
Congrats? I'm not very high level and the best weapon I've got is a silenced hunting rifle. I do pretty good damage if nothing notices me but Assaultron's seem to have a roadmap to my ass.
---
(PS4) Crashed once last night. Down from the usual 3-4 times. Next patch i'm willing to bet it will spike back up. 
---
Why the bloody modifier?
---
Yeah thats my worry as well. I assume the bobblehead issue will be fixed, give them time, they trying to catch up and keep the game alive at the same time.
---
My hope is they will make changes to the pve servers and well, not sure what, but at least a real passive mode where people can't be killed at all if they have it on .. i am doubtful but that is what we need.
---
There is the glow sight, and iron sights
---
So THIS is what happened to the dev team after the bombs fell.
---
I‚Äôve got one with my character sitting on the floor behind a rock hiding from a (dead) scorched beasts sonic blast üòÇ if anybody wants to explain how I can show it on here I‚Äôm happy to! 
---
He also spawns just west of Lady Janet's Soft Serve, just past the tipped bus on the road.
---
Lady Janet's is located in north west corner just east of the ferris wheel on the map.
---
Nope, no fancy sights.
---
try uranium fever evet. 
---
Thanks! I really appreciate it 
---
I've asked for this since fallout 3, prob ain't gonna happen
---
Lots of outrage surrounding 76, they might just want to avoid putting more fuel to the fire at this point. 
---
What set are those floors apart of?? 
---
Same for me. I spent over an hour trying to change options and tweak my pc settings but I'm pretty sure it's on Bethesda's end.
---
I guess he technically could still be right, if the ghouls slowly lose their health bar to radiation damage. The question I suppose is can they heal radiation 
---
Yeah definitely, we need that!
---
The only thing I found so far that I wanted to spend Atoms on was the camouflage power armor paint. And it does look pretty bad-ass.
---
 So with my gatlin gun anti armor i can kill them easly?
---
 How am i dumb? I see the reply that it isn't 1 for 1 sale and that the vendors don't get all the money. But why?
---
Has anyone found out what happened to the missing money?
---
I'd up vote a million times if I could
---
yeh im on a beast gaming rig with a 1080ti , and I hard crash like every 30 min or so since the last patch ....I do use 2 mods(betterinventory/knownrecipes) but i also unloaded the mods and played....still the same ...even on pure vanilla ...game pause for a second and boots to desktop ... load back in ...get 20-30 mins played and hits again ...

Bulking is mostly about caps, not weight. It‚Äôs added to goods that would sell for less than one cap each. 10 cloth gets you 8 caps or whatever.
---
For screws and other goods that sell for 1 cap apiece, wouldn‚Äôt bulking just eat up plastic you could otherwise have sold or used?
---
I haven't tried. Please try and let me know the results. My guess would say no, because this probably works best with revolvers and rifles, but I'd like to know for my guild.
---
Right by the overseers camp
---
Yeah, his name was probably Chuck. 
---
Nope. A surprise Assaultron sneaking up on you and blowing yourself up can easily kill **you** though, so take it easy and run away when needed.
---
I've wanted this from day one. I wish I could use it when the server disconnects.
---
Ill have a look and see if I can figure it out never tried before 
---
The music is the best thing in the atom shop.

The fact that it's called the Torrance house supports your theory ;)

I bought the Rocketsuit not knowing its gender specific. I play in first person most of the time... you can imagine how I found out this was gender specific...

Every time I fast travel to Harper‚Äôs ferry my view is just a black screen with my bud. No other city does it to me just Harper‚Äôs ferry. I‚Äôll have to back out of the game and restart it to fix it.

Yeah. I am used to either backing up to fire my TSE or swapping to .y Grognak
---
Heavy weapons build?
---
What am I going to do with them all?! Haha also I have so many Mr handy buzz blade plans from the silos idk what to do with them
---
I see twinkies.... 
---
Turn down shadows. All the way. You‚Äôll get 20-40 more FPS
---
that's not correct. there was a nice proof video of a dude with 300K sheet damage (stacked explosive bobbleheads) and two shot explosive shotgun and it was just barely chipping other player HP. that oneshot stuff was made up. if any, it's flat 5 damage before armor, so it's probably just a single damage. 
---
But, it's per hit basis, so if you have a team and fast fire rate, this all adds up, even the litte slap damage.
---
Good luck surviving a pvp battle long enough for that to matter lol. 
---
Say what you will 1k treasure maps let alone a specific one makes you look guilty of being a part of duping and honestly I think your one or involved with one
---
Yes, I have a friend that uses heavy weapons and he's gonna get hit hard by the TSE nerf. 
---
&gt; Step 1 - Don't plant your base on a fissure site....lol
---
I didnt, yet mine was attacked by one of these flying beast as well...
---
You should try to do the daily challenges when you can, they're quick and easy usually. Weeklies are a pain sometimes. I've gotten about 5k atoms since I've been playing. It's not enough to buy anything I want but it's enough to buy a few RP aesthetics
---
Cool, serious, and bad ass all cost too much money to make it has to make sense with the lore or aesthetic or the effect is lost. It's much better for profit margins to churn out wacky stuff and charge serious prices for it. Also it's low effort like the rest of 76
---
I am on 2nd char as well, a heavy gunner.  I hit lvl35 this morn.
---
I am done with all the quests except Taggerdy and Mayor for Day (picked up the latter his morn).   None of the quests have given anything worthwhile and the xp has been a paltry joke.

My gameplay revolves around ammo.  Basically can't keep enough 5mm to get anything done :(  For everything I do, I have to spend twice that time trying to get acid.

This is a bug they've known about since November tho
---
Holy moley.
---
I have about 15 plans of them in my storage. 
---
Yup I probably wouldn't even play if I didn't have marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction and bird bones
---
That's Gayplay thing (get it?)
---
Im not trying to spin anything, you are asking to be able to benefit your character, to cut out some of the game, using a currency that is available to be brought with real money.  
---
If you couldnt buy atoms with real money, it wouldnt be pay to win, it would be play to win, but that fact that a bonus would be purchasable with real money makes it pay to win
---
The T-51 is probably the closest end game power armor to have what you want. It's got a number of scrapes and rust pockmarks in it.. My Blackbird paint doesn't cover it up, which is kinda sad because I kinda wanted it to.
---
Im so annoyed he also proceeded to rub my nose in it as he has watched me try and fail before 
---
And are they heavy :)
---
Ironically, rifles are pretty heavy too....
---
PA sets your str to 11.

Unarmed weapons can't be used in PA, like death Tambo, power first, mole gauntlet, knuckles, etc
---
Well I just ‚Äúdropped‚Äù my first one to avoid this bug and now I have none.  Dropped it and no bag or ignition core on the ground.  Wtf?!
---
&gt; They might make a weapons/armor bank like borderlands 2 where you can put a limited number of items in it to share across toons
---
I'm ok with this too...anything to allow me to transfer even a few items between chars.
---
Yeah. I claimed the Posiden workshop 3 times, farming Fusion cores and had 4 Extractors running. All 3 times the server crashed an I lost everything. At least I got 30 Fusion cores saved.

One of the wikis says the gatling plasma and gatling laser are not heavy weapons...

Nice build, I think maybe people build too big and with a small budget hard to fill it up .Even a small house might be tricky to fill up.
---
Damn, my b on the suggested location! That‚Äôs disappointing!

During multiple logins I've been spawned into the world and not been able to move, draw weapons or do anything but stand there. This only started occuring after the latest update this week. It's becoming more and more frequent as I login. Any one else having this problem? 
---
Well the point is to kill them before they go super saiyan 2.
---
It's checks and balances. 
---
The cost of failure is an even tougher enemy.
---
That's the only plans you got from both the kill and event?
---
This is spot on! Last night for the first time I joined a fight on a scorch beast queen. After about 15 minutes of attacking her and all the other creatures that come with it, blue screen of death!! PS4 PRO. Could I find the server no, could I get my just rewards for going through about 20 stimpacks no a blooming chance!!
---
So what happened? I joined a server on my own with a way to difficult scorch beast, no stim packs and over encumbered, it was a nightmare trying to get to the station! Just getting battered over and over again!
---
So please let us join the last server!!
---
Plus I'm about if 42 so if anyone wants to join a team hit me up :sweetdeal2010
---
Right? I'd be stoked if I could transfer the few nice weapons I find for each toon I have between them. I don't want or need some crazy shared stash space that's easily abusable. I just want to give my pistol guy the nice pistols I find and my heavy weapons guy the nice gatling guns and 50 cals I get.
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_weapons](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons)
---
Scroll down to "Explosives" - "Heavy Weapons"
---
Any heavy weapon not in that category is a "heavy non-explosive weapon," except possibly the Broadsider, which shoots exploding projectiles.
---
I don't think you do get that the cost is subsidized.
---
How are you getting nearly unlimited? Even if you have the maximum character limit of 5 that only gives you 3000. And that's only if you moved the items out of the shared stash tab. If you don't and you filled it up to the 600 then that's only 600 stash for all 5 characters. 
---
They should make items in the item shop available for cash only and have it at a much lower price than the equivalent atom price. 
---
The daily‚Äôs are 50 atoms a day. Then doing the weekly you get around 100-150 I think. That‚Äôs around 650 a week, sounds pretty good to me
---
Seriously annoying. I hate looping back 3 times because I accidentally passed 0
---
sure.  i think i ran through the whole thing 3-4 times with different team mates.  lol.  and if you get there and the doors open certain plans/clothing may have already been looted and you'll have to switch servers to try again.  but getting that key is the real tedious part. 
---
To be fair, I think a lot of the CAMP assets are really cool and high quality. I love the new Quantum and Old Possum signs for example. But I agree that offerings for the player character are a collection of bizzare garbage. You have to pay Atoms for stupid haircuts and *fucking forehead tattoos* that are recycled assets from Fallout 4. All that I ask is for some armor paints that aren't tye-dye eyesores, redneck swamp camo, or a toy robot power armor skin that was rendered in Paint.
---
Well, keep in mind I only have so much time to play, doing all the daily‚Äôs and the weekly just doesn‚Äôt happen often enough for a casual player like myself 
---
And also show all the effects of legendaries and not just one in trade
---
I find aiming for the limbs of all boys is the most effective way to kill em. With assaultrons I always go for the legs.
---
But this doesn‚Äôt explain other things not tracking
---
Same on the wall paper
---
But if all the pink shit don't pop up for Valentine's day I'm going to be so annoyed
---
I NEED that pink pipgirl üòâ
---
Ive been farming crystal and silver at a workshop and when I pick it up, it's not staying in my inventory when I go to put it away! I know it's not the exact same but if anyone has any tips please let me know
---
Don‚Äôt forget mouthfeel.  And umami!
---
I did that last night but it wasn‚Äôt you I was doing it to as I‚Äôm just at 80. I wear the straight jacket and either the reaper mask or the mask with the big nose and spooky smile. 
---
Found a group of 3 in flatwoods, all low teens in level, and with my mutations I just followed them around via the rooftops. Chameleon armor, and sneak to an outside window of a house they we‚Äôre in. Got some good reactions. Shut doors on em, shoot a flare in a window, just general shenanigans. Lol. 
---
Vats is the trick.
---
Overdrive outright buffed vats.
---
I run nekkid in my hazmat suit vats critting her for solid damage.
---
Yeah, so far I've had mirelurks by the doors, and both ghouls and mutants from the hotel.
---
Yeah I am working towards this.....I do want it. I even considered buying the atoms for a micro second...but decided I have plenty of time to farm the 120 atoms I need for it
---
Because you just need 1 toon and to keep the shit on that toon. One toon can carry an infinite amount of shit, not in their stash but **on** them.
---
Also I didn't say nearly unlimited, I said **actually** unlimited.
---
How is it not enough to buy anything you want? Nothing cost more than 5k, right? PA paints are like 1800?
---
If someone attacks you, you will have to go through all those steps to turn pacifist off before you can attackh them back.
---
This is the comment I'm seeing more often around here 
---
Never had a shortage of atoms I'm sitting round 7k never bought any actually bout to buy the old opossum beer sign. Atom shop is fine.
---
True, I'll be honest I've had a similar issue with other challenges too. I was just saying the possible reason for the wood one.
---
The cans you find in the world have lead in them. Places with can traps are great for getting lead as is the firehouse weight room. 
---
Looks like the game has managed to get even buggier than when I originally played.
---
I hear ya, I‚Äôm actually gonna test your theory rn update in a few
---
Lol so they take as much rad damage as a player in a hazmat suit.  &lt;1 on each hit
---
lol.  you know i switched pip views and dont look at it so its color hasn't bothered me much.  i wish i could just paint pink, black, purple, chrome whatever.  
---
have you noticed you cant change your eyeshadow color?  im on xbox and started with yellow eyeshadow.  ive gone in and tried to change it but it never actually changes.  ive changed hair color/styles and other visual things but the eyeshadow is still base color yellow.  i didnt put in a ticket because i figure it would get buried in other shit they need to fix.  
---
Teach men to respect wyman amirite?
---
Ghoulish and / or a quick firing Vampiric weapon have the same effect when running Rad sponge.
---
Unmodified furious gatling gun without perk cards pumped that out. 
---
The recoil is slim. The ammo count is high, and the fire rate gives you considerable control.
---
Large bullet sponges becoming a problem?
---
Learn how to make stuff more deader, accept no substitutes. 
---
Furious gatling gun. 
---
This happened to me as well.
---
Just like most forms of "journalism", the problem is an insightful article which gets into the technical aspects of the subject is usually overlooked by "casual" fans of the subject who aren't interested in how things work but rather read an opiniated article so they could see if their opinion matches/doesn't what they believe to be the opinion of the masses (the people that think "why else would someone write an article if they aren't looking for "sympathisers".)
---
I am a casual player too, I grind some points here and there. You can at least do daily‚Äôs in 10 mins of play, the weekly are a bit more time consuming. 
---
It seems to me that people just want stuff for free. Either not wanting to pay or not having time or wanting to grind. Has no one played any mmos where you legitimately needed to grind end game items anymore? And these are just cosmetics! You don‚Äôt even need them
---
Man I got rapped by a group of 100s last night and was furious lol. Took over the workshop i had been building up and then mocked me. (They had mic‚Äôs).
---
I came back to the workshop to talk and they were like ‚Äúyou are level 28 stand no chance... you can shoot me but you‚Äôre dead‚Äù.  
---
Now I wanna protect the low levels lol.. but I don‚Äôt stand a chance if they are level 50+
---
Yea but I use a fifty cal and murderizing all those super mutants rarely nets me a profit in steel.  I love my site though....so I just retire the .50 until I hit 10k ammo and I can reuse it
---
I‚Äôve definitely noticed more freezing since the patch but I‚Äôve only been disconnected like twice since so I‚Äôm mainly happen 
---
I don‚Äôt know it would be nice if you could sell to vendors. Honestly, I just drop the plans a low levels doors so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting them üòÇ
---
Level 1 is all you really need. Don't bother investing in any more of them. Just takes up until necessary points (unless they Nerf it at some point)
---
I like the buy all the camp stuff. Nuka cola quantum sign is more worth it that the old possum IMO. 
---
Without video, your situation seems like a one-off bug. Though I'm fairly sure the gun is strong. Furious only builds to +30%. Either that bar was counting other peoplea damage in your greyed out bar, or something bugged and stopped furious from capping. 
---
[For the uneducated.](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1446799-excuse-me-what-the-fuck)
---
I leveled to 50 then quested.
---
I won't do it again. The gear isn't that good, it unlocks plans and the xp is more useful when leveling.
---
Oh no I certainly agree this is getting a bit repetitive. 
---
I'm just living out of an empty 2 story shack now, apart from a bed and work benches. Waiting until I get other stuff unlocked before I try and build myself a nice house.
---
Perfect Storm, yes. In a crafting table it should show up to level it up, I think if you have it on you? Not many work this way, though.
---
You could trade for someone who has a bigger perfect storm but there is no game mechanic to level a weapon up. (*yet*)
---
Nah it's all good lol. Ever since I've gotten my TSE Handmade it takes about 10mins to launch a nuke, whatever helps the community. Not too worried about getting Whitesprings 24/7. I like messing around and having people thinking either wow cool a different spot, or why would he nuke here? 
---
Yeah, I was just thinking about this also.. I started a new character thought I could transfer items I found on my main.. was bummed that I couldn't 
---
This topic is very relevant for me, too 
---
This also happened to me a week ago, but the machine took all of the ammo I used for my gun. 
---
Since then, I double check everytime I transfer the stocks. I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt fix this already... :( 
---
I lost a load of ammo when I was putting ingredients into the machine, no idea why it lets you transfer non quest items into it.

During the quest "Prototypical Problems" when I load the siphon holotape into the Advanced research terminal nothing happens. This makes the quest incompletable. 
---
Because 100% more damage is the problem
---
good for everyone to know.  that kind of knowledge is what i come here for :)
---
i use Perfect Storm with a prime receiver/ultracite ammo in the nuke zones.  that an a 3* furious sledgehammer lvl 30 someone gave me in december.  
---
The people of this game have a very skewed representation of what PtW means. Buying a health/damage/speed boost that isn't available in game is PtW. Buying an OP weapon that isn't available in game is PtW. Buying OP armor that isn't available in game is PtW. 
---
Buying a plan, exp boost, and items (even crafting items) does not equate to a pay to win scenario. These items exist in game, they're available to earn without paying real money. This is a Play to win, or PTP (pay to progress). This is how free games, and games without subscription services make their money to keep servers up and add new content. This is a standard scenario for any/every MMO on the market, and a number of other gaming genres as well.
---
Make sure you're playing in fullscreen
---
I believe the pip boy damage factors in if ALL pellets land.
---
I really enjoy decorating and base building. It‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs given me a sense of progression in the game. A lot of the items are very expensive if you look at costs to flat out buy. I think the monetary value of an atom needs to be changed. 100 atoms to a dollar seems like a pretty poor trade IMO. 
---
I just meant I can't buy things willy nilly, otherwise I would be out of atoms
---
Welcome to the ‚Äúfeed the people took all of my ammo/armor‚Äù club :( 
---
I kill my self too much with TSE weapons.  I switched back to melee.
---
Have him try to do another cake!
---
I have not experienced that I have had it so when I pick back up harpoons they would go directly into the gun so I had like 80 shots without reloading and I find the damage over distance is kind of weird sometimes it‚Äôs nothing sometimes it‚Äôs massive 
---
Oh I see, what I said didn't read correctly. I meant to emphasize ANYTHING like that. Like I can't buy all the holiday bundles that they're probably already planning, but I can definitely get a few pieces that I want
---
Jumping servers no longer recharges them.
---
Why isn't this information more wide spread :(
---
Now that we have an official statement, they need to officially update the EULA to include this, make us agree again to continue playing, and I feel as though any issues going forward should be punished. They need to set the line in the sand and let it be known. This will also show they can be transparent with some things and stop using vague descriptions the community will continue to argue over. I imagine a majority of people will never see this post on their forums. People need to know about posts like this even if they don't have access to a web browser.
---
Yes i'm playing in fullscreen 
---
I'll try it again tonight and get video if I can. Probably hit or miss though (these events never go as planned)
---
I have 7 seconds of video but it doesnt do it any real justice. Camera didnt activate fast enough.
---
It's possible it was a fluke but idk why I would be able to see the damage others are pumping out.
---
Wow I thought my mouse was failing but the same things been happening to me..
---
Yea I was thinking this myself. Having 2 different currency‚Äôs so you don‚Äôt get boned if you want to spend money. 
---
It is, multiple posts a week about this.
---
Except no melee user is going to sprint straight at you except in cavalier assassin armor. Then it wont matter how many shitgun pellets you spray at them. They'll take NO damage. Same as I can take NO damage from a melee user smacking me ten minutes straight while I stand there with dodgy going combined with armor affixes.
---
It is quite frustrating when an author attempts to convey an informed opinion yet betrays themselves by explicitly outlining their ignorance when attempting to contextualize said opinion by discussing specific game mechanics in a laughably inaccurate manner.
---
I won't.
---
And you're right.
---
Except... The point of a *cash shop* is to make money for the company.
---
If me, you, and everyone else are not actually putting money into the cash shop... It's not a very good cash shop.
---
are you stupid or something ? 
---
I have never heard about it before
---
How do ghouls survive ground zero when they can‚Äôt survive a sharpened ski?
---
I stopped picking them off the queen when I had my 25th stashed away.   
---
Queen consistently drops me that and 1* Legendaries almost every time. 
---
Means it was damaged and required repairs. As for the budget the player must have had a lot of items stored.
---
They were destroyed. The outlines of destroyed objects appears in build mode.
---
And stop crying because the enemies are UP
---
HELP MEEEE!!!!
---
So here‚Äôs what I found, I was at 239/700. I went to a broken down tree (not chopped fire wood) and hit X to gather log. It said I got 4 wood from it and checked and I went from 239 to 240. So, I think it means you have to collect wood 700 times not collect 700 wood.
---
Roger. Didn't read that way to me. Didn't know if I was missing some super bundles or something. Thanks for the clarification
---
Do you plan on playing PVP? I don't see how this would matter to a pve player but maybe you're looking for an untainted PVP experience?
---
Ps4.  Crash two or three times.  Usually as I'm about to loot a legendary.  Or up in the very edge of the map at knife edge.  Stutter stopped about 20 min.   Then froze them kept going then froze.   And then crashed....there was no one around. 
---
Exactly. Same happened to my last weekend.
---
The white knight agility perk is a God send for armour repairing btw.
---
Not this extreme of a nerf though, in my opinion.
---
I'm still salty about missing the Blackbird PA skin. It was and still is the only good one
---
Nope. It's not gender keeping you understanding, just inexperience.
---
is the clown/machete combo a thing? When I went to my camp there was a clown wielding machete using my stuff. This was about a week ago and he was very nice and gave me some power armor and ‚Äújunk‚Äù. I forgot how to emote so I accidentally threw a Molotov at them lol
---
Well that's an intriguing way to count it.
---
Plus I have more lag and after logging in it takes ages until my camp spawns in or the wepaon in my hand.
---
When following sprinting people you can keep up with your AP not dropping. The faster reload animation for guns alone I think is worth it. If trying to unlock all points on map, bring along canned coffee and basically your sprint will outrun the aggroed enemies without having to stop. 
---
If you're on a loot specific run and you are familar with which boxes and spawn locations to check, then it cuts that time down by a lot. 
---
The food/drink thing will be noticable, but if you grab up all the glowig fungus along the river between the oversears camp and flatwoods, the soup will sustain you for the entire length of gamplay for the day.
---
(Shhhhhh.  Let them fix the real problems first.)
---
Yeah it is pretty Vague and says ‚Äúcollect wood‚Äù so collect (any amount) 700 times is the challenge. I wonder how many others are like that.
---
Just use all legendary gear lmao
---
Still not fixed

---
The best way to do drop trading without risking this is to just drop a .38 round, make sure the bag appeared on the ground, then interact with the bag and put the legendary in.  
---
You win.
---
I hate those darned leafy ghouls.
---
Thanks, I'll look at those.
---
Makes sense. I try to buy every plan I come across, but I'm missing a ton. I really want the electric doors and bureau plans.

I don‚Äôt get at first how it refers to Information Technology
---
Why would you spend real money  ? You can earn in game atoms for free if you patient .. 
---
I can one shot anything, non scorchbeast queen, without any two shot or explosive. And melee can one smack anything even scorchbeast queen with bobblehead help
---
They both actually pop out a little bit
---
*jumps into low orbit*
---
It happened to me right after the beta. RIP ammo.
---
In my experience the bar keeps tracking (greying out) until you have no hits for a couple seconds, I've done a quarter of the Queens life with a dagger when someone crippled and kept here down, before she "jumped" and broke the cycle.  
---
If this guy managed to keep the Gatling on track I can totally see that kind of damage, just wondering over how long it took.  
---
No waaay, i‚Äôm trying to get one since the first day of beta! üòç what a lucky guy!
---
RMT?
---
The only thing I bought was the Blackbrid PA skin and that is honestly the only coolest thing they released by far. I think Fallout really fell off from the POST APOCALYPTIC setting. The sense of dread and survival is gone from the franchise. It feels more...mainstream now for a lack of a better word. Compared to Metro and STALKER, Fallout feels more like a kids game nowadays.
---
You can get about 50 points every day doing Daily Challenges, and I think \~200 for the Weekly ones.  Most of the Dailies are pretty trivial too.  My Atom count has held pretty steady, in part because there really aren't too many interesting things in the store to begin with.
---
I know it. Unfortunately any stealth/pistol builds have a hard time shoving it into the already crowded agility pool.
---
The fun part is the 30 mins it takes to come back down.
---
Just wait until something strikes you.   They stage limited things so don‚Äôt buy right away.  
---
cavelier assassins gear is better than sentinel, anyone suggesting sentinel doesn‚Äôt know a thing about PvP 
---
I believe it is the number of connected hits too, i do notice two shot weapons break much faster than single shot variants
---
There is one already. It's bound to the caps-lock key by default.
---
This is why I eat people, because I keep getting power armor chunks in my canned food.
---
Yes.
---
I just give all my leftover plans to lower levels if I run into some
---
That's not the case. The only quest weapons and armor you can level up are the ones you craft as part of the quest.
---

I recommend squatting and if they have shutters at their camp you can open and close them from the roof. I like power landing in front of them in power armor when I leave and dropping 10mm with 1 round.  Just in case they want to....use it.  Then I start cackling over the Mic and closing in with an ax while jumping 
---
Junkie with an unyelding build is viable and pretty strong. You have tons of special anyway.
---
There is correlation. Perhaps you're not interesting enough to be the subject of such attentions as to have a perspective which finds the above scenario relatable.
---
I also have this hair colourüíñ
---
Don't be, most people are helpful.
---
YouTubers have actual incentive to join the bandwagon to dislike this game though.
---
Reviews in general for this game seem a bit skewed in favor of calling it a dumpster fire, and for clear reasons. But regardless. 
---
It's a survival lite that keeps you focused enough for consistent game play, but relaxed enough to play a YouTube video in the background as you play. The player interactions due to the limited pvp are generally positive, being either role players, chill dudes, or traders. Rarely are there dick heads.
---
Also, to be honest, it isn't the rockiest launch for a bethesda game I've seen. I've only played since 3, but the rage at new vegas's instability, and the rage at fo4s voice protagonist and shitty story, it just seems like every launch follows suit with this. Sometimes it feels like those two games, despite being strong games, whittled me down LOL. I got NV, and it straight yeeted itself and corrupted the saves I was using, so I never picked it up till years later. I got 4, and the story was so trivialized and boring, while having the gall to give me options and imply I had agency, when I was just there for the ride.
---
With 76, there are bugs but none that yeet my save, and the story doesn't tell me I'm the chosen one with impact on the world, I'm just a dude. Considering my go to mods for every fallout always begin with alternative start, this game just felt right to me, and it still does.

The log is a holotape in your inventory.
---
Truth, lower levels are so easy in PA.
---
Forgot to mention the following that I tried:
---
1. **Windows Visual Effects** adjusted for best performance, meaning everything turned off (e.g. Aero Peek etc). 
---
2. **Virtual Memory** set to custom size of min 8000mb - max 16000mb \[paging file size\].
---
F76 still crashes.
---
From Zap Brannigans big book o‚Äô war!
---
Hahaha!
---
Majority I‚Äôve seen will just check it out and maybe use a bench/stash box. As a low level a lot of higher ups are prone to give you their excess stuff, had several people drop off grenades/spare recipes etc. when I was starting and I try to do the same. If they nuke your stuff you can pick it up and resettle for next to nothing
---
Not sure but try to look in your pipboy and check for a holo tape

How can you tell a mule?

Perfect storm is a quest reward that is given at a level respective to your level at the time of completion. You can't craft it. You have to make a new character and complete the quest at a higher level.
---
I used to at lower levels as well. Now I'm finding it impossible to leave gifts for lower levels because they run away now that I've ranked up. I wish that there was maybe a small icon next to our names if we played only in pacifist or something so people wouldn't be afraid. 
---
Survival lite if anything. Staying alive is really easy.
---
Being able to jump high enough to... well suffer!
---
Ya your right heh i'm just internally paranoid i guess it's do to my inherint introvert
---
Just wait until level 100+ guys show up. Then be paranoid of their TSE shotguns and .50 cal LMGs. 
---
I mean, mechanically feral ghouls are immune to the instant mind control that turn some creatures into the scorched variant. Whether they're immune to the long term effects of the scorched plague I am not sure
---
Use common sense...
---
I feel like I see one of these posts every few days, "to the low level player I chased down, I was trying to give you stuff!" then the inevitable comment "they really need to put a gift emote!"
---
This is still bullshit IMO. Persistent servers, private servers. You‚Äôre blowing it on this devs.. I would purchase 3 copies tomorrow to send to my friends if you allowed us to live a persistent life on a/our server.
---
more flamingos
---
How about picking up more than one of the same type of undroppable key. I just stare at it in my pip boy mocking me. I often think about just deleting and starting over.
---
Floors are purchased in the atom shop. The one you're probably referring to is called astroturf.
---
yup
---
I ditched it.
---
Even on my rifle build that shoots alot it rarely activated.
---
And once you get rolling shooting tonnes to kill a single enemy should drop off.
---
I'm quite sure I levelled Perfect Storm up for my buddy, I'll have to double check.
---
I didn't find your response that bad, as a person that likes bethesda/fallout 76 regardless of if it's broken or not (I have 2 characters over 100) but this subreddit is very much a circlejerk, and if you hate on bethesda you're asking for downvotes here from what I've seen. The official fallout reddit would give you like 800 upvotes in comparison though if you hate on bethesda 
---
Resource gathering. That‚Äôs about it. People don‚Äôt use them to PvP much anymore. 
---
How does the gathering work?
---
You can claim the. For a small cap price and you can make extractors to get different materials other players and creatures will try to take it from you so you have to defend them
---
I had my camp there.  Swear to god I only got it 1 in 23 times a log on
---
I had two waiting outside my workshop. I was nervous...and then they gave me a full set of ultracite PA. 
---
Like most my encounters with higher level players it was positive. 
---
I wouldn't be concerned 
---
It requires a lot of screws and glue?
---
You might have modded it, but not changed its level.
---
Yeah i have only found the its a trap event once a while ago before i hit 50. I have yet to see it active again. 
---
Hate to say it but the server limits are there and really there for a reason..  And until Bethesda cleans up the system the limitations will remain.  
---
 **Background** 
---
I'm an old school MMO player and have "mule" accounts, I had to break up the number of things on my mules between another account because:  
---
-When the mule died, the Server crashed 100% of the time.  
---
-When anyone got too close to the mule the server crashed.  
---
-Even before that, other people reported input lag or stuttered once they got close to the character.  
---
Currently, even with their inventory broken up between 2 mule accounts, I'm still causing people lag when they get close to the characters...
---
Ah ok.
---
Windowed borderless sends fps down the drains.
---
Same
---
they move at the pace of snail. It literally takes 30 minutes to walk from whitesprings to sutton.I know this since I have a mule now, mine is just level 100 in max PA with fireproof just incase. 
---
I never use VATS, I have a [junky/shotgun/explosive](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3249f8&amp;d=pc2eg1c72ic3ib4a72a41as2l71lu2sb2sd0su0s01so0sp0sw2sg2s72a12lt2a00&amp;w=&amp;n=) build, and 15 Agility.  
---
I use my AP to sprint everywhere and all the time, and i love it. Also, high AP and Dodgy Perk make me unkillable.
---
Alright thanks for ll this i'll try and set my paranoia aside though if i see a lvl 100 or higher i'm gone
---
My camp is half way down a remote cliff edge. But if I see anyone close to it, I don't return until they're clear. So yeah, just as paranoid. 
---
This reminds me of the door at the park in the northwest area of the map.
---
One of the doors is locked, but if you walk to the side of the building the wall of the same room is blown wide open.
---
Disagree, posted above, I've proven the opposite, I can crash the server based on inventory alone.
---
Yea I dont shoot tons anyway... I'm later game. Definitely going to switch it for Four Leaf Clover 
---
If you're worried about that people can do that now. It just takes 2 people or accounts instead of one. All a shared stash would do is make it so those already loading up one character with that much of a stash don't have to trade first. And why does something like this bother you so much? The people who would take advantage of like you say they would probably already are. To fix this all Bethesda would have to do is make it so you can only have a small percentage of your maximum carry weight. So if your maximum carry weight is 300 pounds they could make it 5% over so the maximum you can pickup is 315 pounds. 
---
Yup. Now imagine what a fully modded bloodied +25% fire rate increased prime gatling gun can do. Especially with all heavy gunner cards, stabilized, and one gun army and adrenal reaction
---
yeah I thought it was sort of a long stretch
---
But even then you could pull that mod off and put it on a different machete
---
Because for some ppl $20 is chump change.
---
I think it's an achievement/challenge as well
---
When you go into build mode there will be an extra tab for extractors you can build. Find the node on the ground. Place the extractor and add power to it via generators (or in some workshops there's a power box if someone has powered up the power plants. 
---
Workshops are great for getting plans and a few rewards, experience. 
---
You'll get a defend event shortly after taking a workshop which is good for xp as well.
---
And having an extra fast travel point on the map is great too. 
---
Admittedly, I wound up doing this to someone as well.  One of my first times to Watoga, I got a parade of robots following me out of the Watoga High School.  I didn't know where else to go but back to the train station.
---
I am 315 currently and been giving out junk from one of my PVP kills.  3 players have logged out so far when I visited their camp.  
---
Mashing the button will do that unfortunately
---
Each one has a specific resource. For example, the ammo factory produces ammo, the junkyard produces a lot of useful junk etc
---
You can claim one and the resources are yours, as long as you clear the enemies, power the collectors and what not
---
You lose ownership under one or more of three circumstances 
---
1) someone else takes it
---
2) you fail to defend it
---
3) you log off
---
What's the prize?
---
This isnt an MMO, and progressing faster is pay to win, just because there is no "win" in ths game doesnt mean it doesnt exist, anything that gives 1 player an advantage over another player is pay to win, yes you "can" earn atoms in game, but you also can just pay shit loads of money to get them, so if we both started at the same time, and like your example here, I buy experience boosts constantly and you dont because you cant afford to, I level up 15x faster than you do, I buy every plan for every weapon available so while your struggling to find materials/plans or weapons the normal way, I already have them and ive leveled faster so I can use them against you in PVP.  
---
Do you think it would be fair for people to be able to do that when I say "you can earn these in game yourself" While you pick up maybe 200 atoms a day and these plans cost thousands each
---
I emailed them and opened a ticket, still waiting for a response. What's even worse is I'm banned from all Bethesda games as well so I can't even play the Skyrim game my brother got me for Christmas anymore due to this nonsense. 
---
Something where we can show the middle finger to someone else would be aprettiated
---
That civil war reenactment quest makes me sad. I thought it was one of the coolest quests in the game so far, but I could never complete it. Really wish they'd make it a large scale pvp event.
---
Better late than never. Still doesn't change the fact that Fallout 76 is a shit game nobody asked for and deserved its poor sales and negative reviews.
---
i second all these.  although im still waiting on that princess bed to come out!  c'mon Bethesda...we've seen it.  gimme!   
---
Fish lamp is best CAMP pet :)
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate. One day you‚Äôre luck will turn!
---
A spear also works, although it seems to be rarer than pitchforks. 
---
Definitely second the hunting rifle - it's probably the best "common" weapon until you get access to the lever action rifle at level 25, although I'm not even sure if that drops enough to be considered common. The hunting rifle though, you should be able to get access to almost all of the mods, even at level 18, since you find so many to scrap. 
---
It‚Äôs passive over time but you have to protect the resource collectors. It will be in the building menu &gt; resources &gt; and you should see the respective collector that will turn green over a vein located at the workshop. You have to also power them and it‚Äôs optional, but I would lock them as well.
---
this is giving me some fallout 76 hate video flashbacks 
---
Is there a specific route they‚Äôd normally take ?
---
Yep, that really grinds my gears, too.
---
/r/fo76bazaar
---
Because nowhere does it say pacifist mode prevents pvp or you dying. 
---
What absolute nonsense.  What do you compete for in a game where any high-level PVP activity is decided by whoever lands a hit with a TSE weapon first?  What are you even PVPing for?  Resources that are fucking everywhere in near-infinite quantities requiring only the time it takes to move there to accumulate?
---
Mutations are stupid in a game where the entire premise is radioactivity and the things it does in the environments it pollutes.  Right.  Role playing broken.  How dare you play a mutated character in a game world where almost everything biological/capable of mutation would be mutated.  SO STUPID.
---
Arguing that game mechanics available to everyone takes away from role playing is fucking stupid.  Even thinking it is fucking stupid.  Especially in a game that offers effectively zero actual challenge to anyone capable of reading.
---
Another fucking crybaby shitting up the boards because everyone doesn't play the game the way they want it played.  I don't like mutations, they are broken!  They break mUh iMmErSiOn!  It's not fair!
---
I also found this guy - kinda freaked me out
---
TSE Explosive Weapons didn‚Äôt need nerfed. Other things that need nerfed that made it seem that TSE where op when they really wasn‚Äôt.
---
I will say Shotguns are broken and needed a nerf. Shotguns shoots pellets and each pellet got the dps number. Which meant a Shotgun was shooting 8 bullets at a time.
---
Worth claiming one once just to get the metric ton of camp plans you get from the first time rewards
---
It's still stretched out, unfortunately.
---
Me and bae
---
Nocturnal is worst effect, you hinder youself half the time. 
---
You are ridiculous.  This is a game about radiation and what it does, and how you survive around those challenges.
---
NOT being mutated in this environment is the only immersion breaker here.
---
That's from the kill, the event usually gives me something random, it gives me a plan for a piece of ultracite armor, a prime receiver, and then from what I understand there is supposed to be a drop for an ultracite armor mod or a serum or something random. I've  received the explosive vents and empath once pre last patch. 
---
I think I might have it I'll send u a inv if I do
---
naw most have their homes now almost always in the green zone which can't be nuked. Almost always near vault 76
---
Now THAT would send me over the edge
---
Do you also have the cap? Looking all over for that
---
God damn it.
---
No. Not this shit again.
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
Ill check
---
What I would like to understand is how 5 people who afked in watoga did not finish the city side quest and get whitelisted by the bots.
---
Thank youuu!!!
---
Pre patch I was receiving 3* legendary melee weapons most of the time, the last two I ran last night and today I received non legendary armor in its place. 
---
Honestly, it's also good practice.
---
I didn't bother with Nuke Events until someone nuked the far northwest corner of the map.  I had already explored that area (I hadn't charted most of the Bog at that point), let's go see what one of these is all about.  I learned a lot about what I needed to do to survive from that.
---
....You literally can just go to recent players and join their game
---
I love heart of the swamp! I also think that having specific plans or weapons dropped from different events would give people a reason to try different ones. Another interesting event could be one where you help robots rebuild an area, maybe it's a daily and it's cumulative so after a few weeks the area gets built up more and produces bonuses. Basically a few persistent workshops or somthing similar.
---
"Now for the leg, huh?"
---
Just baseless rumors.
---
If only you bothered to look at the vendors a single time you would've seen them.  How crazy.
---
Naptime for the ghoullfriend
---
Sentinel set with assassin effect
---
Dense mod on torso (or one against stagger)
---
3 ranks in Fireproof perk
---
A guy with TSE Handmade can‚Äôt kill me even if I do nothing. Auto-stims heal me faster than he damages.
---
Yet I die to people catching me on the move sometimes. Maximum bounty earned was around 1,5k. And my set isn‚Äôt perfect, I have left and right arms with Unyielding and Life-saving effects instead of Assassin (still they provide Sentinel).
---
Another layer of protection is stacking Rad X and Rad Shield - I get around 625 rad protection (along with some tertiary legendary bonuses) and can avoid PA in nuke zones.
---
My only wish is Jet Pack separate from PA.
---
Still use X-01 roaming the world.
---
I love to fly.
---
I found out I could lock the nuka cola machine in my camp. I think that its weird but funny
---
Trust me I've had some issue like this one here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ah4dsu/a_long_really_long_story_of_murder_attempted/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
It ended well but was very stressful 
---
Your turrets shooting you means you're wanted
---
21th century psychopaths right there in that whole sentence.
---
Where are these servers? I've been grinding heart of the swamp, uranium fever, line in the sand and horde events and every time I hope they're almost never available.
---
I don‚Äôt know, that just makes duping easier since the need for a mule is removed.
---
Cuddle time
---
I don't mean to hijack a post here, but how do I switch out emotes? There are ones that the game says I own, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to add them to the emotes wheel. I'm still rolling with the generic default ones.
---
I would agree if cheating/duping mattered but it doesn't. I love the game too but this isnt some competitive pvp based game. It's a CASUAL online coop game. I wasn't going on about the video. I just mean Bethesda shouldn't retroactively ban people for doing it. Did they also ban everyone who has, even unknowingly, received a duped weapon/armor? By your logic they should. I think if a developer makes a mistake (allowing the dupe glitch in their game) then it's fair game for the community. Not fair to punish your customers because you gave them something and they used it. They are just hurting the small player base they have. I also didn't mean anyone in particular about the "big name". I just assumed there is probably at least one decent size YouTuber/streamer playing fallout who was affected. And banning that person will probably get a negative reaction from the person who's essentially advertising their game. Glad u got a laugh out of me, I didn't dupe, I'm not banned, I just think as a developer, you shouldn't punish customers if you put out something broken.
---
Claim workshop.
---
Set up defense and collector(s).
---
Defend first attack successfully.
---
Get reward plan for ashtray.
---
Leave to do quest, get notice to defend next attack.
---
Fast travel to workshop.
---
Get disconnected. 
---
The other vaults were never important. Or were built to fail and lay our groundwork 
---
Making you stop is much easier than making you move.
---
I hope so
---
I love Bethesda. Been a fan of their games for over a decade. I've dumped thousands of hours into Fallout and ES games. If I want to maker fun if them when they've been fucking up, I will. The loss of fake internet points means nothing to me. People need to quit taking this shit so seriously. 
---
Good buy, I got one this morning too. 
---
The purple eyed one is the Wise Mothman, he‚Äôs the nice guy, gives you xp boost if you do the light house event! :( 
---
Just got Wooden Patio Chair.
---
I want to double upvote this.
---
Hahahaha. Want to move the goalposts a bit more maybe? If you pick up a bag of money is the street and you don't know where it came from it isn't theft.
---
If you see the person stealing it and then take it then sure it can be seen as theft because that would make you an accomplice. But that isn't what we were talking about. Finding is very different from stealing.
---
But carry on with your false equivalence and moving goalposts. 
---
I don't.
---
The majority of my camp is a garden so i expect ppl to help themselves and use my stations.
---
I don't lock anything anymore
---
That will be the most rewarding, however just as rare as two shot explosive so get ready to grind!
---
There's no interaction between it and a loss of gun damage. He's  probably diseased.
---
You dont need materials when installing mods. It says it requires material but it actually doesnt
---
Not sure. 
---
But this morning I had 7 turrets in a workshop and 1  of them turned red and started shooting at me. I wasn't wanted and the other 6 remained normal 
---
I would have liked atleast all rifleman guns, I don't use a hunting rifle but I love the semi auto handmade.
---
Your mod was consumed by running out of steel and using it to repair stuff in an event.
---
Not sure about all rise though
---
Me too, did Major of the Day, and never got my All Rise, was pretty disappointed.
---
Ooh thats a damn good idea lol
---
it can charge up to 5 shots, but it does the "use all the ammo" only on the weakest shot it'd be neat if they actually made it limitless and you could really charge 4000 ammo into it and do 4000 ammo worth of damage but it just does the level one charge damage and makes all your ammo disappear so it's not even a fun or cool bug. 
---
It's about power disparity and finding humor in your ability to grief someone who has a justifiable apprehension about people like you doing things you're hinting at. If you normalize taunting and harassing lower level players it takes away social stigma, a social barrier, from following through in your threat to harm. This relates in the way that sexual harassment was normalized and deemed "harmless fun" and in doing so destigmatized a stepping stone to sexual assault. 
---
Meshing both concepts of implied violence, thinly veiled phallic imagery, and trying to have a night out: let's say we destigmatize brandishing a knife at a stranger. "I'm just having a laugh, mate; ease off." could easily transition to "but seriously though, gimme your wallet or I'll slice you." Folks would learn to ignore that destigmatize knife brandish and thus ignore the warning signs and so good luck having someone intervene on being upset that someone pulled a knife on you. Why'd you even go out if you knew folks would be out there with knives? Why'd you not wear a Kevlar jacket then if you were popping off for a drink after work?
---
This dick's brandishing his guns and showing off that he can hurt the low level players with few repercussions, much like some handsy ass would at a bar. "Look at me, I can hurt you. Nah, I'm just having a laugh mate: ease off."
---
I ve seen my brother 3 hit a boss lvl 50 SB with a pipe revolver. it was amazing
---
Good idea but fallout's game engine is too unstable to work with that, it would be fine on a newer engine or on something designed to handle complex moddifications like that, but alas we get a game engine based on computer theory from the 1980s
---
I know it‚Äôs fun to parody but this happens to me a lot. Bethesda should disable bed interaction during combat.
---
A wastelander has the right to say no, even if they‚Äôve already started.
---
My set is all mixed lol, its mostly robot parts though so I threw on a sentry helmet and became a rust devil!
---
Plan: Flamingos
---
Brutal, I'm sorry to welcome you into my RNG, but here are 25 explosive vent plans, maybe if you carry them around the dice gods will take pity?
---
Happens to me all the time when I'm trying to give away really good free shit. They dart way and I go oh well, I guess the next lucky individual will get it. If I am not shooting you, don't run away from me.
---
The fact I had to look that up tells me even more :s
---
I have one if someone wants to buy it
---
I can verify this.
---

---
I was able to get back down by walking off to the right.  These were the turrets at the start of the area, specifically the one on ther ight.
---
There is. No. Confirmation.
---
The problem is, in fact, Bethesda, and they have directly acknowledged it in their latest ‚Äúinto the vault.‚Äù
---
We are just frustrated that it still isn‚Äôt fixed.
---
I wish I could use photo mode before I respawn. I have the most safety then. lol
---
Same problem. What's up with that, right? I guess I could make multiple blue prints but not only would that be a pain, I bet I wouldn't be able to put the thing back together.
---
Yes, only on initial login.
---
I'm patient though so i just wait 30 second
---
Which is incredibly strange given that I didn't have time to react to shooting these guys. 
---
You better keep that damn rifle!
---
Not hope, fact. It isnt going free to play anytime soon. People are just claiming it will cuz of the problems the game has had.
---
Most people selling on ebay sre dupers so their accounts will be banned and the items deleted
---
I ran a hunting rifle and a fire axe around that level.
---
And a shotgun sometimes
---
Exactly what I thought. Unless he meant he got the plans to learn it? But why he wouldn‚Äôt use the plans immediately is beyond me. But he said mod so I assumed actual mod which means he should‚Äôve been able to install it immediately
---
It tells you what components are being scraped or used as you hit the craft button.  Again, it‚Äôs just about paying attention.
---
My gf is also having this problem the pipboy screen is completely blacked out
---
GOLF OUTFIT &amp; GOLF SKIRTS people! You‚Äôre in Whitesprings anyways, grab every Golf Outfit you can! At only .10 and worth around 30-40 per, it‚Äôs a no-brainer for cap runs. 
---
It could,with all the BS Bethesda did,I would not be surprised.
---
Sure! really, why should melee weapons be superior to a minigun anyways, is beyond me.
---
It only appears from level 15-25ish.
---
After that vendors won't suc stock the plan.
---
Late game its replaced by a different gun. 
---
Budget well spent 
---
&gt;If you pick up a bag of money is the street and you don't know where it came from it isn't theft.
---
If you go home with it because, "Oh hey! A giant bag of money, how lucky is that?" yes, yes it is.  If you take it down to a police station to return it, saying, "I found this giant bag of money laying in the sleep.  Thought it was fishy, so here you go..." then you're fine.  
---
But if the cops show up at your house an hour later because another person reported seeing you pick up a big bag of money and run off, you're certainly on the hook.
---
&gt; But carry on with your false equivalence and moving goalposts. 
---
Same with this game. If you picked up a bunch of duped shit, enough that you're getting banned for it, then that's your fault. It was clearly not right, and you took advantage of it.  Sure, you could plead your case that you didn't actually exploit the game, but deserve leniency because you only benefited from someone who did.  But you shouldn't get a free pass.
---
The last time I was in there, I was hiding from a scorch beast as a lvl 20. It‚Äôs a cool location other than that, though.
---
We know what they eat because we can loot their dungpiles.
---
I didn‚Äôt get an email like most people said but there‚Äôs no maintenance so that‚Äôs all I could think. 
---
Haha got it, Fallout 76 is about an invisible scaly kangaroo with claws and bird bones flying through the air in power armor while electrocuting and irradiating people.
---

---

---
Ghouled around and fell in love
---
You on Xbox? I get bored and do this often lmao
---
Really curious, did you do this due to increase in instability after the last patch?  
---
Only asking because I'm running a high core/thread count system, seeing serious stability issues and curious if the last patch changed the CPU usage / threading causing the problems.
---
Sure, it *could*. But as of this moment, there is zero evidence it will.

Update has seem to made my gameplay much worse.. When joining new server everything freezes for 20 to 30 seconds, and just as long for my base to load in.. Im still experiencing massive crashes and disconnects from server (averaging about 10 every 3 hours) I dont even take resource locations anymore after all the caps time and resources i waste to take it over just to be disconnected. Last time i went to launch a nuke made it through whole thing and right before I swiped the keycard server disconnected me.
---
Scourge Queen is broken half the time to where when we get her to reheal (normally in first 5 minutes) after that she takes little to no dmg. Remaining time may get her down to 85% health and then she won't take anymore dmg even though my melee weapon normally hits for around 2% of her health. 
---
Teammates are still occasionally becoming invisible or having there power armor removed and stretched. 
---
Please add a way to see what plans we already have, I have wastee caps getting plans I thought I didnt have.
---
Im pretty sure you can get that from a qwest in the ash heap
---
Where at I want to scare my wife with this guy lol
---
I've tried several different mice, old and new. Same results.
---
You can find them online 
---
Your abrupt and needless aggression tells me you have a very unfulfilling life.
---
I have run into people doing this. Kill players all day and they never get a bounty. I presume it is a type of exploit but idk. I know I wasn't wanted for a fact when it happened to me the other day and I didnt have any claimed workshops so idk what the deal is. I am sure if it is a exploit it will be all over YouTube in the next week or so though. 
---
Can you imagine power armoured wendigos? 
---
*wouldn't it be nice....
---
Yeah, the wooden floors are a nice thing.  You can preview a lot of this stuff in CAMP build mode.  You just can't place it unless you buy it.
---
The additional emotes are more trouble than they are worth - they don't add anything to the wheel, they are buried in awkward sub-categories of the things already there.
---
That spot is actually more popular than you think, but It just happens over time up there. I built my forst camp up there and my 4 other friends joined me. We ran into a few other severs that would remove one of our camps, but after the update that claimed to save your camp if someone was in that spot, it randomly started just pulling them up every week or so. Since then myself and 3 of the 4 friends have moved to seperate parts of the map. The one that still is left up there has had his camp removed quite a few times now. Its been removed after he disconnects and comes right back to us where none of is have any issues. It has to be something about that area of the map.
---
My camp is just south of the Oversee's Camp and it made it next to the church in Flatwoods.
---
Not happening. To many toxic players as it is so if it goes F2p I will uninstall it and demand a refund.
---
All I do is open my stash and let it load. Once I see the items I go craft. 
---
Whew good to know, thanks. I have quite the MoM collection going for use at level 25 (I‚Äôm only level 23).
---
I still have it but I didn‚Äôt launch a nuke yet, so maybe after?
---
Have you tried any further than that?
---
When the main story ends is the only thing that a dweller can do..
---
If you have a nice idea for a sort of character you want to play then that would be a good investment towards some duds that will help with the RP. 
---
Example: I've been wanting to work on a cannibal clown character and needed that surgical mask to complete the ensemble. I'm gonna get it with the croquette mallet and maybe the clean clown costume to really make it pop.
---
If you do decide to wait, every so often there is a datamine after the patches that shows what's coming up in the store. It doesn't show all of it but some of it
---
Yeah I fully expect to get downvoted for my reply, people on this reddit won't admit they're literally a circlejerk for an unpopular game and when people have legit criticisms or hate they just go "muh poor gaym" and downvote anyone that actually tries to express their opinions
---
Thanks Namco for saving me with Ace Combat. 
---
Check your Spam folder, I didn't find it until I came on reddit and seen someone say to check there. I thought I was hacked first.
---
No worries I'd not heard of it either
---
Not really but, I can always give it a try. Let,s see if it can go past the church. Give me 5 mins
---
What's worse, is that it was literally the best affix in FO4 if you fully committed to a Junkie build. All the beta cucks thought that two-shot and explosive were the shit in FO4, but a true alpha who knows the game's mechanics knows that old Junkie is god-tier.

Thanks. I wasnt planning on RP but that seems like a good idea. I'll keep an eye out for the datamines.
---
Man I‚Äôd love to be over cucumbered 
---
That‚Äôs exactly how I feel. Minus the toxic players.
---
Everyone I‚Äôve played with seemed or were pretty relaxed and helpful
---
Anytime dude! I‚Äôm continually impressed by how civil and helpful the FO76 community is, so I thought I‚Äôd try to pay it forward when I can.
---
You are mistaken.  It is an acknowledged flaw.  
---
Do you think all these people pay no attention at all?  Newbs are not buying jetpacks.
---
Please show me any screenshot warning of our jetpack mod being scrapped.  Without that, please stop insisting it exists.
---
Nice.
---
Had someone level 80ish come to my base and so I had a couple of my level 140+ friends show up. I'm level 100, but they popped their weapon out and started pointing it at me until my friends showed up and then that was that. They left. Mine is kinda hidden in plain sight though, not many people trek where it is, so when people do show up, I get suspicious.
---
Appeal the ban. You're reasoning is that fallout is an m rated game and language is covered under that rating. If they're offended by a swear word. They shouldn't be playing an m rated game.

I don't lock anything either, on the grounds that A: Really, you're free to use whatever you want here and B: Having a lock invites players of a certain mindset to make trouble.  It signals, hey, this person seems to care about their CAMP.  I bet I'll have fun wrecking it.
---
Most of the time if *I'm* hanging around your base, I'm probably admiring it.  There are some really creative CAMP ideas out there and I like to see how other players build things.
---
I‚Äôm with you! This community rocks.
---
Today I emptied a lot of junk and was wondering why the ores and stuff are listed under Misc. This was helpful. Cheers!
---
You can get Ultracite PA mods from regular scorchbeasts.
---
Problem is that most disconnects are not network events, they are server deaths, so the server instance you just left is probably not there to rejoin.
---
Further, if you leave a server there is a high probability that your slot/session in that server is going to be more-or-less instantly given to someone else. Servers instances are "expensive" to start and maintain, and giving you a ten minute "reservation" sounds cheap, but doing it for everyone would lead to a lot of worlds with more reservations than active players.
---
It would be more interesting and potentially useful if the immediate region around your character had a replay journal associated with it so that if the next server you join doesn't have an outstanding state for your immediate area then your last state could be played back into that immediate area.
---
This would also stop server hopping in many cases since the local vendor inventory and such would be part of that semi-consistent state.
---
In particular I'd like to see current state for claimed environmental workshops to get this treatment at a minimum, as that would be a manageable network load. The server could send you a signed (a la public key) blob for each workshop region, and maybe a set of flags for whether a given power plant was started by you. Then for every accomplishment you've completed it could either match you to a world, or change the world you entered as you arrive.
---
So that would let you turn on all the lights maybe.
---
But just like for C.A.M.P. placement conflicts, if someone else is doing the event for a power plant or is too close to or actively working a site, the strong suggestion of what should be there for you would simply be ignored.
---
It would make you feel like your efforts to fix things had some ongoing value.
---
But server reconnect is actually an NP-hard problem that's easy to say but not so easy to do since the FO engine design isn't like shards in WoW, where dungeons instance on entry.
---
Also a "whoops" and "I'm sorry"
---
I don't know if they're going to take this seriously. There isn't any mindless cursing or wild tinfoil hat conjecture in it.
---
On a less sarcastic note:
---
Great feedback!
---
Nah, make the shared on account one small and the shared with buddies only on the server your on.
---
I know it was a stretch I was just wondering why a business in the market of selling games would stop selling the game.
---
You can buy used copies and or the tricentennial edition but the base game is nowhere to be found on their site
---
It was just an observation and Like you say hopefully nothing else
---
 Nice. I need to spend more time with vendors. 
---
Just a heads up on something on the forums that is not on Inside the Vault
---

---
Fyi, the outfit is clean and the pants are no longer ragged.  Brighter colors on the outfit and the hat.
---
Ok but.....if you have a problem with the game why are you still playing it. 
---
Im usually 10 cucumbers away from being over cucumbered. The weight system is poop.

I thought about to this morning. 76 was Vault-Tec's vault to take over the nukes, whereas the rest are about GECK and religion, etc, so are important. Sorry for criticising you
---
Lol - at level 98 and still haven't done that quest.  Maybe today's the day.
---
And precious lead baby! Makes you immune to radiation one small exposure at a time!
---
And? 
---
There is a boxing glove in flatwoods, and i'm pretty sure a brass knuckle too. Check the gym attached to the motel.
---
Just swap it out when you need to repair armor
---
Just fists should work until you can fight the scorched at the farm betwen the overseer's camp and the Slocum Joe's. Scorched at lower levels seem to drop knuckles frequently. No idea on a gaurnted spawn.
---
This is good advice, thanks!
---
I can't believe it made it. With two random s watching like...wtf üòÇ
---
Ok :)
---
My problem is not finding shit to sell to vendors.
---
My problem is that they run out of caps when I still have massive amounts of shit to sell to them.
---
And a Sorry one... 
---
You're on fire today.
---
I feel like we should get refuned or free in game items that the others cant get i spent $40 on this game while it was on sale 
---
Glowing mass from corpses too.
---
I refuse to trade with anyone without a mic for this reason.  Usually people trying to trick you into selling stuff for 1 or 0 caps.
---
Gunpowder can get heavy as hell and is stored under misc. too. 
---
Why ask why?
---
Idd
---
It takes 30 minutes max to do a vendor circuit.
---
Yup. Basically any resources that could consider mineral-based are stored in misc.
---
If you dont have starched genes equiped iT does.
---
You‚Äôre assuming a lot. 
---
You can still buy it from players.
---
You can even buy Snowwhite PA from beta.
---
I'm currently watching the Bearcats game, BTW lol
---
It made it. I cant believe it made it. Try even further next time
---
I‚Äôve gotten $39 of enjoyment out of it.   Give me some atoms or an exclusive high level armor set or something as a purchaser of the game, hell even 5000 atoms. 
---
If more people end up playing from it going free to play, then the worlds will only get better.
---
Subsidized with game play, which is a limited subsidy both figuratively And literally 
---
I could see picking it up post 50 for that, but I wouldn't grab a perk for 50% of its effect while leveling.
---
How? I thought atomic items couldn‚Äôt be traded?
---
I don't have a problem, this is purely for the lols. Why is everyone in this subreddit so negative and think everyone else is negative?
---
People over 100+ are actually the most generous a lot of the time, because there's basically nothing we need by that point. Welcome to free chems, aid, ammo, spare apparel, basically everything that doesn't fit that high level player's particular build lol
---
I'd be all for it.
---
And yes, the lack of a timer stinks.  I had to do AWOL Armaments twice before I finally got an instance that was "real."
---
The Gatling Gun devours SBs with Stabilized active. VATS builds aren't great with heavy weapons because of the SPECIAL spread, but the gun is strong enough on its own not to need it.
---
No that's the firebreather outfit. The responders fireman outfit is blue. It's a forest reward with a 1/35 drop rate when you even get a clothing drop.
---
If you go to Hornwright Industries HQ, and complete the quest,you can get the combat rifle plans. 
---
I think the Flatwoods monster can hack turrets 
---
I think it is something that should be looked at, not immediately since there are more pressing issues, but it is frustrating when you fast travel to an event that has 4 minutes left to complete it
---
A guy with paint makes X-01 set, paints it and sells you pieces.
---
It works as much as Big Smoke does in that damn train mission
---
It does what it can. I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs better for shotgun builds, or about 1/200 shots with a regular gun (1/100 for two shot)
---
May have to move your camp then move it back.
---
It probably was. They were both in the high 100's so I am sure they did their research. 
---
Could server hop a couple times to get it to despawn then place it down again for free.
---
Np, that's totally a normal item. Powered just means it regens AP.
---
Now I just need them to buff the LMG. I got an anti-armor LMG, but it's really ammo-hungry for how little damage each shot does to anything really. 
---
Also if you sledge the radroach in the tunnel just before the entrance, although it will sometimes put you in the factory, sometimes the fuji plant, sometimes same height but outside the pipe instead of inside the pipe.
---
I actually remember the ‚Äúno nose‚Äù quest in fo4 had a similar spot that would throw you smack in the middle of Goodneighbor sometimes :-)
---
The army of mingos!
---
Whitesprings: Gold balls! Also golf clubs. 
---
Oh ok
---
Earthquakes. They're a thing in this game.
---
Interesting. No other players where in the area.  So maybe the flatwoods monster 
---
You were in Whitesprings yesterday, weren't you?  I had the same mask with the pajamas on.
---
Of all the games I‚Äôve played, this has one of nicest communities. People only get pissy if your base is at the golf resort.
---
Hey man where did you find these plans? I could use'em!
---
I would imagine they have plans for cool stuff and lots of stuff drawing from fallout lore which would also be cool. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs a 5-7 year game like elder scrolls online and they can‚Äôt dump all the coolest fallout stuff on people right away.
---
That being said omg clowns and toys who carrrresss. There has to be better themes then ‚Äúsilly‚Äù.
---
Sounds painful
---
It's "haunted."
---
Except, well, have a look around. üòâ
---
I‚Äôm not going to try cause we are running the same exact build.
---
I found a powered piece the other day
---
Ultracite looks slick
---
And it‚Äôs repeatedly happened here on different servers?
---
Mr&amp;Ms Deathclaw getting it on somewere nearby
---
I use ‚ÄúThank you for your input‚Äù in exactly the same way.  :)
---
1000 atoms all earned doing challenges... sure.
---
K.
---
The only thing wrong with pvp right now are the mechanics built in to "prevent greifing"
---
SLAP and Pacifist ended up giving the entitled fanboys a little blanket to coddle up in. A false sense of righteousness, Because you opt out of pvp doesnt mean u can ruin our fun. Pretty arrogant of you. 
---
Those of us working on pvp builds dont appreciate being told what we can or cant do, or how the pvp mechanics should work by people who dont even want to pvp. You never gave it a fair shot if you havent tried it with the appropriate gear.
---
Most of this sub would prefer pvp removed from the game.  Why would a pvper or bethesda care about the opinion of non pvpers whrn theres a whole community out pvping? I expect you guys to die out in a year. There isnt that much content to keep you going. Pvp is endless content, even in its current form
---
Dont cry about balance until you have a full pvp set. Sentinels, assasins, unyielding, cavaliers. 
---
You guys have no idea what your talking about.
---
Also camp raids are NOT greifing.  Its just another way to initiate pvp. 
---
You are just noise.
---
Depends on what u mean. Without Starched Genes any mutation will be deleted by removing the rads with any item or through any method.
---
Once you have Starched Genes Radaway will work normally and not remove the mutation.
---
However, if you use Rad X even with Starched Genes, your mutations will not be removed BUT they will be disabled for the duration of Rad X.
---
Nah fam. Just give me a dance emote. 
---
Could have been friendly fire,those assualtrons are still broken and the laser never shuts off.
---
If pigs started to fly, how would you feel? Your question is just as pointless. 
---
Where did you buy this plan homie?
---
[Here's how the nuke codes work.](https://nukacrypt.com/how) The codes are generally solved pretty quickly after the reset (Monday afternoon/evening in the US), and the current ones can be found [here](https://nukacrypt.com/solved).
---
Using Hard Bargain is obvious. Many folks forget, though, that beer and many other alcoholic beverages are +1 CHA, and that can be multiplied by Party Girl/Boy.
---
Jesus give them a chance
---
I usually end up over cucumbered at WS - really becomes a pickle when there's 15 GG's are coming after me.
---
They always worked for me. I bought several from there before I came to reddit. 
---
As far as I can tell you don't switch em out, they just get added to certain parts of the wheel. For example I have the salute emote and it occupies the same slot as the wave, I just have to hit RB (or whatever your equivalent would be) to cycle through them
---
Probably a leftover.  They don‚Äôt generally autoscrap, which would imply they could be useful at some point.  Same with wooden skis.
---
No. You‚Äôre all wrong. Take all of the required material out of your stash. For some reason workbenches aren‚Äôt accounting for the junk in your stash. So take out what you need to repair or craft, and then try. 
---
Yeah btw I forgot to mention you can just make a new character and do the missions thirst things thirst and second helpings at flatwoods over and over to try and get outfits.
---
There are earthquakes all over the map. A lot of it in Ash Heap. I have my camp there and I see it very often. However, the shaking near Alpine Cabin may actually be something else, which I'm not saying cause spoiler.
---
Thanks you guys! I‚Äôll try both out and see if that works! 
---
21th. Killed me.
---
I had the same that was odd üòÇ first time it's happened to me, it was after I killed a legendary Mr Gutsy 
---
Thanks that‚Äôs good to know üëç
---
How does it fair against high armor enemies like SBs and mutants? Haven't tried heavy weapons in a whkle.
---
It's an M rated game. Fuck is in M rated games. "Saying what the fuck", as op states was said, is not derogatory towards you at all. Saying "you duck" would be. If you reported them for saying "what the fuck", then you're a trolling piece of shit douchebag. 
---
Apparently it‚Äôs haunted and this holotape says the ground shakes and I hear screams, and doors close on their own. I don‚Äôt care about spoiler if you do know.
---
They do work.
---
Lol. Like I‚Äôm gonna take you seriously when you‚Äôre flinging around those childish little insults. Get outta here. 
---
I stop by anyone‚Äôs camp I come across. If you‚Äôre low level you get free gifts too. 
---
Exactly, i really hope they don't scale it back as crazy as they are looking to. TSE weapons are the only reason i am able to kill the queen within the time limit. 
---
Nope.  Nothing they can do, including leveling my CAMP will cost me more then a bit of junk
---
You can have opinions but you‚Äôre not entitled to anyone thinking they‚Äôre good. 
---
Some places have literally a single enemy spawn in its not worth it to nuke.
---
No one knows the real reason. It may be an actual haunting  (technically ghosts exist in Fallout canon) or it could simply be a slightly earthquake heavy area.
---
If by trying, you mean waiting until after release thinking players will be fine with the bugs because of oh magical todd howard saying "hey, its part of the charm of our games to be buggy and broken." Then the team only patching it due to large amounts of outrage and banning people over silly things like teenagers trolling a full grown man online and wanting to make the game look prettier on their pc, no gameplay mod changes, just graphical setting upgrades, then yeah, they're definitely trying to please you, you poor, poor sheep.
---
I havent touched that even since it stripped me of all my .556 ammo
---
There‚Äôs also footsteps when no one is around as well as doors closing by themselves so prob haunted
---
Sorry Mark, I didn't mean to question your emote!
---
I would mourn because that means they gave up on supporting it and there wouldn‚Äôt be any DLC.
---
76 doesn‚Äôt have a minimization method that could support it through free to play. The Atom Shop isn‚Äôt big enough and doesn‚Äôt have unique enough content to make Bethesda enough money on its own.
---
It‚Äôd be kinda fun to see a boost of new players joining the game and the forums would become interesting for awhile. And chances are a lot of people would realize the game is actually good and not the trash it gets reported as.
---
Certain legendary effects take priority over the primary effect when it comes to naming such as: Sentinels, Poisoners or Powered 
---
If you have a doubt just toggle the perk and check the weight/damage (depending on what perk you toggle).
---
The most confusing one is the Tesla Rifle. Says rifle, crafts under heavy, is not a heavy, is a rifle.
---
But the Railway Rifle.....
---
Congratulations! Your Master's thesis has been accepted and you have been granted an associate professorship in feminist dance therapy.

Not as painful as shoving a running chainsaw up your ass... Not to mention it's also ***MOTHERFUCKING ON FIRE***!
---
Yeah there's a lot haha. It's how I boosted mine up for the a achievement 
---
It is one of the items they found in the dev room. Evidence would point that we will get it in the future at some point.
---
"Dont take muh one shot guns, I can't git gud"
---
Cry some more.
---
They do more harm than good and it is 95% of the pvp problem in the game.
---
I got one in a drop from legendary in Whitesprings, sold it to the vender at the train station.
---
I got the Halloween Costume plans off a Random Encounter spawn near the damn in the Mire. Most of the time it's just like, bloatflys or whatever, but one time I was there it was a dead "Trick or Treater" with the costume plans on them. I've heard that's how you get the Witch costume too, the same spot but a different encounter, but I've never managed to find it there yet.
---
I just want a Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paint job. 
---
I spent $60 for it.
---
They will see as their silent majority fades away.  If enough people stop playing maybe they will change. Otherwise Fallout will become another fortnite clone over time. Fallout has been tainted by pvp and is no longer the franchise it once was. I feel like most of us wanted a coop fallout, and this is what we got. Oh well. Hope for the best I guess if this game is important to you.
---
Yeah, make it +10 base fo being mutated and then +1 on top for every additional mutation you have.
---
I found him south of Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. Exercise cation though, there‚Äôs another deathclaw with him, fighting a group of scorched.
---
They are making pvp server your point is invalid. If you want a game that balances based on pvp go play call of duty or something else. If the game is balanced for pvp and not pve it will absolutely ruin it. Fallout at its core has never been pvp and 99% of its fans never wanted pvp at the start. 
---
At least make it like "Hold A". I hate it when I'm trying to pick something up off a bench or near a table and I sit instead.
---
Before the patch, the serum wouldn't work if you already had the herbivore or carnivore mutation. But it definitely works now since I just bought and used one successfully the other day while having carnivore. 
---
On the too right side of the map there is a little 65 highway it's next to the crevasse dam it's a random encounter spawner on the road.
---
No, one in 50 people abuses a mule toon like that, if even that many. This would make it so literally everyone does. Quite literally everyone.
---
[Lea, just lazy as always.](https://i.imgur.com/dhqFBNi.jpg)
---
PVP is the problem with the game.
---
Yeah. Games cost money to make. The Atomic shop doesn't generate enough money to get Bethesda to keep making future content. Making 76 free is equivalent to shutting it down. At most, in future, they could add a free mode like a PvP only mode (battle royale or something) but there's no chance they can keep supporting the free game.
---
Encounters like this is why push to talk should have never been added
---
To be fair, it's not obvious what's a vendor in the Enclave or even how many of them there are if you aren't familiar with it. Everywhere else, the vendors are robots. In the Enclave, it's the MODUS terminals.. but not all of them.
---
You don't need to farm the queen to get the ultracite or prime recipes, one nuke is more than enough to get 20+plans as long you are paired with someone. 
---
I daresay it won't happen.  No way to make money.  As we've seen, the Atom Store is full of BS.
---
Yes, I guess my main problem is I have explored a large amount of the forest area and the northern area and I am not finding any similar level quests. Are quests hidden throughout towns? Do I need to explore every nook and cranny of every building looking for a terminal or a note that starts a quest? Or do they pop up automatically? I have like 10 open side quests and I have tried them all several times and I get murdered. I know it would be better to play with somebody but I dont like online gaming tbh
---
everyone always says the high school or carnivals for plastic.  I will share my little secret.  Super Mutants.  High level ones have the charging sniper rifles.  With the scrapper perk on, you get 6 plastic per rifle.
---
That be a good one also. 
---
If you‚Äôre on console press the select button while in the pipboy. This will make it a simple overlay instead of the pipboy attached to your arm. It loads much faster and will work on login when the menues will normally lag or be invisible for a bit.
---
The plans aren't strictly rare: If you can get a level 15 character to Watoga Station or Harper's Ferry then you can buy as many as you want. That's a bit of a pain though, so people will buy them at a premium.
---
The handmade rifle is the best spamfire rifle (superior to combat &amp; assault rifles), but it's a rare drop so you need the plan to farm mods.
---
I'll share a secret with you, in whitesprings, between the main building and the golf course, there is a gazebo surrounded by flowers. Inside it is a water fountain that cures diseases. Shhhhhhhh! 
---
I play on PC with Nvidia Driver 417.71 Installed and did not experience any Bugs in 5 Sessions with 2-3 Hours Playtime per Session since the July 10th Update.
---
I had a Server Disconnect Once / a "Server not responding we froze ur Controls", but no Crashes here
---
cant believe its only been 16 days feels like we‚Äôve been playing together for months lol.
---
That sounds worse
---
Yeah I have the paint and when I went to trade or drop the item it either isn‚Äôt there or it disappears. 
---
Ha! I completed my ungrad and graduate degrees there. The campus is entirely different now. Huggins was  just getting booted when I started.
---
Man I don‚Äôt have to read the post, the title alone speaks to me
---
Explosive is probably affecting trajectory, analogous to what it does to energy weapons.  
---
Normally, aim of harpoon is super-hard due to slow flight and short drop-off.  The sight is so silly!  If gunner needs the scope, that means the target is way too far for flat trajectory, and therefore should have been calibrated rather than barrel-sighted....  But it is fun and weird.  :)
---
I wanted a coop game with a chance of encountering an enemy, not a cordial duel. I mean that how it was initially marketed. I know many feel the same
---
It's not like they can't add or make a new way to monetize the game.There have been ''lunchboxes'' found in the game by dataminers.
---
The fabricator terminal (IIRC) warns, during the quest, that you can make one and only one of the underlying items.
---
What the terminal does not say ‚Äî and which you will not know if you haven't been doing out-of-world research somewhere like Reddit ‚Äî is that those crappy low-level items are required to fabricate higher-leveled ones which at least some players may find useful later.
---
Hence I sold or simply dropped my Garb; now can't get another without extraordinary effort; and feel cheated by the incompleteness of the original in-game warning.
---
Note: Even without the Garb of Mysteries, one can indeed return to the corpse in Lewisburg and re-loot another Tattered Dress, which is my outerware of choice because, unlike most costumes, it has a +1 PER buff.
---
Not enough fire.
---
The problem is they decided to make the online fallout everyone wanted for a long time. We wanted to play with friends. And then decided to cater to the pvp community as well. They're trying to accommodate two different player bases in one game and it's not working. 
---
Fallout has always been about being a lone wanderer (with a companion), the exploration, survival and storylines. 
---
PvP in a fallout world should have completely excluded the prior. Or they should have, from the beginning, made a pvp only mode or story mode. 
---
You cant make both player bases happy if you continue to make changes to one at the downfall of another. 
---
Don't think it will happen but it would be a good thing overall. Look what happened with ESO
---
[I‚Äôm rocking a space helmet and a tux ](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9Cwwhs) 
---
That thing again?
---
Do you know what these lunchboxes do?
---
Yes, it works, but to be safe you should un-equip Starched Genes first, take serum, verify mutation, then re-equip Starched Genes.  Doing that by the numbers I have been successful with them many times.
---
My suggestion is uninstalling the GPU driver and reinstalling through NVidia Experience. For some reason NVidia cant make a clean install of driver updates for the 900 line to save their lives. 
---
This can all come down to a driver issue for other devices, even a mouse or keyboard, that can cause this error. Windows isn't smart enough to separate a peripheral causing the problem inside a program and can spit out this error as a "well it did happen while this was up, so it must be its fault". I can't guarantee it will fix it all, but its worth a shot. My only other guesses would be a registry error that keeps manifesting during 76 as once again Windows isnt smart enough to separate system errors from a program causing it. 
---
This or in an extreme case, it could be first signs of storage failure or even caching errors on boot drives or the SSD. You say here you have an 850 SSD, is it or even near full? SSDs hate being full and cause all kind of errors as they do. Samsung's NAND in those things usually prevent those errors, but no system is perfect. Could even be a bad SATA connection and switching to a different port on the motherboard will fix it. I never wish it to be a hardware issue for anyone, but its all possible.
---
Side not, I hate that Windows makes this error code a catch all for this type of issue. You'd think by this time eery code would have a different number.
---
Yup! When I found it my first reaction was "omg no way" and quickly turned into "omg my heart D: "
---
Wait what does Hunter radio do?
---
No. He meant what he said.
---
Need to be able to determine what plans I have and do not have. Would be preferable if there was an icon next to each plan and a list I could view if trying to determine whether I own the plan prior to negotiating a trade with a player
---
Fireproof 3 perk. The screech attack barely tickles.

---
Fairly certain quest rewards tend to be based on player level. Idk about Perfect Storm, but with some if you wait until you‚Äôre level 50 to do the mission m, the item should scale to your level. I doubt it works that way with Perfect Storm tho. It probably has a cap lvl of 25 or something to keep it from being abused.
---
No they are not. Who is spreading these rumors? You're the 3rd person today within 10 minutes. Unless you're just one guy with alts.
---
There is auditory cue, at least sometimes. Whining. 
---
This is... strange.
---
I missed the moment and my friend gave me his armor (just dropped the frame and I entered).
---
So I have it but certainly didn‚Äôt buy it in atomic store. 
---
The scoping one drives me nuts. The hang after a shot is so bad that I‚Äôve gotten into the pattern of ‚Äúshoot &gt; right-click (drop scope) &gt; reload round &gt; right click (scope up) &gt; aim &gt; shoot‚Äù
---
It is literally faster for me to reacquire my target after every shot than to wait for the scope to drop on its own when you need to reload the clip.
---
Keep exploring the area, you will find out why. 
---
I haven't done that quest yet but maybe the bots are only friendly until someone else has made them hostile? I have no clue, game is pretty buggy. 
---
LOL you have no idea what the 80s was like!
---
you bring the stuff to craft  ill get you them for free
---
or maybe a Sammy!

Cav
---
I know what they were used for in Fallout 4, but there is no rule saying that it must be used the same way in Fallout 76.
---
Move the camp box like two feet and you can place it all again cost free
---
Please Please PLEASE.... Give us proper xp split even if we didn't hit the target. 
---
I always play together with my friends and I am 5-6 lvls behind, just because they shoot everything and the time it takes for me to run in and punch stuff.... everything is dead already.
---
It is really frustrating.
---
Thx

Sorry to hear that.

I hope you'll convince him that it isn't the games fault and idiots/griefers can be found everywhere.

There needs to be a change to the sensitivity X vs Y. From the 'feel' of it, Fallout 76 has a different sensitivity settings for the 'Y' plane vs the 'X' plane. Players should be able to determine the X vs Y ratio like every other modern/competitive FPS (if that is what you are trying to aim for with your PvP mode).
---
Paid 33 caps to get to one that had 17 seconds left. 
---
I reposted; I hope it's all cool, let me know if I effed up.
---
Yes, literally all I want is some nice hair!!!!
---
Explosive Legendary was so insanely overpowered full stop. Should never have been part of the game.
---
Welcome to the wasteland tell him and to put up or shut up.. raider life!!!
---
It will get better once we get private servers I hope. Imagine KEEPING THEM FOREVER IF YOU GET KICKED
---
what does it take to craft
---
This! This is why I wear my Santa suit lol 
---
Ooh, ooh, how about a bunch of spiders eating you from the inside out?
---
Make it automatic and pair it with Tormentor and it rules, procs all the time.  Find the mats, make and scrap lots of them to learn the mods, and it will anchor a commando build.
---
I gave up getting materials from them. I claim them for plans and fast travel now mostly. 
---
Lead- one run through lucky hole mines in excavator armor can get you something like 415 lead ore. Smelter down using superduper perk I got about 1300-1400 lead scrap. It took me two weeks to need to do it again for more bullets. 
---
It started after the last patch...why no clue, as I always thought those crates were a great for everyone.
---
My camp was there there by the train station on the road across from power plant from around lvl 10 to 30ish. Knew nothing of vendor spawns there it was just a great place to sell my stuff and most of my quests were in that general area so it was just a good spot.

---
You're gonna have to just buy a higher level one from someone else if you really wanna keep using it. They should be fairly cheap because there's a lot better legendary options out there, and basically every single player gets a Perfect Storm at some point (just at different levels).
---
Yes this has been normal thing for me too when I started. Told a friend (level 55) about it and he was like ‚Äúnever happened to me‚Äù / ‚Äúdid you build your camp at whitesprings?‚Äù / ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre unlucky‚Äù
---
People would once or twice a week hack up my camp  for fun 
---
Some others however would stay a bit, give me some water or food, or build a fusion generator for me
---
And somewhere after level 40 it suddenly stopped and no one destroyed my camp anymore - weird 
---
I feel like everyone is lazy or didn't check his profile because he posted another update about a week ago
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aekjtl/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_10_januari_patch/
---
Since last patch happens all the time. Only on initial load in but I have to restart the game when it does it. 
---
Hold E
---
Yeah because all these players are so scared of teaming for some reason. I send invites and never get responses 
---
That may just be your game doing that because I still see it saying owned:max rank on mine. Not that that excuses Bethesda from an issue like that happening.
---
hope that‚Äôs not a bad thing :D
---
Did you have workshops at the time? Having workshops enters you into PvP by default.
---
No you don't have an option to add to team if they are in one already. The option exists on people on the map but every one of them says not accepting.
---
They do pop up sometimes by discovering a location, also from certain notes and computers. Also on computers you can find one email/file that opens a location every so often. You don't need to read every word just open and flick through the pages. 
---
In the forest, you should be able to source a lot of materials. If you haven't already, focus on repairing or craft/mod your weapons and armour as said. Makes a big impact. Plus your perk cards - when you're starting try to grab at least one of most of cards that sort out the issues from AP, hunger, thirst, armour/weapon durability and breaking etc. Should make the overall survival stuff more enjoyable. 
---
Have a nice day...
---
If there is 4 people with it on then rah player is given a target in a large area and your can freely hunt them down in that area that they are in all while someone is hunting you
---
I haven't tried it against scorchbeasts, as I can't see anything when fighting them. They use their scream as often as the fire rate of the gatling gun. 
---
Against Lvl 68 super mutants, I need to focus fire on 1 of them, to be able to kill 2 with 1 drum. So it takes about half a drum to kill 1 supermutant, if I am lucky. 
---
Missiles and 40mm trick me every time. 
---
You could have placed your camp near theirs. I like to go check out the other person's camp and will usually just server hop after unless I'm in the mood to pick a new campsite
---
You say that but elder scrolls has pvp now and it‚Äôs actually quite fantastic, maybe if you gave it a shot instead of whining about it on reddit you might have some fun instead of quitting an enjoyable game out of spite.
---
You cant even snatch nuclear cards without being wanted, just make the loot good for everybody.
---
Makes me think of yellow urinal cake blocks. So not very appetising at all. 
---
Sorry on PC, but do you know where the spawns are for the power armor? [Fo 76 Interactive Map should help.](https://fo76map.com/)
---
They're not. Dataminers have found that out too, but most YouTubers keep that conveniently out of their videos because rational discussion doesn't get them views, sensationalism does.
---
Lunchboxes have codes associated with them that add cosmetic effects to the game: makes enemies  explode into confetti for a few minutes. Allegedly, they also add effects like increased XP gains for a few minutes (I have not dound any proof for this). But at this point, that's not lootboxing, as they have no code to grant items. And given the very short and useless effects that they grant, I don't see how Bethesda stands to make any major cash from them.
---
Moreover, Lunchboxes affect an area: anyone in that area gets the effects of the opened box. Who has ever heard of lootboxes working that way?
---
There's literally been like 3 today alone ü§¶
---
I disagree. Even in pve, if people are able to one shot stuff in a nuke zone, you never get the experience or the loot if you never get a chance to shoot at stuff.
---
It makes legendary and Flux farming much harder.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Interesting. I didnt know that.
---
No bother buddy, Thanks anyway should help a lot!
---
It's a glitch. It happens to me all the time with my team and they are absolutely not on another team. One sits next to me while we play lol.
---
We often have to invite through the xbox friends list instead. 
---
Yea, I'll take a hard no on that one. I paid 12,600 to have the ones I do. I'd be pissed if someone took them away when I have zero interest in pvp.
---
It don't even let me send them. Just says they aren't accepting at this time on everyone.
---
I've had plenty of no responses on PS4 but on Xbox it won't let me invite anyone if they are not a friend and I join them that way.
---
I see this too.  I think it's a bug.
---
not all all. :3
---
I think it‚Äôs either they‚Äôre already in a team or they muted the whole server to play alone 
---
&gt; \[W\]hat happens if Luck of the Draw activates at say 196%? It is my suspicion that it actually sets the gun back to 100%.  
---
No, it doesn't. I can't tell much improvement in the weapon condition even when it's already below 100% when the perk procs, so I presume ‚Äî without having made any attempt at empirical quantification ‚Äî that it's not very much, at least at level 1. However, I can definitely confirm having had the perk proc when I had weapons equipped which were already well over 100%, and they certainly didn't drop to (or below) 100% as a consequence.
---
At least it's not just me lol
---
Hmm now that‚Äôs interesting. 
---
Seems you don't have it.  You can't move and stay invisible.
---
Serious? Fuck me. Thanks for the tip lol
---
That's not what nuclear fallout would look like, though. It pretty much looks like what the inside of the blast zone is like.
---
Someone has severe reading comprehension issues.
---
Cool, I'll stop looking for a setting that doesn't exists then üòã
---
Shotgut + Enforcer perk also works wonders. Cripple the head so they can't spam their sonic attack, cripple the wings so they land, cripple everything else to make them immobile. Then finish them off with your best weapon. Got ambushed by a Scorchbeast recently and killed it with a little bit of effort.
---
http://imgur.com/a/S8yz0OoMy character getting ready to punch out all of your blood!
---
By the same token, I've been on servers where there are no events running for a long time... I've noticed some events are almost guaranteed to start when a player enters certain places. And maybe the event system takes into account server player count. But maybe there needs to be some more reliable way to know about current and upcoming events. 
---
Maybe a radio station that broadcasts current events and tells you about future ones? Or perhaps a tab on the pip-boy that shows current and future events with their time-to-end/time-to-start? And maybe also show the ones that are ready to start if you go to the place to begin it?
---
Oh you didn‚Äôt notice the tiny flames near the bottom that might as well not even exist? Cool lol. 
---
Also remember all legendary robots explode after death. One from Watoga got me yesterday when I let my guard down. 
---
Level 25 you can start the miners mission cant (recall name) but that lets you craft your excavator set.
---
Gov. aid drop lmao I never heard it called that. Making it sound like I am swiping someone's disability money
---
I enjoyed the amount of information you posted and I know this isn't worth a reply but thank you for the read. It was extremely informational and well done. 
---
U on ps4?
---
Yes, the military leader who formed the Brotherhood was a guy named Roger Maxson.  He rebelled against the human experimentation and left the military and formed the BoS.  His family has pretty much been in leadership of BoS since it was formed.  He's the same guy referenced in F76, his great great great grandson Arthur Maxson is the young squire in F3, who grows up to become the leader of the BoS in F4.  He was a decent kid in F3, but became an asshole for some reason.
---
But this is on everyone! Literally every person on the map.
---
You make it sounds like they can't tweak or change how the lunchboxes work.If it does go F2P, they will have to find some way to monetize,don't think it will be the atom shop tho since that's garbage even now.
---
I‚Äôll be sure to check that out, Thanks!
---
This post seems kinda one sided,  I mean I'm primarily pve, but I don't see why you would want to shut out pvpers altogether.
---
prefer epic story's myself 
---
This has been asked for from day one. And is needed for them power armoured people. 
---
Camo for hunting rifles is in the shop at this very moment. 500 caps, limited 3 day availability. Get on it! 
---
I got this a few times the last time I went through a silo.
---
Do you happen to have a Power Armor helmet with Targeting HUD equipped? 
---
I wish there was more apocalyptic looking things , give us some mad max looking outfits , or junk walls for our camps ( even though they should be in the base game like in 4)
---
We could keep arguing over this, but that'd be pointless because it's all speculation. 
---
Bump.
---
File bug report, but don‚Äôt expect a repsinse. I lost 2000 cells to a different bug, posted it with video evidence here and on the forum and got nothing in response.
---
Hmm, this gives me hope. This would mean that rumor that handmade plans don't drop after a certain level are false.
---
Most of us were apprehensive about Fallout 76 because of the pvp aspect. We played along til now in hopes they would realize this should not be a game focused on pvp. Instead they have turned the whole franchise upside down in the name of pvp. We are called the cry babies when it was their complaints that have incited the recent nerfs, just like every pvp/pve game. Pve players always suffer to accommodate the needs of the pvp players in all games where both exist side by side. I had hoped the people at Bethesda were smart enough to solve this problem, but I guess not. Private servers and making legendary weapons not harm players could have been the solution to everyone's issues with this game.
---
Happened to me on one of the turrets in sugar grove. 
---
Assaultrons are most vulnerable at the legs. Don‚Äôt even bother shooting them anywhere else. Leg seems to be the body part with least armor protection for them. 
---
You're full of crap. There's no way 5 people were in the train station that a) couldn't deal with level 24 assultrons b) haddent done the mayor for a day quest.
---
I don't even believe there were 5 in there at the same time to begin with. 
---
Cool story though.
---
Alright thanks. That was more of the answer I was looking for. 
---
I've been running it at rank 3 for a while. It is nice at times when it gets me some extra mileage but I'm at the point where resources are piled so I figured if I have to repair back to 200% every once in a while then so be it. Four Leaf Clover will be way more beneficial at this point I believe. 
---
Creepy but awesome lol
---
Same for me, twice. Didn‚Äôt loose it on a quest the day before, just gone.
---
Except in this case, the problem was that everyone had the same weapon causing the problem and that the item was in large made widely available by means of duping. Not only did this break the game economy, it essentially made pvp a pay to win and the elite guns far too common. 
---
After 100s of hours of play, I haven't seen a single explosive or two shot anything, so getting them the legit way is in fact a very rare thing.
---
Maybe a better fix would be to require the explosive weapons to use explosive ammo that had a super hard to craft requirement that needed Flux and grenades or something. Limit the ammo, limit the use and thus limit the problem. 
---
Still need one?
---
Are any of you using a power armor helmet with Targeting HUD equipped? I was having crazy bad issues with crashes. Someone on here figured out it was the targeting hud, stopped using mine and almost never crash now. 
---
Where did you hit?
---
I would have enjoyed it more if the coop was like State of Decay.
---
What's your gamertag? Feel free to DM me
---
Just don't lose them. You need the old weapons to craft the higher level versions.
---
Are we just going to ignore the fact that these weapons were overpowered in PVE as well but sure blame the PVP community for it to
---
I couldn't find the original video I saw of this, but I found another: https://youtu.be/V573GoqMulM
---
I was in contact with them on a mutation bug, and it seams they don't have the tools to edit character's 
---
If they provided early adopters with some actually good skins or other benifits say 15k atoms or something I could deal with it. But seeing as they consistently bite/ shit on the hand that feeds them I doubt they would.
---
Also have serious doubts about thier competence in managing a live service game and ability to correctly monetise to provide new and meaningful content. 
---
ok so I tested, it was not twisted muscles but another one, I'm not entirely sure which one it was but my damage was back to normal after I cleared a few mutations, further testing required.
---
#BUT WAIT! DID YOU SEE OUR NEW OVER PRICED CAMP ITEM?! ONLY $40!!!!
---
-Bethesda instead probably 
---
Tbh tse needed a nerf anyway.
---
There was 0 reason to run any other combo for pve. Now other combos look more appealing.
---
Yeah it's the PvE to PvP I'm concerned about. The duping issues and exploits mean some people have very powerful things they didn't earn and that there are a lot more of those things out there than there would otherwise be. Not to mention the levelling exploits. If I go onto a PvP server, I'd rather it be populated by characters dedicated to that role. For my existing character, I'm pretty much fine with the way things are. 
---
That still works for turrets, as it did in Fallout 4, and I think too for crops. I'm not at all sure that it works for other CAMP items (like walls); I get inconsistent results when I try it.
---
I saw this one at the whitesprings bunker so I guess something similar must have happened
---
Its a good starter set and you can create a set of it for level 25, 35 and 45 although the level 25 sets would probably last until level 50. 
---
Not sure if your familiar with the set but its worth it as it gives you an auto +100 carry weight, which of course is always helpful :D
---
Common misunderstanding.  You need to get the Wendigo to wear the costume while you kill it.  
---
AMEN!!!!
---
No sorry I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
At least u got some acknowledgement. I‚Äôve gotten silence from Bethesda and a bunch of players telling me they experienced the bug as well. So basicly exactly this post.
---
I didnt report them. I dont report. 
---
I just like the poetic justice. Im all about the camp raids and pvp aspect of this game. I love seeing pve weenies get put in check with stuff like this. Wrecking ball is a perk. Smashing camps is part of the game.
---
I hate how most of the community has the opinion that im greifing or trolling when i try to raid a CAMP. 
---
Im just playing the game as a raider. Jeez nuthin personal.
---
I just love this post bc the entitled pve player got put in check by the devs. The devs clearly agree that camp raids are fair play.
---
The biggest was actually daggerfall
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that 
---
I‚Äôll be sure to make use of it
---
I absolutely agree with your very last point. If they're adding in unrestricted PVP servers, they should almost completely remove PVP from the "normal" servers. Basically just a forced Pacifist mode really. That way you just know exactly what you're getting into when you pick which type from the main menu. If you feel like a real challenge, hit the PvP servers. If you just wanna farm some mats, don't want your Camp destroyed, or just don't enjoy PvP in general, go with the "normal" servers.
---
Only concerns I can think of off the top of my head would be:
---
a) how do Workshops change hands without PvP?
---
b) there would have to be a prompt if you're joining a friend's server and they're in a different type than you were previously in (switching from a PvP server to non-PvP server, or vice versa)
---
Exactly this
---
I'll give you 1k
---
GT: John C137
---
Someone gave me one today. It's not the atom shop outfit. He said it was given to him. Wasn't sure where he got it. 
---
It hit from the Oversee's Camp to just pass south of the Flatwoods church
---
don't you juust get those through the  BoS questline? Because I did.
---
I tend to buy poses, but then again I like taking pictures. It all depends on what interests you, nothing from the atom shop is going to make or break your experience. :)
---
I completed it, i remember it was like.. 100 caps reward
---
*modding. Why cant we edit posts on reddit ugh. 
---
There's already a "throwing up" icon in the default set. Maybe you aren't satisfied unless the game lets you drop F-bombs in addition to nukes, but I don't see this as a pressing need.
---
By contrast, I see a *profound* practical need for a "Bye-bye" emote to balance the "Hello" emote.
---
High agility and luck. Gunslinger perks. Luck perks for improved critical and building crits faster. VATS crits to the head will destroy a lot of enemies. 
---
Thumb's up is adequate for that, IMHO.
---
Yeah please let me know because I have friends that would like me to paint theirs. Maybe I‚Äôm bugged or something. Who knows. 
---
Or some other emote to convey sympathy, yes.
---
That doesn't get rid of them
---
Think I'll put some in my camp tonight !
---
Tbh I think they nerfed it because of the duping market. 
---
Yes!
---
Dig the story. Does the jukebox still play the same 3-5 classical pieces?
---
now you just need a cowboy outfit
---
Platform
---
He‚Äôs a big guy

Cute camp. What platform are you on? I get camp plans all the time and just drop them. 
---
I've just found a two shot minigun just to be nerfed aahahah

What an awesome piece of history, and a good read! I had no idea! I don't imagine I'll ever leave this spot now. Thanks for sharing this!

Skip leg day much?
---
You're welcome. Enjoy the wastelands. 
---
Picking the lock will make you wanted, but looting the box after someone else picked it will not.

You dare to wear Enclave issue equipment while mutated? You filthy muties, ALL OF YAS
---
Rifle Gaming   -  Been watching this series.
---
Ghoul slayers switch blade, with the right melee perks and mods is amazing in whitesprings nuke zones. 
---
Are they ever going to come out with a solo mode so I have some reason to buy this game?
---
It might have been a Powered Assassin combat armour. Only the first legendary perfix shows up in the name of the item.
---
The answer hasn't changed throughout the dozens of these posts.
---
I learned something new today, ty ü§ì
---
Yes you can edit them.
---
No alts.  No it‚Äôs popping up on various YouTube channels.

walking randomly through the swamp and had 4 scorch beasts attack me at once, bad times man.

PC. Sorry, edited the post.

I'm on ps4

PC. Edited the post, mb.

At least you could see em. I just logged on, I didn't even walk into em. 
---
That's the main reason I bought a pa paint job, just so i could see the atom sign next to my prefered set
---
I know that, It's my friends who think that...
---
Yeah, dandy, but again, this isn't a fucking trading market. 
---
I'm sorry that happened to you, also if someone had their camp overlapping yours, you don't have to rebuild it, you can just relog, the game tells you that.
---
wait, thats a thing now? lol...
---
I'm on mobile. I cant edit the original post, just replies to it. 
---
That's super cool to know! I actually hadn't looked into Harper's Ferry much beyond what we learn in school about it. Looking at pictures and u/jmcrowell post below about the significance of Maryland Heights in the Civil War and the gun emplacements there, this place has newfound meaning for me! I'm really digging it. Bethesda seems to have done a wonderful job of recreating the area and town. Being from around there, would you say so as well?
---
It‚Äôs fun no doubt it level really doesn‚Äôt matter after 50 and some people will kill you some will help you with whatever you need 
---
Yes.  Many times a day.  Especially if I've claimed a workshop.  Discourages workshop claiming or anything that takes a long time/investment to work on. 
---
I wish there was a way at least to get back to the same world after it happens.
---
Thanks, I hadn‚Äôt thought of that tbh, but that makes sense üëç
---
99% people are friendly and helpful. 
---
Others being high level isn't an issue. The story goes like any single player campaign. 
---
Monsters Inc fallout shared universe.
---
I‚Äôll never spend extra money on the atom shop. I‚Äôll earn my atoms. Which is easy to do. 
---
Errr if you're pve only and think two affixes providing 100% damage boosts is balanced you're delusional.
---
Imo pvp has a solution, fireproof + dense mods + sentinel/assassins/cavalier.
---
If anything the nerfs are because tse invalidates sqb so easily.
---
And i suspect melee will get a balance pass eventually too.
---
The plan or just the outfit?
---
I had my camp on one spots for weeks
---
You can also follow walkthroughs online to get the solution to every quest and the stats of every enemy. Or you can play it yourself and do it the more interesting way. It's up to you. If you think it's too easy to look it up online, then don't look it up online. 
---
Did you place the chassis or drop them? If they were placed (A on Xbox) they will recall to your inventory, even if you crash. If you drop them (X on Xbox) they will not. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind much since my camp has no doors and all are welcome to partake
---
Either will work
---
Wasn't whining, just stating facts. Besides who still plays ESO? Also who said I was quitting. I mean I may or may not continue to play this game, but that is no one else's business but mine. If I have fun with the game, I play it when I don't, I don't play. This is the decision everyone who is still playing this game will make regardless of my opinion or yours. I have played enough of this game to know whether I am having fun or not (about 8 hours a day since launch). I have defended this game and Bethesda tirelessly. I have just decided to stop defending is all. 
---
Dang. They did promise private servers and mod support though. Hopefully we will get those by December.
---
Yes you can. Tap the three dots on top right and there's an edit option. I use the mobile app too.
---
100+ hours in and I still look forward to playing everyday 
---
I play almost every night and I'm constantly checking the map and seeing new people. Hopefully new content comes soon, but I still thoroughly enjoy the game. Most vets like me are helpful to any new players, just come up and ask!
---
Its a more challenging version of Fallout 4 by yourself (albeit in a much more interesting map) BUT with friends its great fun!
---
Ooooh, "youtubers" You mean clickbait scam artists that bloat on for 10 minutes for ad revenue pennies?
---
Lockpicks were fixed in the last patch. I carry 50 or 60 and they weight 0.
---
Well I felt the difference immediately.  I can snipe with the harpoon gun at the distance of enemies leaving in while scoped. But can't hit anything even just a few meters away with the antiarmor
---
Knuckles can drop from low-level scorched, if you need something right out of the vault try hitting Morgantown
---
None all terrible and use too much room. They will severely limit your camp needs by alot. I believe its 10-15% of your camp budget per one. 
---
I want legion armor from nv
---
I showed this to my boyfriend.  He took one look at the flamingos and said "That's my religion."
---
Make an offer 
---
Looking for barn plans too. They sure are rare at this stage! 
---
Officer paint plans for PA is exploited in, you will get banned for it. Other peoole already have.
---
True,guess we will just have to wait and hope for the best.
---
Explosive was op regardless of pvp.  
---
Two shot was not op, but people simply assume so due to "TSE" being the phrase du jour that everyone associates with op weapons in fo76.  
---
But hey, it is what it is, I guess.
---
Damn I was gonna donate some door plans 
---
&gt; Look in a stash box before you try to repair or craft anything.
---
Why?
---
It's a known bug, but not an urgent one. They'll fix it eventually.
---
This makes duping easier- they need to eliminate ALL dupe methods first 
---
Very funny the first time I read this, six weeks ago. ;-)
---
This is what I have been saying all along. PVE players always suffer at the expense of pvp players in games where both exist.
---
Anyone who uses the phrase silent majority is a moron and narcissist.  You speak for you.  You don‚Äôt speak for anyone else.
---
Dense armor mod and fireproof perk lets you survive more than one shot now
---
Still expensive for little reward.
---
Don‚Äôt get an itch from that ghoul. 
---
Not really I do think the mutants perk should be better maybe 15% more damage 
---
No worries. Sorry. Xbx1. Good luck. 
---
I think a big problem with the whole legendary system is that when there are fifteen+ of them they aren't legendary at all, it doesn't take a whole lot to kill them and when you do they don't have items that I would call legendary. They always have some odd weapon or armor that is almost useless unless you spec to to use it specifically. It'd be nice to be able to scrap legendary items, maybe with a higher chance of unlocking mods for that type of item. Supposedly there are awesome 3 star two shot explosive weapons that I've never found but now they're getting nerfed anyway. I've never seen anything over 3 stars either which makes me wonder if they're actually going to create some big event with a four or five star boss that actually will give you a chance at some crazy items. I have hope for the future of this game but I don't expect much, and certainly not quickly.
---
Do you know if that flight helmet has already been released, by any chance? 
---
I'm not saying they didnt do too much damage but that's only an issue really in pvp. If you're playing a linear storyline and want to defeat the big bad boss, the point is to have some weapons more powerful than others. That's how most storybased games are.
---
And by saying you can use this perk and that armor to protect y against pvp players means that there is really no choice in your playstyle for this game. If there are dozens of types of armor but you have to invest in just one to not get killed, well you're out of your mind. 
---
As I said some people want to play the story with a friend, some people want to fight other players. The two groups dont seem to blend very well together. 
---
Dude, even MODUS isn't straight-up intolerant of it.  Chill.
---
Hey did you ever get this figured out? I tamed a new pet to replace my annoying Mega-Sloth and now I've lots 10% of my budget in the process too. 
---
I'm nervous to try anything due to possibly increasing my phantom budget and am not sure what to do.
---
Can I ask which app you use? It's not an option on mine. 
---
weird, I haven't had any problems at all. In fact, the dcs are way less frequent.
---
I use the official reddit app.
---
Just store all your junk and run around naked asking for people to kill you.
---
So true not everything is all good and well all the time. You‚Äôre in a barren wasteland where you should be fighting for survival. if you want to be cradled don‚Äôt play a survival game
---
I have been having a similar, possibly related issue.  When I log in I take a few steps then I can‚Äôt move.  Sometimes I am able to open the map.  Sometimes I can fast travel but that doesn‚Äôt fix anything.  In all these instances I also cannot open my Pip-Boy.
---
Why have +30% to creepy things when you can have +100% damage to everything ü§î
---
You most likely dropped to PA rather than placed them if you place them they will recall to your inventory but in your case you most likely dropped them resulting in you losing them when leaving the server.
---
Tried doing that already, everyone I've come across seems to have their mic off haha. It's also hard to find people, as I can't see anyone on my map
---
Amazing story man. Fucking redemption at its best. 
---
My quad hardened piercing explosive radium rifle just dropped a glowing rad stag in 3 shots. With 5 rifleman points and 5 demolition expert points.
---
It's going to be nice when they finally Nerf this thing.......it's sooooooo OP!
---
Nice these will be duped next
---
Is it a PA build or not? Can‚Äôt tell
---
Yes this! This is so frustrating! 
---
It's because of these multiple posts about it stealing something that I have never done this event. Damn commie bastards are not getting my ammo or armour.
---
2 min without mutation then + 50 % for mutation for 1 min. This would balance it. I would test it a lot with some friends
---
I placed the chassis.
---
Only bans went to reshade and cheat engine for obvious reasons. Mods in general are fine hell i have been loaded up with tonnes of them for a long long time now.
---
Heck the chat mod community is so friggen huge i would not be surprised if most on pc use it alone. Since i see so many clan names in game on every server these days.
---
I dunno, unless im missing something Im pretty sure ‚Äústalkers‚Äù on melee weapons wins the prize for worst legendary. You already have max hit chance when in melee range so all it does is make vats cost more.
---
I tried testing it to see if it extended vats melee range but it didnt appear to. Id love to be wrong tho as I find stalker melee weapons all the time. But they seem beyond pointless.
---
oh fr? well shit that‚Äôs good to know
---
Was from one of the robot vendors at a train station near the starter area. Not sure which. I know it's just random if it shows up. 
---
It's not far enough to be consistently useful unless you're frequently moving your camp to be an advanced fire support base, in which case it's pretty cool.
---
I don't do that, but I have my camp at Solomon's Pond instead, east of the Whitespring Resort, built from a foundation that's actually IN the pond. From there, I can hit about half the Whitespring grounds, but not (quite) the golf clubhouse.)
---
I accept random invites all the time, usually low level players or people who need help with Belly Of The Beast quest.
---
Crashing to desktop has been a serious problem since the patch for me. I noticed it happens a lot when I open up the perk menu to quickly after opening up my Pip-Boy
---
I recommend just not having anyone a molerat would probably take out a missile turret.
---
Yup dozens. So are you making more posts about it?
---
It does and when I get a chance to play next week I would be happy to.  It says Chinese Officers blah blah whenever I need aluminum because it is going to scrap it.  I think you need proof it‚Äôs not happening because it has been in the game since beta.
---
No it‚Äôs unarmed 
---
Lmao yeah that one is pretty bad on melee weapons. 
---
Ah ok. Time to switch apps. Thanks!
---
I think if you install recoil reduction mods to the gun it should be better
---
Due to my salt over missing the blackbird PA, i'm sitting on all my atoms at last until the silver shroud heh.
---
Don‚Äôt build turrets on the ground then? /rolleyes 
---
Anecdotal claims don't make a game broken
---
Like you, I‚Äôm an older player too (older than you, rps67!) I potter around, play alone and although my reactions may not be as fast as younger players, I manage. I see a savage beauty in the Fallout 76 world and it‚Äôs an escape from a stressful job. It‚Äôs funny, at work no one knows I ‚Äògame‚Äô. I‚Äôve racked up many hundreds of hours on Skyrim and Fallout 4. I can talk about gaming with my son and on forums like this. I‚Äôm going to stick with 76 for a while, currently lvl 51 and looking forward to the future. 
---
It was very close to that before but for some reason like the 2nd patch in changed it and made night almost like day.
---
Yes, it's totally outside the realm of possibility that a game that can have 24 players in-game can have 6 in one location that serves as one of the hubs in the game. No way, no how can six people somehow end up at the same place at the same time. I've heard Unsolved Mysteries is getting a reboot, I'll submit this for closer evaluation. 
---
This hasn't happened to me. But whenever I invite my friend it happens to him.
---
If you're on Xbox I can help you redo it
---
Golly that ghoul made quick work on your face
---
Dying removes a small amount of rads.  To keep mutations before Level 31 without the help of higher-level teammates, you will want to avoid high-radiation areas and invest in radiation resistance in the form of armor and perks.  However, there is a other way to remove rads at lower levels while keeping your mutations.  A Nuka-Cola Ms. Nanny vendor on the second floor of the Whitesprings sells Nuka-Grapes.  This rad-removal aid item can also be boosted with the Cola Nut perk, which is available at lower levels.
---
Buying Atoms with real money is a sucker's deal at any price.  Exactly what rate of exchange, of real money for ephemeral virtual scrip, would constitute a good trade?  None.
---
I'm not rich or anything, but I'm an old boy and comfortably established - I can buy the Atomic Shop out tonight if I feel like it, no sweat.  But I've never been tempted to.  Because it's a *categorical* waste of money.
---
If Bethesda's steep rates are the only thing dissuading you from embarrassing yourself by trading your hard-earned cash for a digital fart in a stiff wind, you should thank them.
---
PS4, thanks though
---
I feel like your name should be steve_not_so_nice. But I'm totally in agreement with you here, I haven't even found a two shot explosive gun in the game and I'm pissed because I've been trying to find one since even before they became so popular.
---
That explains why it happens, and will hopefully prevent a few other people from making the same mistake. But it doesn't change the fact that it CAN happen. I think we all agree that the machine being able to "harvest" peoples ammo, armor or weapons, it neither intended nor welcome.
---
You can actually speed up scoping-in animation by clicking right click twice really fast. First click brings out the slow animation but second click brings you right into the scope without the "blink" animation
---
Maybe in that location, but not all killed by assultrons.unless there are special needs servers that I'm unaware of.
---
I am on PC and confirm, this has happened to me.
---
Why paired with someone?  I always play solo so I don't understand the comment
---
Ooh I had this happen. I clicked on the name of the card set that had disappeared and they came back. Hope this helps. 
---
Sure m8 my tse handmade with 1760 damage per shot with automatic receiver is not op at all   :D sure m8 keep them as they are and cry about pvp
---
More people then fallout actually and I don‚Äôt see any of  them crying about how they added pvp to elder scrolls.
---
They arent going away they have mofified the patch notes. They will now still drop but 2 shot and explosove are both getting nerfed.
---
Two shot will no longer add 100% damage increase for the second shot, it will only be +25%. The explosive effect will only add +20% instead of +100% damage.
---
Just put a saltshaker down and call it good, cuz thats all i see here
---
Ah you right
---
I would consider switching professional drinker for the which increase your resistances with each strength points you have. I drink alcohol in-game fairly often and addictions are pretty rare. Addictol will stack slowly but it will even without professional drinker. If you don‚Äôt want to put more points in strength, i would suggest the perk that gives energy resistance (endurance).
---
Its ok, if you find it for 30$ and you have friends I say buy it, and the players are very friendly
---
disable, like rad-x does. temporary of course
---
Can't believe there are people who take this post seriously. How unfortunate.
---
...Maybe you don't understand that in those areas, people often idle  or are sifting through menus, right? I do it often enough as it's one of the places where things won't randomly spawn for no reason while I'm getting something to drink/goofing off looking something up. 
---
Hard to defend against something when your attention is elsewhere, but yeah. 
---
Yeah in Conan Exiles its scary dark very cool
---
Unlike the rest of you pussies, I like my wings *spicy*.
---
Looks great! I'm really digging the garage, the before and after pictures were awesome; flip the switch and it comes to life. I also really like how the garage is separated from the house, but still accessible from it. Nice work!
---
I play on xbox and get random sayings invite declined and never even saw a invite pop up. 
---
Guessing this is sarcastic yeah its silly that things like molerats borrow through anything lol. No matter where you place them they will tunnel through the air itself to get behind your turret and kill it.
---
What loot drop issues? 
---
There's a video some where where a molerat digs up through a floating platform so ...
---
I wish I had a ‚Äúno mic‚Äù emote. Sometimes I don‚Äôt play with a mic/headset for various reasons. The amount of people who continue to talk to me expecting me to talk back his massive. Nearly everyone expects me to have a mic 
---
Martyrdom
---
I crash about 1 time per 20 minutes
---
Lol damn man I always thought about that happening, one time a player came down and didn‚Äôt help so I stopped killing the turrets and he eventually died.
---
GL on the next silo run 
---
Because mine was also explosive... so it did 100% more to everything and 130% more to creepy things
---
Now this is a true statement
---
They had TSE weapons BOOM.
---
If you're PVPing in FO76, you're just pathetic.
---
There.
---
Someone had to say it.
---
Fallout always has been, even still is a PVE game.
---
Go back to COD &amp; Fortnite if you want PVP.
---
I mean.. as long as mommy &amp; daddy didn't ground you from it.
---
I have a mic, but play mostly at night without a headset because I need to keep an ear on my baby monitor. So I don‚Äôt care to switch over to my headphones/mic every time someone wants to chat. 
---
They do remind me of fairies though these players, think of Tinker Bell all this flying and floating about, totally lore breaking, immersion breaking.
---
Changes Fallout to some magic kingdom WOW synergy. I'd be glad if the mutation system is just stripped from the game entirely, it is frankly ridiculous or at least restrict their active state to regions that we can avoid.
---
I tried to give a lowbie a huge paper bag of plans and recipes; spoke in game, jumped up and down on the bag, shone my light on it, waved him over, etc. He just couldnt understand. 
---
Well done indeed.
---
You can look up walkthroughs online to be TOLD what you‚Äôre supposed be doing, but you still have to do it yourself...so the example is a little different. 
---
This would never have been an issue had the duping not happened. All  games need an end game weapon, armor, goal, to make the last battle easier. It's the sheer abundance of them that made them irritating to players. If you only had one or two out of ten people using the ultra rare weapons on the final fight no one would care. 
---
I wish there were a thank you instead of ‚ô•Ô∏è or üëç
---
I got this after the update.  Doing a hard restart fixed it for me.
---
Never was, have a nice sized farm and two large water purifiers unlocked. Until I got the notification that my base was under attack. They destroyed my base, killed each other for the bounty. Caught em taking a photo of their "victory" (that's when I fast traveled back). Guy gave me some bs story and IGN that destroyed my base, he was trying not to laugh the entire time... I played it off like yeah all right I don't really care. He traded me because I told him I'm shit so this doesn't matter, scoped out my inventory, felt bad and gave me a TSE lever action. He then cheekily asked me to rebuild, said nah I'm good maybe later, he and his group stuck around for about 20mins till I logged out, went to a new world and rebuilt. Lost quite a bit of junk, but hey free TSE that helped me push to 50. 
---
&gt;I'm not saying they didnt do too much damage but that's only an issue really in pvp. 
---
It is absolutely an issue in pve in a multiplayer game. There's been tons of posts on this forum about TSE users steamrolling through group areas or events and killing things before anyone else can get a hit in. Those weapons are so powerful that more considerate players put them away in those situations.
---
Spiders aint that bad
---
???
---
Multiplication is commutative so it doesn‚Äôt matter what order you add on the perks :)
---
Same. I've had it freeze maybe three or four times this week. Used to happen at least once a day. Maybe crashed once two but I can't remember. Not to discount other people's experiences. 
---
The main rule to remember is to get their health to 0 and keep yours above 0. 
---
Agree completely. It would also allow me to visit Whitesprings in all its pristine glory, which I‚Äôve not been able to do for a very long time. 
---
More salt
---
I lolled about the clown suit
---
The weapons should have balanced before launch. Nerfing weapons should be a last resort and should never be so drastic. Once weapons start getting nerfed people will react. This is a fact, and Bethesda knew it would happen. They are just hoping they made the choice that results in the fewest loss of players. Unfortunately the TSE has existed as an op weapon  type and people have become attached.  Regardless of how OP they are, they should have never been introduced into the game in the state they were if they were not intended to be so powerful. Players have gotten to use them and have gotten used to playing with them, and of course they will be mad about a nerf. Right or wrong it is a problem Bethesda created.
---
I‚Äôm PC, Fredgarvin (level 148). I‚Äôll be free after 6p mst if you‚Äôd like to run it. I actually haven‚Äôt bothered to run it myself ;) add me!
---
Agreed. And allow naming the armors.
---
Kind of an aside to this, we need a way to group different armor sets together, like Forest Scout, Urban Scout, BoS, etc. Maybe folders? That way when I wanna swap out to a different set, I don't have to run through my entire Apparel inventory just go get the pieces.
---
I like the British "jog on" version. I'd pay some serious Atoms for that, especially if it came with a raspberry sound effect:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoXfiSU_wqE
---
Didn't notice that one before. Seriously, Someone send the Dev Team a Dictionary. So many spelling errors in the game its ridiculous.
---
Idk.  I don‚Äôt waste a lot of time worrying about the $0.01 they get from my view
---
Huh, that's what must have happened when I lost my speed demon mutation.
---
Realized it was somehow missing, and I'd taken an Eagle Eyes serum recently and I'd taken starched genes off to be on the "safe" side when I used it.
---
Mods and parts for UPA and also all prime receivers from regular scorch beasts. The only I haven't seen from regular SBs are serum recipes. 
---
I suggest sharks, sharks with frickin' laser beams.
---
If purified water was the ingredient, nobody could survive at low levels before you can build a purifier.
---
If you could use *either/or*, that would require the crafting system to be recoded to account for either/or ingredients.  Just for this one case.
---
Or to quote the menu at my local Chinese restaurant.... NO SUBSTITUTIONS!
---
You only need to look at gta online to see the truth of this. Last pve content: 6.5 million years ago.
---
Last pvo content: an hour ago, and more within the next 2! 
---
Yes. It would actually make the lower end ones useful. They could definetly use a buff regardless. 
---
How is nobody in this thread including Strange in Numbers?  It blew my mind the first time some stranger across the map invited me to their team and I started leaping over one-story buildings
---
I know E means explosive, but what is TS?
---
happen to me too on ps4 
---
Two-Shot
---
Aye, I get what they were going for but honestly it should be strictly a buff at night and then turned off during the day.  The penalty makes it stupid and you don't have the carry weight to lug around a bunch of situational guns.
---
I guess, but I had a guy who was a way higher level than me save me and my wife from a scorch beast because he dropped some much needed ammo and I felt like a dick just waving, giving a thumbs up and running away. 
---
Who's salt?
---
Still haven‚Äôt seen those plans anywhere. Not for a lack of trying to get the witch plan tho. :(
---
But the clown outfit in the atom shop is *clean!* If that's not worth $8 I don't know what is.
---
/s just to be clear.
---
I do Nuke runs all week on PS4 while streaming if you want some help.
---
While I agree with you in part, and will not use an explosive when other players are around, I will disagree that the weapons themselves are an issue. 
---
What your complaint is is in game etiquette. Technically no one owes anyone in this game a hit on an enemy. But courteous people, myself included will share the enemies. 
---
Youre going to get selfish players no matter what. And had it not been for the duping issues, the tse weapons would be few and far between. Ive gotten 2 explosive guns and one two shot in over 300 hours of game play. And i will not use them around other players. 
---
Perk cards are meant to make our weapons more powerful, we are supposed to be able to play this game solo remember, if we choose. 
---
If anything the exploits and selfish players are the problem. 
---
I thought it was $300 for an outfit? I‚Äôll just take that if possible 
---
If you are on PS4 try to Rebuild your Database.  It helped me out a lot.  It didn‚Äôt completely eliminate it, but it did reduce it enough.  I have the Pro and I was the only one I knew who was having the issue [Possibly related].
---

---
They'll need to increase budget first... I have a feeling most people are maxed or close to it
---
Likely.
---
Pve players always suffer for pvp players? Please. I havent had a good pvp experience in an open world in years. Because pve players go into pvp games and the pvp games market to pve players too. 
---
And you call it a problem with this game... but if they changed it to how you want it, which would be a pve player making pvp players suffer, I would call bethesda out for false advertising and want my money back
---
So, they can't generalize about how other people think, but you can? Hmm.
---
I'm down!
---
Tse or ts? 
---
Thanks! I need to spend some time farming first. What's your psn name?
---
The "Mutant's" legendary effect of +10% damage if mutated should stack for each mutation the user has, capped at 30-40%. I think that'd be pretty sweet.
---
The LMG even with stabilized takes about a mag or more to kill low level super mutants.
---
That's without a legendary affix, but the gun needs a huge buff tbh.
---
Probably more than doubling it's damage before it's even useable because of the fucking armor/damage formula in this game.
---
I built a bar in my base, so i encourage players come and hang out and when player vending becomes a thing I'll get to sell beer and liquor to other players
---
Yes yes and yes
---
That's cool! My camp sucks. I just haven't come across any good plans. I have a neighor who has an awesome camp - all metal walls (where do you get that plan. Roll-up steel garage doors. Security gate door....
---
Wish I could come across some nice building plans. Any PC players dropping them - tell me where and in what your are going to leave them and I'll give a look. Thanks!
---
1 missile turret as high as you can and a tamed creature. You can tame after you finish your camp, that way you won't use the budget they take beforehand. Turrets will shoot anything your pets can see as long they have an open LoS even if the target would be usually out of range.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 thunderstrom0831 I‚Äôll help and can give you a bunch of loot and gear
---
Xbox here. I have an anti armour explosive western that I'm willing to sell or trade. I think its 3rd star is vats related but I'm not sure
---
I need to hear an explanation of why the data added by stash limit doesn't scale linearly.
---
No.. we don‚Äôt do buffs round these parts boy.
---
Someone leveling fast doesn't bother me. Level 50 is level 50. Trying to grind out levels with constant higher levels might be annoying. The PVP servers should have a separate inventory for sure though. Same character but you're items and stash stay pve or pvp. Switching back and forth wouldn't be so bad. I agree with a fresh start on gear for sure. Also, my camp would be in the same spot. I have a different idea for PVP related camps.
---
It's a joke how often they drop. I saw one on the ground after a kill last night.
---
I usually run into this with single digit chars, they run up spam trade and im sitting there like go check the overseer boxes i left it all there ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
If you enjoy a relentless grind with frustrating game mechanics and moderate at best server stability then yes. I've put bulk hours in and enjoyed it but the end game grind has finally gotten to me.
---
For the past two weeks, prime receivers are no longer dropping for me. Anybody else having this issue?
---
I found this also near one of the Forward Stations west of RobCo but I couldn't determine the source.
---
I don't think it matters much.   The way they are going about it so far,  it's significance as a title is probably not very long lived.
---
No cap, that way people who run. Very mutated builds must be weary. 
---
Funny I stopped playing ESO 2 years ago because I couldn't get anyone to play anymore. Beside PVP in eso is far different. You are not forced into it. You must either be in a pvp zone. Still I remember people complaining about nerfs and it was because of pvp that the nerfs even happened.
---
 That would be pretty cool.
---
I read a couple days ago that for some reason, they are only classified as beasts, not scorched (or both at the same time)
---
I forget where exactly it was, but it was a pretty tense location for me. It was one of those where I knew I was sort of getting ahead of myself and I should probably be a few levels higher before hitting this particular location. 
---
I'm approaching the end of the area, thinking I was pretty much home free. All of the sudden this guy pops out of stealth/chameleon right in front of me wearing a straight jacket and ritual mask and shouts "BOOO!!!" over the microphone. Reflexively I gave him both barrels of my bog standard shotgun. Then I hear the guy cracking up. 
---
After I changed underwear and took a shower, I can laugh at it looking back. But holy shitzu did that scare the bejeezus out of me. 
---
No problem, let me know if you need any extra bits. And it's the same as on here - Mawkalicious
---
Real money trading.
---
I'll join.
---
Actually, I had the exact materials combined in stash and on person. Only had 11 aluminium. Needed just 9, but when I put 9 more in the stash, it was enough and I could craft.
---
I'll have to check that distance when I get on. I'll probably end up having to move my camp over that way. Thanks for the info!
---
This absolutely kills games for me. It sounds neat in theory but in practice it just isn‚Äôt fun being unable to see the game you‚Äôre playing half the time. If they implemented something like this I‚Äôd be constantly server hopping for daylight or use ReShade to get rid of it or something.
---
That sells but weighs way more. I ignore that jazz and pick plants until I'm completely full. My carry weight goes up when my power armor comes off. I fast travel and sell. 
---
Boom, done for the day. I used that money to buy all the serums. I make those at cost for people.
---
Guys, I have figured out a way to access The developer room, I need 3 Other people, please whisper me.
---
Yes, and a "Bethesda" one too...
---
...oh you!
---
But give if you +10 energy Resistance doesn‚Äôt seem that good for a whole point
---
which is why 2 shot is getting nerfed...
---
Bioshock flashback
---
I didn't know it was a rare item, completely new to Fallout so didn't know the history. My first try of trying for one and I got one, every since then nothing.
---
Got it üò∫
---
The ladders in glassed cavern are also doors that you can "open" although they are not locked and don't actually do anything
---
It‚Äôs funny, this sub was created because the original one was just everyone bitching. This was supposed to be the ‚Äúit has some flaws but I like this game‚Äù sub. Then everyone got whiny and soft. I thought your picture was fun. 
---
SBs are SBs that's their category. Do not count as animals, creatures or Scorched.
---
To hunt the queen, a prime tse will do the trick even after the nerf. But if there are lots of players a prime anti armor explosive will perform better. 
---
Interesting so I wonder if the hunters effect would work
---
OP is probably talking about the officer uniform/underarmor, which isn‚Äôt exploited in.
---
Ah I see you found the abandoned "real fake doors!" Store.
---
It's fortunate the owner was one of the few individuals to feel no pain when the bombs dropped
---
Awwww. He's just a big teddy bear! 
---
I don't think explosive is the best for a .44, especially with the upcoming nerfs to it. What you want is a bloodied or anti armor Western revolver or a quad single action revolver. Maybe not the quad single action.
---
Very efficient.   I kind of think this is more in line with what Bethesda intended.
---
The trading system isn't really intuitive if you haven't used it before.
---
1)  Initiate trade
---
2)  Player selects item(s) from the player's inventory.
---
3)  The same player toggles the "offers only".
---
4)  WAIT.  DO NOT CANCEL.  
---
5)  The other player starts setting prices on things.  This takes time, and the item(s) you've selected will not be shown!
---
6)  After the prices are set, you will see them show up with prices next to them.
---
7)  Buy them.
---
Do a "thumbs up" emote.  If this is a regular trader, it's good practice to hop off the server at that time, so other players can get on their server to trade with them.
---
There shouldn‚Äôt be an atom shop period. I paid $60 for a full game. I got cut out items being resold at a THIRD of the game price. 
---
I think the ghoul pulled a bill cosby 
---
I made it for fun, I love the game, but I like memeing around too.
---
Phuck 
---
Every patch it's take take take. Taking this away, Taking that away, "Fixing" this or that that just takes something away. Crashing is the biggest problem.  Yes it's my fault I carry too much stuff around. I can barely play the game as it is. My Excavator and sometimes that extra 100 is lets me actually fast travel sometimes.
---
That's the proper pronunciation if you have a lisp
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll try that 
---
It's a good beta.
---
It's scripting language would handle it. Though, actually having the scripting language compile through something like LLVM would fix 90ish% of the problems the game has.
---
So many of the problems that fo76 has, is because the scripting language is real slow.
---
The nerf is to the 2shot not the explosive
---
i see what you did there!
---
Even more ridiculous than that... *VATS criticals* heal your entire team.
---
Who uses VATS with a bazookanuke?
---
Sure, why not. I just can‚Äôt believe some of these people are whining and telling you not to play because you OBVIOUSLY despise the game. 
---
It doesnt. SBs and the Queens are the carriers of the plague so arent affected with Zealot. Only prime receivers
---
You can‚Äôt steal supply crates though?
---
Thanks.  :)
---
It is not an option for me to level up on a crafting table
---
Lmao. That also killed me
---
They can only be found in them and there is random chance of getting on. They are not helpful at all its just a "Yeah Im really lucky!" kind of thing
---
Is that's what happens when more and more people show up, her armor gets tougher? In that case you are certainly right anti armor would be the way to go
---
HMU if you need help, same GT as my name here. Send me a txt
---
Agreed it seems whoever is approving the changes doesnt even play casually at all. 
---
On PC? 
---
I was skeptical of the "No human NPCs" thing when they first announced it. But I think adding them now would be a huge mistake. The concept of the only people I see are other actual players has grown on me.
---
Now if the Responders would just trust the robots with more than 200 caps a day....
---
What they need to do is just take a page from MMORPGs and just make a set of pvp stats and a set of pve stats. Boom problem solved. 
---
People have been trying to balance the two for a long time and it never works, you either buff too much and make one too easy or you nerf too much and make one too hard. There is no middle ground unless you take away bosses.
---
I wasn't trying to start a witch-hunt. I was just being smart as in a joke because of how many you had. I just thought 40,000 fusion cells sounded like a lot but as I said later, perhaps you had batteries included on. I guess you've really been waiting on good energy weapons to arrive since they suck right now. Sorry for being a dick if I was. I would just never carry that much ammo around unless it was for something like the minigun that eats up ammo with almost no return because of its low damage.
---
I have to let the game idle for a few minutes just after signing in. If I do anything at all, crash. I'm on XB1X. If I push buttons during a loading screen, crash. 
---

---
Damn servers full :(
---
I think you can summon a cargobot that carries the keycard in the white springs bunker
---
If only CAMP budget wasn't garbage, then I might feel more inclined to buy decorations I can't place because I have to choose between a nice looking house and turrets to stop molerats from eating my fusion generator.  
---
nope
---
My problem is that they have always ran out of caps long before I even get there...
---
They can put things in play that can stop it. Or at least not make it limitless. Going back to what I was thinking earlier they could take the base carry weight then add all the modifiers that someone could possibly have at one time and add a small percentage to that. After you hit that you can't pick anything up. That would cut down on the amount someone can have on a mule character. They could also set something up so that if a character hits some outrageous number of one item the account gets flagged just in case the person is duplicating items. 
---
That's adorable. First couple to find love in the wasteland &lt;3
---
They're painful to farm I end up shooting down the planes, then running around after the bot wasting ammo
---
Yeah, I obviously hate it so much, especially after spending all this time gathering the plans and putting effort into making something for the memes.
---
Watoga is good 3 PA can spawn in it +1 out by survey camp alpha

Ya

Same for me :( and when it is working its lagging in places

It's Nerf‚Ñ¢ or Nothing!

I can't get past the loading screen today. Yay.

This reply was discussing the "Mutant's" effect, not the "Mutant Slayer's".

Don‚Äôt bulk until you want to sell
---
Now go through it all and check was bulks to 10 / 15 / 20 ++
---
Those are **much** heavier than other items
---
Bulk cloth goes into 30 and weighs 1.5 each
---
agree with this!
---
You get t51 parts as a quest reward. Surface to Air, I think? They aren't half busted when you get them as regards. Most of the time the quest pops at a site with a chassis and power armor parts, too.
---
Server hops to find parts are a huge waste of time.

Where did he speak for anyone else other than himself? I guess you like others to speak for you, easily abused.

Yes it does create an infinite stash.  No shared stash necessary.

Where do you get the "one in ten" figure?
---
Mules have existed in every online game ever.
---
Im curious what youre doing for your VATS+crit build. 
---
Im running one right now, but im still working on improving dps because I run out of AP often, and my Quad Lever Gun doesnt have amazing damage( plain quad ammo capacity).
---
Im fully speced into PER for rifle dmg and concentrated fire, and a bunch into LUCK for crit damage and crit meter build time, etc
---
Also looking for legendary armour with AGI points and ap regen
---
How do you know you got banned for that exact reason ‚Äî simply being in possession of 5000 wood scraps?
---
PCMR with PTT :)
---
&gt;Is that's what happens when more and more people show up, her armor gets tougher
---
Yes, that is what happens. Even if the entire server joins you can still solo the sbq with an paae gun with bobbleheads, I often buy some explosive bobblehead to stack em up just in case that happens, if it covers what I earn in flux it's still viable 
---
What do you need that much wood for? 
---
He's yet to launch. Stay queued.
---
I'm sorry, I must have been mistaken. I swear I did it, but others on here are credible and say otherwise, and I believe they are right.

Helpful serum tips:

1. Unequip starched genes before you take the serum. (It won‚Äôt work)

2. Remember to re-equip it because

3. The only way to lose it is to take radaway or step into a radiation arch WITHOUT starched genes.

Oh yeah, there's a quest marker in there. It was really weird that the door was locked, but I guess it's semi-realistic.

Nice viewpoint maybe theyll rollback the nerf on tse. Since you dont care if its balanced.

What console?

I would say "Yes," but I have no idea how many other people also don't know what "yellowcake" really is.

What business is it of yours how much wood he has?
---
Not really as stated prior, most people just pop by and use your benches. Then again I'm lvl 120 something. So most people probably think I'm better equipped then I am. 
---
You mean Legendary weapons not damaging players and private servers would hurt this game? I mean that is what I wanted, but I'm sure you just assumed I want pvp removed. Game have been being marketed towards pvp players for a few years, so I have no Idea where you are coming from. I have never played a non-pvp game where weapons/armor  have been nerfed. So no I don't see how PVE players ruin a pvp players experience.
---
Does Obsidian actually own design assets from New Vegas? I would be surprised if that was the case but I guess it's possible. I would've figured Bethesda still owned all that since they own the franchise and just contracted Obsidian to develop the game. I could also see a situation where Bethesda would have to split revenue on anything made from Obsidian assets.

Mothman shop or something in Point Pleasant. The door in the bathroom leading down to the basement.

What would that look like?

So people can take a dump.... I geddit.

If it's Xbox I can help

Wrong they will all still drop

Not all of the time.  If a player shoots at you, their turrets automatically aggro on you.

In Eve Online you have a calculator and notepad built into the game. It seems like that is the kind of stuff we need in game to manage our inventory.
---
Good luck selling! :) good place to do it I guess.

Yeah, but the ghouls are inside. Outside you only get Scorched.
---
Sounds OP. Should nerf.

You are ignorant of the facts even with 2 shot exploding 50 cal it takes me about 1500 rounds with a team of 4 people attacking her. Know your facts before you try to present an argument

It will, this is just the start

Playing around with dev items sounds like a good way to get your account banned lol....

It works, I forgot to take mine off when I drank it.

My Thoughts? There's going to be another couple of Youtubers mocking Bethesda and it will be yet another failure on Bethesda to add to the rather long list.
---
All of them have Pockets and Deep Pockets.
---
Yeah, he could be roleplaying as a beaver for all we know.
---
At this point in the game I primarily PvE and can't see how two shot or explosive in their original form are good for the PvE content either. It makes the game too easy and makes certain builds obsolete. Neither of these are good for the game as far as PvE.
---
Especially since it doesnt flag people for pvp, so they can continue to use it.
---
I don‚Äôt even bother bulking because I hoard plastic like it‚Äôs going out of fashion, I toss anything that I don‚Äôt have a use for, leaving at least 125 of the item 
---
I have one pa in the box, no aid, Ive one or two pieces of ore, I‚Äôve about 200 gunpowder and I‚Äôve a couple of legendary weapons that I may use if I decide to swap my build (currently have a kind of stealth sniper thing with decent melee capability because in the early game I used nothing but melee) and when I do spring cleaning I normally have about 350-380 in my stash and the large majority of it is junk 
---
In a way I like how the game forces me to prioritise and organise but at the end of the day we need a much higher stash limit, well into the thousands, id go as far as even saying unlimited. This is a fallout game at the end of the day fallout players like to hoard shit they find, even if they‚Äôll never use them. In fo4 I kept every legendary weapon or armour I got because each of them told a small little story of what enemy I fought to obtain them. This is something that sadly lacks in 76 and I feel it will negatively impact the game in the long run. 
---
My thoughts on it are no one should be in the dev room. It's like walking into an employees only room and looking private information when you don't work there
---
I think a middle finger emote might be too much to ask (though I do think we need one) We also need a "Moon" emote". If somebody says "This is a family game" I am going to throw up. A middle finger is a no-no but decapitation and shooting things into bloody chunks is ok?
---
Or, if your friends have the plan, usually they will make them for free.
---
They don't take a lot of materials.
---
That would be a great idea. Although this would lead to me shitting myself everytime I walk into someones C.A.M.P and see a wendigo face staring back at me 
---
If you look at vehicles with your reticle you can see their health bar in a white (non-hostile) color, just like Camp objects. Once they take damage past a certain point their health rapidly plummets and they explode once they reach zero.
---
There‚Äôs also the red warning directional indicator but yeah, that doesn‚Äôt come up soon enough or they drain too quickly to explode.
---
Best to glance at vehicle health when moving near one.

Or ‚Äúfucking dick!‚Äù!

&gt;Depends on what u mean. Without Starched Genes any mutation will be deleted by **removing the rads with any item or through any method.**
---
No. Removing rads with rad sponge does not remove mutations. Also, respawning will remove some of your rads without removing mutations.
---
Trust me, I wish you were right. I was hoping I was missing some dumb little step when trying to craft it.
---
Updated. Thanks for letting me know :)
---
Anybody who has even touched one of those will likely get banned.  It has a unique item ID, and Bethesda has apparently cranked up logging on the servers.  They will find out.. it's just a matter of time.
---
The great irony is that the person using the phrase has no idea where it comes from apparently or why it was popularized.

These are the people who‚Äôve used this phrase because of its criminal and racist origins and the dog whistle it means.

sorry i forgot to mention its on pc
---
Probaly. But not many ppl know about it either and it really hasnt been mentioned much outside of closed forums. Stuff like this when attention is brought to it is usually fixed pretty quickly.
---
A bit harshly put. But I agree that one should be careful about claiming to speak for others.

Connected only to tell me couldn‚Äôt place my camp and then disconnected me again..

Sorry cant help yoy then
---
You are correct. What people dont realize is that this is the beginning.  
---
Did it need nerfed? Sure, but they coukd have simply stopped demo expert perk from stacking damage on it and the nerf woukd have dropped the damage considerably.  
---
Once its nerfed, you will 100s of posts and complaints about one shot melee users and that will be the next nerf. It will be a never ending cycle as people are always going to complain about the next meta.  
---
Those who fail to realize this are in for a rude awakening when their builds get nerfed into the ground. 
---
What he said
---
stop feeding the troll.  they just get a taste for manflesh that way
---
I'll add you and help a bit later, I can craft all right weapons for ya. It's pretty much a problem until lv45ish so you can get TSE, but now they're gonna nerf the two shot prefix, I mean it sucks, but the explosive part is a huge aspect of it too. 
---
I put it harshly because as a person who‚Äôs been a victim of people utilizing the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù slogan, I am tired of people using it as a weapon.  
---
I‚Äôm biracial and have been the victim of racists (in Kentucky) my entire life, and this is one of the typical mindless slogans they employ.  It‚Äôs not used outside of this.
---
That is needed so much too. 
---
Thanks for the suggestions u/MylesH55.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the graphics card. Unfortunately a clean install cant be done by *experience*, since it needs to "see" the physical hardware in order to install a driver.  Its purpose is like an updater.
---
Just before your post I did a registry fix with CCleaner. There were some minor fixes, but nothing important. I guess I have to go the long road and find my win7 copy, in order to make this fix proper. No peripherals were changed in the past year or so to my rig. 
---
Game is installed on a 500gb 850 SSD. Yes I admitt it was pretty full. Before running Checkdisk, I deleted 40gb of space, but I think I can free up some more. 
---
OS is installed on three 500gb NVMe 950 samsungs at RAID0. To lay everything on the table, Intel Rapid Storage Technology indicates a SMART event at one of the disks. But this doesn't worry me anymore since it first appeared, and I've found out that NVMe's -not to mention NVMes in RAID- and SMART do not work together and usually SMART flags events wrongfully. 
---
I will eventually try to uninstall the game and install it to a second 500gb SSD that I have. 
---
IMO It screams that the culprit is F76, but we all are trying to blame something else.
---
Make sure all of the materials are in your stash. This happened to me with X01 and after putting the materials in my stash it worked.
---
Honestly, it's not worth it. It comes up slowly and the target marking doesn't last very long. It was better-balanced in FO4 but it sucks in 76. Use a regular scope.
---
forgot to mention that sorry :P

We all secretly want to be the small spoon.

dam well then im ps4.. 
---
I haven't observed this behavior, although I do encounter the occasional lvl.1 eye bot that hasn't yet received the update. Obviously Watoga has server problems of its own. ;-) 
---
What I can give you is that maybe the high level players in there were AFK, and the low level ones had the Last Laugh plus explosives perk cards equipped. And I don't even wanna know what five players were doing in there... Most of the time if it's two players in there, one of them goes aggro. Just yesterday, one player tried to sneak melee kill me and ended up killing himself when he shook hands with my reactive plates.
---
np, ty :)
---
We‚Äôre you the guy who made massive penises at work shops out of wood?üòÇüòÇ
---
You say that now, but what happens when you've spent all of your virtual earnings and then they finally release something you genuinely want?
---
Hmmm, that's interesting, totally thought the complaint was from PVE players complaining about the proliferation of TSE weapons being used to 1 shot other players, even through slap damage.  This has also lead to alot of griefing of players who take no interest in PVP activities.  So it was NOT in fact the PVP community that asked for this..... just saying
---
If you got banned for wood I would absolutely appeal that. Remember that it's likely an automated system doing this, so if it catches something like wood(literally the most abundant resource in the game) I would imagine they would let you play again.
---
No launch yet

Thanks! The garage was actually a last minute addition. I wanted to find a way to expand the house down the slope, and it just so happened that ladder was able to reach down far enough from the side to attach another set of floors to. 
---
The lights inside the garage run off the same switch the door does, so until the switch is on and the door opens, its completely dark inside.

As a retired US soldier I would like to know if you are talking about civilian or actual military. [The 670-1] (http://www.hcdmag.com/ar-670-1/army-insignia/army-us-flag-insignia/) has always said the flag should be facing Stars first as if advancing forward. This goes back to symbolizing March into battle as early as the [civil war](https://amp.businessinsider.com/why-the-american-flags-on-military-uniforms-are-reversed-2016-10)
---
Wow, great discovery. Must be hidden away in some place that isn't constantly filled with people farming XP and legendary ghouls.
---
I know, it‚Äôs because I only watched a video on it than reading it so I must have heard wrong. 
---
this as well as opening up your stash for a second the servers are stupid to the point that it doesnt register that you have the materials in your stash so its just trying to use what you have on you
---
I like the style they picked, I'd rather they stick with it and flesh it out than abandon ship on it. 
---
I really don't miss npcs though. I thought they were cheesy and just not worth the time it took to them all. I think 76 took a step in the right direction for fallout and I really don't care how butthurt the role playing community is about it lol
---
Thanks for clarifying. I was trying to simplify to get to the Rad X comment because I thought that was the most important part. But yes there are a few work around like you mentioned.
---
You beleive that they have looked at specific item ID's. If so thats pretty smart.
---
The fact that you are paying to view exploit forums and claiming that it's for research sounds like a load of bullshit. 
---
I've got no respect for chicken little posts trying to trigger frenzies about fringe incidents either.

Just found this out myself, and what a heartbreak it was when I took a 50. receiver and a recon scope off a hunting rifle to find out I can't even put it onto my other rifle, FeelsBadMan

I'm sure I can, Calyber
---
You mention the dupes and that's what has lead to this issue. Those guns were never meant to be standard issue, certainly not this early in the game. Going forward Beth had the choice of balancing the gun or balancing content around the gun. I think they made the right choice, but the execution is poor. I think that separating TS an E would be better.
---
&gt;Perk cards are meant to make our weapons more powerful, we are supposed to be able to play this game solo remember, if we choose. It should not take 1000 bullets to kill a scorchbeast. The only way to combat the bullet sponge enemies is to get better weapons and fully upgrade damage perks. 
---
Just to address that part, you're right that perks and better weapons are the way to deal with high level content, but TSE basically removes the perks part. I know that some people build their perk loudout around the fact that TSE allows you to have fewer damage perks and still be competetive, basically giving you free special points. A well adjusted perk loadout can do just fine with crafted weapons, let alone other legendaries. Some people will have to start managing their inventories better, drop weight reduction perks, and put more into damage.

didn't have any problem today; yesterday I got 3 disconnect.

Loaded in and crashed like 4 times within 5mjn and called it a night last night. I‚Äôm just going to wait until the fix the game up a bit

ill add u

I know right! Its seems you get opposite of your build all the time.

Yeah, you cant even fast travel there. It clearly tells you, You cannot fast travel to forbidden areas!

Nice man thanks for being such a giant asshole. I hope it made you feel good.

Yep.. definitely.  I don't have a clue as to how they are actually doing it, but a simple log entry for each transaction would not be very hard to do (albeit, very expensive).

I do the same thing with vertibot grenades in closed areas. It freaked some friends out the other night and got a good reaction of ‚Äúposting up‚Äù in a little hallway. Lol.

I'm at 30, i saw a very cool camp in the lower part of the map (noticed two ppl above 100 standing a long time in a remote area and explored)
---
After a visit, they come back,  there where three instrument (well tuned), they started to play and invited me to join. Unfortunately i was stuck in my PA (could nor exit) but i took a picture. 
---
Once i left i saw a paper bag outside with a nice lvl 50 piece of armor. 
---
Thanks for the gift, whoever you are.

I never even went there, nor would I get my main account involved in anyway if I did. 
---
Don't care. On console its a none issue

When I found the lawn flamingos plan I actually cried

You just asked for software specific information on how they could track exploits.
---
You are an obvious exploiter.
---
I definitely responded to this shit hours ago but apparently it was removed. Probably because my foul fucking mouth. 
---
I want an increase and would pay for an increase if they don't want to give it to everyone. 
---
Good though. It gives me +50hp. Took myself down to 42 hp while I had the +50hp well fed buff. Waiting for it to expire now and see if I die. 
---
I agree they really should have just separated the modifiers. Rolled back existing tse weapons to be one or the other. 
---
And agree as well about perks making explosive guns more powerful. The explosive part was already doing that. 
---
I‚Äôve tried all of them 15 times on the dot each but no luck I‚Äôm also level 50 so idk if that has anything to do with it
---
I saw two higher levels a bit apart on the golf course.  I walked over, waved and went on my way (cool camps!).  As I walked away, I got a swarm of ghouls and a wendingo - I could've taken them individually, but they were all around me, not sure how I missed them!  One of the higher levels came to my rescue, then gave me a 1* Grognak axe - which I've been looking for (long time Dwarf fan - and my AXE!).  Many hearts were thrown. 
---
Just before I logged off, I saw a government drop nearby, so I went for it.  It had a lock, which I hadn't seen before - guess who's got a 10c bounty?  Fast traveled to my camp and got a visitor shortly after.  They let me scrap and dump to my stash, then put me out of my misery.  Again - hearts all around!
---
I'm guessing my ammo and stim drops are helping my in-game karma, but I proceed cautiously - waves and thumbs up all around.  I actually wish there was a peace sign to show pacifist!

Funny how scorchedbeasts defeated all the other factions by bombing without landing, or using minions. But when facing the mighty vault dwellers they submit to ground combat and refusing to retreat even when pounded by AAs and Nuclear fire. Just let sleeping fallout scorchbeasts (skyrim dragons) lie.
---
Now if Bethesda adds wraping paper like world of warcraft did, then they might actually be able to hide it from this software.
---
Damn, pretty interesting.
---
What if they get every recipe that is already in the game, exclusively and no others, using it to gain access only to every released recipe, how does bethesda track that.
---
I would guess they could track how you received it, potentially?
---
Other accounts you've "acquired" are fair game though huh?
---
Cant tell if Stukov, SCP Foundation, Futurama or Halo Flood advice...
---
While a lot of people are high level, there is a lot to do when low level; you do not need to engage with them, and most of the time they won't engage with you; and when they engage, they will most of the time help by giving out weapons, ammo, chems...

Remember that it is not Fallout 5. It is a different kind of games (if you've played previous Fallout games).

TSE was broke I have a level 45 pump shotgun it would 1 or 2 shot everything with 0 perks to support the gun. Due to fact nurf isnt out yet I cant tell you if it was to big of a nurf or to little of one. However I do want a end game, i feel like a max level TSE shotgun should 1 shot just about anything if your wearing every single damage perk that would support and I mean no wiggle room in passing up perks that buff its damage. If you sink 1000+ hours into this game to get the optimal setup possible you should be godly and swinging your dick around like a boss. But due to fact that duping went insane the end game perfect rolled items that very few should have everyone has so your seeing the effects of that. If your talking about how TSE would 1 shot why your in passive mode that's also due to dupers stacking tons of bobble heads and not just the gun its self.
---
No they weren't.
---
I've killed her multiple times long before TSE was everywhere. 
---
She has insanely high explosive resistance, so unless you were bobblehead stacking the explosive portion of your damage was doing essentially nothing. 
---
Correct, explosive bait is for the Trappers part of the quest line, and making friends with a Deathclaw is for the Diehards. 
---
I'm all for this.
---
Damn dupers and pocketed armor exploiters still making the perfect servers unstable.
---

---
Yeah I'm in waiting for the launch
---
Good insight, i know characters ive started since,(310 hrs= A lvl. 82, 32, 18, 8&amp;8) have been to a lot of Toxic Valley spots just to check and nothing gets marked in the challenge panel!
---
Some recipes already use purified water, and I hope that new ones with possibly items from the plant experiment shelter will use it too.
---
&gt;Do you happen to have a Power Armor helmet with Targeting HUD equipped?
---
I do. Is that known to cause problems? First time I've seen this mentioned. But I had this mod equipped for a long time, certainly long before the latest patches. PS4 btw.
---
Console im afraid which tmk these issues are more pronounced on my system of (not quite) choice, a minor workaround i've found is to basically clear out my inventory down to like 95 cw to prevent dc from loading, find a low pop server, etc, once you get to the actual launch sequence (ie just punch the card and go) it finally cp's but till then, just a gamble
---
Event or buy them I think
---
How about we let them finally fix server stability especially around nuke zones before ya‚Äôll go begging for things that increase instability. Seriously though. You can‚Äôt play the game like old fallouts. Gotta make tough choices and stick with them. Find a build and stick with it. Make a second character and transfer items to him for different builds. Etc etc etc. 
---
I did that thinking i had to be friends with a deathclaw  lmao
---
You should have obtained the plans when you loaded the game disc in.
---
Glitch, OR MARKETING SC(AM)HEME?!
---
No, you clearly didn't.  When you place them, you can pick them right up again.
---
Check the Fallout 76 game case.
---
Wow dude, you are literally fishing for holes in their tracking methods.
---
We still doing this?
---
They're already doing that flag thing now if you read their post from yesterday or the day before. 
---
I personally think that move speed should degrade per 100 lbs overweight by 25% until at 400 lbs overweight you're forced to stand still. That would stop people from using infinite stash mules and still allow for people to pick up plenty of stuff and not make using their main characters a pain in the ass. After all, if you can't move, you can't get to a stash after spawning in, doesn't matter where you log your toon out.
---
I have both perks in Strength and Endurance (Endurance perk not maxed) and with mutations, I have more resistances than a Excavator PA.
---
5,000 wood
---
1,000,000 steel, lead, gunpowder, ammo .. etc.
---
I see what you did there, you're not foolin' me!
---
Same, but I read on someone's post that it would fix it by not using it. I stopped using mine and it stopped crashing constantly I too am on ps4. 
---
Marine Tactical Helmet:
---
1 fiberglass

1 plastic
---
3 rubber
---
With Had Bargain, lvl 3: 28 caps. 
---
Eh I have the digital version of Fallout 76
---
Not even slightly. 
---
I don't think they will add them in Appalachia.
---
That said if they ever add in new land to explore outside of Appalachia then the chances of npc appearing is higher.
---
I‚Äôm just glad these dailies and weeklies are counting! But stuff like that, even though i have like 10-15 doubles that i cant relearn, i know for that particular one i‚Äôm in like 5/76 rn!!!
---
Would u happened to know what event and/or vender
---
Yeah, no problem. You deserve it! 
---
Level means nothing, honestly. After level 50 further levels do not give you any extra stats or special points past what you already have.
---
Also, now would be the best time to get it with fixes going out on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. Get or find a few friends and enjoy yourself. Take it at a pace you're comfortable with, there's no end game race.
---
No one will really mess with you in the game and there are ways to get away from those who do.
---
Nah man free xp not worthless at all
---
I'll never get that kinda system. Idk maybe I'm naive but I would just ask my costumer/player base what kind of items they'd like to be added and then make that. What's the point in making stuff that maybe they like but most people don't want to buy? 
---
Well shit... There goes my joke..... 
---
It said it added you, but i don't see you online.
---
Well fed and temp endurance from chems/booze will kill you or swapping equipment with it. So be careful with +end on weapons
---
No sorry 
---
Nothing stopping you from playing solo now. 
---
There is no issue, it was used to develop the game; there are already measures put in the game to deal with hackers. Not only that but Bethesda has now made it clear that they will not tolerate glitch abusers or people using hacks and they are cracking down. Let these morons get banned if they want; they will be missing out on years of future content for this game that they will not get to experience.
---
Yes! Same for real!
---
I would like it. More players in the community would be nice
---
What if the server is on fire?
---
It is impossible to one shot people in pacifist mode. This has been debunked over and over again. Use the search function.
---
We can dream.
---
Ok I have tried google and youtube no luck
---
If you want to turn this into a witch hunt good for you, but all I really am doing is trying to have a civil discussion, if that is to much for you maybe you should take a break and come back later.
---
Why shouldnt legendary weapons damage players? Itd be fairly clunky to have two loadouts, one for pve and one for pvp. 
---
Many games have been pvp focused, but the open world games have been absolute trash. There hasnt been a good sandbox/openworld pvp since like mortal online which is a buggy mess
---
You forget that this game set out to be pve and pvp. It was known and expected that stuff would be balanced for pvp. Thats part of what we signed up for. 
---
If you're on xbox, would you consider selling the super sledge? 
---
I call this guy pee shooter gaming. He is most likely a duper or actually just gets duped items from his duper friends, promotes a website where you can spend real money on caps and begs for patreon support. Please don‚Äôt follow him or support him in any way. 
---
No chems or booze active. I have had it happen on weapon swap, but neither weapon I am using has any special stats. 
---
3* drooping 1* items
---
Not all of the exploits- just the board dupe method
---
We already know that they can track players that enter the QASmoke cell (if that's what it's even called in this game).  Characters that do that are already marked and have been getting bans.
---
As far as recipes, if they manage to hand off the recipes they find, and EVERY recipe is actually obtainable in the game, then they will still get nailed, but whomever gets them will likely be fine.  It's the ones that are NOT obtainable that catch attention faster.
---
We also know that spamming certain commands catches attention as well.  If your character manages to get all of those recipes (again, assuming all of them are legitimately obtainable), and then proceeds to learn each of them one-by-one, it will raise eyebrows.
---
Again - I don't know exactly how they are doing things.. just throwing darts out of my ass guessing on how they could likely do it.
---
People run from me (level 126) and usually I am there to drop supplies or just see what they are building and if I can help. 
---
Plus neverending load screens that are counted as deaths if you close the application manually, this happens maybe once a day now. From one of those I recovered with an empty 'junk' tab. Great times. 
---
Only not. Fix this!
---
The real issue is that duping is still going on, What if they dupe instant kill items?
---
One way to get a little lead in your dietüòÇ
---
Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes. 
---
Maybe you can help me.  
---
I've been trying to take this workshop for 2 days.  
---
It keeps saying I'm unable because enemies are near by.  
---
There is literally no one around, ive shot chickens, squirrels, rastags, in the lake area.  Killed the super mutants in the middle, nothing has worked.   
---
Any ideas on what im missing here? 
---
i see u online join me 
---
What‚Äôs the punchline?
---
Shit I had totally forgotten about that meme 
---
Totally wholesome intentions, gotcha.
---
I went back and checked for myself only the nuka colas were there seems they just don't respawn.
---
Excuse me, but my incredibly high accidental suicide rate was one other reason for me. ;)
---
Then you are building wrong, if TSE is the only thing you think can kill her. Ive killed her plenty with no TSE in the group handley might i add. 
---
I crash to desktop all the fucking time now. I also found a way that I force a crash. This morning I was playing and had very little bit of rads just enough to see a sliver of red on the hp bar. I go to use a rad away because why not and it crashed my game. Curious I tried it 2 more times and each time it crashed. I walked into the river next to my base and got around 1/8 of my hp bar full of rads then used the rad away and it worked without crashing. This game is weird.
---
Do you have your liquor license for the state of West Virginia? Can't have illegal bars operating in my jurisdiction. You'll also need to serve food if you serve hard liquor.
---
One of the Whitesprings vendors sell the plan for the Whitesprings trash can as well as other Whitesprings-styled stuff. 
---
if we were older
---
Yeah I randomly drop dead too sometimes at low-life I have it happen regardless of nerd rage though. Mostly I just don't carry junk now lol
---
You probably took too long for his taste 
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a bug. I couldn‚Äôt pick them up because I was stuck in the HUDless power armor entering animation. I was overencumbered so I couldn‚Äôt fast travel away and had to switch servers.
---
They've been dropping for me like crazy. Can't get a decent legendary to save my life.
---
I need the green one not the black one
---
Game case is the trash-can holding the plans, which is the game. 
---
What if what if what if.
---
What if you actually had a point worth discussing?
---
Really? Dang.  I thought it was only in the workshop.
---
cos too many people choose to follow the masses on youtube and hate without experiencing it themselves
---
Mod one of each, test them all out. Make your decision then. It's really up to preference and play style. I prefer more ammo capacity so I don't mind taking a slight hit in dps so I don't have to wait as often, lol.
---
Go out to i think its west tech.. where a bunch of mutants are.. vials of toxic goo all over the place.. 
---
By making legendries not damage players, it would be more about skill, less about gear. I thought this is what pvp players wish to achieve, so they can say that they are the more skilled player.
---
I fuckin' love running across other players camps. They're either neat to check out or I can leave gifts behind if its a wooden shack.
---
It's clearly a statement posed as a question since it is questionable why you would think there needs to be an emote when there is already a perfectly suitable emote in the game.
---
I don't even play with sound, since I only play at work..
---
I totally get it cause I feel the same way but I had claimed Lakeside Cabin last night (idk if it‚Äôs really a contested Workshop or not, I would assume so as it has lead) and had multiple high level players stop by, say hi, hang out a bit and leave. Most people are friendly, I‚Äôve only encountered one dick in 50 hours of play. 
---
Huh. Maybe I didn't check all week. Coulda sworn it was still .10
---
Getting mad at a video game and telling someone to fuck themselves is a horrible example for your wife to be setting for your child. Your wife needs to grow up and behave like an adult.
---
Pippinramon level 126 always willing to help 
---
Game has real problems with multiple PA chassis.
---
There's effectively no difference in power post 50. Often the only thing that changes is small tweaks to someone's build and stronger legendary drops.
---
1001?
---
Ohh, ok. Yeah, that's kinda crummy. Kinda really crummy. 
---
I want more stuff like the vampire outfit
---
Just slightly less expensive
---
I had the same problem, and I never found the culprit. I was running laps around the whole damn property.  I ended up leaving and logging in again to a new server. Haven't had the problem since. 
---
They already made armor stands for Fallout 4 so they just need to flip the asset into 76 like they've done with half of the Atom Shop
---
They must have changed that in the last patch or 2. You used to be able to go back there every 3-4 days and find another Nuka Cola Plan.
---
Problem is thats a bandage solution to a deeper problem of it being skill based. You really cant just make players immune to some types of weapons in a game like this. I get what youre going for but it would really cheapen the experience
---
They are each the best at something. Double barrel has the highest damage and fast firing speed but is only two shots and least accurate, pump (at least to me not entirely sure if it is true) seems to have the best range and accuracy, but has a slower fire rate and longer reload, and combat is in between the others with damage, range, and accuracy, but can be fired automatically and has the highest shell capacity.
---
If you are using it for close range when enemies see you I would probably go combat shotgun. You can also get an armor piercing mag if you want for it
---
Bethesda has a system now made and ingame that tracks huge dupe stacks and duped items specifically from the dev room. Players abusing glitches are soon going to be something of the past and players who continue to do so will be removed forever from the game.
---
I thought you had to sign into a server?
---
I got one I will sell you 1,200 Caps. Gt themisterphenix 
---
I just bought the garage door. Now I need a switch 
---
It's rng, run some workshops, pretty sure I get them regularly from workshop events and keep checking vendors. Probably not a specific place you can look. 
---
What platform you on ?
---
Broken overpowered crap is a problem no matter how common it is.
---
People probably wouldn't have complained enough to get it fixed this quickly without the duping making it so common, but it was still absolutely stupid how strong those effects were. 
---
Yeah they are for the most part. Run into a bad guy once in a blue moon. But imagine if the game was..........free üíÄ
---
We feel your pain; same for us.
---
Rolling pins?
---
(Elmer Fudd‚Äôs gof cub is fuwious!)
---
I mean, simple answer that infinite people have suggested:
---
PvP only servers. 
---
Damn! I‚Äôve never seen any. Any advice on how to get these mods? Do I just have to hope they come up in shops?
---
Exactly, or relogging.  I had about 14 on me and it seemed I was set for lift.  Then came the 'fix'.  Now I'm down to 4 and the thought of going through this game **without** PA and having to deal with the bullshit combat mechanics and bullet sponge mobs has me ready to just stop playing.
---
No, it really should not, not unless they add a limit of 3 mutations. Mutations are way OP when you stack multiples already, no need to make them even more OP.
---
I think the pseudorandom seed uses something in your character setup (name, appearance, whatever) -- noticed that I *always* find one leg of the power armor last, for example. 
---
Honestly you need to worry more about low levels being at your camp. Not sure what other people's experiences are, but any time my camp was attacked/blown up, it has always been a low level. High levels just show up, look around, maybe use stuff inside, give a thumbs up, and leave. There are people who are high level who are assholes, but most of them are nice and will give you stuff :)
---
It would be better for sure if the PvP balance was separated from PvE, however the explosive nerf was needed even outside of PvP and as someone who own explo guns and mainly play PvE I 100% endorse Bethesda decision.
---
Here's few reasons why it was a good move :
---
* First thing for sure it hurts the duppers, +90% of TSE weapons most likely are dupe and making these weapons less good is a good move.
---
* It's overpowered, it ain't right to OHKO most max leveled enemies in an online game just because you have a good weapon and invested merely 5 perk pts out of 49 on your build.
---
* It's healthy to have build diversity in online game (and especially in a fallout one) by having more than 1 or 2 "best builds" oriented torward more than 1 or 2 rolls of "best weapons".
---
* Explosive effect outclass by really, really really far every other "major effects" you can have on a legendary weapon, making everything else irrelevant.
---
* And lastly, even outisde of PvP it's not good design in an online game to create a huge gap between players dmg because of RNG or grinding, a lvl 50 player with min maxed build &amp; a max level weapon shouldn't deal only 1/4 of the dmg someone deals with a explo weapon on i.e. the SBQ.
---
It ain't a solo game, PvE must be balanced too. I recommand you try Fo4, toggle god mode and spawn an explosive weapon then OHKO all NPCs in the game if that's your thing.
---
Probably the same way a .308 hunting rifle does more damage than a .50 sniper rifle.
---
Well currently I (level 70 and weaponsmith 5) cannot repair my hunting rifle/recon sniper. Anything else that can be of influence?
---
I think blocker can replace the strength one since I‚Äôll be up close and I‚Äôll throw a couple in the endurance one
---
I agree with this I've done it a dozen or so times and the first time it took me a while to do it but now I can complete it in about 20 minutes the end objective I get a total of about 10 robots not counting the ones already in the command room.
---
If anything it's just a pain to do.
---
I am on PS4
---
I thought you quit playing 52 days ago?
---
I never duped once but had a few TSE weapons. Got banned today. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt take forever for my appeal. 
---
Yeah like Mirelurk Alpha Queen near thunder mountain and crevasse dam, mothman hives in the few places you can nuke in the forest, snallygaster swarm in the toxic valley, mole miner bosses that come from the collapsed mines opened by the nuke, and keep just massive ghoul hordes in the savage divide
---
Where did you get your fireplace?
---
Would it be cool if the police uniform had a radio and let folks use voice chat in a larger area?
---
It recently started happening to me as well, it only works when I join from the main screen and not from in game. 
---
Thank you for you opinion it's noted
---
Assuming you can HOLD those plants.
---
Nice! Thanks for the heads up!
---
Whotespring is the best
---
Still a good weapon. Add the speedy mod, you'll love it.
---
Thanks for the heads up! u/Caramis
---
If you want a Lvl 50 one, add shiningQuasar.  It's a cool weapon that's great at eating up a common type of ammo, but I've mostly been using it to clear out Charleston and it doesn't fit my build well enough to justify the small amount of weight.  I'd take 100 caps for it, but honestly, I'd also settle for a drug plan I don't have or five or so Whiskeys.
---
Any takers yet?
---
I've said the same thing myself. I bought a game key for $40 the day of release so I don't feel too ripped off and I have a group of friends that I play with. There area lot of issues, sure, but I've had fun playing it with a group and I don't think it's SO broken that it's unplayable.
---
Yeah same. 
---
Never duped but was given duped items. Got banned today. 
---
You do realize most who have mutations use starch Gene's which makes this idea obsolete correct?
---
I don't think they understand what expression the Excuse me what the fuck expression in conveying.
---
That sorta thing happened to me but it was a fridge door, when I opened it, it went through the floor. 
---
I was like 55 when I got mine in Welch.  Lever Gun is the name.
---
I prefer combat shotgun due to the big magazine and high rate of fire. Its range is terrible though.  They are all pretty bad but the pump can have surprising range on it.
---
What was the real point of this post?
---
Please stop my head hurts
---
The power armor with the Christmas lights was cool even though it was cheesy
---
I play a similar game as you and let me say.. That when all hell is breaking loose, i highly suggest the combat shotgun.
---
Theres nothing worse than having an enemy breathing in your face after a botched assassination.. And youre stuck reloading a shell at a time.
---
If youre going for shotgun as a backup, get it suppressed and make it a combat variant. :)
---
Good to know. Thanks for testing that.
---
That's actually a good idea and unless it was a bug they already slow you down to a walking speed after you have so much weight. Bethesda can do something to prevent mule characters or at least from them having a lot of weight. If they do that and figure out how to do a shared stash that doesn't cause server issues then I can't see any reason not to have one. Even if it's only 100 pounds or less. Just something for solo players to move an item or 2 to a different character that would work better for it instead of the one it dropped on. 
---
How do you give specific mutations?
---
If they‚Äôd add Veteran Ranger Armor/Riot Gear, I‚Äôd buy those in a heartbeat. 
---
Um that last link goes to a 3 hour video of a stream... I feel lied to.
---
I have done the same thing. 
---
Yes, but in practice you can pretty much play without encountering other players if you choose to. 
---
I've literally been running around Well Fed and then pumping Psychobuff and I've never had this happen.
---
And yes, I'm certain I'm Well Fed for sure because I eat a bunch of melon right after the Psychobuff until the food and water are topped off.
---
I just dropped the rifle one this morning
---
I mean, it'd be more like PvP than grieving.
---
Attacking with the syringer would still initiate PvP since it always does at least 5 damage.
---
I served in the military for 10 years, I know the decorum. In war time, colors advance. In peace time, colors retreat.
---
I'm not sure but doesn't it get a boost afterwards or am I wrong? I honestly can't remember. 
---
I'm interested if you still have it.
---
"TSE weapon found in Developer Room"
---
Fixed
---
Atom shop.
---
Uranium Fever event. I have also heard that The General‚Äôs Steakhouse in the cranberry bog as well as West Tek in the savage divide have guaranteed legendary spawns. Also if you nuke monongah it can spawn a lot of legendaries... probably as much as whitespring.
---
Personally for my sniper build since pipe bolt action gains damage from gunslinger I use pipe bolt action sniper as my primary and an anti armor explosive 10mm is my planned to be secondary soon as I can find one 
---
Look around on the trading subreddits. There‚Äôs players who‚Äôll make them for cheap/free if you provide materials. 
---
I just mean, you could sabotage other plays without intention for pvp. Either that, or the effects would only initiate after pvp has been initiated, which might defeat the purpose.
---
Uranium fever is an 8 minute event that practically guatentees 3. It usually drops junk legendaries, but its a great steel/concrete/shotgun shell farm too
---
The question mark emote ,"???" Also known as the confused emote is often used for that context.
---
Screenshots or it didn't happen...  
---
I've got multiple mules with literally hundreds of thousands of steel, etc, all collected and horded because I'm a pack rat, and both am skeptical and curious about the validity of this claim.  
---
Now if you had 5,000 wood, and 299 boards, I think we all know why you were banned.
---
Seems a lot of people are in a similar boat. I spend my atoms freely however, so I am in a skiff of my own 
---
Mutant Karma Syringe Rounds: APPROVED
---
I suppppppose that wouldn't be so bad.
---
I already avoid other players enough as it is XD
---
Armor and apparel dye stations.  Craft dyes from plants or junk and color your things much like eso. Perhaps even use all those paint buckets to paint my house?
---
Who ever comes along gonna be like damn people are so nice on here community is great 
---
You lie. There are currently two ways to be banned mass producing items in the hundreds (sadly it includes ammo) and going into the dev room.   
---
If they were to ban people for having thousands of items many people would be banned due to mules. That would be to large of a headache for them to process and stand more to lose than gain.   
---
So thirsty bitch ass liars like you can get the fuck out, we don't need your kind. 
---
As a medic main I'm into this. 
---
Well their breath attack is either fire or explosive case with the fireproof perk and the dense mod they no longer hurt me with their breath
---
If in your opinion the game sucks to the extreme, why are you wasting your time and resources playing it instead of finding another game to buy?
---
I'm honestly curious, this isn't a rhetorical question. 
---
Sorry, PS4, but more importantly, I don't have it anymore: left it in the register at the Watoga Train station. Hope somebody grabbed it!
---
ŒëœÖœÑŒ¨ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ 
---
You heard of bobblehead exploits?
---
Yep. Just killed a level 50s (I‚Äôm level 40) who where crashing my base cause he was salty I beat him at PVP
---
You've got pretty much 4 options:
---
- Hope it drops with the mods you want
---
- Find the mods in shops
---
- Find the plans in shops
---
- Scrap loop
---
Scrap loop is pretty much build the cheapest part you can and scrap it. Each scrap has a chance of unlocking a mod.
---
If they bother me enough, I just block for session. Only had to do it 3 times
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt even pick up her drops most of the time anymore. This is the big main legendary boss of their entire game and her loot isn‚Äôt even worth grabbing. What a disappointment.
---
There's serums that give specific mutations, you can either buy them or craft them
---
Thanks.  
---
I hoped my new log in today would have fixed it. 
---
Guess I'll just hop until it works.  
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
Night vision power armour
---
Then thats the problem, not tse. Bobblehead exploits are being used on melee as well. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt even move yesterday when I logged in. All I could do was open the menu screen and map. 
---
I'm so pissed can you imagine the amount of adhesive i waa gonna get over my 4 hour play session
---
I'll come to your party rambo
---
Xbox parties
---
Just waiting for Anthem, baby ‚ù§
---
Guilty as charged, I may have dropped down the Atoms to buy it... ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You‚Äôre correct. I actually found him when I was forming a list of youtubers that abuse the duping glitch for a post to the community. However. Unlike most he never showed himself doing it, he told people how but he never showed himself doing it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could really put blame on him for that since there was no actual evidence.
---
Second, he definitely was advertising for a site that sold caps for real money. That‚Äôs absolutely against the rules of Bethesda so I was disappointed by that.
---
BUT, and this won‚Äôt matter to some but it mattered to me, he no longer advertises that site or buying caps with real money and I assume it‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt understand (or didn‚Äôt care at the time) how wrong it was when he was approached with money for a shout-out by the company. Im not making excuses for his behavior, but no one called him out on it, there wasn‚Äôt a scandal over it, and he dropped the company on his own without being pressured. That sounds like a step towards the good side if you ask me. Usually people just do bad until they get caught. This guy realized his mistake on his own and I respect that.
---
-Also I‚Äôd like to note that the last time he plugged the caps company was 2 weeks ago and he has since dropped them from what I‚Äôve seen. His recent videos have been really impressive and a great source of info for Fallout 76 players.-
---
I understand hating and boycotting someone that is doing something wrong. But I can‚Äôt find fault with him at this point. He genuinely seems to be trying to make good legit content. People are people, I‚Äôd probably have trouble turning down a bunch of money too. But being able to drop them because you realize it was a mistake seems like a good turnaround.
---
But hey, maybe I‚Äôm wrong and he is still working with the company and dupers. If you can find evidence of that happening recently then I‚Äôd probably change my opinion on him.  If not then I think this guy could be good for the community and I‚Äôd recommend giving him a chance if you can get past the shady stuff he did.
---
lol true but it won't 1 hit ppl who havent attacked you first.
---
Maybe put pacifist on when going into nuke zones as a 100% failsafe?
---
Sorry but F76 isn't the online Fallout game everyone wanted for a long time. 
---
*digital fart in a stiff wind*
---
It‚Äôs some balogna forsure.

---
I think it's explosive radiation or explosive energy.
---
Either way, whatever the second part is (energy or rad) or doesn't matter if you have Fireproof, Padded, or Dense.
---
Automatic weapons + high luck and agility (I think it's 15 agility and 12 luck). My main weapon is a handmade with +50% crit damage but I typically use a 10mm pistol for most encounters outside of scorchbeasts or other boss-type enemies.
---
Luck and agility is more important than using perception damage perks in my opinion.
---
The lever action does respectable damage and it's very ammo efficient but you can only go so far with it in terms of DPS, automatic weapons aren't as efficient but they will do far more damage.
---
Some weapon mods also matter for AP costs, avoid high capacity magazines and scopes, use reflex sights. Receivers that increase firerate also give a substantial decrease to AP costs.
---
I'll come drop a bunch of mini nukes on it. ü§£üòàüòà
---
Rifle Gaming nuked monongah and it was worth it... but yeah there needs to be unique bosses... perhaps a mothman boss or an op grafton monster...
---
This happened because you "dropped" the power armor frames, you didn't deploy them.  
---
You can always tell the difference because if your deploying the frame you kind of look like your in workshop mode, and get to choose when you place it.  
---
I am sorry for your loss, but next time you'll know.
---
Lol. Fair enough. Kudos to you for your kindness, and thanks anyway:-) 
---
ŒàœáŒøœÖŒºŒµ œÄŒ±ŒØŒæŒµŒπ ŒºŒ±Œ∂ŒØ?
---
Been happening for decades. The door to door salesman used to at least be an semi-honest living. 
---
I don't use it exclusively simply because I don't have the ammo..it's just the highest powered gun I can use ATM. Level 28/29.. that'd be sweet though. Should get me through till I can use some of the higher level guns I have  stashed.
---
The real problem is for pve and pvp to exist in the same game there needs to be areas for each. Otherwise it is a just pvp game. If there were specified areas switching to a non legendary weapon would be quite easy.
---
Uh, Nocturnal?
---
Linear complexity isn't always a good thing. Sure it's better than exponential, but the servers still have to hit the database and load all those items every time you access a stash. As it is, I still get a noticeable delay each time I open a stash. Data access has limits.
---
I'm pretty sure this was user error and not a bug, I've run around with as many as 20 frames in my inventory (I don't mind slow walking around the Wasteland) and never seen multiple frames go unrecovered.
---

i love playing around with the photomode. got lots of pictures stored.

Also i love how loading screens use them.

The atomic lamp is pretty cool.

Wow what a hunky hunky boyfriend 
---
Too bad you cannot place a large Super-sludge and label it Nerf or Ban.
---
It‚Äôs okay, I got it üòå
---
For whatever reason I still have not done this. Good point though. I myself have not dropped a nuke..so when one goes flying I get excited and forget what I'm doing lok
---
Thats why I suggested to "servers," a pve and pvp server. You can only switch to pve once a day. Wouldnt that be fair?
---
I'd agree with you, but people would melt down about how it wasn't fair because someone else got an easier one and that they should all be the same since the only way to play the game is grind silos.
---
I'm not saying any of that would make any sense, but we already know it would be a thing. 37 YouTube videos and comments would all be suggestions on how it could be identical.
---
BS. 5000 wood is enough to build 50 max budget camps out of wood. You had it all to craft hundreds of boards. Live with your ban, duper.

Haha.... Common sense..... The same thing that tells me my power fist and mole miner gauntlets should be one handed weapons but are categorised as unarmed.... 
---
Do you mean 10mm SMG? The 10mm handgun seems useless to me..
---
It‚Äôs pretty sick here ngl 
---
Way to self promote and link your stream
---
I want a functional toilet, and shower. 
---
I leave everything unlocked and even have a large tent outside of my house with a stash box, weapons station for scrapping and a bed if they need to sleep. Next I'm going to move my decon arch down to help out passerby.  Maybe use light boxes to make a big red cross on my house or maybe the masonic symbol. 
---
Yay! Cheers for the answer. 
---
Nope handgun is the plan for me. I‚Äôve had great success with my gunslinger character so I figured a stealth gunslinger could be even stronger with that deadly first shot 
---
I'll bite, because I'm seeing a cubic F***ton of CTD's, that never occurred before this last patch.... 
---
-How did you determine it was MSI's overlay?  
---
-What error code was the application event log report?  
---
-What other troubleshooting was done to make sure this wasn't observational bias, assuming it wasn't a cut and dry, Windows reporting X crashed Y
---
A bunch of people aren‚Äôt getting this. I actually did deploy them. There were 8 or 9 chassis in a straight line and I tried to get into one in the middle, and I got caught on the ones farther back, making me stuck in the power armor animation. The only way out was to switch servers, and the power armor was left behind.
---
Adrenal Reaction is a must for every character. Healing factor is amazing and as OP pointed out marsupial as well as speed demon are pretty excellent. I try to grab these four on every character regardless of their build.
---
Secondary perks or build dependent perks include scaly skin and grounded if you want a bit more defense. I assume very few people use energy weapons but if you do, avoid grounded. Twisted muscles is necessary for melee and talons if you're fist weapon melee. Carnivore might be good for melee builds but I've never tested if it just gives you 2x more hunger satiated or if it gives 2x benefits from the food buffs. Eagle eyes is absolutely necessary for 1 shot crit/vats builds. If you have a full set of proper gear Chameleon and the right perks also can play into a very strong vats/crit sneak attack build.
---
I would avoid electrically charged, egghead, empath, herd mentality and unstable isotope.
---
11:44 on the fallout video or anywhere in the video when he scopes.   
---
Specifically outside of the lower doors shooting in the building. 
---
This is a blast.
---
Did you kill them entirely with the sword? I tried softening up a couple monsters with my regular weapon first and finishing them with the sword and didn't get credit.
---
I had better luck wandering the forest and killing low level things. If I remember right, I killed a possum near the cooking station in flatwoods, a mr farmhand bot, a low level scorch, a ghoul at the red rocket near flatwoods, and a lightning bug &amp; radtoad at the lighthouse.
---
Are you on xb1? Ill take them. Ive got some decent legendaries i can give you
---
I had a similar problem today.  I left the Garrahan mining building and then re-entered and it worked. 
---
Yeah, I have tried giving 1 and a few 2 star legendaries as well as plans and recipes to lowbies and every time, they run away. In don't know why, I wear a Confederate Army uniform and walk around with an explosive shot Dragon. I know West Virginia was a Yankee state, but a lot fought for the rebel alliance also. 
---
Having used a calculator to check for phantom weight, I dig this
---
Hey, atleast you got legendary drops, the other night I got drill and syringer after drill and syringer, broken up with a couple 1*'s here and there ;)
---
Fellow pistol/vats crit build here, why do you want to switch?
---
flat 25% 4 of us tried it, then we did two then we did 1 all the same kill times give or take 10-15 seconds for her coming down and such.  All the same weapons used, nothing was of note to think they stacked. 
---
Fuck em. All 3 should be different with different difficulty levels and rewards for each.
---
This.  Supposedly-sentient beings that sit in one spot and repeat a loop of scripted lines and never die will probably break the immersion more than leftover robot NPCs that are likely in disrepair.  If they do add non-robot NPCs(I'd probably like them to add at least one non-feral ghoul), I think they'd do better to err on the side of caution and only release one or two intricately fleshed-out NPCs than a bunch of common, stupid ones.  Maybe more like a companion add-on campaign(like the robot DLC from FO4) than a location add-on campaign(like Far Harbor or Nuka-World).
---
Lock your door? Or get a one-square room with a level 3 lock. If anyone picks it they'll get a wanted level they probably don't want
---
This is a new thing after the patch that is ruining my bloody build. I used to walk around at 20% all the time and now often I just die. Sometimes I die drinking a toxic goo with 100hp to spare.
---
I haven't bothered to try to figure out if something in Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, or Unyielding is setting me to 0 hp or what's going on.
---
Worse, Michigan. 
---
Yeah that's not interesting to me. Basically I'll buy it if I can play like Fo3/4
---
Nothing in my base is locked either hell i can't even put a door on it but it's also a workshop as my current roll is a craftsman for when player fending becomes a thing i can craft whatever someone needs for the right price and materials of they can provide them
---
Yes, i started too to leave unwanted items at the train stations...
---
I respect your experience.  Mine was different.  
---
That‚Äôs not terribly surprising given the state of the game overall.  Beth said they fixed 150 bugs in the last patch alone.  I am sure there are a few more out there.  You may have even experienced some I have not encountered.
---
Given all that, I feel like we can give the OP the benefit of the doubt.
---
ING Wastingsometime
---
Just relaying my experience man. 
---
The 10mm pistol isn't a bad secondary weapon. Better than the revolvers imo 
---
Lel
---
The problem is with the incredible amount pf 5mm that it needs
---
 ~~299~~ 305 boards   
---
FTFY
---
That would solve many issues, but I feel like balancing would still be a problem for the pvp players.
---
A week, three seconds, same diff.  ;\^)
---
Also - brainstorm here - why not we keep the rolling pin, but turn it into a reusable mine?! Drop it anywhere and any enemy that walks over it does a comic "WHOOPSIE!" complete with windmilling arms and bongo music and falls on their butt, stunned. Pick it up and do it again!
---
Now THAT would be a @#$% legendary!
---
Dude, I'm all for letting low level players get in on the action, but for god sakes turn pacifist mode on when you're farming ghouls at Whitesprings. Not everyone is going to be nice and just shrug off the damage.
---
Just have it out for several seconds after something dies (you can even kill it with a gun and switch after it dies, as long as you leave it out for a bit after the thing dies) 
---
.... and Bloodborne cut content on random chance...
---
It pissed me off one time when some friends and I went to a Scorchbeast Queen Nuke and told them all to put on passive. One guy didn‚Äôt, tapped one of the other guys on accident, and he had an explosive weapon and nailed us all. Two of them got their junk stolen but thankfully my bag was hidden in a bush. I refuse to be on a team in a nuke with someone if they don‚Äôt have passive on. 
---
If you are on ps4, feel free to add me, always happy to help lower levels. PaganRequiem

I've gotten stuck like that before, mid animation, and never had the frames "vanish".

What level would you recommend as a minimum to do Uranium Fever? I tried doing it solo the other night after some level 100 passed by and I'm only 35. didnt work out so well..
---
Seriously, don't encourage developer to implement these cash shops in full priced tripple-A games. This cash hype is what part of leads to games to be rushed out like this. Games that could have been so much better.
---
If you want to support Bethesda and encourage them to make this game better and not the cash shop. Go buy a second copy for a friend or some random person who cant afford it to get more players to join. Also spread a positive word about the game and by that I mean an honest good word, not some fan boy raving on how god like the game is amd everyone who dislikes it are just plebs.
---
Support them by making the game bigger and better, not by making the executives more greedy.
---
Your not wrong
---
Yeah but the very OP melee builds take specific perks, armour, weapon, drink, chems etc. Tbh all they'd have to do to mostly address that is cap or put diminishing returns on the +damage per point of Str. That's a bit different to someone giving Shady McDupe 1000 caps for awesomeness. 
---
I can see the concern about nerf creep, but I think it's just a case of wait and see. I hope we won't come to a point where our strongest weapon is harsh language. :)   
---
You're a life saver! That's right by Spruce knob and R&amp;G station right? 
---
Hey bro, I'm just curious. Are you on dope?
---
Well if it makes you feel better, I'm a melee build and all I seem to get is legendary hunter rifles or wood armor. 
---
Not only the frames, but the pieces too.
---
Seems to be an increasing in griefers out there atm
---
Nah, 299, he hadn't finished and was about to pick up the other 6 ;)
---
If you go to the camp box, the one with the light, everything will rebuild itself if you choose "rebuild" option. It will cost very few materials compared to what it was to build originally. 
---
I'd be okay with it! New vault dwellers, perhaps a diamond city kinda place, raiders, etc. Kinda cool. Roll it out really slow and I think it would be really awesome to see the progression. 
---
Actually yes
---
Im pretty sure it alerts you of a settlement that needs our help. Here, I‚Äôll mark it on your mini map.
---
If you put on the clown costume it freaks the wendigo out. It‚Äôll run away and try to hide and you can snipe him at your leisure.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the hat!
---
It would open the door to long term turf wars, with real impact and consequence
---
Don't rush through the quests, explore the region before moving on to the next quest area.
---
Most of that has come out already, hopefully the next stuff will be actually worthwhile
---
Uranium Fever has 3 guaranteed legendaries, The Violent Night event almost always spawns a legendary wendigo, almost every location in Watoga has a decent chance of spawning them, and of course a nuked out Whitesprings.
---
Just sang your comment in my party chat. We all chipped in and bought you this upvote.
---
Plan: Flamingos and Plan: Lawn Flamingos, totally separate.  Check which one scraps to make Black Titanium and which one makes Plastic. Ooooo...
---
what kind of stuff you're looking for, i have everything and then some
---
I'm pretty sure the Bobby pins weighed .10 lbs each. So 100 Bobby pins would be 10 lbs.
---
Since there are level 40 mole miners in there... probably level 50 or so. If you had someone to help it shouldnt be too difficult at level 35.
---
I must admit - I *did* keep that when I dumped everything else, although I've not played with it yet. Still - for only a pound of weight, why not?
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind of the silos were in increasing order of difficulty Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, but in any case, the silos don't necessarily need to be more or less difficult than one another, just not identical since I currently have no good reason to go back.
---
VATS/Crit build is the only way to run handguns and it's so much fun.  Use Concentrated Fire and you'll be getting like 10 headshots with a whole action points bar.
---
Any good weapons or if you have plans I will use them or find them a home.
---
I mean I hear you, and this patch has me CTD'ing nearly 3'or 4 times an hour, but I've collected literally thousands of frames (I have a mule dedicated just to holding extra PA pieces) and the only time I've seen or heard a similar thing is when someone drops and doesn't deploy..
---
I have a military wet suit plan that I used looks sweet
---
I didn't say _they would be more or less difficult_...
---
I only said players would complain they were. ;)
---
Fair point.
---
Yeah..I was able to kill the first horde of Moles, all level 40. But took a while and lots of ammo and stimpacks so decided not to go further in. 
---
Definitely need a partner next time I return..
---
Yes, pleeeeeeeeeeeeease.
---
For your situation I'd go combat shotty all the way. The reload is significantly faster than the pump, and the damage bonus of the double barrel is negligible when you're getting swarmed an need to get several shots off before reloading. 
---
No, there have been a ton of posts about vanishing equipment, and I've lost 2 weapons in the past week, but that's different than 8 or 9 PA frames not being recovered.
---
I‚Äôm actually running grounded and unstable isotope and chameleon and scaley skin and healing factor and bird bones and marsupial. LOL.  I only use a Tesla gun in group farming to tag and not kill enemies so grounded negatives don‚Äôt hurt.  Maxed out class freak reduced my one pain of minus intelligence which I fixed with a piece of armor. I run a heavy intelligence luck charisma build...mainly use a handmade rifle since lvl 25. I was given a 3* furious sledge at lvl 30 and it‚Äôs my only melee weapon. Sometimes I have to smash but I‚Äôm not tanky at all. 
---
I had a full set of weightless in my stash box prior to getting chameleon. I sold it when I couldn‚Äôt manage my storage space. Oh man what I wouldn‚Äôt do to get it back!! 
---
Lol, good answer. 
---
The plan or the TSE gun. Also my gamer tag is SoloOrangutan65

Bethesda should be buying mods from the authors and/or hiring the mod authors. It's well established that modders create better content than the Creation Club or Atomic Shop, they fix game bugs and design issues, and add features that people are asking for while Bethesda has unfortunately wasted time with changes that no one asked for.
---
Yes I can make it
---

---
I just wish the last objective would spawn some enemies! The three times I've launched a nuke the final launch prep section just has the 5 officers you need to defend, with nothing else attacking despite the announcer chatting about additional security!
---
Seems to be a similar bug to when events will just spawn one enemy for a 10 min long event. 
---
It's just south of the monorail elevator.
---
Are you on PC? I can probably get you some chameleon back... I did a few nuke zones on my toon and haven't sorted the armor yet. I may or may not have some chameleon pieces.
---
Easy way to no if its for excavator is check what it scraps for if black titanium its excavator all others are marked according to pa its for. 
---
   Also if you have the plans you can remove and add back as you wish but world found mods after used get scrapped if you change and cannot be reused again.  
---
Wait, is there actually a Plan: Flamingos?
---
The beginning can be tough, the middle and lower end of the map until flat woods should be fine, outside areas can be very daunting until you get levelled up. Spend time on your perks and decide what build you want, melee vs rifle etc. Get Pharma farm perk to level 3 asap so you can get chems and lots of them you going to need them. Search all med box as well as empty them. Hit Y to search or your appropriate key.
---
If a area is tough move a area which you can handle, it will be more fun. Grab some PA asap, you can use a empty PA until level 15 and gives you a 10+ strength and will go a long way if you don't mind being in PA or just build some armour .. have fun, there is lots to explore.
---
Build a camp asap, sleeping will save your chems, use stimpacks sparingly, they harder to come. by, use water and sleep to heal yourself in the beginning, dilute your stims, do some of the early quests, you will get plans and recipes early on for your camp like the water purifiers you can build to make yourself purified water, drinking boiled water is fine as well and easy to make just not as good as purified water.

---
I too learned the hard way that the only exactors worth a damn are the ones you can build in your camp heh
---
Hmmm after reading all the advice I think I'm going to go with the Combat Shotgun with drum/extended magazine and AP. I've been using the pump shottie and it's just too slow to reload when I'm being mobbed by scorched or ghouls or tunneling mole rats. 
---
I have a silenced handmade rifle for med range and 308 silenced hunting for long range. Just need a close range when I'm so close to scorched that I can smell their breath. 
---
Thanks everyone!
---
Thank you my thoughts exactly. This is something Destiny did that in my opinion ruined the game play. I can overlook game developers lying and misrepresenting things to me to a point, but when they start altering a game play because they don't want to hire the resources to fix it is bad business and shows total disregard for their customers. My family has purchase every single game, but one Bethesda has put out in the last 10 years or so. As far as we are concerned this will be a defining moment in our relationship.

I think this would've been better without whatever you think "instanced cloud servers" are. It's really detracting because it makes no sense and leads you into weird assumptions.
---
The scorchbeast queen and scorched couldn't work with persistence. The silos wouldn't work. Having some dingdong player make a Minecraft-esque sky fortress in a really silly place sucks, but dozens that are semi-permanent would be unbearable. You would have to remove public workshops and resource nodes.
---
It's fine how it is now. You can try to make the world a nicer place while you're there and hope someone takes up the mantle when you leave. It's kind of like life.

I prefer doing 600-800 damage vs 200-300 so I'll make that sacrifice.
