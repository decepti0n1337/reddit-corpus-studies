I submitted a ticket and asked for 600 atoms for S.C.O.R.E. lost thus far (approximately 4 levels worth). Haven't heard back yet but I would encourage everyone to do the same each time they lose score.
---
Yup, one of them is a disco ball for your camp 
---

---
I want it so fucking bad
---
Unlike other random encounters, he literally roams around the map, so he's really hard to come across randomly
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted when it's true. Glitches and bugs are far more important than some stupid immersion.
---
So there's one of him on each server?
---
cool story bro, hit me up on global Jakovac, Nick
---
There are certain plans that can only be bought from him and he doesn’t have them on him always either. 
---
Clean dresser, clean locker, and the mirror ball plan are examples. It can be difficult to find his exact location because of his movements so with all of that in mind finding him definitely warrants a look at his inventory.
---
We could bring back the lovers perk from fallout 4
---
I really wish they would find another way to launch the encryptid. Having some impatient jackass or a low level who doesn't know any better be able to launch the event that I paid caps and flux to start is extremely frustrating. You can't even babysit the console because people can phase right through you and activate it anyway. Launching a nuke gives a 3 minute notice to all players in the lobby, I think the encryptid event would be better off with the same kind of notification/count down.
---
I think so ye
---
When did Lucky Break...break? I’m pretty sure it kicked in for me not too long ago.
---
[removed]
---
Technically yes but highly unlikely. And as you play more, you’ll recognize things that are ‘too good to be true for the price’. 
---
To be honest, until you know exactly what your okay style is going to be, don’t buy any legendary gear from vendors. It’s usually overpriced. And until you hit level 50, it’s not often worth paying for gear that is under level 45/50.
---
The debuff to strength with Egg head is concerning me too but tbh I need to stop carrying as much as I do anyway. My biggest problem is I hoard chems and meds. Im a walking pharmacy and its ridiculous. I parted with 50 of my 200+ freaking Super Stims yesterday and was astonished how much my weight dropped so thats the plan going forward - trim my inventory and take the STR hit like a champ.
---
I have 2 lvls in Inspiration and share that one. I dont think I have the wiggle room in CHR to do more or have Strange in numbers but I'll take a look. I really want to change a lot in my perk loadout but not sure really where to start so thats a project for down the track too
---
Scroll down to options and click on make the party invite only
---
Capitol building was my first choice. Hoping that wasnt the only good area though, since I'll probably be doing it mostly solo was hoping I wouldnt have to server hop so much
---
The junk tab is for scrap and anything that can be scrapped down into scrap.  Ore is special.  It has to be crafted to break down rather than being scrapped, so it isn't junk.
---
Ah crap! I need to check my gunpowder. Been wondering why I get slowed so quickly lately, I'm sure that's the culprit.
---
[deleted]
---
Never heard of doing Tanagra, I'll try and give it a shot. Probably not a good idea to head for Glassed Cavern just yet either, but I'll get some levels with this double xp and see if I can grab a friend
---
I bought a ssd for my xbox one x to help with load times for adventure mode , but when I play NW I load in and can move a good 20-30 seconds before anyone...I'm sure this issue is even more prevalent on pc with so many different pc builds
---
100% agree
---
Yeah, no clue who you are or what you’re on about, son. Or what ‘global’ is supposed to mean. 
---
Oh, but that’s probably because I’m not cool enough to know the insider lingo and ‘global’ probably has something to do with a Discord channel or Instagram or something. 
---
Run along. I knew your ‘threats’ were empty hot garbage.  Go crawl back under your rock for another three years.
---
Knowing this game it would just protect you from your own turrets.
---
Sound like me.... I keep the Chemist backpack because I carry way too much.  I am now selling all regular and diluted stimpacks and radaway.  I even sold 20 super stimpacks earlier to bring me under 100.  I don't even use the chems much,  and I try to sell half of all.
---
Because a high level event/enemies span there
---
52.
---
Desert camo is not that much different in game then the default camo and the helmet looks too light (color wise) imo. I switched back to default immediately.
---
There’s another spot you can use the pa to walk straight out the elevator and land directly In the hallway for the silo
---
I know exactly what you’re talking about. 
---
The owner of the XBox party chat can make it ‘Invite Only’.  That makes it private. People can only join if they are invited.
---
It’s under Options. 
---
RTDM.
---
Ugh. I feel like such an asshole now. I had no idea that’s how it worked and some guy was blocking the event with his power suit and I thought I was helping by going around this obvious troll and Christ I was THAT guy. I apologize for whoever I did this to two months ago I swear I didn’t know any better. I’m pretty sure we were able to finish the event but after I started it the guy made it very clear he was pissed.
---
It's super effective on fast firing weapons as it will proc on multiple shots.
---
That’s not pvp, proper pvp has both players in the same power range, not one tapping the new players
---
I sell in bulk anything I have over 200 (except plastic because shotgun ammo) - I rarely keep weapons or armor unless they are truly endgame fantastic.  Still end up hovering around 740-780 even being diligent.
---
Yep, weighs 0.05 so you only need 20 of it to weigh 1lb, stacks up pretty quick! Had about 700 of it once which is 35lbs! Because it's listed in misc you never think to look there for weight.
---
I have that at times. The game will just stop giving me exp for kills with ranged weapons. If I pull out my melee it will register. But otherwise all it does it take the hp from the mob, leave 1 health or whatever and then the mob will regen. It's ridiculous.
---
It goes like this everytime.   
---
I start encrypted.  
---
I go to the bathroom.     
---
I get back to find some level 32 has started the event.  
---
  
---
The only one able to start the even should be the one who used the keycard
---
Non-related question: I’ve got a couple of explosive handmades and a non explosive combat shotgun. Convinced myself an explosive combat shotgun would be a step up. But the few times I’ve blown myself up with the handmades when an enemy gets too close have me rethinking things. Does this happen to you when mobs get up close?
---
Would putting PA in the doorway keep others out?
---
Pretty sure I've ran into your shop once or twice. Never seen anyone sell cores before and thought it was a great idea.
---
Yes
---
I also acquired a lot of useless ammo. I have no idea what to do with as the game won’t let me sell it to any vendors. I wish they would allow you to put stuff in the vending machine without it being in inventory. I have about 20 fusion cores that I cannot use yet. I will try that next
---
The explosive prefix on a harpoon gun does make it legacy. however it's a newer legacy said there are more floating around then like explosive laser weapons.
---
No shit, this is too real. I was at Target today, saw a stack of cat bowls. First thing I thought was “those are good for two plastic each, I’m running low!”
---
I actually started walking over there to check them out before I realized what I  was doing.
---
ps4 as well, died to one at project Paradise twice. they melt us
---
Oh. Makes sense. Lol Thanks for the answer
---
When it comes to fallout 76 you would have to give them your in-game name. you search a friends feature for the fallout 76 friends list is linked through your Bethesda account. Or at least I'm pretty sure it does
---
[This resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) is exceptionally useful for deciding what to keep. 
---
Unless you need certain components for constant crafting (i.e., if you’re always crafting ammo), then follow these guidelines. For the materials you use for crafting, store as much as you want.
---
No, that’s incorrect. Any time where players fight it’s PvP regardless of skills and levels lol
---
718 hrs lvl 222, but i spend a lot of time camp building and b4 public events mostly played solo.
---
Yes. Nukacrypt team is quite quick as well. Very rarely a long wait when the codes change. Indispensable tool for silo running.
---
Ive had this happen to me once on a private server.  They were fighting against whatever was invading and got stuck up there on the rock across the street
---
So you think it's worth the 40k that fed76 says its worth? Or more or less just wondering incase I decide to trade it off its not exactly my cup of tea.
---
Roasted
---
Anything in Misc that weighs anything should be put into another category. I picked up a lot of momma dolche food containers in my time that I would forget about before they auto deleted them from your inventory after the event is over.
---
Yeah just looked at all your photos it was that exact same place
---
List the fusion cores for 49c and watch them fly out of your vending machines. 
---
And you can also use the Ammo Converter to scrap ‘useless ammo’ into points, then spend the points on what you want. 
---
Out of curiosity, what are you considering ‘useless’ ammo?
---
I’m more of a Bruce fan myself. That’s the perfect voice.
---
“....and boom goes the dynamite”
---
I am close to finishing settlers but raiders aready done xD
---
Any damage on the target at all will cause it to have no effect.
---
it takes u longer to run that place. if r looking for "faster &amp; more effective" u gotta go with West-Tek
---
I personally use 20 as my bottom number since I gain them faster than I use them. That is a shit ton of weight and caps you carry for apparently no reason at all. I would reconsider carrying or even keeping so many.
---
Pretty much my thoughts.  Being stealthy, it isn't uncommon for me to hit for 10-15K damage with no chems or food buffs. One could probably hit 40-50K easily with buffs and nukashine.  I'm not a melee main, I just use it to conserve ammo.
---
Thank you
---
This is pretty much me. I only use a few different chems but I hoard them all regardless and I honestly have nfi why. Time to cull them. Im also hanging out for the changes in the food system that are supposed to be coming so I can break myself from hoarding pre war food and lugging it around too but thats a whole other story lol
---
Maybe they charge them up as soon as they spawn. But firing a second shot immediately is pretty cheap. Maybe they do reload it but have some reload buff programmed in. 
---
I don't think anyone loves assaultron's lasers. =P
---
The fixer. If you use vats and have a high agility you can take a few shots without running out of AP. And when you do you continue to fine in the general direction of the enemies. With a little practice it's not hard to enter vats shoot run out of AP and then finish them off outside of vats while your ap regens for the next enemy.
---
Low level and newer players in general are typically looking for a way to help out and I understand that, it's more of a "there should be prevention so that doesn't happen" kinda thing as opposed to a "that stupid noob pushed my button" kinda thing, because there's no indication that you're supposed to wait and most new players are used to following directions as they see them pop up.
---
 It's more of the level 200+ people that just walk in and activate it because they're impatient or inconsiderate.
---
Felt like a mosquito bite
---
Same I've been grinding like hell and I checked ah 600 stimpack 300 diluted and 500 supers best get them sold ah I cant bloody cap limit at vendor I've been given that meant away the new player won't even take any more lol
---
Just unlocked the plan.  My main is a heavy so now its time for the grind on that.
---
.50 cal ball, Arrows, crossbow bolt, .38, .44, flares. I am currently a level 21. I started playing a week ago. I mainly use a sniper rifle, shotgun and 10mm explosive pistol.
---
No, they can get in through the roof still.
---
Petition to bulk gunpowder or something
---
Lmao sabotage that’s funny I might have to try that. Sometimes I take PA, walk out into the middle of the street, and get out and hide so that people shoot at it and then I know exactly where they are
---
Junkies does a metric fuck tonne of damage with very little in the way of drawbacks. You are full health, and can wear more types of armor.
---
Bethesda are quite insistent in not helping on this front... the bastards!
---
Does that mean my Bethesda name or my character name?
---
I hate the grind for it. Did raiders but never got around to settlers - now I’m slowly gaining just so I can get the last steam achievement lol
---
Sorry mate. I'm in Australia and or time is upside down. I just woke. I'll have a shower and get ready. Will be on in under an hour
---
Explosive does nothing to scorchbeasts.
---
Thats incredible since the dupe it seems everybody got legacies and fixers to take her down... which platform r u on?
---
With the new legendary perks one is crafting ammo increase never need to buy it again
---
If you want to keep your PA, run junkies. That’s what I do and I just tank and do decent damage. My junkies super sledge does like 415 with 5 addictions plus it’s got 40% more damage power attacks so if I power attack near anything it dies
---
Yeah. It’s happened to me a few times now. They’re logging it now so send a ticket and maybe it’ll help them figure it out.
---
That game shall not be named. No one liked *that* game.
---
Yeah, those are all low demand ammo. I’d either convert it or sell it for 1 cap. 
---
Do you have the converter yet?
---
I dont want to suffer the debuff of addictions though, even if it may not be very severe. I barely pay attention to the food/water bars so battling the addiction just for damage would feel like a chore. Kudos to people who do run Junkies though, I don't encounter many of them
---
My challenge for the *glorious 20 Atom points* says I've played for \~550 hours, my main is a lvl 201 Bloodied PA Gauss Shotgunner, currently leveling my second character because things were gettig kinda stale just one-shotting everything. He's a lvl 88 Sneak build using a Instigating Explosive Lever-Action and I have to say, it definately invigorated my enjoyment by playing a different playstyle. Would recommend.
---
Use an All Rise, you get way more damage. I Love super sledges, but secondary weapon ..
---
Strength should probably be 15, I assume you using Slugger Level 3 and Bloody Mess, if not try those.
---
Just save broken cores, repair then ahead of time at camp, then go in. Don't have to worry about finding or repairing on the spot like others mentioned. Never thought about selling repaired cores, good idea 👍
---
I thought that way too. But is is negligible, and after a short period of time you don't even notice it.
---
You step on a roach and start to wonder how long you can keep it in your pocket before it becomes spoiled so you can rush home to cook it.
---
Well I more meant aa vs ts
---
Congratulations now you just got to wait and see how grinedy they make the BOS one when they land probably twice as long then both of the others lol 🤣
---
How do I get the all rise?
---
That sounds like a keeper. I got a zealots ultracite plasma caster with faster reloading and 1 agility, I also got a guass shotgun with troubleshooters, faster reload, and 1 str. I got my perks all together and the I have this bug where I can’t use the left arrow to switch weapons to anything gold bullion. It will skip it in my inventory or go to melee
---
what do you have 11 perception for?
---
lame
---
So how does junkies work? Like I just take drugs and hope to get a addiction?
---
I just did charleston and booting up the departments didn't do anything for me, I ended at about 16,090 and I ran through it a couple times and picked up maybe 1-2k xp just killing enemies stuck in the walls.  I don't think I'd revisit this place unless there's something I'm missing.
---
I did not have FO1ST then, I subbed after it was over
---
In my experience, explosive and antiarmor don't do well against the queen. 
---
Antiarmor alone, however, is quite good.
---
AA always beats TS regardless of fight. AA is +28.8% damage (most of the time) and TS is +25% ONLY if you land both shots.
---
It's the start of the Enclave questline, right? I haven't done that questline yet (despite playing since the beta; I also haven't launched a nuke yet, at this point I kind of feel like going for the record for "longest playtime without launching a nuke") so I wasn't aware of where it took place. I just know every map region has its own list of associated outfits, and for the Mire it's the TFJ, Leather Coat, and Traveling Leather Coat, and currently that's the only way to obtain them. It could change in the future, though; the two Western outfits were exclusive to Savage Divide quests/events iirc (or maybe Toxic Valley?) but now they can be rewarded from Pleasant Valley tickets.
---
As for the Wrapped Cap, it is indeed a shame. I made a thread about it here after they fixed the Insurgent and Treasure Hunter hats hoping whoever fixed them could do the same for it, and I also sent them a support ticket through their website about it. I still wear it since the TFJ feels incomplete to me without it, but when they post the patch notes for 21 I'm desperately hoping I see something regarding the Wrapped Cap.
---
Post your SPECIAL build for us to check it out.
---
Do you have melee mutations? Melee drugs, melee bobble heads? Melee food?
---
Idk then. It’s gotta be something you’re all doing that I’m not doing. Or vice versa
---
I would pay Atoms for the star/planets wallpapers on the ceiling. 100%
---
So you take 6 of a drug to get addicted and then that just sticks with you. But each one has a withdrawal effect so you have to get ones with barely any withdrawal. One second, I will link you to the post that explained it to me and made me decide to go this route. I love it
---
That's good to know, so should I prime it then or will that negatively affect my other, non scorched fights
---
Also caution, customer support auto lock any support ticket that even mentions challenges, they just don't want to know!
---
Hunt muties, sell their weapons to vendors.  Sell unused chems and ammo in your machine.  Sell unused legendaries for 100 per star
---
Now I feel like an asshole for making you feel like an asshole, lol.
---
I'll consider it, might have to move some perk cards around to work it in if I finalize my decision with Junkies... If I can neglect the addiction and not suffer too bad of a negative effect it will definitely move up on my list
---
Primed is ok, its just expensive to keep ammo up, flux wise.
---
I dont understand how people have cap trouble
---
That's gonna be cool then.
---
no, there are literally no debuffs, I'm fully addicted (5 addiction stack) and have -2s -1c -1i -2a -1L and this all completely gets negated by wearing just ONE piece on unyielding armor since I'm a junkies/bloodied commando/heavy, I know junkies is mainly people who play full health but utilizing this playstyle let's me use more weapons and do insane damage.
---
I have 4 pieces of 20% weapon weight reduction armor I wear that makes daily cap limit a matter of 1 trip to WestTek and selling all the weapons / meat I gather there. You get like 40 guns if you clean out westtek. And a ton of glowing meat and mutant hound meat.
---
Search the sub and ye shall find the answers you seek.
---
Do the Watoga Major for a day I think it's called in Watoga .. it doesn't take too long and you get rewarded a nice All Rise which would out damage standard Super Sledges.
---
We've legit been waiting for some critical bugs to be fixed for nearly two years now. And patches at times revive old bugs!
---
Interesting. Thanks!
---
The event is intimidating for many players: you die fast, lots of gutsies trying to rape you and an invisible assaultron. 
---
I usually take a pylon and snipe gutsies until someone else takes a pylon. If I see we are going nowhere, I just keep killing bots and farming fusion cells until it ends.
---
I noticed on my map screen while playing today that I only had 100 Atoms from challenges I had completed during the session, when I should have actually had several thousand. When I went into the Atomic Shop, it forced a refresh of the proper amount on my account, but then the 100 was not added to the tally.
---
I can't remember what they all were, but one was Craft 76 Grenades; I don't think it matters which challenges. Do we need to document everything for proof and open support tickets, in which case I've lost them forever, or will these be recoverable?
---
Congrats! How long did it take/how Grundy was it?
---
got mysterious stranger on lvl 3
---
just dont use that card, even if he comes, he shoots maybe 2-3 bullets and he gone
---
I'm aiming for the ability of full health. How does unyielding negate the effects to your special though? I don't run a high charisma/Intel build and cant really afford to take any hits to them
---
In my opinion I think a fair number of players just go to that event thinking someone else will handle the pylons and not care about it. They think killing all the bots is good. 
---
That’s why I rarely go to that event.   Beforehand I would cure my rads (I’m a bloodied build) and grab one or two pylons and stimpack myself while in stealth mode. I would try to get a shot or two on the squatch to get the rewards. But every time nobody would go for the third pylon.  I’ve tried for the third, but get blasted most times.
---
Honestly I don't know, I didn't fully understand the perk system when I made my build lol
---
Or you could have answered his question instead of seeming superior
---
Lol it’s happening in other events. Radiation rumble - no feckers want to collect ore.  Project paradise- you mean I have to collect stuff?
---
Hey YouTube, it’s Yao Guai RaiderBear42, I just ate this settlers ass, hit those like and subscribe buttons
---
just one unyielding piece gives +3 to all special stats, and I have a full set so I have around 23+- of every special
---
Well, this is..... really helpful - thanks!
---
Personally I'm not a fan of those foods but are they required to do decent damage?
---
dont use Penta-Barrel. I have two-shot version and it takes 14 projectiles to make a 65lvl SB cry with blood. So imagine what bloodied version could do. So u dont need a lot of ammo to kill fast ur enemies.
---
For lead go to lucky hole (u can get about 480 lead ore = 1500 with SD perk equiped) if u use escavator PA.
---
And farm tin-can. 54 can be found in front of Top of the World as a trap stuff.
---
Don't forget Abraxo. All variants have acid and antiseptic, and even if you aren't using the antiseptic to craft chems you can sell it to vendors. It's one of the most valuable basic junk components iirc.
---
Buttons and Guided Meditation are very underrated. Oh well, more XP for me I guess
---
I just did Guided Meditation by myself today. Exactly two mobs attacked the bridge. That was it. Nothing else.
---
6 minutes later it ended. Bit of a disappointment xp-wise.
---
just asking because if you're strictly a two handed melee you shouldn't really have anything in perception
---
Honestly had no idea I was being downvoted but I honestly don't give a toss.  All I'm doing is voicing my opinion, they're entitled to do likewise no matter how misguided it may be.
---
Kills me as bloodied unyielding- not much else does so its a welcome back to Earth 😂
---
It's not supposed to be there, it's a blueprint glitch that is very popular this week. I expect we will see a hot fix in the next week or so.
---
How many hours do you play a day, holy crap!
---
How do you get a junkies Super Sledge, don't think I have ever seen one or paid attention.
---
Yeah I now realize that. Perception is for rifle builds and stuff right?
---
Friend me , same name as on here . Happy to help and online for next half hour at least
---
I can help you do it tommorow if you would like.
---
I'm a bloodied build myself
---
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Why you chumps always gotta come here and whine about it I’ll never know.
---
So say I use that one piece of unyielding with Junkies, what's the best option for the four other pieces of armour? I'm triple digits now, so I need to get on top of armour and weapons asap. 
---
Vanguard maybe? Since i plan for full health?
---
Band up with other high level players, start a cartel. Control prices, hoard everything
---
yeah, semi and auto rifle builds, strength for heavies and melee, intelligence is needed for everything, agility for pistol builds, and luck is also a must have
---
How is this not considered worse than duping?
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap and it goes within an hour or two.  Plasma/fusion at 99c
---
Line in the Sand when people place their pay-to-win tent in the right place is amazing also
---
Thanks, I’ll be at Vault 76
---
&gt;I'm not really comfortable with a bloodied build
---
Have you tried a bloodied+Unyielding commando? 
---
You will kill everything fast, no need to think it is a build for "advanced players" or "high risk". Honestly: it is easy mode. Fights are never long enough and defensive perks (evasive, dodgy, serendipity) work like a charm. 
---
My bloodied commando rarely dies.
---
Do the Camden Park dailes. What's great about them is that there's 3 that rotate. So don't do any for 2 days, and on the 3rd, do all 3. You get caps, scrip, mr fuzzy tokens, aid and sometimes legendaries. Definitely worth adding it.
---
Ok well that's for telling me, I'll make sure to move those points over :)
---
Thanks but I got someone else to help
---
Play a new game because you beat FO76 until more content comes out.
---
In PA, run the Fire Proof perk. In regular armor, add the dense mod to the chest. Cuts way down on self owning with explosives.
---
How many damn hours are you putting in a day?
---
No. That website is super inflated IMO
---
Nice. Thank you.
---
I've noticed in project paridise that everyone stays together and only gets one habitat up. Radiation rumble is being farmed for xp instead of event completion. And I showed up to encrypted today and it failed right when I showed up and it hadn't been going very long, how is that event failed? Genuinely asking what causes a fail for that event?
---
At level 340, probably not. At level 40, wanting to buy mods and plans, it can be tough. The grinds at lvl 40 don't really drop very good plans very often.
---
Haha please don’t I would much rather be informed than make the same mistake.
---
There are 4 food you can stack for melee.
---
Glowing meat, yao guai meat and sheepsquatch meat (and their higher versions) all give you a melee boost.
---
Then you can add stingwing meat or deathclaw meat for extra +2 strenght.
---
Whiskey also gives you strength
---
Fury increases melee dmg
---
Sounds about right. It's a heavy gunners shotgun and wasn't super popular before the patch, value has only gone up since they became legacy. Honestly though I had always had a blast using explo harpoon even before they became legacy.
---
Here I am thinking I have a lot and you’re here with 800 each. Almost level 200 and I feel like I’m low level half the time lol
---
I carry 10 stims - you really don’t need more unless you don’t regenerate health?
---
Cool.
---
“Always has been.”
---
Go on
---
I was watching my wife play animal crossing last night and I really had a hard time figuring out what was so different besides visuals and killing.
---
Guess you're just too cool for me.
---
They're pvp zones. It tells you this when you claim a workshop.
---
I would do the glitch but with double xp I just run through the whole thing. Also helps to have the right gun to 1 shot them.
---
Most interior light sources are [insanely bright](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5a/FO76_Charleston_Capitol_Building_%28HWI_correspondence%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20200611051353). I didn't play the game pre-Wastelanders, so I'm not sure if it's the same issue (or if it has always been this way).
---
Actually I’ll come to your camp
---
Very true. I am finally in a place where I have the stims and ammo to be a conduit, I get low levels not doing it
---
yeah unyielding only helps low health but even full health I reccomend at least one piece of unyielding for when you're about to die, but yeah vanguards for the other four pieces would be ideal for a full health, btw what's your build? weapon wise
---
I so wish someone, anyone had bothered going for the bots on our event.
---
He's just doing what the game allows him to you shoot him he's seeking revenge and if anyone wants your workshop they'll take it he's not being toxic it's just what people do.
---
He initiated PvP with someone that volunteered for consensual PvP. That person then continued to engage in PvP with him by respawning at the contested workshop. 
---
That’s not toxic. That’s part of the game.
---
I've never had legendary armour in all my time of playing. And I didnt think too much of it until I was tired of doing little to no damage and decided to spec into an actual build - leading me to go for stealth commando. 
---
I don't like the idea of always being so close to death. I'm not good at this game whatsoever,always the first one to die in any situation where death is possible
---
Np mate. Word on the sub is magic weapons getting fixed next patch, so enjoy while you can. These are the glory days like Tse back in the day.
---
i just take the pylon and run like a headless chicken to not die lol.
---
Hear me out on this. Its not toxic to kill someone in a pvp setting. Its actually kinda what youre supposed to do, fight for resources.  
---
Also its pretty toxic to call someone out publicly where they cant even defend themselves.
---
Duel wield would be insane.   To the OP, I switched from 2 handed to unarmed (dcg or mmg) and it’s insane.  Ditch those sledges but get the right perks.
---
It just pissed me off because I had a whole thing set up and I was getting materials and he comes over and dicks me and I can’t really do anything about and he is 3x m my lvl I don’t see why he needed to do that
---
I don't use it for extra ore, just the radiation resistance. I'm sure a hazmat suit would provide more, but I can pretty much guarantee I'd be overencumbered. My Excavator's +150 carry weight (only have 1 calibrated leg) just barely makes up for losing the various weight reductions from my armor pieces and backpack.
---
Go take the munitions factory and blueprint the machine.  Once blueprinted,  place it in your camp.
---
Even on my new character that just hit 40 I was at nearly 20k.
---
not toxic
---
Lol
---
It is kinda toxic when he is 3x my lvl using a explosive gat plas and I can’t do anything
---
"Hey. So, uh, turns out I only needed like... five of these, tops. I was accidentally hitting the off switch and thought they were breaking. Thanks for the rest, I guess?"
---
I have a Mutants Fixer at the moment, it's the first legendary Fixer I've been able to get my hands on so I've been doing my best to work with it
---
yeah luck is needed for bloody mess, starched genes, class freak. and intelligence for gunsmith, and any other perks you need along with the xp bonus
---
When you hit max go buy a serum recipe sell the serums for 250 in your vendor and sell them to the vendor bots to make your daily caps
---
I'll just check the tr@ding subs I guess
---
Don’t you forget it. 😎
---
That makes me feel a little better about missing it
---
Its also against sub rules....
---
Yup. It’s borderline witch-hunting, a violation of this subreddit’s rules. 
---
I think ignoring the rules of a subreddit is toxic. But I won’t name any names...
---
It won’t let me share the picture on here tho, if you’re on Xbox msg me, gt is SCP Director
---
Pics?
---
I don’t want to be the one telling someone how to play, but you’re definitely carrying some unneeded stuff lol.
---
I thought they removed explosive from drop tables on shotguns.
---
No there is a way to blueprint one from the ammo factory.  Its a glitch.
---
Is there a way I can send pictures on here?
---
I've seen alot of people confused about TSE's still dropping
---
For you who do not know: TSE weapons still drop. Just not harpoons, dragons, or energy weapons. As the explosive effect is out of the pool for those. Legendary dragons just don't drop anymore
---
Edit: All shotguns besides gauss shotgun can have explosive. I picked up an IE pump not long ago. And traded for an IE combat shotgun as well
---
But you get more crafted so its a toss up
---
Move way from shit perks like this. Are you a vats sniper?
---
Aa, but furious is better if you can get it
---
Umm... okay.
---
Put a picture on imgur and link it.
---
False. They removed explo on harpoon guns. You may be thinking of the huge nerf to explo shotguns many months ago.
---
Yeah, low levels I understand. I actually think I see way less of them at Encryptid.
---
You can choose not to engage in PvP. 
---
You claimed a workshop. You volunteered for PvP. You lost at PvP. 
---
Your lack of ability or skill at PvP doesn’t make him toxic. 
---
And you’re borderline witch-hunting by naming the player.  If you can’t show respect and follow the rules of the sub, perhaps you should go elsewhere.
---
And his level is also irrelevant. Once you’re above 50-70, you can have your build designed exactly how you want. 
---
Want to get good at PvP?  Make a build around it.
---
Congrats mate 👊🏼
---
I use fallout 1st to move stuff and recently when i backed out of the private to swap it froze on the main screen and when i closed the game to go back in the stuff was gone. Luckily i only lost a load of scrap legendaries and about 10k 5.56
---
It did it again about 5 minutes ago. I thought i could fix it by joining someone in a public server then backing out and joining private again. NOPE! Stuff was gone. Nothing big once again. 3k in 5.56 and some scrap legendaries.

Uranium rumble too for what its worth. I went to one that was like 7 minutes in and they hadnt even started. Thanks guys
---
When I did this he had his power armor directly in front of the computer terminal.
---
K, downloading app rn
---
That's great. I'll be on in like 3 hours. I'll message you here when Im logging on. Thanks
---
This is the repost du jour.
---
Ts is slight garbage on a shotgun as it only adds 1 literal pellet more, and not like you are shooting two slugs.
---
She’s just a little brat. I hoped she got caught in that air duct.
---
Bloodied swing speed mole miner
---
Still sucks
---
Right. Thx
---
Judging by the reaction to this I think I'm spoiled by my vanguard gear. I thought I was immune to that cockiness because I'm not bloodied so I'm not really OP outside of sneaking, but I'm awfully tanky at full health.
---
Ouch man, thanks for taking one for the team on that one. DEBUNKED.
---
Limits are actually positive.  Makes you evaluate your stash and ask ‘do I really need that 1* flamer?’
---
This, yes. I admire the hell out of people who are willing to be the first to show up for these things. I'm always thinking I'll join after it fills up a bit, but it never does.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/ut9L0Ut imgur link
---
 Not in my opinion.
---
Great. You are very skilled then.
---
If you need some I'd be more than happy to give you some :)
---
&lt;3
---
Yes, it should count towards the weekly repeatable score challenge.
---
Its needed a buff since launch
---
My Vanguard secret service set nearly has the same DR/ER as my tricked out T65
---
Ditch the pa, go unarmed, move perception points to agility and endurance
---
They just need to add a basic skin pack like the power armor one for all weapons
---
Awesome, my GT is ImTwoJs
---
Stop fucking downvoting people for being wrong
---
Congrats!!! It's a helluva grind
---
mutants is supposedly getting a buff sooner or later so I would keep it around but full health I suggest finding an AA handmade or anything quad, bloodied still helps since it's a normal weapon but doing more damage as you take damage from enemies
---
Hey, buddy. I didn’t report you. I know you’re upset but sending me a vulgar DM isn’t necessary. 
---
Please follow the recommendation I made in my reply to your DM. I also recommend you read the sub’s rules.
---
Sorry you got banned, but next time, read the rules.
---
Go bloodied, use unyielding and strive for at least two pieces with ap refresh and two with harder to detect
---
Not What op is talking about.  Not the small one that unlocks from the raiders.  Op is talking about a full sized extractor from the munitions plant.  People are glitching/hacking/cheating it into every workshop now.
---
It's most likely a bug or you slipped when selecting the option for her to help during the vault raid. Or there's also the possibility they broke Wastlanders with patch 20.
---
Yeah I am very low on agility points lol
---
What pisses me off is when I can clearly see the laser shooting off at an angle and never getting within thirty feet of me, but my health still drops like a stone.
---
When was the hotfix?
---
I've heard this quest is bugged now as I've seen multiple people post the same thing on here. I did that quest 3 different ways on 3 different characters and I was able to get her help every time. I was nice the first time, neutral the second, and slightly rude/sarcastic the third time. I did this quest before patch 20 though.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/ut9L0Ut

Make sure to add a pictr link for increased credibility.
---
I think I haven enough for myself and I’m on PS4. Thanks for the offer, only thing I need now is ammo.
---
Ok thank you
---
Buy you won't die. A full set of Unyielding at low health means your agility will be around 30. That's a lot of AP, which is used to negate damage via Evasive perk. Also, 30 means BRUTAL STEALTH. Enemies bump into me. 
---
You can complement that with need rage (higher resistance at low health) and one of the charisma perks (lone wanderer or bodyguards) for even higher resistance. You can add the armored backpack and go even further.
---
My unarmed ninja has close to 500 DR and ER before nerd rage kicks in. 
---
My bloodied unarmed
---
Every days a school day.  TBF I’m the guy who hits and collects the ore.
---
&gt;Although for the moment, the server that runs the chats is down
---
That's sad, I thought that was already sorted.
---
&gt;ChatMod goes last in the load order.
---
The problem is that even if I don't install the Chat mod the game will crash.
---
You'll have better damage with a meat hook or dcg, plus the faster swing means more dps
---
Plus martial artist and incisor
---
This is a good baseline. It has a huge amount of useful information for: perks, buffs, serums, weapons, armor, effects/mods, etc. all designed around a bloodied 2h build. If you need help with anything further let me know. I also have all of the mutations you would need for most builds. Can give free if PC!
---
https://www.kevduit.com/two-handed-melee-build-fallout-76/
---
Congrats. Completed mine 5 days ago, and I still haven't gotten a good roll on the Gshotgun.
---
Just be prepared to get nuked... a lot
---
About 2 days ago. They tried to fix the autocomplete challenge bug and somehow messed up the other challenges
---
I'm at 74 currently. But I'm lazy and spent atoms to level. Plus I never buy anything from the atom shop anymore and have been accumulating stupid amounts of atoms from F1st. Think I started with over 15k atoms, and just blew like 12k on ranks. Haha.
---
That's true
---
Oh ok. I still love my super sledge and pa tho. Eh I guess sill just see what other options there are but I'll definitely consider this!
---
Power armor users, it’s time we get a buff 
---
*Sad power armor noises*
---
I can't remember which one it is but one variety has two no paint options one of which will change the armour to the other type, however it isn't possible vice versa.
---
Dude, they downvote for being right on here. People eh.
---
I rolled a 2 shot gaus i love it with all 3 heavy gunner perk cards
---
Any good links to perk cards for a build like that? I'll probably need to move points around again (I dread the thought) but I'm willing to give it a try. 
---
Purveyor will hopefully cough up a bloodied fixer sometime before I die of old age
---
Theyre cool at lower levels, but if you're going melee a knife is better tbh
---
Mate, chill. It's just fake internet points, they're there to let people know if the masses agree or disagree with the comment or post.
---
Are you defending wolf alt?
---
Oh haha, no worries.... yah I’m in the states.  I may or may not be able to get on tonight but I’ll definitely let you know if I do.  You don’t need to rush to get on and play
---
Fed is horrible for pricing anything even remotely interesting. It's moderately accurate at telling you if something is worth only scrip and nothing more
---
Kind of wish it was added to ps plus
---
No, just saying you don’t need to downvote someone for not getting something right
---
This
---
That would be a nice touch. It can be a real pain to fogure out what category something is under, and then it may be shared with another item.
---
Ohhh okay, no biggie. May RNG bless you with many stimpacks. :)
---
I still require my high capacity mod
---
There is a Canon murderous hand puppet in the lore!
---
I've got a Furious handmade and my mutants fixer is all. Stalkers gauntlet (courtesy of the Beckett quests)  as a backup in case I run out of ammo (which happens very frequently, I cant aim) and that's about it.
---
Good to know
---
Just the chest for some reason, which should be jetpack anyway. So yeah you lose like 50 carry weight vs a conventional set.
---
Stabilized arms, ultralight legs. Use weight reduction stuff for carry weight, 10 lbs sucks in comparison.
---
Nah I didnt get the request. Try again or give me your in game name
---
Thanks for the offer and the link but sadly I'm on ps4
---
My bloodied IS my tank. Over 500 DR and ER, Unyielding powered heavy combat armor. 
---
My main is a more balanced bastard, with 200 DR 180ER and 150 RR.
---
We also used to be able to use floors for roofs, but they removed the ability to snap those to the tops of walls for some arbitrary reason. I want a mosaic tile roof without having to build stairs to it.
---
If we could give our characters French manicures that would be great
---
Yesterday I essentially spawned right on top of the Blood Eagle thief I had to hunt down... that was a good day.
---
In game name is Ashann5355
---
I've since moved over to a stealth commando build, so I don't use it anymore, but it's still hanging proudly over my CAMP for all its service. Plus I can always just swap Commando for Rifleman if I ever wanna keep it from getting rusty haha
---
Those sound like some great weapons! Kinda weird that you're getting that bug, though; I've never heard of it before now. Hopefully it gets patched so you can swap more easily.
---
Both pockets and both light mods are coming for all limbs in patch 21
---
Also depends what sort. 45 uses cobalt so a bit of a ballache. 5.56 uses violet which is easy as you can get loads after SBQ fights.
---
41
---
lol. whatever makes u happy. All atoms I spent were provided by the game. dailies, weeklies and 2 month of 1st membership.
---
"To deal big damage with the Handmade or almost every assault rifle as well as every heavy guns requires aim, while grenade launcher only need you  to shoot in the enemies direction. You can also try to find cover if you  get shoot with anything but explosives."
---
You are just listing the advantage of those types of weapons here and not there weakness here. It is a bit like saying snipers are too strong because you can't fight back if someone is one shoting you at range.
---
They can be very strong but also have very low DPS and are very bad if you are on low ground.  
---
"It would be a good idea making the Gauss shotgun a Gold and the m79 grenade launcher a purple weapon."
---
I would be fine with this if they also made Handmades a gold weapon, as they are over preforming at least as much as the m79 grenade launcher if not more so.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"I never had problems with the Gauss shotgun, since most people only trust in the explosive damage. But direct hits deal significant damage  but it's technically a smaller DPS then the one of the combat shotgun."
---
You have not seen it used properly then I am afraid. It can be set up to snipe with. not only can it down someone in 2 to 3 shots at close range in seconds, it can do the same from half a mile away with the same speed and accuracy for some reason. It is crazy strong right now in the right hands.
---
Sorry it’s taken me so long to respond I’m never on Reddit. Circuitry 2/Steel 3/ and a damaged mainframe core
---
Try scrapping your ally object, restarting your game and system. Some of the ally quests are super buggy. I had a retrieval from Gramps and it wouldn't let me turn it in. I had to scrap his chair and then it said mission failed, but I was able to get a quest from a different ally.
---
Biv's quest also has a slim chance to reward you the nuka dark recipe which I've been selling for 10k caps and all the rest are being bought for 1k.
---
Now that you mention it, I did notice that the view distance for viewing buildings and objects was actually pretty bad. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t like that in the past. So was that a change with Wastelanders then?
---
yeah I had almost every single ghoul as a legendary and I was so shocked
---
I have healing factor actually and no I definitely dont need the 200+ normal stims and the 200+ supers or probably the same amount of Radaway I carry around. I have issues clearly. Im starting to dwindle them down because it really is ridiculous. I didnt realise until recently just how much all that crap weighs
---
Check this out
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K7JhMAUPkbI
---
Thanks a bunch mate
---
Why in the world do people pay that much for a Nuka Dark recipe? It's not even really useful.
---
Lol this happened yesterday I used my card went to roof of shed to wait and within 30 seconds a lvl 25 comes and started the event when im the only high lvl there
---
35.  Meh to the rewards
---
Try to get where you can launch alone, you'll have far fewer robots spawn
---
Ah okay. if you haven’t experienced them yet, they’re amazing.
---
I have a shot of me wooking in a SB corpse that fell on me during a run. I felt like Luke Skywalker inside a TanTan.
---
Interesting! I have never run into anything like this but I would not mind making my living area a trap base. I have a separate area for my vendors and my living space which I want to keep as my own space where just me and people I invite can come in. I have had a few people glitch into that area and are just toxic and I can't get them to leave. It would be interesting if I was able to do trap base type stuff for times like that.
---
AA for most enemies. 
---
Zealot’s (or Hunter’s) for the SBQ. 
---
My favorite 2nd prefix is FFR.
---
Nah I get what you're saying
---
I have filed feedback and posted on Bethesda.net they don’t give a Fuck
---
Now or before?
---
One trap camp is a platforming jump puzzle that occasional pops up. you have to jump from the Stash and Scrap box that is Next to a sign that says This is a Trap(and so am I)) to different platforms consisting of small generators, oddly placed platforms,  and rocks, oh and one of the points you need to jump to is semi hidden by a smoke making machine. Basically do you feel lucky or good?
---
Make a camp thats a big maze full of traps and maybe even an enemy depending on where you make the camp, and at the end have your vendors with nice legendary deals :). You might wanna make it a cliff base so people are less likely to jump in as its loading up. Or you coul build it over water, maybe throw in a little take the plunge room at the end where you have to swim down to a building underwater. The greenhouse dome can be built underwater.
---
furious should also work well I forgot that prefix, anything honestly could work at a full health build but most full healths do use junkies since it has the best damage output
---
I'm level 380. I normally play just to get 1 level every day for the daily and have completed all the dailies but 1 nw thing. Played extra for double xp and got like 3 levels yesterday and today. Hit score level 50 today.
---
Oh.  Damn, my bad. Sorry.
---
Seemed like a fake troll account was posting with a bunch of false info because that gun sucks butt these days.   The other account replying instantly didn't help.
---
You are good though.
---
Mine goes back to the map.  But now I’m wanting to double check.
---
What annoys me is when I go from my Pipboy to a quest marker and then it doesn’t go back to my Pipboy afterwards.
---
What is?
---
Thank you guys for the feed back
---
Sounds about right. Thankyou
---
I was lucky and someone was doing a giveaway and I happened to get it. A junkies grognak axe would work around the same damage
---
Thanks for this list, but honestly what use is gold for anyways?
---
The ammo converter is junk, but they are making it much better in the near future.  I’d still hang on to what you can for now.  Do you have a spare character?
---
Ikr, but they do. I used to sell it for a couple of hundred caps but I just happened to see it traded on the other sub for 18k caps. Since then I reckon I've sold about 5 of them for 10k a piece and they don't even sit there that long.
---
The cranberry bog seems pretty flat. It has a nice sunrise and sunset view. Plus the singing birds 😂
---
People say it's a glitch, but how can you tell? You can just go by the machine and blueprint it in LITERALLY 10 seconds without using any exploits or hacks. 
---
Did they forget to disable blueprinting it? Maybe. Nowhere is written that you are not supposed to blueprint stuff in the workshops. I am going to get one right away. Peace &lt;3.
---
I always wondered whats dropping a nuke all about. I guess I'll figure it out once I level to at least 20
---
Oh, just about a hundred pounds worth of chems. And that's after factoring in rank 3 Traveling Pharmacy and my 20% reduced food/chem weight armor. Occasionally I dump a bunch at a vendor, but then I do another Defiance run and can't stop myself from looting every mirror I see.
---
Report the player and move along.
---
Mutations. I have 9 currently for my two builds on my main.
---
I hate getting wet in this game, it makes my character look very shiny.
---
Ah. I too used to have that issue. 
---
I carried 300+ MedX, 400+ stims, 400+ Radaway, 400+ Psychobuff, then a bunch of everything else. 
---
I sell or drop everything and only carry &lt;50 of the chems I need now.
---
Its a glitch.  Be careful.  It may be breaking TOS.
---
Mine was a level 50s 😂
---
Ah i've heard about those. I always see ppl seellingt he serums so I'll have to look into that
---
There’s a handful of crafting items it’s needed for. I believe some of the linings. Speed Demon serum. 
---
Not a lot, which is why it’s rated **D** and only recommended to keep 50 (2.5 pounds) on hand.
---
Stucked......
---
Same
---
I have an in-ground glitch camp and I put ''No Traps'' on my sign just so people hopefully visit. I know it probably turns some people away because of actual trap camps but its been my first one and I like it lol
---
It's a bug. There's a similar one on the Settlers' side where Jen thinks her mother died even if she didn't. Bethesda is screwing up either setting or reading the variables.
---
Niiice this is a great guide and thank Atom that these Lil f4ckers don't auto scrap anymore!!
---
Good, you’re not a flake
---
Beth
---
I do the same for one character. Means it's far better for me to carry all my weapons and leave none in my stash
---
Gauss Shotguns can drop with the explosive effect
---
Well I got complained at so I put up the signs warning people (I had already put in Scrap and stash box for people to offload junk)
---
But honestly anyone coming up to this camp should either use the boxes or Power armor because there is no guarantee that I am not going to crash or log out while they are there, (not intentionally to dump them to the ground but because I need to go to bloody bed,)
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/7Ara66R.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7Ara66R.jpg)
---
The combat shotgun can down in 2 shots. Also there already is a golden auto rifle (Ultracite Laser Rifle) wich is pretty strong.
---
____
---
But explosives are litterally the most OP weapons in NW at the Moment, like when do you have ranged fights without cover? The only spot that comes to my mind is the Morgantown airpoint, and this actually has some cover.
---
_____
---
Another Example for explosives being OP is the Rocket Launcher. It got a lot of range and from my experience every time I or someone else got one was an insta win. It's mostly a 2 shot kill from what I've seen while using it.
---
The only weakness of explosive weapons are that comes to my mind is like you already said no range. Well they got some range but it gets hard to hit on very high range since it's hard to aim upwards without having an eye on the foe. 
---
But it they also have some advantages the other weapons don't have, like shooting ignoring the fact that your enemy takes cover, not needing to aim in close combat, and dealing area damage.
---
______
---
I don't think the Handmade deserves to be a golden weapon, since all the other golden ones are much stronger except the Power fist (melee is useless in NW lol) anyway I can agree on it also getting a Minot Nerf, like more Recoil or less accuracy.
---
Hmm have to rethink that
---
You can skip the mainframe cores and most of the silo
---
Yeah check em out. You need starched genes and class freak both in luck to run them. Strange in numbers in charisma is also really good. 25% boost to melee damage, 35% when grouped with Si#s card. Then adrenal is boost to damage when low hp. Then you have your QoL, super jump height, super fast run, extra carry weight, bonus special points, etc. they’re my favorite part of fo76 probably lol.
---
If/when you do, don’t have starched equipped when you drink serums. Only after. Also I’ve read you can only drink one per log in, but I drank them all at once and they all worked when I did it :p
---
Thanks for your submission.  Rest assured our team will look into the issue.  We’re sorry you’re having difficulties with the new S.C.O.R.E. system.
---
I keep logging onto servers that are almost all new players, I think that's very cool but unfortunately I never see any SBQ's or advanced events. I need a friend who I can join that is always on and advanced server.
---
???? What exactly is way too shiny? Are you playing on a strobe instead of a monitor?
---
"I get 1 shot and 2 shot by M79s on the regular. Anyone defending M79s is either ignorant or an explosive whore."
---
thanks goodness you are here with your superior intellect to tells as all that there are only 2 possible reasons for this view. I thought we might be a diverse group of people with our own ideas and experiences that my differ from yours.
---
Like seeing some of the best teams on Xbox use Handmades over them every chance they get and down people in one 10 the time of a M79. Teams much better then I am I would add. Or seeing power armor builds shrug them off like they are nothing. But none of that matters as you have made up your mind and are just here to say you are right and anyone else who does not agree with you is just wrong :)
---
thanks
---
good to know
---
2 shot is 3rd behind bloody and junky, and only for large enemies at close range. My Queen gun is a prime 2 shot faster fire rate .50 cal. Nice for that, but not very good for the ads at all, and almost useless outside of large creatures as the accuracy is trash. I can't even shoot in the air with it at all. Basically a melee weapon.
---
You should be killing mobs faster than furious, and explosive tends to reset the furious as well. A furious faster fire rate automatic would be a nice big gun too.
---
I'm having this issue as well. I farmed a few of my near complete combat/social challenges to earn enough atoms to take advantage of one of the sales, but it I started to notice the total atoms wasn't updating past 290. The funny the funny thing is that when I would complete a new challenge, the total would suddenly jump to the proper total and they only later would it revert to 290. So one database thinks I have 540 atoms and another insists that I only have 290.
---
I’m a Level 131 Stealthy Commando build, and I use an AA-FFR Fixer. I wear Chinese Stealth Armor using Covert Operative 3, Sneak 3, Escape Artist, Adrenal 5 (when it was working). I also have Concentrated Fire 3, All 9 ranks of Commando, and Bloody Mess 3). I have very little trouble with high-level enemies, unless I get entangled with a mob and don’t distance properly. In SBQ battles, I swap out for a Zealot’s FFR Fixer or Zealot’s FFR Handmade.
---
I'm usually the only person collecting ore during rad rumble, if i want to hit 100 collected I end up having to get in the vc and tell people that if they don't do it the event will fail.
---
Happens on PC too. Hell, I've had instances where I could hear the charging sound effect start, so I popped out from cover and got melted by the beam before the sound even finished playing.
---
Considering they are classified as energy weapons, and I've crafted near 200 of them and havent gotten the effect, I'm hesitant to believe you unless you have proof
---
Start here: https://disboard.org/search?keyword=fallout+76&amp;sort=-member_count
---
Touché my good sir
---
Can play no problem at all
---
I couldn't remember what they had, just that I always pick them up. Thanks.
---
I’m not sure if you play on PC but ever since the Wastelanders update any metal or wet/rubbery surface has the reflection of white streaks through it. It’s very noticeable if you were to compare pictures before and after the update. I’d be willing to show examples if you need me to
---
I look at a desk fan.
---
I take the desk fan.
---
Carry weight for life lol. With 5 pieces of wwr I can carry like 50 weapons or more each weighing on average 1# lol
---
I can picture that! That would be awesome! I'm starting to get into taking good pictures more too just wish we had more space for pictures on Xbox
---
I found out a mothman can spawn at the lucky hole mine. One of the ones you can kill. Looked like the cultist were doing a ritual or something
---
Speak for yourself.
---
*finger guns*
---
I’m 416 and I took a six month brake. So 450 is possible without cheating if he has played sense just after Bata.
---
It has to be a full month from the day you purchased the initial subscription. Give it a day.
---
Had 7/9 autocomplete for me today.  By chance, did you crash in any way when you loaded up after the 12 pm reset?
---
Are there any raider skins?
---

---
There you go. Can drop as a reward for Ally Quest.
---
They also don't seem to be addressing it anywhere. I've also opened two tickets, one got the generic response regarding SCORE when i never mentioned it, the second one they closed it without response. Many have been having this issue and there's not a single response from them on any thread.
---
I've got a stealth commando build and I run an Instigating Handmade with a long scope as my sniper rifle. Tried using a Combat Rifle but the recoil was just way too much to use the scope, and I'm guessing the Fixer's recoil is identical to the CR's. I don't like using VATS, though, so if you do a Fixer might be a better bet.
---
Well I started it on the 13th of June, that’s way past a month
---
Have you made sure that it actually renewed?
---
Started having this problem today. Dropping them and picking back up didn't help :/
---
hmmm we did have a world crash (all players crashed) as a nuke landed about an hour or so after.
---
but I don't think any of them auto-completed, I did the work to do them.
---
Ohhh thanks all. I thought it was some Plan or mission you did that allowed you to make them since I've seen some vendors with 6-8+ of each for sale.
---
Edit: Oppps miss read. I see they are Plans. Thanks for the added info. :)
---
My Bloods In It.  :)
---
Agreed. I supported this idea when it was suggested over a year ago and I will continue to support this idea, even if it never happens.
---
Thanks!
---
"And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!" xD
---
Yes, and I still have all the 1st stuff like the tent and my emotes
---
Edit: like could I still access that stuff if it didn’t renew ?
---
Happy cake day!
---
I am currently using chinese stealth armor and all of the perks you just listed. I usually keep my distance, but I get swarmed at times.
---
I'm not entirely happy with my damage output, and also want to get into some actual armour instead of just using the stealth armour (because while it is lovely, its inconvenient to not be able to see my cross hairs, leading to ammo wasted from missed shots).
---
It may take up to a day or so to hit. It’s probably a payment validation issue with Sony to Bethesda
---
Welcome to the wasteland some people are dicks.
---
When you use the keycard for Encryptid, just don't leave the terminal. No one else can use it while you're still in it, so you can make sure it isn't launched until you're ready.  Of course, it helps to have a team so someone else can give you the thumbs up when there are enough people.
---
Nice! I was able to get a sawed off one like that a few weeks ago.
---
I mean, did they take the payment out of your account? If they didn’t then that’s probably why you don’t have the atoms. If they did take the payment then you should contact Bethesda.
---
I use VATS... a lot.
---
On thursday and friday I played only a few hours after work. On Saturday I played a lot more over the day.
---
Stacking Intelligence and XP boost in combination with Lunchboxes results in very fast leveling on a Double XP Weekend. Each super mutant is giving 2000+ XP and my build can clear West-Tek (outside &amp; inside) in 3-4 minutes.
---
I'm now at level 516 and SCORE rank 94 and I'm out of lunchboxes, so the progress is slowing down.  Now I need to grind me to SCORE rank 97 to get another 9 lunchboxes.
---
Ah alright thanks. I thought it was just a problem with my account, because I tried to find something about it. But challenges + atoms always lead me to threads about score and different stuff.
---
So it will hopefully get fixed soon.
---
I remember that 
---
Actually had in depth convo about that. Its sorta like the time a guy got a TE gatling plasma a couple weeks before wastelanders released. It's a bug and an error in the coding that rolls effect. It's nearly statistically impossible to happen. So while it dropped *ONCE*, it should never drop again as it's not suppose to. Also that should be patched now, and even if it isnt, it's near impossible to get. As I've only heard of that 1 example
---
They aren't suppose to drop with explosive, and you'll probably never see another one besides that 1 lucky soul
---
I honestly think it’s underrated and wish it could come out of Beta stage and get a full content and balance update. Well done, and keep testing...*candidate*.
---
That’s I was more leaning towards I thought Microsoft lost my paperwork in the bin, but It just baffles me thank you for the words of wisdom
---
Had a similar experience. I had only 3 guns on me and the bare minimum for armor, and was like. "I have no junk, I have minimal aid, where the hell did my space go?" and then I see how much gunpowder, misc ammo, and fusion cores I had lying around from hunting about and doing quests
---
I use VATS on occasion but I like getting the sneak criticals from my perk cards, feels silly to have them if I'm not going to use them
---
Oh yay another thing to shoot my windows and corn lol
---
I’ve had 1st since day one and haven’t left, sometimes it takes a day or two to hit from what I’ve seen, but once you get into the grove it hits.
---
Also restarting the app sometimes helps.
---
Got ya, me and two of my friends experience frequent crashing with this game, and the only time we had autocompletes was when we crashed after trying to load in to an adventure server.  No one unfortunately knows what the issue is, that’s why they installed a logging tool.  The avoiding NW has had mixed results.  It’s happened and not happened to me regardless of time I logged out, mode joined, etc.  Several days in a a row I was playing in NW, played adventure during reset, etc, and nothing bad happened.  Other days, I’ll do everything suggested to do to be safe and I’ll get autocompletes.
---
Thank you , I’m just going to wait it out until something hits or doesn’t.
---
I also aim through my scope on my weapon for longer shots. Happy hunting!
---
It’s for the daily challenge
---
How’d ya do that??
---
What’s the SD perk?
---
I’ve seen this exact same behavior, was wondering what I have been missing as well....
---
Because they have no clue, are pricks, or are looking for people to overpay.
---
I always run pylon to pylon, get a few shots in while it’s venerable, die, repeat.
---
Technophile!
---
I’ll email them, because it did come out and I still have access to all the 1st things like if it didn’t come out then I don’t think I could place my tent, but it still let’s me use all the assets. Thank you
---
Had two friends get one too tbh. One quite recently. Hey you asked for proof and I delivered. If you don't want to believe it no skin off my back.
---
Daily challenge, buy or sell 3 items to players.  They have to buy 1 at a time as bulk purchases only count as 1.
---
it's a very peculiar phenomenon for sure.   I am not jealous of the dev who has to try to get to the bottom of this one
---
There's a SCORE challenge today where you buy from or sell to a player.  
---
If you buy, say, 5 of one thing it still only counts it as one purchase.  
---
So they're buying one at a time to hit the target and then they're done.
---
Where do you live? Sometimes the servers haven’t fully update due to that as well, most things reset on a schedule (dailies, etc).
---
Their servers are probably trying to catch up with the double xp weekend stuff. You’ll get it though! Be strong fellow dweller!
---
Tbh many events are easier for solo, but can be a failing mess when there’s a big crowd who don’t know what they are doing, don’t want to spend more than 10 bullets and want to tag everything that moves. I get killed by noobs way more times than SBQ and her minions. Many would simply walk carelessly in between me and the boss looking for the meat pile they think they ‘tagged’. But when I shoot explosive bullets with a bloodied build, I get killed quite often by hitting noobs by accident.
---
I’ve noticed this too. I don’t think it’s an exploit I think they’re just trying to complete the daily score challenges of buying from a player vendor 3 times.
---
Yeah I am hoping to get on of those, but I'll probably have to wait a bit till one comes on the m@rket
---
Yeah it fucking sucks, and this was also on a private server with only me and a buddy playing. Good thing a restart fixed it
---
I have been buying 1 each of 3vmmo from other players to knock out the score challenge
---
Wheres the proof from your two friends?
---
But it's like me saying just cause that one guy got an explosive gat plas just because it's a one off glitch that they drop naturally now
---
The gauss shotgun is not suppose to have explosive naturally. Which is why I stated as such. Just because there's a glitch doesn't mean they naturally spawn with explosive
---
super duper on Luck section. Gives u a 30% chance to double whatever u crafted. But it is a lie bcz u cant doubled legendary item this way. With ammo, chems, craft material works just fine.
---
Not to mention talons and twisted muscles
---
&gt;Otherwise, we won't buy new stuff because we're automatically assuming they won't work.
---
The 76 player base has long since proven that this is absolutely not the case.
---
Understanding the market takes a bit of time for some people if their new. If they see something drop and it’s value is 3k they think they hit the jackpot.
---
For vets though sometimes people are just to damn lazy and just push list and not care. If it sells it sells. 
---
Then there are the others that over price stuff on purpose giving people the false impression that it is rare. Like that jarred scorch beast thing.
---
Ofc there’s many other reasons, but, that’s what happens when you live in a world of diversity in an open market.
---
When players use the salvaged head we have to charge it, but the Assaultrons themselves likely have huge batteries or capacitors in their bodies that can insta charge the laser and fire at will. They are NOT supposed to behave like a player holding a salvaged head...
---
So that's what that was the other day. Ya that was annoying AF.
---
I think the difference is I can sit at max health while I have 500 DR, but it gives diminishing returns after 400 or so anyway.
---
If it’s something I can’t sell to a vendor, like a plan, i usually drop it to a lower price.
---
But if it’s something i can sell to a vendor, I’m going to price it at the best price i could sell to a vendor for plus a couple of caps. There is literally no reason to sell it for less, I’d be better off just selling it to vendor. It’s still going to be cheaper for the person buying it from me than from a vendor not due to their markup
---
"The combat shotgun can down in 2 shots. Also there already is a golden auto rifle (Ultracite Laser Rifle) wich is pretty strong."
---
The Gauss shotgun can do this from a mile away and has splash. There are people using it as a sniper that you do not need to am with.
---
"The only weakness of explosive weapons are that comes to my mind is like  you already said no range. Well they got some range but it gets hard to  hit on very high range since it's hard to aim upwards without having an  eye on the foe."
---
they have low DPs, poor range, are vary bad if you are fighting someone above you, and are not consistent.
---
"Another Example for explosives being OP is the Rocket Launcher. It got a  lot of range and from my experience every time I or someone else got  one was an insta win. It's mostly a 2 shot kill from what I've seen  while using it."
---
The Rocket Launcher is not all the good, it is very heavy, has low ammo and it has very slow projectiles. It has it moments but its not often.
---
"But explosives are litterally the most OP weapons in NW at the Moment, like when do you have ranged fights without cover? The only spot that  comes to my mind is the Morgantown airpoint, and this actually has some  cover."
---
I get that you feel this way but that does not make it true, I do not feel the way you do, that does not make how I feel true either. I can tell you that the best teams that I see, that are much better then me are using Handmades over explosives every chance they get. Also fighting with out any or much cover happens a lot in my experience.
---
"But it they also have some advantages the other weapons don't have, like  shooting ignoring the fact that your enemy takes cover, not needing to  aim in close combat, and dealing area damage."
---
Cover does work on them if it is use properly, you just need to use it in a differently way.
---
First off fix random crashing before anything else
---
When I first started playing again after a long hiatus I thought gunpowder was scrap and bought 1000 of it out of a vendor. I was so disappointed when I got to a scrapbox and couldn't put it in there. Ended up dropping most of it cause I didn't have enough lead to use it.
---
Email them and see what’s going on. Keep in mind that COVID is still going on so responses could be slower than usual.
---
Troubleshooters armour, first aid rank 3 and super stimpaks help a lot. Last time I did it there was only 2 of us, I took two pylons and the other guy the other. Was actually pretty easy. Preparation is key.
---
I'd happily pay the default base price for some plans instead of the massively over priced bullshit I've seen on some people's vending machines. Some people and their pricing is just plain insanely stupid.
---
What weapon are you using?
---
I live in top part of Georgia, but yea I just got all the double xp notifications and more dailies, thank you so much for this vault dweller energy I definitely sit back and relax in my hangar bar and watch the nukes pop off :)
---
Yeah I just wasn't a fan of those cuz they only last for ten minutes or so. But I guess I'll try em out for SBQ fights
---
People will pay the base value. Only reduce price for things that they don't buy/plenty of plans in other vendors machines.
---
Making custom prices forces you to set the price every time you want to add an item to your store. Keeping the default price allows you to spam plans into your machine without spending 20-45 minutes waiting for the slowest interface in the game to respond while you set each individual price.
---
I don't pay taxes on 1 cap sales so I hope Bethesda doesn't audit me
---
Use the really good weapons you find to fine tune your armor. At lest till you can build a full suit of secret service armor that matches your build.
---
I just mean in general, my armor drains so quick and my weapons, I have lucky break and whatever the weapon equivalent of it is maxed with 9 luck and my weapons and armor still break wayyyy to often
---
And not to mention how much it take to repair them
---
Glad you posted this. Having the EXACT same issue.  I even documented it.  Here’s another thread for it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/htmac0/dont_complete_atom_challenges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Worst part: I even submitted a ticket as missing atomic shop items, hoping it would get forwarded to a different department.  They changed the category back to a challenge and just reposted the same cut and paste response.  It’s a joke.  You respond with more info, they post the same thing back.  Over and over.
---
Fix it Good and White Knight are extremely useful for your armor repair runs. 
---
Weapon Artisan for your weapons. 
---
Once you start crafting your own gear, Armorer 3 for your armor, and get your Intelligence as high as possible. You’ll see a big difference on the base durability. 
---
For weapon, consider Forceful Stock if available. It will actually increase the durability.
---
I can understand that, that’s an actual good point. I never thought about it like that
---
I train my aiming in adventure mode. Scorched are really good in hiding. Some flying enemies are also really good for training if you want to kill frog leggers. Killing assaultron is good for killing people with chameleon or stealth boy.
---
I joined the raiders when I saw Paige intelligence points.
---
I kept that in mind when I built the camp.  I am setup on that switchback south of the mine and I have vendors up so that I show on the map.
---
I’ve got fix it good maxed but I haven’t gotten white knight yet
---
Edit: also for some reason my agility never levels up so white knight would be like the only perk I have there because I have 2 agility
---
If you have the materials I can.
---
Thrift stores trip me up. When you’re in the home improvement section at a store, you expect to see glues, tapes, metal canisters, etc. But just strolling through a thrift store (pre-COVID), an old fan or clipboard or locket will catch my eye... and I can’t make it stop. It’s like Fallout-itis.
---
See I’m okay with buying base prices up to a certain extent. Like if it’s items like food or medicines or anything like that, that’s fine. Some plans are cheap-ish as well depending on what they are. But if they’re usually over 400-500 caps per plan I kinda think that’s something that should be dialed down a little, ya know?
---
what materials does it take
---
Guilty, it's for the Legendary Run.
---
Because Ward gets out of bed by standing up backwards like some kind of poorly programed, awkward robot.
---
Haha don't have a screenshot to hand, friends not online however I have requested it. However you asked for proof once after saying it can't drop. Then someone showed it can. Then you changed to "ah yes it can but it must be a bug" 
---
So what would any form of new screenshot show you. You've already shown no matter what's shown to you, you won't believe it. 
---
Again I just stated it can and showed that it can.
---
This will happen in Nuclear Winter every time if you click confirm with the cursor.  You have to position the cursor, and click 'e' or 'space' twice to confirm.
---
What category is it under?
---
Good luck! Internet stuff isn’t my ultimate specialty of knowing when shit resets, but I live in Seattle and it takes about a day or two to get my atoms when I do it.
---
Ask someone with a TSE Gatling Laser with a beam splitter on it.  
---
You never get to reload.
---
IS THAT SOMEONE WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
I can completely understand the lower levels, yeah. But usually when it’s like players in the 100’s selling their items for high base value or overpriced, it just kinda seems pointless for them to be selling it/offering it in the first place
---
I'll try moving my camp up there for a while a looking for anything that might help you. Idk anything about it either, but if I find out, I'll pm you or something if you want
---
I can’t imagine that
---
So, here's what finally worked for me. Sludge Lung only seems to check the challenge if you 1) Have Sludge Lung, and THEN 2) Aquire a different disease.
---
However, there is a long cool down time between when you can acquire a disease after you get effected by the first one. Fortunately, if you server hop, that ends the cool down. So you need to acquire Sludge Lung (fumes in the Ash Heap or from a Wendigo) and then quickly server hop, and then acquire a different disease before Sludge Lung ends. I just ate a ton of spoiled meat, which did the trick.
---
I hope this helps!
---
I just checked I have a junkies grognak axe, so will be interesting to see with the addictions and how that works.
---
I read that if you build one in your camp it takes up ~10% of your budget, cannot be moved and cannot be scrapped. If you move your camp it stays in your budget as an invisible item that still can't be deleted and will remove a big part of your budget seemingly forever.
---
What do you mean your agility never levels up?  You control what SPECIAL increases when you level up. 
---
What level are you.
---
It's for a challenge, I usually buy 3 of any 1 cap ammo for the daily and just drop it infront of the machine
---
With the BoS returning later this year I wouldn't be surprised if that gets added
---
You're forgetting "I lost my score to auto completion!1!!" I think.
---
34, and I’ve gotten several agility perks and it remains on 2
---
Level 333 with 600+ hours
---
There are several plans you can buy from a npc vendor for several thousand caps but their base sell price in a vending machine is a couple hundred at best, so yeah gimmie players selling at base price any day.
---
Ive only crashed twice since Update 20. Check in with ISP
---
I just noticed this today too. I hope we get those atoms back...
---
It might have something to do with the upcoming event with the Wendigo colossus that's not in game yet.
---
Yeah but most tiems the sbq is almost dead i crash. It really sucks
---
I just sell most of my stuff for the default price, even the bloodied guns (non explosive) I still usually only sell those like 2-4K depending what it is
---
When you level up, what SPECIAL are you increasing?
---
Same issue. My response from Bethesda was "Everything is in order! Have a nice day :)"
---
I'll gladly take those. For fun, I do pistol builds and I have a combat rifle that uses .38 ammo. They all weigh 0 for me and I use those type of weapons on weak enemies.
---
I save my 5.56 for the big boys. If I am below 10,000 5.56 ammo, I feel like I'm going to run out.
---
https://youtu.be/sWkklNsa0Fw
---
Multiple stable flux
---
Because raiders have personality
---
the other part is adjusting for for the ”player vendor tax”
---
So let’s say I have a chem that sells to a vendor for 25 caps.  I’d like to make an extra cap or two off of it.  So let’s say I want to put 27 caps in my pocket from it’s sale.  
---
The Vendor system also takes a 10% tax, so then I adjust for that.  Since the system rounds up, so I place the item at 30 caps.  
---
If it sells, 3 caps comes off as tax.  Then I’ll get 27 caps, exactly what I wanted.  
---
Of course, not all chems sell, but things like Berry Mentats are selling well right now for the bonus INT (and thus bonus XP) and Grape Mentats (for the bonus CHA so you get better prices.)  So I think the prices I set for them is fair.
---
Luck IIRC
---
So Bethesda can sell you more repair kits.
---
Usually different ones every time 
---
I guess mainly endurance and luck because I have 10 on it
---
The special system still confuses me
---
A friend of mine has the same problem at the same part.
---
(I'm stuck on a later point in the same quest.)
---
What's going on with Sofia these days?
---
*M O O*
---
Not only that the price per hour for entertainment  cant be beat. I've spent 103 dollars on fo76. 60 for the game 30 on atoms and 13 for my first month of 1st. I've put just shy of 300 hours into it, so let's use 300. That's 34 cents per hour of entertainment. Way cheaper than anything else. Those are also rookie numbers. I'm sure others have gotten a way better deal.
---
Use the intelligence perk to lower energy ammo to 90 %, and if you need to craft ammo, go to lucky hole mine for the lead and for the steel i honestly don't know
---
Adrenal reaction mutation and/ or nerd rage. His health is near 20% and both of these perks will raise damage a noticeable amount.
---
Yup, that was it. I'm 592 for gunpowder, almost 30 lbs. Time to make ammo!
---
I know it's hard for low-skill players to understand but the M79 is a gun people use when they're not good enough to hit someone with a precision weapon. Some med/high-skill players who are good enough to use precision weapons still choose to use explosives. These people don't care about the future of the game, they don't care if it ruins the game for others, all they care about is winning. Explosive are the META without a doubt, you should be thanking all of the top tier players that don't run explosives.
---
Your agility will only increase if you add a stat point to it. You get 49 level ups to do this. 
---
You can pick a perk card from a different special than what you increased. 
---
You shouldn’t just be randomly assigning points. You can’t max all seven stars and only will have a total of 56 stat points overall to use.
---
It’s been in the game since launch I believe.  There are some other neat places like that including a whole section of the enclave that’s still inaccessible.  Supposedly the cemetery was part of a side mission that got scrapped.
---
Once I reach over 20,000 caps, I go spend them at other people vendors, buying up any 3* weapon 800 caps or less.
---
I wont believe in it because it's a bug. It's not suppose to happen and it can only happen through one rewarding daily
---
Telling people the shotgun can drop with explosive is correct inherently. Just like telling someone a explosive gatling plasma can still drop. But it's a bug, and not suppose to. Telling people it can drop with that effect without explaining it's a rare failure in the legendary system is pretty shitty. So while I know of the 1 case, I still tell people it doesnt drop with it as that is what was intended, and to get it to drop not only requires extreme luck, but as well as hoping the legendary system hiccups.
---
Same reason why, even though it was a popular post and featured in a few articles, people still tell others energy weapons dont drop with explosive. Even though that's Inherently false.
---
That’s dope. That’s originally what I wanted but beggars can’t be choosers
---
Agreed. I always wondered why there were complaints about buying into this game. I can bet those complaining spend money on expensive sugar coffee and streaming services like Netflix and never watch them!
---
Why are you booing him?
---
He’s probably right
---
Okay thx man.
---
Also stuck with her. Ps4. Hope they fix it.
---
I've been having an issue with this all week. Every time I log back in most of my atoms are gone. I had 250 last time I played. Log back in today and it's 10. Haven't bought anything. This shit is infuriating
---
At low levels (until 50) you choose a point every time you level. If you choose an agility perk, your agility increases by 1. So it’s best to outline a general build and pick stat-based perks even if they’re not 100% what you see yourself with long term, because the SPECIAL distribution is a *lot* more important than the perks you’re actually picking. By the time you’re 70-80 you’ll either be totally set on perks and picking out flavor ones to mess around with, or still trying to fix your build and have almost no extra perk cards depending on the stat distribution you choose at low levels
---
Oh, damn, I feel like they should explain that better, I have somebody who is lvl 200+ who should know this
---
I would love to see legendary effects added to power armor pieces, as well as a carry weight buff, as I’m losing carry weight every time I step into PA.
---
As far as damage resistance goes, PA is still effective. People often forget about the hidden resistances that make PA better tank armor than Vanguard/Bolstering. The 98-99% radiation resistance is also fantastic.
---
The problem is it’s tough to choose PA over an full set of Unyielding if you’re bloodied, even with Emergency Protocols; the stat boosts are just too good. Add Sent/Cav to the mix, and even the hidden damage resistance of PA is outclassed.
---
Now, a full set of legendary 3* PA with mods and an increase in base carry weight? I think that would turn a lot of people back toward PA and would become the new grind.
---
I actually like trying out different odd ball weapons. I always keep a couple of my good ones on me but it's fun to try different ones. I managed to squeak 700 base damage out of a junkies spear on my melee character.
---
Gt?
---
XVI Septiz
---
Storage is my biggest pet peeve with this game. I have collected anxiety, I like to hold onto things.
---
I’d look for weapons without the explosive perk, pretty sure the queen is almost if not completely immune to explosions
---
Yep, definitely needs work.
---
You can pick perks for other specials after choosing one
---
It is on the level up page, at the bottom with the control commands. 
---
But you’re not the only one to miss that. It could definitely be explained better at first level up.
---
Don’t forget constructor perk rank 2 for 50% off building materials
---
Understandable, again tho and I hate saying this...talk with your ISP. Comcast had me add ports and I only crash when I ping bad bc I use a cloud server to play Fallout and that needs a constant no ping higher than 25 connection at all times.
---
A similar issue happened to me also, all I could do was wait until it fixed itself
---
ROBOSEXUAL I CANT
---
Only one cap each?
---
Dammit. I’ve been overpaying by a ***LOT*** then.
---
I didn’t lol.  I knew they have more frequent daily rep quests so opted for the lowly and boring Foundation 😏
---
no buffs nedeed. emergency protocols + calibrated shocks + nerd rage + dodgy make u tanky with sufficient inventory capacity as hell. + bloodied weapon of ur choice makes u a perfect soldier. To be more tanky try speed demon serum. The only cost of this beauty is fusion cores.
---
THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER?!?
---
Raiders are interesting and have the Gauss minigun plan
---
Okay, I remember it being locked to whatever the stat the perk you chose was, but I haven’t been under 50 in awhile. The point is, choose your special stuff wisely
---
i don’t have materials for it i am kinda broke on everything
---
Happens on PC. As a bloodied build this is instant death and it sucks. Luckily with stealth I try to take them out ASAP.
---
Do you happen to live in Morioh-cho? :D
---
So, you don't like to talk, *after*..?
---
I got you covered, man
---
Strongly agree
---
The plan is dropped from your first SBQ fight
---
I think the main issue is that carry weight reduction mods are so much more effective, and PA doesn’t get access to any of them.
---
ok cool thanks
---
There's no reason for it atm data miners haven't found anything for it yet. There's several videos about it but nothing meaningful. There's also stuff under the map but only conclusion people have is it's a scrapped quest.
---
Had a few myself where I was sneaking and the moment it went to caution I started seeing lasers firing around the room. They're looking at walls, doing their patrol and the lasers are firing across the room like Cyclops from Xmen without his glasses. An absolute shitshow I was happy to see, but unhappy to be a part of. Ahahaha
---
toilet paper is one of those few junk items that I always pick up, without exception, whether I need it or not.
---
Yes please. Power armor needs a pack mod or something along those lines so that you can use a PA set without being significantly low weight. Also no "just use excavator" isn't the answer because excavator sucks and people should be able to use their PA of choice without having carry weight hindered. As is PA is significantly weaker than regular armor especially with the introduction of secret service armor. Regular armor gets legendary perks like unyielding, vanguard, powered, weight reductions, and sentinel/cavalier with high levels of dr and er that bring it on par with the soft cap. PA needs some love to bring it at least on par with regular armor.
---
Lol I love that you are being insulting and talking down to anyone who does not agree with you and trying to come off as superior, when really all you are doing is Reeeeeee! it takes less skill Reeeeeeeeeeeee! lol. Which does not have anything to do with it being OP or not.
---
Hopefully you have many a game where you get rekt by them :) As someone as condescending and insulting deserves it if anyone does.
---
for the steel Line in the sand + scrapper. Actually any place works. Just collect weapon/armor pieces from ur enemies and scrap it away. The event I mentioned gives u 3500 of steel.
---
This was pre patch 20 but I had the same problem and eventually it just started working.
---
Yea I watched It again and he said he was using nerd 3 but no adrenal mutation. Nerd is good because (I think) it's a percentage of your damage after your weapon damage perks. There is a calculator somewhere that shows the formula and which order damage cards are placed, but I haven seen it in a while. I've also read that the order in which you select damage cards can affect your dps as well.
---
They are viable, but take some work to get right. If you do your perks right you can do both pistols and rifles and use pistols for close up and rifles for distance. The biggest downsides to pistols are no armor reduction and the perks compete with stealth, so a stealth pistol build is not really viable.
---
Whatever your gamertag is, thats the name you give them. Your characters name is barely used, outside of npc conversations.
---
Actually I'm good, thought I recognised your name. Haha seen this before with you. Not worth it because you've shown once someone bites it can go on for some time. Believe what you will. I'm out. 
---
Stay pacifist brother. Haha
---
What spacesuit from atom shop???
---
Honestly same issues. I tried searching for a way to report it to Bethesda Support but it's not easy to find. It's annoying going into the Atomic Shop to buy for example (Secret Service Backpack = 500 atoms) when you have over 1000. You enter the shop and it reverts back to 145 atoms when you didn't buy anything. This needs to be fixed ASAP. I play on Steam only. Even leaving the game and relaunching is doing nothing for me.
---
Note: Is this only restricted to the challenges? Has anyone tried purchasing Atoms and seeing if they're lost?
---
I stopped playing that game a while ago, as soon as my stash got full and i couldnt carry anything without getting overencumbered
---
Fanmade lore |
---
It is said that the once small lizard roams the grave of its master, counting the number of years it has been roaming the site, praying for his resurrection.
---
It grows sad, angry and dwells in the cave below to keep an eye out for any graverobbers that wish to disturb its masters grave.
---
It would add a little more to the "life" of the game, rather than the cemented in: Go to this guy that you know is the only quest giver in this entire area if you want something to do.
---
I just do the glitch with the ceiling, it takes me 10 minutes to launch the nuke
---
I've seen him sitting backwards integrated with his chair. Sometimes he doesn't even look at you when he talks which is kind of creepy as well.
---
This made me lol. 😂
---
Or how about an Assaultron you could have as a follower?
---
I can’t remember correctly, but I think in fallout 4 you could get legendary PA pieces? Or maybe that was a kid. But I definitely know certain armor paints would increase strength. I remember my XO-1 in FO4 being able to carry almost 500 pounds while in 76 it’s only 260... 360 with calibrated shocks. Regular armor shouldn’t be able to out carry PA!

---
*looks at my character dead from splash damage from gauss shotgun* cool yo
---
To me, thats a silly question
---
"Came dressed to play?"
---
Because I give wayyy too much stuff away for free to have to run a *charity* with my vendor pricing. Because if I make every action I do in this game primarily for the sake of *other people* then I'll be left with zero enjoyment. Because I would rather price my items *for the 90% of people who buy them*, instead of the 10% who don't. And most of all, because it screws with people who are delusional enough to think they have *any* say over what my prices should be. Take your 'thumbs-down' and 'angry' emotes and get the frell outta my camp 🤷‍♂️
---
My most frequent repeat sales are two seperate plans with a base value of 100 that I buy from NPC vendors and resell for 2000.. and i sell literally hundreds of them! And I will continue to do so to fund all the decent items that I give to newbies for free! If I can't realistically sell a legendary weapon I find for 10k or more, I'm giving that sucker away for free too. Just last night I set a newish player who'd just recently passed level 50 up with his first legendary, a V3315 Automatic Ultracite Rifle, and his first full power armor set -which was Ultracite and decked out with Targetting HUD, medic pump, and Calibrated Shocks.
---
So yeah.. I can either reduce my prices, or keep using my profits to help newer players - *but I will not be doing both!*
---
Yeah cool
---
Just remember you kept it going and are as much to blame as me, so maybe practice what you preach, eh?
---
I have nerd rage as well but not active at all times
---
Viable? Yes. Optimal? No.
---
If you want to do high damage, just do a bloodied gunslinger build. You'll still melt everything.
---
Im asking the same question. And also, do the quests reset too? Like, I need to start the main questline all over again?
---
put those in your vendor. Brown 999 caps and green 4499 caps. if they don't sell lower the price a little. I usually get 3999+ for the green
---
There's another so you can wear one =0
---
I've seen some posts that gunsmith and white knight are currently bugged.
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/   disagrees with this statement.
---
Thank you, I knew I could scrap weapons for good amount of steel but now I feel pretty dumb realizing I could get some so easily with Line in the sand
---
That’s a fair point! I’m a member there as well, but it is frustrating that the sub that is supposed to be a central hub for the community is most often just a bitchfest
---
I'm level 280 and level 190 and I took an 8 month break. No cheats or hacks and I don't run unyielding on either.
---
Is that the one that got exposed for moderators actively scamming and covering up scams, or the one where they pretend the majority of their users aren't dupers? I keep getting them mixed up because the names are nearly identical. I thought you weren't allowed to mention either of them here though
---
I don't disagree with your assessment of this subreddit.  But if they allowed straight pics, it would just be filled with pictures of the same glitches and bugs and it would be annoying that way instead
---
*looks at my stealth gunslinger then shrugs*
---
Whenever I’m at max caps and have a few presents to open I find someone selling it for 25k and buy it. They must be in their camp for this to work. They are instantly max caps, wondering what idiot would pay that much for tp. Then they log off. Funny shit....
---
Siding with the settlers I believe
---
get a mule. I have 4 and all 4 are happy. Maybe it makes no scence but for this double xp weekend I realized that I have full set of unyeding armor. And I collect a lot blodied/junkie/2 shot weapons. U got what u love but as a heavy builder I have never found maxed lvl bloodied heavy weapon so i have 2 bloodied tesla and other sh!t and non of lightmachine/minigun/50cal etc.
---
If you accidentally kill a raider does it lower your reputation?
---
I'm sorry I'm buying only 3 bullets! Forgive me i have sinned
---
Rep glitch made leveling up 5 characters doable.
---
Genuine question, what do you honestly think is the point of the cap besides basically forcing players to play daily? Like I have never in my life seen a cap for a games most BASIC currency. Like imagine the outrage if WoW or ESO had a gold cap or ACTUALLY Destiny did have a glimmer cap but wasn't that done away with because it was a stupid system that didn't work?
---
thanks man much love 🙏✌️
---
Bloodied bash damage rolling pin for 12k caps you say? And yes I actually saw this last week.
---
it's an exploit. Whether it's bannable i don't know.
---
Simply fetch missions or speech checks, would be much better than free junk/ammo
---
What legacy are you using?
---
I saw another thread about this.  It’s an exploit/glitch
---
There's the appliance from the raiders, and the blueprint exploit that allows you to place the ammo manufacturer at any buildable area
---
Sure you did 😉 cos you can totally roll bash damage on melee weapons..
---
Most pvp fight are over in the first 5 seconds. And it’s totally irrelevant how well you can kill stuff in pve. Watch angry turtles video on pvp. It will give you an idea what’s happening.
---
oh damn, i didn't know about this!
---
Its all about preferences.
---
You'll find players prices all over the place 
---
I tend to move on from those players regardless of what they have.
---
Oh no the selling part isn’t hard, I can make treasure hunter outfits for next to nothing and sell them to clear out the 1400 a day in a few minutes, I literally just keep using up the 1400 daily caps fast traveling so much.
---
Yep. Definitely for the daily score challenge. I actually wish I knew this the 1st time I bought something for that challenge...I bought the entire stack of 1K+ shotgun shells from someone...I’m so dumb! 😂😂😂
---
Gotta love em :/ I sent a couple and my first was the same way
---
Genuine question but why is it you guys only respond to shallow casual like "feel good" or "I did this" posts usually instead of all the great and honestly usually pretty mature discussion posts on the games issues? Such as currency caps or time gates and such? 
---
Just seems like a big "F U" to all the people playing and fighting through the games issues to see all that so blatantly ignored.
---
Also. I like in Australia. We have lots of marsupials. Locally.....
---
Spread the love!
---
I think my camp proves the garden tiles work well. Although i do fairly well at placing my items proper. Ill have to get a snapshot to show it off a bit. Mostly is just an adhesive farm with some blueberries and razorgrain
---
u r welcome. some weapons give u 14-20 steel each.
---
It actually wasn't bash damage but it was a garbage 2nd roll lol.
---
I would most appreciate a snapshot.
---
Are you using travel agent?  How do you travel that much?
---
I know, hence why I said it's not the weapon that makes you good. I just know that I should at least see some health go down.
---
Keep replying and replying and replying
---
That's the weed number
---
Depends can I change its personality to match Bessie?
---
You can probably get good DMG with an instigating, or junkies build if you dont want to go the bloodied route. Do a J/I build coupled with VATS perks and you can pump out good numbers
---
I actually use it a lot. I have a resource node on my camp and with gold and cloth you can make a fine Civil War suit. It's a good chunk of my income.
---
Varies, but mostly AA laser Explosive
---
This statement is why I leave /r/pcmr whenever a new meme hits. All the decent posts disappear and it becomes just filled with shitty meme farming.
---
The exact same thing would happen just as /u/jiujtsupatricia described.
---
Ah. Then that is why I have never seen it before today.
---
Figures....lol
---
Arms. I wouldn't wear it with different arms, so it doesn't make sense to worry about 100 lbs of carry I wouldn't be using.
---
Better than a figurative pellet!
---
There are lots of areas with decent flat land. 
---
I have a series on Youtube for camp locations and jus did one a few weeks ago in the forest with flat areas near water.
---
Thanks
---
I have that plan, does it sell in the vendors? What price?
---
Same :)
---
So the game could crash every time we go for a ride like it does in FO4? Pass tyvm.
---
I named my mini gun bang bang owie. My flamer is ouch hot owie and my hammer is smash owie.
---
My 7 year old may have helped me name them.
---
You’re Welcome!
---
I dont mind it just a lot of people been doing it
---
He's like a really poorly programed synth or something.
---
Negative effects aren't too bad compared to the positive effects from them.
---
Her headaches.
---
They are permanent with starched genes, otherwise you can get rid of them with radaway. Class freak at rank 3 makes the negatives effects very easy to manage. With marsupial, it lowers the negative effect from -4 intelligence to -1 intelligence.
---
I feel like it’s always been like that in FO76 so it’s gotten to the point I don’t use VATS anymore
---
The extra dailies we've had the last week or so *are* the reparations.
---
Hmm, well first off, VATS does no damage in pvp  with most weapons since wastelanders, but if you were just aiming, there are ways to tank legacies easily. Quantum spamming ofc is the most common, but with the right gear no aid is required to tank most laser rifles.
---
My main char has a full set of assassin/ap refresh/sentinel heavy leather armor. With an ER backpack, I have well over 700 ER and can *easily* facetank most legacy weapons without aid. Exceptions are gatplasmas, quad/double prefix weapons... basically anything with a large enough mag will burn me eventually if I don’t use stimpacks or nukas. 
---
Without more information in your post, it is hard to tell what is really going on.
---
Just so you know the "suggested" value is still lower than vendor bot prices, so there's that. I think it's supposed to be a guideline for casuals or newer players that get something they may never use but have no idea the value of. It gives them a starting point to begin vending that item, if it doesn't sell in a reasonable amount of time then it is on the player to lower the price or dump it. I have a lot of experience vending so I know what sells and what doesn't, and as far as aid items go I literally only stock the stuff that I actually use for that character. Any aid in my stash, besides bobbles and mags, is on sale as an advisement for my build plus it makes it infinitely easier to pull a grape mentat out. Popular ammo is 2 caps because I don't "need" caps and I don't want to refill my machine with ammo every 5 minutes, but I have it in there if somebody reaallly needs it and to light up my camp on the map, also still cheaper than vendortrons. Every person has a different end game and mine is not restocking my machine every day.
---
The exploit can lead to a ban as all other exploits can too.
---
Its in the ToS which nobody reads with games these days.
---
Using it is silly as all you have to do is grind rep for Raiders to get one exactly like it at our camp.
---
Think smarter not harder is what they'd say until that ban/suspension email pops in the inbox
---
Without Starched Genes they are still permanent if you manage to not use Radaway, you can use Nuka Grape to cure radiation. Also, be careful when using Rad-X as it suppresses all effects from mutation, but Rad-X diluted fixes that.
---
Thank you for the hope I’ll get that red rocket garage and train prefab soon lmao
---
I sell like 400 plans, very few ever are more then 30 caps a peice, water for 4 caps, thinking of doing super stims for 20 since I've never had to use a stim in the game and now have like 160 super stims and the weight is to much
---
I'm a stealth and bow guy, hence I don't need armor I just use CSA from going the foundation route and a bow. This means I need no armor or ammo (apart from arrows) using up my weight. If I use this food and drink reduction I have space for days!
---
only low levels i believe. There's one inside morgantown terminal.
---
What I guess I should have said is that I didn't understand your question and because I didn't understand it I thought we were talking about different things.
---
Talentless fucks can't even knock out jukebox variants since release. I bet I could make an Appalachia Radio Jukebox in 5 minutes with the assets having been ready to go since FO4, and already existing in FO76, for fucks sake.
---
I'm sorry that you feel insulted. I'd provide numbers to convince you that it's OP but I have a feeling you already understand how broken it is. I have an feeling that you're the type that'll ignore facts and say anything to defend your crutch.
---
I swap stuff in public servers all the time.make sure both toons are at the same fast travel point ( I use the overseers camp) Just look around the map to see whose on the server go to social view their profile to make sure they can be joined, sometimes people out their status to offline. Drop the stuff in a bush or somewhere it would be kinda hard to find unless you know to look there. Quit and switch toons. Go to the social menu at the main menu find the person and join. I have yet to lose anything doing it this way but I might have just gotten lucky.
---
Same. One hour I saw it came back everything was gone.
---
I always feel like I've encountered legendary variants outside of the Christmas event. But then I can never remember actually encountering one
---
Get it before Tuesday! I think you’ll have time. Also with that garage door prefab comes a glitch as well, it doesn’t truly close. FYI.
---
I pay for the stupid shot cause I have plans for making different camps. But just an fyi
---
Thank you for clearing that up.
---
Put the grind in for the SS armor! Have a full set of unyielding SS armor along with Armor plating backpack and almost never die except for stupid  poison damage over time! Also use an Instigating Fixer and it’s OP on 98% of stuff. Usually hit for about 1100-1300 on the first hit
---
Instead of this brilliant dialogue with the development team you have conjured up?
---
I recently came back to the game and play solo. As in "bought  a month of First and am treating it as single player" solo. Other than the occasional bit of latency, it plays like a quieter Fallout game. NPCs are sparse.
---
We will see what happens when it comes time to launch a nuke and go after the SBQ...  May have to join a public server.
---
level 3 lock is highest and it can be picked
---
crafting and stuff uses your junk
---
daily S.C.O.R.E. challenge is buy or sell from a player vendor 3 times
---
It doesn't work in pvp and people never realized that the 95% isn't your hit chance, its the total damage
---
both of those sound like they could have some potential!
---
Will be on the look out for them, thanks for the info!
---
I’m aware. So I am always vigilant to make sure things aren’t used. So idk what happened. It’s just happened again today all of the stuff on my shelves are gone. Logged in and out nothing has come back yet.
---
They think that disconnecting the wires makes them not visible as a vendor.
---
If you find a vendor at a camp, you can buy no matter what.
---
Probably to save their cap sink
---
If they pick it they become wanted, so even a level 0 deters thieves
---
Golf clubs.  I am collecting legendary golf clubs.  I have three so far (don't remember the specs).  Soon I will don my golfing outfit and start teeing off on my enemies.  None will be able so stop me!  All across the wasteland they will tell stories of a mighty warrior with the battle cry of "Fore"!!!!!
---
Using a flame thrower trap
---
Exactly correct. Some people just want to shoot stuff and get their dailies out of the way while others surf the other vendors for that sweet sweet deal. Once you reach a certain point, there's nothing you want or need from in game vendors so you hope you find a unicorn at a player vendor.
---
Great tip. Thanks
---
Max caps, dont want to be bothered with it, theres a multitude of reasons
---
It does make them not appear on the map, but as you said they can still be used, need to hide them behind a wall
---
I’ll add you as well :) I don’t have a mic either.
---
I put them on a mule for a rainy day that will never come. Why do I do it? I don't know, it's pointless.
---
Weird. Never seen that one before... Which gun was it?
---
You are fully perked for commando?
---
Okay so the serums still work the same its just an easy way to get what mutation you want
---
i’ve seen 2 nukes in a week i guess xbox players don’t do this
---
Quantum spamming? Funny and coincidentally enough the player that led me to write this post had quantum spammer in his name
---
Big ass radscorpion?
---
About 2K hours, lvls 397, 358, 289, 237, 185.
---
Are you sure about that? Cos as I recall that didnt turn out so well..
---
Next to my camp is a permanent camp that has a searchable tent. I’ll put a Welcome basket of goodies in it. Hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste and of course toilet paper.
---
For a game that wants you to build camps, there are surprisingly few good spots to build one. If you want to try to fit in when building a diner or gas station, you should have flat ground next to a fairly major road. One need to to search far and wide to find the few spots, with level ground, not in the middle of a swamp, where one can imagine your camp might fit in. They have been releasing some interesting content for camp building, but most of it just doesn't fit in with world they gave us.
---
It was a laser rifle, the purple one I think. Tbh I was so tilted I turned off the system without getting a recording.
---
they travel in teams of 2, one picks, one shoots him gets the bounty they p camp to camp.  no deterrent, extra caps, hell of a life
---
None at the queen with 2 in completely random areas
---
Pvp and pve damage and damage resistance are completely different.  My bloody pvp character can be shot for 10 minutes and you won't hurt me, a radroach may wipe me out and is a real threat. This wasn't always the case but the more recent game of cola tesla has made it this way.
---
There are several large fossils in the game. Not sure if there is any info on them. There's a big one at the bottom of big maw.
---
Is that really true? There is no indication of hit chance?
---
Scorpions are boneless
---
This is true, people on your public team can still travel to your camp for free and browse your wares even if your vendor signal is off.
---
There aren't too many cap sinks in the game. You can but all the serums. And plans for everything. But if their anything like me I don't need every single plan in the game. Im still working on getting the gear I need which is all gold bullion and legendary modules at this point which caps can't buy through players vendors robovenders or purveyor. I've started putting every single plan I already know or don't want in my vendor for a single cap. Weapons and armor dirt cheap unless I'm saving them for the next day or two for script. So it's possible they only pick up what they need and leave everything else so they don't have anything to sell.
---
When I got home triple nuked 3 servers on 3 different characters because of this post.
---
Not necessarily, my heavy gunner has full sent ass heavy combat, you won't see my health drop
---
I’m glad they don’t allow pics. It just becomes a lazy karma farm for people. So many other subs have been ruined by allowing it.   I mean, r/dnd has  been  ruined  from  nothing  but  people  posting  their  characters,  there’s  no  actually  discussion  about  the  game  and  you  have  to  go  to  other  subs  for  actual  discussion.  r/Pokemon was  the  same  way,  so  much  they  even  had  to  create  rules  to  limit  pictures  on  some  days.  
---
Plus with all the strife, it would be like what’s going on the trading sub where people are just posting a bunch of memes right now.  
---
Besides, You can post pictures, you just can’t make a picture as the post itself (I mean, just the other day someone posted a whole slew of awesome pictures they took). You just need to make some actual effort to the post rather than a title and imgur link.
---
there was a bug recently that caused your vendors and displays to empty.
---
Players probably just goofing around having fun in their own way.
---
Yes. Also, the serum suppresses the negative effects for a real life hour. I have all my mutations with serums, since they are relatively cheap and you get exactly what you want. If you just try the get enough rads route, you would get a random one, and that could be something you don’t want.
---
Two shot, Explosive, and beam splitters. 
---
The three sisters of CND destruction
---
Yup, I always put them behind a wall
---
They have to pay their bounty from their own caps pool. If they don’t they get a 24 hour debuff. They don’t actually make any money, just move it between accounts
---
Just really sucks. :/
---
Scorpion bones are on the OuTsIdE
---
Also heard that it may have to do with your camp being over budget. But I’m not sure. It’s just disappointing.
---
The 2 that nuked random locations probably got shit for wasting nukes
---
No that's my point, I'm never speced into PvP so I know it's my fault for biting but surely has to be some give if they are the aggresor. It's not like I'm going around trying to shoot people. I'm not bothered either way but just total madness
---
Deathclaw?
---
[This page helps with that.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards) ;-) Take care.
---
The base price is lower than what a vendor bot would sell it. Serums are around 4000 if you buy it from Modus. 
---
So if the sell it for 2000, your still getting it cheaper then if you bought it off a vendor. But in general I sell serums for 400-600. The recipes cost 17,000 and up. They all take one kind of flux to make. And they aren’t all equally popular. 
---
So it’s still selling it for cheaper.
---
It all really depends on a few factors for me. Ammo, I sell cheaper than base. Plans, if it’s common camp decorations, I go lower. Unless they are things like plans from Fasnacht. 
---
But also. It’s their business what to set the prices at. I wish people would stop being upset over what other people choose to price things. 
---
It’s not your place to set standards of what you think is right.
---
They at max caps prob
---
Its a whale i think
---
I usually just buy ballistic fiber in bulk from the train station vendors since you can never have enough of that.
---
I have full sentinel/assassin bos I don't wear it anymore though. I stopped playing for a few months and people said it hit nerfed so gone secret service unyeilding now
---
Gauss shotguns are explosive out of the box tho
---
Read the description in help on the main menu.  The greater your perception the better your hit chance
---
I had 4000 before I finally realized why I couldn't carry anything.
---
Why are people downvoting you??
---
It was, but not enough to make it not worthwhile
---
Even the snapping is just... abysmal....
---
I've just moved camp for the 2nd time since BETA and it's the first time since wastelanders, so I had to redesign.
---
Now imagine a shack with a standard wood wall 3x3 frontage. No Atom shop items.. No funky wall paper or building skin kits, no signs or anything.. except now imagine that the basic wooden walls. Just. Won't. Snap....
---
Now I'm left with squares 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 inside out. The best thing about this setup is that panel 8 is the door, so that now swings out and hits you in the face.. Champion.
---
Don't even get me started on fences.
---
Why can't we just have a dirt or grass texture foundation to allow us the pleasure of squaring stuff up as we have to use them anyway?
---
Gauss minigun.
---
The Giants from Skyrim had to come from somewhere right? Lol
---
Whale
---
I'm sure there would be an argument about performance issues, CAMP budget etc for why that cant happen but they could incorporate the ability to gain one through the Ally system. Give us an ally questline to help some robotics expert and as the end reward they give us our own customised robot
---
I sell super stims for 15 and nobody wants them. Thinking I may have to drop to between 5 and 10 caps. Good luck at 20.
---
There’s also a whale skeleton at the bottom of the Big Maw.
---
Maybe it’s your settings. Everything on my PC still looks the same as it did before the wastlanders. Have you checked them?
---
Everyone is at max caps these days. I’d love to open my vendors to the world but I can’t even find something “frivolous” to buy. We need more cap sinks!
---
I usually wait to fire off Encryptid at the 6:00 left mark.  By then I figure we got who we'll get.  It's 50/50 if somebody else fires it off by 8:00 though.
---
They don't much like the devs here.
---
PM sent
---
From what I seen no, but I have a ton of lights so I wouldn't know
---
if they switch back and forth, how much are they losing?
---
i play on ps4 but i’m only like level 77 😔
---
I'm willing if you are. Level 69 or 309
---
I love all of the unknown skeletons in this game. So many aquatic looking skeletons in the toxic valley, the weird bird-looking skeleton near Seneca Rocks, this guy (and the monster within Lucky Hole). I really hope that they never fully answer all of the mysteries of this universe and just keep sprinkling in some bread crumbs now-and-then.
---
Some kind of whale I think. I've seen several of them, in ponds at toxic valley and lower chambers of some caves.
---
Like 5 caps each time
---
Jeeze that's not even worth it I get 14 from a vendor
---
If you aren't spec'd the AAE laser isn't that strong.
---
I’ve been bugging them on Twitter. But question is which one should I do it on more? Also I tried to submit another ticket to support detailing why I was denied. I also made a tweet to Bethesda support calling them out for my suspension but I don’t gain any kind of publicly. The best I’ve gotten was 8 likes on my tweet asking Bethesda to uh ban or un suspend innocent people on their latest tweet and I got some replies supporting me which I hoped inspired others. I know some pole made bot accounts constantly posting on anything Bethesda related posting evidence Bethesda seriously fucked up.
---
I just want to play the damn game man why does it have to be hard...
---
What do you mean?
---
Always during Scorched Horde events, too. And those guys are usually higher levels. Same RNG pool of goods despite their rarity though.
---
It's better to use both Adrenaline(5) and gun fu(1), at least thats what I use in my stealth commando/rifleman/archer build.  
---
This is my current build/gear if you want to check it out:   [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f438f8&amp;d=pi2ph2pg2lu2lt2l71p02an2ao0a30ic4a04ar2e82a51eu0pp2ir2cu2s01s60&amp;w=i12iq2if2lm2at1ii0ik0ie2c52pk2pd2pl2ib4c62p10pt2pu2pv2pn2i30ij2ia0i50pa0p90p80&amp;m=51c249fe836i&amp;am=182231-182232-182233-182230-182234&amp;wp=w6w5wa&amp;wm=142535-142935-142935](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f438f8&amp;d=pi2ph2pg2lu2lt2l71p02an2ao0a30ic4a04ar2e82a51eu0pp2ir2cu2s01s60&amp;w=i12iq2if2lm2at1ii0ik0ie2c52pk2pd2pl2ib4c62p10pt2pu2pv2pn2i30ij2ia0i50pa0p90p80&amp;m=51c249fe836i&amp;am=182231-182232-182233-182230-182234&amp;wp=w6w5wa&amp;wm=142535-142935-142935)
---
Nearly 300 hours in and I had no idea...
---
Hear Hear!
---
As a hoarder - I get up to 2,3 or 4k Gunpowder and flip shit when I don't know why I'm out of stash space.
---
I'm practicing a more minimalist-utilitarian style the last couple days. I cap all junk at 200, still doesnt leave a ton of room if you're into collecting all the cool rare event items...
---
I started this new account right before Fastnacht, and you know I'm keeping every single one of those masks. Now I'm gunning for all the Cryptid mascot heads - dat sheepsquatch head is my jam when i'm not german jestering around ;)
---
I was thinking the same thing but I'd rather they went to someone who would use them rather than selling them to a bot.
---
Shoot me a friend request my psn is 
---
Moskyrath_
---
More than willing to play with others and what not. I do have a mic and can hop on almost whenever except for weekends only other time I may not be on is stuff with family but I'm still available a good chunk of the time
---
Found a 3-star during the SBQ fight a couple of nights ago. Probably the only one I’ve ever seen.
---
Arktos Pharma nightmares!!!!
---
I threw literally 30+ random low tier legendaries on the ground today.  I kept maybe 4 or 5 of the best ones.  I already have all the plans and don't really need caps.  Putting them in a vendor just eats up all of my stash space. Normally, when time is not of the essence and it isn't double XP weekend, I'd drop them in a suitcase at a train station.
---
Remember when you'd fire it and use EVERY SINGLE FUSION CELL!
---
Clever!
---
so my 5 caps goes to you your 5 caps go to me... don't really lose any money do we?
---
Bethesda Fix fix fix. And give us ETA. (1) Menu needs changing. Social needs to go up up before atomic shop, I am fed up scrolling to see which friends are online and you keep adding new menus in wrong places - I have only 1s to go there before joining NW message kicks in. (2) item Wheel not showing for the first minute. (3) most annoying - disbanded teams after each NW game. Fix this fast before friends forget how to be friendly. (4) camp overlapping area when it does not overlap. Again, Annoying. (5) occasionally you accidentally go into adventure mode instead of NW as it does not ask for confirmation at all. Swap the icons round or add a confirmation menu, it is not difficult.
---
Really?
---
Nope. Just transfers back and forth
---
Oh aye. forgot about those. Still. Only seen the low levels outside of that
---
Use the gauss shotgun. Broken in VATS, less ammo consumption, insane DMG per shot, and in personal opinion: looks cooler 
---
The gauss minigun is amazing, but its ammo consumption is far too high for it to be a primary weapon
---
Not really
---
The Only Legendary Scorched i encountered was actually my first scorched on my first play through. Dude had a grognack axe
---
Sadly no
---
For general stuff shotgun is good but for stuff like scorchbeast queen or wendigo colussus you'll want the minigun. I myself run around with a junkies gauss shotgun and a bloodied handmade. Got damage perks for both and some sneak perks with a few oddball perks. Only time I use handmade is the previous mentioned bosses and cargo bot.
---
if you stand on the blue console to the left coming into the main room, you can vats everything and even freeshoot any gouls that somehow get behind the fenced off room. it's very easy to solo the event from that spot provided of course that you get the ores. cheers and hope that it helps!
---
I’m pretty sure. I didn’t think much of it until I had already left, and it still only dropped a 1-star item, but the rads could also just be getting to my mind.
---
Unarmed, because of game design. Some mutations give unarmed an advantage over the others, plus swing speed + higher damage overall. 
---
My unarmed ninja uses a knife because I like the looks, and it overkills, but when I go unarmed, numbers get insane. What would be a 2200 sneaky stab becomes a 6000 punch.
---
Only if it is like Bessie!
---
Nuke cards are easy to get and there is not much end-game content. Players just probably goofing around.
---
This is an AMAZING idea!
---
My psn is psycotictron if dont mind older group who drink and laugh and talk alot of stuff with each other than we your group :)
---
Can you spend the 450 while they're bugged and visible?
---
I should have specified but I was thinking of making the build for the new WC event and scorch beast queen or just for melting high health enemies
---
Sort of glad to know that one day caps won't be so hard to accumulate. New player and recently got the 1000 cap reward from the legendary run. Lol. Was 4 times what I'd accumulated in 15 levels juat playing and exploring thus far. Moxed feelings on this info though overall. Gotta say it sucks that there eventually won't be enough stuff to spend them on though, endgame. Also sucks that there is a max cap limit at all, period. Wtf is that about?
---
most of us did too for a while there
---
I had this for the longest time. Launched at least 10 nukes with my buddy from site Charlie and he would make fun of me that I still couldn’t fast travel there yet. So decided to try and discover it before a nuke run and found the spot where it becomes discoverable. Its just outside the shack near the elevator entrance is located but walk the fence line slow and stand for a few seconds. Took a minute to find it but finally have it discovered. 🤘😎
---
I’m so far behind I’m not concerned
---
Have you tried contacting any of the groups who help low level players start up their files?
---
You could probably just sell in bulk at like 4 or 5 a peice to one of them
---
As long as you have an account connected to Xbox Live, PS+, or whatever else is online, you’ll be good
---
I wasn't saying that there was necessarily anything wrong happening here (or at least I didn't mean for it to come across like that) it's just if I'm having a private conversation with a family member or my best friend or something while playing a video game then I don't really want some stranger popping in. Had I known that you could make a party chat private or that you could kick people out of the chat I  would have either just done it or asked "how do I make a party chat private?" or "how do I kick people out of a party chat?" on an Xbox forum, subreddit, or something like that instead of making a post on here.
---
God yes!!!
---
The awful shine makes the Fallout 1st Ranger Armor (which should be the coolest thing ever) look like a children's raincoat. Bautista pls fix
---
I started playing about 2 weeks ago and same here been playing it everyday and love it so much, I got it because my mate got it and said he’s loving it and with the new update it’s awesome so I got fallout 76 on sale for only $10 and I have never enjoyed a game this much with only spending $10 I’m so in love with it, the only things that are bad in this game is the low frame rebate you get sometimes and it’s got a fair few bugs and glitches other than that it’s so good
---
Ps4 and Xbox you need live
---
Honestly never heard of such a thing.
---
For those I recommend the minigun due to its fire rate. Better to have a constant damage than a couple cannon shots
---
I know I'm not speced and like I said I'm not saying the gun is the key but with then attacking me first that gives me the edge and so surely there has to be some give?
---
Mine is in my UFO next two two alien plushes and a sign saying "FREE ABDUCTIONS!"
---
IF they end up compensating people for all of this, beyond the extra dailies and weeklies they're already throwing around, they're not just going to do it in the middle of the season and while the bug is still possibly unresolved.  
---
It's in their best interest at the very least to wait until they're absolutely sure the bug is fixed rather than handing shit out on demand right now because then they can just automate the process based on bug/customer service reports and their recent logging rather than having to go in and hand out atoms/score every time someone sends in a report.
---
They're HIGHLY unlikely to do so though because until they added the logging there's likely been no way to actually track any of this shit meaning that you can just tell them you lost your dailies even if you never lost a single one just to get the free atoms/score.
---
That's why instead of using the honor system for doing direct refunds they're primarily focusing on throwing double exp and double score and extra dailies and weekly challenges at everyone, because it's easier to take a shotgun approach that just benefits everyone than have to take a fine toothed comb and pick out just the people that were impacted.
---
I wouldnt say it's terrible but I don't believe they do, or can account for market demand. I been using it since i started and I don't use it as a beckett price guide but more of a comparison tool and like you said good to see if something is just script.  But for example if I look up my bloodied limb damage tesla it says its script fodder but if I sell it I know its in demand ive already had people trying to pry it away from me. Lol But says my sledge is worth 40k but cant get a decent offer for it?
---
Also admantium skeleton helps with the crippled limbs
---
Ok thanks
---
you don't need to pay nothing more to play the full game+wasteland and season 1 ATM, only if you wanna an private world then you pay for fallout 1st, and on the shop have some skins and QoL that you can get them playing the game and wining some atoms.
---
edit: as others statement you do need ps plus or Xbox live to be able to play on ps4/xbox
---
I love the gauss minigun but it eats ammo like goldfish at a preschool. Use the shotgun for everything but the toughest enemies.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't have an online pass required to play. Your platform might (like PS+, Xbox Live, etc). You can load it up and be good to go. The "vanilla" version of the game is the same version we all have now. The updates are all free, as is the multiplayer (the entire game is online). The only thing you pay for is atom shop items (primarily cosmetics in the game) or Fallout 1st, which is an optional subscription that gives you a scrapbox (for all your junk), a private server to use, monthly atoms, etc. You absolutely do not need it to play.
---
It's nonsense. It's the hit chance, but it's bugged.
---
Rah rah and Gail. Also the settlers are losers and they can get f#{^ed.
---
Yea I've encountered a couple posts on the fallout page of people posting their "branded starter kits" or somthing of that sort trying to give a little kick back to lower level players trying to make getting into the game easier and fun
---
If you're in the stealth suit, go Fire Proof.
---
Gauss shotgun. It's imo one of the best guns in the game, certainly the best shotgun. It's damage output alone is insane, and it isn't as much of an ammo guzzler as the gauss minigun. One warning though: if you're too close to your target with it, there's a chance you could get blown up.
---
Man those things were invaluable for survival mode.
---
If I were you, I'd try the unarmed melee/sneaky approach.  Don't rush into the fray, target the stragglers.  If you are comfortable running low health, unyielding, nerd rage and adrenal reaction would up your damage tremendously, even with non legendary weapons. Don't worry much about dying, you won't lose much as long as you remember to store your junk often.
---
with a grape mentat I get 16 caps for each..I usually make up 20-30 suits for each trip..
---
Let us scrap ammo for lead and gunpowder. Bam. Solve the whole ammo converter shitshow.
---
You need the circus cage trailer plan for these doors, they dropped from the mole miner pails. You’ll have to buy them off another player unfortunately.
---
ha! true :)
---
It'd be nice if they could be broken down to regular stimpacks so I could break them down to diluted.
---
The proximity to the pond in the summer are giving me mosquito vibes... Or bloodbug rather. Awesome C.A.M.P though!
---
smells like jealousy in here, nobody is buying from your vendors? boohoo.
---
Did a lot of this two nights ago to unlock all the holiday rewards!
---
Circus cage plans. Go to the market pages
---
Yea, I haven't diluted anything since I was about level 60 tho by the time anything gets close enough to touch me I'm usually being swarmed and need to slam stims
---
I think it only doubles daily challenges
---
Be that just a 2nd set or double SCORE reward. Someone correct me if in wrong cause I'm not 100%
---
A lot of weapons have VATS issues since Wastelanders was released, they know about it, but a fix who knows.
---
Try Vats then back out then vats, works sometimes.
---
Bro I don’t mind levels I just want new friends to play this boring game

Ps4?

Great question!
---
What  platform
---
Well it wouldn’t hurt to try and not complete weekly till the double score starts.
---
It's because you put an "s" on the end of *Whitespring* for no reason.  The game hates when you do that.
---
I don’t mind at all sound like my group of guys I’m ll—sinful—ll
---
I have the plans if your on xbox.
---
I'm bloody/nerd raging it. Full stims seem like a waste when I can get 4 (with a chance at 8) diluted from each one.
---
It's a whale skeleton recycled from Fallout 4. There are a few scattered around the map, despite not making sense for the area. They would have been better off recycling the mammoth skeletons from Skyrim.
---
It’s shows up in the dark but doesn’t illuminate the area. Same with firefly and frog
---
It's not that, you likely played on a world where your camp couldn't be placed and crafted something. It dumps your junk back into your stash when you do that.
---
Just don't play on worlds your camp can't be placed in.
---
I've been lucky most of the sets I haven't been too interested in. I know at some point they are going to do a BOS or Enclave set and its gonna get me.
---
Hell yeah man I’m okay with that
---
I assumed everything had a chance to be.  I killed a low level 3* wolf today that was attacking the guy that had Wards stolen medical equipment
---
Thank you so much. Makes me feel better knowing that could have been the reason and you are probably correct  I was on a world that I couldn’t place my camp but I was positive I hadn’t crafted anything. But thank you. I was really about to be discouraged.
---
Booting the departments gives you an extra 15-20 mobs to kill.  5 when you boot department B, then run the rest of the building and boot department C on the way out.5 will almost instantly spawn and then 5 more high level ghouls including "J47" will spawn after about 45 seconds.  Usually at least one legendary in those 15, more often 2.  You will see at least 2 legendaries in the building elsewhere, usually one in the central dome on random levels and another crawling out of rubble either in the raider room or in the east end of the second floor.  I've had as many as 6.  There are 62 total ghouls to be had there, for an average of 30K xp for me during double XP.  I probably should do a video on how to run the DMV, because I farm XP every day and it is my second favorite spot.  Westek is still tops but the DMV consistently has more legendaries and is a very short run. Whitesprings has more ghouls, but takes far longer to clear.  About twice as long.
---
Edit:
---
Just ran all three locations.  I had a few food/chem/rest boosts but no lunchboxes, cranberry stuff or team bonus used in this run.
---
DMV - 62 Ghouls, avg 600 exp.  37,200 xp 4 legendaries. Very Fast.
---
Whitesprings - 80 Ghouls (Didn't kill the robots) avg 550 exp., 44000 xp.  1 legendary. Slow. Twice as long as DMV
---
Westek - 55 mixed Super Mutants and Dogs, Avg 800 exp.  44000 xp. 3 legendaries.  Fast.
---
Haven’t tried.  I’m  just hoarding atoms tbh.  Especially now that there aren’t daily atom challenges.  I was really diligent about logging on and doing all of the dailys/weekly + a month of 1st membership
---
They are fossils. You need to take a picture of a fossil for one of the pioneer scout challenges
---
I bash people on accident sometimes, sorry.

oh okay feel free to add me then ☺️ kalenkos
---
My psn is ll—sinful—ll
---
I was just curious about it since I jad never seen it before today. Now that I know its an exploit I want nothing to do with it.
---
With the right perks and armor I've tanked the hacked 50cal long enough to kill the people using it and that thing does 1000+ damage if perked and low hp. It isn't difficult at all to tank the AAE laser, especially when the user isn't perked.
---
Cool. How often do you play
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

The raider waster bundle, sorry i took so long, i upvoted and followed u and just came back ti this, unfortunately it is no longer on sale. Maybe, just maybe, the raider scabber bundle ALSO includes the emote, it's not a big deal tho, just saying hello like the tricentennial emote but with 2 fingers instead of the entire hand. Again, sorry i took so long.

Not responsible for the sudden deaths of mobs by blue laser beams of explosive death.
---
Other people are having this issue as well including me. Wastelanders definetly changed things. I notice it most on the hardwood floors when you try and make a dark room but the floors turn like an opaque white almost. Really annoying
---
Aaron homestederidge farm remembers
---
My favorite was when Grahm showed up just prior to the Fasnacht parade.
---
I'm DogDad7.  I'm on now. Do you talk
---
No problem. Happened to me more times than I'd like, but since I stopped playing on worlds where my camp is missing it hasn't happened once.
---
 No I had a bad day
---
Sorry man, happens to everyone. I hope your day gets better.
---
Thank you! That gives me a lot more hope having that info. I will definitely stick to that.
---
I’m down! Level 77 in game, level 38 real life.
---
The garage door on the red rocket prefab is the most difficult 2 hours I have played in this game.
---
I believe its only for dailies not weekly.
---
Agree
---
Yeah, I didn't even install the door from the issues I've had at other people's camps.
---
Are the below examples enough for you?
---
Cant get rid of it unless you move your camp. Only known method as of now. Sorry mate
---
God! Isn’t that insane? Thanks
---
Bethesda can’t manually remove it?
---
Try starting a new character? That's what I did. I have a level 351 on Xbox and all I do is farm gold and script hoping for a good legendary roll one day. Also hoping high level people do either Radiation Rumble or Project: Paradise. Need all the plans.
---
Probably, no idea if you can get them to do that though
---
I'm sorry who where you again?
---
I hope so because I really don’t want to have to redo my whole base :/
---
Personally I just want to have 0 rep with raiders for the sole reason I can obliterate them easily and it's also fun to have shallow insults thrown at you while you gun them down
---
Yup, travel agent is an essential perk.
---
After popping a few lunch boxes I start an XP run, kill the three sentry bots at whitesprings, fast travel to the vantage to kill the nearby behemoth, then to the substation north of watoga and kill the glowing deathclaw, then I fast travel to the bog workshop and kill the behemoth and mutants there. Then I individually fast travel to the different super mutant spots in the savage divide and mire, Huntersville, West Tek, the nearby dish, the dam in the mire, sunnytop top and bottom, then I end the run at hopewell cave and kill the Deathclaw there. Then I fast travel to whitesprings station and log out of my private world and wait 5 minutes for everything to reset then repeat the process as many times as I can.
---
It should be a serum instead, can't understand why it's a perk card.
---
I’m only level 19 irl :( damn I’m falling be hind
---
Yup I’m on now
---
Only to dailies
---
Pulse Grenades. Use Pulse Grenades. Then run behind it and attack. It’s insanely easy to kill them from behind. 
---
Ra-ra gives you pulse grenades right before that room. She tells you what they’re for. 
---
Perhaps the child has wisdom you should heed.
---
This is some mystery! Just like the mystery of the missing shovel!
---
I remember running out of ammo on this quest because I under estimated the enemy levels. And then spend 3 hours beating the rest to death with nothing but the pipe wrenches i would find. 
---
So painfully agitating. But it was a new challenge lol

I excepted your friend request

Covid 19 made this too real.

Laziness.

I like her, but I hated that mission. I got disconnected halfway through and it has no checkpoints so I had to start again.
---
RadShield doesn’t surpress the mutations.
---
that is my go to as well. It is usually great except when it bugs out and removes you from the event the moment you put on the mask.
---
What are you talking about you never responded earlier
---
Is it still possible the earn those skins from Forbidden Knowledge? I've turned in Tech Data and still nothing. We're they removed for Fractured But Whole DLC?
---
I combo a melee build and have speed freak and marsupial mutations, so I can normally stay away from them pretty effectively of swap to melee or flamers if they get up on my face. I prefer to save the perks to prevent backsplash damage.
---
Congrats I just maxed Raider yesterday haha
---
Still working on Settlers... I look forward to never speaking to Ward again.
---
Blaming it on a bug? I know it was YOU who kicked me from the group! All because I was blasting  fastnacht music over voice and doing non-stop dancing emojies! How could you?!?
---
I really don’t know if you can still get them, but I was fortunate to buy the plan for 15K
---
Currently, I don't have any perk cards related to armor specifically. I do use Blocker and Ricochet. Since Power Armor has hidden (e.g. unlisted) buffs to DR/ER/RR it's very useful. Especially if you use a max level Excavator PA with Calibrated Shocks for a total carry weight increase of 200 pounds not to mention lead farming at Luck Hole Mine.

Cola nut perk in endurance makes nuka cola quantums the best healing item in the game, and they have no use animation so people can just spam them to survive everything
---
Agreed. 
---
It’s my nuke. If I want to drop it at Mount Blair then that’s where it’s going.
---
I will do the same thing I did when i receive thumbs down........WHAT!?
---
I'm having the same problem, I have 1200 atoms from buying fallout 1st but now every time I get atoms from challenges or the legendary run they are separated. I have 620 atoms from challenges, etc and 1200 from fallout 1st.
---
When I enter the store I only see 1200, and those 600 I have I can't use them, and they are accumulating because of the challenges. What can I do to merge both atoms?
---
My Bethesda username is heidenka and I play on Steam.
---
I was talking about the other people who replied to your response to my comment. Jfc
---
If you've played FO4 and seen some assaultrons that are NOT broken in FO76, you'd know that they actually are supposed to charge their head laser.
---
Oh!!! You startled me there!!
---
Lol typos
---
Yeah they did but you didnt . unless your gonna sit there and take credit for their answers
---
#Bastards. Thanks I'm enlightened now. This is kinda of what I mean by the greasy/sweaty PvP'ers. You have casuals who just like playing the game then you get these boys going balls deeps just to win a 3 second fight 😎😶
---
If they dont respond or you have extra I'm very interested!
---
Go big or go home.
---
TBH ive been getting smoked more by bush wookie teams that work together lately compared to actual teams that are out hunting. It has really forced me to slow down when moving through the brush and stick to the roads more since I run solo a lot. 
---
Sneaking through some bushes and 4 guys with 50 cals open up on you in an ambush is no joke!
---
😁👍🏽
---
Yes, Bethesda really needs to fix this BS. Sometimes, when I go to a silo, I'd have to deal with Assaultrons whose head laser is bugged &amp; fire indefinitely. Even with my PA, it does tremendous damage. It makes it even more irritating with no cover. I have to burn through a few Stimpaks to stay alive after taking the damage.
---
 Crap, why's that so big ^^. Also how do you hotkey other healing items on console other than stimpaks, I've been wondering that for a while.
---
I wasn’t taking credit, point is your question was answered and you didn’t even acknowledge it. Lmao
---
Spoiler alert - he'll still keep his eye on you.
---
Will pulse grenades also help me with the bugs where robots don't spawn or when you are unable to talk to RaRa?
---
I did actaully read the comments
---
Sent I’m ll—sinful—ll
---
[Ice Cube liked that]
---
Bloodied gauss rifle max rifle man perks max bloody mess max nerd rage max demo expert and adrenal reaction mutation.
---
She thinks your a meanie poop head anyway.
---
Power armor displays!
---
Also, lets add ammo cases, BOS supply boxes, BOS antenna (like the ones you have to click on during the BOS quest), and a Sarah Lyons ally companion (because she hot). Just don't give her any voice lines about headaches and keep her away from guitars please.
---
I think all of them can be, I've seen radroaches and eyebots as 3 star. Legendary scorched seem to be exceedingly rare, even at scorched horde events. I've seen 4 in over 2000 hours
---
The lowest I’ve seen was a legendary Rad Roach and Rad Rat (saw both bear my camp today actually). Also seen legendary radstags.  Haven’t seen anything smaller though.
---
I had a two star legendary rat outside of Uranium Fever a day ago.
---
With all the mods on it? 5k I'd say
---
Yeah my first thought reading this was, grenades, pulse preferred. Frag grenades and mines for protections and the assaultrons
---
Oof you play on console yeah the pvp there is awful from what I’ve seen. So many scrubs relying on teslas to get kills. Not sure how hotkeying works on consoles, but I have an MMO mouse and I can use the buttons on the side for the favorites wheel, really helps cut down time that would be spent scrolling
---
I typed my message on the wrong internet tab. That's what I get for being drunk...
---
Nevertheless, I stand by it!
---
A 3* Liberator. He actually gave me a decent gun.
---
I never saw a Legendary Scorched so far.
---
Never ran into that one. First I’ve heard of it, actually. I’ve run that quest three times now and never had issues with non-spawning robots or a frozen Ra-Ra
---
Maybe try a little less snark that I didn’t solve all of your problems and more appreciation that I gave a helpful suggestion to part of your issue?
---
Have a good day, bud.
---
Bonus effects specific to matching suits sound alike a good idea. Like damage against *abominables* in X-01, or extra energy and damage resist while in T-51
---
I glitch through from the second I get out of the elevator
---
Right tool and/or tactic for the right job. 
---
Not every situation calls for Leroy Jenkins.
---
What would you do for no mods?
---
I'm not certain why this was being downvoted. Only saying that not everyone who is lower level is weak. Some people have multiple characters and know how to specialize for damage. I just don't understand why people would give a level 58 the thumbs down for showing up for the queen as long as they can contribute. I don't like it when level 10s show up to leech XP, but as long as someone can contribute, they can join the fight.
---
No way you did.
---
Never heard of this. Following to possibly learn something new.
---
That's infuriating when low levels just show up, tag, and hide.
---
Probably 2k-2500. You can get the plans to make the pieces for free from the quest otherwise I would charge a bit more for something like t-51
---
Wait for the Holidays.  
---
*jingle, jingle, jingle*
---
Parks? Are you from Boston? Lolz
---
Years ago? Its not even 2 years old. Lol
---
It’s funny how a lot of players never think past having one Uber weapon for all occasions. I see so many with spray bullets weapons who end up not being very effective.
---
If build your camp beside the construction equipment south of whitesprings (marked by snake on the map), you will have a sentry bot at your camp. It's cool, but it will regularly explode.
---
no please no, I don't wanna them atacking things with out my consent or stand by doors, bugging on objects and getting lost in the world making me search for them on all map like skyrim made me do. please hell no.
---
Yes please!
---
It has them lol, the captain cosmos skin
---
i have about 20 rolls in my legendary loot vendor that i have set at 2020 caps. along with a few surgical masks for 3k each lol. nobody buys them but i get a few chuckles out of it.
---
I pvp + kill anyone I can, workshops, event, train stations; IDGAF. If ur on server ur fair game. I took away vendor long time ago so ya can’t see my camp
---
The only ones that don't exist are Legendary Critters (Cats, Squirrels, Frogs, Fireflies, etc.).
---
I couldn't believe today when I had a 3* Protecton turn up at Red Rocket Mega Stop... As in, the FRIENDLY red robots..... I've never seen a legendary with a white health bar.
---
"Forgive me friend." (Executes robot....)
---
I’d argue that the carry weight for a bloodied power armor build is still too low, but for bloodied builds, power armor works well. That being said, unyielding armor is better: provides more bonuses, and pairs with both dodgy and serendipity. With secret service armor now in, you have even more rad, energy, and ballistic defense than on any other previous unyielding set. To top it off, you get to wear a pack pack on regular armor, that can be modified to either give you +120 carry weight, or make food or aid items weight virtually nothing. And for higher health builds, power armor looses a lot of benefits, not least of which is the emergency protocols. I dunno man, just seems like it needs more love.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I'd just like the heavy and missle turrets to be able to take a hit, if lv 54 liberators come to my workshop they one shot any turret if they get lucky enough to hit it. The damage they deal is fine, but they really need a HP boost. Generally any enemy with a gun when your 50+ will destroy all your turrets unless its like the scorched, as they can't seem to ever hit the broad side of a barn. But super mutants? robots? kiss most of your turrets good bye.
---
Also fuck mole rats, seriously fuck mole rats, I hate it when I have to defend workshop from those, they are easy as hell, but they are also some of the most annoying bastards in the game, radscorps are just as bad, cept they are boss-level mole rats that are a pain in the ass to kill. I hate them because they have a habit of burrowing under right as I go to hit them, then when they pop out of their holes, i've had them pop out inside of walls, meaning I can never finish the event, as once they end up in a wall, they never come out, and sometimes grenades etc cannot hit them with their explosion radius.
---
Regarding the farm tiles, just make blueprints of crops that are really tight together and then bring them in. It’s impossible to get most crops tight if you individually place them. 
---
I have like 5 gourds stacked right on top of each other that takes up the same placement as 1 for instance.
---
Crap I forgot how broken companions are in Bethesda games
---
forgot to add the “2” but regardless, a simple reward system can’t even be implemented right
---
Like others said, lucky hole for lead, Line in Sand for steel, also west Tek for steel. If you prime it, it's much more ammo efficient.
---
I will admit I’ve relied a lot on my Instigating Gauss Shotgun, but I still know to switch over to something else for SBQ fights.
---
I read from some other posts about roll backs? But idk how true that is tbh.
---
I've seen those protections inside West tech that you can come out of terminals that are friendly be three star
---
Honestly.. if I was in your shoe I’ll just buy scrap bulks
---
When ps5 come out I’m ganna have a mule account with my ps4 to hold stuff lol on alts
---
My bloodied GMG can solo the queen in about 2 minutes. I don't know how it gets there, or why it never invites me. *rim-shot*
---
Because I saw that I can get an ammo generator.
---
https://youtu.be/L1nVYkS6H3U
---
This.
---
The engine can’t support companions like that it’s way too much programming for a online multiplayer game, they’ve stated this with wastelanders and is why they only stay at your camp
---
You can max out both of them?  Always thought it was a "pick one" kind of thing like with WoW - helping one faction decreases your rep with the oother.
---
I hope it was this.
---
I have used the same 3 star fire axe for over 100 levels. Furious, 40% more damage on power attacks, +1 agi. The thing can do massive amounts of damage sometimes. 
---
But I carry several ranged weapons, for different use. But carry lots of grenades. Some mines.
---
Save the broken mainframes aand keep them in your stash so every run you make you already have them ready to repair and swap them out you'll never have to find them again.
---
I saw a few legendary rad rats at uncanny caverns. A legendary radstag at the project paradise event.
---
Thx I didn't realize it was affected by demolition expert
---
Woah thats nice. I just sold mine for 30k caps so thats really good.
---
You can buy gold with caps
---
Perhaps just doubling the lower potential of the base would help alot of issues, or just have the visuals of the foundations extend to the floor.
---
Think of how the billboards work, how they have double the potential depth below their base sitting position so they never kook like their floating.
---
Nice, it’s zealot anyway so it’s reasonable I guess?
---
Well, there are quests where an NPC follows you and engages in fights, etc. Idk why this could not be just copypasted? The only thing they would have to add is not making NPC despawn when you teleport away.
---
How the hell do you do that?
---
Damn I'm on xbox, I'd help ya out if I could. But just dont give up on it man I didnt get my first decent explosive gun until I was level 150 from the purveyor. Also make friends with some good people too, networking is a huge boost in this game.
---
I gotta admit, I read your post that you made on another thread about this.... and I had to copy you. So now I have the toilet paper set for 2020 caps. Please don't sue for stealing trade secrets.....
---
"Hey Rocksy, who is it today?"
---
"No one, Kid."
---
"What? How? You haven't had a single bounty in the past two weeks... what's going on?"
---
"People are too scared to leave The Crater... it's become an ill omen."
---
"What?"
---
"Talk about getting... 76'd."
---
"Oh...
---
...HEY WREN! Need anymore damn tubes?"
---
Yeah mine was vampire explosive
---
Holidays?
---
A whole lot of new players could use those legendaries my friend.
---
I dunno but I'd totally buy it if you're on PS4 ;P
---
haha no that awesome i snagged the idea from another player whose camp i visited lol. we're both thieves!
---
At least dont let our camp enclosures look all wet like the roof is leaking.
---
Right which is why I’m just having to drop them when I meet a low level player because there’s no point in selling them
---
Santa Scorched Event.
---
Thanks I'll try it
---
Fully agree that this community is great. My two most used guns were gifted to me by a very generous high level player when I was only about level 60 and it has made all the difference.
---
Still, I’m tired of rapidly running backwards at radiation rumble taking 5 to 6 shots to kill certain ghouls!
---
[delete] 
---
Oops sorry about that 😬 I read title but not description.
---
That guy turned himself into toilet paper! Funniest *shit* i have ever seen! Pun intended
---
Pick up soap to fight covid too. And always always wear a gas mask.
---
No, the NPC’s you’re referring to follow a programmed path which may be by the hundreds unless you are within the vicinity then they come at you that’s why it doesn’t crash the server constantly because the NPC’s aren’t really free to roam. This already puts a lot of stress on the servers adding full on companions that use their own pathing and movement while simultaneously following you would crash the servers for sure. Remember this is the same engine that Skyrim ran on and even then, a single player game, companions never really worked well
---
I only just realized today that the settlers don't have 2  daily quests.
---
The devs really seem to be biased against the settlers.
---
There were tons of them during the holiday event, but they're incredibly rare otherwise.
---
Ugh your disgusting
---
oh..rollbacks like for everyone? I will be pretty disappointed if this comes out true.
---
Nope
---
That's great!  I'll try that, thank you!
---
Define ‘know how to play’ hahaha
---
Yo man, went ahead and got this thing. Like it so far. Just need to get the right roll. Right now I’m running a quad with 50% limb damage and 15% faster crit. Might go for the prime receiver like you said. Just afraid I’ll run out of flux to make ammo. Also didn’t realize how damn heavy this thing was lol.
---
The ones down on the waterfront are still there...
---
Dude this is so disheartening. I finally was able to grind enough atoms to get a nice skin for my PA but got SUPER screwed.
---
Before doing a few of those photomode ones to get ez atoms, my points were sitting at 1160. After doing them it was 340 or 360. After logging out and back in trying to fix the issue it was back to 1160. Did I just lose all the atoms I earned and why would this just suddenly start happening?
---
I've only been playing a few weeks and bought the game on steam so I didn't do any weird character import from the Bethesda.net launcher. 
---
It really made my pp soft.
---
Thanks bethesda. That's pretty cool of you! Keep up the good work. Fallout 76 is turning into a brilliant game! I'm always excited for what's coming next...
---
As soon as they fix the healing bug with it
---
They should let us turn in extra bullets, crops or building materials for a bit more rep daily. 
---
Not enough to let anyone finish the grind in a day but enough to feel like your making progress.
---
Agreed, it is pretty hard to build a decent looking camp using the prefabs from the shop since they don't snap and require a lot of flat ground to look presentable. Whitesprings is great for building but I get horrible fps over there to the point of being unplayable even though I got a nice computer (10-15 fps, makes menus so bad).
---
People are crashing them on purpose.
---
Maybe ammo crates as stash boxes?
---
I give stuff away.  Yesterday was a 2 shot explosive 10mm machine gun I had been hoarding for months.  Dude was using a explosive pipe gun.   He was pumped.  Keep what you love.  Let spew bullets by others the one you don’t.
---
Yeah but it doesn't take very long to get 6k.
---
I doubt that jerk will be reading this thread.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Hey! Join us we nuke and event run a lot. Laid back discord https://discord.gg/EZ33zpp
---
I'll be running some nukes in a while, later tonight
---
Sorry my frustration disgusts you...
---
I killed a legendary chicken around a year ago it was under the overpass leading into flatwoods after the hotel, got a level 5 pipe pistol.
---
Occasionally collision course will spawn a legendary scorched
---
Thanks. Guy's a bully, he had a big bounty on his head, must have been killing people too.
---
I got an anti armor explosive 50 cal from a random legendary mutant today. You can get them anywhere, it's just RNG.
---
Ugh...we just can't have nice things :(  
---
I seriously like this game, for the most part, the game itself has worked fine for me. Just shite like this....makes me want to stab myself in the eyeball with a spork...
---
Haha seems like this poor wittle settler came across a real raider. It's a wasteland bro, everyone's not just giving each other hugs and flowers.
---
How much XP do you get from those encounters? I'm on the last leg for Foundation (really want that Gauss shotgun) and was thinking about farming them. Is it worth server hopping for?
---
Explosive causes more problems for me than it’s worth.  I go bloodied.   I have a 1* handmade and it shreds lol.
---
That would be an awesome thing to add. I’m surprised i haven’t seen this recommended before.
---
wait wait wait, sorry for you los, could you perhaps give more info about the crops for adhesive? it is new information for me and I hate to farm adhesive.
---
Purified water for 15 caps
---
Despite their so called smarts, trappers aren't that smart and tbh are a waste of time to me
---
I play on adventure mode and try to be kind to other players, take your shitty toxic attitude somewhere else.
---
I found a 3 star legendary radroach outside lucky hole a long time ago. First and only one I've ever seen.
---
If you’re going for max dps a faster fire rate rifle is better. But explosive ones do drop, so keep hunting and you’ll find one eventually :)
---
The lullabies that lull me to sleep have turned into  fastnacht music...
---
With some crops (don’t know which ones exactly) you can create vegetable starch and that scraps into adhesive
---
Tbh a low health instigating vats rifleman is meta already, it's only weekends is in boss fights like queen/colossus which is remedied with a substitute bloodied.
---
Well done! More forethought than me then!
---
Frustration is one thing. Calling someone’s mom a slut or a whore is the disgusting part. It says more about you than the game issues.
---
I’ve been playing all weekend so far and haven’t had the servers go down once. So it’s probably your end.
---
Tatos, corn, and mutfruit. 2 of each and purified water makes vegetable starch at a cooking station, which is worth 2 adhesive. So set them all up in multiples of two, go do something for a while, come back, harvest, make the adhesive, repeat.
---
Yeah fuck that mission... That was the sole reason I sided with the Settlers. The Chinese Stealth Suit was a nice bonus 😁
---
Must’ve been your lucky day.
---
I like the fact that they are badass! We shouldn't be able to kill everything in 2 seconds.
---
'Some people just want to watch the world burn'
---
If you are on PC, message me, I would be happy to give you supplies (ID: Eldyrus3)
---
one star bloodbug, two star wolves, one star mole rat
---
He’s been waiting to piss off Nikademus1969 for months.  This is his super bowl
---
Just know that the more people in the Silo run the more robots that appear. It's really easy if you solo it, assuming you have good Troubleshooter's gear.
---
This is gonna start trending lol. Absolutely hate having to flip exterior walls
---
They're 9 yrs olds with anger issues those which downvotes the devs, just ignore them
---
And the major gutsy that’s kill you so damn fast too
---
It's a bad look regardless when they only sell skins for certain PA models or just a whole new skin that is placed over the standard model. Scrabber basically redoing the entire armor, Red Rocket completely changing it, Commi armor, Hellfire, etc.
---
Best weapon i got was from a sbq that gave me a  BEA Combat Rifle and before that was a BSS Combat Knife with one of the mobs fighting the queen best day of my life never gonna trade my best drops
---
This is life in the Wastelands and part of the game.
---
You...you know I'm not being serious, right?   
---
And for what it's worth, I did no such thing.   
---
You must meltdown when people start with the yo mama jokes...
---
So true lol, I feel the exact same way! I have got to the point to were if I see a lower lvl, I will give away 1-2* weapons, armor, and meds. I have no room! 🤣
---
I do them on my private server to farm nuke ingredients and flux.
---
So give them ‘drugs’ and let them sell them for caps? :)
---
LoneVaultWanderer is just a YouTuber though?
---
What system do you play on?
---
I'm not, but thanks for the offer friend. I got off and went to work anyway.
---
They specified thats it's double dailies. So do your weeklies as scheduled
---
Robot companions would be f great, If just we could create them, modify etc. It would be nice to have assaultron as a companion
---
Xbox one, but I had to get off and go to work after I repaired stuff anyway.
---
Ward sucks, the raiders don’t
---
First you say your frustrated then you say your not serious. Then you claim you didn’t make a sexual slur about Tods mom.
---
Your lying. You have problems. Get some help,
---
Not at this establishment. We have cleaned all standing water.
---
Ahh I was gonna say I could throw some adhesive your way, I’m currently on now
---
Thought I saw someone else posting about this earlier today where it doesn't lock like the regular garage door.
---
I have a furious combat rifle and an anti armor and they do a good job most of the time outside events.
---
Hmm, I am playing a bow build atm and it seems pretty sick. I haven't seen anyone mention the proper technique for using the bow. As soon as you knock the arrow, you can hit vats and fire, there is no need for the full draw animation. Its a similar feel/timing to a quickscope in CoD. At lvl 50 I am 1shotting creatures that are over twice my lvl, and I don't even have a legendary/compound bow yet, just using an explosive bow. As for the fire rate... I will clear swathes of enemies before anyone else can tag them if I don't switch to a non-modded bow in groups. Yes its not an automatic weapon but literally something dies once a second. The range on 95% is insane, I have a fucking enormous perimeter and I and constantly firing instakills. I think either you have insanely high standards for what is viable or you weren't using your bow right.
---
Bold of you to assume I don't play the same way, I'm as helpful and friendly (especially to lower level playes) as any other good wasteland Samaritan. Just pointing out that this is in fact a fallout game, set in a post apocalypse, where everything isn't all pristine and covered with rainbows lol. you done got raided, it happens, no need to bitch and moan.
---
I have no idea what's clogging up my stash anymore. I've purged my aid section and sold all my drugs, my junk only takes up 200 lbs, I just cleared up my weapons and apparel today. It must be heavier ammo at this point I'm thinking.
---
I appreciate the offer :) I had enough scrap to repair turrets and then had to get off
---
Why not use a bloodied at all times? At the lowest health the DMG should still be nearly the same, if not slightly higher for the Instigating. And if you put in the effort to get a bloodied weapon, still why not just use it? 
---
The only scenario that would make sense is if you didnt have a good bloodied weapon yet. But then the instigating weapon is just a substitute until its replaced
---
Because ever since Preston made me help settlers and I decided to take my revenge with Nukatown I have always sided with them since. So thanks Preston for my hatred for settlers and love for raiders buddy. Haha
---
I know I can do it solo.. Just am bored of wandering alone is all. Its more fun for me when I'm playing with others.
---
I just checked today and they were gone, I’ll have to go back and check, maybe it was just a bug
---
You sound like the kind of person who blames a mugging victim for being mugged irl.
---
I should totally do this using Final Fantasy 6 Ultima music! Maybe after killing the queen, I can play the final fantasy victory music. Thanks for the idea!
---
Ummm....ok....I'm not serious about the "Todd's mom" thing...I'm sure she's a lovely woman.  
---
I AM serious about the frustration...I was looking forward to playing all day only to get booted off the server like 5 times in less than 30 minutes.   
---
I may have problems, and I could indeed possibly use some sort of professional help, but I am not a liar.
---
No
---
How can a player destroy your turrets? I thought you have to be flagged for pvp.
---
Elder Scrolls 6 and Star Field are gonna run like absolute garbage.
---
Dogs and pets? Sure.  
---
Human companions? No. The camp allies are pushing that enough as it is.
---
I wouldn t say shiny . More like a wet/gloss over shit. I noticed it after wastelanders
---
Yeah just came across a legendary scorched the other day.
---
Sure my gamer tag is getgamed34
---
Yess
---
Lmao did you just compare having your stuff broken in a digital game to a real life crime. Dang holmes. Lol what you said is totally irrelevant, I'm talking about a video game. Things that happen in the real world carry an incomparable amount of weight, of course the CRIMINAL (you know.. the guy who committed the crime) is to blame, not the victim.
---
You're kinda just making my point here
---
I’m not quite there yet, but I have two characters so should I just focus on maxing one reputation with each character? Will that be easier than trying to do both one character?
---
I bought the garage . Where is the roll up door
---
No thank you, the only thing worse than a Jackass is a flying Jackass.
---
just FYI, explosive means a lot more repair needed for the gun
---
On the bright side, can send support a message issuing a refund of atoms on broken purchases. Get to keep the thing for if they break it, but get it for free since it is broken on release.
---
Whilst it’s probably well known by now, I’ll just put this out there for those of you who are unaware:
---
-place two foundation pieces next to one another.
---
-place a door wall where they intersect. Place another door wall in the same spot, and you’ll find that you can flip it so that its interior face is on the reverse side of the first wall.
---
-Edit+Swap both walls into your desired wall type.
---
-Edit+wallpaper both sides.
---
I think Bethesda would have to invest in better servers for that dream to come true.
---
So I forgot I made this post in a fit of anger after dying. So basically I opened the vendor near the responder thing . Then this guy starts hitting me with an axe before I can even look at the items. I shot him, ran away, and the saw confused emotes before getting killed
---
It’s more economical to make ultracite rounds.  Do it.  Nice roll.
---
That’s fine I have a scrap box and all the perks to make it last and fix it 200%
---
2020, summed up in one reddit topic.
---
Literally just finished my second (queen x3) once in morning and once before bed and I logged off to read this lovely post. Your very welcome. Thanks for the appreciation. Just trying so spread some love :)
---
Let's hope not, haven't heard anything about starfield.
---
If you're bored enough to make a full Troubleshooter's set, you can bath in the warm red light worry free.
---
Transfer to an alt.
---
It doesn't really effect you unless you aren't able to kill it. They can come and die as much as they want as long as I still kill the queen.
---
I used to have my camp at that double resource (lead/junk) area in toxic valley and holy shit it was impossible to place a prefab on that spot, everything either floats or sink way too much, awful. I eventually moved my camp way down south near that big lake on the border of the map, now I can at least place the damn things, it's not pretty though, the lack of snapping is so stupid, you can't even attach a stair at those things. I love prefabs they are so light on building limit, but my god.
---
Dang, but thank you, I was curious of this too.
---
Every time I enter my camp I think of this.
---
I wish I could move the garage further away from the camera when I’m trying to move/place it. Thing takes up my entire screen
---
The tents are the worst. (Campfire Tales tent, etc.)
---
To look authentic, tents need to be placed on bare ground. Placing them on foundations just looks silly.  
---
But there's nowhere in the game where you can find a patch of ground flat enough where one corner of the tent isn't floating awkwardly above the ground.
---
Same, that issue has been happening alot lately for me. I'm on PS4
---
You got the rewards for the event because you participated and completed the event. However you didn’t do enough damage to the Queen. 
---
If you want to obtain loot from the queen, you need to do a minimum. 1,000 damage on the queen. 
---
This was updated a long time ago, because people would just show up to the event, shoot the Queen for a few seconds and then just stick around and wait for other people to kill her, so they can get the loot without putting in the work. 
---
So now you have to inflict at least 1,000 damage if you want to be able to loot her body.

old bugs resurrected, it used to have a visual of open when closed

There's a Gold, Silver. and Red Skin unlockable at Rank 76 of the current Season, and a Matte Black skin was datamined a few weeks ago (They're probably going to wait to release this one until after the Season is over, so it's not competing with the unlockable).
---
No lad, no I am not. It seems you fail to disassociate the real world, from a digital fantasy. The person who you're complaining about is playing a game, a game that in fact has mechanics in place to allow the player to steal. There are factions and characters in established lore of this game that even encourage this type of playing style. Things however, that happen in the real world, are governed not by ficticous tales and unrealistic game mechanics, but the social and lawful assumptions that come with being a REAL LIFE PERSON in a functioning society. The two scenarios you've constructed are not even held within the same realm of existence so your argument lacks any substance.
---
Yea I feel you on that, when and if I bother to do rad rumble I just tank damage, run past the enemies to get ore and let all the bloodied tse guys take care of enemies
---
Better idea add new perk card and crafting station to allow us to build any bot we could in Fallout 4’s Automatron and Eyebots. The new perk would let us craft bots depending on rank then the mods would need Science, Armorer, Home Defense or something combination of perks to apply.
---
I’ll take one jacked up boy over a dozen turrets
---
Keep digging that hole
---
This just started happening to me recently. Things like scorch beast, sheepsquatch and high level robots locate me right away. Super frustrating as I’m a stealth build.
---
seems more racist to me that people just think everything is some sort of racial attack
---
PA already goes through cores surprisingly quickly. I have 30 cores in my stash, which’ll probably last me 2 weeks. Keep in mind that you’re already sacrificing a lot of carry weight on your already low carry weight character due to each fusion core weighing 3 pounds.
---
If you need any junk or anything let me know I play on Xbox and am willing to give help to anyone who needs it GT Sk8npurplehippy
---
Maybe
---
**Okay, so here's what I have been told from support.** 
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
I have 300 Atoms that I have earned that have not been showing up. However it's odd because when I earn Atoms via a challenge the number of Atoms shown on the bottom right is entirely different than that of what I see when I enter the Atomic Store.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Apparently there's some confusion on "account types". I was told that they could see I was earning the Atoms properly on my Bethesda.net account... which is funny since I only have the game and play it via the Xbox App for PC on gamepass. I was told I would have to complete the challenges on the game launcher through the Xbox App. That's all I use.
---
So it seems like the accounts are getting their wires crossed. It's rewarding your Bethesda.net version of the game account, not your gamepass (and probably vice versa).
---
Yup.. a few times.  Not sure why this happens tho.
---
Price most of 'em at max caps?
---
Wolves are very common as legendary.  There is a whole event built around 3 of them (leader of the pack)
---
That's nice of you, but I think I'll just go scavving when I get home from work later :)
---
There's reasons for that and we can probably guess most of them.
---
Is there a link to this? Can’t for the life of me understand it in game.
---
I run 3-6 per day so thank you for the post! My biggest problem is acquiring key cards...they have gone up in price so much! 100 caps was the going price, now it’s 300+ or flux/junk which sucks
---
Sounds good 👍
---
Yup.

Let me remind you that these are probably the people that tell you not to kill the queen so fast
---
Whenever i think i found enough flat ground, i haven't
---
Take over the gorge junkyard for black titanium
---
Well played sir.
---
I would be happy with people actually concentrating  on mobs. Sucks when sbq lands,  I'm tanking her doing dmg... then have to stop to kill mobs cause they won't leave me alone.. lol
---
I just rolled a lvl 50 3* furious with explosive rounds
---
The joy I get from building my camp isn't from the accessibility of the camp system... It is exploiting the MANY glitches and COUNTLESS methods of breaking the system to achieve things like items on shelves or building under the terrain to place that ladder just right or making use of floating structures to make that tree house.
---
The BBC reports schools scrapped plans to ban this nursery rhyme. Upon review, they determined it was ultimately just about a sheep.
---
I just feel bad for the guy that launched the nuke when the timer runs out and the queen didn't even mutate lol
---
&gt; how is that event failed? Genuinely asking what causes a fail for that event?
---
Encryptid is a timed event (10 mins, I think?) If you don't kill it in that time, it teleports away and you fail it.
---
I bet they just double the typical values for Friday-Sunday’s rewards and call it a weekend
---
Heck yeah!
---
I've ran about 18 silos since double xp started. I wish the xp in the silos evened out the cost of doing so lol
---
Only to have it go nuts like a turret and start destroying your camp.  But you can’t kill it because it’s an ally.
---
Plus, I usually see 2-4 legendaries, and as a bonus, every 5000 candies is another free legendary.
---
Please stop injecting politics into games. People just want to focus on something that is unrelated to politics for a little bit.
---
(Yes, racism is a political issue and is commonly brought up by politicians, so it qualifies).
---
Almost all weapons I use are Bloodied Explosive and it was so easy being killed because of low health and collateral damage. Like when a mob is in your face and you have no choice but to shoot, but the explosion kills you too. Had to upgrade SS armor and perks to reduce explosive damage. Also, be prepare to constantly repair your weapons, even when you repaired to 200%.
---
Is that actually true? Whenever I was level 15 or so I would show up and do a couple hundred damage but get loot from them
---
Really? I didn’t know that about the candy. Is that 5000 collected or deposited. I walked out of there with nine once, only once. Was amazing
---
One of the best effects against 97% of the enemies in the game.
---
It does. I'm a Cowboy with a Jetpack...yee haw!
---
Any way you’d donate some gunpowder?
---
I dont think I've found any clothing that covers it up. Its always showing for me.
---
Well he is right to be fair, this is just a game with mechanics for pvp and raiding, ask to people playing ark or rust
---
&gt; Stop sitting on the shack and waiting for people to complete the event for you!
---
This has become such a huge problem recently (Encryptid, Campfire Tales, etc) that I'm starting to wish they'd just fucking nerf Marsupial. Or at least make it so you slide off rooftops that are near events so you can't just camp up there forever. Force everyone onto the ground where they have to participate.
---
❤
---
Thanks! 🙏
---
The subject matter, is a farmer asking a sheep if it has wool.  Anything "racist" would be interpreted by the listener.
---
my biggest confusion in this game as a newer player is how terribly designed the stash box is. It holds items based on weight, but also does not store junk in its broken down parts. How much space could you save if all the items that provided adhesive were stored as adhesive. This reminds me of the ESO mount training not being account wide as a way to sell training books on the store. I
---
I mean if they can kill the damn stingwings and radscorps, more power to em. Gives me more time to focus on the queen
---
Any good ways of getting screws? I have two and I need 60
---
Typewriters and desk fans if I remember correctly.
---
Also, tag the items for search to help you find them out in the world
---
I like fallout games but I used to think that this game was terrible. Bought it on Amazon one day for $10 because why not and I don't regret it. Yea this game is VERY buggy, and can have weird visuals at times but overall, I enjoy it. Wish they'd increase camp and stash limit though
---
It was really hard but I.. liked it. She was funny
---
Was that recently? Or a long time ago when you were a level 15. As in before the updates that fixed that.
---
It's what I've already heard and thought too, maybe it scales with someone's level.
---
Well its really not that hard to hit the damage threshold of 1k unless your a low level trying desperately to hit the damage mark
---
I'd rather see them put raw ore into the junk stash since we have to smelt it first anyway and as far as I know the only thing they're used for is turning into scrap.
---
Your bloodied Lever Action rifle should be able to one-shot those ghouls even without explosive damage. If not, you might have to take mutations and more perks. Or prime it since the rifle doesn't use much ammunition.
---
I have them tagged but I'm just out constantly
---
Is jetpack worth the expense if you have marsupial?
---
That event has been a one and done for me for as long as I've been playing. It'll work once for a character I make and never again, I've gone back on my older characters just to see if it works and still have empty containers.
---
Cool. I'm actually glad it's like this. I don't care for how the ss armor looks itself.
---
Nice lol.
---
Idk about paying 10 dollars to respec but I would like to be able to.
---
Deposited... I can't remember what the option on the terminal says, but there's one that opens up the high-end menu... the nuclear surprise (5000 candies) is a random legendary
---
Is the scavenger protectron worth buying to help with that?
---
Holy crap, I swear I’ve done that event 200 times and never really read that terminal man
---
Absolutely!!! Got enough spare junk off him to completely rebuild my camp!
---
The mole miners drop lots of useful stuff you can scrap! Their weapons can be used, or scrapped, and the gauntlets yield black titanium when scrapped. Also, they have suit filters, suit scrap, and breathers, among other stuff, that can broken down into useful scrap. 
---
As for the Assaultron...I’m not what level you are, but at level 30 there is a fantastic perk called Enforcer. If you get all three ranks, every shotgun pellet that hits a body part has a 30% chance of crippling a body part, and there’s a 15% stagger chance. As long as you can avoid the head laser, that should make fairly short work of any Assaultron, depending on if you have other shotgun perks. 
---
Oh, and be on the lookout for desk fans and globes.
---
I heard you have to deal 1% dmg done to get the reward :D
---
If the timer runs out and she doesn't mutate, the problem isn't the low levels focusing on the mobs that spawn.
---
Bro, just go to white spring and buy a ton of crap, that's what I do. I actually got a lvl 40 auto grenade launcher at half duarability for only 346 caps at the black powder shop. I'm only level 27 at the moment but it was a great buy. And I've already repaired it to full wso it's even better!
---
When I think I see empty lunch bags on the ground at random times.
---
Going to report this to the team now. Thanks for letting us know mate.
---
That could be too.

 &gt; Going to report this to the team now. Thanks for letting us know mate.
---
So far its looked really nice with the backpack I've tried too. No weird clipping or anything.
---
2 weeks ago
---
Unarmed is the best for a number of reasons.
---
It's much more perk-efficient. It only takes 3 perk point versus the 9 of the other two. Also, if you have Twisted Muscles and Talons mutations, they both stack together to give a massive 50% damage increase, (and these two only stack for unarmed damage, not for other melee damage). Make that a 70% damage increase if you're on a mutated team with Strange in Numbers.
---
What I heard they are supposed to change the respec system. Additionally, imagine spending levels on respect while leveling legendary perks cost cards.
---
IMO, what they may do in future is card-loader monetization. EX - you get 4 save slots to save your car builds, but for XXX atoms you can get more.
---
Only one I’ve ever encountered was purely a trap.  It was incapable of killing me but the damage I was subjected to was enough to prevent fast travel.
---
Really annoying as I’d already spent 10 server hops trying to get my camp to spawn.
---
I get the feeling that camp building was not taken into consideration when the map was built. The terrain *everywhere* has so many hills, permanent trees, rocks, etc. etc. There are few locations where you can utilize the entire camp circle unimpeded by the terrain.
---
Thank you :)
---
Didn't think about that. I only need 1k gold more and I'll have it.
---
I think some people are either too lazy to change or just don’t have a better single card to share.  Multiple of same perk aren’t useful.
---
Could it be that gauss is energy-explosive weapon and enemies may be more resistant to these types of damage?
---
The abandon bog town workshop has a secret 3rd level (not roof) floor that has alot of globes,fans,and typewrittens for screws. Head all the way to the roof, of the biggest building and look for a elevator access shaft. It will drop you right to that floor you need to be.
---
Whilst at a vendor some guy started shooting me with a explosive handmade and blew himself up, he was nice enough to leave me his loot.
---
 I don't think it's "pay to win", but I'm not supporting any solution to the re-spec annoyance that players have to pay for.
---
I have all the rifle perks. What other perks do I need? I have not really looked into serums though. Truth be told, haven’t really used the bloodied lever rifle I do not really run a bloody build but I guess I should try it next time in radiation rumble .
---
I had a camp that was right by a mothman shrine and 3 cultists. Sometimes one would be legendary...was always a nice lil surprise.
---
Repaired cores? You mean fusion cores? I have all the perk cards to make my fusion cards last super long in my power armor.   I take over the workshop in the nuclear power plant in the east and power up that machine that makes cores and putz around until I have about 13 and that'll last me a good month.
---
I figured this much with the sbq, but didn't think would effect other mobs.  Just crazy that a weapon that states it does almost 3x-4x more dmg then my pump, and doesn't do nearly as much dmg. Guess I'll be on the hunt n try to get medic combat shotgun with bashing n see how that does, or a quad combat shotgun with bashing...
---
I always do atom challe ges and get my atoms
---
I switched from 1-handed to unarmed, early on.
---
I was initially going with a knife build, because I like the way combat knives feel and how fast they hit. But then I got a random fss meat hook at around level 25 or so; I was initially just going to scrip it, but for shits and giggles I decided to give it a try in combat.  
---
The difference was jaw-dropping.
---
I changed my build from that moment to unarmed.
---
Are you charging the gauss?
---
*considers how this might look during the average SBQ.*
---
Uh, *no.* Sadly not.
---
To be fair, I have done plenty of damage to the queen during the events, and twice now, I have gone to loot, SEEN the loot, and watched it blip away as someone else loots it.  I am left with an empty corpse and no loot to show for it.
---
I mean, I’d love to create a robot a la Automatron that patrols my camp, but not an actual companion. It’s just too messy.
---
Most of the time yea... cause that's the only way I'm able to use stims or switch weapons.  It tends to lock up alot if i don't,  preventing me from doing anything.
---
True , but considering some prices i see when i visit camps sometimes i understand that alot struggle , Stimpacks 50caps, Radaway 50caps , 3* scrip items 5k-10k. 
---
I know people can price as they want and i dont need anything atm (4 mules stacked with food , ammo &amp; chems since i played from beta)
---
But prices are a reason people actually struggle with caps
---
Buy the Raider ammo machine - make 5.56 if you dont use it. It sells all the time at 1c each
---
She's got a tad over 32k health. You definitely need to do more than 1%. I keep hearing 1000 a lot. I used to hear 2000. 
---
Just go beserk on her head when she's down and hope for the best.
---
Half the time I do it this is the case.
---
Wait the scorchbeast queen is a shared loot box? I thought that legendaries killed in groups everyone got a unique loot box
---
Dunno why on earth such a civil, well structured and composed rebuttal was downvoted. Take my upvote, you jolly fellow.
---
It works exactly as you'd expect. If they're even 1 hitpoint off their max heath, it doesn't work.
---
Don't use it with the Plague Walker mutation. That has a very low and constant damage output to everything around you, and will ruin the instigating effect for you.
---
I'm a level 70ish and had a level 350+ kill me 3 times for my Crafton workshop.
---
100% agree with this. Some of those skins said they are for all power armor yet aren't able to be applied to the t-65. They need to fix this.
---
This is a launch bug. Good luck
---
Welcome to fo76
---
Even on the excavator armor with calibrated shocks the carry capacity is kinda low.
---
What an asshole :/ sorry about them
---
How did someone destroy your turrets? did you initiate pvp with them? or not have passive settings enabled?
---
No , too much broken shit they need to fix before that
---
If they fixed this one tiny bug, then they would at least be fair. Though gutsys would become the king robots of terror, though they frankly are already.
---
And maybe also fix the bug where the weapon, in your hands, fails to do damage at max charge.
---
I can share my experience. I max rep firstly with settlers bcz I helped them in the questline and shared gold with them. 
---
By reaching the max rep with settlers u got a gauss shotgun which is great (the best shotgun of the game and u need only lead&amp;steell to craft ammo) but it has some issues/bugs. the fertilizer grenades are great as well if u go as herbivore. 
---
By reaching the max rep with rader u have Ammo crafting machine and gauss minigun that is OP. It is the best weapon I have so far. 
---
So if u go as a heavy build (12+ strenght) u may want to reach the max rep with both factions bcz u will get two amazing weapon and a provider of ammo that doesnt provide u with 2mm but still it will be usefull for other weapons.
---
In order to farm rep with raiders u can do random encounters. There are two daily quests in Ohio River Adventure. One is bugged and repeatable (u just need to activate it manualy after log out/log in procedure). Another one requires u to supply mireluk stuff daily. Just for me the daily for settlers was bugged in a bad day for me bcz I got VERY F*CKING little progress every time i completed the quest.
---
Omg sorry I recently scrapped it cuz I saw no use in having an extra, I would have given you it. You have ps4? If I run into one again, I will keep my eyes out for it, and give you it. I saw one in Watoga shopping center a few days ago as well.
---
No, it's not a shared loot box, which was why I was so confused.  But sure enough, I saw loot, and watched it get taken away.  Only happened twice, and I have seen no way to replicate it.
---
Are you doing stealth build,  bloodied?
---
I'm a stealth rifleman build.
---
I use instigating rifles,  and instigating explosive for some.
---
You can add sneak for extra damage if crouched.
---
Bloody mess also give some extra damage.
---
I can one shot most everything.
---
I use an explosive instigating combat shotgun at rad rumble and can one shot em most of the time.
---
Even if it was double damage to enemies above 90% health it would be great foe public events.
---
Talking out of your ass doesn't make you smart, the behavior is supposed to be identical to FO4 where they do visibly charge it every time they fire, and cannot repeat shots.
---
They can appear in almost any Vendors inventory, but the plans are definitely sold in the responder bots inventory at Grafton in the responder building, and probably down at camden park.
---
Pull my finger, *kid*
---
Vendor at Camden park has all excavator plans.
---
I think i can solo her as well. do u use penta-barrel? what other stat u have on this weapon?
---
no
---
Join a match,  then go do something else for a bit.
---
After a bit check in,  either your still alive or your dead.
---
Then join a new match or wait a bit until your dead.
---
Basically hiding in a bush gets you better xp than killing.
---
Making it to top 10 is big xp
---
Mutations? Do you mean legendary run? Or the raider one?
---
The refractor perk should give ER and a chance to reflect %energy damage back at the enemy. I propose.
---
1star 10ER 10%chance refect 50%damage
---
2star 20ER 20%chance refect 50%damage
---
3star 30ER 30%chance refect 50%damage
---
4star 40ER 40%chance refect 50%damage
---
I meant munitions
---
I can place tiem cor ps4 players. Can also place the cage
---
Not trying to be a smart *ss, but i live in West Virginia... they got the terrain right.  Towns, cities, whatever, are never built on flat terrain.  Hell, Morgantown has a shopping area that extends over a mile, but just because of the terrain, there is only one way in/out.  I was just on a long weekend away in Flatwoods... roads wth no shoulders and you are looking at the toys of trees that are 30' high. 
---
From a gaming perspective, i understand, and share, in your frustration.  I have stored buildings from moving my C.A.M.P. that i can't place back down.  Even blueprinted ones.
---
How is that even placed? Does it generate ammo?
---
Somehow, I think I would be ok with Sarah Lyons telling dad jokes...
---
Odd. I completed some recently, and got the 80 atoms from it. The only thing that didn’t show up was the notification, unless I’m blind and the numbers went up from something else (I don’t have first, before someone asks).
---
I would gladly pay for one of these doors for my bedroom, or exchange building items in your camp.
---
I seriously doubt that this possible on this engine in these servers.
---
Congratulations!
---
If on PS4 I could sell u calibterd Ultracite shocks plan
---
Yeah, gonna stop doing it if you assholes with your hacked gear keep screwing over everyone on the server.  Im bloodied and I get my loot because i'm able to frontload enough damage to count but the 20 other people on the server I dropped the nuke for get hosed.  Can't you stupid motherfuckers wait until it at least mutates before you haul off and three shot it?
---
Wait, does Enforcer also work with the splash damage on explosive shotguns? So you can just carpet-bomb the ground and you don't have to get a direct hit on their legs?
---
Honestly, if they did this, I’d like different benefits from each companion. The commander could increase resource generation rate of an extractors/collectrons/fertilizer production you have, Beckett could give you 50 caps once a day (as rent), the wanderer could slow your water/food drain if you play an instrument with her, the punk could give a random bonus damage against a specific cryptid once a day and the forager could give you random (but rare) junk, or perhaps a random buff to a stat due to survival tips.
---
Well, tell your kid I think those names are super cool and I wish I could name my weapons that great.
---
I started playing now too, after it became available on Gamepass... Some glitches, but nothing that bothers me too much. I wanted to be able to reach the Score lv 100 in this season, but I don't think I will be able to. I already realized that it is an endgame content or at least it requires a lot of dedication, which at the moment I cannot give. Well, that's it, I know I still have a lot to see in the game, but from what I've seen so far, it's really cool and I even wanted to go back to playing the previous ones too...
---
1. Get a Scrap Assaultron Head by killing an Assaultron.  
---
2. Equip level 3 Super Duper perk.  
---
3. At an Armor bench, craft an Assaultron Helmet.  
---
4. If Super Duper does NOT proc, scrap your newly created helmet to get the Scrap Assaultron Head back, then craft another helmet until Super Duper DOES proc.  
---
5. If the perk procs, you now have TWO helmets. Scrap them both. Now you have TWO Assaultron heads.  
---
6. Keep doing this until you have as many Assaultron heads as you need screws.  
---
7. Scrap the Assaultron heads (but keep one Assaultron helmet for future use) to get screws, silver, and circuitry.
---
Presto! Now you know how to craft screws for one steel scrap each. Craft responsibly.
---
Under "walls"
---
There should be more creature camp items. Fish tank, terrarium with bugs, whatever.
---
I like certain camp objects requiring you to fetch unique things, like the frog jar.
---
Cool, thanks..
---
While PA definitely needs some improvements, I’d really prefer to keep the randomness of legendary effects out of it. Instead, they could give each set a set bonus like excavator’s bonus carry weight and ore harvesting and strangler’s bonus damage (though it would actually need to be effective, unlike strangler - the radial damage currently isn’t working and the damage from attacks is almost unnoticeable on anything stronger than a level 6 scorched).
---
Would definitely follow their tour of Appalachia, maybe as a live event
---
If it had released like this there wouldn’t have been half as much backlash. It’s worth it now
---
&gt; there are surprisingly few good spots to build one
---
I hate how the process for me always goes
---
"Oh hey, there looks like a good place to put my CAMP"
---
"You cannot place your CAMP near existing locations"
---
"Well ok I guess I'll just back up then"
---
And then it finally turns green after the place I wanted to build at is just a speck in the distance. Seriously the existing location thing kills so many ideas
---
Great work, everyone
---
I agree, like they should keep frog jars, then allow you to upgrade it when you collect enough. Because I dont like how we as a character just shove a lanky ass frog into a jar. Have you seen the size of their forearms! Fucking slender man fucked a rad toad and here ya go
---
They said it would only be for daily challenges
---
I've had some bad experiences with ppl jumping the gun on Encryptid, but fortunately those people also tend to act as assaultron bait so I can blast her, assuming some saint is tanking the pylons already. 
---
Lately I've had more of an issue with people camping the spawns at rad rumble, and not letting anyone else get tags on anything, legendaries included. Just because you are level 450 and have a BE Gatling plasma doesn't mean you need to kill every single thing that moves.
---
My favourite is when you *finally* hit that sweet spot after twisting, manipulating, patience and slowly moving it to position to see it actually turn green. Hit the button with relief to be told "Object is floating". Or "Item interferes with another object". And in one case,had the entire rail car really "float" by snapping into position by jumping about 6ft above my head. Why,why, did you turn green in the first place if it couldn't be done.
---
there will be a green camo skin at some point
---
This made me laugh too damn hard. Thanks for that!
---
It's a combination of using bloodied weapons with mutations and unyielding armors to push up your damage numbers. For mutations, I use a lot, but the ones affecting damage are Adrenal Reaction and Eagle Eyes. For Perks, I use Concentrated Fire, Strange In Numbers, Class Freaks, Bloody Mess, Grim Reapers, Gun Fu, and Adrenaline (not working rn). I use VATS mostly targeting head shots.
---
It's just because the magical effect really thats boosting the damage on your medic's pump shotgun. Gauss shotguns this patch have been real finicky and before they were great since you didn't have to charge it in VATS since it was already charged.
---
And two shot has always been shit so just scrip it since you can't sell crafted legendaries.
---
Edit: medic's is also a bugged "magic" effect but I think Angry Turtle said you only need the one effect. Having two or more doesn't make any better
---
Coffee by itself can justify nearly anything. It adds up so quickly. I hear so many people on my campus complaining about needing money but then also buy a giant coffee 2-4 times a day. I never got into drinking it and I'm glad I didn't, I just buy a game I'm interested in every once in a while and other than that just saving up for whatever is needed
---
(high level dies in SBQ fight)...
---
(screen goes dark)... 
---
(wakes up in skyrim wagon)
---
I don't know about P2W, but designing an unintuitive, clunky character progression system and then offering players an option to make it less of a pain in the ass by paying money would be fucked up.
---
Woah! Lots to take in here. Thank you for the thorough response. Definitely going to keep this in mind. I don’t use a heavy build, so they weapon may not matter to me too much for getting it *and* the shotgun on the same character.
---
That's funny I rarely ever play as well, I'm a lvl 7 in NW. I won my first match today with a group. I'm on PS4! 👌👍🏻 It has great potential and could be a really great add on for Fallout!
---
Garbage door
---
I would not listen to that other person. Anyone who goes through the main story gets the plans to craft the X-01 armor for free. So basically everyone has it, or at the very least, the ability to craft it themselves. 
---
Add to that the fact that you can very easily buy the mods you want from the bunker and its pretty much worthless
---
Your gonna have more cancer than Deadpool if you sleep that close to the fusion generator.
---
It be awesome if we could set our base up for pvp (optional ops in ) and make base builder like a 3D fallout theme clash of clans style game mode similar to nuclear winter
---
That's fair, I guess I just never considered to be "bad". It has some oddities but overall, but you're right, even if I didn't really care before hand
---
Neon letters are found at the train station vendors but are quite random spawning. Found mine at Morgantown Station but could be at any of them if I’m not mistaken. Beware this set costs 12000 caps and around 9800 with Hard Bargain perk card.
---
Eagle eyes, marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction, (i use carnivore too) and i have been contemplating bird bones
---
I don’t have the caps but I’ll save up and probably put some to the side if that’s possible
---
Corpses that are already part of the environment count (like the dead brotherhood of steel soldiers) enemies that you kill do not count. And one item is enough.
---
You doing right by your family so don’t ever feel bad for spending your hard earn money. 
---
I am the same but I budget myself $40 a month and I go months without spending
---
Were you on a team? If someone from your team does enough damage you get loot
---
Saw one for the first time in months yesterday at Scorched Earth. Wild stuff.
---
Maybe a Blood Bug Farm (like an Ant farm with dirt, etc.) but are miniature.
---
Share exp not needed but the share quest progression is 
---
I played wastelander with my friend and had to do every mission twice..
---
The only thing that scales is the amount of mobs that are present, as it is for any event where more players will bring more enemies. Her health and her damage reduction are static and do not change.
---
Mmmmm save me some crayons pls
---
I had actually bought a copy of Fallout 4 Game of the Year edition, quite a while back, because it was on sale for like half price.  It came with a bunch of DLC content, but I have never played it, yet.  I have been playing FO76 since January, so I have finished all of the story lines, I have all of the Xbox Achievements, and all of that.  I have been considering seeing what FO4 is like.  If you think it is a good game, then I may load it up and give it a try, soon.  :)
---
Explosive effect does more wear and tear on weapons. Probably one of the few touches of realism in the game. I have a mutant’s harpoon gun that shoots explosive flechettes and it needs constant repair. Fully ranking up Weapons Artisan can help a lot.
---
I mean, Fallout 4 had companions, so there's nothing stopping Bethesda from porting the functionality to 76 and breaking a million different things in the process. This game has so much tech debt, trying to add companions would probably melt the servers or add a million new duping bugs.
---
Ok, thanks for info.  Yea I only have the effects on the pump n gauss.  So in perspective , I thought since the gauss has the same magic effect as my pump,  but does more dmg on paper... it would do better then the pump. But to my surprise I was wrong.  I know medic n bash are both considered magical.  But I've only gotten these medic versions with bash. Lol.  I do like the medic effect as I crit very often.
---
Good luck trying to save them for the weekend.. you unlock most of them in 2-3 days by just playing
---
Would be nice if they fixed vats for pvp too. Doubt they will do that though. Seems like they dont care about the pvp side of the game.
---
A:What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen vertibird? 
---
B: What do you mean? An enclave or brotherhood vertibird?
---
A: huh.. I don't know. AGHHHH! *EXPLODES*
---
B: *loots corpse and jaunts merrily away*
---
what was your strategy for foundation? that’s the only achievement i need
---
Zero... they give you the X-01 as a Quest reward
---
Single barrel, Primed, Bloodied FFR +1 Perception.
---
You’ll need about 10 violet flux to craft;them
---
Ive alos found them as self contained mod.  rare, but does exist
---
The red rocket skin works for it
---
Yes, flux should weigh less, nice perk for 1sr.
---
Thanks man, very much appreciated
---
Make them prefab, but have them be in sections. A front, a middle and a back, that way you can make a short bus or a long bus.
---
Yeah something like that would be dope on a shelf or on a table. And I was thinking a little aviary
---
You need Ammosmith level 2.  You’ll make 180 instead of 100
---
I mean I’m just curious as to how the raid was, not saying they should ignore new content. It would just require less effort to reopen the Vault Raid while we wait for the new content they have in store. Don’t have to be so pessimistic about it.
---
And bugs. 
---
The dead dragon falling from the sky upon fast travelling still exists.
---
You have to spend the extra points you have first. Each point corresponds to the perk's required level
---
700, HA! I got over 1000 of the stuff at any given time! SO... uh.. hmm.
---
That would be it then
---
Ahhhhhh. That makes sense. Thx.
---
Honestly thought it was a feature, until I somehow get lasered whilst behind a wall on the opposite side of the aim... Those things use up 10of my super stims, if not more...
---
You can't choose a specific perk until level 50. So until then you just have to hope it drops after your next 5 level-ups. It doesn't mean that you get it at L35, just that you cannot get it before.
---
You just don’t dig Rae Dunn coffee mugs 😂
---
Not impossible but I wouldn't worry about it. Anyone who got banned for "just having one B2525 Fixer" is either lieing or tripped the automatic system in some other way. Otherwise *a lot* more people would've been banned.
---
Anyone telling you to stay completely away from legacies is only fear mongering for fun.
---
I’ll like this idea too like gear set in mmorpg
---
Just the luck of the draw, man.  I went to the purveyor the other day and after a few tries got a 3 star explosive handmade.  All I can say is good luck.
---
Alrighty thank you
---
When you ban thousands of players for simply finding holes in your game, this is what happens. I’m not saying I agree with it, but it’s kind of funny that the people playing are outsmarting the dumb fucks in charge. As usual, the rest of the player base gets to suffer though, which sucks. People who just want to play get stuck between a shitty developer and a mob of people finding every exploit imaginable.
---
Probably not. 44 is not really sought after.
---
I started a second character and would go to scorched earth at level 15, I definitely wouldn’t do enough damage but would still get loot. Also that’s how I leveled my alt up so fast, I’d try to tag all the mobs before the higher level players would kill them and I’d level up 2 to 3 times during one event
---
TSE aren't really that spectacular any more, they're solid legendary traits but they aren't over powered like they were way back. Still a good find though, I doubt its duped. A hot duped weapon are bloodied fixers, or legacy weapons like an explosive gatling plasma or flamer. Saw a dude with vendors full of bloodied 2525 fixers for 1k caps and it took alot of will power not to buy one knowing they were without a doubt duped.
---
Not true, just made a new character and had all my perks full and built by 64. You have to spend the points up to 50 for each perk. I.e. you have to spend 29 perk points before a level 30 perk (starched genes) is unlocked for you.
---
Then there’s always something left floating in the sky because you can’t scrap it because it “will make the rest inaccessible”
---
Where have you been finding vertibots (for the nuke cards)? I used to find them like all the time and since Patch 20 I've only seen 1.
---
Are you saving up points and not choosing perks? Cause that will delay it.
---
CONGRATULATIONS!  :)
---
“Accidentally”
---
Haha! I don't think anyone would bother duping a .44. Explosive can be an ok effect but two shot makes the second shot hopelessly inaccurate. I don't think I'd be able to sell one in my vendor for anything like that amount.
---
Ahhh. Thanks!
---
No you can use materials from junk.
---
Like how It used to be? I thought they changed it, my bad lol
---
if you did not skip/ look over the start of the game it tells you that you can craft and repair weapons and armor at the respective work benches
---
And please just join, most people don't show up cause nobody is there. If just one person shows up on the radar then somebody else is likely to show up followed by more 
---
Granted for Project Paradise, this theory hardly ever works... :(
---
But right now with the season going on, these events are good XP farms so most players are likely to show up
---
That makes sense now. Thanks.
---
Inspect the weapon at the bench, then read the bar at the bottom of the screen. There's an option to repair at Workbench.
---
You can repair with junk at an applicable workbenches (ie weapons at weapons bench).  Just switch to modify, select the weapon to repair, and then look across the bottom screen to see inspect/repair.  Select that and then look for workbench repair as an option.  If you have the necessary junk, it can be repaired.
---
No! You use workbenches to repair armor and weapons. You need to collect the right materials to repair what is broken.
---
They seemed more personable, less naive about the Appalachian Wasteland, and Mama Meg &gt; Paige.
---
No. Use the appropriate bench to repair it with junk.
---
Hahaha. Well at least you figured it out. Now it makes sense now that everyone has told me. I'm SMRT. Lol ;)
---
Yeah, every since Wastelanders dropped, the lighting is just totally messed up in this game.
---
I wish we could que up from the main game over world
---
The last three times over this weekend I saw the same. I just assumed that I was doing it too often?
---
Did you just assume its species ?!?!
---
Yesterday for me! Congrats! Pain is over for now...
---
Very true.
---
Thanks guys so much. I feel like an idiot for overlooking that
---
They said in the AMA that the Vaults would be part of a new Dungeon system, and the roadmap has the Dungeons scheduled for this winter, so they'll come, not soon but they will.
---
Winter’s soon enough for me!! That’s exciting news honestly
---
Why doesn't someone make an Indiana Jones house with lots of traps but also a treasure
---
https://youtu.be/4ObvC5bS5zs.      Go to about 11.45 and u should be good
---
I crap myself when i hear the voice
---
I think one of the vendor bots in Whitespring has the plans for sale - about 5k. Other than that they sometime appear in railstation vendors or loose in the world.
---
I have an unyielding scout armor set on me now. it is not the best set I can tell but whatever works for this weekend to boost my int. To get this one I spent 800 hours eventually killing legendaries around appalachia. so i could imagine what would cost me craft good ss unyelding set. So as I can test it myself this weekend i can tell that PA is WAY better. 
---
As for weight problem I have no problem at all. I use perks to reduce weight of chems and food equaly and i have "better with salt" to buff myself constantly with food and dont be worry about spoiling. I have friends who actually use this ss set and my x01 is way more tanky. So u maybe u are right in some way that uniyelding is better but some players as myself need to invest their life in grinding if we want get one.
---
Vats, aim the thruster, one shot kill.
---
They are heavy. Sell them or give them to someone who will run the solo with or for you :)
---
I'm going to guess you have some kind of open porch, or at least foundations with no walls? Take those out and put your walls around the structure you want, then add the blank foundations back. If you try and place a wall on the ground in between two foundation pieces it can snap inside or out and it is a little tricky to work with. As for the door even if the wall is inside out you can just store the door then put it back on with the handle on the other side of where it is now and it'll open properly.
---
Black sheep actually exist. Are they racist?
---
There are a couple of timers for this event. One is for discovering the Strangler Heart and the other (once discovered) is for completing the event. It is possible to complete the event without discovering the Heart, but the event will end if the discover timer runs out. The discover timer starts when the event pops up on the map, not when you get there.
---
Oh damn
---
If you don't feel like spending the caps/ are lower level I'll craft it for you at at less ungodly hour lol
---
You aren't the first, and I bet someone reads this post and learns about repairing at a workbench.
---
If you use PA, get the emergency protocols mod. Halves damage taken while at or below 20 percent health, which is conveniently the threshold for nerd rage to activate. If you finish the wayward quest line you can get a bloodied swing speed super sledge that will be more than enough to handle anything in the game. You can buy all the excavator mods at Camden park and out calibrated shocks and emergency protocols on it and use that sledgehammer to become the ultimate farming machine, one shotting mobs left and right
---
She's not even a travis
---
You sure they got it as a drop from the queen? It's been circulating the game for well over a year now, cheaters got it a long time ago and dupers did the rest
---
Except that it's still totally possible to kill people who have pacifist enabled, with the "right" build. It's happened to me. The teammate PVP I did notice. Honestly, PVP in this game just feels way out of balance and honestly unnecessary out in the open. Give it an arena to shine, rather than making it the default possibility in the wild. There are way too many people who refuse to engage in PVP for others to still be killing them for sport. 
---
Also, I wasn't aware you've been playing since the Beta as I don't know you.
---
Really I didnt know that
---
Yeah it’s a glitch generates any ammo you want
---
Putting walls between two existing floors is supper fiddly. I'd suggest removing your "porch", placing the walls, then replacing the removed floors since walls snap much more easily and consistently to outside edges.
---
Also, doors open depending on the door itself. If you hold the rotate buttons (LMB/RMB) you can see the hinges and handle flip position. I can never remember which direction opens which way, but if the door hits you in the face you can just turn it around without messing with the wall.
---
Yeah, dude is talking out of his ass...the T-65 is exclusively Fallout 76, its never appeared anywhere else, he definitely is confusing the hardened variant of T-51b for T-65
---
All my weapons are instigating and I'm a full health build. I melt everything now but the queen. I'm not hitting for 20k but why would I need to?
---
I don't think the studio could handle it. They have their hands full with fixing current bugs and preparing already scheduled content. They would have to go back and change the underlying code in the vault to bring it up to current standards. And let's not forget the reason they were removed in the first place. They generally sucked.
---
Was going to make a sick scrap town with friends at the river gorge bridge when I saw it in the trailer. We get there, realize not only can we not build there, we can’t build near any pre existing shit, only in the open, and on top of that, we can’t put our camps within a miles radius of eachother
---
It’s on purpose, enjoy being griefed by the alt accounts of banned players. Played most of the night in a private because the public servers were so shitty.
---
does it actually do damage at range though? I tried this with a combat shotgun and it's only doing 1 damage per pellet.
---
[Where to farm: All the things](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic#h.p14wcsgx9tkk)
---
Super helpful
---
Yeah they aren't exactly the most highly sought after weapons still good purchase but no really doubt someone duped it.
---
Can someone please explain how I can get max reputation with both factions? I want to get all the stuff from raiders and settlers but once I do vault 79 it won’t let me so someone please explain
---
I drink and smoke and still spend mass money on this game...see you in hell!
---
This is the fix for the adventure mode nukes too, I haven't seen this problem since I started using this method and that's 100s of silo runs ago.
---
I don't think game have online passes anymore
---
I scrapped it ages ago, but it was on my alt. I set it up so the vending machines were outside, but to get to me when I was AFKing you had to use an instrument, which immediately dropped you down a two story tall shaft of spike traps, 1/2 floor sized, instantly killing you. If that somehow didn't do the trick (it always did), I had some flamer traps at the bottom which were triggered manually or by the button.
---
I built it in response to this one time I found players trying to kill my AFK character with rads. I always let people retrieve their scrap after.
---
Also made a suicide booth that was triggered when you sat in an electric chair, but it was all very intentionally obvious. I scrapped that too.
---
There's a trick you can do. Place doorways facing each other, then convert them to regular walls. You can put wallpaper on the inside of both so it looks like an interior wall. They all snap neatly together and you don't have to do any fiddly faffing about.
---
It seems that most scorched are set to never be legendary. Definitely the ones that are spawned by scorchbeasts can not be legendary. The random spawns can be, but they are obnoxiously rare. I learned a long time ago that in a random spawn location like harper's ferry, you may as well just move on or server hop if scorched spawned in because it's not worth your time
---
I role play as a raider. I hunt people at workshops. Be happy I do not share my designs with other people and I do it rarely to amuse myself. I build and design trap bases in Rust. I also hunt your enemies the grifers that bother you so its a double edged sword.
---
Maybe don’t be a drug addict
---
restart pc?
---
when i played fallout 4 i got genuinely terrified, considering i have 1 and a half years of 76... i shredded that mr handy knockoff with a hunting rifle...
---
Raider rep is easy with the glitch can get a full rank in about 40 min. Better then weeks lol
---
Got bos knight paint a few days ago.
---
Honestly it’s a way to drag out content.(not saying I like it)
---
Yeah I was shock with nothing new from friendly to neighborly as well.
---
worth a try
---
They were duped heavily when tse weapons were duped some year back
---
Some random dude dropped me 11 of them back then
---
10, 15, 35...I drop the last zero. I mean they’re friggin camp plans... it’s not like it’s a BoS paint or anything
---
I worked during covid so it was since wastelanders came out. Missed a few days and it wasn't as enjoyable as it should be. However, worth it, love the gun. Now just grinding for the mods.
---
I just bought it at whitespring shopping area the vendor in the first room to the left sells it (there are 2 in there) he has a “responders”  under him
---
Sells for 5k-7k
---
I should of clarified... This is on xbox console. That's what the person had said and I updated my profile pic with the pic dude had posted on fb. 
---
Said to have been something players that got into the dev room had found and possibly gotten but I believe xbox players have not gotten into the dev room.. but some people say that they have gotten into the dev room and acquired a few items so it's a debate. 
---
Are you telling me this was mass duped on PC? Because this is something xbox players have never seen or even heard about until now
---
The armor really doesn’t boost the damage tbh, he may not have need rage def needs adrenal reaction mutation
---
No, seriously I dropped the remote and scrambled to get it and pressed the A button one to many times
---
Time. Just be patient. Their automated responses are a confirmation of the ticket, you get a more detailed response once they're able to actually get to it. Even in a relatively normal time it was taking me around a week to get a response, right now there are hundreds or even thousands of tickets from cheaters playing dumb clogging up their support system. May very well take a few weeks to get a response, and bothering them repeatedly over it won't speed anything up
---
Nice, hoping to get that from the grind eventually. So far my rolls haven't been the best.
---
Yea it because they only added 2-3 quest, they should have added 10-15 quest in total for both factions and rise the rep grind to balance it out so it wouldn’t feel as mind numbingly
---
Damage is capped in pvp, doesn’t matter how hard you hit anything else. Those explosive lasers don’t do anything (with the exception of the broken JE) if the person you’re shooting is set up right. You can still vats with the explosive lasers though, so use that to your advantage. If you want to run off the average dogshit pvper, get a railway with ffr, make it automatic, and unload on them. They still work in vats, and something like a bffr or QFFR is hard to tank. Tap them back to initiate, vats lock, and send them to the moon.
---
Just did the same yesterday.  Congratulations
---
Im on ps4 and would greatly appreciate if youd place them :)
---
Holy shit people are getting  Sensitive in this game , its game mechanics - wonder how players that cry now would have survived back when you could trash everyones camps lol
---
No i dont do that cause i hate other players (no offence) so i stay away as much as possible
---
Yeah don't quote me but I was reading some people talk about it so may or may not be true
---
Because it be more fun
---
They could add cement blocks underneath or wood (like the porches) that can sink into ground.
---
It does a max of 110 damage, like every other gun.
---
same issue here .
---
Found out about Fallout 76 on PC last friday and started downloading
---
First of all every character i create, i give a name okay, but on social my actual name is like d2b43534ca567cbde543 , was weird at first since everyone else i found in game had a normal name , but okay eventualy i saw more ppl with names like that.
---
And then is the Atom shop thing, exactly as you described it only thing i may add is that despite Atoms being set at 0 ammount, they keep accumulating the right ammount, every time i make a challenge and earn some atoms, for a brief moment i can see the ammount in menus , i tried that moment to use atom shop asap, and i get error message of shop being refreshed, but it looks like atoms earned are not lost they only being set to 0.
---
Game is Fallout 76 on PC through game pass, and this isnt a problem on xbox one game pass version of the game, i can use atom shop there as usual.
---
TSE .44's were around pre-nerf. Variants of it certainly have been duped.
---
ah in case of ffr u dont need penta barrel. if u have more than 100 of fr the explosition effect double it. but +1 perception isnt a magic effect so who knows y u can solo her in 2 min. did u manage deal a sneak attack?
---
Known bug. No fix eta
---
One thing I’m wondering, is the paddle ball weapon in the game? Cause we can make the ammo for it.
---
I'm almost level 40 and I've only won one time.  I make the final ten all the time, but I usually have a sniper build while it's great for getting kills while staying safe enough to last most of the match you kinda her shit on close quarters, and I blow at close quarters aiming anyway.  😔
---
Theres no reason we shouldn't be able to build on the bridge other than the tadpole run, and it wasbt even there at release.  I wanted to build there so bad too.  Other than the tadpole run, it's just a huge piece of scenery with no other reason to go across it
---
Well, to make you feel better, some of us are legitimately trying to be courteous. Anymore, I just ignore the legendaries in events like Campfire Tales and Uranium Fever. I’m there for the event to succeed and the treasury notes. If I can slap damage a legendary, it’s just bonus. Anything legendaries drop in an event is 100% scrip fodder for me, and there’s plenty of opportunities to max out my 1000 scrip.
---
I cant even figure out how to.
---
I have a level 5 one of those for my low level character I’m working on! Breaks so often, but does great damage considering he has no other weapons than a hunting rifle and random pipe pistols he picks up (10/10 will break and fix again)
---
Yes.  Idk how “known” it is though as I had no issue collecting atoms through challenges until recently. 
---
Seen two threads today about it.  I’d send a ticket to Bethesda.
---
Saw an update from this one earlier.  Apparently it’s been reported
---
Let us Camp in towns like Flatwoods and wotoga after the robot missions. Let us resettle places like top of the world.
---
Look up in the sky and scroll out :)
---
I have the option to do both. Ps4
---
Wasn't online for hours after reset and lost 2 weeklies.  So...
---
Ty and people around me agree. I love the game and love buying things in it.
---
I think my budget is around there somewhere if you include first and the 4000 atom pack. The Piper outfit pack threw that off though
---
Or you got lucky?
---
The event marker did not show up that time. The event not started, but we killed the queen.
---
Add Locks to the doors
---
Well, everyone loves bangalore more but the nice part is that they can stack up together so you can do them at the same time if you're not doing them religiously.
---
You can go to McDonald's and get shit in place of hamburger, and it's ok!  Don't be entitled!
---
Retirement plan is quicker but mega annoying when the target is already dead so you don't get the tiny extra rep for choosing "Appalachia has a new corpse".
---
That’s ridiculous since I haven’t had issues earning atoms on Steam until the last day or two.  
---
Which route did you go to get ahold of someone on support?
---
No because they absolutely gave us nothing to work with for the SS faction. May as well be a deserted vault.
---
I'm PS4 as well and it will only do one a day. When Wastelanders first dropped in let me do two. Not anymore
---
I once got one of the secret service people to spawn in as a legendary.
---
check the vendor bot at Camden Park. I think he sells all the excavator plans.
---
Makes sense, no item loss so power creep is the only way to keep content fresh.
---
Misc structures at the end of the building menu. It's an atom shop purchase  for 500 atoms
---
Not exactly a secret service agent, but as a military officer. Got the military officer outfit and hat, run around with a 10mm submachine gun and use the salute emote to say hello.
---
Ticket sent Got an automated response about S.C.O.R.E and at the bottom 
---
"If we don't hear from you in 4 days we'll consider the issue resolved"
---
I kept a log on notepad about what I've earned and when And sent the original ticket and that log in a reply to Bethesda.
---
If they banned anyone who had a duped weapon half the players would be gone, so don't worry too much.
---
Already is there. It's basically just an extended "well rested" (3h instead of 2h) with a different name for if you got with the ally or not.
---
I tried that to mixed results
---
It would be dailies only. But knowing Bethesda...
---
everyone has been grinding so much that people are putting pretty good stuff in machines for cheap. Also the market has a lot of god tier dupes, so there isn't much demand for mid tier weapons
---
Thank you.  What recourse do you think there will be, if any?
---
It looks like you get a perk card pack as the icon is the same as the others, but without the writing
---
Just skip a day and dont do it. Retirement plan will pop everyday...or at least that worked for me
---
Yeah same generic response I got.  Responding will just update to read response.  Not sure it’s worth trying another reason - I think it just changed back to a challenge request
---
Why do I even question it. I didn’t know it could even be placed though.
---
Totally a dick move to just place it somewhere
---
You could do the quest where you kill the raider, choose the option where you attack the raider, go back and choose the option "Appalachia has a new corpse", then immediately back out of the conversation. Allows you to keep talking to her about it and gain faction standing.
---
With Excavator, Calibrated Shocks, and Motion Assist, I’m regularly at 500
---
Same here hehe
---
I use VATs mostly so armor is important to boost AP needed to do more damage.
---
Put them in your vendor so I can buy them cheap (and then drop them after) since I found a deal too good to pass up yesterday and I’m rocking about 400 caps.
---
Atoms
---
Extreme grind, and considering it's double xp it makes sense. They could've also bought some ranks with atoms
---
it was for sale?
---
The dev room was accessible a long time ago using a wall clipping glitch not a hack and it was absolutely accessed on consoles because the marine armored helmet was a dev room item for a long time until they added the recipe to craft it and people had it long before then.
---
Somebody bought my 1500 10mm yesterday must have had too many caps and wanted to get rid of some
---
Bethesda enables using atoms to buy rank increases on... Tuesday.
---
We did 3 Queens on a server and it showed up after 2 of the queen's, it's a pretty fun addition. Insane health pool and hits a little harder than Queen.
---
There was also a experience glitch they could have done in order to get it besides the double xp.
---
If your on PC, it could be an old one (possibly ongoing).  I stopped playing after I reached level 100, but there was a bug that after you picked your location and clicked on the button, it would randomly drop the nuke. Instead, you need to actually press ENTER on the keyboard to drop at intended location.
---
I tried that one day but it turns out people can still buy from an unpowered vendor. One alternate solution some people shared was to put them in a room behind a powered door, and then cut power to the door so it couldn't open.
---
It's damage based.
---
Edit: Mobs will target whoever is closest, unless a player nearby has significantly higher damage output, based on the weapon your holding, it's fire rate, reload speed, attack speed, everything. When I have my bloodied  dcg out players can run around me without worrying because I become the priority target.
---
Thanks! I’m not even sure how many challenges I completed nor how many atoms I got or didn’t get. Hope there is a retroactive fix or reimbursement on lost atoms.
---
Refund has already been processed and approved. Unlike bethesda, microsoft was really on the ball.
---
Microsoft has already processed and approved my refund. They were really on the ball.
---
New Vegas got me into the series, then played FO3 and craved FO4 for years and was not let down. 76 isn't the type of game I usually play but I enjoy it. Truth be told, if this wasn't set in the Fallout universe, I doubt I'd play it.
---
I just love Fallout and this is more of that.
---
You should try ark.
---
I was really disappointed that the log cabin was a pre made, my own fault for not reading the product description but would have loved to make a cosy wood cabin.
---
Yeah, on a true bloodied build pretty much any bloodied rifle will oneshot everything anyway- no point in instigating. Bosses you’d want bloodied on already.
---
Born and raised in southeastern Kentucky just across the river, and yeah, Appalachia does not have "flat" anywhere. But that doesn't excuse Bethesda's build system. They have no way to extend foundations down, or to build dirt embankments when an area gets leveled, as in the real world.
---
Build yourself a 2x2 or 3x3 using the Settler’s dirt tiles or find a flat area. I’ll use gourds as an example since I mentioned it. Place a gourd then place another one as close as possible.  Make a blueprint of those two gourds. Then place that blueprint down amongst the original two. Then blueprint the ones that you get the closest. Scrap any that are too far apart and keep blueprinting the ones that are stacked and the way you want them. Works great.
---
I named my shotgun leon
---
Well what’s your current build/special set up currently?
---
I started a rifle build.  Started a second character with the intention of melee/heavy.  But now I’m opting back to rifle lol.  Sorts doing a hybrid shotgun/rifle/heavy build.  Use a perk loadout mod helps a lot - which should be officially in game later this year
---
Yea they're scattered throughout the map. Just need to run into them again.
---
My opinion is that it is hideous to look at. Very bulky/cheap/plasticky. I wear a Ghillie suit over mine. To be fair the helmet looks amazing though.
---
THIS.
---
I haven’t found any that stack... but Empath mutation apparently stacks (well, sort of- apparently having empath and being in a group gives the group *including* yourself the 25% reduction, and gives you the 25% damage reduction penalty, giving you a net neutral effect. Another party member with it will then also give you their reduction effect. 
---
With SiN boosting it and Class Freak reducing the negatives, it’s a massive damage reduction effect with 2 empathy.
---
Bethesda can add more PvP events like capture the flag, horde arenas (compete to kill the most enemies), king of the hill, etc. Legendary enemies should get buff and there needs to be more world boss events. Adding a text chat feature to the pip boy wouldn't be so bad.
---
Id put my camp in more areas if there were more flat areas. Im near the bridge because I have a random spawn point behind my house (good for random junk) and its reasonably flat
---
I know the pain of the tent. Eventually I gave up and my campsite just became a sleeping bag and pit fire. No floating tent for me, no thanks.
---
I agree that they need to snap. I would love to just be able to easily place stairs to the front door of the prefab.
---
It would also be nice if the refabs came with a power connector outside and inside, since the windows are sometime closed it is a pain to glitch conduits through the wall so that vendors can be inside.
---
It's under walls. It allows you to place it on the front of it.
---
It has its own special garage door, scroll through the walls tab.
---
in this case just dont care to much about farming reputation:) I spend 40+ rolls trying to get bloodied gauss minigun &amp; shotgun and still nothing.
---
I thought it was just me. I just picked this game up and when I first encountered an assaultron, I said “*im gonna cheese this thing like I did in fallout 4*... I’m getting melted from behind walls/ tree and even when it’s not even aiming at me. Shits frustrating.
---
Lmao thank you for this. And see... I *can't* drink so I can play the high road but it's really more of a health issue otherwise I would too. 😂
---
The dev room that contains weaponized cola ammo has no door to it, you have to specifically teleport to that cell. You cant glitch through a wall into it, you had to use cheat engine or something similar to edit your location. It wasnt doable on console without modding your console.
---
Its possible someone did get in while dev rooms were lootable, with a modded console, but i think its unlikely.
---
Agreed it's mind blowing how much coffee costs. For what! I can make it all at home.
---
Also the more people, the higher the chance your stealth will break so you will notice a decrease in damage (no stealth multipliers) compared to soloing/small group of stealth players. This may have also contributed to the myth around damage reduction / heath increases
---
I run 515-525 with unyielding build and a high capacity backpack :|
---
I have all of that and still live at the repair bench with my two shot explosive lever...
---
Go as far as you can with each faction BEFORE doing the final quest.
---
You will get a warning once you have gone as far as you can with a particular faction before you choose.
---
Then pick which one you want. After getting the Vault raid you can keep gaining rep with BOTH factions by doing dailies with each faction.
---
Get these Dailies by going to each day
---
--
---
Ward at Foundation
---
Rocksy &amp; Wren (it alternates) at Crater
---
Also go to Davenport at the Overeer's House &amp; he will give you a daily where you take two photos. DO NOT give the photos to him. Give them to one of the factions (either Ward at Foundation or Kiyomi at Crater). You will get rep from the faction you give it to.
---
So if you want rep from Foundation agree with Davenport to take photos of Crater &amp; vice-versa He tells you to choose which one you want to take photos of so pick the opposite faction to the one you want rep from
---
THEN go back to Davenport who will tell you off &amp; give you three treasury notes anyway. 
---
N.B If you have high Charisma you get the option to lie to him &amp; say you were mugged &amp; he will give you more rewards
---
You must return to Davenport or it won't trigger it the next day hit only completes once you visit him.
---
Also for Raider rep go to Ohio River Adventures (to Bones I think). And trigger the Mirelurk thing you will get Raider rep from them for helping them kill the Mirelurks there. You can server hop top keep redoing this one (unless it is patched now)
---
Finally got the backpack plan yesterday!
---
some guy tried to lock me in a circus car. who knows what was next! I didnt stick around to find out, i just fast traveled home lol
---
Reading it sounded like the # of dailies would just double. So a 6 daily day would have 12 available.
---
As a screenshot enthusiast, these are amazing!
---
Theyre around on pc for sure. Its possible whoever posted the picture just plugged a controller into their pc. If there genuinely is one on console, its not a queen drop. So many people run queens that, unless its a bug with the most recent hotfix, someone else would have seen it. I expect its just a controller on pc though. Its technically possible someone could have modded their console to allow it to run external scripts and teleported into the dev room to loot it, but that would have had to have been months and months ago, looting dev cells (most, not all) dev cells has been impossible for ages now.
---
Also, thirst zappers were cheated in on pc ages ago also, but theyve been added to the item auto delete list, and were actually the first item, along with the acid soaker to be added to it. So any in stash boxes or inventories get automatically wiped if they exist.
---
yeah it is like selling plans for ultracite PA. a vendor must be a dick to put full price for these plans.
---
Excellent, found it thanks 👍
---
I recruited Gramps and still regularly see him at NPC spawning locations despite him already being at my camp.
---
You have to move your camp. Be warned though, since it was placed it'll always be in your stored eating up camp space. But you can't get rid of them, because they don't show up in the stored tab.
---
Throw some stuff away. I went through my pockets and stash a while back and threw away all the random b.s. notes and holotapes and it made a world of difference. Much faster and smoother navigating the stash and pip boy menus.
---
Or when it slices through a wall?
---
I find them regularly on my legendary run in the mire/bog. They’re there, just not as frequent.
---
There are a few places with computers that aren't busted I can think off and after the circle moves to the hills barely anything is changing the bots would add that fortnite/warzone feel of seeing a plane or a balloon dropping a box of good gear
---
It’s been brought up.  Here is a bigger thread for it
---
Really frustrating, especially with support closing the ticket.  Same with me.
---
Great, grand, wonderful.
---
"texture" - 4 out of 5 times it actually stops me in my tracks because it just looks like the game couldn't load the actual texture yet, hence the vomit of a placeholder, so I stand there waiting until I remember.......
---
I thought it just meant instead of 6 of 250/1 of 500 they’d be 6 of 500/1 of 1000 for like 3-4 days. Dailies only, weeklies unaffected.
---
NW challenges?
---
Gotta love all the people that deny all the bugs in game and act like theyve never encountered a single issue and will downvote you for saying so and then they wonder  where all the players are (oh and bye bye to like half the playerbase that abused a dupe bug and got knee jerk permabanned instead of just having their characters wiped)
---
(angry player)
---
(resumes bbq of icebox)
---
(more thumbs down)
---
(it was the game developer who made the icebox)
---
Daily and Weekly challenges, this includes NW ones and the repeatable xp one (This one doesn't seem to be working with NW xp). You could also buy ranks with Atoms.
---
Bethesda doesn’t give a shit bruv
---
Same here. 20-30 single shots from my lever with couple if good crits &amp; I’m good for queen/colossus loot. I only fire when she lands.
---
You got it from buying atoms with real money, they aren't just gonna add it to the atom shop.
---
Kill, craft, build, and LOOT. I love looting also killing on 2x xp is a ton of fun..
---
No offense but this is an awful idea, because it would just end up being abused.
---
PC?
---
If you mean the coat that Maxon wears in Fallout 4, yes. But it was part of an E3 promotion where you had to buy it with real money alongside atoms.
---
maybe the private Vault system is more for that. instead of each player having a vault, it's more akin to a guild.
---
They have answered your prayers and have given us non working atom challenges too.
---
Me too lol
---
I see them all the time around The Whitespring.  Plus, you can call one to using one of the enclave terminals once you done that questline.
---
They also included non working customer support as they just close tickets with no response
---
That grind has me though.
---
The only way Bethesda could include our Weekly Challenges for Double SCORE is to do a Double SCORE week.  Some Weekly Challenges are impossible to delay till the weekend like kill 30 creatures or level 3 times.  Others would require changing a person's gamestyle like kill 10 Legendaries or crit 25 times.
---
Lol I can only imagine the people getting on there just to say penis 400 times.
---
the repeatable xp and xp bonus weekend has given people a chance to get way way far on the game, just by flat event/mob grinding
---
In my opinion yes. You can reach pretty much anything you want with a goos marsupial bounce &amp; jet pack boost! I love it!
---
Ive seen a few here and there on Xbox.
---
How about the uniform? Or the Power Armor? Or the regular armor?
---
The real problem is licensing the music
---
Been playing since beta. It happens to me evey once in awhile.
---
The nuke launches have been great...though i'm gonna have to spend next week stocking up on supplies that i spent repairing my weapons and making more ammo XD
---
Im referring to lore or quests. They actually bothered with characterization and yet it absolutely is completely irrelevant. Honestly the way the vault quest ends and how they handled these guys it screams that they rushed the ending on that part of the game. Like I stumbled across the gold and didn’t even realize it lol. Then suddenly Meg comes up out of nowhere and it just fucking ends. There is literally to talk to any of the SS because nothing happens.
---
It's so mind numbingly boring I reverted to using this Rocksy "work around" I maxed out both factions just to do it but highly recommend against going for max rank, there's nothing worth putting that time in for. Same for score. It just opens up another series time gated\daily limit grinds. Grinds are the endgame
---
For project paradise if it's just me rarely will anyone else ever show up [I can solo it with a tier 3 animal] but if someone else does show up suddenly like 3 or 4 more people jump in. 
---
I'm guessing people see one person and assume it'll fail. If they see 2 they think oh it'll succeed.
---
On the first collage, every picture on the right column represents everything wrong with the lighting and texture (as far as glossiness goes) quality of Fallout 76.  Too much shine, very hazy and overblown exterior lighting conditions, and interior lighting that doesn't feel natural at all. It's way too bright, and has issues where areas without lights are illuminated by seemingly invisible sources.
---
it is kind of silly i can carry more on my person than on a literal walking tank frame.
---
I thought they only stored 6 items each...is it 15?
---
You can get it for 50 mr fuzzy tokens. Technically the mods for it exist in game but they are not obtainable without cheating
---
It's not just inspect for me, I can't see any pictures at all when something is selected.  I can see my items, but not the other person's... it's quite frustrating especially for newer players who don't know exactly what they're "looking at".
---
Explosive 2shot gatling plasma with beamer splitter. Condition what condition this gun needs to be repaired lol
---
The main reason why lots of players go Raider is due to siding with Raiders is the only way to the Slug Buster weapon.  It is a plasma rifle with reduced weight, anti-armor, and crits do more damage.  Also, the Raiders have the best characters with Gail and Ra-Ra.  Befriending Ra-Ra is also how players can get the Slug Buster.
---
Hmm, don't have any issues with LOD, but the textures, yeah, they really need sorting out. There's even plenty of textures that look low res (and shiny) when you get close to them.  
---
At the very least Beth should release the format of NIF's and Textures being used, and allow community made texture packs. While it's not a fix, it's a band-aid fix. Perhaps Beth don't know how to fix and could learn a few things from the community?  
---
There are brilliant texture mod makers out there that have done amazing improvements with no or improved impact on game performance since Morrowind.
---
-At The Thorn
---
-Around tinker’s workbench on 2nd floor at Clancy Manor
---
-Storage room (“death comes for us all”) beside bar counter on 2nd floor at The Kill Box
---
-Guardhouse outside The Whitespring Bunker; and rooftop outside The Whitespring Service Entrance
---
-Guardhouse, and tent on rooftop, outside Monongah Power Plant
---
All from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic#h.p14wcsgx9tkk)
---
how about s Corvega or a Lone Wanderer (the Motorcycle) to customize
---
Having vehicles in Fallout, let alone ones you could customize, would be welcome indeed.
---
I'd love a lone wanderer to put at my camp!
---
Maxed out fix it good will allow u to repair to 200% and white knight reduces the amount of resources needed for repair. As for more balistic weave locations the military outposts in the cranberry bog have some as well.
---
maybe they just like stash boxes snd turrets
---
Ban wave is only for adventure mode exploits iirc, they haven't done shit about NW cheaters ever. There are multiple infamous names that reached level 90-100 aimbotting all the way up. For what it's worth, I haven't ran into any cheaters recently, so either you got unlucky or it's gotten worse in the past few days
---
Why would u automatically block someone for taking a workshop 😂
---
I could've sworn I pulled the plan from the quest, but I must've been mistaken.
---
S.C.O.R.E. and XP are different, S.C.O.R.E. isn't double
---
I have a theory about maybe why - that is because they are now resistant to radiation and it is radiation that mutates Creatures of Appalachia into become Legendary versions of themselves.
---
Ya the helmet is decent. Might grab it after. Not sure.
---
Yeah, I typically run 4 accounts at a time. All have Empath, Class Freak, and Strange in Numbers. The character I'm actively playing is nigh immortal. In power armor, especially, I can pretty much face tank an army of Colonel Gutsys and Assaultrons without ever needing a stimpack.
---
Wish they would increase our camp size and/or let us choose our camp shape.
---
Not a fan of the circle. I would prefer a rectangle.
---
I second this
---
Double XP as for the repeatable XP challenge that awards SCORE per 10k of it.
---
No but with the xp buff, every 50 or so decent lvl ghouls with not too many other xp increasing bonuses = 100 score. Rinse and repeat
---
IDK what to tell you.
---
Yes, I got the T-60 Officer Paint yesterday as a drop.
---
Good luck, seems like most everybody talking about Nuclear Winter in this sub are bush campers who play a completely different game. Those who play all the time, big recurring names, aggressive players etc know what’s up w this mode.
---
Did everyone forget about how the legs are it's weak point or am I lost? Also I can't agree more with what you are staying it happens too much for it to be even close to "it just works"
---
I have a full stealth build and I always get em in the legs as it's the weak spot
---
There are a couple of stories Involving pets in the game - thats one of them.  
---
Theres another that begins with a note you find at a small farm in the divide.
---
It's stupid compared to these other complaints but I replaced a door with a curtain and holy shit it was an almost impossible task to get it flush with the wall. I couldn't even adjust it if it was set wrong. I had to scrap it and build a new one. I finally got it even with the door and flush, but I was this close to saying fuck it by the time I got it there. Maybe the hardest thing I've done in the game. Curtain boss is OP.
---
I guess I don't have to explain how damage reduction works.
---
I saw a friendly legendary SB as anyone can see them in certain areas :)
---
That’s lame 😒 but clever
---
I'm actually having the opposite problem of it appearing closed when open.
---
Oof didn’t know 😬
---
Its not that its less durable - you are fighting higher level enemies that hit harder.
---
THeres also several military ammo bags at camp Mclintock.
---
milititary duct tape and ssq fur are other sourcesm and bots sell it bulk
---
It's been really bad the past few days. Double exp brings all the hackers out of the woodworks. I rank up faster on a normal week because I don't run into anywhere near as many cheaters.
---
ATHENA?
---
Exactly that lol block for a pvp advantage Winner winner chicken dinner 😉🤣
---
??
---
Was also just killed by this dude on pc. He had 16 kills by the time I reported him and left.
---
There is a quest about a dude and his dog.Dog got ill,guy got told doctors couldn’t do anything about it.Guy had a degree in chemistry or something so he set on creating a cure for his dog.But a byproduct was he created some albino radstags.He felt bad so he retreated to his refuge in the mountains where he and the dog died side by side.
---
I’ll try that thanks
---
I did both Raider and Foundation quests until I had to choose.
---
Ultimately I chose Foundation because the crew was far more interesting than the Raiders.
---
Sure, Paige is an ass but he also cares a LOT about his people. Penelope is my favorite Ghoul and what she did for her family was amazing. Loved Motherload(RIP) and Jen. The actual military personnel were amazing. And don’t even get me started on our little Liberator.
---
And while I love Meg, Weasel(whom I would literally die for), and Ra-Ra the Gentleman ruined the entire Raider side for me. Definitely my least favorite character in any Fallout game.
---
I’ll definitely go with Raiders next time though.
---
Thanks for the info I’ll give that a try
---
Ah yes. Had that. Probably Entirely different glitch. 😂 Something to do with if it gets 1hp I think.
---
Coming soon to the Atom shop: Land flattener thingy. Only 10,000 atoms!
---
Get used to it, people are pissed off and taking it out on the player base to spite Bethesda. There’s a group dedicated to crashing servers, and they’re halfway decent at it 😆
---
Like to add that they follow in an instanced location too. I imagine the instanced places are servers in and of themselves which helps with game load. That's why all of the deeper story stuff happens in instanced areas.
---
one that you could use oil instead of caps to fast travel to other places along roads or something, that would be nice.
---
Run with melee build and 1 hit everything easy af
---
so do the atoms for these challenges now go to the bethesda launch account (instead of the steam account) or do they disappear?
---
Maybe you just need to relax and enjoy 76. 
---
Exploration in 76 is way better than 4 and appalachia is the best map bethesda has ever done. Full of secrets to uncover. 
---
If you enter in the grind mentality you may feel burned
---
I know i do, its not my cup of tea. If i need to lose some worthless cosmetics that i never wanted in the first place in order to enjoy my gaming so be it.
---
lol :)
---
I haven’t played other FOs, maybe it was way easier to deal with in FO4 but it doesn’t make sense at all for a robot to operate the same way as a human player holding its body part.
---
Mmm hmmm. Mole miners metal band event. A mosh pit of mole miners needs taking care of Appalachia. Get to the site and save what's left. That would be the wildest event ever. I would definitely be going especially if the music was metal for 15 minutes.  Melee fist fight only. Or PvP too.
---
Anyway it is good to know that girls play this game as well :)
---
True. Any lore that I use for my guy is mainly taken from Fallout 2. Example: Frank Horrigan, Control Station ENCLAVE, etc etc. We had the most lore for the SS in Fallout 2.
---
What's so hard there? Target sentry bot's fusion core on his back- its 1 shot kill even for max level sentry bots (sneak to his back). For asaulttrons enforcer perk with shitgun - cripple head to get rid of laser and cripple legs after
---
Was doing the right thing for Encryptid last night. I spent the 2500+ caps to make the recall card, was going to wait till t-30 sec, but some douche started it with 5 mins to go. And all I got from the Imposter Sheepsquatch was a damn Junkie's Spear! 😫
---
I mean that's quite funny but ultimately it's the best case scenario considering some of the awful things that people say on the Internet.
---
True, I have no images of other player items as well as the inspect button not working. The frustration of it never being addressed is real.
---
This is also true.
---
If she aggros the person standing on the tent she may not land, otherwise it shouldn't matter.
---
Haven’t played FO4 before but where does it say it’s supposed to be identical to FO4 anyway? Talking out of your ass doesn’t make you knowledgeable.
---
Considering Fallout has always been a PC focussed game, I wouldn’t go anywhere near 76 on a PC. Console all the way.
---
If you want any good XP, it’s mostly tied to surviving a long time, so you actively do nothing the game mode is about. Don’t do anything, just sit in a bush and hide. It’s stupid that Bethesda even call it a battle royal when it actively discourages it. The devs need to work on the XP numbers so it’s not 90% from surviving.
---
If you have raider punk in your
---
I respect any player who enjoys teaming and playing with others, but I  don't! I started playing this game recently because it now offers a real solo experience. Why should their be bonuses for making alliances? Why not bonuses for not making alliances and just getting on with playing solo?
---
Changing perks anytime sucks too. Its a missed oportunity that everyone can do evrything. 
---
I initially thought that you couldnt change perks so a high DPS character would need a high INT player to mod his stuff and a lockpicking thief player to open some doors or crates. That way we could all feel special and sell special servicies or items.
---
Maybe change your perks when you level up or at your camp (so we can use different builds) but not anytime. Now we re walking gods able to do whatever we want. 
---
Legendary weapons are sone random and its effects so important that make special stats almost meaningless.
---
I feel that those two things made fallout more like borderlands, and i dont like borderlands.
---
There's nothing I like better than making some other poor bastard die for his country!
---
100 extra atoms
---
You will still be able to get both, however if you complete up untill the military quest for the settlers you will get the plans for the stealth suit for free.  Otherwise, it becomes a bullion item
---
It is a crafting material but it's self is also needed to be crafted so to be able to put it in the scrap box it would be broken down again and not be gun powder
---
Ok cool, so foundation won’t become hostile or anything?
---
Yes, you will get a daily from the settlers no matter who you side with. You can also do Davenport(Overseer's house) quest for a little boost in rep on the opposite faction you choose.
---
I took a break between February and May, when I came back I could tell something was off but couldn't pinpoint it. I thought maybe my dweller was just... greasy or something. Now I notice the wet shine on everything and I hate it. Also, what happened to the lighting? Everything is so dark now, I didn't used to have to turn on my flashlight indoors.
---
On any given character, you can fully max out the reputation with both factions, regardless of who you side with for the break-in to the Vault. There will be slight differences in dialogue at both faction locations, but, for the time being, there are no long-lasting effects in terms of who you side with. Both factions can reach Ally status no matter what.
---
Hinder the experience is an understatement, it's no fun at all. I'm still happy to have a pc and use some mods in other Beth games though. But I won't touch NW again and I won't even try the survival mode.
---
That's not even mentioning the gravel one lanes full of switch back turns, no guard rails, and the 100 or so foot drop on one side
---
No  if anything they will praise the fact you raided the vault even after siding with the riders lol
---
The area was a trappers camp I believe. That dude and his dog were tortured before they died. That scene broke my heart too.
---
As a morrowind fan i also see this trend.
---
Honestly though, i find 76 quest better than f4s. 
---
I cant remember more than 10 non repeatable sidequest in f4. And maybe 3 of them are good.
---
All in all f76 are at lest more interesting.
---
I placed a Switch on my Vendor's powerline and turn it off when I get nearbthe Caps cap. Then I take my time to spend it on something useful and turn the vendor on again,
---
They won't, you can actually become ally for them both at the same time.  I recommend completing the prep missions for both of the factions before siding with one. Just be aware after johnnys quest (for raiders) and military people(for settlers) you will be asked(via pop up) if youd like to side with that faction.  At that point just go do the other factions prep missions and then decide which youd like to side with for extra rep
---
If the person/people on said tent aren’t actively her target she can/will still land, but as others have said if she is targeting one of those people then it messes with her AI tracking and she will just spend forever in the air. Same with the idiots standing on the fences.
---
&gt;Make your case for why ARs dominate NW.
---
I don't have to make any case. I actually play the mode and I see it daily with my own eyes.   Anybody who actually plays the mode does too.
---
Go to whitesprings and one of the vendors will be selling it in bulk. Save your time and pay the caps.
---
Well the enemies are already easy enough for an effective build, they will need new creatures to make 4-5 stars attractive. The gauss shotty is a good example, very nice and powerful but only to get nerfed to mediocre because everything dies after one shot.
---
Yeah I had someone make a full on trap cage over the spawn point of sunshine meadows the other day.  Lucky I was busy doing events with my friend and didn't discover this till after the guy had left.
---
I found a perfect spot next to the shooting club in the toxic region, it's in the middle of a mirelurk, cultist, and radstag and sometimes Yao Guai spawn, so whenever I spawn in my turrets are always active, the river I built on is wed enough to get foundation set up and I don't have any atomic shop builds (except Ace the Raider Protectoron), hell my house is a 4X2 cube, it ain't pretty but it works,
---
Your vault raid, if I'm not mistaken, has no impact on the faction you aren't directly working with, unless you choose to share the gold you earn with both factions (where you will earn positive reputation with both factions at the cost of less bullion for your character at the end of the quest). And you can complete all of the quests for both factions up to the Side With X quests that force you to pick a side. Completing all of these will earn as much reputation per character as possible before the end of the main story, while also unlocking the Stealth Suit plans (so long as you complete the quests for Foundation leading up to the Side With Foundation quest).
---
I know there's a chart somewhere of the exact experience you earn for each action you take in the mode. 20 XP per revive or kill, 50 XP for launching a nuke, X amount of XP per second or minute survived, etc. From there, your experienced earned directly contributes to your Overseer rank for Nuclear Winter, while a multiplied amount of your experience earned (around 3 times, I believe, though I haven't seen exact calculations) is also earned for Adventure mode. This experience won't contribute to your SCORE repeatable challenge, but will ultimately help level you up without having to solely play Adventure.
---
and overall wtf and the canibal perk didnt brake ur heart?
---
Think what you want, when that ban comes your way don't get salty ya hear?
---
Happened to me with the Encryptid Event. I had not finished the questline, going to the cabin was the next step, went there while people where standing and waiting and because my questline told me to check the terminal, I did so.
---
The rest was a big mess and I felt so sorry, I had participated in the event before, just never finished the questline and did not realize that using the terminal to finish it would launch the event. Bad Design. 
---
I agree, the only one able to start it should be the one who used the keycard.
---
If you can survive into the top 10, usually around 20 mins, then you should get 500-700 xp for adventure.
---
For nw, it varies, it’s basically how long you can survive and get into the top 10. I suck at pvp and only engage when with my team. I’m around rank 14, usually a couple matches and I’ve ranked up
---
Sadly...this ☝️
---
Xp is really based on survival time. You get 20xp per kill...not really worth it imo
---
I haven't bothered moving my camp in over a year because I've never gotten a saved blueprint to agree that it could be placed anywhere else ever again. Didn't matter how small the footprint or flat the land,  "item cannot be placed."
---
I love fallout games since the originals and im a bethesda fan since morrowind. 
---
I come to accept that f4 was a looter shooter and i enjoyied for what it was. 
---
Bought f76 on the beta days. My hopes were kinda low since i hated f4 and feel that, althought is not what i wanted (SP RPG), is way better than what i expected. 
---
Appalachia is awesome and I enjoyed the exploration in the pre wastelanders days. Wastelanders update gave me hope for the future since traditional dialogue is back and the rich world i explored now feels more alive. Now changes keep coming to the wasteland. Im really hapoy with the game direction. Although i miss my daily atoms.
---
I could never get this to work
---
Yeah, died twice to him shooting my teammates and myself through all the buildings from across the map.
---
I do play, I have a level 300 and 3 level 50+. I mainly use ARs because I feel guilty killing players with explosives, especially low level players without decent perk cards. It's so easy to win with explosives it got to the point where it's not even fun anymore. Now that you know I play, make your case for why ARs dominate NW.
---
The kazoo gods are smiling at me, Scorchbeasts. Can you say the same?
---
I see your big heart. I see you.❤
---
Screw the people, the animals deserve better.
---
Yes that would be epic and would give us another fun event to enjoy just moshing with people and there could be the tune bonus fot an hour after attending it.
---
I've been playing since the beta...
---
The first thing about your build I notice is that you have no Mutations.  These are pretty powerful and useful utility perks to have.  The main ones I'd go for are:
---
Marsupial - jump height makes it a lot easier to get around the map. You have high STR already but carry weight is still helpful.
---
Speed Demon - running and reloading faster is useful for any build
---
Herbivore/Carnivore - more benefit from food means less time gathering it and less you need to carry around
---
Electrically Charged - not that powerful but doesn't really have a downside
---
Other than that it may be better to focus on just one ranged weapon type so you can spend perks elsewhere.
---
Also END is honestly a dump stat I'd drop a perks from there.
---
CHA is really good now because all the "in a team" perks can be active when you're in a public team by yourself
---
In terms of weapons there's a lot of choice.  Good legendaries to look for are:
---
Anti Armor
---
Furious (on rapid fire weapons)
---
Two Shot (is not bad but there are better)
---
Vampires
---
On the second star the main thing you want to look for is explosive but faster fire rate is also decent. But a decent one star will get you a long way.
---
Pretty much every heavy weapon is good, I'd avoid the explosive ones though.  The main weapons I used on my heavy were the Gatling Gun, Gatling Plasma and The 50 Cal Machine Gun.
---
For Commando guns I'd go for the Handmade Rifle, The Fixer or 10mm Smg.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying the game.  You'll pick up a lot from just playing and chatting to other players.
---
[Heres](http://imgur.com/a/wwjus9H) the chart
---
So the guy who was standing on my tent, aggroing the queen, who was also the guy who reported me, was the actual issue? 
---
I use traits like evasive to reduce the aggro on myself because I am a squishy support build.
---
[This](http://imgur.com/a/wwjus9H) should answer your question
---
Their AP rounds hurt a lot by punching through your damage resistance, and even cripple limbs faster than normal gunshots, but that's normal.
---
Instant head laser from an Assaultron, though... that's bullshit.
---
Yeah, that cage...
---
As 2 dogs owner, my heart is broken and I feel anger towards the raiders who did this. I want to kill them. So I assault all and every that I encounter. Ally or not.
---
Isn’t that 5mm not .50?
---
Create a folder then log these hackers.   After a while submit the Bethesda.  Eventually they will get banned.
---
Carnivore + strange in numbers + cranberry meatball grinder really makes a difference
---
Don’t know about the crops, but lock your water and junk
---
\*Raising my hand.
---
With it's massive size, I'd imagine it would take a huge chunk off the camp building budget, but at the same time, it's attack power is unrivaled compared to the other sentries &amp; defenses available.
---
Shoot it’s legs from afar,then take pot shots at it. If you sneak you can stay out of its vision.
---
They were level three locked.
---
You -&gt; Bush -&gt; Win. Bush wookie for life.
---
But they activated the rank up button! We can just pay to advance now, it works out great for Bethesda.
---
As soon as you hit the middle option, your reputation bar will increase. Hit back out immediately and it should work. I also back away a little from her because she has dragged me back into conversation with her idle dialogue.
---
It's only been since Wastelanders and the new lighting.
---
A bunch of old bugs crept back in too, like Grass clipping through foundations (was fixed for almost a year, then came back with Wastelanders)
---
It could indeed.
---
Plans for neon are at bos bot in Morgantown not the station.
---
never mind
---
Like others said, the tent itself does not block her. The 17 people standing on top of it, that's what interferes. 
---
Its frustrating and causes me to jump around like a nut to aggro her on me. But as a small and trivial victory....I really enjoy moving my tent mid battle 🙂
---
Or they just payed and unlocked it in 10 minutes.
---
Train journey the other day and saw small ponds and thought yip water purifiers😂😂
---
Play and learn along, like every battle royale you’re likely to get killed immediately if people spawn near you. Just experiment with it
---
If that’s her actual target yes, the AI gets confused since she (obviously) can’t land on that tiny tent since it’s elevated from the ground. Causing her AI to just “skip” those times where she may land.
---
Of course someone could still get her attention from said person and she may land then as long as they are moved away from the tent and fences, but agro in this game is really just awful and targets will go after whoever they want.
---
Oh what an ass
---
They can phase through you?   Of course they can.  So the only alternative is turn on voice chat, warn them off and, if they insist, turn on PVP and kill them?   Then maybe get a buddy to kill you to remove the wanted tag?
---
This event is too costly and difficult to have someone else flush it down the drain.
---
It doesn’t seem like support is doing anything lately. I’ve sent multiple tickets for the score bug and have only got one automated response the first time and nothing since. I’m not sure there are any actual people working in that department.
---
lol elite gameplay might try. Btw just played a game where i killed 2 people at the same time but i got killed immediately after looting them
---
I have a pretty dope video saved of when I managed to get into the last 3, me and my teammate. Im being a bush wookie of course and this lady launches a nuke. I had 17 seconds to find her and I found and killed her with 3 seconds to spare winning the match.
---
That's a lot of caps to expend on fast travelling, you're a true explorer haha!  
---
With the public teams, it's worth joining one to make use of the additional free fast travel points (such as the camps and survival tents of your fellow team mates).   
---
Use those to 'slingshot' your way around the map, that will definitely help to lower the amount that you spend in that regard, though at the cost of even more load screens; I'm not sure if that's something that will bother you.  
---
I tend to have something on the side to watch through the load screens when I do this.
---
Someone put it at my CAMP while on a private team, bugged my budget and I couldn't finish my house build. Ended up making a new character since I couldn't stand not being able to finish
---
Who?
---
Seriously, my first time flying into the airport in Charleston, I am looking out the window of the airplane. I see miles and miles of beautiful rolling hills all covered in trees. My first thought was, "Is there any flat ground? Where the hell did they find enough flat ground to land a plane?" Then suddenly the plan was landing and I realized they literally just took the top of one hill and bulldozed it over into the valley next door to make a flat spot for the airport. 
---
Then traveling north to Clarksburg and Morgantown. I-79 is a marvel of modern engineering. That road leaps from hill to hill with constant curves and remains mostly level.
---
The joke is that West Virginia is bigger than Texas if you ironed it out.
---
Xbox, so frustrating, the SBQ was a massive bullet sponge both times and barely landed
---
The ammo Convertor is getting a rework. Interface is being streamlined (apparently) and ammo points being increased from 2000 to 100,000
---
You could report but sadly it won't go far. If you had proof of the scam you could have them added to market blacklists but beyond that nothing one can do.
---
im so used ro being an aggressive player in battle royale games but i think bush wookie is gonna be my new method of domination
---
The guy that pick locked them, if they’re not locked it’s fair game but that’s just being a dick for no reason other that to annoy people
---
Lucky.
---
Oh ok, how could I get them added to the market blacklist?
---
I agree
---
I'm honestly not sure, but you could report them directly via Xbox live for something like unsportsmanlike conduct, which is one of their reportable things. I dunno about in game.
---
Not in game.
---
I’m on pc and could place some for you. Let me know if still needed.
---
Oh ok, I’ll try that. Thanks for the help buddy
---
You can report to Bethesda on their website. But without definitive proof nothing will be done.  Even with definitive proof nothing will be done.
---
lol oh okay, I’ll try my best to report them in any way possible. Thanks for the help
---
Ra Ra is my best raider friend, and she snuck me into a room with a nice reward in the gold vault.  She can be very nice if you aren't a meanie poop head and find her beloved bunnabun.
---
Pulse grenades and a big fat ninja sneak unarmed melee to the nuts will take out the fatass robot no problem.  I did that quest on one of my toons at like level 22.  Ditch the fatman approach.
---
No problem. Some general rules for trading, use the actual trade feature so you can see what each other are charging for things, instead of dropping items in bags. Or buy direct from player vending machines with prices listed, etc. Same with selling.
---
Heart so big...fuk dead people.
---
Someone put 6 at my CAMP while playing a private team with my fiancée and some folks from a discord, ended up taking 2% of my budget. I mean was still enough of an issue to me to make a completely new character. Moral of the story though is just stick to public teams at this point tbh
---
Watch out, everybody: King Edgelord is here.
---
I'm sure they'll finish it sometime next... Year, knowing them. And then the fix will break ten other things.
---
You ne er know when you will be caught short 😂
---
I’ve heard it’s involved in a new dupe. So I’d just avoid it for safety. Ammo isn’t all that hard to make or come by anyway.
---
Yeah, tired of my nice pretty walls and floors clashing with the ugly dirty ass ceilings.
---
Oh yeah that’s why my friend and I usually do, but for this trade they were trading a mask for some kind of gun. Thanks tho man
---
Only if everyone gets a free junk stash
---
Y'all have to wait till payment has been received to Bethesda. Log in and out again.
---
Your probs be able to put down the Tent,
---
Weapon wheel&gt;press F to place tent.
---
But your allotted Atom balance and store unlocks won't be available till they receive the payment. Which can take 2-3 days maximum.
---
My favorite is the road from Terra Alta near the Maryland border down the mountain into Kingwood. It is constant switchbacks where you could go off the road at any moment if you don't have good brakes. Then finally as the road straightens out for the bridge over the Cheat River and a slope up, where you don't really need your brakes anymore, they have an emergency pull out zone for trucks. The trucks don't really need it anymore, because if their breaks stopped working, then they are already in a tree further up the hill.
---
Idk about sbmm, I don't think there is any kind of preset match making. 
---
Best tips I can say, look into maxing out damage ie bloody mess, tenderizer, and one of the "master" perks for each weapon type. 
---
Go to adventure and make a set of stairs, 3 tall, blueprint it and use to get on top of places instead of frog legs.
---
My personal favorite perk is field surgeon, fast stims paired with, if i can find one, a medicine bobblehead. 
---
If youre having trouble being out damaged, try putting on a damage resistance card like ironclad, life giver, body guards, or my favorite nerd rage.
---
Don't forget to use chems and save increased damage ones, overdrive and psycho, for when you know you are about to engage. Every other chem use when you are running around looking for people. 
---
Don't be afraid to run away to get a better spot or to get to better cover.  Its the best time to use a stealth boy. 
---
When you down someone, don't out right kill them. Let them stay downed watch them to see if someone might help them if not kill. When adrenaline is working you only need to down someone not kill. 
---
Crouch when reloading, makes you dissappear from the compass faster. 
---
I have more but I gotta get back to work lol
---
Edit: rad-x stack
---
He had a big bounty so he was probably killing players too
---
I just assumed with all the alcohol around him that he was a raging alcoholic from the stress of all those thefts he’s dealing with.
---
This is true in some countries, lol
---
The train car is sweet.  I think perhaps tied with the bungalow for most useful and cool prefab so far.  
---
Nice work.
---
Killed a legendary glowing ant in lucky hole mine last night, lowest I’ve seen so far
---
Never really thought much about mutations, they don't really hold much interest to me. I did not know that about the teamwork feats.
---
 I've been hoping to get a good 3* weapon, but have not had much luck so far. My best is my Zealous Gatling Laser (30% more damage to Scorched 50% DR when aiming and 33% more accuracy in VATs [But not sure how well it actually does against SBQ, it has the prime receiver, true charging barrels, reflex sight and beam focuser)
---
As for focusing on a single ranged weapon type, I've never really thought much about it before, I felt doing both would fit for the build idea I had. If I go with heavy weapons, I'd be using .50 cal, MG42 and gatling laser. Rifles I'd stick with the auto handmade and laser rifle. (Never been a fan of plasma weapons or the gauss rifle, not a fan of the aesthetics of them)
---
Trust nobody you don't already know. If I'm t a workshop or whatever defending it and someone comes up I'm always super wary of them trying to kill me for it.
---
use verified couriers
---
Or you’re doing it wrong.
---
Bethesda username, character names do not matter and are mostly for you so you know who is who
---
Get over it
---
Change wall from doorframe to window, place curtain, change wall back to doorframe.
---
Oh yeah I’m the same way, my friends a little different tho lmao so I don’t know what he was thinking.  It I just felt bad and wanted to see if I could stop the scammer before he did it to anyone else. Thanks for the advice
---
I definitely will be doing that in the future. Thanks for the advice
---
The campground is near the buildings. Creatures in the buildings don’t count.
---
I wish they would just allow any wallpaper skin for the ceiling. I really want to use the Gold wallpaper for my ceiling. It's ugly as fuck on my walls.
---
I can agree this does sound lame
---
I'm a edge lord and you all are picking animals over people. No wonder this world is screwed.
---
I would just want another radio station. I agree that there needs to be more framework for community events. We need to be able to make and give out quests. A text cat. Heck, I would love to be able to leave notes or something
---
It’s also been asked they fix all the bugs but you know give them more ideas for the atom shop
---
Np
---
Did you link your account to steam and if you're on steam, can you check [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) ?
---
Yes seriously I got a extremely good gaming PC(at least by my standards) for wastelanders and then they proceed to cook the render distance, I mean WTF why can  I only see shadows 20 meters in front of me when I have a gtx 1660ti with 6gb vram and a ryzen 5 3600. I built this pc just for this game dammit.
---
Or, a better idea, buff the assaultron head weapon to act the same way, as opposed to being a complete piece of garbage that fires a single shot instead of a sustained beam like they do.
---
Jesus Christ... and on top of that dailies &amp; weeklies no longer give atoms thanks to score. So they've effectively gotten rid of/severely crippled the few ways you could slowly accumulate even a modicum of atoms to spend.
---
Well shit...
---
Many Many ammo bags in Fort Defiance in the west wing.  No enemies except bugs over there.  While you are there, check the third floor rooms outside the elevator for asylum outfits, some of which are quite rare.  Stay out of the east wing unless you just want to fight for a bunch of nothing.
---
PC? Gamepass?
---
&gt;I just got this game as part of GamePass cause it sounded like a fun Battle Royale mode for my buddies and I to try, but this is garbage.
---
Does this account for my Hard Bargain perk card discount at vendors?
---
So far I have gone from 28 to almost 59 in NW. Getting as much of it done as I can while DXP is active.
---
read the other 200 posts on this sub that are exactly like this, search bar exists for a reason
---
The golf course is in the Savage Divide,  region where the recommended level is around 30-40. Try sticking yo the forest, ash heap and toxic valley (left side of the map) at the start and don't rush the main quest. There's plenty of stuff to do there so you can level up

---
You know with a computer, you can just leave your character on the menu of the computer and no one else can use it but you. I know this because people would ruin events this way.
---
I get that. It's not as good as a real garage door where it just doesn't open.
---
I convert caps into valuable things that have little weight. The other day I saw a cheap croc plan in a vendor and bought it and now I traded it for something else I need. Rare apparel is also a good one. If all else fails buy ammo or plans you don't have at whitesprings. I make sure I never get close to 30k caps by always spending my caps as they come in. When I have 10k - 15k ill go spend most of it. I don't need the caps for trades because anything I want can't be bought for caps. 
---
To people who wonder how to get so many caps well 1400 a day from the vendor obviously. I hit that easily just selling purified water from my water farm and excess stimpacks (which I get a lot from due to dailies and events. They seem to come from nowhere). You then obviously get caps from just doing daily quests/SBQ. That can be worth a good 500 - 1k caps in a day. That's 2k possibly even 2.5k a day just playing. Then I sell plans, weapons, ammo and armor in my vendor and make a good amount. Usually I make 5k - 10k caps a day there. I am not doing anything fancy like trying to sell serums or farm for anything to sell. I just sell what I pick up from legendary mobs/quests etc. The other thing I do is buy from other people's vendors and resell if they listed too cheap. This is why I can make so much from my vendor. For example, today I bought something for 7k and sold it for 15k. I also bought something for 500 and sold for 4k. Sometimes some people price things too cheaply and you can take advantage of that. I am not specifically looking for that per se, I am just going around to vendors to spend my caps and then see the opportunities. A warning though that those opportunities are rare in weapons, it's usually plans and apparel that are under priced.
---
yeah, everything being wet and having such a small drab color pallet is a little weird

You may want to include [this utility](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plunger_(Fallout_76\)).

I’ve got it in my vendor, same gamer tag as reddit name

Pretty much, the story is decent just make sure you have lots of caps, constant fast travelling to each end of the map

---
Everything being ultra shiny for no reason looks very awful and unnatural, you have to be blind to not notice this. Worst of all I think that Bethesda did not even acknowledge this issue.
---
Berry mentats help finding that mysterious enemy (as long as it's not a robot)

Yeah buddy. Don't sweat.

Gamepass is a service Microsoft offers. You pay around $10.95 AUD a month to have access to download and play 100’s of games.
---
I thought NW was Crossplay enabled?
---
It can’t be moved and it sits in your stored forever plus you can’t scrap it. It’s extremely upsetting to have it placed in a camp
---
I figured, but there was nothing else to clear
---
Wrong tho. They aknowledged it and said they will fix it in patch 21, with no consequences for who achieves it
---
It's good at what it's supposed to do, offer high defense against all damage types and provide damage mitigation.  If they made it any better people would have less of a reason to ever get out.  The only thing really PA needs is a fix for carry weight considering how far behind it is compared to the alternatives, if I ever wanted to go full time PA I'd need to ditch another 120lbs.
---
dont worry, i'd say good purchase
---
oh dope! where is it?
---
Hide in bushes. Best strategy there is.
---
All i need just some properly stacking foundation and iron post and i am good to go.
---
I must admit the terrain is the pain. But that applachia to you.
---
As I understand it (from playing since initial release, reading Reddit posts, etc.), and subject to correction by others:
---
The game landscape is divided into "cells," and whenever a player enters a cell that hasn't had any players in it for a long time, the server spawns enemy mobs for that cell based in part on the map — in general the mobs will get harder as you go further east and south, as in Fallout 4 — and in part *based on the level of that player*.
---
If you're in a part of the map where high level mobs *can* spawn, and a high-level player has entered the cell before you — perhaps one of the high-level teammates you were grouped with, if you were hunting together in addition to being joined on a public team — that would have triggered high-level enemies.
---
So: My advice is simply to keep playing, and return to an area more than once (or read up about it outside the game) before you conclude "this area is always too hard for me at my current level." It may indeed be too hard: If you're down southeast where the Scorchbeast Queen roams after a nuke shot, the mobs are likely to eat you alive. But many other places (e.g., The Whitespring) may not be *always* too hard for you — if you or another low-leveled player is the one to trigger the re-spawn!
---
got a 2* TSE handmade which i use since lvl 60, im lvl 140+ now, but purveyor gives only gives me broadsiders idc about
---
I have never seen this one pop up like other events, do you have to trigger it manually?
---
no no. i am goody one. i dont like fights in general.
---
It does! Each individual pellet explosion carry the Enforcer cripple chance. Even if you don't hit their legs, they can potentially carpet the ground they run on and they'll stagger and limp, or even better, fall over helpless in one shot.  
---
   
---
Be mindful that the splash damage also cripples you too if shot too close, so Adamantium Skeleton is recommended if you're worried about injuring yourself.
---
Oh my God, my friend did this to me. I thought I did something wrong.
---
I take this one alot as it's nice to have a spot near sting n' things, it's a pretty easy one for clearing but creatures can be hiding down the hill to the east and slightly out of the circle to the south, however creatures tend to congregate around the tents
---
Yes.
---
&gt;nothing is built on flat terrain here
---
&gt;
---
&gt;can't build on odd terrain in game

Aight that would make sense because I was the o ly player around when I first hit white spring. The next time I hopped in the world spawned me at that bar in the beginning and when I got invited to the team they were already at white spring so I figured why not. Thanks for the info. I'll head back northwest for now.

Cool OMW. I think I am actually out of caps

Mm I'll have to try that
---
You are in private. Its all good I need to log out anyway. I'll catch you later on I see you posting often. Thanks again.
---
Yeah. PC player here.
---
Edit: Is their Xbox version free of this issue? I don't have one, and would like to keep my Fallout's on PC in case they ever allow this game to be offline so we can mod it.
---
Are you on Xbox or did you sell them all
---
Known bug, no fix eta.
---
They recently added a random power armor workbench outside vault 96 on the pts. We also know daily ops will be kinda similar to vault raids, instanced interiors with rotating missions.
---
Public in 5 min
---
Didn't even consider that, yeah that would explain it. And the bug for the halloween/christmas rewards is still live so I bet everybody is grinding out for them
---
In your example you'd only get three coins, yeah. Currently each rank of a perk card is worth one coin each, but tbh Legendary Perks are still two months out so a lot can change.
---
They should also have some kind of paint for those that use the garage door or don't use walls
---
Using two brick wall doorways works as a charm, they just snap into each other. After that you can change them in whatever wall you want to use.
---
I shut her down. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
All good
---
I named my meat hook ‘Norbert Cleaverhook’
---
And with it being 2xp weekend, eat em like skittles
---
Hmm I ran all over in a big circle and gave up after a while, try again tomorrow
---
I did the same thing for my grandmother, got pretty mad that it didn't work, and just did it again through the game itself (launches a window that worked)
---
I'm not even sure if it's worth trying to get my money back. If what the other poster says is true, that's pretty dumb that it waits 2-3 days. I doubt it'll give me 2 months either. :-/
---
Both times used paypal.
---
Lol I got exploding railway gun for sale. 3 star I think.
---
I've seen this before. Some players kept reloading and jumping for no reason. In the end I became the overseer. 😂
---
Agreed, running silos is a absolute chore. shout out to all those who do it.
---
Mine has explosive, so I'm pretty sure that does all the damage
---
Event name "Rock'n Mole"
---
Subs are only auto fire, so use commando cards not rifleman
---
Raider Punk spawns around the map but can also always be found inside at Crater, down the stairs in the little cave network looking area. Similarly, Gramps (Settler Forager) can always be found in the interior of Foundation, down in the lower area near the pond. The only one who doesn't have a specific area where they can always be found is the wanderer (girl with the guitar), she can only be found via random spawn.
---
It's probably still in the code.
---
Buff their health debuff their Dam output.
---
But hey what do I know
---
I'm only new to fallout 76, but I decided to get that to max right away, god all mighty it helps
---
Thank you all for the answers!
---
It’s only like 15000 atoms to buy every rank of the whole battle pass. Thousands of people have already bought their way to the end.
---
It's cross platform so you can get it on Xbox and on pc
---
East wing has a ton of typewriters and desk fans and a few pairs of handcuffs for screws, and the straight jackets are worth 50 caps each with rank 3 Hard Bargain and Grape Mentats. You can get almost all of your daily 1400 caps if you grab all of them. It's obviously a lot less worthwhile when you've gotten far enough to always be close to the limit, but it's a great option for people that need the income.
---
Not OP but explosive bait was able to do that, not sure if they fixed that yet.
---
Depending on how many you have I’m interested as well
---
No need for that at all every one pulls out a Tesla and every one get a hit
---
Ahh thanks.
---
I honestly feel that if they got rid of the weapon ... No one would care
---
I think i was level 40 before I moved from the forest to the toxic valley and I found that it was the cells had high level people go there recently, so stuff spawned super high. It's also handy for exp if you can get it right, when you're geared up for it. If they're too high, maybe jump servers or come back in a little while.
---
I’ve had the auto complete bug hit me four times so far and none of the times the game crashed for me.
---
I got you. GT: KING0026 join party
---
(PC) do like I did I put mine in a room and put one of those garage roll up Gates on it  when I get to be like 27,000 caps I turn the power there is switches in the house you can always go to the enclave and buy Power Armor mods or serum plan and go broke instantly go to the Vault buy some Strangler armor or buy $6,000 worth of gold (300)
---
Four tickets so far for auto complete issues and one one automated response. No real person has tried to help me yet.
---
There is building techniques to construct your base on angle ground. You can use the poles in the staires section of the building interface to snap a foundation lower. 
---
1. Put down a fondation
---
2. Snap a pole on the side of it
---
3. You can snap another fontation on the tip of that pole.
---
Im pretty sure we got killed by the same guy ...

Faster you can get all of the "do this over time" content started, the better. There's a lot of content to the game but to enjoy it, you've gotta break up the grind with the actual game content. Also, teaming up with people, talking and goofing off is a large part of where the enjoyment can be had with it. Good luck!
---
It would still one-shot most things out of vats based on the damage it does before damage gets rubberbanded. Hopefully when they fix one bug they'll fix them both. Shotguns used to be a solid choice of weapon
---
If you intercept the hunters and have 8 charisma,  you can lie to them and tell them you killed him already and that they are supposed to give you the caps they got paid by Rocksy and they will give you 100 caps from each one. Make sure and do this before you catch the former raider. Also if you just talk to the former raider and suggest he go to Foundation you will get a little bit of Settlers rep. After all that go back to Rocksy and lie to her that Appalachia has a new corpse and you get a higher caps payout.
---
With the encrypted event, even if some one is one the computer if you get the right angle you can activate it and see the interface on your pip boy and still start the event... The fact that people know or don't know this is insane.
---
Yeah, I hate BR, but I have to say NW is probably the best iteration of it ive played. Probably because it doesnt seem so serious. There are no stats for people to fret over and it seems alot more casual.
---
Ore is the other thing to check for in misc, sometimes I forget and have 20lbs of ore built up
---
I love to explore well made trap bases. Dunno why people get so upset about them.
---
I never had it before but its been every event I've done for the last couple of weeks. I just assumed it's because I generally fast travel to a member of my public team who arrived at the event first.
---
Is it the one that has the bass between the houses that leads to a room with glow in the dark wallpaper and display cases of masks?
---
Follow the main quest and also do side quests until you hit a wall in terms of difficulty. Then settle in an area that you are comfortable with and level up to get better gear, and work on your build. I settled outside of Grafton and feasted on the Super Mutants there and the local events.
---
Skittles 
---
Asylum uniforms.
---
Roger Maxson, the founder of the Brotherhood, not Arthur.
---
Normally if your in area it auto adds you to event
---
I hate how daily quests are implemented in this game. 
---
Some only trigger when you go in the area, some trigger themselves, like "speak to sweetwater" when Im not in the area, and some are not even daily. Wish it would be easier to keep track of.
---
Every game has it in there TOS for something like this I would doubt you would get banned, though I’m not risking it on my account.
---
Doesn’t it produce ammo a lot fast than the raider one?
---
Unfortunately Bethesda likes banning players in the non competitive mode (regular old adventure) versus the actual PvP competitive mode (NW).
---
It’s a funny thing that they claim the game is competitive, but they let hackers roam freely in the only competitive mode (since survival was removed a good while ago). Yet they ban a ton of players because “exploiting bugs/glitches” (the dupe glitch that they let on for a week and probably half the players did) is not allowed since FO76 is apparently a “competitive MMO”.
---
If they want to ban players for doing something that isn’t actually cheating (it’s called exploit, completely different meaning than cheating unless you are one of those people who ignore meanings and would think a bunch of different words all mean the same thing) in a non competitive mode where duping doesn’t affect anyone else, then they should also be banning the players in NW for legitimately cheating (aka hackers). 
---
Another thing is AFK’ers, Bethesda seems to be all out on “you can’t do anything that wasn’t meant to be done like that”, if you play NW and you have an AFK on your team it’s an instant handicap (but it does mean it’s one less enemy to worry about). I’m not sure if using something/adding pressure to a key/analog stick to make your character spin in circles (sometimes they are in 3rd person view so it’s just their camera spinning) so you can’t get booted for afk’ing, is exploiting the fact that the game won’t boot you as long as you perform some sort of action. AFK players ruin NW, which is the only competitive mode as of right now, or trolls are also bad for obvious reasons. But hey, atleast someone who moves around + gets encounters with the enemy players is more useful than an afk who just wastes a player slot and dies without resistance/purpose.
---
Of course there’s not much to be done about hackers except for getting a clip + reporting it to Bugthesda, they’ll likely ignore it anyways but it’s the only thing you can do. I’ve also seen the ridiculous amounts of hackers of CoD Warzone. Hackers (aka actual cheaters) seem to be on the rise lately, probably because of COVID forcing a lot of people to stay home and find some source of entertainment. Not gonna lie, hacking sounds pretty cool (it gives me like secret agent/spy vibes, likely Russian) but at the same time it absolutely ruins everyone’s day if players hack a pvp/competitive game.
---
They better pay homage to Gwar, at least.
---
Raiders are wayyy more interesting, with a better cast of characters.
---
You can go to the workshop and blueprint it and than place it in your camp. Apparently it wastes your budget and you can’t get it back though, Not sure how much it uses.
---
Why is it such a heavy grind
---
This would be fine as long as we get a 'who the fuck are you?' option as well.
---
Yeah I’ve heard about that. Seems having something stuck in your budget would make it easier for Bethesda to target those people if they want to go that route.
---
With the S.C.O.R.E  challenges requiring some things to be done in NW getting some of the rewards is pretty unavoidable,  I can understand why they arent bothering if people achieve them
---
Completely agree. Having to scrap all your cards not only penalizes veteran players, but it completely defeats the purpose of the perk card system.
---
Ive suggested base it on  level 500. 500 being the point at which you max all 6 cards out. For most players 500 is a good long term goal. This would be retroactive of course.
---
To add to it i think they shoold keep the scrapping system/point system as a way speed up the process and clean up unused,or duplicate cards. So if you hit level 300 ( the point inwhich all 6 slots open) and have 200 extra cards/levels saved you could scrap them and have all 6 card maxed. Now you can continue to level, save cards that you like to swap in and out (ya know the whole point of the card system), or start to rank up some of the other legendary perk cards to swap in and out.
---
Am I the only one that ends up completing the challenges for the week in 2 hours or what? 
---
Also I'm at the point where I barely lvl up twice and I'm only rank 42?
---
have you just taken the serum because for the first hour after taking one, any negative effects are repressed
---
I was going to say this. Down the hill a bit there’s another little parking lot and resource sites. I’ve found some there. Also Try tapping vats while running around and maybe you’ll snag one.
---
There's already bonuses for playing solo, if you look through your charisma stats. There's bonuses for playing in a team. There are no alliances/guilds, but if they would be added, I doubt they would go "hmm better not have anything good about this feature! after all solo experiences gotta be great, too!"
---
I feel this should be a thing.
---
I stick to passive bush wookie unless I absolutely have to engage. Rank 35 with only 17 kills. I enjoy the hide and seek sneaky play.
---
Sure. Go make a post asking for that. This post is focused on playing with others and the potential for raids for large, organized groups.
---
Don't worry, you still get a monthly allowance if you're subscribed to Fallout 1st! Sign up now!
---
It’s a bit of fun, better than building a mansion with glitched out building capacity.
---
Well said mate. I honestly wish I could upvote more
---
I think Right outside of huntersville
---
Why do think the updates are always so huge despite not adding much? Just piles and piles of dead code
---
so you bought fallout 1st two times and didn't received it? where did u play?
---
Hey! This was longer than an hour ago... :(
---
Honestly this. Making, managing and helping out in guilds/alliances has always been some of the greatest fun for me in MMOs. I remember the days where I scoured the starting area of Guild Wars 2, helping out new players in exchange for asking them to join our guild and contribute from time to time. Built up a nice and cozy little community, that was probably one of the only reasons I came back to that game, despite having finished every aspect interesting to me the game had to offer. I seriously think this could be a huge lifesaver for Fallout 76.
---
I wish encrypted would go back to being a random event
---
After grinding like crazy all weekend, I've finally hit 230. Level 500 seems out of reach - unless i had a awesome motivator like this! I agree with you entirely on this.
---
I think it would be cool if (for example) rank 5 Makeshift Warrior could be increased/decreased at will to suit your loadout. Basically like having multiple cards but in a clean and user-friendly UI. I still think that not having a trading system for duplicate perk cards is a missed opportunity. Even with no added benefit, I could still see people trading like crazy to get a full set of animated perk cards. The same way people trade like crazy to get that Red Asylum Dress! No tangible benefit, but bragging rights and fulfilling that collector's compulsion!
---
What gets me is that if Bethesda actually banned them, I'd love to see them report it. If the hackers are winning in Nuclear Winter, and all it really gets you is cosmetics and I guess Adventure Mode XP, right? Then there's not really a "real world" advantage to hacking or cheating in NW. You can't sell any items on eBay, so it's all a personal benefit, or being a troll. If it's for their personal benefit, then ban their butts. 
---
That's $60 (or I guess $10 since it went on sale like two weeks after launch, right?) the hacker will have wasted, plus all the hours put in just to get a cosmetic for adventure mode. If they did that, I'd love to know how many peeps got banned, and if they log it, the average play time of each hacker to know how much of their gaming life they just lost. 
---
Either way, my buddies are done with this if this is routine. Hope they fix it. Seems like the adventure mode community is pretty fun, but the AI seems identical to FO4 and is somewhat predictable.
---
Spawn a little outside of an area so you can choose to stay or go.
---
Getting to a higher level and by extension having access to more perk cards is a must.
---
Best way to gain xp (if you struggle to net 10 kills a game) is survival, as kills and downs really don't compare to survival time during the match. Listen for the noise of the orange/best crates, the deep sonar sound, there's your best gear. Power armor is throwing stealth out of the window but if that's your play style, go for it. Populated areas don't necessarily have better drops. Check all the storage options, not just the 3 sized crates, most of your helpful stimpacks and chems might be found in a random cupboard or shelving unit. Stay with your squad, even if you suck, as obviously, two people are better than one. Get used to sorting your favourites menu real quickly. Everything you pick up should go into your favourites bar automatically so it's good to know where certain drugs are in that menu as a medx or using a super stimpack rather than diluted might be the difference in a fight.
---
Learn the weapons, fire rate, distance etc. 
---
If you like good loot, consider keeping lockpick/hacking ability. Good stuff comes from those. Nukes are amazing but you need 4 codes AND a breifcase. Hold onto a hazmat suit (if you don't have power armor) even if you have armor, so as to navigate a nuke zone.
---
Killing creatures is also good in certain scenarios because they drop things that don't appear in crates, like the Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
Set up your perk cards, find your playstyle, you're good.
---
That's about all I've got, and I understand that most of this is second nature to anyone who's played in a shooter before, but it's handy to be reminded. 👍
---
Will pocketed be misc?
---
Or just going round and lock picking at everyone’s camp
---
I agree but also we should just do away with the light, sturdy, heavy.
---
If I get combat armor I should then be able to modify it to be light, sturdy, heavy
---
They couldn't get it working soon enough to have it tested in the PTS. Somehow, nobody raised an eyebrow at that
---
I stopped picking it up. Its easier to whip up a suitable sized batch when needed. Im managing to keep a good stockpile of acid on hand so its been working ok and I dont have the inventory issues
---
Heh thats funny im sitting at like level 234. Kinda kn the same boat as you. 500 is probably a year off for me if i didcate my time to just my main. I play  about 2 hours a night max aftet i put my kid to bed.
---
I beleive Beth has mentioned making it so you can break ranked up perk cards down, along with adding a proper respec system. Those two things along are going to help out a ton.
---
Kolth! Good team plays we got! I agree. That or we should get radioactive storm clouds so if you go a certain height above any objects in-game, you get struck with a lightning bolt. Some of these pieces of crap are trying to imitate Floaters.
---
Double checked radar to ensure there are no enemies stuck in the side tunnels? This can happen alot in the first area and the event won't continue until all the enemies that spawned in die. Only time I've seen something like you're describing happen, but I'm on PC.
---
I’m usually a stealthy sniper/SMG build, power armory is more or less for looks and fun.
---
True, adding an extra layer of RNG is just stupid.
---
Don’t wear PA just get some lvl Anything unyielding.. even a full lvl 1 1* set of leather.. that gives you more carry and everything else.. Including XP. Talk about Trollage. You literally farm endgame content to mod PA and it’s worse than lvl 1 leather gear, tbh.
---
Yes, emotes are the one thing they need to get serious about. Not the bans, not time-limited events not working properly, not the continued rampant hacking in NW, not the 3* power armor and nuke miniguns that are still freely available for trade. It's the emotes we need to hunker down on
---
Each account costs money though, right? That would be an even better vicious cycle. If Bethesda banned their butts, and you could guarantee me they would create a new account (buy the game again)...
---
Papa Todd! I got an idea on how to sell more copies of Skyrim... -er- Fallout!
---
&gt;"You cannot place your CAMP near existing locations"
---
And yet I see people building almost just against Whitespring station or power substations, somehow the game doesn't mind that. Or just a set of stairs/foundation at a cliff with all the rest floating over it, for that matter.
---
Though a lot of NV assets can't be used because of licencing I think.
---
Honestly I don't think the creation engine could handle it
---
Nuka Dark counts as Nuka Cola and Alcohol. Drinking it will give you boost from both "Cola Nut" "Party Boy/Party Girl" perks. You'll have plus 6 STR. Which was pretty good buff during meat hook era. And it still is.
---
also makes them look grassy
---
(shakes shepards crook)
---
hmmm...
---
[edit: "Herd" showed ss an option but does nothing]
---
Also happened to me yesterday and today. Yesterday a guy named "RomanFall47" just hit me and my team killing us in seconds. Then the cam got to him... He was sitting under a house on the other side of the map, no weapons no armor and just punched in the air and killed one after the other. Had about 25 kills. 
---
Today a user called "ELF-76" (or something close)
---
He ONE SHOTTED every player. Not only that, he KNEW where everyone was. Again my team and I got killed in a blink of the eye. He had 20 kills and proceeds to track down players. I'm sure they where on his map or something like that. Even people who where hiding where easily found and one shotted. Obviously using cheats/exploits.
---
After the match ended the guy who was watching with me just said "Jeah, fucking cheater".
---
I mean... Why? Why bother playing pvp and winning by cheating? That's so dumb and I simply can't understand why.
---
Hmm true that, I never noticed!
---
they want you to subscribe to fallout 1st and pay monthly
---
They are busy banning their normal player base.
---
Hey look it's a scorchbeast!
---
*Brrrrrrtttt!*

Aaand it's down.

how about just a "Blank stare" vault boy emote

Same here!!! Super frustrating . . . I want the Nuka-Cola cooler!!!

Nah. Just use it or drop it.

---
Quick question. After the factions main quest, where I have to pick one, can I increase rep even after it is done. 
---
I am sitting on ending it and improving both factions rep with me.
---
That explains why someone bought all my bulk junk last night. I needed to clear some room so I threw it up going for something. Sold 100 in weight of stuff in 30 seconds
---
Yes only Fisto for "defense".
---
diseases are supposed to be permanent with plague walker but they seem to just expire like normal. i guess its a bug?
---
That's rad!! Lol!! Thanks much for that info, I was so concerned!! Lol!! My husband did NOT prepare me for that!! 🤣
---
Ugh...I hate this every time I need to make a fence in my camp...makes me want to rip out my hair.
---
Also semi related? I hate when plants clip through your camp...they despawn when you first place your camp but they come back after you log off...now I have plants in my living room :/
---
Pop a rad-x diluted or rad-x and call me in the morning
---
Well that and there was a legendary run challenge to buy or sell three times from player vendors. Problem was, buy a thousand bullets = one transaction. So I had to buy two more bullets of a caliber I don’t use for two more transactions.
---
triple check your legendaries to make sure you don't accidentally sell or scrip a legacy
---
You report then make sure they never match with you. I dealt with him before. Multiple reports then ban matches with them by blocking them.
---
I hope you never experience the loss of a pet. It hurt more than losing a family member or friend.
---
Anti-Armor Explosive pistols are pretty badass with the right perks, and they're so light you can mitigate the durability issues by carrying several of them. With Eagle Eye and Concentrated Fire and a good western revolver you can put in a lot of work at a pretty respectable range. You can max Gunslinger and still run Sneak + Covert Operative, and I've been having good luck staying hidden with a shrouded chameleon wood set. I'm also rocking an Instigating Explosive Black Powder pistol. It tends to draw more attention, but from stealth it delivers 3.5k headshots. That's a pretty good one to run with Gun Fu and Grim Reaper's Sprint. If you'd rather keep Mister Sandman + Escape Artist and lean more towards the stealth side you could also go with a suppressed 10mm for a sidearm. The best thing is that AGI/PER is a pretty versatile build for small arms, so whatever your loadout you can easily adjust on the fly without changing your SPECIAL. If you spec into pistols and find you don't like them you haven't borked yourself.
---
Can you put them in a display case. Just have a bullet section in your camp
---
Or fire with loud weapon like .44 type, they will show up when they hear the sound, same with mole miners always work.
---
Humans can communicate properly and know better. Pets are sweet and loving as you train them to be.
---
Ive lost family. Ive lost friends. Nothing hurt compared to losing a pet. They knew nothing but the love you gave them and they shared it back.
---
I understand. This just felt real.
---
I'm brand new! We're watching The Storyteller's lore videos as well; I will for sure check that out in particular! Thank you so much!
---
I always run away then sneak back and sucker punch them. SOMETIMES they are using the vender when I get back. It really makes my day
---
You know there has been many elders with the name Maxson right? all of them are descendants from the orhinal founder of the brotherhood Roger Maxson
---
Like the movie I Am Legend. I can watch a man kill a man. But watching a pet die. Bothers my soul.
---
This comment is hilarious, and I will be sure to do that along with popping a lime in a coconut! 😆🤪
---
Displays seem to have an exponential effect on overall camp space and I’m close to my limit. I’m sure if I deleted my turrets I’d have all sorts of space, but my camp is near a spawn space for scorched, and sometimes other things: super mutants, scorpions, Yao guais- even came home to a sheepsquatch ripping up my home. So I need my heavy laser and shotgun turrets.
---
I feel you. I can see a man kill a man. But to see a dog so innocently be lying there. Makes my heart hurt.
---
And you still have no idea what you are talking about because I didn't dupe anything. Not sure why you are trying to attack me now. I'm just pointing out that you don't understand what you are saying.
---
i will do it next time, thanks
---
Ha ha ha! Naw, just a bucket. I also include some stimpaks, common outfits, candy, like royal jelly taffy, some nuka cherry, and whatever else I feel like. Plans that are pretty common or easy. Like all the mounted heads.
---
No need to count the utility perks like hacker and lockpick. Make a build without them. Unfortunately you just have to swap in the cards when you need them. 
---
I wouldn't bother with strong back. Start managing your weight better now as it's waste of 4 points. 
---
You want 3 in concentrated fire. 
---
5 in ironclad. Aqualad is pointless late game as you'll have more radaway and rad-x than you need. 
---
A point in gun fu would be nice. 
---
remove pharma farma and scrounger add another point to luck and then get bloody mess. 15% extra damage yo.
---
BUT if you're gonna be sneaky shoot shoot you probably don't need the extra DR and you also want escape artist
---
since day one, man
---
I chase radstorms in game for pictures. Here a few I really liked.

Nah, it’s at Watoga HS. It’s an easy one to miss considering there isn’t much else going on down there beside the Queen. It’s actually a PVP event  but there’s only been a few times that someone else showed up for actual PVP to take place. Most people skip it just for that reason, or they just don’t know about the event.￼
---
Often their subscription paying player base
---
Nice to know me &amp; my friend aren't crazy
---
You new guys have made it more fun to play like there seems to be more people on a level playing field. Before game pass and the NW events it was literally cancer (still is on some matchups)  No one is amazing at NW, it’s so fucking dependant on RNG and shit. Well you sort of master scavenging, get a few perks and you’re all good!
---
Something they need to fix is the Godamn afkers that join teams -.-
---
5mm and 50cal give 180 with rank 2 ammosmith
---
A moped would definitely be a vehicle Fallout would use.
---
Red Rockets would also be super useful.
---
I fail to really understand the point of the weight limits. If it has to do with the servers then why can they support the scrap bins?
---
Normally I’d agree but, as there seems to be little rhyme or reason as to the order in which issues are addressed in this game, I don’t see any harm in just raising whatever problem whenever even though we still have issues like entire classes of broken weapons. For perspective, it took them over one and a half years to (kinda) fix the wall cabinet glitching into the ceiling. I mean, I know that’s not a big bug, but *damn.*
---
My dude,
---
THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!!
---
Also, kinda funny . . . I was taking pictures when it happened haha!! Oh, man, I was like, "Is this a plot development?! Is something happening to the world?!?!!" 🤣
---
Was he running around in lower earth orbit firing?
---
I'm the only one who thinks that the grind is not THAT big? The problem is that it is repetitive, as there is only 4 dailies to do and only 2 of them rotate.
---
I have the Black Rider on my T-65
---
Thank you Bethesda for making my earlier, time limited grind to get said survivor rewards pointless by reintroducing them. As a much easier grind, no less. You ham-fisted hoopleheads.
---
Dude, I didnt even get the extra challenges! My brother and I both got 4 total challenges each of the last 2 days. 3/4 of my 4 total were also fucking auto completed.

This happened day after I bought first for the second month. Guess they figured they could get me to use those atoms for the ranks they fucked me outta.
---
Amen
---
Yup. That Elf-76 fucker I reported as well. Guess we'll see in a couple of months what happens. Would be nice if they managed this game as if it were a live service...
---
CASUAL 🤨? *bleeds in Ghillie*
---
I think you need to move to a better neighborhood 😂
---
That's the thing though for OP to know. The block / block for session doesn't do diddly squat. My guess is because, at least in the past, no one plays NW so they have no other lobbies to queue these hackers up with.
---
Thank you. Taking pictures of things in game is fun. I imagine my character is a wildlife photographers since coming out of the vault. 
---
I also like documenting when mobs and such glitch in game. And awesome camps. Me and my husband play together, and we always have to stop by every camp and check it out, and rate it. 
---
Making your own fun, is part of the fun of the game for us.
---
😂
---
Spectacular storytelling. I wish I'd been there.👍
---
I agree. I think there is a lot more they can do. They have done a lot.
---
QUICK DUDE,i need you'r help!Im trying to find to tf asked.
---
Was a sight to behold. I'd really love to get our guys' footage of it as he captured everything 30 seconds before the kill, and the rest of our match too. If you're out there my very *tactical* friend, we'd love to sing your songs.
---
I think they should make all the hackers match up with each other. Then they quit because it's "Unfair".
---
Or because they're not HD assets, code sure but assets would need remodelling and a lot if time.
---
I’m glad you agree!
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
I figured keeping the hacking and lockpicking cards active would be a quality of life improvement, but more points in concentrated fire would certainly be an improvement. 
---
As it works for me now I start the fights with my sniper rifle but often get overrun by enemies and need to switch to a combat rifle when enemies get to close so I figured damage reduction would be good, but maybe it becomes less of a problem when I get my build in order and improve my gear.
---
YES, to all of this!! I felt really inspired by Bethesda's article about ZeroFoxFK, too; did you see it? I'm VERY new to the game (and to video games as a whole), but I already have my husband taking a lot more pictures in-game, too!!
---
I'm not sure how to share pictures I've taken, but I got what I feel is a hilarious one of a glitch where a Blood Eagle got their hand stuck in a metal structure (like a makeshift riot wall or something) after I killed them lol . . .  I "get" you, fam!!
---
What you have Alzheimers.
---
Its not totally obvious how to solo queue and I was one of the people you mention until I noticed the option to change it, so for anyone who doesn't know, when you mouse over/select NW but before you actually queue, there will be an option for team fill on/off, it is on by default. You need to turn it off to solo queue.
---
I play on Xbox so I'll never see these levels of cheating hilarity, but will live vicariously through you, my friend.
---
792 words. That should be enough for an unban! Go for it.
---
Didn't think I'd posted that lol if you have him and find him in wild again he really funny with you.
---
I would if my team either A) used mic’s or B) actually helped in anyway.
---
I mean you can't hide from a grenade Launcher in non urban areas. 
---
I'm not the only one claiming explosives are OP in Nuclear Winter. Some of my friends who actually play it say so as well and as you see you are the only one claiming there are not OP in this thread. 
---
You can double their splash damage radius and increase damage with perks.
---
 I mean if someone dosent has the frog legs it's easy since just running up to the enemy is the perfect counter, but if they jump arround all the time it's hard to hit them, they don't got this issue since the splash damage.
---
I've tried this many times, and every time someone eventually comes and sees literally a dozen helpless ghouls crawling around and rather than think "hmm, maybe someone left them alive for a reason" they just start killing them all. I figured I could easily solo One Violent Night this way, once I had enough ghouls down I could play an instrument in peace. But as soon as I have enough down to maybe make it possible in runs Big Bad Power Armor Man. So anyway, he starts blasting and I just shake my head and thumbs down. Eventually enough people came that we completed the event anyway, but I just dunno. I guess XP is more important. Which is fine, it wasn't a big deal. But seriously.
---
You even strengthened my comment, lmao.
---
Oh no, they respond to me, with a copy paste about challenges auto completing "early" but still giving the score. Then I send them
---
And they REPEAT THE SAME COPY PASTE MESSAGE.
---
Does it look like my score auto completed?
---
Some very impatient people. They could save so much money by just waiting until the last week lol. I am already ahead of the guy we are supposed to be chasing having done no NW events. I did every daily and weekly except the NW ones (and I didn't get any auto complete bugs) plus obviously the repeatable. I went really hard on the repeatable with canned stew, building team, lunch boxes and purposeful exp grind though.
---
He's not visiting. Remember that lorewise this game is a proxy, and it won't actually feature anybody we know from previous games.
---
Yeah. It's a pain swapping cards in. Evasive in agility also adds DR if you need more. 
---
Also at least 1 in friendly fire in charisma so you can heal NPCs with a shishkebab. And strange in numbers to share in a party if nobody else is. Also Squad Maneuvers if someone is sharing that.
---
I was able to get the helm painted to the liberty prime
---
you can swap as much as you want with no consequences
---
&gt; ZeroFoxFK
---
I did. To share pictures in this reddit, you need some site like imgur. I saw a bloodeagle recently like that too, on the road to Flatwood from the Wayward. 
---
Here's a ghoul at Whitesprings that was glitched frozen but while on fire. The pose was great so it was perfect photo op. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/dr3xyp1
---
The best tip I can give you is this. Don't fast travel all over the place, all of the time. Run there. You many never know what you discover along the way. Some of the best fights and encounters in the game happen that way.
---
When you encounter a group of ghouls, and think, take them out, but a group of Supermutants show up, and all the noise attracts the attention of a scorchedbeast. 
---
When me and my friends were wee wastelanders, in our 20s, everytime we encounteres a scorchedbeast, we had to run, and look for cover. It was great. All huddled in a little building, waiting for it to leave. 
---
Good times.
---
You can swap them out as much as you like with no issues to their story lines if they have any.
---
He isn't in any previous games
---
The log cabin prefab has it's own concrete foundation so I've found that far easier to place than anything else so far.
---
It’s at the campsite south of the National Radio research center, around a junk pile below the ridge. Usually there’s just one scorched that takes pock shots. Other spawns don’t happen very often, and I think mostly special events trigger them.
---
It’s a good central location, plus it’s one of the locations visited on the main quest line, so I get a lot of visitors, which is my goal. Sometimes I do artillery strikes in the parking lot of the NRRC just to scare some quest participants.
---
Signs and letters (open sign and non letters) can be found at sutton or pleasant valley train stations, Phoenix vendor bot in watoga market, or BoS and Raider vendors at white spring. The cheapest you can buy it for is 8750 caps with 18 charisma. (Use grape mentats egghead serum, roleplay event group strange in numbers to help max out)
---
Same...I usually only manage about 50 but last night for the first time there was someone else running too and we got the full 100..miss out on the xp from killing everything but I try to tag the legendaries I pass so I get something out of it
---
That's a pre-emptive action, a player can still buy from your vending machines even if they're not powered, the only thing powering a vending machine does is advertise it on the map, so if I'm at 20k and somebody shows up and buy my 5k legendary, then starts buying scrip bin legendaries for 800 each, it quickly gets out of control and can't be stopped without logging off.
---
It's annoying as hell.
---
Vending machines are still interactable if they're offline, so if someone is already buying stuff you can't stop it in any way other than logging off, I'd have to stay near a vendor just waiting to liquidate any caps I make as soon as I get it and that's not possible for regular play, you can't conjure up a vendor to spend caps on out of nowhere
---
Huh, I might have to wander down and have a look, thanks!
---
Yeah it gave my bloodied gauss shotgun from 2183 to 2600 damage it's crazy
---
“Appears?”
---
Proof or stop posting crap like this.
---
I actually don't mind teammates. I just have them and try to carry them trough the match, One in Three games is even a win most of the time.
---
It works, why hasn't it been patched?
---
If there's already someone buying from my vending machine I can't stop them from continuously buying my stuff even if the machine was to be powered off as all that does is advertise it on the map, and I can't reasonably be near a trader at all time to buy stuff as someone is buying stuff from me, I'd have to basically be within seconds of a vendor any time someone is anywhere near my vending machine ,not a realistic or enjoyable situation. And not a possible one if you just go out and play the game.
---
id love to use the alien blaster one day wothout feeling like im firing a BB gun
---
“I’m a unicorn.”
---
See, I can make baseless assertions too without evidence.
---
Are you saying the event isn’t in the game yet or the colossus isn’t ?
---
This happened to me, as well. I told Beckett to talk to Frankie and went through the whole dialogue between them. I get back to the camp and Beckett says he has news about Frankie. Ronny is burying him. I went from 😎to 😣 wttff? Did something happen while I was heading back to camp? Frankie lost it again and they had to kill him in self defense? But then I remembered, Bethesda.
---
Problem is when that happens in seconds, if I'm in the middle of project paradise, encryptid or scorched earth and a server hopper checks my vendor and start buying scrip weapons and a few 3-4 k weapons, all it takes is 10 seconds to go from 20k to max and wasted caps, I can't possibly warp out in time if / when that happens.
---
Nice! It must be interesting to have both main quests to follow at the same time, and people to care about. When we started, we already knew that everyone was dead. Todd spoiled it at E3.
---
There are tactics.
---
If you don't shoot her she lands. If you don't stand on top of fences and tents and are stood in the clear she lands.
---
Awarding rewards based on damage dealt is a bad idea as it would mean more people killing her in seconds. BUT yes. A 3\* should be guaranteed.
---
Yeah it’s extremely ridiculous that after 2 years our only endgame fight is still the SBQ. Which requires no teamwork or tactics. It’s just “unload a hail of bullets” everytime she lands. It’d be amazing if they had a leaderboard during the event that showed how much damage the top 3 people have done or something. But that would never work in this buggy game. The numbers would be all f***ed up.
---
It was already fixer... I guess
---
Yeah, I guess not many people know that there’s an event to go to that is PVP wether you have pacifist enabled or not. It’s a three round event, I’m sure you’ve seen the Monster Mash mask, just didn’t know what it was from possibly. And to add to the chaos if somebody does show up to engage in PVP, lvl 62 charred feral ghouls spawn in groups of 3 and are attracted to the person wearing the mask. Needless to say the few times I did actually PVP, the ghouls become a pain in the ass. Lol. In a 4 or 5 hour session, i’ll probably go to monster mash 3 or 4 times. The fact that I walked out of there with nine legendary’s one time keeps me going back every time I see it. But there have been times I have gone and gotten one legendary.
---
Most of the land is not flat. Bethesda obviously didnt think about it.
---
Heck, even without the legendaries it sounds like a tone of fun!  Must remember to dump my junk though!
---
The B2525 Fixer!
---
the group actually had to fight the robots cause they got a update about the renovations and saw everyone who was there as a "freeloader". After that the technician was able to stop the lockdown a few years later. The reason we cant get a room is cause the robots are waiting for the inspector. 
---
You can see the remains of the group in the dumpsters out back.
---
If you don’t min max your gear or perks it is quite challenging if you solo her or with a group. The spawns will be difficult to deal with. The fight originally is supposed to be fought while in the nuke.
---
Optimizing perks and gear trivializes her due to the fact the queen is built in such such a way so casual people who have average gear have a chance to kill her while not dying in a single hit.
---
If the SBQ was built for the people who only min maxed then there would be a lot of people screaming for a nerf due to the average player not being that great of a player.
---
Please note that this boss has been out since the game released. It’s not surprising that she just feels like any other monster at this point.  
---
The SBQ at game release was a pain to kill when everyone was new.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty cool. It’s personally my favorite event. Even over a queen. I know the layout of the high school with my eyes closed. LOL. It would actually be an amazing small/medium Slayer game type map
---
Is he not?
---
They didn't survive the robots onslaught, their remains are out back in the dumpsters
---
Encryptid, project paradise, and in a way rad rumble are all endgame events too.
---
Awesome.  You’ve completely sold me!
---
I didn't but I think that the foundation isn't as good as they like to make out...there's been too many times ward has sent me of to get something from the raiders acting like it's urgent and it's the only one and turns out they have like 6 and never used them but someone in the raiders camp really needs it
---
And if you are at the event by yourself just farming and somebody shows up and grabs the mask, it notifies you that so-and-so has picked up the mask so you know you’re not alone. Because of that notification, I always thought that you couldn’t be in PVP unless you were wearing the mask, I was wrong the very first time I did PVP there. LOL I waved at a guy when he showed up and waved him over to a three star...Then he killed me
---
I've managed to have some fun with it, but the building system in this game (due to server restrictions?) is a step down from F4. Way, way down. Shouldn't it be *better*?
---
thsnkd
---
Wait, I thought taking peoples resources just meant you got a copy of them... It actually takes it from them? Cos I definitely stole like 30 purified waters from some guys camp... Then again he was like level 180 or something so I don't feel bad cos I'm a noob lol
---
Fantastic!  Sounds like it could be quite chaotic in a good way!
---
Hopefully you’ve completed that quest to pacify the robots in Watoga...Sometimes there are still robots in the high school when it starts. GL man
---
yes she is a terrible boss with trash rewards, but if you shoot her once as soon as she spawns and stand in an open area, she will land immediately then you can whack her with a group, can be done before she regens health.
---
so u r actually saying that when ur father/mother (whoever from ur familly) past away it didnt hurt so much as when u lost ur pet? I never tried to compare this things. From one side is natural from another I just dont want to see it happening. I leave u with ur choices.
---
No, Roger Maxson the founder of the brotherhood has been mentioned in the other games only, in fallout 76 we get holotapes with his voice for the first time. In the holotape "The nuclear option" he mentions how every one wants to shut out the world and become isolated but he doesn't, what's interesting is that his kid says they should become isolated, This is probably why John Maxson in fallout 1 (the grandson of Roger Maxson) Is leading an isolationist group. 
---
The Roger Maxson in Fallout 4 is a 20 something year old descendant of the OG Roger Maxson
---
Thanks you. I probably should have added that info myself since it is indeed easy to overlook the option.
---
There is a ton of flat ground area's around the map, there are a ton a beautiful, and cool, locations around the map.  The problem is we feel like these locations are not choices because we feel like we have to keep our camps at the pre determined resource deposit locations so we can set up extractors.
---
Here's an idea... Instead of having us feel pressured to restrict our camp location choices to where resource deposits are... Maybe they should have had the collectron stations/robots we have exist as something we could program to search for whatever one specific resource we want most at the time (make collectron stations work the same way as resource deposits/extractors, except choose on the terminal what resource you want)
---
This way, you can choose to place your camp anywhere on the map you want (lots of flat ground spots in every region) and STILL have resource collection of what you want without worrying about those stupid resource deposit locations (alot of which were awful pathetic uneven/rocky ground making good camp builds hard) anymore.
---
I agree with all this points, I've been meaning to make a post like this myself.
---
As well as the SAM turrets, we should have had the option to build AA machine guns. Sort of make fisure site prime like a public work shop that we can all build turrets and defended in on a temporary basis.
---
Also, the orbital strike beacons should have been much more effective against here, a variation on explosive bait to get her to land, a syringe mod that would paralyze her.
---
Loads they could have done.
---
Unfortunately, if they gave a countdown on the public notice, people wouldn't show up until after the last minute.
---
Wait... you can pacify the robots in Watoga?!
---
Can you tell us what you think would be an encounter that is more tactic based?
---
You really like to take words literally. You must be a literal jarl.
---
1000 atom challenge? I think you may have confused SCORE with atoms, that sounds like the weekly Legendary Run challenges.
---
They’re looking for Excavator, not Ultracite.
---
The biggest problem is that the large prefabs, especially the ones on concrete bases like the caboose, don't want to clip into the ground. They also don't have snap points for stairs or foundations, which is even worse.
---
 Mayor for a day. When you go there do they attack you?
---
Or a means to aline an object to a surface like Elder Scrolls Online can!
---
What?
---
Yeah it's the responder not I'm pretty sure!
---
And coming up we've got a Colossal Problem as another SBQ Type boss fight.
---
Do they ever!  I’ll look into the Mayor for a day quest.
---
It's probably a trap to see who's daft enough to go for it again.
---
Yeah I used to avoid that area like the plague. Until somebody told me about that quest
---
"They're not tactics" K
---
It is hit or miss with the traveling leather coat.
---
Haha, can understand that!
---
1. How do you know it still works?
---
2. How are you going to enjoy you time once you're banned for proving it still works?
---
 Lol
---
Your grace?
---
Nukejockey's right, even on PC the event's known to have this issue, myself included can vouch it's happened to me. Sometimes when the Caravan freezes up it's because an enemy that should've come out from one of those side tunnels has become stuck or it's path-finding Just hasn't allowed it to come get you, so you'd need typically to go get them yourself before you can continue.
---
Dear Bethesda,  
---
Please nerf paper.  
---
Yours sincerely,  
---
Rock
---
This is why displayed items shouldn’t be part of your storage.
---
You've lost me
---
People refuse to accept this, and will give endless reasons and anecdotal evidence that standing on fences and tents makes no difference. 
---
I've been to dozens of SBQ fights recently and when the nuke zone includes the bunker, with the fight in the open maybe near the grove SBQ lands frequently with droves of adds. 
---
With a dozen or more power armor dudes perched on fences and tents, although fun to watch the pretty lights from all the energy weapons she just hovers for ages with no adds.
---
Why do power armor wearers hide up on fences and tents, I thought it was powerful?
---
I remember those days, running from those pesky winged annoyances. Haha
---
Yes. Go to social while in the main menu and click invite to team while your friend is also on the main menu.
---
After that the leader has to start nuclear winter. He can decide to auto fill team or go in with just you 2.
---
You were never here
---
So they’re supposed to stick around? Even if you hit up the mineral water fountain at Whitespring?
---
Ok yeah thanks
---
the best price you can get buying with hard bargain/max charisma is still  going to be more than I sell for
---
There are no hackers on consoles
---
Ok thanks.
---
And do the rest of the team need to start NW as well? Or will they auto join when the leader finds a game?
---
The auto team fill should have defaulted to off then on. I hate it when bush wookies run around like headless chickens when they join your team especially when you get 3 bush wookies.
---
Nice try.. I fell for one of these before... the old "Excuse me Sir does this rag smell like chloroform" trick... Fool me once, shame in you. Fool me twice and its prob cuz I like da butt sex.
---
&gt;Something they need to fix is the Godamn afkers that join teams -.-
---
I sometimes forget to press \[R\] to disable joining a team.  It would be better with a dialog box popup, two separate boxes for joining NW teams or solo, or even just as simple as changing the default from teams to solo.  If they wanted to deal with this issue that's literally all they would have to do.  Clearly this is just yet another thing to add to the vast mountain of "things Bethesda apparently couldnt possibly give less of a shit about".
---
tactic
---
/ˈtaktɪk/
---
noun
---
plural noun: tactics
---
an action or strategy carefully planned to achieve a specific end.
---
**Action**. Not standing on a fence and not shooting queenie in the air
---
**Strategy**: Standing on open ground so she lands so you can shoot her in the face
---
**Specific end**. 1\* nocturnal rolling pin
---
You don't have to fight the queen. Nobody is forcing you.
---
Yeah, that grind was... phew. I’ll never forget that horrid, sinking nausea on realizing that there was a rank between Friendly and Allied. Not to mention that it’s literally 50% of the faction rep from Neighborly to Allied.
---
Definitely glad it’s over, but really regret standing by “no exploit” gameplay on it. Do yourself a favor and use the Rocksy dialogue trick, if you’re able and willing. There is no “high road” here, just pointless timegating like some F2P mobile game to drive up “active” players.
---
Yup. It’s a pain but totally worth the 750 gold.
---
They auto join.
---
I’ve never used rifles, except for the one I carry just to pick off enemies I can’t reach. But equip one rifleman card and check the damage for your weapon, and then equip commando card instead and check your damage again. I’m guessing they will be different numbers
---
Yeah like the Atom store right 😂.. I’ve been left to 3v1 or whatever too many times to have any sympathy though. It’s like tagging legendaries on Adventure mode. One legendary I miss I just whack my shotgun out and literally steal every mob there.
---
The comments below are correct. If high level players were in the area previously, then spawns will be matched to their higher levels. Bethesda plans to change this in their Fall update I think, so that no matter what level you are, the enemy you see will be matched to you accordingly. Supposedly after this update, even low levels won't be limited to just one part of the map and can travel freely to other areas that were notoriously known for being the 5th ring of Hell for low levels. Trust me... I stayed in the Forest area until level 50... for good reason! ;)
---
Apparently, that doesn't stop them. I heard the new Piper trench coat is low-res. I don't have it, so I don't know for sure.
---
I run Chemist bag to free up 3 strength. So I can run all 3 heavy gunners, Blocker, and Barbarian. Then I have Thru Hiker on. late game you end up with so many stimpacks and food. those reduction perks are a must.
---
Rotate it around so it's opposite you
---
Oh jeez, alright thank you
---
Great, I thought there must have been a way. I see other groups all working together, wiping the floor with everyone else and guessed the were all friends or something.
---
They really need to improve the matchmaking on NW, it's not obvious to me that you can start your own squad.
---
about 2 weeks ago someone launched a nuke as i was about to go offline so i was like 'Why not!' I get there and there's 4 peeps in PA wielding big guns. There's a couple of tents but they're all stood on open ground.Queen starts flying around. Nobody is shooting. All of us just watch her and turn to keep an eye on her. And then she lands and we unleash hell. Her health goes down loads. As soon as she leaves the ground everyone stops. 10 seconds later she lands again. Same result. And she takes off again. 10-20 seconds later she lands again. Lots of PEW PEW PEW! A few minutes later she's dead in no time. Not a single shot fired while she was in the air. Probably the smoothest queen fight i've ever had.
---
I use it to generate 5mm for my Gatling gun. Makes 1000 rounds every 5 hours or so. Another plus is that it doesn’t require power.
---
As a new player as well: don't underestimate your C.A.M.P. turrets. I got pretty bold around level 20, and built my camp behind the Whitesprings cottages, where most level 40-60 enemies spawn. Whenever I logged on a new server, I took a quick trip to the cottages, aggro'd all the scorched there, and ran back to my camp for my turrets to kill them. Good experience for not-so-much effort
---
Ive had my collection of various "junk" items go -POOF- becuase theres no location check for CAMPS before entering a world. Everytime I have to switch entering a server, the game eats all the teddybears in my stash.
---
For the take a workshop challenge, Hemlock Holes only has four low level ghouls... it takes me as long as it takes the timer to countdown +10 seconds to take that workshop. If you’re just wanting to do it for the challenge, it’s quick and easy. Are you doing it for an achievement or are you doing it for a daily challenge?
---
Yeah I was hoping to get shit tones off 5.56 from it. But no power requirements is a huge plus
---
Sounds so sweet, I well coordinated team. Never seen this, just a constant barrage at a flying bat. Sigh 🙄
---
I dont think emotes should be atom bought. Especially for PC players with limited communication. Console vault dwellers are able to private message individuals. We rely almost  Interely on emotes. 
---
There needs to be an enormous amount of emotes, and all should be free.
---
Or impliment type to chat.
---
Report his ass and attach video
---
You can stack overdrive with any if the psycho chems, also drink a hefe or a bock to really up the damage. Here and bock don't work on heavy guns though, but seeing how your using the gauss shotgun, bock should work for it.
---
Yes I am just now making report to Bethesda.
---
I hope they eventually put in more that create that feeling even when your high level
---
Please NO to SAM turrets, they glitch constantly and cause massive lag, and that's just one, I can't imagine if there were several in the area. For me it would be unplayable.
---
I also would like high radiation fluids and hardened mass to be junk PLEASEEEEE
---
Its pretty slow at making some ammo types, but 5.56 isn't one of them.  Makes 200 in about an hour.
---
You know you can also one shot someone with an explosive weapon while jumping really high
---
I was about to make a post on this topic. such bs! Heres a cool skin you can't fckn use.
---
The question I am posing is how can we, the players, make the game better.
---
Basically assuming Bethesda won’t implement any of the things you suggested, how could we as players try to make the game more enjoyable and fill the gaps they have left.
---
not that permanent =] they go away if you take antibiotics too
---
OK. I don’t use that mutation, I was just thinking that would be horrible if they were completely permanent
---
I don't think Bethesda care really at this point or are able to overhaul the copy pasted code from SkyRim. The SBQ if a fun (sometimes) diversion, but the game now is all about new content and cosmetics in the Atom store.

do you run a bloodied melee build? because as far as i know, psychobuff gives you extra health and therefore you arent in nerdrage anymore thats probably why youre damage was lower
---
SAM turrets would kill the SBQ fight for me unless someone makes a mod for *The Nexus* to remove all the broken lagging effects.
---
Actually if you drop power armor, it’s a suit of power armor. Not a bag
---
Thanks! Seems rather manageable as well.
---
I wonder if they only spawn in events then.
---
I'm stealth build too and I'm attracted to the Cult of Mothman faction too.... too bad they always wanted to shoot me when they see me..... is there any quest where i can make faction with the Mothman Cult? Now I'm with the Settler. 🙁
---
It’s still on until Monday 12:00pm EST
---
I like the turrets idea. A player has to man them. Maybe they are harpoon guns with tethers to help force the Queen to land until she shakes them free,
---
So that’s a good idea. And the mobs that attack, they attack the turrets and they need to be repaired if they are useable again. So a few players would have to protect them when waves of scorched attack. 
---
Maybe the scorch queen can cause smaller fissures to open with her sonic attack, and hot liquid radioactive ultra cite spews out causing area damage. So players have to retreat or be blasted.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s still going on for 1 more day.
---
Sometimes at a scorched earth you'll have 6 or 7 people shooting and 6 or 7 not shooting. And often most of the shooters will stop when they realise others aren't.
---
this is why shes killed right after landing with "magic" weapon and people still complain they didnt get that sickle. You just saved 10mins of your life, be happy about it  😁
---
not just gunpowder but also all those weird crafting based items like ores and such 
---
and before anyone says well that is just another fallout 1st thing - look I don't care if it fits in a stash box or not I just want to realize I have it - after playing since the beta I have so many random things in my misc I can't get rid of it takes me 15-20mins to scan through my misc folder to find something I actually have 241 of a quest card that apparently keeps getting added to my inv every time I finish the quest
---
There is today to get in on it
---
Thank God I’m not the only one who does that. When she flies off to turn around and start attacking, I run away from everybody to try and get her to target me
---
You said there were no tactics. I told you what the tactics were. You couldn't handle the truth. 
---
Go back to standing on a fence and waste all your ammo.
---
There is a prefix called quad it makes the clip size of the normal gun 4x larger but their is a glitch where you can have a bunch of bullets on any weapon but idk how to do it
---
(drops pieces of power armor?)

---
Yes it is permanent with starched genes. I can sell you one. Send me a DM for gamer tag.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
+ super duper.
---
I wish that worked for xbox. In 4 we could use the bumper buttons to zoom it out but it doesn't work for me in this game.
---
oh sorry didnt bother to check :D
---
anyways it screwed me over the first time i used it too 😅
---
agreed. I have the Atomic paint on it now, but would prefer to run Nukashine.
---
Ok
---
How does this machine work? Is it like the ones around the vendor stations?
---
There's already ***a*** bonus for playing solo.  One which is pretty much equalled by using Empath/Class Freak.  Meanwhile, teams get public team bonuses, free fast travel points, perk sharing, team-focused mutations, and ELEVEN perks that benefit team play in some way.
---
I get that they want to promote team play and that's cool but it's gone so far that solo players join teams anyway to get these bonuses, and now "teams" aren't really teams half the time.  I'm OK with it really but if they buffed Lone Wanderer or added more like it I wouldn't call it a bad idea.

"I mean you can't hide from a grenade Launcher in non urban areas. "
---
that is a very vague and generalized statement that I not sure I would even agree with, but again its like saying you cannot stop a sniper if you are in an open field and saying there for it is OP.
---
"
---
I'm not the only one claiming explosives are OP in Nuclear Winter. Some of my friends who actually play it say so as well and as you see you are the only one claiming there are not OP in this thread. "
---
this a fallacy, it holds no water for me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum 
---
I also do not say they were not OP, I said there were other things I would put high on the too strong list before them.
---
"You can double their splash damage radius and increase damage with perks."
---
I can also make my Handmades ignore lots of armor, do more damage, reload faster and handle better.
---
"I mean if someone dosent has the frog legs it's easy since just running up to the enemy is the perfect counter, but if they jump arround all the time it's hard to hit them, they don't got this issue since the splash damage."
---
Is this not more about fog legs being OP then? Which it is, as it is by far more powerful then any other card.
---
Looks like a party.
---
Illusious requiem!
---
Bush wookies?
---
Agreed! This had been me before and I'm now mortified. Won't make that mistake again and I'm really sorry to those whom I *helpfully* started it for too 🤦
---
Because power armour go brrrr
---
Shit fam. Didn't know you get extra rep for that. Thankyouuu
---
To be honest I found it easier to find the plan for the gun you need it for and craft and scrap them until you get the mods you want.
---
Or just place your PA on the other side of the boxes and get in it to skip that entire part.
---
Ally is max rank. I love the machine. Whenever I go back to camp I pick up 400-1000 5mm. Hardly ever need to craft for my junkies Gatling. 
---
You basically set a terminal to make one type of ammo and it slowly generates it. You can lock it like a water purifier or collectron as well.
---
They should really just add a tool that let's you landscape a certain amount of area. Maybe not for workshops but definitely camps at least.
---
swarm of cargobots waiting for flight plans to be updated.
---
There is a stage with speakers etc outside the Purveyors building. they could play there.
---
I'd totally power it up. Then play some Chilled cow down the mic.
---
Spark up and roam.
---
Run into the fire and stim your way through it to avoid the blast. Normally leaves you and the bomber and the map tells you where they are when it launches.
---
Yeah choose that dialogue and you'll get a little rep boost. You can also exploit it by choosing the dialogue and backing out the conversation quickly and you will keep getting the rep. Wouldn't recommend that with the ban wave though. 
---
Problem is, sometimes you'll go to the target and they'll already be dead cos some enemy on the map where they are has killed them and the only dialogue when you get back is "[lie] Appalachia has a new corpse" - you won't get the extra rep.
---
Did you enjoy the rewards or the grind? If yes then it's not pointless afterall. If you didn't enjoy either part then it's completely pointless regardless of what Bethesda does. 
---
I grinded them before too but I see no reason why newer players shouldn't have the same oppertunity.
---
"Here their be monsters!" Great Skyrim Mod!
---
But you get it for sleeping in any bed, not for boinking your robot, correct?
---
You must be near Point Pleasant? Currently it is just cosmetic background visuals. 
---
They have talked about areas outside of west virgins and it seems like going over the river is the best option for that. 
---
So maybe it’ll be part of the Brotherhood. Maybe something down the road.
---
Nah I won't exploit. I don't mind the grind. 300 hours in. And I'm still learning!
---
The most fun I have in NW is when I'm watching 2 teams fight each other only a few meters away from me without either of them noticing me in a bush! 
---
I've reached the end so many times only to have my bush given away by the scorchbeast screams :(
---
The fight is a mess alright, for me it’s a laggy horrible mess. It’s so bad that I cannot tell if I need healing or radaway as my bars can’t keep up with the actual action. Maybe other people don’t have the same issues (XB1) but I know my teammate does so I’m not alone. I’ve learned to compensate for the jerky motion and uncertain damage and useless vats but I think adding SAMs or missiles will simply crash the game for me and I can barely keep on track with smacking her in the face much less pinpointing armor spots. 
---
I’m not sure what the solution would be but I’m a nay for SAMs. Even Line in the Sand gets janky at the end there.
---
This is the best guess.  All they'd have to do is make sold items unavailable to purchase from a vendor (though, that would cause angst when someone spam-sells guns and accidentally sells a legendary).
---
Thanks myself I already did them all a year ago.
---
That is fun especially when they crawl around. One clean shot and done. 😂
---
Awesome you legend 😁👍
---
I have a merchant character that I kick alot of my loot to so my main characters are light and nimble. So you won't see my high level guy have a full store.
---
players who hide in bushes either to attempt to ambush, or to survive as long as possible.
---
I was busy building while somebody was using my vendor, They purchased all my 80% discounted meds and left me a paperbag with plans for jetpacks for 3 different power armour sets. Luckily I saw the bag when I finished building, but never got to thank the unknown wanderer.
---
Hope you're having fun! I also enjoy the grind!
---
I'll tell you in a month ,when i'll get there without atoms or god mode.
---
There's an INT perk that really cuts back on fusion core drain, I switch it in when I get low on cores and it really helps.  And the energy ammo weight reduction perk also applies to cores.
---
the heavy set looks the best imo.
---
tbh I don't care for the ghillie skins.  They serve as a gear 'lock' from accidentally vending/scripting said gears though. Same goes for weapon skins.
---
One wall use 2 as budget but yeah this is what I do aswell
---
I run speed demon, Marcupial and healing factor. The first two are obvious top mentions in any build. I enjoy healing factor despite the drag on food and water because I love that instant full heal after you clear a room. Twisted muscles is common on melee builds so I believe.
---
In scaling difficulty, the areas go Forest - Toxic Valley - Ash Heap - Mire - Cranberry bog.
---
The savage divide (middle strip) is a bit of a wild card, because it can spawn both high and low level enemies, depending on which players are there
---
I can see some benefit to this
---
It takes 5-7 min as fastest
---
Only grind I hate is having to wait for my scrip to reset.
---
Trying for all those modules for SS armor Unyielding rolls is doing my nut.
---
Well that sucks! Just so we’re not missing anything, you have at least one vendor with power and with at least one item for sale and it doesn’t show the V-Circle around your camp on the map?
---
Did you submit a ticket?
---
Okay... this is probably common knowledge to senior NW-players so feel free to point at me and laugh at my noobishnes but... what the heck is a Bush-Wooki ? I assume those are players who are just hiding in bushes to grind out as much play-time-exp as possible ?
---
I think captainoob's one still works as well, you should give that a shot
---
E: Imagine being downvoted for an anti-dupe video, sad
---
or just have premade buildings not have foundations and snap to a standard foundation
---
it was a plain shotgun in my case.
---
and once the shots were fired, it reversed back to 2 shots per reload.
---
screw sentry bot I'm getting a mr gutsy with that damn machine gun
---
You can run to get underneath her when she finishes circling and she will land. I have been in so many arguments on this strategy I don't want to get in another. You either know how to land her or you don't. People need to learn her moveset or put up with her not landing. I have said enough.
---
This happens to me literally every time there is a cool event. I hate that it's only a couple days long instead of 7 days long.
---
Doubtful. It’s a rarity to dupe pistols because hardly anyone uses them.
---
Hmmm that glitched might’ve happened to you them it also happened to me I had 300+ bullets in a clip on my handemade idk how to do it but what people told me it’s sorta common in pvp since people abuse it there
---
Thank you very much
---
Welcome to adulthood, where play is something that fills the increasingly small cracks between obligations and responsibilities.
---
Yeah, last time I did SBQ was on a lvl 18 alt instead of main. Just tagging her watching them fail. Was honestly funny, couldnt stop laughing irl.
---
25 min of good entertainment.
---
Don't think I have ever seen suppressor plans.  You learn suppressor mods by scrapping the weapon you want the suppressor for.
---
They’re not really endgame events in my eyes. Yes, they’re more difficult to complete unless you have a full team that knows what to do. But they don’t require you to spend around 30 minutes launching a nuke to start. They just randomly pop up. Except Encryptid of course. But even that event can be completed in like 5 minutes or less if you have competent players doing it that don’t just shoot at it while it’s shields are up.
---
As far as I know you have to scrap untill you unlock suppressors? What do you play on and what gun? I might be able to help
---
It's just annoying I have every other model you can get in the game except for the one I actually need 🤣
---
I basically only want this and the handmade skin from the season....great.
---
just a deathclaw skin in general would be nice. So I can 'lock' it down. No accidental vendor/script etc.
---
Except that they can get accounts for free or nearly free in many places.
---
oh okay. thank you
---
holy mother of free nuclear keycards
---
Elaborate on the ‘build’ you can make that allows you to kill people who have Pacifist enabled, that exists outside of Wanted/Workshops and doesn’t use a glitch... that **also** allows the target to press ‘Seek Revenge’ after death.
---
Well I have a very low level hunting rifle and I just got s new one that's a higher level so I wanted the suppressor on that, and I play on xbox one
---
Yeah, once you do that Mayor for a Day quest, walking through the robots in the streets of Watoga is like walking through the robots on the shopping level of White Springs resort.  They do not bother you at all.  I totally agree with GnarKole, the quest turns Watoga from "avoid at all costs", to "please come and visit".  :)
---
Yup. They sit there in bushes even if you got downed like 1 foot from them from them even from taking falling damage. 
---
These guys care little for others and on in it for them selves.
---
And Wastelanders made it even worse. 
---
I swear they went on YouTube and searched up "popular camp locations" and built something at everyone of them. Since Wastelanders, almost every single piece of flat land has something already built there
---
I can throw one on there for you. Are you on tight now or gonna be on later?
---
Get the Astronaut’s mission, do the thing and knock Athena off on the side when she comes a’calling...😉
---
Yes, displaying anything in your CAMP is buggy as hell.  Suggestion: accept that it doesn't work and pretend this was never part of the game.  Decorate with the decorative items you can build via the workshop menu.  Stop beating your head against a brick wall trying to do something the game doesn't really support (even if it was meant to).  If they fix it in the future, then go nuts.
---
Yeah I'm on right  now
---
Why would Sarah Lyons be in Appalachia 148 years before she was born?
---
25 for encounters. To get to Ally you
---
Need 12 000, good hunt.

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations
---
They were people who left Appalachia. They returned.
---
There is lore as to why they came back. They left because the area was just way to dangerous a place to reside in. 
---
There are other reasons but you can find out yourself.
---
Put her in the rocket/nuka girl outfit.
---
Some. Others are new to the area.
---
Pc game pass like you. I bought it on their (microsoft) website first and when it didn't give me FO 1st I bought it through the game (it's in the corner of the main menu) and that worked immediately.
---
Yes I paid twice :/
---
Alright, I'll hop on here in just a minute. GT: Jss125
---
The tiles are awful, awkward placement of stairs not included. The standalone bits like the train, garage, seem really cool until you try to place them. My wife has the garage, managed to get foundation perfectly lined up, apparently wasted an entire day doing it. I told her it looked good and she quit the game and hasn't spoken to me since last night.
---
Seriously, Bethesda. You're causing marital problems.
---
Kind of a let down to grind so hard for something and then feel you were given a reward that feels unfinished. I wonder, is anyone at Bethesda playing this for fun anymore? I'm paying for a FO1 sub (two in fact) that advertised frequent, unique swag. Last drop was a skin that makes you look like the losing team at paintball, it feels like an Atom shop reject. I just don't get it.
---
Hope Bethesda takes note of your post, well written and good points.
---
Hmmm, you’ll actually make it? I won’t, I’m only on level 34 lol
---
I want this:

They have always assembled there above the road out of Point Pleasant. I’ve heard various theories for the last year+ including the one I believe - that this is the placeholder for outgoing cargobots. I’ve also heard that the more of them you see, the longer that particular server has been running since its last maintenance.
---
Check your stored items second from the left. There are probably 2 turrets sitting there.
---
If you’re doing melee, you can use one of each consumable. Pychotats, melee or unarmed bobblehead, glowing meat steak and a nukashine for unarmed or other alcohol with the party boy perk card equipped and you will do unbelievable damage for 3 minutes. More than enough time to kill anything in the game.
---
I mean I clearly do or ip bans wouldn't be a thing, so think again before you continue, ip bans are real **everywhere**  not excluding America, can even detect the use of a vpn and still block you from whatever you're trying to get past
---
Scrap the weapons is the best way to unlock mods.
---
I miss the time when Athena gave me extra caps for my services. 🤤
---
Not that I'm aware of.  Head scratcher, for sure
---
Yeah i'm almost at 60. Maybe a little bit more than 1 month,because it gets harder later,but I should have no problems.
---
I don’t even care about finishing it really. I’m not really into cosmetics. The only things I like are some of the weapon camos. If I was gonna blow 15000 atoms I’d rather just buy a boatload of repair kits lol.
---
Just got a set si wanted to know
---
There is lore... talk to the people. A lot of them will tell you their stories
---
Wait, you have to redeploy the camp to use this kind of skin?
---
What about the same workshop if I come back in a few days could I claim the workshop and put those same ones down
---
Yup for me personally hackers on PC games is one of the reasons why i prefer consoles for gaming.
---
the little plot is told by the two young ladies when you literally just fall off the first stairs after exiting the vault: there are rumors about a treasure, buried somewhere in appalachia and two fractions came, to get it, the settlers and the raiders.   
---
also, there are people, acting like they have been here forever, the responders lady in the church of flatwood for example.
---
I play xbox exclusively and have never seen a hacker in NW.
---
Ha, I got the name wrong, corrected now... Alexa, Siri, Athena... so many I forget... hehehe...
---
PS4
---
They are. I did mine yesterday afternoon in about 20 minutes, finishing up with the NW one so I could get stuck with a team that wasn’t on mic and scooped up all the weapons from every crate before I got there and ran off when we encountered another team... so that part only took me about three minutes...
---
No, but why do you want to store them? Workshops have their own materials you can use to build so you don’t need to use your own inventory up. When you are in build mode if the materials are green, you are using workshop materials. If they are white, it’s coming out of your inventory/stash
---
Actually, i literally just unlocked one 🤣 thanks tho I appreciate it
---
Grab a calculator and get to work? It's written and they can only be earned once.
---
How is not being able to travel to your camp beneficial?
---
There is a ghillie skin for marine, it is on the Legendary Run.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ghillie\_paint](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ghillie_paint) the Marine armor version is unlocked through the Legendary Run (Season 1)
---
There is the ghillie one in the season reward,but these ghillie skins don't work in NW.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Other MMOs have limited stash size to sell extra space.  A revenue generator.  I sometimes wonder if that were in the plans for F76 at some point.
---
From my testing yes.
---
Yes,quite a kick in the nuts for those of us with long lasting camps.
---
The Settlers were the original inhabitants who returned to the area when it was declares 'safe', but they were beaten by the Raiders who set up camp and claimed the area as their own, hence the mistrust between the two. Blood Eagles are an independent Raider group who are less well organised and split in to smaller camps. Responders are the remnants of the immediate postwar survivors who unsuccessfully attempted to help people and restore order.
---
And Cultists are Crazies...
---
And the BOS were a single outpost who got wiped out. 
---
And the US Army survivors are scattered and now ineffective.
---
Thanks. Then I do not care this skin :)
---
Heard that there’s a discord that has a group of them there. Don’t know it’s name, but I know there’s around 15 of them there. 
---
Word of mouth though. I know a few names... But it isn’t like Bethesda will do jackshit. Most of them left once PVP griefing went out the window.
---
So that just leaves the ludicrously leveled nuclear winter ones who have no business being the level they are, and aimbot all night.
---
Uranium Fever.  My second mule has been only level 35 for a while, and I have been meaning to go back and get her up to 50, so she can pick up and use anything in the game.  Yesterday afternoon I finally decided to work on that, and got her from 35 to 50 in a few hours, with only a few basic buffs (mostly just Cranberry Relish and Brain Fungus Soup, but I also had two extra Leader Bobbleheads she used for two of those hours).  She was just using newly hand-crafted weapons and armor that my main crafted for her, every ten levels.  Once she hit level 40, when Uranium Fever would pop, she would go in there and go up a full level just from the event and killing every Mole Miner inside the tunnels, in addition to the main event ones.  I am just a casual player on the private servers who did not pay any attention to how many actual XP that amounted to, but I would say it is worth testing for your list.
---
Yeah mine is an everlasting one. Then I skip this skin.
---
Currently the meta is Stealth boys and Tesla rifles. at-least until update 21 or 22
---
Oh I didn’t know that this is my first time messing with workshops
---
Well, the benefits stack, so I would say yes.
---
FO4 was my first introduction and was the reason I fell in love with the franchise.
---
There are 4 different factions you can join and I restarted 4 times to play all 4.
---
Tesla? You mean the 'Why learn how to aim™'?
---
Staging area.
---
Some people tell you where they are from.
---
Some came down from Pennsylvania, others from the Capitol Wasteland.
---
It’s definitely geared toward 5.56. 
---
5 rounds per 1.44 minutes is the fastest production speed for all of the ammo types, and fills up in an hour.
---
I kill the legendaries before they leave the Chambers, just to stop the people being useless dont get them.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance
---
If you don’t see in stored, next time you place them down... might seem silly but put a small rug down first then place turret on top. It’s always helped mine from disappearing after being blown up... hope that helps you..
---
The Settlers came from elsewhere (they did a stop-over at the Pitt), the Raiders were here originally - the ones who bugged out before the Scorched Plague killed everyone.
---
I have a glitched unremovable foundation+stair i need to get rid of. Was waiting for this skin to do it and rebuild my camp as it is with little tweaks here and there. Now I think i'll need to wait for a patch....of a skin goddamit!
---
May I ask what does AA means as a Prefix?
---
Each piece generates its own proc chance. 
---
Think if it like scratch-off tickets. Imagine I’m going to give you some for free. You may have up to five. How many would you like?
---
Dude Beth knows about this and they been trying to fix it for awhile now. They know about the bug. They even said it’s a pretty hard bug to tackle because it has many layers to it.
---
Yep. I spent 3 days moving my camp around trying to find a place to put my garage and diner. No flat ground beside the road anywhere. 
---
I had another requirement in that the road has to continue northeast of where I placed the camp so I could give my visitors a good landing spot.
---
I finally found a place that works but even then I had to put concrete foundations in front of my structure to match the road at one place and make a raised parking lot/driveway into the garage.  I am not 100% happy but it works for now.  I got some good compliments about my camp yesterday.
---
It’s been taking awhile for me lately. I thought it was my internet being funky
---
Also I can’t click anywhere or minimize until it loads if I remember right
---
Ah well then ..
---
It’s an old wives tale. Come on man
---
In Walls tab
---
The solution is to place it, then step back and grab it again. You’ll have full visual mobility if you do that.
---
There are tent platforms made of wood in places like the rocky Maine coast, which allows you to pitch a tent where there’s no flat ground. I build my tents on wooden platforms and just imagine it’s like that.
---
Wow I def need that
---
Id rather die
---
Yeah I've paid for it in the Atom shop, hopefully it's just Bethesda being Bethesda and its there when I finished work! Cheers
---
Trolling.  Half the country loves to troll the left, so its not like its unusual behavior.
---
Glad to hear it! You're very welcome! :)
---
That doesn’t quite work. Some Atom Challenges only appear *after* you’ve completed others. 
---
Granted, it would be a good start for this player to  look at what is showing now.  And I’m curious as to why they are asking.
---
Would pay 500 atoms for a paper bag over her head...And a ball gag for both her and the collectron.
---
The camp building sorely needs a massive update, I wish they would hurry up
---
it should be. the garage sliding door is in the wall's section of the build menu, on its own not with the other garage doors. The side door is in the usual door's section of the build menu.
---
No. You lose everything on log out or if someone takes over
---
That other side of the river is my homeland.  If it becomes infested with BoS I will personally lead raids to expel them.
---
No problem. There are a lot of things that aren’t explained all that great in this game. 
---
If you plan on playing nuclear winter you can build up a mobile defensive building in a workshop, blueprint it, and plop it down wherever you want in that game mode (provided it doesn’t have any turrets). Only mentioning because I’m in NW right now.
---
You killed 4 people he’s a duper banned
---
I haven't experienced that bug as I've only just started the game, but the constant lag and movement stutters are infuriating.
---
And thank you for the Silver! You've just given me my first ever Reddit Award! :')
---
May you never take an arrow to your knee, fellow Wastelander!
---
I’m stealth build but not bloodied, I’m an Old School gamer and it is hard for me to buy into the low health aspect. Whenever I get half health I usually spam the stimpak button. Will try it next time but guess I have to look out for some serums
---
If they made it like a workshop location to be captured would be even more interesting.
---
Link?
---
Of course, I reversed the origins because there are actually 2 distinct sets of Settlers - pre and post-Wastelanders.
---
Pre-WL were either wiped out or relocated due to the scorched. 
---
Post-WL were the 'invaders'. 
---
But silly of Beth to use the same name for 2 different sets of people, especially as the Pre-WL Settlers overlap with the post-WL Raiders.
---
Exact same thing happening to me. I used to play on PS4 and recently moved to pc with game pass, and I’ve noticed most of the posts about this issue seem to be from steam users so I wonder if it’s an issue only affecting players on third party launchers. Definitely frustrating because I’m already starting from scratch by migrating platforms.
---
You know what has a ton of flat ground with beautiful mountain scenery all around? The Mojave.
---
Come on bethedsa, we already have story ties to the west, and we can build vertibirds in workshops, just let me fly somewhere, sheesh.
---
Interesting I have a bloodied railway prime rifle that I use for SBQ. How much you selling for?
---
I got the BOS Knight paint twice yesterday turning in Technical Data.

Are they also near roads or train tracks?  Because placing my little red rocket garage in the middle of the wilderness isn't exactly how it works in real life.
---
try just putting a camp fire on flat ground. Virtually impossible.
---
If modding does happen, it will only happen on Private Servers. They have stated this previously
---
That's your job to scrap it down before storing it.
---
Free weekend = tons of cheaters playing who can cheat without risking losing money they spent on the game.
---
Cause I'm old and grumpy. Get off my lawn
---
It's not as easy as you think give them time and be like anyone else and fucking deal with it. Yes it's shit but it's just what it is and they ARE working on it
---
Kevduit is a true hero
---
Maxson won't be here. It's a expeditionary party that's on the way to Appalachia
---
I'm fed up with the game starting and I can instantly run around, fight stuff, die, respawn...
---
But got forbid if I want to use a workbench, do any cooking, or use my d-pad to change weapons, any of which bring the game to a screeching halt 2 or 3 minutes after I expect it to be usable.
---
If its not loaded then please just don't let me load in to deathly slow menus when I could be doing other stuff.
---
Well the challenges for killing X amount of scorched/robots with X type of weapon are repeatable but the amount of kill ls needed go up so it s technically unlimited
---
Need to start doing that event again to get my scrip up
---
I got this at the end of the fight with one in sugar grove (which is a bullshit place to randomly go from lvl 20 mobs to a level 46 assaultron btw) I just assumed it was part of their combat. Lets be honest the entire thing is bullshit anyway
---
RNGesus heard your prayers my friend
---
Duper hacker cheater ban him abagsja!!1!!
---
I wish more vendors read these posts. I have a big chunk of my stash space filled with plans. When I find a vendor with reasonable prices (both legendary and regular items) I always try and drop stuff for them. Usually plans, but I might try cores and other items for lower levels.
---
I found the garage door from the wall/door menus but still no structure. I'm hoping it's there later tonight, thanks
---
Ahhhh that makes sense. I just reached lvl 50 on my main so I'm just starting to participate in the tough events. I'll keep that in mind!
---
I know right and it was literally one or 2 at a time because of the way pvp works now so idk why they were trying
---
The fact that settlers had A SINGLE faction quest is pathetic. This DLC was delayed almost half a year and they couldn't add or patch in another quest that requires something other than fetching the same item every day
---
I must burn for my heresy!
---
Lol They probably thought they could do something since they had more people but never thought that some weapons are better than others
---
Careful, they don't like criticism
---
walls tab, should be directly under the normal garage door that requires power
---
I don't think Bethesda reports do much btw 
---
So many genuine cheaters and hackers don't get perma banned, so
---
These n*ggas hard af but i beat my last one easy during rara mission by running circles around an object they chase you then black powder pistol  vats (im super noob lvl 25 first playthrough btw) rinse repeat gave me school flashbacks of running in circles lol
---
I totally forget you disappear from the map when crouching. Good tip.
---
I am the same except add in swim/bike/run training, but my wife says I am addicted to the game but what would she rather me do?  I just say, yes I am!
---
They hang around for about 2 hours of server time then if not claimed they will disappear. Also they are auto wiped when the server is reset which happens occasionally. You'd have to rebuild new ones.
---
Exactly
---
I did the same thing the that time I did the event. Thankfully there were already a good many people there but I feel bad in hindsight.
---
Being a conformist like you is destroying videogames industry.
---
None, With assassin i can't carry all my stuff. Unyielding for the win
---
No it's not. There are usually 3 tiers and that's it. Totally not repeatable.
---
Lol welcome to West Virginia. We face the same issues with actual buildings and expansion to our cities. Not enough flat ground to go around.
---
Ever since? This bug is like a year old soon lol. There are more important issues where vats does not work and also adrenaline card. Fix those first because they have direct impact on the gameplay
---
We have It's A Trap (which is sadly bugged) but could you imagine a scenario where you can repair a lure, it forces her to land, it dies in one hit (but she lands) and the repair items you have to scrounge (maybe she scatters the parts).
---
Or maybe its multistep. 
---
There could be 4 ways you can cause her to land. A trap lure (it's a trap), a single SAM, a sonic generator (ie line in the sand). a giant lure weed meat cannon. They can be at different locations as well. SAM at the forward base, sonic at bunker, etc.
---
Depending on which you repair, you get different spawns. Amount varies by order (last is most).
---
They always know about the bugs but they don't care enough to fix them. They rather make new and greedy ways to make us pay real money with the atom shop or buying SCORE levels, so yeah, they know about it, so what?
---
I found that as soon as encrypted start, half the server is there within 1 minute.
---
the other half likes to fuck and eat kids...fair trade #pizzagate
---
Nobody cant teavel there. You neither. So get off your own lawn :)
---
needs to be a PSA sticky..
---
No, still not a fan
---
Same junkyard also has a junk deposit. You can can farm black titanium and screws passively while you hunt for desk fans, typewriters, pretty much all kids toys, silver lockets and globes (can’t think of more off the top of my head)
---
Bolton Greens has a good amount of those items and only has level 6 scorched roaming around.
---
Oh?
---
Well said
---
fair point, can't wait for the Kansas DLC
---
thats how the skies in the middle east look like
---
Prefabs need to use the wallpaper and floor system too
---
Exactly,  the alien blaster is incredibly powerful in fallout lore. In the modern fallouts (4&amp;76) it is wayyy too underpowered and needs a huge buff. If Bethesda made a endgame quest around it, making it difficult but rewarding to obtain, I think the community would appreciate it.
---
Yep, when I put stuff in the recycle bin )IRL) I think of scrapping it to make ammo.
---
I drop decent stuff to nice people a lot, why not help out and make someones day.
---
You gots to squat on the computer in game so no one can start it
---
Sit on the terminal
---
Here's a very simple tactic idea. Make vats freaking work! When I target the SBQ wings they should get crippled. Then the damn thing can't fly right?
---
Agreed
---
You'll have to clarify. Is that the one that:
---
Doesn't activate at all? 
---
Activates but then immediately closes the window so fast you can't even read the message? (the most common, but certainly not the only one I've experienced) 
---
Counts down a few seconds and then closes?
---
Counts down to zero and takes several more seconds to go to the splash screen and perform the actual jump?
---
Or finally...the one that works beautifully, except it lands you way off from the normal fast travel point despite the area being clear - occurs so often in SBQ fights where instead of the normal landing near the bunker entrance I instead arrive the other side of the fissure far in to the nuke zone.
---
Thanks for the mut 😁👍
---
Backpack.
---
Wow looks like an opportunity for a lot of nuke key cards!
---
 * Bethesda employee *
---
Oh ok nuclear winter hackers very cool
---
* scrolls past *
---
yeah i dont even care if its a niche weapon but there should be some potential for it and i also agree with the laser weapons
---
i tried a few times but atm theres no way to make laserweapons a good choice except for some bugs
---
Formula p and It stacks. Use 8 formulas P and turn your Gatling plasma into a sniper
---
Sorry for the delay
---
Forget pvp
---
Its brutaly unbalanced.
---
Either you get one shoted or you one shot them.
---
Theres no skill involved at all. Plus with all the duping (if you dont dupe or buy dupet items) everyone has stroger weapons than you.
---
Outstanding, thank you!
---
The middle levels 25 to 35 ish are a weird place to be, your to I've leveled for forest ash heap but savage divide kicks your arse try persevere or get a mutant legendary and hit up mutant spawn points and level up that way after you hit 40 it a lot easier
---
Do you have a chemist or grocer mod on your backpack? The backpack comes off in PA. If I take my chemist backpack off I go from 300 to like 550 because of the 90% reduction it gives
---
How.
---
They did with the Caption Cosmo Outfit too then it was on the atom shop couple weeks ago.
---
2 minutes to get into the control room for me
---
Oh ok I thought it wasn't limited thanks.
---
Jenny from that 1 cartoon
---
Only it’s been shown by data miners that the scorched beasts and queen are not code copied from Skyrim.
---
Happened to me before. The tunnel never opened and the enemies were stuck behind the walls. No way to kill them.
---
Were you wearing some sort of legendary armor with weight reduce effects?
---
That shit drives me insane
---
Yeah same. I meant about 7 min in total. Lol launch prep should go way faster than it does 😂
---
My new thing is to buy up a bunch of the low levels stock so they get caps then drop the stuff I bought in their camp so they can resell.
---
Nope but they are emissive. Don’t spend more then 100 caps on it tho because thousands are on every server
---
All of the above :) Funny guy but accurate.
---
Oh damn I forgot that mine had the chemist mod on it yikes
---
I know about them, but here we are talking about how worse this concrete bug is getting. This game is a complete mess.
---
If your gear offers any weight reduction, that is lost when you get into pa. And you loose your back pack. 
---
I can carry more in my PA. But everything I have on me weighs much more.
---
So does the fast travel bug, hardly more important ..
---
I thought you just picked your skin from the atom shop, that's how I did mine before when I switched to the settler skin...
---
Oh my god thank you I had no idea that was the problem since I forgot about the mod on the backback, sorry to waste time :(
---
they have stated that an "I'm Sorry" emote is coming, so that's a good thing
---
So you already know the complete bug, no need for explanations here.
---
###### Just make sure to pay it forward
---
Yes! Yes take the game down to fix one thing! Because I hate pressing buttons more than i need to in an activity that is nothing but pushing buttons and pulling triggers!!
---
Me neither.
---
I gives me the creeps just thinking about rebuilding my house (had to do that about 4-5 times because it never lets me place my stored house.) Thats why im not moving again XD
---
I thought you just replace the camp in the build mode.
---
This post is inspired by AngryTurtles live stream last night
---
You think this is bad, turn all the settings down to low and you’ll see bad. I can’t believe that is even allowed into the game, it’s really pathetic development
---
They made a endgame quest for us to get it technically but it dropped under-leveled for most of us.
---
Selling us broken uncomplete games piece by piece (patches and updates, also patches if they decide to patch anything), selling worthless overpriced skins and DLCs... come on, use common sense here. Is economy basics, not wasting my time explaining that. Be a smart customer and get what you deserve, don't open your ass to greedy companies or they will keep in that way.
---
It should have been part of the build. You shouldn’t have to add a door...ugh
---
Not really worse. It is just back to the previous state. It was almost good but last few weeks brought it to where it was a year ago
---
I was just complaining about this last night as I was building up a new camp. What’s the point of having a damn pre-made foundation if it just sticks awkwardly out of the ground? As nice as they are, the pre-made foundations are a major pain in the ass to work with, but then again a lot of building related stuff in this game is a pain in the ass to work with lol
---
Honestly imo I think they would have done better just opening up more pre-made world space for players to build in since there’s a lot of structures in the world that already look really awesome to build up
---
If someone is using a terminal, another player can still access it through their Pip-Boy. I don’t know if it’s all terminals, but I’ve definitely done it.
---
Trave bug only affects you travelling, whereas the other two impact you dps and and one of the main game features. So totally not the even close
---
Yeah mine was the same way, I didn't have any regular armor in my inventory but others pointed out it was the chemists backpack mod I forgot I used so my 200 pounds of stimpacks and radaways confused me
---
The only reason for the request for flat ground is for the complete lack of flexibility in building on uneven ground. 
---
Even the gentlest of slopes ends up meaning your house is facing towards the slope or you've got some floating stairs with no way to get in if your house is more than 2 blocks deep
---
Bethesda plz indeed
---
So infuriating
---
I have full unyielding and mine is nowhere near that, what's your build like?
---
Yes it’s probably you. A lot of people think their system is perfect and it’s not.
---
I’m on PS4. Read a thread about upgrading the hard drive. Talked to my computer energizer friend, and said absolutely upgrading the hard drive would make all my gaming run smoother and faster. Told him what I read for ones to buy. Said those are great choices. 
---
He came over and did all the install for me. My loading screens are just a few seconds. My play is much better and smoother. And I hardly ever crash. It’s happened once in the 5 weeks since then.
---
It’s not always the games fault. There’s a lot of other things going on.
---
For sure my fake plays slower at certain times because those are very high internet times were I live.
---
I prefer the original .... More junk for the trunk. Cracks me up every time. Just got the raider and he quite funny too.
---
Same issue probably
---
1.this has nothing to do with economic basics 
---
2.bethesda have fixed all the major problems eventually.
---
3.They have never sold us dlc only cosmetics and the scrap kits which can be unlocked by in-game methods
---
4.patches and updates are GOOD they mean Bethesda is trying, they told us they were trying to fix this one but that it was a deep an complex problem
---
5.I do complain about things but not issues that are being addressed.
---
Grow up
---
Maybe with 50 or more int (and all of the above)
---
The actual camp logo doesn’t even show correct? I read a post about a guy freaking out yesterday. He was in his camp standing there looking at it but he wasn’t on the map, no icon. Basically if you look at the map you’re not on it to fast travel to?
---
Bethesda's PR department thanks you for your service.
---
AngryTurtle was getting 4000xp per enemy, he has a recent video he shows you how. Food + Teams + Lunchboxes + Egghead + Perks etc. He even got 6000 for an event completion which surprised him
---
Oh, don't get me wrong. I like the other models and they are all cool, but the fasnact one is just so magical to me. He's like a robotic bundle of Christmas cheer to me.
---
no sorry it ended up being the chemists backback mod i forgot about it
---
good analogy...my lottery luck is pretty on par with my RNG luck :(
---
Not relevant to the question OP asked. And with proper inventory management and avoiding a hoarder mentality you can do just fine without a 30 Strength.
---
That'd become the most used emote ever
---
Whaaaa I’ve never seen that. But duly noted 
---
outliers aside most fallout players are pretty low information tbh so I doubt they know - think of how many people never hear about the sulfur fountain at whitesprings 
---
I’ve squatted in the Encryptid terminal a metric ton as I try to launch it at least once week - squatting the terminal is better then nothing RN
---
Hmm ill need to rewatch it i have most of the stuff but maybe i missed some of the tips
---
There's also the one that takes you to *an entirely different fast travel point*. 
---
I've encountered that one a few times recently, and it is disorienting as hell for a few seconds. You think you're going to the Ash Heap to buy some Legendary Modules, and as the loading screen clears you're hearing the Grafton Mayor yelling about GRRRAFTONN DAY!
---
Would the santa one not be more xmasy,  lol I know what you mean I spend most my atoms on collectrons at this point
---
Yes!!! I love what he collects. I make royal jelly taffy and sell that. Along with the snacks, which are great for challenges that are eat 20 prewar foods. Done! Chew bubble gum! Done! 
---
He’s got personality and that works for what’s going on with my camp.
---
I think there was a 1st skin datamined ages ago.
---
I’ve got the original too. But I was always over junked anyway.
---
Hopefully
---
especially for Canadians like me ..
---
It's just great when doing imposter Sheepsquatch... One shot that just arcs around the entire map melting every person in the event. Especially fun when no one else is a conduit and you're health is already draining
---
Arms... make it the arms, so we have useful mods for the Arms...
---
Max intelligence and unyielding armor, herbivore, egghead and herd mentality with strange in numbers, cranberry relish and brain bombs. Bobbleheads and live and love mags if you're lucky. With lunchboxes I get around 2.1k for mutants. Slightly less than angry turtle but they've obviously got a better bobblehead and mag supply than me.
---
Start with Very High intelligence as each point is +2%. Bloodied Builds are good for these xp heavy days. Mine is 20+ even on my own and I'm still lacking one unwieldy armour piece. 
---
L3 inspiration perk for +15%, even better if your Building team is sharing too. 
---
If in a team stay in the team and the bonus will double when bonded. Solo builder bonus of 2% can become 8% when others join and stay. 
---
And then you can add in the food, bobbleheads and other miscellaneous for insane boosts from 5 to 20% per item. 
---
I can hit a non-leg Super Mutant for 900xp+ even without going to the extreme lengths some go to to max it out.
---
Anyone else as a kid have those stick on stickers all over their ceiling ?
---
Im missing the food buffs and live and loves.
---
People don't care about canon when they are supporting a weird fan boner- only when a tiny voicline sorta kinda retconns "history"
---
Int is the reason for your low xp. Every point of int adds 2% xp. I'm getting 4000xp for huge enemies (max you can get) and and \~2000+ xp for super mutants with 41-44 int (depending on team size). Only way you can achieve high int like this is with unyielding armor.
---
Of course they're in it for themselves. They and I don't want to play that god damn mode but are forced to on a daily basis.  I do make sure I do it solo though.
---
Bethesda adds another bug to the collection, in other news sky is blue.
---
I just throw mine away, gunpowder is useless and not needed for 2mm ecc
---
I'm truly hoping that ES6 and Star Field are good, but knowing Bethesda, I'm getting my hopes ***high***
---
Where did you see it? In a trade window or a vendor...?
---
Friend of mine got reported for throwing a thumbs down and refused to pick up ‘gifts’... he missed dupeweek as his sister gave birth and he was a 1000km away from his ps... now he is waiting for bs-da to answer his email... petty f!cks started to report everyone who has something nice and higher level,f’in joke...
---
Angry has 72 int in his leveling gear/build with buffs.
---
BUMPER SWORD
---
Nope, there are no consequences.
---
I drop my spare stimpacks, Radaway, Skrip, Ammo to the first level &lt;30 player i come across everytime befor i log off.
---
I am so thankful for slow internet, when I get to a camp its invariably still loading up so I can see all those punj boards and trap wires and things before all the walls and disguises appear
---
Lol, scrip that crap.  Actually have 2 but only kept because they have reduced weight.  They're kinda fun but they, missle launchers and fatmen are basically useless in the game.  But you're right, they break pretty fast.
---
Doesn't mean we should be quiet about it :)
---
Sounds like something I'd come up with.
---
Obviously I call my TSE boom-stick lol.
---
Yeah you can.
---
Yes. You can't change the skin on c.a.m.p. thingys. Only way is to redeploy your c.a.m.p. and choose the new skin while doing so.
---
Ok that was always allowed
---
*Stealth unit detected in the AO*
---
If you are on Xbox I can help out
---
I know. I could kill those Devs at times but what can we do. Hopefully everything will be ok by time next fall out is out
---
Currently none because it's bugged. Seriously though not sure but now is not the time to farm atoms from challenges as you might not ever see them if you complete the quests.
---
Or English, like me. Sorry! Sorry..
---
You are? That’s very kind of you. Foundation thanks you.
---
https://youtu.be/YfsEoh4UdGo
---
No glitches, it's insane. He is spect'ed to max his intelligence, most of us probably aren't
---
There are very few people that disagree but bethesda is very unlikely to change it.
---
That is a bad mechanic then :( I wont redeploy my camp. It took so much hours to build it...
---
Well, does not matter. As I do not use the ghillie skins, the sledge skin, the rifle skins and so, I wont use the camp thingy skin neither. Thanks for your answer :)
---
Same as others have said just ask for help there are those of us out there that can lend a hand.. if ya on ps4 hit me up, have no issues bulldozing the road ahead for someone from time to time.
---
It’s becsuse besthda decided it was a good idea that you lose more CND for every enemy hit even if you shoot one bullet
---
My dad walked in while I was playing FO76 and he said “what’s that” I just explained really quick about the post nuclear idea of fallout and ended with “This game is set in WV”. Immediately he goes, “That’s not West Virginia, I see 3 flat spots  of ground on your screen”
---
There's multiple quest lines as well as events, dailies and random encounters to stack xp and level up. But unfortunately it's a fact of life that some people get fixated on getting past that one enemy at all costs rather than leaving to return another day.
---
How many posts are there about 'impossible to beat' Assaultrons and Sentry Bots? I've been there and after a few tries walked away, leveled up, re-equiped, returned, and won the day.
---
But patience is not everyone's virtue in which case sometime asking for a helping hand can work wonders.
---
"Optical sensors calibrated for detection of sparkles" i love that damn robot so much
---
just server hop once or twice... eventually level of enemies will adjust to yours.
---
I didnt know what I was going to do this morning until I read this.
---
You can name your weapons but I thought once you dropped or gave them to someone the name reset?
---
I
---
Something like this happened to me the other day, swapped from a Gatling laser to my fixer and had 250+ rounds loaded instead of whatever it should have been (wouldn't let me reload until I was under 25)
---
No it is not. It is working just like it always did. if you use two shot weapon it will break twice as fast because it shoots twice. Very easy for you to test it. Find a low level low durability weapon, fix it to 100%, shoot until it breaks with and without gunsmith, and see the difference on the number of bullets you lost.
---
Well it is double XP weekend... ;p
---
The materials used are free for the most part. A few things comes from your stash.
---
Wow good to know! I was eyeing that a little.
---
Firstly decide what kind of playstyle you like and until then save all your extra level points until you're ready to build something. 
---
Second ? Off try to find a gun that fits your playstyle. I dont mean just any gun. I mean legendary gun.  With a little research you can see which weapons and builds are the strongest and which legendarys are the best for the playstyle. 
---
Third and most important one. Its probably going to take you a long time because of time gating for you to get "late game" armor. Weapons are usually slightly easier because they're mostly rng and you can buy them from players but can still take time.
---
np
---
Guess I misread something then.
---
Yeah I know why people stay I have a strong lv 100+ junkie build aswell 
---
I just forgot about how tank gutsy’s are. Most of the new players don’t know about the reddit side of this game I didn’t know about it till lv 50 and I ligit just told my mate about it and the market and he’s lv 140
---
Asked for soooooo often.
---
Honestly, I can see why 1000 scrip scrap per day is rather OTT despite being asked for repeatedly, but I think I would cry tears of joy if patch notes ever said even a moderate 200 or 300
---
As seen in your other comment you need hunting rifle suppressor. Go to the prison. Kill all the super mutants, then scrap them on the workbench in the courtyard shed thing.
---
I cant remember the quest now.  But it spawns a level 50 Mr gutsy.  I died like 40 times but I snuck past time and had the best time doing so.
---
Hell, I’ve seen people ask for DoomGuy and his BFG. 
---
If we’re talking private worlds only, maybe we can have crazy cosmetics. Let them have Thomas the Tank Engine Scorchbeasts and Macho Man  Randy Savage Deathclaws... *in private*. 
---
You never hear people asking for Transformers in World of Warcraft.
---
I don't think I've found that mag but 5% is no huge loss. The food buffs are though. Relish is 25% xp and brain bombs adds 7.5 intelligence.
---
And nobody over lvl 50 who has spec'd at all should be struggling... like with most mmos, you have to grind your characters skills before you are even allowed to play
---
Boomer Tech.
---
They own everything. It’s their product and game — that they spent millions in making — after all. 
---
You don’t own anything.
---
Even if it was raised to 160 so that we could scrip four 3* weapons would make a huge difference.
---
That’s what I thought.
---
So they don’t listen to their community? I might aswell
---
Stop playing now
---
No worries man. Once you get use the the mods being on the backpack it's hard to use PA anymore
---
You need to learn to walk before you can run.
---
It would free up so much space if I could do that
---
Build close to a different fast travel spot then walk over.
---
Adrenaline... PLEASE. I leave ammosmithand mister sandman on at ALL times because I have adrenaline banked
---
On the map west is safe, the further east you go the...less safe it gets. The bottom right is Very Not Safe.
---
Whitesprings is inherently dangerous, I still have to be very careful when I go into the buildings. the ghouls are very fast and can slap the crap out of an unsuspecting  player, and god help you if you get yourself cornered.
---
Yeah 200 would be perfect but 300 would be wonderful
---
Does anyone know how much xp is needed from the winter beanie to the glowing costume?
---
I thought I should have got it by now...
---
join the reddit discord, if youre on PC id happily do them for you for just the materials  
---
save you 5.5k in plan cost
---
Or if you go into private. Come out for a while and then go back.
---
/u/LadyDevann this might be a good idea to pass along to the team. Let us permanent location CAMP folks apply the CAMP skins like wallpaper! Otherwise we're gonna miss out on the decor possibilities.
---
Haha, you are probably better off. And you took my comment the right way, intended as a joke. Good luck in the wasteland!
---
Not the tent. The C.A.M.P.
---
If the material requirement is green. Then that’s from the workshop itself.
---
Whit us from your materials.
---
Lucky you🤟🏻😂
---
Makes no sense to have a turn in limit on scrip. There should be a daily spend limit instead, this way the servers wouldn't be bogged down with players holding stuff they don't want or need and isn't worth selling. This would potentially solve a lot of stash issues for people as well. Bunch of knuckleheads(the B team) is what we've been left with it seems.
---
I usually just get out of the way,  wait and then take it back a bit later, I see no issue with sharing. Especially since hopping around claiming and defending workshops has been the best way for me to make the most of the double xp &amp; the 4x times event xp
---
Been grinding the events for the outfits drops no luck yet but ended up with loads of ammo for it so thought why not I usually just drop them but my OCD kicked in and wouldn't let me going to trade it at ammo thing when it gets sorted .
---
This is the best and only solution if you are not reaching your Camp's budget limit.
---
I understand your plight here, but adding surface to air missiles would be a disaster.
---
many new players do not pay attention to the workshop warnings. they will learn eventually to avoid workshops until you can protect yourself easier against all attackers
---
So so similar, if not copied code, regurgitated 🤮
---
Yeah. we've been asking since day one. 
---
i use the trading sub and there's still an element of trust but people get a rating when they complete a transaction. The higher the rating the more you should be able to trust them. Or you can use a courier to be the middle man. BUT that still involves an element of trust of course.
---
unfortunately this only works for full size walls. No double sided half walls unfortunately
---
Once again, people don't like the Devs here.
---
If a bot tells them someone from Beth replied, it's instant downvote.
---
I never said it was logical or rational. Simply explained why they were getting downvotes.
---
A tip for anyone filing reports.... Bethesda doesn’t care. 
---
They get fully documented exploits being conducted by dozens with clear evidence and it takes them forever to respond, if they respond. And the response they choose? Ban the wrong people. (This is in reference to the dev room, not the recent ban wave, which sounds eerily familiar)
---
Guilds are cool... But I just don't think they'd fit this game.
---
I'd much prefer an implementation of a faction system (someone made a really good post about it a few weeks back). 
---
So, instead of a ton if private guilds, the game has set factions you can join. Each faction offers different benefits/quests/items/etc.
---
I feel that would fit much more with the game than the generic MMO guild system
---
It certainly does, much brrrr 😎
---
The BFG I don't mind so much. Could be some random experimental weapon. It was a little fun in FO4 even though every shot cost a freaking fortune 
---
I just honestly never understood finding digital pixels "hot". Esspecially in freaking FO3. The graphics arn't exactly realistic.
---
*Poof. I have been summoned!
---
That would make so much more sense smh they have a sub scrip service  but I don’t see how it’s worth the money with all these little problems and bugs/glitch around
---
Maybe level up some more and get better weapons before quitting
---
The three people in the Responders’ hubs all say they are either wanting to follow in the footsteps of the organization (one for medical assistance and one as a Firebreather) or were returning after having fled (Morgantown Airport), so aren’t totally acting like they’ve been there this whole time. Certainly acting like they’ve been there a little while, though, which felt a little weird the day Wastelanders dropped. It’s like “Um, I’ve been coming through here regularly for a while - when did you appear?” I suppose my Pip-Boy is stuck on the same three days, though, so it could be radiation-assisted memory loss ;)
---
Or everyone can play how they want to and if you dont like how someone on the same map as you is playing you can server hop or go private. I dont have fo1st and I'm not putting away my fun bloodied explosive bow to share exp... hit them first or don't, we are in the wasteland my friend
---
We just got a huge dump of energy weapons, personally I'm hoping for more ballistics.   
---
9mm / 45 Pistol  
---
Fallout 3 Sniper Rifle (DKS 501)  
---
Lever action shotgun
---
Yeah, a first floor porch... So if I delete the front projection of the building realine the walls then rebuild, we should be OK?
---
Does anything new from the season work right? Lunchboxes broken, camp skin broken, ammo converter buggy too... I'm afraid to put weapon or PA skins, they might break the items... 😑
---
They never have been listening
---
It isn't just an issue about not listening to their community. They continue to make the same gameplay choices so youre forced to play daily if you want to progress. For example. 
---
The scrip is honestly one of the minor issues of the game but has one of the most repeated flawed designs bethesda has. 
---
You can only redeem 200 gold per day (sunny is currently bugged for a lot of people so there goes the extra 600 a week).
---
Youre also limited to how much you can level up your reputation to a faction. So it literally takes close to a month to become allied with them. For what is literally only a couple hours worth of content.
---
S.c.o r.e. also mostly works the same way. There is an exp gate that serves as a pretty "medium" gate that doesnt let you progress on their season pass casually. You have to grind hours for a score. 
---
At the end of the day most of these issues could easily be resolved by simply removing the caps as their arbitrary.  However these caps are so you dont realize there is a lack of end game content. Even if you remove the caps you will be left with a lack of end game content.
---
Lol, well most games take care of cheaters or use an anti-cheat system, but cant expect Beth to do anything about that..
---
Ummm what?
---
The argumentum ad populum is something you can use in something about facts, not in opinion based arguments. 
---
I don't think it's the frog legs, it's them in combination with explosives. They are just a little annoying sometimes. But yeah they are a must have in the current Meta.
---
You only get the 30% from the Perk, you don't find anymore during Matches. While you can find magazines to increase your explosinradius by another 30%
---
I don't think the Handmade on its own is OP, it's just very Powerful if someone who really is good in the game gets one, but Laser Rifle is just an energy equivalent in NW, don't see a dps difference between them, only the gunplay varies.
---
But back to the explosives, the dps dosent really matter in most of the situation since everyone is jumping arround anyway.
---
Aim gets really rewarded in NW, wich I actually really like, since Adventure mode PvP is the most toxic and skilless mess I've ever seen.
---
I don't want a big damage nerf or something, just a nerf in the number of ammo it spawns with, like only 3 or 5.
---
 But Grenades really need a damage nerf nerf, I use them by myself and holy moly they hit like a train. I rarely didn't one hit someone.
---
That's why I want this overall explosive damage Nerf and maybe the addition of the fireproof perk. (bet of they add it is completely broken and people live in the storm for several minutes)
---
___
---
Thank you for arguing with me, you really make me think about all of the current problems of NW. Really appreciate your enormous texts.
---
Magazines and bobbleheads are super easy to find in a private server
---
Why did you fall of the stairs
---
Even with van sent armor I get melted by this shit
---
you can claim workshops without worry (unless a friend joins), you have hoarding rights to all the junk that spawns and can shove it in your scrap box with ease
---
Private servers reset in 5 minutes after you leave them. Meaning you can log into a fresh server full of enemies that are scaled to your level (on areas that do that), go farm your favourite spots without worrying everything is already killed by someone or that some low level just walk around there and all the mobs are now level 10, log out for 5mins, rinse/repeat. Also, there is a very big difference in lag between public/private servers. And if you are new to the game it's easy to claim and farm workshops for materials/fusion cores/etc. as there is no competition. Another thing would be the ability to transfer items using world containers. Put some stuff to a suitcase somewhere, log out and swap toon, re-enter and the stuff is there for you to pick up. Although this method IS NOT 100% safe. On very very rare occations the server shuts down between the log out/in. So i would not use it to transfer extremely rare or expensive items. You need a friend to transfer those. Naturally you can do this on public servers too but it can be problematic with random people finding your stuff and getting back to same server.
---
Any increase would be a game changer. I feel like I've never caught up with daily scrip grinding since the glut at fasnacht. Huge weight management issue
---
yeah luckily i have the strength space now for max rank traveling pharmacy so I guess using those perk slots are a better option than not carrying my 7000 pounds in stimpacks
---
He is definitely not bugged on the Windows store version. I am still haunted by my first death in game because of him. Having a blast though!
---
Not even close. But if you want to be that guy that lived to hang onto your hate and have to put it on display. Go for it. It says more about you than what you say about Bethesda.
---
farming things. Enemies and loot. I go on first thing to grab the lead from 2 gyms and the screws and shit from 2 locations. Then i do it after a few hours. And if i am still on.. i do it again. So 3 or 4 times a day i get a poop load of lead and screws plus other goodies.
---
Oh and you can swap stuff between characters BUT this can be dodgy sometimes. In fact i've lost about 10k in 5.56 and loads of scrap legendaries in the last day alone when it crashed twice. So i would only transfer things you don't mind losing
---
Who knows, maybe Rank 5 does let you do that. It'd be a pretty good payoff for getting 5 out of 3 ranks in a perk.
---
Farming resources becomes extremely easy as you dont really compete with anyone.  Farming exp solo as well.
---
Thanks for the warning. 
---
Not that I'm surprised lol
---
Loot is always there instead of picked clean. There's a chance at magazines and bobbleheads etc as noone is running 'farm routes'. I use private to grind resources and collectables and public server to sell off my wares.
---
Plus if you let off a nuke people can't hawk your high radiation fluids and mob loot etc.
---
Outside of having the loot to yourself public is more fun. I do about 30/70 ratio of private/public.
---
Thx for all the advice
---
That's a good idea. I rarely get customers where my camp is (close to Black Bear Lodge) so I just assumed it worked when people stopped buying. Might need to redesign a little bit.
---
I just started playing Fo76 about 2 weeks ago after wanting to play ever since it came out and finally getting home internet. And I have to say i've been surprised by how generous and helpful the veteran players are. 
---
Everytime I login and play i'm gifted cool and unique (for me at least lol) items. I've also received help at the perfect timing. 
---
I was under Level 15 or so and wandered north of Morgantown to the Grafton Steelyard in the Savage Divide for the first time. I recalled seeing a map guide before that provided the range of enemy levels so I already expected the enemies to be more challenging. Wasn't expecting to get in the fight for my life with handfuls of Super Mutants though! This awesome player came by and saved my life, helped me rid of the enemies, claim the workshop, defend it and gifted me several items before going on his way.
---
I'm really enjoying the Fo76 community.
---
Why can’t America get along?
---
We might get to talk to him across a radio, at some point (of not it's a missed opportunity), but as has been noted it's actually an expeditionary force.
---
That said; I'm hoping we have the option to work alongside the Brotherhood, but **\*not\*** be forced to join up. Uniting against a common threat. My character as I've always RPed them is the new Mistress of Mystery. She is the richest person in Appalachia after Vault 79. She is part of the Vault 76 faction which is stronger than any small Brotherhood expedition; they are basically the X-Men with scifi weaponry. She has access to tech they don't even know exists. She has access to the silos. She is beloved by Foundation and feared by Raiders. She even has her own intel and mission support team with the Allies.
---
There isn't a single thing the Brotherhood can offer her as incentive to join up and fall under their chain of command. Now, she has respect for Maxson after listening to his holotapes, and for the Thunder having seen their sacrifice first hand, and will fight \*alongside\* them. She can't think of more capable allies, in fact. But that's a different thing than putting on a jumpsuit, climbing into some some crappy T-45d and calling someone who hasn't seen the darkness of Appalachia 'Sir'.
---
Only you can the name you named it other people will just see the weapons original name
---
I had to scrip my executioners minigun for that reason, kills any boss at half health so I screwed a lot of people out of loot before realising that.
---
I visit the public servers sometimes, but I do not go to other people's CAMPs.  I used to try dropping extra stuff in front of new/low level players, but trying to emote for them to check the loot bag, then trying to explain to them on area chat, only to watch them run away began taking up too much time.  Now, I take extra stim-paks, rad-x, radaway, etc. and split them up.  I put some of each in the Overseers camp in her stash box and in the red tool box, then I put some in the red tool box and blue lunch pail on the back of the pickup truck right up the road.  The nice thing about the blue lunch pail on the pickup truck is that it has NO weight limit, so if I have extra legendaries, plans, etc., then I also drop them into the blue lunch pail.  All of the new people coming out of the vault come by that way, and if I load those containers up when I log into a public server, go adventuring for a while, then come back, they are usually all empty, so at least someone is getting them.  :)
---
Is the reputation meter supposed to actually pop up when I back out of the conversation?  Because it doesn't.
---
You can complete one violent night solo use the June box take longer but you get more xp
---
Poor baby lost his exclusives :(
---
It's 2020 my dude. Exclusives are bullshit. 
---
I had all kinds of exclusive content in Guild Wars 2. Then they added it all back years later. You know what that did to my peen and anger level? Nothing. Because it doesn't hurt me and the new players get enjoyment. 
---
It's not like any of those skins are difficult to get anyway
---
Bolstering adds dr/er at low health so may be more suited to melee. Unyielding adds high specials at low health, I use it for stealth ranged.
---
this sounds completly right, now youre mentioning it. i just picked her because in my memory, she was one of the people acting as said. but during the first play of wastelanders with a new character, there were definitly some guys talking like it. cant remember exactly, who it was.
---
I think the two main advantages are claiming workshops with no pvp worries and farming areas for xp and mats and not finding them cleaned out by other players.
---
or at least more areas with gradual slopes
---
Ffs workshops are fair game. I don't even touch that shit in public server. Heck I barely touch that shit in private thanks to ZERO permanence as it's a waste of resources building them up, and boring af defending them from mole rats every hour for 20 caps and a couch/table plan.
---
as if it's only america...
---
bolstering is okey but unyielding is generally better, a lot of your survivability as a bloodied build comes from perks 
---
and one of them is dodgy wich consumes ap 
---
furthermore, on a melee character, extra strength means extra damage so its basically a no brainer even though its not mandatory as you will deal a ton of damage anyways,
---
so to start of, bolstering is nice but sooner or later you should try to get a full set of unyielding armor imo
---
on a melee character a full set of unyielding/cavalier would be very good i think
---
People cried about raids
---
Experiencing the same problem, for the first time, this month. Bethesda just pinging me generic replies saying I got them last week.
---
You're not alone buddy

Wanted to give my two cents here. As a higher level player myself, I have too much loot. I cannot carry/store it all, and with the daily limit on caps, I can't sell it all either. I'd much rather give everything to a low level player than just toss it, because at least then there's a chance it will make the game easier for someone. The game is a lot more fun when you don't have to worry if you have enough stims or water or bullets, and have a weapon that can kill enemies. Basically, me giving things away is a symbiotic relationship; you have a more fun gaming experience, and I don't waste valuable resources.
---
if you are on pc i can sell you some unyeielding armor
---
The winter beanie is from the halloween rewards
---
 The skeleton costume is from the christmas rewards.
---
Edit: the other way around lol. But the point was they were from different rewards
---
thank you for all the info!
---
If you were looking for a fun battle royale Fallout 76 isn’t it. Nuclear Winter is garbage and most of us don’t enjoy it anyway.
---
They just need a new gaming engine to fix anything
---
According to my calculation, I should get there at the end of August. So little more than a month, I'm at 52 rn.
---
To quote Flanders' parents;

Removed? * Angry John Wick sounds. *
---
I'm not replying to the op, i'm replying to you. You're the one asking about assassin pieces, i'm giving you my answer. Besides i stick under 180 with all my stuff. I use unyielding for melee so i have increased damage. Using it for carry weight purposes would be a bad idea anyway considering how it's heavy combat armor and takes a good chunk out of my inventory on its own. I can proudly say that in my 290 levels i never had any struggles in inventory or stash management. And not to mention, i only have 27 strength not 30. I spend most of my time in power armor as a hybrid between melee and heavy power armor build.
---
True for those who aren't looking for Ballistic Fiber.
---
thank you
---
Yes. When you have two foundations connected and you put a wall between them it can technically be the "outside" wall for either foundation, causing it to flip back and forth between the two when you go to place it. As long as you put the walls up on the house first and add the porch after you should have walls facing the correct way.

---
Heres the unlockables if you wanted to know them
---
Also the Halloween, xmass, and survival rewards are currently available threw a bug untill patch 21
---
I hate this enemy with a passion lol imagine if they did a boss event similar to the SBQ/Wedingo ones 😂
---
You're welcome!
---
Tried looking it wasn't there.
---
okay thank you
---
Sometimes dropping down a couple pulse mines and pulling bigger enemies into them can make the fight alot easier if tour toon is outmatched. Careful out there 🍺
---
Is this really true? Can you still see public team members when crouched?
---
Yep! I play on Steam and lost 80 from the “complete daily quests one.” I was at 850, then it said I was at 80 total, then back to 850. What the hell Bethesda.
---
I mostly use it for the ammo workshop when I need to farm 5.56
---
Here’s what I consider an advantage. 
---
All the enemies are there for you. And only you. (Unless you invite a few friends or your significant other). 
---
That means no more worrying about not being able to tag, or get the legendary loot from enemies, specially during an event. 
---
If you go searching for junk items, they will be there for you. Don’t have to worry about going to a certain spot, and all the junk is gone because another player was there before you. 
---
Sometimes you’ll get challenges that involve capturing a workshop. Now you can capture every single workshop if you wanted. And not have to worry about another player trying to fight and kill you for it. 
---
If you wanted to rebuild, or modify your camp, now you don’t have to worry about anybody coming to your camp, annoying you, getting in your way, etc. 
---
If you’re a vendor, now you don’t have to worry about anybody buying stuff from you if you’re already at max caps. Now you have all the time you want to go and spend your caps on new plans or weapons to buy from in game vendors.
---
Here too
---
I was on the same team as a hacker once. Most boring match of my life
---
the problem is that ever since the game started, people automatically compare every build to bloodied commando builds (first the handmade now the fixer)
---
while i do agree that pistols could definitely need some improvement, ultimately you dont need to do insane damage unless you want to solo the endgame events
---
i can see how thats a big endgoal for a lot of players but personally i dont think that should be the situation you judge your build upon
---
most of the time you deal with mobs in this game and if you want to use the gausspistol, then focus on its strengths
---
the weapon can be supressed and is powerfull
---
make a stealth build and aim instead of using vats and you can oneshot every supermutant/ghoul/snallygaster, you name it
---
yes the bugges vatsshots are really frustrating but you can definitely make use out of the gausspistol
---
Alright, thanks for the advice!
---
np have fun 👍🏼
---
So they disappear after being blown up? I've rebuilt my camp now anyway, had to do so to reclaim the 2 phantom turret slots. I've decided to stop putting my turret into the tight space it was in, I'm thinking it may have glitched due to that when it's one of them spaces where it is a slight touch between showing red for can't build or showing green for build. If it still disappears I will try the rug trick.
---
I’m on Xbox. Plus, I want a full set of Thorn armor. I like the look.
---
TIL. Thanks very much..
---
Oh Lord I can't stand him now.... :S I've downgraded to base version for a break. I loved him intensely at first but one or two of his lines just GRATE after the 100th time....
---
Sounds like someone dropped crap to loose weight. Funny thing is I do this aswell. Drop like 50 plans I got from different things, not even think someone see this as treasure lol
---
Lmfaooo one of the guys I play with mentioned this last night and now this morning it pops up in my suggested on here. I agree tho.
---
Read it again. I didn’t ask about Assassin pieces. I **answered** OP’s question about why would you want more than one piece. 
---
I have no idea why you decided to talk about Unyielding Armor. Maybe you meant to reply to someone else.
---
Felt like it only showed up under the walls tab after I built the garage.
---
I love Ace, the raider collectron's dialogue...
---
"Sometimes I think about burning this camp to the ground" 🤣
---
NW on PC?
---
The 80 you see sometimes and the 330 the OP saw are what still need to credit to the accounts. I have 120 in the ether waiting to credit. So the “lost” atoms are being tracked, just not credited in anything resembling a timely manner
---
I tried and I died! You lied!!
---
I rather not wait for you when you run around looting radrats, containers and admire the view. If you are not expecting/prepared to shoot at spawning enemies, and it takes more than few seconds for you to react to an legendary enemy that spawned 10 feet away, then sorry.. I'm not waiting for your lazy ass. I don't want to spend 10 minutes on a 5 minute event.
---
It has no strenght unfortunately, thats why this weapon and many others are in minor, i mean nobody use them. My point was not to make it op my point was to make it playable or atleast not frustrating to use with constant bugs, thats why i suggest lock prefixes and random major and minor effects for weapon types. If it was my call i would remove bloodied compleatly and replace it with something...
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah when she climaxes the fucking head laser-cannon goes off too..... You'll be just a set of legs and a pee pee.
---
Y'all standards have dropped.. I don't play the game but remember this sub demanding fixes at the start, not almost every part seems to be "it's really nice and thank you for adding this, but it doesn't work at all and makes the gameplay experience worst, Pro pretty pretty please make up for it"
---
Do they ever actually make up for it or is this a game to avoid?
---
F
---
Good, the plan worked.
---
I wonder if maybe they’re being sent to the Beth.net account, not the steam one. I switched over when it was free but didn’t tweak the .ini setting that allowed you to share the same pool. Maybe I’ll try that and see what happens
---
Funny. He didn’t say anything about you having to wait while he does any of that. 
---
I’m pretty sure he’s talking about people that one shot the legendary before anyone can even try.
---
Lol!!
---
I would love if the assault rifle could get a powerful 5mm auto receiver.  Make it a small light machine gun basically along with a larger 50 round magazine. 
---
A silencer for the 10mm smg. Sights would be nice too.
---
Max level chainsaws.
---
Assassin's should be changed to humans.
---
Mutants prefix should stack to 30pct damage. 5pct per mutation capped at 6.
---
Nocturnal shouldn't lose damage in the day. Just boosted at night.
---
You mess with the bull, you get the horn lol
---
As someone who lives in WV I can tell you that the amount of flag ground and lack thereof is pretty accurate.
---
Go full unyielding.  The stats boost makes it much better than anything else for bloodied/low health builds.
---
The perks you want are Nerd Rage, Adrenaline when they fix it, Blocker, Lifegiver (min rank of 3), Adamantium Skeleton if you have space, Dodgy.  You have to run a little more defense at the expense of a few offensive perks.  You won't need many damage perks because your damage will be insane without them.  Example, I only run rank 2 of the weapon specific cards like Shotgunner/Commando/Rifleman.  I don't run Incisor/Slugger/Gladiator *at all.*   I never feel the need for more damage.  Ever.   15k is easy with unarmed, 3-4k with most decent rifles, 2-3k with automatic ones. 
---
Good luck on the dark side... you're gonna love it.
---
well i see the frustration with bloodied, but i think the better solution would be to make more builds viable like buffing berserkers for example
---
the thing with bloodied is that its not only a legendary effect but it also has perks that complement it, id love to see such things for berserkers/junkies heck even nocturnal
---
Rifleman, and demolition.
---
Met a player that 600+ level that drop a full set of ultracite power armor for me. I was stupefied so I did not remember his/hers avatar’s name. Big thank you!
---
Sorry unrelated but are the staff size issues/server stability not 100% fixed yet? I don't play, but remember reading about it around a year ago
---
To the people downvoting me. It was a joke!
---
They need to do what RS does now you get 48hrs of DXP game time over the duration of 10 day’s which every ends first. That way if you work during the weekend you aren’t punished.
---
They wanna charge to give you unlimited junk storage  “create the problem sell the solution” such a money hungry game
---
I know I've gotten screwed out of several challenge rewards.
---
Can't even put in a ticket for them either, since I can't remember which challenges.
---
No don't worry, there's a guy here in the comments whose just a bit salty that he's part of the group being called out so he'll downvote anything not agreeing with him.
---
You're just pissing into the wind.
---
The sad truth is even if every single person that reads this sub and the official forums follows this and lets everyone tag, you'll still have a massive number of people that'll keep demolishing the legendary as quickly as possible.
---
It's something Bethesda needs to fix on their end. At least have legendaries tied to events only give their rewards at the successful conclusion of the event to all participants and not before.
---
I really hate how legendaries have become a pinata that everyone child at the party needs to have a whack at it otherwise someone will cry.
---
Bethesda is the only one that can fix this. Telling people won't do shit.
---
I just buy them because they have no weight and if I get a fair stack of the same ones I might go and get them.
---
I just think people really fail to understand humor! I used rhyme!
---
thank you :)
---
Yes. I'd be good with that. Extra scrip and bullion for fo1st. 
---
It's a little shitty to keep a scrap box away from everyone.  Makes them less inclined to play
---
Haha, ihad typed "unless you're a hoarder" but deleted that bit.  Oftentimes the thing that has me overencumbered are 5 nukes and 20 missles.  Blast away, friend!
---
[Here you go](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=fallout+76+npc)
---
known bug, no fix eta.
---
You can move points over after level 50. Once per level up, you either choose between moving a single point or a perk card.
---
I think a smaller increase to camp and stash would be enough for me.  The other stuff reeks of PaY2wiN or something like that.  I would even just love an ammo box seperate from stash.
---
Yes, when you reach lvl 50, you can respec.
---
Too pay to win. Would rather they just increase the limits because they're dumb af.
---
If anything, pay atoms to increase storage limit.
---
I am fully aware of that. Both things are accessible right now
---
That much extra xp is pretty crazy.
---
I wasn’t tasking you how many you’d like. I was asking OP. I was using it as a simple example to illustrate that having multiple changes for the same proc effect has a benefit. 
---
It was not an invitation to debate the comparative viability of armor setups. 
---
If you’d like to offer such advice to OP, a direct reply to them would be more effective.
---
well yes but this brings us back to my original request : Its good that you do it solo but there are many who DONT and screw it up for the team that had the bad fortune being stuck with them
---
So basically you go around one shooting legendaries on purpose because you hate the idea of people asking for others to show a little consideration since it was a group event and that’s part of the reward for event. An event that problem needs more than one person to do.
---
And your solution is that Bethesda needs to do something g so you don’t have to change and show consideration for others.
---
And your certainly right about telling other people. Just look how you responded to the idea of consideration for others.
---
I think the same but maybe my english isnt enough to explain sorry. I dont mind pistols to have lover damage but it should have some aditional effect at least or maybe stack damage or something, but charging gauss weapons is frustrating its just bad mechanic, and if u thing it has strenghts just try to use it to kill something in arktos event with another 10 bloodied guys, u wont hit a single sh.t. Before u charge and hit anything without vats its just so gone.
---
So 1600 stash for F01st, but everyone the unlimited junk capacity? It's a noble thought but it doesn't make money. The reason people buy F01st is so they can store junk and use the space in their stash to other things. With everyone having unlimited junk they won't buy F01st anymore even if it's just for scrip and xp and etc. Those 1650 atoms are nice, it's that much right? For the low price and the bonuses but it wouldn't make any money as most people will just stop their subscription.
---
No I know the post won't actually change anything. More of a vent than anything else. 
---
But also, it's not the idea that everyone has to, I think I worded it wrong. But it's the people who sit at spawns with a one shot build and wreck it before there's a remote chance for someone to get a tag that bothers me. Uranium fever is famous for it from what I've seen.
---
No thanks I don’t even think bethesda would even think of doing that. Fallout 1st is cosmetic only and convenience only, so is atomic shop.
---
What you describe there is complete and utter PTW and would get everyone to bash on bethesda again for the millionth time. I’m a fallout 1st sub myself  and I don’t want any PTW aspects on it. 
---
Bethesda said they would only add cosmetics or “conveniences” to the game like scrap-box or repair kits. 
---
And even if you wanna say private servers are PTW it’s really not it’s a CONVENIENCE OF NOT HAVING OTHER PLAYERS TO STEAL YOUR LOOT
---
Also pretty sure there lowering the price of fallout 1st soon anyways.
---
Oh I'm a horder im really bad have 2 character 2 mule and another one starting 2 Mora for all me stuff lol
---
Inb4 "but my scrip go brrrrr lol"
---
Your maximums per day get increased but you still have to work twice as hard to reach it. You aren't getting +100% caps on whatever you are selling or something but the amount you can sell is twice as much.
---
Plus for FO 1st members it won't be double exp weekend for a few days every now and then, but double exp weekend everyday!
---
in a vendor
---
Anyway just got the skeleton. Took maybe 4 additional matches getting in top 10
---
I think you’re on to something. Minus the pay-to-win parts. Maybe there could be some type of bonus or buff for 1st players though. 🤔
---
"Noooooooooo!!!!!!!"
---
i get what you mean dont worry, when they got added i used one for a while on my junkies build and i did ultimately change the build for the exact same reason you mentioned 
---
but i had no problem in day to day combat and im not really into the endgame events i used that character to just roam around and farm legendaries as a stealth gunslinger wich worked fine for me
---
Alright. So since those items are from different reward pools you don't go from one to another, you fill the xp pool for both at the same time.
---
By the time you got the nw beanie you should've gotten the skeleton outfit I think. The last thing you'll get will be the fur lined jacket and jeans which requires 14k exp from when you get the nw beanie.
---
No. Extra experience and in game currency would be even worse.
---
When I put the Ghillie skin on my armor it broke the pieces and now I can't see myself at all! /s
---
Legendary Weapons broke the fallout experience for me. Imagine if there are no legendary weapons, most of the enemies will not be one shotted. Builds will be based on our playstyles not be based on a legendary weapon prefixes. Players will have the sense of danger on high level areas. 
---
The worst part of 76 is the penalty of death, no loss of xp or whatever, just junk. So the idea of high risk high reward is non existent, bloodied builds dont have high risk, just go blazing, stash your junk and if you die, just do it again.
---
To start any psycho prefix drug like psychotats which gives 25% flat damage increase and glowing meat steak for 10% melee damage.
---
Oh indeed? That's silly.
---
Treasury maps give a good amount of steel if you have a lot. And other junk, weapons, armor, ammo, plans, aid, xp, caps. I think those got duped as well because of how valuable they are but no one realizes it
---
You can layer the two tracks on top of each other. Anyway I got the skeleton ~4 matches after the beanie.
---
I’m not grinding for that jacket though. Too much!
---
It’s not just Assaultrons. Charred feral ghouls and Colonel Gutsys too. The firerate paired with the damage of the Colonel Gutsys drains my health if I don’t know where they are, and it’s always a pain to kill the feral ghouls cause of their behavior patterns paired with the amount of damage they do.
---
They is no true full respec in fo76, however you can slowly move perk points after level 50, as other people have mentioned.
---
If your camp isn't too elaborate maybe try moving it and see if they all end up there. If not, I've got nothing 🤔
---
Or give us rocks and dirt to terraform the land
---
Sort of like ESO when you pay in-game gold (in game challenge Atoms?) to increase bank or inventory limits or buy the unlock through their equivalent of Atoms which is Crowns.
---
i bought him immediately but swaped back to my communist one when Fasnacht was over.
---
you can bet next Fasnacht he's coming back, though. i like putting up decorations to match the actual season lol
---
Yeah. Another 200 would be great. Though I’ve gotten really good at stash management because I’ve learned not to pick everything up.
---
very well said!
---
When they added it it was bugges the hits in vats did charged damage even without charging so u could quickly spam damage without charge and it was ,,usable” but they fixed that in last patch now u do nothing without charging now u have to charge to miss always first hit which is also bug btw they charge another hit to do ,,something” its damn 6 seconds of clicking and holding buttons to do like few damage. The damage isnt the case the case is the procces to that damage is supper long and frustrating..
---
On one hand I agree with you,I hate you when people just onetap legendary enemies or completely obliterate them without letting the others have a swing.But on the other hand you have to react quickly or forfeit the legendary.I don’t want to wait for a person looting every inch and admiring the shitty textures.
---
Yea the double xp is a hard sell definatly too much.  The other stuff would cause a shit show.  I am a 1st member and i wouldnt want to be able to have double the maxes of non members.  That is a tad crazy.  If i can nhi ow hold 300k caps across 5 toons on 1 account the others are at a disavantage
---
&gt; So basically you go around one shooting legendaries on purpose because you hate the idea of people asking for others to show a little consideration since it was a group event and that’s part of the reward for event 
---
Not even remotely dude. I also "allow" people to hit the legendary i.e. I get in enough hits that I know I've got it secured and let others do the rest. Well, unless they take too long but that's usually not an issue.
---
The point I'm making is you're telling the wrong people to fix this issue. We need to implore Bethesda, not the players, to ensure that this is no longer an issue. They are the only ones that'll have ANY impact.
---
You're just wasting everyone's time. We've all seen this post before. You're not the first and you won't be the last either until Bethesda fixes it for good. For events. It's a bit much to expect it in general. That starts to enter into entitlement territory, like you're "owed" that legendary.
---
I’d be down if they just gave FO1st members what they promised on day 1. We are still waiting on half the “benefits”. I only have it for the scrap box, that’s pretty much it.
---
**HEEEEY! Found a way to spend these ghostly atoms!**
---
So I play on Steam, and right now I litteraly have two Fo76 downloaded onto my pc.  
---
The way I do this is:  
---
\- Earn atoms while launched off Steam  
---
\- Spend atoms while launched off Bethesda Launcher  
---
Perhaps you could do this all just earning and spending on bethesda, but I'd rather not risk trying only to discover that it made the world burn  
---
And btw, no matter on what platform you play - you are always connected to bethesda account, so I do not accept saying, that It's impossible "bcs I don't have bethesda account"
---
well i didnt know about that change i think i really get your point now,
---
im gonna try it out again and see for myself
---
I see it a lot, especially with people using explosive teslas or other legacies. Instead of just bashing them they tend to pull the trigger and kill it. In uranium fever for example, close quarters so a tesla instantly touches all mole miners in a few shots. A legacy finishes them with ease. It's like people don't care, my gatling gun one shots mole miners so i use my bayonet to tag the legendary and i move on. You will be much more appreciated when you share.
---
always some low level pass to my camp I make the strongest bat I can make the one with lunar and rocket blade and stuff for them, so they can actually hit hard when out of ammo.
---
dont take this the wrong way, but. did you play any of the new quests before coming to reddit? because there is SO MUCH LORE as to who they are and why they came back.
---
I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but sheepsquatch meat and yao gui ribs are good too
---
Furious, TS really isn’t top dog anymore, the damage would be less than full stacked furious and if anything just makes you lose durability 2x as fast.
---
Ah I see what you mean now. My bad. It is a grind yeah. It took me like 20 matches of bush hiding until the end from the beanie to the jacket. That with double xp
---
Mentats, don't forget the mentats
---
There is currently a glitch, which I won’t say how, allows you to get infinite treasure maps for just a little work. I usually just drop them cuz the rewards aren’t worth it for late game players, but early game would be everything you’d need to start a character.
---
Yessss!!!!!!!
---
I still use them, just for the steel and ammo converter. What you get you don't have to buy, the junk is a free addition and maybe i unlock a mod
---
I wanna say f*** you, to the person standing on the cliff side on  Line in the sand event, killing everything with his be gatling plasma while we all popped lunchboxes for the event during double xp weekend. Big f*** you pal!
---
"It just works."
---
Additional perks to use besides what’s already been stated is long shot, tank killer, and sniper.
---
The devs of the hack are trying to do more to stop NW hacking than Bethesda is.  Most of the hack features are disabled in NW now
---
Uranium Fever, Free Range, AWOL Armaments and a few more. Even worse when people focus it down at the expense of the successful completion of the event.
---
I get it. I'm not unfazed by this issue either. I just don't bother telling people here to let all the kids have a whack at it first because it's a waste of time. It's not a people problem, it's a systemic one. It's Bethesda's systems so it's theirs to fix. That's all I'm saying.
---
Yeah the process in which I’m talking about that gets you the treasure maps already does that. The extra effort to go dig them up is worthless comparatively.
---
With wastelanders they made all gauss weapons have an innate explosive effect don't believe me shoot the ground at your feet with your rifle
---
Did he raid Barry manilows wardrobe?
---
Still a stupid as fuck decision in a fucking team multiplayer game. Just have the quests NOT be saved on your end but youre following a friend'a progress. The issue is not giving the friend the same amount of exp whoch is fucking stupid as fuck
---
Actually very helpful, also note for melee builds the laser turret is high placed so have a ranged weapon at the ready
---
Nearly every high level player I have come across has been amazing to me.  It's made me want to pass on the generosity when I come across lower level players now.  Love the community vibe
---
Ha, well I guess what i mean is, I feel like I can play more casually.
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food)
---
Their manager is busy giving craps rolls to plays. Thank mrs. Murmmggh
---
Personally I think they need to completely change legendaries and how they come into the game. They are just too much and honestly make no sense. 
---
Why is this creature legendary? They mutate to heal up? 
---
I’d rather see something like this. Most creature have several unique mutated versions. They are larger, have weird abilities, and look different.
---
Say a molerat, the size of radstag, and breath ms a fire attack. Or a multi headed mole rat.
---
These super mutated creature have unique materials you can use to create the legendary effects, which you can attach to your weapons and modules.
---
Your rank In crafting perks would determine how many you could put on a weapon.
---
Now that won’t change people trying to one shot these creatures. But you could certainly make these creatures tough enough that one shots wouldn’t be as likely.
---
Also, these creatures wouldn't be part of events. They would just be random encounters in the world. Gives people a reason to go out and hunt and travel. Maybe there could be clues that would let you know when one is near by.
---
Happened to me the only way I got rid of it was by moving my c.a.m.p other than that i personally don't know how to get rid of that
---
Happened to me last night, had to build a completely new camp... it’s actually ridiculous
---
The facility around the giant radar has tons of fans, typewriters, and globes. I purposefully went there the other day just for screws.
---
Nah the take different workshops achievement where you have to take all the different ones. Only 3 left. I'm just doing 1/day for that daily
---
it happens to my laser Gatling something like that but when I empty shotting her she goes 0 then go up 50-200 rounds and I keep shotting with out reload her.
---
Anyone that you kill is a noob.  Anyone that kills you is a hacker.  It’s video game logic 101.
---
I keep telling myself this is the month i ween myself off first.  Looks at a stash box just full of armor.......one more month.
---
I know you are frustrated but was that response from you really needed? Makes me wonder how the rest of your correspondenses have gone.
---
You catch more flies with honey
---
Uhh... No, this stupid as fuck decision is a final fantasy MMO thing, where people fucking thing singleplayer decisions are great in a MULTIPLAYER FUCKING GAME.
---
Seriously, which ever fucking idiot at bethesda even brought this feature up needs to get BANNED from the workplace.
---
Fucking social outcast fucks want this shit. :/
---
You wont have to worry about people obliterating the legendaries in Uranium Fever, One Violent Night etc.
---
What I use it for, is to nuke whitesrpings, and I know nobody will kill the ghouls before me so I can get High Radiation Fluid.
---
Yeah but he asked where the graveyard is so I told him
---
A bug prevents her from getting crippled, they're working on it. Just like vats, adrenaline and other shit that shouldn't be broken
---
Yes, she did. It’s something they are allegedly trying to fix. It will add another viable tactic to the combat.
---
I lost One Violent Night because of this bug. Not a big deal but frustrating.
---
They are community managers, not devs.
---
What a very strange comment, not sure where you see the 'hate' do you see this in everything?
---
Not to mention that you will be missing alot with the huge accuracy and recoil penalty on two shot prefix.
---
This works but interior walls would make sense. Also texture options for the interiors of the roofs.
---
So, the fake Sheepsquatch ?
---
No.
---
On Xbox rather than PC but same thing happened to me last night mid-rebuild. Had to 'move' my camp to the exact same location for 40 caps and start over. It should save buildings even if you haven't blueprinted them, mine were there in the stored menu - only problem was it wouldn't let me place them down.
---
Try building another stair up to the floor and see if you can remove the other foundation/floor. Worked for me.
---
No.... Even in WoW you can go from 1-120 only doing group stuff. Including quests. In fact, they added a fucking quest sync so everyone can be on the same page. 
---
Literally this happened because stupid ass new MMOs are following WoW's warlord of draenor policy of putting everyone in a fucking garrison singleplayer gameplay.
---
It's like people at MMO's are all social outcasts that want an MMORPG without the MMO.
---
Because I thought this was the one he meant
---
Purified water, dog food, and rad away. Saved me hundreds of hours
---
Would be awesome if that "team fill" didnt keep resetting to "on"
---
Power armor used to be powerful, but it's nerfed. Considering how Combat armor and marine armor have the ability to have more DR and ER than Power armor. Back in F3, NV and 4 you could actually feel the difference between power armor and no power armor. In 76 you're a lot more vulnerable even tho it might be as strong as 4.
---
Even after moving everything over to a mule except an Unyielding and Vanguards set of armor, and committing to only one set of weapons instead of keeping a whole collection of them around, it was still scrap that kept on blowing up and eventually hitting the limit I found.
---
There are other crafting materials that aren't junk or scrap as well. Like high rad fluids and glowing mass.
---
The one from the free range event?
---
What strange is that when someone makes a statement, that is 100% wrong, and someone provides the correct information. And that person still tries to insist they are right somehow.
---
You know, like how you are insisting that the code is still somehow related even though dataminers have fully debunked that idea. That they don't share any code in common. That they aren't even similar.
---
Been reading this forum since game launch, and people that use that, the Scorchbeast are reskinned dragons from skyrim aren't doing it because they are being positive about the game, or Bethesda. It's generally a slam against Bethesda.
---
30 minutes to launch?  Many people can run a silo in less than half that time. And that’s without using any glitches.
---
What do the rarity letters mean? I couldnt find it
---
First contact customer service is like the receptionist. They are there to get you to the right people, not solve every possible situation. They forward the issues to the specialists so that those people don’t get further bogged down with requests *they* can’t handle.
---
People often forget that there are people on the other end of that conversation.
---
Not exactly a smart move to be snarky at the people you're wanting help from.
---
Somehow i prefer bush wookies over people who run around with you, then go ahead without you. You emote them there's a fight and instead of coming back they look at you with a sniper. They won't help you and they won't come revive you. Why join a team if you're just gonna do nothing.
---
Add in a scrip/bullion max limit increase ....
---
This sub would self destruct in 46 seconds.
---
This. Needed.
---
No... The simplest option would to have it where progress is tied to the player leading it and whoever joins just ends up having that progress UNTIL THEY LEAVE THE LEADER'S PARTY, in which case, it gives you a fucking option to stay synced to the leader's progress or start over.
---
That's literally the first thing they should be thinking of BECAUSE GUILD WARS 2 WHICH CAME OUT B4 THIS ALREADY FIXED THIS PROBLEM SHAISNQLOSGUS
---
The grass clipping back up foundations is so annoying.......
---
I think sometimes the game thinks you're dehydrated/hungry, but also sometimes when I run a little bit further it works
---
If by relocate you mean at it was build at the last place you had it, then you need to just start over and rebuild it from the ground up.
---
It'll take Bethesda a lot of work that they won't ever put in to fix that problem to allow us to move a whole camp as is to a new location without having support/placement issues.
---
It doesn’t really what they change, people are going to complain about it. It’s either PTW or GrEeDy BeThEsDa
---
Bloody mess
---
It's a known issue that Bethesda is aware of. No fix as of yet.
---
Ahh possibly, I’ll keep on trying that then
---
No, too much disbalance.
---
Oh lovely! So it is a problem that they was aware of, thank you kindly
---
I get rubber banding, but mine isn't usually during combat, it's when I run. I'll run and every 5 steps, I bounce back 3 or 4. It's even worse when I jump or jet pack up, jumping or jet packing puts you right back to where you started. It doesn't go away with server hops or logging out to the main menu and back in. 
---
The way I solve this type is by closing the game out and restarting it. When I log back in all rubber banding is gone for me. This works every time.
---
Posted in case someone else has this happening to them too.
---
TBH I really don’t even feel like bethesda is even as greedy as other companies like EA or rockstar.
---
When Wastelanders first dropped, I had to put up with her until I finished her quests.  Once I was done with those, I switched my CAMP ally to the Settler Wanderer and never looked back.  :)
---
Just FYI, explosive on a weapon sucks for durability. The way the game registers “durability loss” is when you hit a target. I assume you have all the enemies spawning in the middle at the sonic generator. So when you attack you hit all those enemies at once which registers hits on all the enemies. You only shot once, but the game considers it like 15 attacks. That’s why your durability is melting so quickly. 
---
FTR yes durability does seem to go down faster right now, even with gunsmith 5, but in general those kind of weapons break incredibly fast.
---
Well, I mean if Bethesda just wants to go mask off (more so than they already have) and lean hard into the pay2win of Fallout 1st, sure. Why not.
---
If you have stairs attached to the foundations you’re probably have to rebuild. Had that plenty of times. Now if I know I’m moving camp I make sure I take those of first. Still a pain in the d*ck though.
---
I have this 99% of the time I enter the whitesprings by the front door I feel your pain 😅
---
Sure, but we don't need 6 people.
---
Hmm checking it out, someone said it was increased camp budget for private worlds, increased camp build area for private worlds, persistent workshops for private worlds and discounts on atom shop items.
---
"persistent workshops for private worlds" - that alone would be worth a sub. Currently you make a private world then next day you go back and it's all gone and you have to build it up again.
---
Lol at buying FO1st for the scrap box. 
---
Non members think it's this cure all to stash problems. 
---
It seems sooooo useful at first. Then after 2 months you realize all the good junk? Has high turnover. You use/trade it often. Then most of your stash box is 90% useless junk that I should have just dropped. 
---
I have it for the Atoms, the Private server is a nice bonus
---
I've always thought a limited scrapbox subscription for like $2.99 a month would work for those who can't quite afford the whole shebang..
---
I also find a lot of these laggy things are caused by edge in the background especially when reddit posts are being replied to. If the dialogue box pops up over the game fallout shits itself
---
Yes, and best used on the final day of the season as the ranks get harder and harder to get. If by that time you are still missing ranks.
---
You're just deluding yourself if you think Fallout 1st isn't pay2win, or you don't understand the actual definition of what pay2win actually means - paying for any advantage over those that don't pay i.e. it's not literally about "winning", even though it does apply in some contexts.
---
Happened to me on strangle heart event killed the heart and got nothing
---
It's really irritating go through a missile silo and every assaultron is just blasting.
---
Although I have kinda found a way around the bug because they can't move while shooting the laser and eventually the real laser is charged and after they fire that one the bug seems to end
---
I don’t mind sharing, heck I even leave the extractors unlocked. Sometimes even join people defending their workshop or defend it for them just for the Events challenges. 
---
But it is really lame when you’re up to claim a workshop for the daily challenge and some troll griefer sneak up on you to kill you and get your loot. That’s not PvP, getting no chance to fight back— that’s straight up MURDER *cries*
---
I love building in this game. I love being able to customize my home.
---
I thought I was insane but I’m so glad others are doing the same thing! If I can I also drop some of my surplus CAMP plans as well
---
yeah, those are annoying too, when you get them in game, they don't go away. you have to open your inventory to manually close them. Reddit replies and YouTube recommendations.
---
They've pretty much summed it up for you.  Dump the TS.
---
just a quick thought on the power lines for prefabs, I run a power connector with a junction box then the down facing emitter for power inside. 2 pcs quick, painless.
---
Same. I use the scrapbox tho, i mean couple hundred flux, around 15k steel and lead. Then around 300 of each type of junk. My stash can't handle that junk, plus i have around 15k rounds of ammo plus 40 fusion cores in my stash. I also like to put all those scrip legendaries in my stash, at one point i had 50 so i had to give them away for free cuz my stash was freaking out. I also have 5 suits of power armor
---
I use herbivore with steeped fern flower tea for +4 strength. Strange in numbers ups it to 5. Add Psychobuff when I'm going after something big (ie sbq).
---
Rubber banding is caused by server lag and weapon bugs, not your character build. The difference is a very noticeable one when you switch from public server to a private one for example.
---
Yeah some one explained that to me today who coded this game, that's the whole point of explosive weapons lol o e shot kill a lot
---
After 15 mins of not being in the world the private server goes to someone else or shuts down. That’s what kinda sucks about “private worlds”, where you log into a new private server you expect fresh untouched server, but that doesn’t always happen. You sometimes share with someone who just disconnected from their world. 
---
There was other bonuses like private servers could be modded, etc. which still have not be delivered as promised. In general people buy 1st for the scrap box. The tent is kind of a nice convince thing, but isn’t worth $13 alone. No one really cares about the sub par cosmetics.
---
There were a few pieces here and there like Tessa’s fist and the reward from completing the research inside of Cambridge Polymer Labs. Also I think the Brotherhood gives you some for the T-60. The paint jobs boosted SPECIAL points too unlike in 76.
---
Accuracy isn't a problem i hit everything, but your point's been noted. Furious it is. Gonna miss that number of 250 damage tho, but it only does 13 damage against the SBQ while furious does 35
---
Because lifegiver makes you immortal.  Simple as that.  Ask Angry Turtle, He is no dumbass and it was his idea.  Don't mock what you don't understand.
---
With the speed demon mutation, Lifegiver not only increases your max health, but it *caps* your minimum health at whatever rank bonus you have.  For lifegiver 3 that would be 31hp, Lifegiver 4 is 45.  The only thing necessary to trigger this is to move.   
---
Maybe even you can see that having a minimum health of 31-45 *could* be useful.
---
And yeah on serendipity.
---
There is so many positives to it. Can’t really go wrong plus you get those ugly camos for wood armor because who doesn’t like puke looking paying on wood armor. lol but no there is no downside to private server. Unlimited scrap box, your own world so that means all that loot for yourself and you get 1800 atoms a month.
---
I’ve been taking a break around the time the score system dropped (I know that’s odd but it just seems to grindy to do in my opinion), and the first thing I realized after playing some other things is just how poor the camp building is in general. Don’t get me wrong, they’ve made some good improvements, but the building freedom you get in other game’s really shines a light on how poor it is. Being able to phase items, not NEAR as many building restrictions that come up, being able to appropriately adjust items so that they’re not floating, or they just adjust to ground in general. I enjoy building in 76, but you shouldn’t have to fight and trick the game to place things. I really hope they look at removing more building restrictions in the future and give more creativity back to the players.
---
Alright, i'll keep my tse gatling gun tho.
---
Same with most of the monorail.  Why cant I build up the side of abandoned spaces?
---
It's a game changer, literally!
---
A hundred dollar bill is a piece of dyed cloth, so granny's tie dye shirt is a hundred bucks, no?
---
Entire purpose of junk is that it can be broken down into resources, putting the resources into the junk catagory would make the entire process redundant.
---
Wow thanks for the quick response.  So is there a way that Bethesda has been tracking this or is it based on us submitting tickets?  And have they been good about crediting the accounts when brought to their attention?
---
I wonder how many other points I have lost out on and didn't even notice.  I think I missed out on 1000 legendary run points but wasn't 100% positive on that one so I never actually submitted a ticket but it made me pay closer attention to the various points.
---
I believe they are called ceilings
---
Yessir
---
I found one in Glassed Cavern mine, just one
---
I was just going to make a joke about how my scrawny girl character carrying a mothman plushie on her back can carry over 100lbs more than she can in top of the line XO-1 power armor with dual calibrated shocks.
---
I’m just reporting what I’m observing.
---
Though it does make sense that having to proc less buffs may have an impact on how your character is experiencing the lag
---
I doubt anyone you talked to on Reddit actually coded this game fyi. Regardless Explosive was nerfed quite a bit though, Iran’s not nearly as effective as it used to be. TS for example who bullets would do explosive damage, now both the prefix and major attributes do less damage and with TS you only get the explosive on the first bullet. The second bullet just does normal damage.
---
Additionally another example is something like an explosive shotgun, each of the 6,8-10 pellets all used to do explosive damage, now only 1 does and TS only adds 1 extra pellet. The whole thing is shit now haha.
---
You don’t understand the term PTW sir
---
Pay to win - a situation where the player can buy in-game content or in-game changes, with real money, that give the player a gameplay advantage or advance the player gameplaywise. ... 
---
You buy things other players can't get just by playing, buying items that players that don’t spend money can’t achieve/do
---
BETHESDA HAS NOT DONE THIS ^
---
I mean it’s pretty obvious that bethesda has added fallout 1st for convenience only.
---
A player can join a public server and still do everything people do in private servers although it’s a CONVENIENCE because other people aren’t there
---
Survival tents OH COOL what a CONVENIENCE guess I don’t have to wait a couple mins to walk/fast travel/build a new camp.
---
A scrapbox isn’t ptw because well..... it’s junk..... junk is everywhere in this game.... now it’s just a CONVENIENCE that you get a storage to put it all in
---
My guy maybe you should research PTW and it will help you understand before you comment
---
if you save your free atoms in the season pass, you can get about 10 free spaces. i recommend holding on to the end in the event you are falling behind and in the last week need a final push
---
LOL upvoted.
---
Because everyone in foundation is a synth.
---
Dont feel too bad I am going on vacation next weekend during double score :(
---
I think legendary enemies should have invulnerability or else take decreased damage for the first 10 seconds or so, and after that they take regular damage. At least they wouldn't be insta-killed.
---
Im level 260 but I been giving low levels items I have since level 60. I would say I given items to more than 50+ people. Whether it be Stimpacks, Radaway, Legendary Weapons and Armors, Junk, Serums, Ammo, Plans, or just caps that I spend in their Vending Machine's. Yesterday I wasted about 1000 caps in some low level who was sleeping in their bed. I just had extra caps and decided why not. I always wonder if anyone recalls me in the end of the day but then again, I hope to make their day :) and make them enjoy fallout 76 a bit more.
---
I logged on yesterday to find out my camp wouldn’t place because someone built theirs close to mine. Was mega pissed. Fallout has always been buggy but this game is taking the cake for sure.
---
Sorry I meant some one told me today. Who coded this game ? IE what moron?. Sorry I type quickly and have problems with sentence structures.
---
Wouldn’t buying stash with atoms literally be pay to win?
---
I went to see him yesterday and he was asleep inside the cabinet in his trailer. I clicked him and he phased through the wall. Fucker couldn’t even be bothered going to bed (what grown man has a bunk bed and doesn’t sleep on the top one anyway).
---
So I’m not surprised.
---
I did the first as settler, other 4 as raider mostly because
---
1/ paige and ward are horrible 
---
2/ raiders have shit "I'm like all edgy" fashion but are generally less jerks
---
3/ motherlode
---
I suppose if someone didn't care for taking more than several workshops and feeling someone could come by and cause trouble, using private worlds to mule when it can be done at a little more risk with world containers, and didn't encounter that many people contesting for the specific resources or quests they go for, then that could be an option. Actually at that price I think so many more people would probably get it - you might be onto something here.
---
West Virginia has something in common with Hawaii, in that many large scale construction plans involved the copious use of explosives.
---
often more than they originally planed.
---
Theres one on the legendary run
---
I use the final word too
---
Never have enough lead to craft sometimes :/
---
It's not free. You're giving up 150 atoms that could have been spent at the Atomic Shop. It's even worse because there is no other way to regularly get atoms other than to spend money.
---
If you think of the 150 atom rewards we get from the run as just a free move, you may as well consider the Atomic Shop a cash payment only store because that's effectively what it becomes if you think those moves are free.
---
I was getting anywhere from 2900-4000 doing manhunt by myself all weekend. Just team events team, stew, I think 10 intelligence, a lunchbox, and the inspirational perk
---
Those were the best! I used to stare at them until I fell asleep.
---
Damn I didn't realise it re-used the server like that, so it doesn't reset but you get someone else's world.
---
I tried doing this event (Encryptid) when I was lvl 40ish the other day without knowing what it was. I started the event after doing the quests for it and people slowly showed up but just sat around farming the robots that spawned the whole time. I had flashbacks of all the times Arenanet put events into guild wars 2 that were better if they failed in terms of rewards (something they have since learned from by changing how they reward for events.)
---
Watch out everyone, we’ve got the pinnacle of maturity over here! 
---
I think the key part of your reply is “years later.” I’d be in no way salty if the content came back round on that timescale. Instead, they re-released it to try and boost NW player numbers heading into the double xp event. They say bug, I say pretty fortuitous timing.  
---
Yes, it is 2020, my dude, so I in no way expect exclusives to remain so indefinitely - I do expect it for a bit longer than two months, however.
---
100% this. pretty annoying having it pop up in the middle of the screen. im not a huge fan of the blue score bar location either, would prefer it to be to the left like when you track daily/weekly challenges.
---
Yea people are losing out on score points, Bethesda said they cant do anything about it but added extra daily challenges to help make up.
---
Are you talking about the U-Mine-it maps?
---
This is what I was thinking as well, I dont doubt the fo76 community but I also get rid of fusion cores regardless since they're annoyingly heavy
---
I'm a Fallout 1st player who rarely uses the Atomic Shop. 
---
You're right, my suggestion may not be practical for all players.
---
I don't see alot of people doing it but doing the lighthouse also gives you a xp buff
---
If tagging works explain this 
---
https://youtu.be/TJf76Oz0BLs
---
That’s a different animal entirely.
---
If it’s TSE 250DR that’s an old dupe weapon, but it holds its own.
---
Gauss shotgun is through the settlers.
---
*facepalm*
---
Good info thanks... Would I have ever thought of this o.o..........
---
Certain weapons will rubber band constantly (because of the bugs). I'm stealth commando with bloodied handmade + fixer with full and normal cookie cutter build. I play on very low lag server and i have zero rubber banding issues. If i switch to my shotgunner / heavy gunner, i will rubber band on every single mob. Only difference between the two characters are weapons and heavy gunner/shotgunner instead of commando. Both toons use all the other "must have" perks.
---
Way to ruin a nice positive post.
---
I always try to share the Legendaries with others, but sometimes I just one shot them by mistake... and I feel terrible... they should add an emote to say Sorry.
---
I farm and sell water. Adds up. But every time I decide to sell my gun powder that's when I run out of ammo and need it.
---
If you’re on one side of the map and you’re trying to fast travel to the other side, and your camp is in the middle, the cost should be from the spot you’re travelling from.
---
In a way yes, the guaranteed spawn items aren’t always guaranteed. The containers are of course not looted because they are instanced loot, but I’ve definitely gone into a place like fort defiance and not found any clothing where they are supposed to spawn or main world area of items that are already looted. 
---
It defiantly doesn’t happen all the time but it’s enough that I wouldn’t say they are entirely fresh private servers
---
This happens to me every time I run a silo, it’s infuriating already. The amount of times they just beam me with their laser without even stopping is ridiculous
---
The first thing I spent gold bullion on was the chem backpack mod.  The second thing was the armco ammo machine.  I LOVE that machine!  The free extra ammo is great.  :)
---
What a weird thing to say.
---
What were you expecting?
---
That process I thought was patched? Regardless that doesn’t give you the actual “treasure maps” from other regions. The process I’m talking about give unlimited junk, ammo, weapons, armor, plans and also sometimes treasure maps. Which like I said previously is worthless to late game player.
---
Do you actually use dodgy on a bloodied melee build? I imagine that would leave you unable to sprint or power attack. I think that a bloodied melee build that can’t sprint and has no power armor is a dead melee build. I could be wrong though. I have melee character, but he’s full health.
---
Edit: I assumed a non-sneak build. I think dodgy is fine for a sneak build.
---
I always feel like a piece of shit when I do that. Then they come up and smack me for not participating.
---
I don’t even think about those extractors most of the time. If I want those, there are workshops to take.
---
Imagine using this as an argument. LMAO.
---
I live between work and town, imagine me telling the bus driver in town I only wanted to pay from my house to work.
---
Genius.
---
Respawn and fight back
---
If the glitch you are talking about is the one I’m thinking about, that one has been in the game for a while... or there’s more than one.
---
No, everyone should get a scrap box that's limited to around 50 per junk category, and 1'st just removes the limit while it's active.
---
Same with the tent, everyone should have the tent but with a cooldown, and 1st removes the cooldown.
---
Private server for 1st is fine considering, but give everyone a separate account stash that keeps items in it for 10 minutes, after 10 minutes without picking it up it returns in the previous character's inventory to prevent stashing permanent stuff in it, and 10 minutes is more than enough to put stuff in, swap character, take stuff out.
---
It's not that hard to just travel to your camp first.
---
It really seems like an unnecessary limit on how much you can play in a day. Once you've hit your caps and scrip limit, which let's be honest, doesn't take long, there's nothing further to play for anymore.
---
Obi-Wan? Is that you? But seriously, good idea, and love your username.
---
Oof, i meant minigun
---
Want to plant crops in tightly packed bundles? Try this technique, it works with every crop: https://youtu.be/zdVf6kfak0U

XBox1 Game Pass Trash think they can just jump in and know how to meta when we've been here for nearly 3 YEARS! Grinding guns and gear.... gtfo
---
Omg same. Fallout 4 is my most played game ever and I’ve killed thousands of assaultrons. First one I come across I think I’m just gonna mop the floor with him. Instant death.
---
Thats stupid.  What is the point if you have to stop and eat every time you get dinged?  Lifegiver is AUTOMATIC.  If you weren't full of shit, he wouldn't be running Lifegiver right now.  And he is as of last night.
---
What he said is that lifegiver ramps you up to whatever your max hp buff is.  If that happens to be 65 hp from something you ate, then it will attempt to ramp you to 65.  It isn't the food alone that yields the effect.
---
Get a troubleshooter set for the imposter. My full health junky tank has 500+ ER/DR in full Troubleshooter’s (and I don’t have SS armor on him- I went for Solar, and I don’t have a full set of TS Solar armor yet. 75% reduction in robot damage means I can facetank everything while holding the pylons. Add in a vampiric heavy weapon and I barely even need stims.
---
It's good until you hear "HMM HMM HMM HMM HMMMMMMMMM I JUST LOVE SONGS, DON'T YOU?" like a hundred times when you're trying to do stuff in your camp.
---
It has been in the game for a while, I’ve seen it more popularized lately and is still working.
---
Honestly once I hit my limit I don’t see why I should play anymore and pick up more uselss weight
---
You can still get reputation with the raiders if you side with the settlers, it will just take a little longer.
---
I do this too :)
---
I feel ya my guy, similar situations, just messing with ya
---
Since 76 went live on gamepass the number of new players jumping in front of me and being verbally hostile at events has grown.  You participate they get pissed you dont they get pissed.
---
Get the Ammo Mill from the Raiders, and one of the new gauss weapons of your choice, and you won't have to use that much gunpowder anymore. The Ammo mill can produce whatever ballistic ammo you want, and then you can craft ammo for your gauss weapon, .2mm EC only use Steel &amp; Lead, no gunpowder.
---
When the BoS arrive, I’m going to do my best to send them right back where they came from!
---
Yeah for a new player this is an absolutely infuriating bug. I managed to record it happening and it appears the atoms go back down to the number it was prior to completing a challenge, a few seconds after entering the Atomic Shop. [Here's the recording I made of this happening.](https://youtu.be/XWRgVX5yIDA) Restarting the game doesn't help either as it'll just go back down to the number of atoms you had before the challenge completed. Hopefully Bethesda fixes this stupid glitch so we can get our protectron stations.
---
Edit: I'm also on Steam as well.
---
i've also had this happen to me, I've just finished the "kill 1100 robots with files" challenge and came to a total of 1100 atoms after it, then i went to the atom store to check the price on the shadowed prime power armor only to notice i'd lost 450 atoms. I'd been farming challenges all day going from 540 atoms to 1100 atoms.
---
is there anyway to get a purchase log for atoms? like to see how much you've spent on what?
---
I just want to be able to make and equivalent of a dense torso mods so I stop yeeting myself
---
I reported this guy days ago with video evidence and he is still not banned.
---
I usually just lurk in the shadows. Pop a few ooglies so low levels don't get swarmed and leave the area unlooted.
---
I'm doing it for the power armor plans, other than that, I dont know why people would bother. And the plans are just a collecting thing, its not like there is any real benefit. But for the t60, I've had better luck with distant thunder, and I'm usually the only one there.
---
I've driven through WV plenty of times...
---
Unfortunately it seems like a lot of the new gamepass players are awful.
---
Plans, caps, scrap
---
I do that event every time i see it. Usually takes less than a minute to murder everything. Easy loots
---
Unsporting conduct apparently. Reported to Microsoft from what I can tell.
---
🙂
---
Just wanting to get a little idea. I’m from WV, just seeing how many others their are.
---
I don't usually see enemies near the workshop itself, but there are usually a few down the hill a ways, then up the hill in/around that small campsite.
---
the scrapbox is absolutely an advantage because it completely removes the need of managing when you get TOO MUCH scrap.
---
Building sucks. I just rebuilt my camp from scratch. So many times have to delete everything just to move the stairs.
---
its ine loading screen more
---
If I'm passing the overseers camp, I'll offload all the known plans I have and usually build them a current level and a next level weapon and Chuck in ammo and drums, last bloke tried attacking me with a bat until he realised what I was doing 😂 now there is a level 10 out there with ultracite PA plans 😂
---
you have saved my camp and I owe you my gratitude
---
He is totally correct about Lifegiver though. There is a bug related to Speed Demon where if your HP drops below your highest health bonus, it will jump up to the bonus upon running. I use this myself with my bloodied shotgunner.
---
I meant what were you expecting from Point Pleasant?
---
Do you mean disappointed in the real town or it's depiction in game?
---
^ yes, WORSE feeling ever. Guy calls me over, I expect him to be in trouble so I rush to his aid. I turn the corner and totally obliterate the threat, the enemy exploding and everything... a full health legendary.
---
HNNNNG. idk what emote to even use, so I do the flailing arms hoping they get it was an accident.
---
*Dont worry, for I have saved you from this unnecessary carry weight! No need to thank me...*
---
That's too bad, their numbers had gone down over the past month.  They must have gotten banned from Warzone and came back here to be pricks again.
---
I go around and give out level 15 players a set of raider power armor because I need to free up stash space from too much junk
---
My biggest gripe over the myriad of other bugs. I don't want to change the look, I want to show off this chonky monstrosity I had to grind so long to get.   At least give us Blackbird please.  And maybe a bright headlamp option?
---
The depiction lol
---
I'd buy a FO first sub if they did this.  Why would I want a private world to farm if I just have to leave most of it on the ground since I can't carry it? I don't care about scrap. Aluminum and lead are the only things I'd ever want/need more of.
---
They're supposed to charge up? I thought you just prayed you didn't get instakilled.
---
You should check out Helvetia in game then. It's like insanely accurate to real life.
---
Well I'd say just tp to one
---
Have you rebooted your system?
---
I’ve never been to Helvetia, spent plenty of time in game though.
---
Yes do the white bumpy ceiling it would be really cool!
---
I have a plain 3x 4 square saved so I can figure out if there is grass or other annoyances. I have too many gltches I have created (stove through wall etc) I just find it easier to tear down and start again. It also helps having a friend or item as a place marker when you start to see if your fast travel drop point isnt going to kill you.
---
Not till September. They are still doing testing with them on the PTS
---
Nice! Glad it helped :)
---
Hey, have my upvote comrade. Thanks for eliminating another wannabe set of raiders from our peaceful, moth-loving community :)
---
Patch 22 I think, so only a couple of month more.
---
I legit carried no scrap in my junk and had almost 100-200 of every scrap in my normal scrapbox when I wasn’t subscribed to fo1st. You have to learn resource management. Stop hoarding dumb stuff. 
---
And tbh the scrapbox isn’t an advantage cuz I still to this day don’t even need it I have enough carry weight for enough crafting every day just by using normal scrapbox.
---
For experienced players it is not an advantage at all it is just a conveniant area of putting unused scrap THAT LEGIT IS NEVER BEING USED THEREFORE IT IS NOT AN ADVANTAGE  hence the fact im legit never using more scrap then I would’ve per day if it was in my scrapbox
---
awesome blog hahahahhah subscribed good sir! take le uipvote!
---
I like it for farming workshops to build up junk, no worry of someone taking it or stealing your loot so you can get a decent amount to fill up your scrap box. I'm not someone with a yearly subscription to 1st, this is my first month, might get another down the line, but I'm making sure I'm gaining a decent amount of resources for when I don't have 1st anymore.
---
Is it really that bad lol
---
I've restarted the game but I'll restart my pc and see if that works
---
Look, if we're just going to use the definition of the [opinion of one person](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8w417u/what_is_your_definition_for_pay_to_win/), we're just wasting each other's time.
---
Why don't we start with actually established definition from an authoritative source:
---
["In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his or her non-paying peers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win) \- Wikipedia
---
Yeah, it's not the dictionary definition because there isn't one that I'm aware of but it's the most authoritative source that I'm aware of out there.
---
Find me a more authoritative source i.e. dictionary definition, and I'll use that definition. 
---
Sorry, one person's opinion doesn't make for a definition of what pay2win actually means - paying for ANY advantage.
---
Let's not mince words here - "convenience" is a euphemism for advantage. You and I both know it. It's just inconvenient to admit it.
---
&gt; My guy maybe you should research PTW and it will help you understand before you comment 
---
The irony and tone-deafness of this statement is astounding.
---
Yup and I did ..
---
I paid 7k for a fully modded set if X-01.
---
Yeah, agree completely.   Great, I unlocked some repair kits.  I don't care that much and would rather be able to see my fucking reticule while trying to shoot this horde of ghouls running at me.
---
Whoever decided this was a good idea did not think it through.
---
The features offered by 1st offer plenty of ingame advantage, you can be surface level and call it "convenience" all you want but it doesn't change that these conveniences are significantly advantageous. Plus they created the inconvenience and are selling the fix instead of making the game's baseline better.
---
Private servers are a huge advantage, it offers a controlled environment which effectively means uncontested access to any and all possible farm and location, and doubles as a hub for item transferring between characters, which is much less likely to happen without 1st.
---
The survival tent is also a significant advantage, first, it's a free travel point, effectively letting you cover significantly more of the worldmap as free travel points between vault 76, your camp and your tent, beyond that the physical placement of the tent lets you effectively place a barricade at any time for free in combat, and effectively disables any melee enemies if you stand ontop of it, you literally can't be killed by 80% of the enemies in the game by placing a tent and jumping on it. Not to mention the ability to store junk which basically removes the only risk of dying - loss of junk.
---
Scrapbox is also an advantage because it frees you from having to manage junk in any capacity, which means you never have to make the choice between stashing junk or any other helpful items, also has a side effect of increasing the overall stash size for vending or scrip legendaries. It's nowhere near as significant as the other 2, but it is still an advantage.
---
Yes, having useful mechanics and ways to circumvent features that should be available from the get-go is "convenient", just like how paying to have infinite ammo would be "convenient" in a way. And that's precisely why it's an issue. You're just choosing to call it differently and only look at its impact on a surface level, you're dishonest.
---
Kill 'em all and let the Mothman sort 'em out.  😁
---
You duped death numerous times. Hey Todd we got a live one over here. 😂😂
---
Religion and politics.
---
I hope it works out, it may end up being a new install of your files, is it through steam? You may want to scan files just in case something is corrupted
---
All buffs plus two-shot MIRV= 4,000 xp each time they drop in. It’s amazing
---
.Is there anyway to get a purchase log for atoms? like to see how much you've spent on what?
---
Exactly. 
---
My issue has been finding legitimate new players, as opposed to alts or hoarders who snatch it up. As long as it is out of my stash, guess it’s all the same, but I’d rather help someone who needs it.
---
The only unsporting conduct I see is their reporting of you for incorrect reasons.....this said nothing will come from one report from a single person. 
---
Microsoft can at best look for patterns of behaviour....multiple reports from multiple people and they don’t have that evidence based on what you’ve said.
---
I find that it's impossible to stop others from smearing legendaries the moment they drop, so I just ensure to tag them quick then call others over.
---
I hate when I call people over and the first guy to show up goes out of there way to kill him (shoots him like 20 times) while the rest are seconds behind. I'm not going to wait around for others but a few seconds and human decency would be nice.
---
Bethesda isn't crediting accounts. Apparently we're not worth the effort. 
---
They say they can't do it but we all know that's a lie because they're the devs. They can do anything they want with the game they created. They just choose not to.
---
I think the only way people are going to be credited with lost score is for people to pressure Bethesda into crediting score to those that have lost it.
---
Which is why I also suggested a semi persistent alliance CAMP. And easy: the alliance leader can set who is allowed to edit. Many MMOs have had alliance/guild bases that could be customized. It isn't as if it would be incredibly innovative to do so in 76.
---
It would be as easy as a box where you put the item or items you'd like to give and mark the item or items you want to receive in exchange from a list. If the other part puts the correct items in the box, the exchange is successful and everyone returns to his camp happy AF
---
Yep, especially with the rng involved with legendaries. Games are supposed to reward you for playing but this game seems to do the opposite.
---
Lately hitting them in the legs does nothing (I mean it damages their general health but it doesn’t cripple them no matter how much damage I do). Or by the time it does something they have a sliver of health left.  And I’ve yet to manage to cripple the dominatrix type (the ones that go invisible).
---
O and then there is the whole 'rank up' bs when you just really need to rapid swap out a perk because your dumb as went to attack something forgetting to swap a perk to something killy and useful
---
Time and again Bethesda demonstrate that they don't play their own game, or they don't listen to the people in the studio that do.
---
It's like the most obvious thing in the world and yet here we are...
---
there's nothing I can do, then?
---
thanks for the response
---
I personally save up enough levels to get the cards i need for my build and then move the special points to use the cards
---
I use it only when the situation leaves perk points to spare, but yes it is useful when you want full protection and have points available.  The others that I mentioned are the most important ones.
---
Appreciate it. I should’ve mentioned I have the carnivore mutation. But I’ll keep the tea in mind.
---
No, people complained about a poorly designed and implemented raid.
---
Wait you can launch nuked in NW?
---
If you got atoms to burn, why not.
---
Though I'd hold off spending them until the very very end of the season. The 150 atoms you spend today at the lower ranks don't get you the same value as the last few ranks remaining in the season.
---
And I still do them anyway because you get scrip.
---
I’m from Welch. Running joke amongst my friends that I play 76 with is that the representation of the city in the game is eerily accurate. 
---
Long story short, Welch is an economically struggling area that was essentially left behind when the coal industry boom ended. Very low-income. Great people though.
---
Probably an effect of it being a speed run. Always give legendaries time to settle and populate the loot table before killing them. If the server is laggy, it can take a little bit of time. If you kill them before then you will get nothing. Happens with any legendary creature.
---
Where can one buy backpack mods with gold?
---
On some of these events you can be within the event area and not actually take part in the event. If I show up at Feed the People for instance and there is a whole bunch of people taking care of the event, I'll sometimes go clean out the basement. For Tea Time, I believe the house is in the event area.
---
Take berry mentats and t bag em. Who needs blue balls when you can have purple
---
Yes pls, I would very much appreciate it if we got some ceiling wallpapers.
---
The raid was great
---
&gt; the scrapbox is absolutely an advantage because it completely removes the need of managing when you get TOO MUCH scrap. 
---
&gt; You have to learn resource management. 
---
&gt; it is not an advantage at all it is just a conveniant
---
A LOT of towns like that in West Virginia. I’m from Point Pleasant, and it just wasn’t as accurate as I was hoping for.
---
So if I look up a legendary weapon on nukacrypt and the price is say 4K-9k and I set it at 3899 does this count as reasonable?  I typically go with the low range and drop it a little.
---
Looks closed even when it's open? I just scrapped mine. Annoyed I got it at this point.
---
I know is a bad thing, but that indicates that are players nearby lol
---
Good idea forgot you can do that.
---
Try logging in with the Bethesda launcher if you bought it pre steam. My understanding is that atoms are two separate pools between steam and Bethesda sold versions of the game.
---
Not to mention all the time saved NOT doing loot runs or having to manage your inventory can mean more time getting more loot and XP and legendaries. Clear advantage.
---
Nah, mine is on a cliff face by Central Mountain Lookout, but I do have a room with the glow in the dark wallpaper. (PC)
---
Oh I didn't knew that. I placed the garage first and then look for the door in Walls tab as there is where the normal one always been.
---
Well it’s helped me massively so I thought I’d put it out there. I play exclusively on public now too because of teams
---
Playing on pc?
---
I dropped over 100 plans on a 63 the other day.  I drop fusion cores and meds for any single digit i see.  I dropped 3 cores, 10 stims, 10 radx, and 10 radaway. On a level 5 yesterday and did the gift emote.  I was mildly worried it might be insulting.  Glad to know it’s appreciated.
---
I hate hearing this even more than Sofia repeating herself endlessly.
---
I can't "just" teleport to a vendor instantly and frantically buy random stuff because someone is buying items on sale, that's impossible in practice due to load time, being in combat or how it only takes a buyer a few seconds to buy thousands of caps worth of items.
---
I'd have to either constantly micro what is on sale whenever my caps fluctuate or basically stare at a vendor's trading screen, that's absurdly bad.
---
"*sound of accordion* I...just love songs... don't...you...?"
---
Congrats! I just unlocked a pumpkin skin for my combat armor myself doing the NW daily yesterday!
---
Lmfao you captured that better than I did
---
&gt; P.S. I'm very sorry I bought the gardening soil tiles from settlers also. They are horrible for placing crops. I don't think this is completely their fault though, as crop spacing is just weird to start (lots of gourds and mutfruits). These would have been better being borderless and acting like dirt ground, similar to the fake grass you just released.
---
My reaction too. I like to plant my crops as close as I can to one another (as close as they will "turn green" when placing), but not possible with the dirt tiles. For example a "foundation" size dirt tile looks like it should be able to fit 9 corn on it, but the truth is closer to 6 (or 5 because you can't place them side-by-side either).
---
What would be really great is if legendaries were actually legendary and would take more than one shot to kill. But yeah, just get a Tesla or an explosive weapon to shoot the ground with a d share the wealth.
---
We need more, shorter sets of stairs. And maybe some that don't look like something for a factory floor.
---
It is annoying, try and team with people at the event, it’ll increase the likelyhood you’ll be able to get the legendary drop
---
I've been through it a few times,  haven't stopped to look around
---
It's not great man. The pa chaise is visible from the butt plate. Like the butt plate is raised a lot. Its just silly haha
---
I hate to just stand around so I switch to pistol w/o pistol perks.
---
I was plagued by this as well. I’m pretty sure it’s the lag. 
---
Now, I go to the map and click on my destination just once to prompt the confirmation request. Wait a full ten seconds for the lag to clear. Then click to travel. Works for me 95% of the time. 
---
 Sometimes I’m in an area that’s just too laggy and have to actually move a hundred yards or so but that’s not often. Good luck.
---
If it’s an actually desirable one? Sure I guess. 
---
What I’m talking about are the scrip weapons (nocturnal, mutant slayer, etc) getting a price over 1k caps because some site (or suggested pricing) says so.. or because it’s explosive. 
---
Had a vendor that even labeled a machine as scrip weapons. Listed the price conversion and everything. Cleared it out and dropped them a croc backpack.
---
I wish I had gold. You would get gold. Brilliant comment
---
Link the unremovable pieces to a foundation that's anchored in the ground (if half of the foundation's height is not in the ground, it may be considered not anchored) then you'll be able to remove the pieces.
---
The building is complete shitshow due to the terribly obnoxious restrictions that have no reasons to exist in the first place.
---
Yes seriously, I hate it so much.
---
Im level 50 melee build but I wanted to so what better skills are in late game str
---
No strength to do so after being murdered — I just crawl back to the main menu and cry... :(
---
(It’s not like I report people, I was sharing my thoughts and feelings of helplessness and weakness..)
---
Or they should let us put wallpapers on both sides
---
And she can be the surprise vocalist.
---
Good advice.
---
All this work for a damned Chicken Coop.
---
I’m just talking hypothetically.  I don’t sell anything that’s not valuable.  What I’m thinking of I think is a 3* super sledge with desirable effects.  Scrip weapons I typically give away or drop at events and emote.
---
not at the moment, for what it's worth, I believe they're not gone, they're just stuck in the void as it were. If you use the search function you can find many with the same troubles recently, even me.
---
After buying something in the atom store though I saw my true balance.
---
They have a tendency to randomly disappear.  You can get them to show as stored though if you scrap or store the item they are sitting on.  I usually put them on rugs so if they go away I store the rug then wash rinse repeat.
---
From Mortimer, inside Crater.  He is a Mr. Handy, in the same big room with Meg and the Gold Bullion machine.  When I first maxed rep with both factions, I had not yet done the Tadpole quests for the regular backpack, but the mod actually worked on my small backpack from Morgantown Airport.  Since then, I did the Tadpole quests and got the regular backpack.
---
Edited to add - Mortimer is the same place where you buy the ArmCo Ammunition machine.
---
I literally unhooked the power from the vending machine and that stopped them from buying from me. Wondering if the switch I put in afterwards is useless now
---
A courier needs double amount of trust. You have to trust the courier AND the trader... I know, couriers are trustworthy, but still...
---
This went on for several queen fights on many servers for an hour. Many different people at each fight. Only got 2 treasury notes each fight.
---
Had this happen as a Stims no power armor strength build. Finally when I fought back they realized i keep going down to 40 percent and back to full health then 25 percent and back to full health, on top of the stims I'm manually using. After I killed 1 of the 3 players they all ran lol. Funny thing about this is 50 to 80 lvl first toons think by then "eh we can prolly take down that 150 together", and I was one of them back then lol.
---
Agreeeeeed! Agreed.
---
It's just a tse rw. But i'm keeping it regardless, that thing an i go way back
---
Oops 😟
---
Clean the noob trash. Those reports are in the thousands and mean nothing lmao
---
I did my first radiation rumble last night. I was level 32 then and I turned up and everyone was high level like 200+. I just came for xp and I did the lunch box emote and opened one and they were happy. It was fun and I went up a few levels. I love doing things with high level players. I just try not to die so I’m not being a burden. Then a few minute later after that I went to Back on the Beat and one of the high levels was there too and we thumbs up each other. ☺️
---
Do you have a 🎤
---
Swarm of suiters does this to me.
---
Ah, gotcha. Honestly, you may want to consider switching to herbivore. There are a ton of fairly easy recipes with big boosts. Cranberry relish for 20% xp, sweet mutfruit tea crit dmg, infused berry tea for more ap, brain fungus soup +4 int, etc. The only huge downside is there isn't anything for extra carry weight, but the steeped fern tea nets you +20 lbs on its own.
---
He is truly a despicable human being
---
git gud
---
You are in an incredibly small minority that thought so.
---
If Bethesda doubled everything by raised the cap to 300 scrip per day and raised the max to 2000, I wouldn't be at all surprised if it doesn't register a blip on the radar. 
---
I would be VERY surprised if it had much of an impact (if any) on average player power level, the economy and average game time.
---
You'd just have happier people with freer stash space, at least for a time. People will always ask for more but, like with the 800 stash limit, not as many will.
---
There should be a legendary perk that makes u immune to disease. Just saying.
---
I feel like I see this post 2 times a week
---
Thank you so much. I didn’t know about the strange in numbers increasing the carnivore effect mutations.
---
Ok thanks!
---
It doesn't disable the vending, it just disables the advertisement on the map, anyone can still actually use the machine if they stumble on it. Meaning if you cut the power while someone is using it it won't change anything for them.
---
Yeah, rank 3 means you avoid 30% of hits which is crucial in a mele fight
---
Oh totally
---
I like a challenge, and it as almost that
---
I was suspicious that some of what you say were happening and I started downloading the game again but from beth launcher. 40 hours left 🙇
---
I have no interest in gold. I am there for the XP for score points.
---
I’ve started doing this as well.
---
PC master race amiright!
---
Yeah
---
Don't worry.  The game is legit difficult as a newborn... then you get stronger and stronger,  rank up,  and can kick ass. Take your time and enjoy.  I struggled too
---
I had this happen to me on Friday! I have no idea who dropped all the fusion cores. It was very exciting to return to my camp and find them! I'm not low level (140 currently) but it was still a nice surprise!
---
I'm not trying to be fair if I go an event I'm going to do my best to rinse it and I don't care about about other people feelings or how upset they are we ain't playing animal crossing, fallout has always been dog eat dog and I don't see why this one should be any different
---
Not just the queen mutates, her virus too.
---
Alright I will help you if your online? PSN Wardaddy9874
---
Ok ill add you
---
People who got banned getting resources and plans back.
---
I got Rick Rolled earlier so was a hundred percent expecting this to be one too.
---
I carry a supply of antibiotics, just to get rid of having lockjaw or radworms for about the thousandth time.  :(
---
Need to join new public server and keep trying to talk to him. That is currently the only way.
---
FUCKIN RADWORMS I HATE THOSE SO MUCH
---
Every time i see this i have to say we shouldnt have to double our camps budget to make something that should be ingame already work.
---
There is a perk already in game that give you 90% resistance to diseases from enemies. Add in well fed and/or well hydrated buff and you are immune. If you want to spend perk points to combat something as trivial as diseases. Or you could use Rejuvenated perk (less perk points) and keep yourself above 75% hunger/thirst to be immune as well.
---
I got fallout first for the scrapbox, but I keep it for private worlds. The biggest reasons:
---
1. Transfer items between characters
---
2. Lag and hassle free camp building
---
3. Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Monster Mash, West Tek, Whitespring
---
4. Distraction free story playthroughs
---
5. Better for farming specific things solo or with a group of friends
---
I still do most of my playing in public, but every time I think about dropping first, the private worlds are what change my mind.
---
I don't rick roll cause I'm never gonna give you up or let you down
---
Today I think I killed the SBQ three times. Each time pointless heavy weapons. Now I have to probably take a couple of days to grind them down or flog them off to a friend so she can help me. Makes it all a bit pointless when you have to micromanage your stash.
---
I feel you man. Was at tea time the other day. I mean, it’s barely worth a bullet to kill the level that spawns. So I started the event myself, and took the Main pipe area to be able to get all spots with the AAE. A few others join that are lower level and are trying to swing at the mobs. But I can’t let the mobs get the pipe so I blast them away. This one person starts the angry face cause they can’t get a swing in cause they are trying to run back and forth.
---
damn, I hope they fix it...
---
It would be nice if we could hot key this.   One button to auto drop specific numbers of items.
---
A fanboy telling me to grow up... how funny internet randoms looks. Lol You really trust in this company. Well, you are just another conformist blind customer, is a waste talking to people like you.
---
What I love is that when us higher level players (lvl 330) do nothing we are considered AFK and “refuse to be helpful”, but when I solo the event I’m the asshole who won’t let anyone play in the event.
---
There is no winning with these people, should learn that sooner rather than later lol.
---
So y'all are complaining that you do not have to treck across the whole map for your bullions ?
---
Jeeze.... some people just arent happy unless they have a reason to complain :p
---
Damn. 
---
A missing letter in the title makes all the difference. I was expecting to see a riddle about NW and hackers.
---
You can! On Xbox hold 'A' button then use right stick to move. Lb/RB move vertically.  Then release 'a' and if green hit 'a' to place!
---
Why? you happen to ruin other people's game like the person I was describing above. Anyway sorry for ruining your positivity I hope I doesn't get ruin so often with such insignificant things like this.
---
When will you be online?
---
(from what I've heard) This is a STEAM ONLY issue (so B.net, Xbox and PS4 don't have this issue) and its honestly kinda annoying since not only do we have to stop playing before reset to worry about dailies getting auto-complete, we also have to worry about Lifetimes not giving rewards to steam players.   
---
(also from what I've heard, Bethesda Support is deleting tickets or giving a automated cookie cutter response to tickets about it.)
---
Also we now know about the Furious and such. But what about Furious FFR or AA FFR
---
Yeah I feel they do need to address it
---
There really needs to be an option for 'Allies shut the fk up'. Drives me nuts.
---
Also this makes me think that it's not impossible to transfer atoms between platforms, there's need to be a connection somewhere for this to happen. Why didn't they let us go to steam with all our well earned atoms?
---
Exactly, it takes 20 seconds of spamming A to get a weapon out because it's just so laggy, they claim this is why they can't give more stash space yet they don't bother to fix it.
---
And,,,, unless its changed, if you are teamed when you dig up the treasure, everyone on the team gets something, not just the person with the map
---
I honestly don’t know if your joking.
---
If they’re getting pissed either way, might as well kill everything and loot alone lol
---
Im on now
---
Lower level players shouldn't feel bad for not having something to give high levels. We have been there and know how much a little help could have made or grind a little more fun. I just tell them to pay it forward when the have a chance.
---
I bought the game on steam 2 weeks ago so it's not the case, but I tried the game before on a free weekend a year ago or so, maybe that's why my atoms are on the "bethesda pool" and not on my "steam pool"?
---
Problem is I play on steam and don't have access to the bethesda atoms and every atom I earn from challenges etc goes to that inaccessible pool... and now I have 1200 atoms on steam (from fallout 1st purchase on steam) and the rest on the bethesda pool, want to buy a power armor skin priced at 1300 and I can't because my atoms are split.
---
Depends on weapon, AA FFR would outclass F FFR for something like a Minigun cuz your per shot damage doesn’t do more damage than the DR of the enemy in the first place. Something like a rifle or rocket launcher with AA is crap cuz you do more damage over the DR then with AA.
---
THATS A BUG? I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT AND I FOUND IT STUPID. Glad to know it’s not intentional.
---
Edit: can we also talk about Mirelurk Kings? They can just endlessly scream at you which stuns/staggers you and causes insane flinch at times
---
 Deathclaw steak is also +5 strength with carnivore/stranger in numbers as well.
---
so indeed whe travel by bhramin then. I knew! they called me crazy!
---
We're still talking about the gauss minigun. I got two shot and aa on the same day.
---
\[idle hammering on random surface\]
---
Beth can’t do anything about it as long as they continue to run their game on a version of the creation engine, modders have an extensive experience of how the engine works through around a decade of extensive modding (primarily Skyrim, fallout 4) and hacks can be created relatively easily. Sure Beth could ban these players but it won’t stop hacks from being made. 
---
But this is a much bigger issue on pc than it is on console.
---
Nope, he was just turning in circles while emptying his mini gun into every nearby squad on the map.
---
Then between F and AA I would suggest AA
---
800 stash of everything clustered together isn’t helpful you spend more timing trying to manage your inventory then actually enjoying the game
---
I don’t see you even though I accepted your FR, can you join on me?
---
Mutant hound stew is 15% melee or 30% with carnivore. Mole rat chunks are +1 STR. Psychotats, obviously. Plus any strength chems and Fury.
---
Level 28 GT: FeloTheIdiot I’ll take some of those off ya, don’t wanna sell i just keep running out and I’m still new to the game
---
I’ve gotten the flu a couple times, but I’ve gotten heavy doses of the blight, survived every time for hundreds of times
---
I mainly use it for queen fights, maybe i'll just test it out and see which does best. Considering how i also run stabilized
---
Im immune to it. Stupid people don't get sick.
---
Worst case you can still get to Ally with Raiders doing none of their quest by doing the dailys.
---
Tonight we actually broke her. She was hovering about in the air all glitchy then she land and rewards you with useless heavy weight armor and weapons.
---
I've run a DBS for 160 levels, and it's happened more than a couple of times. Wish I could knowingly recreate it!
---
I feel like this, too.  I'd like to see the limit doubled at least.
---
Ok ill join you
---
Honestly I’m not in need of extra benefits except strength. Melee build. With my unyielding I have high enough intelligence and charisma to get more experience and caps. 
---
Don’t get me wrong. I take advantage of extra xp food as much as the next person. But it’s not a priority for me.
---
Ah good advice, but soon as I pop those three finite lunchboxes, the game officially becomes an hour long speedrun to kill as many high level things as I can. So I can’t play in a public server, I fast travel to one of the XP grinding spots just to see someone already cleared it out then I’m just wasting lunchbox time then. Can’t invite friends to my private either for the same reason because we kinda step all over each other’s toes by clearing out places and then the others don’t gain anything. (I cleared out West Tek Huntersville and the giant dish in 7 minutes one time. I was listening to running in the 90’s the whole time. Buddy was surprised at how fast I moved.) That’s when me and my buddy came up with the idea, we meet up and use three lunch boxes (I use two and they use one, next time I use one and they use two.), then we both retreat to our own private servers so we each can clear out the map and nobody misses out.
---
(These lunch boxes are really neat, it’s a shame these aren’t for sale in the atomic shop under the utility section, I’d actually get these once in awhile for fun. Much more useful than a basic repair kit or scrap kit.)
---
This is key.
---
Bash button.
---
I loved what he collected, as it was great for completing dailies, till they removed the bubblegum and pre war food dailies.
---
There was a meta for high health builds, its called Two Shot and Bethesda nerfed it alongside Explosive because of pvp crybabies. Now it's more like a Two Shit effect, because no one gives two shits about it anymore. 
---
All Bethesda has to do is undo the nerf applied to TS and suddenly there is a very viable high health meta
---
Oh damn. I'd put them onto some other surface in the environment that was already there. Now I know you can force it to be stored by getting rid of the surface it sits on that's really helpful.
---
This. I want the responders bundle. I purchased the free states bundle but I do think they need more factions. I'm hoping one day we get the blue ridge caravan bundle. It should include weapon skins, the blue boxes, flags, the barrels and maybe a skin to turn your braham into a pack braham at your camp
---
Understandable 👍
---
Absolutely, I accidentally dropped a pile of ammo for someone the other day.  I thought I was dropping 100 rounds and I dropped all but 100 rounds.  Those .45 are hard to come by
---
Hmm on the Queen is a different animal entirely. Honestly I don’t know the benefit to AA on the queen cuz she has such a high DR to everything. Raw damage is usually how I go, dps for sure. You’d have to calculate it.
---
You can use this website to compare: 
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?
---
It could be that the "diseases" are only being assigned by symptoms rather than an actual determination of the agents involved.  
---
"The Blight" might be the lesser signs of the Scorched Plague; perhaps the vaccine renders us immune to the worst of it but not all of it.  
---
It could also be another disease/diseases entirely, given if the wiki's to be taken as truth you can get it from certain non-Scorched enemies.  
---
As it hits every stat, it kind of sounds like a particularly unpleasant flu, where you feel weak, sluggish, and just all around bad.  
---
If it's comparable to that, immunity might be a problem as it could be going through rapid mutations or numerous strains with similar apparent effects, as the flu tends to do.  
---
"Snot Ear" and "Sludge Lung," for example, sound like an ear infection and a head cold, respectively, and there's way too many things that can cause those symptoms in the real world to readily have immunity to all of them.
---
You can still get them I did that mission a couple hundred times to get all the paints.
---
We had a level 16 show up at radiation rumble. I just yelled over area chat to stay in the corner and put 1 shot into everything he can. I think he went up 5 levels.
---
Its gotten to the point for me where I just 1 shot mobs (savage divide and harder) but just tag legendarys. 
---
If im in a group that has a specific goal such as leveling up i will let them kill stuff and keep to my own corner of the event unless they need help.
---
Morgan Town high school has a lot too (mainly in the gym).
---
Here’s hoping the new BoS paint will work on it.
---
And deprive myself of three candidates who are incapable of eliminating me, improving my likelihood of scoring higher within the round? *Madness.*
---
Whats wrong with the Brahman at your camp?
---
I still don’t see you?? Your PSN is Priest right?
---
Well here's what i've seen so far.
---
Furious does 35 damage per shot, Two shot does 13. 
---
Damage to the queen so 26 cuz it's two shot, not in overall. I use the damage points to see what it does. This is the damage from when she's on the ground. Also, this is the amount of damage from when i'm so close to her that my gun would pretty much clip through her in 3rd person. And it's headshots btw.
---
For me ive got 3 weapons my armor and outfit all favourited because I was sick of accidently scrapping or selling them.
---
damn, totally lame that it's not in the game tho
---
I usually one shot just about any enemy, ofc not bosses or scorchbeast, but I usually tag a legendary with an explosive weapon to get credit for kill. But shit sometimes you have Gun fu and adrenaline on and you just wipe any enemy in your sight from existence lol. 
---
Though I do try to do my best to help other players you always get told “you did that on purpose” i
---
That's it! Next time critters better look out!
---
Our game plus is legendary perks.
---
I would like to add that Bobbleheads, Magazines, Legendary Weapons and anything else that places an abnoxiously large animation in the middle of the screen should be removed too. I don't need to know I've picked up a Bobblehead for the 193rd time. I'd appreciate a small notification at the side, maybe optional notifications in the center of the screen, but as it is it's just invasive. Feels like a 90's web browser when those notications cue up and play one after the other.
---
I always think it’s awesome and very much appreciated no matter what is dropped.
---
Exactly.
---
I didn’t get any lol I was piss poor when it came out
---
Camp garden https://imgur.com/gallery/XZ8L3cS
---
Take my upvote sir, good riddance for Appalachia!
---
Do you have damage values on? That 13 pops up twice or once? Cuz that 13 doesn’t mean it’s triggering twice of TS. TS actually fires two bullets which do their own damage.
---
If this is what is happening, why they didn't let us keep our earned atoms when changing from beth launcher to steam? I'm installing the game again through the launcher to confirm if the atoms are going there, but it will take almost 2 full days with my internet conection.
---
I need a yawn emote for when I fight the queen.
---
Have you completed the challenges on another character before on this account?  There was an exploit a while back that would allow you to make new characters and get unlimited atoms simply by spending caps in different regions over and over again, delete character, rinse/repeat.  So as far as I know you can only complete challenges once on an account now.
---
News flash buddy unless stated otherwise mechanics between the games are identical
---
Doubling down on being an incorrect dumbass isn't a good look.
---
I have gotten so I know exactly which bucket it is based on the direction and distance. So I always take the fastest route. I also know where the ghouls are likely to be for each bucket.
---
Yeah it's twice
---
I want Ward doing jumping jacks when I talk to him if he won't even get his own damn supplies/tools.
---
I used the gauss pistol for a while, and I agree with you it's a pain to use. But, for real torture, the gauss shotgun is an inconsistent beast. I feel like it's got most of the same issues that the gauss pistol has, but they're on steroids. It constantly misses in VATS, and charging the attack doesn't always yield the promised destruction. 
---
I've been playing around with that thing for a while, the closest I've gotten to consistence with it, is charging and then using VATS, to get a chance to have the most devastating attack from it. But, I feel like if a target is just out of range in VATS, that attack just turns into slapping them with a towel.
---
I did have a lot of fun with the pistol. I took some scorchbeasts down with it a while back, but it's so awkward to have to keep charging the thing. You can charge it and holster it, but that's a mixed bag of results. The whole family of gauss weapons seems a bit inconsistent and poorly realized.
---

---
Which is worse, jagex support or betheda support.
---
Honestly I feel like these Lunch Boxes would be a perfect thing to sell in the atomic shop under the utility tab, not only are they actually useful (Unlike a basic repair kit which we can get better ones for free, and a scrap kit that we can’t use to put junk in our already very little stash space.), but they’re fun with the different effects we could get. I’d actually buy these often.
---
Hmm, well use that calculator and at the bottom is shows damage values and dps to the queen. That will help you decide
---
If it was on Xbox one that was me. I do it alot!
---
I saw but i doubt it's correct. I also ran the Furious and it just doesn't add up to what i see on my screen.
---
Where is your source for Bethesda removing the explosive effect from broadsider? All I remember is them removing it from flamers, lazer weapons, and the harpoon gun.
---
...now I’m really frustrated I missed that! I had to go almost two or so months without playing because our satellite internet is terrible (it literally took a week and a half to download the Wastelanders update!) and I couldn’t set up a mobile hotspot until it was finally enabled on my phone a few weeks ago. What does it collect?
---
While they think about that, they also need to consider making the daily gold boullion higher up to 300
---
That website is a very good tool, I would trust the values shown. It’s become a good standard for calculating damage output.
---
This. It's so much fun (for me) to show up at a low level's camp and see it only half built with barely any walls, buy all their inventory up and then drop it back down for them to re-sell. I'll usually also throw in multiple hundreds of building supplies in the drop so they get an extra surprise. Brings me such joy 🙂
---
now you can spam it to increase your health.  much better than stimpacks!
---
Technically you're not breaking the rules but it's people like you that ruin fallout online. Why don't u go find your own workshop? Or switch servers ? If PvP is really your thing then go play nuclear winter or fortnite with all the other ten year olds lol
---
Booze, sweets and bottles of booze.
---
is there a Fallout tour guide for the area yet?
---
Oh. So not too big a loss then.
---
Thank you good sir, certainly taught them to respect their elders.

Thank you for those sound words of encouragement

Yeah. But it's not what it collects that makes it great. It's the things it says.
---
A. keep going, unlock all the plans, kill all the NPC's, do all the side quests, grind all the legendary enemies, sell garbage legendary gear to the Scrip Machines, use Scrip to try your luck at another legendary roll.
---
B. grind all the legendary enemies,  sell garbage legendary gear to the Scrip Machines, use Scrip to try your luck at another legendary roll
---
Ok your world is full

Unarmed, one handed, or two handed?
---
Wait for legendary perks to come out every 50 lvls you get a new legendary perk
---
It used to be like every other PA, and then a patch ages ago broke it
---
My friends referred to it as my "Emergency Hatch" hahaha
---
I joined his public team as a support healer (i use stealth to reduce the aggro on me because i am squishy support build) he then decides to kick me from the group, wasnt sure why until He started sending me messages telling me that I need to learn how to play and how I'm toxic, and how he'd wasted so much ammo because my tent was blocking thr queen from landing, then he told me about the report so I pretty much said fine then and blocked him.
---
All the lobbies I find people dont join my build team it's really strange.every one is in events
---
Sucks that they don't credit Score points.  Does that also apply to Atom points?  They have credited me once before for a different reason.  I bought that red enameled stove when it was half price and it did not state it was a skin for the cooking stove.  When I got it I couldn't use it until I bought the cooking stove plan with caps.  If I'm buying a skin for something it should be listed also in the skins section of the Atomic store not just the camp section and should state that a plan needs to be unlocked to use it.  So I was hoping they would credit my atoms.
---
Aw...I’ve been it once or twice and been baffled by it. Hopefully it’ll be back next Faschnacht.

It’s a satisfying day when you get to scrub the floor with some fresh bullies lol
---
So don't
---
Lol. I could see alot of people doing that. The only weird thing I've ever had happen was I had taken over a workshop for the legendaryrun, and was building some resources (I keep it unlocked for everyone, it was a lower level workshop, and I'm really just there to get it running for events and quick xp) And this guy, Don't remember the level, he runs in guns blazing on me and I just leave the area and put my gun away because I don't care if people take it and I suck qt pvp. He just ended up doing the confused emote and left.
---
Have you tried, like, waiting a few minutes?
---
/u/LadyDevann please this ^^
---
Definitely! Very annoying you can't skip it. I don't support the alternative, though. God knows it's gonna mess something up like ranks not ranking up or something indirectly connected...
---
They can't make it 1:1
---
Yeah I always craft a large amount of diluted stimpaks (200 plus) I sell some but I try to always find low levels and drop about 25 a person and some decent low level legendaries.
---
They aren’t out yet
---
HOW DARE THEY ROLEPLAY IN A ROLEPLAYING GAME?! /s
---
Seriously, canonically speaking, your protagonist is probably the only Vault Dweller to do the heist. So, yes, from her point of view she is the richest in Appalachia.
---
Let the person roleplay. Don't be a dick.
---
That is the values for the queen?
---
Also make sure you add the perimeters of your build. Otherwise ofc it will be inaccurate.
---
Or you could just periodically go to the sulfur waterfountain at Whitesprings and save that legendary perk for MOAR DAMAGE.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong... But the brotherhood don't get vertibirds until Fallout 2, right? 
---
They're probably going on foot (hence why it's taken them over a year to get here), but some prewar military vehicles would be cool.
---
yeah, so does everyone else. there are four different types of posts on this sub i swear.
---
Is the Xbox mule live yet?
---
I added everything i could add. This is my Furious one, from the in game numbers i do 35 per shot while on the website i'm supposed to deal more damage?
---
not exactly, new slots open up at 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300 currently. all perk cards are unlocked once you hit 50, but you only get that first slot until the next benchmark. all perk cards start out at level 1 of 4 so far on the PTS
---
The thing is, even if it did work in VATS, I just don't understand the value proposition.
---
Yes, it hits hard.  Really hard.  But only if you charge it up first, and by the time you do that, I could have done the same amount of damage with 3 shots of my 10mm, or a couple shots off my Western Revolver.
---
The same is true of the Gauss Shotgun.  Even if you put aside that "magic shotgun" glitch, the fact is that I could unload the entire capacity of my Combat Shotgun into a target before the Gauss Shotgun is through even a handful of fully charged shots.
---
Or a way to swap crafted items in for vault steel or a legendary module / chance directly.
---
Being craft locked sucks.
---
work on your build, get better gear, do possum and tadpole grinds, win every event at least once, visit all points on the map, work your way through the "take a picture of xy enemy" (im lvl 175 and still got 10 open here, fuckin albinos....), improve your camp, get allied with both fractions,.... so much stuff to do
---
Part of daguerre's quest line. &gt;!If you pass a charisma check at the end you'll have a chance to spawn an Assaultron merchant named Athena instead of a regular merchant when daguerre's is your camp follower!&lt;
---
the worst part is  hit and not registering, this is getting on my nerves couse I take too much damage wile wacking 10 times 1500 damage in a lvl 38 SQ is like wtf bethesda are you server melting?
---
ive always thought that there should be a spending cap, not earning cap
---
Yeah, I’m guessing it’s to prevent griefing. Don’t want someone to hop on a terminal and run down the clock or prevent others from progressing quests.
---
Could have been me when I dropped about 28 fusion cores near your doorway with 20 being full if your camp was near the Line in the Sand event. If not, then good job to them! :) They're too heavy for me, so don't mind offloading some every now and then. Happy hunting!
---
I think it's because of issues when it comes to skins for placement items. The Survival Tent won't update either when you switch the skin, so it might really be something like that which simply can't this to happen
---
The power substations thing is intended. It's basically the reward for the Powering Up quests.
---
Stingwing/Deathclaw meat goes from +2 strength to +5 strength with Carnivore +SiN.
---
Glowing meat etc go from 10% to 25% melee damage.
---
whether now or later, they just need to add a Deck. cards you swap stay out till you manually shelf them in the deck
---
Amazing... That's one of the few things I actually want from this game.
---
Yeah. My game kept getting errors and I had to redownload it and let’s just say my internet rn is crappy. (68 hour download and I’ve been downloading since Friday morning)
---
happened today again so it's bad and I couldn't see what triggered that again, is right after getting the event xp.
---
Big facts
---
Is he really though? It's simple to farm the mats for weapon and armor repairs.  Not to mention when you start doing SBQ  you'll be swimming in improved repair kits.
---
She's lonely for chickens.
---
This happened to me recently. I gave a thumbs down to a newer player who killed the wendingo on violent night outright without letting anyone get a hit. He takes one look at me and opens fire. I sat soaking in the bullets long enough to switch off passive mode and wrecked him. Then he gets four of his buddies to take me on and I end up slaughtering the lot of them. 
---
I loath pvp in this game but it’s really satisfying when new players think they can dogpile you. 🤣🤣🤣
---
Raiders gotta raid
---
Not all players have the same target in an event. For Radiation Rumble many players don't care about event completion - its all about the ghouls. When you kill a ghoul it almost instantly spawns new ghouls. When I did this event solo some time ago I killed 175 ghouls (counted by looting the meat piles). With INT and XP boosts, Lunchboxes and the Double XP weekend you can expect up to 1500 XP per ghoul. So just killing the ghouls can be worth up to 262k XP in 10 minutes. With this in mind you don't care about the 4k XP for event completion - especially if you already have the special item/plan rewards from this event.
---
It depends on how you run it. The average person doesn’t speed run through the silo. I can do it much faster than 30 minutes if I use a stealth suit and don’t even fight anything until the last sequence. But sometimes I just don’t care and pick up all the scrap, disable turrets and kill everything for the hell of it. I’d say 20-30 minutes is average for most people without using glitches.
---
Actually very very soon. Drafting the Reddit post right now!
---
There is some variation, like range, distance, body shot/headshot, DR dps on target, etc. 
---
I just compared them, so straight perks no damage modifiers, they do approximately the same amount of damage on enemy. However on the queen AA FFR does 22% more damage than F FFR for dps.
---
You can always test on queen to see what you are getting in game to confirm or deny
---
I've done this as well. Chinese stealth suit, and sniper rifle. Shoot their legs out. It's funny, with the stealth suit, seems like they can't find you, sneak around in eratic circles, taking pot shots at their legs. I've been farming the assaultrons in watoga for a few days, without a single laser hit taken.
---
You and everyone else.
---
It's not going to hurt anyone to have that increased to at least 200.  And I believe there's good reason for it: the new Gold Bullion grind means players buy Legendary Modules and craft their own Legendary gear.  For those crafting heavy weapons, especially, this system can completely screw their character for the whole day.
---
I'd like to see it raised to 200 *and* allow users to deposit Legendaries that are over the remaining Scrip limit, and just eat the difference, in order to get rid of them.  It sucks when you have 38 Scrip left in the machine, but you have a 40 Scrip weapon, and you can't just scrip it anyway.
---
Customer Service doesn’t have the tools to adjust  SCORE points for players. Their system isn’t designed that way. 
---
They do have the tools to adjust Atom points.
---
The two systems are completely separate.
---
Do you remember their conversion rate? I try for 12-15 caps per scrip.
---
The description for the plague walker mutation is wrong. The disease duration is extended, but it doesn’t last forever.
---
What does this even mean? It's snaps on perfectly. You don't even have to power it like you do with the one from the base game. It's pretty great.
---
Enemies immune to my quad salvaged assaultron head 😂
---
Should have been an ally award for the settlers, a bunch of guys with shovels and dynamite show up at your camp to carve out a flat section.
---
You might want to get updated with the community calendar, you’ve got some old intel! https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg
---
I'm from Ohio's Appalachia region originally, roughly sixty miles or so north of Pt. Pleasant.  I'm pretty impressed with the "feel" of The Forest region.
---
Moth man and grafton boy will stop you
---
Awesome! I've waited a long time for something like this. I just haven't had the time or luck to compile one, myself. You all are doing the work of RNGesus.
---
At least someone had a good experience.. I submitted a ticket for the “Kill large creatures” challenge that won’t complete says I’ve never killed the SBQ I’m level 454 I think and I’ve soloed her a few time and killed here well over 100 times and they want me to give them proof that I’ve killed her...  40 atoms isn’t worth the hassle of trying to get a screenshot from my Xbox to my PC to submit a damn picture!
---
I want a spencer repeater to go with my instigating black powder rifle.
---
Ahahaha
---
The story is instanced, everyone shares the same world/server but lore wise it's only you who has raided the vault, not everyone who's playing.
---
Yup they were supposed to be out about a year ago, they’re coming, for real, soon.  I mean it!
---
I just price everything with fed76, get loads of sales. Would like an easy to use online resource for pricing everything else as well though.
---
I was gonna test it, i ignore 72% DR due to stabilized and aa. Plus i test it from the closest distance possible to confirm it. So for now Furious has lead with 35, followed by 26 i assume since two shots one bullet. But i think AA might beat those two with 40 or 50. Gonna try it later today
---
If your or anyone else’s complaint is that it takes 30 minutes to run a silo, but it can be done faster without glitches, then that’s a solution to the complaint; learn how to run it faster.
---
Nothing, that's the Problem
---
Love it
---
This. I want the xp. I dont need bullion on my main. Maybe an alt does but my main only wants xp.
---
That means in a group I generally try to tag and share kills. I also want respawns, so I'm going to pause and let folks tag the SB but I like to get 4 of them at least in Surface to Air ... so I like it when people are cool to share and also act fast. 
---
If I'm in an event group and not build, I also may want to end the event quickly if it is possible. Love distant thunder for this. Like 30-45 seconds. 
---
I think score will be less important as I'm likely to finish early. What week are we on?
---
Ok so I can go ahead and do the raid with the raiders?
---
theres a quickheal key that you can push (default: H on pc, can be changed), so you dont need to favorite stimpacks.  though it does use the weakest healing items first, salves and diluted stimpacks.
---
Isn’t this why they made private servers? People that want to be left alone can be left alone, they just need Fallout 1st.
---
Not that I’ve seen lol
---
Go try to start Ridin' Shotgun, it counts as a public event and you can start it yourself if it's not on cooldown.
---
Not just daily either. Loot more things in games and the stuff will repsawn. 
---
You could loot enough in ten minutes to respawn it
---
I thought the big reward for those was just the fusion gen plans
---
I've got that bug too. lol. I just dont much care to worry about it. I keep asking for refunds on every atomic shop purchase I make and they always give it to me AND let me keep the item.
---
Yeah they really happen pretty frequently. Unless you waited till the lady minute for daily challenge
---
When I began to play F76 I used to call It The Sickly Scrap Dealer because It defined perfectly my experience in the game
---
Camden Park has loads of plastic rubbish as well.
---
Keep leveling up, upgrade your build, reassign some special points, farm legendary gear, earn caps to buy plans...
---
Psychobuff. +65 max hp +3str +3 end +25% damage. Easy to get, I have like 100+. I got them from player vendors and pharma perk. If you have 1 buffout and 1 psycho. You can craft 2 psychobuff with chemist perk. 
---
Whiskey with party boy perk is cool too. Easy to craft. It will give you like 6str.
---
I'm a junkie build.
---
Framing would be very ideal
---
Take a picture with your phone. Log into your Bethesda account on your phone. Attach the picture and submit.
---
Yeah... I suppose that's just lazyness. As a programmer I can see how particularly not creating and setting-up a separate server for all platforms' caps is more work than copy-pasting one code for any platform to use game client's server.  
---
With this bug I'd say they probably redid just that but forgot to change focus direction for caps to go, so everything goes to bethesda client's server
---
Yeah give it a try see what you can do
---
Sometimes I go into people's vendors and can tell they are constantly at the scrip limit.
---
This would be nice. I think the only achievement I have left is to side with the raiders for buried treasure and I really don't want to go through all that again at a low level.
---
Oh great, I love riddles!
---
Q: What happens when Bethesda bans all the hackers this December?
---
A: New Clear Winter.
---
Haw Haw!
---
It does the same for me. It still unlocks mods, but you have to break down quite a few of them.
---
Same thing with the treasure hunter event, massive pails in the middle of your screen each time you’d loot one.
---
Fallout 1st is a rip off and if you pay for it then you're a sucker. Bethesda only made that to take all your money. Fallout games were made with the idea of solo exploration in mind. Now it's just trolls on public servers trying to take their anger out from irl thru abusing regular players in an online video game. It's pathetic lol
---
Pharma perk huh? Any good locations to visit with that?
---
Scorched Earth does not give me as much XP as Guided Meditation or Line in the Sand. 
---
But YES, big THANK YOU to silo runners..
---
I know, it was just, in my opinion, felt like they didn’t really try to stay true to the town. Where the statue stands in town in the game is on stairs, it’s on flat ground irl, the silver bridge fell over 50 years ago, but it’s in the game, the tnt igloo in the game is right on the road and it is a hike into the woods to actually find them, etc. They could have done it just a little truer to life. I still love the game, it was just a bit of a letdown.

---
I sell them in my vendor for 33 caps all the time.
---
Did the OP just delete their entire account??
---
The way I've always looked at it there shouldn't be a daily limit.  Just a overall account limit.  Like how there raising the ammo converters limit to 100,000 points with no daily limit.  It's not taxing on the server because it just needs to keep track of the number varible.  So up the limit on Caps, bullion and scrips to 100,000 each.  They can still keep the daily cap limit but other then that remove the two others.
---
Yes, but you still steal people’s loot
---
Parkersburg.  North Side.
---
Still mad it isn't in the game.  Blennerhassett Island would have been an awesome Fallout locale.
---
Hoping they make expansions featuring some of the major towns on the periphery of the state that didn't make it into the game like Wheeling, Weirton, Huntington, Parkersburg, and Martinsburg.
---
Life’s hard.
---
Im level 184 and i was minding my own business near the wayward and when i walked by there was a level 8 who had the audacity to shoot me so i pulled out my bloodied automatic tesla rifle and 2 tapped him then i killed 2 more times til he left since he kept seeking revenge
---
Why not do normal events between public ones?
---
I've got both a b2525 fixer and combat rifle. I will use my combat rifle on everything but the Queen. I love the Halloween skin to much haha
---
Xbox? I can give you a helping hand if needed
---
I’ll upvote this. Because it’s true.
---
You know that all games have an end point right? If you aren’t happy with the rest of the game, there are plenty of other games to play
---
Two
---
There's nothing quite like fast traveling into an active Scorchbeast Queen battle.  The game doesn't even register my Bloodiedness, the other players, my carry weight, or even render my character for a good minute or two.
---
But yeah, crafting things at workbenches feels like it gives the server an aneurysm.  Just trying to get through 5 Glowing Meat Steaks feels so incredibly janky and stuttery.
---
Absolutely, I'll message ya rn :)
---
every mmo has a trading system which allow everything that is tradeable can be placed in a tradescreen … except FO76.  
---
Make it a camp item. Player X puts items in box 1 and player Y puts items in box 2, both press a button when it looks good on their end and boxes are switched around.
---
PS:  
---
I find it weird that vendingmachines can only accept Caps. Sure, Caps have always been the Fallout currency, however that has always been a single-player game. Ammunition is a logical currency in any post-apo setting and would make sense in a game where you have a cap on how much currency a character can hold.
---
Though honestly it's not that taxing on the servers.  It just needs to keep track of the number varible for script.
---
The what now??
---
Alas, Smiley will no longer take my money: he's refused to sell me any gold for the last three weeks. I must have offended him somehow...maybe when I told him his outfit was ridiculous? Who knows...
---
Wow. I just started playing when the game hit gamepass recently and I'm level 10. I don't even have a vending machine set up yet. Sounds like I better get on that, I wasn't expecting anyone to come around being generous to my low-level self.
---
So it can fail again? Why waste development time like that?
---
Bethesda can barely keep adventure mode playable.
---
I'm lvl 169
---
I just here for the gang bang
---
Also great for the daily and weekly “kill x legendaries”
---
T-51b has the highest DR short of grinding for T-65 so I use that. I've collected and modded a set of the others though because why not. I use different ones for different paint jobs.
---
Hey, I'm playing this game and we have to be honest. This game has a relatively lean endgame
---
I've never noticed the Bethesda Launcher taking a particularly long time.  No worse than Steam... although it does a lot less than Steam.
---
Dramatic much
---
Ah so being able to use the combat rifle Halloween skin on the fixer would do you good then.
---
I've been to Point Pleasant several times.  It seems accurate to me.  Well, it seems *Fallout*-accurate, anyway.  They almost always have to take liberties.  Like Flatwoods being where Fayetteville should be, which I assume only happened so that they can use the Flatwoods monster.  
---
I was born in Charleston.  Now I live in a suburb of Charleston which was built as an ammunition factory for WWI.  We still have the old ammo factory buildings here.  We have a lake that's perfect for mirelurks and there's even some local history involving a mad scientist secretly doing illegal cloning experiments in the center of town.  My town did not make the game at all.  Kinda bummed about that, but I get it.
---
Ummm... really?
---
I've submitted just a few tickets but every time the response has taken several days, and then is basically a semi-automated response along the lines of "sorry about your poor experience, we cannot do anything for you but will forward your feedback"
---
I ran t51b untill unlocking my sh
---
Oh should’ve specified-I’ll be on in a few hours sorry bout that
---
100%
---
No kidding. That’s kind of hilarious.
---
Thanks man. I still play this game but there are enough people who don't admit it even though they experience it daily.
---
Yes, when I go legandary farming and server hop I end up getting 30 to 40 after every 7 server hops and I try to get rid of the bad ones but now i can only get 150 extra like 200 to 350 would be amazing
---
Lol rush to 50 just to find out there is no endgame except for grinding. 
---
Levels 1-50 playing the story and quests is the best part of the game.
---
Haha, glad to see it's not just me xD.
---
Better start paying me then.
---
There is a water fountain in the rotunda thing by the tennis court. It cures diseases.
---
I tried it once but it felt like the timer was going to run out without filling up the bar.
---
Well, depending on how careful they were in their messaging you may have grounds to report them for inappropriate behaviour - any swearing / threatening / rude behaviour could be grounds at least for a temporary comms ban (if reported to Microsoft or Sony)
---
Either way they were transferring their rage in general onto you - I expect that they will have calmed down since and the anger most likely was never anything to do with you
---
And you weren't running any mods, right?
---
yeah I've gotten like 5000+ atoms back by doing it and I've kept all my items and bundles I refunded
---
There's a lot of that.  Like Grafton and Clarksburg somehow being North of Morgantown.  Or the "Palace of the Winding Path" being in the Eastern part of the "state" when it should be roughly where the water park is.
---
Definitely should have made the game, that would be an awesome story. I felt a little underwhelmed when I saw Point Pleasant the first time, they have some things right but it’s just a few details that bug me a bit.
---
C:Common, U:Uncommon, R:Rare, and L:(not sure, but its on the rarest)
---
Ah wait a minute... You’re the same guy I mentioned in my post! The one I said has a good fixer but uses the combat rifle for the pumpkin skin. I was actually just looking back in my comment history to find your name to tag you. :D
---
There was a great mod like this for NV and one for Skyrim if I recall correctly. You could start at a certain level in another “backstory” at various places on the map. As long as you avoided main quest, the radials were fun with different groups
---
I'd be all for that.
---
Yeah I was post lvl 100 before I realized that. Really keeps you humble lol
---
You learn something new every day! Thanks!
---
Agreed.  I don't want the hassle of leveling up a new character, finding all the plans again, etc. etc.  But playing through the stories/quests with a new (strong) character would be nice.
---
I have almost 2,000 hours into the same character right now.  There's not much left to do for me.  Game's getting really stale.  Yet the tedious parts of growing a new character are keeping me from replaying it.
---
Don't be embarrassed, low level camps are great for chems
---
Tbh I was disappointed to see the gauss pistol doesn't have any type of automatic receiver. Even with a burst fire mod I would give it a second try.
---
It happens to me every time I try to go to the atomic shop. I did another challenge and got the atoms back but it still keeps setting back to the amount I had before when ever I enter the atom shop. 
---
I just want that Mothman backpack 😭
---
Alternatively, Facades work great too if you don't have the budget after laying down the blueprints.
---
Hold E if you’re on Pc and move your mouse around. I assume you use the equivalent for consoles. I found this out after a couple hundred hours in 4 and a hundred in 76
---
LOL, Anytime I had to use customer service it was a joke.  I think they have like 2 people at any given time responding to ticket with 8-12 boilerplate responses.  And it can take several ticket responses (with delays of up to 3-4 days) in between to actually get them to go outside their boilerplate zone and read the message.  So yeah I would not agree.
---
Here, https://youtu.be/QwhV9cNPq2Y it's more like a running route.
---
The video is about stimpak. But you'll also get buffout and psycho.
---
When running solo, I stand at the top of the stairs overlooking the center extractor. The supervisor usually spawns where you describe, but occasionally down the stairs and to the left, near the entrance. 
---
I just listen for the grunts and then head that way.
---
Mine comes in at 30 at night on a full building team. My base intelligence is only 8. That 30 is without any food or chems.
---
SH, most of the number stats do not mean to much after the 350-400 resist mark due to diminishing returns.  SH although nerfed to the ground still has the only offensive boost and has resist numbers in line with the point where it starts to diminish.
---
Keep in mind all PA has a 42%? Damage reduction and a 90% rad reduction to start with
---
oh I dont doubt that. just saying that personally I've never had to wait longer than 24 hours for a response or solution to my problem w them.
---
Why are you helping Johnny 1-shot?
---
yes, faction bundles should be up 24/7.  
---
I don't mind if they rotate out special faction items, like 1st tent skins and such, but for example a responder backpack and camp items like flags and signs should be avaiable all the time. (Or make it earnable ingame.)  
---
It could be a "meaningful" ingame choice. Join up with a faction and only their stuff is a 24/7 avaiable.
---
I am going to press X for doubt on this one.
---
Exactly as Hail said, fast travel to whitespring golf course, you'll load in infront club house.  There's a little gazebo or rotunda or something behind the tennis courts with a seemingly regular looking water fountain.  Drink from it and it cures diseases.
---
i have ultracite with T65 legs
---
bruh if you have a discord I will send you every email they sent me refunding my atoms.
---
You could always pull out your credit card and pay $1.50 per level.
---
What leather coat? Please do enlighten me. I now want one.
---
 I have never put on PA in my 400+ lvls. Even in previous FO's I never wore them. Not sure why I despise them so much.
---
I know that wasn't really adding to the conversation, just wanted to say it.
---
Industrial Gauntlet? Ooh. Like that buzz-saw glove thingy from New Vegas?
---
Sure, there is always an exception to everything.  I think you just got lucky.
---
ill buy script stuff if its set low. like 200 caps 1 star. 400 2 star. 600 for a 3 star.  if u trying to sell a trash gear for over 1k caps. you an a55hole lol. Although some players dont understand whats trash and whats not. Generally I think anything that isn't BE, JE, B2525, J2525, Unyielding/bolstering/vangaurd with sentinel or cavelier is pretty useless. imo.
---
Who's smiley? I missed something
---
Thank you. I’ll definitely do a run when I get out of work.
---
Nah
---
Yeah kinda of obvious when I was running from one and then hitched
---
maybe if you time reloading a large capacity gun with switching to shotgun at just the right time ...
---
I guess someone eventually would ge to talk to an actual human begin sometime. There are probably 2 of them sending all those automatic responses to everyone else while the other guy helps you.
---
Thanks for the info and the link
---
If my inventory wasn't full of garbage legendaries there would be less incentive to get Fallout 1st for the scrap box.
---
Of course, I'd also play more since I basically have no reason to play since I can't clear my inventory to move and have enough legendaries in my inventory to keep not playing for months.
---
Yeah they already got first outta me this month. There no fucking way I'm paying more than that.
---
someone gave my lvl 9 ass lvl 50 armour
---
I'm getting a NoRegionPing error when I try to log in right now, so maybe they've taken things down to fix this.
---
It’s a % of health, and it’s true of every enemy in the game. I’m not sure what %, somewhere around 1%.
---
tried it and it allowed me to place the blueprint while it was red so i did and half my camp just disappeared and didn’t go into stored so i lost all my turrets and crafting benches
---
I didn't scrap them. I went to look to see how many I had and it was only 3 when I know I picked up more than that.
---
Sounds like it bugged out on you.
---
I run full ultracite, why do you have the t65 legs? Just curious.
---
I actually like it!  It's good to have legitimately terrifying enemies in the game.
---
Honestly they just need to put in an auction house system like diablo 3 had and then you never have to meet in person.
---
It's not that cut and dry, the TOS on Zenimax states:
---
FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.
---
This means there are plenty of places that override their "rules".  Bottom line, people can get their money back.  Even in a place that is not one that by law are given that right.
---
If you are a FO1st member and you were banned and you have a 1 year subscription and lets say you have 8 months left but are unable to get a refund just contact MS or PSN (if xbox or PS4) explain the situation and they likely will accept a chargeback from your credit card company.  (I had to do this because I canceled after 30 days months ago because of getting jerked around by Bethesda)   They create a ticket on their side that you give to your credit card company when you file the dispute.
---
It is a possibility that they could make everything cost less. 3* legs give you 30 scrip each, and so on and so forth. Buying a 3* leg would cost something like 75.
---
Life preservers at Ohio River Cruises.  Pool balls and cue in Halvetia which is also good for pepper and wood among other things.
---
Yeah no I disagree.
---
sadly bethesda seems to say they can't give SCORE.
---
You are not guaranteed a  merit badge from Stings 'n Things &amp; Campfire Tales.  There is a CHANCE you will get them as a reward.  My luck with those two is abysmal, I've played for roughly six months here and there since release and have received, like, 4 or 5.
---
I think that contributes well. I never wore it until I was gifted a set, now i only wear ultra or no armor depending on what im doing. 
---
Its good to know some play without and it isnt necessary to have/use.
---
Join the enclave, launch some nukes
---
Awesome!  Thanks.  That helps a lot.
---
look at the update on my post
---
Can they at least give me all the challenges? 2 days ago I literally had half the list XD.
---
Let's hope
---
Is the top right Korean for rad rumble. I can read it. (Learned how to read the alphabet on YouTube.) But know not much about the language itself. Wish I could learn more. Also I'm the tank that runs and grabs ore. I love fetching ore. Like a good puppy. Woof woof.
---
They're fine, I would just like a way to manually trigger some of them. Like riding shotgun.
---
Wow burst would be cool upon charge, when charged it would score like several hits or smthing...
---
All the things you didn't do before you hit level 50.
---
True that. I was afraid I might be blamed for duping because I made a lot of different mutations but a friend of mine told me that Bethesda has everyone's activity for the game on file. I'm glad they do too because it took a lot of nukes being dropped to farm for my ingredients four mutations and ultracite ammo.
---
Noise pollution.  Scrapped it until I figured out I could isolate it far enough away to not have it trigger.
---
Raider one is much better anyway.
---
If you want a guaranteed badge, you need to do the possum challenges, otherwise you have a (frankly pretty rare) chance of getting one from Campfire Tales and Stings n Things, I've probably earned 13 after doing it probably, 200 times, atleast.
---
Shot in the dark here but I avoided wearing PA until I realized there's a setting to remove the PA hud while wearing a suit. That default hud is obnoxious and covers up too much of the screen.
---
&gt;Now that you know I play, make your case for why ARs dominate NW.
---
That's like asking me to make the case that the sun sets in the west. The case has already been made a thousand times over. 
---
There is no need to make a case for something that is plainly evident to anyone who plays the game.
---
Its a rare outfit from some more events. I read it's a 2.5% drop.
---
Leather coat and Traveling Leather coat.
---
curious too I run full Ultracite too
---
I agree. It would make since given both guns are identical in design minus the color differences. I do use a combat rifle and a fixer as my combat rifle explodes and my main fixer does not.
---
Dunno if it was a high level player but I found a shit ton of stuff in my inventory while trying to find my way around from the vault to the bar. 
---
Guess it was the guy that stood in front of me in raider armor while I AFK’ed.
---
No.There was obviously desynch or lag on your server. It's not uncommon.
---
Looks like he is well known already  
---
He had 39 kills in my match, with some kind of aimbot.  
---
If you get in his vision target you are done for, when he attacks you some kind of rapid unarmed animation shows unable to escape it.  
---
I also saw a level 265 do this
---
I never really wear PA I want to use and and like it... but the SS armor had adequate protection imo plus mods are expensive to make I hate having to look for the nuked flora constantly
---
It's a mod
---
I had not realized they were RNG.
---
That makes more sense...
---
Ok so its stronger than what the pip boy actually says that I did not know
---
because it looks cool and im working on getting the rest of the T65😂
---
Ooh thank you for the heads up! I play strangler heart often. Maybe I will be able to get that. Yay something new to get!
---
I only use them when I happen to be at the place and think oh yeah there is a treasure here. Most of the time I forget about it.
---
Dude I thought leaving my extractors unlocked was a very clear compromise - not crying about it but it would be stellar if that became an understood thing “loot all you want, leave the WS and claim another”
---
I even build a little rest stop for people and they still claim, so I’ve learned to live in my private world when I want to workshop pve
---
here’s a tip, place your camps on a road, because the roads are very flat that’s the best bet, i do it for my log cabin and red rocket garage, however then you can’t be close enough to water to set up purifyers so you just have to live off dirty water from water pumps
---
Oh okay no worries :)
---
No thanks
---
Using the concrete door frames work best
---
I just want it to have 400 scrip so when I turn in 1000 scrip for 10 shite 3* weapons, I could immediately scrip then and not be weighed down till I can walk to the whitesprings station where I can drop them for my mule character to pick up.
---
(It’s sad that I even have to have two mule characters dedicated to holding scrip legendary items.)
---
I lost interest in the grind for things after I platinumed 76. Now I just live down south by 96 and just build up my camp. The problem is, some like the grinds, others don't. Too many voices with too many suggestions that vary from the next.
---
SBQ should be a guaranteed 3* period. I get more out of uranium fever for 1/10 the amount of ammo. This should not be the case.
---
I stopped wearing PA and started getting legendary armor around level100 or so.  I tried a few things out here and there, the tankiness of PA is all good but if you want to splash in sneak attack damage it's best not to make yourself a walking, fusion powered tankperson.
---
What! Where is it?
---
i think it was fun
---
No! They should’ve had this implemented from the beginning! Should’ve learned the lesson from ESO. No one likes being limited on where you can go in a game especially end game. This will open up a lot more opportunities for players
---
Lol that's hilarious
---
I can't even get a world to play in right now.
---
I wait til I have a stack of 20 of any one then go claim all 20
---
Newsflash to you buddy much has changes from past FO to 76, as I often read here, from weapons to creatures. Knowing how it used to be doesn’t make you a lesser dumbass if you can’t handle a slightly buffed robot.
---
bad server connection lag or ping, If the server you are joining is desynched game can't load enemies
---
Yeah I did notice they added that in one of the patch notes. The UI was definitely something I hated about PA.
---
As a stealth build wearing power armor just seems too cluncky.
---
In nuke zones I wear prototype hazmat. Chinese Stealth Armor seems to be bugged with my build. I get caution/danger very easily wearing it. Hazmat I dont.
---
I see your point but I guess it depends on your build. 
---
Some builds don’t deplete your resources and ammo as fast as others.
---
Hard to say what they can or really can't do . I think just buying todays rank up that you would have gotten will get you better results.
---
I'm in!!🙂
---
I havnt played in over a year and figured they’d have fixed most of the god damn bugs in this game by now.
---
Excavator. Given the built in DR and RR of any PA the others are only marginally better, and that +100 carry weight is amazing.
---
It is bugged. Recently there are a lot of unkillable naked enemies just standing still. The worst part is VATS keep targetting them while there are other real enemies nearby.
---
...maybe i should have stayed on that server then.    next time i'll go straight to the encrytid event.
---
+1 on the skin. It’s taken me over a year to learn all the mods for my ffr radium. I’d like a little protection in the form of an atom shop skin.
---
Under display settings.
---
News flash buddy, nobody here thinks you're right except you, while consensus agrees with me. 
---
The entire design theme for Assaultrons is they're a robot you have to try to finish fast or cripple their head because if you don't before they charge up the laser they can potentially oneshot you with it. That or you dodge the laser, and get a bit more time before it happens again. It's a simple ass thing that simply doesn't work because this games fundamentally broken in so many ways.
---
And removing the sole weakness of the robot is not a "slight buff" fool.
---
For sure, great when there’s a group there.
---
Quad tesla
---
I did something similar the other day. I'm lvl 115 or so. But I came across a lvl 7. At first I thought maybe this is someone's second or third toon. So I waved and seemed like it took a little bit for the wave back. Like they were trying to figure out how to do it. I thought well they must be new. I went to my stash and took all my plans that weren't in the vending machine and gave them to him. Probably between 30 and 50. Some rarer than others. But I figured what hell, they're taking up stash space and someone did the same for me when I was a new player. Hopefully they'll pay it forward as I did.
---
Get your intelligence as high as possible.
---
Actual answer: Brotherhood, 40mph. They need to take the training wheels off and learn to fly.  
---
Enclave? Laden or unladen, their airspeed velocity is terminal. Atleast in the vertical axis. Ain't none of them traitors getting away.
---
If you are really stubborn like me, if fighting back fails, you just use chameleon to hide somewhere till they go away.   
---
When the battle of skills fails you, there is always the battle of wills.
---
Just adding to the other comments here, you can also repeat Operation Tidy each day at Kiddie Corner Cabins. Like the others, it's not a guarantee, but doing Stings n Things and Operation Tidy each daily, I was able to get one badge per day and get the high capacity mod for two of my alts this way.
---
That’s actually really smart, I’ve always thought about the blight as a “diluted scorched plague”
---
He could be talking about the settler CAMP skin, there’s also a Raider CAMP skin
---
Imho, Anti armor. Two shot is too unreliable. Anti armor works really well against mutants and robots.
---
my biggest problem is that my microsoft store is in dolars, and i paid in real BRL on the website... what a pain in the ass
---
with doing score as well as dailies, im getting bogged down with script weapons, im out of stash space and have started dropping the extras at train stations. it should be at least 300 per day
---
Only if the PVP and camp destruction is able to be opt out of. I liked the general hardcore theme, but asshole players ruined it for those of us who enjoy the PVE
---
That cat house makes me cry. I forgot about it and then re-discovered it to my abject horror.
---
Also 'we' might not be inclined to buy the next C.A.M.P. skin if we can't use it!
---
It happens on the Microsoft Game Pass on PC version as well.
---
Fuckin A
---
This happened to me once while I was playing NW. So its not a false rumor for me. When I turned back to Adventure mode, 1250 worth of Score was gone.
---
Being a loyal player is a thankless task. This situation only further demonstrates what cutthroats the suits at Bethesda have become. This was once a very well respected developer. Such a pity.
---
I want a middle finger emote
---
Welcome to the club. I physically can’t move most days because of the limit. So I have to log off and wait another 24hours. It’s so disappointing.
---
Ammo wise:  I invested in a cheap ammo weapon when it was announced for the sole reason that ammo use is gonna skyrocket after the update.  potentially going back to rifleman as well, not sure on that yet.  Raider ammo machine, converter, and legendary ammo card would be pretty much required for the extra upkeep
---
Event wise: my biggest fear is that some events may become impossible, say tea time.  All of a sudden those bugs jumped from 5-10 to 30-58, and if they deal increased damage, easy event failures.
---
Food/water: personally excited for easing up the negitives.  I found nothing that improved the fun/gameplay out of hitting pip boy -&gt; aid -&gt; tap "A" 1-3 times.  It just felt like maintance for the sake of maintance.
---
They could simply add more variety of enemies in each area. More effort for no more reward is pointless. These newbies won’t be able to power level either.
---
Sadly one of that event rewards is a 30min HP regen buff and that triggers the fast travel bug, literally the only event I always try to avoid.
---
Are these pc issues?
---
Yes I do not understand why these are junk. Tin cans are junk.  Plastic pumpkins are junk.  Gunpowder and flux are refined materials.
---
It honestly really is. I’m a huge Fallout fan and I will always enjoy the story Bethesda tells and I was excited to more with this game but when it comes down to how they manage the game its very poor.
---
Yeh it’s honestly a drainer half the time.
---
That sucks. I saw the fixer of my dreams and an explosive laser rifle a week ago for cheap.
---
It was agony to walk away from them, but I’m sure glad now (not that it helps you, sorry).
---
X01 all the way bro
---
Disagree. There are hacks. There are skaters, swimmers (on the ground), guys shooting out their eyes in a crucifix pose, aimbots, and players that know where everyone is. You can capture their shenanigans, but its pointless to report to Bethesda.
---
is a NPC that appears on The Wayward once you finish wastelanders story, he sells you gold weekly.
---
This.  I’ve gotten them a lot cheaper but I’ll absolutely drop a few hundred caps for some scrip weapons.
---
No worries, I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Hope you get the weapon of your dreams, I know I probably won’t be able to anymore
---
That's no feature, never happened in fo4.
---
I always wore Ultracite, but now I wear T-65.  I don't wear PA a lot.  Mostly just when I am going to an SBQ fight, or into an area where I know the enemies will do some really heavy damage.
---
Most people farm campfire tales and the daily stings and things for badges
---
Yes.  It sucks.  I bought the Raider and Settler pack, in part, because I liked the idea of skins for the CAMP module.  They don't work without a new camp, and there is NO chance I am rebuilding mine again as it took literally all day to get it right.
---
Run one
---
X bow
---
The one where you hade to kill a bear with a stringer 
---
I know those ones where pretty easy
---
there will be that Ammo factory legendary perk (assuming it makes it into the base game) that when fused with Ammosmith and super duper will allow you to produce more ammo at a time
---
If gear becomes the main point of difference between players, man, everyone is gonna want a bloodied or a junkies. Duping those legendaries will become even more prevalent I imagine. Assuming they don’t nerf first !!
---
Yea because now it's just a standard gauss rifle in small.... By fully charged fires 3/4 shoots as burst. Would be awesome and makes the gun unique like the Shotgun or Minigun version of gauss.
---
I just want to be able to turn off those 'new team created' notifications
---
Splendid.  I avoid using PA as much as possible because of the HUD/color shift.  Will try this.
---
Correct. Although both things are not pleasant. A pet is comparable to your child. You took care of it. For as long as you could. You tried to be the best "parent" to it. Your pet loved you unconditionally. They knew you as their caretaker. As their best friend.
---
It's fine if you don't share the same beliefs. But i'd never diminish someones opinion on how they feel about something.
---
LOL!  The best possible response.
---
I run a high health vanguard commando using AA weapons and can kill most things with ease.
---
Isn't the problem with being a medic, getting enough damage on SBQ to get the loot? 
---
. Idk how it works but I've considered a medic build but would suck to lose out on the drops.
---
Extremely poor. I think it boils down to a sense of complete apathy. They don't appear to care about or take much pride in Fallout 76, so by extension they don't care about or take pride in its community.
---
If you have high level friends, they can power level you, I’ve been doing that to help my friends level
---
I still play too, I’ve got two characters with combined 300 levels. But it’s just being honest that there isn’t much to do aside farm legendaries or repeat the same events over and over. I’ve tried to get friends into this game but they get bored quickly. And that’s not even after level 50. They get bored before they even finish the main quest. And the new season event is a slap in the face IMO. It doesn’t make up for the lack of actual content we have. Cosmetics mean nothing to me. But it seems like that’s the direction this game is going. Camp Building Simulator 76.
---
Plus you get legendary ghouls. I’ve gotten 5 legendaries from it before!
---
I prefer doing it solo. Too often as a group no-one else repairs and the event fails.
---
I had 4 camps yesterday, but the 2 days prior to yesterday also the rank up one. It starts to take a lot of time when you're a higher level.
---
U cant one shot and there's a dmg cap 110 if im correct
---
Yeah I was thinking the hunting one as well. I've already completed the running badge to get the backpack in the first place lol. I was thinking of doing the collector badge, but there are three magazines I don't know where to find.
---
I think the set is bugged. I bought the garage, and only had the door, not the building in my C.A.M.P. Then when I signed in next day,  there it was.
---
I’ll kill the level them if they on XB1
---
Terrible drop rate i found. Did about 30 of the daily and got none and must have done 40-50 campfire tales and only had 1.
---
You can always find a lot of plastic at the golf course as well. Just run from green to green picking up all the golf balls laying around.
---
Thank you it certainly does those things well
---
must be you   and SSHHHHHHH!
---
I use a be 10mm and shot the ground all around them and walk away with about 5-6k of xp every time each wave -  it would be tough if you had to kill every enemy
---
There is no key card reader on the wall at all for me..so the door is locked and there is no way to get inside and I just keep getting shot by robots. :/
---
Swimming, Athletics, Archery are really easy
---
With swimming you need to revive someone in water. Just ask here. 
---
If you did the challenge before you did tadpole it doesn't count
---
I'm getting the same error anyone know how to fix it I'm on PS4
---
I think there is an aggro system but it's just not made apparent with a meter or something. But you can see when people pull sbq aggro off of the heavy.
---
I've done campfire tales a dozen times at least. I think I did stings and things for the backpack itself.
---
Good question.. Got to ask them.. but the fact that this works.. means it's true.
---
I was getting 12k per wave in line in the sand last night lol.
---
Wait, those events have a chance to drop badges?
---
Once upon a time those jetpack plans were rare as heck.  Now they seem to be a fairly common drop from SBQ.
---
Honestly I have no idea which plans are super-rare/desirable short of the shielded underarmors, Fixers, and Arktos stuff any more.
---
I also do these events and I got badges once last week for the first time
---
Im sure alot of people did. It just wasnt popular to the majority of FO playerbase. 
---
 After all the Fallout player base is used to a single player PVE experience.
---
Well you guys might get mad because most people do. but i get told a lot of stuff about having everything in my vendor all 5 caps expect for chems which are 3 caps each but free waters and 1 cap for ammo but the truth is I just don’t want them because I have no use of them and some people have overpriced stuff so I just want to help other people out like on how high levels helped me out in the past
---
There is a recorded glitch with Tesla weapons. It causes your damage to no longer register on the server (except melee, apparently).  I stopped using my Tesla in mob events for this reason. Switching after the bug takes effect does no good, you have to leave the server to reset it (in my experience).
---
That's a huge bummer man. If my account got wiped at this point I don't think I'd be back. Which is a shame since I love those game, 1.1k hours in
---
This ban wave also seems to have been very random. I know a few people who have several copy's of a few gattling plasmas who didn't get banned. And then so many people with like 1 gun that got hit. No clue if its because they (the non banned folk) had the guns before the duping period. Just a thought. But no idea really
---
Fucking sucks man
---
Rectangle would be harder than a circle, computationally. 
---
Honestly I'd just prefer they loosened restrictions, let stuff clip and let camps be closer together. Probably worried about exploits
---
Yup I'm level 570 and I WILL steal your XP. And plz stop turning on the turret for line in the sand. Its unnecessary and lags the lobby.
---
Didn’t know there was an RNG chance to get them from events. 
---
Hopefully with the Atom challenges being bugged, this won’t affect possum badges - I wouldn’t want to test it
---
Its gonna be awesome , more places to visit again instead of the few places worth visiting. 
---
If you have trouble managing ammo u need to check your perks !
---
There is so very few bullet sponge enemies in this game
---
Unrelated, but... Username of the day 😂👌
---
100% gonna need more ammo. Everything’s gonna be put through it’s paces. Melee builds will become more popular. 
---
Being able to solo events is good. How many times have you been the only one at an event?? Too many times. Jacking up all those enemies for a 1% chance of the rare drop, piss off.
---
If by "solo" you mean "kill everything before anyone else can see it" then yea, you're an asshole. Realized I was doing that w my tesla shotty at line in the sand. Ultimately, if it isn't radiation rumble, the event'll be won just fine without every high level using their best guns. Use a pistol, use a melee weapon, sharing is caring.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W\_FRPoJIrlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_FRPoJIrlI)
---
100% agree. If you see 3 at once.....your dead. And that's in my t65.
---
It’s not about the endpoint. It’s the lack of engaging content to make people want to continue playing once they reach the endpoint. Especially when you timegate the only thing some people enjoy. Which for me is farming legendaries. There isn’t enough content to keep me playing for more than an hour or so straight since I’m timegated on how many legendaries I can turn in.
---
are you taking a card off and trying to equip another?
---
Ah, maybe that's it. I believe I've already done archery and athletics for the backpack itself. I'm pretty confident I'll do hunting next, and I've actually done the revive in water challenge. Ironically it came naturally to me when a buddy got downed by mirelurks.
---
its my biggest problem with this game, i cant seem to drop any 2-3 stars items, just doesnt feels right and counter productive. so i filled  my statsh with them....since fasnatch, my stash been full. i started keeping them on me, and now im full as well.
---
I have like 50-60 weapons (3stars) and about 30 armors(3stars) waiting to be script. I keep doing events and killing stuff. so im never able to drop the weight.
---
thank the mothman god for vendors, atleast i can sell the ones that are worth something. Idk what i would do if vendors go offline again. i would have to stop playing for a couple weeks and just do my daily scripts.
---
something needs to be done and no im not dropping shit lol
---
T65. Is the best all around DR RR and ER
---
Never used any, i was told mods in fallout 76 is a grey area so never took the risk.
---
What do you mean you can't change them? As in you can't remove or swap out any equipped perks? What happens when you try? Need more info.
---
Yep . Still nothing
---
I’m running ultracite at the moment but spending bullion to work up to the whole set of strangler heart armor. I also have been looking for brotherhood PA plans so I might start running t60 for a bit. It’s really whatever I feel like. I have full sets of x01, t45, and t51 I still haven’t used much and my full set of raider PA that lasted me from level 50-90. I like to switch it up
---
I’m also unable to complete that challenge.  There’s another post about missing atom challenges.  Apparently it’s been forwarded on.
---
You'd think it wouldn't be hard for them to implement say half a dozen different sbq-level end game bosses in different corners of the map so that people could have some variety. 
---
This would also encourage nuking areas of the map *other than that god damn SE corner that everyone knows so well!*
---
Yeah Im almot 110, hence why I made a new character but its such dead time, I dont log into NW to do good when these challenges are on. i log in, try to survive for 3 minutes then go for a kill, then I die since I have no perks, and usually thats enough xp for one rank (im rank 4 or something now on my other char) 
---
Whatever, its just dogshit of a «challenge»
---
Lool literally that’s me
---
Same I’m just handing out legendary to low levels some arnt even high enough to do anything with them
---
2 shot is 50%×51%  dmg so its not a full 100% dmg in 2 shots. AA would be way better tbh
---
campfire tales absolutely does. cannot remember if i found proof of the daily insect gathering quest did or not. Stopped doing that months ago
---
You could always hop on a new character.
---
Doesn’t matter, customer support isn’t responding to any tickets relating to bugged challenges.  They just assume it’s a SCORE related ticket.  I’ve submitted 6 tickets over the last 2 days for missing atom challenges and it’s the same cut paste response every time
---
As in i can not see the chose a card or swap a level potion... it just says in the upper left corner "Special at max level . Pick another"
---
Ah yes, reminds me of the days before 2013, where if you killed someone on an online game they call you a hacker...
---
I just drop scrip crap I get in the dumpster behind the Rusty Pick where it belongs.
---
Might try your method from now on.
---
Fair point lol
---
I always do campfire tales thinking it did, but I've never gotten any from it. Guess I'll keep grinding.
---
I don't mind the cosmetics, but I agree that all the filler inbetween is a little underwhelming, especially as the cost of each rank increases and you're unlocking crap like perk card packs and standard repair kits. The fireworks are also extremely underwhelming and the lunchboxes are broken, so yeah, definitely needs some work. Every rank needs to feel worthwhile imo, doesn't always have to be a cosmetic item, but it needs to be better than 2.5 treasury notes worth of gold bullion or repair kits that are worse than ones you can earn freely ingame.
---
I never complained that it took 30 minutes. My argument was that Scorched Earth is more of an endgame event because it requires you to spend extra time just to start the event. Whereas rad rumble and project paradise are just random public events.
---
Im looking forward to it. Im trying to grind to 300 (238 now) before legendary perks hit. Clearing the same old events and the same spots (hunterville,westek,sat array, the club house and the capital building) gets old and repetive. 
---
Being able to branch out to more parts of the map, explore more while still gaining a good amojnt of XP with the limited time i have each night is something im.looking forward too. Whens thenlast time you got excited about doing tea time or feed the people? Hell max level urnanuim fever is going to be amazing!
---
I go to helveta and pick up all the balls on the pool table, 2 plastic each and there are about 12 on there, keep on server hoping and you will be set for life.
---
Haha thanks. It's been my go to for like 15 years now lol
---
I do not, though Punishers method below is what I sold them for prior to the need for legendary modules. I went 500 per star and they sat in my vendor forever. Keep them under 1k (under 750 even) and they’ll probably sell.
---
Yeah I’ve seen an uptick in entitled babies throwing tantrums lately, was overweight running to a train station vendor  to unload a stockpile of guns, when I come across an idiot who stood to close to some vehicles and blew himself up, well me being a nice guy run over to help him unfortunately he’s croaked already so I continue on ,  I sell my guns and turn around to see all this guys buddies yelling at me and messaging about how I stole this guys loot, I told them I didn’t, that I was just trying to revive him, but was too late.
---
I guess the world ate his junk, but I got the blame .
---
So they all tried to pvp me and I wasn’t up for that bullshit.
---
I am not saying it doesn't happen, just seems odd to me .Why you? Why not me I traded for two a BE1P gat and a VE flamer? Why not any one of my clan mates? Why not any one of my personal friends? Why not my son's account he picked up a bag out side of 76 with 9 legacies and a B2525 fixer?    
---
Why you? What made you get flagged but pretty much no one else? I question the consistency of Bethesda, but in the same breath I have to question you also. Maybe it is because I am a FO1st member and spend $20-50 a month? Maybe you came here for a pity party since you tried to dupe but it failed but their algorithm snagged you since you had X items?    
---
I will say this no one that traded or bought from a vendor should be banned, however if you did dupe or even attempted to break the system that is on you.
---
Yup. I’ve sent in five tickets asking for help. Every single one has been ignored.
---
It's odd man.i think some folks who get banned are comming on here   to say they got banned and maybe reporting those who say they been spared..read some very strange posts with replies like"well take care good luck,I hope they dont flag you too"but going through the posts its obvious normal trades then of a sudden trading legacy's left an right.
---
The hunters can be too.
---
No in fact had her shove me off the top of one when she landed on it last night right into the teeth of a couple scorched snali's
---
I saw one that got a response as well as resolution. 
---
Keep trying.
---
You first have to max out the special perk points. Then you are able to choose the cards you want or switch
---
Let me know when you are on today and have time for serum please.
---
I hate just dumping stuff. I price my ammo at 1c each and whatever else for cheap. I’d rather someone use it.
---
Spent more than 20 modules trying to get unyielding SS arm and didn't get it. What am I supposed to do with all that garbage, ship it to Bethesda?
---
That’s worked loads, I’ve only encountered a problem twice now thank you so much
---
AA for everyday. The only time I use two shot myself now is on the Queen since you get up in her face.
---
I only ever got my possum badges from doing the dailies (can’t remember what they’re called). I must’ve gotten lucky because I got all 8 badges in about a week.
---
There was an element of cheating/griefing that while you could ignore in Adventure became glaringly obvious in Survival.  Hopefully they're getting better at banning the cheaters.
---
With the importance of XP increasing, I think many people would hop into survival for the constant xp boost whether or not there is the same pvp element as before.
---
They made a lot of stupid changes to survival mode and made it nearly unplayable themselves near the end, which is why alot of people, including myself, who loved survival stopped playing it all together.  Hopefully they can bring it back for those that want it.  I loved playing the hardcore or w/e mode in fallout 4 and loved survival mode in fallout 76.
---
That it's not 160 instead of 150 is probably one of twenty things you could name that prove no one who makes this game plays it like a regular person.  They ought to hire an intern developer whose primary duty is to just play the game and tell them what everyone who occasionally plays the game for a few hours consecutively knows.
---
lower end of the golf course. there's a little stream that runs through it. Whitesprings doesn't get nuked as much these days and all you have to do is leave the server if a nuke is incoming.
---
Just south of pleasant valley station you can build on the road and get the water and some land in for crops
---
this game have free to play quality (even free to play MMOs don't have this amount of dupers/bugs lol this is lower than indie) just got disconected from the game wile on a public team and the game broke, can't login with my main character the play button stays grey out, was trying to do a silo run and an assaltron start the laser bean and never stoped just keept going and after so much lag I killed and got disconect now I'm stuck with not able to play with my character couse those devs are incompetent with simple system that even had on a ps2 game like fxii and worked with no problem. they are incompetent to the core. I hope you can get your stuff back.
---
Nice. I hated doing the stings and things daily, but if it awards badges, I can do it for a few days I guess lol
---
I've just started to use power armor so had this problem. Also have chemists backpack. I'm actually going to remove the mod to get myself used to not carrying as many chems around - I use healing factor mutation and there is absolutely no need whatsoever to carry around like 100 stims lol.
---
you are totally right, my mistake, it was recently removed from the harpoon gun, not broadsider.
---
And I fully agree with you. If you truly did attempt to take advantage of an exploit and get caught then you should be punished. I just don’t understand how Bethesda handle this type of stuff
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhh....I like being alone 90% of them are bridge and then the other 10 is side or inside everytime.
---
Thanks I guess it will stay in my stash and I will continue to use anti armor
---
I had the same thing, when I hit level 50.  If that particular stat is already at 15 (max), then the game would not even let me into the cards for that stat, to pick another one (at least on Xbox, anyway).  I did it by moving one point away from the maxed stat, then I was able to pick a card for that stat on the next level up.  Once I had the cards I wanted, then I was able to move a point back, from another stat.
---
Excavator, and in it's original color! and naysayers be damned!
---
Indeed, I often wonder if they actually use their product as it is intended 🤔
---
My SPECIAL are like this .
---
Strenght15 , Per5 , End7 , Chr4  , Int15  , Agi6 and Luck3
---
It should have let me change them by now
---
Sounds like it bugged out on your last level up, SPECIALS are capped at 15 points and after that if you try to put more points into the same SPECIAL you would get that error message. You tried restarting the game?
---
Those aren’t endgame vents because no one had to progress through a questline to activate them. 
---
Encryptid qualifies because there is a questline involved, although the term ‘end-game’ is too fluid. Even Scorched Earth isn’t an end-game event since the game continues past that point. 
---
It’s all semantics and depends on your point of view.
---
Solo as in like riding shotgun go ahead and collect all the supplies, in Bolton’s go collect all the items, in line in the sand I am the final line when they get through I kill them before they get to the sonic generator.
---
I am allowed to also straight kill everything in some events. Sure some low levels want exp, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t get any. I need to level up and do events too. 
---
Also there is a difference between starting an event when no one is around and killing eveything and then when a few people show up at the end to kill the legendary and don’t get the kill, don’t complain if you didn’t help. It’s a two sided sword.
---
Which is stupid becuase I could totally duct tape a stick of dynamite to a harpoon. Lol. But I believe it was becuase the flechette mod made it very op. I never had one so I do not know for sure though.
---
That one has a one hour cool down per server. So if it doesn’t trigger server hop and you should be able to get it going.
---
Word.
---
I have been ignored every time. First with the SCORE loss on the very first day of the update and then most recently I accidentally bought something in the atom shop but still got no reply even with picture proof etc
---
My maths could be wrong, but thats only 55 SPECIAL points, I think you're meant to have a total 56? Are you sure its just not asking you allocate your last point and you're not trying to put it in a stat thats already at max (15)?
---
I just happend to be browsing reddit Damn thats my next level too thanks for telling us for real!
---
The total is 55 and you need 56 or I’m bad in counting
---
The thing is that for me it doenst even pop up the swap perk or pick a card menu . It just tells me my strength (for example) is maxed put and i am forced to pick another
---
I’m scared to try find the perfect ss build for myself because I won’t be able to scrip any and be too heavy to move
---
Sugio romogo
---
Gotta love how Beth loves not telling people things. Also that's why I'm waiting till 50 for the perfect storm quest on this run.
---
Cranberry bog is nice and flat, right south of RobCo is a lead deposit too and some little water areas. High level mobs though.
---
Looks fine to me
---
When I saw 25 gold I was thinking ok not bad like turning in 25 notes..hell no it's like turning in 2.5 wtf beth?
---
maybe it was removed by the fun police? 😂
---
most of the low levels nowadays are just people banned from the dupe, pretty sure they know the meta as well as you but might be abit frustrated about the ban.
---
btw, yes i was banned, yes i m frustrated but their is no point at annoying other players, just bethesda won t get a $ out of me anymore until i can get back my account (if only i can get it back) with all those atom shop items i bought, the fo1st membership recently cancelled and my scrapbox full of junk i accumulated since day 1.
---
To be clear before people tell me: you duped, you deserve it.  Some of us or just curious and like to try stuff. Yes that was awesome to try some stuff i would never got my hands on if it didn t happened. That s not just luck if their is so many mods for fallout, we are just curious about how the game can be in every way.
---
On the other hand i understand that beth doesn t really like seeing all those duped weapons sold by stupid people for ridiculous amount of $ on ebay so that s what happens when people start to dupe.
---
Honestly i expect a fair compromise from bethesda because most of us are just good players who just wanted a new end game with some new exciting stuff to try.
---
edit: nice downvote captain america :)
---
No, just a chance
---
I can't say I've tested it, but I can say I earned one from Stings a few days ago.
---
For the main quest it depends. If you don’t use any outside sources like nukacyrpt then a few good hours away (~10-15 hours) if you do use other sources maybe (~3-5 hours).
---
For the wastelander quests, if you only just got the quest to meet them, I would suggest doing every single thing you can for both factions up until you get the quest “side with ____” for each faction and then pick whichever you want to do. If you are just meeting them I would say (~15-20 hours) depending on how slowly you are playing. Additionally the late game grind can take over a month to max reputations.
---
I’m sure my mate had the same issue and when he got to 51 it let him.
---
I always go to low level vendors. Sometimes for the stuff they sell as its not the legendary crap other people sell. With all the new people on xbox my vendors don’t do as well. Selling the same stuff i always have.
---
The rewards are fine, stop bitching
---
Just play the event
---
Absolutely one of the worst things in this game. I feel like some may argue but think about about having too much weight in your stash and on your character. You have to drop items. I can see having a spending limit but exchange limit is meaningless.
---
Same like wth can I buy with 25 gold
---
Just cur6what the trade was
---
I loved that mod. I used it with the solitude museum mod and roleplayed as an archeologist.
---
Friend of mine got accosted by three bloodied dudes with melee. 
---
They didn’t survive the Quad Gamma Gun.
---
Does this look fine to you? lol [https://imgur.com/zT5OZ9p](https://imgur.com/zT5OZ9p)
---
Happened the same with the gold skin (for the handmade as well): [https://i.imgur.com/9CC1u8f.png](https://i.imgur.com/9CC1u8f.png)
---
Could we get new songs that weren’t on 3 and 4?
---
I really like this story. It's easy for workshops to feel griefy when an ignorant low level's just trying to farm mats, so it's heartening to hear about PvPers that genuinely just wanna fight. It doesn't have to be mean spirited, like when someone who doesn't even want the mats just levels the place, but can instead be some fun skirmishing. Maybe, &amp; I know this is radical, but maybe people could actually play around with the game mechanics, use melee or power armor, rather than blasting each other from invisibility.
---
Ouch.
---
200 is reasonable, which allows us to gamble twice for three star weapons. Maybe that’s exactly why they capped it at 150.
---
It would make most sense if they were available always. If I saw it more often I’d probably be more likely to give in and buy it lol
---
Hahahahhha that’s exactly what I do, I use the stealth suit and wait just off to the side!
---
I had 2 level 60s follow me (165) down a nuke silo yesterday trying to break my stealth and chip damage me to death and trying to destroy my bots with explosive bait.
---
I was so distracted by it that when I was launching my hand slipped and fired my nuke right at the top of the world where their camps just so happened to be, such a shame. Sadly they were so distracted by trying to piss me off they didn't notice until their camps were hit. :(((
---
I tried to cheer them up while they repaired by doing mothman dances in the rubble but it didn't seem to work. So sad :(((
---
xD
---
Better don't say anything wrong, or the horde will hit you really hard with their downvotes
---
i did manage to get refunded on the first purchase my guy, just check manage subscriptions and then you go to "cancel subscription" i got refunded, try it !
---
Added to the list of broken shit...
---
Wish the Blood Eagle Super Sledge had a bit more color to it.
---
1: How are Paige and Ward horrible? Paige is one of the few straight up adults, and Ward is doing a darn good job of bettering himself.  
---
2: "generally less jerks"... Yeah. The corpse cage decor? Totally paper mache.  
---
3: Motherlode can live again. Penny just needs someone to get it through her radioactive skull that wasting resources, like a unique robot with decades of underground terrain mapping experience, is a bad idea in a post apocalyptic world.
---
Over 2k here. Not coming back no matter what happens. Dumped too much money into this game with the false hope they will stop rolling out broken stuff. Hasn’t happened in 20 months. It’s real shitty innocents got caught up in all of this.
---
I will give it a shot. thanks
---
I stand there with emote wheel open. When I see the legendary I spam off some tesla rounds after using the “come here” emote.
---
If you were banned, it was because you duped or glitched in some way. You broke the ToS and deserve it. I still don't understand why people are mad their accounts were banned, they were asking for it.
---
What do you mean “wish you could install one of these” talking about the ammo exchange machine? 
---
The one you get from lvl 5 in the season pass? Because as soon as you unlock it you can build it anywhere. Camp, friends camp, and workshop. 
---
Also why would you get caps for someone using your ammo exchange? They can simply do it at their own camp, it’s just convenient to use the closest one.
---
Really I never seem to more that 10 15 mobs spawning during the whole event.
---
Fuck them 
---
I’ve had numerous people send me nasty and threatening messages for taking their shop.  After screaming and swearing over the mic.
---
 also two shot has a penalty in accuracy and the weapon degrades twice as fast because every time you fire a shot the weapon registers as, well, two shots.
---
For fun lol
---
Did you try on Saturday when it reset? In my experience as long as I do it on Saturday after the reset He’ll sell. Any other time is a total crapshoot
---
Damn man.i scripped a explosive hunting rifle I had in vending for 1k send me a pm.ill add you I'm sure I can throw something your way to help you out.u running rifleman?
---
This is a dang good tip
---
I carry a be combat and a b2525 fixer so I'll have some use for the skin. I'd WAY prefer it work on both though
---
I also want a armor display case like the mannequin in Skyrim thatd be awesome
---
I wouldn't call it wasted any more than spending that time on any other form of entertainment, did you not get a single ounce of entertainment out of the game? Yeah you have nothing to show for it now, but when the game does eventually die you wouldn't have anything either.
---
I'm looking forward to it. Nothings really hard in this game. I'd rather get decent xp and max level drops. If I'm going to kill something it dosent take that much longer to take down a level 68 mutant than it does to take down a level 5 scorched.
---
I’m a 126 days late 
---
Did you get unbanned ?
---
Badly outdated mods on PC?
---
I prefer this NW challenge than the ones that ask you to kill X players/creatures, hack/unlock stuff, use X or revive players, those are a skip to me.
---
Yeah man max level enemy's will open up the whole map to me again. So many other events to do
---
T-51b and t-45 if I remember correctly
---
I like to highlight the diamond on the map for those workshops events they will show a diamond on the remaining enemies
---
I’m fairly certain you can’t stack the same buff from different foods.
---
I’m honestly ashamed to admit I’ve never even considered this 👀
---
Thx
---
I had a few mods installed and it took me forever how to figure it out because NMM and Vortex weren't working and I disabled the mods, deleted them but they still existed in my game, so currently I'm reinstalling F76
---
Ah, thanks. Hadn't thought about that. I'll leave it alone next time.
---
I know! It's so sad I would literally build everyone set of armor just for the displays and everything
---
/u/JoeKerr_
---
&gt;I explained that I only traded for 2 dupe weapons and never duped in this game and still was caught in the ban
---
This is a lie.
---
I've bought a B2525 Fixer and a B3325 one, got gifted a B2525 Handmade by the second seller. All three weapons were most likely duped since I paid very little for them (25k caps for the 2525 and 20 of each flux for the 3325, handmade was free), and I did not get banned. The game obviously has a way of tracking who engaged in duping and who didn't, otherwise I'd be banned right now.
---
And by the way
---
&gt;I know this gonna fall on deaf ears here on on this sub because people cannot quite understand other people’s opinion fully by either not even attempting to read the whole thing or simply downvote because its not praising Bethesda.
---
This is what gets you downvoted. Pure nonsense and exactly what you accuse others of doing, just the other way around.
---
Thx, that's a good idea but Im level 74 and want to get the remaining rewards.
---
When I first bought it I had to go to atomic shop and download the tent and scrapbox.just a heads up
---
If you've got the both do some testing, you'll probably prefer the aa but there's only one way to know for sure!
---
Morgan Town HS. Cathouse, Watoga HS. Best source of plastic.
---
They break extremely slowly anyway. The repair cost really shouldn't be a worry
---
That’s the one
---
Yes! This is one of my favourites at the moment. I stand at the side one by the car park and get streams of ghouls. Did it earlier, went up two levels and killed six legendaries.... Six! Was great.
---
Thank you. I'll share XP with you lol. But for real its annoying. It not only makes the server lag, but it takes kills. Cheers buddy 🍻
---
Watoga high school cafeteria is also a plastic gold mine.
---
Yeah like all of the uniform sets ive collected over the past year would look awesome on a mannequin and not just being able to use the helmet in a case :/
---
3 Inspiration and 1 Stranger in Numbers
---
In reference to your "Being downvoted for a difference of opinion" I don't think its just that.  I think its "We have seen the post 20 times and yet here is it again with nothing new just the same old info."  That is just my opinion.
---
IMO you bought/acquired duped weapons that is all on you.  I saw them for sale and decided not to acquire them knowing that there was duping going on.  Seems like you knew they were duped and cast the die in hopes that you would not roll bad.  Apparently you did roll bad.
---
Also mentioning that you are a day 1 player really has no bearing on this.  Regardless of how long you have played breaking the rules is breaking the rules.  What do you believe that day 1 players have special benefits/considerations?
---
lol you exactly repeat what I said you would say\^\^ but that s fine, i guess we all like playing games a different way and by different way it doesn t mean breaking the ToS, i did fo4 with the cheat terminal which i don t think was breaking the ToS but it was cool to experiment stuff. Anyway i hope for you you never get banned.
---
I am a pretty lucky guy, so that makes sense
---
Yeah I getchu, keep at it, its quite the grind but gotta use that double xp while you can! Theres deffo some sweet rewards in NW
---
T-60. Uses the least amount of components of any power armor.
---
Yeah it sucks if you try to buy Monday thru Friday he will not sell you gold. It’s pretty bullshit in my opinion.
---
I always shoot next to them with my silo gun (Troubleshooters Explosive Gatling) they take about a third of their health bar, then they get two options. First option, run away like nothing happened. Second option, try to hit me back then get evaporated by a Junkie's MIRV.
---
Yea except raising reputation to get to ally takes forever
---
Yeah exactly lol. I also farmed all the insect parts so I’d just grab em from my stash and complete the quest within a few minutes.
---
Not until September, patch 22 unfortunately
---
I was reading a thread over there about a week ago about a courier who when out with a bang a scammed a guy. You just never know. 
---
I personally have had zero problems on that sub and I only use a courier to transfer caps between players.
---
Don't need hope to not get banned, I don't exploit.
---
Also, for the cosmo space suits, the helmet doesn't appear anywhere in crafting. It's missing. Also also, the dark matter jet pack skin is non-existent. When you craft it, it's the same skin as the captain cosmo jet pack skin.
---
Unless youre in the lower ranks I dont see those are worse than this, this challenge is potentially so much time consuming than the other unless again you have a side character or a character thats in low ranks
---
Full ultracite, the few times i step into it.
---
Feel the same man. I main a gunslinger and even the AA western one hits most things with sneaky headshots let alone junkies or bloodied. Makes no difference to me if the monster is lvl 5 or 68in terms of  ammo/resources, much rather have xp drops and the chance of getting killed if i play stupid.
---
Ive suggested before they should offer 2 server types. Standard which is what we have currently and hard, whete everytbing starts at max level and even some higher levels than we currently have through out certain areas of the map. Higher drop/legendary spawn rates to boot to make the added difficulty worth it.
---
But id settle for one wateland, its a step forward.
---
This is the best strategy if your mutated and looking or more experience. They both also work when on a public team by yourself also.
---
I was going to say this. It’s so rare to have the stuff break.
---
You're only allowed to bitch about SCORE and timegates here, boyo.
---
The vocal majority of Reddit was far outweighed by their actual results developer side. They saw less than 1% of the player base actually use the feature. Why waste time on production of that game mode when it obvious failed. I’d much rather devote resources to fixing some core issues and giving the players the wish list they have been asking for since launch.
---
I have the same problem and I access the game via Xbox Battle Pass. I merged my Microsoft account with my Bethesda account. Sad there's no fix at the moment.
---
No shit, “finally.” I maxed them out like a month ago
---
This ^ . Especially if ur grinding score.
---
When I see a player that is like, lvl 15 or lower, I give them like half of my building materials. It gives them a boost and helps free up my inventory.
---
I know I have so many I can't show off but I just wish I could show off my power more because I love the design on alot of the skins they put out
---
Would be cool but I'm on incredibly inconsistently lol and most the time I'm no mic.
---
When murmrgh and the daily limits first came out people demanded raising the cap, guess what happened? WS and WestTek got nerfed heavily. Their logic is ok you think the limit is too low because you got legendary too easily, let’s make it harder to solve the problem.
---
I mean there are some shit ones like buillion caps and script but for the most part it aint bad. The chicken coop has interactive chickens! But also rmb its free so 50% of something is better than a 100% of nothing
---
I was trading Christmas gifts for a raven mask but that seller was sketchy, tried to trade for an explosive anti armor Gatling plasma but the seller was too paranoid
---
Setting up the arrival point for guests is some high-level stuff.  Are you on PC?
---
Die with loot and its free game
---
That'd be pretty sweet. A normal server and advanced server. I'd like to see more mini bosses like the alpha from project paradise running around. That at least takes a bit of killing. Right now I can kill a level 95 behemoth in less than a second haha
---
yah supervisor homie is shy. Its like when you were a kid and hid from the loading screen to make it load faster. You cant look @ him 😂
---
Yes they are planning to keep adding new questlines including BOS quests this fall.
---
Since when did a mirv hurt
---
Awesome trick, thank you!
---
Yes. They took them out a while ago for some reason. Now where you spawn in at your camp is in correlation to where you place your little camp machine thing. After you place down your camp you can move the camp machine to any spot in the green circle to get it out of the way of any strictures you're building. Your spawn point is determined by where that little machine thing is and will be the same spot every time. How the spawn point is determined is unclear to me though.
---
Man you have been gone. I feel like those were only in the beta
---
Wow. I'm not that far in the legendary run, so I had no idea about those issues
---
I keep disconnected...very frustrating.
---
100% that
---
Sounds like I'm spending the next few days at dolly sods.
---
Then don't waste your ammo shooting at her while she's in the air
---
Great trick, thank you!
---
I had an idea for a legendary perk: Legendary enemies no longer drop weapons or armour, but instead award 5 scrip for 1 star, 10 for 2 star and 20 for 3 star with no daily limit.
---
I'd easily double my scrip output and it'd encourage me to play more
---
As a bloodied build it always sets a good example to do bash damage only, and let the lower levels finish off the legendary. It calms everyone down so people on your public team don't freak out when they see you have less than 5% health.
---
I use my junkies explosive lever action and shoot near them doing a decent part of their health but most of the time they dont take the hint
---
That was changed recently actually.  T51 is similar in repair costs now
---
Amen to this. One of my favourite things in the game so far is popping back to find people using my camp, which I designed specifically for that purpose. 
---
I am a low level n00b but I only use a limited number of weapons in my play so I only need three types of ammo, and I'm a compulsive scrounger, so I have SO MUCH STUFF. I camp in n00b areas because I forage for healing materials and I like to be near a place where I can do a little screws run through some homes and offices without spending too many caps on travel. I mark everything down about 50%-75% of listed, mostly sell ammo, canned foods, free purified and boiled water, disease cures, basic chems, healing, rad meds, and underpriced bulk scrap because I am so ridiculously conservative about my exploration, I just don't use even half of what I find &amp; I have that infinite scrap storage. I set up so that anyone can walk through, use the workbenches, rest, play some instruments or sit by the fire, get water, etc. 
---
That's a huge part of what makes the game fun for me, tbh.
---
Damn, I’ve never heard of it but I’m interested because my main is a shotgunner. I was gonna say if you saw it in a trade window, maybe the player named it that.
---
Me neither. I'd just follow you in the case you need some support fire for example in the White Springs area
---
Wait how does it break the bonus exactly? Isn’t +100% XP good lol
---
Yeah or make stuff not require flat ground.  The fire pit can basically only be placed on a foundation, but they so easily could have extended the mesh a bit below the ground, like a water pump.
---
the fact that the server runs worst than any free to play game pisses me off, tree times dc trying to do a silo run tree,  the incompetence of this company is beyond understanding.
---
For the most part I agree with your suggestions. I think Ironclad and Bodyguards are bad perks, however, because damage resistance has diminishing returns above ~ 350, and it’s not hard to reach 350 from normal armor. Ironclad in particular is an expensive perk to max out. Percentage based perks like Blocker and Fireproof are better for tankiness.
---
man idk you and pls don t take it badly but you need to open your mind abit it s not because you don t understand something that it s wrong in all ways. btw are you getting all nuke code pieces, decipher them and run silos 100%? because this is an exploit aswell, and again most people skip 90% of it because they have more fun fighting the queen with the server than doing the silo. Some of us are also running the silo 100%, it just depends on how people enjoy playing
---
Good luck with the Abandonded Bogtown, I guess taking it is not the problem I have never mind. For whatever reason I can’t “discover” it
---
Honestly the ammo converter is a game changer for me. I used to have my ammo at 1c each. But I pulled it all out and spent and hour converting it. Saved me so much crafting material and space in my stash.
---
You can't. The terminal allows other players to access it via a pipboy screen,even while you're on the console.
---
I love this and I hate this.
---
I am forever grateful to a couple high level players who had a ton of plans on sale for super cheap, like max 100 caps, that made my life so much easier right out of the gate. Whoever does this kind of thing, thank you.
---
Damage doesn't matter in this game. Radium has a great damage with right build and perks. +1 for skin
---
From what a lot of people said on my post T-60 has the easiest repair cost (they upped the repair cost for all the PA recently) but T-60 they say have the least rarest components needed. 
---
T-51 (Level 50) has the highest DR/ER of any PA besides T-65 (secret service PA) but has horrible Rad Resist.
---
No they should have to pay to use my stuff? Want to use my stash, 10c. Work benches, 15. My bed?!?! 200c.
---
I'm 100% joking BTW. I hate locked camps, and super hate ones who lock up their workbenches. Just have to say thank goodness for glitching threw doors haha
---
I forget how they stack exactly, but I think magazines stack after food making that 5% pretty significant
---
Never knew some places scaled level I was wondering why some spots I went to yesterday had very low lvl enemies and then had 68+ the one day.
---
Lol it 100% does not
---
The problem is they really cant go back and fix the terrain because people have already built on it, Which is its own problem realy because currently every campable space probably has a camp object on it.
---
Makes you realised why that whole C.A.M.P. shelter is even a thing.
---
It does not
---
Maybe this could be an idea that Bethesda atcually implements as it could bring in more cash. Give fallout 1st members the ability to get more scrip, gold, and caps every day from the vendors. This would make more people get it while not really changing anything for the people who don't have it
---
If you use the mutation Speed Demon, then you are at the maximum speed and Squad Maneuvers does nothing. Since nearly every high level player uses Speed Demon, Squad Maneuvers is a useless perk to share.
---
You and me both sir. Honestly my favorite spot, if I’m just farming is when the bucket is right next to the terminal. Sit on top of the lion and one shot them all... Second favorite is probably second story theater, when they spawn behind the section of seating
---
what's that ini tweak to merge the pools? i have the same problem
---
Tuesday makes end of week 3 and I think 40 is pace end of week
---
I stick with a battle axe. No bullets needed 😉
---
Agreed.
---
I believe the default spawn point is maybe 25 or so feet north of the CAMP. Not sure if CAMP module has to face a certain direction though. And if that spawn point is being interfered with (under attack or your ally walking through it at the moment you travel maybe?) you can spawn at a different point, tho I’ve found the “north of” quite reliable.
---
Why would it?
---
Oh really? Well then I guess t51 is the best choice now.
---
Usually at low level camps, when they're selling things that are clearly of little value, I'll buy them and then just drop them back on the ground infront of the machine
---
I can absolutely show you around the wasteland my dude. I mainline Xbox but I have it for PC. I think it'd be fun to partner up with a new toon. Tag: Strakeg6
---
Now if only I could cook with it :/
---
Usually rifleman builds are sneaky and go for VATs criticals. Consider adding the Sneak perk and maxing out Covert Operatives and Mister Sandman. If you are going for a VATs build, add Critical Savvy.
---
He is one of the most obnoxious things I've ever heard.
---
Glad someone likes him though.
---
That’s just P2W they also run the risk of losing even more of their player base besides Fo1 is meant to be cosmetic only
---
Once it hits 100% it seems to give no bonus whatsoever. 75% works fine, but it is broken at 100%. This is a real problem too since lunchbox bonuses go to everyone near the person who opens them, which can throw you up to 100% easily.
---
Instead of capping at 100%, it reduces the effect back down to 0%.
---
It's quite annoying.  People are usually opening lunchboxes just to be nice, especially when they see others doing it, but it breaks the effect.  Very poor implementation on Bethesda's part.
---
Right on the D-Pad for consoles.
---
Yea me too. I even have a raider set lol I like that they added jet packs for all of them now.
---
Is there a place to obtain screws?
---
Also laser weapons scrap for around 10 plastic when scrapper perk is equipped.
---
There's been a lot of reports of bugged challenges so I wouldn't rush in to that.
---
No but I’d love if that would be a featured
---
I’m lvl 60 rn. I’m id say once. I’m lvl 100 I’ll start consistently helping low level players
---
But it already isn't and never really was (thats the atom store). They already have the stash box that basically makes your stash size larger so why not just say f it and increase the rest. What difference will it make to everyone else who doesn't have it?
---
Having played both console and pc versions I am really enjoying the pc version a ton more. Just installed perk load out manager a week ago and it is tremendously helpful.
---
Plus my load times are amazing. And aiming with my mouse is great.
---
If someone is hacking that’s unfortunate. I just leave and play again or go to adventure mode.
---
That said, I had a great time on console. Just a better time on pc. Can’t play on console anymore because I’m selling it all in prep for next gen!
---
I also moved from console to pc for destiny 2 and the gun play was much better. Then I lost interest!
---
Thanks for the replys I know it was a long shot but it just looks way cooler than the current Dull boring Skins for the Gauss minigun
---
I've done this countless times when I'm near full capacity on caps
---
It also has a bug and uses a low poly texture in first person - the spade symbol looks very bad... Stick to chromium, that's what I'm doing.
---
Also - it's only for the 5mm minigun.
---
Yeah I think I always spawn about 4 floor camp pieces north of where I placed my camp module. There's been a few times I loaded in at a slightly different spot but my turrets are always going off when that happens.
---
lol, 76 summed up
---
‘Glitcher’ ‘Hacker’...my kids favorite words used repeatedly while playing Fortnite.  He’s 9 btw.  It got so bad one day I told him if he said either word again he was done playing for the day.
---
Sounds good.  Just wanted to make sure it wasn't the result of some weird mod conflict.  Too bad.  It's a neat looking skin, but essentially useless.
---
I just noticed your mutation section. Consider adding empath to boost your tankiness. This mutation counts you as a team member, so there is no downside provided you are on a team. With Class Freak to reduce the negative effect, you get damage reduction from your own mutation.
---
Consider adding Speed Demon. Since food is plentiful, the side effect is nothing and the benefits are amazing.
---
What does the skin do?
---
Don’t blame the team but the management and company as a whole for it.
---
What kind of ammo you use ?
---
Sound more like shitty Internet. I very rarely dc. Can't remember the last time it happened
---
I love the nukashine one alot
---
I totally agree. I made a similar post yesterday, but it was downvoted to oblivion, even with a nice discussion ongoing... Why they haven't hotfixed this yet is beyond me. Sucks big time!
---
those only existed for camps in BETA. they can still be used at workshops though.
---
I also don't use my strangler heart anymore so id like to display it even of its easier to get now and duped to hell
---
I wouldn't count on it
---
Angryturtle. You want Angryturtle
---
I had a guy in the upper 200 range drop so many plans that i had to walk back to my camp. Soo many plans.
---
only if you change servers do they reset from what i have seen
---
Oh do the challenges give you atomic points? I wasn't going because I thought they just gave low level loot and some xp
---
So you wasted part of your money. Have you tried a refund?
---
More guns is different to more junk
---
You on Xbox? If so how much?
---
300mb download and 20mb(or was 50 don't remember) upload I wish it was bad internet it would be an easy fix, just got dced in the same place in the end of the silo again, this game is bad and the devs are incompetent.
---
Or just farm the power plants free and easy cores there🤷‍♂️
---
Absolutely.
---
Best solos: Guided Meditation, Radiation Rumble, Line in the Sand.
---
Any others?
---
Surface to Air seems to vary, sometimes I get back to back scorched beasts, sometimes it's boring.
---
Ooh. That sounds fun!
---
Are you looking for people who post gameplay footage of them playing 76 or just videos about the game in general? Either way, I highly recommend Angry Turtle on YouTube who, imo, is the most informative 76 YouTuber out there. He makes build videos, in-depth breakdowns of the mechanics, and live streams on YT about once a week. I've learned so much about the game from him.
---
Exactly, the stage is already set for such an event we just need Bethesda to put it to work. Hmm maybe they are having band practice in the basement...
---
I never know with this game it might have just worked by "magic"
---
The various junk non-usable instruments (steel guitar, banjo, accordion, etc.) would be great to display on the walls too.
---
Angryturtle ,captainoob
---
I usually wait until people go then I'll go.
---
I really have no idea why people downvote bug reports.  That’s beyond me.  It sucks especially since Lunchboxes are quite limited as of right now and it’s a double XP weekend.  This bug is turning me off from even sharing my Lunchboxes with other players.
---
I tried using a random TSE combat rifle I picked up earlier in the day.  Damn thing broke after about 5 waves. 
---
Don't know about the whole "shhh" thing though.  Haven't been to one where this wasn't going on for at least a month.  Pretty sure they know about it by now.
---
We do. There are quite a few more songs than were in either 3 or 4
---
Wanted. Game Testers.
---
"Moooooo"
---
Both really. That's three recommendations in quick succession so I'll definitely check him out.
---
The non-daily and weekly challenges do.
---
Cool, haven't heard of captainoob. Thanks!
---
Evidently holding three points is too difficult for much of the playerbase.
---
Some do. The dailies and weeklies only give score but all the others are for atoms.
---
you'd be surprised at the number of people i've grouped with who aren't even mutated at all. Also. not everyone who plays is high level.
---
This is my exact CHA loadout. Though I will switch out Inspirational for Friendly Fire during specific events like Rad Rumble, Proj Paradise, or Free Range because I like to be the hero of an event sometimes.
---
Full T65. Just for the bragging rights.
---
I'm in the same boat and feel exactly the same way. I got it twice yesterday on two characters in a row (was doing SBQs). Both times lots of lunchboxes were opened. I said "screw it" and stopped playing... I wasted two lunchboxes (one per chat) and it was such a discouraging experience... So much XP lost... 😑
---
same all my atoms i earned are just gone 600 something just "poof" gone
---
Are you saying a majority of the player base wouldn't switch to a mode that gives them +50% experience?  Even I, who loved survival mode at times completely stopped playing it as every update they did they slowly destroyed it.  Plus it was not enjoyable getting hunted down by the whole map of hackers just for successfully defending yourself.
---
 I usually wait until people go then I'll go.
---
wait a minute...
---
yep
---
I have some for sale or trade if your on ps4
---
Keep the video lol. "they started it".
---
45, 50 and 556 mostly
---
Toy cars and trucks are good sources. The water park and the fair grounds have a bunch of toys. I think Camden park is good, too.
---
Yeah I was comparing what it said in the wiki and I thought T60 too.  But it’s outdated.  Now, T60 requires black titanium to repair, whereas T51 does not.  It’s basically even now for mat costs.  
---
I’d say t51 is the better option simply for the DR.  I opted to mix and match parts between the too as I had already modded a jet pack on my T60 torso
---
Current repairs: 
---
T60 Leg 
---
Black Tit - 6
---
Screws - 6
---
Silver - 6
---
Oil - 6
---
Gears - 6
---
Aluminum - 6
---
Plastic - 6
---
Steel - 11
---
T51 Leg
---
Screws - 11
---
Plastic - 8
---
Steel - 20
---
Few people know the mechanic for the event
---
Phase 1 gather as much fee as possible ( the more feed the strongest the friendly creatures that spawn
---
Phase 2 Protect the friendly creatures in each zone 
---
The layout can be a bit confusing I think
---
I didn't know mcdonalds gave free hamburgers.
---
On now
---
You look like Big Bird! 
---
I'm joking, I live in Excavator but only because I'm lazy and constantly mining ore. Excavator and Vampires UGL is the hallmark of a truly lazy person.
---
Pfft, only time I ever bother with workshops is when they're part of the challenges. Otherwise they can suck it. Not worth the effort.
---
Until they poo berry mentats
---
But you can fit more guns in your stash if you put the 300+ lbs of junk in the scrapbox
---
Correct, that is what I am saying. People didn’t like the mode for a variety of reasons. As I said just because  people here are vocal that they liked it the evidence is quite the contrary to the rest of the player base.
---
I know sugar grove has a lot of fans for screws and battered clipboards for springs. 
---
Here’s a list of good farming spots:
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic#h.p14wcsgx9tkk
---
Spongiest one I run into outside of Encryptid and Scorched Earth is the sheepsquatch, and with my Bloodied Gauss mini, he’s not that threatening anymore lol
---
Just can't be bothered to clear the ads and start quest. I'll let someone else do it.
---
It's faster to just farm on your own :\\
---
Yes, this is INFURIATING. As is the illogical thing where if I want to change one part of my deck, I have to dismantle the whole thing because it's actually made of "upper flooring". Or the "floating" error where there is literally no difference between that spot and one an inch over but one is wrong and one is not. 
---
FYI, the Log Cabin hasn't been bad but it might be because it's small? It is incredibly irritating that it has no snap points. I don't know why they did this, since I can put it down but then I can't get to it and struggle to build around it. I've had better luck making tiny outbuildings out of the base options and blueprinting them, then dropping them and putting a couple foundation pieces in between to make them cohesive. 
---
The lack of lower flooring options in terms of shape and size is really, really prohibitive. They need to bring in 1x1, 1x2, and even some triangle/quarter-circle pieces. 
---
Agreed on the soil tiles, they were terrible in FO4 as well and I only ever used them because I could cheat and shove a pump into one even on concrete. :p Your solution about them being borderless is right on. I'm not sure there's any reason they couldn't make it so that the frame disappeared between tiles if you interlock them but appeared around the edges? 
---
I also miss those wooden post foundations from FO4, which look way more like a knockdown construction than these concrete and post things we have now. And bridge/walkway pieces -- I would kill to have that little dock/bridge piece back. I can't believe I can't build even a rickety bridge of my own. It would be great for connecting areas of a camp and would stop me from having to build elaborate pathways to keep my ally from falling into the river and getting stuck down there.
---
Got a lot of recommendations for him, definitely checking him out. Thanks a lot.
---
Remember when people just sold trash legendaries to vendors or dropped them because the purveyor didn’t even exist?  Those were the days...
---
But you having the chance to spend and earn more scrips is P2W you have unlimited junk won’t affect the game and this would also allow all fo1 members to basically control the market because they have more chances etc etc
---
No problem. I use it to stock up since I tend to tun out of screws and aluminum.
---
I loved the \*idea\* of the vault raids, and they were certainly a challenge, but the instancing tech and the lag made them far more frustrating than they should have been. I'd like to see them return with V96 now that the wastelander's instancing seems to be more stable
---
Don't think I've ever changed my camp since I settled on a location in the first month! Don't think I'll ever move.
---
The campfire event, the stings and things daily and the operation tidy daily all have a chance of dropping a possom badge. Takes 5 - 10 times to get a badge drop though.
---
Newsflash buddy people downvote anti duping posts too, that doesn’t make dupers look any good. But I’m not gonna stop you when you try to please yourself. It’s not too hard to beat and one of the few worthy enemies left, and the firing mechanism is perfectly justified for a top of the line military robot. But if fools like yourself find a nerf is absolutely necessary you can whine all day long and maybe Beth will even listen. Alternatively you can keep playing FO4 and leave 76 alone.
---
Lool I didn’t play then
---
He didn't sell me anything yesterday (Sat). I'll give him another try today.
---
My favorite thing to do is buy them out then scrap it all and turn it into various levels of fixers and recon rifles and ammo.
---
This post is not totally true, I unlocked it a while back. Whislt it doesn't show in your camp true, your wrong about the not showing as a vendor on map. My vendors are busy and working same as always
---
Please tell me that you've had conversations with him. There's so much more to it than just the generic idle lines
---
Finally got the liberty prime skin for ultra, so now mine looks even more badass.
---
I really never had those issues
---
I think I would let them all surround me, pull out my two-shot fat man (currently over 5600 damage, aim it at the ground, and see if Serendipity saves me.
---
&gt;Does anything ~~new from the season~~ work right?
---
At this point, it's no longer a game with bugs and flaws.  It's a big pile of bugs that happens to have a game inside.
---
I'm there with you in a sense, the old survival mode ended up being garbage, but you're crazy if you think people wouldn't play it right now.  XP is everything and people would risk losing aid/junk just for that buff.  However, I'm not saying they should bring it back as it was.
---
I did that with 2mm while I was crafting gauss weapons. With the random calibers I pick up, hopefully someone wants it. At 1000+ it will go that route.
---
Went to them via the support on Bethesda.net and I used the category along the lines of "Problem purchasing with Atoms". They changed it to "I have an issue with a challenge", but I didn't see that on the list.
---
It's a daft issue that is obviously part of their hotfix. So I currently have Atoms sitting on two versions of the game even though I *only* have the game via Gamepass. They escalated the ticket currently and have manually added some of the Atoms.
---
But these are the people who have yet to fix the NoRegionPing error when all that is is that the game is deleting an INI file in your My Games folder and if you set that to read only when you launch it's fixed. Not sure what they are up to. Kind of wonder when the game is coming out of "beta" at this point.
---
Oh yes. That's another reason I love him so much. Especially when you ask him to sing you the song of his people.
---
I'm usually the one that gets to say that about the rest of the game but that was certainly my experience with the raids
---
Well, my partner and I used a similar strategy. We were lucky enough to keep finding ourselves placed in the safe zone, high on the cliffs in Morgantown. We were able to take out groups of two or three at a time. One guy I killed dropped a duffle with 250 rounds of .45. That saved me right there. Was able to take out the SB that showed up.
---
You need to compete all 3 areas successfully to get the good rewards. Most events I can solo, but while I can solo one of the areas in PP, I can not do all 3 by myself. I feel like a lot of people feel this way don’t bother going there which means others won’t join either.
---
Additionally even when people do join they have no idea what’s going on. I sometimes see a bunch of people there but they all do only one of the areas. And someone STILL let the friendly creature die.
---
how did you do the flags on the raised platforms? i have a similar camp but it looks less shipy and more housy
---
Great job, very impressive and creative.  Captain Ironsides would approve.
---
If you're on PC there's a mod for that:
---
[Original Game Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/451)
---
Not tried it myself as i'm only ever on the menu for a few seconds, but there ya go.
---
Yes!  Especially when things go weird and I have to sit through 40 levels of 'rank up' from scratch, with blank boxes of things I've "unlocked".
---
I usually have good luck at the Morgantown airport inside the building.
---
Ammo factory?
---
I'm first generation born outside of WV in my family.  From Barbour Co.  Been there many times and am looking forward to moving back.
---
I just hate when someone low level (I've never had someone higher level than me do this) gets in my face with emotes and their weapon out and the crouch bounce (wtf is that for anyway?) and when I try to just ignore them, they start shooting at me. Not that it does any damage if I've got pacifist on, but it does tend to move my character around. Sadly, the last one was level 4, so I couldn't return the favor.
---
Lmao.  I've been in there with 10 random players split between all the habitats thinking "we've got this".
---
30 seconds in and one of the creatures is dead.  Seriously, what the hell were you doing over there?
---
Group of 4 people searching different areas should kick up more 3* legendary shots. Also the double XP should make it worthwhile.
---
295 is barely a start for the legendary perk system that is coming.
---
Well that is kinda the opposite point you are making. You said bring back the mode right now, that implies the same way it was when it was scrapped. 
---
If they made changes I would absolutely be first one the train to try the mode, but the mode was hot garbage and the player count reflected that. Idc how much exp I would gain, it would not be worth it.
---
They did the same thing for me - changed my response from atomic shop purchase to challenges.  But I never got ahold of anyone beyond the generic response
---
How did you escalate it?
---
Cool.  Mutated, but running full health.  I knee I could count on you guys.
---
Sorry had a brain lapse. Just think something other than rafters would be nice.
---
No popcorn ceiling crap though,
---
None of the results would answer his question.
---
Because players are lazy and only go there to do pew pew or leech exp
---
I’m hoping they extend the double xp by a day since all I’m getting is server timeout and disconnects all damn day
---
I got that and super duper. I’ll have to invest more time on the junk grind
---
I tend to swap between one wave with Tesla, next with explosive pistol or garlic and back again afterwards.
---
I’m from Virginia, and I lived most of my life roughly 45 minutes away from the border of WV-VA, and the Forest feels very accurate. Nice rolling hills, lots of trees, and a nice view of the sky.
---
Keep trying is all I can say. I sent links to all of the Reddit and forum complaints about this exact issue, so that's probably why they escalated me. But we'll see if that pays out. Right now I have to contact them each time I get a challenge.
---
Most people just want to farm the xp and legendarys. The rewards from the event arnt super great, and many might have them already. But you can get a ton of xp just farming the hoard
---
I have a raider set and even put a jet pack on it, but despite having like 9 different paint jobs not a single one works on it. Raider PA needs some love.
---
Angryturtle, riflergaming, WickedyChickady, InnovSurvivalist
---
AngryTurtle is king, but InnovSurvivalist has some really good guides and updates about the game
---
Sad stuff
---
So if your girl or child has an char on your account and uses all you are screwed?
---
As others have mentioned there's lots of advantages to private servers.
---
Right now I'm getting low on fusion cores so I will probably hop on a private, take over all three power plants and farm cores for a few hours.  While waiting for the cores to build up I can loot some of my favorite spots.
---
Did you get a letter telling you to apologize and then asked how you did it? 😆
---
Can't say I've ever gotten a drop from campfire tales, but maybe doing the dailies will.
---
Yeah don’t see it as useful as building for grinding, or events for event hopping. There just are not enough legendaries running around, for it to be effective.
---
That does not seem like its the case for me.
---
It's an XP farm, especially when it's double XP. Also, as you rank through the ore levels the enemies change. If it's a good group people will collect ore and only deposit it all with like 30 seconds to go so you can get XP and full rewards. Unfortunately, not everyone collects the ore...
---
Do these reset?
---
Look at the combat, world (et al) challenge lists.
---
Lots of atoms to be award in those.
---
Some of those challenge re-occur, just with larger quantities.  For example, one might be hack 50 terminals.  Once you complete It, you got however many atoms, then the Same challenge re-appears  as hack 250 terminals.
---
Recommended level 35+? Wendigo colossus? Should bump that number to 50+
---
My only real criticism is that the boss variety is jaded. A legendary scorch beast or behemoth is easy, a colossus? That's quadruple the difficulty of both combined
---
I get that its an xp farm, but you can still complete the event and farm the legendary's.  you just come out with the best final rewards as well.
---
This is what me and the team do. We farm XP mostly, and try to get level 1 reward for the completion. The rewards are nice but not amazing anymore. We need more shooting gallery events.
---
I haven’t played that much this dbl xp weekend but the last one I got to level 90 and I started out at level 30 something
---
Honestly, I was the same way. But I enjoy playing the event, so now whenever it starts up, I go so others might join in. It’s solid XP and legendary farming with some good rewards to thrown in. Also, I still don’t have the Bear Arm plan, so that’s a draw for me.
---
I went to Arktos earlier today. Waited eight minutes and no one showed. Started the event. By the time the friendly animals came out, eight other players had joined. Ranked up twice at level 232.
---
If you have the 200% repair perk, takes what seems like forever before you need to repair any give piece.
---
Billiard balls count too
---
Or maybe my shit is fucking perfect since it works with everything else just fine. Even after two full resets of everything it’s still having issues
---
I said bring it back without the leaderboard.  And I've said I also abandoned it, it was trash because they just kept trying to force pvp on people who wanted nothing to do with it.
---
Just don't play NW. It is basically the red headed stepchild of a nearly ignored game. Beth already got their money.
---
Well the wiki is wrong
---
Like the ammo factory resource extractor trick or the faction ammo machine ?
---
not sure what it is, did you got one? i just got the email saying my account is under investigation
---
The best rewards are a rad barrel plan, meh. And a colored haz mat suit that you can't repair. Most people would rather get in more time farming.
---
Not saying finishing the event is bad at all. Just being honest
---
Whilst I can not offer a solution ... I do know of a very minor exploit that, given patience, could improve your odds fractionally over the long term. 
---
Essentially, as we have all seen on many occasions, PP will start and NO ONE will join whatsoever. If you see this event lingering with no interest, you may as well join, initiate the collection stage and collect the radkarp, but DON’T place it into the collector.
---
You can horde radkarp in your inventory AFTER the event fails, and it weighs 0.0. Basically, you’d be able to join a PP event another time, and immediately fill the radkarp collector, leaving you free to collect fragrant meat or toxic sludge.
---
It’s a sucky chore, but it IS something to consider, especially when your joining your Nth event, and no-one seems to know what they’re doing :(
---
Agreed. That and it’s very much a team event. I played today and there were two level 200+ players crouching in a corner in chameleon armor sneak-attacking enemies... during the feed collection.
---
I’m also level 51 and have met so many nice players as well. The game might not be the best, but the community is definitely amazing.
---
Could also try something like Tenderizer, Suppressor, Stranger in Numbers, and Magnetic personality. Sharing magnetic personality lets a full team share rank 2/3 perks which is cool
---
I keep getting game crashes. Doubt they'll extend it though
---
If the problem was on beth's part you'd see many more posts about it.
---
I wish they would let us host our own servers, greedy fucks would rather collect our money and restrict our playstyles. I'm not a fan of duping personally but I am a fan of mods in fallout. I'd even accept our hosted server accounts not transfer to live accounts. Idk
---
Should have'm pop up as a semi-common event randomly around appalachia for the week leading up to halloween; maybe with some fun loot/consumables to grab.
---
I have better luck with the dailies personally, I am not 100% sure I have gotten one from campfire (I know it was bugged for a long time and wasn't dropping them at all)
---
Is there even an economy in this game? They just banned all of the people who were making things (3 star legendarys that are atcually kind of good) affordable for everyone. If 1st players could get more legendary's though the scrip machine they would most likely use tgem or sell them, but because others can also get and sell those same good legendarys the prices should be lower and more affordable for everyone
---
50 was my original level choice but I felt after that having it lower would encourage lower level players to join it.   But then again if and when One Wasteland comes that really won’t matter. 
---
Yeah. The first two were more of a big and bad boss pick. The colossus was a way to bring it to general audience. Right now the only way to see and fight one is via nuke, and the coming event. If anything I would water the stats or attack options down for it. This wasn’t meant for an end game event. So ideally the bosses are more inline with that if the sheepquatch in Free Range. Something for the effort.
---
If you finished the brother hood quest line, in the asylum, that is where the ultracite pa came from fyi
---
Yes, it does. Nerd rage perk card stacks too. In PA, emergency protocols also.
---
Cool getting back on in a couple mins.
---
Yup. 80% from bloodied. 50% from adrenal. 20% from nerd rage
---
Just jumped worlds
---
I'll definitely look them up. I think I actually remember RifleGaming. They did a bunch of "what happens when you nuke _____" videos right? The answer was always "the same thing that happens to everywhere else" and their use of filler and filler words drove me crazy. I think I'm a little picky. 😬
---
Will absolutely check out the rest though.
---
The filter only shows you threads with the same basic flair and number of replies, so using it alone is highly misleading. Use nukacrypt's devtracker for a full overview of the Community Managers' replies.
---
Edit: To be clear, they still reply less than they used to, but still nowhere near as little as you say.
---
This! I’m only level 82 but it’s been fun to gift new players items. I’ve started picking up things I don’t really need anymore (random loot from daily quests/etc) for this purpose too.
---
I already have it, but thanks for offering.
---
Yall all trying to get me buy stuff from them xd.
---
Xbox here and same bug. Been hoping it’ll eventually work but no luck for weeks.
---
yes actually this would be the best, i think they told they would do that when they announced fo76, not sure what happened
---
I know a lot of the NPC's are from the Pit.
---
Ah okay that’s good to know guess I just need to continue farming them when I can.
---
Ammo machine was too slow last I tried. The ammo factory trick I’ll have to try, sounds like the ticket
---
I don't think he even needs to see you to kill you. He was hiding inside that mothman cultist hotel while I was way down the mountain when he killed me.
---
Right.. exactly.    I did switch servers cause the game glitched out on me as usual and I had to log back in ... but when I did, the enemy levels were even lower... like forest region level in the Mire.    Hopefully they fix this soon.   I don’t mind easy but jeez... c’mon.   I’ve spent a lot of time preparing for a fight only to take on glass jaw joe?
---
Id love to see replies to the ban wave
---
confirmed works
---
Amen, brotha
---
Pennsylvania borders West Virginia on its western edge. Seems likely that speech patterns and dialect would be similar in both states, to some degree.
---
Naw I've never been banned. It's a joke for what they did to cheaters in the past. They sent a letter out saying we may give your account back if you apologize with an essay and tell us how you did it.
---
if you wind back up on the same server the terminal will still be unlocked.
---
It has been, worked out synergy wise too, I was able to knock out both sets of rose quests at the same time
---
I make a point of using a Pipe Rifle at Uranium Fever.
---
Everything else i own at level 370 Insta kills.
---
It really is difficult not insta-killing everything.
---
I have to stand up also.
---
Someone did their homework, at least.
---
Lou in the Raider questline is very yinz this, yinz that.
---
The reason there is a cap on any form of currency in the game is so that the economy doesn't break. It seems perfectly logical to me. Same in real life. If a country hits a recession it doesn't just simply print more money. Sorry if this opinion might be unpopular but the limit is there for a good reason.
---
Same! Plus I try to drop some survival stuff, stimpacks and purified water and radaway/rad-x, and duplicate plans. I started at beta launch, so it feels good to help people when I remember it was kind of horrifying when I was low level.
---
Auto rifle
---
Why spend atoms on this anyway?
---
I'm not even specced for shotguns and I carry an instigating ffr 90%wr around with me coz I already have the ammo on me for my gauss rifle and its great to pull out in a pinch, destroys everything but scorchbeasts, as you say. I might grab some more modules and try for a junkies roll, but I was pretty happy with the instigating as it was literally my first roll.
---
The funny thing is, allies sometimes already join us in other areas, even during SBQ battles.
---
haha for real? that s a nice joke from them, did they actually got their account back?
---
Damn!!! Now that’s generous
---
The event, the Colossus is in game, 10% chance to spawn in nuke zones.
---
You actually won't need a lot of aid with this type of build, so I'd suggest getting rid of traveling pharmacy in favor of Blocker.
---
That's long been my assumption, but  if it's true that you can get it from the likes of the Mirelurk Queen, Grafton Monster, or Megasloth, that throws it for a loop, given none are inherently Scorched.
---
The Grafton Monster is a FEV mutant, and the others are more "natural mutation."
---
Hence my current theory that the symptoms might be similar enough that we don't notice a difference; Blight from the Queen might be a weakened Scorched plague, where the Monster's might be some strain of FEV and the Megasloth might actually be a fungal infection, but they all look/feel the same so we just assume it's collectively "The Blight."
---
Be mindful wherever you place it that it will be permanently in that spot in your camp.
---
Love using it, but it would be perfection if initial 95% V.A.T.S. wasn't "a bit optimistic."
---
Running no power armor you loose the benefits of stabilized in the intelligence tree. At rank 3 you’d gain 45% armor penetration and a 8%ish (can’t remember exact number)chance to stagger
---
Can you be a bit more specific,cheers .
---
That’s what I mean. They actually made it good, I wouldn’t care about losing aid, but being forced to FT to certain locations which didn’t have spawn protection. I mean in most cases of PvP you either one shot someone or get one shot, so I didn’t want my aid items I’d just throw them away haha
---
Dude, you wanna talk toxic behavior in our community read your own comment. 
---
Hope you get what you deserve be it good news from mods or bad. 🤷‍♀️
---
I've gained around 120 levels since the start of the legendary run, but this weekend alone I reckon I've done 60 of those, XP has been crazy, those lunchboxes + double xp are great for me as I don't have a high int build and I cbf farming consumables.
---
I love him. Favorite camp piece.
---
For the time being.....ditch adrenaline until it gets fixed.  Doesn't actually work right now which sucks.  Just equip literally any agility card you have so the points are doing something at least.  
---
Once it gets fixed though it is one of the best perks IMO.
---
Honestly the game is nowhere near as bad as it was a year ago. There are still some bugs in it but they're not game breaking by any means. The game is so huge with so much to do, I can happily overlook those small bugs. You should give it another go 👍
---
Thanks for letting us know.    
---
Not happening.
---
Yeah this works for almost every town in the game but helvetia is good for wood anyway
---
The game compensates for poor scaling in online play by imposing arbitrary limits to the stash box. The scrap box fixes that issue/limitation and therefore should be part of the base game, period. However, a higher camp budget and stash box limit would be a nice-to-have for 1st. XP would be too much.
---
I just there for the chance at some swag : O
---
Ice maker should be a cryolator
---
Oh so I should be using only 3? I heard that if you use any xp buff food along with the lunchboxes you won't get the full xp.
---
Haha I swear it hits more at 13% and 100 metres than 95% and 10 metres.
---
Its not maximized, dont need aqua boy aqua girl, if your heavy gunner i can dm u mine and let yk which qol I use so you can swap out
---
I'm sorry if I'm mistaken here... But is there anything supporting that? All we have is the broadcast saying they want to take Atlas. That doesn't suggest they left recently.
---
Logically, wouldn't they have originally begun the journey shortly after losing communication with Taggerdy (over a year ago by the time Fractured Steel releases).
---
Either way, I doubt they would have left recently considering the distance they'd have to travel. New California to Appalachia isn't a short distance, especially in the post apocalypse.
---
For me is the Gatling gun, you make a lot of ammo and you can kill most of the enemies with one shot and the ultracite ammo is so cheap. But it depends.
---
Really? I found it looks really good
---
I'd be too afraid to engage a group of 3, it feels like even though I've got the same guns as them, my bullets are made of marshmallows and they just double tap me :/
---
That said, the best success I've had in killing players is with the crossbow!
---
What’s his main perk? Bloodied / Junkies increase damage a lot, and paired with explosive or faster fire rate is deadly.
---
And while that would be a great help for at least one part of the event you still need to protect all the friendly creatures. They aren’t very close to each other so it would be logically a nightmare to coordinate protecting two of them (even at max rank) with one or even 2 people who actually know what to do. It’s a shame the event isn’t more straight forward. 
---
That being said I am happy to see them make a more complicated event, it’s why people asked for and then no one plays it because “it’s too hard to do” I mean pick which kind of event you wantZ
---
And if you use it on NW you will be a GOD, literally the best weapon in the game.
---
I would appreciate that
---
Wow I’m so happy that this was the first post to pop up because I was about to make one myself asking about it. I finally hit max settler rep today  after grinding max raider rep to get the gauss minigun (I’m a heavy build) and I was curious about this one because most people say it shreds. Good to know that I can get it tommorow after hitting up sunny and cashing out at the gold machine. 500 bullion is so cheap I thought it would be as much as the plasma caster??? Hey I’m not complaining!
---
Assaultrons are like a Knife going through Butter.
---
Matters not what level you are.
---
Best way to deal with these is strike first.
---
I have a Bloodied black powder Rifle that does 1100 base damage just for these,Sentrybots,and Gutsises.
---
One shot killing them is so enjoyable.
---
One wasteland wont really affect the Colossus. As the base variant of the colossus is always level 70 something. Just like the base scorchbeast is level 50. One wasteland wont drop their levels below the base level. A scorchbeast will be level 85 for me since I'm far above its base and max, whereas it will be level 50 for anyone below level 50
---
I get the colossus is a hard boss to get to spawn. But that's how it should be. It's a tough challenge for even a group of high level players. Its suppose to be in line with the queen. I would say it's even more of a challenge then the queen. It has a smaller health pool, but it has more damage potential. And its spawn are much harder than most scorched hoards on the queen fight
---
Isnt the sheepsquatch in free range exactly the same? In personal experiences I never noticed it being weaker in any way than a normally spawning sheepsquatch.
---
The Eastern PA dialect is unique to that area.  Tri state area being Eastern PA, NJ and Delaware.  Not like any other in PA.  That's what put it on my radar
---
Looks like he used conduits
---
You can earn atoms. just try the challenges
---
Incredible.
---
Its been extra infested with hackers lately...
---
Finding, setting up, building, and maintaining PA was a bit daunting for me.
---
Youd trick me if i didn't frequent this sub.
---
Its double dailies, not double score. So it only applies to dailies.  
---
Its a weekend event, will last as long as this double XP event has.
---
Zero.
---
It either doubles the amount of SCORE only from the dailies, or doubles the set of dailies. I'm pretty sure it's the 2and set, but I've heard both possibilities
---
Weeklies are most likely unaffected
---
Again, you're in the minority. I had lag and load issues every time. So did everyone I played with.
---
It’s out rn and it’s on sale for 200 atoms
---
It really depends on your play.  For me it was always my tse mini, I had an aa ffr Gatlin that was a close second.  Those have been living on a mule ever since I got my fe gat plas though
---
I thought that at first. But tbh why not something wacky? Either way it still works. The laser rifle just sounds cooler. Change the beam to blue and we get something exciting.
---
Thorn or SS armor might be a good idea
---
Strangler heart PA isnt a bad idea either
---
I didn't even noticed that adrenaline does not work, thanks!
---
Ok, so it's not useful to you but it will be for many people. Just because it doesn't give you shortcuts to things you should be gaining during normal gameplay, I don't think it deserves the vote down when it's there to help people. For me, this map has been way more useful than a google search. Even a google search will bring up this map in most cases.
---
Just got mine yesterday. Not a shotgun or bloody build. And it's very strong. Currently have a 2 shot but might go for instigating
---
What are good mods for it though?
---
Loading screens and the fact you sometimes are a minute or two jog from where the other player was. I'd rather blast a group of mobs and move to the next versus wasting all the time in a load screen to legendary hunt.
---
Thank you! I hope you're having a great week.
---
Shoot their legs with a shotgun (get the enforcer perk). Their legs are their Achilles’ heel.  One or two blasts from a shotgun to their legs will drop them; they are easy game after that. Not even the Asaultron Dominators stand a chance. It even works when they are in stealth mode, you don’t need VATS to blow their legs off.
---
No. Just use a different weapon, be original.
---
To me you're in the minorityn no one I played with ever had those issues and we would grind at least 6 a day
---
He had an explosive secondary effect... what was the primary? Berserker? Nocturnal? Both of those will TANK your damage if you aren’t meeting their optimal conditions
---
I always drop my cores and plans next to low level players.
---
Honestly! I was able to gain the last 15 levels I needed to reach Lv100 and earn the platinum trophy. Then I started up a 2nd character to work toward that last DLC trophy I need. I'm at Lv23 with that character already, and working through Wastelanders.
---
So this weekend had been very productive haha.
---
EDIT: Got that last DLC trophy! 2nd character ended at Lv32. It's funny, I first played this game at the start of a 2x XP weekend, and only ended the weekend at Lv28. So I was very efficient here haha.
---
No event unfortunately I was just doing it randomly, one of the remaining ones I have to get. Yeah the diamonds are nice though
---
I just go for the xp, i don't care much about the event reward. And I have too many notes already.
---
If someone cares about the ore, fine. I'll cover the workers.
---
Some people really prefer the 50 cal, just depends on you
---
Thanks i'll keep that in mind.
---
Good location too... looks like you can just sail away.
---
Can i ask what Legendary modules you have on it ?
---
Cheers.
---
All mine have been woeful.
---
I really hope it's double rewards and not double challenges.
---
Just finished strangler on my heavy gunner.
---
This cahracter is outside of PA, and my armor is pretty dialed in atm. Not looking for that grind lol, but I guess ss+jetpack?
---
What's the advantages of thorn? I've heard solar is good for support builds
---
I had a bug that reset my SCORE to rank 1 yesterday and when I finished my first challenge it leveled up all the way from 1 to 42. Took at least 5 minutes.
---
IDK, I did 'Back On The Beat' this morning with my level 20 alt and this level 177 and 140 didn't let me get single kill in.  Robbed my low level of lots of XP.  Fuck those players.  Times like that I wish I used a mic but its probably best I don't.
---
But yeah, when I am playing my main, which is level 414, I just hang out at events in the Forest region for gold, rewards, and event completion XP.  I will almost always let the low levels have all the kills and will only help as needed.
---
I got to do Feed the People yesterday with a level 7 who obviously was new (or bad memory) and it was a ton of fun helping them out.  Showed them were the burst pipe was and got them out of trouble a couple times with enemies. It was fun.
---
But then I'll go do Camp Fire Tails and you get these 100-200+ level players just standing around not helping.  Screw ya'll.  I will sit down during the enemies and let you get all the kills, i don't care about that.  I WILL partially participate in the grab this, do that crap but I've learned because of some of you tards,  to only do a little of it and force you to participate and if you don't, well we can sit there all fucking night.  I am only there for the chance of earning a badge.  I don't even care about the legendary.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
I'm having a hard time thinking of any feature they've added to this game since release that hasn't been bugged in some way.
---
To bad they are amazon servers though.
---
I'd get the SS armour just for the jetpack, but I love how mobile it makes me, its not for everyone.
---
Nope. It's raiders v settlers till Beth feels like the cult has a big enough roll to play.
---
It was furious explosive. Don't remember the 3rd effect. I basically have him the Gatling equivalent to what he already had.
---
In terms of DPS it's the gauss minigun. But it's hard to obtain and consumes ammo faster than you would believe
---
Plasma caster and gatling gun both are good overall and have low ammo consumption. Plasma cartridges are harder to find, but 5mm is plentiful 
---
50cal is one of the best DPS machines, but goes through 50cal much like the gauss mini goes through 2mm
---
The minigun is just a worse 50cal IMO
---
The gatling laser is pretty good overall, ammo is heavy as hell
---
The gatling plasma breaks fast, can have a large spread, and its ammo is heavy
---
I have been saving all mine. I haven't used a single one at level 50 score so far.
---
I'm sorry to be such a pain, but realized last night I was at 100 caps and still cant refresh vendor yet. I have scrap and ammo if you like 400 rounds as trade or am happy to wait till refresh as I'm really not in hurry.
---
Do you not have the Turbo-Fert fertilizer collector for the nades?
---
[ ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Turbo-Fert_fertilizer_collector?action=edit)
---
True!
---
It's basically just an XP farm to help get up that SCORE.
---
Do you plan on running power armor? 
---
Id can bandolier and batteries included unless you plan on carrying a ton of unnecessary stuff.  I always carried 10k plus 5mm and it was never an issue.  Id keep traveling pharmacy and use the hell out of psychobufffs.  Add in bear arms.
---
Id get adamantium skeleton and fire proof, get rid of tenderizer
---
I keep trying to get him to spec junkie. I was junkie for a while and it was a lot of fun. Bloodied now.
---
I just sit as soon as I enter the cave for Load Bearing and chill for 5 minutes lol
---
I'm mostly positive it doubles challenges in a day with how it was worded on the roadmap, but I like to hope otherwise
---
Id add the endurance perk that increases the effect of being well fed/hydrated, drop adrenaline to 1, get dodgey and action boy. Rest good. I run no pa heavy bloodied/junkies and do just fine. You wont need ironclad w/ full ss and hardened skin/grounded mutations. Honestly tho you can run a low health junkie build if you want a little more survivability. You wont need to run sub 20% and it does just a good imo
---
Careful with the placement during SBQ. If she can't path to land or crop dust, she'll stay far enough away the event will fail.
---
Probably because Maxson lost contact with Appalachia about a decade before we even left 76...
---
They're probably sending out the current signal because the team is within broadcast distance to Appalachia.
---
I agree with Rifleman, but feel that Demolition Expert isn't really all that beneficial because of the maths involved. When you take Demo Expert, it makes you deal 60% damage more on explosives, but the explosive damage you get from an explosvie damage is only 20% of the base weapon damage.
---
Let's take a weapon dealing 100 base weapon damage, just for maths simplicity. My understanding of damage perks is that perks affecting the same thing stack multiplicatively, while things that affect different things stack additively. Making a 100-damage rifle explosive means it goes from 100 ballistic damage to 100 ballistic +20 explosive damage. If you max out nine ranks of rifleman, that goes up to roughly 1.7x100 ballistic, +20 explosive, for a total of 190. If you also add five ranks of Demo Expert, you get 60% increased damage, but that only applies to the 20% of base weapon damage, for a total of a whopping 12 extra points of damage. You'd get a better increase from just going with Bloody mess, as that applies to all damage sources.
---
Nah, I'm not at max rep with the settlers sadly :/
---
I favorite Inert Flux rather than Purified Water because it gives you the same hydration plus disease resist. The only downside is that weighs a little more.
---
I do all events so when i'm at a lowbie party I only shoot stuff if the group is struggling and only after everyone has at least tried to tag mobs, I save downed peeps too and never take loot from say collision course event stuff like that.
---
Best ones that work for my PA builds are: TSE .50 Cal, FE Gatling Gun, &amp; A Bloodied variant of the Gauss Minigun [drawback is it’s ammo is heavy], but you don’t need that much ammo cause u shred everything.
---
Ultracite, just looks cool and I rarely use PA.
---
I deposited my junk and hacked someone ammo terminal then baited at the vault dancing
---
The 50cal is a great all arounder. But the awesome thing with heavys is they all play different roles.
---
Gattling, hard hitting, ammo efficient
---
Lmg, crazy dps, bullet hose
---
50 cal, great all arounder
---
Gattling laser, crazy accurate, can hold 1k rounds with power user
---
Flamer, great close ranger mob control, hits multiple enemy's at once
---
Harpoon, great shot gun with the fletcheted mod on it
---
There are a ton of them. It's hard to pick a "best"
---
I've taken it with my main, the red workshop is in the midst of the wood shacks next to the bombed out tall building, sorry if that's not what you mean.
---
Now it works as it was supposed to?!
---
Morgan Town High School, Bolton's Green, Hemlock Holes, Whitesprings Golf Course, and Fort Defiance (Just the left hand side) are what I use.
---
Awesome
---
Is that true? I thought that Bethesda nerfed it so that only your base charisma score counted for perk sharing.
---
I hope you let others tag the enemies. Last night I was on a server with a level-600 player and he was one-shotting everything. I understand the desire for XP but share the wealth please.
---
Well if he can get a BE or JE .50cal and has the low health and/or addictions, he’ll pack a punch! Make sure he has all 3 Heavy Gunner Perks &amp; Bloody Mess :)
---
Not usually, there are better locations for scrap.  Of course it depends what you're looking for.
---
Same happened to me
---
Melee targets take bleed damage, as well as melee attackers. You're also harder to detect while sneaking
---
Solar gives you and team health regen when you're above 60% health
---
SS torso + jetpack is probably your best bet. As the mobility it brings is unmatched. And you only have to grind for the 1 piece
---
They might not... But for all we know, they have no choice. Hence why it's taken them so long.
---
Like, I said, them rolling up in military vehicles would be cool. But, I doubt Bethesda would do that.
---
Vampire explosive 50cal is my primary and has been for a long time. You save on stimpaks and do area damage meaning more tags for XP. The amount of high level hoard grinding I do this is needed.
---
Yes, im actually playing in power armor.
---
Thanks for advices :)
---
I really don’t mind people getting the WS, I mainly claim them for daily challenges... what makes me sad and with a inferiority complex is when they kill you for the lolz :( *cries*
---
You don't look like a guy with a plan here. Love it! 👍
---
Yeah I’ve taken it as well, I’m talking about for the Discover locations... discover abandoned Bogtown. Been sitting at 4/5 Forever
---
It was tough to get used to but I agree. Going third person in NW with this is pure death.
---
I believe you are correct and I've made this assumption when I first started playing. Even all the glitches the game has could be explained through bad tranquility software.
---
no, 100% works fine, 4of them at same time. If u get one more lunchbox then it resets to 0%
---
Hmm. Maybe a behemoth would be more effective as a boss. While I do want a boss that offers a challenge. The colossus would be that but far more than needed. And the SB would too underwhelming. 
---
Doesn’t have to be kick your teeth hard but hard enough to be fun. 
---
They are the same I believe. But I was referring to how you fight as the “boss” not the difficulty.
---
Did you guys know you can also inspect and repair a weapon from the favorites wheel using a repair kit without having to find a bench or repair it trough the pipboy.
---
(pint sized slasher intensifies)
---
There is a happy medium -- use your less powerful guns or turn off your perks so you do less damage. That way you play alongside your less-leveled companions.
---
Yeah, you only need to tap the trigger as fast as you can possibly can. Lol
---
I had totally forgot about him.
---
Thanks OP.
---
you already have all the SS armor + relevant mods?
---
I actually also received a response on my ticket saying "yup, we did this on purpose its working as intended", This is supposed to be a triple A title and we're downgrading graphics halfway through? I sort of feel like Im not getting the product I payed for.
---
Screenshot of suppor ticket: https://imgur.com/zbXTmEK
---
Are you sure Atlas didn't have a helipad beforehand? Because, if that is new, you may be onto something...
---
Just scrap it
---
You might be isolated here, my friends and I haven’t experienced any server troubles (aside from the usual random kick). Although, I wouldn’t mind more double do.
---
I've heard you can blueprint crops and then place them closer to one another, haven't ever tried testing it out as I took a break from the game. Couldn't stand doing the same 10-15 things everyday before I got sick of it and logged off
---
You need to scrap it 
---
It the one from the early levels right?
---
No problem,  I'd also go with something other than glow sight as that card has limited usefulness.  Refractor or the grenadier card
---
What other players get and don’t get is of no consequence to me. If you want the legendary, shoot faster than me.
---
Its easily affable when eating lunch and watching netflix
---
Its just a scrap package, scrap it or keep it in your stash until you need the scrap inside of it. I assume it weighs less in package form but I can't be sure.
---
By power complex do you mean feel like a psychopath
---
You'll find that the raiders are inclusive and you can actual do their dailies without killing someone, while ward will send you to recover something he doesn't need and you'll have to kill someone to get it. While he glitches. Finally.
---
If you.play in a team often doing events you my like suppressor more than tenderizer
---
Sometimes the enemys can get stuck in the walls. Was only able to finish it one time because someone had an explosive wepon to kill the dog that was stuck
---
Yeah, I actually upgraded my entire system to try and fix this with support, 32 GB of Ram, i9 10900K core, 2070 RTX, end result? Bethesda basically telling me "yup, this was intentional" https://imgur.com/zbXTmEK
---
I mean they probably hate their jobs. I personally think no one feels the bullshit of bethesda more than the community mods. They have to relay the cash cow ideas that their bosses choose then have to deal with the reprucussions while the bosses suffer nothing, know not of our struggles and collect the money. Its pointless to try and get them to change. Again and again bethesda will mess up but they know many people will still blindly follow them. Like imagine going from making god tier games like fo3 and nv to making a game that was literally dubbed the glitchiest game of the year. Watch any interview, bethesda doesnt care about this game.
---
It's listed for 9999. I paid 10k for the plan I bought. Just trying to get my money back but I can be a little flexible.
---
Oh, Happy Cake Day!
---
My lowest level used to be a character for whom all my other characters (including my main) would work, by collecting perfect gear, modding and crafting. He was the spoiled one, the chosen one, the golden idol. He received the godrolls, he got all the best drugs and perfect perks. He got the serums and the free ammo.
---
Now, since he was level 50 (I kept him there for a year) people would try to lure him into a fight or ambush. Little did they know, this character was a powerhouse built for PvP with perfect heavy sets of cavalier, assassin's, sentinel, etc. I gave him the most harmless appearance (surveyor outfit, thin, etc.) And just waited. 
---
The anger he caused, oh, the anger... even his dumb invisible friends succumbed to Joe Harmless. When they are 3 and you are just taking turns to demolish them... 
---
Of course they call you cheater.
---
If people show up at the event you started, turn off your perks or switch to a less powerful weapon so these people can tag the enemies. Share the wealth.
---
You actually only need 3 people back to back to go farm the ore. Each person can collect 40. Once that person returns, give way to another to go collect 40, whilst they protect. Then, once that last person comes back, the last person will go an finish the job, which is quicker cause he’ll need 20. [scenario for 3 people].
---
If you have more people &amp; u could spare 3 to go out and collect right away. Then the event will be done in less than 5 mins or it should cause it doesn’t take that long to collect.
---
If you solo the event, recommend Shotgunner with enforcer. Target ghoul limbs, leave them crippled and don’t kill them as that makes them spawn. Go collect, but most likely won’t be able to collect a 100 as I’ve tried it and ores seem to take forever to spawn. [dont know if there is a way to spawn ores faster].
---
here's another layer to the cake, Bethesda telling me it was intentional https://imgur.com/zbXTmEK
---
Yeah, it can be weaker. I did have an all super mutants run today,  that was nice
---
Just wait until you get to the broken rewards😂
---
This is probably because when you log in it takes a few seconds for The game to register your lvl. So for a moment you are lvl 1 and The game spawn enemies acordingly
---
Huh. Well, the gatling gun is the ammo efficiency king, but the 50cal should beat it in DPS- it fires 9 times a second, a gatling gun fires like... twice a second.
---
The enclave commissioned west-tek to make the FEV right? And the enclave made the sorchbeasts. Perhaps the scorched plague is a mutated strain of FEV? Still, it’s strange how you can get it from the mirelurk queen and mega sloth.
---
Sarcasm?
---
yeah I dont even know how you could mess it up this bad and call it intentional at this point.
---
You don't need an AAE gun to kill those weak mobs. Pick off a few with VATS and leave one or two for the other players.
---
Take the L.
---
OMG that's why it still takes me 8 tries to fast travel on a regular basis.  It's by design to probe our characters' frustration levels!
---
"Fast Travel - 60% of the time, it works every time."
---
no I'm actually dead serious
---
Thank you Biscuit. I will be sure to repay it in kind.
---
That is amazing, well done!
---
yeah, my flooring looks like a skating rink, from most angles I cant even see the textures on there.
---
It’s a major issue that has come up recently.  
---
Here’s a post outlining it.  
---
I’d send in tickets and hope for the best
---
The only ones worth using are the Excavator and the Strangler Heart, as those are the ones that have benefits above and beyond the normal power armor tankiness. I generally keep a set of Excavator in my back pocket in case of nuke/radiation rumble/overencumbered.
---
Ty
---
People who false-report should get banned instead.  People in the game are reporting others for having "funny" costumes etc. Like wake up people!
---
I salute you, sir.
---
Negative
---
reminds me of back in survival when me and my buddy followed a team of four through the entire bunker then killed them and launched the nuke ourselves. i miss survival
---
Really hard to make ships with how boxy everything is.  This is probably the best I've seen.
---
i live in the fucking spicy fields with the raiders just because a decent flat surface is hard to come by. that and i opened a nice bar there for those who drop by.
---
That happens all the time it’s annoying lol. I love when the creatures are somehow all close to each other or in one habitat. Makes my job easier!
---
90% of the time I get the raider Rocksy quest it puts me like 5 feet away from target.....also sometimes I get there and the hunter is there just like wandering around doing jack shit, not even trying to catch his target.
---
Nah, plague walke is just bugged to have a longer disease duration instead of forever.
---
They're weightless so either put the scrap into a stash box or save them until you need them.
---
I had a bunch of people stand around my dead level 15 body yesterday tea bagging me. I wish I was having the same experience as people on here seem to be.
---
Im guessing thats where we got our extra Camp budget from, also, Im guessing they intentionally made the Grids smaller so we wont trigger encounters until we're close enough to actually see them, but seriously, could we just space out the encounters more? I know its nice people are back but I cant walk 5 feet without someone calling me lazy for not rebuilding foundation.
---
well not sure about “badesda” but I doubt that bethesda will do it in near future...
---
I bought all the SS armour,but only use the Chest piece.
---
Jet Pack novelty wore off really quick.
---
Think it has with others as you hardly see them
---
The  - 1 AP feels more significant than it should in my opinion.And loads really slow.
---
Was really noticeable when i ditched the Jetpack.
---
Also bought the Gauss Shotgun.
---
Been through 30+ legendary modules trying for a Bloodied.
---
Still sitting on 800 T Bonds and 3000 in my inventory.
---
It is. Thank you.
---
Best bet is to collect cigarettes whenever it's possible.
---
They are not free on my end. Gold .44 is for 250 atoms and the icon for 25 atoms
---
It does, and thank you.
---
The lighting definently got a downgrade, it had issues in some interiors in the past, but that was more a question of the lighting map needing correction, now its everything.
---
not sure what it means mate
---
something else thats gotten zero acknowledgement or fixes.
---
Same for me
---
As far as I am aware Adrenal Reaction is broken.
---
If you're on PS4, I'd be more than willing to buy some off of you!
---
Check this out. Base camps and workshops have numbers assigned to water and food growth. Base camps are always 1 food and 1 water but some workshops offer higher numbers. Think of the plant or water filter as just a container for that item, then know that the containers in total on that property only produce the base number of water or food every 5 minutes. The numbers are based off of 5 minute intervals. So, at a base camp, every 5 minutes you should have a random plant fill with that food. If you have two plants you would wait 10 minutes and have two full plants. If you are on a workshop with food x10 you can have 10 plants fill up in 5 minutes. The same works for water and any other resource. Tldr: every 5 minutes the game fills up a container, in your camp, with 1 unit based on the item you are trying to resource. (Water/food/oil/etc) if in a workshop, the numbers can be higher.
---
I've been using it as my main since may
---
I carry around an I 50LD 25VC and an I 33VC 25VC
---
The I33 is more consistent in VATS, but the I50 does so much more damage, especially when hitting weak points. Best purchase I ever made with my gold
---
*puts on tinfoil hat*
---
it's aliens man, I'm telling you there doing experiments on us to see how we react!
---
Good for XP and Chems. I just hate to go there... It feels like faaar away.
---
yeah, this is a problem for me too, sometimes the textures dont pop until Im right on top of things, Bethesda's telling me that this is totally intentional for running things on Ultra though: https://imgur.com/zbXTmEK
---
Also a for-real option!
---
How do you actually change your camp skin?
---
You're about to get the 4:8:2000 error for this
---
its even worse in NW
---
I think there should be a specific backpack mod for power armor, that lets you add those modifications. But you’re absolutely right, power armor is really hurting from the lack of weight reduction additions that regular armor gets. Power armor users shouldn’t have to lose out on 3 perks in agility or strength just to keep up with regular armor and a backpack.
---
Chadafallout76storypodcast
---
Oh no which are broken
---
They're not free items?
---
Pay it fwd and it’s all good
---
Because people don't like a challenge
---
FO76 is different from the other Fallout games -- it is multiplayer. And it is very easy for high-level players. It isn't much of a sacrifice to let other players tag the enemies.
---
its not a competition amigo, there's multiple teams at work, Visuals could devote some time to not make the triple A title look like crap on a stick.
---
wasnt a problem until Wastelanders.
---
funny, i also just recently got healing factor, but im still going to carry 10,000 stimpacks on me out of habit. thats the only reason i even made room for traveling pharmacy lmao
---
this all came with Wastelanders, wasnt a problem before.
---
Same... Pretty much a daily discount. I think they release "free" stuff like once a week at max.
---
[https://imgur.com/UhnrrLm](https://imgur.com/UhnrrLm)  
---
I just bought them, and it worked ok.
---
Yes Timmy, a power complex, that’s right.
---
**into walkie-talkie** Fetch the straight jacket.
---
Be prepared to pay 100 caps per stable flux that you need
---
Can we get interior walls? Like walls that you can wallpaper on both sides?
---
You gotta listen, I can't say too much or they will know I'm onto them and kill me but it's the zetans man, those little flatwoods monster creeps are controlling us all
---
Finally, someone with the guts to walk 50 feet away.
---
I agree with you, i'ts just people don't seem to understand what role collecting the ore plays in the event (or even care). best i've managed is 63 ores over the event time and used over 30+ radaway (ran out of them before the end of the event) that was before I got hold of the Chinese stealth armor with its 1k rad resist, even now i'm using 15+ at each event and collecting about 50ish each time
---
you can only claim free items if the item itself is free. typically you will see the free sticker on items you can claim for free in the atom shop.
---
The point is I shouldn’t need to handicap myself and my play style to make other people happy. Play the way you want. Does that mean you have to be an asshole when playing events, no, but that doesn’t mean my entire time playing should I make the game “more bearable” for other people.
---
Haha lol
---
This is why I usually run with nvidia shadowplay, so when I get some really good workshop salt I can just record it to laugh at later
---
This would explain so much!
---
Explosive Gatling plasma should not even be in game, those a legacy weapons, and are probably duped anyway...  So you didnt miss anything, probably.
---
Lead lots of lead everyday......and no hassle workshops when I need to farm some cores, it's good having 6-7 workshops running for an afternoon, sorts most of my needs for a month or so.
---
IMO, my build:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344e88&amp;w=sb2sq2s32sr2pe2eh2eu0cu2cr0ir2ip2s12a04l71lt2lu2sx2ib4s72&amp;m=c29e](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344e88&amp;w=sb2sq2s32sr2pe2eh2eu0cu2cr0ir2ip2s12a04l71lt2lu2sx2ib4s72&amp;m=c29e)
---
While Adrenaline isn't working you replace it with whatever you like(like action boy/girl, white knight, whatever).
---
When I'm not using explosive guns or using gatling laser - I'm getting Power user instead(it doubles ammo)
---
When I'm suffering from melee mobs - replacing lock and load with blocker
---
Charisma each time is different - exp, +mutations, movement speed, trading, depends on situation.
---
**THIS IS FOR BLODIED PA HEAVY GUNNER**  
---
upd: for charisma if in a party and u have mutations and no one shares Strange in Numbers must have, IMO  
---
Also I usually use either bodyguards or inspirational, rarely squad maneuvers
---
Depending on the size of your blueprint it won't place anywhere
---
where to get plans for that gun?
---
I could've sworn I shared a level 2 perk at CHR rank 3, when someone else was sharing magnetic personality. You've got me doubting myself now
---
Looked into Bethesda’s posts on it, it’s advertised as “high score weekend. Double dailies” July 23-27
---
I’m at level 46 right now, really impressed with how pleasant people are overall in the game. I usually avoid mp games like the plague, but this has been really welcoming thus far.
---
I must admit that hackers on PC games is one of the reasons why i tend to prefer console gaming.
---
Yup. Just FYI the decontamination showers are on when the event is going on. So you don’t have to waste your radaway just hop in during your collection runs.
---
Get the energy ammo perk to reduce weight of them. I got 30 sitting in my stash waiting for scorched beats. I have a 3* bloodied gat laser, and I farms cores from monoganah and posedian, although I need to go back to the standard receiver cause the charging one sucks, but I can rip through Seirra Bravos once they land they're done for.
---
No shit lmao, and I was asking for advice on how to report him in anyway, not your opinion on what happened.
---
Oh damn, that makes a hell of a lot of sense. Thanks so much!
---
only team members can loot bodies from something you killed, or if someone also did enough damage to it before it died. most items are generated for each player who can loot them. sometimes though this isn't the case and it i first come first serve, like with Flux components.
---
It astounds me that people think workshops are a wealth of resources worth fighting for. And then get upset when people fight in a PvP zone. I was at Abandoned Bogtown with another player. Classic bloodied sniper. I stood next to the bench, considered getting the SCORE challenge done, then saw him perched like a hawk and ready to get the insta kill the moment PvP unlocked. I waved and moved on, letting him have the shop. Later on, I found a workshop with nobody around, took it for my challenge, ran the initial defense against creatures, and then walked away so someone else could claim it. I’ve gotten through every one of these claim workshops without exchanging gunfire with another player. It really can be that simple.
---
I’ve been playing consistently for 2 weeks now, and I’ve had this happen to me 5 times. Higher level players just keep giving me stuff for free, and I always feel so bad. I tried to give some of them some useful materials as thanks, but the most recent one dropped it, waved to me, then ran off :( 
---
It’s been a big help though, and if I see anyone around my level or lower, I’ll drop stuff for them as well. It isn’t always much, but I hope that it helps them anyway.
---
Aren't there clues to this in-game as well? Whitespring bunker terminal entries and Beckett mentioning a cult that believes it's all a  "terminal game" or something?
---
AA also stacks with tank killer. Maxed out you are bypassing something like 75% of armor. End result is usually more damage dealt than with two shot+ tank killer
---
I never understand why it is cool to cheat in a game...
---
Somebody can tell me?
---
Sod the display I want to be able to use the Pool table properly with a friend !
---
Get that
---
It needs some sort of buff as it is strictly worse than both the fixer and handmade rifles and the only enemies it is good against are human mobs. It also is slightly slower with the fire rate than a handmade if I remember correctly so upping the damage to be more than the handmade would be completely justified.
---
I have started smacking legendaries bare fisted now. I've got enough Strength to get a tag but there's absolutely no chance of one shotting them. Takes slightly longer since I have to go into my Pip-Boy and unequip but makes sure it's fair enough for everyone.
---
I like that, but why adrenaline to 1?
---
Also happy cake day
---
You say you enjoy exploring but won't explore because the enemies aren't fun to kill? 🤔
---
But anyways.. from what I understand you look at an enemy and it'll display your level 50+ and if a lower level player saw that enemy it'll display their level and the enemy will do equal damage to both the low and high level player and take equal damage.
---
hopefully that made sense
---
I'm running heavy gun though, 50 cal and minigun
---
Never thought about them tbh honest, to busy running round like a loon lol
---
If buffed, it would replace the Fixer. Key element to enjoy it is to understand that it is supposed to hurt by raining radiation damage on the enemy.
---
I have maybe 6 or 7 good ones. Only problem is learning mods.
---
try talking to or buying something from duchess first... for some reason, it made smiley sell to me
---
45 by the end of Monday
---
Noob question:  how can I tell in-game when someone has nuked and it is time to try to scramble for resources like this?  I don’t recall seeing anything after about two weeks of play.  Thanks.
---
Yeah the issues with Assaultrons made the last Encrytpid event I did so damn terrible. No one could stay alive because we were all getting damn near instantly melted by the Imposter. I mean the thing could easily wreck you before without this bug/change so the current change is a bit annoying to say the absolute least.
---
Maybe someone was trying to get Assaultrons back to FO4 levels of scary, but they clearly went overboard because these things are worse than they were in FO4.
---

---
If you make your camp near Vault 76, that’s where I look for low levels. My camp is in between the Wayward and Flatwoods. If you ever see HamonBusta on Xbox, send me a message and I’ll hook you up!
---
I always check up on free stuff, and today there was a free sticker on the atomic shop on the main menu, and i went ahead to find this
---
😂 That can't be right. The player icon is 25 atoms and the pistol is 200
---
You also get a full set as reward for completing belly of the beast
---
Just a bunch of shitlords that are either deluded into thinking they are skilled or a bunch of low self esteem losers that like the power that comes with ruining other players experiences. My guess is they were bullied alot in school. Of course it could just be edgy trolls.
---
Not factoring in the added dailies or double SCORE weekend
---
Only the last two are exclusive to PC. Well, NW hacking isn't exclusive, just much more common
---
Yea I had a guy come and drop 3 shot guns and amour
---
One time I went to a vendor on my main, they had every single PA jetpack plan on sale for 500 caps a piece bought every single one cause i had none.
---
Hahaha I think I've said the exact same thing to my 9 year old.
---
I believe it man I was 99 when the run started and I just hit 245 after finishing the daily's today
---
How does that even happen? Amazing
---
And yet Massachusetts and New York have a common border, one is a Rhotic and the other is Non-Rhotic accent
---
When i first started the game there was a bag right outside Vault 76 with fusion cores, junk/Scrap, some armour pieces and a couple guns with ammo. Really carried me through the first couple of level ups. Now i just go to 76 and drop any unsellable or bulk items (ammo, surplus grenades, certain foods and misc otems) hoping a newbie finds them like i did
---
I don’t want text chat. It’ll just be people spamming it to sell items just like WOW always was. Get on discord or something for text chat, most people do that instead anyways I’m sure. An “in-game” alliances is just another way to say guilds, which I don’t want either. There are too many third party tools that support these functionalities. More exploration areas(Nuka world, other US states), unique events, map additions, and boss fights- that’s what I want. Social tools, not so much.
---
Don't know if it's still the case but bashing really lowers the durability of the weapon so I don't think it's advised.
---
Can't answer your original question as I don't use bashing, hope someone can
---
I have the exact same issue. My atoms said around 800 yesterday but when I go into the store I have 420. 
---
Today I went to a new zone and I completed couple challenges doing that and it ticked over into 900-ish atoms. Went into the store and it still changes to 420 atoms. 
---
I wanted that wallpaper set that was on sale but this probably won't get fixed before it stops being on sale.
---
I haven't heard that tbh but I haven't seen many players with it on, the piper outfit is HD (fallout 4) so maybe they didn't think we'd notice it low res? But fallout 3 and NV isn't HD so it'll defiantly need a touch up for sure otherwise it'll look really weird 😅
---
You want to really blow your mind? You can rename your power armor frames so you know exactly what armor they are 🤯
---
From my understanding, it's usually considered a waste. If you don't have any legendary weapons, I suppose it would be an upgrade; just don't go out of your way for it.
---
I use an assassin/aprefresh/sentinel heavy leather set on my main. Yes it makes a huge difference to have a set rather than one piece
---
Yeah it's shut down, vault raids tanked and no one liked em so they closed the project.
---
It's not in the game at the moment.
---
me when i perform vigilante justice on every roaming raider i see
---
Looks like it, I can see the wires from them.
---
It was basically a feature that was broken most of the times and honestly I am glad its gone. Not in the sense of I disliked it but bc it really needed work.
---
I felt it was to rushed during development (worse than 76 rushed as a game)
---
I believe I read somewhere they are doing something similar in the future but don't quote me as I can not find that info again.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Got me. I assume either trolling or grinding for in-game achievements
---
Antiarmor is good against some enemies, but it has to be said: bloodied is king. My bloodied handmade causes more damage than my antiarmor handmade, whatever the enemy.
---
It's just another caveat to their job. They can only reply with pre-prepared replies, so they are only really allowed to talk in the few days surrounding an update or in case of severe emergency
---
xbone unfortunately. Not that i have the collector to make them. I have the bullion to buy it but.. i haven't
---
I have about 350 of the treasure maps, keep meaning to sell them but never have space in my vendors.
---
It’s amazing that high level players stop by my shop, buy things they don’t need and leave plans/recipes behind! As a returning player I expected to be bullied.
---
It's also the only SS armor piece with a deep pocketed mod.
---
But its not... It gives you rads to so its kinda like in between dirty and pure water, but you can't sit there and say its the same, pure water gives no rads
---
Good thing I quit this game before the "season" stuff started. Being forced to login daily to progress because of daily limits and what not is scummy and manipulative. Instead of making the game fun for everybody that have stuck by them all this time, Beth creates artificial timegates to maximize the chances of you spending more money. Fuck this dev
---
16 times the detail
---
I can't stand when people do that. 10 people trying to get hits and we all gotta compete with that damn turret.
---
I finally ran out of of keycards yesterday doing them. Today is gonna be spent finding vertibots to get a few more before the dbl cp is up
---
I know. They should add it in
---
Santatron for me. Collects toys that have lead paint making him an easy lead source
---
Maybe when the next Fallout game drops it will be revealed we were in a simulation.
---
That's my theory, I do believe we might be in a simulation.
---
I know I don’t need it, It’s the only thing I carry. During that event you can’t let the mobs linger around the pipes. I guard the one I’m standing at. That’s it.
---
TSE was a way cooler meta than bloodied/junkie.
---
They would need to make some changes so that we dont have those big holes between the pieces like in 4 but IF they would figure that out that would absolutely be my next purchase from The shop
---
It will probably be quite delayed, playtesting is probably going to expose a lot of issues, with a lot of people power leveling i see it as very possible they will accidentally turn the game into impossibly hard for people who just wanted to be sure to complete the season.
---
Everyone using shotgun perks too?
---
Whatever one you have. That’s the best one available.
---
Yeah. Pretty much. I mean at this point, if the only solution was to install anti-cheat software, I'd concede and do it, only for the reason I'd finally be on an even playing field and hopefully get to beat the pudding out of those d-bags.

Started saveing mine to

I have met so many very cool folks on there. Some who just like to drop off plans near the Overseer's camp, met a guy who helped me and another low level complete quests, showed off his house and cool explosives, then gave us combat armor. Others I met are just really nice. You join their group and they talk to you, give you tips, or just hang out and have fun. I have way too much stims and radaway and I have considered dropping them off at the overseer's camp so a newbie can use them. I remember I lived off of healing salve for the first 30 or so levels.
---
There had t been server issues. I’ve played all weekend and not once had there been Ny server issues.
---
We all do. 😜👍
---
Nice. I've only run into a few trap camps. One a while back tried to use a flamethrower room, but I was able to position myself in a corner where I couldn't be damaged. I just teleported out.
---
I did get caught by a trap camp the other night. Wasn't paying attention to the lack of floor since it was covered in confetti when I went to the vendors. I fell though and it was just far enough to kill me. I was able to recover my junk with ease, but I was kind of annoyed at myself as I knew I should have put on the PA before going in. I was just being lazy.
---
I won't settle until "zep" is used.
---
TIL, thanks
---
I tried to mine the ore once but couldn't figure out what to do with it afterwards. The other people I game with also have no idea. So yeah, I treat it like a shooting gallery to get lots of XP/legendaries. 
---
Side note: I once did the event were people collected all the ore and the event finished in like two minutes, which was pretty disappointing.
---
There was a mod (can't remember the name of it) that allowed it not to have holes
---
I am pumped now!
---
I thought the same for a while now . I imagine the next fallout game will reveal this was all just a simulation/ vault tech experiment and Bethesda will justify the bugs and rocky launch through some king a social experiment.
---
No. Seek help.
---
When does it end, tomorrow?
---
We finished on 99 ore collected today :(
---
There is no bond for yourself, the bars only appear next to the other players names.
---
Yeah both would be nice. For the moment at least you can add some form of texture options than the 0 options you get for roofs and underflooring.
---
Wish I could say I was surprised. Think I am done once I get the raider tree, secret door be damned.
---
Gone from the 380s to 414.
---
It’s the 5th box that resets it to 0%. Usually not an issue until sbq when everyone opens a box lol
---
So, how are supposed to know when your bonded? I could have sworn it used to show your own progress.
---
Yes but only for pc and xbox. Sony is limiting the mod possibilities like crazy. But in fo4 its not a huge issue with either glitches or place anywhere tool. In 76 we cant do much about it
---
This might help

---
i do not think those are supposed to be free. ill have to check when i get home in a few hours
---
I really don't like how they reflect light from rooms outside of the walls.
---
Sometimes the game has really great shadow effects like when the trees are casting them, but camp structures dont cast proper shadows at all.
---
I hate how bright enclosed spaces become during the day.
---
I have only ever made one character on my account.
---
Uuuh that's crazy. Are you on a console or PC?  
---
I only hope that people didn't spend their atoms thinking they are getting "free item".
---
So grateful, or it was on accident. I dont know how many times I emoted team up or take a picture instead of hi.
---
Quite a bit
---
Im on PC, but then again I wasnt able to claim them
---
Move your camp
---
Only in real life.
---
They’re bonding to you so you only see their progress bars.. your name is basically just a place holder on your screen. They see your name with a bonding progress bar.
---
I wish we could put down at least one more, and have them each interact or say things to each other. Of course they would collect different things but imagine santatron and the raider bot together.
---
such a short shelf life
---
They wouldn't require a genocide if they would leave me alone. Looking at you molerats with a gps tracker on me and only show up when I have 1 second left in my fast travel countdown and then burrow.
---
Cant have both
---
Invite me Bwilson1973
---
Thanks for the info i’ll be sure not to equip it until this bug is fixed.👍🏻
---
Yup I'm playing via Game Pass as well, though I originally created my character using Bethesda's launcher during their free period.
---
Please
---
This is awesome work.
---
I use mine to move my .38 ammo.
---
But those achivements are not true ones...
---
And trolling? Like 5 years old kids in the sandbox? "Oh, look at me, I am big and strong and I wreck others playtime"?
---
I sometimes find a new player who can hear me. Open up trade and let them pick up any plans for free that I have on me.
---
When you join a group. Only your teammates have a blue bar. 
---
If you want to see how much bonus you’re getting, like 4x event xp. Or 4x intelligence bonus, it will tell you on the top right. Above all the player names. 
---
That’s your way of knowing when “you” are getting the max bonus.
---
Let's post this again tomorrow.
---
Extra bashing damage isn't good on anything.
---
invest in the 'construction' perk card under intelligence. It really lowers the amount of flux you need for it.
---
I've been playing since.... April 2019? I joined right after faschnacht last year. Don't think I've ever seen campfire tales drop a badge.
---
I think poseidon terminal resets for the power up event.
---
F. I have a big camp not in the picture it's gonna be a pain to place it.
---
I play the objective.
---
That is Adrenaline Perk. Adrenal Reaction mutation is working. :)
---
It's a video game. Don't overthink it.
---
Top floor on Fort Defiance theres a lot of plastic plates and cutlery in the kitchen.
---
Doing the daily overseer rank daily and saw a level 99. This has been going on for awhile though, never fixed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8B1QzmVK3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8B1QzmVK3o)
---
Do you have adrenaline?
---
It’s broken
---
One time I had grinded out like 300+ lead but then a random workshop started to try and claim itself and I found a workbench and was scrapping weapons when a high level shreds me and steals all my junk I had grinded for for hours and hours :(
---
I've spent very little time in adventure mode beyond what's needed for the dailies. XP is easy even without it doubled and levels don't mean much since I'm 200. I've been farming up overseer ranks in NW and finally got some spiffy Inferno power armor paint.
---
Blueprints are a mess. There are likely quite a few reasons it won't place other than the ground being flat.
---
They're best forgotten about unless you're going to build a camp with that in mind.
---
Same, if nobody bothers to go there then I'm not bothering either. Last time I went there hoping that ppl would join, some level 75 dude shows up and starts the event, only to bail a few minutes in cuz he can't handle the mobs.
---
Remember to steal the toilet paper
---
Behind the platform where you talk to the supervisor to start the event is a hopper to put the ore in, every multiple of 25 gains an increase in the level reward for completing the event.  
---
As was mentioned by sgolder247 if the people running the ore wait until the last 30 seconds to put the ore in (which ends the event if theres 100), you can still farm the xp and legendarys as well as get the best rewards.
---
The one below monogah power station?
---
I’m coming for you!
---
That's what I'm saying, maybe before this patch he had adrenaline procced, and that was causing way more damage.
---
I wish they would buff bashing
---
You're right. The reason I thought about legs because it already has "calibrated shocks" and this could be a good replacement of it. And I just forgot about arm mods. Because it does not have any useful mods.
---
Two shot sucks, accuracy is worse than a stormtrooper.
---
So that is where it was stationed before ending up in Boston.
---
An "L" is a loss. He's telling you to take the loss and stop responding so you wont keep getting downvoted.
---
Are you connected with wifi? I have a similar internet speed and when I used wifi I would dc several times a day. After switching to a wired connection I dc maybe once every couple months. I'm also on PC so IDK if it is worse on consoles.
---
Hiding in an outhouse there is even funnier lol.
---
A gauss rifle lose the explosive effect with supressor but keep the dmg boost from demo expert
---
Gotcha...Any clue when they’re going to fix that shit by the way
---
I feel you, I’ve had a greenhouse dome that’s been stuck in place for 8 months, can’t scrap it can’t move it, can do anything but have it exactly where I placed it the first attempt. Which having 200 hours in putting the rest of the camp together was a huge blow to my favorite part of the game :/
---
More than agree, I can only equip the Red Rocket Ranger skin, yet I have 7-8 for my X0-1 PA , I just want my nuka cola skin but on T-65 looks cool with the gold [50.cal](https://50.cal) skin.
---
I hate this guy. Why, when we are going to have to deal with this asshole a million times to do his lame quest could they not fix him.  He is always stuck in the bunk bed or sleeping.  He is so boring and says the same thing on repeat.  It makes no sense.  Would it have been hard to have like 3 or 4 different daily quest givers in foundation?  Is it beyond anyone’s ability to make Ward say a few different things.  Finally someone with the guts to help. I hate this. Like you haven’t seen me rescue your shit every day the past 3 months you piece of detritus.
---
This is the real post right here
---
I just did that at a train station a few minutes ago and somebody opened the door and I opened up fire and killed them.  Normally I never see anybody and just die at the end but he opened the wrong door.
---
Obviously, no. They broke the Terms of Service (ToS), and deserved to be banned.
---
Bethesda has 0 sympathy for cheaters.
---
Chemist it is then, thanks.
---
(plays Surfin' Bird song by Trashmen)
---
No idea
---
I have the plague walker mutation. I kill them just walking by. Muahahaha!
---
I also kill people's Brahmin if I get too close. Which doesn't give me the same feeling.
---
50 per shot dont sound that bad. Are you sneak build?
---
It’s not just an xp farm, it also spawns the largest possible amount of legendary enemies of any event. I get frustrated when I’m with a large group of players, and they complete it as quick as possible. The enemies don’t continue spawning when the event is completed.
---
Under optimal circumstances, I always tell people to gather enough ore to push us over 75%, hut then have them wait until the last 30 seconds to turn in the last of it, and complete the event. With less than 3 people, it’s not even possible to hit 100 ore anyway, and far too many players just don’t care to collect it in the first place.
---
Yes, of course.
---
it's a graveyard smash
---
I believe that is when they die with plasma weapons and turn into the goopile.  When they respawn they glitch.  So creepy.
---
man thats harsh, i've only ever finished the event with a reward for collecting 50, i'd love to get the full 100 someday.
---
Supposedly update 21 it'll be fixed
---
I feel ya
---
There is something weird going on atm where workshops are sometimes listed as unowned, but when you get there it says you’re taking it over. Happened to me a couple of times now.
---
And had you been in the majority, it wouldn't have been removed. So let's just accept that it was broken and most of us didn't enjoy it and move on.
---
I hate that!
---
This has happened to me. Had one staircase that i could not remove. Only selution i have seen is to move
---
Then why don't those invaded go switch servers? How is playing the game, like it was meant to, ruins it?
---
All the single player elitists are crybabies lul
---
Really? OK I didn’t even know there was a time frame in mind yet. I figured it was gonna be next year or something, thx
---
Did beth fix the bug where you can't take off the mask until you relog?
---
Okay just wanted to make sure. Could still be a side effect of them trying to stop that would be my guess
---
they updated healing factor to not work if you are starving, so it no longer keeps you from having to eat. healing factor also stops working when you are in combat. it is a more of a "im not fighting, its safe to heal for free"  mutation
---
yeah, its absolutly great. did it three times, always solo bc nobody showed up. it was really fun and great xp but i didnt get the xbox achievment. is it broken? or does it have to be with other players?
---
Update. They got me.
---
Yeah, they broke it with the last update I want to say but it's a known issue.
---
Sure because anyone that isn't you is wrong.  We all know bethesda caters to those that cry the most. All the posts were about how difficult and unbeatable they were.
---
This is what I like to hear.
---
Explosive energy weapons that Bethesda put in the game then removed shouldn’t be in the game?! 🤔
---
oh ok, thanks for explanation, yeah it s fine i can keep getting downvoted all day long, doesn t really matter.
---
Only done this once. Was myself and it was hectic. I did find out the camp spot but it was later in round
---
Oh yeah, I definitely know when they broke it. LOL I noticed instantly on my melee toon
---
thanks i just feel like i can’t repay him for all the time and effort he gave to help me in the game
---
Now it was a guy called "FOr357Punk"... Wow, much amazing... Punched me and my whole team to death.
---
Its Bugthesda we are talking about...if its not totally broken its atleast bugged/glitched af 😅 
---
This company gets more pathetic every day.
---
Imagine Fallout 76 made by a decent company , could be the most epic game ever
---
The best rewards are max level rewards not XP and level 40 legendaries. Forest vs trees.
---
Some reason it performed better too, least on mine. Was interesting at first but looking at older videos, it was definitely better looking before wastelanders. The sh poison stacks they needed to fix but keep the rest.
---
  I would counter some people might not have known said item was duped.  
---
I’m L214, been playing for a bit over...year and a half.  Some may say if you’ve been playing that long, you should know (or know better)....
---
 I’m a melee build, and the stuff that is being duped seems to be energy weapons that I don‘t use/collect, so they are not golden items to me.
---
Srue, I’m active in this forum, but I do not track, memorize, or otherwise know off the top of my head what’s legacy, what’s being duped, etc. (I do remember xmas presents, but beyond that, I couldn’t tell you). 
---
Too much other ...stuff... in my world to keep up with.  
---
The intricate details behind who’s breaking the rules , how they do it, and what they are doing ... don’t know, don’t care (beyond the annoyance of having my vendors turned off for a few weeks).  
---
I would venture there’s a load of other people in the same position.
---
Radiation Rumble is hard to measure as ghouls almost instantly respawn when you kill them, so the XP depends on your killspeed.
---
When I solo the event I kill around 175 ghouls (counted by looting the meat piles after the event has ended).
---
On the double XP weekend with Intelligence and XP boosts my build usually got 1300 XP per ghoul ... so thats 227k XP.
---
Without any INT/XP boost I think you get around 500 XP per ghoul on the double XP weekend, so the event should be around 87k XP.
---
Hmm. i've had healing factor for ages and not once has it stopped me fast travelling. And the few times i couldn't fast travel is because i was getting farted on by a scorchbeast. Is something not effecting the healing factor?
---
Exact number is 250 items/containers. At 251 the 1st item you picked up respawns and so on
---
Edit for clarity: any container counts as a single item on the 250, regardless of the amount of items in the container
---
They really should. Would be Nice IF you could actually use it
---
Rabbits are so hard to find when you need them that I just unload tons of fury on them. Fuck them.
---
Not saying that the game doesn't have the terrain right. From what I've heard they did a great job recreating this area, but why would you implement a building system thats based on a flat terrain, in a hilly terrain, none of there stuff is ment for the terrain of this game. Hell I went from a regular base in the bog, to throwing down two red rocket garages opposite each other facing each other with some foundations in-between for everyone to just come and see some displays and use my vendors, plus I'm spitting distance from watoga station so after everyone is done with scorched earth I get a ton of traffic. And usually have people buy up the jetpack plans i get from scorched earth.
---
Off topic there for a second. Basically the system of building is ment for a flat terrain map, instead of a mountain  terrain.
---
They also need to fix medics and berserkers
---
I was in such a tizzy while thankful to the first guy who helped me that I did the radiation emote lmfao. He of course gave me Rad X and Radaway.😆😆
---
I’m just jealous people have events that are populated.  If there are people, I need to do the heavy lifting since they either fail because high levels don’t do squat or low levels can’t keep up.
---
I have a VE flamer .. But it's lvl40, sigh.
---
I was bonding up until two days ago, now nothing PS4 
---
I have tried all I can think of, different teams,logging off, following team members, all events... nothing!  ???
---
I agree on berserkers but medics is Great with shotguns
---
There are a few things to look for. If you are on when the nuke is launched there will be a server alert called "Death from Above." Look for the big red circle on the map. Sometimes you load into a server and there's already an active nuke zone. It's the big red circle. Nuked flora is still available after the nuke zone expires ( they last 2 hours) but creatures only drop components in an active zone. 
---
Check out [mappalachia](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) for places to nuke for specific flux types.
---
That is a top shelf pun.
---
I would but im completely broke
---
Id recomend removing before the anti pvpers come man
---
too bad you cant build it on a skyscrapper
---
Good one. One guy stood by for the picture thinking i really meant it. Meh.
---
google doc says 180. YouTube vid says 255. I tried testing it this morning and fucked up twice but it had already taken me 20 mins so i gave up
---
Send'em back to Rust I say
---
I'm happy to hear they were owned
---
Congratulations member 👍
---
I like standing the way the left diagram is, it allows me to pick off enemies harassing the non-stealth ore grabbers.
---
"is this quest bugged?"
---
(doesn't read text)
---
Thank you!!! I know I made the enclave proud
---
I agree.
---
Unequipped it when it stopped working after the patch. Gun-fu does well against the crowd.
---
Who says that this is how the game was meant to be ? People like you enjoy crushing level 1s until a lvl 300 comes around and opens up your empty head lol. You wanna be a raider ? Cool dude. Go raid but don't be a loser troll and ruin everyone's fun just bc you're selfish and wanna kill innocent people like a sociopath lmao
---
Yo this violates sub rules
---
I lost my disease last night when I went to the sulfer fountain
---
Hey /u/LoneVaultWanderer. Thought it might help to let you know what I have found/have been told by support. I play via Gamepass and only Gamepass and yesterday I was told that the Atoms were going to the Bethesda.net version of the game and that they could see them properly awarded there. Oddly, I don't have any other version of the game save Gamepass. So it seems like the accounts are getting their wires crossed. 
---
When I play and complete challenges it will show the new Atoms amount on the bottom right. However, while still in-game, if I click the Atomic Store the number changes to 690, which is what I have earned prior to this issue. So definitely an issue with accounts crossing.
---
You can only use one of the technical data for the quest each time, and it only triggers when you pick up a new one, so having them in your inventory won’t trigger the quest again, so you might as well sell them to a vendor or put them in your vendor. Next time you find technical data in a container, etc, it should trigger the quest again. Apparently you used to be able to do it as many times as possible if you had technical data in your inventory but they fixed it.
---
As Sneaky as it gets.
---
Sorry man, wasn"t paying attention. Leaving the game now
---
Yeah but since then I don’t find it anywhere is what I’m saying
---
All PVP should be moved to Nuclear Winter and Adventure Mode should be purely PVE. Mainly because I'm tired of accidentally hitting other players and occasionally my team mates with my Tesla Rifle.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ABotkbZ.jpg
---
Bethsheda doesn’t care about the functionality and the fun anymore just dollars in big bags. You have to be rifle or a corporate drone to get.5 close to getting Todd in motivation. It’s depressing at least and riot / boycott worthy at best. Anyone up to #ban bugthesda
---
agreed, its not a matter of the items, its just so obviously exploitable. a few hours of effort for one developer would save so much crying.
---
We’re doing a shit poor job of showing/teaching them what real glitches and hackers look like.  Hell, on some forums you can’t even say cheater anymore, it’s ‘gaming chair’.  We’re gonna pay for not sitting down and teaching history.
---
You’re right, it is! Especially in vault 94, everybody be profusely sweating, looking shiny and damp as hell before they have to go out and get killed. Maybe there’s no AC? Bethesda would surely have a legitimate reason behind this texture flaw 😏
---
You do know that you dont get sneak bonuses IF target is in combat with anything?
---
People mess up with the containers themselves. I've found people state the list just counts the items on the ground and they normally have the lower numbers. Angry Turtle did a lot of research and my own research matched his very closely. Either I lost count and its 245 or he was right- either way, if you overshoot it (go for 255 instead of 250 or 180) you should be fine
---
There are times where they prob dont want you to drop because you have peiple like me literally giving away plans for free just to get rid of them
---
(sigh)
---
&gt;!MODUS isn't a part of the enclave, you actually just betrayed them by helping him!&lt;
---
&gt;!(nah, jk)!&lt;
---
Then fuck it :)
---
Thank you!  Than you very much!
---
Yep! I got purified water binded to the "-" cuz its very accesible and can drink at all times.
---
That looks neat does it still allow people to sit down?
---
Yeah my Mort is MIA after the questline (xbox)
---
Oh boo hoo a cheater gets called out. Want some proof? Here he is exploiting. 
---
https://i.gyazo.com/7d8baeebc6abfb76710518824c9defef.jpg
---
Was low 400s, aiming for 500
---
Wow
---
I had this.  The only way currently to get rid of it is to move your camp, and then move it back.  Likely you won't be able to place any of the blueprints because of bogus errors that didn't happen when you actually built, but you can just use the individual items to rebuild.  Just scrap the plans.
---
Yes it is adding like an hour of work to rebuild, but it will work.  I actually like my camp more after the rebuild.  Changed some elements around and it works better than before.
---
This one could use a rework of its rewards and mechanics. Right now, you get the most out of it by just standing there killing—more XP, more legendaries, more bodies to loot that drop ammo, chems, junk and Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets. 
---
Completing the event gives you about 4 ghouls’ worth of XP, a few caps, some scrap and a ridiculously low chance at the Rad Barrel plan and a hazmat suit you’ll never wear, can’t repair and has weight. 
---
I can’t blame anyone for just killing at this event, hell, you can even murder the non-essential NPC’s for extra XP. 
---
A better system would work like this: 
---
Creature kill XP stays the same—This is the big draw, and the event requires lots of killers. 
---
Collecting ore should give 100 base XP per piece collected, before buffs—This gives lower level players or those who don’t want to fight over kills another objective that still has benefits. 
---
All corpses should be lootable by everyone, provided they’ve met at least some minimal objective; maybe deposited 5 ore or killed 5 creatures —This should be the default at every event. 
---
The event shouldn’t stop at 100 ore collected, but continue to produce harder and harder enemies with each new tier—It’s self defeating to end it early when the best rewards come from prolonging the event. 
---
NPC’s that need to be protected should regenerate health after 100 ore is collected or be replaced by another “Shift” of workers—It’s hard to keep them alive at all, even harder if extra hard enemies attack after 100 ore. Without this, people would hoard their ore until the very end and get pissy at people who deposit it earlier, we don’t need any more of that kind of thing.
---
Clever use of the conduits! They make for very good masts, and as cable anchor points, they give a great impression of ropes going every which way. Nice work!
---
Thank you !
---
That's the first thinkg I did to mine after I got it too.
---
Boycott...maybe
---
What wrong with the current trade system?!?  Maybe ppl currently don’t know how to use it but you basically just set a price and the persons buy it from you
---
If ya doing trade for trade then both agree to a fair price and sell it to each other.
---
We do have a trade screen ppl just don’t use it
---
I just finished top 6. I got put at the bottom of power plant and I went to top. Sat until last ring and then had to move. It was so easy and so nice. Finally got to level 24 and only have that one last winter reward to get. Lol
---
Get cannibal
---
Around Christmas is my guess, IF they get them working and dont break em like normal perks 😅
---
Don' t even get me started on Feral Ghouls... I'll kill a charred feral ghoul with my bloodied Gauss Rifle and before I can say "got 'em" another one sneaks up behind me and kills me. I swear you kill one and 10 more show up. The other problem I have is that feral ghouls are too quiet, so you never hear them walking or running up to you. It also makes no sense to me... How does an irradiated human slapping you kill you in seconds? And how can an irradiated human's slap damage a robot to the point where parts of the robot fall off?
---
hahaha probably lol. some hidden stairs behind her desk.
---
Inside or out of the mine? It has a chance to spawn at any cultist area at midnight but its just too much caps to travel to each one which makes me upset it's impossibly rare.
---
I like the contrast of slaughtering ghouls with calming meditation speaker guy.
---
What is so overpowered about stealth armor? I crafted one but thought that it didn't have stats as good as my other armor. Does it have some hidden stats or traits that I don't know about?
---
It’s funny, because not worrying about stims, bullets or supplies is what makes the game *less* fun for me. I loved being lower level and striving for stuff. Now I’m high level and have pretty much everything I need the game is a drag.
---
It literally gives you a warning that Workshops are PvP zones,  holding them will put you at risk of invasion, therefore it's intended. Hardly a troll move.
---
Crushing level 1s isn't an issue when the forest is surrounded with low priority workshops. Every high level player only cares about the ones in the mire/bog/power plants.
---
They don't bother going down to Tyler county racetrack.
---
I feel like elitists have a stigma of pvp because they got 0-20 in a old cod they tried.
---
 all you have to do is get in PA and exit it, mask gone
---
That's definitely unique! Great job
---
ya just gotta find that fair player vendor. saw a guy selling the Vats Unknown for 6k caps other day. seriously. who wants that garbo.
---
I went from 110 to 146
---
Atom shop says I have 280... my map after the last challenge completed said 1330....
---
I was gonna grab a camp kit....
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I couldn't figure out why my quick select menu wasnt loading but I was gaining hp instead when I started-took me so long to get used to the d-pad options on console
---
It’s my favorite event personally. You should mention though just in case people come across your post that haven’t been there that it’s a PVP event. Hate to see some low level try to go through there and have the worst experience ever and then never wanna go back
---
The camp spot will move. If you pick up the bucket, it relocates
---
It’s definitely less taxing than loading in a character with more items than necessary. If there’s queens being ran and a few of my friends and I load in our trading characters we’ve DC’d servers. Some of those items would potentially be thrown to scrip if we could actually get rid of them
---
Another fun fact, you can move the location of the bucket just by picking it up
---
They were a broken mess so Bethesda decided to remove it from the game
---
Mirelurk Kings are pretty OP. When I didn't have any good weapons except for my magic shotgun and sniper rifle (both of which I don't use anymore), I was guaranteed to die at least once from those things before I'd kill it.
---
Yeah I've been doing a ton of missions for double XP weekend and everything I earned vanished. So frustrating. I was gonna make a bunch of camp upgrades
---
Yea I unfortunately have been home waiting on covid testing, but thanks to this and 2x exp weekend I just got to lev 70 something on the run ( SS gilli paint).
---
Sugar grove and the one underneath it are the places I normally go.
---
That makes sense...Fallout games have always been a bit klunky in that way so it doesn't surprise me at all.    Still, some of my best memories are born from those klunky moments.    Shooting naked people who won't die might be a new one.
---
What platform are you on? I’ll make you one for free if you’re on xbox
---
abandoned bog town has a TON of desk fans and type writers in the top floor of the office building
---
Hell, if you're on XBox, I'll craft you one for free...now, for a legendary one, that will certainly cost you.
---
Are you100% sure I'd love if it did?
---
True. I never have anyone come in but I suppose it’s different seeing a 300+ vs a lvl 23 hanging out there
---
I know that trick but with the size of it that doesn’t seem to help much
---
Probably taste like lobster. That's why I don't eat sea bugs.
---
The legendary variants are the best automatic guns in the game. Especially in stealth and or VATS 
---
The base version isnt bad either, if you dont have anything better may be nice to have one to use. If you're on xbox I can craft you any leveled version for free
---
If you’re on PS4 I can craft you one for free

It's definitely still a troll move, it's just encouraged by Bethesda which makes it even worse. Idk about you but I've been winning battle royales left and right lol. I dont log onto fallout public servers to get my shooting game fix because there's better places to do that. If you want to do it on fallout then nobody can really stop you from being a troll but at least come to terms with what you are
---
T-65.....but I miss my Nuke shine skin......C'mon Beth sort yer shit out.
---
Oh so that’s why I’ve seen a tent near there! I thought the spawns where all hugged.
---
What I meant was a whole new list. At least half the songs are from 3 carried to 4 to 76. Bethesda half asses alot
---
I've been bummed by the broken challenges. Some of those have really good atom returns
---
It just works
---
If you downgrade everything.
---
I agree the cmdr's lines get kinda old but it's 10x preferable to the hippie.  No, I do not dance.  Go take a shower.
---
Why does she look so dirty?  Maybe if there was an outfit that cleaned her up, but none that I tried did that.
---
Knowing bethesda, i say atom shop
---
Aw, thanks for the offer! I'm on PS4 unfortunately but this is why I love this community haha
---
Overseers house has some in the bathroom by the front door, there’s always some in sunshine meadows industrial farm and pick up every desk fan you find and globe. Sugar Grove is amazing for desk fans but high level. It’s a bit of a grind for screws but 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It’s good for bugged “magic” weapons but the Gatling plasma fires too slow to benefit from it
---
Same. I dont really mind those smaller bugs most of the time but its a bit too much some times
---
okay seriously, that New Hope scene was a trap and they let them get away
---
Someone once followed me through the silo using stealth. I didn't know they were there until I was at the keycard thingy and they inserted a card right before I did. Then they launched the nuke on my camp. 
---
Then they chased me around the silo trying to kill me lol what a fun time I Had laughing and running around making them chase me
---
what is a joke
---

---
Yeah, but 6 whole movies of "letting them get away?"
---
YikEs
---
That makes me rather sad. Are there enemies that explosives are still effective against?
---
And on the campfire but this looks better
---
I shoot off my 3 star gamma gun any time someone wants to throw down. They usually leave me alone lol
---
Yeah I honestly don't even know how people get good Legendaries. I have a bunch of scrip saved up so I could just roll the dice with that but I also saw people suggesting saying it to buy some of the materials he sells for... something else? Armor? So free Legendaries would be pretty crazy haha
---
Sorry man I aint got time to read yer stupid post I gotta go find 3 vacuum tubes ........again.
---
RNJesus has failed you
---
it's a very elaborate trap
---
Im just getting back into the game so maybe I'm off here, but intelligence seems to have limited utility except maybe for power armor. Even at fairly low levels I found myself getting legendary equipment drops that were generally better than anything I could craft.
---
Isn't there an xp boost from intelligence as well though? I've been seeing 2% per point.
---
Oh seriously? That’s fantastic!
---
I'm pretty sure it had the atx file name, meaning its atomic shop
---
Guess it will be coming during the fall along with the first BoS content drop
---
no PA available here...
---
Yeah, it was a fantastic trap - the last three movies stole my money while I wasn't looking.
---
I'm a lone wolf kinda player. Most times I ignore team invites.
---
But this guy messaged me asking if I had any crimson flux. I didn't. Sorry pal. Then he asked me if I wanted to launch a nuke. Ummm. Sure!
---
It was nice. He knew how to run a silo proper, no cheesing it or lock picking. We had a good queen fight.
---
He didn't go gaga at my level and spam me with trade invites or requests for free shit.
---
Made a friend. Will totally be joining more randos.
---
Idk how PvP interaction/invasion is a troll move. 
---
Are dark souls invasions troll moves by that definition? What about Rust? Doom Eternals battle mode?
---
Ahhhh. That makes sense -- how do you get Legendary versions of them? I'm not sure I entirely understand the Legendary system in this game. I figured it was purely random chance so I could end up with one next Legendary enemy I killed but I'm also assuming it also takes into account the kind of enemy?
---
And thanks for the offer! I'm on PS4 unfortunately but thank you!
---
Tag them don't tag it's not my problem no one helping me tag them and give me that helping hand
---
I hope someone will make one for you, they’re really cheap to make. Good luck
---
Oh OK, I figured everybody at least kept a suit of PA on them in case of an emergency
---
For the first time on Xbox I've seen one person who had a Captain Cosmo Power Armor already and it looks cool and thick and I like it. Haha.  I heard about people using this weird Gode mode exp exploit but it requires a legacy weapon to make it work and that just unfair for all of us. I may be few days late to the news but I am happy you fixed the issue and possibly banned them or let them off with a warning.
---
I always thank RNG jesus for my luck with all the gold items. Only went through 200 some modules for an armor set, and 4 weapons
---
Wtf this just happened to me too.  I cant get over 480.  Everytime i get some it shows a new number on the map but when i go to the store it goes back down to 480
---
It still shows on screen even though its not applied
---
I don't do silos so no. If I do I'm helping friends who did it legitimately and have all the pieces. If you couldn't tell, I like playing the game the way it was meant to. Also, I completely understand the concept of exploiting. It's wrong. You can't justify cheating. If I were in your shoes I would just stop responding, you're obviously not getting anywhere with this.
---
That’s a cool idea as well
---
To get legendary fixers you need to meet one criteria. And that is to have the plan learned and being able to craft it.
---
There are only 3 ways to get a legendary variant:
---
-Get it from buying the ranged option from the purveyor at the Rusty Pick
---
-Certain events drop them, so far I think it was only Fasnacht, and *possibly* the ally dailies
---
-Trade with players
---
Soon I'm not gonna be able to afford to do that for my warning shot. I'm working on a Junkies/Bloodied build and it's gonna be beautiful.
---
oh with the challenge of buy 3 things i go and buy all their ammo and drop it again lmao
---
True but for those that didn’t buy the communal campfire that would work too
---
Yeah damn people for trying to be helpful and nice.
---
Are bloodied builds basically the vegans of fallout ?
---
They just cant wait to tell you what they are and they're just *waiting* to get offended about shit.
---
Since level 6.
---
The other day a level 36 and a level 40 were attacking me (level 100 or so at that point) slaughtered them, and then a half hour or so later one of their friends logged on (200+) and went ahead and destroyed me and my camp, lol, was fun tho gotta admit
---
Lol, I found a spot to stand where only 3 ghouls come at the beginning and no more show up.
---
Maybe he shot it in ...shelf defense?
---
Get scrap assaultron head, craft assaultron helmet with super duper perk. Scrap helmet to get assaultron head. Keep going until you have loads of heads and them scrap them for screws. Infinite supply as long as you keep at least one head. I have over 2000 screws now, spend 10 minutes a day until you’ve made/scrapped 20 helmets. Easy!
---
Does it still show 100% in your pipboy but you’re getting 0%? Bc I have had more than 4 opened near me. Pipboy displayed 100%. Didn’t check if it nerfed my expected xp.
---
Thanks, maybe I'll move my camp. I'm nowhere near the vault in an area with very little traffic. When I first started I had no idea what I was doing and I think I figured I wanted to be where I was less likely to be messed with.
---
I think you did repay him. It gave him an end game goal back when you really had to make your own.
---
For the Fixer, you have to have learned the plan before it is added to your legendary weapon pool. The combination of the rarity of the plan and the odds of rolling any legendary Fixer (let alone one with good effects) is why legendary Fixers are very costly if you're looking to buy/trade.
---
To get a legendary Fixer dropped you need to have learned the plan for it. Otherwise you can find them occasionally at player vendors.
---
No shit.
---
I’m trying to slowly get that jacket too!
---
Suppose you gotta be unyielding to get it.
---
You can sit anywhere, the plushies won't stop you, except for the sheepsquatch, it blocks all pathings.
---
T-51
---
Wow really? That would be awesome! I can wield a Level 50. I'm so tired of my .50 cal Marksman Sniper rifle which theoretically does more damage (Like 85 or 87) but it's also got such a long delay between shots &amp; has a tiny magazine that it doesn't really matter against higher level enemies like those charred fuckers lol
---
Are you talking about the one on workbenches? Wont say which one, but if its that one, its pretty useless imo
---
You literally missed the ENTIRE point of OP's frustration.
---
dO YoU nEeD a RaDaWaY/?/?
---
That’s really helpful to know
---
Gah, kill it, kill it with fire !
---
(Then cook it and eat it)
---
I guess it is a feature that some people would like I do get that, defending your workshop turf from raiders sounds fun. If I'm not using the workshop I don't even care if people take them. But if I'm standing in my workshop building something and you blow my head off ? Wtf is that ? Lol if we both want to PvP then we would both know. There's nothing wrong with sending a message asking to take the ws or even inviting the player to your party. Imagine that.... Joining forces with people instead of murdering them from behind
---
No I am not.
---
All together I made 2 other unyielding armor pieces for about 40 modules excluding the 58 tries on the leg.
---
Sneak+covert operative + vats headshot+  while holding the crit button. 
---
Make sure you have gunfu equiped.  It overides the bug that pops you out of vats after firing a few shots.
---
My bloodied 10mm pistol hits her for 200 a shot.
---
Like the other guy said if the queen is aggrod/ attacking anything even though you are in caution and see good damage numbers,but the actual damage being apllied is normal non sneak damage.  This is true for any monster.  Very annoying since the damage numbers look good.
---
Also remember the queen has a 70% damage reduction on top of 300+ DR.
---
if you do the NW dailies and all the weeklies every day you can complete the season
---
Never fight anyone at your own camp regardless of level lol I learned that after I wiped out hundreds of high level camps.
---
Yea I will I got you what’s you’re psn I’ll might have a surprise for you
---
I believe I'm on about 25 attempts at a left leg myself weirdly. Weightless seems to be the one of choice, I've had 8 of those, which could honestly be worse considering they don't take up stash space but still.
---
I dunno, guilds crapping all over my efforts to help them has continuously been the number 1 reason why I drop out of MMOs.
---
Lol, the game has so many bugs that you can probably make an entire college thesis dedicated to them
---
Gotta love that bethesda feel
---
They could always make it so that the pieces snap together
---
295 to 315 so far
---
I pretty sure they hot fixed the lunchboxes they max out at 100 percent. Since they didn't want peoppe exploiting the score system
---
It is a great example of a well designed (and fun) pvp event.  I wish more people would show up to it.
---
That’s a massive bummer. 👎🏻👎🏻
---
Check the desks in the Military Wing of the Whitesprings Bunker. You will find Technical Data there 90% of the time, in my experience. And much of the time, you will find multiple, though you will have to make individual trips to pick them up and turn them in.
---
Tell me more about the mad scientist ;-)
---
Damn dude, maybe you should up your luck stat? 
---
Joking aside, that is some shitty RNG. Hope it only goes up from here
---
&gt; You say you enjoy exploring but won't explore because the enemies aren't fun to kill? 🤔
---
Yes, for me, exploring involves more than looking at new things. If I'm to feel like a postapocalyptic scavenger entering some ruins, there needs to be 1. a chance I might die 2. the hope of something novel/powerful/unique in there. At least that's the standard they've set for themselves with their other games. Level-scaling made dungeons a joy in FO4, &amp; level 1-50 dungeoneering in 76 feels similar. But after that? Want to go explore the mysterious Ash Heap? Enjoy one-shotting everything. 
---
Robs the world of any sense of danger. Hope the update can make exploring the world fun &amp; worth one's time. Maybe people'll clear a dungeon that isn't west tek.
---
Maybe he got tired crawling up there each time only to be thrown out by the next Vault Dweller a few seconds after the last
---
It’s fantastic for pvp, I don’t fuck with anyone I see wearing it, you are invisible in foliage or dark areas and with the right perks on you can be a tough bastard. Just look for the perks that say ‘no power armor’ it’s all I’d use if my SS wasn’t crucial to my carry weight.
---
TIL
---
Yeah it took me almost 80 to craft both legs unyielding. But none of them have weapon weight reduction. It only took two rolls for the chest and arms to be unyielding. But again no weapon weight reduction. Only other thing that I got first time was bloodied 2 star guass shotgun everything else the amount of script I used and got nothing good is so sad. I don’t even bother buying modules anymore
---
Ahhh okay. So play Encryptid, learn the plans, then I actually have a chance for them to drop.
---
Doesn't Encryptid takes a lot of teamwork/coordination? I'll probably have to wait til I'm playing with my brother &amp; his friend for that because I don't have a mic right now &amp; I'd rather not mess the event up for anyone else by being unable to communicate.
---
Naaa, that's 10 pound of useless crap to carry around. CSA works way better for a sneak and weights only 5.
---
IKR. Im about to throw in the towel and give up.
---
Pretty sure splitter is the go too since it's just more projectiles. But get ready for crazy recoil, and a gun that breaks *even faster*
---
Yeah....... One of my Exes.
---
Yeah I know how to find them. I’m saying after this last time I did the quest I haven’t found them any where. I used to find loads on enemies and everywhere I find none now. Nothing at all
---
For the right leg my husband and I have crafted in total between us close to a hundred. Both of us have gotten 2 or 3 one star unyieldings. Never a 2 or 3 star. Would you equip a one star unyielding SS if you have a 3 star piece with helpful rolls? I stick to the non SS piece. Need that WWR.
---
That'd make sense honestly. Also explains why he was in the cabinet trying to hide.
---
If I get a chance I'll try to do it.  What I do for max XP is hopefully solo, stand in the middle on those blue boxes with a lever and just vats one shot everything.  Never skip a beat and it's constant killing.  I know it's good xp, I'll sit on a private server for awhile and see if it pops up.
---
It's one of the hardest events. You can probably buy the plan from a trader for around 10k. Usually the sell point for the plan
---
I like commando more than rifleman: here is one of the builds I use: 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c463df&amp;w=sf2p02pg2ph2pi2ee2cu2c71ir2ar2an2ao0a04a30lr2l71lt2lu2lv2lk0
---
Note that Uny. armor will work best with this, especially with at least two pieces with AP refresh.
---
I tried going to commando but went back to rifleman. Didn't feel like kills were any faster and I went through an insane amount of ammo using automatic
---
Yeah I also worry about them breaking the game
---
You forget, it was one guy out of how many that did this? It isnt that it was a bad idea, its that you should be ready to take all as soon as a person you dont want to have anything goes for it. I posted a message on my camp wall that people can message me if needed for anything i dont have. Not quite the same, but I guarantee I wont have the same issue.
---
Take a break and stockpile. Worked for me when I was crafting solar armor, use what you got and just enjoy the game. Then come back and kick RNG Jesus's ass
---
Psn: Hyponerdic
---
True, You can always hop servers to get rid of the mask to. I don’t know take it or leave it. It’s my favorite event personally. I think the fact that I walked out of there with nine legendary’s one time keeps me going back
---
If I have a really nice weapon the last thing I want to do is risk getting brain matter all over it by bashing some super mutants thick head in.
---
WTF? I am hungry and thirsty all the time, never had this happen to me, and yes I use the mutation.
---
Your bandwith isn't related to disconnection problems, you could have a 16k line with more stable internet than somebody with fibre.
---
Flat 10% Spawn Rate.
---
Of course, if you kill it, it won't spawn again in that nuke zone, for that session.
---
(goes to log into NW)
---
(game freezes/crashes)
---
"damn synths"
---
Now THAT’S an amazing CAMP!
---
Excellent!  Thanks for the advice on the nukes and for the maps.  I didn’t know those existed and can foresee them being extremely helpful.
---
I go there when I need wood due to that huge pile and a couple of small piles around town.
---
8 player weekly lock content would be a great addition to this game basically raid zoned public events  
---
like nuke zone but in it own instanced.. 
---
This would be a great and fun like in other mmorpg but they need to rework there gear system and turn it into a tier type of system to support that type of game play
---
Do you have the new vault tec camp skin on your camp module? I’ve read it causes this to happen.
---
Well take for instance with the Wastelanders update, you can craft Secret Service armor and the new weapons with the use of legendary modules from the Purveyor. Crafting them is better than hoping they will drop rather than a different piece of armor that could drop from a legendary enemy. With that, it means that your armor can be crafted better and more durable. INT also affects how often your guns break with the use of Gunsmith and how much damage your explosives can do. It mainly deals with crafting and building, but Stabilized is a great perk for heavy gunners. Nerd Rage is also a fantastic perk under INT. Never scoff at the INT and just think it's for crafting, it affects a lot more than you could think.
---
Am not sure but I’ve heard about 10% chance per nuke.  You will see him again.
---
I grinded very hard on this double XP weekend with all the INT/XP boosts and lunchboxes.
---
I started at level 375 and finished at level 543 ... so 168 levelups on the weekend.
---
I stopped there as I also hit SCORE rank 100.
---
I'm having trouble confirming but I think this works for cap stashes as well. They seem to refill at the same rate as normal containers some times. Occasionally they will stay empty or just flat out disappear (even if I dont server hop), but occasionally I'll have them refill 2 or 3 times in a day on the same server. 
---
I'm on X Box. The loop ive done (where I picked up EVERYTHING I saw) and repeated was to hit Morgantown,  White Springs, West Tek, Sugar Grove, Tanagra Town, The Flooded Trainyard and then Summersville to hit the house with all the books. 
---
While doing that loop I would also hit up whatever random events were going on as well so I was probably exploring more than 250 containers on their own before you factored in the tens of hundreds of random bits of crap I'm prone to grab so that may skew my results.
---
FO1st may be a god damned money suck but it gives my inner hoarder a healthy outlet.
---
Are you going bloodied or junkies? Do you want mutations aswell?
---
By this point I would be excited to even get a 1 star piece lol
---
It's enough to make a grown man cry.
---
Only reason I mention it, my first experience their PVP wise, I didn’t know all the rules. I had been before with my brother but no one ever grabbed the mask... Flash forward a few weeks and I’m there for my legendary‘s. Some 300+ shows up I waved and he waved back. I waved him over to a three star, he killed me. You don’t have to pick up the mask for it to be PVP. If you’re there it’s PVP I’m pretty sure, whether you have pacify on or not
---
I DOOOOO HAVE IT.!
---
They closed it down for now. Maybe they might bring it back later but a better and fix version. If you are interested in the armor from vault raid. You can get it from vault 79 for gold bullion.
---
Yeah I do have that on.!
---
Should have been self explanatory for people but then again the averaged comprehensive score in the us is lower than 32 percent
---
Make a new character, play a round, delete said character. Repeat as necessary.
---
Gunsmith also is broken and White Knight (??) Maybe.  For sure gunsmith and one other "degrade slower" perk got messed up with the last patch.  Just fyi.  
---
They are trying to fix it though.  Good perks when they work.
---
Sorry we lack the tools to upvote your post.
---
But don’t worry we have passed your issues on to the development team who will ignore you and just fix a lightbulb graphic instead of the game breaking fast travel bug!
---
If you have any further questions please let us know and we will flat out ignore them too!
---
Sighhhh. I have like 3k &amp; had been saving up for those neon letters lol
---
But earning something is much better then getting it by a cheat. It lost ist value...
---
Other weapons don't have the effect The Fixer does. This post is ABOUT being original by skinning your gun how you want
---
I recently joined up with a group of 190+ they helped me out a lot, the lady made me a full set of Excavator armor as I haven't done that quest yet. Helped me make a ton of ammo and helped me clear out some of the hard quests in Watoga, thank you so much SpazHandle.
---
Shit happened to me too. I'm a 200 now but when I was 190s I had a group of 40-60 try starting shit with me while I soloed that one loud night event. Didn't take to shooting them but one tried adding me into a group which I stupidly did. He engaged and I got opened to pvp. Got downed took their whole team. But what they fail to see was I just hit revenge and mowed them all down took my stuff and theirs. They got on com's and said I was a cheater.
---
I don’t think I’ve repaired my power armor in about a month. And with repair kits from the queen it’s pretty simple
---
I logged on and saw the Morgan airport cargo drop event and saw 2 level 10s doing it.  I joined as the last wave was coming in.  Killed 2-3 scorched.  I go down to loot the drop box......so I can in turn drop the shit for these guys....and I get thumbs down and messaged that I didn’t do anything and coat tailed on their event?  Lol.  THEN.....they start shooting me as I’m trying to drop the god damn supply request, water, and 3 hammers ......WTF?  Was it wrong that I killed them?
---
Thing is there aren't really 'hotfixes' in the traditional way with Bethesda, the few times they tried fixing something quick they messed up and all their other 'fixes' take weeks/months to arrive
---
Has that changed recently then? Because I've definitely had it twice before but that wasn't in a while.
---
Wow, that's amazing!
---
It’s like the worst buzz kill though, reading left to right. You see Unyielding.  FINALLY F-CK YEA! Then a quarter of a second later. Deflation. Oh. One star.
---
Ah ok. I don't know anything about the Secret Service armor or how the legendary modules work. That helps, thank you!
---
What MojaveBreeze and EDAboii said; the storyline is instanced, so from a narrative perspective, our player character (mine or yours) likely has a half or even full haul from the Vault. That would make them wealthier than either settlement is as a whole, as an individual.
---
I highly suggest Allegheny Asylum. Takes a bit to loot the whole place, but you get some of everything, and there’s a good amount of ballistic fiber, and some other less common materials, especially aluminum, because of all the tv and medical trays.
---
You destroyed a wild pack of Bushwookies in their natural habitat? How could you!
---
Thank god, I heard it was 5%, 10% is a lot more manageable believe it or not.
---
Try taking it off. Hope it helps.
---
I sent it I’ll be on fallout in like 30mins-1hr
---
Yeah sad part is I'm not sure if it was killed or not.
---
It may have changed with the recent patch, but I believe the notes have always said that once it spawns, it won't spawn again in that nuke zone.
---
Though, it's BGS - take it with a grain of salt.
---
Literally it will break after about 10 magazines or batteries whatever you wanna say. Your gonna need a load of weapon repair kits.
---
My experience is that 99.9999% of people just wanna say hi. You might get that one dude out of 1,000 who has no life and likes messing with new people. Don’t sweat it. I’m sure someone will come along and make your day better lol
---
I would bet in the lifespan of 76 we'll probably see the whole catalogue of Fo4 (and maybe the other Fallouts) circling around the Atomshop some day as those objects are easy money for Bethesda.
---
What your suggesting is a complete redesign of the area not the levels of the enemies. 
---
Places with level 3 enemies aren't challenging type of creatures (mole rats, ticks etc) I understand it's not difficult but that shouldn't take away the exploring experience, at least not for me.
---
When I’m at scrip limit I find a low level player whether at their camp or just walking around and I drop every weapon I have that I was going to scrip and all the plans I have in my inventory then I do the gift emote and walk into the night
---
Just make a new character and rank them up.
---
It isn't plainly evident to me and the majority of my friends over level 200. Please educate us.
---
Got it &amp; accepted! Thanks!
---
Ohhhh, I was like wtf. Anyways, good to know!
---
Most of it is trading for them tbh. Mine cost me 70k ammo. Back before the market got ruined by mass duping
---
Wait do you really have friends who decipher the silo pieces puzzle every time they launch a nuke?
---
Makes sense honestly, by this game's standards. Like, why wouldn't it break your camp?
---
&gt;Yeah, it used to work like that. Unyielding and Magnetic Personality all worked to grant you additional ability to share perks, but Bethesda nerfed it. Just launched the game to double check, magnetic personality does not allow you to share extra perk cards.
---
Mine's all over the place. If I go into VATS one time, every headshot I hit might be for 100hp. If I come out of VATS and go back in immediately, neither I nor SBQ having moved, I'll be hitting for 500hp per headshot. Repeat, and it's at 300hp per headshot. Some of the multipliers aren't processing every time, and it's different ones from one VATS "session" to the next.
---
I got lucky and got a chest first go and haven't bothered rolling any more, I can't justify the effort for the return i can't see much point pushing my DR any further, with the right perks and a few decent vendor bargain pretty much anything is viable including wood.
---
Plus it looks ridiculous...
---
When you craft the skin for the armor, there will be 2 types for the helmet. Normal one and one that says “silent mode” which is the one that doesn’t speak :)
---
Bought it, crafted it, used it, scraped it...
---
Cool, it would make sense if it was the new patch, I haven't actively tried to spawn it myself or looked for it really for a while, but yeah before that I nuked the double spot up fron huntersville near the monorail and cycled it twice in like 45 minutes, 
---
I guess when they changed the spawn chance they changed that too potentially.

Realistically there are really no if-and-buts. Not only does only the party leaders instance progress if you team up; Vault 79 only has one door to blow off it's hinges and Penny is only in contact with one Motherlode. But the idea of them putting the Vault door back/rebuilding that one room, and getting trapped again, is a pretty funny idea.
---
This guy gets it
---
People are making masterpieces like this, and here I am with a plain brick building. Also, that’s a really nice view.
---
Hopefully we can see them after BOS returns😎
---
"literally everyone is telling me I'm wrong about something but I'm going to refuse to acknowledge or even think about it."

Read the goddamned room, guy.

* Sun Kissed 2* sharing intensifies!*
---
Play a different character. Problem solved.
---
Definitely Sugar Grove you can get 20+ screws in one go
---
InnovSurvivalist has the added bonus of a sexy accent.
---
I would add that there will be more days like this.  If you haven’t killed yourself 1000 times, walked backwards into a fissure, or destroyed your favorite weapons, you haven’t yet lived.  Cringe, be disappointed, then just laugh it off.
---
Oh yeah but even if i gave him a goal, he really is what made this game so fun for me, i couldn’t imagine a fo76 start without him would have been very different
---
Yeah, how hard is it to use something at least once after making it before putting it public?
---
I like to believe that all 100+ citizens of Vault 76 are crammed together doing it all as a team 😂
---
Well if your using lunchboxes to go too 100% buff that's your problem its bugged so if it says 100% your actually geting 0% but with the 75% for lunch boxes 20% from squirrel stew ( with mutation) 5% from sleep 50% from intelligents (hard caps at 25 anything over this gives no extra xp) I'm getting 4k exp from every sentrybot 1.5k form sm 1k from assultrons and like 800 from gouls
---
Server hop at west tek
---
Save yourself some time!
---
The Effect is useless if you are already running a bloodied build and have speed demon mutation. Speed Demon overrides any speed modifier and sneaking already has a softcap if you have high AGI. So better to pick a Handmade... at least it have better skins.
---
morgantown airport
---
This sounds fake and just plain weird. Where you one of those people that spent money on a premade account
---
Too many do gooders about for a boycott. You'd stop paying and the bootlickers would just double down.
---
No mutation and just anything with big damage my current weapon has a damage stat of 221 and does 400 damage
---
Paige has to demote ward too just simple settler tasks( hammering wall panels, sitting on benches, and sleeping).
---
most of the time it's not them setting it though. It's xbox live being a clownshoe.
---
No. I bought weapons. How does it sound fake and weird?
---
50 screws lost to a fissure one time, I'm shocked I'm not as upset as I was that day. But at least putting it into perspective makes me feel better.
---
Not to mention I can take out my anger in the wendigo event that is coming up.
---
The system doesn't work that well. And as far as i know/remember bughesda is planning some rework on it. But the way it is supposed to work right now is that the first person to enter an area will scale mobs to his/her level. Some areas have fixed levels. Like starting areas. Don't know if the scaling lasts until mobs are killed or if there is some timer on them until they are scalable again. Also, one of the issues with the system is that if you log out on.. Lets say West Tek Research as a high level player. When you log back in, there is an period where you appear as lv1 character upon entering the new server. That will always scale enemies in the area you enter to scale lowest level possible. So to make this work properly and keep your favourite farming spot high level, always log out on safe place like your camp.
---
Perfect thanks
---
You’re high level, have a perfect endgame weapon, and a perfect legendary, and you don’t know where to go to farm enemies?
---
West Tek, Watoga (kill robots), or park outside a fissure and hunt scorched beasts.
---
With a b2525 fixer? Surely not.
---
Oh sweet, thanks. I had been expecting to find it under audio settings but never saw it there. Also I haven't used power armor in so long I didn't think to try it out. Thanks again for the info!
---
+karma
---
I like going giving you low levels thousands of the different Ultracite rounds to you so you can sell or use. I usually also give lots of junk you help you guys out.
---
Morgantown airport is mediocre at best when it's nuked
---
I have a B2525 Handmade as well, but I still don't like the fact my Fixer can't be skinned and taken off my vendor list.
---
Yea at. I point did I expect it to work on a different, unique gun
---
shhhhh
---
Early on you might find running a couple of pieces of bolstering helpful and regardless of your weapon type don't forget blocker nerd rage and serendipity as a minimum for damage mitigation. Also radicool is a handy way to negate a few weight reduction cards as +5 str is very handy.
---
If you spec into sneak and make sure you're weapon is suppressed commando will out dps rifleman any day of the week you just need a little trigger discipline to conserve bullets.
---
Do you have your mutations all sorted out? I'm on PS4 if you need anything.
---
Edit: forgot to mention 3 ranks of fireproof or 2 ranks and a dense chest mod will pretty much completely negate explosion damage and scorch beast smelly rad breath attacks.
---
What weapon are you using to solo it? Just curious.
---
I've been launching a fair number of nukes recently and it is getting tedious to have a dozen players or more perched on tents, fences and the bunker spaying fireworks at her. She takes ages to land obviously, would quite like to succeed in soloing the queen fight.
---
My current build is bloodied commando.
---
With my experiences the target is dead half the time before I even get there.
---
&gt; What your suggesting is a complete redesign of the area not the levels of the enemies.
---
Nah, if everything was level 62-68 for me, I'd have covered the whole map. Instanced/level-scaled enemies &amp; loot is an incredibly basic aspect of online games. I hope they implement it well.
---
Lots of people do this, but what is do is setup my camp right outside 76 and whenever I find a low tier weapon I mod the f*ck out of it and leave it in my vendor for free. I’ll put one and two star legendaries in there too, (3* gets scripped).
---
I bought the weapons for caps
---
I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals.
---
Haha yeah man it’s all good! Now you can enjoy Liberty Prime with strong silence :) 
---
Thanks for the karma!
---
This. It looks to me they simply put the ‘gilded minigun’ skin in the atom shop, and yes very low res and pixelated, horrible to look at in first person view. My worst purchase in the atom shop, together with the bugged gold HM skin.
---
Its just weird, some people never get weapons of that caliber until theyre level 500+ and by that point known very well how to grind xp
---
The thing is, aren't alot of mobs resistant to radiation damage, especially glowing mobs?
---
Nope Bethesda doesn't care about NW, it's been some time since the last patch for NW. Could be because of their 'new' orientation towards more PvE-focues content which doesn't really bother me as I don't play NW.
---
What’s special about the Gammu gun?
---
Most people are high levels cause they grind alot and they kinda learn for a feel of the map where large amounts of exp are. Your post screams a hey I'm fresh off eBay how do I play game
---
With the dupe and ban waves people are actually selling weapons like that for cheap in panic
---
When there’s a dupe you can buy anything for caps
---
;)
---
Oh ffs we really do live in a society don’t we?
---
Yes, something like that. But that might be Hard too since there are basically no flat surfaces
---
I support this. I don't think it'd be as bad if teammates would die instantly like solo players do.
---
OK, I'll go read about it, I've never read the data min stuff, just presuming everything I'd heard about the queen was correct. I've not been paying attention.
---
I doubt Bethesda will read my comment and change the game, so no harm no foul.
---
Right, forgot about that
---
Everyone has them now they are not even worth a nikcel
---
Definitely not duped.
---
Silly question, I guess, but isn't the greatest benefit in the Bloodied build found in unyielding armor? How does per armor compensate for the lack of increased special?
---
Awww is someone mad it takes a full mag to kill 1 super mutant
---
Bug that's been there forever, the only way to get it back is to move.  You don't need to go into build mode, but if you ever want to repair all your broken items at one you'll need to move to get it back.
---
Actually, I'm still not gonna wear it (I wear a full set of unyielding ap refresh combat armor) but I'd been thinking about it because I have Shadow Prime and noticed it in the Atomic Shop. My brain works funky.
---
I'd be down to see a 26 v 26 capture the flag. Same rules - you die, you're out
---
oh wait I'm stupid lol I meant that its third party launcher issue (so MGP and steam)
---
The forest outside of vault 76.
---
No way, it looks horrible, if they stated that it looks as intended, then they need to get their eyes checked. The textures also got downgraded with the Wastelanders and are now lower resolution or are more compressed so they often look really bad too.
---
OK, I had no idea, not interested in PA so have never bothered reading about it. I'll look more favourably on these players in future. Thanks!
---
Don't feel bad, we have fun helping you guys out and have more than enough stuff. we want you to keep your materials cause you need them more than us. At least part of my day every day the past couple weeks has been spent building armor and weapons for the gamepass newbies, chatting with them and helping them figure stuff out, dropping goodies at the overseer's camp etc. It's a blast! So don't feel bad, we're having fun doing it, that's our payment.
---
You ever tried to shoot an actual gun underwater?
---
Lmaooooooo I feel you. I use my PA with the voice thing and I honestly love it. People complain but meeeh :) it just sounds so badass! 
---
Damn yeah you really don’t need the power armor with that set that you are running xD
---
The bunkers on the east side of the map too there's a little of everything in those.
---
Yea kill kill kill
---
It average for me 20k exp per event
---
Edit: this topic has been hot on the subreddit lately so yesterday I did get 4/4 on the reward and it totally not worth it lol I think the event exp were 2.6k exp..
---
Does this change her dialog lines?
---
No. I think The plan is next patch. But nobody knows for sure
---
What I was trying to say was have you selected the skin that you want for your tent in the atomic shop? You have to select it like you would an icon.  Then when you place your tent.... Itll be the one you want.
---
Oh ok thank you was just about too launch you saved me
---
Gamma gun. Most people do not have the type of armor/perk cards whatever that protect you from the gamma gun. It's got a tiny magazine though so most people don't use the gamma gun
---
Unbelievable.  
---
found this for FO4, seems a very simple fix (if we had access to the texture format for FO76), and some material files compared to others have incorrect values making for excessive gloss.  
---

---
Did you put the future-tec skin on the module? It’s bugged...You no longer appear on the map to anyone or yourself. Even to fast travel to? Not sure if that’s what you’re talking about or if you just lost the module and can’t find it.
---
You can max reputation with both, you can only do the Vault quest with one.
---
Bloodied unarmed is one of the most powerful in the game
---
sorry man, there is no way i believe that, i haven t met a single person who doesn t go to nukacrypt to get the silo codes and i play since day 1. But sure i would love if you could explain me how to decipher the code.
---
i m still trying to be constructive but it s abit hard when you only got that as argument. 
---
now i understand if bethesda ban when someone exploit the season because there is atoms as reward which can be bought with real money so you are basically stealing.
---
when it comes to dupes, i don t see what they are losing there. At the end of the day, there will just be more players with good weapons, so what? i prefer by far seeing everyone with legacies and fixers fighting the queen than someone with a magic weapon who destroy the queen in 1.5 second. 
---
btw, i keep responding because it gets more interesting when people don t agree with you, you can get more point of views than if everyone agrees
---
No. Just turn on pacifist mode to stop accidentally hitting ppl
---
Yup, doesnt go far but this is a video game not real life, you really think someone can lugg around a 50 cal?
---
Yeah and even if they do appear in game and able to be joined I always get world full you are queued to join so there's really no point in calling out the Queen's
---
Okay, personally I don't find wasting an entire magazine into a bloatfly that appealing.
---
I'm sure we both can agree end game content will be much welcomed....
---
Even though you have no interest in exploring the low level areas, I would advise you to anyways, it's nice and although not dangerous it still has a very immersive feel :)
---
Go to options and turn on pacifist, foody
---
I always go to Fort Defiance for this. The 3rd and 4th floors each have a locked terminal near the elevator.
---
What type of weapons are unarmed?
---
For the "space coffin" I would assume that the civilizations before the Great War also had a good bunch of satelites (and maybe other space stations) in orbit which the Kovac Muldoon could salvage for materials if it is equipped with salvaging machinery
---
I would’ve loved to of seen the clip. I was actually talking about that post last night with my brother and my niece. We got into match last night my brother just could not find a weapon besides a machete, he took out a guy in PA with a machete. The guy in PA had run out of ammo and he was trying to punch him to death. NW, The place even crazier shit happens. Should be a slogan
---
It does radiation damage. If someone's a bloodied build it doesn't take much to max out their bar.
---
Do you also hate sand?
---
They are a rare drop. Every hide I find, I sell for 2.5k and they move.
---
Explosives are a waste of time.
---
I didn't know garlic was a viable weapon in this game... Must help against Vampires weapons?
---
It did thanks bro.!!!!!!
---
I spent nearly 20 minutes scrolling through 14k 5.56 in order to drop about 500 rounds for a newbie I'd crafted a handmade for. What a pain in the ass, let me punch in the number on a keypad like the keypad doors, dammit.
---
Even for crowd control/attempting to cripple? Damn shame if so...
---
That’s NW, is NW as appealing to the actual PvP fan base as the old original survival?
---
If dogmeat could carry a fatman anything is possible.
---
I have so many pa skins but I can't remember the last time I wore any except when I have fast traveled into a mountain or a wall or under a foundation so I can try and get in it so I don't have to re-fast travel because of course stuff like that happens in fo76. Otherwise I just wear Chinese Stealth armor in irradiated areas.
---
Power Armor is like what you wear through elementary, middle, and high school, actually good armor is what grownups wear.
---
Crafted 10 torsos. 9 pieces of scrip and 1 unyielding, ap refresh and  ammo weight reduction. Problem is I'm a full health build so I might as well scrip it, can't bring myself to do it though.
---
I don't even see the point of this. You can melt someone so fast with a hacked 50 cal. It's basically laser tag, wiping out a group, no problem. With a minigun cryolator you can knock people out from one hell of a distance just the same
---
Hiding, duh!
---
Meat hook, deathclaw gauntlet, power fist, knuckles, moleminer gauntlet. Might have missed a few. You can not use them in power armor
---
For a rifleman or commando yea, you’d need the agility and perception doesn’t really effect you has a heavy gunner
---
sadly that only works on consoles as PC still has no messaging options natively
---
Hope so! They can fund bugfixing of the very thing they exploited and got wiped for by buying alllllll their Atom Store cosmetics for a second time 😂
---
(Awww I offended the dupers.. Anything but downvotes! *That's my one weakness!* 😱  
---
Maybe see if you can duplicate yourself some backbone, you pathetic bunch of jellyfish..)
---
I just started playing a few days ago and I have to say the player base has been awesome. I've come across many generous high level players that have given goods to help me get started. So far I've only come across one troll (I'm sure theres more lol) who kept trying to jump in front of our shots, but the good experiences I've had heavily outweigh the bad.
---
I've  traded for some good gear but all the hours I server hopped while the  mass reproduction of god tier weapons was going on nobody was selling them for caps
---
Never had that happen. Try restarting the game?
---
First sentence of number 3... doing it with 3-4 people is a solid number, anything above that is too much IMO
---
I favor power armor, but after playing 76 i was disappointed with it. I still use it, but one of the things i can't take are Acid attacks. Mirelurk king, queen or anything else that spits acid and boy watch my health go down. The reason for this is how power armor has no poison resistance, while some armor pieces can have poison resistance due to legendary effects. 
---
Another thing that's different is no power armor actually has legendary effects, you could say Strangler heart is legendary but in reality it isn't. It spits some acid but in all honesty it rarely helps in attacks, especially now that it's nerfed. Before Wastelanders you could take down a SBQ solo when wearing it. The amount of damage it did could crash a server. So yeah, when doing Queens i tend to run around a lot as for one i can tank bullets and melee but tanking those acid attacks is pretty much impossible. A mirelurk queen can reach you anywhere but a king or cave cricket can't unless the king uses sonic attacks.
---
Sorry, maybe I should have clarified. I’m pretty certain on how I’m going to set up armor and perks. I’m basically just wondering about weapon type in order to maximize damage in that regard
---
Yeah, the terminal next to the three door entrance at Poseidon seems to be always locked too as I just was told.
---
You sound like a petulant child.
---
I have 2 decent b combat rifles cant wait to unlock that
---
I didnt even think of that. Im on xb1 and forget they didnt do anything for pc users. Hopefully you get better players in your world and thats all you can hope for. +1
---
Am on PS4, I find them in nearly every deathclaw I kill. Wasn't aware nor have ever heard of them being rare.
---
Reccomend* sorry, I had to.
---
The biggest negative for the weapon IMHO is how hard it seems to be to learn it's mods by scrapping. An increase in DPS would also be needed to make it competitive as most wasteland opponents are immune to radiation damage.
---
The perk cards is called iron fist
---
They’re in the latest pts files. Atom shop unfortunately.
---
Oh your one of those commander players
---
Good for exp farming 
---
With a solid team of 4 each person take 2 workshop And hop between defense workshop events and public events it is nonstop exping
---
It also good for farming Materials , I afk farm 100 fusion core last Wednesday for this weekend event (overkill I’m still at 80+) while watching tv and checking up on the game every 20min
---
Edit: the disadvantage is the workshop are t saved when you log off , there has been talk about them being consistently build like our camp so we don’t have to build each time we log on
---
They're okay for that but they really need some improvement all round. They don't do nearly enough damage for what they are yet the durability of explosive weapons is terrible. I made an explosives toon just for science and can only say they really need an overhaul. Commando on its own is way stronger.
---
Fallout 76 starting to turn into Call of Duty '76 edition! lol
---
Right? Still getting mine done in minutes
---
The games still realistic within its universe. Just cause theres lasers that are explained doesn't mean gunpowder doesn't get wet unexplainably
---
Mobile auto correct is terrible
---
High level yet you don't know where to farm XP?
---
Darn it thank you, will I lose all my stuff if I move it to where it was before?
---
This particular skin is acting up, other camp skins work fine, I have the settler skin C.A.M.P. device and everything works fine, didn't need to redeploy camp
---
Private worlds, worth every penny. Hope to see you back sometime in the future. :)
---
No I don't have any skins for it.  Yes I lost the module and I cannot find it anymore to repair all my structures and stuff
---
What are they used for? I just scrap them I think
---
Thanks everyone. For some reason I thought he reset on Sun at noon which could have been the problem. In any case, I did talk to Duchess first so I don't know if that's what did it but he finally sold me some gold!
---
I have had 2 sessions 10 modules each at the dame workbench and been lucky unyielding 2 for 2.its in the mountains near westeck. I know rng but I'll keep going there
---
Nice
---
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough irritating and it gets everywhere.
---
Fantastic job!!!!
---
Still love the way you can get a disease from being shot by an infected ghoul.... cos bullets will definitely cary a bug!
---
I crafter a total of 140 chests trying for a good chameleon piece.  My current one is urban scout chameleon / powered / sneak.  Got a couple chameleon pieces, everything was lockpick or breathe underwater. None powered, none with sneak. Instead I got a unyielding / powered / Cavalier chest which since I'm not a bloody build I ended up scripting.
---
I gave up on Secret Service armor. My regular set is too good and there's pretty much a zero chance I'll ever be able to get the same roles. If they eventually make it tradable and that's another story but as it's sits it's just not worth it.
---
Hahaha I can relate to literally everything here 😂 true man I only use my main when fighting the SBQ on my main to get some protection while the 738262 ghouls hit me from all sides haha. But other than that, meh I just go all in with my normal armor. Tanky enough without the power armor so yeah. And I stealth with my alt with my stealth armor too :)
---
I know this all to well.
---
I made a bloodied explosive build specifically for crowd control, aiming to cripple, since I always play with a team. Biggest waste of time. It's just not viable 90% of the time and you end up crippling/ killing yourself a lot of the time.
---
I'm not one of the downvoters, but I can see their point of view: these posts get a 'nice' reply from Bethesda employees, while the million posts about NW hackers have been completely ignored.
---
Their unicorn?
---
I found someone selling Scorched Ashes for 50 caps and was so excited since they were removed from world spawns until I found out they can't be displayed. Now I just have them being shown off in my hidden vendor for 30,000 caps along with the 1 cap items for people who explore.
---
I did this the other day but I'm just 178.  I dumped a TON of 308 10 and 44 ammo and like 2 dozen cores.   You will do ot when you are high level too.  Its just what you do.
---
[https://imgur.com/V4qTnlL](https://imgur.com/V4qTnlL)
---
Don't be the person that goes full hardon to kill a legendary when there are other people around.  Share the kill.  Also, visit everyone's vendor camps a lot.  Like most players, I drop a ton of ammo and items I have zero use for on the floor of my camp for any visitors to take.
---
It’s only PC isn’t it? Not aware of any console mods that can be used?
---
Lol when I was like a level 5 I was still figuring things out I decided to get sued to the controls by Vault 76. I didn’t realize it was such a common place for people to stop by, and this level 100+ buy waves to me, crouched down and left me 30 stimpaks. It was so appreciated.
---
There is one at Mama Dolce, in the base floor office.
---
Patch 21, august 4th i believe
---
Haha I know it’s becoming one of my greatest regrets, man I can only imagine the frantic desperation from that power armour guy. The already crazy 76ers go even crazier on NW, I had a team mate presumably forget he didn’t have bird bones and jump straight off of a cliff and die earlier I nearly fucking cried.
---
Got my hands on a bloodied gauss mini today, after about 20 or so attempts. 
---
That isn't the worst, but still took a bit considering the scrip required. It's also still not perfect as it only dropped as 2 star, but honestly I give up for now :D
---
I also actually got it using the 250 scrip reward from a legendary run square, so even better.
---
Did Uranium Fever the other day around level 23 with two level 130+ and they both made sure I got shots in on the legendaries. Then came to my camp, bought out my vendor, and dropped it with extra loot! Helped a bunch to kill the assaultron in vtu
---
Check the dead death claws on the edge fissure site prime. That's where I got all of mine. Had to hop to get them all, and this was like a year ago so I'm not sure if it's still possible to still get them this way. Hope this helps, and lemmie know if so so I can confirm for others plz
---
LMAO
---
"Uh, are you here to rescue us or to take all the gold?"
---
"Yes."
---
I laughed way to hard at this
---
TSE was 200% Extra Damage for nothing, Junkies and Bloodied atleast have drawbacks.
---
Alright, gotcha!
---
Why? The graphics are way better and you have access to all the Hacked weapons
---
beautiful
---
There is a muted head mod for it... but the chest still talks...
---
Explosives pair well with Heavies IMO, but I'm biased since my main has been a HW/Explosives build since launch.  
---
Bear Arms and Ordinace Express means I can carry a metric crapton of guns  
---
 and explosives and still have room for full damage perks for HW AND explosives (minus the HW reload speed perk, anyway. Not very useful on my main HW due to their massive mag capacities; might be useful with explosive launchers). Also Commando builds generally leverage stealth; explosives don't benefit from stealth. A HW/Explo build works great with Power Armor since you aren't going to be stealthy anyway, and you get those PA benefits.
---
And a bloodied HW/explo build in PA with EP is very tanky (except for poison damnit &gt;.&lt;) and does a shitton of damage even without stealth. My B25 autogrenade launcher does like 800 damage to every target it hits. You know that glitch where FO1st tents make all the scorched spawn in the middle in Line in the Sand? Yeah, I can totally be a dick and instagib all of them the second they spawn, no legacy weapons required. Only problem is that it breaks super fast since Bugthesda in all their wisdom counts each hit as weapon degredation, so hitting 20 targets with 1 grenade counts as 20 weapon damage :P
---
Worth!
---
Go on top of the Red Rocket in Flatwoods.
---
Same. I didn’t think they had any great worth.
---
outdated mods on PC?
---
The harpoon gun at least. And only.
---
If tour on xbox im gonna find them and buy them
---
Sure thing! Yeah the new Gauss weapons and the Secret Service armor can all be rolled when you craft them with use of Legendary Modules, bought through the Purveyor. I made my armor a few weeks ago and haven't had them break yet, because when I made them I had like 25 INT I think.
---
I've got a stash of like 8 that I keep forgetting to toss in my vendor... (PC)
---
I have done this solo many times, but I follow the speakers advice and 'meditate'.  I go into stealth and wait.  No ghouls spawn and it is an easy complete.
---
I have noticed that when others are there, sprinting around in power armor and shooting explosive weapons a lot of ghouls spawn, but I just assumed they were doing it 'wrong'.  
---
Can you give some tips in how you are attracting enough ghouls to go up three levels in 5 minutes?
---
Oh well I still got the plans from other people so now I have 2 sets lol
---
Yeah until your like me and run out of repair kits.
---
There in aquirable treasure you know like the gone in 60 seconds movie
---
The traps are registered as something that can damage a creature, npc, or the player. They didn’t make the power armor to be “immune” to realistic damage. Like stepping on a trap.
---
Sadly this is an ongoing bug that many have reported
---
My uncle who works at Nintendo can.
---
Lowkey probably getting down voted by Bethesda employees.
---
Where do I register? 🤗
---
I only found 1 and just in my last game. Under a table on the golf course southwest of Bolton Greens. No idea if that's a guaranteed spawn or not. They do make a noise when you're within 15-20 feet so that helps, otherwise I'd have never noticed it.
---
I’ll add one more: Armor. 
---
Favorite your Chinese stealth armor, and you can switch to it in one press. Not so much in your armor, but it’s useful for surviving a fall or a quick swap.
---
Oh I see how that happens. I'm melee so I don't use mine as much
---
Which is ALWAYS, during this battle. Would sneak be useless?
---
I’m not a duper, nor have I ever been banned in a game before. But I did downvote you. One, just for seeming like an all around asshat, and two, because having items deleted from your inventory if they’re from the atomic shop does literally nothing. They’d just have to craft the cosmetics again.
---
I actually have her in the Enclave Officer uniform and hat.  There is no way to clean off her filth, but I keep it covered up.  :)
---
Is that even possible!!  
---
How much int can we get per gear slot because all I see is 3 star legendary all have +1
---
I'm trying test if having a certain prefix for the gauss minigun in your inventory removes it from rng, so far after 3 days, rolling 2 per day, it works like a charm. But still no bloodied😕
---
So im coming back to the game and am level 71. I have had three people now be nice to me. One level 500+, one level 200+, and a level 131. All of whom have been super nice. Some made me armor that fit my build, others modified my weapons,  some just dropped tons of plans and ammo. This community has really changed since the last time I've logged in (over a year ago). There are still gonna be difficult people to deal with no matter where you go or no matter the game. But I just want to say thank you to very kind, generous, helpful person out there. Also I can't wait till im in a position to pay it forward.
---
And that's okay.
---
10x stimpacks, Rad away, purified water, dog food and 2k ammo w/e gun you’re using. Always happy to help. Please enjoy the game.
---
Without having to wait for junk to respawn in places like sugar grove is to farm the wendigos on the road south of abbies bunker. 
---
You can server hop and 1-3 wendigos spawn where there is a bus in the tree almost every time. Each one drops 5-7 screws.  Definitely the most efficient farming way.
---
The assaultron head method already described is good too 👍🏻
---
One of the Possum challenges, if I remember right.
---
Is it week 3?
---
Same thing happening to me.  Please let us know if u find a solution its really frustrating being 20 points away from a collector bot.  My atoms keep resetting to 480 when i go to buy it
---
Ya, standing between the main pipe and the top of the stairs let's you cover all 3 pipes...but you can't wait for the lower levels to tag, its too easy to lose a pipe. If they post in 1 of the areas, ill avoid shooting into that one if they are taking care of business, otherwise I'm firing as soon as an enemy presents. No time to waste on that event
---
Hmm I’m on pc...hmm I have caps too...hmmm
---
I’d find it weird shooting ballistic weapons underwater. Water is dense so bullets don’t travel very far. Strangely, you have to use a perk to take advantage of that if you’re being shot at from land while submerged.
---
It would be cool if the harpoon gun worked underwater though.
---
Can confirm there is nothing on the alpha deathclaws at fissure site prime
---
Not quite....that water fountain ONLY heals diseases while nuked.....
---
The new skin is bugged and causes this issue. Remove it and everything should be back to normal.
---
No, I'm not joking.
---
Oh thank you. Good to know
---
Something is off with atoms. I have a similar issue, since yesterday sometimes I see only couple hundred atoms in the main menu and I have to go into the shop to see the full amount.
---
I’m next to you im going to give you the option to pick any fixer I got on me
---
I think a few other ppl reported the same bug, its the future tec camp skin. Hopefully gets fixed soon.
---
Yep, especially when those damn ants and ticks you can’t see without Vats can drop a pipe to half health in seconds. While this person over here is running back and forth jumping up and down. Luckily you still get notes if you have 1 pipe remaining.
---
Oh I don’t plan On killing anything without help from a friend or other players other than that I’ll mostly play for fun
---
I miss your content 😔
---
Sounds like a you problem.
---
There's a bunch of stuff on the roofs of Morgantown too.
---
OMG I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY JUST COPIED THIS FROM THE LAST GAME1!111!!1!!
---
Had a teammate being a bish wookie as he was low health and close to death. A group was coming after him. I knew I hit the value I needed so I didnt need to stay in game. I ran through his bush to get their attention, they chased me down. I got one, but the other two killed me. 
---
He survived until at least i left the game. Just before exiting, i said "hope that helps you through"
---
They did away with it in f4 because the repair mechanic wasnt very clear for normies
---
Same way we still get poisoned or diseased through PA.
---
Shoddy coding.
---
For the sugarbombs?
---
Definitely invest on the perks that make fusion cores last longer. I can make a single core last for days, it's not uncommon for me to only be carrying 2 or 3 cores at a given time
---
Yeah I saw you -- I tried to offer a trade but it said it expired. Then I wasn't sure if you wanted me to follow you somewhere?
---
That's a solution to work around poor game design.
---
It wouldn’t let me trade the game is being buggy let’s see if it works now
---
Lol the fear mongering is real
---
I do use dilute stuff tho
---
I take it thats today, and why is it "find" instead of "Hack"?  Does it unlock just from "find"ing a locked terminal?
---
Ah ok. Just wondering how spikes can go through basically a walking tank. Thanks!
---
Wow that is nuts, wth Bethesda lol
---
Sadly no. I've been running the asylum multiple times a day in hopes of a red outfit/Yellow/Forrest to complete my collection, but no such luck. One day, my pretties, one day.
---
I carry a shishkebab for a backup weapon and friendly fire healing, but I use it in events like Uranium Fever, Path of Enlightenment, etc.  Otherwise I’ll be “that high lvl guy”.
---
Lol. How are they going to ban if u have duped items. That’s 95% of the server 😂😂😂
---
I know PA prevents airborne diseases but it doesn’t prevent creature diseases?
---
I mean it's not that hard to understand rlly.
---
Request any fixer and you can have it
---
Luck has nothing to do with it. I have a 15 in luck, boosted to 28 by unyielding. I also cannot get a 3. Star unyielding leg piece.
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
I'm on xbox one. As far as I know, I've got no mods as part of the game
---
As a new player, I assumed that high level players are only there for the xp or gold. In my experience, high levels only help if they see I'm struggling with it. Never thought anyone would be angry about someone 10x their level giving them a chance to actually do the event lol
---
I just unlocked it and at first I could not see the difference, but it's good to have a skin to block it from sale/scrip.
---
Go explain the perk jury rigging to a cod players then tell me that
---
TSE wasn't nerfed due to PVP
---
I'll let you know if its still an issue when I next go on
---
You should favourite everything g you don’t want to accidentally scrap because there’s  added  “do you want to scrap favourited item” prompt screen and it’s saved me a few times now
---
yeah we had them buffed nw ones spawn in on blood eagles but bethesda took them out didnt they.
---
The same thing happened to me. I probably wasted 150 modules getting both unyielding legs. And I wasn't even being picky about stars.
---
Man it is crazy that those are rare again they where common for so long between patch 11 and 17
---
nope. My PA main gets diseased regularly. Airborne/waterborne diseases are blocked though, true.
---
Not yet but i will.
---
Red Asylum Uniform. 120+ hours of looking now. Only found the yellow and forest in the last 10 hours or so.
---
I’ve done that once. Only once though
---
Ok the jury rigging perk took me a while to understand I'll admit that one
---
VATS UNKNOWN? what is it like at lvl 50? i cba to do the rest of Daguerre's fetch quests.
---
Its broken like adrenaline
---
No sneak is still good for the survivability
---
Care Package incoming !
---
Great...
---
No, I don't to be honest. I played it for the first time the other day. I saw the objective to connect ore, but I couldn't seem to find where you actually collect it from, and I was busy killing all these enemies that were spawning nonstop. We kept all the workers alive though.
---
Yeah now take into account they removed the whole repair mechanic from f4 to make the game more mainstream to get an actual AAA title out
---
I mean most diseases in this game are meh but still I have something that lore wise turned the tide of battle yet a little pokey boi can penetrated it?
---
looks like floor supports stacked.
---
If you're a rifle build and can grab tormentor I would definitely recommend it, very helpful for legs on anything fast
---
Enjoy your fixer it may not be the lvl 50 but I’m sure you would want the one you chose than the a regular lvl 50
---
This is the first online community I've ever witnessed so many people that are outraged about having to put in even the slightest bit of effort to receive a reward. Did all of you have to turn down the difficulty when you played Bethesdas other Fallout/TES games or something?
---
I’m not really go for OP damage since I don’t like playing bloodied or junkies, and I want to keep stealth for my rifleman build so run and gun will be my go to for my commando.
---
Here is a secret when you finish line in the sand check r&amp;g station out sometimes you will be surprised
---
*spams X*
---
&gt;they r gonna ban if u have d/uped weapons
---
I doubt it, they have never banned for simply owning a single one of said item.  Otherwise if you EVER touched a TSE or most items on the market subs your facing a ban
---
Hell they didnt even ban people who were getting duped SH, and that would be easy as hell to figure out
---
&gt;or if u have ur tent at the "line in the sand
---
Thats a super specific thing and is very minor compared to other issues/exploits.  Major doubts they would waste time on this
---
&gt;used the door glitch at v79 for the legendary robot
---
Door glitches have been in game since launch,  i know people who did it to "beat" washout.  If they didnt ban people for that i doubt they would ban over a 1* item off a robot
---
Curious did you use the god mode glitch to acquire score fast before you were banned?
---
Insert "Shut up and take my money" gif
---
I started a new toon for double coverage weekend and on doing the initial few Responder quests ended up with the Responder White Fire Helmet. I couldn’t believe it! I haven’t gotten one of those since launch.
---
I also found a level 45 bloodied handmade in a vendor. 1 star but it’s the first I’ve found. I’ve had two level 35s for two of my toons (one explosive) whixh are still great, but I’ve wanted one of these for a year. Still haven’t gotten any sort of bloodied fixer yet.
---
There’s a lot of wrong stuff about the Queen that gets posted here that people then pass around and take as truth because it’s a lot easier to believe Bethesda is bad.
---
The repercussions? Lost caps and junk? Those have never changed.
---
What's changed is Slap Damage is gone, so unless you decide to fight back they can never hurt you.
---
Just because you don't like the mode doesn't mean them using a part of their game as a single daily out of 9 is poor game design. Lots of people enjoy NW and gain a rank without any issue.
---
Great suggestions my friend!
---
I dont see why not, you'd really want an bloody explosive rifle so you can get extra damage if you have demo expert on. Unfortunately explosive weapons are not that good but if you're aiming to cripple a bloodied or two shot explosive shot gun with enforcer rank 3 is the go to. You can cripple a massive area of mobs with 1 or 2 shots and take them out with a rifle or malee.
---
Hmm never thought of that. But if they wipe EVERYTHING, wouldn’t that wipe the atom shop crafting abilities as well? I mean the atom shop basically allows us to use atoms to unlock plans. If all other unlocked plans are wiped they could potentially delete those as well?
---
Nope. Just kept doing the daily and weekly as well as the repeatable
---
Is the Lone Vault Wanderer a Bethesda employee?
---
Someone opened a lunchbox and you’re getting a temporary bonus effect.
---
I am just getting into this game so I am beginning to appreciate the time and effort needed (and cash, possibly lots of cash) for pics like this. Very nice!
---
I was fine with them taking it out. Just that they added it back to 76 but just a little bit more difficult. Yeah in the previous title's there were no crafting materials outside of ammo primer and such, but you could still go to ppl and have them repair it for caps. I just would like some more options outside of using crafting materials and repair kits, ya know
---
What are lunchboxes and how do i get them?
---
Was that sarcasm?
---
You're probably right
---
Someone is opening the lunch boxes that are awarded along the season pass. If you're close enough to the player that opens it, you get to share the effects.
---
Afaik it now benefits from Commando, which is fine for me as it’s my backup weapon to quickly switch to.
---
Yes! I would want an instigating faster swing speed bumper sword since im a rifleman and 2 handed build. Imagine how powerful that would be lol.
---
You missed the point.
---
Poor game design is needing to make a new character to achieve a daily in a reasonable amount of time. I play the mode. If my main was rank 100+, why should I have to spend vastly more time to complete a daily than a level 2 would? That's poor game design.
---
Don't fucking give them any ideas
---
We all have I think
---
How many times are you going to smash something in the face with a gatling  or any gun come to think of it.
---
Legendary Run rewards.
---
Or just make it so that each item in your camp levels with the ground below it so that you could place your camp wherever without worry most of the time. Unless the base of your camp is one ir two tiles long you wont be able to place it wherever you want
---
I wish this game was like new Vegas meets fallout and I feel it would have been several times better
---
That’s my issue with it, if it started to benefit from Guerilla and pistol perks then AutoPistol builds would actually hold some merit.
---
I saw a YouTuber posted a video he got banned even though he hadn’t duped, but knew he had duped items on him. Meanwhile he posted videos detailing how to get into god mode and was at 100  in the first few days of the season. Was thinking maybe that was why. Heck, half the community probably has duped items on them. I’m sure I do. No other reason you can think of they did this to you?
---
Have you ever had to buy something in the atom shop, open your Pip-Boy, go to notes, read a plan, and *then* go to an armor workbench to craft your vampire costume? No. You just know it already.
---
well, then I'm not sure you should even bother with explosives. What's your goal with using them that can't be achieved by just getting your hands on an explosive fixer/handmade/combat rifle/assault rifle?
---
Wow nicely done
---
i hate dying after the SBQ goes down. someomes always waiting to snatch flux. lol.
---
Deathclaw gauntlet, power fist, meat hook
---
Ah most definetly, I love both them pistols and the Dks is a great sniper, much prefer using it on f3 and fnv compared to the sniper on 4/76.
---
If vault tec wanted us to Rebuild the world then why cant we rebuild the world?
---
It's not something you really need to worry about for PA. My Ultracite has lasted me the best part of 100 levels and a shit tonne of battles and I've never had to even replace a part.
---
Holy crap! It is a Level 50 on top of it too though! Thank you so much!
---
Is there any type of weapon you like I should be on the look out for? I highly doubt I'll stumble onto anything but on the off chance I do, I could save it for you.
---
yeah you've got some kind of glitch on your end. Tried restarting?
---
Exactly! we need more cowboy guns!
---
throw in the ranger seqoiua aswell for good measure.
---
Its not fully broken, it works... when it wants too... some times unequiping it and reequipping it helps but it breaks again
---
I use the hardened receiver, extended barrel, piercing mag, and aligned stock. Pretty happy with that.
---
Don’t worry lol I don’t need anything I got what I want on this game I just love helping people out no matter what
---
im actually using a mod to swap the skin to the fixer... and i forgot i had it on tbh, the only thing that changes is the furniture.
---
but yeah they are the same fuckin shape and animations and should share skins
---
https://imgur.com/mJ8OVjA
---
Ya bud!! Instead of new guns and weapons all they really need to do is buff the ones we have. Might make it feel like a new game!!
---
Why can’t u have a tent at line in the sand???
---
They haven't been able to since wastelanders
---
I love the location. Where is it?
---
I slightly prefer auto. You use more ammo but it’s a lot of fun. That said I have both and once you’ve leveled up enough it’s easy to swap between the two. In fact honestly rank up your auto and give it a whirl, it’s easy to swap back if you don’t enjoy. The perk load out should be the same except rifleman is swapped for commando, you don’t need to worry about ground pounder.
---
Sometimes it makes it 10x better for like 30 seconds so me AP doesn’t drain whatsoever
---
Ha
---
Yea it’s pretty stupid, idk how much a power armor weighs, but I’m going to assume with the armor pieces it should be enough to bend or flatten nails on a wooden plank. But no.
---
Well, believe it only a few things here are from the Atom store so it's not bad. (I do think I'm too obsessed on the base-building part of this game, though) Should spend more timing looting lol!
---
If you need anything and you're on Xbox feel free to stop on by and I'll see if I can help!
---
Man imagine having to juggle perks specials and skills that be like the most diverse character build ever
---
Not seeing any difference where? 
---
The perks work exactly as advertised, as long as you have them equipped. If you're tight on perk slots you just get the first star of each for 30% damage for 3 points. If you can afford it you get all 9 for 60% damage.
---
It ain't missing textures the textures are stretched lol
---
Jokes aside it is getting annoying having more and more stuff like this popping up
---
It's been the same way trying to get a guass minigun, sitting around over 60 attempts.
---
No but that’s because the unlocking and learning was done in one step. I guess only those who got wiped can answer this with 100% certainty lol
---
it's an SMG, not an autopistol. But yes, it definitely needs more mods!
---
Yeah just seen them in a data mine video. Looks like they might be flat walls similar to what's currently available under defenses. Not the chunky 1s that had large gaps between them in 4
---
Oh ok.
---
People would use that as a reason the game was bad.
---
If you have all 5 pc unyielding armor, you get 5x the 3 point bonus on stats. Egghead mutation gives you 8 intelligence. Broiled scorchbeast brain gives a boost, and of course max special points in intelligence.
---
This is why I don’t ever pvp. I don’t play these games to be harassed by some bored dipshit. Passive mode on and I’m happy.
---
I just like having a backup weapon, as impractical as it may be. Like my rifleman build has a shotgun as a backup that is meant for when enemies get up close and personal, but doesn’t do the most damage it can do.
---
Egg Head mutation, certain chems, joining a building public team, certain foods.
---
Yes you can have 5 pieces of unyielding for +15 to all stats aside from Endurance.
---
I mean, those weapon are legacy, they don't drop anymore, and most of them are duped one. So it's not really a good idea to buy one.
---
Then maybe there could be a middle ground, where they add stock options and if there is a full stock it would benefit from Commando but if it’s no stock then Guerilla
---
Egg Head with Strange in numbers is the easiest(+8)
---
It's the same for your camp, yes.
---
You can, im just saying that abusing that exploit probably wont result in a ban.  It is a lot more hands on and RNG dependant to abuse compared to past exploits that people didnt get banned for (frag diffuse iirc)
---
No crossplay
---
Recently I’ve been trying to drop ammo I don’t use and plans I already know if I catch someone just exiting the vault or at least roaming the area at a low level. Usually every couple days after I’ve built up an amount that might help another player through an area or a quest or two. I remember ammo being an issue at the start (at least when I played at launch), and I was bouncing between gun types for a while before I could actually settle on a specific type of gun by choice.
---
couldn't agree more. I made a low level rifle just so i could atleast display the skin at my camp. smfh.
---
Gamepass
---
Thanks, is it possible to get 100 intelligence?
---
I've done around 60 attempts for a bloodied Gauss and still no bloodied but have gotten everything else multiple times.  It seems rng really thinks I should be focusing on killing robots.
---
You can have a full set of unyielding. It will stack. Look for meat that up your int. Get the carnivor mutation it will double the  effect. Get on a Building public team. Mentats.
---
Thanks, good to know
---
The 10mm pistol is already your auto pistol. Not sure why you’re trying to turn the SMG into one too.
---
Well, two things.  First, when you blueprint something, it doesn't store the "Thing".  It only stores a plan for the thing.  So, you didn't actually store your camp, you stored a plan for it.  When you placed the blueprint, it should have placed the items, unless they weren't properly selected when creating the blueprint.  Common items that don't get auto tagged when blueprinting are workbenches, furnishings and turrets.  You have to manually ensure they are all marked in white before saving the blueprint.  
---
The blueprint trick works to place items that are hard to place, but is not intended for an entire camp.  I doubt you'll ever get a camp blueprint that places everything every time.  Terrain is different and stairs in particular tend to ruin a good blueprint, making it unplaceable.  The best option for you moving forward is use Prefabs to create small modular pieces of a larger camp, such as the train car, log cabin or bungalow.  If you follow this approach, when you move your camp it will break down automatically into blueprints for each module/prefab.  Most of the time, unless you have stairs connected to something when you move, it will place back down in big blueprinted chunks.  My own camp is made this way and I move it all the time.  Foundations and stairs simply do not move well.  That's why most camps that are designed to be portable are designed with a very small footprint, usually a 1x1 foundation or at most a 2x2.  Sorry you are having trouble, but unfortunately the camp system in FO76 is not the easiest to master.
---
I've been looking for a junkies swing speed +1 strength shovel forever.
---
I have 2 or 3 reduced weight shovels with the best being mutant slayers with swing speed.
---
Still looking!!
---
Why’s it an exploit??
---
Possible.  Not very likely but it is "possible"
---
thx a lot
---
yeah it's really mind-boggling how they couldn't be bothered to finish what they started for a industry-standard text chat even given the issues that voice chat has/had for a long time that they only 'fixed' 1,5 years after release
---
The toy gun sound ruins that weapon for me, but I’m on board with a skin for it.
---
I've literally gotten 8 suppressors out of 12
---
Outside on the ledge, kinda left to the opening. It was actually daytime. I'm not sure what time tho. I tried shooting it but it wouldn't die
---
How wholesome lol
---
What's the situation with your C.A.M.P.'s spawn points? Is it at least tolerable or a nightmare to reach your front door?
---
I always run this event when it pops up!  It's so great for farming XP and Legendaries, since the event constantly bombards you with Ghouls.   It's also good for picking up caps and chems, since the ghouls in that event usually carry quite a bit of each.
---
Unfortunately, the Fixer is itself an appearance mod of the combat rifle. That would have to change.
---
Some girl lost it over area chat while i was blowing up brahmin in Flatwoods for that delicious ribeye steak ..
---
Not sure if trolling or something
---
I thought I was the only one, thank you for posting! I've sent an email to bethesda with video/picture proof. I'd recommend doing the same
---
Yeah, I decided to invest in 1st (originally mostly just for the scrap box and ranger outfit) and it works perfectly for the way I like to play. I’ll still pop into public servers occasionally for player vendors or if I want to run an event that requires help from others, but as I play solo the rest of the time it’s been more useful than I expected it to be
---
happened to me the other day. tried to put wood foundations down where the still touched ground. then floors elsewhere. that was a bad idea. stair glitched a few minutes later. smfh.
---
Because it is a bug that forces enemies to spawn in a location they are not designed to spawn at.  So when you do it on purpose you are exploiting said bug for benifit
---
I mean PA turned the tide of the battle of Anchorage against people with presumably small to large arms fire.
---
they're not rare anymore. They used to be way back last summer-ish, they'd drop so rarely and there was a Pioneer Scouts section requiring you to scrap 3 or something, so they went for big bucks in vendors and on trading sites. Bethesda changed it so they drop on deathclaw kills now, but they didn't used to.
---
i assume you mean the vendor.
---
U need to spawn more enemy’s at line in the sand lol. There’s not enough akready lol
---
Yeah that is what I was afraid of I just spent a few good hours getting my build setup nicely under a bridge
---
yeah i know its a mod but will it be under "misc" or will it be in the "primary"mod slot like buttressed is?
---
Ohhhhhh ok ok, soz I'm a real smooth brain and I just hopped back on not too long ago
---
I guess then that it might have something to do with my weapons huh?
---
The reason this a weird title is the last one got removed because I called it a T*ading p*st
---
Maybe or maybe even the dressing room/ break room by sire xharlie also
---
Morgantown HS and Watoga HS have a ton. plastic plates, silverware, and pumpkins galore.
---
i used to think months ago hoping servers refreshed drops..nope..lol.
---
You can get 4 int per slot with complete unyielding armor (and +1 int per piece). Even with this, I see it complicated.
---
Exactly bob, bigger arsenal of viable weps to use= more fun.
---
Spawn rates of events are based on # of players.  Exploit has nothing to do with rate
---
So i finally did a queen, here's the conclusion.
---
TS (13 per bullet) 26, Anti Armor + stabilized 27, Furious 35. 
---
So i'm not sure what's going on here but it seems Furious is the best one and followed by AA, what i don't understand is how little damage it does. In the end it could be that Furious does more damage because it's damage increases per shot while AA just increases the amount it deals in one shot by removing 72% armor. Which means it'll do less damage when stabilized is off.
---
I think the dj on appalachia radio asks at some point how many caps to 16 tons, guess you could figure that out easily from there.

Nobody in the small town of Nitro, W.Va., knew. Toddlers played in day care downstairs, senior citizens lunched in the cafeteria, the entire Nitro Police Department worked out of the same building.
---
And all the while, upstairs in Room 201 of the former high school building, a French woman and her assistant worked to clone a West Virginia politician's dead baby.
---
Mark Hunt didn't tell his secret until after he had given up the quest — for now. And only on the grounds of failure.
---
Mr. Hunt, a Charleston lawyer whom Kanawha County voters elected three times to the state House of Delegates, rented the space in the Nitro Community Center for $347.58 a month. On the lease, he said his purpose was a "research venture."
---
Mr. Hunt paid Brigitte Boisselier — who is also a bishop in a church that ascribes divine status to cloning — $5,000 a month to work on the first human clone, that of his 10-month-old son Andrew, who died after surgery for a heart defect. He spent nearly $500,000 all told, he said, and he'll spend more if he gets the chance.
---
The lawyer said in a telephone interview last week that he and his wife "decided, for the first time in human history, since Jesus raised Lazarus, to transcend the great gulf of death and bring our baby home — to create an identical twin of Andrew."
---
Mr. Hunt said he and his wife realize that a clone wouldn't restore their son, but a duplicate child would be "some solace." Miss Boisselier's group Clonaid was the only group prepared to attempt a human clone from cells of a deceased person, he said.
---
He called the undertaking "a great adventure" and said he isn't ashamed of seeking to duplicate life, "but we kept it secret because press coverage would have jeopardized it."
---
Last week, Mr. Hunt announced that he had severed ties with the cloning group and closed the lab where researchers had hoped to clone DNA from Mr. Hunt's dead child.
---
Mr. Hunt said he lost confidence in Miss Boisselier recently because she became "a press hog," giving many international news interviews on behalf of the cloning project, and on behalf of the Raelian religion.
---
Miss Boisselier was one of a team of scientists, led by Dr. Severino Antinori, who announced at a National Academy of Sciences panel last week that it would clone babies for 200 couples within the next few months.
---
Agents of the Food and Drug Administration came to Mr. Hunt, alarmed by reports that a human clone was being attempted in Nitro. Mr. Hunt said he promised the federal officials that no human cloning would occur in Nitro, but Miss Boisselier gave another TV interview saying a cloned baby would be achieved within six weeks
---
Mr. Hunt said the FDA asked him if he had misled the U.S. agency. So he closed the Nitro laboratory and changed its locks.
---
But when the people of Nitro found out — four months after federal officials started investigating the lab — several were not happy.
---
Greg Casto, director of the Nitro Community Center, said he did not know the lab was being used for work aimed at cloning a human being.
---
Mr. Casto related to the Gazette details of a phone conversation he had last week with Mr. Hunt when the news about the lab broke in Nitro. Mr. Hunt has since refused to speak to reporters.
---
"I've got two sets of parents out front — in fact, they're still there — saying they don't want to bring their children to the day care," Mr. Casto said he told the lawyer.
---
Mr. Hunt will remove the equipment from the now-closed lab as soon as he can find "a safe, dry place" to store it, according to Mr. Casto.
---
He also told Mr. Casto that the scientists had not been there since "probably the beginning of June."
---
According to Mr. Casto, the lawyer told him: "Between you and me, that's the reason I let them go. Because they weren't doing anything. They weren't working. What I wanted them to do was look at the DNA of my son Andrew, to see if it was viable or not. They weren't doing it."
---
Mr. Hunt said the lab's refrigerator contained only a medium used to keep DNA alive. He said no actual cloning was ever supposed to happen in the Nitro lab.
---
The scientists were only supposed to study Andrew's DNA there, to see if they could successfully clone him.
---
Upstairs from the Nitro Community Center cafeteria — past the old high-school lockers, and classrooms-turned-offices rented to more ordinary businesses — there's a locked classroom door with a little glass window.
---
Through the window, you can see Miss Boisselier's lab. Even to the untrained eye, it hardly looks like it cost $500,000 to set up.
---
The walls are decorated with huge blown-up photos of egg cells, either human or animal. In front of the blackboard, there's a desk, much like a teacher's desk, with a computer and printer and scanner. Then there are two chemistry lab tables, with the sinks everyone remembers from high school.
---
On one table, the sink holds a bar of soap. The rest of the table is occupied by a scale, a Brita pitcher full of clear liquid and one piece of equipment the size of a microwave oven. On top of the machine rests what appears to be a box of rubber gloves Evolution One brand.
---
On the other table, the sink holds a big bottle of washing-up liquid and a roll of paper towels. The equipment on that table is an incubator, which Mr. Hunt told Mr. Casto "burned up the first time we plugged it in."
---
The Clonaid Web site listed no physical address — only a cellular phone number in Las Vegas for public relations employee Nadine Gary. Miss Gary said Miss Boisselier was attending a conference on human cloning and referred questions to her. Miss Boisselier could not be reached for comment last week.
---
The Clonaid site does offer brief explanations of the services it sells:
---
c Clonaid: For as little as $200,000, Clonaid will clone a person as soon as its scientists figure out how. Especially targeted "to wealthy parents worldwide After the first success, it is likely that the next clients on the list will be chosen according to their bid (for financial priority reasons) so that the money collected will help improve the technique from which everyone will benefit."
---
c Clonapet: Coming soon: "The cloning of pets to wealthy individuals who wish to see their lost pet brought back to life." Also available for owners who want to resurrect dead racehorses.
---
c Insuraclone: For $50,000, get anyone's DNA cryogenically frozen until science can cure whatever killed them.
---
The Clonaid site also offers a link to a letter credited to Mr. Hunt. It is addressed to James C. Greenwood, chairman of the House subcommittee on oversights and investigations.
---
"Who am I and why do I support human cloning?" the letter begins. "I am a successful attorney, a former state legislator, a current elected official, a husband, a son, a brother, but most importantly, I am a father."
---
The letter reveals that the writer, at age 38, was "blessed with a perfect baby boy," that the boy grew to recognize his father and call him "Dada," that he and his wife were told their son had a 94 percent chance of making it through his heart surgery, and that the writer spared no expense in trying to find a way to bring his son back.
---
"I must withhold my identity until after the project is successful," the letter concludes. "However, our commitment to human cloning and to duplicating our child is unlimited.
---
"Hopefully one day we can all celebrate our family and friends, my wife and our son, Dr. Brigitte and the brave new world."
---
I solo it and the rates are stupidly high. Great little exp mine that event
---
Does the flair not show on mobile or something?
---
I'm a raider thats what makes it fun. It's just scrap stuff not guns or armor. Rule is always bank your stuff.
---
Yep!! Was hoping the legendary perks would help boost a bunch of the weaker guns and melee. Maybe in the future!
---
What weapons specifically are you using with these perks?
---
Congratulations, I've tried around 60 times to craft one of those and still haven't got it.
---
Nicely done 
---
Makes me realize how underwhelming my base is.
---
I got 60 stims from 2 kind souls the other today after not having more than 10 stims from level 10 to 20
---
I can't say for sure of course, as I am on pc, but I got the achievement when I finished the event alone. So it might be bugged on xbox 🤷‍♂️
---
Serendipity is a must have when bloodied
---
BTW, its 6,538,268.5 caps
---
I was lv41 two days ago. 50 with Tuesdays weeklys sounds about right. i said fck it and ranked up with some atoms anyways.
---
I got Unyeilding on my second attempt for chest piece.  I knew it was lucky, &amp; that when I eventually get to arms &amp; legs I'm gonna have to go through it, but not 80+ attempts.  I might just not...
---
Yeah but doesn't matter what Bethesda puts out there will always be those ppl
---
I think you're yanking my chain BUT i have nothing else better to do for 2 weeks so...
---
Maybe they did change it, I remember a guy posted a pic of him and two dead colossuses at Dropsite V9 and said he had a blast after the Queen battle.
---
Ikr I rlly miss the skills man
---
I can't speak about SS, but the only armor the purveyor ever gives me is unyielding, it feels like.
---
Been trying to upgrade a light chameleon combat leg i’ve had since early in the game to a heavy forever and finally found one at a player vendor this am.  Way stoked
---
A little bit I actually found my first red on the vendorbot there a long time ago
---
Do not forget the reflex sight
---
ya if I come in with my BE 50 cal. everything is dead. Been gun butting lego mobs to share.
---
I haven't hit 100 with any of the 3 characters I have and I frequently sell things for cheap or give them away. If I don't need the mats or have an abundance why hoard it?
---
Keep at it brother. Just yesterday I finally rolled a 3 star Uny, AP, fall damage leg. Exactly what I wanted. I've now got 2 great SS pieces.  My other Uny parts are 1 so-so 2 star, and two one star parts. At least it's a full set. Keep at it
---
Maybe they don’t know about scrip? I’ll take free anything at this point.
---
Even small things I've been really grateful for, big thanks to the player that dropped me 40 purified water very early on. Seriously has been so useful.
---
It also could have something to do with the all the Gauss weapons doing artificial explosive damage. Explosive bypasses DR entirely, so when combined with AA it’s like the AA attribute is wasted.
---
These perks might also help: Incisor (armor penetration with melee weapon), martial artist (+swing speed with melee), glowsight (bonus damage against glowing enemies), barbarian (+dmg in melee IIRC), tank killer (rifles ignore X% of armor).
---
Bloody mess (if you have the spare points in LCK)
---
Try equipping (any given weapon) then check its stats.  Unequip one of your perK cards, and check stats again.  Does dmg change?
---
Alos remember foods, mutations, and diseases may affect specific weapon abilities - some positive, some negative.
---
I just gave up. With the Thorn Armor it just took me about 20 pieces to get the full unyielding set
---
Some idiot tried to pvp me in my camp with his shiny new explosive Fixer. I just let him waste his time and ammo.
---
And then he went to a vendor...which I promptly scrapped. Now I don't have a mic, and it seems he didn't either, but judging by the fireworks he tried to blind me with he wasn't a happy bunny.
---
He went behind my camp to my resource collector. As he stooped next to it, probably to pick the lock, I server hopped. 
---
I'm not one to laugh out loud during gameplay but I made an exception...😅😅😅
---
Looks nice. I like the outdoorsy look. Also, in post apocalyptia, I dont think an RR would be bad on the green.
---
I used to be able to umm.. participate in that but *the sweet spot* has apparently moved.  I can't seem to place *the item* correctly any more.  What changed? PM me if you know.
---
I would, but I’m only 1 cap away from whitesprings train station so I don’t mind.
---
What damage are you putting with that? I just crafted my shotty and rolled a two shot off and fast reload. Want bloodied really but for now it will do.
---
I had it spawn twice in a row after consecutive queen nukes. Damn thing's a bullet sponge that's for sure.
---
Ive seen a better ship camp but the conduit is a nice touch. It was much larger 3x10 or maybe 11 full foot print though so it masked its boxyness with size. Size is your friend in these builds to smooth things out. Like to see this on water somewhere with a nice sunset shot. Im working on a castle build and to make things less boxy im gonna have to stuff a 9x9 structure in the camp space. Its barely doable with walls in the corners but i need a tree in the middle to place my module on for the extra height.
---
really? I go for my death bag and its always gone.
---
So my best guess is to stay with Furious until i get a Bloodied gauss minigun. Unless the AA proves to be deadlier in pvp than the Furious one. Since i tend to call my weapons anti toxicity when they're great for pvp
---
I'm using the All-Rise sledgehammer, and lever action rifle with hunting rifle
---
It disappears to limbo now.  Always dump your junk, mons will get it if players dont
---
Ah I see, almost the same as I wrote in my post
---
Can’t see it. That would be a serious swerve into pay to win.
---
What does RNJ mean? The only definition I have found is Redneck Jackoff LOL
---
LOL well that escalated quickly..
---
Might be daft but have you selected them?  You have to press x in the weapon menu, then a dot appears on the left- looks same as selected weapon.
---
Thank you! Basically, I wanted something more unique. I quickly noticed that the majority of the bases I was visiting were following a similar plan. A building with everything in, and some stuff scattered around. I wanted to make a perimeter wall which made the area inside safe (for immersion anyways)
---
And at the same time I didn't want the main focus to be the building(s), I want there to be features all around
---
i would of dropped thier ungrateful asses and moved on.
---
I feel like I got it yesterday when I checked his shack out for clues. Figured I'd finish it today and went into robco only to no longer have the key card. Good one Bethesda.
---
Score seasons don't seem to be something that will end so I figured they would always remain as rewards for doing that.
---
Ha! That's an insult I haven't heard before and I love it! Did they recently add this one?
---
What rank are u currently
---
Not sure. I keep everyone's voice volume on 0.
---
If they do get mad and yell I wouldn't know lol.
---
You also need bullion for the mods for it. But a great weapon it is, I love it.
---
I feel you man.I think I have a nice,homely base,but every time I see a post like this it reminds me how shitty my base actually is.
---
My thoughts exactly, although I do feel as though there's still a chance it will happen.  Unless they make a statement on it, only time will tell lol
---
Edit: spelling
---
If you have at least level one of each of the cards you mentioned, you should see the listed damage increased when you inspect the weapon.  They should be working for those weapons, 10% per card. Equip the weapon before inspecting it.
---
same. lmao
---
People can see this a pay to win. I'm indifferent on it, other people's experience gain or levels doesn't really matter to me. I can see how other people might not like it though, I personally just won't buy them.
---
Oh i get it, I always like a roof over benches and shops, just for feeling of getting out of rain or heat. I dont know why i do it really. Now my camp is underground, so totally different mechanic there.
---
Have they made a statement on it being added?
---
Lovely spot on the west side. It's on the water and has a junk pile (Junk is king). It usually has an NPC chopping logs near there and they will defend your camp from the pesky level 5 enemies that sometimes come knocking. 
---
 https://imgur.com/3tJWExs
---
👍🏻
---
Sorry man, I had to.
---
Hopefully its not too close to the resort, that place gets nuked a lot when I log in.
---
I’m not that efficient with my leveling, but I managed to get my new characters up to level 32, which is nice.
---
One tip I have to pick a location that has a resource vein. You can find a whole map on Google. I recommend looking for iron/steel or lead veins. Or if you can't pick a single resource there are junk piles that gives you random resources.
---
Ahahahah RNG Random Number Generator 
---
R N G
---
RNJEsus
---
I think I'll try there, it's near one of them real big forest things apparently assaults respawn so I'll just keep checking.
---
I would be in the process of hitting a tent scrap box. then get surrounded in the dam tent lmao. Been staying on top of the tent for few minutes now.
---
Not that I'm aware, although that's not to say they haven't, if someone has a source
---
Best xp grind for high level players hands down
---
Cause we need more options
---
Here's the link to the map: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/12/81cf730f.png
---
I replaced serendipity with grim reapers sprint since I'm always in stealth anyways and it helped alot, I actually really like that perk card and might mess with my special points to fit more luck into my build.
---
Around 20ish
---
Where is it located?
---
I was hoping he'd be a NPC once Wastelanders is out, even if it's just a RE for the lolz.
---
Ingenious use for the corner wall units for the hull!
---
This is my experience too.
---
I started at level 133, just hit 150 today. I am happy with that, as I haven't been able to play as much as I usually do since weekends are family time.
---
I actually tried that, but I found it really difficult to break up the roof area needed rather than have it look the same all the way. How'd you manage to get it underground?!
---
Oh, I've had to log out a few times lol
---
   : otherwise if you’ve ever touched a TSE....
---
The only TSE I’ve ever had was an event reward from this past Fascnacht.
---
I’d be right PO’ed to get a nastygram about It.
---
I get what you're saying, the more I've thought about it the more i think it won't affect me, but i still get an uneasy feeling about it lol
---
Oh I see! Brits but mostly americans use so many acronyms I get lost all the time
---
Question- if you run bloodied then is there any point in life giver perk?
---
Closest to Slocum Joe's a bif of the way upstream. The noise from a generator which you will have to use at some point will attract enemies. Turrets take up a LOT of CAMP budget.    
---
You should come back to your CAMP a few times when needed anyway.    
---
Don't Bulk every item as only a few reduce in weight from single scrap vs bulk scrap. You can find the list online easily.    
---
Keep the layout simple. My main is 79 and the CAMP hasn't changed much other than location since I first built it around level 7. IMO, a CAMP should be efficient more than it should be 'flashy'.    
---
A few times I came back and there was a lot of damage but fixing them is cheap. It's part of living in the wasteland.
---
But "the fixer" is this weapon's unique skin. The green color is unique and by design. That's why there is no skin slot on this gun. Just because it's uber popular they should change it?
---
Good to hear, but  i gotta admit that it makes the 10 stimpaks and 2 cores/radaways that I dropped for a newbie the other day seem like chump change. Embarrassed Heh heh
---
YES! The atoms from the challenges are on the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) "pocket", and not the Steam "pocket"!
---
Yeah, I suppose this is the most likely scenario.  I knew i should have taken this tinfoil hat off
---
I'm on PC.    
---
If you have questions shoot me a PM so we don't clog your post.
---
Totally agree with you man, everytime I take a workshop I never really expect pvp to happen, but I get a lil excited just in case something is gonna happen 
---
A change I wish would happen is that if I own a workshop and someone comes onto it (not neccessarily claiming it from me or anything) I should be able to engage pvp onto them, kinda like some angry farmer yelling get off my lawn type stuff
---
This would be more fair considering its your «property» at the moment and giving others the edge for pvp is kinda BS. This way both partys can initiate pvp so it makes it a bit more exciting with workshops
---
Everyone wants to see brag posts XD
---
Put an instrument on a staircase. Have the flooring low enough to the ground on a hill or similar. Move the stair from the open are to the underground section so only the handle appears above the ground. To go underground you play the instrument then get and you will be standing on the remaining stair underneath the map. From there just build with almost no restrictions.
---
Started at level 32 last night and, within two hours tops (with lunchboxes, Cranberry relish, and Brain Bombs) hit 75.
---
Right on! I'll be sure to keep these ones in mind once I start grinding!
---
If you don't automatically Blueprint your CAMP it does it for you to a degree. Sometimes it works and others you do have to rebuild but you don't lose the items. You're only out on time and space.
---
I had this to, and I feel like the inability to scrap foundations and stairs skyrocketed again since the last update.
---
I'm afraid there's nothing left but re-place your camp nodule. (You don't have to move though, you can place the camp module in the the same spot.)
---
If you don't have the appropriate perks equipped then weapons won't show the difference right?
---
wow such interesting
---
Definitely. Find one or multiple  people to do it properly where you're all trying to kill each other to get the mask and you'll have a blast. Just stash your junk at the Watoga station beforehand and there is no risk, just plain fun. Bonus points if everyone uses ridiculous weapons like rolling pins and golf clubs.
---
It's an easy way for them to inch their way into worse things, I highly doubt they will do this. If they do, the easiest way to show them we don't approve is to not buy them. However, seeing as some people will pay close to $100 if not more than that to complete the whole season with no effort, if they did decide to do this, it would make tons of money and make them think that we want this, when in reality, it's the minority who are spending massive amounts of money and ruining it for the majority.
---
It's on top of the world at seneca rocks!
---
Ok thanks. That sounds like a good idea
---
Yeah that's what I ended up doing. Luckily my larg-ish house not seen in the pic didn't have any problem being placed
---
This would be great, but until we maybe get it my suggestion is instead of stocking up on gunpowder try stock up on acid and cloth, then when crafting ammo try to make as much gunpowder as you think youll be using for your crafting, that way it wont mess with your weight as much
---
Claiming workshops
---
No, not at all. There is a fixed spawn point just in front of the concrete stairs that connect to a foundation that holds the stairs that lead to the ship :)
---
Still hunting several:
---
Red asylum dress 
---
A mumber of  robot models (had them, but the auto scrap when repairing system trashed them even though I had plenty of steel scrap steel on hand
---
marine armor helmet plan
---
and the main one - a FSS vampire switchblade.
---
I'm wondering if it will actually be rougher on the lower leveled players. Until you have a good set up and farming down there are periods that get a bit desperate at the lower levels. If they can no longer retreat to the forest and beat up the lower level stuff for ammo and scrap it's going to up the learning curve, especially if they dont research things like perks ahead of time.
---
I know I'm not going to hit 100.    
---
"Ghost of Tsushima" has eaten up most of what game time I do have.
---
[Oh sh!t.mp4]
---
You find it
---
I think they will just be via the seasons. They are fun.
---
Sneak food unarmed. bloodied death claw gauntlet faster swing and str. If I’m all buffed up, I can hit 10k a shot. If she gets stunned in the air, she won’t land for a long time. Explosive guns stun her in mid air, so that might be the reason she doesn’t land. Plus, SBQ doesn’t take damage from ANY KINDS OF EXPLOSIVE DAMAGE, a lot people don’t realize this. Honestly, I get a better time by myself or with a friend than doing it publicly sometimes. But If everyone is on the same page in public, 2 mins is the fastest I’ve seen it killed.
---
Im using my weeklys during double score
---
I was lucky enough to roll a couple good ones. My primary is bloodied w/50 limb and faster reload. It's absolutely insane with low health, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, all the bloodied stuff etc. I'm not sure of the exact # as I'm not on the game right now and the exact# changes with health percentage. But with full shotgun perks it's around 2000+-ish? If I recall. If you equip 5 points of demo expert it goes up from there. (Gauss Shotgun has built in explosive effect and responds to demo expert). I use shotgun perks and skeet shooter. Enforcer is handy as well if you have slots for it.
---
The other is anti armor w/limb and 250 dr while reloading, I use that with full health/vanguard armor. Honestly can't tell you the # because I haven't used it in awhile but around half of what the maximum bloody #s are. But it's anti armor so it still one shots almost anything.
---
Find it randomly
---
Dude. Wtf this changes everything
---
If you're talking about the small backpack and the full size one you get from the pioneer scout quest, then yes, you want to get the full backpack because it will increase the efficiency of the chemist backpack. You can apply the chemist mod to either backpack. If you're talking about the high capacity mod for the scout backpack, then no, you can only have one mod on the backpack and the chemist backpack is a mod.
---
Why u mean unyielding armor ? That crafted gear
---
Oof topic but where did you get your vault suit? I been trying to find a more accurate suit but all I can find are costumes for halloween
---
[\*pretends to be shocked\*](https://media1.tenor.com/images/4a605f0d16b50317d55e81cfaa1ecc23/tenor.gif)
---
A lvl 2 likely doesnt play it at all. A lvl 100 likely has a lot to do in adventure as they spend a majority of their time in NW.
---
It's not effort. It's time consuming. It takes an hour or two to finish the normal dailies but then I am supposed to add another 3 hours to rank up in Nuclear Winter? So I'm suppose to spend 5 hours every day playing this game? It's not the only game ever made.
---
Yeah, tried that.
---
Literally no grenades could be equipped, even the verti-bird beacons
---
Thank you!
---
Turn on pacifist, no one can attack you
---
That's my understanding of it, geared for a fight if anyone wants to throw down over it.
---
Only mention I’ve seen is your post.
---
Most of those challenges are broken since release, guess what, they never fix them.  
---
Now buy Atoms.
---
Do you mean repair? Or is like your camp just gets deleted and you have no budget used
---
I’ve heard people say how they have been given atoms by filling a ticket and showing they completed it and never got the atoms.
---
Exactly!
---
Oof. Way off the pace. Glitches a few days or don’t play to much?
---
I had a building completely set up. Dropped it several times. Logged in just now to set it up and it only gave me about half of my floors with only half of my crafting stations on them
---
I would settle for having one each at foundation and crater. Super annoying to not be able to do gold, vendor caps and scrip at the same place.
---
Yeah, pistols options are sadly... lacking. 
---
Bethesda should have stuck with the original fallout weapon categories: small arms/energy/heavy guns.
---
Right leg... Over 60 tries... Meh... Just keep going.
---
I'll just do the tree pose on top of the teapot.
---
Yeah I’m down. I think a DLC focusing on antique weapons like more revolvers and possibly a couple rifles like the rolling block or we could just add attachments like scopes or different bayonets.
---
Did a molerat or something else destroy them?
---
Interesting I'll see if that helps 👍
---
Yeah it's just a thought i had, I thought I'd ask if anyone heard anything about it just
---
Not that I’m aware of. I was offline. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
No thank you
---
NP.
---
Oh, and armor, underarmor, mod, or mutation that has +STR is good for the melee side.   Motion assist servos mod for PA, for example, provides  +2 STR.
---
Shielded BoS underarmor has +2 (IIRC), and Shielded Secret Service underarmor has +4
---
Marsupial adds STR, too.
---
Since you are melee, you are going to get hit - the healing factor mutation will help keep down the number of stimpacks you need to carry.
---
Be aware twisted muscles mutation will increase your melee damage significantly, but will also reduce your non-melee weapon accuracy.  You can alsooffset this somewhat with the class freak perk, and using scopes instead of hip fire.
---
Well... It's hard to explain. Your ballistic damage might surpass the rad effect. For example: I have a bloodied gamma gun (ballistic 400 radiation 125) which can oneshoot green glowing max level ghouls, because they die quickly. 
---
A radium rifle can cause 150 ballistic damage before multipliers kick in. That's pretty decent damage. A powerful automatic radium rifle can shred. 
---
Of course, a combat rifle, fixer or handmade is a better commando weapon. But the radium rifle has style!
---
Ah, the problem is you let the game know you wanted unyielding. If you ask for vanguards you'll get Uny.
---
nope not through wifi I'm using cable on a ps4 slim with the game on a SSD, I can play a lot of games with no issue for hours but not fo76 that keeps lagging and disconects and bugs related to connection, is the code/server bad implemented or they are using the cheapest.

Guns Stealth Commando has:
---
Fixer, CR, Handmade, Radium, Assault, Laser, Plasma, Pipe, Submachine, 10mm smg (10)
---
Guns AutoPistol has:
---
10mm, Pipe, Plasma, Laser (4)
---
Need i say more? Not only will it make AutoPistol build better, but it will also make it more available as there will be more guns in the legendary pool for Guerilla
---
Edit: Forgot Tesla which brings it to 11
---
Sounds like a you problem, bud. No issues here and not heard of anyone else having those issues.
---
Yes it does display 100% on your Pip-Boy but you actually aren’t getting the benefit.  You can easily notice the difference when killing Level 68 Super Mutants.  I average close to 2000 XP per Super Mutant when it doesn’t bug out.  When the bug occurs I get like 900 XP instead.
---
Yea, if you have no perks that benefit 10mm smg then it won’t change the damage
---
Thanks! Yes it could’ve taken a lot longer so it’s not even that bad in comparison. 
---
I will say that it’s worth it. I was using a two shot before that, and the difference is night and day with the bloodied. I was underwhelmed with the two shot but the bloodied is another world and was worth the wait. 
---
Good luck!
---
Do you have master, expert, and regular all equip at the same time? They stack on top of each other.
---
Uranium Fever is a great solo too
---
The one thing I miss from fallout 4 is a coast, I loved building by the ocean
---
Oh wow, that's great news! I'm glad it worked out. :D
---
Apparently I’ve never killed the queen lol
---
The Fixer is a skin
---
Edit: your downvoting but it’s true 
---
The Fixer is literally a combat rifle isn’t it?
---
Same animations and sounds but I guess I’m making that up right?
---
Yep its happening to a bunch of us
---
This guy felt that 349 was too low of a price for serums, and that I'm negatively affecting the economy by selling that cheap. 
---
His were like 1500 each.  Called me stupid because they sell for 2k+ at the vendor.
---
What are you? A cop? Hush boy.
---
They need to make the event easier, or at least easier to solo.
---
The door glitch is also in FO4, so it seems more like a "feature" of the engine at this point
---
Usually I’m against people asking for things because of bugs but here I think you’ve got a point. The extra challenges don’t do you any good if those automatically complete on you too. 
---
I don’t know what *the* solution is. Not sure about a flat score award.  Maybe just extending the season an extra week?  There isn’t going to be anything that is going to be universally accepted but when Faschnat broke people seemed pretty happy with the extra time
---
Did my ticket just to be closed. Sad
---
I had some amazing person message me to ask if I was new. I’d just reached lvl 20 something I think. I said yeah. (I play on my boyfriend’s profile. We share a fallout 1st. And he’s much higher than me. I was scared this higher level person would think I was lying because they’d know about his character XD) 
---
They said they’d give me 5k caps. I’m a cynical person. I expected a catch. They bought one purified water from me for 5k caps.  Then they gave me a bunch of large holiday gifts. By the time I’d opened all of them and gotten settled. I had more plans than I knew what to do with and 10k caps. 
---
There were not enough heart emojis and thumbs ups.
---
Well i started playing again about 2 weeks or so but haven’t managed to make enough progress due to glitches
---
so how many times did you die, anyway?
---
At the moment I can't even find my deployable camp.. It seems to have disappeared..
---
Lots of flat ground under power pylons. Some are on slight inclines, but a lot of the pylons have flat ground under them perfect for building. Do a walkabout along the power lines and find the perfect one for you.
---
Yeah I do have them stacked up but I haven't really noticed any differences, but another user here gave me some great tips on how I can improve so I'm gonna do just that
---
Unyielding effect: +3 to all stats when you are at 25% or less health
---
edit: except endurance
---
Hey just letting you know I haven't forgotten you. I've gotten one reply in this time frame and it was some copy and paste message about SCORE that had absolutely nothing to do with the issue you and I are having
---
Thanks for the info. I always have it on just about,since the PvP isn't all too fun with the tick rate fluctuations.
---
I think they should do something like this but new art and style. Get really creative
---
Drop all your junk in a scrap/stash box.  No worries of theft.
---
It will only affect dailies on "high score weekend"
---
Reinstall the OS and start fresh, it's quicker.
---
I used to listen but after a while even the classic reply of 'do you kiss your mother with that mouth?' gets tiring.
---
Aah, kids in 18 rated games...
---
I dont think they will extend the season as the brotherhood season will launch as soon as the update releases, so unless that update gets delayed i doubt we get extra time, maybe a few permanent challenges that reset every season or something? Or seasonal challenges themselves, ranging in quantity of pay with a few more repeatables would be easier, then they could get away with maybe a 150 tier season next time
---
That’s not the issue at hand.  The issue is when Lunchboxes are used beyond the +100% bonus.  You and everyone loses that entire XP bonus.  Earlier today two people opened two additional Lunchboxes when we were at the +100% XP boost during Scorched Earth.  They screwed us all over because that  100% boost basically turned into 0% boost.  Six Lunchboxes were basically wasted.
---
Turn your damage numbers on. You should see a pretty significant difference.
---
I mean it's a smart move since the Tesla will hit your target no matter what the tick rate is like.
---
Damn, I wish I would have found this 2 days ago. Just rebuilt my base to get a few feet closer to the iron deposit, but I wanted lead. 
---
Now I have 1800 steel and 0 lead.  But I guess it would just be the opposite.  Thanks for the link though!
---
Imo they should have merged autopistols with commando and Semipistols with rifleman
---
I use **Quick Configuration INI Editor**, you can find it in Nexus mods, it makes it a whole lot easier and quicker, hence the name of the app.
---
This is my fear
---
Oh sweet. And btw how do you use your nuclear launch codes?
---
Yeah that one is annoying af
---
Bethesda havnt' said anythign about it.
---
My bet is before the end of the year they'll be the Atom shop, probably with some BS excuse such as "Due to overwhelmingly popularity lunchboxes have become, we've made the decision to place them in the Atom store. You can still earn them in game via (insert the methods to earn them at the time). Thank you to all the players for continuing to support..." yadda yadda you get the idea
---
I already know I'm not hitting the end. It sucks because I really like the power armor skin towards the end. Work doesn't leave a lot of time to play, although I've put dozens of hours over the last couple weeks. It still doesn't feel like enough &amp; now I know why. Guess I'll just have to be satisfied by what I can get.
---
It was just a joke, probably should've stated it better
---
Since Atomic Shop items are cosmetic, and account bound, I suspect they'd still be available even if all the characters were removed from the account
---
I'd also suspect any Atoms that were in the account beforehand would still be there after the fact (no reason to remove those, especially if they came from a 1st sub)
---
Thankfully no
---
No worries. I get it now. :)
---
Not everyone is running a bloodied build
---
You need four codes and then to find a briefcase (very rare, random on the map)
---
You need a briefcase, also have to find it
---
I'm always leaving giant piles of mats and weapons , even legendaries-- everywhere I go. The other day I was going through the WS firestation (although there's no fire truck in there now, sadly) and some dude was following me around begging for materials. I was kind of not into socializing but I thought to myself "I got plenty, I'll drop something for this guy over here in the hallway" ... when I turned to go out into the hallway (because the room I was in was littered with broken robots, I wanted to be sure this player could see the bag I was going to drop)... he said "OH man you don't have to be a dick about it, just drop me a few bits of lead" or something. 
---
I was kind of tempted to just leave but I did drop him all the mats I had on me (I was way overloaded lol). I hope he got it all back to his camp
---
There only 2 possible outcome atoms shop or dlc endgame rewards
---
That would also be better.
---
I get the same crashes. Usually only happens when I'm doing something on the background like listening to a video on YouTube or something.
---
Thank you! I have news as well, a Beth's CM replied on a post that mention the same issue.
---
I hope this gets fixed soon. Good luck my friend :)
---
Not really I’m at a point in the game that if I need a specific scrap I’ll farm that one.. 
---
Right now stacking up on lead and steel so I have a lead route plus workshop rotation
---
This no longer work, it worked when failures report atoms
---
It's always that level range of players that get cocky with trting to start shit in my experience
---
Side note this only seems to happen when I apply any paint job to the power armor that I have unlocked the recipe for.
---
Yes. That extra HP is needed especially when you are bloodied. And if you have Healing factor mutation + speed demon, you’ll have health regeneration. So, that when you do take damage you can survive it.
---
Don’t really know how to explain it. If your life giver is maxed out, then you’ll always get back those 45 HP. Let’s say you add items that give HP, then you’ll regenerate whatever that’s higher. Like, if an item that you consume gives u 70 HP, then you’ll regenerate 70HP once you have LIFE GIVER perk equipped and have Speed Demon Mutation active. [you will regenerate those numbers while fighting FYI, so while in combat you are getting health] that’s how you almost never die, if you fight back.
---
Helvetia is my go to for junk farming! My first camp build was right on the edge of town so I would do a daily run through to collect everything and kill quite a few low leveled scorched along the way. Now I just go out of habit as well as it just being so easy to kill everything so fast.
---
What happens if you try to put that paint on a new piece/chassis?
---
On....?
---
yeah, dropping 30 fusion cores is a MASSIVE weight reduction. along with missiles and crap. man i really wish rocket launchers and fatmans were wayyyyy stronger so they were actually viable. but the meta is just like BLOODY HIGH FIRE RATE NOTHING ELSE. and i get sad :c my character is an all rounder. i don't want to put myself into specializing one thing. i want to be able to pick up a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun, etc and do about the same damage with either one. much more fun and unique. today i just got an instigating weightless bash damage fatman. you bet your ass imma use it.
---
You may have a corrupt system file try SFC /scannow from an elevated command prompt. Then try manually updating windows. If all else fails download the Windows update assistant from Microsoft and run that. Gets me and my team at work out of many a jam. Good luck I know troubleshooting this can be difficult, however most of the time it is currupt sound drivers, due to a screwed up update and the above should help.
---
Sorry mate just competed it
---
Since PvP is not triggered, you can only destroy it by exploiting and thus opening yourself to being reported.
---
While reports are seemingly ignored, would you really chance it?
---
You should monitor your CPU and GPU temperatures when running the game. Also, try running the game in windowed mode to be able to check your CPU % usage while running it. (just remember to set the game back to fullscreen once you're done) Also, check if you have enough RAM for it to run.
---
What you're experiencing does look like it's hardware related. What are your specs and your average FPS?
---
Radium rifle is Super weak!
---
Wake up guys. Almost every mutant and freak you meet in the wasteland has High Radiation Resistance. So the trademark radiation damage is weak!
---
Any gun that's in your build and a prime receiver makes it better. Usually flux is sold for 50-100
---
Tranquility lane was alot smaller with fewer people. Nobody really had the tech for that kind of simulation when the bombs fell. Though I guess it would make more sence to be a simulation of the past that was set up far in the future, since the programmers have knowledge of all these creatures and "secret" organizations. Deffinately not a vault-tec product though.  
---
Personally, I think it's the universe all messed up and bubbling into extra dimensions to form pockets in time. There's all kind of this mysterious Ultracite in the ground, and the Interloper is definitely very present, possibly from an extradimensional origin, scratching at a place in our "universe" that's a little messier than other places. Really doubt that's the cannon case, but it's kind of a fun mental gymnastics to explain server hopping or how there are people from vault 76 you've never seen before, or why the queen doesn't stay dead, how people appear and dissapear etc.
---
quad cryo.
---
I always thought you could just outright shoot up someones camp. Shows how much I PVP I guess. :P
---
Now that you mentioned it, yup it does sound like her
---
You are my hero. This is very cool
---
Yes, I would 100% love to see some more options for growing plants. Let me grow cranberries and tarberries in the water, domesticate wild plants, and just some plain old new varieties.
---
Wow. I really like this. Didn’t know you could build there.
---
All for it.
---
I couldn't imagine them playing the MMO I started in back in 2003.
---
 It took months and months to level up a couple classes to Max level. Then you could could change your class to a hybred and it would take many more months to lvl up.
---
 Kids these days would go ballistic. I'm honestly getting fed up with the gimme gimme gimme now now now last couple generations of kids.
---
I can't edit it in the power armor station
---
I'm not sure if were having the same issue or not but i purchased the Red Rocket garage about 5 days ago with challenge atoms and ever since then i have not earned one single freakin atom. I've heard about the auto-complete issue but i don't think thats my problem because its telling me i completed the challenge and giving me the ding text for 10 or 20 atoms but nothing :( ive already sent 3 tickets in and as player who refuses to spend any extra money on this game it really feels like a kick in the gut might have to give this game up!
---
Also same glitch
---
Totally. Crops take up budget so I don’t see it as being to much. Not everyone is into growing food. And maybe not all plants. But certainly more. We see others have cultivated more food plants.
---
Just to have room action boy + dodgey. Those two are great combo if ur running a no pa bloodied build. If you stack ap refresh (well tuned, well hydrated, food) you can have a pretty effective shield against a good chunk of damage and together with lone wanderer you can tank hits pretty effectively, just gotta pay attention to ur health. If ur in a group tho just run a pa build with ep an ull literally never die, and u can keep the adrenaline. I kinda like the no pa variant tho, makes you work a little harder
---
The paintings on top of West Tek are pretty cool
---
so? pistols?
---
If you save your weeklys for double score you might have a chance
---
Really? Damm
---
The word is *scrip*, not *script*.
---
I'm a full health build w/ vampire power fist that I love. I cannot for the life of me craft a piece of Vanguard SS. You have my empathy, friend.
---
I dont really like soloing that one, too much running around. Its nice that they guarantee legendaries though
---
 Even if it was 400 percent I don't think that it would be any good
---
They’re planning on adding addition bonuses/rewards for fallout first member possibly from next season. I would assume there will be a few additional cosmetic rewards but I’m going to guess it will mostly be things like additional perk packs and lunch boxes ect.
---
Failing the event is more rewarding than completing it, so that alone should probably be ringing alarm bells at Bethesda and be cause for a rework of the event.
---
I've never once beaten it, at least not "successfully". NPC lady keeps saying at the end that the operation is a failure, but I don't see it that way. We all come away with more loot and XP than we could ever dream of.
---
Oh poor sweet child. No.
---
The only thing you need to worry about is how much 700 fusion cores weigh.
---
As far as I know the glitch seems to only occur when you play NW, make sure you finish all your other challenges before you load into that.
---
Well if it was dropped, that’s fair game I suppose. And no you won’t catch a ban for having 700 fusion cores.
---
There is a player on Xbox that I've encountered in a server a few times over the year that is one of the nastiest toxic people I've ever heard in a game. Yelling, screaming, cussing, calling people f**g*t. He was yelling at people to get out of his tent. Berating someone for being in excavator PA. I've reported him twice over the year for screaming f**g*t. Not posting his GT, for obvious reasons.
---
Prioritize heavy stuff.  My last week of script I got rid of heavy junk and now I have 200 lbs free on stash and almost 300 on me
---
I taught a friend of mine a lot and now she went and ran a silo solo... something I haven’t done! The student became the master.
---
More than likely they were a dupe. You shouldn’t worry though. The bans are, primarily, for weapon dupes. 
---
Enjoy them and welcome to the Power Core Hoarders Club!
---
Yeah. I went from like 190/345 carry weight to like 560 and had to waddle my way to my stash.
---
I make them for free if I see someone bought one. Shit I don't care
---
Thanks. Even if I was an involuntary member
---
*waves hand* you never seen this happen. 🤫
---
I'm still trying to figure out how to predicably create the conditions for this.
---
You’re a member because your keeping them. It’s a slippery slope...
---
Ah ok. Just didn’t want to be banned because I have an obscene (to me) amount of F. Cores.
---
Not wanna be an asshat here, but that is one of the reason why you usually use the trading menu
---
I assume I won’t have to worry about PA using them all for awhile? Especially if I get the 2x longer perk?
---
There is a two week gap between seasons, I’m going to assume this is incase they need to extend seasons ever so slightly. Also they will have events running for those two weeks but I don’t see why they couldn’t do both, besides the fact if the event gives out a lot of XP.
---
I've killed and helped killed hundreds of SBQs and still haven't killed one according to the atom challenges.
---
I can definitely help you carry some if you feel like dropping some on PS4 lol
---
I can confirm that they are going to your Beth wallet. Just checked and those atoms are there.
---
I meant sneak multipliers, sure.
---
Not for a long time. Get a Gatling laser and go crazy!
---
I went with another test. This time on scorchbeasts and i also found a sheepsquatch, on the sheepsquatch the Furious won from AA.
---
Two shot 85 up close, headshot.
---
AA went up to 110 then somehow got to 164. 
---
Furious went up to 225
---
Those are the results on the scorchbeasts.
---
Just sell some for a really fair price and lighten your load a bit, you'll never need that many lol.
---
Recently i was in a public team, my teammate is pressing the help me emote alot. So i go to my map and see that he is in a silo so i decide to answer his call and go to help him. When i get there he is spamming angry face and thumbs down emote. I am a bit confused but keep pushing forward. As i get to The launch prep session i he starts sending angry messages to me calling me all sort of nasty things telling me to get out. Lets just say i switched teams.
---
Inside Overseer's House are at least 8 and they respawn every 20 hours
---
Yeah I know but he way he went about it honestly felt like he genuinely wanted to use it. If it were Worth more I would have.
---
With this many I can probably sell them for like 5-10c each? Or maybe less.
---
I think the only angry message I've received on this game was a couple of days ago.  Someone was angry that I killed a Legendary Mirelurk Queen before they got a single shot in.
---
But (1) I'd looked around for someone else before finishing her off and didn't see anyone and (2) it's not like I one-shot her.  I even had to reload my clip, so she had the time to regenerate before she went down.
---
When he messaged me and called me selfish, I apologized and said I hadn't seen him.  I felt bad.  I *did* look for someone else.  I felt like I must not have looked hard enough.  I honestly would've given him the legendary I got from the queen.  I'm a Level 380+ so it's not a big deal.  But he kept coming back with the salt a couple of times even though I'd said sorry.  So F 'em.  He gets nothing.  If it happened to a jerk like that, I'm glad.  Would've hated to accidentally screw over a decent person.
---
Great, thanks for checking this!
---
I would like a scrip machine, vending machine, gold bullion machine and a personal smiley at my camp
---
God no and I hope it never does.
---
I’m on Xbox and I’ll happily play with the PS community but keep the PC hackers away thanks.
---
Just don't sell too many at once for too low a price or someone is bound to come buy them all up to resell. I don't buy fusion cores so maybe someone else can chime in but I think even 40-50 caps would be cheap.
---
Especially if you dump more than your fair share of ammo into it
---
Think that's my main reasoning
---
Look up Captainoob and Angry Turtle on Youtube. Don’t listen to these jerks who never even shot a nuke or solo SBQ.
---
I'm using the raider skin and it won't apply even after dropping my camp new multiple times.
---
I like radroaches. They're like the honey badger of the wastelands, they'll take on anything with zero fucks given.
---
Why \_not\_ get a cut? We've used some of our camp budget to install it. We've made space for it. Why not get a small cut? Adds to the incentive to set it up.
---
I've edited the OP with my specs. I will try to monitor my temperatures while I'm running the game, but I don't think it's overheating,  the internal temperature of the case has varied when these crashes occur, and it's not shutting down, it stays on but there is obviously some sort of failure.
---
It also doesn't just do this during intense moments, I have been doing nothing and clicked something in a crafting menu - and it's gone, same with clicking to fast travel, and loading through doors.
---
My average FPS according to the Radeon software is 50, I've gotten this higher when I've reduced object and item fade, as well as resolution just to test. I can improve performance but it doesn't really perform poorly, it just crashes like this out of nowhere.
---
I haven't bought anything in awhile and I do still get atoms for certain things so no probably not (and the auto complete issue is for s.c.o.r.e not atoms) hopefully you can get the help you need
---
Thanks itbwqs a real challenge to get everything to line up just right.
---
As others have mentioned you can go in with a fresh character and get it done in one 15 minute match. It's not as time consuming as you are making it out to be. If you're choosing to do something the hardest way possible then you can't really blame anyone but yourself.
---
Tldr: you're making things harder than they really are.
---
Locked behind a massive grind of Foundation daily’s
---
I'm not sure of the exact spot but if someone places there camp or survival tent in a certain spot it causes this to happen
---
Hahaha actually though lol
---
True. I want to make some caps on them (even if they were free for me) because I’m still a low level and I am still getting plans for things. But I don’t want to feel like I’m charging too much so maybe like 40c a piece. 
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Somebody called me that the other day in Uranium fever,  even though I was using a plain 10mm pistol to tag the legendaries.
---
Hmm. Didn't think about that. I might try to do it solo when I  get the chance to play it again.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Yeah it sucks when that happens. But when all is said, lesson learned, better on a smaller item now than on a more expensive item later :( Don't worry you'll bounce back :)
---
It's not about avoiding pvp. Pacifist in adventure does that just fine. It's about guaranteeing all the good farming xp locations are full of enemies and unchallenged for. Your camp always places. Every legendary in the world belongs to only you. Every event is yours to complete without a bunch of either A. low levels who don't know how to run the event and mess it up for everyone or B. level 500s who leap up out of danger  using serums and one shot every legendary before anyone else gets it.
---
That stuff alone makes Fallout 1st worth the money. Add in unlimited scrap storage, an extra free fast travel location in the form of the survival tent, a heap of free atoms to spend every month etc...it pays for itself imo.
---
Thank you for the suggestion, I've run that and it did actually manage to find corrupt files. If this is the fix I will be very grateful!
---
I wasn't sure what to expect with this post but the suggestions have come in quickly and been very useful.
---
EDIT: The corrupted windows files were not the issue, I am still getting that crash.
---
I played for a year and a half without figuring that out. 🤦‍♂️
---
Sure you can do that but it's an unnecessary step. Shouldn't require a new character to do a daily.
---
Yeah but the only problem is that If I open a 5th lunchbox, it resets the XP bonus. So ppl are very carefull that they might mess up someone else's lunchbox XP.
---
Well, it'd be an interesting experiment: a locked door that can be opened by putting money in. Would people actually pay for access in any big way? My guess is Probably Not.
---
It has to do with either having a person, or more commonly placing a TENT, in a specific spot in front of the asylum fence.  I'm pretty sure once you find a position that works, it will always work.
---
So did he get the item from you? I’m a little confused here
---
I got scammed the exact same way went to his base and saw plenty of neon signs saying “nazis are cool” 
---
His base was shaped like a UFO and on the front it was called “nazi spy ship”
---
You’ll meet plenty of these fucks in the wastelands, don’t take it to hard just a reminder not everyone who plays in this game is a nice lad , but some are just huge cunts.
---
It equals a 2* weapon because it has no value
---
Same here, had a character that knew the shielded raider underarmor back in 2019....now, he cant.  I thought I was crazy but now, seems like im not.
---
I've heard rumors that once you buy over 10k atoms and a years fallout 1st membership Todd himself personally unlocks those challanges so you can complete them /s
---
The deathclaw. Mostly because of how scary they were in 3. I remember the first time I ever saw one I was walking along doing my thing by the republic of Dave minding my own business I turned around and clicked vats a few times to make sure nothing was following me and nothing so i turned back around and kept walking. Literally five seconds later I heard something so I turned around again and there he was The big hulking bastard was just standing 2 feet away just staring for a second...then he lunged at me and I was dead. Made me jump I think my head hit the ceiling it scared me so bad. And that is my favorite fallout story of all time! Had a buddy with me and he remembers it to this day too lol
---
Primed Gatling laser, primed Gatling plasma, primed laser rifle and primer plasma rifle have working well for me, Gatling plasma works the best for me
---
I think the fog crawlers are kind of cute. They look all terrifying but they just bumble around together and sometimes run away in the opposite direction from you if you bump into them.
---
Being (Fallout) wealthy enough to help others is the greatest feeling in the world for me.
---
Started last week now level 308. Been doing West tek runs all weekend
---
Ya he got it. He got a gun I got a water lol
---
Run through Lucky Hole mine wirh excavator power armor for lead.  Also, as a former stealth commando, steel was always my issue because it takes much more steel to make ammo.
---
That sucks. But if you grief him that gives him grounds to report you and cause you trouble.
---
I’ve been doing this for the daily. I’ll find the first low level vendor that isn’t selling hundreds of mounted heads and buy some things at random and drop it wherever their stash box is
---

---
it needs a bit tweaking sometimes. If first wave spawns normally i go out and move the tent a feet. And if second is also normal i adjust again. Sometimes you just cannot get it to work though
---
I like all of the cryptid and would love to know how each of them was created, what animal(s) they originated from, and how they escaped or were let out.
---
What are you on about it just doesn’t spawn your camp in and when you change servers if that location is free your camp loads in fine.
---
I wouldn't bother with that whole revenge plan you have there. Yeah they guy was a jerk, but you're gonna cause more stress for yourself than it's worth.
---
Plus the scammer might end up reporting you for harassment and you'll be the one getting banned from the game.
---
It sounds like you lost a legendary that you weren't even using anyway. You'll get another one.
---
I'm a PC player and I agree with this sentiment. The console ecosystem is much less strained by these bad actors. We envy you.
---
At this point they might as well let us trade it like any other armor too. They tried to keep exploiting at bay but rumor has it exploiters still found a way around it.
---
No... There's many other guns, which is worse than handmade/fixer. Radium can't be better, just medium quality.
---
It's always been a brutal discussion/debate about how caps aren't the ideal currency because imagine how big a bag of them clanking and clunking around would be.
---
Then there was suggestion that different types of caps might be worth different amounts
---
No, more xp, more carryweight, better accuracy in vats, better crits, better prices, better ap regen anyways what do yall want from mcdonalds
---
Yeah the deathclaw is easily on my top 5. They were definitely tougher back in 3 and new vegas.
---
Yeah especially the Grafton monster
---
Spoilers: It doesn't.
---
Yeah I think their design was well made and very creative. Easily in my top 10
---
You can, it's in options somewhere - gameplay tab I think? Public Team notifications. Turn it off. You'll still get the first one when you log in to a world to say there are teams available, but otherwise they disappear.
---
Thanks for this information.
---
Same. I know the snallygaster and grafton monster are both results of West Tek FEV experiments but not sure abt the others
---
Line in the Sand is a bit different I think.   If everyone is running around tagging things get fucky and you get mobbed.  There’s enough scorched for everyone to get lots of XP without putting too much thought into it.  So yeah, I’m the guy on the pillar one shorting scorched with a plasma caster.   I never noticed anyone paying attention to me bc they were to busy rolling with their gat plasmas and miniguns.   And the sb just need to die fast they fuck everything up in that event.  Am I wrong?
---
It forces all the enemy to spawn at one location....like shootin fish in a barrel
---
Why can’t it be better or on an even level? The plans are one of the hardest to get in the game, and like the fixer it fits a different roll than both the fixer and the handmade. It seems very ridiculous that you have to put as much work into getting the plans for it just for it to not be viable in the meta.
---
Omg this is awesome, ive been crafting gauss miniguns and ran out of screws
---
Papa Johns
---
KK
---
Extra STR can be used with Barbarian to get extra DR regardless of your build. So if you had 5 pieces of Unyielding, just getting +1 from each and a 3\* Barbarian gets you +20 DR
---
INT will get you extra XP, so again, the 5 piece example above is +10% XP gained. 
---
AGI not only increases your APs, but you also can use Evasive (which is similar to Barbarian) and get DR/ER per point of AGI.  And since you’ll have a bigger AP pool, you can even combine it with Dodgy to reduce some of the damage.  
---
So there are some other advantages to it.
---
Yeah I didn’t realize PA and Gauss weapons need a ton of screws.
---
Max strength, deep pockets, unyielding, and a high capacity backpack. I only get 300 at most on my max STR PA build, 400 with the excavator (both with calibrated shocks). Even my pistol build gets like 350 with 1 str, but otherwise the same setup as the melee build.
---
And that's not including the weight reduction effects on each piece of armor, which you don't get in PA.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Morgan town has a whole fantastic story on its rooftops told in diary entries and such.
---
Its worth exploring everything you can up high you never know where you'll find secret cool stuff!
---
Sadly theres nothing on the roofs of whitesprings though.
---
You find it but me and my friend have this glitch where unused power armor can sometimes be completely invisible.
---
Lots of new players
---
Dont forget the pie :)
---
Plan out your build , don’t wait til lvl50 to start planning it cuz it ganna cost you a lot of lvls 
---
Always rest and do public events 
---
Set up player vendor as soon as possible and sell the extra ammo @ 1cap , they normally sell fast
---
Just need some artillery cannons so you can scare the ship out of passerbys. =P
---
Cryolator
---
I do this but with the stove appliance inside of diners :D
---
It's gotten tricky to place, but still works with patience.
---
I know me either, im such hoarder that i havent needed to even look at my scrap levels. Then i started trying to get Gauss rolls and i was like well Fuck
---
I would wait....hear there is a banhammer coming cause of it.....
---
Yeah, you need to find the nuke briefcase and 4 nuke codes. There's a 9 point perk to highlight nearby cases on the Hud. You can get codes in some crates, and as loot from most animals.
---
I managed to launch my first nuke this week!
---
Edit: autocorrect error
---
Yeah I know I shouldn't get to crazy with it lol hell I would have given it to him if he were a lower level. I'm level 175 and am swimming in legendarys at this point just can't understand why someone higher than me would need to scam someone out of a weapon that really isn't even popular or that useful.
---
What a shelf-ish person.
---
I guess I'm looking for the bigger one. Wasn't even aware there was a larger backpack. I thought mods were the only way to increase size. Thank you.
---
Wow that's exciting 😑
---
Oh damn!
---
You need to do more than 1k dmg to the Queen to get the rewards.
---
I hoard ammo and stuff but junk is hard since it’s like oh I have X amount of screws that means I can finally build my Gauss weapon or Power Armor then I’m back at 0. So I’m in a constant state of farming Hahahaha.
---
Trap camps are fun, adds a little spice to the Wasteland.
---
At whitesprings.
---
Unless you’re on xbox with the influx of Gamepass players, probably seeing the current fallout(pun not intended) of the lost recent ban-wave
---
You should go on a crime spree and start blowing up peoples bases
---
Im a bloodied build I use a prime be minigun but i also stack chems and food for better damage! I drop a nuke to trigger SBQ event once a day! But yeah depending on your build its best to reseach what weapon works to your advantage.
---
Which whitespring bunker terminals are you thinking of?  
---
The cult comes off more as meta-humour than as a clue.Though it could be a clue disguised as meta-humor??
---
That is untrue.
---
I have a full set of 3 star unyielding SS armor except for the right leg. FML. 
---
THEY SEE ME ROLLING!
---
I got the legendary and xp on a new character but no repair kits or flux? Anyone know why
---
Widgeontv on youtube or something like that should have videos of the cryptids lores and a bunch of other stuff
---
Thats fallout, its a farming simulator at its core haha
---
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta bump them up. But yeah the RNG giveth and they taketh away sometimes. My character can't even offload all the chest pieces 8ve been trying to roll
---
Looking at your specs, I guess it's not the issue. I have a 8 yo radeon HD 7950 and half your ram and I just never crash ... had to heavily tweak down the graphics through the ini files, of course.
---
At which temp is your gpu when running the game? Is your game crashing randomly or does it happen more in some areas of the game?
---
I know I watschend a YouTube video and the guy had like 16k of screws and other junk (he was level 326 or something) and I was just like how?
---
Auto plasma pistol is a pretty solid weapon. The .45 and 10mm smgs are much closer to rifles than pistols, they should keep the perks they have now though. Unless they decide to make another perk for literally 2 weapons
---
Same here, three of my camps don't have a skin because there was no way in hell I was going to rebuild them. I had to rebuild the other two, so they do have skins.
---
Try to sell every core (fusion or plasma) for a max of 50. If they’re depleted, divide the power left by 2 and sell them for that many caps
---
Prime ultracite Gatling laser for me. I'm not a heavy build but it does enough damage to notice on her and enough that I get to loot her in the end. But I sure don't think it would take her down by myself though.
---
You would think a stove could be used to cook on with out having to add stuff to it lmao, that’s awesome you got that work around though
---
Oh well it's probably the massive ban wave and the influx of new players that are still learning the game
---
This is amazing!  Huzzah!
---
What serums?
---
Opossum - makes a nice hat (not joking, opossum hat is an actual apparel piece)
---
to be fair, if someone is downed but not dead, the game automatically sends "help me" at least once. he may not have actually been asking for help.
---
still, seems he needed the help, and he didnt have to get angry that someone on his team came to give it. that's what the teams are for- to get people to play together. the bonus is just, well, a bonus.
---
Please do this so I can report you as well. 
---
Don't ruin events for legitimate players by being an exploiting fucktard.
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the info. (I have like ~730 fully charged cores) so that’s why I was thinking less to help newer players (or people who like bargains) and still get a bit of caps out of it but I’m happy to know what the average/courtesy limit is.
---
Oh absolutely, especially during Fasnacht, after the event would finish I would go around all the buildings and collect all the scrap. It usually took long enough for the next event to start!
---
Honestly, I would stick close to the forest (green zone) region to start. Won’t get nuked and it’s nice and easy to learn the camp building ropes. As you progress in the game you’ll likely start looking for a permanent settlement. Don’t rush it. Try a few spots out first. Keep an eye out for things like a view, good water source, whether there’s a good resource to farm, do the mobs spawn too much?, do other players use it also and your constantly getting the “your camp cannot be placed” shenanigans. 
---
I would recommend starting at the south end of the map and just walking north with an eye for camp locations. Mine is located in the savage divide (because it’s centrally located) but I walked pretty much the entire divide for juuuuust the right spot. 
---
I guess my point is, don’t rush it and think you need the perfect base and location right away. It’s a process.
---
Damage in PvP capped at 110 if i remember well, so no point with Fatman, unless they are bloodied
---
Please no, allow a few events to have some challenge to them.
---
XP/loot from the queen kill or the event itself ?
---
Yes. The "skin" it has is lame and/or ugly by most peoples' standards. If it has the same model and animations as the combat rifle, why NOT have the skin be changeable?
---
I have a private server.
---
And it's a real lofe thing too. Wonder if the three heads fight amongst eachother though....
---
Individually the buffs are okay, but altogether they make you a demigod. The agility buffs alone are almost as good as a full set of chameleon's, but then you get nearly infinite AP, more carry weight/melee damage, better vats crits/accuracy, 30% more exp...it's stupid how bethesda still allows just one clearly optimal choice, pretty much every other effect needs a buff in comparison
---
Get perk to repair 200%
---
this. my camp is right next to foundation so bullion isnt a problem for me, but i always end up holding legendaries until i decide to go scrip them at the Rustt Pick itself to get some legendary modules. putting a scrip machine at the faction HQs would be really nice.
---
Banning is very unlikely as its using standard game mechanics. Far more likley is a workaround such as extending the 'no camping' zone along the roadway.
---
Doesn't make it right. Hopefully Bethesda has tools in place to catch people doing that.
---
 After that recent ban wave I don't understand how people can still be so blatantly stupid.
---
Speed demon doesn't proc for sneaking movement. If it's supposed to then it's broken as I've tested that several times.
---
That's exactly the reason. Plus at this point ALL weapons should have at least ONE skin. Keeps them from being accidentally put into scrip.
---
I use my private world to grind out the daily and weekly challenges (especially kill a legendary) bc people who have done that event already usually go to it and complete it or they one shot everything, personally I’ll switch over to a lower level weapon so I don’t instantly kill the enemy so other people can get a hit on it. Besides that it’s good for claiming workshops so you don’t have to fight someone for it and also for getting loads of scrap.
---
Most likely the servers on Xbox are diluted with new gamepass players.
---
 They have also disappeared, I have to contact the support of bethesda, not only on the web, also if possible on twitter-facebook in official support accounts. Be nice, post screenshots of the challenges, specify the ones you have completed and they will return the lost atoms.
---
General rule of thumb is to completely ignore the “value” of the item in its data card because that only applies to buying them at non player vendors. Ammo apart from cores and Ultracite is worth 1c, Ultracite 2 or 3. Any non rare apparel is worth like 10 caps, non legendary weapons 1/10 of what their value trait says.
---
If you choose the raider dialogue option, the thief lives, and you gain raider rep. Screw Ward.
---
In this case the two shot for sure. But get ready to repair it a lot. :-)
---
Well, you wouldn't have to give your stims or ammo to the scavengers you know!
---
Just like you don't have to shut down the mainframe at project paradise, or repair the SAM turret at line in the sand.
---
I just think there should be more rpg options, rather than it always being brute force.
---
Same. But I settled with building by the western most river. Out away from others and easy to get to on foot. Also if you find the right spot it gives a great view.
---
I bought some marsupials for cheap on PS4. What do you need ?
---
Not sure. Normally, he rarely shows up. I've been graced with it's presence 3 times in the last two days.
---
What was it
---
I can got 1 I’m not going to try to spell it since I’ll spell it wrong but it’s the one that makes you jump high
---
Lol wtf, wish i had that kind of dedication
---
I used/spent 90 modules resulting in 2 unyeilding pieces. One of which was actually quite good. Now i'm saving up for the next limb.
---
You can learn about the grafton monster in west tek
---
I'm saving mine for after the xp weekend is gone. Even without opening them I've gone up like 20 levels the past few days and easily made up for any score completion bugs that have happened. So I'll use them either when I get closer to the end of the board or for the double score weekend if that happens.
---
[Spoilers Duh] Personally I really love that little mirelurk with the red glow from fallout 4's far harbor dlc ya know that one you have to go kill on the mariners querst
---
Were you the one that kept falling in my death pit?  After the 4th time I thought you'd figure it out.   You can still access my vendor's, just watch your step
---
Explosive bait.
---
Oh? I have never been there. I assume it's in a terminal right? If so where can I find it?
---
Friendly fire perk and shishkebab are my top choice on those events with any type of npc that can die and make the event fail (radiation rumble, project paradise, free range, riding shotgun, fasnacht...)
---
Do you have the future tec camp skin on your camp thing?
---
It's been happening to me a bit more recently.
---
I found my laptop was overheating when playing the game and it would lag and crash often.
---
A cooler helped me.
---
Gawd! 6 hours!! I’m jelly..I live on a little Island west coast Canada, it took me 52 hours to download it on Xbox...
---
You have to deal at least 1k damage to it to get the rewards
---
If this is the military camp with the three kids then the answer is Jimmy that commie bastard Jimmy and his commie teacher
---
What? What do you mean?
---
Are you using the new skin for the CAMP you get from the legendary run? It apparently causes you to lose the icon.
---
I would have bough some of them, but double oh, they are not trade-able and it's different platform =\
---
It won't let you loot the Queen if you don't do 1000 or 1500 damage, I can't remember which one it is.
---
Anti armor 25 faster fire rate 15 faster reloading submachine gun Max level
---
Two shot, but the anti armor is also ok if you want to attempt a stealth heavy build
---
Yeah but there's also the bloodrage mirelurks which have the same design. But there's just something abt smaller things that make them cuter
---
Second
---
It’s a bug
---
It is even on the Guerrilla perk cards..
---
Hmmm, good to know. Sorry man.
---
Found the entries in a terminal while doing a quest. Goes through the experiments and one comes out strong and too large for its chamber without a head. Snally is listed too. I cant explain where, but shouldnt be too difficult to find it.
---
... and lower its AP/shot cost.
---
Ikr I love that little mirelurk i would die for him, I got a mod that made him into a follower so now he follows me around the commonwealth sharing his red glow with everyone
---
Marsupial
---
Ah well this recent attemp i know i did because when i approached the queen i could see the stuff in the loot menu right before it disappeared
---
I thought it was pretty OP in 3 and NV.
---
It did make more sense than me crafting parts from steel and duct tape.
---
Yeah. I think my vendor is pretty cheap. Nothing I sell is usually over 75c. If I don’t want to turn a legendary into script but need room I’ll sell like a 2* scout armor for like 15-20c. I think the only thing I’m selling that is at 75c are some Ultracite PA mods (like calibrated shocks) I sold (I only had 2) fixer plans for 80c though.
---
Look up Angry Turtle's guide. It shows the AP usage of all stock etc variants. I have an Instigating. It's lethal and also seem to never take damage.
---
(FO1st member) Every time my atoms drop each month I tell myself I won’t buy anything so I can save up my atoms. Every time the atomic shop refreshes there’s something I instantly buy.
---
I had similar slow speed in my previous town. I needed three days to download Red Dead Redemption 2. :(
---
Yes. I´ll remove it and get back to you to confirm.
---
Thanks I would’ve definitely spelled it wrong
---
Hmmm nice piece but I don’t know why he can’t just buy it. 5k is def fair
---
Great PSA that saved a lot of headache for folks.  Thank you!
---
Oh yeah - all of them.
---
No. I am on Xbox. 
---
I finally figured out the landing and viewing rules.  When I am setting up the camp make sure what is northeast of me is nice and then I make sure to be looking southwest when I place the camp unit the first time.
---
It works out great and then I can make my camp look nice from the second people land.
---
You always spawn NE of the camp unit which you can move after the camp is placed to fine tune the landing spot.  You also spawn in looking whichever way your toon was looking when the camp unit was placed.
---
Are you still looking, and on ps4?
---
Heheheh
---
I couldn't imagine the 10mm sub getting an extra 60% buff from pistol cards... my bffr hits near 300 dmg as it is, that would put it over 400
---
Agreed. I'm a sneak character and most of the time when I'm trying to play, a big pop up appears for Scorched Earth or another event I'm not involved in. Obscuring my view of my hidden/detection meter. Half the time when it vanishes, I'm detected and getting chased without knowing until the music changes to combat.
---
Stick this crap to the side.
---
Not sure if it's a glitch but mine has remained at 200% condition permanently, and I've used it constantly for months. Anyone else?
---
Don't get me wrong. I have no problems with supplies I was just thinking abt all the ppl who don't use gun nut and automatic weapons. I like to hear ppls feedback when I make these. Try to see what the community does and doesn't like
---
Near Clancy manor, on the hillside there’s this really gorgeous spot that’s completely flat minus a rock wall. I had my camp there for some time but ultimately moved away when I needed to start selling things again.
---
Wow, it's almost like messages like these are the ones making them not engage in reddits and other forms of community.
---
If your like me, I don't have a min/maxed meta build and had the same problem. Then I rolled a decent ultracite Gatling lazer. Primed it and use that specifically for her. I dont have any cards for heavy weapons but I always walk away with her loot even if I only use 1 or 2 cores of ammo.
---
Max out all three heavy gunners and demo expert.  Problem solved
---
Plans are a different ball game. As a result of their rarity, fixer plans are worth around 5k. There’s also a website you can use to find the approximate value of a legendary so you and the person buying don’t rip each other off. Also if you don’t want to scrip something I’d suggest making an extra character to hold your extra stuff.
---
Some people have told me once you get the gear and build you want you’ll save more because most junk goes to repairs and not making gear so maybe he had everything he wanted.
---
The gun benefits from heavy weapons, the explosive perk in intelligence and grenadier in perception
---
Edit: if you're willing to use power armor you can use stabilized as well
---
Damn that's cool. Personally my favorite would have to be the megasloth. Just really like it's design and battle style and animations
---
Nah, it's the BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAAAAAAAAAH part.... Even my baby gets upset when he heard it. Scrunched his lil face up lol
---
Why do you need radaway? There is a decontamination arch you can use after each foray into the tunnels. No need to collect all the ore at once.
---
That increases explosive damage?
---
Ya I sell really cheap. I think fed76 said like 8k low end but I wouldn't have ever bought it for that. Put it in there and figured if anyone offered me less I would take it.
---
Grenadier
---
True. I only got the fixer plans because I was carried by my friends and at that time I wasn’t interested in making a lot of caps so I just sold them cheap. Most weapons I script but armor I tend to sell since even 3* is only 24 script.
---
The Flatwoods monster is a Zetan alien and the Mothman is possibly a legitimate cryptid since it existed prewar and was not created by West Tek. Or a mutated moth if you have no sense of wonder. The wendigo is a mutated human cannibal.
---
Dunno if there's any ESO peeps in here, but how much does L50 in F76 (gear cap) seem insignificant to CP160 in ESO.....
---
But congrats OP- now on to 200!!
---
Should be pretty easy to get ahold of a lvl 50 with the recent dupe, but a lvl 40 is just as good. The damage difference is very little
---
Worked for me as well, thanks OP.
---
Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves...
---
Ive seen this often too. Theres no indication from the map its owned (unless Im blind and missing something) but when I get there the workshop itself says its owned. I wanted to do one yesterday quickly just to get the challenge. I actually contemplated messaging the player who supposedly owned it to see if they were done with it but decided it probably wasnt worth the drama or effort either way and just moved on. Theyve done something to how it all works because prior to the patch it was obvious from the map which was free and which were taken. Now it takes a wasted trip to find out
---
Gotta get those legendary perks cards leveled up!
---
I'm in the same boat, havent gotten any I can use. Also have a full set of weightless that I dont use🤦‍♂️
---
Nice, I like it! It has an authentically Brotherhood vibe. Keep up the good work!
---
It's pretty unfortunate that's the case since I'm pretty sure Junk Fences like the ones in Fallout 4 are probably already in the game world, but they'd rather sell them back to us than just adding blueprints, as usual.
---
You’ve never gotten a single piece of unyielding since beta? I call shenanigans.
---
Also most things in your post are inaccurate... two factor authentication is in the game, for example.
---
see, i agreed with you, but im so sick of people accusing anyone who disagrees with someone of being paid by bethesda that i am downvoting you out of spite.
---
Obviously people would expect me to answer with Mothman, because Mothman is my life, my wisdom, my curiousity. But I actually  love the sheepsquatch. His defensive actions and his very appealing appearance really dragged me into loving this creature. Sort of makes me want to follow him and be in a cult of Sheepsquarch! Especially a glowing sheepsquatch or albino sheepsquatch. Squaaaaatch! Also wish the plushie looked more like she sheep squatch all fluffy and spikey would have enjoyed it more.
---
Bird bone
---
Carnivor
---
Healing factor
---
Speed demon
---
Try to keep good gear though. A 3* leggy with a good perk is better than a chance for a good roll at the purveyor
---
I didn’t bother saving sources, so I can not comment with any authority. However, I can offer anecdote. I still get functional use out of grenades against ghouls, mole miners, and mirelurks, so there is still some utility in them. Auto grenade launcher still does work in the Heart of the Swamp event and I keep meaning to bring a fatman along to that event to finally get my badge for killing enough enemies with one. Humanoid scorched and super mutants seem at least somewhat buffed against explosives, but it isn’t as bad as “boss” styled enemies like the SBQ or Sheepsquatches. Direct hit with a nuke, pulse, or plasma grenade with all explosive perks all do less damage to a Sheepsquatch than my AA handmade.
---
Well the guy I was buying it from said it wasn’t duped but honestly everything in this game has been duped there’s nothing you can do if you happen to buy a duped weapon
---
It’s gonna have to be the cut quantum claw (nuka quantum death claw) for me just because of its badass design
---
Yeah I like the mothman and sheepsquatch. The criptids I think are some the best designed creatures in the fallout universe with plenty of well made lore to go with them.
---
Scared off by a $40 price tag?
---
Since I doing a PA heavy build I’ll sell most armor unless it’s good armor with good perks. Like I keep most unyielding from metal and above. But if I get two unyielding metal armors I’ll sell the one with worse perks and keep the better one.
---
This would be a great addition to the V94 seed bank if they ever open that vault again.
---
I wouldn’t even care if they scrap the raids and recycle the location as part of a new farming DLC.
---
I’d be so thrilled to grow cranberries at home.
---
That’s sick, what version are you on PS4, Xbox or Pc
---
No, wrong, you’re thinking about the 10mm pistol
---
Edit: I thought you meant it benefitted from the perk, what ur saying makes sense!
---
Not that I’m aware of.
---
If on ps4 I got 4 free
---
Put yourself in their shoes... what if you went to an event and got no XP because someone was 1-shotting the enemies before you could? Wouldn't you be mad?
---
Yeah the blue patterns makes it seem like it literally has quantum in it's vains. It's a shame it was cut. Don't know why tho. Maybe they decided to replace it with the gatorclaw. Maybe they could add it into 76 with a nuka cola themed event or something
---
Bethesda banned at least 25,000 members of the community for the latest dupe. Funny cause my Facebook feed is still polluted with people selling their duped weapons, presents and aid. Just saw a dude on Xbox who has aat the very least 3mil and most 270mil all aid items and other goodies
---
Edit: salty people
---
Pc :(
---
You aren’t meant to get in that way.  Need to do all of the wastelanders quests.
---
I went to Change Appearance and backed out without doing anything, worked for me
---
You can solo it with an explosive shotgun. Blast the legs off the ghouls but don’t kill them. Should give you enough time get a set of ore. 
---
Or drop some power armor frames to block one of the paths so the ghouls can’t get through. 
---
But I agree with the other comments. I like that there are events that the whole server. You can solo darn near every event out there and making it easier to do that on this.
---
last i heard regarding vault raids was they were reworking them to be, you know, fun. and that 94, 96, and 63 (and whatever vaults they add in the future) will have their own individual raids that will be available on a rotating basis.
---
could be totally wrong though. i read that on the internet, and we all know how speculation and hearsay works online.
---
Don't get it confused. They are engaged over on the PTS forums as they are focusing on the next update. And as much as I'd love for them to have Destiny 2 level of engagement I don't think they have that many community managers.  
---
If we want better community engagement they'd probably need to hire 1 or 2 more community managers exclusively for FO76. Which I'd absolutely love to see a more personal human side to their involvement rather than just responding to a few bugs,questions,etc and posting patch notes.
---
that explains the first movie. now explain the others.
---
I was suggesting it would lose rifle/commando perks and switch to be a pistol, or even better, do something where you could change the stock and if you picked a full stock it would do commando but no stock would be guerilla
---
Cheers, will scrip the other.
---
Oof yes the mega sloth is really cool god imagine being able to ride it
---
Cheers
---
There is a great post from last year here about the bloody pa sbq killer build. I used to get 180 to 200 damage per shot with my body faster fire ultracite .50 without chems. Over the last few updates it's dropped considerably but still has one of the highest DPS I believe. 
---
The other day I did a queen with someone else using some sort of power weapon who was smoking my DPS. I think the queen was glitched because it was feat within 5 min of launch.
---
you were only at risk if you glitched the building budget and your vendor was close to where people spawned in. 
---
So. have you been naughty?
---
You mean like a new character?
---
My strategy is to save them until they fix the 100% equals 0% bug.
---
Very well done!!
---
Yes... But you can't accuse him without evidence.  Can't get evidence without password...
---
Is that what it is?????? Ever since I unlocked it and replaced my camp at a new location it won’t show up. Jesus I thought I was going nuts. 
---
Thank you for figuring this out!
---
I can kill them all easy enough, but I can't collect ore as well as defend the scavengers.
---
If we were able to better say it the scavengers then there would be more chance of completing the event solo, because people never seem to join the event when I'm doing it.
---
I think everyone is seeing bogeymen now that there was another wave of bans. Extending the restricted area makes the most sense.
---
To be fair, crafting stations in power armor would require a new set of animations
---
Righhhhtt
---
Vendors are functioning atleast as well as anything does in a bethesda game and from what I heard the steal from people's inventory thing was only if you used glitches to make your camp budget larger people wo didn't use the glitch should be safe and I think it was fixed anyway
---
I assume this is bait based on the last sentence, but ouch regardless
---
Didn't notice that, but then, I have Medic Pump, Field Surgeon, 3xFirst Aid and at least 100 Stimpaks
---
That's crazy cheap for 2* anything and absurdly cheap for fixer plans. I've been hopping around every camp with lots of plans, and am prepared to pay pretty much anything once I see a fixer plan for sale because I have never seen them. That's all I really want to buy at this point.
---
Applying the animations to a power armor might not look so bad though. Who knows.
---
God this reminds me of when the game first came out. A guy was following me near death claw island and just keeps shooting me. But I ignore and just keep on walking. Then out of no where 3 more guys show up and follow me everywhere. I ended up losing them after about a hour or two. Then I found them later near the mansion of that one quest and I kill both of them and took the junk they had. They left and never bothered me since.
---
Hey, if it takes up barely any weight, might as well use it to burn through mini nukes you pick up in events. I never got one of my scout badges because I haven’t killed enough enemies with a fatman yet.
---
I think it would look super weird. You're like 2x the size in PA lol. You're much taller, your arms are much longer.
---
That’s actually insane wtf
---
Hell yeah all the time, my camp has been behind the post office since since I joined in the last day of the first Fasnacht 1700 hours ago. There’s a ton of scrap there. It’s usually where I went to do the scrap items for screws challenge. Tons of stuff to pick up to go towards the 180 item reset thing.
---
Congrats!  That is definitely an achievement milestone.
---
I just hit 400 today myself.  I was hoping to reach that point before legendary perks arrived and I finally did.
---
I have shit weapons im using a one star bone club (melee build) but i used a gatling lazer and burned through all my cores in the fight just to get nothing thats why i had got irritated
---
The explosive heavy weapons only refer mini nuke launcher, missile launcher, and grenade launchers. So that perk will help your gun. But it can to more damage if you add the demolitions perk to your build. Me and a buddy did some testing when he got an explosive heavy gun. He's mainly a rifle build and I'm a heavy guns/melee build, so he lent me his gun and we looked at it with my perks off and on.
---
Unfortunately you can’t shoot them down or even get them to come out of the inaccessible region on the other side of the river :(
---
Yeah 15 charisma is da wae
---
Do you have the camp at whitesprings on PS4?
---
Someone awhile back recommenced Light Foot so you don’t die at vendor camps saved my life in someone’s pit
---
U may say that but I may have gotten two at most no joke and probs got rid of them before I realized what they were in all honesty, the game has never and still won't let me finish the excavator armor mission. Still don't have a plan for power armor station, listen u guys can down vote all u want lol, ik what I've had to deal with. Ps other characters I have gotten this stuff. But I don't have ten hours a day to be running around trying to find shit. This game was made with no foresight for players that just want to play with friends and not deal with this survival game bull shit. I still don't get why we can't load characters into a squad only without jackasses just to play the game I bought. Not to mention a slew of issues account wide since beta I've been civil for the post part about this but when am I allowed to get mad. I've wrote Bethesda support tickets for all this shit, emails up ying yang. The most I ever get are emails back saying they received it. How many dlc shit downloads later and still nothing. For one my account wont let me play nuclear winter with my new characters...??? How does that work?!?! I mean yay I can use my first but it's made it where I don't want to start a new character proper, nor should I have to. Once again u all ignore me if u want but just remember while y'all having fun with op shit some of us can't even us excavating power armor. SINCE BETA! Also small note but it's always bothered me, my first character on the character selection screen doesn't have a picture anymore and hasn't since I believe right after beta was finished.
---
I usually sell cheap so I can get rid of them if someone looks at my vendor then have to hold onto them for awhile. And I only had two fixer plans and yeah most people sell the actual fixer (for like 10k+)
---
i remember when 76 first came out people joked/speculated that the whole game was a simulation and our character was still inside 76, which was just a copy of 112.
---
i just figured any references to being in a simulation was just a cheeky reference to those theories and nothing more.
---
Nah, never.   Too crowded,  and I don't use punji boards.. and I'm on xbox
---
Amazing, love it :)
---
I’m pretty sure he’s bugged out for me but I also cannot process the passage of time anymore cuz rona.
---
I'm not a member of 1st but permanent workshops and/or way larger camp budgets on a private server. I imagine more people, especially those who basically play for camp building, would be more likely to buy 1st if they could build more.
---
Did any shards go into making it
---
I don’t think so but I’ll always have my intelligence at 8 or 5 since there is a bunch of perks for repairs but I’m not sure there is to reduce cost of junk on making all I know you can reduce the cost in repairs and have extra durability with certain perks and make it were it uses less durability when using the weapon
---
Lone Wanderer can be replaced by the empath mutation and public teams. The empath mutation counts you as your own teammate, so there is no downside. With Class Freak maxed out, you get 17% damage reduction from your own mutation. If another teammate has the empath mutation, you have even more damage reduction. You could run Tenderizer instead for more damage.
---
If you do opt in for teams, get herd mentality to boost your specials. You don’t need another teammate for the benefits; you just need to be on a team.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Joe
---
My thoughts exactly
---
It's not a requirement since it can absolutely be done on your main. It's just easier to make a new one. It's just like how in Adventure mode making a new character and leveling up while fresh out the Vault takes less time than leveling up a high level 9 times out of 10. Should that challenge be changed too?
---
I'd support the argument that NW exp is low, especially the additional exp for kill/downs/nuke launches, but saying the daily challenge should be removed because of it isn't something I can back. It's a bandage over a much larger issue that does absolutely nothing to actually help the real problem.
---
There's a small backpack you get at Morgantown Airport and a Standard Backpack you get from the Tadpole Scout challenge. Both will take mods, the standard gives twice as much carry weight. There is also a High Capacity Mod that gives the most carry weight that reduces defense. The chemist mod can go on either.
---
Yep went in game and it still said I need to purchase it
---
What I use. Love mine, have lots.
---
Still at 42/45 though
---
Tried that a billion times ended up just paying an extra 5
---
Yup, mine has been set to online for months but always says I'm not.
---
FYI if you join a server where your camp cannot be placed, as long as you don’t place your camp again it will be in its original location when you go to a new server.
---
Anyway races would be cool
---
If artillery is too high up, the rounds never actually reach the ground!
---
I'm from around Huntington. Camden park area.  Complete shithole but the game did a good job with making it look like wva
---
Rage actually
---
"It just works"
---
Total, run in and Down stimpacks.
---
It’s more a slow-earned one.
---
I open 1 and eat a squirrel stew for 50%
---
5 minutes total and it only counts full minutes. Just find a bunch of stims and rad-x/away and go stand in the fire.
---
They are getting rid of food/water debuffs this fall... it’s not that hard to just eat and drink a little, but anyway it’s going to be a non issue.
---
Also I never us unyielding armor. It’s just not my thing. I always scrip it.
---
You can change profile photos for any character by going into your photo gallery.
---
I’ll suggest joining a public team based on events and do events with them you get extra xp for it and legendaries will most likely spawn and I think you’ll still get the drop along you’re near your teammate that killed it
---
Related, have you seen how Sentry Bots climb up/down hills? That is so awesome!
---
Lol. I tried to brute force myself in one time when the story glitched.
---
Those turrets ripped me apart. 
---
B did a good job making immortal deaths traps.
---
Lots of online games have experience boosters in their shops though
---
Okay, think I got it now. I have the level 50, 60lbs tadpole backpack with the raider's chemist mod. So that's the best I can do weight wise without switching chemist for high capacity.
---
Well done. Keep em coming. With help from this sub I've worked my solo tint down to 15 min. There are tons of tips and tricks that he'll cut time down. Next thing you know you will be launching multiple a day. Keep the wastelanders glowing
---
Frank Horrigan for sure
---
I did that today. Meant to say hi, did the photo emote. Ended up being a decent photo, and we both had on Deathclaw masks.
---
Hm not for me, i played some NW around 1pm ish, challenges release at 5pm in England atm, and logged into adventure after a few matches, but when i logged in to do my challenges around 6 they just were completed
---
There just needs to be a small notification in the corner and also a notification section in the menu. Half the time an event ends I don't even see what I get while fighting the remaining mobs of an event.
---
Very nice. Please tell me you have an artillery set up to a lever to blast away those rabscallions. But only if fired upon.
---
Damn. Sorry friend. Girl I just talked to said besides killing and looting said she found a few in locker room at whitesprings golf club. In steamer trunk by the windigo. But could be anywhere. All said they disappear from her vendor recently, from new glitch. Hope this helps.
---
Everyone has owned something duped at some point due to it’s frequency and the amount of Vendors you’ve purchased from at some point. So taking the moral high ground if you’ve played 76 is a bit ridiculous.
---
I don’t dupe but I’m not ignorant either.
---
As I recall Max Durability bonus was capped at 20 INT, but I can't find where I seen it. It did look liike that when I was crafting T65
---
Not my absolute favorite but he's a good one can respect why u choose him
---
Patience grasshopper, Get close and shoot her in the face when she lands.
---
I know Bethesda isn’t known for its realism but this is one thing I understand. It’d be pretty difficult to shoot a gun underwater and near impossible to reload without completely breaking the gun
---
That's good to know. 
---
Sadly, the last time I was promted I didn't pay attention and accidentally pressed the button to remove my C.A.M.P. Imo, it should just be automatic and send you a notifcation in that case.
---
Submit a ticket. I see a lot of people posting about this.
---
Yes and depending on how many chems you have on you the high capacity may give you more or less carry weight because chems weigh a lot. I use the chem backpack and haven't looked back. I very rarely will wear the armored one when using a stealth suit but otherwise it's chem only.
---
As negative as people on reddit are I wouldn't want to talk to you all either.
---
I have a really stupid question...how do you craft them as legendary? I feel like I missed something. 😕
---
Check if you change your character
---
You’ll be fine! It’s just the obtuse exploitation’s that they can track that’s being shut down. I break apart all my shit so I can build more stuff into the broken stuff with a flamethrower, thousands do, so stuff like going under the map is fine. It’s not being harmful, it’s being creative!
---
Expert slugger. Master slugger. Whatever that one is that makes you penetrate armor (incisor maybe?)
---
I know that apparently you’re meant to avoid being online during roll over (10-15mins either side to be safe) and avoid playing NW until all your challenges are done. Outside of that I’m not what else can cause it, I lost two weeklys in the first week and worked out why and haven’t lost any other challenges since by following these two rules. Definitely not saying there isn’t other ways for your challenges to bug maybe I’ve just been lucky.
---
In the past on Xbox i had this issue and by deleting the local game data and letting it resync from the cloud I was usually able to get it working again. 
---
It cost me one of the Easter eggs when I forgot and thus the final reward of the bunny set but I would never had worn it lol
---
Cranberry cobbler is an easy food to make. Go north of vault 76 to Anderson farm. There’s like 10 cranberry plants there. When you consume one, it’s a 5% xp buff. 
---
Also, don’t forget to sleep for another 5%.
---
can you actually use them though?
---
I fixed this the way I fixed my stash box overfilling. Making a new character to use for easier challenges that are difficult for higher level characters.
---
Nah every time ive been online during roll over its been perfect, the only 2 times its happened to me i was offline during roll
---
It can go up even more. On the double XP weekend Radiation Rumble started for me while there was also Scorched Earth up, so I could solo it as the other players on the server were distracted by the SBQ.
---
I killed 175 ghouls each worth 1300 XP (with INT/XP buffs and lunchboxes) giving me a total of 227k XP in 10 minutes.
---
Yea, I can.
---
Events are your friend. Make sure you stash your junk because that's all you lose when you die and hit up the events that spawn a lot of enemies. One violent night, line in the sand, uranium fever, heart of the enemy just off the top of my head are good ones. You are prolly going to die but you don't lose much as long as you stash your junk. Get a couple hits on any enemy that has a star above it and you will get a random legendary weapon or armor piece for better gear. Higher level players (in general of course) will help defend and revive you. Help wave you over to get your hits on the legendarys. So if you see someone doing an emote in the middle of chaos it's a good idea to run over and shoot at whatever their aiming at. Make sure your on a building team for higher intelligence. Anything cranberry you can find or make will give you an xp boost.
---
There isn’t a button to remove your camp. You just won’t have a camp placed until you switch servers. Unless you are saying you accidentally placed a new camp? If that’s the case, oh well you live and learn!
---
If we could just bottle that sulfrr water
---
It might not occur until after you log out and back in after you were on during rollover. Have to check with someone who’s had the bug.
---
Any SMG is a rifle sized weapon that uses a pistol caliber cartridge, so I don’t really see how an SMG would fall under guerilla perks.
---
That being said, I’d welcome more pistol options.  I’ve never played a pistol build, but the weapon pool seems small.  The gauss pistol seems BiS for gunslingers, but guerilla could use more options.  10mm is pretty weak and plasma is loud and fragile.
---
I've never had more than 4k caps
---
I’m a max scrip for my higher level character so I hoard my legendary stuff then drop them near lower level players
---
Comparing Non-bloodied/Junkie, Heavy Guns and Rifles,
---
please for the love of some balance, buff the rifles for Non-bloodied/Junkie, they are very bad in comparison...
---
Its weird because ive heard many conflicting causes, from active during roll over, playing NW, my friend said that his gets auto-completed after he loaded atom shop of all things, so who knows? Maybe it just happens at random times for some reason
---
Ongoing bug when you die just as the event completed you get stuck in respawn. It can fix itself after a while though how long can be random. Friend waited 5 minutes, I've waited 2 or 3 and I've heard others taking 10 minutes
---
I played through Skyrim not knowing that you can run
---
SH?
---
Yeah I noticed one of the ones I owned was telling me to buy it again. If you put them down now you’ll be able to have them in your base until you move, once they patch the bug I highly doubt it will remove the once you’ve placed, it just won’t let you use them again I would assume.
---
Lol you're just mad cause you dont know how to do shit. How tf can you play since beta and only have gotten just 2 uny pieces? Lol you've probably only killed 20 legendaries cause you dont know how to farm. How could you possibly not have the PA station plan? Do you not know how to use google? Why are you complaining about mutations they're extremely beneficial to almost every build especially marsupial it's a good thing that they're easy enough to find for most players to have them. sorry for your bugs they're very unfortunate and annoyingly common in bethesda games but most of your problems sound like they're your own fault
---
Full T65 and now working on mods so far just have the carry +50
---
I think it's a mixed bag..   
---
I've met some cool new players and have happily gifted them tons of level appropriate meds, gear, and weapons.
---
I also try to always practice good behavior by emoting hello at people, buying items I dont really need at well done or cool designed CAMPS, tagging legendaries and calling everyone over to get a hit at group events, and doing the lame stuff like herding brahmin, collecting uranium, and even become the conduit (and actually stay alive spamming stimpacks while hiding in a shed) to let lower levels do the fun stuff.
---
But, before wastlanders came, did the quest just end ubruptly like that? I never did the quest so that's why I'm wondering.
---
Took me 70 to get my left arm. Know the feel.
---
Please tell me this isn’t a score NW challenge... These just keep getting worse and worse.
---
Honestly I doubt they will ban you for something like these, tbh glitches like this is what makes fallout fun. God mode glitches and things that give people an advantage are what people tend to get banned for.
---
The distinction our friends here are making is valid: There is XP/loot from the queen, only if you do enough damage to her, versus XP/loot from the event.  You should always get the XP/loot from the event as long as it is active for you when it completes.
---
I don't know whether it's my platform (PS4), location/servers or internet connection but Scorched Earth is still an incredibly glitchy event for me.  This includes XP/loot not being listed on screen but still being awarded to me.  Also, massive lag for loot to become available in the queen after she drops.
---
Edit: Typos
---
It gave me two options, leave session and move C.A.M.P. I think I pressed move C.A.M.P and then my house was gone, even in other sessions. Maybe my house was just bugged or something.
---
Nobody use the 'nerf' word. After my life in ESO their parent ZOS uses this blind hammer to belt the fucking shit out of good sets. Or any set. Arbitrarily. In the name of 'balancing'. Like a petulent child of a billionaire allowed to bring a sledgehammer into a fine art museum unsupervised. 
---
This is not a nerf comment. This is a 'give us a CHOICE comment'. If you're gonna keep horribly narrow sets like Hunters and Zealots and put them in the loot table at the purveyor (fuck her), I'd want *much higher* damage from them. Like, 75% to maybe even double. Make it worth using them in those settings, as nobody gives two shits about 30% or whatever it is. Imagine Troubleshooters doing close to double - you'd have a dedicated silo gun. 
---
I feel peoples vendors say it all- you turn up to see all Bloody and Unyielding with nothing else for sale. I mean, why wouldn't you have maxxed specials and a boosted damage gun that deals that damage against ALL targets. 
---
To quote Sofia 'Just..... Why?.....'
---
Yes. It’s not a fully released quest.
---
Shit, I saw a “I don’t sell to Gays” sign the other day... I guess the apocalypse had a hard time eradicating these fucking cockroaches.. It’s just brutal to see so much hate in a place I love so much..
---
What platform do you play? Would like to check it out, if that's cool.
---
Mate it was a joke lol
---
Ohhhh ok
---
#guaranteedspawnfall
---
If you are on PS4 I can help you level and give you consumables that will grant you xp. Been doing that all month for new players who need help leveling. And I will help any loe levels out. PSN: MothmanLoyalist
---
Someone mentioned you can put two walls together or two door way then switch to normal wall then you can  wallpaper both sides.
---
I've tried, there is no categories for this. All I can do is submit Atomic Shop feedback which will probably just be ignored.
---
I saw that he was downed a couple of Times but he did ask for help while alive aswell so i really don't know what it was about. Its very strange
---
Would you like some cheese with that?
---
August 4th isnpatch 21 i believe.  Adrenaline isnfixed in the PTS, or so ive heard.
---
As for the fast travel bug? Thats been around forever.
---
&gt; I realise that this event isn't meant to be a solo event
---
A bit of an aside, but this event actually goes against their original design philosophy.
---
Initially, Bethesda said the entire game and everything in it could be done solo. Primarily because some people just wanted another singleplayer Fallout experience, and they wanted FO76 to appeal to those players as well.
---
But since then they've added Radiation Rumble, Project Paradise, and Encryptid, - all added post-launch - and none of these are designed to be done solo.  
---
I guess they changed their mind.
---
I haven’t played this game in a while and was thinking about trying it again.  Seems like it’s still a dumpster fire.
---
Yeah couldn’t agree more 👍
---
Stop trying to stir up shit as if Bethesda's abandoned this sub and communicating with the players here.  That's not even how that fucking tag works.
---
I accidentally one shotted a legendary during Riding shotgun and I got angry message from someone else doing the event with me that I was rude and stupid for killing it. I told him that I was sorry and that it was an accident.
---
Funny thing was that there was another legendary around the corner and I tried to emote the guy "hey come and kill this one" but he was busy messaging me so he missed that legendary too.
---
ah, well. no idea then. guy was weird.
---
Now THAT I would have never known so thank you so much for that bit of info! I already have demo perk at 2 stars so before investing more into it will do a test as you did. Thanks a lot for that reply, think it will really make a difference going forward :)
---
I like the ability to disable the notifications, the legendary one is especially annoying.
---
This is my coffee break event. I prefer to just sit as well.
---
If there are other capable high levels and I can watch 1 robot I'm happy as well.
---
Yeah that's true, what's the recent dupe is it across all platforms? I'm on xb
---
Thanks pal. Will start experimenting with that tomorrow, levelled up 30 times since double xox began so go a lot of points to spare for grabbing the cards I never bothers investing into before.
---
Eating cooked meat such as ragstag gives you the extra carry weight, but nothing as in food use for hunger.
---
The two options should me “stay in this world, or find another world”. If you say in this world, your camp will be gone, but as long as you don’t actually move it- it will be where you left it if you change servers.
---
So the dmg output is better using a regular Fixer than a *** Instigating Combat Rifle. I do have to admit that I'm not at all that impressed with my CR.
---
I'm using all maxed out rifle perks and a stealth build.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
I'm close to get my rep with raiders soon.. now I'm not looking forward to it as much after seeing this lol. Was your luck the same with the other slots?
---
Just put it wherever fits best. Submitting a ticket is the best way for it to get addressed.
---
I had a player give me a bunch of stuff that he didn’t have to. Makes me want to keep coming back to this game.
---
It was last week/weekend, a lot of people got banned. But it was on all platforms
---
Wouldn’t that be awesome?!?!
---
It’s an atom challenge
---
And if you look at Rifles, it is even worse in comparison =\
---
Do the Wastelander quest line and the end mission will be Vault 79 raid, which will give you access.  Your allies will join you.  It's a tough fight with lots and lots of robots and Laser Turrets.
---
Hell, they could keep the layout and just rework it into an endgame dungeon/event with exclusive rewards relating to the farming/nature DLC
---
Arktos stuff is rare?
---
So.. I shouldn't have sold the Arktos lab coat to a vendor bot for like 8c?
---
Yeah, that's what it says. Then I don't have to worry about that anymore. Thanks.
---
Scrap the infinite amount of laser rifles that drop from mutants, with scrapper that’s about 11 plastic per gun
---
Mate, i logged in, went to west tek (after trying to fast travel 3 times) then immediately realised that my flamer had the range of an inch. Ran off to "fix it" and it took SIX attempts to fast travel to my camp. Oh yeah this is some fucking fun gameplay.
---
Explosive Minigun is awesome for tagging without killing things right away, with double ammo capacity you just go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
The Bear Arm plans specifically.  Couldn't remember what it was called to be honest other than "Bear thingy".
---
0
---
Is that good or bad, in your opinion?
---
I try to only drop stuff that people can use, unless it's a legendary, in which case, they can scrip it easy, especially if it's 3* junk.
---
I think there should be a "keep at all costs" way to mark items, rather than the ad hoc skin method.
---
The scrap cards idea should be scrapped. And how are they gonna even do that correctly when tons of perk pack cards have been discarded already?
---
Yea it seems to be wayyyy worse lately for me too
---
The scout ghillie skin has the same issue, holding a rifle there’s a clipping issue in the bottom left corner and while sprinting. It’s very annoying and I stopped using it.
---
Fallout 3 Overlords. Loved the FEV mutation.
---
IMO This is the best way to get rid of caps.
---
That makes me sad.
---
Nicely done!
---
I'll take that over a leveled Gutsy any day.
---
I buy chems and gamma rounds from lows at any price.
---
Great build and picture to showcase it.  :)
---
Oh I've got 5 or 6 hundred stimpacks in my pocket. No way I'm losing the chemist. It really isn't that big a deal. Only thing I carry is a Fixer, bos recon rifle, CSS and aid. I'm at like 130 out of 250 lbs. I'm just a greedy hoarder and was hoping for and extra 60lbs. 1st tent kind of makes the whole weight thing not a big deal anyway. 
---
Thanks for the replies.
---
What makes it sadder it's that I'm lvl 108
---
Don;'t worry about it, the rewards are dismal at best. I refuse to grind or play more than I normally do because they want us to. What happens when Season 2 comes, we repeat the same BS all over, its too much. Save your atoms and spend it on stuff you really want.
---
No.........I am
---
I'd really like to see the evolution of caps from each cap being worth 1 cap to certain varieties being worth more to notes being issued that are worth caps all the way until it becomes an actual paper currency with actual bottle caps not being used anymore.
---
As long as by lighter you mean 0 weight. That would be great!
---
Giant hermit crab because its shell is a bus and can put up quite the fight
---
On the awning overlooking the courtyard?
---
We could talk to him over radio or something
---
And quest and legendary item rewards.
---
You only get perk cards
---
This is why I always go for a simple small town / remote settlement feel.
---
...it’s too much work to build something like Ops AND fail at doing so.
---
In the break on the ledge looking toward the bridge protection point (gazebo).
---
Cool so it’s completely optional then, glad it’s not tied to the score thing.
---
Yeah the heart is next to the puke

It's part of the weapon's identity. Like when you see a rosso corsa red sports car go by, you know it's a Ferrari. When I see a player with a green rifle, I know it's  a Fixer. You can customize nearly everything else in this game world, what's the big deal about one gun?
---
If you're on PC, then [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/655) may help.

On my main i was lucky and i got a full set with 40 modules,my alt however spented around 200 and he is still missing the left arm, still however its better than finding it by killing legendaries and its a good thing its not tradable otherwise dupers would be selling unyielding sentinels weapon weight reduction by the truckload.
---
If you're just starting out its always more economical  to get 1 card of each damage type for a weapon instead of maxing out 1 card to 3 stars.
---
1 card is 10%, so you'll get 30% more damage with 1 rank of slugger, one rank of expert, and one rank of master which is better than 3 points in slugger at 20%.
---
You also max at 15 for your special stats as well so it's sometimes better to leave an "ok" perk like faster swing rank at 1 star so you have room for more for other perks.
---
Whenever someone claims my workshop and they’re too much for me to handle, if I can I just leave the game before they fully claim the workshop, so they have to spend the caps claiming it all over again, hahah.
---
The game will auto sort things alphabetically that are renamed as well. So if you rename your left arm to “Armor - Arm Left” and so on your current gear will always be at the top of the pipboy list.
---
I’m on PS4, Thought about playing on PC but the hacks and whatnot convinced me otherwise.
---
What kind of person has their younger brother call them their family name anyways? So weird.
---
That would be the idea, as they'd only be decorative at that point and not overpowered to be able to carry too many.
---
Remember where we parked, kids!
---
Cigarette cartons have plastic too FYI
---
It could be because of radiation damage. I have a full health build and I think it tries healing the few ticks of radiation and tries to move my HP which makes it think I took damage. Once I take a radaway it stops canceling the fast travel
---
How tf does your budget survive.
---
For Herbivore, find Mutated Fern, to make Fern Tea.  Gives +2 to STR.  The Steeped variant of it gives +4.
---
So is it a 20 minute timer (I read that somewhere) AND 250 items before they start respawning for you or just the 250 items? I'm thinking just the 250 items due to my play experience.
---
They were even better In fallout 4 when they could Insta kill you by repeatedly stabbing you with their blade arms.
---
Gauss pistol has been working well for me. Depending on level and where I hit, it's either a one shot, or the legs are gone and they're crawling.
---
Cue someone's picture of that monorail support with "nothing is real" painted on it.
---
This theory ahs been around since the start and I think it's a reasonable one.
---
Once you finish WL main quest you buy plans with gold bullion then get legendary modules from the purveyor. You can then craft legendary items of the plans you bought.
---
But it's a lottery what you end up with as people are saying.
---
&gt; I break apart all my shit so I can build more stuff into the broken stuff with a flamethrower
---
I'm curious what you mean by this?
---
It is actually unbelievable to me, that they literally expect and now demand you to login daily with the battle pass. They are literally demanding you login daily now. Yet at the same time take a month to fix fundamental broken shit in the game.
---
Seriously wtf is that about? Its insane.
---
 Don’t think they do, did a running test at one point with a friend and couldn’t see a difference
---
That used to be the case but since patch 20 apparently you no longer get the buffs either when eating the opposite food to your mutation
---
Had that issue when trying to craft the secret service arms.
---
Hey mate I just experienced this bug earlier. If you can't talk to Smiley then go talk to Duchess and select a couple of conversation options. After doing this, I was able to talk to Smiley as expected and purchase my gold.
---
Any time 👌
---
I’d love to build there but it makes fast traveling to places like the bog and more so expensive
---
Ohh. I got on whem wastelanders came out, decided to go back to the vault, then i spoke to those ladies. Then i didnt play again until yesterday. Probably just slipped my mind.
---
I *love* this gun. I just went through the Burrows to compare since I ran through it yesterday &amp; it's night &amp; day. While the charred still take me down super quick, it's a much more level field since I'm taking them down just as quickly. In lieu of paying you back directly, I am gonna name the gun after you: ***The DumDum.*** Haha, thank you again!
---
Speed Demon hits the cap by itself. It makes all other speed bonuses null.
---
Idk what the orginal comment was since it was deleted but you are right, the brotherhood did not get the ability to build vertibirds until fallout 2, however vertibirds were used before the war so it would make sense that the brotherhood may have vertibirds before fallout 2.
---
Yay for fireworks!!!
---
Knowing coding it would be twice as much code (maybe a little more) to have it be 20 minutes and 250 items. I haven't tested that in particular but I'd bet just the item list with the items naturally dropping off after 20 hours
---
Totally agree.
---
PA is currently good for, Tanking all around damage if you have Medics Pump, First Aid and Field Surgeon, that is pretty much it. (Well also Excavator x4 on Ore)
---
Even Carry weight is no longer it's benefit over regular armour.
---
Building underground gives you the advantage of not having stuff attack your camp I would imagine. I could care less though and enjoy finding these types of camps but it's like a sliding scale of how much of an advantage and in what way will set people off. 
---
The fact this got downvoted just goes to show how easily triggered some people are lol.
---
Carebear
---
Right therefore I’m trying to find the alternative for it..? :(
---
Getting Reported For An In Game Feature, Welcome To Fallout 76.
---
Plan your build ahead of time. Some builds like melee and shotgun/heavy guns share a perk tree. Others like rifles and pistols require max level in completely different perks. You need to have a plan because switching later is time consuming. There are certain perks that are universal like bloody mess, lone wanderer, and the perks that support mutations. (You will definitely be using mutations) Eventually you will loot or buy guns and armour to suit your build. Be mindful that certain things should only be completed after level 50 in order to get the best possible reward.
---
I've never actually fought for resources ever at a workshop, in fact in most cases it's people stealing my junk that I have to initate pvp to get it back;
---
And keep in mind it's people 200 levels higher than me doing this; if it weren't for the TSE15 Gatling Explosive I have, I probably would be stolen from alot more than anything.
---
Hopefully. I'd love to
---
Especially with Rifles which have no weight reduction perks...
---
No way, it’s the thought that counts. If you’re new everything helps, so know that anything you choose to give away is very appreciated!
---
Places I hit now and then in case I ever actually need to craft my shotgun ammo.
---
- Whitesprings (my camp is there so it’s an easy quick source with the golf balls and golf clubs).
---
- Morgantown High school
---
- watoga high school
---
- Westek for super mutant energy weapons
---
And I keep getting them but not bloodied so scripped! I want +1 INT
---
You'll want action boy so you get your power attacks back faster. 
---
Martial artist cuts melee weapon weight and lets you swing faster.
---
Blocker since you'll be in the fray to cut enemy melee damage.
---
Incisor for sure.
---
Glow sight is a great damage buff in general against glowing enemies.
---
Rejuvenated gives an extra AP regen bonus from being hydrated.
---
Solar powered gives a STR and END boost during the day.
---
Chem resistant if you want some artificial STR boosts.
---
Party boy if you want to use alcohol.
---
Tenderizer works well and the name certainly fits the theme.
---
Makeshift warrior for mods and weapon durability.
---
Chemist if you're into the chem thing to craft double.
---
Weapon Artisan to repair beyond 100%.
---
Marathoner can help to close the gap when chasing enemies.
---
Ninja if you want to sneak.
---
Adrenaline for damage boosts in hordes.
---
Grim Reaper's Sprint for AP regen.
---
Bloody Mess for bonus damage.
---
Plenty of others depending on which way you want to take it.
---
I have same problem, on Vanguard build I’m getting Unyielding and on Bloodied build I’m getting Vanguard. I know you want us to grind the hell out but I think people aren’t that stupid and can see what you doing. Explain this Bethesda...? Seriously annoying stuff...
---
In a lot of events if I have to stop, pull up my pip boy, wait for the cards to load, then swap out cards, then wait for it to update, then there is a good chance the event will fail cause no one is doing objectives/protecting [project paradise, radiation rumble, free range,etc] 
---
Even in other event I'll be out of commission for a good 45- 60 seconds depending on how laggy the game is at that second.
---
I’m a Christian, so every game, every thing that has progress will go up in flames once I go to heaven. 
---
Puts any potential corrupted saves or scam that happens to me into perspective, “it was gonna happen sooner or later” 🤷‍♂️
---
My base is high up atop the monorail tower, when fired the round kept going past the ground!
---
Yup. that did it. Thanks, would never thought about the damn paint glitching out.!
---
Well, my atoms are there... Until I go to the shop. As soon as I open the shop they turn to 0. The atoms are there as long as I am not trying to spend them.
---
Honestly some locations I’ve put my CAMP they never get attack anyway, my current location sucks but I’ll be moving it again soon.
---
Just fine here on ps4.
---
We should be able to fight the real mothman
---
The vault tech video prepared us for when meeting hostile and simple minded fools. 
---
With *Nuclear eradicati-* I mean civil discussions and debates.
---
Water wookies. Good times.
---
It let you get to the proper vault door, but the only thing of interest there was and is a terminal that Mercy or somebody posted boring logs on. Now you get your code automatically, making the unmarked quest pointless.
---
Holy shit. I’ve been max caps on 5 characters for more that a year. Plus tons of 5.56 and .45. No duping, just grinding 1400 caps a day each.......
---
If you use a flamethrower trap to break your camp items like walls, you can place things where they were and then repair the broken item. This will make the now repaired item clip through the other one, leading to some fun design uses.
---
I haven't even played 200 hours yet and I've been paying since the day Wastelanders dropped
---
Look into your luck perk cards. Alot of them compliment or work for all weapon types.
---
 The bloody mess is 15% extra damage for all weapons when maxed out.
---
Nerd rage is also good for if you want to run a low health, bloodied build, or want extra survivability when near death.
---
If you're stealthy and like to sneak around the sneak attack mulitplier perks can work with a Melee build especially if you're cleearing a building and one shoting an enemy with an instigating rocket sledgehammer, and  than sneaking to the next.  (Alot of deungons are not really conducive to this style and alot of events dont work with this play style either where enemies swarm you.)
---
Even after listen to all the dialog through the button?
---
Sure, but you can't get expert or master until later anyway. When the only one available is the first one, upgrading it isn't the worst option if nothing else is sticking out.
---
Haha thanks man just glad I helped you out and soon you’ll show those charred who’s the boss
---
They usually still get me with 1 laser beam if theres no cover to hide behind
---
This is what I do. usually just sit there in the lotus pose for the whole event while I smoke a bit and enjoy the meditation.
---
Hi,
---
What type of weapon do you want to hit hard with?
---
Have thorn and solar already?
---
They are always 3*, much better odds.
---
Good luck!!
---
Doesn't that say it all about NW and PvP in F76. If there weren't cosmetics to get or SCORE points this wouldn't need to be a thing.
---
For lvl 5 the range of it is crazy the damage is mid tier high-ish tier depending on perks it's certainly fun to play with and very op for lower levels
---
It needs to be tradeable. I've made several, but I'm not a unyielding bulid.
---
I also play on ps4, I did it earlier and got cup but did it again and didn’t get any, I did about the same damage each time so idk
---
Both
---
I had no idea there was one in the Watoga High School until it snuck up on me and used me as a mop to clean the entire building's floor.  They are terrifying.
---
Ever since finding a 3 star shotgun, Mr Gutseys are nothing, but invisible head glowing monster killer ray assaultrons are the devil.
