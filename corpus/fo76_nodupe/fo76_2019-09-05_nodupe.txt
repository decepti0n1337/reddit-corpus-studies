Are you on Xbox?

?

I don‚Äôt have that problem because I often play in third person and have never used bows in Skyrim. But yeah in first person the archery system in 76 isn‚Äôt the best.

We report here because Bethesda just locks and ignores sent tickets!

This doesn't always change your spawn!

for vendors? could use a small generator
---
They still exist so that hasn't made a difference.
---
Exactly for vendors
---
Guess i must be blessed as it does for me. Even just moving it several feet.
---
Handmade and a LMG.

Fair enough, I like it tho

Anyone been to the real Greenbrier and have a room key or to the real Camden park and have a season pass?  I‚Äôd prefer to model the cards on real life versions if they exist.
---
Well it could be added into the main menu as mini games where it‚Äôs only joining for those events. Just wanting to at least put the idea out first.
---
Thanks
---
Same
---
From what others have said, it's a placeholder image
---
All 4 of my bases it seems to be the same 4-5 spawn points regardless of where I put the camp object. So I've resorted to hunting down each location, put somewhere safe for them to land on, then add a pointing standee!
---
Definitely, my character is practically a functioning alcoholic with how much whiskey he chugs in a single session. Sometimes I'm lucky and I have some meat as well that increases str or carryweight.
---
I think I know what you're saying, putting it inside with them? Honestly at that point I'd rather just drag a line in through the front door. But if that's the only option then whatever. Thank you
---
Ya know. The drip
---
Camps with deathclaw spawns are great for that!
---
There are no automatic weapons that use .308 that I know of. In my experience, .38, .44, .45, .50, 5.56 and 5mm sell the fastest and in high numbers (price everything 1 cap). 
---

---
Plans are really very weird. There are some things that are considered rare at an evergreen level (never going to not be rare like pulse mines, or is it pulse grenade? I forget) and then there are plans that were once considered rare and are now very common. Like the death claw gauntlet extra claw plan would go for up to 1500 and now it‚Äôs just still rare but the price is with a natural realm. You just have to have a feel for what people want and even then it can be tough. I‚Äôve listed rare plans I didn‚Äôt care about for next to nothing and they‚Äôve sat but then something stupid like a sofa plan will just fly off the shelf. I get it but it‚Äôs kind of a mystery

The event will auto complete. You don‚Äôt need to donate anything.
---
Maybe? Pc gamepass
---
Well I play in third person a lot too but when you crouch in third person while aiming the aiming sensitivity is way higher, i use controller too so it‚Äôs nearly unusable too XD
---
Uh.....no link to a video.
---
That is even more reason to state how pointless it is.  And how insignificant it is to donate
---
It‚Äôs an exploit
---
This was my first Collectron ever for a CAMP. This guy is an a\*\*hole.    
---
Reminds me a lot of my time in the Army. üòÜ
---
Its not legitimate
---
It's a cheat
---
There‚Äôs a exploit that lets you place it at your camp
---
Mm good question. I wonder if damage perks will still be that relevant. On one hand removing them would allow for more diversity,on the other the stupid bunny hop firefights would last even longer due to the lower damage.
---
There's a fan in the top of the dome that you can pass conduit connections through, I've got a fusion generator and lead extractor in mine and I've run a line up to a connector and then a pylon on top of the dome and out to the rest of the camp. Also, a round ceiling light hides nicely inside the fan to provide a discrete light source.
---
*Edit: Spelling.
---
No but the real question is are you commie scum?
---
Seriously though, there's meant to be a power connector for the bunker but apparently it's only visible once the bunker is destroyed, according to this:
---

---
Maybe grab a power line and run around and over the bunker and see if it automatically snaps. See that if that helps any.
---
I want the robco jumpsuit lol
---
Wait until lvl 650+  
---
At that point a bloodied/Unyielding build is mandatory with eating Broiled Scorchbeast brain for the big Intelligence buff.
---
Hey do you have a Facebook? There‚Äôs a group on there that runs queens a ton and would be a lot easier to find people. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúqueens and things‚Äù
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
I remember cleaning the golf club of the levels 62 charred gouls when I was level 15 with my 15 level vampire shotgun, running and running and dying and dying or using all my stimpacks and ammo, or dying in SBQ because was level 7-15 and had no protection against radiation, eventually you'll catch the trick, don't worry.
---
 I recommend having the vat resistance perk so you can see what damage is the best for a creature (at least until you get to level 50) and doing high level events to level up quicker. Oh, and avoid mirelurks Kings and yaoguais those are deadly.
---
Bows and Crossbows are lacking big time.    
---
Considering the post-apocalyptic world, a bow would be one of the easiest and most efficient weapons that people would want. You'd have to get a really good 3 Star with the right effects to do significant damage.
---
Two posts are enough.
---
There are lots of events in the forest that you should be able to complete pretty easily either by yourself or if there are others in the event. You can see how many people are in an event by hovering over the event on the map. If you see a few people are participating you can join the event by fast traveling straight there. These events are good ways to get fast xp, plans, sometimes legendary weapons drop. You can level up very fast just by exploring the forest and joining events.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but can you use the wall pass through conduit at the top by the fan?  I‚Äôve had it glitch through ceilings and be half in half out before
---
Do I report it or should I rob it and steal the ammo or what?
---
aye. like hide them behind the vendors as they are unsightly.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the input.  Right now I‚Äôm using .308, 10mm, .45, and shotgun shells so I can sell excess of everything else.  
---
What about explosive rounds like missiles and grenades (for the launcher and throwable)?  Those missiles take a ton of space in my loot box.
---
Didnt plan on doing the next 1, rewards not appealing enough
---
very nice, good work :)
---
Maxson's goals were sort of forgotten or remolded, he actually was fairly good friends with her according to the [encoded messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gyd9db/all_transmissions_decoded_an_update_on_patch_20s/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) we got a while ago. &gt;!Rahmani's!&lt; disputes with the Brotherhood at large appear to be with their other leaders, less so Maxson himself.
---
Nothing wrong with a little robbery. üòàüòÇ
---
I'd like to see an Order of Mysteries DLC which has new weapons which THOSE are the ones you can turn into legendaries.
---
The current ones are unique legendaries as they are. Doesn't make any sense to allow them to be more legendary than they already are. Otherwise the same rule applies to all unique legendaries, which defeats the purpose of them being unique legendaries.
---
It was added as a ploy to remove duped materials, or to bolster the appearance of concurrent players, or both
---
Lol ya think they'll ban people for placing it? Cause tbh I'm kinda low on ammo
---
15 - work on getting a 1* set
---
I just broke my ankle in 4 different places so this is perfect for me to lay around and recover with after surgery üò≠
---
Lmao! I honestly just wanted this bundle because it's to me the first like really good looking defense stuff they've put it. Plus the extra 500 atoms at the end of the board persuaded me more. Thanks for for link! Yeah a post would be great. I noticed though if you hook electricity to the outside, the outer shell has current but obviously not the inside. I will try your suggestion, thank you
---
Most that high are ones who used the XP exploits.
---
What counts as poison in this game? I know the Mirelurk Queen has an attack that seems to be poison, but what are the others? Just asking in case I'm somehow overlooking the usefulness of poison res because I only know about the Mirelurk Queen.
---
I would assume it isn‚Äôt. NW seems to prioritize quick kills and boosts damage quite heavily via fully leveled perks.
---
I have vampire gauss minimum with faster fire rate + penta barbell, that thing destroys dem vendigos at the ACP...
---
reporting is a dick move if there is only one, people will group with others in a private group and drop one or two in people's camps. I've had it happen, others have had it happen.   
---
So just loot it and move on, mine had free ammo in neon since I never wanted the damn thing or the ghost budget that comes with it.
---
True, if I really have  to that route I'll definitely remember that. Thanks bro
---
Was thinking lunchboxes too. At least they'd be useful in obtaining more perk coins
---
Dont think youll see much of a difference if any.
---
Well, comparing honest players and exploiters is somehow not very correct. With the damage nerf, pistols will be unable to compete with carbine and machine-gun assemblies, this is already evident from the test.
---
I've seen that one!
---
Dump missiles. They take up waaaaaaaay too much space. 40mm grenades are a maybe. Try it for a day at a low price. Camp placement also matters a ton. If you‚Äôre near a high level event then expect to sell auto rounds easier, if you‚Äôre near the vault, expect to sell ammo for low level weapons. 
---
Thrown grenades...use them. They save asses.
---
Being a very high level (640) I find that sneaking in to someones camp, dropping gifts them slipping out works best.
---
You know I've been trying that but I have those deer antler chandelier in the way.... I'll fiddle with it some more. Thank you
---
yo pretty much though... lmao theres def some keeper things but im not really a fan of the radaway or keycards either i dont actively pursue nuclear keycards and they just come to me like, very often.
---
Switch it to gamma rounds but don‚Äôt report
---
Cool, thanks for the heads up!
---
PS4 here but having the same problem! All my main missions currently put me up against Assaultrons which I‚Äôve no hope against. 
---
Tonight I literally just turned off all my mission markers and went scouting around the forest for junk! I feel like I can‚Äôt really progress
---
I'm about to fiddle some more with that, I tried earlier but have a chandelier in the way. Thank you!
---
Just get the ammo legendary on an alt.
---
Nothing better than E-6+ trying to make you feel like a scumbag just for existing lmao

# HMMMMMMMM-HMMMMM-MMMMMM-MMMMMMMM. I. JUST. LOVE. SONGS. DON'T. YOU?

Also Sofia's friendship speech, which last over a minute and repeats almost everytime you travel to a camp where she's the active ally.

[removed]
---
I swear I didn‚Äôt dupe those aces. Your deck came with 3 ace of clubs I swear.
---
It looks like there are roughly 10 levels that offer 150 atoms (1500) plus level 100 (500) = 2000 atoms or rather ($20) from the legendary run, that‚Äôs pretty fair for not paying a dime
---
Drum mag for the crossbow or BUST
---
This is incredibly slow, so slow in fact I don‚Äôt even consider it an exploit.
---
Don‚Äôt.
---
I only need to craft ammo occasionally, and it's 1 perk coin to swap out and 1 to swap back aka 1 level.
---
Shame I can't find any misc versions.
---
Yes probably. I just don't hack or pick anything anymore unless needed for a challenge.
---
When I made a new character I transferred him a bunch of Nukashine to use so I could unlock fast travel points all around the map. That's the only time Ive found it to be useful.
---
Mostly they're good for crippling enemies like a crowd control type weapon they're somewhat under powered 
---
However Since it is a strength build you could fall back on melee.
---
The biggest problem is the fact that they're nerfing all weapons, weapon mods, damage perks, legendary effects and food/chem buffs so that its going to be so much harder to deal damage early game...
---
I though of a tip that will probably become a psa if correct......throwing knives.
---
38 is better imo gamma will sell to some pvpers
---
The only reason i donated a bit of steel was because i thought the rewards boxes would have the same stuff as the mole miner pales. But they only have the shittiest rewards from those so there is 0 reason to donate. This is the second time weve had a. Event like this and bethesda has proven time and time again that they dont have the capabilities to track this event.
---
They could with explosive bait unless that was pacthed
---
The entire premise of Fallout 76 revolves around the plague, so it's unlikely it'll ever be removed.  Also keep in mind the entire game takes place inside one year 25-26 years after the great war.  So Fallout 76 is one giant Groundhogs Day.
---
Is it out?
---
Oh yeah definitely. I‚Äôm a junkies build so with five addictions and max rank of demolitions experts my explosive junkies bow can do 315 damage. Combine that with sneak damage boosted with the perk covert operative and some buildup from adrenaline and I can deal with about 90% of the enemies the game throws at me.
---
Thank you for the clarification, Mr. RectalSpawn. I can remember only wanting to lock the output bin, and finding the terminal locked after I did that. I will check again. And I should have stated you can store it, but with CAMP budgets the way they are, I wouldn't want to encourage people to store things they may forget are there. Thank you again for your comment.
---
For nuke cards for me I just run the bunker real quick and when the bot shows up on the map i have my friend meet me there and get 2 cards for the price on 1
---
Yeah it doesn't do much in terms of collection so you're better off switching its subroutine. A free skin is a free skin though!
---
Please tell me you at least bought some Atomic shop shit before all those atoms got revoked.
---
It is Maxson Brotherhood, not Lyons, so that intent isnt that surprising.  It's like 5 people though.  Wtf is 5 people gonna do with 150 million leather?
---
Yeah silly example but you get what I'm saying ... maybe crit damage or damage while aiming...etc
---
Chinese pistol skin for the 10mm pistol/smg
---
I don't think they coming to take over, but they are mission oriented and they know about the SB's and that Taggerdy was working to eliminate that very serious threat then communications was cut. They want to know what happened.  They might know about Modus, they certainly know something about Atlas.  They likely do not know the 76'ers have been dropping nukes all over the place.  They may not be happy about that.  Lots of potential for drama.
---
Ditto for classic F3 outfits.   
---
Merc Outfits, Raider Outfits, Classic Radiation Suit, Classic Leather / Metal / Combat armors, Recon undersuit, Regulator's duster, Enclave officer's uniform, Wasteland Wanderer Outfit.
---
Yep. Though they are heavy. So I recommend doing what I am doing and find the 3*s with 90% weight reduction. You can mod those down to no weight. It‚Äôs either that or set aside an eight of your stash for a few cannon decorations.
---
If this is your first and only collectron, than my post is a bit pointless, sorry. I was mostly addressing the poly-collectron crowd. As stated below, it will just collect the targeted scrap for you then.
---
You don‚Äôt have to donate anything it‚Äôs optional, there‚Äôs many more players that would donate either for the idea that they‚Äôre helping to welcome the BoS or for new players who don‚Äôt have the plans or not a lot of caps. There‚Äôs more than just endgame players. Scrap is the easiest thing to acquire in the game, and the scrap required is the scrap no one mainly uses. If you don‚Äôt want to donate then don‚Äôt, no one is forcing you too, there‚Äôs many other players who actually enjoy the game that would participate rather than cry about it.
---
You can glitch into that upper room. I wish they opened it up since it‚Äôs basically complete, except for the presidential dispenser thing
---
MODUS isn't genocidal. He's just trying to phone home. He lets you launch nukes if you so desire in exchange for getting him access to his satellite again. MODUS isn't dangerous; the players are.
---
Except for the Real Blast events, that's just MODUS straight up bombing Appalachia.
---
I was going for "easy to dev" rather than "invest more time"
---
Could I replace the raider bot for you, no homoüòè
---
I‚Äôm buried with junk now and it‚Äôs awesome.  But also don‚Äôt worry about buying one as I‚Äôm tempted to buy them all.  Got the raider one when it was on sale and it‚Äôs useful especially early on.  The collector one I believe provides ballistic scrap which I don‚Äôt believe the BoS one provides so if you bought that then you might use it instead.
---
Oh man I can only imagine lol
---
As folks have mentioned above, it collects only the scrap that was needed for the BoS events, kinda neat. Whereas the regular "scrap" setting will collect all varieties.
---
Thank you
---
Me too, you never know what someone else is going through
---
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. And you‚Äôre right, it puts things in perspective :/
---
You are the only one here going bonkers over words on the internet, nobody here is getting "unreasonably upset" if your definition of unreasonably upset is someone annoyed at watered down rewards you need to see a psychologist.
---
Its an exploit. One you can't remove from your camp btw. So if you put it down youre sure to get reported by people. 
---
Wether they ban you or not cant really say. Its been out for a while.
---
The whole season 2 rewards in general are massively lacklustre.
---
Haha I hadn't heard about this.  Wow.  It's just more evidence they don't play their own game and have no concept of time/effort ratios
---
Learn to love it.
---
I'm not sure if that's true. I didn't have any lock pick perk cards equipped and I can lock all my containers. I do have them in my deck though, so perhaps it looks at that? When you are aiming at a lockable object in build mode, it will bring up and extra selection for "lock".
---
Yeah, but you aren't considering that before the legendary run you could get 2300-ish atoms per month with all challenges, now only 2000 in 10 weeks and with a lot of grind.
---
:(
---
The participation rate has got to be lower than 0.01%. Watching the rewards pop up is hilarious.
---
It‚Äôs BGS.
---
You need a cliff for it to work
---
Yeah I looked at the rewards I'm definitely not gonna even try to get points to rank this season up
---
This collects all varieties as well, the BOS donation doesn't need fibre optics or ballistic fibre and I've gotten both today!
---
Good to know I guess I‚Äôll just have to test it myself thanks everyone
---
Weird bug, I swear it didn‚Äôt always have camo elbow pads
---
Sure sure sure, but this does come with cosmetics and utilities, probably equals out, you lose some choice sure, but it seems like the system is better for community involvement
---
You can get some otherwise rare plans if you're after those. I got 6 or 7 different power armor plans (some raider, some t-51b) and around a dozen different prime receiver plans for ranged weapons. As someone who started with the release of Wastelanders I had not gained any of these rarer plans but I did have a lot of spare scrap from scavenging while I play, so this has been a really nice boost to the kinds of things I can craft/mod. If you don't care for PA plans or prime mods, or you've been playing enough to already have them, it's probably not worth the resources.
---
I know
---
As a fellow archer I completely agree üëçüèª
---
I'm genuinely confused. I don't even know what point you're trying to make anymore. no, junkie's builds don't *need* to use unyielding. they can, if they want. for the special bonuses. which in turn would grant them more exp. and I said the opposite, that the exp bonus from intelligence is getting nerfed as well. similarly to melee damage.
---
&gt;My Bloodied sneaky commando and sniper are gonna have some fun ! Extra +15 perception, +15 agility and +15 luck...and even +15 intelligence.
---
yes, and the same thing is available for literally every other build. isn't it wonderful?
---
I'd like to add onto this as a shotgun main since BETA that Gauss Shotguns are basically unusable in VATS as well, with pellets actively dodging enemy targets. Outside of VATS they suffer horribly from health ruberbanding and damage failing to register, but this effects most shotguns anyways.
---
That outfit also pairs wonderfully with the plague doctor mask
---
It‚Äôs what I did, mostly. I tossed in some steel at the start, and some cloth for this one, but that was it.
---
The bow animations are so awkward. Quiver should have always been a thing, along with weapons sheathed or slung on your shoulder.
---
I play a literal Enclave Infiltrator so I‚Äôm taking it for the thematics but I see your point. I like the idea of removing the mini game out of the equation though as you level it up: that‚Äôs a cool time saver.
---
Nah I‚Äôm pretty anti social media in general. Thanks tho
---
This shows a stunning lack of understanding of a GaaS model. Bethesda aren't trying to give you free rewards.
---
Huge difference between items and currency worth 8000$ being applied to an account. 
---
Op says they ended up removing ALL their atoms. I figured about as much would happen as its the only thing that makes sense.
---
Outcast one would look dope.
---
Well, you won‚Äôt like this guy too much...
---
All of the scrap items we‚Äôve had to turn in, alongside alcohol and grenades. Note that I‚Äôm not sure on the last two, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd heard from a data miner before it dropped. I know for certain on the scrap.
---

---
Nukashines are worthless and pointless.
---
Signed
---
Not going to waste a slot on it. Takes me three button presses to swap with my perk load out.
---
Keycards are cool (yet extremely simple to obtain) but the rest is bullshit and can‚Äôt agree more nobody wants nukashine, rad-x, or radaways
---
Oh yeah like they did in New Vegas. That would be awesome.
---
Pound sand, Ward!
---
Whiskey and the related perk give you +6 Strength. That's my emergency fast travel method.
---
You log on, do challenges, earn score, get free shit. You dont pay for it. Its free.
---
what did i get wrong?
---
I stumbled upon someone's camp with a dozen set up... Didn't think anything of it.
---
Stumbled upon a trap CAMP with one a week later - reported that fucker ASAP
---
That's the PC for you, the players somehow add or fix things that Bethesda still can't after all this time.
---
So the guy calling me a cuck for todd howard wasn't "unreasonbly upset" ok buddy.
---
Took me about a month to grind both reps to max after I kept all the gold for myself and pissed everyone off.
---
The up coming patch on the 15th cripples Gunslinger, Rifleman and Melee builds!
---
Just because someone offends you does not mean they are upset. sometimes kids like you just need a little verbal discipline to get back in line
---
Okay but the merc troublemaker outfit was my shit back in 3. The one with the two bullet bandoliers? Dope af.
---
The bos collectron. Seems inefficient compared to the Fanascht version. Harvesting seems slower
---
Id say it's probably because they are lazy
---
Sounds very on brand for BOS.
---
Can we get a world event for nuking atlas?
---
It's time gated content designed to be too long of a grind to reasonably be enjoyable. It gets you to log on every day - in an attempt to get you to buy more stuff - and asks you to do mundane, brain-numbing tasks - in an attempt to get you to buy ranks up. 
---
Remember, this entire system is designed to extract money from whales. It's not designed to give you free content.
---
Damned greenhouse set it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs gonna keep me on it

Yes it looks amazing.
---
The Outcast textures were made by a modder called Its Just Me.
---
Breech and Clear is having issues. I‚Äôve seen that it‚Äôs about 50:50 (in my experience and from other posts on here) as to whether the items in the containers will fail to populate. I‚Äôm sorry you had it back to back, tho!
---
I miss the old days when he‚Äôd be under the bed or hiding in his bookcase.
---
What about the OP who is literally acting like bethesda disrespected us as players for 2 lame rewards out of 100? I mean its laughable lol
---
Even better is to get the quest from him and then let the thief keep it in exchange for some caps. You still get Treasury Notes with the added bonus of screwing Ward over. And you don‚Äôt even have to go back to see him; the Daily completes right then and there.
---
Still remember all the downed 3* scorched beasts giving me either 1* lead pipes or wrenches...
---
The first day it came out there were level 20‚Äôs literally panicking, donating all of their stuff. Then going on runs to collect more. Not realizing that 50 hardcore duper‚Äôs could probably finish it on their own.....üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You mean a company wants to get paid for the content they make? IM SHOCKED!!!! lmao.

It's almost as if its a business!

Ever tried razorgrain flower or sugar? Really easy to make stuff. Hot wheel one as your falling and you‚Äôll have instant jet fuel. May help with your landings
---
I'm also curious if/how they stack with Demolition Expert.
---
Have to say, perk loadout is awesome. Once Beth gets it incorporated officially into the game it will change you qol. I run about 10 perk load outs for different things (solo vs team, explosive, foraging, various crafting, etc).
---
I'd love a mad science or inventor skin for radium
---
From what i have seen, unless you pick the unarmed one it isn't worth the investment, and even then you are better off investing into "Hack and Slash"
---
You don't have to pay anything for the first rank.

Getting a nuke keycard is pretty easy but out of all of these aid items, the keycards im totally ok with cause the quest is annoying af.
---
Without Master Infiltrator I have 2 Legendary Perks I find somewhat interesting so I have plenty of slots to fill...
---
the ability to have duplicates was added recently, in preparation for the legendary perks update where you can scrap unwanted cards for perk coins.
---
Yeah, kind of, I wish they could give some more atoms or good stuff (but I'm sure they won't) now I just hope the next run offers better rewards, like who is excited getting player icons, photo frames or 25 gold? XD
---
Both great examples! I‚Äôm just waiting for her to say ‚Äúhello love‚Äù when I walk into someone else‚Äôs camp üòÇ
---
My current plan is to put them all into S.P.E.C.I.A.L points,  it would be nice to have OP skills but with extra S.P.E.C.I.A.L I can have a much bigger load out of the perks that I want for Qol, as well have all the weapon perks I need, and with the rumoured loadouts it will be easy to move a huge amount of perks quickly and easily.  I currently have 14 levels saved for it, and 12 Perk card packs.
---
I bought up 4 from some dudes vendor not too long ago.  Now I have 5 and thats a statement you can't make in most games.
---
Just did thanks man!
---
Yup, that's it. Games have to make money, and developers are leaning more and more towards stripping the game away and replacing it with cash generation.
---
That's why we generally resist GaaS/battle pass models. I'd rather a more consumer-friendly form of monetization, no MTX, no battle pass, etc.

Or the whole fisto thing has been driven into the fucking ground over the years and people don't find it funny anymore.

I have an instigating gauss shotgun, but still prefer my instigating explosive combat shotty. Non bloodied or junkies build. The gauss shotgun always takes more than one shot, where my combat shotgun blows everything away. Prefer my f/ffr 50 cal over my furious gauss minigun as well.

People keep asking what the BOS collectrons collect. It's a lot funnier to consider who the BOS collectrons actually are.....

---
Leave room in your build for Tank Killer, I've heard it's been changed to apply to pistols on the PTS. 
---
Also on my current character I thought Gun Runner would be cool, but came to the realization that the two perk points were better spent on Starched Genes for the Speed Demon mutation. The two speed bonuses don't stack, 20% is the max. Speed Demon always applies and comes with faster reloads.
---
AD VICTORIAM, civies.
---
Although I do agree with the gold, the grind is already rather tedious, 100 gold bullion, half of what we can generate in a single day, isn‚Äôt worth while, everything can‚Äôt be Grade A items. I understand a lot of people‚Äôs frustrations, but we have received a decent amount of additional content on a game that seems doomed from the start. The only pushing it forward is the atom shop, so if that‚Äôs what it takes to keep producing content, so be it
---
Started mine as guerrila and now I've got all gunslinger and a quad revolver. It's pretty fun to play.
---
"More like Lyon's Brotherhood in Fallout 3"
---
Ah I'm assuming you've never played Fallout 1 or 2 with the original Brotherhood? Makes Arthur Maxon look like a bleeding heart that just wants to feed and help every person. I'm just surprised the Collectron calls people civilians and not tribals.
---
My turrets are always trying to murder the merchants. I have no idea why.
---
They stay close to there spawn point unless you aggro them. I always wait until the event completes then go kill them.
---
ill still try my best to unlock everything
---
Its so clean I love it
---
I‚Äôve got 13 Strength and I jokingly thought ‚ÄúYeah, probably cause the fatigues wouldn‚Äôt fit around them, stupid robot.‚Äù
---
My favorite futurama character was rectal exam bot
---
It‚Äôs not garbage. With the full set it looks like a storm trooper from Star Wars lul
---
And for them not to be nerfed into oblivion along with rifles, pistols and melee in the upcoming patch.
---
Futurama!
---
After the radicals mask we'll never have legendary headpieces
---
Who needs nukes? Just hit them with their biggest weakness in both NV and 4.
---
Classic old artillery.
---
Yeah use vats and you'll shoot like one too
---
Goats legs seems to protect me from that glitch.
---
Precisely
---
yep, Tank killer is gonna be useful for pistol players, sadly it may not be enough of a positive push
---
Captain noob soloed sbq with a bloodied bow. Took 10 minutes but hey, it works lol
---
The scrap I saw was pretty much building materials, no circuits or other useful bits. And I believe it had some .308 ammo, but I was clicking quickly and can't confirm.
---
I don't know if this is your case as well but something a lot of people don't seem to know or realize.
---
Example: If I have hard bargain level 3, level 2, and level 1 I cannot combine level 1 and level 2 and have 2 level 3 versions.
---
And as someone else pointed out duplicate cards are a thing which I have a few of now but If I have the other ranks I can't rank them up
---
As of now there is a condition on animated cards. If you already have a maxed normal version or a normal lvl 2 of a card, you won't be able to upgrade the animated version of that card but with other animated duplicates of that.
---
If instead the animated card is the highest
---
Lvl you have of that card,you should be able to upgrade it with normal version of that card.
---
In both cases anyway,once an animated card drops,you normally stop being able to purchase that card with your points.
---
This pretty much my experience.
---
It does, they finish the animation loop and move away
---
Lucky, not seen any ammo yet myself.
---
I've so far seen aluminium, fibre optics and ballistic fibre!
---
This is great, Nuka-World is one of the best Fallout DLCs imo

The use of action boy and rejuvinated depend on your gear. If you have 5 armor pieces with powered than you wont need them. Also will no longer need poison resist on your armor with the new poison legendary perk coming out on sept 15.
---
Hell yeah, got the Capital Wasteland Mercs creation club thing just to have it in F4.
---
Depends on what you mean by messed things up. Whats more important? Helping some wastelanders or preserving technology for the future?
---
Lol, ok.
---
Let us know when they‚Äôre on Etsy, so cool!
---
Maybe so. I remember him talking to Taggerdy about his own son becoming mistrustful of outsiders, so I suppose it wouldn't be too surprising if there was a widespread conflict of ideology among the leadership.
---
I'm looking forward to learning what's been happening out west.

I'll have great fun bouncing like mario all around their stuff as they beg me to do them favors.

Light footed prevents you from getting hurt by punji boards while in sneak. Pa or goat legs protect you from falling damage as well

What they already added them tho i have one

Also a bullet crown

Ask yourself...how to optimise Strenght, Perception, Intelligence, Agility and Luck and Dps...
---
If you don't understand that you don't understand how to optimise the use of the Unyielding armor set and don't understand the meta.
---
That's it...
---
For experienced players who wanna get the maximum of their gaming sessions...there's no point to not go for an Unyielding Bloodied build.
---
We call it a meta. This is the best build ingame.
---
Last exemple, bro, because you are clearly lost !
---
‚ñ™ for a melee build...the Unyielding set give him extra strenght...so it gives him more dps ! You need to be low health to get the maximum out of it...just go for a bloodied weapon....best dps in game. There's no point to go back to a Bolstering set you will lose 15 of strenght...so you will lose dps ! No point to go for a Junkie weapon...a bloodied weapon is just better at low health.
---
This build is the meta ! You wanna grind xp with your Junkie build...guess what ? You gotta bring all your xp buffs and use the Unyielding set and drop your health under 20% because you have no other choice...at this point you are just better use a Bloodied weapon for the extra dps.
---
All that shit is a problem !
---
Now dude...peace for real. If you can't do the math here....bro i tried my best üòÇ
---
The flashlight it has is awesome though. Of course the reclaimed mining mask has it now too and even the Quask Mask although with the quack mask the light comes from inside the person's shoulder...
---
Fallout 76 tells us that Roger Maxon had good intentions though. I feel that the group traveling to Appalachia don't share his intentions.
---
&gt; **Is there a way to finish Ward's daily quest without losing reputation from either faction?** 
---
Yup, you just kill Ward. You get max rep from both factions for doing it since no one likes that guy.
---
Bethesda doesn't give a crap about this game lol I'm not surprised at this point about trash rewards it's another piece of salt in a scratch
---
Also the 10 Nukashine.  I'd rather 3 missiles and a mini nuke than that trash. (No offense Biv, you're still the best)
---
On Test a free 50 perk points is given to those over level 50, for those reaching level 50 there is apparently a quest which will reward the 50 points.  This is meant to cover respecs or other points which could have been lost.  Card upgrades costs were also substantially reduced from what they were originally, upgrading will be slow for fresh 50s but not in a rediculous way like they were originally set up.
---
WAAAAAAAAANT
---
Except pets take forever to get the right one and it‚Äôs fun to do something over and over that you have already done. Nothing is exciting about farming again for a pet. It‚Äôs the same over and over. If pets didn‚Äôt die permanently it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. But go play nuclear winter to get your fix. Try your skill on non broken weapons.
---
That sounds like mutie talk to me! Members, get him on the list.
---
Power Armor Backpack torso upgrade would be cool.
---
My theory is it‚Äôs a Dead Money style ‚Äúthey‚Äôre kept ‚Äòalive‚Äô by the suits they‚Äôre wearing‚Äù type situation like the ghost people. So, miners trapped permanently in protective gear which they are unable to escape - it keeps them ‚Äúalive‚Äù (animated, anyway) but they can‚Äôt get out because the environment is not ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù I see killing them as merciful.
---
Liberty Prime dont get down with no arktos pharmacist bullshit if its aiding the needs of the communist party why you sellin my grandma psychotats at shrikellian prices then yo!?
---
Yes, idonteven use pa on the character I use but ik just getting them for the stand.
---
Find a copy of one of the stolen items floating around the world (there are youtube videos with location). It'll be from a dead raider thief whose body despawned. Pick it up and It'll either go into your junk, which means it can be placed in your stash, but can also be scrapped, or It'll go into your mosc inventory, which is best. Now go to ward, start the quest and you can immediately turn it in for no rep loss. Also, most of the time, turning in like that won't remove from your inventory so you can quick complete daily
---
I didn‚Äôt see that one. I‚Äôll have to check it out.
---
You don‚Äôt lose Raider rep for killing the thief and taking the item back to Ward. 
---
The only reputation loss you can suffer from Vital Equipment is -10 Settler rep for letting the thief keep the item. 
---
Use [this resource](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations) for more details on Reputation.
---
Fucking awesome, I don‚Äôt use PA either unless I need extra carry weight... always wanted to display suits. Thanks for the info
---
Are you still looking for people? I can run nukes if needed.
---
Yes because that won't generate problems for new players going through the story for the first time.
---
No, the Scorched are here to stay.
---
Scanning for counter-revolutionary values... Results: Several
---
And the legendary perks will only make the thirst more real

Just finished her questline and I dont wanna ever see her again. The best npcs in this game are Biv and the grafton mayor and you cant change my mind.
---
Imagine a Todd Howard collectron and it just collected ‚Äôyou‚Äôve been insulted‚Äô notes.
---
True, can't wait to get Lev 240 in the forest :)
---
I used cannibal, ghoulish, and carnivore through my first few characters which was amazing it worked amazing through most of the game
---
What is it, 2287?
---
This is dumb. Bethesda needs to fix this.
---
It collects different items than the standard. Even if you don‚Äôt want to switch the model, you can use the terminal to switch the protocol.
---
It‚Äôs in the free section.
---
There are a ton of guns that are like discount lever action rifles, so trash mobs are no problem, but there really isn't a decent gunslinger option for sustained boss fight dps. Apparently the best is the 10mm but even that is not so great. My character is a pistols/shotguns/unarmed build so I use pistols for long range until I can close the distance and blast away with a quad double-barrel.
---
Let's play a hand of Caravan! I actually played it with my cousin when the power went out
---
Thanks friend!
---
Agreed. The light is the best part. Very bright and a more natural color vs the pip boy hazy green.
---
Actually it goes well with the Pipers Outfit, the red leather hood matches it nicely but I dislike the helmet it self, if it was removed I would wear it more regularly.
---
What setting are for the brotherhood one?
---
No. But the BoS seem to enjoy hating on mutants... even when we the players are.
---
Thanks!  I ended up ditching all explosive weapons in FO4 because they didn‚Äôt scale well with the HP pools.  Made no sense that a missile launcher took 10+ rounds to kill a death claw.
---
Exactly.
---
Oh wow I cant wait to pick up a pair of fatigues! That was totally worth 150 MILLION WOOD.
---
I‚Äôm not a heavy bow user but I have a 3 star instigating with low weight and something else I forget. Just modded for explosive. It is pretty fun, even with no bow perks
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. ‚ÄúEscape the mine‚Äù is part of the event and doesn‚Äôt complete and issue rewards until they warp you out (you don‚Äôt die if you don‚Äôt escape btw... loot away!).
---
SBQ and encrypts are different. As soon as the beast goes down the event is over, if you‚Äôre killed by remaining enemies you drop loot.
---
This breach and clear thing has been going on for a while now. Well before CP
---
Sometimes I can get the boxes everytime. Sometimes it's once a day and rest are empty. And then a lot they are just always empty.
---
The NCR actually formed a bit after 1 in reality. FO4 even has a blink and you'll miss it thing in Kellogg's memories where you hear the formal creation of the NCR with President Aradesh over the radio.
---
Idk man I never say no to some nuclear keycards.
---
This is absolutly stupid but it makes absolute sense. Thank you !
---
On one of my characters, i have a normal "Home defense" lvl 3. 
---
I have been able to rank up an animated "Home defense" to rank 2 and i can no more rank it up.
---
I even have 2 other animated "Home defense" lvl 1 that i can't combine lol
---
This is absolutly ridiculous !
---
can i just point out whenever the Brotherhood leadership has gone rouge bad things have happened
---
K.
---
Yea. Stealth is the key
---
It was somewhere between the two games yeah.
---
Still too late in the timeline to be the catalyst that fractured the Brotherhood ideals however.
---
You're welcome.
---
Lmao he just used all the cloth we gave him to make us a ton of fatigues XD
---
More. Experience. For. Me.
---
Not grinding outfits but I have had the same misery with the protective and shielded plans for raider under armor. I already never want to Fever again.
---
I tried out the exploit myself, but then got real self conscious of it and built a big ass metal fort on top of it in my camp to try and hide it till i move my camp. Just put one down to have some .308 trickle in and wasnt really worth it honestly cuz i'd have to put down like four at a workshop to get a decent yield, and i dont have 1st
---
If i had known better, i would have waited to lvl a few times to bump up ammosmith and super duper
---
What i find helps is if you kill them quickly.
---
Oh. Thanks, I was almost sure I saw a rep decline when I killed them, it must have been a random raider then. It is odd that there's 2 dailies for raiders and only 1 for settlers. Feels pretty unbalanced as you can make more raiders rep daily than settlers rep based on the link you provided.
---
Nukashine is novel little thing but honestly I don't care about it and I will never use it
---
This is well put, and it's p much how I look at it, too.
---
I'm level 260, for context
---
Fireworks are lame. Fireworks are pathetic. Fireworks are just a few stupid shitty little colorful sparks that go into the air.  Make fireworks great again.

Technically, only one of the Raider dailies is supposed to be available each day. And you do start with negative Raider rep, so it kind of balances out.
---
Also be sure to do both sides vault raid prep quests, up until you have to make a decision. Then do the raid with the side that has higher reputation for you, and then at the end, split the gold. You‚Äôll gain 900 Rep for the **other** side and 300 for the side you did the raid with.
---
Like a player hosted monster mash, Or similar to defending the claimed workshops events that everyone can see but it is your base instead would be cool

I agree, I don't enjoy finding the cargo bots and they can be a pain to shoot down. I was happy when I saw them in the run
---
good luck, in lore a single BoS paladin in T-51B was enough to take on a town full of people or a squad of NCR troopers, there is a good reason there where Three campaigns to try and wipe out the Brotherhood by the NCR during the NCR-Brotherhood war. As a reminder the BoS was winning that war even after being used as human shields/expendable shock troops by the NCR to batter the Enclave with so if pre fallout 1 Brotherhood are coming you are looking at a full regiment of heavily armoured US army vets coming down who have seen combat with the Chines and not a bunch of techo hermits

What do linchboxes do besides a sound and a popup on the side of the screen?

I only sell her shrooms at modest prices from my worker owned shroomery, comrade. No chemicals, no unnatural pharmacology, just simple mycology.

Given their hands and eyes are exposed, I doubt it, not to mention some make suits out of molerat hide (Rockbreakers) and others wear more custom suits (Treasure Hunters). The script notes for their reaction lines to another miner getting killed indicate they don't see death as merciful either.
---
The BoS one collects Ultracite so that‚Äôs pretty nice... I‚Äôm curious to see what all it collects but regardless it‚Äôs a good one to use, especially since it was ‚Äúfree‚Äù
---
Edit: I think I was incorrect with the Ultracite as I think I had my Scavenger one on when I found that.  My bad if so.  Will update again if I find Ultracite with BoS.
---
Next time he shouldn‚Äôt try to use vats with a nuke
---
Well done mate, the detail and creativity in this is pretty awesome
---
you have to build specific things. it tells you when you highlight it
---
Nope it's the first card I'm grabbing
---
This is normal, the vendor does not increase their bank by the amount you spend but by a fraction of it.
---
they gave you power armour and energy weapons so people looked passed their techno hermit lifestyle,  then fallout tactics came out and made then the stars THEN fallout 3 happened and the series died in a wave of fake fans and tribal's
---
Yeah, I did all of the quests before siding, but I chose to split the gold only between me and the raiders.
---
Really is that dumb that I don't see that?
---
I have a russian roulette bowl where its one nukashine and 9 beers
---
No you dont, you only need the crafting mats
---
Looking at the number of available weapons and legendary effects available, getting any thing beyond "ok" on the weapons front is a real crapshoot. Unfortunately you just kind of have to overwhelm her and eventually, the game will accidentally give you something useful. 
---
When I'm specifically legendary farming I try to get enough legendaries for 4 characters to scrip down, with hopefully a bit of overflow. I try to do that once a week, so that when Murmgh sales come up In mostly ready.
---
That poop is full of nasty, disgusting infectious diseases. If it weren't so 'harmless' it wouldn't throw it.
---
It's easy when you know how
---
Did the vendor run low on caps? If they only have say, 450 and you sell them something worth 600, you'll still only get 450 as the maximum. Maybe this happened without you realising?
---
Really? Wow... That's one heck of a profit margin. üòÇ
---
I believe it was more on the southeastern part of the map on the ridge but I don't know specifically it was a good while ago and I didn't record or screenshot I don't think sadly. I know it was near a blood eagle encampment. I'll have to look through my clips and what not to see if I happened to record it and if I pull the map up during it, or I'll look for it in game next time I'm on and let you know. I'll do my best not to forget but it was perfect, I was confused at what the hell I drank and when I woke up I was just even more confused lol
---
I'm prepared to wipe the BoS off the face of Appalachia. One nuke at a time
---
that's all fine and dandy but that's not your original point. your original point was that unyielding was op. why? because of the extra int. you never mentioned any of the rest in your original post(s).
---
you're absolutely right. it *is* the meta, and for a reason. but is it op? first it's important to separate bloodied from unyielding and even melee. they're all three different things, and we're talking about unyielding specifically.
---
the special bonuses are hardly game breaking. yes, you gain more exp than non-unyielding builds. but at the cost of being at 19% health. it's also important to mention that unyielding is not exclusive to bloodied builds, and you don't need to build around it specifically. you can just wear a set when you're farming exp, and then clear out the rads once you're done. it's something every build can make use of.
---
unyielding is hardly op considering the bonuses are superfluous. a bloodied build, or any build for that matter, can play without a set no problem. yes, it's gonna take longer to level up. but it's the same thing if you're not chowing down a cranberry relish every hour. again, you're right in saying that it's the most efficient build. but being the best at something does necessarily make it op. vampire's for example make you immortal, do you consider it op?
---
you also said that there's no reason to use anything else. that's partially correct, because most armor prefixes absolutely suck. bolstering, vanguard's. cloaking. who cares about them. even creature-specific prefixes are better. but keep in mind I said 'partially', and that's because life-saving exists. it's extremely helpful for triggering revenant. so does chameleon, which performs better than unyielding/high agi. and even assassin's if you're a pvper.
---
chameleon for example **is** specialized for sneak builds, compared to unyielding being the go-to cookie cutter. if you want the absolute best sneak, then you have to sacrifice the special bonuses. same with high health builds, because like I said previously, not everyone enjoys playing at 19% health. meta or otherwise. unyielding is useless to them. zealot's is much more useful. so it's not like unyielding is absolute go-to, or that it's op. otherwise it's not something you could forego on, except a lot of people, me included, don't wear it anymore.
---
the bottom line is that unyielding only makes you better at things that you already excel at. it's a bonus, no different than a cranberry relish. it's not a necessity, just a superfluity. it's something most people wear because it's nice, and because there's no better alternative most of the time. not because it's op.
---
I run a Bloodied character and think the nerf is a welcomed change. It's no where near as devastating as the TSE nerf. And 76 is going to hit two years in November.
---
That‚Äôs fine as well. It is a pain to grind either way. I wish we could buy rep with Gold, to be honest.
---
Building in this game is a puzzle minigame,

Went from 6 to 61, otherwise probably wouldn't have noticed

I shall try to look for it thanks:)
---
Brother vault dweller, listen. You have to take a moment and breath. Sure they are nerfing damage. But they have mentioned that in the long run they will be readjusting the numbers. Right now it's a massive pass to see how One wasteland + damage formula polish works in the live server. 
---
They have been working, albeit slowly and sometimes against our wishes. But they are working towards improving the game. I feel it's unfair to want to boycott the company over something like this. Be participating in the PTS and offer your voice in the forums and whenever bethesda communicates with us. 
---
While I don't like the nerfs I am sure y'all love to one shot stuff... I have been seeing lots  of PTS players stream and the damage nerf is not that impacting
---
So you're're not actually boycotting then.....
---
I just go through so much ammo too quickly I'm a stealth sniper build but damn all the enemies are bullet sponges
---
I think so üòÖ
---
It's random.    
---
I did find a set with two T-60 arms and one leg. I had a 51 unique variant helmet and found a t-60 leg. I saw some parts for sale at a couple of player vendors but couldn't recall their names. There are some spawn spots but that doesn't guarantee you'll find what you want.    
---
Fallout 78 is an MMO and a long grind at its core.
---
So why does a quad broadsider only have to load one cannon, but my quad repeater has to load all 25 shots?
---
Not unless I end up with an overabundance of coins.
---
I *may* level one char with it just to hit all the challenges
---
Caravan or nothing
---
I play 2 bloodied characters im ok with a slight dial back. It‚Äôs the nerf to everything as a whole that I disagree with. Melee seems to be pointless now and I dont wanna see the dumpster come the 15th. A lot of people seem unaware its a whole nerf not just bloodied.
---
Technically it's two Groundhogs Days.  For a while time was stuck on 10-23-2102 then then, it was stuck on 10-23-2103...no earthly idea where the intervening year went...one day it was 2102 and everyone was dead, then POOF it's 2103 and there are people everywhere and one of them insists on calling me a newcomer...
---
First time? This is like 4th time they nerfed part of one of my builds. I mean even all the armor was made useless by ss armor. It happens. Gotta keep the meta changing or everything gets stale.
---
Why don't you use the "save" link?
---
I actually think I misunderstood your question because I'm tired and high as a muthafucka rn but you purchased a place from the vendor for 250, the vendors caps only budged by +55? That's odd, not something I can say I have encountered.
---
I found the clip. So if you look all the way to the bottom right at the welcome to west virginia sign. The top left corner of the sign, there is a bear close to it and a little cabin. Its on the cabin symbol. I think it's a cabin my arrow is blocking it on the clip but it's a little up and to the left of the top left corner of the sign, right on the cabin symbol near the bear. Hope that makes sense lol but that's where it is
---
&gt;They were founded by the remnants of the US Army
---
correction they where founded by Defectors of the US Army who after seeing what the US government was doing to win the war said "fuck america" and was planning to die fighting in  Mariposa Military Base after they killed all the scientist and declared their secession. but hey i'm sure your fallout 3 knowledge is better then my decade of playing the series and the brotherhood is just "  imperialistic force that invaded half the world in pursuit of fulfilling their own interests and needs" and not a bunch of Technological hermits who helped kill The Master then aided the NCR in wiping out the West coast enclave
---
A smarter event would have been running and endgame event involving scorched, if it‚Äôs successful there is a new bos crater/foundation type of town, if it fails it ends up being enclaves. (With the other town of course added a few updates later)
---
Just makes the participation more meaningful, i imagine bos would win in a landslide, but if they don‚Äôt meaningful win win consequences
---
friend i bet half the people playing Fallout 76 didn't even know there was a fallout 1 or 2 and thought 3 was the start of the series
---
He keeps bitching to me about some explosives that could have been used to dig a well and how he knows I had my reasons...and I have no earthly idea what he is on about.
---
Oh and this guy that just got there keeps calling me a newcomer...
---
Here's my original post
---
‚ñ™ Let's just say that it's a difficult topic. The Unyielding set really put the game in a difficult situation.
---
Right off the bat, the Unyielding armor set put Bloodied builds in a really great spot as they can get over +15 intelligence (30 and more ! ). 
---
To make it sort Bloodied builds can lvl up much faster than any other builds. And with the addition of the season passes and ESPECIALLY with the addition of the legendary perks...grinders will absolutly want an Unyielding armor set !
---
I mean...i'm no more playing in my power armor. It's just unproductive. I also really would like to go Junkie...but it seems that i'm just better stay on my Bloodied heavy gunner build.
---
It's a difficult topic for sure !
---
can i ask which fallout games you have played?, because i am pretty sure after fighting the Master's army you would have a hate for mutants too
---
I never think to look in my saved tab. 
---
I do, however, often look at my comments
---
There are a lot of tips for new players.    
---
22 is still relatively low considering many things.    
---
For lower level legendaries the one that starts in the Fairground in the Forest is a good one to hit every time you see it. You'll need surrounding locations cleared so you don't run out of time. As long as someone else doesn't get to the Wolf Leader of each pack and the Wolf boss you can net 4 each time.    
---
They're not anything great but you can find something to replace normal gear. If not, you can sell or script it.    
---
1. What is your build? If you can, build it on Nukes and Dragons.    
---
2. What do you play it on? I'm on PC so I can probably help you with something.    
---
3. Many players sell lower level gear and other items for cheap myself included.  
---
4. Keep your CAMP simple.    
---
IMO, PM what questions you have and I'll do my best to help.
---
Thanks!!

The Sloecome's Joe vendor...

Thanks!

didn't expect a hellsing reference today
---
I think you spell it, Fisto
---
Count me as one of them archers.
---
Ffr effect?
---
Third person view.
---
temporary (1H?) random effect (+15 carry weight, rad resist...) and 25%xp boost stackable up to 100% I think
---
Considering the story, gold is still locked up despite there being gold vendors and the press machine in the world.  
---
The main story concludes with a nuke hitting where the SBQ spawns and defeating her in that mission ends the main story. Wastelanders is its own thing and with no spoiling that new players need to be able to enjoy the game like the rest of us.
---
I'm already in 3rd person.
---
One of the stars might be the 25% faster fire rate modifier on it. Thats usually a pretty good roll on any gun.
---
And here's what i meant by this original post...all about optimisation:
---
I‚Äôm ignoring it because I‚Äôm on PC and already have perk loadouts
---
not to me. you first reply to me was:
---
&gt;In there, i jump in my PA and tank the dude...but for meat weeks and all the regular events and daily quests....this is insanity !
---
to which I replied:
---
&gt;I don't see why. I switched to a chameleon set a while ago and hardly noticed a difference. except for the drop in exp. but still.
---
to which you replied:
---
&gt;Exactly, exactly. But if you already play with 15 intelligence and add and other 15 intelligence it really becomes op. Nevertheless...a bloodied build will always make more xp with that armor set, and that's not cool
---
as you can see, you focused on the int/exp aspect of unyielding. you also glossed over my entire previous post and didn't address any of it.
---
That actually helps a little. Thank you.
---
They seem to hate more than just mutants, and I dont like super mutants either, but yeah I've only played 3 and past it. I want to play the older games but my computer shit out on me a good while ago now sadly. I've seen pictures of the master and read how he came about and that shit in itself sounds horrifying and he looks weird as hell too. But I know they did awful shit to people and used FEV to convert more humans into mutants if I'm not mistaken. Don't get me wrong though I'm not defending super mutants lol just expressing my hate for the BoS.
---
Where is the magic "150" coming from?? Are you double counting the perks you gain up to Level 100?
---
* 50 from hitting Level 50 Challenge.
---
* 104 from Legendary Run.
---
* 104 from Armor Ace.
---
**1,542 Perk Coins Needed to max 6 Legendary Perks.**
---
At level 50, you have earned 88 Perks, and can have the max of 56 Perks equipped. That's 32 spare Perks to scrap. 64 more Coins.
---
**1,478 Perk Coins Needed to max 6 Legendary Perks.**
---
You need 411 more Levels to get that many (1 Perk per level up, and 4 more every 5 levels.)
---
***You need to be a minimum of Level 511 to max 6 Legendary Perks. This leaves no room for spare Perks, SPECIAL stat swapping, or glitches removing perks.***
---
HOWEVER:
---
**If you're using up to 6 Legendary SPECIAL perks, you need 30 more Perks to put into your Perk slots now, meaning you'd need to be Level 529.**
---
Now factor in people that want to have spare perks to shuffle around. **You're looking at Level 550\~.**
---
Anything you buy from a vendor, those caps only refill the pool by 25%. 
---
Buy a 1000 cap plan, the caps in the pool increases by 250. 
---
However, there is stil a maximum of 1400 caps that can be in the pool. So it‚Äôs best to sell your stuff first before buying anything from them, so you can in turn sell more and get those caps back.
---
Hi a disappointment, I‚Äôm dad
---
The NPCs are aware and react to your clothing choices (certain ones...). Has anyone put on brotherhood paint PA, or officer uniform??
---
Jack by far is the worst. His "So many pumpkins to carve." every 15 seconds or so is annoying. If I'm lucky, I can get some aid items, gum, a couple of pies, and other minor things after turning in that quest.
---
Once Legendary Perks comes out you‚Äôll be able to scrap your maxed one and then rank up the one you want to keep.
---
I don't think I have any more knowledge than you. I just made my comment off what I have learned in 76, and from the wiki pages. I didn't know the bit about mariposa, but I now I do. I was also using my knowledge of what the actual US army is used for in the real world outside of the video game as a force for US Imperialism under the guise of "protecting freedom."
---
One can hope they will be a force for good, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I also addressed that in my previous post. which you glossed over, as I just said.
---
I know right! At least give us some decent loot if we have to hear that 20 times before we turn the damn pumpkins in!
---
Third person view and FFR trait makes mine fire extremely quick. It is very slow in first person though.
---
Lyons was seen as a traitor by the Western BoS with the Outcasts being actual loyalists.
---
I eagerly hope these BoS do hate us for being a bunch of Muties with no right to be recklessly playing with Nukes.
---
That being said, the bit that we know says the Paladin isn't as isolationist as the rest of the BoS.
---
Good question.
---
And confetti mess, never forget confetti mess (yeah it‚Äôs one hour, honestly those things are so nice, I am super sad I have none left)
---
Yeah i know but i mean lol
---
You know i'm stucked with these animated perk cards since months and months.

It...will...be...about time üòÇ

The communist collectron gives you shit too and being a capitalist, and the raider one talks about cutting you and burning your camp down. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

People like to buy serums so they can have something to sell to the vendor for 500 flat
---
Really liked the bow in the beginning before I got into power armor and it stopped allowing me to use the bow. Haven't tried the crossbow yet. Only issue I had was sometimes it wouldn't nock the arrow when I pressed the trigger down and it would get me hit more than necessary but it wasn't that bad. It was fun to use though and was a more unique weapon for a fallout game. Seems like it would be perfect for a stealth build in lots of RP situations or just for a stealth build in general I guess
---
Old post but I'll leave it here anyway,
---
It is a glitch that Bethesda have been aware off for some time now but can't fix it now that people already have the blueprint.
---
You don't get banned if reported, I know as have been reported for this before, Bethesda could have done something about it but didn't, it's more exploitation than glitching. Once placed they cannot be moved and they can stop working every now and then. It's not hard to do.
---
I mainly do it for the XP of course.  
---
I'm stick of that Tidy quest to clean up goo. The robot doesn't recognize I finished the Tadpole quest. If anything that auto complete bug needs to do it right. Complete our Daily's and Weekly quests while giving us the XP and rewards.  
---
This is Glitchesda we're talking about.
---
Yes. After Rank 100, the Dailies and Weeklies still award SCORE, but there is no benefit.
---
And yet I can‚Äôt stop playing! Doctor please help me
---
I don't like gear or builds that require me to be gimped or something in order for the effects to trigger.  
---
Sweet.
---
I'm pretty sure you can add sights pretty easy. When I used a bow it definitely had a sight on it
---
Lol ugh for sure!
---
The organization has gone through many changes over time. It‚Äôs entirely possible that those versions haven‚Äôt been designed yet.
---
This is impressive ive never seen rep go down and i kill raider on sight.
---
I've been having that problem to. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't.
---
This is going to be sorta spoiler-y so be aware/keep that in mind:
---
In the files/Wiki It's made completely obvious that the 'Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force' is going to focus on helping the people of Appalachia while also collecting any tech they come across. 
---
So in a way the First Expeditionary Force is akin to Elder Lyons/the Desert Rangers of the Wasteland series.
---
In a manner of speaking: Elder Roger Maxson is still very much in charge at this time (2103/04) so his half of the Brotherhood wants to actually help people rebuild civilization. 
---
Already at this time there seems to be hardliners who want to leave the civilians to their own devices/be isolated.
---
Paladin Rahmani however doesn't, she along with her Expeditionary Force (Mostly Initiates/Hopefuls that joined from areas across the US) want to actually help.
---
She's the complete polar opposite of how Paladin Taggerdy was towards civilians/non-military members.
---
Hope that clears it up for you OP.
---
Yeah explosive bows are so fun especially when they send a ghoul rag dolling off into the sky like team rocket.
---
I think it'd make sense if the Brotherhood faction wanted "pure" humans, not mutated ones to rebuild the wasteland. 
---
Thought it'd be cool if the Brotherhood made a device that extracts all of your mutations and makes what the Brotherhood would consider filth or impurities but is essentially a super serum that is a combination of all of the mutations extracted from you in one convienient capsule. Taking said capsule would allow for all the mutations to be reinstated. The catch being the Brotherhood quest for mutation removal would end with you being sent to dispose of your mutations capsule. You can choose to dispose of it and increase reputation with the Brotherhood faction or choose to keep it and take a massive reputation cut. 
---
Just a random idea that came up in a drunken conversation, I'd completely forgotten about it until reading your comment on the Brotherhood removing mutations üòÖ
---
It is and I look forward to the legendary perk ‚ÄúFollow Through‚Äù to further boost my bow.
---
Neat
---
The assault rifle we have in 4 and 76 was originally going to be a heavy assault rifle for the use in power armor but they scraped that idea and just made it the default one.
---
Yeah they can be a pain. I swear I was chasing one cargo halfway across the map before I could finally shoot it down. This was even with 15 agility and max rank of marathoner.
---
They're cool because they're rare, apart from the jumpsuits and scout masks the other rare event outfits look boring. Doesn't stop me wanting to get them though.
---
but i meant people are are saying that the brother hood was evil but i didnt know about them being like elder maxson bos thank you
---
Yes.
---
Personally, no, I've seen full playthroughs though. I know you get basically no choices in those two, and they aren't even designed in a way to give you a choice. They don't pretend to have choices that turn out to be hollow. 
---
 3, NV, and 4 all do give you choices to varying degree, but all get essentially kneecapped by development time limitations. 3 is the most railroaded, Broken Steel effectively nullifies the big faction choice you can make, but does have the best postgame in terms of the "choice" having an effect on the world. NV gives you plenty of choices, but they don't really do anything because there isn't a postgame at all, and the Legion option is barely present. F4 likewise, but even worse, because there is a huge amount of choice, but 0 point to any of it postgame except a couple location aesthetic changes (more in line with the endgame of the NV Lonesome Road DLC). 
---
Then there's 76, where even when you do get a choice there are literally no differences other than a couple quests and deciding how you want to grind for the bullion rewards after the heist. No, I don't want a Wastelanders clone with Enclave vs. BOS and another stupid endgame currency grind, just the option to decide the BOS are assholes and fight them somehow.
---
Id rather tehy just be removed altogether, than be left in its current form, reaaly irks me that all the weapons are left handed being held in the wrong hand, the bows are simply un useable due to this.
---
I'm an Army vet but if someone like Gunny came along I would not last. I would be laughing SO much.  
---
My medic platoon was pretty laid back. We didn't mess around and got our work done. New soldiers always got shafted until they proved themselves.
---
You get 250% more ammo with both equipped, probably the best choice of the legendary perks.
---
Yeah I love to role play with my bow - I get about in full wood armor (shrouded and with the ghillie skin), harness as an under armor and with the ghillie hood and moth man glasses. I feel like a real survivalist and adds a bit of tension knowing that if enemies detect me I can‚Äôt take too many hits and that damage from my bow relies heavily on sneak criticals.
---
If we're borrowing things from Skyrim, I want the combat roll from the sneak tree.
---
YEAS I completely agree as a sneak build
---
I think the bow is left handed due to the pip boy being on the right hand and potentially getting in the way of nocking the bow. But yeah I can see how it being left handed would make it feel unwieldy to most players.
---
Was that you who said that when it was first announced lol when i collected mine i thought to myself" someone on reddit called this"
---
\*sings\* WOULDN'T IT BE NICE
---
Leader of the pack event
---
If the new damage model does apply to NW, I hope they plan on doing a bit of balancing too. The damage nerf will make the explosive META even more toxic. Gun builds rely pretty heavily on stacking at least two damage cards. Explosive builds are viable with demo expert alone. Tubes will still two-shot, grenades will still one-shot and gauss shotty will still insta kill or lag you out. Guns on the other hand will see a ttk increase, especially the low damage ones that are less effective against DR.
---
In that case either instigating, executioners or anti-amor would be best for you.
---
The Wolf Pack event. Easy, guaranteed three legendary enemies, pops frequently enough.
---
Actually did my first workshop battle, lost first match, won the next two which was fun.
---
There of course needs to be balance, I'm not unreasonable. Brahman come back or repair, but I agree pets should be like companions and essential due to how much a pain in the ass it is to get new ones.
---
The PVP just needs some better balance so it's still interesting and viable, but not annoying either and optional.
---
I got the mining mask twice in a row one time.
---
Any fissure site, especially Cranberry Bog ones
---
Yeah, this is not like other fallouts, if you buy something the vendor's caps will only increase by 25%, so you can't recover all your caps if you buy plans or those things.
---
West tek, white springs golf course, or the Charleston capital building
---
It's just words of encouragement. You can always do better! My parents say similar stuff.
---
didnt know that and ive been playing for hundreds of hours. feel like a noob. thanks dude
---
Question; is the BOS collectron a limited time thing? I ask because I‚Äôm away from my ps4 right now and will be until Sunday and I know I‚Äôve missed a few things so far.
---
It's gotten stale IMO.  
---
I got tired of Legendary S1 but managed to finish despite missing a few days and not all of the Score quests.  
---
I'm trying to get all the alcohol recipes from Biv and have good amount. I HATE/LOATHE grinding.
---
Yeah, probably, but most of the pa clips through itself and gets in the way with certain weapons, so why start now lol.
---
Wow... Playing since beta and only just realised this... Lol
---
No problem at all. Hope that explanation eases your mind.
---
Honestly i have no idea why people are worried for, it should be obvious by now how the Brotherhood would react to Humans with F.E.V. based Mutations/launching nukes like crazy. 
---
After all launching nukes is the primary goal that the Brotherhood tries to prevent from happening again.
---
If you own more than 1 collectron version you can use the terminal to change what it collects, so you can keep the communist skin but set him to collect BOS junk.
---
Yeah I was thinking abt that too, and by that point it might be tempting to roll a diff character from scratch and it be quicker to build. Cuz rn I have a high strength and agility type build that i can play as a stealth shotgunner/unarmed, or heavy gunner with or without power armor, and then i'll get the pistol perks last just for roleplaying sake. Which leaves me out from perception, and it'd be to have an alt for commando or rifleman, etc etc
---
I think you have at least until Monday to claim it.
---
Don't know if people can claim previous things like the berret or the flag.
---
I like custom fitted, the extra sprinting time is useful for just running across the map instead of fast traveling, and it allows you to sprint in combat without losing too much AP, very handy if you use VATS alot.
---
I'm still a noob, but helping other noobs.
---
That event kicked my ass?  I gotta help them out!
---
Need to survive?  I got stuff for ya.
---
Need XP?  I can give ya Cranberry.... thing.  
---
Basically, help people enjoy the game.
---
Are there less random Scorchbeasts far out from Fissure Prime since Wastelanders, cuz it sure seems like it to me? Maybe they've reduced the spawns to go along with the story?
---
I could imagine them doing the same with the Scorched. I don't think they'd get rid of them entirely, but I could imagine some of the places where they spawn getting taken over by other groups.
---
But if it's just my imagination and/or coincidence that random Scorchbeasts showing up to wreck my camp doesn't seem to be a thing anymore, then nah.
---
rEmOvEd: RuLe 6
---
That sounds cool as hell honestly lol. The bow definitely has a lot more potential than a lot of people seem to realize
---
Hey! That was me!
---
Yes, you get 250% with both maxed. 
---
Keep in mind though, that Super Duper doesn't scale based off of either.
---
So, for example, if you craft ammo that normally generates 60 rounds, with Ammosmith and Ammo Factory, you get 210 rounds instead, but if Super Duper activates, you only get another 60 rounds, bringing you to 270.
---
I fucking love bows, lol.
---
And even then it had their fair share of clipping , but how hard it is ? I mean, warframe for example even lets we choose where and how the weapon looks when holstered , do you like it hanging as magic ? You can, like it tight for more realistic look ? You can do it too
---
Steal his teddy bears as well then that glorified Preston Garvey won‚Äôt have anything to comfort him while he sleeps
---
As if i'm not already spawning to fissure sites to test out dps with different weapons! Amen. The first recipe i bought from enclave was the berry mentats! Leftover brains make for soup. Sleep on my bed for a few minutes. Always carry cranberry relish. This game is so good for my undiagnosed ocd lol
---
I thought I read that 2-shot explosive guns were still pretty good?
---
Yeah...I felt like it was kinda disrespectful to the person that passed but whatever, titles are important I guess.
---
Honestly a lot of the rules on subs help out with shitposting or spamming but like 60% of them are written improperly so the wrong guys get got.
---
I wall breach into the gold vault and kill the 3 star sentry not, if I get lucky I sometimes get other 3 star spawns
---
What about weasel?
---
I have two Furious ranged weapons and they work for me.
---
I had him for about 20 minutes.  Nope, too much of an a-hole.
---
White springs golf club/the strip of houses or the burrows.. usually find multiple legendary ghouls there at once
---
I agree üíØ
---
Stackable damage is what's getting nerfed so one damage card would still be pretty much essential for a viable build. It probably won't be worth using a damage card+bloody mess though.
---
Leader of the Pack can give you up to 3, assuming no one else participates. "Horde" Events always feature a Legendary "boss," and if you hang around long enough, more Legendaries can spawn. Otherwise there are certain events that have guaranteed Legendary spawns, like Uranium Fever or One Violent Night.
---
You can also hunt areas with a lot of enemy spawns like West Tek or Whitesprings.
---
I can't put a collectron in. I'm glad my camp is maxed because me and the BoS one would be fighting.
---
12000 ammo? twelve thousand? Are you firing a pea shooter? wtf
---
Is elder maxon even alive at this point in time?

None yet.

The only thing i look forward to for it is to clear up the clutter so it's easier to go in and swap out what i want faster. And hopefully not accidently discard the wrong one
---
My guy has a black eye from that event.  So he woke up late not remembering the night before.

btw arent they nerfing unarmed builds into the ground so nukashine is just useless

Same ,I have a fist card lvl 1 aninated,a lvl 2 animated but I use the lvl 3 which is normal. And all I can do is wait for a third animated to drop.

If it isnt an exploit, it is an evil todd howard doppelganger
---
What lvl is your main and what's your build...and also how old are you ? 
---
You know that perception affects your V.A.T.S hit chance ? You know that Agility affect your amount of AP and sneak capability ? Luck affects the recharge speed of your critical bar ? 
---
The Unyielding set helps in all these aspect. If you are using this armor set you need to be low health. It benefit bloodied builds. For bloodied build there's no point to look into anything else. It even boost Charisma, strenght and intelligence. The ultimate armor set for bloodied weapon users is the Unyielding set.
---
If this dude is taking a Cramberry relish he will do more xp than the dude who is not using an Unyielding set. Is it more clear kid ? And that's a problem. It makes the armor way too powerful.
---
Not only the dude who dont wanna play low health have no extra Perception, strenght, agility, charisma, luck but he even can't have the extra intelligence that the dude with low health is having...
---
That's a problem ! 
---
If this dude in the Unyielding set knows all about xp buffs, no matter what this dude will do, the guy in the Unyielding set will lvlup faster than him.
---
That's a problem ! It's not cool !
---
well here is some history for you, The Brotherhood piro to the Master's army where a group of Hermits that rather then going out into the wasteland stayed locked away in a place called Lost Hills only ever sending out small scouting groups to trade with settlements, then one day they ran into a group called the Vipers a raider gang that used poison arrows and they killed Maxson the 2nd which lead the brotherhood to go on a war of extermination wiping out the raiders.
---
Cut to 2162 and a guy in a blue jumpsuit shows up calling himself a vault dweller and asking for help with the mutant problem sometime later there is a massive explosion and beings the Brotherhood-Mutant war in which [the Brotherhood has to drive out the Remnants of the Masters army from California](https://youtu.be/yXFOlVtVZDA?t=488) then spends the next part of a generation helping the NCR rebuild while staying out of the power struggle.
---
then we have the next major event the splitting of the Brotherhood shortly after the events of the war with the Master's Army the Brotherhood sent a large portion of it's people east to chase after what's left of the Master's army only to end up forming the Mid east Brotherhood and fighting the Brotherhood-Calculator war [here is how bad that war went (yes that's a TANK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFljWP_F9wg)
---
after this there is the NCR/Brotherhood-Enclave war in which the Brotherhood used their Technology to help the budding NCR take on the Enclave in which the Brotherhood where used as Shock troops to break Enclave lines while NCR provided the weight and numbers to help the Brotherhood hold ground. Then the bad stuff happens to the Brotherhood after discovering the danger of some of the Enclaves more powerful energy weapons the NCR starts demanding the Brotherhood teach the NCR how to use power armour while the Brotherhood outright say that giving Energy weapon schematics to groups like the Van Grafs will lead to more danger then they could understand lead to the conflict known as the NCR-Brotherhood war.
---
so following the Events of the last splitting the Brotherhood and taking horrific casualties fighting the Enclaves shoreside forces you can guess how slow but sure a war of attrition with the NCR lead the Brotherhood to as a result of this war the Brotherhood mandated and i quote "fuck everyone who is not us".
---
The Brotherhood has seen all the evils of the old world and sees them again in things like the NCR and the Institute, when the Brotherhood says they are protecting technology they don't mean things like water purifiers or lights they mean things like chemical weapons, highly advanced weaponry and armour that back in fallout 1 and 2 made you near unkillable outside of end game weapons. There is a group in Fallout New Vegas called the Fiends a lot of them use energy weapons and in large groups they are dangerous to the player even in power armour now give those Fiends Power armour and make them sober and they could take down half of Vegas in a afternoon and keep pushing to the damn by evening, that's what the Brotherhood is afraid of and why it guards it's secrets like a dragons hoard. 
---
The Brotherhood can't just open up and start recruiting because it never goes well, The Midwest Brotherhood have massive defection problems of people stealing power armour and high end weapons then taking over towns, Lyons brought people into the fold who where clearly not capable of being good soldiers and got more people killed and defecting from him then any other chapter in history things go bad for Brotherhood when they open up to the outside whether that be mass casualties or in some cases creating worse threats then before the Brotherhood has been made into an isolationist/xenophobic group by the wasteland itself more then "we hate mutants, ghouls. people who are not us and advanced robots for no reason"
---
Awe dude, this is awesome! Cant wait to try this out. Was considering junkies to be part of the build
---
depends on what you think "good" is, would you stop raider tribes learning how to use power armour to be a good? or how about stopping a bunch of people activating a orbital station full of nukes?
---
In rare cases some users have reported overdosing on berry mentats and mutating into a todd howard super mutant from excessive exposure to wes tek in a nuke zone
---
There is a solo mode, its an option you change before entering the lobby.
---
Roger maxson yes. Arthur maxson no.
---
So many people were shocked that my level 350 is unmutated and only launched the one nuke needed for the questline. 
---
*polishes his T60 while looking smug*
---
Don't forget furious builds as well.
---
Hear that shit a home, now I log in and hear it again! My wife wins again. /s
---
Yesssss please!!!!
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a fun community event but it‚Äôs terribly designed. Killing scorched for clean up Appalachia was a lot more fun
---
They're honestly just super hit or miss whether the game wants to give you a fair chance at them lol and damn they move fast lol
---
If they're anything like the Brotherhood and marine ones, you have to buy the previous linings first!
---
Look for anti armor aswell. Come sept 15, the new damage formula makes junkies only do 5% moe damage than AA when all factors are considered.
---
This post has actual numbers from the PTS comparing bloodied,junkies and AA. Clink his results hyperlink, the guy did a nice job..

How would it make any difference?  There are no legendary enemies and not a lot of perks to stack.
---
Some of them go down easily, while others I chase for 15 minutes while half the time they're outside of the range of my gun
---
I just started playing again after the disappointment at launch, what does the collectron even do?
---
When you‚Äôre at the home screen and you select a nuclear winter, the bottom, on Xbox it is X button to toggle on or off team fill
---
edit-or do you want an option to be solo and play against only solos?
---
Wait you can just... get... a used ID card printer. Presumably on the internet somewhere. And do this.
---
W h a t
---
We are already be given duplicated perk cards...
---
As you can see i have multiple lvl 1s...
---
The game don't even reconise i already have an "Home defense" rank 3. I even have a normal "Home defense" rank 1...
---
I have one "Home defense" rank 3, one animated "Home defense" rank 2, two animated "Home defense" rank 1 and one normal "Home defense" rank 1...
---
Unyielding would be the best for bloodied.
---
Just collects whatever items it is set to collect.  There are different flavors of them, some collect weapons/ammo or chems/alcohol, food/items, junk/scrap, etc.  It‚Äôs like having a node being farmed.
---
What does raider one collect?
---
What system are you on?
---
Oh how do you set them to something? i thought you just build it and it does stuff.
---
The matches will never end! XD Slappers only it'll be!
---
The orange flag was hung by that dingus collecting supplies though, yeah? üôÉ
---
Honestly I‚Äôm hoping their the bad guys, even as I role play in a BoS server.
---
It would add a refreshing different look at the work of fallout, especially with how the raider groups are very fleshed out and less 1-dimensional than previous games
---
Mirelurks, scorpions, stingwings, and  scorchbeast farts.
---
Sort of yeah just a matter of finding one that works and still prints well enough. The new printers aren‚Äôt cheap though most new ones are upwards of $1000, with some close to $5000.
---
If they're Lyons style and attempt to help the settlers that's good. If they want to sweep in and set up a military state with martial law and forcing people to do what they say or face death would be not good. That would make them high tech raiders. If past games are anything to go off, raiders learn how to use Power Armor whether the BoS intervenes or not. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.
---
Worst case scenario they become a new opposition to the players and will have to deal with high tech murder hobos, best case they become tech hoarding hermits we only have to interact with if we choose to. I just wonder if they will be worked into the main story and if they will recapture Fort Defiance or it will still be an abandoned outpost?
---
Ps4
---
They had an auto crossbow in FarCry 4. It was hands down the best stealth weapon.
---
Was wondering myself.
---
Treasury notes pls. &lt;3
---
I have a j50rw western you can have, add me PSN is MidRoad-
---
It *would* be pretty interesting if they had functionality though
---
&gt;What lvl is your main and what's your build...and also how old are you ?
---
290 and 220 something. PA and commando, both bloodied. about the same age as you if your nick is anything to go by.
---
&gt;You know that perception affects your V.A.T.S hit chance ? You know that Agility affect your amount of AP and sneak capability ? Luck affects the recharge speed of your critical bar ? 
---
weapon range is more important than per. if 300 ap isn't enough, then 450 won't be either. exemplifies what I said perfectly, 'unyielding only boosts things you already excel at'. AP regen on all pieces also means there's virtually no difference between 300 and 450 ap. chameleon makes you stealthier than 30+ agi. you can get a 1:1 cycle with a 15% vats weapon as well.
---
&gt;If you are using this armor set you need to be low health. It benefit bloodied builds.
---
you're looking at it backwards. it benefits bloodied builds *because* they're playing at 19% health. it's a bonus conditioned on a penalty, not a privilege.
---
&gt;For bloodied build there's no point to look into anything else.
---
like I exemplified in my previous post, chameleon is a more specialized alternative for sneak builds. but even then, quoting myself again, that does not mean unyielding is op. just that there are no better alternatives. although chameleon is an alternative, and one that aids sneak builds specifically at that. and so I switched from uny to cha.
---
&gt;And that's a problem. It makes the armor way too powerful.
---
and what's your metric to call it 'too powerful'? extra int? I guess we're going in circles now. *a weird hill to die on*, a stupid metric that means absolutely nothing. again, anyone can use unyielding armor. it's not specific to one build. anyone can soak up rads and then clear them off once the farming's done.
---
&gt;Not only the dude who dont wanna play low health have no extra Perception, strenght, agility, charisma, luck but he even can't the extra intelligence that the dude with low health is having...
---
I just said this, but you seem to think that playing at 19% health is a privilege. it's not. it's a penalty, one that rewards the player with those bonuses. bonuses that are by no means a necessity. they're just... bonuses. no different than food or chems. **bonuses**.
---
&gt;If this dude in the Unyielding set knows all about xp buffs, no matter what this dude will do, the guy in the Unyielding set will lvlup faster than him.
---
&gt;That's a problem ! It's not cool !
---
I guess we really are going in circles now.
---
it's not. play bloodied or don't have access to those superficial bonuses. it's a minor thing that's not going to make or break a build. it's simple.
---
Leader of the pack, uranium fever and Riding shotgun
---
Uranium Fever also has three legendaries, however it depends on if you‚Äôre playing with people who won‚Äôt insta-melt them or not... in my experience, usually it‚Äôs ok. Usually....
---
Ok, so I have a full set of unyielding armor that I use, but it's obviously not SS. 
---
The guy at vault 79 has a TON of SS plans, so I don't know which ones to buy.  I don't see unyielding SS. Do I just need to check back tomorrow and hope he has it?
---
There will still be max and min levels
---
Would love it.  Bow is my "serious" weapon. There's something satisfying with aiming a bit high and "plunking" a guy from a long way out. 
---
Would like your thoughts - I'm using instagating compound with cryo right now. Is the noise from explosive worth it?  Thought it broke stealth?  
---
I mean a lot dies one shot from 1,200 damage without it?  Plus the cryo slows them sometimes to help get the 2nd shot off?
---
This post hurts my brain
---
Second this.if you can't find a legendary after these 3 places your in a dead world.
---
Lvl 50 gun. Character wont be able to use it for some time cuz she is still below lvl 10. Just stash it if i do get it i guess
---
Another way for them to half ass their jobs!!! Just like every other aspect of the game
---
You buy the SS armor plans and make it at a bench. You make legendaries from the craft, But, the legendary effects are random. 
---
You either get lucky and make it in one go or take over 100+ crafts to get one piece of unyielding.
---
I recommend when you are crafting to keep a vanguard if you get it and store it. I almost have a full set of both. It‚Äôs a good idea if you want to switch between full hp and or bloodied.
---
Finally a weapon to surpass Metal Gear

Right, a little tempted to cash in before Mischief night comes back.
---
IM NOT WORRIED YOU ARE ü•∫üò≥üòÇ
---
I don't know if they could set a recharge rate on an aid item, which otherwise would make the canteen incredibly more powerful than it sounds. 
---
Making it work like Brahmin milking or a rain water collector would be fine for rate of use, essentially counting as 1 drink from a purified water source. maybe just link it to your purified water collector similar to how some mods handled collecting "water bottles" in FO4 survival mode.
---
1. I don't really have a build, but if i were to guess i'd say food/water rad protection.
---
2. Pc gamepass
---
I meant to say chems.
---
You buy the plans to make the armor (chest, right arm, left leg, etc) then you also need Legendary Modules that you can get from Mumbles the Purveyor. Then you craft them and hope you roll the stats you want. It works the same for the weapon plans you buy with Gold too.
---
That‚Äôs a classic line from so many support ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have the tools to change [x]‚Äù but somehow hackers do lol.
---
Yea its reduced wieght so it wont take up much space,  than you ll have a decent peice when level 50 comes.
---
I have others and dont use it, rather see it go to a good home.

Im heading out of town for the weekend tomorrow. Shoot my a friend request whenever.  If i see ya on, ill meet up with ya.

I‚Äôd totally watch this horror movie
---
Yeah and whole: everyone running more mutations than super mutants thing too might not fit into their idea of human
---
Unyielding is usually the first choice but Bolstering is also a good choice if your a ranged user vs melee.
---
This is a good read before crafting SS armor [crafted 300 pieces of SS armor](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ij674n/i_crafted_300_pieces_of_ss_armor_and_recorded/)
---
I also got the Halloween suit and short suit but I sold the short suit for 5000
---
Bows are super fun for stealth, or for practicing on lower level enemies.
---
Ok, now my turn. I‚Äôm herbivore, everyone gasps, I live off of corn soup, challys feed and cran relish. I know cookings a pain but with good with salt I only have to do it maybe twice a week. Can‚Äôt beat +2 luck and 20% xp. Random juices for bonuses when it‚Äôs go time with Earle or sbq
---
This is great. Just makes me wish that the Sims had first person mode. That would ruin my productivity forever.
---
Yes. I cant guarentee I was the first or only, but I definitely responded to multiple posts with this answer when weeks ago lol
---
How do you get bows? Is it along the lines of the fixer as in you needed to know the plan to get them random?  
---
I'm def not caught up, just found about that secret service armor
---
Original collectron is best collectron. Other collectrons are IMPOSTERS.
---
Damn, that's definitely a lot of shit to go through. I can sort of see why they'd think it's better to just shut themselves off from a lot of the world. And I played NV so I know about the fiends and they are a considerable threat, so I get that. I still don't think that gives them the right to act all high and mighty and lord over everyone else as they tend to do.
---
I understand the desire to protect tech weapons and armor as they definitely give an individual massive amounts of power, but I feel that even if they had met another group (this is theoretical of course) to that handled themselves and their people well and treated everyone fairly, and this other group also had powerful tech weapons and power armor, they would do anything to take it from them, even if it many outright murdering them. 
---
In many cases it does seem like they have good intentions, but I feel they will do anything, even if it's incredibly bad to secure the tech, even if it isn't in dangerous hands. Its sad that after having all of these bad experiences they couldn't learn and grow from them, and they instead allowed these experiences to revert them back into essentially hermits, just super well equipped hermits that care solely about themselves and their one purpose. 
---
If they spent more time trying to be a governing force in the wasteland and they did it better than NCR (I don't like NCR either but that's another story), id understand them thinking they are superior. But they walk around insulting wastelanders and treating them as inferiors, all just because they have all the good gear. They look at regular people just trying to survive as a waste of time and space, and they won't help them if they don't have to. 
---
From what you said, they went from being hermits to helping others and actually seeming to be a decent group with power that used that power to help better the wastes. And they turned right back into hermits and just said fuck everybody when the pressure became too much for them to deal with. But rebuilding the world is something that will take a lot of losses and a lot of work, and hoarding the tech and secluding yourself off isn't going to contribute to that in any way. That's the main reason I can't stand them.
---
They act superior and they have no real reason too, other than that they could kill you in a blink of an eye if they wanted to and the post apocalyptic world beat their asses a few times. 
---
Does that make sense or nah? I appreciate you telling me all that and the links, helped me realize they weren't bad in the past at least and they have reasons for being so reserved.
---
People complained they wouldn't have enough time to complete all 100 levels and screamed bloody murder about being ripped off on a free event, then people complained they don't get anything more free when they completed 100 levels of free stuff, screaming bloody murder about being ripped off on a free event.
---
Poor Bethesda, they fucking can't win.
---
So we wont need 9 damage cards for commando? Just use the 1st one of each for ¬≥‚Å∞ damage?
---
Get the chest and jetpack first, tons of fun and convenience. No legendary effects can be purchased though. Get legendary modules from murmrgh and start rolling.
---
Dang there's a lot of spelling errors.
---
I know 76 is already rated mature, but I don‚Äôt know if adding in game gabling like that (where players can bet against each other) crosses any lines in any countries. 
---
Beyond that sure.
---
Plasma
---
It does but you have usually (always?) 2 options of things to gather and the collectron has a terminal attached (does NOT require power) that allows you to change what it is collecting.  You can also choose different collectron options if you have more than one unlocked and in that scenario the collectron you have in your camp is just using the skin.  So for instance you can have the BoS collectron ‚Äúskin‚Äù searching for the Raider collectron ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù of chems/alcohol.  Hopefully that makes sense but there is another person that explained it in a little more length that might be a better read.

---
Taking people‚Äôs shit.
---
It‚Äôs in game currency only. And besides. They already make us gamble with the amount of loot roll options exist for legendaries
---
It also collects Plasma Cores and Plasma Cartridges too. Definitely rare though.
---
Everyone keeps saying that. You can delete it and just move Camp and you camp budget is back.
---
You'll still benefit from 9 damage cards but significantly less than before. Legendary perks, mutations and chems that boost damage will get hit hard too.
---
What we really need is a tie in drinking game where you take real world shots each time you drink a Nukashine. That would make the 'Buy or Sell an Item to a Player' challenge much, much more interesting.
---
Ramblings of a vary tired man who already has issues of being clear lol. Long story short, Fallout 4 was balanced to where you didn't need legendaries, they just improved gameplay. 76 makes them almost a requirement. It also makes it so late game some guns are just not worth it without god tier effects.
---
More details if you like, I'll try to be clear.
---
Now they're late game meta that none legendary gear feels detrimental to gameplay. This on top of already unbalanced base weapons. Hunting rifle in 50 cal shouldn't need more rounds then an assault rifle to take down a enemy. Snipers shouldn't need to count on stealth or instigating to feel like they make a impact. 
---
Example: Dearhclaw at max distance just barely staying on screen before disappearing closed that distance in 4 hardened 50 cal marksman rifle hits to head and belly. Doing less then 15% damage that if I didn't switch from that rifle to the 1 star anti armor handmade I just got I'd have died. No upgrades, not even a full mag finished it off. 
---
Perks were 3 stars into rifle damage and antiarmor rifle damage.
---
Nice! Never got the short suit or pirate hat. Now that I think about that event had really cool rewards. I had alot of free to run it. If the trend continues of making last years "rare" event rewards more obtainable might have to start searching for a bargain before Halloween.
---
and oil, fertilizer, and prisoner collars...
---
For real, and also a stealth backpack. Sadly bethesda just keeps adding plushies for backpacks, it's like they think their audience are 8 year old little girls.
---
Those lunchboxes helped my reputation with all the high level players when doing events I really had no purpose doing. I open about 6 of them bitches before the event starts and I get thumbs up. Sadly now...I‚Äôm almost out and will surely be shot on sight.
---
Monkey paw wish granted, bandolier 3 non stacking backpack mod that reduces ammo weight. It will be multiple skins released over time.
---
Yeah I was asking mainly bc I heard they were bringing back previous rewards from other phases of the game  like the Unstoppable Monster but I just wanted to confirm it
---
Why would he have a legendary perk in an armour mod list?
---
You do understand how it works right?

Catering to new players, nukashine is only good for random over encumbered fast travel

There‚Äôs a big difference between RNG and an actual display of people dishing out cards.

I mean Red Dead Online has to region lock gambling: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/bp9bie/online\_poker\_is\_region\_restricted/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/bp9bie/online_poker_is_region_restricted/)
---
It‚Äôd be the same thing on FO76.  
---
So it would come down to: is it worth it to program it for the areas that can have the gambling
---
The only point I disagree on is the nuke cards. I dont have a problem with them being included because they are neccessary for ACP &amp; SBQ and think its only fair for those willing to do the silo runs to get them easy.
---
But yeah the Nukashine, nuka cola and other quest/event loot drops is lazy af and completely worthless fill. Whenever i look in my inventory now I have 300-400 frigging stim packs Im lugging around as it is thanks to event drops. Same with water and radaway. Half the time I cant even sell them all to the bots because of the shitty daily caps limit. Maybe theyre there to include new players who may welcome them but I honestly dont think its that hard for new players to acquire them in game either. The seasons are grindy af as it is.
---
Have my upvote for the 'dying a martyr bit'. Shine on, you sarcastic fucking diamond.
---
Actually It's not. 
---
Early to mid game the impact is none or minimal. Someone with a basic weapon &amp; 1 buff will have zero impact. It's once you start to scale multiple buffs that it becomes a problem.
---
The only thing majority affected are scumming alts with low level legendaries high tier &amp; chem buffs to punch way above your weight for massive xp boasts. Now you'll mostly have to play like casuals, which is perfectly fine in my books.
---
Since your offering me it, Ill happily take it off your hands. Thnx so much for the help!
---
I can't speak for the regular bow, the plans can be picked up so quickly and legendary bows are so rare that I have no idea. 
---
But compound bows for sure you need the plans before you will find the legendary versions, I found a dozen or so regular bows and not a single compound before I got the plans.
---
Be nuts if Bethesda had a checklist like they do have challenges but this works.
---
Cranberry relish .. you make it to level 400 and you get 100 levels for using cranberry relish. It gives you 25% xp
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that America wouldn‚Äôt have a problem. I don‚Äôt know if any laws like that would cause Europe or Asia to be locked from it
---
Ok, so I should ignore the plans for buttressed,  deep pocketed, etc.?  Or are those not full plans, just mods?
---
Luckily I have 20 legendary modules already and 1000 scrip.
---
Absolutely
---
I get it but think of the subject. Bethesda can't even go a patch without introducing a previously fixed bug. Version control systems are decades old &amp; Bethesda somehow lacks the competence to manage one.
---
Perk cards and weapon mods are effected, upgrading the gun and having one perk card was a huge impact in being able to actually deal damage in the early game, with how hard everything is being hit its going to be much harder to deal damage, particularly since the weapons that are going to be hit the hardest  "rifles and melee" are the go to early game weapons! As you do not even get commando or heavy gun perks till much much later!
---
Noted. Thanks!
---
I have a feeling that because it's called "Fractured Steel" we will get 2 or more subfactions of the brotherhood, one that will want to take over and one that genuinely wants to help. It all kinda screams that they themselves don't all agree on what to do. Like they all start at Atlas but as the story progresses we learn more.
---
Either way I do hope we get the more friendly Fallout 3 bos, heck they might even pull a fast one and make the other half go join the Enclave or something.

If you read through the RDO people were saying many of the same things: ‚ÄúBut gambling is legal here‚Äù and ‚ÄúBut we aren‚Äôt using real money‚Äù.
---
I don‚Äôt care to argue the point, I‚Äôm just saying that there could be barriers to any mini-games that look like and feel like gambling, so there‚Äôs a good chance they wouldn‚Äôt even go down that path.

For what I‚Äôm aware of explosive arrows don‚Äôt break stealth because the noise from the explosion happens on impact and not from actually launching the arrow itself. 
---
And in my experience cryo arrows are helpful against tanky enemies that have detected you such as Yao guai‚Äôs, gulpers and sheepsquatch‚Äôs since it‚Äôll slow them down as they attempt to get into melee range while you keep firing on them.
---
Thanks but I am on Xbox. Love this community.
---
They are such insulting reqards considering how long it takes to level up  on that map. 
---
The entire season is very lack luster and it feels like they deliberately shifted any good rewards to the last quarter of the map. Last season at least it felt somewhat balanced to get crap repair kits and caps and then a good reward every so many levels. 
---
The grind just isnt worth it.
---
I‚Äôm a lowly level 54 and killed my first 3 star today gutsy, just to be rewarded with a one star meat hook :(
---
Yes they are and I quite like how explosive arrows can sometime send ghouls flying off into the air.
---
But does it reset if target damages someone else?
---
Buttressed, etc, are the mod plans. You'll still want them to mod your armor once you get the right Legendary effects that you want. But first I'd get the actual armor plans and get to rolling, unless you have amazing luck!
---
Well they know players here have low standars so why do better?
---
Pre war money
---
Yeah they are similar to the fixer in that you need the know the plans to find legendary versions although you don‚Äôt need to know the plans in order to buy legendary bows from other players. From memory you can get the bow plan for free after doing some quests for Duchess at the Wayward and you need to get the neighbourly status in reputation with either the settlers or the raiders in order to buy the plan for the compound bow.
---
Those of us who make nukashine should flood the market and make it worth even less than now
---
Thanks. I just bought the chest piece, both arms, and both legs.  That was expensive! Only 750 gold left.
---
Same, I'm level 257 and only used a Mutation once (Marsupial, disliked it on the spot) back when i was level 50. 
---
When i start placing the pieces together that Mutations were F.E.V. in a tiny vial (Was level 75 at the time) i sworn to never touch them at all after that.
---
Speaking of which: If you compare the 'Toxic Goo' to 'Serums' you'll notice how they're the same color/look.
---
Seems lame
---
Like Robocops autopistol? That would be awesome. 
---
Either that or a magnetic holster (like Halo Mjolnir armour has)
---
5.56 is more common than .45. you really shouldn't share your opinion on things like nerfs and buffs if you don't have all your facts straight.
---
all the misinformation on this sub does enough damage as it is.
---
I think a missed opportunity in 3 and NV was that the heavy weapons didn't holster on the backpack. 
---
Something like the Heavy Mandalorian from star wars attaching his Minigun to his Jetpack would have worked really well.

Thats not solo mode, that is just making it so no one can join your team. Everyone else will be on a team of 4.

Now im like fuck this shit bro, you are a troll. You got me hard there lol

Yes I didn‚Äôt know to much about the game and I didn‚Äôt know I was getting cool drops now my life is going to uranium fever and enclave savage divide I just want the scout mask so bad I could have bought it awhile ago for 9000 but I just have to win it I think I made a bad choice because that was like 7 months ago
---
that's not an argument. then again, you haven't really addressed any of mine thus far, so.
---
Little tip, instead of using a bed for the well rested bonus, use the fire pit that you can sit down now. It last two hours instead of one
---
Rank 100 is really disappointing, that power armor doesn't come close to the rewards for this season. Most of those armor and weapon skins look like slightly modified responder, free state, and last season skins already in game.
---
Is this a perk or
---
I just experienced this. Holy crap that was freaky
---
Maybe after a while the Secret Service guys could leave the gold vault and join up with MODUS.
---
So I just crafted 21 pieces and got one unyielding. Luckily it was a 3 star.
---
Replace them with Possum Badges, or Perk Coins.
---
Pretty sure everyone's Enclave whose done the main quest because you for some reason have to join every fucking faction lol.
---
The evidence just doesn't support your case. It's trivial if you bother to do the math.
---
Let's say basic weapon does 10 damage per shot for simplicity's sake. 
---
1 weapon perk card adds 20% so total damage is 12 for both current &amp; new systems so absolutely zero impact.
---
Let's add sneak attack 2x bonus ie +100%.
---
Current system: 10 + 2 (+20% perk card bonus) + 12 (+100% sneak attack of previous totals) = 24
---
New system 10 + 12 (basex(20% + 100%)) = 22
---
So the damage difference is 2.
---
For a 100 health enemy, you're shooting exactly the same number of bullets for both old &amp; new ie 5 shots. Nothing changes in practice. 
---
For 500 health enemy:
---
Old: 21 shots
---
New: 23 shots
---
Oooo... Big difference... 
---
You do your own math. Unless you stack many buffs &amp; go against a massive health enemy, the difference is negligible.
---
It will be really good for daily ops where stealth is not an option.
---
 I don't understand the description tho. Does it work only for your team or for anyone shooting(including yourself)?
---
Also as the other guy asked,does it work like furious?
---
That's not an explosive gun. That's a ballistic gun with an explosive effect.
---
And tse has been very meh since the nerd. Terrible accuracy and breaks 4x as fast as a standered weapon.
---
For the damaging effects it goes

Faster fire rate is also better than explosive for a second since bosses basically ignore explosive damage
---
TBF I didn't put much effort into this current Legendary Run and I'm at 98 out of 100.  Only really hit the challenges hard on the double-SCORE weeks, and I think bought three ranks with some leftover atoms I had from non-SCORE challenges.
---
Point is, bulk majority of my SCORE came from just playing normally without any focus on the challenges.
---
I assume it‚Äôs intended to stop players circumventing the cap limit per day by buying items they want anyway. Sell some items, buy an expensive plan, sell more items, continue until you‚Äôve sold everything and bought everything.
---
Yeah red shaped you know... like round colored
---
But really, is there a reason we can‚Äôt just put ANY skin on any weapon? Why does it have to be specific skin to specific weapon? Even making a base of solid colors for all of the weapons seems simple enough. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy and want to re-skin my gauss minigun in nuclear material green. Just a thought.
---
Theres bows? I'm a new player I dont know a lot
---
Yup!
---
Charleston Capitol!
---
Yeah you can get the plans for the regular bow from doing some quests for Duchess at the Wayward.
---
Did raiders questline last character so on this one I'm  doing settlers to avoid Ra-Ra (bethesda is glad they dont let me murder children) and weasel.
---
Well the game is about to get tougher, man.
---
Even the "Follow Through" legendary perk card: Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 40% for 60 seconds.
---
I mean combine both these cards in a team. A tanky PA build and a sniper build ( if he can manage do go hidden ). It's gonna be nuts.
---
Bethesda is probably planning to add some really tough content in the future and we will eventually probably need some serious buffs and debuffs. 
---
I mean bro...one wasteland is coming and will nerf our dps and scale enemies lvl to our lvls. Once flooded by them...it's clear we gonna need more specific builds ( roles ) to buff and debuff them.
---
BoS are greedy, lazy shit heads, they get the plasma hose.
---
I cant wait for fallout 78.
---
Use it at close range, or with vats
---
Cranberry bog and Ash heap maps also have a chance to award t60 plans. Very rare though
---
Dont forget the alcohol and drugs.
---
Yeah how dare anyone criticize obvious psychologic manipulation to keep them logging in everyday
---
Bos bunker for me, and army floor tiles.
---
I was honestly very happy when the bows was added to the game, I roll 3 different legendarys ones on my weapon wheel. Each for different occasions and works pretty awesome for my stealth build! üëçüèª
---
Ohhhhhh right! I totally forgot about that one. Good call
---
That's weird. I've never had a shotgun that shows just one number when you hit a target, unless you miss them mostly and only one of the 8 pellets hits. Something doesn't sound right here.
---
It was broken last patch, there‚Äôs a workaround, find it at the bottom of this page in the Bugs section
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/An_Ounce_of_Prevention
---
I am, my instigating shotgun does about 600 DMG per pellet, can't believe this anti armor is so shitty
---
So have you punished OP by removing his membership, paid for atoms and in game items for your mistake, surely you see how scummy this makes you look, I'm still waiting for my Crowns back after Zeni removed my legit ones from ESo after the same fuck up a few weeks ago, your company and partner companies are looking completely incompetent.
---
Nice! And yeah bows are great with stealth builds. I like to wear shrouded wood armor (with the ghillie skin) for the extra sneak speed and to look like some wild survivalist.
---
Even gauss weapons have 1, and they are the newest entry.
---
(Gatling plasma fans want one too ya know)
---
Heeell yeah! And the range is pretty awesome to, enemies never will know what hit em.
---
Nobody:
---
Actually nobody:
---
Bethesda: *trigerred*
---
Perhaps the ability to craft a 'Smooth Nukashine' that doesn't have such a severe penalty could work nicely.
---
Is it just aa or anything else? Also is it modded?
---
Na I'm using vats so it's not missing, the damage is all messed up and idk why, my instigating pump does 600+ per pellet in vats
---
Yea fully modded with 25% FFR and +15 vats Crits fills
---
Boat motor.
---
Brown dog barking at my backdoor ~Carl Brutananadilewski~
---
no he doesn't. that is why he is asking.
---
It could be that the instigating is a magic weapon and the aa is just aa
---
If you get a magic armor piece the shotgun will be severely better
---
Keycards are only hard for melee builds.  Otherwise it's just a chore to wait for the drone to pass by to shoot it down.
---
Magic armor piece, like what?
---
Any armor that says reduce damage while blocking by 15
---
It makes your shotgun in vats do crazy damage
---
And his paper cutter!
---
It‚Äôs worth nothing to me I just play the game I‚Äôm only around the 50-60 mark
---
Short range. Get up close and personal. Or mod it to have better range.
---
I have the two before but can‚Äôt for the life of me get the next to drop.
---
I‚Äôve also been just getting kicked back to the home screen a lot and most of the time it‚Äôs during events and I‚Äôm almost done
---
Oh baby
---
And clip therough the npcs? No thanks
---
Yeah!  Especially if they are self-aware enough to realize they are being manipulated!  How VERY dare they!
---
That's not the problem
---
Dude scrap kits rule.
---
Lol, i just ran into an npc who was ALL about that.
---
Not that worried about it to be honest.  If I had Unyielding it would be too inconvenient to switch to any other armour set because I would be overencumbered.
---
As long as I have a fair fight and don't have unbreakable glass or plot armor in my way, I'll use a Bloodied Plasma Flamer, Explosive Laser, Bloodied Gatling Laser, or even a Cursed Pickaxe on them if I have to.
---
i wish power armor users could use the bow.
---
Keycards are fine with me for a reward as long as it's a stack of at least five.
---
They have significantly less use for FO1st members. There are very few instances in which I would need/want to send scrap to my stash box but I am not able to deploy my tent and deposit it directly to my scrap box instead.
---
Yes! These would be awesome!
---
How do you get a jet pack that isn't related to power armor or secret service armor related?
---
You don't even know how much damage I'm doing now
---
But seriously. Nukashine is in CAMPS free to drink, and in vendors all over the place. It‚Äôs already easily spoiled by players. Heck, people drop it or give it to newbies at Vault 76 for a laugh every time there‚Äôs an influx of new players.
---
Its good?
---
Seriously! Its not like every major publisher including Nintendo arent doing it so vehemently thats it appears normal and overlooked
---
Make sure you‚Äôre nuking prime fissure after you have one on Earl. It‚Äôll trigger ACP again and you‚Äôll have two events.
---
Hasn't it been two years already?
---
I gave up on the Ra-Ra quest when the last bit of getting her toy was glitched. I‚Äôm not sure if they fixed it yet. I try to hang in the balance now just enough to where I can walk among the Raiders and not get my sh*t pushed in.
---
They drop from queenie.
---
Oof I thought there was another way. Thanks for the reply!
---
I'm on PC as well.  
---
If you PM me we can continue there and not clog up the post.  
---
The Nukes and Dragons site that's pinned on this sub is a must. I'd bookmark it in a Fallout 76 folder.
---
Todd feels bad for all the bugs, exploits, and problems. So he‚Äôs giving away free atoms. Rejoice!!!
---
They have left the server. Go right ahead.
---
Don't even get me started with that Rad Kit Bundle at Rank 23.
---
I can't believe they even considered it, let alone put in on the board.
---
Check out the Deep if you've never been there before.  Awesome cave!
---
&gt;	13 perk card packs in total provides 104 legendary perk points and is equivalent to around 29 levels.
---
I think your typod.
---
104 perk cards is not the equivalent of 29 levels 
---
104 is actually equal to 59-60 levels (the 60th level unlocks another pack which would put it over by 4 and 59 level puts you under by 1 at 103 perk cards.)
---
59 levels = 59 perks +11 packs 
---
11 packs = 44 perks 
---
59 + 44 = 103 perks 
---
You get 104 perks for 2 seasons 
---
(Which is why it ends up a tad more than 59 levels, but 59 is good enough for an approximation)
---
So I assume your 29 figure was either a typo or an accidental miscalculation. You meant to say each singlur season of 13 perk packs, which is approx 29 levels (again 30 levels puts you over and 29 puts you under)
---
Just for some extra quick maths I think we needed 533 levels to max out all legendary perks. We wanted to do that without using our current perks at all and just our season bonus perks it would take 18 seasons to do it.
---
Yessir!!
---
One of the upcoming Legendary perks
---
And then once you agree to help him he starts giving you grief if you don't immediately hop to it.
---
I haven't finished the main questline still nor ACP.
---
YEAH!  .....wait... I've lost track which side of this arguement I'm supposed to be on....
---
;)
---
I'm not at my CAMP for long anyway. If I can turn up the A-hole meter to keep enemies away I'm good.
---
Ive said forever that the valley galeria should show items in person. Remodel a few stores and update them when new items launch so we can see them in game. 
---
Like the beds that are scaled improperly so we could decide to purchase them or not
---
Yes I‚Äôm constantly doing uranium fever and enclave savage divide trying to get a scout mask so I also do the enclave mire to try and get those two coats
---
Because otherwise dying wouldn't matter. When you die outside of events, you drop your junk, in events, you don't drop anything, so it increases your timer.
---
Punishment for dying repeatedly
---
ARE YOU SERIOUS THATS THE REASON?!
---
Sucks that we have a bunch of cool weapons like this that are just nowhere near viable or heck, even usable.  Not sure why they even exist.
---
Do BoS quest in Fort Defiance you get a free set of ultracite PA and learn the plans as well also the many reasons it sells for 10 caps
---
Oh 
---
You wouldn't happen to use that instigating in vats, would you?
---
Now he tells me!
---
I've actually got it set up now so the house itself is only on top of the cliff. Then if you find the cleverly concealed fireplace door (you know, the one that reveals itself as "fireplace door" as soon as your cursor touches it) you can drop down into my Cat Cave where I keep my crime fighting gear. Which right now isn't much, just a couple of cat paintings and one of my trusty .50 machine guns. I'm going to put in some mannequins with outfits when those show up. Then the only way out is either fast travel or picking the level 3 lock I've got closing off the cave from the outside.
---
I'll probably set up some kind of stair system to get down to the ground, because I have no idea where fast travel is going to drop off any visitors. And crap, I just realized I haven't set up my vendors yet.
---
I was using both in vats
---
You cant display them. I have had mine just sitting in my inventory for months hoping one day they would fix this KNOWN problem,  but yeah.
---
Yeah I does suck but I can see why they couldn‚Äôt in universe - I‚Äôm assuming the arms of power armor couldn‚Äôt stretch into the position to fire a bow.
---
More than 10, my friend.
---
The biggest thing they need is a way to have a larger clip. They can‚Äôt take out crowds very well save for a quad crossbow.
---
To encourage you not to die.
---
I will concede the next weapon skin, only after the Super Sledge receives the proper Fallout 3/NV model.
---
I do hope that all existing weapons get some love eventually as far as skins are concerned though.
---
he needs mod plans
---
I just had multiple characters, but I had to retire them once the rep and currency grinds were introduced
---
Yeah, I'm currently playing a full-health melee build and will definitely max this perk out day 1.
---
Oh woops I read it wrong
---
Effort helps this not happen
---
There is another one that came from the dev room: Sentinel (BOS VI)
---
I have it learned but, like the Power Armor winterized paints, I think Bethesda wiped the plans from player‚Äôs inventories and only the people that learned it in time can still craft it.
---
So you get punished for being bloodied melee?
---
Let me rephrase then it can not only drop from queens but Scorchbeast as well but not a very high drop chance to get
---
My man i talk about the right to play with our favorite optimised builds while grinding xp  as fast as possible to upgrade our Legendary perk cards. And you keep telling this and that and this and that...
---
If you aren't a troll bro...man i really tried my best.
---
You didn't even tryed to give me a possible solution, you kept fighting for your opinion. It's not me who has to address something here. It's you who chose to address something here.
---
All you needed to say was..."why not take away the Unyielding's intelligence buff !? It would put everybody on the same lvl and everybody could stay on their favorite builds. No need to go under 20% health to maximise your xp gain"
---
Nothing bro...you gave no solution. All you kept saying...was the Unyielding isn't only for bloodied build.
---
It's like ok whatever man !
---
The intelligence on Unyielding set give to "some" optimised bloodied builds an edge over other type of builds.
---
I think they have a tiny chance from dropping regular scorched beasts too
---
I went after fall damage armor from the start simply because I hate power armor and love jumping off of cliffs.
---
"I know where you sleep at night."
---
Ace is the best collectron, I always laugh at his threats and insults.
---
Give me a This Machine skin for the combat rifle and let me mod an SMG into a Laser RCW and, and I know I've said this once today, TAKE MY MONEY AND MY SOUL
---
No. You get punished for being bad at it.
---
Yeah, like people said, to have a penalization.
---
The problem is when you don't respawn at all even if it's your 2nd or 3rd death and you have to restart the game.
---
I totally get it, its just a bummer. i envisioned a huge steel bow with huge steel arrows. heh.
---
That depends, is said bloodied melee running with dodgy, serendipity, barbarian, ap regen buffs etc? Bloodied is glass cannon mode, so you gotta respect your weaknesses.
---
Make sure there isn't one in your stash as well!
---
Should have done that again with special drops from them. Annoying they're so lazy with this game.
---
Either Juicehead or InnovSurvivalist (both on youtube) will get you up to speed as they tend to focus on news and features.
---
It's not that the AA is shitty, it's that instigating is glitched. 
---
I got the Fancy shotgun which prefix is AA but it's secondary is glitched and it does crazy damage too.
---
There's no etiquette to it. No one is owed a workshop, whether or not they build it up. 
---
Quite the opposite actually. It's one of the few remaining areas where players can contest the site with PvP.
---
Yeah, it just looks a little wonky, hence my comfusion
---
The raider one is my favorite. I love his abuse.
---
love it
---
I bought one a while ago thinking I could display it.. then accidentally scrapped it and basically screwed myself out of the Mr. Fuzzy tokens lol
---
I understand. That‚Äôs the downside of bloodied is being squishy but doubling respawn timer is a dumb punishment. You die so you get to be bored. That‚Äôs so stupid. You die you lose loot. I don‚Äôt understand why it has to be anything more than that.
---
I'm talking like the new players that for some reason have atoms.
---
Well thats some bullshit, sorry friend.  Guess if it happens to me ill just spend them... But slowly.
---
and please buff the damage ffs
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn‚Äôt allow bartering posts.
---
there is a new boss, his name is Earle (pronounced Earl) gotta kill him and his babies. seasonal event called the Legendary run was added.. but season one of it is almost over
---
I also agree with this. I have ways had to lock both the terminal and the container.
---
Would also include angry turtle on YouTube! He is awesome for information as well.
---
You try ricochet too? Vastly overlooked and misunderstood. *Deflect* as in avoid.  
---
Theres gotta be a downside to dieing though, otherwise its a faceroll with zero  incentive to try.
---
Then where do I post? I‚Äôm just asking for some help and didn‚Äôt know where else to go. This is the fallout 76 reddit right?
---
WTH man. Ok, thanks!
---
Not as unethical as the lvl340 that gathers up ingredients sits there and doesn't deposit them...
---
We definitely need FIDO, the Stealth Armor Mk II, and the Atomic-valence tri-radii-oscillator.  The Protonic Axe and Saturnite Fist would be nice additions.
---
The Palace of the Winding Path. It has such unique architecture (maybe add some of these assets for CAMP building, Bethesda?) and it also has great views too.
---
I‚Äôm not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be a punishment. I‚Äôm saying making your players stare at a respawn screen for a minute isn‚Äôt encouraging them it‚Äôs making them want to get off the game.
---
I can get behind this. It's been more then once I've forgotten to grab my Stealth Suit before joining the event... It's pretty important for when the event is over and I spawn back in the nuke zone.
---
What does it look like?
---
Thanks very much for the kind advice :D
---
What's the/a plan mule?
---
I dunno, im used to drop everything on death so a minute respawn doesnt seem to bad personally.
---
I like the idea that they're some sort of semi-feral ghouls derived from the thousands of miners in the area who were underground when the bombs went off. But that wouldn't really explain their numbers "now", after years of being slaughtered by everything else. To that point, the numbers of feral ghouls don't hold up that well either. So basically, they're a thing in a game, and have no discernible society or method of reproduction like every other game. There's nothing deeper about them.
---
Like 80% of weapons need a complete rebalance.
---
Turtle is one of my favs overall but for a news/features catch up video, personally I think the others are better for that.
---
For me, Turtle is in a similar class to Captainnoob i.e. game mechanic, builds and weapon videos.
---
Congrats! Im level 104 and i still havent launched one (never had a team or specialization so i was way under powered) but the quest glitched and completed. Still, im excited now that i have a team to do it legitimately and congrats again!
---
Wearing a piece of armor that gives +15 while blocking seems to increase the damage by a fair bit, up into the hundreds or more per pellet
---
Caravan would be legit a fun addition.
---
ITT: BoS aligned "white knight" players that started with FO3 think Lyon's kumbaya-my-lord samaritan division was the real BoS.
---
AGreed, in the area with the benches near where the mine opens and everyone waits for several minutes would be perfect.
---
I never even considered this as a way of getting back in there. Thanks to your comment I was able to get back in the vault and pick up the huffwarbler hairbrush I missed the first time around.
---
Death should have consequences.  I like it, it makes me want to not die in a game that has such minimal threat from death.
---
And his axe!
---
Yeah, its disappointing. Wish I could give you a better answer.
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
Pretty much what everyone else has said - so you can't just brute force your way through an encounter/quest/event/boss/etc.
---
If you're dying that often that you need to wait a full minute before respawning, maybe you need to reconsider your strategy cause it sucks.
---
What are ya talking about, all those "just got super rare outfit/gun" posts are just bartering posts minus actually putting a price, almost always see people start the barter here and move over to Discord or something to finish the deal
---
That's a paddling
---
‚ÄúStrategy‚Äù it‚Äôs a casual pve game. Wtf do you mean ‚Äústrategy‚Äù
---
Thanks. I did check the wiki but it‚Äôs not clear which mods will make it auto or not
---
Why would there be a stashbox at Monongah? It makes zero sense. There's none at the SBQ event. There's none at the ISS event. Don't see what it should be any different here at all.
---
But why would a society that has micro-fusion reactors for everyday energy even bother with coal? Not to be a bummer, but the concept of the whole West Virginia mining industry in FO76 makes zero sense. "We have all of this more or less unlimited fusion energy all over the place, but we still kept mining coal because...?" Maybe Donald Trump was the last President and just kept dumping tax dollars into a dead industry to win votes from proto-moleminers.
---
Start with working out how to not die repeatedly.
---
Had this happen to me I think on Collision Course
---
I haven't seen it in action, but I'm secretly hoping it's just a copy of that lunchbox confetti effect.
---
In any case, a couple of the perks are for melee hits, so I'd be interested to know if the explosions hurt *you* as well. Hopefully they don't.
---
I was kind of happy to see the keycards...
---
I agree. Low levels have no place at a limited space boss event. Even with one wasteland coming. I think bosses should remain an end game activity and shouldn't scale down.
---
Wish they'd put a level floor of 50 on acp.
---
i was in a group with a pair of level 25's, the rest of us carried and the lowbies tried their hardest, but mostly acted as Spawn decoys
---
I'll pm you the sub. We arnt allowed to speak its name here
---
Whos on xbox i got a junkies bow
---
Yeah, people that are essentially not taking any part in a event that is a limited instance is shitty.
---
Enclave deserve no love.
---
Dude... you're dying constantly in this "casual PvE game" as you put it. That speaks volumes right there.
---
Cursed pickaxe sells for 1k caps, and the mask is an even rarer drop than that, so... more than that.
---
Considering they went in without a plan to deal with being in the radiation zone later on they might have had no idea what was actually happening and just joined an Event the game told them was available.
---
I feel it's a different concept for the SBQ event because people can set up survival tents. At ACP you can't just leave if you run out of ammo/stims
---
It should cause more wendigos to spawn, which is good if you‚Äôre using the event to farm xp/junk.
---
I don't know about wrong but you come off as a bit of a d-bag. 
---
Better to just be classy and just ignore them. 
---
If they're willing to take up a slot and not at all contribute to the battle, I don't think they've give a shit about someone acting petty and immature.
---
Be the classy one. Ignore them. Maybe even block them so that you won't be "cursed" by their presence in future but otherwise just let it go.
---
Unless they've fixed the bug, turrets can sometimes aggro on each other, and destroy other things in the process (due to their inaccuracy).
---
The fallout 76 website
---
Yes please! I have a crossbow with the quad prefix on it and plasma bolts, I love this thing a lot And use it very often. It‚Äôs awkward at first cause you have to ‚Äòload‚Äô in 4 separate shots (unlike NW where you reload once but you shoot 3 times). It has a silly glitch that if you have more then one bolt loaded in, have quick hands perk on and use vats, you can fully auto shoot bolts like a assault rifle! It‚Äôs so much fun.
---
Anyways back to what was mentioned, we need above but also to add is fix iron sights on bows (don‚Äôt have compound yet) to be useable, fix sights on crossbows so they stay on, more mods too such as carbon fibre frame/stock, tactical Frame/stock and the ability to quick fire bows.
---
You PS4 mate? Level 530 would love to help you roast some things. üòÉ
---
I honestly really like using the bow, but the thing that just makes using it weird for me is it being left handed (like the sniper rifle) but that‚Äôs only due in part of the pip-boy. Other than that it‚Äôs a really fun weapon to use.
---
yeah nah this will take more work than fixing half of the game breaking bugs
---
Yeah. It's called preparing for an event. 
---
Same with the vault raids. Either you entered prepared or you made do with what you had.
---
You're asking for the training wheels to be put back onto the bike. It's really not that hard to prepare for the event. You're given plenty of time in the beginning to do so.
---
It would help. I use Super Duper so sometimes I've gone way over what I actually wanted &amp; then become overencumbered, thwarted by a full stash &amp; unable to scrap say ammo...
---
People say theres nothing to do, but i never found enough time to do all the things that i enjoy.
---
Explore and discover the sectrets of appalachia while listening to the radio. 
---
Buy Stuff, Selll Stuff and improve my business
---
Build a new CAMP on a new and better location with all the new cosmetics i unlocked
---
Keep finding new plans to build new things
---
Play massive events like the Queen or the collosus with friends
---
Special timed events like fasnatch, meat week and Halloween
---
The inexplicable feeling of change in appalachia. First with the arrive of wastelanders and now with the upcoming BoS.
---
I was reslly skeptical about the legendary run but ive learned to love it and i really enjoyed it. 
---
The variety of weapons, enemies, world areas
---
&gt;i talk about the right to play with our favorite optimised builds
---
no, you talked about unyielding being op. because of the int bonus. which is laughable.
---
&gt;while grinding xp as fast as possible
---
grinding legendary perks isn't all there is to the game. if you want to make your build geared towards that singular purpose, more power to you. but that does not mean unyielding is op.
---
&gt;You didn't even tryed to give me a possible solution
---
there's no need for a solution if there's no problem. unyielding is fine as it is. keep nerfing bloodied builds and then there's no reason to play at 19% health anymore.
---
&gt;you kept fighting for your opinion
---
quote unquote, 'opinion'
---
&gt;It's not me who has to address something here
---
no, that's not how argumentation works. you said unyielding is op because of the int bonus, on top of several ludicrous claims. I presented arguments as to why those claims were wrong. you never addressed my arguments.
---
&gt;All you needed to say was..."why not take away the Unyielding's intelligence buff !?
---
to that end, why not remove the str and per bonuses as well? can't have the agi and luk ones, either. and let's not forget cha. 'no need to go under 20% health to maximize your melee damage, or anything related to special'. except there is, that's the whole point of bloodied. or do you think someone with a vampire's weapon who's at 0 risk should be able to perform as well as someone about to die? makes no sense.
---
you have an unhealthy obsession with intelligence and exp buffs. I said this a couple paragraphs above, but I'll say it again: **there's more to Fo76 than grinding legendary perks.**
---
&gt;All you kept saying...was the Unyielding isn't only for bloodied build.
---
&gt;The intelligence on Unyielding set give to "some" optimised bloodied builds an edge over other type of builds.
---
literally any character in the game can pick up 5 random unyielding pieces, soak up rads and then farm xp. and once they're done, hit up a decontamination arc, unequip the unyielding pieces and presto.
---
...or not. because not everyone has this craving for exp points that you seem to.
---
this is literally a fact. I don't know what's your problem with facts.
---
It does way more damage now, also I had an explosive pump shotgun I forgot about cuz I thought it was shit but using it while wearing magic armor makes it insanely deadly
---
I‚Äôm guessing you were smirking at your own comment thinking you roasted me but your comment didn‚Äôt make sense. I was also referring to the colossal problem event. 
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù pve game meaning i couldn‚Äôt care less when I die, I‚Äôm trying to have fun and when I die I‚Äôm forced to be bored. You are quoting me saying like it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcasual pve game‚Äù. If you are trying in a casual game where you are killing AI, (which i can tell you are) ‚Äúthat speaks volumes right there.‚Äù
---
And I‚Äôll beat you to the punch by saying.
---
Idc when I die.
---
I care when I‚Äôm not allowed to have fun and when I‚Äôm forced to be bored
---
Is there a sit were I can see the patch notes of 22?
---
Time to whip out the explosive bait
---
should be under resources, like the other collectrons
---
Yea...what's your problem with the facts ? lol you fucking troll lol stop playing with it lol ‚úå
---
Nevermind, I just had to buy the collectron bundle
---
You nuts man lol
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have had to buy anything
---
No. I have him and he collects mostly wooden blocks, boxing gloves and stuffed animals as scrap items, he has no options in the menu to change what he collects.
---
Unfortunately, no...no matter how hard I try,
---
I know, I had to buy the basic collectron pack to even be able to see my christmas and Bos skins.
---
that's also not an argument.
---
It collects more than the things we have had to collect for atlas, seems to just be a general junk collector
---
Yup limited time like the rest event items 
---
Theres the BoS military fatigues as well with the collectron dont forget to get them as well!
---
It's still useful if you have any of the other collectrons unlocked. You just have to use the terminal on the side.
---
I was in a team 2 days ago &amp; they all were up to lvl 200, except for one lvl 264. A lvl 22 bravely took the munitions factory &amp; I kid you not, for 40 minutes, all that came up on my screen was that the lvl 264 had killed the lvl 22. It was shocking. I fast travelled to figure out what was going on &amp; noped out because all 3 of my high lvl teammates were marsupialling the rooftops taking shots at this poor lvl 22. 
---
In the time it took me to message said lvl 22 &amp; tutor them on how to turn on Pacifist mode, that lvl 22's team mate nuked the munitions factory &amp; the lvl 22 left the server. 
---
Never laughed so hard at seeing justice being done ü§£. My team mates left that area &amp; never went back. I left their team &amp; went to a less toxic one.
---
Anyway, if you're in a team that high lvl &amp; decide to bully a litle lvl 22 - you should be ashamed. You probably upset that person to the point of uninstalling. And giving them a terrible experience. Just don't do it. Please &amp; thanks.
---
Looks like i cant send you a chat request
---
Yup
---
Well, my main character is a relatively high level but I had switched to a level 3 character to get a set of chameleon armor to give to a 50-ish level player. When I fast traveled to his location I appeared in the mine. Immediately I thought oh sh-t! I have a level 1 pipe pistol with literally 40 rounds. I didn't know he was going to join the event and I know how high levels feel about low levels joining an event they're obviously not prepared for...so I stayed up top. I did level 3 times from the XP, got a great level 5 three star weapon, and the rare helmet. 
---
Point being, it could of been accidental, lol.
---
No dude. I'm replying to someone who is a little slow. There's nothing to smirk about or get imaginary points for or whatever. 
---
I just feel sad for you. That's the truth of it.
---
Remember, you're the guy "crying" about being "punished" for having an increasing respawn timer in a casual PvE game. The skill ceiling is very low for this game and yet somehow you can't even clear that.
---
You're right it would be sad if you were really trying and did poorly. I don't put that much effort in and do just fine, like you'd expect. 
---
You can't even manage that. Those were the volumes I was referring to.
---
I'm just going to stop here. Feels too much like punching down now. You do you.
---
BoS were the anti-heroes of the setting. As in, they were selfish, self-absorbed dicks that just happened to make things better for everyone else by taking out even bigger, more dangerous dicks. Lyon's BoS in FO3 was cheesy beyond belief, and I was glad they were back to their old ways in FO4.
---
Everytime I‚Äôve had low levels in ACP they always do that I‚Äôve never had one do any good
---
I play a pistol build from the start. I know EVERYTHING about pistols.
---
So you want a pistol build. What do you need?
---
To begin with, decide - will you play with or without stealth? Full health or bloody build?
---
A bloody build with no stealth.
---
You will need TWO Plasma Pistols. The ideal option is B2525 and B2515r. The first one you modify for a sniper barrel and use it for mobs and distant enemies. The second - with a flamethrower barrel, we use it against bosses and powerful mobs standing close.
---
Here's the build itself:

---
Bloody build through stealth. At least two pistols - 45 tube revolver and 10mm pistol, B2525 both. We change the 10mm pistol to an automatic receiver with an enhanced crit, it will receive a boost from the gunslinger perks. Ideally - three pistols, 2 10mm one auto, the second semi-auto.
---
Here's the build:
---

---
Western revolver, 44 revolver, pipe bolt action pistol, laser - everything will be unplayable. These builds are the best in terms of damage. Some points are not allocated there - put what you think is necessary.
---
Semi-auto 10mm can be replaced with 38 pipe pistol. You will receive little less damage, but cheap ammo
---
Ah, thanks.
---
I have never bought a collectron, I have only claimed the two free ones. So unless they changed this one and it's just a skin...
---
It's free.    
---
It's in the FREE tab at the top. When we are earning things in Season or something, it doesn't show up the moment we reach the goal. I've found it under a Free tab when opening the Atomic shop. Double check before you get something like that.
---
You should say what console you‚Äôre on and if you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôm down
---
It seemed like they planned to just stand around and not contribute.
---
I don't have all but I've found most of them in player vendors.
---
So it‚Äôs just a skin? It‚Äôs not like the raider collectron?
---
Its a different item than the base, but it would not even appear in my build menu until i bought the basic collectron station pack
---
I want more fireworks too! üéÜüéá‚ú®
---
Interesting. Cuz the only one I have is the free Christmas one and this one showed up when I claimed it, seems like a mistake
---
That instigating shotgun is a magic weapon, it's doing a lot more damage than shotguns should
---
If you see lots of pellets hitting for different numbers, it's magic
---
I suggest you be quick about it. It only showed a couple of days for it, when I unlocked it.
---
Yes sir magic is so fun I hope it doesn't go away
---
I did check, It didn't show up in my build menu until I bought the basic collectron pack.
---
Thx
---
I‚Äôm in the way to finishing it too don‚Äôt want anything just want the completion and the dirt tiles üòÇ
---
Ik, my christmas one wouldn't show up either, just the basic one and the raider until i bought the pack
---
Wtf thats kind of backwards
---
Yep, pretty tired of dumping 3k to 5k .50 cal into Sheepsquatch and SBQ, only to get a rubbish 1* legendary useless. It's soul destroying. Battles like that need to be rewarding so you come back for more.
---
I will say there are some really creative players on here. I had a guy who would make traps to kill players walk me through his camp. If you went the correct way, you're good but go the wrong way or get nosey, you pay. I know a number players on here are brilliant...just wish they'd do it for fun and reward those who die instead of taking their loot.
---
Yeah but isn't Bethesda going to nerf the enemy levels and make them a wee bit stronger? 
---
We'll be doing damage to the enemies but not as much as we are now is what I'm hearing.
---
Remember when dying used to make you load your last save point from over an hour ago?
---
Those were the days.
---
I spent 3 hours looking for one piece of copper to build the bos collectron and still don't have the last piece of copper
---
I think he would like it. I know I do.
---
Dirt tiles are life
---
Welcome to how I felt after the first season of Destiny 2. The 2nd season started and suddenly everything I earned in the first was tossed aside in the hamster wheel race to earn the new rewards.
---
Sorry man xb1
---
I think it's under the Resource tab. You might need to arrow L or R as there are different versions of the Protectron Scavenger.
---
Nah, it should be a quest reward for completing "One of Us"
---
All good
---
Shhh... it‚Äôs okay.
---
Standard collectron and Fascnaut collectron are here for you. Just huff the gas from the pipe and everything will be fine.
---
Not the gauss rifle.
---
Ace the Raider was the best thing to happen to collectrons. I'm never replacing mine, unless the planets align and we get Insult Bot collectron.
---
When do you get that raider outfit? Maybe I scrapped mine too. Hahaha
---
Bro that was fallout 76. That stuffs old news fallout 78s the real stuff.
---
Seriously?? Jeeeez I thought for sure there was.
---
Yeah you're right but it's convenient and I don't see the big deal about it ü§∑
---
Maybe he's claiming your camp.
---
Best to PVP him till he learns not to try and claim your camp.
---
Go home Sunny, you're drunk.
---
Right if I did it by accident I might also stick around to see if I could collect the loot. I'm a lvl 213 and contribute before anyone gets defensive lol
---
What‚Äôs your GT
---
And i'm saying that a Bloodied build combined to an Unyielding set gives an unhealthy edge over all the other builds in the game. Remember...it just more benificial to play on a bloodied build when you use an Unyielding set. Bloodied weapons are the stronger ! 
---
And apparently it can take you over 500 lvls to rank up all the legendary perk cards. The Unyielding set is too strong with the extra intelligence...it pushes players to jump on bloodied builds. Not only to gain more dps but also to gain more xp at...any time of day. No matter what you do...you gotta go low health and grab a bloodied weapon if you wanna maximise your gain of xp while doing your dailies. Dailies are also affected by your intelligence. But hey...the xp gain is minimal, right !? üòë
---
I've pointed this out before (as have many others), the entire design direction of this game, which I ***really really really*** want to work, is clearly being managed by a former mobile game exec. Every decision they make reeks of ad and micro-transaction based mobile gaming, not a console/PC MMO. It's so fucking depressing.
---
Abbie is my favorite but I have a soft spot for Ra-ra. I'd like to adopt her.
---
Shields
---
Anyone know where I can get such plans for the propellers
---
That‚Äôs fucked up. I have a friend that has a puzzle camp but he has a legendary weapon or armor at the end for like 1 cap. The guy that made the camp you explained is an ass
---
A lot of vendors sell them, windmill generators.
---
I'm really excited about a LOT of the goodies in this season 2. Ya know one thing I don't like though? Still showing no love for the MMG. I love my MMG &amp; I need a beautiful skin for it that lets it know what it means to me.
---
Exactly the same as the Elder paint, but instead of the three diamonds, it just has one
---
https://gyazo.com/8f90b0fb8a45606b6af3c1ab21701906
---
https://gyazo.com/7b0bb0d544fd4da53bc75996d7dfcdf0
---
Guns and ammo or chems and booze. I personally keep mine on the chems and booze routine, collects a lot of stuff I use - and the rest sells for caps.
---
Thanks for the answer, now it's clear. My old mini has basher's prefix, which explains everything...so it's not fixed yet. It feels pretty ironic though, after grinding and obtaining a theoretically stronger weapon, the stronger one turns out to be weaker than a bugged one:D
---
I imagine it would look like the great bow from Dark Souls. That would be kick ass shooting scorchbeasts out of sky with one of those.
---
Same here...I got down to the final 4 three times only to lose to a group of three. So frustrating. However; I joined the last time to set out a camp 3 times for a daily. I accidentally went in team mode but thank goodness I did. A teammate gave me a Grenade Launcher with 40 grenades. We both got down to the last 5 and she got killed by a scorchbeast sneak attacking 1 on the other team. She was about to take out another when she was hit from behind by the SB. I managed to kill the last two mainly because they were engaged with the SB when I showered them with grenades and kindness, lol. Haven't played it since.
---
The real champ should have been my teammate, she was good and without her I was toast!
---
I usually run into this issue. I've learned to throw some sort of poster down then put the weapon racks over it.
---
Same problem, but with the red asylum outfit.
---
If you can tell me any specific ones I‚Äôd be grateful
---
Yeah unless your a bloodied or junkies build bows and crossbows will often be a secondary weapon.
---
Completely disagree about keycards. Yeah they are easy to get in this game. But crazy tedious. It is not fun predicting where the cargobot will be by the time you have loaded to him only for it to zip on past at 100mph 2 miles in the sky. Meaning more load screens. 
---
I welcome anything that cuts down on me sitting staring at a load screen for even longer than I do.
---
Agree about nukashine. If i want any I'm craft them. They will be dropped as soon as i get them. I dont have luxuries of carrying stuff I dont use because of limits.
---
Awesome idea!
---
Turns out I was wrong, they can possibly be obtained by powering up any of the power plants.
---
[Ammo and weapons] and [Chems and Alcohol]
---
The weapons scale with your level as well, so if you're level 20 you should get level 20 guns and melee weapons
---
I wish we had a proper glow sight upgrade with pins or other distance markers that actually ADS in first person. Bows are soo satisfying to use regardless :)
---
Maybe defend the Colossus Wendigo against other players!
---
This is refreshingly honest.  I am a rampant murdering cannibal dressed as a Cultist.  They just want to worship the  L A M P in peace.
---
Or not.
---
Whatever. 
---
I'ma eat you.
---
Skyrim is the best game ever!!
---
Completely agree. The more keycards the better. Anything that even remotely eliviates the tedium of silo runs.
---
Love this idea...get some of the old weapons from games past!
---
I‚Äôm picking it up. I love going around and looting random places, but often ignore terminals and locks because I can‚Äôt be bothered to switch my perks.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Funny thing is that, while I understand why most players find the bow being left handed unwieldy, I‚Äôm actually left handed in real life so to me it‚Äôs feels normal lol.
---
And yes the bow is very cathartic to use for me as well.
---
To ignorant on such a non important issue that you don‚Äôt even care to read my comment and actually think about and consider what I‚Äôm saying. You completely ignored everything I said in my comment and just insisted on using ad hominem attacks. Feels bad man
---
still going in circles I see. getting tired of repeating myself if you're not going to even bother addressing my arguments.
---
I'd hardly call the special bonus from unyielding an 'unhealthy edge', as I've said before. reason being that it only adds to things you already excel at. you don't need it in order to succeed, it's just a nice bonus.
---
you're also still fixated on the idea that the legendary perk grind is all there is to the game. no, bloodied/unyielding is not the best. it has the highest dps- **at a cost**.
---
some people don't like that cost. a lot of veterans chose the junkie's way because it's almost as efficient without the risk. and some of us prefer to be invisible thanks to chameleon rather than having a bunch of unnecessary special bonuses. others even prefer to use vampire's and be immortal. there's more to the game than efficiency through bloodied.
---
your obsession with exp is giving you tunnel vision.
---
Yes very satisfying especially the initial sound explosive arrows make when they make contact on an enemy.
---
Same here!
---
‚Äú10 others‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah and I would use PA but since the game is glitched I gain 150 pounds whenever I enter PA for some reason
---
Congratulations! I maxed it out a couple weeks ago, and have been slaying with the gauss shotgun...
---
It's not just you. For the 6 slots I'm planning to take Taking One For the Team, Ammo Factory, Master Infiltrator and 3 legendary SPECIAL perks. The other perks don't seem worth it to me (except Follow Through but I'm not a stealth build). PA perks are also fucking terrible...
---
I may hold out to see if loadouts make the switching easier before I make the decision on Master Infiltrator.
---
Ra-ra is so goddamn annoying idk what you're talking about.
---
Yeah given the speed to which it takes to nock the bow I also find I get quickly overwhelmed quickly by crowds of enemies when I get detected. I‚Äôm also on a quest to track down a quad crossbow which sounds like a delight to use, especially outside of Nuclear Winter.
---
Visable weapon hulsters in general would be sick.
---
Yeah lol. As I said in the first edit there are more bow users than I assumed!
---
Would be a welcome addition.
---
Probably not, because the engine isn't designed to function that way, I'd assume.
---
We can't even have ladders.
---
And look at the ammo converter.
---
I'm not even sure it's supposed to support multiplayer.
---
And it's wonky at best, there's lots of clipping with many weapons
---
KL-E-0 from Goodneighbor would have been...ummm...damn romanceable.
---
They would. I would love to have my lever action holstered on my back like they did back in New Vegas.
---
It could give the effect of longer flight time
---
Does anybody have the 3-headed Colossus stand Plan for Xbox.
---
Then Bethesda needs to stop sitting around and make a modern day engine instead of this merry-go-round with loose screw
---
Well Ultracite Gatling Lasers are crafted in their own category, ‚ÄúULTRACITE‚Äù and the plan is very rare. Considering you recall a prefix in the item name it‚Äôs more likely you got a mod plan FOR the Ultracite Gatling Laser, looking at my list it could have been, 
---
‚ÄúPlan: Prime Ultracite Gatling Laser Receiver,‚Äù
---
(from Scorchbeasts or Scorchbeast Queen)
---
‚ÄúPlan: Ultracite Gatling Refined Beta Wave Tuner,‚Äù
---
‚ÄúPlan: Ultracite Gatling Severe Beta Wave Tuner,‚Äù
---
(from Savage Divide, Mire, or Cranberry Bog vendors)
---
Any of this ring any bells? Do keep in mind that a really long name would probably get cut off.
---
I don't know why more people aren't hyped for "Taking one for the team" , a better name for it would be "Take.A.Fucking.Run.At.Me."
---
Otherwise, i'm probably going to go Power Armor Reboot, Power Sprinter (gotta be moving in daily ops), the Agility Special, and Hack and Slash and Retribution. The last two because even though they're not the most practical option, they'd be the most "legendary" if I can get any good at using them effectively.
---
Would love to have poison resist, but it's not worth taking off the father winter helmet, lol.
---
I really liked her but I've heard more than once she annoyed people. it's ok, we don't have to agree.
---
Yeah because the drop rate is like .02 %. Got a leather coat after 1100 hours in the game so yeah it‚Äôs a grind, that‚Äôs what Bethesda wants is grind .. not 20 hours of play time and you have everything in the game
---
Ok.  I probably worry too much.  I don't want to make this game suck for anyone else.
---
I have 2 issues with the bow.
---
With a vats legendary modifier to increase my chances to hit in vats by 35%, I almost always miss my first shot. This happened after the previous patch, not the one we are currently on. There was one enemy I shot 8 arrows and missed all but the last one with a 95% chance to hit.
---
Second the reload speed is so slow. When you are missing like that and because you have the explosive modifier on it you aggro the enemies, you better hope to God you can kill them before they get close. I wish bow before me, gave attack/reload speed instead of one of the modifiers it does give. 
---
This is from a person who has, outside of those 2 issues has absolutely loved the bow. I made a new character to exclusively play a bow with.
---
I'm waiting for fallout 5, the lower the number in fallout, the better the game.
---
I've never had that happen.  I did come back to my CAMP once and everything was destroyed - everything.  I assumed the area was bombed or something!  
---
I'm used to playing alone or with my kids, but I am enjoying playing with other folks.
---
Should have been like a real leader and gotten someone else to launch it for you like I did.
---
*looks even more smug 'cause his armor doesn't need polishing*
---
workshops are pvp zones. if they want it back they can fight you for it.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to get rank 2 of mister sandman. I tried it with my sniper and although I get decent damage already, the effect is night and day, pun intended. Even with my non legendary Fixer I get one hit kills when the moon is out.
---
Agreed
---
Guys are pretty naive to think the brotherhood is anything but bullies
---
silly nonce
---
This pretty sums up all FO76 discord trading hubs!! You post a god roll for trade and get a bunch of script offers !!
---
He may be new, comrade. As long as their heart against the dehumanizing capitalist fascist scum is strong.
---
Thanks!! Yeah buddy I‚Äôve been eagerly waiting!!
---
The events existed before the survival tents got into the game. also there is no stash Box in arktos pharma.
---
being prepared and dealing with the known limitations is a major part of the game
---
WestRider85
---
For no skill guns, high levels sure seem to be happy to feed demo‚Äôs with their guns and ammo and not complain about it then.  Bunch of double standard drama queens.
---
Sorry just saw this but sure hit me up on Xbox when you see me not maxed partied.
---
I'm pretty happy to sprint 50% longer and die 40% less.
---
What are you saying? We all love getting stimpacks, Radways and nukashine due to grinding a lot!
---
Also 50, 100 gold ? Why are they giving us so much again? They should give us just 10, same with atoms in some levels, 150 atoms are so many, with 20 is more than enough. They should give us more and more profile pictures and photo frames, that's what people love.
---
I did a whole build trying to makes weapons like that work. 
---
It was fun, until i played with friends and realized that i was objectively terrible. Also realized that the game wasn't actually very hard, it's just hard when all your weapons suck ass
---
if this was ever a thing there would definitely be a way to dupe or some stupid shit. like turn on airplane mode right when you swap items or something super simple. i couldnt see Beth pulling this off ever
---
Nope
---
Sorry man xb1! And sorry for the late reply
---
Not from looting earl though.
---
Random event. Will tag along and help you for a bit then turn hostile.
---
True but I‚Äôd rather have the guaranteed 3* than nothing at all and frustration
---
Its sad when you read about people stuck in abusive relationships.
---
Yes it will be. It will completely shatter that fine tuned mode
---
Should honestly be renamed "Take a fucking run at me", I love it.
---
Yep.  Although this just happened to me and I didn't get the rewards.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the outfits you‚Äôre wearing, I found out that when I wear my soldier outfit over my vault suit it made my main character look fat
---
Really? So they can't fix it, hahahaha, glad I still have 18 fireworks left.
---
Do people spell thicc with 2 c‚Äôs because it looks like a big butt?
---
No this is a honey pot. Perk load outs are coming early 2021. You won't get those coins back
---
I would love them if they did just a tad more damage, and also, they came out after wastelanders, so in order to use them, you need an entirely new character to spec into bows or a shit ton of unused levels. Maybe time for that prestige system y‚Äôall were talking about?
---
Lets just I would not be surprized if it was bugged.
---
Dealing with weight issues?.. hope you get better my friend, from what I understand eating disorders can be very deadly.
---
i'm trying to sneak my way through silo alpha, but i'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the bots.
---
You can't VATS in pvp. They broke it 5 months ago and haven't acknowledged the issue
---
If you have garbage prices may b  someone like me lured creatures over to kill it
---
Meh I don't mind them right now ,I never burn more that 500 2mm rounds, but then again I use magic armor and guns.
---
It‚Äôs odd because my junkies bow also has the vats assisted legendary modifier but I always seem to miss the first shot but consistently hit with the others proceeding it. I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the buggy vats with your bow. I also started another character who I called the survivalist and would only use non legendary bows, throwing weapons (like the tomahawk) and melee weapons and I‚Äôm having a blast.
---
Yeah, PA is or Gauss rifles and Gatling weapons.
---
Strange, it did it for me?
---
Thats why the raider collectron is the best. At least you know what you signed for
---
With a chance to get diseases.
---
You get them by tons killing level 3 ghouls or scorched...
---
That explains it ... and shows I don‚Äôt know about PvP ü§£ü§£. Appreciate the answer üëçüèº
---
Is it repeatedly spitting the disk out? 
---
If so set the console sideways, on the bottom part youll find a nub that runs parallel with the eject button, try pulling down and away on it. Happens to my ps4 from time to time.
---
Not sure if you were aware but when you enter your power armor you lose carry weight stats from backpacks (including weight reductions like for example chems) and any armor pieces with pocketed/deep pocketed. I don't know if it was meant to be that way but I hate it. You clearly don't get naked and then jump into PA so all the armor plus any PA carry weight mods should stack.
---
Now I want an Imposter "collectron" that aggressively baaaaas. The only thing it should collect would be white wolf fedoras.
---
This is correct. The devs mentioned this at Quake Con this year. [Source](https://youtu.be/-vS0lrmXjo4) It would be nice if they did something else with the voting booths and such, though...
---
Would be nice if they put free atoms back in the game for ppl who reached tier 100. 
---
Oh wait then nobody would pay for any of the garbage out of the cash shop...
---
Apparently... shows how often I attempt PvP ü§£
---
Yes you can mod the laser rifle to be automatic. It's a barrel mod.
---
It‚Äôs still a steaming pile of shit. But it‚Äôs *my* steaming pile of shit.
---
Sell your unused ammo for 1 caps in your vending machine. Then buy the ammo you need from other player's vending machine.
---
That's what I did. I got 2k caps at level 10 ish. Then I spent them on 1k shotgun shells.
---
I mean, the circumstances might have been different.  I died as I went to loot Earl's body.  I guess I should mention my game crashed soon after I got out of the mine.  That's probably why.  This game man.  It was probably all crap anyway.
---
So, serious question.. if I use weapons like hunting rifles and lever actions, what are the benefits of switching to using a bow do you think?
---
Launching again?
---
Why are these pricks booing you? You‚Äôre right! I fixed that downvote for you :)
---
You can also argue the fact that you can turn urine into purified drinking water and use your own shit for fertilizer... ill be waiting for that to be added
---
Straight fact
---
You mean that well get all the level 1 perks for free ?
---
I think that's the reasoning.
---
Thanks, I feel like blind LOL
---
On a steel slide no less..
---
lMfAo..
---
Better hope that nickel plated sissy pistol don't jam..
---
DuhHhHHhHh... UhhHuuuHhHuuhh
---
Me too! I had chipotle earlier
---
Appreciate the reply. No, first it wouldn't detect that the disk was in at all, and thereby wouldn't spit it out either. I used the manual release screw (slim PS4) and got the disk out, and retightened the screw, and now it won't let anything in at all. Already took the plate off to check the spring loading the little blocker as well, which seems to be in place.
---
I wish they'd let us put junk down in our camp, like 4... Or maybe wall shelves that let us put things like this and Mr Jangles on display.... That wall-mount similar to curtains...
---
What story is the cabins and screams based off of?
---
Thanks for your post. I threw a grenade on the floor in front of the case and the outfit got blast clear across the room! It took me a minute to find it and to figure out that I had to stand on top of the case to get the helmet. The mess of books was absolutely the best part. I went room by room throwing grenades like a maniac. The Overseers house is so much fun to mess up! Makes me wonder if there's enough room in there to use a nuka grenade or if it will kill me. I think I'm going to try it next time I log in. Thanks again!
---
I think I ended up going back to get another key card from the Hornwright Hq in Charleston
---
I remember building a camp at a workshop kitted with all the crafting stations and 8 laser turrets. I assumed the camp would be saved when i logged off, available to be placed down next time. Never again...
---
He's just trying to be better than his worst self
---
That would be great, I have 0 possum badges or more gold not that shitty 50, at least 200-250 for the first ranks and 500-1000 for the last ones.
---
Twice
---
On the topic of collectrons, I have the basic collectron that is advertised as having multiple variants with different colours, how do I change the colour?
---
Nocturnal rolling pin?
---
Not only, outside my power armor, i can one or two hit enemies with a decent melee weapon but i can also V.a.t.s kill anything with my Gatling gun due to the extra Perception and Agility. On top of that i'm given extra xp and with some buffs i can even gain more xp...why looking somewhere else !?
---
¬†
---
Why would i recommand something else !? I'm a god with this shit !
---
That's an issue !
---
How much coke are you on right now?
---
I think I addressed the same question for another person yesterday but I'll simply say, having a RoF over 200 doesn't automatically make the weapon a magic weapon. I believe the magic damage is tied to a combination of specific legendary mods along with a large number of hits in a short time-frame. This being said, that is why shotguns(splash of pellets all at once) and high RoF heavy weapons are able to become magic weapons. 
---
In your case, the weapon is not magic but does have the potential to be one. If paired with a piece of legendary armor with the right mod, it can become a magic weapon but I can't guarantee it as "magic damage" can be inconsistent.
---
Most people finished Legendary Run so there is no reason to play NW anymore it seems.
---
With current guns in the game that event will crash any server. Worst community event.
---
Well at least I know that I can have Ace collect fasnacht foods when it‚Äôs available again. Thanks for the info!
---
I tbh just want the jack o lantern n pumpkin stand plans so I can do a Halloween themed camp lol
---
You mean like there's actually nobody there? Seems odd it would even bother letting you in. It takes forever, but when I do get in there's at least 30 people.
---
It will change randomly on every session, you can't control it. As far as I know.
---
Wait it‚Äôs been changing this whole time?!? Whattttttttt :-O
---
" **any PTS players able to confirm?** " - No, since in PTS we have increased values on score rewards so we can see and test the system. Meaning we get huge amounts of score for doing challenges.
---
Cant be the good old if is in the future but yeah would not say no to an FN FAL or a vault 13 jump suit
---
I just scam his ass whenever I can. Somehow I've managed to find a multiscope, portable power pack, and osmosis kit just lying on the ground near dead raider thieves. They aren't marked as quest items and so I have them in a display case. When Ward asks for one of these for the daily, I run just outside of Foundation, slap down my survival tent, and pull the requested item out of my stash and then put it right back in. The quest updates and tells me to return the item to Ward. Well, I don't have the item on my person but the doofus pays me anyway!
---
&gt;a backlog that started to roll off the longer they were unfinished.
---
An excellent idea.  You're right that they'll never do it though.  Not because it would be bad, *in any way at all*.  They just need to foist on us every reason to log in daily.
---
I actually have a junkies compound bow with limb damage and reduced weight c:
---
No, not a "magic" weapon.
---
At the end of my mazes, I always leave a, "You Win!" sign for the mental boost, and a piece of perfectly preserved pie. The cake's in a display case though, so it's just a lie...
---
Just did...you have about 5 minutes
---
Yeah. I will miss that. I have some great low level weapons and armor. When I start a new game I will use those for the first levels. 
---
Those will become almost legacy as probably the majority will scrip them.
---
Literally just dropped
---
I'm not even getting notified of your posts lol
---
you're getting auto modded, haha
---
nah, it's not. it's what you get for playing at 19% health. and to answer your other post specifically, no, what you argued originally was that unyielding was op... because of the int boost. 
---
you're not very good at argumentation are you ha
---
Got it to work after fiddling with my router and restarting my PS4. Game shattered my expectations and ended up playing for 6 hours straight without realizing it.
---
Yep
---
That is the communist rifle with the Blood Eagles paint. It will give a short look to the handmade like the Screaming Eagle.
---
1. Honestly the main reason for me is that they are fun. Unless you use bow its hard to describe the feeling of landing a perfect shot on a super mutant from far away - especially if they are explosive arrows. And like I said in another comment chain wearing the ghillie suit while using a bow really makes (well me at least) you feel like a post apocalyptic Appalachian survivalist.
---
2. Economical (to an extent). Because you can occasionally get some arrows back from enemies you‚Äôve killed, and if your always searching downed enemies instead of moving on, you can go for longer periods without crafting more arrows. And considering with my build I use the same amount of arrows as I would bullets on most enemies the bow has a slight edge against my lever action.
---
3. Customizable. Although in my experience only four are viable, bows have six difference mods you can attach which adds a lot of variety to the archery. These mods are cryo, poison, flaming, explosive, ultracite and plasma. Short of getting a gun with the explosive prefix or priming it there aren‚Äôt any other ranged weapons in the game that allow you to customize what type of ammunition you can fire at enemies. As for what I think are the viable ones you have explosive just for the most damage, cryo to slow down the tankier enemies that have detected you, ultracite for scorched and scorchbeasts and flaming which actually isn‚Äôt that bad anymore since flame damage was changed to its own type (instead of being energy) which a lot of enemies have no resistance against.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love my lever action and at times I find it more favourable than my bow, since it‚Äôs more reliable in vats and ammo is more common/cheaper to  craft. I love both and since their perk cards are both in perception I only use one or the other at a time.
---
Yes BIV and Grafton Mayor are great but I think you forgot the Warden. I‚Äôll do anything he asks me to in that sultry southern dandy voice.
---
....the other 5 explosive legacy users you say?
---
Us fixer users are offended by your cheek to even ask this question,you noob bow people pfft I suck my thumb at you.
---
Me and my bloodied limb gauss rifle make this face &gt;:(
---
That camo skin with the screaming eagle shape is perfect!
---
It seems like i hurt...‚úå
---
That makes absolute logical sense. Especially if there was a "quiver" mod you could use with backpacks that would reduce the weight of arrows. Or maybe decrease draw time. Something. Anything.
---
Aside from the general screwiness they did with explosive weaponry getting nerfed compared to FO4, the broadsider is apparently quite bugged and not hitting for the damage its supposed to be.
---
It depends what you already have in luck
---
The number of people who play NW is very very low.. I play NW almost every day and the last week or two it‚Äôs been taking considerably longer to join a lobby. NW is a half assed battle Royale. The player count speaks for itself.. would love to see survival mode come back..
---
Shit, just give me Dogmeat!!!
---
[Strider Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd543e2&amp;d=s42sf2ss2sm2sn2p10pn2pt2pu2pv2ej4c72a42am2an2a51a72iq2lb1&amp;wp=waw2&amp;wm=11-1122&amp;n=Strider)
---
Bow gang rise up! 
---
Great idea, I hope they show us some love!
---
Bloody mess, mutation stuff
---
Nice, thanks for the detailed response!
---
I will definitely try it out, In other games I've used bows to be sneaky so it sounds fun lol
---
I'm simply going to continue ignoring locked things. Save myself from a lvl 20 single action revolver and 5 prewar money. I can hack that security in double the time it would take to kill, so there really is no point there either.
---
was range
---
If you already have bloody mess, class freak and starched genes I think adrenaline is probably better.
---
Furious pump shotgun is the way because each pellet counts for furious effect and after one shot you get entire buff
---
Nice, didnt understand that...
---
Si its a no braiser for me, I dont see a 6th perk to use instead of this one.
---
Still have to think about which one Ill upgrade tho, as Im only level 200 on my 3 mains and need to keep alot of support/craft perks
---
Too bad there‚Äôs no way to kite some wendigos up top during the event
---
No worries. And god that was another point I could have added: stealth. Since it doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of arrows you use because they will always count as a silenced weapon. By the way pair your bow with the Chinese stealth suit and it‚Äôll feel like your playing Crysis.
---
Explosive plasma rifle is a hacked weapon.
---
got dropped from some NW games a couple of times. I think Adventure has been okay though.
---
I do have problems with the authentication server though, so I have to sign in constantly to play the game.
---
While we're at it- can we get an option for an invisible backpack skin? Too many of the backpacks clip with too many of the outfits.
---
Could you show us your build please?
---
Well isn't there a dlc coming out calk fractured steel, so maybe when they come they won't do anything to the nukes or be hostile to mutated players. Besides I doubt the brotherhood will be hostile since players need to play the story
---
Sir, you have offended my honour and my bow. Meet me at the Cranberry Bog at dawn where we shall duel. Please disregard the sirens warning that a nuke is incoming and that I may fast travel away for no suspicious reason. :)
---
Wait, it's double XP now?
---
Bows were fun to use before this latest update. Now, they are so annoying. You can only loose an arrow if you have a full draw
---
Bos is bs. All they want to do is hoard technology that drip it once they control that tech. Even in 3, lyon us a tool. When Lyons headed to the east the stopped in pit and killed everyone except the kids. Then forced 26/27 to become bos members. 
---
Lyons sucks. She had many soldiers killed fighting for control of fort independence. A war she started instead of doing her mission. 
---
Ito continue my legacy with bos I hope we can screw them over much like in New vegas.
---
You guys aren't even feuding yet, calm it down there.
---
Tbh i didnt realize it was a plasma rifle üò©
---
Commie here. More for me then.
---
I‚Äôm already on your team lol
---
Maxing out ammocard 1st. Gotta keep you all loaded.
---
At least you got the ground zero achievement
---
I seem to always miss the first shot in vats but the ones after it always seem to hit. Weird.
---
Yea you can you need the mod you can‚Äôt buy it from vendors so you need to scrap laser rifles till you get it
---
I agree.. I think it should be a level 50 and up event in my opinion
---
 It‚Äôs quite obvious if it‚Äôs a new person playing the game who wants to join the event to see what it is... but this event is a raid style event.., raids should require a minimum level requirement. There is no place in the mine for low levels at all .... Honestly a level 27 doing 7 damage a shot is a complete waste of a spot
---
KEEP THE KEYCARDS IN. Hate shooting those pesky flying drones down while they zoom about.
---
Fuck the stims and nukashine tho
---
I‚Äôd be down with that. And it would be easy to justify in -universe: just a use a stealth boy and voila! Invisible backpack.
---
Nice! Decent legendary bows are rare enough but legendary compound bows are just insanely rare due to the reputation grind needed to obtain the plans. So far I‚Äôve only gotten one legendary compound bow from Earle of all enemies. I‚Äôve never seen them for sale.
---
I have actually tried one because friend didn't realize it's not a normal legacy weapon and traded one. Surprisingly very average weapon.
---
The Garb of Mysteries would probably need a massive AP and sneak crit bonus to be viable.  The blade would probably need bonus damage to work, even with armor penetration.
---
Lol oops!
---
I like using workshops to practice builds and blueprints to use for another day.  My camp is at max budget, so there isn't any more room to build until I move it.  But I know it's gone when I leave.  But I do have some blueprints to put down for quick workshop builds and that helps.
---
Looks fantastic! My favorite is the workshop. I like how you used the garage door combined with the fence to create an open space. Very well decorated and the structures seem balanced. You don‚Äôt have things in places that don‚Äôt make sense... well fo76 sense anyways :)
---
Look at it from their perspective; it isn‚Äôt Danse, it‚Äôs some robot made to replace their friend after he was murdered by its creators and has a remote activation switch to turn it into a murder bot.
---
You‚Äôre right about the damage. Before I became a junkies build with bows I could deal with only about 50% of the high level enemies in the game. Now that I‚Äôm a junkie I can fight off about 90% of them now. But it does suck for players who don‚Äôt wanna go bloodied or junkies to use the more creative and niche weapons.
---
nope. with this awesome project you can easily check which plans you are missing. with this knowledge you can bring your WTB list to the next level.
---
we, as a plan collecting clan, can provide you with one or another plan for reasonable prices.
---
just check the mule, check the database also released by the incredible plan collectors and after that you mogjt find a way to get you missing plans on your own.
---
I mean the BoS are less intolerant to mutations than the Enclave are, who want to wipe out anyone with a trace of mutation in them.
---
The BoS hate Supermutants which is a very different thing.
---
Were you on a team by any chance?
---
Nope. Maybe the deep will be a daily op location in the future and it will be a reward from that tho?
---
Definitely! I was happy that the Flatwoods Fletcher skin for the bow could be obtained fairly early in season 1 of the legendary run.
---
Those ideas for quiver-backpack mods sound rad!
---
Damage done by teammates counts for everyone on the team, yes this includes public teams.
---
BOS is scrap only, chems and ammo came from the raider bot I think
---
I have mine set to ammo and he‚Äôs been doing it
---
Edit: now I own the raider bot also and commie and regular one and Santa. Maybe if you own more you can select whatever idk but my bos is def collecting ammo and guns
---
Ever notice tha Rose, the DJ, and Moira from FO3 all sound the same?
---
What is it with wendigos and cave roofs....
---
Now I'm sure EVERYONE wants this, and Bethesda is known for bugs so I'll take the responsibility to test all the skins, all the things included so that when it comes out it will be working fine for you guys
---
I selected the other comment to reply to. It seems pretty clear I wasn‚Äôt trying to respond to you, no reason to be a piece of shit about it.
---
Idk but I tell you in was a pain to get vats hits on him because he kept switching sides and we where just shooting in dark. But it worked with only a minute to spare
---
The cake isALWAYS a lie
---
I‚Äôll just take that win and not questioned it
---
It doesn't hurt (although it's a bit costly) to have Adrenaline unlocked twice. I have a max level Adrenaline card, and also a level 1 one as well. I use level 1 Adrenaline for normal use, and I use the level 5 version for cases where I'm not being stealthy.
---
For instance, with the new Daily Ops all the stealth/sneak perks are going to be useless, so I put Adrenaline 5 in to substitute those.
---
We offered to do an app like this for free. Have been turned down for some reason. They just aren‚Äôt interested. We approached them with as close to a fully flushed out visual prototype as anyone could have when soliciting an idea. Attached was a scope of work, timeline, and bill ($0). We asked if there could be a bonus structure if the app was well received we could discuss payment. 
---
Completely ignored.
---
We are doing some work for another Austin game dev studio now.
---
Ahhhh ok. I last played since like January 2019 so still getting used to this stuff. Thanks
---
Dude, I play 7DTD. So if anybody gives you shit, send them MY WAY LOL!
---
It‚Äôs some kind of bug, I haven‚Äôt seen it on Xbox but think it has something to do with adventure mode.  I only play NW now and haven‚Äôt seen it so maybe the adventure mode thing has some truth. Fine finding matches on US Xbox but they did seem to bump min players to 40 otherwise back to main you go.
---
I don't even bother picking locks or hacking anymore.
---
I did on my first character, as is my custom of blitzing for lockpicking/hacking in other FO games, but now I just don't really care anymore.
---
There's usually nothing in there anyways I can't find again somewhere else.
---
It really depends on you build, man, it's not that simple. "Adrenaline" works really well with Sniper and Commando builds that use "Gun Fu".
---
But even without "Gun fu" it can also provide you really good crowd control capabilities.
---
It's all cool but if you happen to run a tanky power armor build, you may rather save Agility points for "Dodgy".
---
It depends on your needs. 
---
You may want to you use your vats more often...Then "Grim Reaper's Sprint" (luck) could be a pretty interesting option.
---
What? Third person makes you shoot faster? WTH?
---
I was thinking about this yesterday. Glad someone said something.
---
Keep asking. Maybe one day they will hear the request and take it seriously. There‚Äôs many features that arguably could go into the app - including support for load outs (although I hear they are right around the corner). Having an Appalachia-wise marketplace so you can find the users who have the items you want to buy would be nice too.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs how it works.
---
It is scrap that seem to be based around the items we donated, and some extra goodies too but no ammo. That would be only the Raider bot currently.
---
Deathwatch in this I would welcome but could see how you getting killed at start would be a huge drag as at least on a team you might get revived...
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm ok with stims... But not an entire level dedicated to it. I‚Äôd rather get stims + other rarer chems, non-craftable ones. Or bundle it with lunchboxes.
---
I think it‚Äôs great that there is no vats in pVP.. pretty much would  give any Weopon the Tesla effect ( no aim just shoot) which if you take pride in using a Tesla in pvp you honestly are lazy and unskilled
---
You can physically close your eyes ... pvp and kill someone.. lol  yeah take your accolade to the trash
---
Dude, just watch Angry Turtle's video. He makes it very clear which properties make it magic. We've moved on from the &gt;200 is magic early understanding.
---
Pretty sure ultra light is on the pts so it should hit live on the 15th
---
I really hope bows get a rework. I‚Äôm talking more perk cards to enhance draw time and speed and imagine iron sights that work and more skins. It would be cool to see a Elder scrolls skin for it lol just as a cool little cross over or some kind of futuristic looking bow that is like the gauss weapons. Something crazy like that!
---
The game works on a 255 list of "most recent items looted" in its save file (there's technical reasons why, but it's not necessary to know). The trick is to loot a bunch of stuff from either that house or golf club until you hit around 255, then server hop, Then fast travel to lucky hole. I've ran that place 4 times in one day before this way :)
---
I just realized the public team thing myself so don't feel bad. I kept getting the loot but no event drops (whem they melt her face off and I don't have time to do the dmg). Now we know.
---
Just need to loot until those lead spawns are no longer in the "255 most recently looted" list and they'll spawn for you when you fast travel there.
---
yet nobody buys the 1,2* uny pieces i have in my vendor(s) ... even with ultralight mod they take up lots of my stash space... 500-600 caps apiece... but i wont scrip any uny ever (exept secret service)
---
Yes of course, let me just work out how to use one of those build sites :)
---
You can't
---
I have a stealth rifleman build with a TSE handmade and an AA hunting rifle, works fine.
---
No PA, Sneak perk max, covert operative, bloody mess, starched genes and class freak plus 300% health regen mutation.
---
I have to say luck. I have the mutation stuff + serendipity + tormentor or bloody mess.
---
Oh god oh no
---
Supermutants: what was that
---
.
---
Must be nothin.
---
Ok that‚Äôll be dope! 
---
But like deep pocketed secret service I‚Äôll have to see it with my own eyes before I get too exited over it.
---
The Queen doesn't take extra damage, not sure about Earle.
---
I love bows
---
Wait why is stealth useless in Daily Ops?
---
Could you link your build to me?
---

Explosive bait for the win!! Nothing is more entertaining than watching someone spawn back at their camp to see it completely leveled regardless if it cost little to repair ... still very entertaining.. using it while I can till it‚Äôs patched!! Trap bases are who I go after 95% of the time.. other 5% is trollers and high levels who have non legendary weapons for stupid high cap cost who obviously are trying to take advantage of uneducated low levels.. so the persons base you are referring to would meet my requirements to go use bait on.. I.e high cap request for stupid ass items.. sorry if you disagree .. I don‚Äôt play the game based off other people‚Äôs feelings.. you can leave you feelings for someone who cares
---
Too late i invested in a bloodied ultracite :(
---
I really can‚Äôt seem to notice any difference with my sneak ability atm using 3 of 5 unyielding with one being harder to detect. Secret service‚Äôs sneak is fine even for things like ACP unless you are playing a non bloodied sneak build.
---
They've supposedly added more weekly challenges and are doing extra double score weekends. I completed the current season (at least I will do by tonight) without playing daily, therefore we should be able to complete the next season without playing daily too.
---
As an actual archer irl, the bow in this game as extremely cringe for me. Skyrim was waaays ahead in terms of archery, despite being nearly 10 years old.
---
Also a day one player since beta. Agree with everything you said. 
---
Bethesda caters to the foodbuilds.
---
iirc, I only locked the bin as well and both bin and terminal locked... on ps4.
---
A BOS holotage would look cool.
---
Considering that Taggerdy's Thunder were like this, I don't hold out much hope for the new guys.
---
I'd support a plasma skin when the Tesla Rifle gets one. A simple black one would be great.
---
 Make a third star cola nut for that effect. Triple effectiveness and removes blackout.
---
Didn't turn hostile for me. Just eventually turned around and went back to whatever he was originally up to
---
If I need to choose between BOS and shitclave I think I know who should I choose
---
If I had badges I would give you all of them üëåüèº I agree completely
---
It shows again that Bethesda don't play they own games
---
#play76bethesda

Both maxsons would love it in their arsenal ü§£

---
There you go.
---
Third weapon is TSE The Dragon
---
I dislike the fact that its called a cackle, I was expecting some form of laughter emote, not a stupid staff wave. I still use it alot, but it definitely wasn't what I expected from the name/description of it.
---
Thanks man :) I appreciate it so much
---
You're not the Dad Bot!
---
Were all of the collectrons able to pick from all loot types now or is that unique to this one?  Noticed it can fond fassnacht and raider stuff too.
---
The actual BOS stuff it finds are worthless.
---
I found the Commie spy trying to infiltrate the Enclave!
---
Oh dang that‚Äôs pretty sweet, I wish I would have bought it, making mixed alcohol would be way easier if I had a steady supply of the basic ones
---
cant do good ol days anyway... 76 takes place before all of them lol
---
What makes this a support build ü§î
---
I don't get how stealthy and support would even work with each other in your build. It doesn't even make sense to me.
---
The only way it possibly could make sense in my mind is being a combat buffer/debuffer with high charisma (at least 9) where you're the one that initiates combat applying at the very least Tenderizer and possibly Suppressor but not necessarily the one to take it down as well as sharing a 3 star perk card, though what would be good will depend on team comp.
---
My gut feel though is that it's not going to be a good build though. 
---
If you were willing to go full support, it'd be the same high charisma but lean on being tanky so that you can soak up hit in PA and use heavy weapons/melee as the support weapons, especially with a flamer and shishkebab and the Friendly fire perk.
---
To now most don't know how it works. Will it only work if a mob gets aggro on you? Or is it enough when the battle music starts and you are in a team? What about earl and sbq? Only works when they are after you? And if so will it stqy when another one gets aggro?
---
So many questions.. no answers. Where is angryturtle when you need one ;)
---
Yo imagine siding with the enclave to take up arms against the brotherhood. That would legit be kind of fun.
---
Want a Halloween collectron so bad, one that finds various Halloween candies and masks while making spooky sounds and playing creepy music. Like the screems from that one campground or that trickster bot.
---
And a device that plays that creepy organ music from the church too. But like a radio, not one that has to be manually placed. 
---
This Halloween is gonna suck for alot of people thos year,  plz help us to have some fun digitally trick or treating at least.
---
Whats a support build for you?
---
ARGH I just deleted my quick workshop shack blueprint.
---
You'd have to ask Bethesda the reasons behind that particular design decision. But whatever the reason, stealth doesn't work during the Daily Ops missions, crouching/sneaking does nothing, CSA / stealth boys don't work, and you're always in \[Danger\] no matter what.
---
Laser with beam splitter shred things, but needs to be repaired often. I was killing 62 ghouls no problem with my 25 lvl alt
---
Thats what I was thinking, Just trying to see if anyone's found a work around. Like friendly fire doing more healing in sneak or something
---
I want my X-02 power armor back. I want it REAL BAD.
---
I run almost the same build, you can still do decent damage without Bloodied or Junkies.
---
Could be that hes forced to do things he never expected to and is killed later for failing to do so.
---
I probably will be using this build anyways but I was just trying to see if there's like a work around to use stealth while healing/supporting your mates and not take aggro
---
If you think they aren‚Äôt gonna sell the ability to change the vault door to other stuff then you‚Äôre as dumb as the fruit you take your name from
---
That should have called it ‚ÄúYou shall not pass!‚Äù
---
The problem is how do you establish, maintain and balance the teams?
---
This would heavily bias friend and clan groups (especially self organising ones) and severely disadvantage solo players and casuals. It'll be Yellow team all over again.
---
I recently started playing with mutations once I got Carnivore I'm at FTP anytime it pops up.
---
Just looted Earle and then died immediately, spawned outside and danced until my reward timer went off, whoop whoop! üôÉ
---
It‚Äôs a brutal grind.......that is until you start the T-Bill to Bullion grind. Spoiler alert the gauss shotty is cheap. But secret service armor and mods will take a month. T-65 power armor will take 7500/1700 weeks plus more for mods.
---
You calling it an ‚Äòemotion‚Äô is real unsettling
---
So much hostility for plums. üòÇ
---
If you mean R91 AR from F3, it's not FN FAL but a CETME (Spanish AR from late '50s).
---
Wait till they have a nuke dropped on them by a pissed off guy in a mascot suit.
---
Plums have evolved over the course of 101.6 million years- they are more superior than us because they don‚Äôt even want vault doors, or have spared the time to form an opinion. OP‚Äôs Plum heritage should not be called into question.
---
Do you have a radio in game placed down near you? I think that comes under game sound instead of radio sound

[Fallout 76 Build with 15/3/3/9/10/8/8](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4CAggJBwcBAQEAJngDOwOYAQPgAQOZAQN+A4ABAwsDWQLVAQMlAw0BcQPqAQNABU4D8AEDygEDNgIA)
---
That's what I'm currently using to solo Earle.
---
Weapons - for "clean kills" I use Vamp FFR 250drwr minigun and junkies/50dr aim/250drwr ultracite gatling laser. For Cheesy kills I have a Vamp/limb/250drwr minigun with accelerated barrel.
---
Armour - t65, medic pump, targeting hud, calibrated shocks. 
---
Consumables - boatload of stimpacks, any hp buffing food. For clean kills - much psycho buff, big guns bobble head.
---
Any questions just ask :)
---
I own all of the different Collectrons and I am able to change up the resources they collect via the console attached to them, if you have the Raider version you should be able to make it collect ammo and weapons. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
How about just implementing Skyrim‚Äôs bow mechanics 100% ?
---
Ah i see, sorry.
---
Stealth doesnt work that great with a team anyways.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look into that
---
I was thinking this.
---
I just got one of these today from the SBQ and it was unique enough that I wanted to try it out  seems it can fire pretty quickly.  But am guessing it wont be able to kill anything.
---
i personally always go for anti armor. most enemies I'll tear through like paper
---
Could just make it look like a Whitesprings protectron. It would say the same lines they do, but sometimes interrupted by lines from MODUS (in his voice of course).
---
This legit just happened to me too. it drained 6 25% cores i was saving for conversion.
---
I can't wait to smack around the Brotherhood of Steel if that's the case.
---
That‚Äôs a cool idea, but what would That Gun be a skin for? Maybe make a skin for a revolver that makes it into a makeshift or weathered looking revolver. What would the Auto Ax be a skin for? I doubt they‚Äôll add weapons in seasons, but it would be a cool thing to see them add weapons to seasons, and then if players don‚Äôt reach them have them purchasable with Gold Bullion at the end of a season.
---
I see your Skyrim mechanics and add the capability to use different type of arrows on top!!! 
---
Why does the mod go on the bow?
---
The arrows are the ones that carry the ‚Äúcharge‚Äù, whether it be plasma/explosive/cryo...
---
Plan: Picnic Blanket is supposed to drop from the picnic mystery side-quest in Toxic Valley, got one today through it. üôÉ
---
I don't recall that happening but I probably went afk near there and got it, guess I got lucky
---
Apparently, you can only go as high as 15 in any special category im so pissed wanted 20/in strength
---
It's nuts to me that they're making stealth even more powerful than it already is...like damn Bethesda gives some other play styles some love.
---
They're a xenophobic military force lol. They're gonna have a bad time in Appalachia where everyone has mutated their DNA so they can jump around like a kangaroo with their best friend Grahm the super mutant and his two-headed cow.
---
I only have this one.
---
That would mean for them to have to work on the code to add the mechanic of manually be able to select type of ammo... you know... work... üòâ
---
You can literally buy the stimpaks (not that I recommend buying them) that you can get for cheaper than 2k caps when they could give 2k caps instead of the stimpaks and be worth more.
---
üôÉ
---
üëå
---
I want those Special cards way more than the other stuff. 
---
Tired of running around with 2 perception and 3 intelligence. 
---
That cleave perk sounds interesting tho. If they figured out how to avoid cleaving yourself in 2.
---
What I want most tho are the instanced camp spaces and the mannequins for my Silent Hill styled camp that just feels incomplete without them.
---
I'm hoping that when they eventually release the perk loadouts that its more of a wheel system than having to go back into the menu every time.
---
Sounds like you were in your own instance. 8 people per instance. Any more and they get sent into another one.
---
Good effort bud.
---
Xb1 player here as well- maybe they crashed out? Some servers can also be really hit or miss on whether anyone wants to do *any* event at all. 
---
On the flip side, what an ending. Congrats on the solo run!
---
I would assume there was others there but you were the person nine, so got put in your own instance. Good job killing him though!
---
Temporary companion, smubled across him once, when you approach him, he scans you and if you completed main quest he recognises you as a general and follows you for awhile, i guess he becomes hostile otherwise.
---
Oh I love it now. This is way better than the Christmas one
---
Out of 30 or more events I‚Äôve been lucky to not really see this. Tonight on the second one we just finished there was a few low levels, a level 30 and 50. They both fought their ass off for the most part. I did see one hide in a corner for a little getting swarmed by the spawns. I saved him and we just kept going.
---
Launch day he fell through the floor for me...üôÉ
---
Dude, I am level 110, and I have never even SEEN a bow. Only literally 3 or 4 crossbows.
---
Yeah, I've wanted to main an oddball weapon from day one, I did my best to make Flamers work, but for like every hour of resource gathering I got like... maybe 5 minutes of ammo.  Cryolators are a little better, but not much.  I wanted to try broadsiders, but I knew they would be 100% useless from the getgo so didn't bother.  
---
Made a different character to focus on explosive weapons, mines, and grenades, they were also super ammo intensive, the ammo is absurdly expensive to craft, had poor dps, and weren't very accurate, and that was before the explosives nerf.    
---
Tried the alien blaster for a little bit bit it felt like shooting a water pistol.      
---
Armor likewise is horribly designed.  There's no balance at all, SS armor is 100% the best by a mile, and there's no reason to consider using anything else unless you don't wanna grind the modules.  Even then Scout armor is just better than everything that's not SS.  I gotta laugh when I see all the skins for these armors that almost quite literally are never, and will never be used by anyone above level 50 unless they are RPing, and honestly that's being very generous.    
---
Armor types should have actual trade offs to maintain viability of all the types with different builds.
---
I thought what mainly made the explosive effect good was because the beam splitter right? Otherwise it‚Äôs pretty normal
---
Y-Yeah, hahahahahaha, imagine someone full timing it as it is, that would be hell! HAHAHAHAHahahaha... ha... \*desperate sobbing intensifies\*
---
I honestly just want a clean Garb/Eye variant from the Atomic Shop at this point. So I can wear about armor while still roleplaying my main as the Mistress.
---
I don't remember the trouble with the lucky shades, but u do remember "dad's vault suit" "autumns coat" and "dad's rifle"
---
We're about the same, except for power armor reboot.   I don't know if I'll go with Ammo Factory, Follow Though or another SPECIAL perk in that last slot.
---
Launch day I had the walking on platform thing he did tonight but he went back on the floor. This was first time after hearing ppl say about it I actually had to experience him going bye bye in the sky. Good ole Todd Howard keeping us on our toes
---
Well, they would probably add the bug fixes to the map, and make you grind/pay for them.   But what would the level 99 bug be?
---
September 15th
---
Fast travel bug maybe
---
Get a BFFR 50 cal and you will fix that vertibot in about 200 milliseconds.
---
Thank you!
---
I had a legendary crossbow, that was a Joyride, until i start getting everything better in all aspects, i still love them, and planning to eventualy get some mods and etc!
---
It really depends on how the new challenges compare to the bonus challenges we got to compensate for the auto completes last season.  Hopefully all of the bonus challenge xp will be funneled into weekly challenges so that you can play 2-3 times a week and have a reasonable chance to complete the season.
---
It's still better than HMMM HMMM HMM HMM HMMMMMMMMM 24/7
---
No problem! [Season 2 and one wastland](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/43yHXVVJpIawuxYldcXIvi/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-season-2-preview-new-s-c-o-r-e-board-rewards-and) if you want to read up on it.
---
I think for me it would be the various immortal monsters.  They are really annoying.
---
Or just any gun that does dmg üòÇ
---
I hope...the inability to go full aggro on the Crater or Foundation was one of Wastelander's biggest missed opportunities.  I would love to see an option to go raid a settlement with the Crater crew, or to get a message from a group of settlers asking for help building better defenses. (Like workshop mode)
---
Earle has way less explosive resist than SBQ I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
If the error / problem lies within the player, ad hominem attacks have been authorized a loooong time ago.
---
Mate, if your build can't do what you want, which is obviously to survive the encounter, don't you think it's time to change it up?
---
Don't use a screwdriver for nails, it might work sometimes, but fail 99% of the time.
---
Best camp ever!   You had me with the machine gun nest.   Very immersive; love all the detail.    
---
Great music too.  :)
---
Can‚Äôt even tag the fucker with any of my heavy guns
---
Ooooh..... love the Gauss shotty..... so worth the grind when you get your first TSE 3*. Gave my similar pump action to my wife the next day, because watching me with my Gauss made her want to try a shotgun build. :)
---
Yeah as far as I know there are no human or scorched enemies in the game that use bows. So the only regular and legendary bows you‚Äôll find will be dropped or sold by players. Although ironically you can occasionally find arrows in ammunition containers.
---
Still less carry capacity than with normal armor...
---
Fallout 2020
---
Trust me dude, the turbo fert is OP. With green thumb and a few grenades i was able to craft food for days
---
Angry turtle is a good fallout yt daliy uploads know alot about the small changes in the game
---
Which is why I ignored the missions and just did events and dailies in the Forest until I was at least level 30.   Then Toxic Valley until level 40, Ash Heap to 50.   Only then did I venture into SD, etc.   I wasn't in any rush and was more than entertained.
---
It‚Äôs useless to me I just eat raw carrots like a real man üòÇ
---
At least you're not too far from having all 6 slots, even if you can't max them all.
---
They are making bullets a lot cheaper to craft though with the legendary perks.
---
You know that no matter what weapon you use, no matter the effects, that it won‚Äôt do anything if the cargobot is so high up that it‚Äôs out of range, right?
---
Yeah, no one likes a guy the runs around in his drawers and sleeps in a cupboard.
---
The ammo is a complete PITA at this level.   On my second character, my partner made a heated coil baseball bat for me.   It was so much easier than my first character with the constant ammo fight.
---
What i need isn't even RNG, its just brutally slow. Whoever thought making these extremely repetitive daily faction quests the only source of faction rep is insane.
---
Consider changing the sign to say "this was a triumph."
---
I‚Äôm sure it is. I quite enjoyed the archery in Horizon Zero Dawn, especially how it encourages precision and skill to effectively take down enemies. Anyway while it‚Äôs clunky I still enjoy the archery in 76. Except in Nuclear Winter - I‚Äôd sooner run at another player with a switch blade lol.
---
Maybe but I checked to see how many other players there before I went there and noone was there.
---
One shot, no, but my two shot explosive minigun annihilated everyone I've ever fought as long as I can hit them. Some dude walked up to my camp the other day and started hitting me, I just pointed my minigun at him and deleted him. The guy had better gear than me, but it did not matter.
---
Yup, my minigun technically isn't one shot, so it isn't affected.
---
There's a couple of ways - I used to run a heavy flamer build where I'd shoot through people, friendly fire, tenderizer and suppressor worked well there.
---
A mate of mine does a vats medics combat shotgun build with field medic and some other perks.
---
Stealth commando/rifleman? Eesh that's tricky. Medics handmade and the world of crit perks? Plus suppressor and tenderizer?
---
Do the flame arrows count for the Friendly Fire perk? Can I shoot arrows at my teammates to heal them?
---
I was thinking like raiders vs settlers or something along those lines. just a different variation but there would be winners and losers . and i kinda like the idea of being a loser in game, matches my real world a little better lol.
---
You weren't the only one there, you were either the 9th or 17th person to join.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea for a perk card - I‚Äôd imagine something like that would go under agility.
---
I've got at least 1k arrows in my camp shop
---
Blinded by daily challenge üòÖ
---
I've had it for months too, AMD card. There's been a couple of posts I've seen about it. The best is how your character and clothes look when it rains...I suddenly look like I've been dipped in oil. It takes a while to go away after the rain stops which is interesting, lol
---
no wonder why it happens quiet frequently lately. üòÇ
---
Trap camps get a nuclear kiss.
---
The BOS collectron is the least annoying collectron in my opinion. I wish they would give you the option to mute them though.
---
Private servers are max 8
---
It doesn‚Äôt. It is a permanent end game event
---
End? Its a new end game boss similar to the queen
---
Yeah, but that means I can finally add charisma perks to my build so still worth.
---
Wow, very pleasant surprise actually. Thank you
---
Yeah, that's how I remember it happening to me too lol. I was not as prepared as you and got torn all to hell wondering where everyone else was :)
---
And ghouls also slap with poison damage
---
Ok good it's not just me... well I mean it's not GOOD obviously. Any word on a fix? Not sure who's responsibility this would be, Bethesda or AMD?
---
Yeah, there are  plenty of places to get some good extra points in. Just wish all the weight carrying bonus perks I use we're in endurance instead of strenght.
---
Wow buddy, you must have plenty of stash space because I know arrows are heavy lol.
---
*Bethesda. ‚ÄúSure we‚Äôll get right on coding all that for you and 10 other people...‚Äù
---
You know I‚Äôve never actually tested it but I‚Äôm sure it would - wouldn‚Äôt make much sense if it didn‚Äôt. But if it did it might be a very effective and cheap way to heal via friendly fire since I know flaming arrows do fire damage over a short period of time.
---
end perks need some love in general.
---
See, they agree.  Lol
---
I‚Äôve yet to obtain a quad crossbow and I want to do so for exactly same reason to provided.
---
Mine collects ammo alongside the scrap when I have it set to the BoS setting. Or atleast it did when I first tried it out, the first 2 things I got out of it were 6 5.56 rounds and 1 cork scrap.
---
It doesn't matter if you have the 2 star, you could still get a 3 star. Good luck!
---
Yeah good question, I'd like to know who's responsible  to fix it as well. I saw someone post about it a couple of months ago and they'd submitted reports to Bethesda but I've forgotten what the response was. Something about Vault Tec engineers working hard behind the scenes probably,  lol.
---
I follow gamerMOMover50. Her videos are short and simple. Or innovsurvivalist when I need some bug news and pts update.
---
Listen to mr find/crafts bows over here
---
Legit I haven't ever found one and I'm nearly lvl70 and it's a weapon I do want especially with the flatwoods style from the season track. I would love it to have a quiver whether as a tied to item like the old fuel tank with the shish kebab (not that that's a thing in 76 either) or as a backpack skin. 
---
Actually on that it would be nice to have holstered weapons as a backpack skin..
---
Well you can never achieve "true" randomness, at best we have [pseudorandomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness) which is seeded by the current timestamp in milliseconds. So in theory, if the seed is the same you'll get the same order of rolls - like how a Minecraft seed works.
---
P2W btw
---
Thank you, but knowing my luck Ill get everything but a 3 star bloodied
---
Rifle, Angry Turtle, Lone Vault Wanderer, WickedyChickady ü§ô
---
well, my days of playing may already be over.  still doesn't work and no real replies on the support ticket.
---
Ah so in other words, we can expect a fix next year! And then it'll be broken again 1 update after that! Wonderful!
---
I don‚Äôt get the backlash it‚Äôs not all commie it‚Äôs the subjugator vs Armor ace, it‚Äôs a board game and the armour ace rewards are power armour and the other faction is normal armour. I suppose it sucks if you don‚Äôt use PA though. 
---
I hope people role play this battle with the leaders being the level 100 armour and the subjugator skin. 
---
I actually really like that level 100 armour to be honest
---
why?
---
1. I was being facetious since my experience in-game I rarely see other archers out in the wasteland.
---
2. As you see by the amount of updoots and comments it definitely seems like just more than me and ten others would want it.
---
XD
---
yeah I honestly thought there was something unique about my system until I found this post. It's clearly not widespread enough to cause an uproar, maybe only some AMD cards have this problem?
---
Get a vampires Ultracite Gatling you will be completely invincible
---
Please review more weapons :D
---
You deserve my up vote my hood sir thats a splendid  idea
---
Would be nice mumurgh 1 free voucher to use at her store
---
I made my character anorexic. Works as a charm.
---
Thanks to everyone that linked up tonight to slay Earle! We managed to get 4 runs in before the server took a crap. Had fun!
---
Ya kinda gotta remember that Lyons BoS was a unique group of the faction, Maxsons Brotherhood is the original "standard" for what the BoS stands for in pretty much all of the games
---
If anything, I expect them to be like the BoS from the Tactics game, where it's a mix of Maxsons and Lyons BoS
---
Wow thank you very much! I‚Äôm happy to see that I‚Äôll have a chance to get the chicken coop. That‚Äôs probably the one thing I didn‚Äôt get that I‚Äôm sad I didn‚Äôt. Also happy to see Legendary perks are finally arriving. Thanks again.
---
Just out of scientific interest ;) how many baits does it take to destroy stuff usually ?
---
Search Fallout76 on YouTube. The three listed are all good in their own ways. There are others too.  
---
Shishkabob. That's funny. I can't remember the last time I picked one up. I'm sure I scrapped it if I did.
---
People say that this will change with One Wasteland, but I doubt it. Once leeches get that initial dopamine rush of getting free rewards at other people‚Äôs expense, they rarely ever put forth any effort towards anything. If they do, it‚Äôs usually to benefit their gameplay, not to help anybody else.
---
The worst part is that, after awhile, players that *do* actually contribute eventually get salty from all the complacent AFKers/Leeches and join them in spite of what they stand for. There‚Äôs been a few times where I‚Äôd purposefully had the event fail because people were very obviously letting me do all the work and I didn‚Äôt want them to benefit at all. Call it petty, but I don‚Äôt really care.
---
Cheers but I‚Äôm good for arrows for now.
---
I'm aware of that.  What I mean is that some people claim if you're in particular server, it's impossible to roll certain effects.
---
That‚Äôs good to hear. Explosive is good for max damage plus with the bonus effect of sometimes sending ghouls rag dolling off in the sky.
---
Outcast paint for the power armor. I'm a sucker for black and red
---
I know.  I was hoping for groups.  A group joins, data is recorded, and leaves, then B group, then C group.
---
I‚Äôm Calling bullshit on that. It‚Äôll be random with each item and perk having a certain percent chance of rolling
---
Wanna try a quad double barrel? It's fun, fast and quick to reload. Too bad it's shit
---
I love the glitched Line in the Sand when 6 players with confetti mess are slaughtering the scorched as they spawn. It's pure mayhem with body parts flying everywhere. Oh, and confetti too.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£Bad ass, glad to hear it... I think I put like eight or nine hours straight my first day. It happens. Lol, Be safe out there man!
---
Awesome. Gonna prod you when I'll get into that..
---
And I'm calling SCIENCE!  To be clear, I agree with you.  It makes no sense.  I fully expect it to be psuedo random, but I want to test it.  That's why I'm asking for volunteers.  The only thing I want is your time.
---
Thanks! Its a lot more friendly than I had heard, but maybe Im just lucky. Seeing a nuke go off within my first few hours really helped with the badassery of it. I was able to get a good view and everything
---
Enemy boss fight.
---
hell yeah it was brutha
---
Tbf I think I wasted all of
---
Mine yesterday. Problem is you can test
---
It and have no One Get a great weapon and then swap servers and you get one. But it will still just be chance
---
For the ‚ÄúA colossal problem‚Äù event
---
You've all been played. They have all been insult bot in disguise, whilst you are away from camp hes inviting his mate biv around to chug all your nukashine and taking turns on your ally XD.
---
What?
---
Ultimate chad move: join them in AFKing and have the event fail.
---
Ive heard theres good flux up there
---
Free radicals?
---
Not if you make friends with it.
---
Double barrel Shotgun needs at least one too
---
It should be able to pick from the ones you own. If you dont already own those its weid.
---
Hemlock Holes is the area where violet flux is in abundance and the easiest to collect. One run will net over 500.
---
I hope they still remember that they belonged to the American army, not an armed mob that imitated the medieval knight system. 
---
Appalachian has enough trouble. We don‚Äôt need a group of dangerous militants who have forgotten all of their civilization only thirty years after the nuclear war.
---
Its scorched and imune to exploding dmg
---
That's a placeholder spot for the nuke art to place when the server has loaded that a nuke is placed, but hasn't loaded where yet.
---
Stay on the server for longer than a minute and you'll see that.
---
How many HRF can you find tho?
---
Well that's the thing.  If it looks like it's just chance, than it probably is.  If we roll a total of 500 weapons and none of them are bloodied, that's pretty sketch.
---
When you kill Earle.
---
Never seen that one. Sounds like a waste of a good nuke.
---
or take a buffout
---
Can we also add to this don‚Äôt throw a fit when I refuse to sell you my best gun and then Nuke my camp - True Story
---
Well I know you can certainly have two 3* nocturnal ones
---
Thank you very much ‚úåÔ∏èüòÅ If I could use the lmg nest, that would be nice ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Btw: It seems it cannot hold more than 1 pound of scrap? Is that normal?
---
üëç
---
They're not immune. You already know why the damage is low
---
More often than it if I tour the fissure sites I get three rather quickly
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
No it doesn‚Äôt matter if you get more than one of the same item with the same perks
---
Let me educate you on this.
---
People were worried and this was before the season started.  We had no double score and nothing to base it off.  Then the score bug happened and players were losing score hand over fist.  This forced Bethesda to add more double score and more challenges to make up for it.
---
So those not affected finished it quite fast, and early.  Like the rest of the game, there was no balancing of when people would finish.  Bethesda can win.  By fixing the damn score bug that has been posted daily since the season began.  It's embarrassing that 10 whole weeks have gone by and they aren't any further.
---
Now here is the other thing.  A lot of us liked the dailies and free atoms.  So those that have finished the run have lost that option.  What makes it more annoying is that the challenges are there with 0 reward and the score repeatable keeps popping up to add insult to injury.  Like just disable it once a player has finished.  Don't be lazy and leave in something that has no meaning or relevance to the gameplay.  
---
So please, before you jump to Bethesdas defense, think about why.  There are posts that rightly criticize aspects of this game and there is always a few comments that completely ignore op's point.  If anything expressing these dissatisfactions help improve the game.
---
I‚Äôve been in on my own once it‚Äôs not too bad. I use a vampires Gatling, so I‚Äôm fine until reload time where I run around like a maniac spamming stimpaks.
---
1 perk card gives you 2 legendary perk coins when scrapped
---
I haven't but that sounds horrible having to listen to the same 3 songs over and over.
---
I'd kinda appreciate them coming in like that, that's how they originally were, and it would offer a more interesting group than just 'We're literally the knights in shining armor'.
---
That and most, if not all of us ARE REGISTERED MEMBERS of the Enclave. To the point of being Generals.
---
Plus- it just adds into my argument that the Institute were the good guys of Fallout 4.
---
They was good in fo4 tho, i miss laser musket
---
I was glad to trade in my shitty commie bot (only got it cos it was discounted) for the BoS not but fuck I really don't like it's dialogue. Honestly about to scrap it and return the commie bot...
---
Hopefully Ace comes back and is discounted hell I might even get him if he's full price. 
---
I will say there was one good line "I wonder if they make power armour in my size". Like why can't it be in the same vein as that vs insulting me and my camp for no reason?
---
I‚Äôd also like to see more skins and mods for the compound bow
---
Hang on you get a higher budget of special? I don‚Äôt remember seeing this but I haven‚Äôt been on the PTS for a while
---
From what I know yeah, it‚Äôs been the same engine for a long time now and still carries old ass bugs from years ago, the ‚ÄúCreation Engine‚Äù which used to have a different name
---
You didn‚Äôt cop the squatter so you‚Äôre getting punished by receiving an unusable item
---
Sometimes I think about burning this camp down ü§£
---
A guy i play with managed to get it to over 8k damage per hit, with a 1 star bloodied compound bow.  
---
The bow benefits from the same chems as all the rifles do!
---
A lot of these problems with the legendary mechanic would be solved if you had the ability to split level 3/4 cards back to singles again. Why can‚Äôt we do this?
---
There's reason to believe Sarah's death was a cover-up.
---
Given we have the fixer, cursed items, vault armors (solar, third, strangler, CSS) and sacrificial blade it isn't like you couldn't stack 5 effects on the Mistress gear and overtake anything. 
---
I was suggesting just adding 3 stars, period, to each, randomly. You could tweak them in other ways as well but maybe not as much fun. You could just increase the benefits of the Eye and scale them (faster movement sneaking, other static effects), but I think the hunt for random effects that suits you would be more fun.
---
You have 3 items of clothing (garb, veil, eye) and 2 weapons. 3x Unyielding. Lifesaver, Autostim, Chameleon. 3x Vanguard. Hell poison or rad resist on the second effect. Weapons as Bloodied, Junkie, Furious, Two Shot, Instigating, etc. Just keep blade from dropping AA and voice from dropping Troubleshooter.
---
Garb also needs a mod slot but whatever ... asbestos, biocomm, lead lined, deep pockets, the stagger one, etc. Again, drop plans as part of daily. And there are a FEW revolvers in the real world you can suppress. Want to make the Voice awesome? Make it be a WHISPER and give it a silencer in addition to other .44 mods. Seems like something Frederik would be able to swing. 
---
I prefer this as it would give people different options and something to chase (still RNG I know I know) rather than a base change that is simply done.
---
I wear the tattered dress and veil over armor. Sadly can't wear the eye, but those 2 work.
---
wait what?! im only level 30 but feel like im outgunned and outleveled even with on level gear.
---
all is well
---
If it still works, you can get almost unlimited amounts of stabilising materials by claiming the workshop over and over again with a friend
---
Yeah legendary bows are a rare find, compound bows being even rarer. I‚Äôve bought most of my bows from others players whereas I‚Äôve only a had a compound bow drop once for me. Actually go it from Earle at ACP.
---
Yes, it's the queen of all things scorched. It is by no means your friend. Shoot on sight.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like more skins for the compound bow as well. Although I do understand why since (I would assume) only a small amount of players have access to the compound bow due to it being a max reputation reward. Hence why more skins for the regular bow. And yes among other weapons I would love the ability to just craft legendary versions using modules like the bullion items.
---
Oh hell yes. Also arrows actually have an arc and travel which makes leading your shots actually makes a difference. I hate how bullets are just lasers.
---
Weapon legendaries are definitely based off the weapons you use, and less likely to give you the same if you already have said legendary prefix.
---
I used Bloodied DCG for 200 levels &amp; can confirm, I 90% got melee related, 3/10 were bloodied.
---
You make a new account, and trade with your old one.
---
Angry Turtle made a video yesterday. There's like double daily and weekly challenges compared to season 1. Check out his video on YouTube.
---
Read the post before commenting
---
Seems like a stupid change to implement without an actual overall balance pass.  Also seems dumb to let radically imbalanced systems to go unbalanced for so long that almost all of the games players rely on the broken mechanics (because why would they not) then to pull the rug out so bluntly.  It's just going to piss people off.    
---
A re-balance absolutly was necessary, but this one, and the way it was done was not it.
---
Repair kits would be nice. I'm always on short supply
---
I actually have one. It does a silly amount of damage in vats but it's basically 2 sticks jammed together
---
I usually just check my map for low level players and go give them some!
---
Tough but fair
---
Lmao I might, this was pretty fun to make
---
I did, isn‚Äôt that where the mine is located? My bad if I‚Äôm mistaken
---
This would really awesome, I would like a backpack that allows me to carry more ammo in power overall so I can let go of batteries included and bandoleer.
---
I amüòÇ so far I‚Äôve given 25 people today 20 stims each because they won‚Äôt be able to carry them
---
Yes, the game doesn't track what you have and limit it from the pool.  If it did you could just carry all the shitty stuff and only get epic drops.  :P
---
But if they have the perk I give 100
---
That seems like an oversight doesn't it? I'm sure there will be a solution for the next one. This was to first one, so now they know there's a problem with it. The Run is over for you. Do what you did before.
---
Most north western part. The mine isn't most north, and not north western. He's talking about the cornern where the free radicals live
---
lol
---
yes please.
---
Ah I see now, my apologies
---
I've had countless melee weapons and never ever gone melee in my 2000+ hours of playing. If anything I get more heavy weapons than anything else, some times rifles but it's a rarity. Early in game I had a machete but once I got a hunting rifle melee was gone. Maybe the purveyor wants me to try melee now that I think of it.
---
On paper it sounds like it should be pretty good. The firerate on mine says 25 but I can fire a crossbow faster which just seems so odd. I killed a level 62 ghoul in 2 hits so there's that haha
---
They should change dialogue if you wear BoS clothing
---
How?
---
They are doing big changes 2 years after release that will most likely implement bugs into our weapons and builds messing them up more than they wanted too I feel like the first week after patch 22 is live it will suck so much
---
I use these high lvl events to grind lvls for my extra characters when I want to make a new build(My main nearly lvl 400 bloodied stealth commando)
---
I have a two full set uny combat armor shadowed at lvl 20 and 30
---
And two bloodied handmade lvl 15 and 25 with hardened receiver. At lvl 20 I run with max 20% health with adrenal reaction mutation. (Took some time to collect these things) I one shot most high lvl mobs with this combination.
---
So not all low lvl are bad. Yesterday one guy yelled at the microphone that I was a noob (+ a lot of other bad words and I shouldn't be at the colossal problem(he got reportedüòÖ) but who died all the time and who revived him yes the lvl 20. Im just at these event to grind xp üòÖ
---
My point still stands. Both of those games are multiplayer, and use mmo style grinding at their core. Both are also extremely popular and well played games.
---
Fo76 will not lose a good chunk of its user base. Most will adjust accordingly.
---
It's been this way forever. It would actually be quite fun with a bit of love
---
&gt;...Fo76 will lose a good chunk of its player base.
---
Unlikely as Bethesda are dealing with an addicted player base who will just find the new meta and exploits to compensate.
---
New players will have a chance to help take down tanky enemies instead of just doing 1 damage. And tougher enemies mean more xp. So yeah, tough because enemies are gonna be tougher, but fair for everyone
---
Exactly, on the PTS weapon perk cards give no damage anymore, bloodied barely gives damage nothing gives damage and everything is tankier, sounds sooooo fuuunnn
---
Just get rid of the reason this is getting implemented. Legacy weapons. It's the people that can one tap the scorch queen that complain and they're the only voice heard by bethesda
---
I don‚Äôt use plasma rifles but take my updoot. We really need skins for weapons that have missed out the longest.
---
Helping the people in the here and now obviously. Saving technology for the future doesn‚Äôt mean anything if everyone‚Äôs dead or suffering before the future gets here.
---
‚ÄúWe preserved some laser rifle technology so it wasn‚Äôt lost to time, even though that family of four across the way got mauled by mutants and one of them or their descendents in the future could have possibly found cures for cancer or revert feral ghouls, But hey at least we saved this weapon schematic right?‚Äù
---
The assaultron head is just a glorified Christmas tree decoration too. Weapons that need the quad prefix are usually garbage, it's such a shame
---
The fact that you can put 9 points into a set of perks just for it to do barely any dmg changes is why I think it‚Äôs still broken but Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care along with not a lot of people talk about it and Bethesda‚Äôs just going to find out after release that they fucked up
---
Fun facts: the cryolator and flamer both work in stealth and won't break it either but to be fair they ask for a lot of materials for ammo
---
I dont think it's a silly question. Better than finding out the hard way. 
---
Yes, you'll benefit from any damage modifiers for Scorched on your equipment and they count towards 'Kill x Scorched"  challenges.
---
You are thinking about new players here, what about the majority of the player base who aren‚Äôt low level and aren‚Äôt interested in burning 20 shots into a level 100 deathclaw with a min maxed bloodied stealth commando
---
The do gain is almost none it‚Äôs like 200ish xp more for ghouls and 400ish xp for supermutants it‚Äôs really not how Bethesda is portraying the exp gain
---
I use the references whenever I can, my way of keeping the series alive after it‚Äôs ended. (Tis why my profile picture is Alucard as well. TFS Hellsing Ultimate Abridged was pure gold.)
---
**Sigh** 
---
I miss TFS. :(
---
Thank you kind stranger!
---
They‚Äôll all switch to magic weapons and hacked weapons just to do dmg to Earle and SBQ
---
Thanks for the advice I shall experiment with this üëç
---
Yes and tuesday
---
Yawn
---
Probably a stupid question but have you got the perk that negates armor weight for sneak?
---
Yea distant thunder is really fun with confetti if you can get the event area where they all just spawn in the lake. Its a fucking party then
---
well you'd need 2 machines and 2 accounts and just trade with yourself.
---
My guy is always wearing a BOS officers Underarmor and a full set of unyielding urban scout armor, that‚Äôs when he said he was disappointed.
---
I thing it's because of the reload animation because the quad double barrel does the same thing, yet the quad assaultron head is similar to the repeater as well
---
We need arcade machines to load pipboy games into them.
---
Finding issues and fixing them is difficult, just dropping damage across the board is easssy.  :P
---
Never tried that, added to my to test list üëç
---
Hell yeah! That would be rad.
---
I know, I was a cryo-stealther for a week or so, but like you say the ammo was just too much, and that was even back when workshop gave you processed materials.
---
So they copy pasted code across like so much in the game üò¢
---
Yeah me too, the Lunchboxes are great...!
---
Another tip, if you have a companion when you sleep at your camp you get "You feel your lover's embrace" for three hours.
---
&gt;Simply
---
that's not really the case
---
That's a fair price I'd say. Could be where you're based? I have a feeling unyielding will be even more sought after when One Wasteland hits since everyone gets more XP from the intelligence on top of enemy level
---
They removed them from the drop table for being overpowered. Then knowingly left them in inventories. Why not just completely remove them from the game if you didn't want people to have such overpowered weapons? Then nerf everything because those said people are bored because they're overpowered
---
I don‚Äôt know who down voted this but I chuckled
---
Bro the only people that can one tap the SBQ are unarmed speed runners and those guys are intense they are basically just there to see how much dmg they can get the average meta build can‚Äôt one shot Earle or the SBQ the fact that most ppl think that way is stupid yes we do a lot of dmg to said bosses but that‚Äôs what you get when you are high level in a game you have high dps and dmg which you should be able to have because you most likely put a lot of time into grinding and gear
---
Hacked weapons, Legacy weapons and Magic weapons have issues but Bethesda doesn't choose to do something for whatever reason. Most single shot firing weapons are not viable anymore and getting damage perk cards isn't worth it. 
---
Releasing the model in its incomplete state is stupid, they should do more testing imho.
---
If I'm bored enough to go to lucky hole mine I'll get most of the mats from there but cryos and flamers seem like weapons you have to work for. I'm thinking of heading to Earle for ammo since his spawns give a lot of ammo back, but it shouldn't have to be that way
---
Now I'm glad I posted before NNN.
---
I'm being careful to land really slowly and do a little hover dance before touch down, only a few inches, still die. With marsupial and team perks I can jump way higher from the ground and never die like this.
---
I don't think build is relevant tbh, why should I die when dropping a foot or a few inches, just seems daft or lazy on Bethesda's part.
---
Nothing in this game should be a thing, it's all fantasy anyway.
---
Exactly, people killing the SBQ in 20 second with all the buffs and a perfectly made build is fine, people with no skills and no buffs two shotting it with magic and hacked weapons are real problems.
---
And so you do - coincidentally I came across it yesterday!  I felt guilty at the time, but hey it was unlocked.
---
Thanking you.
---
I had real high hopes for the bow but was let down when I finally got one damage sucked. But after reading this def gunna give it another go. I‚Äôve been down since day one of the beta. I‚Äôm super worried this nerf with next patch is gunna be the last straw for me.
---
Yet this change is needed because we are ‚Äúone shotting‚Äù too much we are high levels in a online game why should we not one shot a lot of thingsüòÇ
---
How do I change cdkeys? Is it that you make a Fallout 76.exe and Fallout 76b.exe and somehow they target two different accounts?
---
Good point, I agree this will likely be the thing otherwise people will just stop running the queen and Earl events.
---
But I want to be a spy...

---
Yeah magic weapons will keep the events lively but also mess with our dmg later on because Bethesda is brain dead sometimes and thinks nerfing regular weapons will get rid of hacked/magic weapons
---
Yeah this is the big issue the bow has. Fire rate and the general bugginess of vats.
---
My issues are pretty similar.
---
1.Its so awkward that red and unwieldy to just fire it. The accuracy is worse than any other weapon in the game and can't be modified. So using it OUT of vats isnt possible. You can't reliably aim at anything at range and hit it.
---
2. In vats all types of issues seem to happen, and it is difficult to reproduce them. One bug I often run into is having 95% accuracy and missing multiple times in a row, but I find the most effective way to vats is by knocking the arrow, then vatsing in almost as I release the arrow. The timing is hard to explain but it cuts off a significant portion of the draw time.
---
3. The fire rate is slow and there seems to be a an issue that arises often where you nock the arrow and the animation happens but no arrow can be knocked.
---
4. They break fast especially with the arrow mods, I usually carry a few of them for this reason.
---
All of that being said, the range is insane and if properly specced it hits hard, and you use the quick nock/vats method you can increase the fire rate by like 30-40%. And applying different added weapon bonuses via the arrow is neat... but it doesn't stack up against rifles or heavies, or even pistols for that matter. Poison and fire are kinda pointless in this game, the plasma one is kinda cool, and the explosive bow hits pretty hard specced out and bloodied. The ultracite hits the hardest but I find the most utility from the cryos.
---
I find the cryo arrows are really helpful against SQB, tho less so against Earle. But they are mega clutch in SQB fight. I have a cryo and explosive bow I use on my shotgun build as a ranged backup I can use with no bow card specs and it's useful. 
---
But tbh my level 90 bow guy is just gathering dust. It's hard to do a lot of events because he one shots everything aside from the biggest mobs and playing solo just isn't smart in this game.
---
If the bows felt more comprehensive to use I would love them, for example overwatch bow feels great, even skyrim or zelda feel better to use than the fo76 bow.
---
For that I nuke WS and farm it over and over, more than 100 from one nuke.
---
Heh, haven't tried this one yet. Thanks.
---
Join the club. I cant die of fall damage, despite me not having fall damage reduction armour, perks or mutations.
---
I grinded my ass of for months, and then another few months for my weapon and armor, I deserve to one shot shit if I want to one shot shit
---
i have several thoughts on this rebalance.
---
first and foremost, i totally agree with bethesda on ironing this out.  the old way, was a rats nest of coding.  good and fun for a single player engine in a single player game, but in multiplayer practice it was a minefield of possible problems.
---
on another hand.... this is something they should have either fixed prior to launch or soon after.  waiting this long was idiotic.
---
while i do feel for the people that have sunk a lot of time and effort into "god" tier builds... some of us don't want to play as a bloodied or a junkie.  you've had your fun being insurmountable mountains and literally making nearly every other build look like garbage in comparison.  time for more stuff to be on more level ground.
---
by the same token as above though, the why and how of bethesda waiting this long to fix this situation, yeah i don't know what they're smoking but this is way overdue.
---
my final thoughts fall on the legacy weapons.  while i'm not very familiar with them, if bethesda has the means to track and disable them... they should.  in every game i've played over the years having some kind of unattainable items was just bad for everyone's health.  if we're talking cosmetic or flavor items, yeah, sure, whatever.  with them you're talking just strict value.
---
legacy weapons are, i'd wager, a big part of what keeps there from being any kind of meaningful pvp in this game.  as long as they're on the table, there will never be path to anything beyond something self contained like nuclear winter.
---
Might review this next. It's so hilarious useless
---
I traded from basically nothing to get my Be .50 cal I have today grinded to get mods for my PA grinded to get the bullion to build the rest of my strangler grinded for ammo my whole gameplay has just been grinding to this moment just to have what I‚Äôve built up for so long to be made terrible and useless with one stupid decision by Bethesda
---
It will now only be Bloodied and TSE things that can do half decent, nerfing the damage model nerfs all builds so bloodied will still be on top, just worse by a lot than before
---
Yeah I think all ammo crafting needs to be simplified, and spawn of all ammo needs to be balanced (ballistic ammo is literally *everywhere* while lots of energy ammo is extremely rare to find as loot) and all of the press and spray ammo use needs to be adjusted down dramatically.  Getting ammo shouldn't be such a chore.
---
1 machine is okay, if its not total potato. My pc with i5 4460 with 8gb ram(sad me) and rx5708gb able to launch 2 copies for trading, one from bethesda and one from steam (lowering settings before trading)
---
Same thing, I grinded for a B2525 fixer, I grinded a full uny/ap/htd heavy combat armor set, I grinded all the levels needed, and now Bethesda making me just slightly stronger than people that run no damage perks
---
With diminishing returns, 250-300 is probably the average most people run around with. Around 350-ish, you're already pushing the boulder up hill. 400+ you're trying to crush water from stone and are pretty much 'capped'.
---
This includes power armor. With a caveat:  
---
PA has a hidden passive 42% DR and 90% RR (*7% DR and 15% RR per piece on the Frame*) before displayed resistances are even applied. PA will always tower over standard armor in terms of protection because of this.
---
If you play on a PC then simply keep a spare SSD with a dedicated Windows 10 and FO76 install that you can swap in and out depending on your mood, no more huge downloads for you.

Counter Point: What if there never really was a Danse? 
---
The Mayor got found out and was like ‚ÄúOh sh*t they know I‚Äôm a synth and helping the institute!‚Äù But Danse got found out and his reaction was ‚ÄúWait... I‚Äôm a synth?? I have to die.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt some sleeper agent for the institute or anything like that, he didn‚Äôt even know he was one of the bad guys. 
---
My guess is that Danse has always been a Synth, not killed and replaced by one. If he was killed and replaced by one then he would have had a ‚ÄúOh sh*t I‚Äôm caught‚Äù moment. He‚Äôs probably one that the Railroad saved and had a face change and memory wipe, and then just ended up joining the brotherhood.
---
...But no, that fool Maxon couldn‚Äôt see that, even as Danse voluntarily got on his knees to be executed by his ‚ÄúFriend‚Äôs‚Äù Hand.
---
My weapons are decent still like my build wasn‚Äôt hit as hard as others but perks like the riflemen perks are useless to equip post patch when the patch went live I watched captain noob put on 3 rank 3 perk cards to get 36 dmg added onto his weapon I agree that bloodied needed a nerf and that the current nerf is terrible in its current state but it comes back to buffing other builds like if they buffed other things a bit and brought down the meta a bit I would be completely fine but nerfing the shit out of the meta and nerfing everyone else is not the way to do it
---
This\^\^
---
I actually can't find how I got to that number, that was several weeks ago.
---
100 levels gives you 179 perk cards (100/5*9 or 99 + (100/5*4)) (odd number since level 1 does not have any perk cards)
---
179 - 56 equipped = 123 spare perk cards at level 100 which is 246 perk points, way over my estimation even with plentiful spare cards and moved special
---
oh aye. pc. wasn't thinking.
---
PIPE WEAPONS.
---
I want chrome/ cherry wood
---
I have an idea for how Bethesda can do this. They just make it a camp decoration that requires a jumbo mr fuzzy to craft. The item would require the specific jumbo fuzzy that it looks like. It would be a bit like the frog in a jar thing that's already available.
---
It‚Äôs very discouraging that someone who just picks up a gun and puts a perk or two on can get close to a high level min-maxed build with god tier gear it‚Äôs just mind boggling that they thought it was just fine
---
I'm in: in-game ID: Redzort
---
I have two characters that are on 900 something at scrip
---
Ye this is pc help thread üòä, you are right for consoles tho. Until some wizard finds a way to launch 2 copies on xbone, but it might explode 100% üòÅ
---
How many legendary bows have you seen in vending machines? I think I've seen 2-3... in months.
---
They touch a single hair on that green boy‚Äôs head or his cow‚Äôs heads, I‚Äôm going to make the Prydwen falling out of the sky look like a joke.
---
Would be cool if we could have a holotape reader for the TV with a 'controller' so we can play the pipboy games on the TV at our camps.
---
I can mod your bow with iron sights if you're on PS4. PSN xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero)  
---
Can't help the awkwardness of using one though ;(
---
once i get the new xbox i'm gonna account share with myself and then i can trade with myself. Means i wont need to use f01st again
---
Have you played the PTS or are you whining about something you havent even played yet? 
---
I read through the comments and you seemed pissed because you "grinded" for the best gear ...duped gear.... Heres actual damage numbers from the PTS. Bloodied still does double the damage as the next best build.  So stop acting like all your stuff is completely useless now. It is still the best option for damage output by a long ways.
---
Ah dad‚Äôs rifle? Don‚Äôt remember that one, I remember getting Autumn‚Äôs coat and pistol from that though.
---
(But for me the luck shades always fell off the mannequin as I entered the cell on PS3, so I had to do the same trick I used at project purity to get the coat and pistol.)
---
With that, 1800 - 50 - 105 - 105 - 246 = 1296
---
1296 / 3,6 = 360 levels, + base 100 = 460 levels, which is where my math was wrong, I forgot to add base levels
---
I'd also like to see a cooking station for people who rely on buffs (I don't, but I might make something while I wait)
---
It's a decent start but if Bethesda just rests on their laurels with this only, every one is going to be pissed, both the ones that hate lower numbers &amp; the reformists who want combat balance.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand, ALL BUILDS ARE NERFED, so I‚Äôm either nearly dead like usual doing the same damage as a junkies before patch, or I‚Äôm not half dead and I‚Äôm doing piss all against bullet sponges
---
Wouldn't that be 21 people? I'm assuming it's your private world and you'll be present.
---
still bugged. had the same issue sigh. thanks for the post and answers!
---
I completely understand how it works. Have you played the PTS? Or are you getting worked up for no reason?
---
The cd key is only used to enable the second account, no need to do a second install.  Create a desktop shortcut from the fallout76.exe file on your desktop.  Start the game through the launcher and when you character is fully loaded, open your pip-boy and alt-tab back to the desktop, double click on the FO76 shortcut and a second instance will start up, when presented, use your ‚Äúmule‚Äù account to log in.  At the start screen, open up social and join your other account.  Create a team with the invite coming from your main account and join up.  Select a location near a vendor and have your alt build a nice camp, which your main can add stuff to so it will be complete.  I used the area behind the Overseers camp as your alt might have to walk there the first time.  Now you can have your main drop stuff, alt-tab and switch to your alt and pick it up and put it into his/her stash.  You can also drop stuff on your alt, and they can walk to the vendor and gain caps.  Doesn‚Äôt need a massive PC to do this, but just give it a few seconds after you switch for RAM to settle down and the swap file to stabilize.  Make sure you bring up the map, hit ‚Äúz‚Äù to get to the ‚Äúquit‚Äù menu BUT count to 10 before you actually press quit to make sure the servers have caught up to your actions.  Been doing this since the game started and have had no issues.
---
Yeah I get what you mean. Unless you‚Äôre a specialised build the damage output isn‚Äôt the greatest. But even before I became a junkies build I still persevered with the bow because I found it so fun. And yeah I‚Äôm not sure how bows are going to go with the upcoming nerf but I‚Äôm reserving judgment for now.
---
Fuck bethesda for all those mobile game shit, like weight, no mail or daily caps, it all comes from that üí©, i dont even need mule in other mmos (even if fo76 is not massive lol)
---
Also I walk around in a private server, sometimes with a few buddies, me or them aren‚Äôt mad that I one shot everything, so why would Bethesda be nerfing me, they‚Äôre just gonna end up nerfing people‚Äôs fun
---
You added 100 levels to 411 instead of 50 levels since you're going with level 50 as starting point, so 461 instead of 511?
---
Yes
---
I think it had something to do with explosive over-riding the plasma ‚Äúorbs‚Äù you shoot with regular bullets so they didn‚Äôt have travel time? Iirc, which I may not.
---
Oh, makes senseüòÇ
---
So a Z/E lmg is a stupid weapon?
---
Thanks I understand it now.
---
The randomness. Once I was exploring and came upon a scorchbeast fighting a player and I jumped in and we both killed it. Giving away low level gear. Running into 10 decent people for every a$$hole. Finding suitcases full of plans in railroad stations and leaving the known ones for the next player.
---
In RDO, you can purchase/and trade the currency? I don't play it but I vaguely remember something to that effect. I imagine a similar restriction would be in place here since caps can be bought with RL money and traded in game. It's unfortunate but true. 
---
Also, anything NV related is gunna be locked behind a FO1st paywall, just like the Desert Ranger outfit, they know they can milk cash off old Obsidian shit.
---
Sorry what are you trying to say?
---
Are you unable to place your camp or your stored blueprints?
---
Are we being truthful here? All your trade posts indicate you play XB1. Lying to enforce your "point" does really help anything. 
---
Im on PS4, have not played yet. Read a TON and watched a bunch ld youtube about it. Its very mixed opinions. Generaly bloodied are double tapping lvl 100 enemies. Im waiting to actually plah it beforw i make judgement.
---
Problem with stealth damage is that if someone has agrroed the target your shooting at you no longer do any extra sneak damage to it even though it says you are so the stealth person would have to shoot first for the Follow Through buff then the other person agrro for taking one for the team. Obviously if its a boss enemy like the SBQ or Earl it's gunna be impossible to have both up for long that 10 seconds.
---
I love using bows, there‚Äôs something satisfying about using a bow with an arrowhead made out of what is basically kryptonite for the scorched. It‚Äôs fun to shoot an arrow and something‚Äôs head explodes with that **Splak** sound. It‚Äôs like semi auto rifles but better.
---
(Plus is was fun to show off to a level 10, they couldn‚Äôt believe I killed a scorched beasts with three arrow headshots after we spent an hour fighting one scorched beast on my lower level character.)
---
My dream is to find a bloodied bash damage compound bow. (Bloodied because I‚Äôm a bloodied build and bash damage because I love the melee on the bow, you just f*cking deck em, Bwa ha ha.)
---
Fallout -7835021 is coming out in 3021
---
If you have a strong enough sneak build to stay hidden (you'll need armor with harder to detect while sneaking to make sneaking powerful, 1 piece is enough to make a big difference with maxed out Sneak in agility), you can run E.M.T, Injector, Healing Hands (bloodied builds will hate if you use healing hands on them) with Suppressor &amp; Tenderizer putting you at 13 charisma, this will make your revives much more powerful and give your teammate a chance of actually getting up and moving. Plus the tenderizer/suppressor combo both making the enemy take more and deal less damage. 
---
You can take it further by carrying stimpack diffusers and hotwheel them to use right after you revive someone to boost their health even more. Also you can carry a medics rifle with vat crit fill and less cost for extra healing, even just a medics rifle and another main rifle with vats crit fill. You use one for damage, swap to medics and heal with your crits (Bonus points if your team uses revenant for the damage boost when revived.)
---
"You're lucky I cant kill you" she didnt give me the power armour piece in grafton dam, very mean.
---
I have a PC, I don‚Äôt play on it and a friend let me borrow his Bethesda account so I try the PTS, he has a extremely similar build and same weapon/armor. Don‚Äôt accuse me of lying when you don‚Äôt know me.
---
wverything i do know at the time is from youtube videos or reddit posts, but what i fear with this change it that it will do the exact opposite of what it should do imo.
---
I feel like there needs to be more builds variety and even if that means bloodied or junkies get a nerf id be somewhat fine with it.
---
My problem is that as it is now, the change will most likely make builds around weaker weapon types like gunslingers or rifleman even less useful
---
you heavily rely on different damage multipliers in order to make these builds work and if everything gets nerfed you probably will see even more commando and heavy gunners than at the moment
---
bethesda allready said that this change will only be the framework to further balance changes and if thats true im fine with it, however they should keep the changes to the PTS until they are ready to implement these "further changes" aswell
---
also damage perks like guerilla/commando/rifleman etc should work the same way they do now, some of the damage multipliers should stay multiplicative while some could definitely be additive for balance reasons
---
last thought is that imo the decision to implement the rebalancing and one wasteland at a similar time is an idea that i cant get behind
---
it makes thing a bit more complicated than necessary
---
This is exactly what I was looking for thanks
---
Yesss I was half thinking of making a post suggesting to Bethesda to make the season 3 armor skins all shiny black and chrome like the enclave robots. I want a shiny all black scout skin so badly...
---
Dont take it personal, its the internet and people like to banter, and make up shit to support their ideas. Evidence points to you being an xb1 player.
---
If you say you have a PC, and used a friends account than cool i beleive ya.
---
Aight thx everyone for responding
---
relax bro. you are NOT a piece of scrap
---
I forgot about that CAMP skin, got it like a month ago, kinda forgot about it.
---
Awesime! what a coincidence,  lol. I leave it unlocked. Enjoy and stop by whenever. No guilt required. It refills üòä
---
went through that quest 3 times. what a pain in the ass that little shit is.
---
My commie bot keeps me supplied with grenades, which I promptly turn into MIRV grenades. 
---
Thank you, comrade robot. I WILL work harder.
---
I second this. one of the best mods for F4 was placeable junk, made evertyhing feel more homey.
---
They will get to know about ZAX and Vault 51 as well.
---
Yeah, pretty annoyed, tbh. I guess it's time to make a mute the collectron mod.
---
Id like to add 2 quutes from valseek. First one was said 18 days ago, second one yesterday
---
*Hi,*¬†
---
*No, the damage bonus calculation changes are not intended to make the game seem harder. Previously, the way damage scaled with all the buffs you could accumulate through Perks, legendary effects, food, etc., etc., was pretty unwieldy to work with from a development perspective. The changes that are in the PTS right now greatly simplify how those bonuses affect your damage.¬†As a result, we have a much better path forward to make smarter and more effective balance changes (and buffs!) These changes look like nerfs right now, but they are changes¬†we needed to make as we continue to work on the game and make it even better.
---
I know it's frustrating right now that you're dealing less damage than before, but it opens up more possibilities in terms of balance¬†for us going forward. Will definitely be bringing all of the thoughts folks have been sharing here¬†on the damage bonus changes in the PTS¬†to the dev team. Will let you know what I hear back.*
---
*Thank you!*
---
*Community Manager | Bethesda Game Studios Austin*
---
Second one
---
*Hi, we're still discussing the feedback on the bonus damage changes, and I¬†don't have anything new to share on that yet. Those changes, though, give us more flexibility to make targeted buffs and tweaks going forward. We're still actively reviewing the community's thoughts, so please continue letting us know what doesn't feel up to snuff so that we can keep evaluating different weapons and builds. Thanks!*
---
Idk if you fallow the PTS, but the last couple weeks theyve been doing multiple updates. No changes kn damage as of right now, but doesnt mean theyre not listening to the feedback.
---
Or it goes super sonic when you spawn on it. (after a 2 minute load screen of course)
---
Lately I've been wearing:
---
Oh no, 20 shots (less than a single magazine/clip on most automatic weapons) to kill a deathclaw, theoretically one of the most fearsome &amp; dangerous creatures in the fallout universe. How terrible.
---
Sarcasm aside, here's an example on why the damage system is broken currently. I have a level 25 instigating lever rifle. With max-rank covert operative/bloody mess and three rank 1 rifleman perks (i.e. not the maximum possible damage) this weapon one-shots charred feral ghouls and scorched controllers when I shoot them from stealth. And to be clear that's a bodyshot, not a headshot. While that's lovely for me and makes the game very easy while I remain undetected, objectively there's no way a level 25 gun should be one-shotting level 60+ enemies without even needing headshots. And this isn't even the most optimised stealth rifleman build that I'm running, and the stealth rifleman build is not the strongest in the game. While this update will make the game harder for me, this clearly does need fixing.
---
What‚Äôs in the other display case I saw glasses and that hat but couldn‚Äôt make out the other item? Is that grab-able?
---
Haha yea it just unlocks in the atom store with no real "look im here as well"
---
I hope they follow through with that, the current state of the PTS is not looking good
---
That‚Äôs my favorite glitch, I always laugh so hard when I see these human wendigos running around lol
---
it promotes it? 
---
why do you need 60 stims?
---
Yeah they're pretty odd. I've seen a few, but the outfit and mask on this one really worked well together.
---
Oh this is definitely one of the best I‚Äôve seen, also the Chinese stealth armor and helmet looks absolutely ridiculous when they glitch out like this.
---
If you only lock the container and some guy uses the attached terminal there will be no options to choose
---
Same here. I rebuilt my camp to maximize budget with the new skin selected, Commander Headache then wouldn't move, ever. Changed skin back and layed down the C.A.M.P for rebuild 2.1 and bingo, worked again.
---
Yeah, I mentioned in another post that I'd like to see more ground camp objects not just stuff that would go in houses.. I don't have floors in my camp. It's more of a natural place and there's such few actual rural type stuff that sits on grass or dirt and looks natural.
---
If you are playing with friends, I would recommend getting ammo per card on non-main character and just craft ammo on them, saves up a lot of benefits, but requires friends or fallout 1st and some additional time to transfer resources and ammo between characters, but as a bonus only 1 person in group of friends need to have it since they can craft ammo for everyone
---
Personally I think we should be able to change the wood type, like we can with the baseball bat
---
I got fallout 1st and then spent all my caps on the battle pass for free shit without grinding , and then went and refunded it.  Got my money back and a free load of caps
---
In general they weren't exactly supportive of Veronica or her partner either.
---
I thought it's pizza camp lmao
---
It‚Äôs a Karen...
---
I had it in a nuke cilo at the prep. I stayed in sneak and the robots didn't get attacked
---
For health
---
That thing is bloody horrifying... The power of Christ compels thee.
---
Quivers were worn on the hip, so a double combo with a survivalist style backpack would be good.
---
Agreed, I wish I knew why they chose not to let you mod most things that feature giant lampson top..
---
Hmm the wait for the rubble to clear should be a nice prep time with a box
---
I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks for the fact :)
---
Haven't seen that yet. Have to use my imagination for now.
---
Pretty much [this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iia7dh/low_level_colossal_problem_player/g370mx3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I made to one of the Devs when they said ‚ÄúOne Wasteland will help!‚Äù
---
Good to see it isnt only a problem with me, my CAMP Is above huntersville so that guy would get all the mutants over to my CAMP
---
I sold a dozen 3* armor pieces to the robot vendor last night, to make stash space.
---
We deal.
---
Also, when does this tax collector come to take the caps from the vending machine? How many caps are they carrying, and are they armed? "Raiding the Treasury" could be a fun in-your-camp event.
---
I've been waiting for the Train for 25 years! I want to speak to the manager!

The SBQ does not have any explosive immunity nor explosive resistance

Good luck with tadpole possum raider settlers rep and the boullion
---
This is really my only complaint about the atomic shop. So much of the stuff that is produced is really nice and mostly house-based items. I want more dirty waste land stuff. I do appreciate some of the new raider and junk items that have come out recently which has finally allowed me to do a solid junk camp. But yes I have also petition for more small item clutter.
---
Try raw melon my dude! Food and water in the same item!
---
No worries, it was Hollywood that made the back wearing popular, although incorrect, took too long to draw an arrow. Multiple arrows were also used by skilled archers.
---
Should be 10 pounds
---
That sounds so kick ass downing scorchbeasts with a bow. Bravo! I‚Äôve yet to try ultracite arrows but won‚Äôt be until legendary perks come out so I can maximise crafting them with ‚ÄúAmmo Factory.‚Äù
---
I got a plan for Whistle in the Dark the other day.
---
That would be awesome, especially if the arrows stick. Healing through acupuncture!
---
My second char is a very well build unyielding sneak single shot build. 'She' is lvl 90 and kills lvl 400+ in 2 shots. Too bad after lvl 50 it's just perk card layouts (thank god for the mod)
---
I didn't know gauss weapons could roll an explosive effect!
---
Now that would be a great idea for a perk card for bows. Maybe have it under agility.
---
Would just like to point out that Walter's meth labs from breaking bad were always clean and organized... Now Jesse's lab on the other hand...
---
When I came back to the game around a month ago and saw the survival tents for the first time I thought they were customizable and you were finally able to place junk on tables and shelves, I was excited to I started collecting pieces of junk I wanted to display in my camp because I love having a workspace with cluttered junk and tools all around it
---
Interesting. What's your method? How are you going to disprove randomness?
---
Yeah it's true. I much prefer the Brotherhood like that. Gives them this feeling that they are thinking of the bigger picture for the future rather than focusing on helping every single wastelander. A bit ruthless but it fits the setting and it's nice to have factions that aren't straight up good or bad (looking at you minutemen and railroad).
---
Played with it as an "off-meta" melee build in the PTS (Instigating 2h melee with Furious for boss fights). In live I can one-shot everything up to a lvl 68 Super Mutant with my Instigating Grognak Axe, in the PTS between the new damage model I can't one-shot Super Mutants any more but everything weaker is still game. 
---
Since everything has been nerfed proportionately and the same builds are still the "best", I think the only build some will stop using outright is bloodied melee; compared to other melee builds it's still the highest risk, but now the damage bonus from Unyielding Strength isn't so wildly ahead of what Bloodied ranged builds can do that it may no longer be worth it. And Bloodied in general still drops things relatively quick, so they'll only really feel the pain in boss fights like Earle. 
---
I've maintained on the PTS forums that I'd rather have the damage model delayed if possible, until they roll out some buffs and fix other bugs like energy damage or magic weapons. But if they release as-is I don't believe it will be the clusterfuck people are saying it is; even if done "right" there's gonna be a lot of gnashing of teeth and kicking dirt from players that are salty they can't faceroll everything any more.
---
Would be awesome if they kept it like it is though, I‚Äôve only signed in a few days to do a daily op and I made it halfway through season 2.
---
I have no idea what's going on and I play every day.  I bought at launch and left the stillborn shitfest near enough immediately, only to rediscover it 3 months ago.  
---
I've somehow bumbled my way to lvl 100+ by following other players, and watching Angry Turtle and Lone Vault Wanderer's YT.
---
Same, gets to a point where you don‚Äôt have any other choice!
---
Now for automatic guns where you‚Äôll be chewing through Ammo like a fat kid in a cookie store, Ultracite ammo and prime receivers aren‚Äôt worth it. But Prime bows are. Instead of getting 20 normal arrows you get 70 Ultracite ones when crafting. And since it‚Äôs a bow it‚Äôll take you awhile just to get through 70.
---
Except that doesn‚Äôt work, he had a long history in DC from a young age - one involving other BoS members over a period of time.
---
Danse doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs a synth. Lots of them don‚Äôt. Makes them a better sleeper agent.
---
The mayor knowing he‚Äôs a synth is necessary as it allows him to actively cover up issues arising from Institute misdeeds.
---
I skipped a lot of days for this season and I am about to complete this one without breaking a sweat, then again I was never hit with the autocomplete bug.
---
Ngl... I'd tap.
---
FYI: you dont have to scrap your collectron to access the new one. just store it. then you can choose another one when you want to place it. and you can build a collectron  at every workshop you own, so you can aquire vast amounts of stuff. might come handy if you use a private world...
---
Fallout 1/2/3/NV combat armor skin, there's a bunch of skins for PAs that have completely new meshes, why not give the same treatment to regular armors?
---
I also like to skin the things I wear so I don‚Äôt accidentally scrap them. I‚Äôll even use the skins I bought from you for real $, Bethesda, just please help me mark my equipped items as unscrapable..
---
And I still have scrip for days...and two mules with stuff I am saving for a rainy day.
---
Yeah especially since you can occasionally get some arrows back from downed enemies.
---
It was never official that they will come with Patch 22, I think they will be here this year, but not in Patch 22
---
I have yet to try it but I heard someone say you can even get Ultracite arrows back from the windigos at ACP, wanna try it and see if I spend 1 arrow and get like 10 back or something.
---
Does this mean 4 pieces of Vanguard SS is a waste?
---
If you're computer savvy enough you could unpack the files and do a mesh switch with the hats so when you put on the regular mining helmet it looks like the reclaimed one. I've been trying to do this with a traffic cone but need some more study and practice.
---
There are videos on how to build a mobile base. It covers some of the bugs that prevent you from placing a blueprinted base.
---
If so then you‚Äôll be nocking those ultracite arrows for DAYS.
---
Yeah, I have one mule, guess I'd prefer just to be able to not choose between which items I want to keep lol
---
I instantly regret wasting them assuming nothing happens when their used
---
I‚Äôm excited to try it ha ha ha
---
Thanks:)
---
I carry 10 and have about 10 in my stash. healing factor FTW
---
I've been there, man
---
Even the bloodied version is a joke
---
It's literally in her name. lol
---
I just press i,t,8 and all perk cards get loaded for hacking. Lockpicking. And crafting. (And the luck perks for change in more stuff) after lockpick (what is super easy with the mod that you see a screenwide white bar at the top with a red area. Move in the red. Click. Never break a bobbypin) i press i,t,1 and the perks are back for my build.
---
Add Tyr and Mitzee to that list.
---
Beth wants to make money with those it seems. I bet they are coming on the Atomic Shop. Saving my atoms.
---
well, in your case it might work, the high rate of fire may make it viable.
---
Me please!
---
Are you still a tadpole????? Blabla...... I got my eyes on you... GOODDAY TO YOU!!
---
sadly TFS sold out so they could make more money off the legacy of their product and still "stay on good terms with the industry"
---
No idea however I only play a bloodied character and some days it takes 5+ times every time I fast travel for it too work. Other days it works fine.
---
Logic would dictate that if they're not part of season two then they would be Atom shop items
---
There is?
---
I have added you, come to my camp and I Will drop Them to you.
---
I'd love to play against the Brotherhood as a hostile force. Imagine a storyline where they tried to "negotiate" with the overseer, tensions rise and things escalate, and we get some sort of event that triggers if X amount of nukes are launched, and vault dwellers have to band together to defend the nuke silos from waves of Brotherhood trying to seize them.
---
I agree, think all the energy weapons could use some love with some new skins and also the visual tesla mods for power armor that was available in fallout 4, it could even buff energy weapon damage to make them useful!
---
And the other skin makes it an m16 or something
---
Well... That was unexpected.
---
I've scrapped so many bloodied heavy weapons and unyielding armor I've lost count. Never really paid attention until the legendary run started and I started to grind for exp.
---
They should just make it so all the Combat Rifle skins work on the Fixer, they are pretty much the same gun. The Fixer even uses mods you get from scrapping Combat Rifles, so why not the skin mods?
---
We shouldn't have to pay for Fixer skins seperately, when the texture is no different from the Combat Rifle.
---
I like to think it's just my janky jerry-rigged vending machine eating caps.
---
lol. No offence but you are the one that doesn't understand economy. If you put a limit on money, then your money becomes worthless and other things will take its place. Just like how caps work in Fallout 76. They are worthless, any real trade has to be done with items or ammo.
---
That's a good point! On one hand we're losing a lot of the option to differentiate, on the other, we won't have to cycle through hundreds of cards.. and I mean we can keep what options we want for cards
---
On the last three times I did WS, the first time got 15.  The next two times, two.   How do you farm it to get so many?
---
The BoS is a bunch of racists most of the time. They look like heroes, but usually aren't.
---
I skipped the first few weeks of the SCORE board, didn't play every single day and finished the board a month early.  Idk what people are complaining about honestly with getting the board done :/
---
I know the feel, I once was wondering why I was constantly over encumbered, noticed I had some 90 fusion cores in my inventory... Yeah that might be it.
---
I'm the guy with the fanciest house, i'm the friendliest of my friends, i love giving out free stuff but boy do i love being a cannibal.
---
I have a perk layout that loads almost all weight reduction perks in the game. If i get like 700/450 i press i.t.9. It changes in like 230/550 i travel and press i.t.6 voor scrapping.cooking.repairing.crafting. and when I'm ready. I.t.1 for heavy build perks
---
I've added back and am coming to you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I run at least three silos a night, sometimes six if I do two characters. I will happily pick up master infiltrator. One of my characters has hack/pick 3 baked into his build permanently. 
---
Also, who knows what me coming up for content, an auto hack/pick might be a real life saver, never mind having to swap the cards in.
---
Try for example a Bloodied handmade and then a Be handmade and See the result then you will see
---
When I see characters of your level, I immediately start scouring the map looking for your camp.. The chances of you having that item I'm looking for, or a nice thought out base are greater the higher up you go. And that's as a level 340. 
---
I can't assume low levels are actually new players anymore - some can be alts with better items than me and a great well designed camp to visit!
---
Pencils are made with graphite, not lead, never were :-)
---
You wanna fuck her nosehole?
---
I think that's been patched because it just sits there stinking up the place now without exploding!
---
omg yes
---
I like road leathers shielded for my sneak char. 3 agi 3 per and something else i can't remember
---
Fuck the brotherhood of steel
---
-the brotherhood of water
---
I've heard some youtubers talking about its because of the game not registering you being encumbered, thinking you're overencumbered and then it just spasms.. It just works right? üòÇüòÇü§î
---
You can roll without 3star Sneak card, you'll go into caution a bit more, but it's definitely not a requirement at that point. Best bet is to try it with and without, see if the difference is big enough to bother you.
---
Just remember to take rad x
---
Each sneak perk rank is like the equivalent of 3 agl &amp; effective special max is 25 from what I understand so maybe not really?
---
Bosses could also end up being immune to those effects, maybe
---
Yes I know that, but in the game, they scrap for lead and wood. I won't look a gift horse in the mouth üòú
---
Golddigga
---
There was a mod for Fallout 4 that changed the mesh of the vendor counters with glass cases to have supplies and stuff in there to match the vendor, and it was a must have mod. 
---
But while I‚Äôd love to have shelves full of clutter we could put down, my camp is at max capacity. Only way this is gonna work is if they give us way more camp budget. 
---
(I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôve almost scrapped all my crops and water purifiers just to put down stuff I got from the season. I‚Äôm not gonna be able to put down any stuff from this next season.)
---
My feelings are true
---
sell*
---
I know i will.
---
Ok .. Ghouldigga  :)
---
Would appreciate it if you came and bought my arrow stock üòÅ
---
Took me a while too. Until i knew nukacrypt.com keycard. Sneak build and launching ok morgantown. Got al least 300 of every flux
---
I dont think I have ever paid attention to what they scrap down to, if I've even scrapped one. Hit the hotel and fire dept gyms and also start area of silos for lead
---
"LeT ME iNnNnnnNNNN!N!n!"
---
It's a bug that occasionally happens. If you happen to die at the right time when an event you're in is ending you can't respawn and are stuck. Happened once or twice to me. Just have to close F76 and reopen/relog.
---
I've been to one where they had a small room with four vending machines (inside was normal stuff at normal price) and potted plants everywhere and I thought it was fine, until the camp owner came back and repaired it and had traps everywhere inside the small room. I left my body there until he left the server.
---
Mine did this the whole time. I even moved him to a different location and he never moved.
---
Compound bows are in the wastelanders questline, you can get normal bow plans by doing the quick "tutorial quest" at the wayward.
---
Mutation serums
---
Pretty sure that since ghouls have a dry and roasted skin her p word will be drier than ben shapiro's wife
---
Did not know that   , thanks for the info
---
The choice is right.It's a system that could pay more later on. Now it's up to us,when it drops,to give good feedback about damage,resistance and balancing.
---
This is gold
---
Yeah i think in gonna test
---
&gt;A game that promotes collecting things from top tier wepons/armor to spare stimpaks and buffs shouldnt have a limit. This goes for the scrip too.
---
Umm... It's an online game. It's going to have limits. Especially a poorly optimised game that wants the stash situation annoying enough to push you into paying a regular fee for a scrap box.
---
Yeah, escape artist doesn't say it but it makes it so your armor doesn't make any noise that would effect stealth.
---
I dunno, I feel like everyone has been saying they are heading straight to the ammo perk, but it's not that critical to farm for lead and steel. To me the ammo one also seems like a waste, but I also know how quickly you can burn through 308. 
---
I use 5mm and melee and always have like 14000 on me so I'm biased.. but I would think any core based weapons should also be fairly straightforward for farming ammo.
---
Why is making more ammo better than, say, 5 more luck? Or agility? Like someone else said, we kind of already have that with the ammo smith perk, just a bit slower.
---
Private server, run multiple times.
---
I know for encrypted if you wait about 7 minutes it lets you respawn as normal.
---
&gt; never used bows in Skyrim
---
Hah, you thought you could escape being a stealth archer. Todd finds a way.
---
Don't think so. Just ooen the wheel or remember under what number you favorite them.
---
You do you boo. Bows are sick.
---
Nice review.
---
What level are you?
---
Unless you're a high volume nuker, the return on investment for being able to unlock or hack everything you see does not pay out.. everything you find in Safe is readily available elsewhere, and XP from terminals can't be that lucrative
---
Since it's now actually on the teachers to buy what they need for their classes, don't you think they would have take their shit home with them?
---
I've got 30+ agility and I've tried running no sneak card, I just can't be as care free as I can with it. If you ran a silent weapon like a bow then you'd probably be fine but with a silenced/melee weapon you probably won't find it working out as great.
---
Lead - hit the gyms for weights you will be way overencumbered until you break them down, but charleston fire station and vault tec u vault simulator both have work benches close by.
---
My coworker says to use the excavator and hit lucky hole mine? I dont do that though. Need a lot of acid to smelt the ore.
---
The only Ghoulette I'd be giving my Gamma Gun to.
---
Well, that sounded better in my head.
---
I hit the silos they have 100 lead in them in the gym area just I side first area
---
I would love to see a increase because you know what? I‚Äôm a freaking hoarder and I keep everything. But with the stash limit from back during launch I dropped or sold so many weapons that I didn‚Äôt know where good being I used to just use the weapon that had the highest damage or which one I had ammo for. I never messed with perk cards much until I started really perfecting my build and finding the best guns. I know that with the limit back then I got rid of legacies because I didn‚Äôt know they would be removed and I didn‚Äôt know how good they would be. But if I would‚Äôve had a higher stash limit back then I would still have them. And the stash limit and daily scrip limit really hold me back still. Because again I‚Äôm a hoarder, that‚Äôs how I always am in fallout games. I about two months ago started the transferring of weapons to alts. I now in a two month time have max characters and they‚Äôre all at max weight. My main character usually has around 500 carrying weight on them and also full 800 stash. I really would enjoy a higher stash limit more then anything.
---
You are a lil bit wrong here. In a team you just need to go hidden if you wanna get your sneak dmg back. You only lose it if 2 enemies are fighting eachothers or if you are on causious status. But i'm not 100% sure if you completly lose it when a random player outside your team is fighting your target tho.if this is what you mean, it could be very possible.
---
But if you need more precision about how sneak dmg works you still can take a look to this video: https://youtu.be/8OONwLXf2p8 This youtuber (Fisty McRib) made a pretty good one but...i think he forgot to actually test the sneak with random players playing around. I'm not sure I may have to take back a look too lol.

I do use the wheel but it usually makes my game freeze up if I open it during Colossus or Queen fight.
---
Rip servers. In some servers it takes almost 2 seconds after picking up to really picking up because of lagg. If i start a private server everything is instant. I do think they should like double or triple camp budget because we can build insane big in workshops. (Would be heaven if i could save a private server like a savegame so its more rewarding to make great fortresses that gather supplies/materials.
---
They use laptops now boomer.
---
The lack of a price and/or statement of willingness to sell is what makes it bragging post and not a bartering post.
---
I have a quad explosive double barrel, and when I feel like being loud, it is a blast. I just started a bloodied shotgun build, so i also like having a suppressor, but occasionally I pull out the qe db and wreck. I'll have to look for a -15 damage while blocking armor piece, and see how much more damage I can cause. Thanks for the read.
---
No caps or scrip or bullion all get maxed out
---
I think you might be right about it needing to be someone outside your group, but you definitely do lost your damage when it is that case.
---
Just take mods off. Least defence and make it ultra-Light. A lot of them won't even weigh 1 lbs
---
For a while it will be everywhere
---
Yes. Do all the Vault Raid prep quests for both sides before choosing a side. 
---
Use [this resource](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations) for more guidance.
---
I want to romance the radio DJ. she sounds pretty goddamn wholesome.
---
Ping? Or a lot of players with full stashes etc?
---
It‚Äôs not a bad idea on the fight itself. The Queen spawns a pile of adds. I switch back to FFR when it‚Äôs just her, though.
---
You mean "The Brotherhood of Steal"?
---
We got the paper targets a little bit ago,  ive got one of my toons down in the bog with a military base style trench camp with a shooing range
---
I think I'd have a lot of success with a QE but the one I have is a Q 50vc 90rw and even though I'm using it at need rage threshold I can't kill a lot before I meet my demise. 
---
It shouldn't be too hard to find but keep in mind that you'll only do heaps more damage in vats. You'll know you're pulling dodgy numbers when each number you see from the pellets is different. 
---
If you look up angryturtles most recent video on magic damage he will explain it better, but you can also pull magic damage with fast firing weapons such as the LMG. Magic damage has been around for a while and it seems very difficult to patch so you should be able to enjoy it for a while
---
such is your penance for using an AMD card.
---
I bet you would! Considering how heavy a lot of arrows can be. But sorry I am good for arrows right now but thank you for the offer. :)
---
I totally agree with that so I think it should be a only u the player that owns that camp can change only ur own spawn point and to talk about griefers and stuff I'd say first if u have the one mode set so u cant damge others traps at camps shouldn't affect u either, another thing which I dont think would change much but with still he nice is have a few seconds of invincibility when u spawn in or get revived and lastly wat it was a prefab that u had to place that acted as a players spawn at camp?
---
I got an explosive furious something else gatling gun once, imo its a god roll and its still one of my go toos for sbqs
---
Lol you are right he got me good.
---
While it may be true that in our world wooden pencils only used graphite *(but could have lead in the yellow paint until around the mid-70s)*, in the Fallout universe, [this was quite different](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pencil_(Fallout_76)).
---
I actually have a lead (metal) HB special soft pencil that I bought specifically because it was an actual lead (metal) pencil.  Has a plastic coating and can even be sharpened in a normal pencil sharpener.
---
Mind you I bought it 30 years ago so no telling if they still exist.
---
Deep in a cave or building. 
---
Calm down sweaty.
---
Yeah but we are probably missing something. I'm supprised youtubers haven't tested those cards properly yet to really clarify how they work, how they are applied. My guess is that they should start to pop about next week. It is a really hot topic, they must be working on it right now.
---
Yeah Gatling guns are great and very economical in terms of bullet consumption for damage output.
---
I don't think collectrons actually have to move around to collect stuff. You may well find that as he just stands there stuff simply starts appearing in the collection box.
---
I mean I dont completely believe that bc that can add it and make it so only the person that owns that camp spawns there and with my base its narrow so no matter were I place it I will spawn either in the mountain of off of it
---
Mine was moving but he didn‚Äôt collect anything different.
---
It should have a unique look by default. Like the fancy shotgun
---
Ye i know they don't need to move but I like the immersion I guess? Lol idk what to call it but I like my camp to feel populated.
---
if you're a full health build it wont effect you too much, but for builds like bloodied and junkies, its going to decrease our damage significantly, its going to change how damage is calculated, ending up much less than it normal, mainly when you have lots of things adding to your total damage, decreasing the bonuses from those buffs. in the pts it seems to be about half of normal damage for a bloodied commando build
---
Yea I kinda forgot about the whole spawn thing but still something that only the owner of that camp could spawn to would be nice
---
Is it? It‚Äôs up on the website right now as an official reward
---
Magic makes shotties how they should be!
---
A pump action shotgun to the face should obliterate not tickle!
---
I agree truthfully they should just take getting damaged from other peoples camps and get ride of that
---
It's almost guaranteed that they found a glitch with them before release. Most likely other players could steal them from the display somehow, hell maybe even NPCs could borrow them when attacked like in Fallout 4.
---
They will likely come someday, hopefully one for free and then hundreds of additional paid versions.
---
Some of the rewards are okay but ‚Äúarmor ace‚Äù looks too much like a deck of cards for my tastes
---
[they literally made one and never released it!! :( ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Presidential_Gauss_rifle) id even be happy with the cladestine skin all the other gauss weapons have though or like some people on another thread make a fallout 3 gauss rifle skin
---
I just want the bow to be on the right hand for once üòÖit can feel real janky and be awkward looking sometimes
---
Enclave is much darker than Secret Service. I can imagine them with BoS. And Modus with ehm the institute;)
---
I ended up resetting my game because I didn't want to wait that long after encryptid but it gave me the event rewards and I got a fixer plan, must say I'm glad I waited a little bit before doing it
---
Wish it did. That was one of the first things I tried, and it didn‚Äôt work.
---
Nice build! But why don‚Äôt you use dodge to reduce damage received?
---
Picked one up from a seller for 100 caps along with a 3 star bow too, best 200 caps I ever spent as the crossbow itself is a good dps weapon... just sumo is expensive shooting up to 50 bolts every vats session üòì
---
I'm going to give them the old fashioned enclave welcome
---
Actually, Ace is still available. No discount, but if you‚Äôre desperate to be rid of the BoS robot...
---
And do medic pump and born survivor work together?
---
Legendary modules? 
---
They weigh a hell of a lot though
---
use this for all your junk needs [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
And this is why you quintuple line your surgical masks.
---
No don‚Äôt ever close it wait ten minutes and you can then respawn and not lose Loot. I first figured this out during an encrypted event and it‚Äôs worked every since. Don‚Äôt listen to ppl when they say just close game down
---
This is my assumption, anyway. I have no proof.
---
I know, when I first started playing fo76 I was always overencumbered because og ammo Wright.
---
I have 5 characters as well, and I only get the Fast Travel bug on my strictly Bloodied one. 
---
I also noticed, on my bloody character, that I had twice as many Fast Travel attempts if I was still under the effect of any food, drink, or Radaway healing effects.
---
Looks like 1000 bow users chimed in lol. 
---
I just want to do so myself - it would be sick.
---
Will do next time
---
Toss a quiver to your Witcher o valley of plenty
---
Fun fact - that was supposed to be an entirely new weapon. Based on what was in the presidential office, though, I heavily suspect that wastelanders replaces it.
---
But perhaps I‚Äôm wrong.
---
First time i saw this I thought look at this guy. I wonder what chems he's got? So I squatted down and cheered the chicken on. I wish the chicken would get him. Then I can pick his corpse of those fine chems he's using.
---
He just have a better gaming chair, move along citizen
---
There was an Secret Service trainstation....... but S.S and trains somehow had a bad rep.
---
A quite anoying feature, i'm not gonna lie...
---
Not just wholesome, she sounds cute too. Her laughter gets me every time 
---
Do we know if her radio character have an actual model in the game or if it‚Äôs just her voice?
---
You mean to dip his dick in rad-x
---
Was it just an auto laser...
---
In the of SBQ and standard SB‚Äôs Hunters also count. 
---
Obviously, at Scorched Earth Zealots is better as everything will be Scorched outside random Ghoul mobs.
---
When it comes to the Fixer, I remember one of the community manager (sorry if i don‚Äôt know who) saying combat rifle and Fixer will share a skin pool meaning that combat rifle skins will soon be able to have fixer skins
---
If you need food and have it, the Fasnacht one is good too, it's a source of non perishable food and booze, also helps with the "eat pre war foods" challenges
---
Agreed on all the mods. You should make a post about that specifically
---
Imagine how the vendorbots feel. They pay even more tax. Thats why they have to ask high prices.
---
I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I died, respawned in the nuke zone, and got the ‚Äúpick up your dropped loot‚Äù quest but I didn‚Äôt know how to get back in and gave up on the loot bag.
---
Sorry meant like a free weapon or armour roll
---
Officer, I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs trying to infiltrate, his name itself is Captain Communism
---
üëã Hey! I‚Äôm working through the campaign and would appreciate any and alll help :) MatthewMidnight
---
It fixes itself after a couple seconds in server. When I log in it will be like that but wait a little and it will be in the real area
---
no it was clearly modified, bottomless clip, held in 1 hand, short, looked like a solid red beam firing out of it, still watching him rn
---
They are added into files with patch 22. Doesn‚Äôt mean they appear on launch week, just hopefully before patch 23.
---
Ah fair fair
---
Added you ü§üüèª
---
I fast traveled to a event and becket traveled with me.
---
The purpose of this is to help curb inflation. Caps are generated out of thin air constantly, there need to be mechanisms in game to remove them for them to have any sort of value.
---
Woah that was quick. Thank you!! I‚Äôll be back on in around 45 mins or so if you are about I will try to find you when you are on. :)
---
- Stashing my junk before going out to adventure. 
---
- Maintaining about 100 lbs of free space in my personal inventory. 
---
- Already having 10-20k+ of the more common scrap items and only picking up what I still have tagged, like Screws or Ballistic Fiber, of which I only have between 1000-2000 per alt, or what I commonly use like Lead. 
---
- Knowing the location of crafting stations to break down larger items.
---
- Possessing the discipline to drop the worthless junk like shotguns, or not pick them up in the first place. 
---
- The ability to swap out one of my Heavy Gunner or Shotgunner perks for Pack Rat 3 (and reducing the junk weight by 75%), if the time comes. 
---
- Party Boy and a bottle of Whiskey for +6 Strength, and Bufftats for another +3, for 45 lbs more carry weight when it‚Äôs time to Fast Travel.
---
I‚Äôve yet to find a location in the game that would have sufficient junk that I actually wanted that would end up weighing 580 pounds.
---
Add in the fact that I usually keep my Stash Box near 800 because I‚Äôm selling a lot of stuff in my vending machines, and that Scrap Kits only send as much to your Stash Box as it can hold, and the remainder stays in your inventory, and this should explain to you why Scrap Kits are less beneficial to FO1st Players and to me *personally*. 
---
I invite you to read my original post again; my proposed change is to let the ***PLAYER*** have some form of currency to choose which season rewards suit them best *PERSONALLY*.
---
Scrap Kits do not suit me, personally. If they suit you, that‚Äôs fine. I never said you can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt use them.  I advocated for player choice. And I have presented multiple reasons why they might be *less useful* for FO1st players. My previous reply to you wasn‚Äôt meant to be confrontational, simply informative. It‚Äôs odd that you took it that way... *sweaty*. 
---
Have a good day.
---
I think you're able to submit a ticket from the help section of Bethesda's website. Make sure you record some video for evidence if they need it.
---
No worries mate! I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm on by that time. Just come to me whenever
---
Isn‚Äôt one wasteland active on the PTS? I haven‚Äôt heard anyone complain about the things you‚Äôve speculated about so far.
---
Ah ok. I use that one for sure.
---
Not to mention *ballistic fiber*.
---
Who‚Äôs meth was cheaper?
---
Why though? It represents current economy very well
---
better yet 2 x side by side and call it a Scrote Tote
---
Games loose good chunks of playerbase over nerf to one item... and we are talking about nerf to everything with buff to mobs. Its not "will we loose good chunk of playerbase" its how big the chunk will be"
---
At some point, you may get a 4th number in the display.  Icon looks like a teardrop.  It‚Äôs poison resistance.
---
The amount of effort that went into making that event, there is no way it would be only a limited time.
---
Oh yea, good idea. I'd love to have that!
---
Hey. You visit the plan mule, trade, look at their inventory - then take a screenshot of all the plans you are missing. Then you have neat list of what you still need
---
Why what? Why try and curb inflation?
---
Can I pat you for some of that good luck? No but seriously, that's awesome! I play with a bloodied sneaky commando build and I can't recc it enough.
---
This man needs to be instantly banned lmfao
---
I ready to throw down this the brotherhood. 
---
For the enclave
---
Yeah, there is already a caps sink in form of very low caps return from vendors when you buy from them and up to 6k per week from buying gold bullions, vending machines that "eat" "caps" as a tax is very odd thing
---
In fallout universe they are made of lead. Just like the alphabet blocks have lead paint on them and break down to produce lead.
---
More skins!  Blackbird paint for T65.  Matte black for 50cal.  
---
And
---
Plan for Dense mod for PA
---
What the actual fuck.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs one common complaint most people have the bows. That and the inconsistent vats hits anyways lol.
---
Are you ok?
---
That's how I'm playing it, but my issue (other than dying due to lack of situational awareness) is managing radiation levels.
---
The spot light will actually make turrets detect enemies easier and from further away..
---
Yeah it is. As much as I like both the bow seems to better all round. More damage and much cheaper to craft ammo for. Although the crossbow is accurate in vats and has less drop off when long distance sniping.
---
Dafuq did I just read?!
---
I think he's rethinking *your* life decisions.
---
Fair enough!
---
Soon we‚Äôll be saying this about the level 169 after they implement the enemy scaling mechanism.
---
That's how it starts lol. 
---
Start tracking down unyeilding pieces.  You'll survive a lot longer at low health once you have the additional 15 agility to make you sneaky.  Can't hit you if they can't see you.
---
Get perks like dodgy and serendipity to avoid damage coming at you.  Otherwise the health and rad part is pretty self explanatory.  Lots of radiation, little bit of health.
---
I got it last night so it‚Äôs all good
---
I hope he doesn‚Äôt know where I sleep at night
---
you get nothing the S.C.O.R.E counter says MAX and thats all
---
I‚Äôve done it with 100+ players before and some still have no clue.
---
Awesome!
---
Yeah lol. As I‚Äôve said in one of the edits and other comments there are much more archers in 76 than I assumed. I jokingly said ‚Äúme and the 10 others‚Äù due to my experience in rarely coming across other bow users in-game.
---
Glowing blood from the ghouls at rad rumble or a gamma gun shot at your feet are good ways to maintain rads.
---
Yes, I am down for fire works, I would like to see bigger fireworks üéÜ displayed when firing them off, because I like to see things go boom üí• 
---
And yes bigger rewards for milestones please.
---
My question is how do you adjust your radiation level in a fight? If you're taking too many rads, but don't want to lose the nerd rage buff. Even diluted radaway is taking too much radiation away and I also need a safe way to take radiation in a fight quickly without ODing.
---
If you are going to &lt;20% HP, do NOT use auto-stims or anything of that alot.
---
Those perks/legendary cannot tell that your HP is capped and will keep using stims.
---
Since you are on PC, you may want to install the mod that adds marks on your HP bar to tell you 20% 40% 60% 80%.
---
Toxic Goo is an easy way to add rads, you can get it easily from West Tek, the decontamination shower pool near the entrance has it. I use boiled water to do smaller increments.
---
The thing that kills me the most as a bloodied build is poison and the crop dusting from scorchbeasts, that crop dusting seems to have been doing more damage lately, but maybe it's just me not paying attention.
---
Pretty much same...that gold bullion grind killed me.
---
But i came back 2 weeks ago and i wish i got back sooner. The season pass rewards are quite fun to grind and players are everywhere grinding events and xp. It feels more alive.
---
And next season, septembrer 15th, "One Wasteland" drops and will scale enemies to our lvls giving us the oppotunity to benifit from every activities in the game, no mater where it is. It will make the game a lil less repititive and more challenging.
---
It's a really good time to comeback !
---
What‚Äôs odd about it? It‚Äôs the same idea as having a fast travel cost. You get caps constantly from events, quests, etc. There need to be multiple ways to remove them. Passing items between players at scale without removing caps from the economy leads to an oversupply of caps.
---
jeez dude. Share some of that hash
---
‚ÄòPuzzle‚Äô camps never have any good shit, it‚Äôs for the owner‚Äôs entertainment. If it does have cheap junks, owner is waiting behind you with punji boards. Explosive bait is the best approach for camps like this.
---
Its the barrels that are automatic, and you gotta keep scrapping them until you learn the plan. Laser pistols and rifles are the same item with different barrels, so scrap both.
---
No that's 'world music' a little harder to check if the jukebox works in 'a violent night' if that is turned off.
---
20? That's longer then me
---
I had him for 2 minutes then reinstated my communist collectron
---
Reddits finnest right here....

Depends.  If you are mutated, then it‚Äôs not a bad idea to have starched genes2 and classfreak2.

Yes, more fireworks or Craftable fireworks plan would be a great Idea aswell. üëçüß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®üß®‚ú®üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•ü§≠

Tap the fire button really fast???
---
I'm a little confused, though i admit that the quest markers are pretty confusing for this quest.
---
Which part of the quest are you stuck at?
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Trade\_Secrets](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Secrets)

Bruh mutants have no dongs.
---
I am NOT going to feel bad for a robot!

sory guys Im high and kind a horny i will delete the post
---
Yesterday I was visiting a camps since I was max caps. Entering this one in the only available door and I instantly died. Just had Colossal Problem before so that "player" just enjoyed more than 300 screws and a lot of nuclear waste... I return there and confirmed that I could only see a small round rug right after the door.
---
Just you wait for the Fisto collectron
---
How do you know bitch
---
IMO yes, full health builds are better off choosing a variety of "take 15% less damage from X enemy type" to get the flat reduction on *most* enemies in the game.
---
I have a rad emitter locked in with my generator for when I need a quick pick-me-up!
---
Mine just collects 1 pound. (At least that what is says in the tray.) It only finds scrap. I have not other ones so theres no terminal options. He is moving aroung though.
---
There‚Äôs a rep glitch? Dm it me please üòÇ
---
TIL
---
Lol this is terrifying üòÜ
---
Unless you help them, in which then they can be recruited to the dam, which I would consider helpful at least. They're supposed to be a cut off isolated group with limited resources, recent casualties and deep in enemy (ncr) controlled territory. Dems pretty reasonable to me to be wary of anyone.
---
Can and should. Just keep doing their dailies after the story quests.
---
Letting you body there was a clever move.
---
I‚Äôm lost for words üòÇ upvoting for making me laugh
---
Perhaps, but I doubt most had a heads up on when the nukes were dropping and from Fallout 4's intro, chances are it occurred during school time.
---
I mean if you check out other schools in Fallout games of the past, and elsewhere in worlds, people were still going about their normal routines.
---
I mean why take home all your pens and pencils and go home but still have the cafeteria prepped for meals with plates and such on all the tables?
---
Halloween event idea:
---
You can place a candy bowl in your camp, for just some wood. You can go and pick candy from it at other people's camp. For every unique camp you got candy from, you get one special candy. That candy can then be used in a special weapon/armour/cosmetic/build recipe 
---
It gives people a good reason to go around trick or treating.
---
Been wearing mine since I got that job at Dyer Chemical
---
The wheel (at least by default) maps to your number and - and = keys.  If you use those instead of opening the wheel...you don't have to open the wheel.
---
Dummy robo thic. I don't know why they had to give a robot curves, but I am glad they did.
---
I love that little skeleton launch too. It's part of why I deliberately drugged new players with nukashine at my camp near the vault.
---
I got a single shot crit  sneak build with 5x secret service unyielding. Chameleon. Harder to detect. Sleak/ultralight. And do with adrenaline around 6500DMG. Agility is around 41. Per 28. Rest i forgot. But i have some perks for support. This is my second char and at ACP i mostly am the ONLY one that don't die. Revive everyone and 1 or 2 shot the spawns and use the criticals on Earl (450 Dmg) per shot.
---
I get the fast travel bug on my non-bloodied lvl 25 character. No serums, no unyielding üòë
---
Would be nice if the season 2 "game" rewards were playable.    Get a big foos ball tourney - with leader boards and the ability to "bet" caps/ weapon/ armor...
---
OP is fine he just can‚Äôt find his fleshlight
---
I find it useful for my punch bowl. Typically I buy it from vendors.   
---
I don't think it should be an award though cuz that defeats the purpose of the questline
---
What we doing?
---
Don't believe they patched it.
---
Question, where do you buy the faction specific bullion plans?
---
What's merch? I know what merchandise is but not merch. Maybe because I use whole words like an adult and not some child raised on the internet.
---
I agree with this sentiment lol
---
Theoretically you can wire the counter poles in series and have a "you are the xxx customer type display but I've never seen it done. Not sure if broken, too expensive budget-wise, or what. Might be a fun experiment to try.
---
Luckily haven't had this happen yet (I think?), but they can just make anywhere that's not the boss fight room have a timer that counts down from 1-2 minutes and when it hits 0 it teleports you out of the event. I don't advocate leeching, but if you gotta afk during the event for irl reasons just sneak in some corner of the actual boss fight room.
---
I want skins for the gatlings. Just I don't sell them by accident. Lol
---
I'm fairly new (level 17) just trying to find a radstag for now lol I wasn't finding any in public lobby's so imma try this, I was just seeing if anyone wanted to be in a private world not to particularly join me if you wanna ya can lol or go on your own endeavours. I'm not sure if it makes much difference than having public lobbys
---
Never be like Mr. Poopypants here...
---
I think it is patched but give it a go.
---
I'm a single shot sneak build and have 3str. 15per. 1end. 3chr. 5int 15agi and 14luck. As a group bloated glowing ones comes its like vats shoot vats shoot etc and in 3 sec you one shot 10 of them
---
I have been to trap camps where the player was waiting to return my loot and just wanted the entertainment of watching people try to figure out how to escape
---
Not the same but something so you know it‚Äôs a fixer hmm I could get down w that
---
Different stocks
---
\*Cue Twilight Zone Music\*
---
Did they say around when this would take place?
---
Why bolstering? It'd be dead weight most of the time. You might be better off with something more functional like chameleon or regenerating?
---
Alternatively why not do away with vanguard altogether &amp; go bolstering. You don't need th Dr when your health is high &amp; you can leverage synergies with unyielding for those 2 extra pieces as well as bonuses damage from Adrenal Reaction.
---
The counter poles were supposed to power up after x amount of turns. Too bad it doesn't work as it should. I will try the counter though thanks.
---
If your on PC let‚Äôs get a bow-ey gang going
---
i would love to hear their reason, because they literally have to do no work if you guys had already had it that far developed, why on earth would they turn you guys down? not even turn down, ignore?? I don't see any reason they couldn't even turn you down, like they could've said no. but being ignored is very unprofessional
---
Skins hell yeah
---
Keep the dense mod out of it lol
---
Why can't we leave our sexual preference outside the game?
---
That's a tricky one and you just have to find a way that works for you.  Some people carry dirty water or toxic goo from West Tek and drink as needed.   I have a reduced weight assualtron head I carry for 50 rad per shot.  Personally if in a nuke zone taking rad damage (basically only SBQ where some dip runs in, doesn't happen often)  I just pop diluted radaway and don't worry about staying in nerd rage territory since I still do decent damage even without it.
---
Otherwise the only other source of rads is usually ghouls which I just try not to let hit me by using sneak and killing them before they can get close.
---
The auto srim stuff is a must have for earl Williams an upcoming hard content, you need to swap it in then out, because you it wastes stims in normal play.
---
I got my eyes on you!
---
I do want to do that. But, the budget makes it not so great. Would you happen to know with the terminal you can set it to track user. I tried it but it doesn't track me at all. Broken maybe?
---
I haven‚Äôt pooped my pants since I was 3!!!
---
Yup.  In this case it was very specifically killing one thing at a time. (Walking through Charleston Capital). And identical (on the surface) level 62 charred
---
I don‚Äôt hunt for them and I find it so easy to find them. I have 25 of them now. I have had it where I spawn in and the super sonic speed one flys and you can get to it. I remember when I was following the main story it took me forever to get one to drop a card. My biggest pain is, if I‚Äôm shooting one that‚Äôs right over top of me I have lost it in forest. Wish they would have markers when you get the cache to drop
---
same here. Im trying to make my CAMP look like a npc/bandit place, a little messy. Its so hard.
---
If I see that happening again I‚Äôll do that.  Thanks.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes yup, if we still don‚Äôt have a skin for the fixer, we‚Äôre lost already.
---
"can we have a completely new system added to the game that serves no purpose other than to add a minigame I'll play literally once and then never bother with again?"
---
2 years in the wasteland and you‚Äôd think you‚Äôve seen all craziness
---
Thanks! It seems like dirty water and toxic goo are the consensus. I was testing out the build by fighting scorchbeasts and that's how I realized radiation management was an issue.
---
The BoS are a bunch of militia aholes, so it's no surprise their collectron would make statements like this too. You will never be good enough for them unless you make some great sacrifice of your own to the BoS, and they will end up getting the better end of the deal out of your service to them, leaving you with nothing other than some honorary title and access to their tech, which you can already freely find about the world anyway. Who needs them!?
---
They're like that generic terrible senate committee in the generic thriller drama movie that thinks they are over everyone and sticks it in your face how wrong you are and how they're going to bring you down unless you change to their views or side and don't get in their way. But there there for the good of all humankind. That's the BoS.
---
We need to stand up to them and start an Appalachia Minutemen, I hear it worked well over in the Commonwealth.
---
True, that would be nice. As it is now though, they should just allow us to use Combat Rifle skins, not sure why they haven't. It doesn't look any different to a combat rifle to me in terms of overall look of the gun, so I can't imagine it being that hard. I for one won't be buying a skin for the Fixer as to me that just looks lazy, especially when it looks exactly the same as the combat rifle in terms of overall look/mods.
---
Use a gamma gun aim at the ground and shoot, you will get 50 rads per shot or you could use toxic goo not sure how much rads you will get though. Use diluted radaway when you are getting too much rads and use the gamma gun to get ur help below 20% to trigger nerd rage if the diluted radaway makes ur health go above 20%.
---
Yea very easy one , seems patched now look it up on YouTube, there was a foundation one too but much more annoying to do.
---
I can always kill a friendly raider while his friend is next to him and still no negative rep. And the deserted raider quest... i let him pay and shoot him anyway after that. (I was hired to send a message)
---
just because an engine can't do literally anything it doesn't mean it's not a "modern day engine"
---
So.  Might wanna warn people.  Don‚Äôt go into Whitesprings afterwards for some shopping.   Everything is Aggro and the turrets can‚Äôt ever be killed.  O-O
---
None of that is really effective (except for buying bullions), in a long term there isn't really anything that will remove caps from circulation effectively
---
Make it a fanny pack
---
Crazy because of the backpack? Or because of me still thinking posting ideas might lead to it being implemented? lol
---
I mean, why not two branches of BOS? One who is appalled by the behaviour of BOS and one who isn't?
---
I'm still trying to decide if I'm going to stay with my bloodied build with the supposed upcoming nerf coming up... Decisions decisions!!
---
Get it from stash. Ward get's 'triggered' and put it back in stash before turning in.
---
Not even a shart? You must be shitting me...
---
Yes, it's limited, You may want to have a friend/family log in for you.

I'm fine with the changes so long as melee doesn't get gutted. If they want to nerf boss dps that's fine, but we should at least be able to 1-2 shot max level adds if we're... you know... in melee range. More risk, more reward. A ranged build utilizing some type of sniper can do the same from a distance, but at what risk for all the reward? There needs to be a balance somewhere between melee and ranged builds. The only argument I can think of is ammo consumption, but ammo is dirt cheap and you get back more from body loot than you use with these sniper builds.
---
Cringe
---
Mine stands there a lot. Occasionally he will walk a short distance away. Im not bothered though. I put his station on the edge of my camp so I dont hear it anyway
---
Not too far off from reality.  Native Americans used buffalo scrums for bags.
---
I have a room with all my resource things and he just stands in the middle of the room
---
If you are looking for radstag go up to the dried up lake bed.. theres a few dead trees and a junk pile there near black bear lodge... plenty of radstag spawn there, also the occasional yao guais and deathclaws
---
Backpack of course, never shy away from sharing your ideas man!
---
Everything's getting nerfed. But yea, I may not stick with bloodied if the benefits no longer outweigh the risks. The amount of damage I'm doing is roughly double that of my full health build. However, I have to be a lot more cautious. My days of boldly running into enemy camps may be over.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/FN_FAL_(Fallout_2)
---
yeah. survival weapons are coming back
---
You can‚Äôt mod anything in nuclear winter  also laser pistols are held with one hand and can still fire automatic
---
Agreed, and a red dress does not count as ‚Äúarnmor‚Äù btw
---
Raider Punk gave me a mission to kill a dangerous beast that was nearby. It was a Sheepsquatch. It was living IN a Blood Eagle camp. 
---
In the camp were TWO 3\* Legendary Blood Eagles, plus the 1\* Sheepsquatch. Those Legendary Blood Eagles were pretty tough to put down. The Sheepsquatch however took a lot more bullets. It was so cool to get the 1\* Tire Iron, the 1\* Wood Armor and the 1\* Rolling Pin...
---
It's already in the game as a Nuclear Winter reward.
---
Over 1k hours in as a bloodied but want to do a tankie junkies melee, What armor would u say i should Go for ?
---
They aren't evil, they just have their agenda and their view on how to rebuild the world. Just like those at Foundation do, and even the rag tag Raiders. Their view is more militaristic though in structure and as such, there's a lot more things they are against if it doesn't meet their point of view. It doesn't make them evil, just different.
---
I just "went off" on the BoS in another post (in lore/jest) in how they always think they are better than everyone else and how we should form the Appalachia Minutemen.
---
They really should add a Legendary count, but as a protip (which someone will invariably turn into a PSA): You can often browse the Public Teams and find the player who owns the CAMP, and their level is displayed next to their name.
---
Thanks man, much appreciated
---
They want you to waste the caps so don‚Äôt expect it to change much
---
Since Dorsey had a hand in its creation it probably expects someone else to do the fetching of supplies for it.
---
Lmao. Probably. He takes them off of you and then gives you half back.
---
Bloodied is still generally better than any other build post-nerf.  It's just, not far-and-away better like it was.
---
That's a good thing though. It lets the rest of us keep our smugness intact :D
---
Hot take: like Laser guns and Ultracite Laser guns, add the Enclave Plasma rifle to the damn loot pool and make mods for it available.
---
Yeah I do that.  But I swear on XBox I always end up on servers where all the high levels in public teams don‚Äôt have camps (or vendors disabled/scrapped).  
---
Bonus return pro tip.  Just keep switching public teams to fast travel to all their camps for free.
---
Seems like you‚Äôre excluding people based on their sexuality.
---
Yeah. But you can just keep joining public teams to travel to all those camps for free.  
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not sure why the cap travel cost is even still there.   At end-game it doesn‚Äôt matter.  And between toggling teams to travel. Using FO1 tents.  And the various free travel spots (more soon).  AND public events.  You can usually get the travel cost free to completely cheap.  
---
So it really only punishes new players who are broke and can‚Äôt afford it.
---
Shoot at your feet with the Gamma Gun.  It's a lot easier than having to go to West Tek and gather Toxic Goo.
---
In a fight, don't be too obsessive about maintaining Nerd Rage and &lt; 20% HP.  It's ideal, of course, but if you're getting hit, you're getting hit, and it will work its way back down naturally if that's the case.
---
The jet pack is a waste.  Just get the dense torso.
---
Cans give lead, so those can chimes are great source. 
---
If you‚Äôre end game build and ready to take on ACP, kill wendigos and collect their teeth (2 acid). You‚Äôll need 1 acid and 2 ores to smelt 5 scrap (1 acid 2 iron ores = 5 steel scrap). 
---
Lucky hole mine with excavator gives you 250+ lead ores, you‚Äôll need 125+ acid. You‚Äôll get around 700++ lead scrap, super duper perk works with smelting.
---
No reason really to get rid of it.
---
you have to be nice to her...and she does. 3 times for me so far.
---
My dream is that, along with the brotherhood selling plans for bullion to make legendary laser weapons, MODUS starts selling plans for bullion to make legendary enclave plasma weapons. But it's really unlikely.
---
(No, I don't know why MODUS would need gold.)
---
I run at 30+ agi and run no sneak perk or armour. Can give super mutants a reach around and they have no idea in there
---
It's Legs...
---
I wouldn't be surprised if other games had similar issues to the Wi Flag, I know I usually do decent damage and all but even if I stop dealing damage for a while it still occurs. Between the spawn in Earle's fight, the scorched that drop under the queen, and basically every enemy I crossed in destiny 1 and 2 seemed to beeline for me, past my group of teammates. I know this also might seem as superstitious as the Wi Flag did originally, but my girl friend could attest for this as she played both games with me.
---
Gotta get that rad barrel from rad rumble
---
im sat on 10 keycards because i can get them so effortlessly.
---
im sat on 8 vintage nukashines because its so easy to come by.
---
i have so many stimpacks and rad-away i practically piss health.
---
these "rewards" are designed to waste a slot without "looking" like it wastes a slot by giving you *something wanna know what other type of games do this?*
---
ones with P2W aspects diluting their loot boxes with common loot like crown potions, crown poisons, crown food, crown soulgems... wait your telling me they'v already does this in ESO?
---
oh yeah because the community ignored me and afew other people outcry of this becoming normal if we dont stop it NOW.
---
several years later people just let "junk loot" happen now.
---
is this what fallout seasons need?
---
No reason to keep it either :)
---
I absolutely love this home.
---
only open 4, as handy as you think 6 is, the exp only goes up to x4, anything more is a waste
---
Says you. You must be a pvper
---
Not happening. 500 hours and it's never dropped for me once. Also never seen it for sale either.
---
No, you are either with the cool kids or the nerds.
---
It's some sort of a bug.  
---
They're looking into it.  
---
You can file a ticket if you like, but they haven't said much beyond that.
---
Yeah I would wonder, if Bethesda would let me progress past an ounce of prevention.
---
You‚Äôll stay in 20% health for sho. No battle I know will make you take constant long lasting rads if you play sneak commando, unless you count queen killing in the nuke zone. 
---
Definitely keep toxic goo on you since if you die you respawn with &gt;20% health. Other than that it‚Äôs not really hard. I keep some diluted rad-away for emergencies, the Chinese stealth suit for nuke zone, toxic goo for rads.
---
It‚Äôs their nuke, they can drop it wherever they want as long as it isn‚Äôt on top of my base lmao. If people get mad over that they might just be having a bad day, there‚Äôs two other silos for a reason ya know?
---
‚ÄúIdk. Just a suggestion.‚Äù
---
No this isn‚Äôt just a suggestion. It‚Äôs a great idea!
---
Less work to leave it
---
TL;DR
---
you're wrong
---
No reason to keep it either.
---
I wouldnt really care. It was probably me who dropped it.
---
I like to occasionally drop nukes in random places because I want to see what spawns and how many people will actually show up.
---
This job is definitely a downgrade from killing people for Rose.
---
God she's HOT
---
Shit scratch thath u whant the p90 and the h&amp;k g11
---
Same.  I never use PA either. Or energy weapons.  
---
I unload all my fusion and plasma cores (plasma cores are way heavy too) in front of players at the SBQ and Colossal Problem events, both of which draw a lot of PA users.
---
So are you. Know why people play mini games? Cause they are fun to do over and over.
---
To be fair: I think it‚Äôs important to note that the Collectron is likely imitating TAGGERDY‚ÄôS Brotherhood, which we know was rather hostile and forceful toward civilians, rather than Rahmani‚Äôs. We haven‚Äôt formally met Rahmani‚Äôs detachment, so it‚Äôs entirely possible they have a completely different attitude towards the people of the Wasteland.
---
What issues does the tax create?
---
It‚Äôs their nuke. They can do what they want with it.
---
What an amazing observation. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I have no LGBT+ friends and I‚Äôd enjoy connecting with those people on a game I‚Äôm recently getting invested in? Idk, just a thought. I can‚Äôt be bothered to argue beyond that on a Reddit post. Wouldn‚Äôt really care if I was excluded. Don‚Äôt think you should let it get to you either bud. It‚Äôs a free world though, so you do you I guess.
---
how about prepare for the future
---
I kinda miss the days where I could log on and count on whitesprings being bombed almost around the clock heh.
---
I do this sometimes when I'm bored and have an excess of nuke cards. I just drop nukes in random places, like the Ash Heap for example as I've legitimately never seen the Ash Heap get nuked any other time.
---
If nothing else, random nuke locations can be useful for farming flux.
---
I still rush to whitespring when a nuke is dropped there.  Reminds me of the old days.
---
As a developer.  Sometimes it‚Äôs less work (overall) to remove something.  Because it‚Äôs one less thing to deal with in future.  One less thing to cause a bug.  Etc.  Like right now they are adding two free locations.  And have lots of ‚Äòif on team, if base, if X‚Äô code.  Where all that could be removed making a cleaner/easier to maintain codebase.
---
I hate going to a camp because they have something juicy like ‚Äò13 weapons‚Äô only to get there and the low level just has level 5 weapons for sale for like 500 caps each lol
---
Thanks 12 y/o
---
There's a few spawn spots that they go past by top of the world that its super easy to shoot it down by specifically the tiny lake west of top of the world the one with the 3 cows in it dunno a schedule for it but i used to have a base there for farming keycards a similar lake is the one on the whitesprings gold course the one south from the resort with the 3 to 5 mirelurks in it
---
I have a level 6 mule alt with 2 machines.  One filled with good legendary armor and one filled with good legendary weapons.  Not God rolls but not trash either, all max level and all super cheap for what they are.  Still, there are plenty of actual low levels selling crap too but just avoiding vendors because of the characters level might make you miss out on something you actually want.
---
Also there is literally a perk for it so it would make it useless
---
Sentinel is not a legit in game item. It has been taken from dev room and duped.
---
I'm always happy when I see someone else launching a nuke. 90% of the time it's either a friend or myself doing it. It's also nice to see people nuking different spots.
---
Legnedaries (how many of each star count), armor/clothes, known plans...
---
I'd get mad. How dare they not consult me first! The nerve of people running a silo themselves and thinking that gives them the right to use their nuclear keycard to launch their nuke wherever *they* want! It's disgraceful.
---
Theres no Sentinel paint. Elder is the highest
---
I lock it because it's my extractor.. other than that, I 100% agree with you lol, I dont even loot my extractor and collectron anymore... maybe I should open them..
---
Except this engine they use is buggy and over 15 years old.
---
So the question seems to be, why you'd need a game to get friends that have a different orientation than you...
---
Just like reddit is not the place to discuss this, Fo76 is not the place to do it.
---
Time to look for one of those on Ebay.
---
I have an unarmed/bows build. I LOVE that character. I gotta level her up more because I'm having a lot of fun with bows. I definitely agree with this!
---
There are many of us that use lower level alts as merchant mules.  My level 10 carries a very nice selection of high-level gear, all suitable for the discriminating buyer. I've got a weapon for every situation. Hunting, protection, cold blooded murder, HOT blooded murder.
---
No worries. Have a good day, and goodbye.
---
Known plans would be awesome.  But as a developer that would suuuck.  Since you‚Äôd have to actively check that as people are scrolling over the vendors. :)
---
I have reached the elders, but I do not. I finally understood the reason
---
I have been trying since April to get it to drop for me. Someday!
---
just because an engine was created using an older engine as a foundation, it doesn't mean the engine is 15 years old.
---
I only find it annoying when people lock their purifiers and their CAMPS doors. Purified water is created fast enough to not even notice if someone comes and needs to take some for their travels. And I don‚Äôt understand why people lock their doors, I love people coming into my camp and looking around my house!
---
Yup. But they could refund that card.  Or change it to do something else.  Like how assassin weapons are changing to be ‚Äòagainst humans‚Äô.  
---
Again. Probably won‚Äôt ever do anything about it.  But it would be a great thing if they did IMO.
---
Next to the Paladin was the Elder, It's the last
---
If a player was nice enough to sell me one that didn't bankrupt me I wouldn't call them dubious.
---
True. But IMO that‚Äôs a much lower risk than the time waste of going through 10 level 5 camps with junk.  
---
Perhaps better option would be to show the max level of equipment in the vendor?
---
Even then tho I‚Äôd expect lots of level 35‚Äôs to end up with a single level 50 pipe pistol to make their camp look higher level.  
---
*shrug*
---
The only extractor I have is a steel extractor, which I never lock. And nobody ever seems to loot it, I assume because steel is not exactly a rare commodity.
---
Me too luckily I had somebody place 2 down in my camp so it‚Äôs not too big of a deal
---
I put together a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7IwVO6UEHs1RjT-QQFc5stAIrUtlHM36LRK8ZLWTPg/edit#gid=0) a while ago to see if you really do get diminishing returns past a certain point, and it turns out the survivability you get from armor rating is pretty linear, especially for high damage attacks. That means 60 extra armor rating will make you live as much longer at 100 armor rating as it will at 400.
---
The equation that turns armor rating into damage reduction (damage reduction is the actual percent of damage ignored) has diminishing returns in Fallout 4 and 76, but damage reduction itself has increasing returns, so it balances out and becomes more or less linear.
---
Whether it's better to mix vanguard and bolstering is a tougher question. All of my characters are high health tanks, and I tend to be pretty on top of using stimpacks, so I spend a lot more time at high health than I do at low health. There's an armor set in ESO that works like bolstering and no one uses it because if you're in a group with a healer, they're going to keep topping off your health.
---
I'm 378 I think last time I checked. But that frees up 6 perk cards slots. I'm only taking the first rank I'm not trying to dump all my coins into that.
---
My level 10 is my vendor alt, set up outside a train station.  He sells max level bloodied, junkies, unyielding, etc.  All the stuff I don‚Äôt scrip.  As the saying goes ‚Äúnever judge a book by it‚Äôs cover‚Äù.  I‚Äôve gone to level 200+ camps and they‚Äôre trying to sell Hunters Wooden Leg for 4000 caps.  I‚Äôve even created a public group for my vendor so people could just fast travel to me while I‚Äôm sitting at my vendor AFK.  
---
Don‚Äôt assume high levels have good gear, don‚Äôt assume low levels don‚Äôt.
---
I feel it should be based on ur current carry weight since more low lvl will have less and higher lvls usually carry close to max
---
Or even better, let us romance Eugenie. Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of Penelope but Eugenie has an even better personality.
---
Hope you're looking forward to doing it all over again for BOS :)
---
True. But 99% of the time when I‚Äôm vendor hopping.  The level 200+ folks have reasonable stuff and the level 5 folks have pipe pistols and mentats.  
---
You are correct it‚Äôs not 100% of the time.  But it would be nice to know going in. So I have the choice of deciding if it‚Äôs worth the 15 minutes for me to travel to 5 low level camps which likely all have low level stuff.  Versus server hopping and hitting a dozen more high level ones.
---
Don‚Äôt know anything about the PTS since I‚Äôm a console player but I‚Äôve heard plenty of people complain about the same things I did in this comment.
---
Wow thanks
---
Possibly when the new brotherhood dlc is added I imagine
---
I feel like you're not gonna get through here bud.
---
I‚Äôm level 230. I usually have like 180/413 carry weight.  And that‚Äôs without any carry-weight-perks on.  If I put those on it Plummer‚Äôs.  So not quite sure on that ‚Äòhigh levels carry more‚Äô?
---
Except for legendary mule-types who are being walking vendors.
---
I'm all for people connecting over common grounds but is this the correct way to go about it. Post comes of as slightly wrong. We're all just gamers. Orientation shouldn't come into it.
---
And the bullets are fairly cheap to make and are fairly common to find in ammo containers
---
Well i either need my lead or my Acid...for me...or to make caps when ppl seems to be to poor to buy my bloodied stuff for less then 2000-3000 caps.
---
Sorry but i refuse to get poor. üòï
---
I‚Äôm at the part where you need to get the security card to go to the safe room, at hornwright estate, I‚Äôve looked everywhere now
---
No worries. Have a good day, have a cold beer and relax, and goodbye.
---
I do agree with most of all that you said. The one thing that could fix most of this is knocking an arrow for you already, similar to the crossbow or allowing to fire a partially knocked arrow.  I will find that I might be a frame or two early and then hanging to go through the whole motion again. 
---
I run an explosive arrow build and don't struggle too much with breaking, but I do 1 shot most things when I hit them in the head. I average about 1k to 1.2k damage to the head on everything but the large guys and mole miners. 
---
I do run with 1 of every bow type; cryo, fire, poison, ultra with explosive being my main choice. 
---
I'm mostly worried about the bow build when the next build comes out. Having most enemies doubling in level compared to what they are now, just going to make them hit harder and since I'm not regularly hitting them in vats, me die more. 
---
I'm thinking the fix for bow before me needs to be faster reload by 30% and can increase vats hit rate to 100%.
---
I'm thankful when ppl use their nukes to spawn bosses. If they nuke some other spot, I just ignore it. It doesn't hurt me and I didn't do any of the work. And I don't care about the cooldown because I'll just server hop if there's 3 nuke zones.
---
That would be outstanding
---
Green thumb perk card and run good with salt to keep it from spoiling until you can stabilize it.
---
high hopes
---
Took part once, missed the other occasions.
---
One beautiful Day I had the pleasure to meet  him twice. At the time I was kinda broke :/
---
Have to check the map of his route and try to catch him - I do badly need some certain plans .
---
The plan was on the wiki, so I thought Sentinel was also removed from the drop lists. However, it was a dupe plan only available from the dev room.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 434 and I have 345 out of 365 carry weight
---
But then everything changed when the Brotherhood of Fire attacked
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt lock anything except the ammo maker you get from the raiders.   The water purifiers and my crops and such are always free game.   I‚Äôve never not had some when I needed it.
---
Grahm: Grahm no want fight, just trade!
---
Brotherhood Knight: Nice try mutie! Brothers take aim-
---
Literally Every 76 Dweller: Try it and we‚Äôll make Hiroshima and Nagasaki look like a joke. We‚Äôll ALL drop then sun on you.
---
(I can just see every single 76 player standing between the brotherhood and Grahm. We all may have our differences and support different factions, but there‚Äôs one thing we can all agree on... Keeping Grahm and Chally safe from the BOS.)
---
Idk those secret service guys were totally the "follow any orders higher ups give them" type guys.
---
I would never be mad. If it wasn't a spot for farmng enemies, or flux, I would scratch my head. That would be all though.
---
Imagine going through your storage container, exit, turn around, and see the slender women just staring down at you!
---
Gatling lasers need love too. I‚Äôd like my laser rifle skins to work on it
---
How dare the free stuff you give me not be good enough!
---
Make your own stupid game and then just have a big "YOU WIN, YOU'RE AMAZING" appear every time you log in.
---
Level of stuff would be nice. Or just split legendaries into a separate category so you can see someone has dozens of legendaries.
---
Don't get me started on clothing and armor being shown as the same thing.  Been complaining that this needs to be changed since vending became a thing lol.
---
Sorry, I *usually* don't do this, but it was a long post about pencils and ends painfully. 
---
&gt; **usually** junk.... So I **usually** have no issues with resources.
---
&gt; I **usually** go out collecting more than just one type of resource, so weights I **usually**
---
That‚Äôs why some people are speculating it being called Fractured Steel, they‚Äôll be split down the middle and one side helps the people like Lyons and the other helped themselves like the normal brotherhood and Maxon.
---
I think that sounds awesome.
---
From the comments I guess I‚Äôm against the grain.  For me a nuke not on SBQ or Earl is a waste.  White spring is cool I guess but I don‚Äôt really see the point.  It is funny when someone gets mad and targets a camp...but usually the person just logs out quick.  Not that it would make me mad if they didn‚Äôt take earl or SBQ...I just think it‚Äôs a waste.
---
Stealth will be 100% useless in the Daily Ops.
---
And if they did kill Grahm. Well the silos will have to have a waiting list
---
I want to make sure everyone knows I'm curling up at night with both Gramps and Rose. It's very important to the game.
---
im surprised this never came WITH the bow when you equip it tbh, even just a weirdly shaped waist quiver similar to a cross bow in skyrim
---
if you're the only one fighting then stop. stop carrying fools.
---
The damage, recoil and rate of fire remind me of driving a Shelby Cobra in Gran Tourismo, which had insane power to weight ratio and massive oversteer.
---
I just found an anti-armor/fire rate/perception combat shotgun that's better behaved, but my one star quad double barrel still out-damages it on a per shot basis by a tiny amount against even high armor opponents, while having a much higher rate of fire and tighter spread. The only thing the combat shotgun has going for it is 50% more range, but I have pistols for that. I guess I'll add a supressor to the AA for stealth.
---
What would you suggest the alternative punishment for dying during an event be then?
---
I keep two purifiers locked to make sure that I‚Äôll have at least 10 when I swing by. The other eight stay unlocked.
---
The mohawk and cartoon voice, I can't help but think of her as a "bad girl" My Little Pony.
---
In a sea of random ideas on here, this is a great one
---
Not quite sure what you‚Äôre trying to say. They wouldn‚Äôt be a different orientation in that sense, considering I‚Äôm LGBT+ as well. I have an absolute abundance of straight/‚Äúcis‚Äù (don‚Äôt like that term) friends, but I‚Äôm also looking to enjoy my favorite game franchise while meeting people who share a connection towards LGBT+ like I do. Because that‚Äôs what I want to do with my free time. Love it or hate it, that‚Äôs just how I want to spend my time. 
---
Also, Reddit‚Äôs literally the place to discuss everything. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs practically a subreddit for everything. I get the strong feeling that you don‚Äôt like people mentioning differing sexualities because it makes you uncomfortable, whether you care to admit it or not. I mean hell, I‚Äôm rather confident that you wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to my previously-mentioned example of an ‚Äúall-male group‚Äù. That‚Äôs what irks me, if anything. Those types of views are rarely consistent, and it‚Äôs predictable at this point. Whether those are your true colors or not, I can only infer off of 2 Reddit comments, along with anecdotes, so take that as you will. I don‚Äôt usually entertain Reddit arguments, but I‚Äôm just being blunt and trying to understand you with an open-mind. 
---
 I personally used to avoid other sexualities until I realized it was over the fact that they made me uncomfortable for whatever reason, and I used to say the same exact things. I didn‚Äôt like that they made gay characters in video games and etc. because I didn‚Äôt see why it needed to be a big deal. Now I realize it‚Äôs not a big deal and that I didn‚Äôt necessarily *have* to care whether it was involved in my video games or not. It doesn‚Äôt add or subtract anything, it‚Äôs just there. Idk, just my sleep-deprived rant and my two cents on the subject. Was originally going to be dismissive of this conversation, but it became an interesting thought-piece.
---
Found the BOS member. :&lt;
---
Yup, I got caught in a lame ass punji board camp last weekend and made the decision to keep at least 15-20 on hand for such a case. It‚Äôs time to start fighting back.
---
On all my toons(Full Health builds) I use a minimum of 1chameleon, 1autostim, 1tshooters..
---
the other two slots could be vanguard, mutants or a 2nd piece of the primary 3 effects I use.. whatever has the best stats I have access to at any given moment
---
for other effects I look for things like reduced weights, harder to detect, reduced falling damage, AP refresh, rad resist, poison resist and +1 to specials..
---
They are
---
Definitely. And I mean, maybe we will be able to pick a branch of the BOS to side with. Honestly though, if that IS the case? I just hope that picking one means you can't pick the other. As much as it might limit things, I'd rather it make sense than simply just be a means of pandering to everyone.
---
Don't you mean future fallout games since this takes place before all those?
---
I once got a Furious Rolling Pin, just wish the Atomic Shop has Fuzzy Slippers, Bath Robe and Hair Curlers to go with it.
---
Why does there need to be a punishment?
---
They've been data mined along with a power armor display as well.  Hopefully they will get released soon. I'm excited to finally be able to display some cool stuff
---
I can't believe you said that. I've always thought of Rose's voice as a crazy mix of Rainbow Dash and Elmyra from the old Tiny Toons lol.
---
After spending 20+ minutes launching a nuke, I'd rather get something out of the event than nothing.
---
That‚Äôs pretty smart, act as a warning to others and save your loot. I like it.
---
The stash lag is bound to the items in your stash. Especially all the notes and holos hoarded. And maybe all the plans you're never going to sell... Try to get rid of it all
---
This is why I never visit camps with any scrap. I don't know if this is their substitute for pvp or if they are too lazy to farm for scrap or if they are role playing. Whatever the case...dont accept candy from strangers.
---
Even bloodied right now are not that great. They do high dmg but are just to slow if you run into a mob and with seemingly everything in the game staggering you when you get hit it resets the draw of the bow. But once the over all damage nerfs come in update 22 theyre just going to be garbage without a buff
---
Don't post his name as I'm sure it's against the rules üòâüëç but yeah hate those that ruins the fun for others ü§îüòî don't let those people get to you
---
I've been looking for bows in the wild and can't find them. Any advice?
---
Explained it better in my last reply towards the first commenter. Came off a bit bitchy originally because I‚Äôve yet to sleep for the past 2 days, but I have a rational reason for my post. I‚Äôm considered LGBT+. It‚Äôs completely confusing and I don‚Äôt have friends who can relate to it. In the meantime, I‚Äôm just now getting into Fallout 76. Because of that, it seems like a perfect time to branch out and meet people who can connect with me on those levels. I benefit in the sense that I enjoy the game with some new buddies, and I also get to enjoy fallout 76 after they finally added NPCs. It‚Äôs a double win situation.
---
Yeah same
---
Isn‚Äôt gold used in some computer parts? Not at the level we‚Äôd be paying for, of course, but I imagine he‚Äôd like to keep himself supplied with everything he needs to keep repairing his systems.
---
Change it over to prime and craft ultracite 2mm cartridges. You get waaaay more bang for your buck with that.
---
Really? Nice!
---
Title makes me think you lost to someone using froglegs.
---
&gt; considering I‚Äôm LGBT+
---
I always have a real good and hard laugh at this. Thank you.
---
There were technical issues when they were added initially, for example issue where "tax" caused items sold for 1 cap each resulted tax effectively taking more then it was supposed to.
---
"Tax" is also not advertised anywhere in-game, who collects it? At least with fast travel you can make guesses what caps are used for, with vending machines I can only come up with caps being shredded inside.
---
Ace told me to get out of his way because as I was standing near his docking station. 
---
  
---
I laughed so hard. I love his sass.
---
Wym energy weapons like the Gatling Plasma, Ultracite Gatling Lazer and the Tesla Rifle are busted. If anything they need this nerf that's coming out in this latest patch. Lazer/plasma pistols on the other hand are üí© and do need a buff tho. But I digress, energy weapons do need more skins. üëç
---
No one touches my acid.
---
Theirs a video on YouTube of this guy nuking camps that had ridiculous prices in their vending machines.
---
You earn the nuke you get to nuke where ever and what ever you like in my mind.
---
Rifle gaming?
---
It's definitely because they're too lazy to farm..üòÇü§£ Why have fun in a game when you can ruin it for others right? Smh
---
I usually port around a lot with my higher level character.  But since this one is only level 18, my caps were low.  This camp was on my way to my next quest.  Porting to empty my scrap was a thought but at this point, I guess after 600 hours and not having this happen once, I guess I was naive.  I hope that's the last time it happens (or I guess I should say, let it happen).
---
I mean, if you wanna talk about glaring logical loopholes, let's start with the fact that pencil "lead" is not actually lead anyway, nor has it ever been. It's actually graphite, which is a form of carbon (which is also what diamond is, while we're on the subject). If you wanna find lead in a writing instrument, you'll have to go all the way back to the ancient Romans.
---
It's gonna be hilarious when the BOS try to take control of Appalachia and a horde of bloodied players descend on them in fury
---
Ahh, I should‚Äôve known you were joking when you tried to victimize yourself for being excluded. Thanks for the reassurance that you weren‚Äôt being serious this whole time.
---
Hell no! Fuck the Brotherhood, too!üñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèª
---
He needs all the gold to enact new world order part 2
---
It stands to reason that the school in the city of the future would be automated in my opinion.  That includes computers for teachers and students, robots for security and notes, or even just voice activated technology.
---
Mr fuzzy is your friend. Mr fuzzy loves to play.

https://youtu.be/EJYqQdtd2DQ
---
Not sure I was far down the youtube rabbit hole and a few whiskey's in by that point but I did learn the old power connector and rug trick from fallout 4 worked in 76 for shelf filling in camps üòè
---
if there is not a scope on that gun at that moment, then it counts
---
Help yourself to using my camp and free water. No locked doors or water purifiers. 
---
But my extractor, my collectron, my Armco ammo machine are all locked. Believe it or not I actually thrive off my junk node as for some damn reason even as a 3 character high level player can‚Äôt seem to maintain decent levels of adhesive, aluminum and ballistic fiber.
---
There would have to be a lot more unique rewards from past fallout games for it to be worth doing
---
Why would faster fire on the 44 be useless?
---
They explained it at launch. No it‚Äôs not explained in game, just like it‚Äôs not explained how robot vendors don‚Äôt keep 100% of caps you give when you buy stuff.
---
It works for all matching sets including power armour. It doesn't work for Chinese stealth armour or hazmat suit
---
Omg. I don‚Äôt understand still. Feeling like idiot(
---
Any sample of such case?
---
Yeah, seriously wanted to Tcl into that room..just to finish this friggin quest.
---
Looks a lot like just a blue paint with a red and black line . XD
---
Yea you‚Äôre probably right lol
---
does the gun on your hands have a scope on it?
---
Yes - No Bonus
---
No- Bonus
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied build and I can easily do ACP. Probably bc I use a B25 Gatling laser for dealing  for a lot of damage and a V25 Gatling plasma for killing those stupid Wendigos mainly to get that health regen. Granted, I still die a couple times, and I most likely can‚Äôt solo it bc I‚Äôm not a Normie stealth bloodied commando 12-year-old who will throw a fit when they can‚Äôt kill the queen in 21 seconds once this nerf hits, but still I can do pretty well if I do say so myself, which I do
---
It only collects handcuffs, leather, rubber and industrial size shortening.
---
It seems me all guns have scopes in basic not modded version. Or I‚Äôm mistaken?
---
They took our JERBS!
---
yeah so like does the forest scout and urban count as the same set? or separate sets cuz they use the same mods n stuff i think
---
Imagine the CAMP budget that would eat up with the servers having to work extra to display all the clutter though. We're already struggling as it is. (Perhaps if we get instanced interiors, but I'm guessing even that's a long shot.)
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd actually love it too. Really weirds me out how we have all those shelves and tables and everything and we can't place any of the stuff on them that we find literally everywhere in Appalachia. But... yeah. CAMP budgets. :/
---
Personally I think that you should be able to fire very quick shots at the current accuracy/spread, but holding the draw for the whole duration would shrink the reticle and decrease the spread. Like shotgun spread vs rifle spread. I think this single change would change the viability of bows, and make it so they are reliable outside of vats.
---
I hope they add more weeks with this double score. Otherwise it will require playing daily during almost the teen weeks without a single missed challenge in order to get to level 100 without spending atoms.
---
Because sexual preference is simultaneously unimportant while being important. If it were normalized then nobody would be complaining about this post in all honesty. Insert the obligatory mention of people ignoring ‚Äúall-male‚Äù groups, and depending on the game ‚Äúall-female‚Äù groups.
---
Right, they should instead charge us all a monthly fee to support the game. /s
---
exactly this. if they dont like where a nuke is dropped, they can always drop one themselves.
---
You are confusing ‚Äòsights‚Äô with ‚Äòscopes‚Äô.
---
I see my post worked from last week
---
I wish more people would nuke Guided Meditation. There‚Äôs every type of flux available and you get mobs of ghouls. Yeah it‚Äôs a short event but I‚Äôve done a few of these in a nuke zone and they can be a lot of fun.
---
After 25 years where is the manager  my sons are waiting  for me in the house...
---
I used to think that too.  I hope I can again because I love Mr. Fuzzy.
---
Nuka Cola......
---
Drink. Some. water.
---
That was my question as well. Does it count as a matching set because they are all ‚Äúscout‚Äù pieces, or do they have to be all forest or all urban as well?
---
Ahh, bullsh*** U r right. There is some differenceüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Probably just her voice.
---
Why does he talk about jet if it isn't in the game?
---
honestly they could make them mods. drains ammo straight from your reserves (so like nerver ending) but give you a movement speed penalty when having it out. (maybe more AP drain when running with it out too?)
---
i mean from what i've heard apparently theres going to be infighting and we can decide who leads the appalachian BoS and thus what their goals are.
---
why destroy them when you can control them
---
So I got the dialogue, chose to find a new world and then when I got to the new world everything was gone.
---
It‚Äôs sounding like I was unlucky enough to spawn in at the wrong second. I‚Äôve recently spawned into a Nuke zone and my camp was fine so idk.
---
Well yeah obviously, like the only reason it‚Äôs used isn‚Äôt for its original purpose, to jump TO things. These guys will just use it to jump around to not get shot. Like cmon, just play the game and shoot like a man üòÇ
---
But then how would I punish griefers?
---
I just got a grip of max level bloodied weapons from a level 6 player vender. Like 6 weapons for about 15k.
---
Some?  There‚Äôs a pretty significant difference, friend. 
---
A scope involves optics and usually a magnification factor. 
---
Sights have no optics or magnification.
---
When I'm in an area, and someone is close to dying, they ask me for help, and I just cackle and say" oh I will help you,  WHERES MY BBQ SAUCE".
---
Because you died. Ofcourse there needs to be a consequence.
---
Exactly, best part of finishing the legendary run was not having to play that POS game mode every single day.
---
I only think it's annoying. And only when the user spams out grenades.
---
Nerd rage perk
---
Truuu
---
If you have a scope there is a tube like thing on top of your weapon.  You look through it and it magnifies things.  You will see things inside of a circle and the screen around it will be black.  These ARE scopes
---
All guns will have some sort of "sights" on them for aiming.  That is NOT a scope.
---
Yep. My word ‚Äúsome‚Äù was ironic))
---
is pacifist on?
---
Fair enough. Glad I could help.
---
no but i didn‚Äôt think it needed to be for me to not get killed without instigating it? its weird!
---
turn on pacifist
---
Sweet. Never find stuff like that myself even after hopping like 5 worlds and visiting every vendor.  
---
What platform?  I‚Äôm on XB1
---
üëçüèª‚úåüèª
---
okay, thanks. i know that would help but i‚Äôm questioning the system as a whole? they shouldn‚Äôt be able to deal damage if i do nothing?
---
Thank you.  I didn't actually know that about the rules.  I'm glad now that I didn't put it in my original post.  I figured I described the situation well enough that it will hopefully help others to avoid this particular camp anyway.
---
Mine is trapped in a corner of my camp, so he pretty much cannot do anything else than that.
---
Yes Beth even said in release notes and promotions that you would have time to prepare for the event in the mine so I assumed it would have a stash box.
---
Any person could be an AFK wank stain, not just low levels. I‚Äôve completed this event several times with low level buddies. They were good and drawing Earl‚Äôs attention and stimming me if I got downed. Join ACP on my level 15 character, not much I could do but I made sure to draw attention and heal people when down. The other level 400s on my team and in the event didn‚Äôt seem to mind much when I actually helped.
---
How about New world blues instead?
---
&gt;they shouldn‚Äôt be able to deal damage if i do nothing?
---
if pacifist is off I dont understand why that would be...
---
there is a PVP warning when you hit lvl 5..
---
TRAGIC CARDS
---
Xbox as well. It seriously takes patience. Most of the time I‚Äôm just shopping for scrip, but sometimes you come across some true gems. Either people that don‚Äôt know what they got or people that don‚Äôt need caps to survive... Bless ‚Äòem either way.
---
these are valid exceptions.  I'm thinking of the limited phrases that exist between all the vendors ... the vendor (Chad ?) at the fairgrounds also has potter t that is unique to him
---
good call, you guys !
---
yep, itsa bug. change servers to make it stop.
---
Sincere thanks for your reply!!
---
guess i thought the system was:
---
person 1 attacks person 2
---
in order for pvp to initiate person 2 attacks person 1 back
---
just asking a question here.
---
I'm more concerned with the way they display corpses.  Like raiders in shiny armor.
---
*I just love songs, don't youuuuuu?*
---
It‚Äôs probably that damn insultbot, think about it. How else could he afford that gold paint job? He‚Äôs been skimming some off the top for years now.
---
right ... because everything in Fo76 is so even from beginning to end - like when Melody Larkin comes on the radio screeching at top volume about the church or wolf packs, or the lighting for one part of an office to the next, or ...
---
thats not how it works.. thats what pacifist is for..
---
it was like that originally and people cried like newboorn babies looking for their mothers tit about it...
---
I don't PvP, but what I thought the reciprocating attack to trigger damage only applied in openworld.  I would think just entering PvP is an agreement to fight others, since it is PvP.   Is this you first time in PvP?
---
Fancy Pump Shotgun is Anti Armored, that thing is really nice.
---
What cause you to instantly die do you know? Asking for.. research purposes
---
A little update as I got on this morning.. The atom glitch for me fixed itself and I now own everything in the shop, have FO 1st again and got reset back to my 6,000 atoms.
---
It's absolute bs how they did you for reporting the issue compared to me when I never reported the issue. Smh Beth
---
if there is a food animal spawn or if they have a brahmin for fertilizer you can hit it with a bloatfly syringer and lure the fly to the bait bombs to trigger
---
Yup üëç luckily most of those stupid people don't play fallout anymore because of pvp nerfs üëåüòâ but it still suck when the odd one shows up from time to time
---
Does fire lining works the same as fireproof or dense?
---
I got mine from a "defend workshop" event.
---
Throw explosive bait in his camp.
---
Thanks. Playing 76 feels like "Adventures in Bug land" some days.
---
yes ... if we could limit the frequency of clangs and screeches, because technically it isn't volume per se, but frequency
---
like TV commercials which appear so much louder
---
I would not disparage anyone of any level if they are at least giving effort and trying to help
---
Unyielding or Bolstering. Unyielding if you‚Äôre going stealthy and Bolstering if you‚Äôre going loud and dumb.
---
Itsa me, a bugio
---
Yo I thought private servers stay the same, but I can farm them? Huge gamechanger, thanks man!
---
Were you on a team?
---
or itll just cost 5$ in the atom shop
---
I think I understand how they work in theory but I failed some how. I would never grief a player on this game, but I came across a camp with a Nazi symbol and though NOW is the time. I pulled those baits out of my stash and riddled the camp with them. No luck attracting animals. So I wandered off an dragged a Scortched beast back and that did the trick. 
---
What am I doing wrong? I only want to use this power for good, but all I know are Jedis. They want tell me the story!
---
one of f my favourite bits of scripting in the game, i think of it out of context, even
---
soon we will have more gold items to buy, including War glave mods (assuming they stick to Regs) Non-cosmetic Seasons rewards (if we missed out) and lunch boxes for a disposable resource
---
Do you try to be inclusive, being exclusive ???
---
I understand your frustration. But on the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game. If you need some junk just hit me up
---
theyd still get holstered?
---
certain weapons just didnt have a holster if it wouldnt be functional, like if they had big spikes or pointy bits.
---
I'm certain that even if they don't have long distance methods of observation any more, they would see them long before arriving.  They're coming on foot.
---
What a mind fuck it would be to see the area you're headed to hit with nukes, what, daily?  Even if they're the low yield bombs they appear to be.  They want something real bad.
---
You know what? I can respect that. Anyways, have a good day.
---
cause that would be 2 to 5 different holding animations depending on the front and grip/stock.
---
now imagine 50 different holstering positions due to different mod combinations.
---
why does this never happen at Whitesprings, even with players running in and out ?  it isn't a function of enough equipment but of NPCs bumbling around trying to not stand still with their hands in their pockets
---
Am I the only who lights all my fire works as soon as I get them?
---
i think we've met !
---
Correct, you both need to do damage, but there are many ways to do damage. If you are on a PC it might be a hack.
---
Playing cards with others would be awesome, I want to flip the table and melt everyone with my Gatling laser when things don‚Äôt go my way :)
---
I thought about this too when I was forced to place this god awful game mode for score last season... 
---
I can queue solo but everybody else gets into the 4 person team. You‚Äôd have no idea how annoying it is how many times I‚Äôd be among the top 5 against a team of four... Yet another unbalanced thing in this game mode of many.
---
The problem is having too many treasury notes to use due to being able to trade in only 20 at a time. I'm quite excited about the new things coming out and those lunch boxes are going to be incredibly useful
---
nope!
---
it was open world!
---
In almost all films, books or other media that I have watched or read, where there is a character who is too nice and believes that helping others, even if they're ill-hearted is the right thing to do always makes them end up dead. It always seems to be a common theme that super nice people never make it to the end. So I do have a feeling that good ol' Dorsey won't receive the greeting that he expects from the Brotherhood.
---
it was on xbox. thx for giving me a straight answer
---
Toxic goo from westtek, help yourself to some from the unlimited supply on the floor through the door leading left.
---
As well as being specifically mentioned in Inside The Vault: "We‚Äôre even experimenting with some new rank-up rewards, like Vintage Nukashine and Nuclear Keycards."
---
"[I] think murder is the solution"
---
LOL !!!
---
always, my friend ; it is never not
---
Leader of the pack event for 3 kills or if that‚Äôs not available I go clear out all of whitesprings, that usually does the trick but if it somehow doesn‚Äôt I do events I know has a legendary at the end. Riding Shotgun, Free Range, Project Paradise, etc. Uranium Fever is good for three like leader of the pack.
---
Nice theory until you run out of flux. It takes me maybe 30-45 minutes to farm enough lead and steel for 4k rounds  takes me 2 nuke launches and some luck to get enough fluids and crap to produce a lot of flux.   
---
With most of the early dupers stock running low now the price of fluxes have been getting unreasonable.
---
I'd love this. I keep my scrap box by my workshop so when I come back to camp I can scrap weapons etc and unload all of the steel conveniently but the scrap box looks so out of place
---
I hope he stops playing soon.  He was in a newbie area and had lots of items, ammo, plans etc in his vendors.  It seemed like more of a greeting sort of situation that I started to think it was one of the people setup to help newbies.  One of the main reasons I opted to post this.  They are the ones it will effect more then me...I have a higher character to get scrap from if I need it.  It's tough to port when encumbered and early game you are always encumbered.
---
That is my understanding. They fixed the issue of getting sucked into PVP by a team member, so you have to do damage somehow. If you own a workshop you don't have to do any damage to be in PVP. Maybe @ bug, maybe a hack.
---
I just recently added born survivor to my build and I love it. The only difference is that I carry 200 stimpack at a time now since it burns through them. However I die way less often with it
---
Pretty sure they are a reward in the next season that starts in a week and a half.
---
Your title says "in PvP", a bit misleading.  Were you claiming a workshop at the time this happened?
---
There is also a blood eagle camp at the bottom of the map with weights right next to a work bench. Might be sludgeworks or something i forget
---
Healing factor reduces chem effectiveness, so diluted radaway heals less. Downside is less effect from psychos
---
I think I'll wait a week or so before using the mannequin when it comes out just to see how many people lost their rare outfits to a glitch.
---
Just saying shouldn't we all just be gamers. Regardless of anything that makes us different. Asking for a select group of people to play with feels like it goes against LGBT as one of the main goals is to just be recognised as equal and accepted. As soon as you make a post asking for a certain group it just feels wrong because then not everyone is equal or accepted. Just seems like the wrong place to try and do this.
---
I did envision his camp getting destroyed...but I didn't have nearly enough explosives and 0 perks in explosives, so it wouldn't have helped at the time unfortunately.
---
I really wish they‚Äôd fix that already... If I craft 30 round that gets an extra 30 from ammosmith so it‚Äôs 60, I expect to get an extra 60 instead of 30 from super duper. Almost no point in bothering to equip super duper for it.
---
Something similar happens if your in a players decontamination shower and they log out the effect stick and eventually the game will crash after some time.
---
Can you not go back with your other character and fuck his shit up?
---
the other day a travelling merchant used my wapon bench and locked it up, constantly afterwards giving me the "this shit is being used, stupid" message.  had to remove it, then drop a new one !
---
like it isn't bad enough when an NPC is actually blocking us
---
That sounds nice lol I hate fighting my way through the silos, shit annoys the hell out of me
---
So far it seems like it collects the same stuff as Ace with little BoS comments now and then. Doesn't seem to talk as often as ace so far
---
do you want junk or one liners?
---
because collectrons are only good at one of those...
---
They dont always end up there I don't think but when they do, it's hilarious lmao
---
Somehow unbloodied seems worse than undeath.....
---
Also, if you own a workshop you don't have to do damage. I don't know for sure if you have to be near (in the boundary) the workshop to be attacked.
---
Happy for you. The shotty destroys everything. Super fun especially with jet pack and marsupial. Kind of a raining hell from the sky thing.
---
This is exactly how it works, this other guy doesn't know what he's talking about. There may be exploits like you suggested by using magic weapons, but I am not sure on that. If you are claiming or contesting a workshop, then that's different. PVP is auto initiated in that circumstance.
---
ETA: it could be possible that you initiated by accident in an event or something. Sometimes the game won't put you in an event when you join and you can accidentally tag others. Happens at the scorchbeast queen a lot.
---
Just wait until later the same day to go back to the area they're in.
---
Ugh, that sucks so bad. I'm glad that I've never run into anyone like that (though I've had plenty of issues at workshops) but I always feel bad when someone else does.
---
I hope its a very cool outfit It would go good with the Reclaimed Deep Mining Gas Mask or the ranger helmet
---
Found out from another comment you can get that pack of rare clothes and masks from ANY savage divide event, not just uranium Fever. Savage divide just got a whole lot better looking...
---
The problem isn't the flux; it's the high radiation fluids
---
There is no cap. They said there was but it was never implemented. Otherwise you could do the old school stacks and have 500 str and 500 int where you one shotted everything in melee including the queen.   
---
I can also say when my unyielding bugs and I am above 50 in most stats you see the difference, and AP is up the correct points.   
---
Now maybe there is a cap for the actual sneak mechanic but I don't sneak I just straight up murder. They get to see my face.
---
Ah.  Jump back in immediately?

‚ÄúThe higher you sell, the higher you lose‚Äù

Yes that‚Äôs how taxes work

If you don't have some form of punishment for dying during a boss fight, then you can cheese the whole event by just dealing enough chip damage until it dies even if you die 100 times. As in people that can't handle the challenge still get the same rewards as those who can which is not the goal here for an endgame boss fight/event.
---
Idk how much I like the death timer (although I rarely even die once now), but there could've been worse ways to handle it. Like imagine every death making you deal less damage. Every death making you earn less rewards. After a couple deaths being kicked out of the event. Etc.
---
that sounds exactly like the worst experience i have had - it was impossible to leave.  tbh, i was trying to loot when they apparently caught my scent (or my bad breath ?) and congregated around me like reporters around Michael Epstein's corpse
---
Ill join your world let me know when your on
---
I always put a scrapbox and stashbox near the entrance of my camp/house, so that players can walk around my camp without worrying about what might happen.  But in the same vein, I always look for a scrapbox (or do so at home) before visiting camps.
---
if you own multiple collectrons you can place down on your camp the one like the most for its dialogue but select what it collects by interacting with the terminal attached to it.
---
for exemple: I have the commie collector at my camp because I find it amusing. but I made it collect BOS itens.
---
Yep...
---
On Xbox there are 2 screens of info when you have the BoS skin, not one.  Did you try hitting whatever is the "continue" key?
---
Gimme the FO3 raider armor, orrrr the naughty nightwear
---
Thanks.  I know it's a game, but games are supposed to be fun.  I mean I have had people lure me into helping fight off a mob chasing them and then they stand back, watch me die then kill everything quickly and take my junk.  It pissed me off of course but that was different.  I was a higher level but I was in build mode so my perks weren't set up the same as battle.  This one lured in a low level character to steal their junk and make fun of them.  It's more the principle of it then the stuff I lost in this case.
---
That's exactly what a smart spy would do!  Hide in plain sight!
---
I actually have Ace collect Fasnacht treats. I use it for food so I don‚Äôt have to cook so often. But he also brings me about 3 Royal jelly a day which I do cook and never spoils. Once I get stocked on food I have Ace collect ammo. But I do appreciate the jokes and one liners.
---
I do the same.
---
Did you attack them? Were they wanted? Do you have Unstable Isotope or Electrically Charged? Did you accidentally tag, die but then seek revenge? 
---
So much info missing for anyone to try and help you understand what's going on.
---
A skin that matches your stash. You'd think that wouldn't be hard to do. Good idea
---
For a while butchers bounty worked with collecting the high tax fluids and hardened masses. It‚Äôs been forever since I had to do a run for stabilizing ingredients so I don‚Äôt know if that still works. I DO know that nuking Tanagra town and getting an ultracite vein to glitch will give you tons of high rad fluids and hardened masses.
---
Thank you! It was really fun to build ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
He better be collecting legendary weapons if he wants to replace my Fasnacht collectron.
---
It only collects scrap it seems. No junk.
---
Don‚Äôt have space, sadly. Can‚Äôt turn my analysis off.
---
But isn't the aim of the game to be the last player standing? Do you just stand still when being shot? Doesn't a moving target increase your chance of survival?
---
Maybe you didn't see them as season rewards because they're going to be Atomic Shop items?
---
They have acknowledged it and, something about how the damage is being registered and it's been difficult to fix.
---
I probably could have, or should have.  But after leaving that server, I wasn't eager to jump back on there.  I guess I was licking my wounds.
---
I have a Mr. Fuzzy costume and I'm proud of it, it cost me a long grind and I always wear it. 
---
I am friendly and drop supplies to newbies. I don't get what the costume has to do with someone's behavior...
---
They kept resetting the trap while my body was in there so I didn't mind and I wasn't wearing armor so nothing of mine brokeüòÇ
---
I'd like this.  My 1500 useless T-Notes would have new life.
---
Haha.. this is something that would happen to me.
---
God yes. I really have to get around to sharing my raider camp...
---
There are good flux farming locations like Morgantown or Whitespring. If you need flux or the materials for it, that's why folks nuke there. Obviously Whitespring used to be the place but not as much since they nerfed the spawns.
---
The Fixer has a skin slot on the PTS, and already shares skins with the combat rifle.
---
Sounds about right for them. I experienced the same type of help when my fallout 1st subscription didn't work for the entire month I had paid for.
---
Rad related stuff definitely goes on the favourite wheel.
---
Just pointing out that if you don't use power armor all the time and and you use any weapons that use energy cells it's more weight efficient to find a reduced weight assaultron head. This is because you won't need to lug around gamma rounds in addition to fusion cells you already use 
---
I believe energy cells weigh a lot less than aid does unless you have thru hiker max level (I'm not sure which is lighter at that point).
---
Aid is generally quicker to use but once you experiment you may figure out what you like best and what works best for your character 
---
My commando uses an assaultron head, and my heavy gunner uses mostly aid (glowing blood) but also has a two shot  gamna gun (you get extra rads with two shot). In power armor aid much more effective because of rad resistance the power armor provides.
---
Also, radiation rumble is an excellent source of glowing blood.
---
Im sad that this hasnt happened yet, and im heavy weapons guy. Have an award
---
It's a cultist encampment.
---
That's probably because you still have it set to ammo/weapons you'd have to change it's perameters to "BOS Mission" to get what he collects which is glass and cloth and stuff
---
You know damn well they're going to charge us for something like that.
---
That was about inconsistencies for pve. Vats is *disabled* for PVP.
---
Added Perk if anyone tried to steal from it the escaping air would mimic the scream causing them to run in terror haha
---
Probably Jesse's but Walter's was probably better bang for your buck! Can't beat that purity after all.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs an issue for me if they don‚Äôt take earl or SBQ.  Just for me it‚Äôs a waste, seems like a lot of effort for some random flux farming.  I get plenty of flux...an overwhelming amount in my stash as of now from queen or earl runs.
---
These series of posts could be summed up as hey Bethesda make at least one skin for every weapon and make every weapon have an available attachment for every possible slot, k thanks
---
It's really not. It collects the same items you turned in to the guy at atlas.
---
Would that break your armour?
---
Barter is great! üëç I think trade would probably be the most ubiquitous transaction in a post apocalyptic wasteland. However, if the limit was 300,000 caps, then the price for your shotgun would go from 3,000 to 30,000 (obviously the numbers there are arbitrary and serve only as an example). The more money people have, the higher the price per item goes due to the currency losing value per unit, creating a never ending spiral of economic silliness. 
---
Your response doesn‚Äôt at all contradict what I said, and what‚Äôs more, your response was made to a comment I made 167 days ago. Go back to bed.
---
Is free junk worth the nothing you pay for it? Yes, I believe so.
---
Wasn't wearing any at the time, I had seen the trap coming and I took it all off as quickly as I could
---
The health kit, the rad kit, the nukashine and the nuke cards have no business being there.
---
The fireworks are also a joke, at least make it a plan you can learn. The only thing useful about the fireworks was that it glitched your reload speed.
---
As a high school teacher I can confirm a serious lack of
---
Pens and pencils in most high schools. Very accurate. Good job Bethesda
---
You get the plan..
---
Thanks, I too feel bad when it happens to others. I know others have posted similar stuff but I still wanted people to know to avoid him. And you know, I was enjoying that server.  I was on there for about an hour and had actually been insulted twice!  I'm used to porting around so much that I guess the insult bots struggle to catch me.  Who would have thought that being insulted by a robot would be such a highlight.
---
I usually just give up the workshops if someone wants it.  So far no one has just randomly opened fire on me at a workshop.  But the first thing I do is make scrap and stash boxes and as soon as I port into it, I head straight for it.  So hopefully they wouldn't get much if they tried.  But workshops at least, you know there is a chance of being attacked by players.  You don't usually expect Mr. Fuzzy to try and kill you for junk...that's something out of a horror movie/nightmare.
---
Let's hope he is not trying to sell you Deth Shticks.
---
Don't worry. MODUS recruited people like me to cull the BoS tech raider threat.
---
I agree with all of the above.  A general weapons rebalancing should come in tandem with the damage calculation change.
---
What I'm saying is that pistol grip could mean hip holster and rifle grip means weapon hanging from the back, backpacks made it a lot harder though.
---
Lol. Sometimes there's a bright side. The sheep dropped some armor that has Reduce damage while blocking, so despite the bug I got some bugged gear I'm gonna test with my bugged weapons to see if they are buggier than my normally bugged magic weapons. 
---
I wanna know if bugs stack.
---
Probably me.  Perk load mod makes that incredibly easy
---
Yeah i just cant spend hours on top of what I normally play farming crimson
---
thanks for mentioning this - someone will find that fact helpful in the future
---
i had no idea then, kind of like my first time in "Lode Baring", "Uranium Fever¬†" or "Radiation Rumble", but based on my experience of hanging around Arktos Pharma - at very low level - after "Project Paradise" ended and discovering that i dropped my Junk for reals because the event had ended ... and the following thirty minutes of running around, shatting myself every time an Assaultron was alerted to my presence, or a CFG saw me ... i wasn't taking any chances !
---
Or maybe they can put a different version of the item that you want to put? Per example i want to put in my camp a metal table which have the default plain version as a first choice, and then another one (as skin) which have a typewriter, a lamp and a plant already on it?
---
Yes, this. I want to mow them down
---
Yes, until the nuke zone has dissipated.
---
I have a SS chest piece with that perk.  Shotgun VATS is insane.  Enjoy!
---
I'm surprised during Quake con we didn't get a super shotgun skin from DOOM. Or at least, something similar with all the engraving
---
Surprised Final Render isn't getting some love.  I enjoy his videos and streams.
---
when your dead its not your junk anymore..
---
Thanks for confirming one more time that you are more than confused.
---
Adrenalin and gun fu together make you a one shot master. I play bloodied vats crit sniper and at an Earle fight one shot wendigos until they are all gone and then put 15 or so rounds into Earle usually around 300 damage each shot, then I go back to killing wendigos so the heavies can continue doing their thing. I also have grim reaper and consume a lot of honey because I burn through a lot of AP.
---
What rads, the team damage one, funky duds, sizzling style, luck, and I'm not sure on the 6th probably another special
---
Junkies pa heavy BTW
---
definitely SPECIAL cards.. the rest are kinda bunk and or useless to me with my playstyle
---
Same.  I have stash everywhere to make people feel safe.  But usually add only one scrap bin in my building that is my workshop.  At workshops I always place bins next to the workshop claim bench (but that is often in the center, so I could be a target for a bit, but that is the risk of workshops).
---
I don‚Äôt usually use frog legs. I like to sneak
---
Around and find frog legs just puts a target on my back
---
I made a post 2 days ago complaining about how thr super sledge and handmade are geting season skins again.
---
Yea I'm just looking to give you a chance to get it back. More about honor than "ownership"
---
Frog legs are mandatory. Go get some yourself
---
Day one player who has never even launched a nuke here; no lol 
---
I just show up to help out and get the goods. 
---
Not my nuke, not my problem
---
Afraid not - not showing on the gameboard as rewards.
---
Even if I die again it's still feels like I could do something to try and defend my honor haha
---
Death should be something you try and avoid...
---
No one is complaining about the preference, but the fact that you make it a topic is what gets our gander.
---
This is a game not one of your groups where you search for like minded confusionistas.
---
Thats all I wanted in a private server so I could build massive workshops.
---
I can't tell if this is a joke or Bethesda being Bethesda...
---
Now we just need an Enclave Collectron voiced by MODUS.
---
Member.
---
I've always thought the Mysteries quest chain was underutilized.  Perfect setup for a daily with that computer still running and you now "In charge" of it.  ESPECIALLY now that there are actual raiders back in the area.  There are....things that could have been done earlier, scouting or provisioning missions, target the Super Mutants or the Mole Miners, clear an area of Ghouls....but now that there are actual raiders as well, perfect place to add a Mistress of Mysteries daily quest and rewards associated with them.....wouldn't really be much different from getting the notification "A settlement is in need of your help"  ;-)
---
I‚Äôll second the assaultron head for fine tuning your rads, ammo is easy to find and you can get really close to exactly 20% health if you‚Äôre running some rad resist on your armor/backpack. If you craft secret service armor, you can get it down to something like 12 rads each time you fire, but lead lined backpack is helpful in the meantime. I never liked dirty water or toxic goo on account of the weight and inconvenience (disease for dirty water and trips to collect for goo).
---
Is this some sort of fallout 1st post that I'm too poor to understand?
---
Other then Fuzzy Brenda this had been the first person I encountered wearing my favorite mascot.  So it left a sour taste in my mouth...so to speak.  I hope that the feeling goes away soon because I wanted to do exactly what you do.  Wear it and help others.  I totally think the grind is worth it and will continue to go after the tokens.  I know this feeling will fade soon.  It just really pissed me off.
---
Strentgh, Charisma, the ammo perk, don't know about the rest and I really hope they don't change the 3 before they are live implemented.
---
Bloodied Junky, Rifle Commando &amp; heavy.
---
They never wronged you. They found loot. So you should be able to kill someone and take their loot just because they found in game loot that was dropped? It makes me laugh and I give them a thumbs up when I rarely drop a death bag.
---
Caravan from fallout NV
---
I‚Äôm afraid so
---
PLEASE. 
---
I am so tired of the pristinity.
---
I am getting Anti-Venom, Strength, Agility &amp; Luck (I see these as mandatory since they provide the best flexibility). The other 2 will depend on the new meta of weapons. I will most likely be melee so Cleave &amp; Exploding Palm.
---
I was trying to figure this out a while back and used this as reference:
---
|Health|Vanguard|Bolstering|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|0-10%|0|35|
---
|10-20%|0|32|
---
|20-30%|0|28|
---
|30-40%|0|24|
---
|40-50%|0|20|
---
|50-60%|7|16|
---
|60-70%|14|12|
---
|70-80%|21|8|
---
|80-90%|28|4|
---
|90-100%|35|0|
---
3 pieces of vanguard/2 bolstering will front load your resistance at high health a little more and there will be a resistance dip around 50% health and then it will climb a little as you get lower.
---
2 pieces of vanguard/3 bolstering provides a more even level of resistance throughout your health bar with it climbing more as you go lower.
---
Eff that guy!
---
love your patience !  wasted most of my life telling computers what to do, most often at the base metal, and cannot stand how every generation of computers - despite being so much faster - are poorly programmed (in terms of performance) and loaded with bloat to the point that they crawl, and seen to be rubbing the sleep out of their eyes every time i want to do something ... that's been my life up to retirement, and i don't see anything changing on my end
---
additional complication : being multi user means that a lag for every button press is baked in due to network connectivity.  on Fo4 i can tap the buttons and things happen, but on Fo76 I'm "tap.tap.tap.tap.tap - my dirty water is boiled !!!  horray !!!  tap.tap.tap.tap.tap ..."
---
plus, I've never had one walk after a second or 2
---
The whole Mr. Fuzzy thing is making me laugh because about a week ago I was exploring Camden Park for the first time since Wastelanders dropped (I just forgot about it) and while I'm doing some daiies and looting I can hear what sounds like whispering nearby. I look around but don't see anyone. While getting ready to do the dross toss, I see movement out of the corner of my eye and I can see someone in a Mr. Fuzzy costume  blended in perfectly with the scenery standing by a dumpster. I felt a chill and honestly gasped in surprise. I assumed it was just another player so I waved and walked closer to them. They didn't wave back and I saw the name as "Fuzzy Brenda" so I just assumed it was someone roleplaying or something...the surprise was on me when I found out she was an NPC lol
---
As for workshops and all, I just take them in private servers if I have to. I'm done dealing with unnecessary pvp when I'm just trying to get a bit of lead or whatever. Literally had some dude taunting me over mic saying that he would keep shooting at me just because I was playing a female character. People are weird.
---
This. Ten billion percent this.
---
Asbestos lined if you want to do ACP easily. It makes you invincible to the lava that falls to the floor.
---
People BUY from vendors?  Weird.  I thought they were just there to hand out the 1400 caps per day ration every comrade gets for working in the field.
---
oh, you can get screwed - that's for sure
---
if you have the 'healing factor' mutation it reduces all other chem effects even with class freak
---
just imagine him as i huge pinata !
---
So youve only seen footage and havnt joined the PTS?
---
It‚Äôs the school of the future man. They probably had iPads or something
---
üòÅ
---
Definitely the specials. I like to have a build that caters to everything but I've specced hard into a stealth commando build but I've collected a lot of great heavy weapons that I can't get the most out of
---
Bringing an excavator suit to lucky hole is the way to go. You do need a lot of acid but you'll get absolute tons of lead from just one trip.
---
great tip - thanks!  I'll try that today
---
I dunno, just seems a little out of character for the BoS this early in the timeline. It makes sense in the era of NV/FO4 because of the NCR-BOS War driving them towards more aggressive and hostile philosophy, and for the East Chapter, the fall of the Lyons' and the divide and reuniting with the Outcasts, and their isolationist moves in Fallout 2, but in these years before Fallout 2, the Brotherhood was a lot more chilled out under and after the leadership of Roger Maxson. At least, that was how I remembered them in Fallout 1.
---
Ahahah... That‚Äôs not where I thought this was going. I approve!
---
Except you do deal less damage after death as you lose stacked effects. If you run bloodied, you also lose rads and go above the 20% threshold. 
---
Dying during ACP also does kick people out often, me included. If it doesn't, you still need to wait for someone to maybe revive you, the go through the animations of death, then go through the timer, then go through the respawn (if it doesn't crash and refuse to let you respawn), then it will reload you outside of the battle so you have to go back and jump down the shaft again. 
---
No one goes out of their way to die during a fight. You obviously deal more damage while you're alive.
---
Hahahahaha... This is actually a good point. Pencils are a bit hard to grab sometimes since they are small items. I think that may be the reason why the game developers would omit an abundance of pencils throughout Watoga High.
---
Yea, I have the exact same legendary weapon twice. No problem.
---
that still wouldn't make up for all the possible cliping issues, bigger mags, longer barrels, some pistols have the options for wider barrels, sights, scopes. ect
---
Foryn Gilnith paid the price for standing up against this tyranny.
---
I keep Radshield, diluted radaway, and inert flux on favorites to manage mine.
---
Recipes, Plans are most common, some scrap actually holds it's value if you have abundance of caps, alcohol was common thing to buy when there were daily/weekly challenges with them, now not so much, ammo not so as it's overpriced per bullet, even if it's plasma/fusion cores.
---
If they lowered prices for ammo and food/drinks  it would have been a much better caps drain than tax on vending machines since not many players even place vending machines to have any reasonable effect on the sink amounts.
---
If you need plastic go to Morgantown high school now there has a bunch of plastic that's usually the first place I go to for plastic now you can't guarantee that there will always be a lot there but usually there is
---
Been using bows as well. LOVE the bow.
---
Would make most of the legendary effects useless to be honest.
---
I'm on console. Can't really join.
---
They way mutations work in 76 I wouldn't say magic has no place. ü§∑
---
Both the regular bow and the compound bow can be traded. The bow plans can be traded, the compound bow plans cannot be traded.
---
You are not wrong sir
---
Ooo tesla gaunlet would be sick
---
Dem legz go for miles.
---
I got a whole list, all three characters. Of course, I need 46 more levels before I have six slots on them all, but...
---
Legendary Perks for all my Characters, in order.
---
Plums:
---
- Retribution
---
- Hack and Slash
---
- What Rads?
---
- Taking One for the Team
---
- Legendary Agility
---
- Brawling Chemist OR Legendary Endurance
---
Vermin
---
- Follow Through
---
- Nuclear Proliferator
---
- Master Infiltrator
---
- Ammo Factory
---
- Far-Flung Fireworks
---
- Legendary Intelligence
---
Aryn
---
- Power Armor Reboot
---
- Power Sprinter
---
- Survival Shortcut
---
Blood Sacrifice is worthless, don‚Äôt @ me.
---
Maybe wait until you can try it before moaning about it then.
---
New Vagus wus gud game
---
Perfect, that answered my question. Thanks!!
---
You are mistaking the queens hitbox + 70% damage mitigation as explosive resistance, she doesn't have any.
---
They should also extend the no dropping loot during events, to at least 30 seconds after the event ends. Most of my bags that were jacked were dropped due to being a hair or health before an event gets completed and less then a second after I go down. 
---
 More often then not, the event ends and I only notice because the other players tags are now white, it takes the game at least 15 sec to pop up the event completed notification half the time. 
---
Jacking peoples bags in a non mutual pvp encounter to me is a sh!ty thing to do, but it happens so often that you basically have to learn to not take it to heart or pay for first so your not carrying around your last life savings worth of scrap bc your stash has been full since level 15. 
---
Being able to win back your scrap would be great. It might deter people with sticky fingers, or even make pvp more popular in a non nwz setting.
---
I'd pay caps for a cloaked dropped loot bag. Or just not drop junk; that'd work too. I really app3not losing junk during events, though (except when something plunks me juuuussst after the event ends).
---
Pro tip: *if you plan on dying, try storing your junk first*
---
Heads up about muzzle breaks and suppressors on shotguns specifically - they completely destroy the range. You‚Äôre likely better off using nothing in the muzzle slot.
---
As in, you deal reduced damage just because you are five feet away.
---
PC only
---
Play skyrim
---
Legendary Strength, Legendary Agility, and Ammo Factory are the "must have" ones.
---
Like you I run a stealth commando build, but after legendary perks come out I'll use them to hybridize my stealth commando with a PA heavy weapon build so I can actually do the Daily Ops since stealth will be freaking useless. Ammo factory will help a lot in keeping a primed LMG fed.
---
The other three I'm undecided on. Maybe What Rads, Master Infiltrator, and a choice between Follow Through or Taking One For The Team. I'm wondering if full SS + Rank 3 What Rads will allow you to survive in a nuke zone without needing PA, hazmat suit, or radaway spam.
---
Good shout. They're pretty bad
---
Quite honestly it was a day 1 ps4 build and I didn't know if dodgy would work while under fear effect. Additionally, I figured that I would get staggered eventually, and in that scenario I would rather rely on a stimpack rather than a luck perk until I can get my gun spinning again :)
---
LOL.  Fuzzy Brenda is pretty awesome! I had a friend tell me about her before I had been there so I was prepared.  But I can totally understand how that could happen.  I had to go through all her dialogue and love her responses to things.  She is totally dedicated.
---
I'm a pacifist player too.  I don't mind fighting the NPCs but not PVP.  The only reason I don't play on private servers more often is mainly no one to buy from my vendors...or for me to buy from.  And I do enjoy some of the events that are hard to do on your own like SBQ...especially when trying for max rewards (like keeping 3 things from breaking that are no where near each other).
---
Knew this one was coming! Yea I don't care to stop at stash. Again don't care about the junk it's an honor thing
---
Once it sold my Chinese stealth armor...quite some caps..
---
I‚Äôm okay with my post apocalypse leaning away from fantasy, but there are ways to do to it, a mad scientist obsessed with the comic creates the weapons while going crazy as the last survivor in his vault, and you have to ‚Äúact out‚Äù a scene to progress into the next room to finally meet him, picking up the gear along the way
---
I already made a post about this a while back. We need the fallout 3 reskins of laser weapons, plasma weapons, and the flamer.
---
It's MODUS pinching them to feed his RAM habit
---
Except I am avoiding death. Almost no one is intentionally trying to die during an event.
---
Not just the blocks... I think almost every toy has lead. (Not sure about bears but cars and most others that I‚Äôve noticed do have lead.) It‚Äôs one of my favorite silent jokes in the game.
---
Thought I read somewhere that it's going to be used to make a consumable that stops Earle's fear scream.
---
Crossed my mind, but you don't see any of that tech (voice, loads of computers) there, and unless they all used pipboys, which seem kind of exclusive to vaults, there would be a couple of pens and pencils around.
---
There's wooden desks all aligned. There's paint and paint brushes. 
---
Why are books there?
---
They stay.
---
guass weapon skins are a nuclear winter items
---
They do, they are both on separate cool downs, so if you are tanking an obscene number of enemies and they outpace your 40% stim then your 20% stim will kick in
---
IIRC there‚Äôs a card making machine on a desk in the apartments area which needs a password from one of the email terminals
---
Oh if that‚Äôs the case I have enough time, thank you
---
It won't be long before you can return the favor to low levels yourself
---
Not going to ever happen.
---
What do you think they were going in that school, learning?? Yeah right.
---
Scarier still this can happen with scrapping
---
Acid from tanagra town
---
nah they will say it's ur fault for dying n the loots u drop is no longer urs blah blah blah, it's wasteland when they looted ur junks but it's happy farm when comes to PVP u know
---
They are both scout armor.
---
Really wish all headgear did something more than cosmetic, makes no sense that Top Hat offers the same benefits as a Marine Combat Helmet and being able to add different headlamps would be fun
---
Hey can't blame a guy for trying
---
Nice, Thanks
---
You lose the rested/tuned, sure.
---
Adrenaline you can get back in seconds. If you want your rads back, carry a gamma gun.
---
Try not feeding. Your gameplay sucks and it shows.
---
Ammo factory and then the rest legendary special. I'm going mostly utility build, apart from adrenaline and ignore armor perks I just didn't see the point in wasting 18 perk slots on a small increase in damage to my automatic rifles and heavy guns when I did my own testing. If a player isn't bloodied they'll see even worse returns from damage perks which sucks.
---
Rewards are per-character
---
Yea that's how I usually die. Right after an event. Oh well
---
60 second respawn =/= avoiding death
---
If they're destroyed, then you don't have to waste time controlling them. üòâ
---
It's Watoga, city of the Future. The kids probably did all their work on computers.
---
The bos one seems to talk a little less thus far

Literally coming next patch after being in the files unchanged for a full year
---
Yea that's another idea. I'd still like to defend my honor
---
It‚Äôs taken a few days before, but not 3 weeks. Have you contacted Bethesda? (I say somewhat jokingly)
---
its called a puppet leader, i dont gotta do shit lol
---
"oh you're gonna stop collecting tech and leave me alone? and also give ME tech? yes. you are now in charge. excuse me while i cook steaks with a super mutant."
---
When I'm the one that's aggroing Earle, it is. When Earle hides in the rafters and is still able to fear and rain acid, it is.
---
Yeah. the problem has been around since the service started and they haven't given a single fuck. Just search it on this sub and you will see
---
And I'll pay it. I'll pay anything for anything.
---
Weird that‚Äôs not an option for me, just have ammo or Chems still
---
Would be nice as well, but i'd rather have that backpack
---
I dump everything I can rarely get above 500 in my stash .. OCD will do that :)
---
True, but none at all?
---
Not a lot of details I pvp and it could be anything we do know your build for one
---
My first 3 will probably be convenience/QoL cards: thinking Ammo Factory, What Rads (I don‚Äôt play bloodied), and Survival Shortcut. Next probably Follow Through, and the last two will be SPECIAL boosters.
---
I'm not looking to prove or disprove anything, that would be biased.  Only collect data.
---
my personal feeling is.. if someone dies the junk should just disappear unless it is in a direct PVP battle with another player.. so no traps or fall damage or any of that 
---
the only time a junk bag should drop is if killed by another players weapon or unarmed melee.. in all other cases junk disappears and nobody gets it..
---
Without consequences why would you avoid it?
---
They‚Äôll hang around and ‚Äúprotect‚Äù your camp a bit, and give you daily quests.
---
Call it Fallout humor. There may not be a single pencil at Watoga High but you will, however, find pencils at odd places.
---
That's great!  I'm planning to do it sometime during the sale though to get more roles.
---
BOS pussies will downvote you for pointing out that they're closet fascists
---
They sure as fuck not going toward bug fixes!
---
Yet there are wooden desks, paper books, paint brushes and paint. The closest and easiest thing they could take home so they weren't lying around the school would be pipboys, but those are usually related to vaults, not some punk teenagers.
---
Because when my things weren't locked, there would be zero left for me when I got there.  It took me a bit to figure out the locks were broken and needed to be replaced.   But yeah.   Once they were broken, people took everything.
---
I'm only level 100 so think I get three slots; I'll get What Rads &amp; Ammo Factory to start with. What Rads is more for to regen than the resistance. I'm also interested in Master Infiltrator just for the convenience of not having to swap cards, but will wait until the perk loadouts come as that might become easier.
---
The other one I'm looking at is Funky Duds, but I don't have a set of matched armour yet.
---
After than, probably just SPECIAL ones.
---
Do you think you die and respawn in the exact same spot in that exact same second with all your bonuses?
---
All food, drink, chem bonuses are gone. Perk bonuses depend on if the server decided to rubberband or not. Playing bloodied? Say goodbye to your rads.
---
Ahhh, the -DonQuixote--/murdomcsalt one/two punch.  Don sets him up, salt knocks him down.   Graceful and effortless - have you two worked together before?
---
If you want to join, just pm me your ign and I'll make a list.
---
Not on PC but the HM should trade well or at least 15k caps
---
Nope. You are the cause of your problems.
---
&gt; the fallout 76 community doesn‚Äôt allow
---
If the community had actually any influence on the game, there are some things higher up on our whishlist.
---
Try the Escape Artist perk
---
I am both for and against this. I know every item in a players camp that looks like a container is a stash. There is only one appearance curently for the scrap box. Makes it easier to run straight to it and drop my junk so i know they are less likely to be a trap camp.
---
Nice üëçüèª
---
Yeah?   Because mine went two days with zero for me when they were unlocked.   They literally couldn't keep up with the people emptying them.   As for doors:    
---
(1)  I want to see the front of the fireplace door.   Wildlife keeps opening it if it isn't locked.  
---
(2)  The upper part of my house is locked off.  If I'm sleeping, I don't want people up there.   If I'm working on my PA, I don't want people up there.   And I  don't want them around my collectron either.   Between thieves and weirdos, I tell you.....
---
You get your initial atoms and then the same day next month you get more.
---
It collects more than that. I've gotten aluminum. I've also seen reports of ballistic fiber.
---
Yup yup, also apparently you can get the responders fireman outfit from any event in the first and not just responders events. Someone got it from the moth man event.
---
I keep going back and forth on this, but I decided that I can wait for Perk Loadouts and not waste a legendary slot on master infiltrator
---
I would prefer that they fix the Tesla rifle first so it a) requires you to actually fucking aim, and b) fix kill chains because they make the game literally unplayable with lag.
---
T65 is the best now. T51b and X01 would be probably the second tier with T51b having better physical damage resistance and X01 having better energy and rad resistance. Excavator is still best for utility due to the inherent carry weight boost and boost to ore collection.
---
Toxic goo weighs to much, just a get a gamma gun and shoot at the ground for rads.
---
I do have it. It doesn't make a difference during active combat. Even worse when there are dozens of spawns everywhere.
---
May I ask what you paid for yours, and if you can still find inks refills for it? I always wanted one but the cost is a bit extreme for hobby purposes..
---
Oh, I thought bashing on a bloodied minigun had some sort of glitch. I never used a single shot from it though even though I have 10,000 rounds of 5mm for my junkie minigun.
---
T 65 has the best ballistic and energy, strangler heart has best rad resistance barely, but I did some testing and for most regular enemies the extra dr doesn't even matter.  Even for the glowing behemoth it only prevented 5 more damage than excavator.
---
So I say go for excavator because it essentially affords the same protection while giving you extra carry weight and Mining ability.
---
I will happily give you 3-4 worthless 3-star legendaries for bloodied minigun and will spend the rest of the day thinking about the good deal I've had.
---
WhPh in the game, on PC.
---
Take care, the minigun is magic.
---
Brahman milk removes 25 rads and no diese penalty.  I have 20-30 on me at all timea
---
Seeing that armor, I want the BoS Outcast PA skin as well
---
It does as long as the fire rate is at 200, you should keep that and use it.
---
I'm actavala
---
Two (that I know of) also can give you Lover‚Äôs Embrace.
---
Sounds like you are playing on steam.
---
Transactions on Beth's launcher and their website are instantaneously.
---
Hunters Longcoat and Black Cowboy Hat makes a badass gunslinger outfit. 
---
(It gets even better with a black Eyepatch.)
---
Dirty water carries chance of disease, use inert flux. It's has more hidration than water and has rads.
---
Go. Slower.
---
I figure they'll fix it. I'll stick to my junkie.
---
Again, heed my advice
---
All of which are valid points.  Conjecture on my part, but hear me out.  (with the utmost respect)
---
1. Where was the last speaker you saw in Watoga letting you know to visit the civic center, or making announcements?  They are still being made.  Perhaps they are designed to be hidden?
---
2. You would still have teachers in a high-tech environment to run classes just like with how virtual learning is going now.  Kids gotta sit at desks.
---
3. Bombs fell just before Halloween. Maybe the school was being painted.  Even robot custodians would need paint they wouldn't just laser it on.
---
4. You read the books, so you wouldn't need a pen and paper for that.
---
This bug is self-inflicted, don't hammer the sell button and you are fine.
---
Then puts delusional prices on them as if they were valuable or ‚Äúrare‚Äù.
---
It's true though.  Don't complain about your chickens before they hatch.
---
A lot of folks here are saying that schools have computing devices now. While that is *generally* true, there is still a considerable amount of writing. (We'll have the discussion about cursive writing no longer being taught in another thread.)
---
I'm not sure what schools you guys are attending, but our local schools don't have laptops for every child nor do they have computers in every classroom. Hell, most don't even have a computer lab. Maybe at the private/parochial level, but in public school, you're lucky to have a literal stone tablet to use. We are asked to send no less than 48 pencils to school with EVERY student to start the year. An average elementary school here has about 500 students, so that is at least 24,000 pencils alone in each school to start  year. I would expect to find at least 100 pencils intact following a nuclear detonation - not direct to the area, of course - given the amount of other detritus that remains in Fallout universe school buildings.
---
That said, Watoga is the "city of the future". So, it would make sense that they do not have pencils/pens/etc. What I *would* expect is the presence of significantly more circuitry materials. Instead, we can supply the wasteland with plastics for the coming millennium.
---
So you want to rework all receivers too now? Not going to happen.
---
Funky Duds for poison resistance, Sizzling Style (fire), maybe ammo factory, all the rest into SPECIAL
---
The spawns should never be an issue. Focus on clearing them first, and then shoot Earle when you literally can't target anything but him in VATS.
---
That perk is incredibly powerful in combat as long as you keep moving.
---
What is to decide? You still have the hardest hitting build and best off all you still have 15 points of SPECIAL in all but one category.
---
Foundation . It‚Äôs a guy in a vualttec hat+backpack standing around the corner from the bullion machine
---
I have had this occur selling items at a normal pace as well, though this is the only clip I had on hand.
---
Thanks for the input though.
---
Appreciate it
---
Watoga High has a bunch of paint though. Which is arguably better than pencils.
---
Got it. Thanks
---
I'd get that in a heartbeat
---
Some of them are highly entertaining to keep around if you hang out at your camp a lot. Some of them are horribly irritating. Plus daily quests, occasionally sent on a quest to get a free legendary weapon.
---
I'm not on right now but I'm more than happy to help you with it later, psn: sedge-dude
---
It's trash. It's to flex on food builds when they die constantly at ACP
---
This isn‚Äôt true, I purchased atoms just the other day and it took over 30 hours to get dumped into my account after a ticket.
---
Their servers were having issues and they‚Äôve even announced it on their support site and Twitter.
---
Infiltrator. Gives you the same as all 3 lockpick and hacker cards being equipped at level one. 6 cards you can scrap for perk coins and not have to swap in and out constantly
---
Sounds awesome
---
I‚Äôd just like to be able to find a legendary composite bow :(
---
That‚Äôs is your fault for going to someone‚Äôs camp with junk!!
---
I just started a berserkers build a few weeks ago and I love how hard it makes the game again I have multiple character and have tried almost every build and this is by far the most difficult one to do endgame stuff with and you never have to repair armor so saves you on some scrap.
---
Alright! I'll add you :)
---
it increases with each addiction up to 45% dmg increase at 9 addictions
---
I am a little confused with this, can someone explain how this is needed I am not trying to say it's not I'm just trying to see what I missing here so I can appreciate the work put in this effort. I myself don't have many plans still but I only am still actively in NEED of one and I know what one it is. But I am sure there are tons of plans that I am missing that this would tell me I am missing but I'm not "missing" them...
---
2 accounts 5 toons each, wife same. Never have we experienced this when we did not hammer "sell". So pardon me, but I don't believe you getting this bug at "normal pace".
---
Everytime this gets reported it is because of hammering sell.
---
Best may be relative.
---
Being what seems to be perpetually overencumbered (self-inflicted, I know), until I acquired WR armor with AP regen, the best for me is excavator w/ calibrated shocks and motion assist servos.
---
 Although it does not have the highest DR or RR, when I need PA, it keeps me reasonably well protected :)
---
Yeah that won‚Äôt happen.. think of all the events people die at!! You can take their junk but because of the event.. no pvp .. won‚Äôt happen
---
Never ever had a problem subscibed as soon as it was available
---
I usually nuke Morgantown myself
---
I like songs, don‚Äôt yoooooooou.
---
As long as there‚Äôs still a nuke zone over Earle‚Äôs mine you can nuke absolutely anywhere else and still trigger the colossal problem event.....just make sure that the first nuke hits Earle and everyone will be happy thereafter
---
Handmade can probably sell for 7k if you throw it in your vending machine. Bloodied Gatling is magic if you throw on the short barrel so I would throw it in for 6k.
---
Alright bro thanks :D
---
If I hear the Fasnacht Collectron sing once more I'm ending it all tbh
---
Sounds like your payment didn‚Äôt go through for the next month absolutely would not take 3 weeks
---
I cry
---
Wait until the ammo legendary perk comes out, you'll be set.  Also the gmg has higher damage, makes sense bullets should be harder to get.
---
No, it increases to 50%. 10% each addiction for up to 5 addictions.
---
Has it changed from the 50% that 5 addictions used to give?
---
I'll run full SPECIAL lego perks, with daily ops turning my stealth sniper into garbage I prefer the freedom to change builds rather than the tiny QoL that the other legendary perks offer (like extra ammo crafting or the hack/lockpick one)
---
You sure? My understanding was that it's +10% for every addiction, capping at 50%.
---
Are you offering to take Eldar Maxon to a strip club and get absolutely wasted with him?!
---
Cuz that sounds pretty rad tbh.
---
If  on pc you can get a mod that prevents you from selling or scrapping worn or favorited items. This has saved me a few times from this glitch.
---
While we're asking... I want an entire collection of things. Mask. Outfit. Weapon skin. I want my collection wearing sack skin please. Sack skin wall paper. Sack skin night light that projects oozing holes onto the wall
---
Not before a huge camp budget increase please, all these cool stuff to show and the budget isn't enough.
---
Just two filled magazine shelves cost the same as two or three turrets...
---
Complains before even playing it lolololol Jesus let me grab you a sippy cup!
---
What about seasons that have a game-changing result? Perhaps a season to develop mass-scale water filtration/purification like Fallout 3's Project Purity? Or a season to repair/restore the Morgantown Monorail - with a following season to repair/restore the railways? Or a season to help restore the major cities into population centers including areas for players to settle through property purchases (would follow same rules as CAMP placement). These make sense to me given the presence of Foundation's Settlers.
---
From a Raider perspective, what about a season to establish a network of raider strongholds in the wasteland from which you could initiate \*repeatable\* (think Destiny-repeatable) raids on settlements, factions, locations, etc? Or, a season to help the Blood Eagles gain a stronger presence in the wasteland complete with (again) repeatable raids post-season?
---
TL;DR: Seasons could/should result in new end-game/world content to live up to the "Rebuild America" concept.
---
Then, uh... standard it is for you, buddy. Sorry.
---
My 3* gatling named Rat-a-tat is my best buddy. Got it slightly after level 50 and a few hundred levels later, its still my go-to in any serious firefight. Surprisingly accurate at distance too.
---
**Plastic:** Kill Supermutants at West-Tek, collect laser rifles, equip Scrapper perk for 11 plastic each. Can easily clear close to 100 plastic if you're lucky, plus a good amount of steel and 5.56 ammo from assault rifles, not to mention a decent chunk of XP.
---
**Lead:** Collect acid from snallygasters/yao guai/cave crickets/Grafton monsters. Locations for those: Sunken Trainyard, Toxic Larry's, Tanagra Town, Dolly Sods, between Charleston Capitol building and Poseidon. Next, hit up Lucky Hole Mine, don Excavator armor, and collect all the ore. Smelt with Super Duper perk equipped for an easy 1,200ish lead.
---
Most likely, Strength and What Rads.
---
Melee, so strength is self evident.  What rads b/c (Amongst other reasons) the charred ghouls dish out a lot of it .
---
Its 10% per addiction up to 5. Pick 5 things to be addicted to that have minimal impact to your special stats. Once addicted, you don't have to keep taking the drugs, but if you do, you don't have the withdrawal effect (-special points).
---
oh yeah sorry mb, dont know what i got the other from
---
Just fill 80% of your health with rads
---
yeah mb, dont know where i got it from
---
Into the void forever
---
yeah u right, mb
---
You can have both. Set Ace to pick up BOS junk.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug.. it‚Äôs you‚Äôre other effects.. for example if you‚Äôre running junkies.
---
Dust in the wind
---
Thru hiker is your friend
---
Ah, so that guy does have a purpose then. Any idea about Crater?
---
You will lose the scrip but your bullion will be ok.
---
That mini gun is magic and insanely valuable
---
It was about $250 ish but didn‚Äôt have a power cable a brand name replacement was $119. The ribbons for it are still purchasable, but this model of printer is discontinued so it‚Äôs possible it eventually goes away. The cards and ribbon were another $100 or so.  This one still seems to print alright, but it‚Äôs hard to tell if you‚Äôre going to get a fully functional printer till you have it in front of you.
---
Duh, obviously not now, when they have the atoms bug raging.
---
OP's payment was 3 weeks ago...
---
They generally aren't. The past couple events they really have been rather bad with constant spawns. The new spawns would always appear in groups, sometimes a dozen spawning in the exact same area at the exact same time. Like the Line in the Sand bug.
---
The cautious answer would be to not accept the rewards until you have room in your bank.
---
I haven't felt the need to test it but I believe any excess is lost.
---
Try plasma grenade
---
All good. Didnt know if they maybe had changed it. Upvoting to cancel out the downs. üëç
---
You use them to buy things off other players and have to pay caps to fast travel
---
Agreed, the new grind will not be an item or a money source, it will be xp. Gotta grind up those levels for legendary perks. Lunchboxes will be my main gold trade going forward.
---
Preaching to the converted.
---
They said this was just an experiment with different rewards so I‚Äôd be willing to bet it won‚Äôt be part of future seasons from the response they‚Äôve already had from the announcement. Not saying you‚Äôre wrong for complaining, this is the feedback we need to give, but the way they worded it sounds like they‚Äôre open to suggestions for rewards.
---
If only they took this approach to other feedback.
---
1000 to be precise.
---
I think I'm going with ammo factory, strength and agility. I've been meaning to add a shotgun to my build to cripple assaultrons and scorchbeasts.
---
Thanks I never thought of that.
---
he means lore wise.
---
I don't use grenades during ACP. Explosives can cause crashes on console.
---
Seriously? that seems like it could be OP as hell
---
Yeah I'm saving up for that üòÖ btw I'm GMT +2 Denmark
---
I'll do it - but you have to let me kill you 19 times too - my only trophy left to get.
---
and some dead bodies on pikes and heads on spikes in tires. some Raider tarps and wall flags with the raider symbols on them. Graffiti would be nice. Its not hard to do. I made some for fo4. Its basically a poster. easy peasy. I'm sure someone with a degree could do it since I was able to do it without one.
---
Yeah, she's one of my favorites for sure! Definitely makes me a bit sad that so many of the NPCs in this game are stuck in the same location, alone. I forget a lot of their names but I think about the Responder in Flatwoods, Tiffany Brantley the aspiring Fire Breather and of course some long gone NPCs that I would've loved to have been able to meet like Abbie.
---
Literally the only reason I use my private server access is for workshops. If we ever get fully moddable private servers then of course I'm sure they'll get used way more often. But for the most part, I still enjoy running into other players on my adventures.
---
I‚Äôve been on the PTS and am a full on bloodied build. I loaded in at my camp and was immediately attacked by 6 level 75 floaters. I killed them all with little issue and haven‚Äôt had any problem with my build at all. I have been doing the daily ops by myself also and those are team missions.
---
Its the second best legendary behind bloodied right now. It will be affected by the nerf that's coming, but it will still be strong.
---
I run a junkies low health stealth commando and deal massive damage.
---
Ha!...  ü§£
---
Skins are so important for preventing accidental (or lag-based) sales to merchants.
---
Stop downvoting this guy because he‚Äôs 100% correct I also have not had this happen at normal pace
---
Absolutely, it wouldn't be fair otherwise. dydomp on psn if you want to add me
---
my last one oddly enough was the medic one, got platy last night. lmk if you need help w anything
---
I know. I figure they'll patch it eventually.
---
1,2,3,4, etc.  Instantly swap to anything you need.
---
Well if anyone wants berserker weapons I‚Äôve got plenty. Seems like I get a ton of them. Like a berserkers explosive mini gun
---
Maybe there is a lore reason? You would think all the robots would still be equipped to use pre war money as a form of payment over caps. I could totally be wrong and if anyone knows please correct me lol
---
It‚Äôs a semi-auto weapon so it‚Äôs not very effective. Each shot you need to click or tap anyways so 25 faster isn‚Äôt all that useful. Fully auto weapons that are already fast is where that perk really shines.
---
that is genuinely horrifying. what the hell is it? a player?
---
There was a promotion at the whitespring with nuka cola where you could use caps to buy things instead of money. This happened right before the bombs fell so they never went back to normal currency. A lot of people probably flocked to the white spring for supplies and shelter and adopted the cap currency they used.
---
Ah that explains it, thanks!
---
Thank you a lot!
---
Yes, I've tested it on Swan, magic effect indeed kicks in!
---
Well...fron what I understand about the caps lore (and the little look up I just did) it seems that the founding of the hub was mostly the reason that brought in caps in the West as a standard currency instead of clean water, however in the east its not really known when they transitioned to caps as currency...so in otherwords, I dunno.
---
I believe a lot has to do with the stores. For example, if you bought things through Bethesda, they get to keep all the money. If you buy on PS store, Sony gets some.
---
Sony would probably have an issue with there being a work around to their cut
---
I‚Äôve been working on a plan to make a jack of all trades.
---
Watch it get nerfed in the next patch.
---
WV has 6 casinos that I know of, including one at The Greenbriar. Seems like as easy jump to add one at The Whitespring. We'd need to ensure that all the duping/cap mills were locked down/coded out AND there was no way to "buy" or "sell" caps with real money. Also, probably need to keep all the games to be against the "house" only to accommodate global laws. This way, Bethesda could impose their "tax" to keep the economy "healthy". (OK, that actually made me laugh. Apologies) It's not like they are using all those scanner-locked rooms for anything.
---
But...we'd also need an in-game bank to hold our winnings as well as vendor earnings as we'll hit the ridiculous 30k cap, um, *cap* even quicker than we do now. Could leverage the same for Scrip and Bullion while we're at it.
---
(NOTE: I will stipulate there will always be gray markets for trading of online goods, but Bethesda is also severely negligent in policing those activities to curtail them even in the slightest.)
---
Just go back to him in about a week. Then wait a few days and do it again. Just keep doing it over and over again until you can rest comfortably in knowing you've cost them more material than they took from you.
---
Good. I'm super happy someone is using it.
---
There's also fire resistance.
---
Well... You‚Äôre forgetting that kids toys have lead in them. Likely from the lead paint.
---
There are area caps as well. That level 1-5 ghoul would be a 40 in an area such as the Forest.
---
I'd argue that you *are* going out of your way to die during a fight if you're running a 20% hp nerd rage build and the fight has multiple ways to knock 20% of your hp clean off without being able to stim it back up in time. Try out 30% hp for just serendipity and add revenant if you still find yourself dying a lot. Lastly, if you are still dying so much that you get 60 second death timers, then go even higher hp and swap serendipity for better criticals, bloody mess, or whatever you don't have that will help you out in the luck perks.
---
It's not on the pts, I don't see why they would.  It's still pretty hard to get a ton of acid.
---
They already nerfed lucky hole and put it on a timer, hopefully not again
---
If anything the game needs more cap sinks not less. Way to easy to make caps in this game. Beth is injecting millions of caps a day into the games economy through the vendor bots and their 1400 daily caps. If Beth doesn‚Äôt remove an equal amount we will get inflation and caps will be pretty useless. Caps already are useless for rare items.
---
And would explain why he is just wandering around the waste land. He‚Äôs going from vendor to vendor insulting people and taking our money. That devious devious bot!
---
One thing to consider is that 76 takes place before all of the other fallout games so it would conflict with some stuff. However, certain items and structures predate other fallout games(prewar etc) so why not!
---
I've been doing closer to 40%. Took serendipity off so I could use tormentor and cripple Earle. 
---
It doesn't happen often that I die enough to get 60 second timers, only a few events. But it's enough to put a heavy damper on any enjoyment I'd get from the event.
---
Bethesda could always do more community events that could have the same result like the current one for Atlus Observatory. Like the Rebuilding Morgantown and other cities idea could pretty fun
---
I‚Äôm responding to you saying there shouldn‚Äôt be any punishment...
---
[above](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/in1v4a/_/g44kpy8/?context=1)
---
It's fine, tbh.  I don't have a problem killing stuff at all.
---
Haha, now we're talkin
---
Yeah, but you know what Bethesda‚Äôs like. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they stealth changed it. And don‚Äôt forget, dupers will have a fuck ton of acid, and so will the people constantly taking acid workshops.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a robot inside the load screen building.
---
That guy can hold his breath for a very long time. I find him in the water under my pirate ship all the time.
---
its just fun, and very challenging
---
I have 3 vanguard, an auto-stim, and a life saving. Three pieces have poison resistance, one has fall damage reduction, and one has limb damage reduction. Then some weapon weight and other weight reductions and +1 stats.
---
The first time I did Collosal Problem I didn't know about the fall that required PA. Life Saving came to the rescue and no one had to revive my dumb ass.
---
Eugenie is my ‚ÄúGhirl.‚Äù
---
Legacy weapons aren't an issue.  It's not fair to take away something that someone has worked hard to get just because it's "too strong."  Also they can kill you really easily, so they aren't even all that good.
---
&gt; Since you are on PC, you may want to install the mod that adds marks on your HP bar to tell you 20% 40% 60% 80%.
---
Analog Method:
---
I put a tiny sliver of scotch tape on my monitor to mark the health bar. Works surprisingly well. Clear enough that I don't notice it when I'm not playing, but shows up well in game when the red of the radiation indicator reaches it.
---
The BoS have rarely been the good guys.
---
I've had it collect rad away, stimpacks, and assorted scrap so far
---
Its because of a promotion inside the Whitespring Resort for the newly released Nuka-Cola Quantum.
---
So the Nuka-Cola Company is at fault here.

1. Do not rely on events to farm gear. Too many factors. You‚Äôre better off just farming legendaries themselves. Events are good for other stuff.
---
2. One Wasteland should be coming soon, which will allow you to be more on par with others and allow you to ‚Äúhang‚Äù better
---
yeah, i guess i'm asking to make the loop interruptible
---
I know today and last night on Xbox every event I went to no one was sharing legendaries. It was pissing me off. I will bash them and wave ppl over but once they start killing two out of three in uranium fever I will one shot that bitch ass soon as I see him. I don‚Äôt get why ppl do this. I can‚Äôt stand when high levels goto low level events. I complete ignore them. Saw a level 500 at tea time. Like for what?
---
If you are closer to 40%, then good! I hover around 35-40% just for this fight myself. May I recommend asbestos chest mod, born survivor 1 (auto stims at 20% hp), and blocker 3 if you got the strength to spare? I play melee and I am constantly in Earl's face. I only waste like 5-10 stimpaks a run (with randoms) after taking into account wendigo loot at the end. Only time I die is by getting feared into a drill.
---
They are explosive by nature. If you put on Demolition Expert, the damage does go up. Mine has a base damage somewhere around 491 or something. With that perk it goes up to somewhere in the 700's. I tested that on the first weapon I rolled, and it works for all Gauss weapons. So the actual roll wasn't a TSE, but a 2 shot something or other. Sorry for the confusion.
---
They removed the requirement for the set to be sturdy or heavy. It just has to be a set of combat or leather with mixed heavy or sturdy now. So mixed urban armor should also work as a set.
---
wait wait wait - are you suggesting that the fine game designers at Bethesda are not capable of crafting ... sorry, Fo76 just crashed (*again*).  i gotta go
---
I agree... The Beer Hat should automaticly top you off when alcohol wears off.
---
Hopefully they never fix the phantom budget.
---
Know for sure - Legendary Perception, Legendary Agility, What Rads? (Vampire's FTW)
---
Maybe - Legendary Endurance, Master Infiltrator, Ammo factory (i'm a heavy gunner, and i never feel comfortable with less then 10K ammo)
---
No - Any of those "explode on death" perks, they are not worth it IMO
---
Already confirmed to be happening in update 22/23
---
good point !  a also hate having to fight my way past NPCs and robots  clip therough 'em all, i say !
---
We gotta push the BoS posse back!
---
Members.
---
Then give me the pleasure of fucking you with my laser rifle and T-60 power armor!
---
Quad double barrels are pretty fun
---
Let me tell you, taxation with representation isn't that great either.
---
Dare I say, taxation is theft.
---
use it with plastic to make Bulk scrap. then sell it to an npc vendor.
---
you'll free up space AND make money.
---
Datamined info shows quests or dailies that require nukashine.
---
I asked a similar question not long ago. You can use it to craft some things, even just camp items, to get some XP, but unfortunately there isn‚Äôt a good scrap ‚Äúsink‚Äù in the game for many of them.
---
Except in Fallout universe the computer tech is significantly behind what our timeline has because FO timeline focused on atomic tech while ours focused on microprocessors. If you want proof of that, just look and see how much memory your pipboy has when it boots up in the FO4 tutorial. That thing has only about 25k memory if I recall correctly, but the battery will last forever.
---
Punctuation is your friend.
---
(misplaced reply)
---
reading my post indicates that is not always sn option, nor is an elegant solution
---
Not in this country! You spend, the government takes it all! I‚Äôm pretty sure most of our taxes aren‚Äôt even legal.
---
i have to wonder, do the tesla users know they are the cause and being jerks intentionally? or do they just think that the game constantly lagging during events like that isn't their fault?
---
I‚Äôll fight you but you need to earn your kills:)
---
Actual lead being used in schools would explain a lot about the Fallout universe though.
---
Chinese is a suit so it‚Äôs great for nukezones but offers little else in the way of bonuses. SS is going to take a long time to get a decent set together.
---
Yup. I use a furious super sledge. Those perks into str will boost my dmg *and* carry weight(not that i really need the weight*
---
You can bulk a lot of that that you listed and sell it at train stations. Cloth and leather are part of a lot of crafting, cloth turns into gunpowder, and leather is part of a lot of armor crafting/repairs. Bone, I've actually found myself out of it when I'm crafting the SS armor pieces - which it's part of the crafting for some dumb reason. 
---
Those fiberglass spools will actually sell to vendors as is. You really shouldn't need any more than 40-50 of any of those junk items in your stash, unless you're crafting a whole lot of something specific that requires them regularly.
---
The synths.
---
I have ‚Äúheard‚Äù that the user might not know or see, but it screws the event for everyone else.
---
But then again why would he need caps?
---
Merch is common slang for merchandise and predates the modern internet and anyone ‚ÄúRaised on the internet‚Äù by at least a decade. It was already in wide usage by the 1980s. Often Merch gets used to refer to branded promotional type items, hence its usage here referring to promotional Nuka Cola and Vault-tec items. 
---
The first word in your reply is a contraction so maybe you shouldn‚Äôt use it when trying to belittle someone for using a shortened slang term instead of ‚Äúwhole words like an adult‚Äù
---
Maybe if you want to make yourself feel superior to others by trying to sound smart you should stick to punching down in the Walmart subreddits.
---
Oh?üò≥
---
there is a lore reason, others have explained it in comments.
---
while the real reason is "it's Fallout, so Caps", Bethesda at least took the effort to add lore so it makes sense. is it forced? yes. but there is a lore reason at least.
---
Rifleman and gunslinger builds need a buff. They were struggling before but this update makes it worse
---
\&gt;For the Enclave
---
\&gt;Oh and for Grahms sake
---
Pick one.
---
Hey congrats on the plat! I still don't have the medic one but maybe soon
---
The pipe... Is life!
---
Chinese stealth suit is a Hazmat suit with DR, ER and Stealth bonus. No jetpacks or any mods.
---
SS is the best non-PA in the game, can be legendary, but you gotta roll the parts. only non-PA armor that can have Jetpack
---
I think the idea of sharing legendaries is silly, but then again I come from games like Everquest and World of Warcraft where enemies don‚Äôt drop an item for every player.  So many people may have a similar mindset.
---
It would probably be better for the game as a whole if there were less legendary drops anyways...
---
As for the high levels, if the event is marked as public, people will go for the rewards of the event. Some are worth doing at any level, such as feed the people. I actually can‚Äôt think of many low level events that exist that don‚Äôt have rewards that have value at any level. 
---
People may also be trying to finish the legendary run. I know when i was doing my events, Manhunt was a favorite since i could do it in 5 minutes tops
---
Ive had 20% phantom budget since update 19 and ive never done the ammo factory exploit. Itd be nice to get that budget back :/
---
Though I would like to know if Arktos put it here, or if it was something else.
---
Have Blocker which is great for the SBQ fights but not so great for Earle. 
---
Until I can get a good set of armor, I've been running around in a stealthsuit. 
---
I had BS but I replaced it with Adrenaline.
---
Becket and Sofia, the two with actual queatlines, can be romanced. if so, the Well Rested perk becomes Lover's embrace. same thing but lasts 3 hours instead of one.
---
btw, if you dont romance them but keep them in your camp, the bonus lasts two hours. forget what that version is called.
---
This is why I always walk around a camp with light footed on and T-60 power armor with emergency protocols.
---
Thats awesome that your son thought of that, but please don't drop half the plastics in the cafeteria for pencils, I depend on that on a weekly basis for shotgun üî´ shells.
---
 The trick with Watoga High school is to do the monster mash event to collect candy üç¨ in return you can use the terminal to trade in your candy for pencils and pens üñä 
---
Plastic  in my opinion is one of the more pressing items to grind for because it's  in smaller  amounts  throughout  the  wasteland. Also Morgantown high school üè´ has quite a bit of plastic as well. If you want pencils ‚úè go to  sugar groove. 
---
In addition for lead, each nuclear silo has a gym scrap the weights üí™ and kill all the robots ü§ñ aswell there is tons of plastic. Lots of goodies in there, the only thing to worry about is someone thinking your taking to long, and they may jump in a steal your launch, or cause multiple spawns of robots  ü§ñ 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best üëç
---
Well if that's true it can effect people who didn't use the ammo factory blueprint I certainly hope it's fixed in that regard. How did you get hit with the bug?
---
I‚Äôm level 430 and I go there for treasury notes.
---
Flushed down the drain
---
They are coming with instanced camps so NOT update 22
---
For me its Chinese stealth and ss and excavator PA stealth for most kills ss for free jetpack and carry weight/survivability and if i need more oomph/tankyness i hop in my power armor
---
Like a rocket burning fuel so fast..
---
This process would tell you all the plans that you have not learnt. You would visit the mule and take a screenshot of all plans that do not say "known"

Friend-Zoned Abyss
---
Yeah well being the game is like this I think we all should work together for rewards. I mean I scope the event if they keep one shotting the stuff then I will too. But if they wave I will do the same
---
You aren't supposed to lose junk in events anyways that's a bug I think.
---
if i recall this was the initial reason fortnite on ps4 couldnt transfer accounts to other platforms, unlike everything else. this was before crossplay was added.
---
its also the reason fortnite and apple are in a legal battle right now, so its still an issue.
---
Im not sure. I had a friend build me very compact camp and when I moved I got a 20% phantoms budget. I scrapped the camp blueprint, all stored items and even server hopped a bunch but still at 20%
---
They all go directly to Ward. He needs them to buy more unnecessary medical equipment and explosives, which he then bribes guards to "lose" near raider camps so that he can pay players to go assassinate them to feed his insatiable bloodlust. Then once all the random raiders and blood eagles are dead and he can blackmail all the guards who lost "vital equipment" into taking over Foundation and Crater so he can become the Godking of all Appalachia.
---
***I TOLD you all this would happen.***
---
First, they send a broadcast that‚Äôs barely decipherable. Then, some random guy *who isn‚Äôt even affiliated with them* sets up shop at a place that he ASSUMES is going to be their base of operations (which he gathered from the aforementioned impossible-to-decipher radio broadcast). Now affiliated with the organization, he‚Äôs all like ‚ÄúLol can I have some uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cork?‚Äù And somehow, somewhere, he GETS THE CORK. And he doesn‚Äôt just get cork. He gets so, so much more. Concrete. Steel. And this isn‚Äôt even the end of it.
---
And if they‚Äôre willing to sacrifice their public image so much by just requesting these ridiculous amounts of materials, imagine what they‚Äôre willing to take WITHOUT asking. Just think about it. They‚Äôve got all these materials, all of the necessary things to start a base of operations in Appalachia... except for one thing.
---
Money.
---
And they‚Äôre not going to ask for money, either. They know that you won‚Äôt give it to them.
---
So they take it.
---
They have agents everywhere. Behind every tree, in every bush, casually loitering around every Stash Box and Decontamination Arch. And when they see somebody spending those sweet sweet caps at a vending machine, in the blink of an eye they snatch as much as they can from the hands of the customer just as they‚Äôre inserting the caps into the machine. This is not taxation, this is highway robbery.
---
And you can‚Äôt do anything.
---
This is what the Brotherhood of Steel stands for, Appalachia. Do you really want to stand with them?
---
# #Brotherhoodofsteelmorelikebrotherhoodofcork
---
# #Pleasejointheenclaveourbunkerissolonely
---
All valid, except I personally can't buy the whole city of the future = no more writing by hand that keeps being brought up. They're not that distant from the rest of Appalachia or most of the people who worked or shopped there on a regular basis.
---
City of the future or not, those kids will still need to learn how to write old school so they can still function with the rest of their communities, or the rest of the state, country or world for that matter.
---
Write a letter to the rest of their extended family who don't live where they do and might not have a computer to receive messages digitally?
---
That's like saying that because we have calculators on almost every device today in the real world, we shouldn't learn how to count or do basic mathematics.
---
Lastly, a good portion of my family are teachers, father's retired. I didn't take the school bus but went with him and the siblings there and back in the car. That also meant us being stuck sitting around in the school for an hour or more after class waiting for staff meetings to finish. That gave me plenty of time to notice how many pens and pencils were everywhere. From dropped or lost along the walls, to left on desks, to the packs of them in all the teachers desks, not to mention several I and others would have left in our desks.
---
There should be at least one in Watoga High, even if it was just on display like a relic.
---
What rads, funky duds, endurance (throwing Adamantium Skeleton on so my Gauss shotgun stop triggering Enforcer ), then maybe strength, agility, and luck in time. (also Master Infiltrator until i ready to use the last slot for one of the others.)
---
Right, I understand the how, but not the reason of how it helps people, or what people use to for to help with in game terms now. Like it wouldn't help me right now because I know what I need to Know right now as in what I am missing and not missing but the ones I am not missing that I don't care that I am missing at least for the moment.
---
wow, can't believe i've only just started using this then, been using a explosive handmade at full health for ages ahah. what addictions due you use that give little effect?
---
Not waisting perk coins or using hacking/lockpicking. Neither are worth it. I'd rather use my coins towards DPS perks/slots
---
just take the damn upvote
---
This was my least favorite part about new Vegas. It was annoying as fuck trying to remember what type of ammo worked best against various enemies and frantically changing out ammo in the middle of combat.
---
There could be a chance some people don't get this message because they aren't on Reddit?
---
Tbh, that's the best idea I've gotten.

You think that‚Äôs bad?
---
Killed a Legendary Noxious Sheepsquatch earlier today, couldn‚Äôt loot it because it glitched through the terrain...üòû
---
Since this isn't an option in the game just pay attention to who it is, look for their camp on the map and then go blow up as much stuff as you can with explosive bait. Go for the decon shower and crops first. If they don't have the crops in their inventory and are too stupid to just scrap one they wont be able to do the repair all option. Then blow up their camp again every single time you happen to be on the same world with them. Scorched Earth isn't just an event to kill the queen!
---
Yeah, but you came and made a whole post about it bro. Clearly the junk wasn't that important to stash. I get it, but this kind of change won't be anywhere on the horizon, ever. Have you seen PvP in this game? Picked the wrong game for honor. üôäüôâüôà
---
you can get the small backpack by going to Morgan town airport and taking the plan for it from the Overseer's Cache. also. the pictures of animals do not have to be breathing. kill them and then snap a pic of their mangled body
---
Cheers dude
---
there is a quest free smaller capacity backpack in the morgantown airport
---
I don't think so, as it is a pretty basic item and also in Fallout 4, my bet is still that it's going to be free or in the legendary run at some point.
---
https://youtu.be/zj-NEW9Ptbs theres this one too
---
really, do you have a source maybe?
---
U can do 3 tadpole quests theres a great  youtube video, I did archery, athletics and swimmer. Was a bit long but not hard. Only revive in water was a bit longer but just ask on this reddit. Good luck. I used this guys videos. https://www.youtube.com/c/MyUsualMe

Just in case you don‚Äôt know, you can get the small backpack plan from the overseers cache at Morgantown airport. I know it‚Äôs not the full backpack but I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre aware of it or not

There's a few cans, but I also consider weight, as I try and grab a lot of different varieties of junk while looting. 1 wood and 1 lead for the weight of, well nothing or close to nothing (some sites say they have no weight, like propaganda posters, I'll need to check in Game to confirm)
---
So I try and avoid weights or heavy items I might not be able to breakdown right away.
---
I know plenty of places to get lead. I just figured Watoga High would have been a better yield for lead as it was for plastics &amp; other junk all in one run.
---

I grew up in Charleston, can confirm many sightings of this cryptid in the current times

I did my first US government AirDrop and was waiting at the location by the wayward and it never showed up. Left the server join again still nothing. I‚Äôm not super upset but I wanted to try it out.
---
That sounds about right. Welcome to your new grind. The ultimate goal is a set of unyielding with ap refresh and whatever you like for 3rd star. You will spend thousands upon thousands of scrip and junk for the final set.

All junk has *some* use, but some of it less, of course. [Here is a resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) that can help you decide what to keep and what to sell.
---
It feels like you‚Äôre on a hamster wheel. No matter how much you level up or get better gear, the enemies magically match you. 
---
Releasing One wasteland as it stands is tedium. I won‚Äôt even start on the uselessness of certain builds like rifleman and gunslinger.
---
I know we had the paintings of the targets, but I mean like the ones from the shooting ranges, or perhaps ones that could go side to side on a floor or ceiling mounted conveyor. Could even have them flip up/down for a set amount of time after being shot.
---
I know, it requires a hard time grinding, but there are 3 easy challenges (archery, athletic and swimmer... that one you need to ask for help) and can be done in maybe 2-3 hours.
---
Now, Possums badges, those are hell. :/
---
I‚Äôm pretty that‚Äôs a power armor glitch correct if I‚Äôm wrong but that‚Äôs what I think

---
I personally am addicted to alcohol, buffout, daytripper, mentats, and overdrive. I wanted the least impact to perception and agility. I offset this by wearing a full set of unyielding gear and staying at low health. Combined with nerd rage, and adrenal reaction mutation and my junkies explosive handmade.
---
Can you post your build? I'm interested in making a shotty/rifle build but I can't figure out how to make it work.
---
Okay. Thanks!
---
That's just being a poor sport imo üòÇ
---
Riding shotgun. Guaranteed 3star with potentially more. Plus you get treasury bonds and most importantly pepperoni rolls. You also don‚Äôt have to wait for the event to spawn. You can initiate it and if it‚Äôs on cool down hop server and try again.
---
Yea that's a whole different post man...lol
---
Yes. As far as I recall, it's a glitch when a player fast travels or logs out.... I think a flakey log out (crash) and their body is left on the server bugged out.
---
I imagine someone knows more about this than I. But you can't interact, kill or harm, and they're just stuck there.
---
This player in particular has a mask on that I think was in the atom shop a while back. As is the outfit.
---
I only skipped around four or five days (then when I was at level 98, I got lazy and took like five days to complete) but all I really did were the challenges. I hardly grinded the repearable xp
---
Blocker is good for not getting one shot by wendigos while you are fighting Earl, but if that's not a problem you then no need.
---
Not much to do until you get a good set of unyielding armor and replace that stealthsuit.
---
With +10 agi from unyielding (wouldn't get +15 at 40% hp) and high agility you can drop sneak 3 and still be mostly cautious. Although I do have one better sneaking piece (and 14 agi, so results may vary). I run dodgy 3, actionboy 3, escape artist 1, born survivor 1, ninja 3, and adrenaline 3 for this fight.
---
I'd even go as far as to say born survivor 1 would improve your damage over the course of the fight over adrenaline if you die enough times that the dps loss from death timers overtakes the dps gain from adrenaline.
---
Fifth element?
---
Yea leaving the server hosed. It eventually shows up...after like 10 long minutes...
---
that's my biggest gripe, although i play on console so i imagine it's probably not as bad on PC. i've come across multiple camps with 20+ weapons only to find that none are legendary
---
Based on when you signed up
---
The reasoning caps are a viable currency on the west coast is the same on the east coast.  Limited supply, easily recognizable, very portable, and extremely difficult to counterfeit.
---
You should have, but there's been something wrong with the dispersal of Atoms for the last couple days which they are "investigating."  You should probably open a support ticket just to make sure you're on the radar.
---
True!
---
All good my man. Happy hunting.
---
Because you likely got a shit ton of xp. People that don‚Äôt have time to get a ton of xp like myself just do the challenges. I missed around 5 days throughout, and at the end I got lazy, so level 99 and 100 took like 5 days (I wasn‚Äôt playing much) but I finished early this week. It wasn‚Äôt hard, but as life goes, I‚Äôd like to know that I won‚Äôt HAVE to play every day
---
The problem with legacy weapons is that they've been duped so much you see them every day. Bethesda should have removed the duped ones as soon as they started to appear, but didn't even ban the dupers.
---
What's the point of them being "legacy" if more copies of it keep popping up every couple patches.
---
Ah ok I posted before the other ones so I didn‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôll go and read thank you!
---
I started the subscription on July 20th, I still haven't gotten anything for August
---
Nah, they should have thought about the possibility of someone extremely vindictive owning the bag of garbage they picked up. Being a poor sport is taking it and doing a taunt in the first place.
---
But I made the payment all at once in July? And on my account the payment went through
---
I suggest the easier alternative of neither reviving or giving a fuck.
---
Follow Through because I want to kill everything in 2 shots after patch 22 lol
---
Does steam have the same problems?
---
Vendors eat caps once in a while, but in the vast majority of cases they just shit out 1400 new caps every day. The weekly gold is the only other decent cap sink in the game right now, and it's still not enough. Honestly, nothing will be enough until bethesda actually removes all the duped gifts and/or bans the people with mules full of duped shit, but we know neither of that is going to happen so all the cap sinks are ultimately just wet band-aids
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Craft Armor and weapons and scrap them to learn mods.
---
Not entirely sure. The player doesn't move, you can't shot or harm or otherwise interact with them. Just a name over head and them all stretched out like this.
---
Ive seen a lot of these players just standing around fissure sites, but usually just in their underwear. Long after any SB/SBQs have been killed
---
I think it relates to some log out of the server, maybe a crash?
---
I have every variant of the 3 üåü TSE Dbl.shot guns and each are a very sweet ride, especially in vats. Mind you I also have a quad Dbl in my stash, I will have to break her in I guess, thanks for the share.

Don't talk about the chicken! It will hear us! It will come for us!!!
---
Hey Bethesda, stop sucking.
---
ok, ya I was hoping there was something like steel which you can use for spikes which you can then turn into any ammo. Its at least something in my opinion. Gets rid of it in my bags, I get some xp, and I get to store it for ammo at a later date which is nice.
---
Best place for low levels is hiding in a bathroom stall right near the entrance.
---
Yea but nothing you can do so, here's my idea to change that. Lots of disagreement already, probably won't happen, but just seems so lame. At least taking the junk would be a question of..."Do I think I'll get away with it?"
---
Name is long with the word fuzzy nuts in it. I took screenshots and reported. The camp is in the road by the starting area farm. Large building with o e door, also seen him by the ski resort and train station. This one is the glowing star wallpaper on the outside with glitched trees making a wall. Has a marquee arrow light pointing to a chair that glitches you through a wall to your death.
---
Douche
---
Just get the Small Backpack. It can take *any* mod. Always has been able to, ever since it was first implemented. But up until Wastelanders, the mods were super expensive to trade for and you could only get yourself some Possum Badges by getting to the point of already being able to craft the Large Backpack anyway. Pretty sure the ability to apply the Chemist's/Grocer's mods to the Small Backpack was an oversight rather than a decision, but it is one that they know they will never be able to backtrack on.

- Small Backpacks: A new type of Backpack, the ‚ÄúSmall Backpack‚Äù has been added in an effort to help more players acquire a Backpack earlier on during their Appalachian adventures.  
---
- A Plan to craft a Small Backpack can be found inside the Overseer‚Äôs Cache inside the Morgantown Airport Terminal. This Plan cannot be traded, sold, or dropped.  
---
- Small Backpacks have 50% of the carry capacity provided by a standard Backpack.  
---
- Small Backpacks can be equipped with all the same Mods as a standard Backpack.  
---
- Players can still learn to craft Standard Backpacks by completing Pioneer Scout Quests.
---

It kinda makes the whole Scouts questline redundant, doesnt it? With the Chemist's mod on my Large Backpack, it saves me over 1000lbs. With the same mod on a Small Backpack, it'll still save me over 975lbs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Honestly, the last thing this game needs (apart from **more** bugs) is to start making the *functional* content redundant..
---
knowitalls, complainers and cheaters?
---
Nuclear winter counts for this
---
It doesn‚Äôt produce the recipe. It produces cave fungus, of which it is the only source in the game, and the first time you pick up a cave fungus you learn the recipe for cave fungus soup. Go to a cook station and see if you already learned it and didn‚Äôt notice.
---
Ya, I know you can bulk things but im a horder and get up to hundreds of each of these pretty quickly. Was hoping I could save my plastic which I find useful and find something that I could mass produce with the junk that isnt as hard to come by and then either sell it or do whatever needed with it afterwards. Similar with how steel is now able to be used.
---
Replace every consumable reward (except lunchboxes) by Nuka-Cola Quantum. Problem solved.
---
Of course they'll get away with it, there's literally no possibility of any repercussion unless you get creative. You could also nuke their camp but that's about it.
---
Revive the heavy hitters, screw the rest.
---
Good luck!
---
Thanks so much!
---
Definitely picking up special stats to round out my jack of all trades master of all...as well
---
Seeing as how Radiation is my worst enemy, but I'm constantly given Rad-away and Rad-x, I'll be going for that coin first.
---
Just nuke üí• there camp, problem solved. And sit there and laugh at them well they are rebuilding. ü§≠üëäüëäüëä
---
Right now that's true I'm saying they implement this idea it would be a bit more interesting. Heck I might try it....
---
Waste of nuke...no legendary rolls lol. Also hell just logout and back in to continue dancing
---
That's just becky she was really weird back in the vault
---
Yeah... this lol
---
Question: How is it easier to revive low level players if they are scattered around the instanced area? I'll wait...
---
Well, in that topic the author provided two separate (!) links, one for the season rewards (which are all accurate btw), and another link, which then is obviously for the atomic shop. 
---
I don't see how you can end up asking why the power armor display is not among the season rewards. I am waiting for it as long and as eagerly as you, but I always expected it to be a shop item.
---
Maybe I am stupid and didn't understand or got something confused, but I understood "ATX" as "atomics" = Atomic store.
---
Many people like to collect all the plans in the game. There are over 1000 so it is difficult to keep track unless you tick them off manually. This makes it easy to get en exhaustive list
---
thats the grafton karen, not to be mistaken for a florida karen
---
Like if I build my camp. I'll move it how ever many times but upon closing the game and coming back to it. It usually wont let me place my camp even if I had already moved it before with out an issue.
---
It's the overseer. How else can she afford to live in such a nice house?
---
This game is such a relief when playing gta online before lol.
---
Loot bag thief confirmed.
---
**Just FYI, you can take pictures of the creatures when they are DEAD!** It still counts for the challenge AND its less killy! We found out because the LAST animal we had to take a pic of was killed by another player, we got frustrated and took a pic anyway....and the challenge completed. This has since been done on several new characters!
---
If it actually does drop through the terrain you're SOL, but someone have me a good tip if you're having trouble finding the body of an enemy to loot: get out your prosnap camera and point it around. When the enemy is in the frame,  you'll see it labeled. That can at least narrow it down.
---
After watching Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs, I think they modeled that voice after Chilton
---
Same problem here, but they sure as heck billed me..
---
&gt; Yea I don't care to stop at stash.
---
Then the junk loss is on you, completely.
---
This would be accurate if the game had perma death. Otherwise it‚Äôs a pretty dumb statement.
---
Very few of them appeal to me, honestly.
---
The tax is likely going into bethes- I mean, "Brotherhood" pockets in exchange for not killing us on their return.
---
The Commie one‚Äôs Proletariat is also decent because it gives food and medical supplies, though it‚Äôs mostly just Propaganda.
---
Just a reminder that with such a short range weapon like this, explosive can be really tough. Staggering yourself is the hard part; you can mitigate the damage itself with fireproof. I usually go with my Q2525 over my TSE for that reason.
---
I killed the three star sentrybot in vault 79 and I got a weightless wood armor (weightless was its only perk)
---
Stand right on a drill
---
Pretty devious!
---
Don't know or care. I specifically said not to.
---
The best you'd be able to use in PA is a crossbow. They max lvl at 45, and have mostly the same numbers. Dmg and range is lower in comparison to a bow though. My lvl 50 stalkers compound with explosive arrows has a base dmg of 228 while my furious crossbow has a damage of 145-160 with the same arrow mod.
---
I'm level 444 and I have yet to see a Yao Guai Ghoul or a Chameleon Deathclaw! This is awesome!!
---
LOL.  I like the way you think.
---
LOW level players probably shouldnt be at the high level endgame event....
---
been happening for months. on the page screen where you select private you change the join settings try changing that
---
im ok with losing carried junk permanently as a consequence for death [in PVE]
---
makes staying alive more vital if the player insists on carrying junk into combat
---
Ok ty I‚Äôll give it a go
---
I've still yet to see a living chameleon deathclaw either. I've even seen a live owlet, but that deathclaw keeps eluding me.
---
Troubleshooting question: is it actually set to allow friends? There‚Äôs an option to allow friends/private only on the selection screen
---
My sub renewed today and i got my atoms this morning. I'm on Xbox. They have been having issues the last couple of days though (see the posts like "I have 394737733 atoms, what happened?") so I was expecting them to be delayed.
---
lmao no "fixing" is not a thing bethesda is inclined to do.
---
Bulk your plastic and sell it, people crafting SS Armor would probably love you for it. It's one of the things that I wind up needing. Hm, glass, plastic and rubber, go find the [Marine Tactical Helmet](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Marine_Tactical_Helmet) you can make those and sell them to train stations or in your vendors. 
---
You can use your plastic for crafting fusion cells, too.
---
 [Here's an exhaustive list of all the stuff that uses plastic.](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_crafting_recipes_that_use_plastic). Craft away.
---
There some out there and some that like to cheat. I was in valley galleria looked for vacuum tubes and this guy comes up out of nowhere, not even on the map and kills me without me being able to do something about it. When I went back to find him and get even I couldn‚Äôt kill him. I was higher level then him with the shotgun that does double damage at full health and even that didn‚Äôt even touch him. I blocked him and continued playing
---
Wow wow wow, what if I want those 1* rolling pins?
---
Yep! Saw and accidentally killed the owlet before I could take a pic....I VATS'd too fast :(
---
because some people like having their balls stomped by an NPC assaultron while trying to do so so damage.
---
And reward you 8(?) scrip.
---
I suppose, and maybe it because I have been in the end game for over a year and a half. Lol. 5 minutes silo run, drop and server hop, 30 key cards to spare, 3800hrs put into game, level 500 what else is there to do, and personally I don't need any Legendary items at this point. To each there own I guess, it the little things that count for me. I like to play dirty, because I know üòè how much it going to cost in materials to rebuild. It going to cost way more than what you stole, just saying. PVP is so underrated in this game. 
---
Nonetheless I do wish all the best. üëç
---
I've tried to find a match but i never get in one so i just ignore that mode :/ but it would be quicker yeah
---
I agree and think there should be a level cap as well
---
Being in-game around daily reset time can cause it, you‚Äôll see half a dozen posts complaining about it at this time every day. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think Bethesda have said anything about it.
---
I could get on board with that, the death penalty is basically non existent anyway. But as is currently implemented the game tells you where to retrieve ‚Äúyour‚Äù junk when it‚Äôs dropped, so op has a vaild point in being able to initiate pvp if another player beats you to it.
---
My usual run for lead is the raider camps for weights, morgantown, then the lucky hole mine with the excavator power armor. I can usually get anywhere between 700 to 1k pieces of lead along with a decent amount of plastic doing the run.
---
okay so that makes sense to me now. I see yeah is good can be happy for everyone then. I just wish I had a way to help yall and still get my last needed plan too lol but no worries. Thanks for the lnfo.
---
I leave one salt in the bag :)
---
i was a Dayz Player before and ho man, life was rude out there
---
Sounds like the same guy.  Never got to even experience the chair that glitches.  Thanks for reporting him.  I took a picture of his name and location but haven't done so.  If you think it would help, I'm willing to add my complaint to Beth as well.  I wasn't sure if that was grounds for getting kicked or anything since I have heard of this stuff happening and still was naive enough to trust a friendly chatter in a mr. Fuzzy outfit.
---
But you nailed that one...douche...just missed the word bag at the end
---
But PvP bad, food good
---
I have had this issue since i got first. Every person im friends with doesnt have me in their social tab inside fo76. We are friends, and many are favorites, but they cant join my private world and I cant join theirs. The funny thing is, if I try jlining someones private world that i am not friends with, it wont even try to connect to their world. But when they are in my friends list I can join or they can join mine, but I get kicked a few minutes later.
---
Angry turtle has a video for it. It seems like a pretty solid stealth build. 
---
Energy resistance and rad resistance don't  count against it from what I've heard probably not poison resist either. Damage reduction works with it such as sentinels, fireproof, blocker, lone wanderer, etc...
---
I think it's mostly popular because it adds a challenge to the game as a classic glass cannon type assassin.
---
Bloodied is more like easy mode because there's no real need to eat or drink unless you want to fast travel, no need to carry chems, stimpacks, or radaway because if you go down you lose enough rads to still maintain bloodied and replenish some of your hunger and thirst.
---
Whenever I need lead and I don't want to run Lucky Hole, I head to Top of the World. There's three sets of three can chimes around the area, each chime is worth 9 tin cans. One run gives up to 81 cans, then you server hop and if no one else has been there, they respawn. If you get overencumbered, there are workbenches all over to break down your cans.
---
It's not quite as time efficient as Lucky Hole, especially when you hit a server where someone else has nabbed all the cans, but you don't need Excavator and it feels like less effort.
---
i have never encountered cheater or i do not pay attention. Usually, i play far from other
---
i'm on PC
---
i will be very surprised if the legendary perks make it this patch
---
thank for the award stanger
---
What is your last plan? You could join the plan collector discord and we can help
---
It had to be said! But do you know what you've done?
---
I‚Äôd smash
---
I want a bow that's made out of truck leaf springs.
---
It doesn‚Äôt require PA, there are wood platforms 1/3 and 2/3 of the way down to jump on.
---
IF they stay on the server, just wait for em to go PVE stuff. Walk in front of them as they shoot.
---
Honestly that‚Äôs my favorite glitch so I‚Äôve made it to where my characters backstory is the psychopath of Appalachia!
---
Why would you use a gatling plasma on a commando? That's just gimping.
---
This is presuming they aren't passive mode drones.
---
There's a button called seek revenge, it pests you to come back and pvp
---
Steam is a middleman, a processor and any purchases there are not as timely as with Beth direct.
---
With the added caveat that linked accounts on steam have 2 wallets. One when launched via steam and one when launched via Beth's launcher. F1st and atoms are not transferable between them.
---
Okay here me out...
---
How much junk would be required to trigger this? 
---
1lb? 10lb? 100lb?
---
The reason I ask is because this would be a terrible idea and result in so much more Player killing via traps. 
---
Player gets his friend to kill him leaving a bag of junk then hides nearby. Let's use foundation or crater as an example. 
---
Unlucky player comes along and notices a bag of a few junk items. 
---
Boom dragged into pvp. Now they lose all the junk they just found and all the junk they were carrying. 
---
They could fight back for it thanks to the new system buttttt the other player has already quit/fast travelled etc etc or are just so OP they could never win there junk back.
---
I figure daily ops won‚Äôt make consoles
---
Another solid review üëç
---
Thanks! I got it now!
---
I do see some slight difference with the bloodied effects, haven't tried a junkies though. Been specing for a bow build since lvl 10 and now lvl 160. Kinda taken the bloodied idea but applied to a fullhealth stealth explosive bow build. I've had my corpse handed to me a time or 15, but I am enjoying being a bow build main.
---
Literally this.  If you aren't prepared, don't come.
---
Yikes
---
Maybe you could find enough people to get it going by posting for a match on here.
---
If not don't worry soon enough they'll have more nw exclusive holiday items coming for the holidays
---
I was over 1000+ hours in before seeing the ghoul, but it's been at Alpha 3 times for me now.  Never seen the chameleon yet...
---
Damn hippies.
---
Amen üôè to that, because that exactly how I would do it! Here is your house warming gift üéÅ üß®üí• bitches! Lol.
---
Damn, was gonna say I'll help you out but I'm on xbox.
---
What system do you play on that you don‚Äôt see many player vendors? I‚Äôm on Xbox and they‚Äôre all over the place. I actually get more than 70% of my caps from my vending machines.
---
I did the exact same thing! I wanted a picture so bad but don't have the will to go back and server hop those tunnels another 3 billion times to find another owlet.
---
Season is finished for most, Earle is a colossal bug problem, and the balancing is coming on the 15th.
---
Only new and hardcore player are now active, or those hunting XP to level up for the perk cards.
---
I don't expect everybody to be nice to me for no reason
---
Ah that makes sense, a rather sensible level of utility we don't see terribly often from the devs.
---
Gives them a lot more value.
---
Thanks for the tip :P
---
Yea I mentioned have a fast travel cool down and only letting non-pacifists do it and also give a pop up warning for new players so they know it's pvp risk but yes I came up with this in 1min devs can think of how to patch the holes, or not because public teams had to fix the pvp trap of private teams not too long ago.
---
I use the place for Starlight Berry farming so I'm there about once a week...lil thing is always dead...
---
Ohhh I'll go check there today! Thanks!
---
For reals, leave it at camp...
---
Keep the budget as it is. I‚Äôd rather have a small and detailed base, instead of a large empty mansion.
---
Not if they take ur junk and taunt you. Guy waited till I was there to get it before nagging it all so dance. Where is that seek revenge button?
---
I am totally down with the social aspect of that. üëç
---
Didn't read your post but I agree with the title.  I automatically assume everyone in a Mr. Fuzzy outfit is an asshole lol
---
Is that a stealth suit you're wearing? I will take that thank you very much.
---
most likely, i remember hearing early on that at least the weight bench will give a buff.
---
You can glitch through it. There‚Äôs cut content as other said. Was going to be part of a presidential race PVP event that was cut. 
---
Would have introduced a new currency called Presidential Seals. You‚Äôd be able to get a presidential power armor or presidential gauss rifle.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Race_for_the_Presidency
---
Hey the game let's you get away with it. For now.
---
Thanks ill have to try that if I dont get it soon
---
Sad '' no cross-platform'' noise
---
This is a power armor glitch. The body is the shape and size of the armor. If you see one standing still for awhile it s a server fast travel bug. It leaves a copy of the person behind. If they are standing still naked. It means they left the server and the items on the character are gone because there is nothing on them to load
---
Brotherhood of Take
---
Lol i was getting my crafting pants on about to ask the same thing. Good on you
---
Affirmative. Always loved the compassion and sheer emotional charge of the robot bartender. A shoulder to cry on, asking the real questions, like ‚Äúyou want some more?‚Äù One of those strong, stoic types.
---
Destination: Romance - ticket for one,please.
---
Just seek if he kills you in the first place.
---
No u
---
ONE TIME does not make a trend.
---
Best feature of Fallout 76...it's community. (my experience)
---
Peoples and Factions don't change over centuries, nope. Not at all.
---
It doesn't make the slightest bit of sense that a group of people who were mostly alive before the war and serving their country putting their life on the line genuinely thinking (for one reason or another) that they were helping make the world a better place, would care about actually making the world a better place after the literal Apocalypse. Nah.
---
It's Bethesda's lazy lore retcons. That's always the right answer.
---
I have read (on this sub) that in the PTS the pixel/Tesla issue is fixed. I really hope that is true. If that's the case, the fix should arrive with patch 22
---
Ive tested this for many hours on the PTS, i would not be so dismissive of OPs concerns.
---
 first, hes not wrong about spongey trash mobs like mole rats, they are actual pretty fucking annoying. not challenging, not fun, just a nuisance made worse by adding a big health bar to a rat. its really not that fun.
---
second, hes not wrong in that you will sort of lose the ability to power level, this always happens when moving to a normalized enemy model, its not *that* big of a deal and leveling isnt that bad with the new model but there is a little merit to ops concern if you like to quickly level alts.
---
and third, because of high level enemy scaling, already ineffective defense now will do diddly shit when they could be used in a low level area before. and people WILL notice more annoying camp destruction with the update.
---
&gt; government
---
Says enough.
---
It goes to Bethesda as a convenience fee
---
I've seen 4 in total. 3 in Harper's Ferry and a roaming one north of Watoga. Almost 1500hrs and that's it. Excluding events.
---
Try tracking down Glowing 3* Mole Miners outside of Lode Bearing and Uranium Fever. I've yet to find one.
---
So he's just a scrap collectron. Gee I wonder if he's the only one that can do that
---
Nice, I started playing sometime after that original Halloween event so I never had a chance to grab up all of those cosmetics.
---
I usually farm the Monster Mash every chance I get to build up my candy hoard, will probably be dropping some for peeps who visit my camp that month.  ^  o^
---
Would love if they make a jack o lantern loot bag.
---
I've seen some of the previous jack o lantern camp items and was saddened that they don't light up.
---
I‚Äôm nice to people all the time for no reason, mostly just handing out free shite like food water and meds. Never expect anything in return, just being kind to people.
---
(Biggest thing I gave to someone for free was a Hunter‚Äôs Longcoat to a level 20 dude. That was probably a 20k item. He wanted to be a gunslinger and use revolvers and lever actions so I gave him a hunter Longcoat and a black cowboy hat to match his build.)
---
I totally agree it's really surprising when you are used to trash game like dayz
---
Good for you. All these people DID have problems. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=Fallout+1st+atoms&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all .
---
So I was pretty much with this post right up until this
---
" Good things happen because of their selfish end goals"
---
The end goal of the Brotherhood is to preserve technology and knowledge until such a time that humanity is ready to exit the current dark ages. All the rest of what they do is to reach those ends. I sometimes think folks forget their actual goal. I can't really call this selfish.
---
Fast travel cool down won't affect people utilising this as a trap as they are probably geared for pvp. 
---
Non Pacifists doesn't always include everyone you think. The sheer amount of pve players that don't have pacifist on is huge. (Judging by the posts on here and the large amount of players that don't even know it exists)
---
Pop ups don't get read in this game (judging by the sheer amount of players that complain that someone pvp'd them in a workshop they own)
---
As for the idea being a quick one. I can see and new ideas are awesome but dropping junk is a penalty for dying. Not losing durability on gear. Not dropping anything else just junk. That is easily solved by storing it. 
---
If your carrying enough junk to care about losing it. However that may be. Then you should prioritise storing it.
---
I wanna roll back to 1999, when they killed you on sight.
---
Mine is the "You have been insulted" note.
---
I think he's got his BIOS dealer to pay before he can start his day
---
Yep, because when they return it going to be there house warming gift üéÅ from many of us patriotic veterans, that rebuilt the wasteland well they were on a extended vacation. RIP üôè BOS. Lol. Just kidding a little. Lol. 
---
I wish you all the best! üôÇ
---
Toxic goo or a gamma gun are great at adding a bunch of rads.  Halloween candy is amazing at fine tuning rad levels and is weightless while counting as a prewar food.  Run monster mash once or twice for thousands of candy.
---
If you have a mutation like Healing Factor that is what is causing your FT issues. As a bloodied build, this is part of your life (the FT bug). Even high health folks that use Healing Factor have trouble travelling. I've tested this multiple times with multiple players. Health buffing has something to do with it.
---
Like you say, merch refers specifically to promotional merchandise that is branded for something. I heard it first referencing the band - themed items sold at concerts, so t-shirts, hats, posters, number stickers, etc. This goes back at least to the 1990's, so 25-ish years is a pretty long pedigree. 
---
OP is using it exactly for this meaning and
---
Good points
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Bers is brilliant! And with bloodied being less OP in the coming patch it's going to be more attractive to more people. 50% damage all the time no matter what you're health.
---
Even a bloody commando has enough perk points to get all the relevant perks. OP might miss out on 15% dmg from the perks, but that can be evened out with a magic gun.
---
I have vintage nuka-shine in my camp bowl...and sell them cheap.
---
My guy, this is so well said, thank you!  And the fact that you mentioned the Calculator brings a smile to my heart.  :)  Tactics was, in fact, the first Fallout game I played before jumping in 1&amp;2 :)
---
Please understand I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just offering another viewpoint on how people will utilise this against what you intend.
---
Eh I'm not really for them adding more PvP until they are able to balance it way better than it currently is. Hopefully the damage reduction patch is a step towards that.
---
Acp got delayed more than one time
---
Two can play the game lmfao. üß®üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•ü§£
---
Back when I didn‚Äôt have access to Ultracite I searched and searched for T60 power armor pieces... It took many days of server hopping. Try the military camp near the watoga train station, the locked room at the bus stop in watoga, and on top of the school at watoga. Also the center of town where the helicopter crashed.
---
Someone saw my collection of stuffed animals, saw I was missing the sloth toy and gifted it to me. I know it isn't much, but I was having such a shit day and that small, sweet gesture cheered me right up.
---
Sadly no, you have to farm the daily quest to make more reputation you can also take the daily photography quest at the overseer home and sell the picture to the faction but the bonus in rep is ridiculously low
---
While you're very right in your assessment, you leave out one important aspect. These are the founding members of the Brotherhood. The ones who mutinied in response to atrocities against Chinese prisoners. The ones who have been presented in lore as White Knights. 
---
The Appalachian BoS may easily be d-bags when they get here, but that will be a departure from the way their history has been told in past games.
---
And that is how the RNG likes to take out it's issues on us....
---
Its a very tedious quest. I hope to never repeat again.
---
That's a good attitude. I as well never expect anything from those I give free stuff to. I don't even stay to see if they emote at me.
---
Gave some serums to a lvl 30 player at a forest event once. The dude places down his tent and drops an explosive flamethrower on the ground.
---
It depends on your style. I just use a primed heavy on Earl and the SBQ. Normal ammo for Fixer &amp; HM.
---
ATM that is, might be changed when the balancing hits. But atm I can oneshot almost everything with the fixer &amp; HM, and if it's needs more than one shot... So what it's a commando with an auto rifle .)
---
Because you can't handle the truth Bitches!
---
thought this was going to be about morgantown airport.. lol
---
You're complaining about people trying to hold Bethesda to a higher standard especially with a nearly  2 year old game
---
It's really bad when you die after the SBQ amd some douche monkey takes your flux
---
Pi√±ata
---
You don't grasp how exploitable this suggestion is. Especially with differentiated lootbags being premium.
---
He was making a joke.
---
It‚Äôs just because they both change the projectile type, but the pulse takes priority.
---
They should also make bullion and scrip tradable, and take away the bullion benchmark, or at least make it 200 gold per machine
---
Faschnat day was delayed
---
Can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve seen that one....  Flame icon?
---
You will only have 2 at 100
---
I love it when I up set others because I am right ‚úÖ üòå
---
I'm not one to pick fights haha ;)
---
lmao a tiny wendigo projector lamp? could use the one from this season and just reskin the globe
---
Since its free, it should be there until such time as you claim it.
---
Poor baby u want some cookies?
---
The big rumor going around is that they are setting up the field for a possible 2021 Zetan DLC. A number of datamines, an unmarked "treasure hunt" and a random (but essentially worthless) buff to the Alien Blaster in the PTS point in this direction.
---
First one I ever got was pretty quick. Haven't ever done another after the second one. That thing took about 20-30 mins to arrive, I saw people in my group get drops sooner having called them in after I did. Not that great loot and just not worth the time tbh.
---
I don't mind paying the taxes, but I would like to know what my taxes are being spent on.  It sure as hell isn't new roads or public safety.
---
Or gave you a Rad-X and wished you good luck if your character was dumb as bricks while taking on the Glow assignment.
---
ah I see
---
Is there any way to determine which seed the servers have or is it truly just "you get what you get"?
---
Vault Raids were also on PC first and Consoles second
---
I had the reverse happen once...I had it happened where I got a constant health regen because I went to sleep in someone's 1st Tent...and they moved the tent or DCed? I don't know, but the point is, it vanished from under me. Basically, this caused it to bug out so that even though I was no longer sleeping. I kept the bonus until I logged out.
---
It was during Fasnacht.
---
Fucking trolls, suckling like little üê∑
---
how about a nuclear keycard?
---
Yes. When anyone enters my camp blast cotton eye joe
---
If you die after the sbq your flux just disappears into the void. No actually, its a bug that has been around for awhile. Not sure why it hasn't been fixed.
---
OP's emphasis was on the delay on consoles, that happened one time.
---
Not the general delay on all platforms.
---
A bloodied commando, a decent build one, doesn‚Äôt have 9 points for the heavy guns and 2 for bandolier in strength. With blocker as well that‚Äôs 14. Where are u losing the points from to make those ones up? Agility and luck??
---
Nice skin, I'll wear it
---
Don't give Todd ideas. If you have a scrapbox he has too much of your money as it is.
---
oh well thank you anyway
---
I  think it leaves on the 8th
---
Well I don‚Äôt play on pc or PlayStation so for me the current trend is delayed on each patch since faschnat theres been something missing.
---
You know how the bleeding heart Roger Maxson mutinied upon seeing the FEV experiments being done? First order of business was lining up and executing every single scientist involved in it that was stationed at Mariposa at the time. No due process, no asking questions, they were guilty by association and therefore executed.
---
I should clarify they're adding fire resistance in patch 22.  It's in pts
---
That‚Äôs weird as it‚Äôs one of the mutations I have on all my characters,
---
Also in the manager terminal, Joyce Easton, the acting manager of white springs post war, used the caps as a rationing system so people could still buy supplies from the shop keepers too.
---
‚ÄúCan't be too careful, though. That Nuka-Cola promotion is still going on, so I've arranged for the robots to bring me the caps they collect, and I'll dole them out to the guests so they can buy what they need. Makes for a nice little rationing system.‚Äù
---
the daily faction quests (donate Your reward to the faction, BTW).
---
daily photo from the overseers bot.  
---
random encounters with either faction, help them fight an enemy.
---
It‚Äôs a slow go, no matter how you do it.
---
Cool. I wonder what other changes or factions inspired by previous games they could throw in.
---
Just sprint around and claim rando‚Äôs workshops
---
It apparently plagues me constantly as my friend will always tell me that im very disproportionate
---
yeah, it got delayed on all platforms, not just consoles.
---
But it is also the only thing that got delayed especially on consoles, which was a one-time event. Until now.
---
So I stand by my comment, a single delay on one platform does not make a trend.
---
I know. I am speculating the in game cannon.
---
You have links to the datamined stuff or where you heard said rumors? I ask because I NEED this info lol
---
If you have broken armor (no durability) it doesn‚Äôt count towards your DR, so you can get the buffs from a 3* armor and a berserker weapon
---
BOS are all sporting MAGA hats under those hoods. Fuckin' profligates...
---
Far-Flung Fireworks, Master Infiltrator, Ammo Factory, Legendary Endurance &amp; Charisma. I'm on the fence for the last slot but probably Intelligence.
---
It leaves on the 7th along with the steel dawn fatigues.
---
Which is ironic because on those games Rad-X stacked over 100%, meaning that it was literally as easy as eating a bunch of them to survive the Glow unscratched.
---
I hope Bethesda leans into a community/village idea and gets away from a player against player... that's what nuclear winter is for.
---
I made a thread about this the other day and there was one like a week ago both of them got lots of replies that would seem to indicate that people don't believe their Teslas are glitching everybody else's game
---
How much you wanna bet something gets left out on consoles?
---
I‚Äôve been killed as a low level by a handful of high level players that are well above my level for the sport of it and I can tell you I‚Äôve had the thought of tossing in the explosive bait on their camps just because one dbag action deserves another.  Imo level 100+ have no business killing &lt;50 players who are in the Forest even if they are claiming a workshop - that person does not need the resources not to mention they usually don‚Äôt even take the junk or build/use resource nodes.  So I definitely see no problem in destroying someone‚Äôs camp like this, they have it coming.  üòÇ
---
Not long enough. They're so terrible with how these rewards are distributed.
---
You can donate 10k of the resource and be out of town for work when they put it in the shop a week later, missing the reward. The only workaround is hoping your discord mate doesn't change your password on you.
---
Just mind boggling that they weren't simple, immediate rewards for completing a "Donate Supplies X times" challenge.
---
My main lives in PA, so I've field tested all of them except SH. 
---
I wouldn't use Excavator as my combat set, but many people do. Other than that, they offer very slight differences that really only matter long term. Wearing Raider means you use 6 stims in a day instead of 4 in T65.
---
If you want to min/max, go with the solid advice above but it isn't a huge issue.
---
Try berserker in a CSS .)
---
Oh that's even worse then. I'm a bloodied build, so sometimes in the scramble to loot her, something will just come up and oneshot me when I'm not paying attention.
---
It will be there until [September 7th](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/aziPqMpE2SiBmqWPiAxUb/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-1-8).  I believe the Atomic Shop recent is around 12 noon ET, but I don‚Äôt recommend trying to cut it that close.
---
It's a glitch.
---
There is a little bug that allows you make a blueprint of the ammo factory that's within the munitions factory workshop and then build multiple copies of it anywhere in camps or workshops
---
Is most apparent and irritating on bloodied builds, if you haven't been affected on other characters, thank the Overseer and carry on!
---
I recently changed my build completely around the Chinese armor and am know a stealth melee character. I enjoy it because I no longer have to carry ammo except for the one gun I keep to shoot down scorched beasts and vertibirds. I am in the process of trying to build the SS armor simply for the jet pack but it is very time consuming.
---
It‚Äôs +75 if you donate the photos. Compared to the standard 200 rep for the daily quest, and that‚Äôs a decent boost.
---
OK, thanks for explaining that.
---
Exploit/cheat.   A lot of low levels doing it cause their shit at walking around finding shit tons of ammo like I can. (I don't even have scrounger perk on)
---
Yep, and that's okay. You shortened a lot of lore and left out the investigation and trials, but hey, Enclave flair.  ;)
---
Dodging Earle is easy, dodging other players dodging Earle.. Not so much
---
I never loot her until well after the event ends. Better safe than sorry. Just hop on top of a tent or go hide in the BOS bunker and let the scorch mirelurk kings one shot someone else who's too impatient. I might hide like a wuss but I still have all my flux!
---
Oh hey it's the 90s and there's a new genre called multiplayer FPS. People are JuMp1ng as they shoot, it's crazy. That's not what jumping is for lol. It'll never catch on.
---
Once again, a single snowflake does not make a winter.
---
Ty man. I think it would give bloodied builds like myself a run for our money
---
If you have FO1 just get in the habit of randomly dropping your tent to stash junk.
---
Cork please tell me it collects cork.
---
The best version of this gun imo is the Quad - 33% vats hit - 25% less vats cost. Even without the glitched leg it will one shot supermutants in vats headshots, and if you have decent AP you can shoot off all 8 rounds. Add in gun fu and adrenaline and your walking through west tek like hobo with a shotgun. When you get outnumbered pop a sunshine oil off your quick wheel and you got about 15 seconds of unlimited AP in vats.
---
r/fo76 reddit:   
---
I love how humble, caring and nice this community is to one another.  
---
Also r/fo76 reddit: Don't revive low players at events, or try to defend them.
---
I think I get it? A lot of how this game calculates damage and perks is really confusing.
---
It‚Äôs little things like this that count in life.  A nice gesture at worst means nothing, but at best makes that persons day.  No reason not to be this way.  This community definitely seems to have way more of this than the troll behavior that tends to be in other games.
---
It‚Äôs ok...Member. We‚Äôre here for you. As is MODUS and his army of cold unfeeling robots.
---
you will get about as far with me as arguing with people who have complained for thirty years that TV commercials are too loud
---
but i respect your "No" all the same
---
Exactly. The dude is as much of a monster as the scientists.
---
I don't think very many players here soak in the whole story, let alone read between the lines.
---
Hell, Intrepid and I had to fight tooth and nail for a month to get the BOS founding data updated on the wiki.
---
I will probably be downvoted to hell but this is the only downside to dying. So I don't think it should be removed.
---
Which one are you?
---
Agreed, but unfortunately low level players don't read Reddit posts.
---
Also would like a smoother animation and with the bow or compound bow allow us to keep an arrow loaded in there instead of having to go through the entire animation of grabbing one from our back
---
Plot twist: OP has an RTX 2080 and there's a big cuboid zebra standing behind them.
---
On public events (the big ones where fast travel is free), you don't drop junk on death.
---
OP has already said they don't care about the junk, why shove it down their throat?
---
Wonder if they could make a Highwayman tent skin so it looks like you were driving your car around the wasteland?
---
Get away with what?  Claiming abandoned salvage?
---
its almost as if they should fix the fuckin game.
---
but no we need more copy paste "this community is great" "please add THIS to the atom shop" and "why did someone kill me in my workshop" posts.
---
bugs? downvote.
---
Read my comment, I did not use the word "decent".
---
To be effective all you need is 3 points in str. and most bloodied have that.
---
We are talking about SBQ, where there is no need to schlepp extreme amounts of ammo, or to block incoming attacks. 
---
All that is needed is damage, and that can be done with 3 cards in str and a magic weapon, to be on par with a normal heavy build.
---
Brilliant. ü§£ü§£
---
Never.
---
Because Todd.
---
They can change, yeah, but they best be interesting. Bethesda's versions of the BOS barely are, the ones OP describes were. At least in my oppinion.
---
On a side note, i find it really annoying when people use in universe and lore excuses for why a certain faction or story turned out a certain way. The fallout world (and others) was made up by people, it was in their hands to make it engaging. Not saying you did that in your comment, just saying its something to think about.
---
The pre-BOS lead by Maxon executed civilian scientists. They are willing to put down those they see as threats, armed or not.
---
Rattle hands for ranged, fever claw for melee. Boom fixed
---
keep that qffrfr on me at all times for this lol
---
I just think she's neat
---
I used to play dayz and still play gta lol
---
Ah Berserker.. I just imagine Hugh Jackman angry, lost and confused with nothing but his mole miner gauntlet equipped running around corridors..
---
I have a reduced weight one and I made the mistake of making automatic at first. Woops.
---
Things have changed a lot since beta. Before several patches were implemented other players could easily destroy camps, attack you, etc. While not perfect it has come a long way.
---
idk man I've been a middle of the road player for months now and I still see plenty of activity going on
---
nukes have definitely slowed since the first few days of ACP but I feel like that's normal
---
And whoever does it get their camp's budget f... they say.
---
If there's one thing going well for this game, it's the community by jove, *inserts monocle*
---
I've got a SS chest can take a whole mag of 32 rounds to hit about 15% hp from full
---
They do change. Lyon's Pride is the example of that. They changed for the better on their own.
---
They changed for the worse when Arthur took over, who feverishly worked to restore the original status quo.
---
I'm sure the many Brotherhood chapters and time periods we haven't seen yet all have their own differences.
---
To be honest I have thought of that but since right now there is a lot of back and forth to the overseer I sort of set it up as a way to get to her or a train easily.  But I guess vault 76 isn't that far away from her either...so maybe I should start doing that more often.
---
ps4?
---
The fallout series has and always will be an exaggerated satirical look at society. The BoS has and always will be the in universe stand in for fascists and fascism. A heavily militarized, centralized power who blames their woes on the ‚Äòothers‚Äô (anything not human) and who‚Äôs goal is to preserve the past and eventual bring society back to ‚Äòhow it use to be‚Äô. Obviously that‚Äôs a very foreign concept to anyone living now since we don‚Äôt have any real world examples of that (/s), but even people with a shallow understanding of history can make correlations between the BoS and Nazis. 
---
Of course there are examples of particular quests about, or specific individuals within, the BoS where it‚Äôs not exactly a 1:1 comparison; but that‚Äôs cause it still has to be a fun story. 
---
Does this mean you can‚Äôt like the BoS? No, of course not. Like whatever you want, it‚Äôs a fictional universe. The reason they are liked is A) cause of Power Armor and B) because their goals often align with the players goals. That doesn‚Äôt mean the writers are not going to take every opportunity to make jokes about the underlying motives and meaning (see: the new BoS collectron). 
---
TLDR; the BoS are a satirical look at fascism. You can still think there cool just like you can think Stormtroopers are cool
---
I haven't looked into it too much because if it happens to be legit I don't want to be spoiled some surprises, but it's about the new Guidestones added to the Southern Savage Divide with Wastelanders, and a supposed link with the Investigator Cabin and some entries from his terminal that have been inaccessible since release. In one of the first iterations I also read of a connection with the original Appalachian BoS Chapter to the Burrows, but I haven't heard anymore about it so I imagine it turned out to be nothing.
---
If you search Alien Guidestones Fallout 76 on Google there are many results from Youtube and this subreddit, plus Juicehead also mentioned it a few times in his videos, and he regularly leaves a link to a discord of dataminers in his videos details so you can use that to ask them first hand.
---
[Here's what I've been using for now.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cf545b4&amp;d=sd2so2su2pl2pd2pk2pp2p02ej4c72ic1ir2a72ar2an2as1lt2le0sp2)
---
Ninja edit: I just realized it has master slugger in there instead of the intended master shotgunner.
---
I think the karma paid off!  I managed to get an Instigating Explosive Handmade with faster movement while aiming from the Purveyor today.  One of the guns I wanted.  Hopefully a Fixer will be next.  :)
---
Fallout 3 and 4 both have some supernatural stuff in them. The Dunwich Borrers and Building come to mind. It would be cool to shot lighting out of your hands at ghouls lmao.
---
What 3 cards. I run bloodied and have blocker and bandolier in strength. Using an insta ffr fr uktra gat with fire rate of 220+ I was dojng almost double the damage with my fixer. Just 1 of each of the HW perks?
---
What mod, because if I don't run the anti explosive one (dense I think) I blow my self up.
---
I think in the next update they will remove the travel cost to foundation and crater
---
Kill Earl thats the mission not saving people who knowingly took a spot fron someone we could of used to actually kill things.
---
That nice!!
---
Lol. Are u saying on consoles only once there has been a delay of anything?
---
Played it so much I'm sick of it lol
---
It still works. My friends bloodied ffr railway still works as does my laser.
---
&gt; A ranged build utilizing some type of sniper can do the same from a distance
---
Not anymore...
---
If it's tons of junk I'll just grab it and server hop to avoid shitty PvP thanks.
---
It's odd because dollars don't just disappear in real life. They go somewhere. If Bethesda wants to remove caps from the in game economy, thats great, but do it in a way that makes sense, like I have to pay the caps for something. Simply taking them by making vendors "randomly eat them" breaks immersion and doesn't make any sense.
---
Yep, that's what they're saying
---
Leg her! Once she's on the ground you can stand away from the head laser and finish her.
---
Yeah it was.. one of those nice things that happen occasionally
---
Tbh this wouldn't be an issue if there was more that lowbies could do to level up. However soon this will be an issue everywhere with the scaling of enemies to their  levels. I've been trying to level up an alt and most player not only don't help but they'll deliberately go of their way to make sure you die. 
---
Last night for example I went to a horde event and had the 3* at half health then a high level decided to drag a scorchbeast over to the event tag the boss and stood there waiting for me to die then killed only the boss. When I returned to the spot where the event was I couldn't search for loot because of the enemies still being at the location. 
---
Now I know to stay to in the forest until a certain point but after 3 servers of no events in the forest I grew tired of waiting around mostly because grinding out xp only works good for super mutants
---
Or trap camps.
---
You should be able to have PvP with someone if they kill you with punji boards
---
I use dense on one and jetpack on another. I usually use non explosives. rarely take the jetpack off unless I'm doing a pvp with friends (they use explosives alot)
---
You havent seen that drawing some one made .it's the whole setup.
---
Someone depositing a legendary in the machine and a belt moving that to the purveyor and some one at the purveyor counter buying said recycled legendary. It's a scam!
---
and why appointed them to make the call on what should be kept from people, and for how long? noone. the whole premise is based on them thinking they are superior and the only ones capable of handing technology, even if it means people suffer.
---
BoS have always looked after its own self interest over all just like every other selfish faction pre and post war. even "helpful" interactions with locals has always just been to fulfill their own aims.
---
That would be a cool way to go about it, I'd definitely take the time to play through that
---
In Red Dead redemption there is a wonderful couple that also practice this delightful lifestyle. Nothing like recycling your fellow species.ü§ìüëç‚ò†

He probably runs on Linux then.  www.linuxatemyram.com

A classic favorite is the long barrels with the focuser and sight mods.  As for receivers I cant tell you, as I've primed the ones I used so as to keep pa fusion cores and laser cores separate.
---
Needs more damage and a lot better range plus the reload time should be less
---
Interesting concept, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she was scamming us, but I still think she has a bunch of mole rats!
---
I'll stop responding here, you are unable to actually understand the words I write and I am unable to make it any clearer.
---
Either way I already said exactly where on the map it is, doesn't really matter anymore
---
Yeah that's true, corrected it.
---
They are some of the toughest things in the game for sure. You may put that quest off a bit until you level up and get some better gear. Shotgunning and crippling, sneaking and surprise attacking are two strategies you may try.
---
complainer
---
I'm searching for that pic..brb
---
Yooo. Whats heppenin. Its been a hot month
---
also BoS are shitheads. they get the plasma hose.
---
Falling into an ultacite fissure is the saddest way to lose junk. Never gonna get that bag out .
---
I brought a Freind of mine into the game who also used to play gta online. He says it‚Äôs such a different experience, because in GTA if you meet someone that‚Äôs that higher level than you, they will probably just kill you and laugh at you in chat. In fo76, the first person we met gave us 50 big presents, which really set us up for the first five levels. I love this community and the welcoming attitude towards the players!

It turned out that the setting was somehow set to not to show player names. I must have fatfingered it. The status bars still don't show up though.. not sure where to reset that if it is my fault again.

What is PTS? I have seen this acronym 3 times but I've never seen what it is supposed to mean

This is why I only play on a private server.  People are no damned good.

If I want to feel frustrated and angry I'll go to work.  At least there I get paid.

I was tempted to prime it as it‚Äôs not really an everyday weapon.. think you made my mind up

My friend used to have a lot of junk and he couldn‚Äôt afford fallout 1st so he kept it on him one time a ghoul killed him while he was afk and someone took his stuff he had over 1k copper and 5k steel

Looooooads of these in one of the ash heap mansions in a gym. It's the ine where you DON'T get the unique minigun.

How does a level 5 knowingly do anything? If they see a giant yellow icon on the map that is a free fast travel and take it thinking it's a regular event, how are they supposed to know any better? At level 5? 
---
IIRC I was an idiot at level 5. Maybe you started the game as a god but not all of us do.
---
I usually travel to vendor camps near locations when I need to do that on a new toon, but that's a good use of excess Nukashine. Smart tip.
---
At level 25 a level 250 dropped me a full set of excavator power armor full condition and 3 full fusion cores for me super nice guy

ETA sounds like next update fixes it
---
Thanks dude, appreciate your help.
---
It'd be really cool to see the zetans come back. I really hope they do that, and bring back the alien atomizer
---
It's a matter of accountability. People shouldn't turn up to events they can't do and make themselves everyone else's problem.
---
 Equally stop blaming the community for a comment I wrote. I am not the community.
---
So video games should make no effort whatsoever to mimic things in real life? How about everyone has 10 eyes? 17 legs? Get out of here. The money disappearing makes no sense and could easily be something else. I have no idea what your point even is other than "no, caps should disappear, video games are fake". Okay whatever bro good point?
---
Ummm it has a recommended level like all of the events do? It says hard or very hard in the pop up description.   You don't really need to call the 1-900- nintendo line to find out it isn't for a level 5 or 30

Hitting 20k on scorchbeast with sneak power attk. I think I'm doing ok

Gotcha. thank you!

Because everything has to revolve around sex or sexual identity for some people.

Add me I need to escape!
---
Interesting, thank you.
---
I see it as people wanting to make it visible. But I do believe Bethesda sees thing from a different perspective. THIS issue in particular, they don't give a shit about.
---
Yea it's a tough "poor one out for the homies moment"
---
Heavy gunner, expert heavy gunner, and master heavy gunner in str.

I use a B/50L/RE minigun and the SBQ melts

Edit: forgot mention the gun is primed.

So just 1 of each card?  Might give it a go.
---
Ad Victorium... member.
---
Let me rephrase my initial complaint then.  This looks like a bug. If it were intentional there would be lore attached to it. There should be lore attached to the things in the game that happen so that it is internally consistent. Things magically disappearing just break the experience. I don't want to be taken out of the game because I notice a bug. Internal consistency. Fallout is supposed to take place in a world where radiation works differently, but physics still exists. SO things don't disappear into thin air.  "Its just a video game" is a dumb argument and means nothing.
---
Thanks for the info
---
One time does not make a trend.....it‚Äôs been multiple times.  Either you work for Bethesda. Have shares in them or are blind.
---
On the whole, I like mine.  It's a Junkies Bashing Faster Reload Ultracite gatling laser.
---
It was a pain to unlock all the mods for it, but i like ha ing it around in my loadout.  I run PA heavy, so obviously stabilized is in my loadout.  But the thing has no recoil, little to no spread, and its spin up is tolerable.  The overall accuracy makes it a beast against scorchbeasts that are just too far away for my .50 to hit them nicely.
---
Thank you all for the input. I feel I will go with SS armor than grind later for the CSA.  Mahalo
---
Ave Caesar
---
I don't even understand why your stuff is lootable by other players in the first place. I'm referring to outside of PvP.
---
Thank you. Not that I have found a need for a jetpack. I think it‚Äôs more of a fun thing to have but not useful the way I play.  üëç
---
How long until the bos one become unavailable
---
Set your camp close to one of them. My current camp is ten seconds away from Foundation. Fast travel to your camp.
---
Punish you for dying I guess. Really it only hurts the non fallout firsters, me included
---
All the fixes to problems they overlook on previous games were done with unofficial patches from players, it should not surprise anyone who's played them. This entire "game" was made to get some cash flowing with minimal effort, so "bugs" that they benefit from are not a priority.
---
I use enforcer and cripple them.  They'll crawl for miles trying to get to you.
---
But blowing their legs out seems to be the easiest way for me.
---
As a Tanky PA Heavy Gunner, Taking One for the Team is a must. 40% more damage because something decided to hit you is wonderful. What Rads? is also excellent, since I won't have to worry about Rad-X or Radaway anymore.
---
My other four are going to be Legendary Strength, Endurance, Agility, and Luck (So LEGENDARY S.E.A.L.) because getting 76 Perk Slots to work with is perfect for my build (and feels appropriate, given the name of this game).
---
The stealth bonus you will no longer be getting is more than 15% and that's without even touching on perks.

---
between that.. ammo.. and gear/weapon repair junk is going to be at a premium..
---
start hoarding now
---
Yup only those two work. Which is probably a bug with this bug/unmentioned change
---
I agree, during fasnacht I was once grinding screws, got around 40. I went to the parade cuz it was starting and I wanted a free legendary for scrip. Skip to the end, I accedently throw a grenade and it activates pvp. I doubt I need to explain the absolute hailstorm on bullets that rained down on me for the next 3.14 second, and I died. I go back and my loot back is fuckin banished by that point. So many screws, so many hours, gone because of some assholes.
---
Yeah, I've read it too. It's been twice where the consoles got an additional delay.
---
Once this year and once last year. So tell me how is this a trend?
---
Cranberry Glade is my go to spot. There's a second random encounter very close if you run NE into the bog a bit. If you've got a survival tent you can put it down at the second location and just map between the two then server hop.

As an added bonus check the ground at the spawn point for Cranberry Glade, you can often find one of Ward's quest items there and if it's the osmosis kit or power pack it can't be scrapped and will never be removed from your inventory. Have fun never having to actually do his quest again.
---
I still play DayZ and GTA
---
Need to put stairs first. Or you can put a roof.
---
This is a weird argument
---
Thanks mate üëç
---
Legs first, then when assaultron is crawling hit the head.
---
But you know this mission has two assaultrons and one Level 60 Sentry Bot at end right?  I had the same issue doing this mission.
---
If you still need help by Tuesday send a DM and I will send my gamertag over so we can team up.  Currently a Level 140 and blow right through these things.
---
Yes!
---
It is intentional.., they said when they introduced vendors that 10% of sales are withheld as a tax to sustain the economy. 
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. Do you actually think it‚Äôs a bug, despite them explaining the mechanic when it was added last year?
---
I just wish pvp was locked to factions and area locked. You wanna fight each other? Go to a specific zone somewhere in the map. Leave us pve'ers alone lol. And I dont mean nw. NW is just fortnite in fallout
---
I think I was on your team earlier.
---
Whatever she is saying, it sounds very sexy. I too would like a translation....
---
Relax I don‚Äôt need no minus melee damage
---
What's weird about it? The game should be internally consistent. If the caps are going to disappear there should at least be a lore related explanation. Do you not understand what that is? Your stance is "the game can do random shit and people should just make up explanations for it" ?
---
How about engage the arguement instead of calling it weird? I dunno
---
y'all just love throwing money at Bethesda for low-effort work, don't you?
---
No because it's a fucking dumb thing to do, as is suggesting it.
---
True long barrels and a prime receiver. Beam focuser is bugged and changes colour to red again, personally I skip it.
---
Most efficient guns in the game. They're my favourite!
---
Thank you.
---
What's a white player tag mean?
---
perhaps.jpg
---
The 30k cap limit is already a pretty good limiting mechanism at the high end of the player economy
---
Only things I want to be silent are turrets...
---
It‚Äôs not random though. Do you think we need lore to explain fast travel? Or fast travel cost? Or a robot vendor who you pay 100 caps but only 25 shows up in their inventory? Or a scrip limit? Do you need lore to explain  how the queen can be killed repeatedly on a server? Or how Earl magically appears again if you just keep nuking the mine?
---
Some things you just have to accept as an in game mechanic meant to improve the experience of everyone on the server and support the economy.
---
Electric Absorption for chance to revive fusion core
---
Master Infiltrator will be good for lockpick and hacking
---
Power Armor Reboot since I where Power Armor all the time and this has a chance of auto-revive
---
Fucking same dude, GTA online is so toxic.
---
I think Bethesda could add more Flatwood Monster type events as well. There could be an alien worshipping cult like the Mothman . Have an underground base where they operate out from...
---
‚ÄúI just found this piece of. Used. Toilet paper.‚Äù
---
STOP MENTIONING SUGAR GROVE
---
THERE IS NO SUGAR GROVE AND EVEN IF THERE WAS IT WOULDN‚ÄôT HAVE SCREWS.
---
STAY AWAY REEEEEEEEEE
---
Bloodied players now want: 0 risk
---
I was actually unaware of that. So there you go, I was wrong on this one and you've informed me. Thank you!
---
Oh my very happy for you! If the new patch hits as is, Instigating weapons will be top tier next patch! Congratulations :)
---
I was gonna give my short review after being 50 hrs in. I only started last month and I freakin love this game. Yes there are glitches quite often (mostly related to enemy AI) but even then the positives overshadow them. The people I've interacted with are so nice, been given free stuff at lower levels at least 4-5 times. Played in a party with people off this sub as well who were really helpful and friendly. The only bad experience I've had is with 1 shit bag who was Lvl 598 (first time I saw a 400+ level) who obliterated me in 2 secs and stole all my junk.
---
50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 are the level benchmarks for new slots
---
Yes, definitely.
---
5 SPECIAL Cards and the one which reduces ranged damage... Finally, I have found an option to max all stats. All I need now is the secret service underarmor and five armor pieces with "str" legendary effect...
---
Honestly, they shouldn't able to take shit from you since they already get caps from killing you.
---
Of course, right after I found the perfect place in between them for my camp
---
My dumb ass is set up just inside the ash heap because I got tired of "cannot place CAMP, change servers?" So Crater is like 40 caps away.
---
Do you have any evidence of the trials?
---
Screws are plentiful now. Easily get over 100 at ACP without trying
---
Above players characters is there gamer tag and there level. Normally these are white unless you are in a group, then the group members are yellow.
---
 During events it makes all event members yellow, this basically turns off pvp between everyone, even if you directly hit them. It cuts down on accidently friendly fire during events. When an event ends everyone goes back to white, meaning a stray bullet will initiate pvp with them.
---
Huh. Guess it‚Äôs been a while since I played.
---
Couldn‚Äôt take my Xbox to college
---
Because op isn‚Äôt talking on specific delay but things that are supposed to be in an update not being in the update. If you include patches it‚Äôs almost every single one something promised is missing. Your either being wilfully argumentative or your clueless
---
"Collecting fun is what. I. doooooooooooooooooooooo - I find party. supplies. for yoooooooooooooooooooooooooh

I find it sad that we cannot use combat rifle skins on the Fixer even though we can use combat rifle mods ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wendigos drop 6 or so screws each. At ACP event there‚Äôs dozens of the damn things. Kill as u go. Forget escaping at the end and just loot the bodies. Screws for fun.
---
So a giant mound of flesh, no thanks satan
---
lol, go and test it.
---
Fair enough.
---
PVP should never have had restrictions in the first place. After shooting someone or getting shot, there should be an "in combat" cooldown that prevents fast travel for around 30 seconds, and that refreshes with shots taken or landing near you.
---
Thanks for the heads up, snagged myself a clean straightjacket and a hunter coat for friend.
---
It's just the same assets as were in the game, and fo4, already, but now buildable. But no point in putting effort in non atom stuff if it isn't gonna make you money right?
---
Also grind for the T-65 armor. You can have stealth and a jetpack on it, but you will have to use the camo paint to put the jetpack on the arms as the Stealth Boy only goes to the torso.
---
 "I had barely left the saddle and my foot just touched the ground, when a cold voice from the shadows told me not to turn around"
---
Sadly.
---
If I were running this operation,  I'd make a strict restriction that 2 non atom items need to be added to the game for every 1 atom shop item added.
---
Would be ideal to have them in new small quests or events, butane easier method could be to add them to a special rotating loot pool that's randomized each day to be included in any set of already existing loot pools, so they cant just be farmed out immediately but be earned from normal everyday game play.
---
Would give some otherwise neglected content like loot boxes or technical date turn ins more potential value.
---
If you have an excess of .38, then that‚Äôs a valid reason. And as far as the change in damage, you‚Äôll see that in the stat block to the left.
---
Would have been a nocturnal rolling pin anyway, not sure you missed out on much buddy.
---
I‚Äôm looking at funky duds and sizzling style but I‚Äôm not sure if they work with power armor. In fact, if a lot of them don‚Äôt work with power armor I‚Äôm likely to take the SPECIAL cards.
---
Since I am clueless, enlighten me.
---
Which features exactly were delayed ONLY on console?
---
Agreed. That should be a thing
---
They're booing you, but you're right. Stop carrying important junk, or stop dying around other people. If someone "robs" your loot bag it's your fault, not theirs. I don't think anything should drop at all when you die, that's a way better system then trying to add a bunch of weird revenge mechanics.
---
Ahhh clueless and wilfully argumentative. Goodbye x
---
I wonder if anyone ever tried to glitch into the storage room. üòÄ And then hear her response.üòÅ
---
Yep just inside near Meg!
---
Kneecap the hoe

üò©üò©üò©
---
it should say all models a paint can be applied in on the item's store page before you buy
---
Ooo that sounds awesome!
---
So many random players will help me out. The first one I interacted with crafted me a full set of deep-pocketed, BOS combat armor when I was about lvl 20 and also gave me three really powerful, customized guns plus a ton of ammo and aluminium. He had thousands of everything. 
---
I also frequently find thousands of rounds left for noobs in the briefcases at train stations and I will now leave already known recipes for people there. Pass on the love.
---
A better word would be inquest. They weren't lined up and shot enmass, each was interrogated before being executed.

---
I've had the "Pacifist" mode turned on since it became available, so don't think I ever saw a white tag.
---
For me PvP is workshop-only.
---
I did like the Survival mode, hoping they bring that back.
---
same here. i was going to say who wants presents!
---
I feel like most of the community bonded at the start when it became a meme to hop on the bandwagon of hating on the game.  It's not a new phenomenon in gaming reviews, but it was certainly a massive scapegoat by many people who never played it.  Don't get me wrong, the game has indeed had a myriad of issues/bugs/problems.  And it has it's griefers too, but in my experience playing since launch, they are not common.
---
I've definitely spent some quality time helping out new characters, and had the favor returned a number or times as well.  It's fun to drop some high end goodies for new players.  :)  Or just hop into a battle to turn the tides in favor of someone clearly overwhelmed by enemies.
---
Deathclaw Island?
---
If you‚Äôre a bloodied melee, just take cover behind something while she uses her laser attack. Then when she gets close to you, just use vats and melee attack her. Will take 1-2 hits at most. 
---
If you‚Äôre using shotgun, I believe the work is called ‚Äúenforcer‚Äù under agility. Aim at her legs and you‚Äôll most likely cripple her. She can still use her laser attack (she has for me a few times) but she will be slow, and easier to move around.  
---
I‚Äôm sure you can do the same with automatic rifles or heavy guns, but I only use shotguns and unarmed weapons.
---
It does, however I have come across multiple instances where it doesn't say it would but still does. The one that immediately comes to my head is the NW paints, it says all PA but it doesn't cover T-65.
---
Pacifist in settings. I think it helps prevent that sort of stuff unless you are at a workshop you are claiming/have claimed.
---
So just not post then? Why would anyone post anything anymore? Not all 7 billion inhabitants of this beautiful little planet of ours are one reddit. 
---
Oh, and /s for the record. Just don‚Äôt get the point of your remark.
---
Good comunity exist when the game is not a major one in the market.
---
I think the bandwagon hate made the community unite together.
---
If you‚Äôre at max caps, script, gold, and you decided to claim the rewards, then unfortunately you‚Äôll still receive them, but not really. 
---
So it‚Äôs not like your caps will go from 30,000 to 30,100
---
Your script won‚Äôt go from 1,000 to 1,100
---
So before you claim your currency reward, make sure you spend it on something.
---
Edit- I forgot to mention. If you haven‚Äôt completed wastelanders quest, you can SAFELY claim it. You‚Äôll receive it. You won‚Äôt be able to spend it obviously because you haven‚Äôt unlocked the good vendors and currency yet. However you will safely store in on your person. Once you complete wastelander‚Äôs you‚Äôll be able to spend it.
---
Tell that to new players that think getting killed at a workshop is grounds to report somebody since they didn't read the giant warning label that pops up when you go to claim one.  
---
While we're at it why don't we remove all warning labels and warning signs IRL? I mean, who even NEEDS to be told things? Amateurs, I tell ya! /sic
---
I don't think one wasteland is gonna trouble us much at camp.
---
I built pretty close to the bog (one side is unaccessible, which obviously helps), near a high level random encounter point (lvl 90 deathclaws and the likes...), the encounter doesn't happen anymore and I rarely get attacked by lvl 10/15 rubbish that my pet and ally get rid of comfortably.
---
I think a big factor aggro-wise is how much electricity your camp use. I ditched the fusion generator, the water purifiers and I have no turrets. Full camp runs on 3 small vault tec stackable (best thing ever) generators that power up 3 vendors and a lot of bulbs and lights that do not require a full unit of electricity to run.
---
It's a pretty quiet life really... üòä
---
could be because the T65 came out after they did. currently exclusive paints work for it and the model swapping ones work for it.
---
As a new Fallout player, I'll definitely keep this in mind and keep storing junk like a paranoid hoarder lol
---
If ya ever see Necro Apache out there in the Xbox Appalachian, stop on by, my home is your home.
---
Just stop being a foodbuild
---
Word , word , word and done .
---
True but I believe in the beginning the NW paints did not work for Ultracite and they changed that. So i'm wondering if some atom shop paints got the same treatment is all. The revolutionary paint came out a bit ago and don't know if anything is changed.
---
Kinda borderline unethical but if I‚Äôm super low on caps and need to travel a lot I just hop teams until I hit one with a camp near where I‚Äôm going...sorry to all the teams I hop in and out of üò≥
---
I have sets of both but I won‚Äôt be home until 6:30est
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper. A piece of gear makes me invisible when crouched.    
---
I start sneaking from some distance and when I see it, I target its legs. From there headshots until dead.
---
I'm in a que to join the world. Hopefully it doesn't take forever
---
Ok so I have similar issue was trying to place the perfect( ik stupid idea....) kept trying and moving camp... now I have 11% ghost storage and I can't seem to get rid of it... it had to have been at least 25 machines over all... i actually found a way to blueprint them perfect and make it so they don't change orientation when placed but I gota clear that 11% first any ideas???? I tried moving my camp a few times no change...
---
I just bought the plans for it.so idk but I see alot of people rocking it
---
No your a foodbuild 1v1 me on ps4 so I can take more junk off of you foodys
---
I have both and am on now.
---
I keep my CAMP not too far N Of the Wayward. Travel Agent. Pop from my camp to one, do the quest back to CAMP and do the other. I'll also group asap and look for their camps near where I need to go.
---
Yes but I am on Ps4
---
I'll leave hopefully you'll join
---
Gotcha thought it was every 50 levels
---
They never have cool Apparel for me
---
West side of the map is reasonably safe. Try to build off from a cliff so that most of your camp hangs over. Or try a river location. This way you only need to defend from one side and also avoid the Scorchbeast and the Nukes.
---
I see your point and I read your other comment that it was actually explained, so I am wrong on this one. My general point though is not to have bugs that people need to explain for themselves, which is what I (incorrectly) thought this was.
---
Maybe, just maybe....hold on...hear me out....maybe, they dont care about your playstyle of the game. Maybe that have their own goals to make instead of placating to someone else's. I mean...great xp vs. Not so great....to each it own
---
Yeah I'm in thanks, do you want me to leave after so you can join back?
---
Yep. Store the flux first, then loot the queen!
---
Some knob looted me for my screws during Colossal Problem
---
Where else do you think the overseer got the money to build that little bunker of hers?
---
Try Alpha for the Yao Guai Ghoul. I've seen two there this week. Only time I've ever seen a Chameleon Deathclaw was at the power station north of Watoga.
---
No you're ok.
---
If you‚Äôre grinding for XP, then you also want to collect ore because ore drops are what triggers the better spawns.
---
It's a pretty solid gun, mine is magic though so it may be better than your average gauss.
---
So I'm confused we baby them because they choose not to read? Or we dont?
---
I‚Äôd rather see that shit, then floating houses held up by a fucking ladder and wooden platform
---
Also, it takes maybe 2 minutes to gather ore. The extra XP from the deathclaws and floaters more than balances it out.
---
Done
---
It is a dick thing to say. However. You're not wrong. At a certain point there's nothing left to do. I havent hit it but it has to be there. And i would be very ungrateful if you did that to me. I had it done to me. It sucked.
---
Carrots are light and Take up little room in my dirt tiles only reason I didn‚Äôt take melons is because they are big when planting and heavy for food
---
Hell yes! Now I have a legacy!
---
I like tech, I like power armor, they got it.
---
I would prefer they not be assholes and I hope they're a bit kinder than most BoS. But if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I call one of my alts a BoS fanboy, naive and hoping they're good guys.
---
I'm on right now too, gt is same as on here. How much for the standing? I have the sitting already
---
I feel like Ammo is the main perk
---
I am level 92 and fell behind on my quests just screwing around so I have been catching up on them and as a result I ended up with several pounds of plans I already knew. I think it is the polite right thing to do to put a few up for sale for 3 caps or less so people cant get easy score points. The remaining ones, I just wait til I see a level 25 or less player and I fast travel to them. First I give the wave emote, quickly drop all the known plans I have (even good ones), back up and shoot the bag emote give the follow me emote until they pick them up. If someone gave me a stimpak recipe at level 10 I would of liked it! Lol
---
The only difference between the two is you'll be repairing the flamer every 6 seconds as opposed the the gatling every 9.
---
Performance wise lowering shadows is probably easiest way to increase performance, but I don't have example since I value my shadows...
---
Game-play wise, Grass can be removed, unfortunately I haven't found a way to shorten it or reduce density instead
---
    [Grass]
---
    bAllowCreateGrass=0
---
Other than performance settings, here are some that are self explanatory
---
    [General]

    sIntroSequence=

    uMainMenuDelayBeforeAllowSkip=0
---
    bPlayMainMenuMusic=0
---
It makes me wonder if people would still be nice if the game was tougher and not so broken at the start. Cause I feel all this generosity is geared toward keeping people around, and to help them ignore how buggy things tend to be. Obviously the game is in a much better state. But it still... it makes me wonder. 
---
 maybe it's because I was looking forward to a lot of toxic players, and getting revenge on people messing with my CAMP and items, since this is a survival game too.
---
I love gifting deep pocketed leather armor and explosive bows with arrows for lvl 5 peeps. really turns the tides on terms of surviving.
---
Wow so this is why my favorite guns are almost useless. Great.
---
Flamer - Deals fire damage (currently not many enemies have fire resist), much power, breaks quickly, kinda expensive to make ammo for
---
Plasma - Enegry damage, cheapish ammo, beam splitter for more pellets
---
Maybe my friends and I are just getting old (we're really not), but we were all blown away enough by playing Fallout online, together, with our own characters that we made with plans to use different play styles that none of the issues with the game mattered.
---
Ken-digo
---
Maybe because they are not in the game right now? Only is/was on PTS for testing purposes.
---
I have level 5 gunsmith and level 2 luck of the draw. It‚Äôs not that bad. Plus the best weapon in the game don‚Äôt have great durability. Stop being butthurt because you don‚Äôt have a legacy lmao.
---
I also changed Quick Hands to Serendipity. I think that's better for bloodied.
---
Ah I see. Thanks!
---
One of my characters has a camp on the road north of the overseers camp, and every time I go there a pack of dogs spawns and if I dont go and kill them first they will level my camp before my turrets even consider opening fire.  I've said it since the beta, I'll say it till addictol is real and I can kick this shit, Bethesda needs to buff our fucking turrets.  If I could only build one turret in a shopping cart but it was as aggressive and strong as the turrets in Harper's Ferry, I'd be over the moon.
---
Sounds like a good spot for high levels, too. Thanks!
---
I replaced the fasnacht one. I was starting to hate the repetitiveness of "i just love songs, don't you"
---
But how do you know they saw it?
---
Me being a pvper sitting here like üëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
You're getting excellent practice for when the treasure hunter event is actually here.
---
No joke what's food build?
---
Haha mine was like that until I could get settled in the game a bit.  There was just so many other things to do.
---
Hey man I play on PC, if you need help with anything at all just let me know :D
---
its mainly for lower levels that have 38, and not a lot of 45, at the penalty of a lot of damage.
---
if you gave 45 this is useless and actually detrimental
---
Newish player here, did something very similar to this myself! Watching this made me feel like mine is lacking quite a bit though. Thanks for the inspiration OP. Ad Victoriam.
---
I‚Äôve spent almost 400 hours in game, and I‚Äôve only really met like one or two real assholes, which surprised me.
---
Stash weight, all day
---
I have 2 fixers (stronger version of the combat rifle). One chambered in .45 which is my big boi gun. And one chambered in .38 which is my shoot everything that fuckin‚Äô moves gun. And because .38 is extremely common, not that .45 isnt, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm not going to waste .45 on a Lv6 ghoul.
---
I‚Äôm in the savage divide and level 10 mongrels attack my level 15 turrets and destroy them I can‚Äôt wait until one wasteland when my entire base is destroyed by a level 100 radroach
---
your a super foodbuild especially for asking whats a foodbuild
---
Oh you're one of THOSE people...
---
I am constantly killed by some asshat after the SBQ event using what i can only assume is a assassins tesla rifle/shotgun. I ended up resorting to buying plans and everything else from other players. I would've loved to get revenge on him/her if it wasn't for them fast traveling instantly after jacking my flux
---
Strangle heart, the AoE will tag enemies nearby for you with its poison AoE.
---
T65 is quite good but it has no cool effect and the DR difference doesn't make a lot of difference in actual gameplay. Not to mention you have to buy all mod plans with bullion. SH uses ultracite plans.
---
I swear the mounted wendigo on my wall just talked to me.
---
It makes sense if you want to be able to place your camp pretty much wherever you want, but yeah its a bit immersion breaking. But again, its a multiplayer game and I'm not trying to dictate how people want to play. I just love seeing unique camps
---
if you go flamer, only two mods you need are Napalm canister, and Vaporizer nozzle. both boost damage and with the Explosive effect the range isn't an issue. anything else IMO makes the durability too small
---
I think the workshops are fun but one big collective one somewhere on the map would be dope
---
Its in the atom shop , last tap
---
Always pissed me off that we can somehow build rocket turrets from a few scrapped desk fans and wires but we can't make em turn a full 360 degrees circle.
---
Nah I totally get it. In the beginning especially you need a homebase where you can craft what you need to continue your questing.
---
Edit: its also hard when you have the barr minimum plans. When I started by alt I realized how hard it was to make the camps I had been making on my main. Another reason I try amd sell all my common camp plans for 25c
---
believe it should be in the atomic shop on the very last page where the frwe stuff is usually at.
---
Thank the Fallout Gods for AngryyTurtle üê¢
---
I read somewhere that we should be able to do that at some point. Unfortunately I dont remember where; so I got nothin‚Äô to back up my answer. But hey, here‚Äôs to hopes it wasnt wrong.
---
Entitled fucking trash... I'm with ya
---
I hated having it just flung around too lol
---
I've done that to all of the rooms in the Rusty Pick. You can't pick up any of the gear and she doesn't say anything, but it's very interesting just to have a look around. She has LOADS of legendary scrip laying around as world objects (which you can't pick up).
---
[The fortune teller machine is pretty cool too.](https://i.gyazo.com/af922f12568f63ac1e882a7d689499c5.jpg) It's wearing a mole miner mask and is filled with legendary scrip.
---
Trolls are like the worst ones
---
Hehehe,does that silly BoS expedition force know what is inside the Whitesprings bunker &gt;:)
---
I‚Äôve fallen in love with building a small camp building that looks more lived in // something you‚Äôd probably see that‚Äôs more realistic. But yea exactly to each their own! I‚Äôve seen some stunning builds that blow me away and remind me why I love the camp / settlement designs in fallout
---
Sorry cornpop, but come on man!
---
Bugio and Lagigi
---
I did check out the tadpole ones a while ago, but given everything else i could do it is sorta a last resort if i get really bored. As far as farming rep, meh. My usual routine is trying to get rid of legendaries for script, then killing super mutants for assault rifles and either selling or scrapping em. Then if i have time for treasury notes, i do that. Still stuck on completing unyielding ss armor set, so not as much of a priority on the treasury notes as it is having caps to buy new weapons!
---
Just search Google... but here you go you lazy bastard :)

---
I‚Äôve always wondered why do you guys think the community on fo76 is so positive?
---
 because I‚Äôve not had a single bad experience yet online and I‚Äôve met hundreds and hundreds of players in my time now and everyone of them is always so giving and now I just walk around and I see someone lower level than me and I dump as much stuff on them as possible. It feels amazing to give a level 20 50+ plans and watch as they react to the gift.
---
I wish they would just leave everything in the store so people can get what they want ! and STOP taking stuff away !!
---
I would like to see the Long Haul perk come back.
---
T-65 but if you can‚Äôt get that run t-51b it has the highest dmg resist x-01 is bad because there aren‚Äôt much enemies that use energy weapons
---
And you would think he'd go into your stash and take your energy ammo. Shooting at you while doing it.
---
I just wish there was a macro for switching weapons and it automatically swapping out assigned perks you want for that weapon
---
Building settlements was the reason I kept playing Fo4. When I could share my camps in real time with other players, I stepped my game up that lived in cluttered feel is my main ascetic
---
Wait what?
---
It's something that isn't too uncommon for most MMO RPGs, having ways of obtaining cosmetics trough grind or gameplay at random, but them being there permanently. You go to specific areas to do specific quests for specific types of items. 
---
In fo76 it's just, do this anywhere on the map for any random amount of a single currency, that unlocks all of the cosmetics, but they are available only a limited amount of time. 
---
It's like they had the goal of making that cosmetic grind as least appealing as possible. There is no goal, there is no theme, no greater direction. It's all unrelated actions to locations to items. That's not how you keep people playing your game.
---
This is what I was expecting from them, yet both do the same.
---
Melee does plenty of damage as is, they can have more than just flap limb affect their damage.
---
Bloodied is one hell of a drug
---
üòÉ
---
Apparently the best receiver for a hunting rifle is the hasty .50 cal - better ROF with only a tiny bit less damage than hardened .308.

The grind sucks no mater what way you slice it :(
---
The famous one night stand. I wake up and she's gone. Or she didn't ever lay with me in the first place and my character just dreams of it. Pret sure commander dag keeps saying she cant shake these nightmares cuz she's out there sleeping with a bunch of mutated men. But sure, i'll take the xp bonus
---
It would be fun to all work cooperatively on one space, building it up a la Foundation. Problem is it would have to be static somehow and not go away when you log off or when the server shuts down.
---
Ok thanks for the advice!
---
But.. I do love songs. LOL
---
I will try but I'm pretty sure it doesn't count
---
take photos of crater for davenport and sell them to ward (overseer house)
---
I have never bothered using any of the sneak cards and as long as I am careful I don't have many issues. I just use cloaking  scout armour and silenced weapons. I also have 20 agi
---
Well I can't even glitch into my own camp üòÅ tried photomode and armor exit. Not sure what am I doing wrong but I sure feel lame.ü§ì
---
Is it possible to die in just a couple seconds though if you're at 70% hp? I had a feeling it was a hacker.
---
I just dont understand the 6x6 houses with 1 crafting bench placed on every wall with nothing at all in the 4x4 space in the middle
---
Has Beth or Lord sith Todd ever said why they take from the sale.
---
Maybe a global workspace?
---
Whats your offer
---
Well workshops outlast their owners for an indeterminate amount of time especially if enough people come through and keep claiming it. It would be up to the big brains st Bethesda to figure it out but I feel like it could be done.
---
side with the settlers in a fight at conflict spots vs whatever shows up to kill them....help them win and talk with them....they give a small boost
---
Rattle hands should make you lose 25% accuracy with guns, losing damage doesn‚Äôt really make sense. Fever claw should be -25% melee damage
---
Heh, i set across the pond from the Alpha silo, i love that there's almost always a lvl76 yao gai eating my collectron while the 2 turrets i decided to not scrap don't fire a single round untill i run out to kill the bloody thing.
---
They think if they create an artificial ‚Äòscarcity‚Äô, players will FOMO-buy. Maybe a few low levels did bite.
---
I just watched a youtube video explaining how to do it using power armor. That's much easier to do than the photomode method.
---
A village area would be so cool!
---
Whew!
---
That is an amazing idea, would be dangerous with nukashine though lol
---
Wow, that is one creepy fortuneteller! Like Robert the haunted doll. Would be cool to hear fortunes told for wastelanders though ü§ì
---
stash weight reduction
---
The BoS became the tech hoarding isolationists from Fallout 1 and 2 due to their base in Appalachia being constantly nuked by the the former residents of Vault 76.
---
True.  I'd rather fight them in a workshop.  Seems more honorable and less cowardly.  He has to pick on the low level or just unsuspecting people to feel big.
---
Find new friends.
---
The most efficient way to get lead is to mine the ore in the lucky hole with excavator power armor and smelt it at a chemistry bench.  1200ish lead in one trip.
---
Coming this Octoberbto an Atom shop near you, the Festive Halloween Wendigo Pinata! Only 1800 Atoms folks.
---
I honestly think it is because a lot of us are looking for some variation on a Sims in the Wasteland idea. We want to have fun and want others too as well.  
---
I think that is why PVP never took off in a huge way. I am older and will never be good enough to enjoy PVP.
---
You need to enable pacifist mode in the options, that way your stray bullets don't cause you to engage in PvP.
---
Aim for the chest, not head - they have much higher dr on their heads.
---
ammo and junk so far
---
They should also fix friendly fire in events, ive been killed sometimes in events by people also doing the event, i shoot them on accident if the go in front of me and theyll kill me, itw so annoying
---
And we will light you up brighter than the Fourth of July! Ad Victorium!
---
Wow you're fucking stupid
---
Thanks, I will try to learn more about it. The videos on Youtube make it look so easy üòÄ
---
Still have no idea. I heard some players still have stacked punji boards on their camps (heard that the ability to stack them was patched). They glitch those somehow in the floor and when you step in your get in one second the damage of like 30 punji boards at once. I went back there (since was out of any junk anyway) and for science I died more two times. Still couldn't figure out how that was happening.
---
Lucky hole is the only way to go imho
---
All good points but most people who have been at this a while have more than enough junk anyway. The point is your stuffs gone and the person who has got it needs to die as well. Then again how does he know you havent just dropped it if he stumbles across it? I think on balance its all fair game really
---
How about a timer before the bag can be looted, like other games.  5 min or so should be far.
---
Nope, you have to manually pick a perk, then scrap it.
---
Nope, nothing you can do your budget is gone. Up to date there is no known fix for it it. Next time you are thinking about trying a glitch do a bit of research first.
---
Same here. You put words on my thoughts
---
Is that you Joe?
---
Totally noob question, but owlet? I don't understand.
---
Check the Bethesda forum, there was an issue.. they fixed it
---
Good luck üòÅ as I hear the Megasloth is going to be friendly in patch 22.
---
[he says... ](http://imgur.com/gallery/9JvXcFm)
---
Half of my stash is shitty legendaries I can‚Äôt sell so either one I feel like would end up lowering my stash weight! Damn Grumbles not letting dump as many 1 * troubleshooters pipe wrench as I want on him...wtf?!?
---
Slocum Joe? You bet!
---
Next instalment of Five Nights at Freddy is looking dope!
---
yall could not even handle a bat the first time.
---
at least the enclave got killed by a cool evil AI and not some dumb pink bat named Barbra. 
---
enclave has an **ORBITAL WEAPONS PLATFORM** in **SPACE.**
---
what does bos have? some pew pews and a pile or cork. yeah, not impressed.
---
I‚Äôve still got a guy‚Äôs tag written down whose camp I‚Äôm going to nuke if I ever end up on the same server with him again because he stole my junk after ACP.
---
That's not correct.
---
The reason she doesn't land is because she's aggro'd on a Player that's standing on a Fence, Tent, or an otherwise "Too Small" structure. Her programming basically tells her "You can't get to them on the ground, so stay in the air."
---
It's the same system that makes enemies run away from you if you're standing somewhere they can't get to.
---
This is why I beefed up my character and ensure I'm always doing the most to aggro her, while standing in a big open area. She ALWAYS lands that way.
---
It depends how much you value money and how much you value a games content.
---
Yes i find that it's worth it because i pick up every junk item I see so the unlimited junk capacity and the ability to plop down a tent for stash box and the junk box makes it worth it.
---
I'm glad to see (atleaat so far) that there aren't any hateful post about player such as myself that like to join the ACP with a Fatty Mirv and pocket (100+)full of mini nukes for the sheer joy of watching those green bodies fly all overbthe place.
---
Thanks for the suggestions on where to build and items to remove, but I don‚Äôt want to limit myself every time I build a new camp. I think a simple perception buff to turrets and npcs would prevent this problem, and would solve the issue of low level enemies unfairly destroying my camp due to bad AI mechanics.
---
Nat bad idea. Make it long enough for my slow ass ps4 to load again lol
---
I will give it a shot. I thought they needed to be scorched versions so I never went looking.
---
It‚Äôs a good gun but the ammo is pretty expensive to make
---
Sure, someone with the right build and weapons can deal a 1000 damage per shot, even if only a percentage of that damage is counted it is still way more than most of us have at full health.
---
Agreed. Take out the legs as fast as you can with whatever you got. Then she's stuck crawling around, so you can find a safe spot, heal up, and go tag her, rinse and repeat. The tough part in the beginning is you can't really dodge the laser beam (so I've discovered) but you can kinda stay out of range of her melee.
---
Side note: anyone else notice that even if you sidestep the laser beam, it still hits you for full damage? I thought I was a ninja and dodged it, but according to the numbers it managed to nail me regardless. Seems kinda shitty.
---
That what I was thinking I always run out of space in the stash box and if I‚Äôm honest I can‚Äôt help but constantly want to buy the atoms as much as I know I‚Äôm being knocked with them lol
---
Joking aside, there is a tax on our sales? I alwats wonder why my sells not exactly the same prices as the one i put first.
---
I think both happen, because I've seen her stagger in the air
---
I got like 140 unused/picked, sounds like fun, hope it will be worth it as so far what I have seen on the PTS   for legendary perks are not too impressive.
---
Are you saying I should change all my handles to cornpop, because I kind of dig it
---
Yeah help I'm locked in my basement.....i think?
---
someone else suggested near ohio river adventures
---
Yeah but if she starts the landing animation and gets staggered she doesn't land and continues to fly around, so the combination of both things makes her never land
---
i wonder of lyons actual made thing worse in the end, by allowing the more hardline elements of the brotherhood to point to the more altruistic attitude and declare it wrong there in galvanizing the more fundamentalist elements going forward.
---
in the end it seems either lyons failed, or his ideas were snuffed out. but the hardliners now have an airship so they must be right i guess lol.
---
I feel like this one is unique though. Like most people playing are just long time elder scrolls/fallout fans giving this thing a chance. Posts like this about being apprehensive of online games. 
---
I feel like the player base of this game is just a different kind of animal than most online games. I think most people who play this would have rather just had a another full single player fallout experience. 
---
So pvp sweaty douches and griefer types that even tried the game, mostly moved on very quickly. What‚Äôs left is a different type of player than most other online games.
---
The foundation gives you a fertilizer maker and the crater gives you an ammo maker.
---
Only if you are a bad dude, who runs with a bad crew
---
I finally have chinese stealth, so I can go gather ore as well. I'm on PC, maybe we'll get lucky and end up in the same place and can get most of the ore at least.
---
I would agree with you if VATS worked and was our way of shooting, and explosive weapons wouldn't trigger PVP (like splash damage).  
---
Problem is: VATS is not great and unintentional splash damage is just that, unintentional.  
---
PVP needs to have restrictions because of the fundamental limitations in the game engine. Until you can confidently ONLY shoot what you intended, PVP needs restrictions.
---
I am that arse that doesn't bother collecting ore, sorry I just need to farm xp.
---
Hell you shoulda seen this place pre-wastelanders...it was a living hell of a sub, the amount of toxic bullshit was unbearable.
---
How did he know I didn't jettison it? Probably the taunting after
---
What about whwn im standing in the middle of an empty field on a private server and she only lands twice during the 30 minute fight?
---
A lot goes to Chameleon Deathclaws to resupply areas with items.
---
Well i do have the leather jacket outfit..
---
Roll the dice!
---
Ultimately, siding with foundation or crater doesn‚Äôt affect anything other than give a slight reputation boost when you complete the wastelanders quest. 
---
You‚Äôll be able to get all the items from raiders (ammo machine), and all the items from settlers (turbofert machine, farmable dirt tiles) regardless of which path you choose. All wastelanders daily missions will still be available.
---
Whether your decision will affect the Brotherhood of Steel‚Äôs treatment of you, is unknown so far. They may treat settler siders as pushovers, and may treat raider siders as monsters. But thats just speculation on my part, and we‚Äôll have to see with the coming updates.
---
smoke machine, floor decor, and switches are all huge red flags for traps.  also get some explosive bait, nuke that base
---
Does a bear #$@¬£ in the woods?
---
I feel so bad when I accidentally loot someone's bag when I'm looking for mine. I did it yesterday to a teammate and I was so embarrassed I gave him my two legendaries that I'd gotten from Scorched Earth and killing the Wendigo Collosus. 
---
If we could have like a tag on the bags so we know who's bag it is that would be helpful.
---
When you died it is not your stuff anymore so it is not stealing If you want it emote PVP and he doesn't accept it he can leave because you didn't understand the concept it is wrong
---
"Testing" at your camp but not theirs or at a workshop? Sounds like they found a sucker and called him a friend :(
---
Your 11% of storage is forfeit indefinitely.
---
Elder Maxson is the ancestor of Elder Maxson
---
Idk what the price is on it. Couple hundred caps I'm guessing?
---
*badge you know what I mean
---
You got my vote üòà
---
Best guess? Maxon is a last name.
---
Less damage output, meaning the gun breaks slower in theory. For most powerful builds you can one shot a ghoul with the 38 receiver still.
---
That would be amazing. I've taken some pretty hilarious photos worth displaying at my camp
---
Arthur Maxson is from FO4, Roger Maxson is the founder.
---
Alright thanks for clearing that up I haven‚Äôt played my other fallout but 3 and 76
---
This. Melee runs in and I am blasting away outside of vats. Next thing I know the gamer 200 levels higher than me has gone aggro because that was their whole intention all along. Get some SQB, kill some weenie players.
---
To ‚ÄúHobo_Eric‚Äù on PS4:  Suck a bag of dicks.
---
Does explosive bait still work?  Someone go destroy that CAMP.
---
Hmm.. im not sure coffee can help with that. Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
I‚Äôm a big hoarder of junk so yes! 
---
So nice to be out exploring for hours and being able to set up your survival tent and having access to the scrap box.
---
The atoms each month are a good bonus too as I love buying new cosmetics/CAMP items
---
We probably get standard things and atom shop variants, like with the other display cases.
---
You‚Äôll get more XP if the deathclaws spawn because the ore‚Äôs been collected...
---
What if your just grinding for salt?
---
Which also triggered them coming to Appalachia as "these people are worse then monkeys with grenade since they don't kill themselves in the process", the time paradox have been ensued!
---
My entire stash is pretty good or great legendaries. My problem is I dont have room for anymore.
---
I let him cuz neither of us knew that was a consequence of it. If either of of us would have known we would have used the workshop. I dident have the blueprint or in all honestly i would have done it my self. Dident realize that it killed ur storage.
---
Maybe, but I have run it properly and just killing ghouls and each time j get a lot more xp from just popping ghouls
---
I know, I'm just saying a chance to win it back would be cool
---
Admittedly I don't play much but I probably have atleast 40 hours. Never have I seen the insult bot. Now by this logic he hasn't come up with something yet cause I'm too good or I'm so bad at the game he just doesn't waste his time with me. Lol
---
Thanks to you, I got my full unyielding set with &lt;30 rolls (in my character's lifetime) by relying on pools: roll 1 piece to see if it's unyielding, if not, swap server or wait a couple of hours. 
---
Once I got my first unyielding piece, I kept rolling and got 4 other unyielding piece along with [some other stuff](https://i.imgur.com/uLqbDnj.png) (1x exterminator, 1x ghoul slayer, 1x hunter, 1x mutant slayer, 1x mutant, 3x troubleshooter, 3x weightless and 1x zealots). I would've rolled more if I didn't run out of plastic (no fo1^(st) scrapbox so stash space is super limited).
---
I've noticed that I've gotten rolls from both of your proposed "pools" within the same short time window (i.e. unyielding -&gt; troubleshooter -&gt; weightless -&gt; mutant slayer -&gt; unyielding x2). I have no idea what the significance of this is, but I'm providing some data in case it's useful.
---
I‚Äôm a messy build. I‚Äôm commando but also have 6 strength points towards heavy guns.  
---
My bloodied explosive Gatling plasma hits hard man. Not much gimping going on.
---
I want your box lol
---
I did this in the small lake down the road from foundation! Also mirelurk spawns, kill the big ones and start picking up eggs, kill them until you find a diseased one and let it munch on your leg. Im guessing any place with mirelurk spawns will do
---
Tip: take radx to suppress your mutations, especially if you have the one where enemies hit you they get hurt? Forgot the name
---
Also if you‚Äôre hungry and thirsty it increases the chance of you getting a disease.
---
I did this and got The woopsies in two minutes üëçüèº
---
I enabled it once and never disabled it. I'm not really a pvp person. I like my adventures. You can still be murdered in pacifist mode tho. It just takes a minute. But with the tesla guns i found myself not being able to run away before it ended up killing me.
---
I just want to be able to find a person's vending machines without having to look all over the place! To me, vending should be placed somewhere that it can be found easily upon fast travel. (Signs and arrows help too!)
---
&gt; to make the call on what should be kept from people
---
FEV was that starting point, as well the whole Nuclear Armageddon thing
---
If you like grabbing cans, I used to do this run:
---
Top of the world: 9
---
Hawk's refuge: 5
---
Sunny Top Ski lanes: 4
---
huh?
---
No.
---
And then there are the pvp players leveling camps..
---
Well I like the idea. The bag should become "steal" and if someone picks something out it should start pvp but not against everyone only on you.. Wanted would be overkil.
---
The Runescape PvP model might be worth consideration for people into it.
---
Make a new region and give it some really good resources to make it worthwhile to risk the trip. The region will have PVP fully enabled without slap hits, death will carry a higher risk, and player-killers will get a higher reward for killing people.  Perhaps turn off fast-travel in the area.  
---
Outside of the area, PVP will just be fully turned off
---
Its a curse though. I cant get the stuff I want with them.
---
Insurgent outfit from treasure hunt makes you look like a good build
---
Yes, but also no. If someone has a cool multibuilding design, I kind of like searching through the camp to find them/explore the base. Now if theyre like hidden in a back room, then no
---
You need to take workshops more often so we can show you the dark side...... üòà
---
Me and my brother were literally among the first to exit the vault, there was no-one to greet us, but I love the world ever since and I like to help nice people especially of low levels
---
Get the travel agent perk.. it will make traveling a bit cheaper if maxed all the way out. If you have fallout first set up your tent near the one you go to the most and you can do like others have said and set your camp near the other. I did see that the foundation and crater will become free fast travel points in a future update.
---
The Insurgent stuff is edible?
---
I'll have to craft a bunch more and put them in my Vendors for cheap if people can eat them!
---
No, with pacifist mode enabled you can't take any ballistic/explosive/energy damage from other players. The only way is to nuke mine or there is a way to do it with explosive bait. 
---
For them to shoot you with any weapon and cause damage you must have shot them first.  (Outside of workshop PvP that is)
---
There used to be a greatly reduced amount of damage but Bethesda scrapped it because of griefing.
---
Feed!
---
It's not the same bigot, this is Super-Great-Grandpappy bigot!
---
Practice at workshops against other players.  That will refine your skills!   üòà
---
I know everyone hated the matching armor ballistic perk but that's the one I wanted.
---
And FO3, where he was much less of a jerk!
---
PLEASE whatever you do, play both factions' quests until the game forces you to decide in order to proceed with the overall story.  Siding with the raiders before going as far as you can with Foundation will cost you big $$ (in bullions) in the long run for a nifty armor you would get free otherwise.
---
Nope. However Shelters in Winter will give u near unlimited budget as the devs say.
---
Like I [have my 2 vendors](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/in6fpe/decided_to_make_a_little_lore_friendly_shop?sort=top) in separate houses, but its because im trying to create shops
---
Ah figures, one more loading screen. Appreciate the info!
---
Which do you want sooner/faster? The raiders hauss minigun/ammo maker or the settlers chinese stealth suit/farm tiles/turbofert machine. Choose that side and get A big reputation boost.
---
I dropped 50 100% fusion cores just because i needed the stash weight. But i sometimes make a full heavy leather armor fully upgraded and deep pocketed. A shielded underarmor ( i have 100's of stable flux) and give is to a low lvl player. Incl a .50 full modded hunting rifle and 2500 rounds
---
1k might not be enough :)
---
Or we just don't ‚ù§.  Just shoot me
---
https://youtu.be/xo6d5AzXqIY
---
This took 2 minutes to do - right outside Foundation.  Easy peasy.
---
Seriously
---
You can collect in PA as well and the radiation showers are in the middle help to rid yourself from the rads.
---
I agree. I know on here I get a little grouchy, but it's just me blowing off steam but with a smile. But once I'm in-game that all goes away and it's back to the reality of it. A killer community that supports each other.
---
This community is really good. Almost everyone actively helps each other. The normal online dickbags of other games seem really few and far between here. I‚Äôm actually surprised when someone acts like a douche in this game. 
---
You are missing out on playing events with other players, generally the most rewarding activities in game.
---
‚ÄúPeople are no damned good‚Äù you are self defeating with this attitude. It is simply not true.
---
It's been quite some time since the holiday events. I better not see them damn head plans in your vendor. At least not for more than 20 caps. Lol
---
Go talk to Brenda at Camden to light your day with Mr. Fuzzy joy! :)
---
Yea this is what I meant just a chance to win it back not wanted status. They claimed the junk, I don't wanna sit there like getting taunted for it too.
---
When he was wee lad
---
An "easy" upgrade you could do is to change your pet as, according to the wiki, the sloth is non aggressive, shortsighted and won't help anyone so, theoretically, it won't attack random enemies unless they attack him first.
---
But yeah, do as you want of course, just saying there are options available. üòä
---
Or just show up to events and opt out and get in the way of a bullet to engage pvp!!! üòà üíò
---
Yes glad this helps! I have to update my post the pools are in no way static and it's misleading...
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm remembering correctly but aren‚Äôt we possibly getting instanced camps or faults for 1st members down the line?
---
I have the giftwrapped box as my drop bag, also I place it so it's out in the open so it's hopefuly noticed. In the end tho I don't know but that's ok.
---
Hey bastard NOBODY CARES
---
Nuke the persons camp
---
Couple thousand to be more precise...like 15-20k
---
Thanks mate, BTW you can't tame the deathclaw on the island
---
Yeah it's a chore. I have like 80 treasury notes and every day i log in and get the 200B and 150 scrip. I have my full s.s unyielding complete. All tadpole all possum. Max rep at settler/raider. All mutation serum recipes. Every stable flux at least 300. Now i try to get every power armor mod.
---
I personally love when it never even spawns.
---
Definitely! They do have a few matching armor cards coming I believe, they just give you resistance to specific elements like fire üî•and poison ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Perhaps during events, have it so your death loot is unclaimable by anyone, but you , after the event ends for maybe 5 mins or so.
---
Doesn't deserve the bag
---
I once had a guy steal my stuff. He had like 50 lvls on me.
---
So i initiated pvp. He thought he could kill me. 
---
Well he was a bloodied melee build vs my furious melee build. All i had to do was avoid getting hit and whittle down his allready tiny healthpool.
---
Pretty sure they were being sarcastic.
---
Deathclaw island doesn‚Äôt work, it has to be in a specific location, search in here for random encounters location or tame locations? Someone shared a map a while ago with all the spots in the map üëçüèº
---
As much as it sucks that it's not just automatic for everyone I believe its so only players that were active during the event can get it and not just anyone who has the game but hasn't played for 6 months and doesn't pick it up for another year has all these rewards for things they didn't take part in
---
Insults.
---
Delay. Delay never changes.
---
I think patch 22 is bringing them to all. A mininvault door you can build at your current camp
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bprp84/robot\_armour\_plans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bprp84/robot_armour_plans/)
---
i found mine at lost home and nar repair yard. but they are rare. i find other rare plans easier.
---
Thanks for this info! What would you recommend I change my pet to, a deathclaw?
---
Thanks for info.  I sometimes put a big rug down if I have an empty space because I want to break up the empty look.  I hope others don't worry when they look around my place.  Pretty much everything is open to visitors.  I always like having at least a small space of privacy however.
---
So a collectron and an insult bot combined? What a deal!
---
I get that completely
---
Waiting for ammo factory to start making ammo.
---
That would be cool. I got pretty excited for the original Zeta DLC back in the day. Ended up making an alien themed quest mod for New Vegas too. I guess I like the idea of aliens interacting with a militarized post-apocalypse setting. I wanted to make a sequel to my quest mod where some aliens turn to the wasteland for help, since the circumstances generate a bunch of unstoppable badasses.
---
I'm only level 118 but I try to help out anyone I can. More often than not, I have to chase down the player I'm trying to help out.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs driving me nuts. I just want to finish this lol. I have all the other parts. I will try that out, thanks
---
"stuff" = "junk"
---
so no, I don't get too peeved off losing a load of scrap.
---
Yeah my bad I just remember that‚Äôs how I claimed the other rewards
---
This is the worst post i've seen today. Congratulations.
---
Yeah sometimes just a fleshy bit might be accessible through the ground and you still can loot it if lucky.
---
The SBQ is specifically immune to cripples. You're talking about staggering her. And yeah, you shouldn't do that, the same way as you shouldn't sit on a fence or anywhere else she can't land and melee you.
---
Had a buddy who got rad-bombed by a guy after the SBQ event. Used a trick of mine to do the Lotus pose in photomode to protect his junk. When in a pose, you can't be moved and people can't reach through you. So this walking tin-can and his buddies tried getting his stuff for about 5 minutes before becoming distracted by a scorchbeast. When they weren't looking, I moved and my buddy grabbed his stuff back.
---
Shoot the wendigo spawns at ACP and you will get plenty of 2m. Only thing is that you need to stay in the mine after Earl is dead and collect from the piles.
---
If you have some extra money that you don't need for something more important then I'd say why not. It makes the game (especially stash space management) a lot easier. I keep it for a few months now and I'd continue keeping it but I don't play that much anymore and don't feel like wasting those money playing a couple of hours a week. If you play daily or almost daily for a couple of hours then it's totally worth it in my opinion. If you can't play regularly then you might think like you're wasting your money while not playing and be sorta forced to log in to make your money worth.. Just always remember to cancel it once you're done with it!
---
Yes. The community manager said it was coming.
---
I also learned a new word today, although I don't think you need to be a woman/unmannly(according to the definition) to create a nice interior/exterior space
---
Do you have triple barrels? Also what makes it magical?
---
Idiotic
---
I said effective. There's a reason for that. You allude to it in the last line. That's all that matters in the context of the conversation.
---
So there's absolutely no fix? Or work around? Like anyway to somehow get around the budget system or anything?
---
500 screws and acid after the ACP event is enough to worry about in a short time. (Damn i remember the joy of finding desk fans for screws and now i have 6k screws)
---
When did they scrap it? I haven't really done SBQ for at least 5 months.
---
Some times the dull ones have to learn the hard way
---
Got it next to Ohio River Adventures, while hunting for some meat.. I had to let that damn thing bite me like 20 times before it gave me Woopsies.
---
Really? I thought Maxon was a pretty good leader for The Brotherhood
---
Like he's the first that actively tries to gain positive relations with friendly Ghoul communities instead of blasting at them when they get too close like Lyons' do :/
---
Stop dying then. Get better at the game.
---
Yeah I usually stack them on top of each other, would be great to have matching skins for both.
---
ha wat
---
try like. 100 caps or something. i see dozens in vendors all the time. because of the dooping
---
Did they say near unlimited? All I've heard is that there are fewer build restrictions. That's it.
---
I just can‚Äôt shake these nightmares, floating in space forever, just why?
---
But she makes up for it in her lines that cheer you up
---
Try to understand that *you* were the asshole in this situation. 
---
Tell me what that group of players you threw a grenade at while out of passive mode should have done? You attacked them. They can‚Äôt mid read that it was an accident.
---
&gt;Allies can be pretty annoying too.
---
I just can't shake this nightmares. Repeating the same lines forever. Just... *why?*
---
Not to my knowledge, I haven't looked properly because I didn't bother with the glitch but I do tend to read random posts and never seen anything put about a fix.
---
It does? I can just think of the bit of them murdering all the FEV scientists, what else paints them in a darker light?
---
*acp meat pile looks back and forth nervously*
---
Strange, wonder why that deathclaw is different.  I killed it a few times so it is definitely not a friendly creature. There is power station near Watoga that has an angrier deatclaw, perhaps better luck with that one??
---
Not to sure to be honest but its been ages now, I would imagine over a year.
---
It wasn‚Äôt just a bat, it was a mutated bat three times the size of a Corgeva, and the Queen was almost as big as the Brotherhood‚Äôs dick. And where were you when the Scorched Plague escaped from your laboratories? Oh yeah, fucking yourselves up the ass and tearing yourselves into shreds.
---
I think I ran into the same guy yesterday. There were 2 Mr. Fuzzies with trap camps really close to each other. I tried to go in their camp many times thinking I could jump over the punji boards but they are insta kill. Bethesda should fix that.
---
Just for reference, the poster said that " not everyone is effeminate"
---
The 76 community is fucking tremendous. 
---
I was met just past the vault and handed some supplies too and some poor soul practically held my hand as I figured out how to do the first mission.   They were beyond patient. 
---
I found myself on the golf course at white springs, maybe in my teens, and after collecting what felt like every ghoul that‚Äôs there, I ran in to some high levels who helped me out.
---
I‚Äôve just hit level 50 and was at a camp buying some plans and someone gave me The Fixer and a dump of ammo for it. 
---
I came from GTA and was expecting so much griefing but I‚Äôve honestly seen none. 
---
Thanks everyone for being awesome.
---
One violent night give out possum badges? I don't think so.
---
You only get a big boost if you do a nice thing at the end. If you do the rational thing (IMHO), then you get a little dip. Something to also consider.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/
---
nar repair yard inside the shed on table. And then run down the train tracks towards watoga and theres a train car with a skeleton in it. look on the box.
---
The shelter acts as a separate instance, so it's very reasonable that the budget would greatly increase.
---
The "Reduce ranged damage while wearing a full set of \[weight class\] armor" legendary perks got removed from the PTS sometime ago. Very doubtful they'll suddenly reintroduce them with the update.
---
Guessing Bethesda heard the complaints about them making PA even more unfavorable compared to decently rolled normal armor.
---
No its part of a possum badge challenge. The musician challenge
---
Crater. You'll miss out on a unique weapon during the Vault run if you go with Foundation like I did.
---
They're difficult.  I found mine at a player's vending.   When I was doing that challenge, I hit everyone who had any plans listed anywhere.
---
Train yard vendors, player camps!
---
That‚Äôs currently what Inam doing. Making rounds, hitting all vendors player and npc as well as searching the world
---
Camp on water, use chemist perk, dilute all your chems, use hard bargain perk, sell majority of chems, profit :)
---
The weirdest thing to me about posts like this on this sub is the sense of entitlement. Good points, valid reasoning, but then says something like "And don't forget to..." as if the game devs are a waiter taking your order at a restaurant.
---
Like the next patch? I always forget if we‚Äôre getting 21 or 22 next tbh üòÖ
---
Oh and hop on a public team with someone camped close to the one you want to go to
---
Solid advice
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, this community is a blessing, it‚Äôs by far the best thing about 76!!
---
That's an awesome idea. I like it!
---
You have my sword (size doesn't matter)
---
Agreed. This is what I was told to do and you get a lot more story out of the game too. Also, wink wink... keep it all when your done with the entire quest. üòéüëç
---
Not a fan of the vault door bunker idea though. My builds are always built to work with the landscape or surrounding buildings. A big ugly yellow gear in some concrete doesn‚Äôt work for me.
---
I just bit the bullet and bought a month. My plan is to horde as much junk as possible this month then slowly bleed it away in the coming months until I run out. It will also help me understand what I use most often and what I tend to never use. I also need the atoms to finish the SCORE board since I missed a few weeks of play time. All the other stuff is incidental to me.
---
That's my thought process.
---
I would say no but depends on how much that money means to you &amp; whether the value for what you pay is worth it.
---
Omg I‚Äôm going to start doing that now too! I was selling all my plans for 1 cap but this is a much better idea.
---
Can you craft from your limitless junk box or do you need to move it back to your stash for the work benches to have access to it?
---
Yes I meant stagger.  Both of those are bad stagger and fence sitting.
---
I‚Äôd take both changes, honestly.
---
Though they probably didn‚Äôt do minus accuracy since there‚Äôs one that makes you cost more ap... which of course also has a melee version.
---
That fixed it, Thank you.
---
They did say the budget would be larger but they didn‚Äôt say unlimited. We also have no idea how big the space will be to build in.
---
I also have no clue lol and things keep getting pushed back. In the words of south park, "the pizzas are on their way"
---
A deathclaw is a fine option, maybe even a yao guai or, if you're lucky, a mirelurk king (took me 3 days to find one...).
---
Avoid taming scorched and glowing pets as they will constantly attack your camp. üòí
---
just recently pulled a bloodied crossbow off the Purveyor just to get rid of some excess script before being maxed out on it and did the same things in doing it rapidly but didn't care what i got üòÇ
---
Because history repeats itself. I guess I could reword less snarky
---
lmao the virus escaping was the whole point! its a juicy meme.
---
yall still got fucked by a bat,  and some stiff dudes with green pricks. lame.
---
Agree. Was thinking the other they trying to identify the reasons why this is such a different community is many positive ways... Still thinking.
---
Do both sets of side quests first
---
I do get some folks would be turned off by having the giant gear for a door, but ultimately it makes sense for the game. If we as players can greatly diminish server lag, thats a plus for us and a big minus for people who use the lag for exploits.
---
They said you could "go nuts" in them. And it makes sense they can do that, instanced rooms don't load once you log into the server unlike everyone's CAMPS
---
Fuck that we need community village wars
---
when you craft it just comes out of your scrapbox.
---
Even greatly isn't guaranteed. Having limitless storage for ammo &amp; non-food aid is feasible but will happen...?
---
What's possible &amp; what we get are two very different things.
---
1. They were not really helping anyone
---
2. They would send anyone willing to join them to freaking [Glow](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/West_Tek_research_facility), only one person returned from it (the protagonist)
---
3. It is ideologically a religious organisation, i.e.e fanatics, they place technology above others peoples lives if there is a choice
---
Thank you, I will :)
---
It's worth remembering that the typical soldier 'serving their country and putting their life on the line' is shown in the intro to Fallout 1 executing a prisoner of war and then waving cheerily at the camera. Maxson even caring about what the scientists were doing and wanting to help humanity means he was probably a better man than most of the typical soldiers. It's weird that Nate is generally so well adjusted (unless you go raider). And the Thunder in 76. I guess Bethesda are pulling back on just how dystopian it was pre-war a little amongst the common man.
---
They said that the build restrictions would be softer, and that the build limit would be greatly increased (not in these exact words, but it was implied). If u want the exact qoutes, ur gonna have to watch the dev interview.
---
Oh, that challenge. I see.
---
[This lil' fella!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Owlet)
---
Fireball/acid spitting gulpers?ü§ì
---
Yup. This is my point. Someone gets it :)
---
That makes a lot of sense.
---
My two major builds can‚Äôt take advantage of it. One build is inside a preexisting structure and the other is a ship built solely over water.
---
That's only the second longest sentence I've read on here today.
---
Don't mix up two different things and use one of them as example, I call that brain failure.
---
My husband has just started playing and I couldn‚Äôt understand how he was over encumbered already when he‚Äôd been playing maximum 10 minutes. 
---
Turns out he was greeted at the vault and given 100 stimpacks, 50 purified water and 50 radaway lol
---
Love this community.
---
I've often thought a farmer's market type area where everyone can grab a small space to customize near everyone else would be pretty cool in 76.
---
I mean do raider side quests and foundation side quests.  Then raid at lvl 50, then do brotherhood, then enclave
---
Yeah its the last bit I need an I keep server hopping to no avail
---
I'm not even joking, you guys wanna be pandered to, just get better at the game, stop asking bethtards for more stuff to make you feel special, it doesn't need to be this complicated. It was never really an issue that needed to be brought up, it's only when little timmy gets too butthurt to carry on with life that this gets posted to reddit.
---
You shouldnt be carrying any junk around you do mind losing when visiting camps
---
Sounded like a Raider talking about a Blood Eagle :-)
---
Top of the world
---
Try not to let it get to you, just take the hard lesson and drop your junk off before you go exploring/shopping, even if there is a camp in front of you. Someone got me with a trap camp for the first time last week next to the Rusty Pick, but I don't carry my junk around, and from the storm of angry emotes it's clear they were pretty upset. I just laughed, thumbed up, and waved before leaving.
---
Alternatively you can screw with them by taking off anything that can break, and just setting it off again each time they repair/reset it, and maybe if you feel like spending the time running in before other victims to deny them their junk and be the hero.
---
I didn't see the other when I was on.  The one also had a lot of items listed in the vendors making that much more appealing.
---
I went to another guys place with my higher lvl and didn't notice the whole in the floor on a cliff place.  You already port in to a fall so I should have expected it.  Respawned, put on my PA and ported back.  Feel bad because I think someone else died there too and thought I was grabbing my own junk bag drop it wasn't until after grabning it that I noticed my quest icon was still there to collect my junk further down the cliff.  Sorry for that.  I wish it showed the owner name when you hover over (at least I didn't notice a name).  I guess I'm not used to dying in the same place as others.  Falling through the floor was my own stupidity...so was not putting on my PA before going into the place.
---
Combine it with the magazin route at top of the world. Sometimes with certain weapons it may count in 2 categories at once.
---
Bethesda also said we'd get legendary perks last year.
---
I'd rather wait on something more concrete than jumping to conclusions but that's just me.
---
The truth hurts
---
Dank! Imma have to get on that.
---
I don‚Äôt because I learned my lesson after the first time.
---
Unfortunately most players don‚Äôt.
---
Regardless, I would still like to have PvP if they killed me, wether they get any junk or not
---
Thanks, no dice here, but I did encounter a random 3 start assaultron!
---
Don‚Äôt pay that. They are barely worth anything.
---
1) it doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
2) you can max the rep with both and get the rewards of both no matter what side you choose. 
---
3) the only important thing is to get both sides to the decision point before making the choice.
---
4) if you choose crater, ra-ra will get you the slug buster about half way through the break in quest.
---
Ok, I misunderstood. Thank you again
---
You can obviously server hop and just keep checking those 3 spots
---
added a few commas and changed wording
---
I agree with this. Get to level 50 before the vault raid. Make sure you finish both faction quests before hand. If you need XP quick, get Beckett‚Äôs quest done. But don‚Äôt finish that one until Level 50 also.
---
I'm a loot bag theif. But I stick around to give them a chance. I'll even use weapons not in my build to fight them and give them a better chance.
---
The thing you failed to understand is called an analogy. It's helps to illustrate a point I was making ie the gap between what is possible &amp; and what we may get.
---
&gt;I call that brain failure.
---
Your lack of self awareness is astounding.
---
That you're a clown? 
---
Show me on this doll where the player in the insurgent outfit wrecked you.
---
I‚Äôd also like them to make sure it shows up in a display case. Currently it‚Äôs in my display case and is invisible.
---
 I‚Äôm away from my machine until Monday, do you think I will miss the chance?
---
Agreed.  Online games in my experience tend to be pretty toxic and un-fun for newer players.  
---
I've yet to have a negative interaction with FO76 players...definitely a testament to the fan base.
---
I didn't fail to understand anything, you just act like you are clever and pointed sth obvious with some stupid example that doesn't make sense, and I hated it, simple as that.
---
I mean, if you got no brains don't act like you have.
---
Eh, the PvP in this game is too much of a joke. You either get one shot or you one shot them
---
If what you mean by ‚Äúslowly bleed ‚Äúyou only pay for one month, you‚Äôll only be able to access the stash box for that month
---
I'm going to have three slots unlocked for Legendary Perks when the update hits (unless I managed to level up 45 times), I've already planned on What Rads? and Ammo Factory for sure, beyond that I'm uncertain. Maybe Survival Shortcut?
---
Be cautions, last time I checked Charisma from Legendary card did not allow to share more perk cards, don't know if they fixed it yet or not
---
Good luck in Appalachis my friend.  Try to be more leery or others then paranoid.  There really are a bunch of great people out there that really are just trying to help out.  It's just hard sometimes to know who is trust worthy and who isn't.  If I played on Xbox I would love to pop in and say hi but I'm currently only playing on PC atm.
---
Your English teacher would still be disappointed.
---
1. Ya but there's nothing rly "evil" there, for the most part alot of factions tend to be that way 
---
2. That's actually a fair point, I think that started because people kept trying to join for a free meal and board, and they needed to discourage that, and by the time the game takes place the grunts have gotten jaded about it, I'm not sure how the leaders view it or if they even comment on it, but yea this one is iffy for sure, but kinda neutral cuz again they just wanna keep to themselves during this time in the factions lifespan, not unlike in New Vegas. Again this doesn't make them joking about the dead hopefulls in The Glow not awful, but I mean for the most part everyone who goes there kinda knows what they're in for right? Like it's not like the Brotherhood is forcing them at gunpoint to go to The Glow with no info, they can choose to just not join up.
---
3. That's what people say but I mean the whole faction was founded to prevent people from not allowing what lead to the premise of Fallout to happen again. They're in a weird position where their goal is to protect humanity but humanity is also one of their biggest enemies. I also don't think they're ever done anything that led to human suffering while they prioritized capturing technology unless you count the really extreme offshoots like Elijah who eventually left the order anyway
---
You can preview every skin in atomic shop which says in the description what type of armor it applies to. If there's no word "any" or "ultracite" then it obviously doesn't.
---
Nowhere just pvp a guy close to my lv wherein full insurgent and he had no build just trash and on repeat I see people wherein the outfit or ranger outfit if you have no build just a correlation I‚Äôve observed over lockdown ,oh yeah they also where Chinese stealth helmet sometimes just watch out for them in boss fights or low level events they somehow always get downed
---
üëç thank you for not running from him. I can't tell you how many times I've had lowbies run in fear from me when I try to gift them things.
---
Jet exists in Appalachia, just not for players as the drug effect is to slow down time which doesn't work in an online setting too well. Beckett mentions it, and Rose uses a jet inhaler for some of her idles.
---
&gt;I didn't fail to understand anything, you just act like clever and pointed sth obvious with some stupid example that doesn't make sense, and I hated it, simple as that.
---
Don't worry bud. I don't need to "act" like I'm clever.
---
You might want to look up the Dunning-Kruger Effect. You're appear to be a textbook case.
---
400+hrs. Never once had my camp attacked by a player.
---
Earle's Sack Pack
---
‚ÄúSaid he knew about my fast gun knew the price paid by the law, challenged by a bounty hunter, so I turned around to draw‚Äù
---
I mean, yeah. The radiation was what got most of the wastelanders going there, but even the BoS excursion teams got cut to ribbons by the West Tek security there. They never expected anyone to come back, especially since their own members couldn't.
---
Yeah, i agree
---
Oh sorry, I did not mean to say they are evil, but they have enough quirks that placing them in good camp leaves an afterthought.
---
I agree on all the points, but we have to keep in mind the baseline quality of the game, that is exaggeration of various aspects of US culture and generally humanity bad sides, the BoS does follow it as well =)
---
It makes it feel like working on Appalachia actually has an impact, feels good to always return back
---
Yeah, I will. I am checking Player vendors on this server first
---
The community makes this games hands down.  It is the only reason to try to get the 7600 hour achievement.
---
Well given that it's random, it's not like the choice is yours. Since you're only talking about ranged weapons, just see what you get &amp; base your decision off that.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a fun build, have a back up heavy with vampires (minigun or Gatling) and you can heal up while still doing damage
---
As some one who habitually seals junk and bullets I completely disagree. Put locks on your stuff and I wont take it.
---
I'd avoid explosive heavy weapons if that's what your on about and for heavy if you don't fancy bloodied then junkies would be the next best. Most heavy weapons are pretty good, avoid the broadsider and harpoon gun.
---
However if your a commando already I'd advise against going for heavy weapons in that character since you'll likely need to respect your character and pick new perks to make the build work which works against the new legendary perk system.
---
Damn.well a smg really?sounds fun but once you get a nice handmade or combat rifle you wont lola back
---
Bloodied 
---
Junkies
---
Anti armor 
---
2 shot
---
That's how I looks at rifles top to bottom
---
Yup, Ixve realized any inspect mode gives you the same result
---
Meant look back..
---
Maybe. Now this might be a novel concept.. MAYBE.. just maybe they're playing the game for fun and wear whatever they want and do whatever they want. It's not that deep, fam.
---
I like the AP idea.
---
They really should add a few more ways to initiate pvp without having a slap system
---
I usually hop on a open mic and ask people coming in to collect ore while I defend the people. To no one's surprise, it doesn't work
---
Don‚Äôt give two shits, I just collect ore and stay out of the way until a legendary shows up.
---
Line in the sand event.
---
Not just this, but the loot is often awful. Seriously, it needs an overhaul to scale with your level.
---
Maybe after level 50, it has a chance to give a legendary or something?
---
The Slug Buster? üòÉ I have not figured out a good use for it yet. I mean the name suggests killing bugs with it, but what? Radroaches, crickets, scorpions?
---
-cannibal perk card users sweat and drool- mmmm yes....
---
This is the way
---
This logic is just soooooooo flawed but luckily OP gave you the correct responses lmao
---
Tha g plasma is nice though
---
.good luck farming fuel gets heavy and expensive
---
Way more than balances it out lmao, especially if you have high levels popping lunch boxes
---
CAMP!
---
I probably should have clarified what i meant lol. Once the sale happens I'm gonna be spam buying 3* crates so I dont want to sell/exchange anything worth keeping
---
I'm sorry this would suck to do right now...where are those damn mole Miners with the pails
---
Damn, guess I just encountered a high level shitbag preying on low levels üòë
---
Well...
---
For once I can say the Brotherhood agrees with the Enclave. We have a common goal. Should we not unite to destroy Todd Howard and then we can go back to killing each other?
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/Hrq8RHl
---
Damn that‚Äôs crazy.
---
Wait, when exactly is the sale guys?
---
Lol! Slug Buster &amp; no, it's not for killing slugs.
---
It's an AA low weight plasma rifle.
---
This. I had a 10 cap bounty because I picked a player's lock without knowing that would get me wanted. Logged on the next day and tried to just wait out the bounty, and a player blasted me in the back while I shopped at a vendor and took the 40 ballistic fiber I just bought
---
This. 
---
Settlers and Raiders questline till you get the ‚ÄúSide with...‚Äù for both of them. Once you hit lvl 50 raid the vault so you can start your bullion grind.
---
Find a nice camp but the vending machines are glitched underground...there's  a special kind of hell for those guys...
---
Only the same junk as the standard collectron. And much slower/less of it.
---
Would like to hear from official side what it should collect ü§î
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that, what does lovers embrace give you again? Sleep in a bed might be better then
---
Copy pasta of a copy pasta of a copy pasta of the first time I explained how to hang these correctly. 
---
Here is the trick for the hanging cabinet: hang the wall cabinet on the wall at the height you want. It will go in backwards and be on the exterior now. Go outside and place a shelf below the cabinet. Now blueprint the shelf and cabinet together. Now store them away and go back inside. Pull up the blueprint and the cabinet will now snap into place appropriately with the shelf being slightly off of the wall. Now just scrap the shelf.
---
Thanks, so you think I could punch holes in Earl with it?? Shoot it in the vocal sack?
---
Lmao the event ended months ago
---
I‚Äôm very anti pvp personally but I can get down with this idea. I mean revenge should always be an option for theft
---
That doesn't matter, the echo chamber of people who spread misinformation and claim standing on objects is the issue is too strong. Never mind the fact I've seen her land on top of the bunker before. The queen just has bad coding.
---
Hhhm when they try to hit you with a bat on repeat after you revive them in mama dolches after they lose to a liberator twice tell me food builds are beneficial to the game btw the foody was lv 80
---
I've seen someone demonstrating limb damage on a solo run on YouTube- it certainly was effective.
---
you may want to check a video. if i remember correctly there's a small hidden gap in a wall. 
---
Also if it's your first time in there you may want to go all the way to the end =0
---
Top of the world. When you go to the second floor/level has a bunch of them. 
---
Sometimes outside you‚Äôll have them spawn too, although sometimes it varies and you get super mutants or mole miners. 
---
Morgan town airport has a lot of them. Inside the building as well. 
---
Or if you go by watoga, or any fissure site. Whenever a scorchebeast spawns, it usually spawns a bunch of scorched enemies as well.
---
Like anyone actually believes a friend did this and not OP who's now trying to save face.
---
honestly i would like it, and the rest of Fallout's occult lore, be used for Halloween events and the like instead of something big. 
---
I mean i like the crazy stuff in fallout, but i prefer it to be it's own thing off to the side (like a real ghost in an "hunted house") instead of being in focus like Mothership Zeta. 
---
but yeah Alien weaponry could use some work
---
I've been taxed when selling player to player without the use of the vending machine. Clearly we aren't in Appalachia. We're all  trapped inside the simulation pods of Vault 112. And the magic cap tax is just Stanislaus Braun screwing with us.
---
there is two gaps above the waterfall but i cant go through them?
---
Oh. My. Gods. He's fucking adorable! Can he be brought back to C.A.M.P. like some other creatures?
---
SCP-001 flashbacks
---
Yeah that event is like the Wild Wild West
---
Red Dead 2 online was like GTA,with horses. Lol.
---
Haven't played in months, but when I did, it was just races. Fuck freemode, fuck heists, and fuck that community.
---
I have done This event maybe 10-15 times now (not much i know) but i am ALWAYS The only collecting ore.... I seriously haven‚Äôt seen a single player down there yet. 
---
I know that people are doing it for the XP, but why not get a chance to roll the rare hazmat suit on top of that?
---
The only good thing is I have all the legendaries in the caves for myself lol. I‚Äôm usually giving the ‚Äúcome here‚Äù emote when I spot a legendary. But hell no, not in this case.
---
That's what a say, in a game almost full of mk2 griefers fallout 76 really is a breath of fresh air, most of the players are pretty nice.
---
I also try to help low levels offering ammo, or craft weapons or armor. That's the 76 community.
---
Not in a....living form, no. However there is a lovely mounted version out there.
---
I will refer you to comments I have made on this post as my response.
---
It's in a narrow passageway, I think it's hidden by some leaves that you can walk through.
---
My character is lvl 900 and I have about 600 of those points to spend....its gonna take forever
---
it's been several months since i was last in there but i am sure there's a gap behind some plants/roots along a narrow corridor. Hug them walls.
---
I feel you, I play Rust
---
Well there could be a giant traffic in the air. Theres a lot of cargobots and vertibird bots? flying around appalachia
---
i cannot take anything you say seriously because you say 'food builds'.
---
Pvp me on Xbox GT: Xyo201
---
Same man, I was hoping more of a root cellar type of bunker.
---
Yeah you have a point ‚Äòfood builds ‚Äò just a slang word for unspecialised build and food builds actually can add a lot to specialised builds
---
&gt;I like tech, I like power armor, they got it. 
---
Not gonna argue with that logic. lol Hell, that's why folks like the Enclave. That sweet, sweet clandestine tech with some Hugo Boss uniforms and a side dish of genocide. The side for all of those that thought Luke was kinda lame and Darth Vader had a really snappy uniform.
---
There you go again

Very true. I know there's always exceptions, but I found the twat players who shoot at you or hit you again and again or just do dickhole things in general are level 30 or below.
---
You realise I was agreeing with you right?
---
This, please. When I'm doing it alone, yeah I'll just kill ghouls for xp until all the scavengers die, but if a couple people are there I'll go get enough ore to get to level 1 because then at least we won't fail the event.
---
Anyone know the name of that outfit? That‚Äôs super cute I want it
---
This is correct.  There is a passage is hidden by roots/vines.  It's also set up in a way that makes it almost completely hard to find accidentally.  Just keep an eye out for anywhere that is covered like that and try to walk through it.
---
If you're in there anyways, be sure to take along your Excavator Power Armor too.  There's a lot of lead and crystal down there to take advantage of.
---
Also, Rammadeus is right, you won't want to miss what's at the end of that hidden tunnel :)
---
Private server seems to work. I did it with an alt and had no issue after it glitched on public server.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but; magazine route? What sorcery are we speaking of?
---
Maybe you guys should give Fallout 4 a try, nobody will try to contest your workshop or steal your loot bag.
---
I love your user name! Creative! Unlike mine..
---
It's more of a conversation piece than an actual tool for combat. It'll probably do OK against regular enemies.
---
Yes the floor IS made of floor!
---
Why not just wear power armour if damage protection is what u want? And is heavy combat ass better than heavy combat Uny?  I thought they would be the same? Especially in PVE ass gives no additional benefit at all
---
This game community has always reminded me if the Dark souls community. Like you get the assholes who just wanna fuck Every one by destroying a legendary in 2 seconds before everyone gets in a hit but for the most part the community is very helpful and understanding
---
Yeah, that have happened me to during meat week, we failed the last horde due to time and there was a mole rat attacking a level 1100-ish which I shot it with my gatling, and one or two fusion cell must hit the guy, he made me dust in about 2 seconds and stole all my junk (which was a lot of junk, really a lot of junk for a guy without F1st, aluminium, ballistic fiber, more than 10 of each flux, gold, ultracite, screws), one of the few assholes I've met.
---
&gt;I think most people who play this would have rather just had a another full single player fallout experience.  
---
That is exactly how I feel about the game.  I started playing because I loved the single player games. It's also why I stopped playing.    
---
This could have been a great single player game and I honestly think that's what the original intent was.  (Almost 2 years on &amp; *still* no in-game text chat? What MMO doesn't have a chat window?)    
---
I'm just hoping the next Fallout brings back single player.
---
It also kept the negative Nancy's out.
---
When I was newer, I kept everything locked because I needed the resources. Now, I keep everything open an unlocked. All water purifiers, extractors, collectron, ammo maker, chicken coop, you name it. 
---
If you come to my camp, feel free to stock up on all that is available.
---
Like a mutation booster. All mutations are 30, 40 , 50 %  better. Not 5, 10 or 15% effects what I see in PTS  videos, they feel cheap.
---
You need to spend saved perk points. The game sees it as you not leveling up and the level specific cards won‚Äôt show up.
---
You don't automatically get the cards
---
The point isn't durability. It's about attacking first &amp; hard so that your armour (or lack thereof) isn't even a factor.
---
If you're being hit as a bloodied build, you need to do better.
---
you cant bank levels.. you have to spend prior levels
---
I know this might be obvious, but goo and metal piles should also be included.
---
Also - the three different ash pile colors (red from standard laser fire, green from nukes and ultracite weapons and blue from Tesla and alien blasters) are fine only combining with each other and not mixing.
---
Still using food build though.
---
Better term?
---
If you have already put the blood sample in as I suspect run the analysis before putting the fuse in. If you have already put the fuse in server hop and run analysis then put fuse in. You may need to do it a few, or several, times. But it does work.
---
It is of course easier on a private server, but folks without access to that have been gettin it completed with diligence. Irritating I know. T.T
---
There is a permanent, named Cat called Murgle at a place in the Ash Heap. I forget the exact one but if you look up "Murgle Fallout 76" it'll show you. You can build a camp there as well.
---
Can't use a power fist in power armour in their case.
---
Ah ok thanks for the help I thought this might very been the problem thank u for the advice
---
Thanks! thought that was the case
---
You see, that‚Äôs cool and all, and I genuinely understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but at the end of the day I still just want to play with LGBT+ people. It really isn‚Äôt that deep. It boils down to me wanting to connect to people similar to me, and it‚Äôs that easy. No ulterior motive, no cold hatred for people that aren‚Äôt LGBT+. It‚Äôs all because I *personally* want to be in a group that shares that *specific thing* in common, because I don‚Äôt know many people that can relate to me on it. It would *personally* make me happier to have conversations where we relate LGBT relevant topics with eachother, while I happen to also have fun playing Fallout 76. Everyone‚Äôs making this post a whole thing when I‚Äôve made it as transparent as possible. I won‚Äôt even pretend to avoid the argument over exclusion. I‚Äôm excluding people. I completely am, but regardless I can‚Äôt say I remotely feel bad about it. Most people that play this game are probably straight, and it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to say that everyone who‚Äôs argued with me in this comment section could‚Äôve easily found a group that didn‚Äôt care within the time they‚Äôd spent arguing with me. It wouldn‚Äôt take long at all. To me, this is a game. It‚Äôs a vessel for me to enjoy my free-time. It‚Äôs not equivalent to me excluding people out of my life because of their sexual orientation/gender, it‚Äôs me wanting to form my gaming experience with a certain group of people because I‚Äôve decided that would be preferable in my situation. Maybe it‚Äôs more serious to you guys, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just a way for me to stay entertained.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Get?  For you?  Oh dear, I believe you have misunderstood.  The BOS Collectron collects YOUR stuff from YOUR CAMP and gives it to the BOS :)
---
I don't see why you need a term for someone who doesn't follow guides for builds and does what they want tbh
---
Oh for sure, I completely agree 
---
The only thing I get slightly miffed about is when people rly try to paint the BOS  as cartoonishly evil lol
---
They're just flawed, as are most human based societies, and that's more fun to work with imo
---
Good point. Well made lol. But is heavy combat armour not exactly the same base stats regardless of the first prefix?  Assasins certainly  offers zero benefit outside of PVP.
---
The power armour perk is really cool. I am a power armour heavy guns build and being able to be revived sounds amazing
---
I built my camp near the edge of map in the forest in the water a bit and it sure helps, but sometimes I'll fast travel home, pass my CAMP module and notice something is broken. Turns out a mole rat will occasionally spawn upstairs or in the garden foundations and wreck a bunch of shit before my ally kills it. 
---
While not common, it's still annoying to come home and find an overgrown rodent lying dead in the middle of the room while my TV, couch and other random furniture is torn to shreds, all while that damn wanderer sits there humming as if she didn't take her sweet as time killing it like she should be doing.
---
Worse is when they fast travel to another place
---
That would be awesome!
---
I have 3000 plasma cartridges that I am planning to shoot with it. üòÅ I have used it on the SBQ a few times as it has a nice scope/distance. I also like the look of the rifle.
---
Ah yeah, I don't like that either, I am personally a big fan of BoS in general, in later Fallouts there were both good and bad BoS actions, so generally it works out for many people's perception of what they want from it
---
Ive had the opposite experience, players have been terrible to me. But i always help out a new player when i see one. Treat others how you wish to be treated. Im glad your experience has been better than mine. I've yet to see that side of this community, but i hold out hope because i know they are out there.
---
You can still access the stash box when 1st expires but you cannot add junk to it anymore.
---
You can still access the materials left in the scrap box after your subscription runs out, but you won't be able to make use of putting MORE items in there
---
No witch hunting
---
Milelurk king should always be at the Freak Show if I'm not mistaken (very well could be)
---
...he spent 5k caps moving his camp. Lmfao
---
Heavy combat would offer better resistances than both sturdy and normal only downside is it weights a tiny bit more. But yeh assassins is pretty pointless outside of pvp.
---
I know that but op is saying he gets better resistance from assasins over Uny. If the armour type is the same then there‚Äôs no difference. For a bloodied build. Especially melee bloodied giving up the Uny perks is nuts. Nothing else comes close
---
Energy damage is calculated wrong too. The new update is supposed to patch damage and such
---
I wanna scream *get your ass back here, fool!*
---
It's a ton of fun. Another redditor recommended that I couple it with the Marsupial and Bird Bones mutations. It's an amazing combo. I rarely take any fall damage at all, and when I do, it is miniscule.
---
get SS armor if you want the best DR you can get.  There is a bit of diminishing returns with armor.  
---
What's your build?
---
You hit it right on the mark. It‚Äôs literally just that, a game. It doesn‚Äôt fucking matter who I want to play the game with. Hell, it‚Äôs not even remotely your business as to who I want to play the game with. You‚Äôre wasting your time when you should be worrying about yourself and who *you* want to play the game with. My decisions don‚Äôt concern you in the slightest, whether you stumbled upon this post or not.
---
(EDIT: here‚Äôs the cherry on the top https://imgur.com/gallery/Hrq8RHl)
---
I'm only saying that the way you're asking feels wrong. I can guarantee if anyone made a post with this line quoted from your post but the opposite 
---
"If you meet the only requirement Not LGBT+"
---
Ooooh the backlash and hatred... basically all I'm saying is don't get hung up on orientation because we all have the same friend. We all gamers here!
---
I don't know maybe just state that's a high preference not a deciding factor/requirement. It wouldn't come off as so... weird (for lack of a better word).
---
if  Mariposa was as bad as real  world events then the  scientists deserved execution
---
There's some stingwings on the whitespring golf course, in the centre of them all, almost. They hang out on a little maintenance building/cafe building. Can't remember which. 
---
It isn't too far from the mirelurk pool which can also be found on the golf course, if you know where that is
---
To be fair, it is a very, very large pile of cork ;)
---
Riverside Manor is a great place for lots of scorched
---
I think op's on about the sentinel effect on the armour making him more resistant than his unyielding but yeh you'd want to be unyielding 100%.
---
go where super mutants hang out and check the blood bags. Like Huntersville.
---
There aint enough .308 to go around in this town, Mr. Tinker.
---
I‚Äôm also unarmed on the side when I‚Äôm not using shotguns. I love the gauntlet weapon that was added with Wastelanders.
---
Alternatively, there's the raider outdoor cinema-esque thing, where there'll be nests - I can't remember the name, sorry!
---
It actually only takes up what a wire takes up, someone placed 2 at my camp but I told them not to so they fcked me, but the glitch isnt ban worthy since it's such an easy fix. Your basically able to blueprint the wire that attached to the factory and it blueprints all of it
---
Again. As a melee build. How is he standing still not moving for the sent effect to kick in? And just get sent on Uny if that‚Äôs is making a big difference. 100% Uny all the way. As u said.
---
The game is intended for players to help each other.pvp is a choice.if players go around picking fights or griefing others,believe me when i say there are players that hunt them down just like they do wanted players,and they get their asses handed to them on a platter.i have seen it first hand.glorious vengance.lol
---
Thats not a thermal detonator and you just made that clicking sound with your mouth....rofl
---
You'd be probably better off rocking a set of vanguard and being a full health Junkie if you're happy with survivability and not too crazy damage.
---
Unyielding adds up to so many things that comparing it to assassin is a bit blasphemous. üòÇ
---
Would have thought cavalier would have been better for melee
---
I mean comparatively bloodied bows are better than junkies but yeah in general their damage isn‚Äôt the greatest. But then again they are only bows so them being weaker to guns would make sense. And yeah I am slightly dreading that damage rework.
---
Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse
---
Ah, there we go! Thanks :)
---
amazing title, real descriptive
---
I have no idea what that means? Witch hunting was conducted and put thousands of innocent to death and I don't see the relevance regarding witch hunting and a video of a cheater? Or are they considered innocent?
---
Dollars don‚Äôt magically appear either in the real world. When you sell crap to the vendor bots, Bethesda is pulling those caps out of thin air. Too many caps / dollars magically released into an economy cause inflation.
---
No idea, location wasn't on my pattern...took me forever.

Had to pass on taming a cat and a dog in the process and it was sad. üòí
---
If you see a metal board with a keypad for entry you‚Äôre close to the secret entrance
---
Probably succulents.
---
Not glitched in they are items
---
As far as I know there are no enemies in the game that use bows. So you can only find them by learning the plans for them and either crafting them or getting lucky and finding a legendary version from a legendary enemy. The plan for the regular bow you can get for free by questing for Duchess at the Wayward. The plan for the compound bow is a max reputation reward for either the settlers or raiders.
---
Thank you very much kind sir :)
---
Lmao, me saying you are being dumb, doesn't mean I am saying I am smart. Since I am not stating I am better or whatsoever this stupid example of yours fail to apply again.
---
Smarter people can be dumb at times, it's just not that in this case.
---
Yeah I find explosive arrows very satisfying to use.
---
Glad it helped, and thanks for the feedback - it's always good to have that wiki stuff independently confirmed.
---
That‚Äôs definitely not true, you should hear some of their dialogue when traveling with Handcock... Maxon‚Äôs little last battalion is definitely not pro ghoul.
---
They appointed themselves to this role. That is what happens when you secede from any appointing authority and then they destroy themselves, there is kind of a void of appointing authority at that point.   
---
Their "own" self interest is making sure there is a seed of knowledge to ensure humanity can rebuild in the future.
---
Roger Maxson founded the BoS like 2 days before the bombed dropped (he mutinied against the US army but no one cared cus the nukes dropped). Formed the BoS. 200ish years later his descendant Arthur Maxson becomes the leader of the BoS in FO4.
---
They kinda revere the Maxson family sorta like royalty. Well some do at least.
---
Yeah I use raider because he‚Äôs adorable and the commies soup menu so I never have to look for food and get great buffs
---
Cant display. Just like Jangles
---
All Junk items should be placeable
---
I understand that. There were houseplants available in the Atomic Shop. 
---
Did they look like [this](https://amp.reddit.com/r/succulents/comments/9u9ywc/succulents_on_fallout_76/)?
---
It would be nice if Line in the Sand didn't take 20 minutes after you finish it to pick everything up while the game runs at a snails pace from all the piles.
---
I swear cleaning up after Line in the Sand is the real event.
---
Keep the Nukes and Dragons site bookmarked to save time.    
---
As someone posted, you can't save perk points. When you make a build on that site, near the bottom there is a Level-by-level Perk suggestion list. Use it.
---
When people do this, me and my buddy will launch multiple nukes right on top of them, sure it doesnt hit, its about sending a message.
---
This 
---
Had to server hop twice, but then it worked.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not a multiplayer fan much these days, but I really like 76. I‚Äôm starting to run out of content though, aside from daily repeats and event repeats. It‚Äôs caused me to focus more on the challenges, but I can see that getting old after a while.
---
I have an Executioners +limb damage LMG...it‚Äôs awesome.
---
Yeah they are very rare, probably because they are a max reputation reward and as of writing this now only a small number of the player base have reached that goal. This is why there are few in circulation on the market.
---
Shoot their legs! Most robots have that as their weak spot.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
No they are items like cranberry‚Äôs you can but in the display case
---
Stand at the alter and look towards the pews.  On the right side of the room there is a tunnel.  Follow the tunnel hugging the right wall and look for a sneaky spot with plants.
---
Further down that tunnel there is another sneaky spot with another hidden passage full of wasted potential.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Or if not Atoms, XP. Anything.
---
I don't see why it would be necessary.  If your receiver is chambered for, for instance, .556 ammo it could use .556 AP ammo, .556 hollow point ammo, etc. without any need for changes.  That's how it works in the real world and how it worked in New Vegas.
---
I‚Äôd probably have to see a picture to get a better understanding. Are they in pots or just sitting there loosely?  Are they in the glass or Thanksgiving display cases or on normal shelves?
---
It's a bug in Bethesda's code, not a game feature.  The Ammo Factory was never meant to be put in camps.  Perhaps some day Bethesda will fix the issue but weather or not it restores lost budget when they do, who knows?  For now, I'd have to agree with others, I've not seen any fixes for it.
---
Lol yeah man I‚Äôm still like that too despite being fully speced for my junkies bow. Sheepsquatch‚Äôs, gulpers and mirelurk queens will still mow me down. But I still respawn for another round!
---
Glass case orange plant sticks through emits orange gas
---
Understandable. The Brotherhood is far better off with the technology and equipment that people just have laying around.
---
sigh, here we go again. 
---
the limits exist because this is essentially the end game gear you're working towards. They don't want you to get it all in a week or two weeks. You got to work for it. Most games require grinding end game dungeons/raids and RNG. This game requires you to literally just play the game as it is and cash in notes and buy the gold from smiley (and the RNG when crafting of course)  There should be no grind. You do events like normal. you buy and sell and make caps to buy from smiley. It doesn't take THAT long to get what you want.
---
Actually that would be a great idea for a mod for bows, along with one that would allow you to nock the bow multiple times to fire multiple arrows.
---
Sep 10-14
---
And let's be honest...with the pitiful storage limits we have, WE would probably be better off if the thing hauled some of our junk away too :)
---
No. New score system. New points. 
---
If you‚Äôre done with the legendary run. That‚Äôs it. You won. Completing challenges won‚Äôt reward you anything, you won‚Äôt be getting a head start for the next legendary run.  
---
Just play the game stress free.  Knowing you don‚Äôt have to complete any of those challenges
---
Let me offer a small contrarian view. I did not collect ore at all until I hit level 100 on the game board. That even is an xp farm if I ever seen one. I've gone up multiple levels just from that event.
---
Yes it is selfish. Yes the event fails. But if I collect ore I'm taking myself away from the xp gold that's bring offered to me. These posts are as often as the dear Bethesda posts and I get the frustration. But those who are playing for xp and have all the loot won't care about the event after the board games are over. I've seen events rise and fall because of boredom.
---
This event is one of those that allow you to play for your goals. If your goal is to succeed at the event run ore. Datamined info says you just need one person to live and 75 ore to get the best drops you can do that with maybe two but definitely three players. Sometimes you won't hit that 75 but that's the way it's going to be. Everyone knows exactly what to do there but they are replaying for themselves. 
---
I often remind people that the reason why 76 feels like a good community is because Bethesda patched out as much of the bad stuff that they could. Most of the bad is on NW now. If the game was as it was intended in the beginning there'd be no hugs and kisses. It would be hell. So what you're seeing in radiation rumble is players being real. You or anyone else may not like it. But welcome to the wasteland. 
---
I know this will be downvoted into Colossus mine but I'm just trying to enlighten to the reality. I get this is a vent post but try to play the game as it is and enjoy it. You're not changing people.
---
If you don't find it, server hop.
---
The quest will still be the same, yet you'll get a different location.
---
You can only use the [Legendary Modules](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_module) to craft the Secret Service Armor, Solar armor, Strangler heart power armor, Thorn armor, Cattle prod, Gauntlet, Gauss minigun, Gauss pistol, Gauss shotgun &amp; Plasma caster
---
I‚Äôm here from the future, you‚Äôre all wrong.
---
Bethesda has been bad with their distribution of stuff like this and it amazes me that more people aren't annoyed with it.
---
They could very much just give people the content automatically, but they make everything go through the Atomic Shop in a brief window.  It's like the idea of even adding small bits of free new content to the game to improve the experience escapes them.  And they don't even think about the possibility of just integrating new additions/freebies to the game outside of their shop.  They could alternatively just add new blueprints to the game for players to buy and find in-game, but they never do that either, and instead, we're forced to always claim in their arbitrary limited window on the Atomic Shop, nevermind that it's a digital item and there's no reason there should be a shortage like that.
---
It was the same as the Purveyor's Mystery Pick. The thing about Bethesda's lottery system is there's a lot of chances to roll trash, and vanishingly few chances to roll anything of any value.
---
It feels like the rolls I get from Earle have better rewards, but I know it's just plain luck. Sometimes I get something vaguely good and sometimes it's straight trash.
---
My husband said the same thing.  But his place this time was in a non nukeable area unfortunately.  But if I notice him on again and he is in a location that is...damn right I will.  We like to nuke!
---
They aren't, but Maxon is trying to get them to be
---
Glassed cavern as well
---
I ran into this same guy last night. When his punji board trap didn't kill me as I walked in his door, he followed me around and dropped more under me until it did. He commenced with the mocking laughter, only it subsided pretty fast when he realized I didn't have any junk to drop
---
Mirror Ball and Rad Emitter
---
And if Fo76 it is already implemented with the receivers and the magazines. Not the ammo.
---
I love going to a trap camp with only spoiled meat and cloth in my pockets
---
And listening to the kiddies swear when I leave nothing they want
---
And then I nuke their camp
---
No clue. Sorry.
---
You have a small window before her door opens so run to the left up the stairs and wait for her in the corner
---
This.  Collision corse at airport will give you at least 25, Line in tbe sand probably 4x that
---
With fo1st you will still run out of stash space. It will just be full of items and stims. Having the atoms is nice because I can better decorate my camp, which is my preferred end game content.
---
It all depends on RNG.Look first i need to get the gear for example if i wanted to get the full set of secret service armor it would take a entire month.Then i need to craft the perfect peices that suit me that would at least take me two or three weeks if i have luck in RNG.To me thats just too long and to most other players too.So yes it does take THAT long to get what you want. They should atleast increase it to 300 hundred or make a daily that gives you a 100.
---
Are those the only two
---
If i ever pass your way, you will always get a helping hand
---
Well just let me enlighten you on why you were being dumb the first place.
---
The camp budget thingy exist because of performance issue, but storage for aid and ammo could affect more things than just performance, you cannot compare that with camp budget directly.
---
I don't need some dude thinking they are so smart and go using some crap example to lecture me on the difference in "what could be", "what should be" and "what would be", which is fucking common sense.
---
Wow...not sure what else to say to that kind of childish behavior.  He could probably find more scrap more quickly if he just looked...or set up a camp in a location with junk with a junk collectron.  But I doubt it's really the scrap he is after.  He just seems to have a sick fascination with killing people when they can't fight back.  I'm so glad that he got nothing from you.
---
It's on the last tab on the right in the Atomic Shop where all the features stuff is. It's next to the BoS Fatigues.

Please, for the love of the Gods, read before you post!

These plans can only be obtained from Grahm, or from players selling them.

Great Scott, thats a great idea!

Floor pieces require stairs connected to them. Roofs don‚Äôt.

after playing fallout 4 I redownloaded fallout 3, booted it up, hoarded a shitload ton of explosives. dragged my overemcumbered ass to the citadel, went straight to young hitlers bedroom and blew it all up to hell.
---
sure, I died, he didnt, I killed a lot of nice characteres in the process, made the Washington BOS chapter hostile towards me but IT WAS TOTTALY FUCKING WORTH IT. 
---
DIE MAXSON SCUM.
---
I tried in what I had at the time (excavator), but I soaked up rads so fast I almost died just grabbing a few ore. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?
---
No, a food build is a PvE build, totally useless in PvP.
---
Hmmmm davenport is always at the house so she must have some other minion out collecting from the machines.
---
A hazmat suit and radx also works
---
If you have any more questions shoot them my way.
---
Where can he usually be found?  I‚Äôve only found him randomly once near charleston station..
---
Seek revenge
---
This would be viable in Private Worlds. Not sure how it would be managed in Public Worlds.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs in the description of the vending machines when you place them, that it takes a 10% tax.
---
From what I understand, you get the lootbox as long as there is stuff in it. So I can continue to take stuff out, just not put stuff in. So I'm going to fill that mother up as much as possible then slowly empty it over time.
---
Rad kelp
---
The thing is, you can add or subtract Legendary modifiers to a weapon via script and you can attach the scripts to weapon mods...that's how the anti armor magazines work.  Just add more options for type of modifier.
---
Some FO4 weapon mods even attach the script to the weapon's "bash" attack allowing you to swap ammo types on the fly.
---
Rly ? How does one obtain?
---
Bethesda doesn't really know how to write the BoS, which is weird because they're so fixated on them.
---
Glitch in arkos event

there's another meat week coming up and he'll be at his cook out place for 6 days. If h doesn't have what you need simply log off and back in.

Is it still possible to do?

its been nice not having to worry about SCORE for a couple weeks tbh.

Sorry.  Just the 2 I could think of off the top of my head
---
Didn't really get alot of press so prolly.   Think it just got left in your inventory.
---
Yeah I died with 115 ultracite and they threw down a survival tent and stored it all

Gotcha, I was hoping the points would keep flowing to the next board. But I understand. thanks.

Yah I got a lot of plans from him then üòÄ

I get what you are saying, but be real. Do you believe Beth would really waste any time on even thinking about this? Not to mention they would have to pay for coding time.
---
Then there is the player base that will certainly create a shitstorm just because they spent hours to hunt down the plans that would then be effectively use- and worthless.
---
Or at least give them a bounty for taking it if you aren't or haven't initiated PvP with the player who dropped a death bag in the past 5 minutes or the player hasn't left the game. That would almost make it into a minigame of catch the thief or cops and robbers.
---
I agree with the pvp warning message as well.
---
Do better how when I have 4-10 things attacking me and while I‚Äôm one tapping them I‚Äôm still getting hit. I‚Äôm still working on my perks so this is probably why. I need to get blocking at 3, Iron clad is only 2 and I need to get dodgy at 3 and  lone survivor at 4.  Lol.
---
I mean you're totally wrong here. They are not even a governmental power, they are tech-monks, chilling in their tech-monk monastery for the most part. You should really take your ideas about facism over to the enclave folks and have a little chat about ideology.
---
I picked up a copy of Chally‚Äôs Feed every time I visited him, to have available for sale cheap to other players afterward.
---
I just wanted a chance to win my stuff back...and have fun doing it
---
&gt;No due process, no asking questions, they were guilty by association and therefore executed.
---
There were questions asked. And they were guilty by association.
---
Non power armor I use bloodied power fist. If I use power armor it‚Äôs T-51B and I use a bloodied war drum.
---
If you go to Ohio River Adventures, theres mirelurk eggs that can spawn hatchlings. Some are diseased. When you get a diseased let it attack you till you get woopsie. 
---
That‚Äôs what I did. Worked fast for me. Some have also find this and it took longer.
---
i honestly agree, and it was a bit tedious for me to finally get my entire strangler heart armor, gauss miniguns, and the armco ammo maker all in 2 months time and grinding of course and making me play the game everyday lol
---
What is the vocal sac used for?  I made the rug, plushie and mounted heads and I don‚Äôt think any of them required the sac to craft.
---
Yup totally great source
---
Worth it is subjective, but if you can part with the 13 dollars a month or whatever it is, then id say yes. Many benefits. I play many hours a day though. Here is my list as to why(in order of worthiness).
---
1.Scrap box - never have too much junk available. 
---
2. Atoms - 1600 a month, especially with seasons this is 10 levels that i dont have to worry about, you know, unless i see something i want in atom shop, which isnt often.
---
3. Private server - Two big things with this. New characters i played private server only until lvl 50, unless needed other people for a challenge or something. Never have to worry about running into the lvl 62 enemies when level 15. Next, flux materials. Primed weapons are sort of a must, and stable flux is required. I can nuke WS on a private server, run through and get flux ingredients and xp, change chracters, do it all again, repeat for a long while. One nuke and i can get all the stuff i need to arm myself for a week. Not to mention the easy ability to have mules.
---
Gotcha sorry about that then my bad
---
No, you just wanted another reason to bitch, and another crutch to lean on when you can't play the game.
---
Awesome. After like 50 tries I got a J/50 limb Gauss Minigun (I‚Äôm a Junkies build and that was my first one).
---
id say yes.  you prob spend 14 bucks on dumber stuff in one month.  The tent is handy and the unlimited scap box is great, especially for stable flux.  Alsonorivate server is awesome for SCORE challenges like taking over a workshop or killing a certain creature.
---
private server*
---
Awesome thanks for the input. I usually don‚Äôt use Limb damage and was slightly disappointed in my Gauss Minigun.
---
Its a request to bethesda to allow us to use it for more.
---
I collect the rewards even though I've never once popped into ATLAS
---
This isn‚Äôt something I thought of but you make a good point
---
Actually, the tax came when I tried to give caps to a teammate to give to a mule. No sale even. Ten thousand simply became 9,000. But I was mainly just making a Fallout 3 joke.
---
It only took me like a minute and I found out the challenge is bugged so I can‚Äôt even complete it
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest I‚Äôd just drop someone take there stuff and find a new server
---
If they ever implement using combat rifle skins for the fixer, I'm gonna hold off in case one of Bethesda's wonderful bugs pops up and causes to weapon to disappear.
---
gonna grab more when he comes back. it was like the last day and i was all 'maybe i should buy radiation emitters and mirror balls to sell on'
---
Rule 9 of the subreddit, my dude.
---
Notes from the wayward questline I think
---
Well, playing an asshole post apocalyptic maniac is an option in this game and only very few love and play it. Nontheless they did their part quite good and you gave many others a reason to play this game. I for one like their creativity
---
Honestly I'm grinding out new characters myself. I have a bloodied melee and a junkie's commando. About to do bloodied heavy gunner with chameleon mutation and solely weightless armor. Fun times lol.
---
Yea, luckily for gf and I the challenge was working fine for us and we got this done. 
---
She got lucky and it only took about 2 minutes for her, took me a lot longer.
---
new characters are fun as you know what to do and what not to do. 
---
BUT with the new perk loadouts coming it might be worth just getting as many perk points as possible. assuming you can change special points at whim.
---
New char, respecing will eat your perkpoint and those you will need for the legendary perks coming on the 15th.
---

---
BOOWM!
---
My camp is outside of Watoga and turrets are really just a waste of time. Weirdly I rarely get attacked but when I do they destroy my mutfruit plants. Only these plants and literally nothing else. Pricks.
---
You are incredible!!! Thank you so much!!
---
Yes...the community is amazing in this game...feels like family at times..
---
Ahh, thank you. Probably not worth the list price then.
---
start ranking them up as much as you can now. thats what i did.  Dropped my total number ill be scrapping dramatically. I had level one set of each level just in case, but now i know i wont need them just ranked them up to max. ranked up 30 action boy or girl from 1 to 3, now only 9 cards to scrap.
---
First time I ever tried my health bar was half rads in like 2 seconds, idk how people run around down there I thought all my secret service armor and a radx would cover it
---
What I was told having a fire rate over 200 is one of the factors that goes into it. I managed to roll a Junkie's FFR with a 3rd star I don't know off the top of my head. Having FFR though brings it's fire rate above 200 without the need of tri barrel, even though I still use it. This often leads to bosses taking substantially more damage than they should especially when I only aim for one part of the body, such as the head.
---
FYI there is a bug where when you contract the last disease you need for the challenge, it may not award the atoms.  If this happens you need to contract another disease afterwards.
---
This confused the hell out of me when I finally got The Whoopsies, which was the last one I needed but didn‚Äôt get the reward.
---
Same thing just a little southwest of foundation.  There is a little pond with eggs. Check it when doing dailies and eventually you'll find diseased ones.  No queen involved.
---
I try to be both concise, and reasonable. A new skin, as long as it remains a a very distinguishable skin from everything else, could be cool.
---
Don't shoot back then
---
Probably the case. I have greens from meat week and dry kindling from camp fire tail. You can add them to a display case but they don‚Äôt actually display.
---
The enclave are satirizing democracy. A group of elected officials so out of touch with the source of their power (the people) that they either allow them to die or actively cause their deaths (depending on which pieces of in game info you use to determine who launched nukes first). Without an actual nation to govern over they don‚Äôt have any real power but pretend to anyway. 
---
The fact that the enclave and the BoS seem so similar can either be read as a deliberate act by the writers or a consequence of making each faction so exaggerated. It‚Äôs the Horseshoe theory of going far enough to either political left or political right and they start to seem the same.
---
I dunno if its any use yet
---
If you like your current, then create new. I found my build wasnt cutting it at boss fights, so respeced so i didnt have to regrind all that reputation again.
---
I bet Darcy just took an InsultBot and gave him a BOS paintjob...
---
Bear singular.  It gives 6 acid.  I need 1600.
---
That plus a boost to energy weapons in general would be lovely.
---
There is obviously something stupid in how easy is to get notes and how slow and hard is to get gold bullion.
---
It makes no sense, and if you happen to have time to play once a week, you are screwed.
---
If it works the way I think it does, then it'll save me budget from my already placed bobblehead stand and magazine rack (both will be placed inside the instance instead), but that's about all it will save since I like my forever camp the way it is. 
---
Also, depending on how much budget we have for the instance, I will dedicate an entire room to every magazine in the game. Gonna try to finish my collection soon. :)
---
But you can't change special points on a whim.
---
I'm guessing its coz bloodied builds don't want to OD on radsüòÇ but in all seriousness collecting ores is my favourite part of the event. While everyone else gets swarmed by ghouls I get to go on a radioactive walk and pick glowing gemsüòä.
---
Ohhh I hope so!
---
My stealth support is a shotgun build. Why? because:
---
*   some shotguns can be silenced
---
* stealth is a good way of getting in close
---
* enforcer. If I'm on a team, i just cripple everything to help out the team.  If alone, can get you out of being surrounded if discovered. 
---
* I hear that if you build with crits or VATS, shotguns are pretty strong. Additionally, magic shotguns are supposedly OP (I've seen them, but never used them so can't be 100% sure).
---
* Personally, I had too many shotgun shells and a couple explosive shotguns on my other characters and never really used them. So it gave me an excuse to devote one specifically for shotguns. Plus ALL my shotgun ammo from other characters goes to this one so I've never run out.
---
I should note:
---
* Ran it through ACP and it's pretty decent at picking people up, killing and crippling the wendigos (not sure if it entirely cripples Earl, hard to tell), and doing some decent damage to Earl himself.
---
* Also run a silenced lever action for distance (mostly tagging) and a shishkebab for melee and the friendly fire card.  It also has a few mutations including the team oriented ones.
---
So, that's just my support build, I'm sure it could be better damage wise but the character it's on focuses sharing perk cards, Vendor Selling, and assists so it is what it is for the moment.  Only problem i foresee is that it is heavily dependent on legendary shotguns with at least some decent effects (explosive usually).  Not really top tier, but at least viable in my experience.
---
As always from Bethesda
---
I was exactly the same, I kept putting off buying it because it was a multi player game, I‚Äôve never played one before, ever! Then it came on sale for ¬£10 and I had to buy it, still didn‚Äôt install for another 2 months but now I play every day and have been treated really well. I‚Äôve been given legendary gear, all sorts of great stuff and only once have I been killed by a higher level player. I love it and I love the people that play it!
---
I saw on another thread that if you move your camp around quickly it can reset it but that was also in reference to a different but similar issue
---
Can only do that if they killed you
---
Not in PvP or I'd just seek revenge
---
Forget more fireworks. Give us the plans to craft the fireworks. And I'd love a Bloody Mess perk toggle. Allow me to switch the blood and guts to that cool fireworks and confetti animation we get from lunchboxes. Don't limit our fun. Give us more stuff to party with.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I may use that as well and make my instance a museum of stuff I collected rather than a camp.
---
PM sent with info.
---
*Edit: Some of y‚Äôall are hilarious.*
---
Yea can't prevent that, still a thing we'll be stuck with in mmos
---
You can't use stimpacks until the barrel stops spinning which may end up getting you killed more than once, but if you can deal with that then it's a solid choice.
---
I'd say 50 cals are one of the best choices here.
---
Gee i wonder why so many people take issue with it.
---
Maybe because its a lazy excuse for endgame content, and instead of blurting the same condescending apologistic responses the community as a whole should really push for more
---
Oh ok have a nice day
---
I'd like to play Whack-a-Commie with another player.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll try to use it!
---
It wouldn't be.
---
Are you using blocker, serendipity, evasive, dodgy, barbarian, sneaky? With any combination of these bloody builds are pretty tanky.
---
I'm talking about when perk loadouts come out. If you cannot change special points there's not much you can do with a loadout.
---
on Xbox ive seen this happen here and there with bosses and sometimes normal enemies like scorched and ghouls, its just a small bug they havent gotten around to fixing yet :/
---
That's a single player game though. Not really a solution for what I'm looking for
---
Yeah I‚Äôve got them too rly hoped to display them
---
I had all of them except for whoopsies. And the o my reason I knew I got the achievement done, along with the rewards is because I was tracking it. 
---
But I read that apparently a lot of people are having problems with that challenge not working properly.
---
Yes there is.  Ammosmith, super duper, green thumb, weapon artisan, just to name a few.  I don't want them on all the time, but I do when I'm crafting ammo, picking plants, repairing weapons, etc.
---
Been experiencing this on PC as well.
---
Unfortunately not.
---
Definitely what rads. What rads will let me remove sun kissed and gives a better effect, which essentially frees up both 2end from sun kissed and the need to ever have radx/radaway on me in any serious quantity.
---
Far-flung fireworks and follow through just for general damage, not much needed to add to that.
---
Funky duds is a desperately needed addition to the game, and since I use a full set of thorn armor, it will give me an easy boost. 
---
Rest will probably be legendary strength and agility for more perks/stealth
---
Yea honestly it's one of a few places to get heavy guns like ultracite Gatling lasers but the wait makes it awful I'll just craft them then
---
Just had that happen to me :( got in big fight BANG black kicked to dashboard :(
---
Same, but also AG to max out Adrenaline.
---
People in this game cannot handle anything beyond full grug shooty shoot. This playerbase is extremely terrible at any sort of mechanics to events or fights.
---
I can't lock the loot bag though. This is specifically for that which I think would add another dynamic to death in the game
---
Yes this is what you call an object spawn type,  it can have all kinds of things , some of the ones you described are new with wastelanders but that spot has always had random encounters
---
Edit: it can also spawn the civil war body with costume plans
---
More than I can say for this guy haha. How's that work though you just find one take it and try pvp? I'd wouldn't have it a go but  pve build so if I can't get it back o well I got a chance. Respect.
---
Tell me you bought that gorilla for 250c
---
for me that's not a loadout. a loadout would be switching between my junkies shotgun and then a junkies rifleman build and then a high charisma healing build and maybe a punching things build. which would involve moving points around. Right now i can put on utility cards whenever i want.
---
Props to givers but don't worry about the fusion cores I'm always buried in them!
---
yeah they are i have thos plus the food one and the treasury one. as well lol there not worth any thing honestly üòÇ
---
Do you know if perk loadouts are supposed to be on pts?
---
Mind = blown
---
updoot to cancel the downdoot
---
Thank you for this I formation
---
the answer is simple, people who play long enough accumulated a lot of stuff they dont really need, but no one wants to buy it either, plus they bored coz they like the game but there's not much of activities. so here you got what you got. you'll understand them later, on 160ish lvl i'd say
---
You know you can keep collecting kindling and add it yourself, right? It keeps spawning throughout the event.
---
i dont think they are. loadouts are a month or two away i think.
---
It's horrendously bugged. Even the devs don't know what they want it to do because they use the words reach/range in the descriptions of mods yet the changes are not consistent with it.
---
Essentially, the vaporization nozzle is supposed to lower reach drastically. But changing the barrel will replace that with the standard reach. Then it gets reset back to vaporization reach every time you find a new server. It doesn't matter what barrel you put on, you can change from long barrel to sort barrel and it will increase the reach of your flames
---
Doing what you want to do is entitled?  Grinding xp instead of for stuff I already have is entitled?
---
I'd rather just forget it and move on. I don't need to know who the desperate weasel who scooped up my fistful of crap was. When it comes to "honor" , they already lost.
---
Re-spec'ing will become progressively more time-consuming, but at around 100 it's not a mind-numbingly difficult process, yet. If you're happy with your character as-is, though, stick with it and roll an alt.
---
I kinda feel like your idea of loadouts would be a big middle finger to everyone whose changed their special points around before because of the legendary perks.  It's going to be a lot harder to get them as someone who radically altered their special stats compared to someone who didn't.
---
This event requires some competency. The very few people who actually know what to do would rather farm ghouls. This event is the new One Violent Night. Get used to it.
---
Presently I have 6 Cha so it's not for sharing extra perks as much as being able to drop that to 1 base and move the points into setting 15 base Agi.
---
Yay.  It's a good gun.
---
Old bug from launch, used to be swept under the rug but due to how it changed legendary mutation, wastelanders brought it back.
---
Those are legendary enemies. But they spawn with 0 stars. So the game brute forces the "legendary" out of their name, and removes their legendary drop
---
I've heard the sound from normies, but haven't paid enough attention to determine whether they're healing.
---
It‚Äôs what losers call people who are purely built for pve, examples being people who run quality of life perks like good with salt and the perk for reducing food weight.
---
You're all good
---
Yeah that's why I have 40 of them. I just cant be fucked to use them.
---
It's a Preston Garvey style fetch quest she gives wandering settlers.  "Go fleece five of my dear vault dwellers and you get 50 caps!"
---
Always called it the human deathclaw myself.
---
Hit 50 then do both sides till you get the stealth suit from settlers that will save you 4k of gold bullion grinding after that dealers choice
---
Ah, that would explain why I have not seen it.
---
Thanks for the update :)
---
Do both questlines until you are forced to choose one faction. I would side with Foundation and give them the gold. There is a reputation bug with the retirement plan daily you can literally repeat until you reach max reputation in a single day lol. As for the gold is not that much that you will loose and I am sure the community will unlock the extra meat week event you can get tons of treasury notes that week and getting reputation with Foundation is painful AF.
---
Wait till you find the bomb and if you cut wrong cord it blows up. Lol I‚Äôve played since beta and just started finding these things which is a reason I‚Äôve always loved fallout games. No matter how long you‚Äôve played you can still find new stuff
---
Same. I've heard people say it's a waist because you already have it, but I always avoid hacking and picklocking because I have to swap cards. I also forget to switch them back
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs appreciated. It‚Äôs bizarre that people decide to downvote a valid recommendation that follows the rules and helps the OP.
---
That's what you get for cheating. Stop trying every exploit you find on YouTube and just play the game.
---
could mix in sneak perks to help, I've noticed alot of bloodied builds use sneak over all since your also able to get sneak multipliers ontop of your insane damage to make it more insane and one shotty. plus you wouldnt have to worry with damage unless your dealing with a group of enemies then I advise a melee weapon as an off hand in that situation that is faster like a switchblade or anything faster than the power fist if possible.
---
Me too! I've been thru the area on occasion but never noticed these. The gas pipe drew me in cuz it seemed very out of place
---
Its because everyone is too interested in shooting the lvl 20 legendary and getting scrip than actually passing that event.
---
Yeah the gas pipe was freaking cool when I first saw it. I was like no way this was always here
---
Interesting. I love to solo this event on my private server. I want all of the XP farming for myself. No sharing. At high level at least, I've never not kept enough of those "workers" alive to not let the timer run down to zero. Now as for collecting ore, you guys that like to make these posts should trade in game names and join an ore collective. I'm not joking. But now that you've reminded me that this event exists and I've completed the season, hell, I may just go git me some ore. Don't really need the XP as much now.
---
Is this similar to the naked mob glitch where they are standing there naked and you can shoot them forever but they don't die?
---
Every time I go through West Tek I see at least one naked super mutant and I feel like his buddies must make fun of him.
---
That happens because people will travel to the event, leave the event via pipboy, and then get hit by you to initiate a fight. It makes no sense that you can do that, but it‚Äôs been a thing for a very long time so they‚Äôll probably never change it.
---
Haven't done one since beta, they are useless lol.
---
I normally stay away from people to but this guy kind of found me. They are out there apparently but not common
---
I'm done watching random people somehow mess up Swarm of Suitors.
---
weirdly enough im a high lv. 223 and people below me with gift me with things i don't need, but ill take them anyway out of courtesy to them üòÖ
---
You can't tame a fixed spawn, you can only tame a random spawn. Deathclaw island and the power station are both guaranteed spawns so you can't tame them.
---
Honestly, neither of those is particularly appealing, but if I had to pick one over the other it'd the stash thing. I've got all the legendary crap I want, and I rarely ever get close to that 800 stash limit, though I have had to juggle some stuff from time to time.
---
I'm right outside the abandoned BoS camp where you turn in your tech data and I'm ALWAYS having a single scorched aggro at my base for no reason and just picking it apart with potshots.
---
Buildings need to be given damage thresholds so small arms fire can't kill it so easily and be able to be repaired easily.
---
Oh just like violent night. Ppl will not repair the juke box or keep turning it on and off to the point we aren‚Äôt moving the bar and we fail. I love when I‚Äôm in a public and no one shows up for that event. You literally just hit jukebox and just kill it will get done in like 4 minutes. And if it needs repaired, repair it and then make sure to hit it again to put tape back in. I Rather do these events alone anymore being ppl will fail it either on purpose or just not knowing what to do other then shoot their legacies. ( at least on Xbox)
---
Haha, well said.
---
Youre welcome
---
Chinese Stealth / Hazmat / Power Armor
---
I was distracted by the weird all-caps listings.
---
*Checks if they're still there* 
---
*They are*
---
*Looks again: "Known"*
---
but that's what a loadout is though. from call of duty to wow. switching between different weapons/classes/playstyles. 
---
there'd be more pissed off people if loadouts come out and you can only work with the special points you have.
---
Are there other locations like this?
---
I love how players help players on this game. Hell, even the Workshops which are meant to be PVP you have other players come help you defend it. It‚Äôs an awesome community, the best I‚Äôve ever come across tbh. Keep supporting each other Wanderers!
---
Only scrap. Wood, steel, cloth and so on. It also collected 3 radaways. I had waited for it for so long and it pissed me off that it is so bad that I went and spent the atoms from the season reward on the raider collectron. Now my collectron gathers guns and ammo like it should have from the beginning!
---
About a month or more ago it kept happening to me. 3 or 4 times straight kicked and it wasn‚Äôt server crashing just me. Then it would take forever to get back in that I would never get to do event. Then out of no where it didn‚Äôt happen anymore. I‚Äôm also on Xbox and it‚Äôs a Xbox one x
---
Hey you on ps4?
---
i've failed that a couple of times when a rad scorpion has come out of the ground under the fire and you physically cannot click on the fire to add kindling
---
That‚Äôs going to haunt my dreams lol
---
I never noticed that lol. Make sense.
---
  Kinda like Last night when I did Rad Rumble b/c it popped up as I was walking by. I waited until here was 1 min on the talk to Melody timer... No one else showed.  Knew what I was in for, ate somE canned meat stew and started it.
---
 I just picked a worker and kept the ghouls off of said worker.
---
 About 6 min left on the event timer,  2 other people finally showed up.  Can‚Äôt see the floor from the dead ghouls piled around me; my worker is still 80% life.
---
And noone collected nuclear waste.
---
Failed the event.
---
At least I got XP :)
---
same here, any fix? thank you
---
If you keep the inserted fusion core in your inventory, you don't have to insert it every time you pull out your power armor.
---
Wah wah wah
---
IKR
---
DuchessSonya, with what they used to charge for DLC as opposed to what they charge now for microtransactions and Fallout 1st subsciptions, you should ask  to be beamed up into the sky and wake up inside a spaceship on a metal block surrounded by probes or have an alien invasion across the whole map. You should.
---
Ohhhhhhhh I thought it was the first 8 to join got to play.
---
"The fact that the enclave and the BoS seem so similar"
---
They don't, at all...
---
Agreed. My ideal would be if the abridged "combat" animation was the one that was always used.
---
In Fo4 I installed a mod to do just that. Also it's way cooler looking to watch your character jerk/spin the wheel, recoil back, then leap into it as it opens.
---
wow that sucks man.  I feel yeah.  Its  rite of passage to fail.  My first nuke run I did on a Monday night 2 hours after the codes reset.  Put my only nuke cars in and it was eaten.
---
Holy crap, I was wondering what was happening with this thing today. I was doing the Melt 50 Robots for Metalworker badge and I had to get right on top og every robot.
---
Yeah they removed the slap damage, so if you have pacifist on you won't take any dmg unless you return fire. Be careful tho because I think mutations that proc on melee attacks can trigger aoe dmg that will flag you pvp if the dude is melee griefing you. Pacifist just makes it so your weapon attacks don't do dmg but if you initiate PvP they can still murder you.
---
Already experienced this with 1 molerat on the pts
---
And that was before the next 3 showed up
---
Foodbuild
---
No actually I didn‚Äôt. 
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Today I accidentally punched someone and he murdered me :(
---
Works for me. But then how do you stop players from deleting each others stuff and building different stuff in the same spot etc.? Maybe they are assigned a common goal but can use the build systems creativity to build things?
---
Radiation rumble. You can collect ore and farm xp at the same time. But no one bothers to collect ore. Riding shotgun. You can collect all the crates for max rewards before the timer runs out. You don‚Äôt need to rush to open the gate. Encrypted. If It‚Äôs not your recall card, don‚Äôt start the event when no ones shown up yet. So yeah people could mess up events.
---
TBH that is what I am planning too.
---
The iq of gamers in general has dropped over the past decade. Games or events in games that need some kind brain activity are too much for the new generation of gamers.
---
LOL good plan.  I think with these legendary perks it will be possible.
---
Good to know.
---
Yep, who wouldn't become acquaintance with someone who gives you gold?
---
Well it's a console thing
---
Soon you‚Äôll be dropping fusion cores to save stash space my friend!
---
I for one welcome our new Power Armoured Overlords. Especially so if they arrive in a big shiny Ironclad Zeppelin.
---

Here's some solace for you. If you have Fallout 1st then you've probably collected so much junk that collecting more is just a high score anyway. And if you don't have Fallout 1st, you're probably under the constant pressure to rid yourself of the excess junk because of the stash limit. You died and lost some junk in a world covered in junk and where caps are pretty worthless. Don't dwell on it and just go have fun. And if you want 450 caps and are on PC, send me a friend request. I'll even collect some junk for you and let you rob me. LOL

OMG this. I love my Tesla, but that üí© is glitched and will absolutely wreck the framerate for everyone in the area and it doesn't go away.
---
All a go. I‚Äôm in
---
Thanks queen üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
They do this on purpose I guess. In game text greatly enhances the spread of toxicity. Destiny 2 on PC doens't have text as well.
---
Should be as simple as finding the note in the pip-boy notes tab and reading it.
---
I have a VE Combat Shotgun and paired with the - 15 armour, it absolutely wrecks.
---
Whitesprings Ghouls are down in one shot. Same with most Deathclaws. Super mutants are a bloody mess (even without the perk). Heck I can take down my local Behemoth in about 5 shots. 6 if I get too deep in the water.
---
No, they see it. I can watch my Tesla fuck shit up and learned fast that my gun developed a new glitch and hung it on the wall until it's patched.
---
Airport and train yard right next to it.  Collision course with multiple players.  Shoot the SB when it flies over and you‚Äôll usually get a high level scorched or two. 
---
For higher level thrills, collect ultracite at any fissure.
---
THe one just S of whitespings will do it.  They‚Äôll start at level 1-6, but the second wave (for me) is L68.  And you‚Äôll likely get at least one SB.
---
THe docks on the lakeside cabin workshop side of New Gad lake, and the bridge just past that.
---
High level doesnt mean anything, if you build right from the beginning you can have a meta build at around lvl60-70 that can kill ANY level.
---
and here I was just randomly attacking Mirelurk Queen and got hit once by a spawn and caught the whoopies. I can't count the number of sleeping bags I had to use to finally get Swamp Gas.
---
Agreed.  Also, and I may be wrong, but I think when you get the wanted tag and someone attacks you, you can‚Äôt fight back.  Seems backwards.
---
I keep hoping to find a cool trap CAMP to die in. I want to play puzzle of doom.
---
I think Turtle mentioned that it can only use regular ones
---
It was right at the end, and I was trying to kill a mongrel. I wasn't trying to be an ass or anything. And people shouldn't just loot my stuff
---
Pro tip #2: Even if you don‚Äôt plan on dying, try storing your junk.  (We all have that one friend that is always over encumbered even with a baseline excavator suit and freaks out when they are trying to walk to a train station and runs into a spawned encounter that makes them drop all that shit......you hoarders of wasteland....you know who you are....lol)
---
To be honest, I'd like the treasury note system for scrip. Let us scrip everything we want but have a limit on how much we can spend daily at the purveyor. At least this way, our stashes will be less full of legendaries destined for scrip.
---
I think it's because a lot of us grew up with fallout which means 30+ years old. I've  teamed up with players 60+, 76 has a more mature player base when compared to other online games..imo.
---
What‚Äôs your platform?
---
   I‚Äôm putting all my known plans in my vendor, most are 1/2 lIst or less.  I know I‚Äôve sold off a lot of robot already, but i think I still have some left.
---
Yep for lead hit the gyms at the prison, flatwoods motel and charleston fire station and all 3 silos (1st level no need to do scans and cards etc) I have 30k lead from doing this once a day over a couple of weeks, also if you want lots of lead in a day, server hop and do breach and clear lots of lead ore there too, I dont do LH mine as I dont use excavator PA  but you can do that too if thats your thing. I have an acid farm that nets about 2-300 an hour too.
---
I‚Äôm on PC
---
Oh thanks! I‚Äôll check it out
---
Believe it or not the first time I got a disease was by sleeping in a random mattress on the floor. My second one was radworms when I was bullied and slapped the first time I went to whitespring.
---
The things we collected for their "event"....
---
Upvoted for the BTTF reference
---
I just noticed... but is your name a king of the hill reference?

There you go
---
I added the perk that lets you target limbs and I broke that damn things legs out and then played ring around the rosie and smashed its skull in üëç
---
This is my first MMO-type game that I‚Äôve played and honestly I can‚Äôt see myself playing any other game in the genre, due in no smal part to the very kind fanbase :)
---
Why should I be forced to put several pounds of consumables I don't intend to use anytime soon on one of my characters?
---
Yeah no problem, I was just checking whether that changed since I stopped playing. I knew they had an area of effect (tiny) but didn't know Demolition Expert worked on them. That's extremely handy actually. I'm several weeks away in terms of reputation from the gauss shotgun but that sounds like a fun item! :)
---
Press and hold the back button.
---
The instancing sucks. If the teams that come arent full or ready for it its a bust. SBQ  is much better.
---
Eh, not sure about that. It‚Äôs really only two and a half days of grinding for treasury bills and you lose a big chunk of faction reputation that you will have to grind for
---
I've yet to ever be stuck in a terminal in 76.
---
Hold the backout button.
---
There is a guy with a decently sized following on YouTube, it's their derogatory term for people that play the game for PvE and QoL instead of being completely specced with gear and armour for PvP.
---
His channel is worth a watch if you want to see all the ways you can get fucked over by stupid PvP tricks and the tactics they use, such as workshop PvP, group flagging, as well as highlighting the sheer amount of BM going on in PvP with duped stealth boys/quantums,  8 god roll weapons likely obtained through illicit trade, full sets of god roll armours, and how even with all that shit you can still get 2 tapped. 
---
The PvP in this game is a joke, so his channel is good for a laugh. 
---

---
I‚Äôm pretty sure nothing attacks you if you have no turrets. I haven‚Äôt been attacked since I was very low lvl and had the stupid things. I deleted them because Beckett was being a noob and they were all shooting each other. 
---
Since then I‚Äôve moved twice and haven‚Äôt had an attack like before. I used to get Super mutants / Bears
---
I read somewhere on here that if you don't use one of those US Government Requisition Holotapes the moment you get it, they are useless. (i.e. you can't stockpile them, they have to be used in your current world).
---
This may explain why they never show up for me. I get the miscellaneous quest after inserting said holotape, and the yellow search area circle as shows up on the map, but they never arrive! 
---
What I'd really want to see is a countdown timer appear as soon as you insert the holotape. You then hear the thrum of the cargo bots engines above you and the supply drop's location is revealed by an orange flare, clearly signifing where it fell to the ground. I mean, how hard can this be to achieve?
---
unfortunatelt imthere is no mod to increase the fire rate
---
That animation of quick spin and enter was fun
---
Random encounters have multiple types and are hard coded to certain spots. Some info below.

‚ÄúSecret service‚Äôs sneak is fine‚Äù yea ok your missing my point, I don‚Äôt want secret service to be ‚Äòfine‚Äô I want it to be endgame.
---
I'm level 55 and been playing for like 3-4 months and I have NEVER been killed by another player or been bullied in ANY way, shape or form.
---
It doesn't seem to be correct. It was telling me to get cards that weren't available.
---
Actually I'm level 80 and i have a few in stock
---
Once I got on the scrip grind, as a non 1st player, the cores had to go lol
---
One off sidequests are relatively rare and unrewarding. If you haven't finished the wild appalachia questlines, I don't envy you. They're long and annoying and unrewarding. Outside of those, there really isn't much to do outside of misc grinding, but if you find a group to run with, anything can become fun.
---
Nope, it's all kind of junk. But just to the maximum of 1 pound.
---
And the collectron is talking about ammo and stimpaks - I never got.
---
Yup. Like you, I‚Äôve got all the rewards I want from the event. The 2 flux aren‚Äôt worth it, and I‚Äôll never use any of the Cursed weapons. And that‚Äôs not counting the frustrating times Earle glitches thru the floor or ceiling and can‚Äôt be looted. SBQ is more rewarding to me...
---
Why is this even being discussed if you lose junk your stupid,bad,not paying attention, or why aren't you in passive. Plain and simple its just pretty stupid to lose junk especially with all these stupid free scrap kits that I throw away because who losses junk
---
I've been in arguments about the BoS in Fallout 4, where they seem pretty overtly fascist, or very close. Their glitz and shine hide a genocidal bent, and it seems clear they will exterminate anything that gets in the way of their sense of purity. It's an easy sell when the foes are feral ghouls and super mutants, but the structure of their ideology won't automatically change: they'll find new categories of foes. They need this, like any fascist/paramilitary, to keep their internal hierarchies.
---
I'm playing NV for the first time and finding BoS is really boring and pretty lame. Most of the traditional Fallout stuff in that game, including Super Mutants, are lamely underdeveloped. I get that they are a minor outpost, but they are feeble and uninvolving.
---
Totally agree about FO3. Perplexing display of goodhearted paladins, I suppose to contrast with the black hat Enclave. None of it works well, although Liberty Prime is a fantastic idea.
---
I'm uncertain about BoS in FO76. At first blush, it seems they were throwing their weight around as they tried to stand down the Scorched, but then they paint themselves more sympathetically. I'm uncertain in general how I feel about where the Scorched come from and the Brotherhood's fight. They seem to diminish the weirdness/randomness and political ambiguities that could have otherwise be in place.
---
Anyway, I agree overall -- the BoS should be restricted, suspicious assholes, as their inspiration in a book like A Canticle for Leibowitz sets out.
---
I had my first failure of that one today. There were only three of us, and for some reason the PA heavy just hung back and killed wendigo spawns. The third person was a non-PA melee build with a death tambo. I'm a shotgunner tank, managed not to die but went through 50 stimpacks, 800 shotgun shells and broke my quad double barrel. I apparently don't have the damage output with that build to solo him, though it was close.
---
"I'm not mad,
---
I'm disappointed"
---
It got annoying after the 4th time in Fallout 4.
---
I don't think it's a console thing. I tried it out (PS4) and couldn't replicate it.
---
Yesh i get that.  I had with only 4 of us, 2 guys were below 100.  Well one guy was afk and naked.  I had to bust out the magic gun and we got it done but it was a pain. It sux killing 12 wendingos every mintue.
---
Seems like you new about 10 players to pull this event off....3 to 4 collecting ore, 5-6 protecting the workers on different avenues of approach
---
Hehe boiiiiiii
---
Oh Jesus Christ for real it‚Äôs gonna be hell to live anywhere b the forest after patch 22 is out
---
Haha no lol mine were all over the doors and windows of my home so I couldn‚Äôt get in besides the top balcony
---
I farm the wendigos for acid/screws/XP before focusing down Earle. The wendigos tend to drop a lot of ammo, too. The event tends to break weapons, but worth it in my book. I have a bunch of repair kits saved up.
---
Agree! At least the whole server can hit up the Queen and it really helps low levels even if they don't contribute it doesn't make a difference and the Colossus can spawn in the grove. In ACP if half the team can't hang it's a screw farm instead of a boss fight.
---
These can happen pretty much anywhere on the map, they're just easier to spot at new gad, because the lakebed's flat and huge
---
No I'm on pc, it's far more comfy for me
---
Thanks man
---
Completely irrelevant to the topic here but how do I get that dope ass enclave symbol to pop up by my name? The Enclave are the shit and I want it lol and I'm a reddit noob. Again sorry for the irrelevance lmao
---
I don't agree with your read here.
---
Platform
---
Damn. Ok. Scrip it is then lol
---
Last night i was at the golf course collecting stuff and dies 2 dudes stole all my junk there bums.
---
Just pick up kindling and add it yourself, tf? Practically every public event in 76 can be easily soloed, and campfire tales is one of the hardest to mess up. The event failed because everybody who was participating in the event, including you, was too lazy to contribute.
---
Nope.
---
I‚Äôve seen it done well with four. Rotate who‚Äôs on ore, one on each lane, on switching between the two depending on where needs crowd control. Five is perfect, assuming everyone pulls their weight.
---
First one today ended up failing in three minutes because all five other players clumped on the rear lane and just let the scavengers die.
---
Agree. It's pretty clear to me in FO4 that BoS are at least quasi-fascist, that their self-election to purifying the wastes will eventually re-categorize whatever they find 'dangerous' as eligible to be destroyed. To me FO4 casts them as more explicitly fascist, as opposed to isolationist, and gives their former isolationist qualities to the Institute. (In a way that works very well for me.)
---
Or addictol.
---
Not that I need it. But when I first got into F76 and left the vault I binged hard on booze as I couldn't find water.... I'm pretty sure the whole Firebreather quest line I spent either drunk or in withdrawals.
---
Needless to say it took forever to find addictol or a radscorpion egg.
---
Great thing about this game is you can create context or lore for yourself and try to keep it true! (Desert Ranger Armour? Explain!) 
---
And keep it to yourself like, it‚Äôs an RPG, a real fun one before the NPCs came, so. Who made the Vending Machines? It could work like a real vending machine? It could be collected by a faction of Steam punk capitalists that emerged from some vault from some state ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Jesus go play COD or some shit if you can‚Äôt figure out how to play an RPG..
---
the tag says Xbox.
---
Every camp I see always has at least one vending machine up. And it's usually more than just one lol. Its been a long time since I've even seen the camp symbol on my map without it showing up as having vending machines but maybe that's just me
---
Or they could have let them live on condition they develop an antidote.
---
76 while not the best game has probably the best and least toxic community I've seen.
---
The ammo drops arent worth it for Heavy Builds though. But I could see it helping a rifle build.
---
I hate all of the damn limits. The cap one is a pain but it's not THAT bad, but the stash one and the camp budget both grind my gears pretty good lol
---
well what other stats on it? It may be magic.
---
Fair enough. I appreciate you letting me know. I‚Äôll probably stick to trying to complete one quest line or so a day, I recently found out how to get the ammunition factory thing so I plan on grinding hard to get that
---
Well that sucks
---
The colossus was more fun as a random encounter in nuke zones. 
---
The queen reigns supreme
---
It's the WASTELAND no law and order gotta fend for your self, post apocalyptic chaos, gotta wise up man......also it's just pixels, I learnt my lessons early on If that shit looks shady don't enter... I had one the other day a level 45 lurking near his camp watching me, waiting for me to enter I got to the door peered in then turned and looked at him who was now quite far away from me, I'm level 327 with a big [50.cal](https://50.cal) and PA so he was kinda nervous it seemed, anyhoo I didn't enter and started walking towards him when pop he hops servers :P
---
U on right now
---
I usually do both in my daily routine.  I drop a SBQ first.  Then do an earl.  I just enjoy them both,   But if your not enjoying it just take a break.
---
The Empire did nothing wrong.
---
My camp is on the lead deposit in the mountains west of Top of the World, so mobs can only come from one direction. I noticed the amount of repairs I had to make went down when I finally gave up, got the home defense perk, and replaced machine gun turrets with missile turrets.
---
I'm not the OP.
---
Oh don't do that man, it's scummy to exploit. Just grind like the rest of us.
---
yeah it is! my name is also bill. thought it was funny
---
Thanks for giving it a go, that's helpful feedback.
---
I don't quite know why I'm experiencing it, but a Google doesn't seem to show other people experiencing it - I'd imagine that if it's an issue for me, then it might be an issue for others on Xbox/consoles, but who knows.
---
Lmfao
---
true that!   I lokved fighing him with all the tree dust in the air
---
There's a mod on nexus mods to only use the fast animation to enter pa.
---
I do try that, doesn‚Äôt work most of the time.  Gave up yesterday and lucked out on my first server today and got it cleared.
---
How is it an exploit to use the plan in the camp?
---
We are all Timmy and Braun keeps making us all cry
---
Just in case you didn't know. There's a free disease cure at whitesprings. When you spawn in at the golf club turn around hang left after the cars and go forward a little bit. you'll see a gazebo. And in that gazebo there's a sulfur fountain. Free disease cure.

---
You don't want that they slowly leak....
---
Honestly you might be absolutely right about the cause of the issue, but just have the game running on an older machine.
---
+1 to radkelp. I have some in my display. No clue how I got them out though
---
You're definitely looking at Standing Gorilla and not Sitting Gorilla, right?
---
Ya I had a pretty decent base and it was leveled in like six minutes
---
I would like the drone of the large generator toned down a little.
---
Unique workshop resource generators aren't meant to be blueprintable, and regular resource generators can only be placed in specific locations on the map. You're taking advantage of a bug to make the game easier for yourself in a way that goes against the tos and was not intended to be used by players. That's an exploit.
---
they used to have a chance at colored bats, those are rare now. but currently, I dont think they're worth your time
---
My old base had a wall of turrets but that looks ugly and messes with my budget
---
Me and one other guy did that event the other day, I ran and got 37 ore and he stayed up top and defended. When I noticed there was only 1 scav left, I stopped collecting and went back to defend. I think that might've been maybe the third event I've been in that actually completed.
---
Not as far as I‚Äôve gotten.
---
Same experience but I don't know about use it or lose it. I have like 260 I was gonna burn through but after waiting for the first one I was like...ok so west tek run it is...
---
All the daily limited need to be increased.   300 for gold, 300 for scrip sounds good üëçüèª
---
I think your misunderstanding? I was talking about the reward for maxing out your raider reputation, not the actual ammunition‚Äôs factory machines. I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing
---
It is 110% funny, sir. Bill (aside from his creepiness) is the realest character and gets absolutely no love. I'm glad to see someone giving him his due lol cracking an Alamo in your honor!
---
I needed to claim some workshops for the Run so I just hopped on last night, so I just was going around the forest taking over other peoples workshops and not really caring, pve pistol build, lv 57 berserkers explosive western revolver, no armour at all. A radroach can kill me in like 3 hits.
---
I see a Wanted at one of my workshops so I fast travel there, and I initiate PvP with them immediately and down them before realizing it was just some lvl 23 dude  who was trying to do the event, but.... I took their loot anyway. I check the map and see another wanted near another of my workshops and do the same thing, this time it was a lvl 8.
---
I fast travel back to the other workshop and the original dude is just walking around without his weapon out, looking at me. I got really self concious at that point because my stash was basically full and I had to be creative just to store all the junk. 
---
I felt pretty terrible at this point because I have had this done to me plenty of times, and it can be infuriating to see hours of collecting just go down the drain. But I also learned from those experiences, so I wasn't sure if giving the junk back would be the right thing to do for him or if it would just ease my concience while reinforcing bad habits from them.
---
It was awkward, them just walking around looking at me after I just looted like 75 lbs of loot from them and stashed it.
---
I left the server, not sure what the hell the right move was. They were both flagged for PvP but clearly didn't realize the consequences.
---
I think his name was bunzbear or something. If I see them again I will hook them up with a consolation prize.
---
Ooh gotcha, my mistake.
---
Turrets literally do absolutely nothing so don't even bother with them
---
Defensive walls seem to do a better job at slowing them down, also building in ways that can mess with their pathfinding 
---
Foundations at different elevations usually causes them to bug out and not attack anything
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox one
---
Need to elevate your turret then
---
I obtained a legacy bloodid plasma through legit trading so don't talk to me about effort getting one. . That beam splitter shouldn't be quadrupling the damage and the explosive damage is inconsistent.  
---
You can have dense torso, fire proof and high dr/er and ballistic explosive doesn't kill ya but with energy explosive it does  . One of these explosive damages needs a change , otherwise make ballistic consistent with energy or energy consistent with ballistic. Plus they don't drop anymore so there are finite amounts of them.
---
Plus I'm pretty sure the SH was nerfed and I was pissed about that too because i earned it back in the day.
---
Are these only out in the pts?
---
Ok foody
---
Yeah, they come out September 15th I believe
---
They should add a grafton monster/snallygaster random spawn like that to take its place
---
Yea definitely needs reworking. Thanks for the info and actually answering the question.
---
Haha you had me worried that I was doing all of that at the risk of being banned
---
And I‚Äôm on right now
---
Someone else has said scroll speed has more to do with the amount of stuff in your (overall) carry inventory.
---
at a vendor, I generally start with weapons, then apparel, then aid.
---
Usually, I was about 1/3 of the way through the aid section before it scrollled with more than a maddeningly slow tick........tick.......tick....
---
Now I‚Äôm on a weight and inventory reduction kick.  First thing I did was Moved all the read notes and holos off my person and into stash.  I know,they weigh 0, but the system still has to index and sort.  Been playing over 1-1/2 years, so you can imagine how many I had.
---
Then moved all the misc items that were not codes or keys, or diamond quest items....  
---
My menus are sooo much faster now...
---
Noob question. Daily ops are different than faction dailies, right?
---
There‚Äôs two gorillas. One sitting and one standing. They are two different plans. 
---
Now assuming you read the plan, and it still won‚Äôt let you build it, you most likely don‚Äôt have the junk materials needed. 
---
But if you know and read both plans. You have the required junk items, and it still won‚Äôt let you build it, you might have to contact support.
---
You can fight back, just can't initiate. Your at a big disadvantage because a guy completely immune to it damage can burst you dead.
---
I have a couple Mounted Owlet plans in my vendor...
---
Yep!
---
Oh definitely, one's a fetch quest the other is a rotating dungeon
---
I use a stealth commando so even without knowing about the armour noise reduction I‚Äôd use the perk for keeping stealth up for SBQ and ACP, The point I was trying to make is I play Skyrim probably 7 hours of the day and this joke of a game for about 10mins to get my gold bullion. Why am I playing a ten year old game over 76? Well the answer is obvious enough but for all my less intellectual peers here it is, stealth roll so sneak builds don‚Äôt feel crippled trying to explore, great balance so you can use more than 2 weapon types, a rich story and meaningful characters. Skyrim‚Äôs mechanics and writing make it obviously superior to fallout-wannabe-mmo-cashgrab-timegated-monotonous-crap-76.
---
TLDR: I just want to be speedy and sneaky in my secret service gear ffs .__.
---
Hhhm maybe it‚Äôs like how you get the greens from meat week
---
I think I misunderstood you.  I was under the impression you wanted to get rid of legacies like magic or hacked weapons.
---
Yea now I can be a tank, heavy AND rifleman. Alts be damned
---
I saw the chameleon Deathclaw at White Springs, actually.
---
One of my biggest peeves about One Violent Night, right there. I've had a few power squabbles about the jukebox, sort of laughable, they turn it off, I go turn it right back on, rinse and repeat.
---
Feeling like a hardcore noob right now at lv 173. What dungeon exactly? Not ACP?
---
I hear you. If you're gunning for earl it's a big ammo sink, with not much reward. Basically its something to do, and not much else.
---
Turrets don't do anything notable, they'll still just eat everything that isn't elevated while the turrets give them strongly worded letters asking them to stop
---
Ikr?!?!
---
Switching perk cards is kinda the pits
---
Did the game just cut to a credits screen after it dropped into position?
---
QQ: Companions and Turrets has levels? Apologies in advance if this is a too dumb question...
---
Not exaggerating I have 262
---
Huh. I didn‚Äôt realize that. I normally find those off boss enemies and steamer trunks.
---
Haha that would‚Äôve been fun. 
---
And then after the credits screen
---
‚ÄúHey you, you‚Äôre finally awake‚Äù
---
Won‚Äôt be on till the weekend but I‚Äôll happily give you what ever you need (supply/junk/ammo wise)
---
Hollyhowl is my ign hopefully see you then :)
---
This game has a nice community. 
---
I remember before GTA V online.
---
GTA IV multiplayer wasn't so aggressive. You met people, Had fun and more.
---
GTA V you just die for existing. Fallout 76 community is nice. It does has it's assholes and trolls but it's a nice community overall
---
Ah, this is interesting. My Aid menu can vary in length, though I tend to clear a lot of it at NPC vendors. However , I do have an awful lot of notes and holos that I've never bothered clearing. It might be time for me to dump/stash them.
---
I appreciate the recognition queen üò≥
---
The one we can do in the PTS involves repairing and defending uplinks from waves of super mutant/robots/blood eagles, then fighting a special boss creature at the end. There's different maps and effects that change up gameplay, like invisible creatures or melee only. I assume there's going to be more missions when the update comes out with different objectives.
---
I head for the ore every.single.time because I need that rad barrel plan. Last run I collected 53 pieces by myself and we still only made it to 70 ore collected. Back to vendor hopping, I guess.
---
Sadly that's the only option.  About 90% of the players I've encountered are cool, they help low level players etc... But it's that 10% that give fo76 a bad reputation.
---
Yes I‚Äôve had this happen and I just start blocking it from them. So annoying. Like the event is so easy to solo so if more ppl are there you should never fail it. Or the guys that sit outside and just kill all enemies. You know it‚Äôs annoying but if they at least let the boss get tagged I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve not received good drops from that event but I enjoy it.
---
Honestly,  I don't they should have been added in the first place but what's done is done. Deleting them after this much time won't be good, they should just adjust explosive damage for energy weapons and add the explosive major back in the Legendary weapon pool.
---
Yep...alas, that is all we get.
---
Yea those too. The only unique thing I know of is baseball bats in rare colors from aid drops like pink
---
I hope they just keep them as they are.
---
The busiest times that I've seen are between 5 and 7 am Eastern United States time.   But I'm not on the evening; for all I know, it could be busy too.   However, between 5 and 7, there are nearly always nukes going off somewhere.  
---
I'd bring more than 1K rounds.
---
I DO WHAT I WANT!
---
Yup, nothing like using exploits to grief so you yourself can get your account flagged when you get reported with evidence... says nobody ever. They patched the punji stacking; it's now considered a exploit so it is a reportable offense.
---
I have 250 can‚Äôt pick up anymore and I can‚Äôt remember when the last time I used one. Prob a year and a half ago
---
That‚Äôs the spot where I finally got them. Took long but atoms are atoms
---
I think I am 2 for 4.
---
Overencumbered and living on AP, but 
---
 Melee build with a SS ghoul slayer switchblade; much better suited to stay in place and keep one worker alive than try to run around.
---
Personally I just rolled a new one it seems to take more time to fix it than just running through it the old one could just hold scrip for purveyor sales
---
Love the Idea. More people might see my boat house camp when going over to the nuka bottling plant. Would also befit me.
---
I have found as many as 7 in the Charleston Capitol building
---
I‚Äôm not into pvp with how the game is currently laid out. But something like that would be great for a change of pace. Maybe put some unique loot in there, stuff to make it worthwhile.
---
So you get out of your PA, and before collecting/storing it you go to Transfer, and remove the core?  That sounds like even more work/delay.  
---
(Or are you referencing the fact that as long as you don't switch which PA you are using, you don't go through the animation?  I know that - but I use Excavator armor to mine, and X-01 armor for combat and switch between them often, which triggers the core insertion animation)
---
Somehow it'd be nice if the community came up with some standards for using different bag cosmetics for death drops and "free game" intentional drops.
---
As far as I know, the event does not drop anything beyond that
---
Wendigo cave always seems to have mirelurk kings. Is where you kill the Wendigo gourmands for their key fragment.
---
Mostly always low lev drops but will change soon with 1 Wasteland! Even events like that one will scale up to your lev! Can‚Äôt wait
---
Limit it to Morgantown. We have been playing hide and seek there for quite a while.
---
I didn't think about that! That will be nice.
---
Those actually do more damage that other baseball bat variants, but... well, it‚Äôs still a baseball bat.
---
Got my camp nuked once on the edge of the whitespring. Yeah, it was wrecked, but awesome too. I stopped in the fallout storm to take picts!
---
Too bad it does literally nothing.
---
I like the guaranteed WC to shoot at, but carrying gets old. I still need the helmet, so I'll keep going.
---
Use radaway and keep dehydrated and staving as well as remove any disease resistance for better results
---
Nope, as wolves are always 1-star ones.
---
But it is useful for legendary run and these low-level legendaries are perfect gifts for low-level players.
---
no, not really. just invest in hard bargain to make them a bit cheaper
---
Next time you bump into someone stacking punji boards take screenshots of it and a screenshot of the camp on the map. It was patched a while ago to prevent it from happening so the players using it now are knowingly using a exploit to work around the fact it was removed from the game. Report them for exploiting/hacking and then when Bethesda emails you send them the screenshots as evidence. Technically it's a exploit that is giving them an advantage over others so it would probably end up with repercussions.
---
The basic plans or the mods?
---
Are you on area chat or team chat?
---
You can make legendary power armor? I did not know that.
---
If you're not in a team, you should set your audio settings to "Area"... if your're in a team and only want ppl in your team to hear you, you should set your audio setting to "Team"... If your want all to hear you, whenever you're close to ppl not being on your team, you should set your audio setting to "Auto".
---
Ideally the plans but I'll take the mods.
---
Damn that'd be cool I love Bloodied plasma rifle I have I think it is kind of an unheard of weapon sometimes to see. I use sniper on mine and riflemen it up and man does it go nice as a quick method backup for the gauss rifle.
---
It's a bit more complicated than that.
---
It can't be a normal spawn, it needs to be part of a random encounter. So, basically, you can only tame stuff from random events at certain locations.
---
If you have any problems expect terrible customer support for anything that isn't an easy fix.
---
Yep I can't get sludge lung to check off despite it being the first disease I've obtained in this game
---
The lock on noise is permanently engraved into my brain from playing for 2 years
---
Junkies 1 star. Fire rate us 183 so it‚Äôs not.
---
I have a 25 ffr executioner UGL. Is that rare?
---
Other than looking good on my display shelf lol
---
The basic plans should be accessible for free from a terminal in the military wing. It‚Äôs a large red computer near the vendor, just to the right of the vendor cage.
---
Has anyone worked out the actual %age chance of it dropping?
---
Leader of the Pack has been one of my go-to‚Äôs for the legendary run. Knock out three legendary enemies and one event with no effort in minimum time
---
Stimpaks!! I look every day and rarely does anyone have them...I buy like 3-400 at a time
---
And bloodied anything
---
If you play a ton yes.
---
Nope. Scrip.
---
unless you want them urgently just wait. It'll get to the point where you can't stop making caps and you'll be glad you have something to buy
---
or bump up your charisma high as possible and it'll lower the price
---
Wow good comment
---
Good question. 
---
I once read someone talk about luck having an effect on it. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true though
---
Area
---
I just got my second piece in a week after over 400 hours with nothing...did they up the chances you think?
---
Nice. Thanks for commenting on my post. And in all caps, man you mean business.
---
Stable flux for 100caps, 5.56 and .45 for 1 caps each. Shit three star legendary weapons for 500 caps.....
---
Makes sense, was wondering why it kept changing. Hopefully they can fix it to where the flamer is usable without having to keep switching the barrels because the range without doing it is terrible, literally having to run right up to the enemy to hit them.
---
My Stash, Crafting, and pretty much all my inventory management was a laggy mess.
---
Until I found out that disposing of all the Notes and Holotapes I had been holding onto for no reason was the cause.
---
Tossed everything except my Holotape games, and things I like ("You've been insulted" collection, etc.), now my stuff is fast again.
---
JUNK! JUNKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK! Seriously junk!
---
ammo. 45 and 556 and 5mm are most popular.
---
Ammo mainly, but I'll buy your plans and weapons if they're reasonably priced (what I would sell them for).
---
Trash!! Just did 10 last night and was all scrap
---
I honestly think you‚Äôre just real lucky
---
I want to know who the miner underneath the purveyor is.
---
First rule of Junk Fight: We don't talk about Junk Fight üòÇ
---
Ha! I guess it‚Äôs R&amp;Genius making up for all the trash drops I get lol
---
Freestates then?
---
Switch to Auto and see...
---
thanks man, i appreciate it!
---
How do I get a lot of caps?
---
i really dislike the grass and i feel its very unnecessary, so thanks man!
---
It‚Äôs possible they are on team chat. Does it say ‚Äòarea‚Äô next to their name when they are talking?
---
I sure hope you haven‚Äôt used up all your luck when visiting Murmrgh the next time lol
---
I got a vampires 10mm from that event. Modded it and gave it to a guy right out of the vault. Plus 1k 10mm ammo. Caught up with him an hour later and he said he still hadn‚Äôt died. He went from level 1 to 7 without a single death......üòÆ
---
Funny. I have the opposite problem. I just started and I can only find weapons and armor too high level for me.
---
Argh, this makes me want it even more! No plans yet, just Cursed Weapons. (As a plan collector it‚Äôs driving me CRAZY!)
---
I love helping new players out.
---
I do he lil follow me emotes and craft them a set of gear they can use right on the spot.
---
Give them ammo and stims and food and water
---
Then I try to get them to follow me to hunting areas an I let them get first tap on stuff and I finish it.
---
If they have a camp up I buy all their overpriced stuffs and then throw it all back on the floor for them to loot it up and resell it again. Most people don‚Äôt have voice come or chat mod so it‚Äôs hard to get them to understand I wanna just give them money so I normally just do the camp vendor thing even though tax gets chewed up in the process.
---
Yes, if they have team chat on, you will not be able to hear them.
---
Its magic.  I have a junkies ultra gat laser that is magic.  And a junkies lmg with a 169 fire rate that is magic as well.  I tested them on the queen solo.  The 200 plus fire rate requirement is more like 150 plus.
---
This thread has encouraged me to start playing again!
---
Ahhhhhh that explains it. I know little to nothing about the PTS happenings. Thought I was totally missing something major in the live version. Phew.
---
It's an unfortunate withdrawal system caused by being separated from Fisto for an extended period of time. 
---
Poor Assaultron, I hope she gets the help she needs...
---
Some events don‚Äôt really explain what you need to do. I‚Äôm thousands of hours in and I recently realized that you need to collect ore for max rewards in radiation rumble....
---
Yup, I can build sitting but not standing. Apparently I know the plans for both.
---
Oh ok I‚Äôll try it. Currently have an IEfr LMG that‚Äôs magic. Absolutky melts Earle if he will stand still.
---
I have a tourist trap camp next to a road that doesn't get many visitors, so I love this idea.
---
this please x10000
---
Yeah I can build sitting bit not the standing. For standing it says I need to find the plans still but the plans I have in my inventory say I already know them.
---
How does one contact support?
---
*but what if I need this holotape that I picked up at level 3 again*
---
On point 3, they assume they are the most qualified to collect and maintain pre-war tech, usually depriving others from said technology without any regards for them.
---
Even as a naive vault dweller, we've seen how they operated separately from the responders (which by default are helpful to those in need and shared a goal of ending the scorched plague), trying to brute force their way into the Scorchbeast Queen. A faction that has the kind of firepower we've seen (SAM batteries, heavy weaponry, power armours), which retreated to regroup, and now feels confident to make an appearance back into Appalachia should be regarded with serious concern at least.
---
Next thing we'll know they'll be making demands at gunpoint...
---
I‚Äôm really not into it either, I pretty much hate it actually. 
---
I think people would enjoy a region with a little actual risk across all levels if the reward potential was good enough
---
Fast travel also eats caps. Plus the caps limit prevents the over hoarding of caps. You can hoard materials instead of caps, but then you have the weight limits and the daily cap limit that prevents liquidity of the hoarded materials into caps.
---
Oh no Mumbles hates me!
---
It probably won't get implemented, but it gives us all a laugh haha
---
Friends
---
While I agree, its a easy source for XP, ammo, stims, caps, and loot in general.
---
Im going full Ammo factory on my main to sell ultra ammo, but on every character im going infiltrator, maybe what rads and the poison resist (follow through if sneaky) with 3-4 special upgrades depending on my build.
---
How do you gather and add kindling for that event? Ive only done the event once or twice and couldn't figure it out.
---
Matt black fixer skin. There is...
---
She's into you, man.
---
Well, the alien blaster is getting several buffs in patch 22 to make it a more usable weapon.
---
Same apparently XD
---
Follow Though. Sneak doesn't need a buff but I'll take it anyway
---
Private server
---
Isn‚Äôt that her same house from before the war. It‚Äôs near her parents‚Äô. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure people in her profession would invest in a house like hers, too.
---
This is a glitch they introduced after an update an....  ...uh..... a long while ago. It wasn‚Äôt always like that.
---
no
---
I'm pretty sure that is her house from before the war, but I think that bunker is a new addition.
---
Brother, I found a quantum cola them immediately got a piece of pie after. Best feeling in the world, I'm only 150 hours in fyi
---
Stealing junk should be threaten as a hostile action! And the game can tell the difference between dropped bags and death bags!
---
Display your *genuine* perfectly preserved pie with honor.
---
If you are on PC, I can give you one :).
---
Found this post in Popular. It's convinced me to give FO76 a try (once the price is right).
---
I believe you can email Bethesda or go to the website and click on contact or support. 
---
They will most likely ask you to chose a ‚Äúreason‚Äù for contacting them. 
---
I‚Äôm not able to give you an easy step by step on how to do it, but you should check their website and report it as a game but. 
---
I‚Äôm sure another person here might give you a better answer.
---
I bought a tactical red headlamp for my X-01 set as a mod, not a plan, from a player vendor. I have no idea where it came from though because I've never found a single X-01 mod in the wild myself.
---
\-Bloodied/Junkie Weapons  
---
Armor is mostly out of style (since most people just get themselves Sec. Ser or T65 armor)
---
\-Stable Flux, Bulk items and Screws/Gears/Springs (for a reasonable price)
---
\-Ammo for 1 cap: 308, 50cal, .556, .45, Shotgun, Plasma Cell
---
\-Sometimes Fusion Cores
---
\-Rare plans (no miner gauntlet or chemistry station)
---
\-Rare Outfits OR craftable things like insurgents/treasure hunter
---
Although,   I will admit if they are going to fix guns in a certain order , they shoudl start with magic guns, Tesla rifles and all the broken weapons that are underperforming.  As well as energy armor penetration
---
Strangler heart isn‚Äôt legendary, but it has a set bonus if you wear all of it. Idk if it‚Äôs true that you need modules as I‚Äôve never crafted it though. But that‚Äôs be why!
---
I think that affected the probability in 4 but I have no clue about 76.
---
Sure let me just bend down here to the zipper to take it off.
---
Ammo Factory!!!!!
---
Lol I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre similar. I was merely giving a reason as to why, when I give the reasons for the BoS being a fascist facsimile, you accuse the Enclave of being fascist. 
---
Although I am curious, what specifically about the BoS faction and the enclave faction makes you think they are not fascist and fascist respectively.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work on auto either
---
&gt; I first got into F76 and left the vault I binged hard on booze as I couldn't find water
---
Guilty.
---
Ammo Factory - ACP is killing me on ammo
---
What platform are you on? On Xbox the "Find someone" function can let you rejoin a server on another character to pick up stuff you have left in a container.
---
His given name is Insult on Injury Bot, so that scams.
---
How dare I pose a question in order to hear the community‚Äôs headcanon about the vending tax.
---
Yeah, mod for pc only
---
Xbox
---
Shouldn't the Winters man Fasnacht mask be rare and not common?
---
I've found removing turrets entirely can lessen the agro range of your camp.
---
Yea I believe it affects 4 but not 76
---
I killed an AFK'r and he had 2k Circuits &amp; a gross amount of other junk on him. It was fun to listen to him begging for it back.
---
Shoot the legs if you can‚Äôt one-shot them yet
---
I returned to the game after months of not playing and immediately went to the legendary shop and randomly decided to try it.... Surprise. Pie. I ate it. Anticlimactic.
---
Yes I get it but it gets frustrating to watch the level 30 not shoot anything or do any reviving. I guess I‚Äôm just upset wasting ammo on a failure. I‚Äôm going to try doing it solo and see if it‚Äôs easier to do then with a group of ppl.
---
well, when i first got into the community i got a fair amount of hate from people that weren‚Äôt. however i‚Äôve made heaps of friends from playing fallout 76 and the community seems to always be nice (on twitter at least)
---
Prehaps modifying one of the public groups maybe exploration? Less AP drain when on roads and more when off road?
---
If I'm on my bloodied i can't, same reason i can't activate the pylons at Encrypted
---
Oddly enough in one of the cut concepts for Fallout 4, we were going to see the BoS having super "mutants" among their ranks. Now granted, these weren't regular super mutants according to the datamined model/file, which displayed an individual slightly shorter than a super mutant, but as tall as a suit of power armor who had grey skin, with hair patches growing in like a buzz-cut. From what I can tell, the lore was they managed to "stabilize" the FEV in certain subjects, effectively "fixing" the FEV virus and allowing a select few super soldiers to operate as BoS members. These soldiers were as strong as super mutants, but as intelligent as your average BoS knight, loyal too. It was a pretty basic model, but still had the adjusted skin tone/texture and "hair".
---
Sell as much as possible to vendors. They have a 1400 cap daily max so try to max it out every day. Hard bargain 3 is a great card when doing this, plus it makes the prices in the enclave a bit cheaper.
---
Oh, well, Bethesda couldn't code their way out of a wet paper bag.  Even though it is their engine they seem unable to use it anywhere near as well as the people in the modding community, which is baffling to me.
---
Of course, their inability to successfully QA...well...anything also baffles me.  Their inability to even document their patch notes is astonishing...
---
Do those traders sometimes have the Traveling Responder Bot outfits? And are they the same ones that occasionally go by your camp if you have an ally item placed down?
---
I just ran out of both Aluminium and Copper, so I started appreciating the Ore most, with the guaranteed 3 Star second. Stims, ammo and Flux as a small bonus, as well as the occasional Gas Mask for easy caps.
---
IMO Should be an atom challenge.
---
Same problem / fix really.  Generally people only sell max gear.  
---
But if you could see that a vendor was level 15 for example.  Better chance they might have properly leveled gear for you.
---
From what I could see, it seems the Appalachian chapter's new leader puts people before technology, same with the other members. Each has something they find at fault with the brotherhood ideology, something they don't agree with.
---
I figured it out last night. You have to hold the button down (charge it), then you can fire it as fast as a combat shotgun.
---
Awe man I got down voted for responding back to ppl that came on my post to just start shit.
---
I really only have a problem with the clothing/armor section. I have a problem with the weapon section as well but I have like five things in there that I never touched. So, I never really actually deal with the weapons lagging me out. Everything else is fine. Or at least unnoticeably laggy lol. Watch me take all of the stuff out and it moves super fast. "I could have had this the whole time!"
---
not hating or anything but how and why were you carrying so much ultracite without storing it
---
It doesn‚Äôt work as well though. I never buy from the atom shop since they never have the good stuff. If the good stuff was always there, I might buy it.
---
Honest to Satan, just stop doing ACP, there's really just not a reason to.  Obviously you can do what you want, but I don't find it worth while.
---
Better make a backpack of two hanging sacks and it‚Äôs a balls sac :)
---
Probably, when i claimed it the other day it said limited time item, 2 days left.
---
I'm not super high level, 95, I was at Encryptid and another player gifted me with about 15 3 star weapons.
---
Damn that‚Äôs a lot
---
&gt;In game text greatly enhances the spread of toxicity.
---
I haven't seen much of that in the games I play, but that's probably got something to do with the chat settings I usually use.   First thing I turn off is Zone/global/general whatever the main channel is. That solves most toxicity issues right there, because the ones shouting the loudest usually have the least to say. 
---
I know text chat can be a cesspool in some games, but all the mmo's I've played had pretty good filters and customization features in the chat. Five minutes of fiddling and you can cut the number of a-holes in your chat down to just the ones you like. It's trivial, really.   
---
On a personal note, I just don't like using voice chat most of the time. I can type back and forth with people all day long, but I have a weird aversion to actually speaking to strangers in-game. Probably because I have to do it at work all the time.
---
Better than going out Portal style by a pissed off AI who was tired of you monkeys in suits setting off explosives in the bunker.
---
I stopped by on my level 30 once when I forgot which character I was on. Lol. Luckily I had my Level 15 BE Pump Shotgun and a Blocking armor piece that I was testing for magic so I was still one-shotting the wendigo spawns. There were some heavy hitters that completed in about 5 minutes so that time wouldn't have actually mattered if I did a damn thing or not.
---
Lol.  I had a guy the other day on his mic say ‚Äúman your low health...here have a stimpack‚Äù.  I‚Äôm lvl 275 bloodied commando.  I just took the stimpack and gave a thumbs up just to be nice.   But chuckled inside as I did.
---
So true now that you mention it!
---
Yeah, by the end I was super fat and happy as I walked to the stash box at the purveyor.
---
End game for me, nothing else to do but drop nukes and kill high level enemies. Nothing else is challenging anymore
---
The special ones, so I can play stealth rifle/pistols and strength-based builds on the same character. If I have room than master infiltrator simply because I‚Äôm lazy. If not, I‚Äôll switch out some specials for ammo factory and infiltrator when I need them. Sucks that taking some off still uses perk coins, but it‚Äôs whatever I guess.
---
True but historically they've at least protected the settlements they took supplies from, or provided some kind of labor in return, such as escorting caravans 
---
At the very least they're more reliable than the NCR 
---
However of course this is the earliest we've ever seen the BOS so who knows what to expect really, I just hope it's done in a bit more interesting way than  just turning the BOS into just a band of brutes
---
Damn bud. 
---
That‚Äôs the earliest acquired pie I‚Äôve heard of. 
---
Hope the luck continues for your future hours!
---
SBQ is better imo
---
Either a friend or a courier.
---
Same. I thought I was alone there lmao
---
Actually that's my bad, found him passed out at Bivs, Biv had some spray paint sitting around, and told me to draw a dick on Insultbot. Well he forgot to tell me that can was pressurized. Looked like a golden statue myself after it went off. Still can taste the lead-based paint..
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to eat it! Haha
---
I get it, I get that it could happen. And like I said just seeing them sit in a corner with no gun out doing nothing was upsetting. Like if you messed up just try. If you try I won‚Äôt be mad. If you stay up top I won‚Äôt be mad. But I see you in a corner in power armor just doing nothing and we fail. It sucks. But can‚Äôt have a post on reddit with out ppl getting butt hurt. And this isn‚Äôt referring to you by the way
---
Im pretty much gauranteed 40 scrip at least from ACP, cant remember the last time QueenB dropped me anything more than 1star
---
Open your own vending machines and sell things at prices you'd be willing to pay at somebody else's machine, the caps will roll in.
---
They could just make loot bags temporarily inaccessible if the owner of the loot died in pve combat, and immediately accessible by players who killed the loot-owner in fair (as in both players engaged) pvp combat. Then, for the players whose loot is temporarily inaccessible, they could get a sort of event timer for 2 minutes to get their loot before it becomes accessible to other players. And for players who stumble upon loot that is not yet accessible, there could be the same timer next to the loot bag's name tag - giving them the chance to stay and wait or move on if they don't feel like waiting.
---
This mechanic, however, would take away from the immersive mechanic of being able to take a dead individual's stuff as soon as they die.
---
Dump stuff into a container in a remote location no one will find. Use your phone to take a photo of the "Recent" list of players on the server. Quit to main menu. Switch characters. Go to the "People" section of the dashboard and go to "Find someone". Search for people who were on the "Recent" list and join their game. That can get you back on the same server if they haven't server hopped. Go back to the container and pick up your loot.
---
It's risky, but it is how I transfer stuff between characters without Fallout 1st.
---
One thing I would love to be able to do is take the dick heads who hide punji boards out the ass in their camps to kill people those people deserve to be nuked
---
Pisses me of, we have massive server stability problems yet at no point during the loading screen messages does it say clean out your inventory. On a side note I would love for Bethesda to give us a form of key safe in our camp, so we dont have to scroll threw out misc tab looking for ores and repair kits.
---
Guaranteed 2 star drops now.
---
What Rads? My dreams of running naked through a nuke zone are finally coming true!
---
I'm so lucky, thank you.  
---
Here's my vid:

Do people buy chems?
---
1v1 wildy
---
Love the reference to Vlad the Impaler! Also, this weapon shines as Quad Explosive, so I'd definitely search for that to do a review on.
---
Such a pain feeding what I assume is an LMG. Those things be hungry.
---
yeah. Theres one trader who appears that has the chance to have the good shit. And then there's one that has bow plans and another that has drug plans. Those ones that come to your camp never have the good shit. Well. the ammo bulk is good shit.
---
