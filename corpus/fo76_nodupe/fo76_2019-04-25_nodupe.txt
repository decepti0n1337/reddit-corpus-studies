can i have all your dope items when you ragequit?

If you have the green thumb and Woodchuck perks they stack so you get 4 pieces of Dogwood per plant

White Spring Zoning Officer here I noticed a few safety issues.
---

---
1. The structure needs to be secured to a foundation we can't have the structure falling on an innocent ghoul.
---
2. The White Springs planning board decided that you need a 150 yard setback from the club house.
---
3. It's considered by many a d*ck move to put a camp behind the clubhouse I personally destroy all of them I come across.
---
It's happened to me on several occasions but if I just wait a minute or two then I'm released from the bench. It must be some sort of a lag.
---
Build half walls down from the floor and then put a foundation. Once that’s in place you should be able to scrap the upper parts
---
Are you still there?

Excevator double mining HAS NEVER worked for me... :(

Your explanation is a-ok. Just a bit over my head with the logistics. I'm not the brightest bulb when it comes to server abilities.
---
You just went full White Chicks on us right there and threw a bitch fit, never go full White Chicks.

Thanks for the photo I had been server hopping all morning at the water park it feels like all morning and a couple other places but found it here first time thanks &lt;3
---
I have seen prices between 50k and 225k for explosive lasers
---
I’ve been thinking about this a bit recently. The recent new content is not major content. If said content was in game when we each first started playing, it’d be fun random things to discover and do while we explored Appalachia.
---
But (for me anyhow) since we’ve done everything else, we rush to that new nugget of content to experience something new, and burn through it quickly. 
---
Mistress of Mysteries was my favorite quest so far. That took time for me to achieve. It took me to locations that I was not ready for; couldn’t fast travel to get to the next part of the story. So I had to wait at times. Do the next step when I finally could. 
---
But now I can jump around, snap a few photos and be done in a couple of hours or less. 
---
I stopped after 3 of 7 photos last night. I decided to finish this without fast travel and when I get around to it.
---
I think they messed up again
---
Need more emotes /s
---
Nice picture though.
---
Sorry about that my Chameleon build is really good and I swiped them from you.
---
I am!  If you have a recipe I’d love to trade for one.
---
Tbh, I only have lvl35 AA ML; when used on mire queen (no video though) it was much worse than that TS, but I can't really say whether that was due to the level difference. Do test it and let me know!
---
Hey I found this quest like a week ago i think so I don’t believe it was added with the next patch yesterday but still cool to find
---
Challenge accepted! Time to brew a fuck-ton of Nukashine.

I found them. I’m still looking for the mine though.

Try re logging. My X0-1 mods worked, so it might not be the same bug.

Move camp somewhere else that’s it

Blurrily, if that's the case.

I spent almost 2 hours going to every tourist trap I could think of. Gave up and started server hopping at one spot while I was watching Netflix and had the camera after about a dozen hops.

If I could fast travel while overencumbered I would be the junk god of the wastes. That's why you can't, it nerfs you. Thats the way it should be if you ask me.
---
Not your fault. I blame myself. It breaks down to ease of use/setup over player use/ capabilities.
---
I have a Quad Western Revolver that I desperately want to love.
---
Question, had I done that, what could I do to fix it? I'll attempt it to see if it works because I'm willing to do anything at this point..
---
I haven't fast traveled in a month...but speed demon is helping me cut through my aid a bit finally
---
PC or console? I'm on PC and for the past few days nothing has spawned there.
---
Do it all the time Al rise or instagating ski sword. If your using a powerfist/gauntlet it might be different
---
Yeah! What these guys above me said! How dare you criticize a literal game-breaking big! You expect the devs to test this stuff out beforehand...for free!?!
---
I bought this and I’m extremely disappointed. Standalone weapon, no legendary effects, need to learn a plan through RNG just to make the thing I paid for? What the fuck
---
Can I help you do some of those quests??
---
Thanks for this man! I've been trying for ages to get one to spawn!
---
im a hairstylist irl and I fully support an ombre lmaooo, or at least some form of balayage
---
even if you had repair kits, you'd still use durability duration perks. Otherwise you'd just be going into your pipboy to use more repair kits more often.
---
The person with the repair kit gets absolutely no advantage from having the repair kit or not using 5 int on gunsmith.
---
How do you not understand this?
---
Happy to help :)
---
Not coming till May.
---
Wow.... ok
---
You have to remember that Bethesda is running off of a heavily modified single player engine, it's not designed to do anything required for multiplayer. Every other MMO is running on engines designed for multiplayer with all the technology needed to run instances baked in
---
I looked at the challenge and saw alien for the first one, took  a moment to do the math on my 3 flatwoods monster sightings in over 500 hours game time, and didn't even bother checking what the other pictures were.
---
Never learned serendipity, use a good melee build inc slugger 3* + the BSSledge as mention 😉
---
(spoilers)
---
Are you sure it's the same quest?   Cuz all the internet only said there's the toxic Larry meat and go mission, and then the mission you get from a paper at southern Belle hotel.  Never heard of this one until I found it.. this was a mission about two friends, girls, and one pretty much cheated at every game they played.  Then one drowns the other.
---
We all know Bethesda doesn't do updates,... just glitchdates.
---
JEEZUS
---
I already did most of them actually, these screenshots are a week old.
---
If I happen to be on that server when the fights are going, I'm just gonna be in my trench coat in the shadows whispering to basserbys, "Hey kid... wanna buy some death sticks.." seems like a good place to sell. XD
---
Thank God. I had anxiety
---
You seem to not grasp that fun is subjective.  Not everyone feels gathering junk is a chore, and I am certain there are those who actively enjoy it since such things are always on a sliding scale.  Again, claiming its bad design or malicious is a false dichotomy and relies on numerous assumptions regarding the driving goals of the change.  
---
You are basing everything in the sole assumption that the intent is to either remove something not fun for people or to drive people to require them without giving consideration to the array of in between or possible other influences.  People have requested this since BETA.  The pricing is low enough it may be intended to aid lower level players/new players as they level and learn by using acquired atoms (not necessarily purchased).  Clearly there is a desire for us to spend money on the atomic shop (since it is how the game is intended to be sustained for further content development and running in general over time), and this might be a way they hope to have people go there more to spend more (along with things like the news that was added).  Without knowing what drive the decision and what they are hoping to achieve, it isn't reasonable to claim it's objectively bad design or malicious.  Nor do you have to like it or support it, but not catering to your preference isn't objectively bad design.
---
They inadvertently did yesterday with the camera launch glitch. Just get one of those new cameras and have it in hand. Now just do an emote and it’ll send you flying to the left of your character. You may get flung into the sky this way so if you can negate fall damage with goat legs or armor, I’d recommend it. You can use this strategically to an extent.
---
I don't see how the turrets would benefit the creator of the turrets since you need to tag the monsters. The turrets would not count.
---
I bought this to compliment my Bloodied Assultron Head, but on learning that it is a seperate craft able with thr same stats and more expensive ingredients to a normal seperate craft able Assultron head, I requested a refund to Bethesda customer support, they promptly gave me my 500 atoms back in the next hour and suggested that I submit a feedback ticket about asking for a skin varient!
---
The ole 2^32 never gets old
---
Same, I have a two shot western and a 3* quad single action that is unusable bc of the 24 bullet reload
---
both of you set your items to their value, say 2000 caps. then if they bail at least you got fair cap value out of it.
---
I don't have it, only Flatwoods Monster. Perhaps another weird thing might trigger it.
---
Found Ansel at Tyler Country Fairgrounds.
---
For some reason I don’t have it, so I couldn’t tell you...
---
Tbh I don't think there are any lol not surprised though its bethesda
---
Do you survive if you’re in power armor?
---
Furious prefix encourages multiple hits.  Mod that to an automatic receiver and go commando (no pants!)
---
I mean it would still be fine as a manual rifle, but most things are already going to die in 1 or 2 shots anyway.
---
If they keep nerfing everything the game will become so bland I’m not sure there would be much point in playing it. There should be challenge and death in Adventure mode not just for the Survivalists.
---
I’m sorry but who gives af about them being in the shop just don’t buy them idiots and scorch beast drops a advanced one
---
What happens if the item is more expensive then the other item?
---
The camera isn't bugged its how that tourist got around the map so fast. 
---
Sadly he didn't use falling perks and fell to his death after a bad emote.
---
Idk haven’t tried it, but you probably do because you die of fall damage
---
His dying emote lol
---
Yeah! Thanks.  I couldn't remember the full setup.   I remembered the device by the BOS compound.  I figure they should make that into a gun.  The vaulters are industrious, no?
---
I had the body disappear very quickly but Somehow able to loot it where it had been although it had seemed to vanish.
---
They updated the Wild Appalachia calendar when they announced it was being pushed to reflect said push.

Maybe its your cologne?  They like something you cook?
---
This can also happen when using a 2 handed weapon, targeting a scorchbeast in VATS, and having the scorchbeast fly directly overhead. 
---
My arms glitched out and appeared to collide with each other trying to move over my head to continue aiming at him, and suddenly I flew across the map. Cost me 5 caps to fast travel back, so it wasn't too far but still a pretty good distance.
---
Anyone who is willing to pay can negate the cost. My objection isn't even about how many people may or may not choose to do so, it is quite literally about having the option to do so.
---
This should not even be an option here. It wasn't an option until this patch.
---
You can call the fact that this is now possible alarmist all day but the facts are it wasn't even an issue until this patch AT ALL.
---
I love it! Love to see more stuff like this tbh.

I've got a nice little handful of very high end sniper rifles with a great sniper build, which is why I offered.  AA/E vs I/E vs TS/E vs I/limb damage, which is the clear king in my book for one shot kills and annihilating a leg or wing to render a ruthless killer into a helpless enemy.
---
My friends and I (along with a larger group from the Bethesda FO76 forum) have already tested that now debunked "weekly challenge" theory. As it currently stands the theory is that it will be the reward for one of the new Unsolved quests that will be released. I mean, we have already seen the picnic blanket as a reward for one of the Unsolved quest.
---
Every game i listed up there proves you wrong, care to address that?
---
This is just a method of making sure no one walks away with nothing, you have to match caps unless you were planning on paying extra caps on top of the cheaper weapon.
---
Well then go with an amount close to the higher item you both will get your caps back
---
Are you still on?
---
Since I sell on one of the market places on Reddit they have lists of trusted middlemen that you can use that will take both items and distribute them. That would be the best way imo.
---
Have you tried using the terminal to teach you the plans again?
---
I am!
---
It says it's loading the plans to an external device, but nothing happens.
---
[removed]
---
How do you get the enclave armor?
---
Yes.  Repairs my ski swords 200% every time.
---
The Beer Keg is not from a weekly, you're only filling people with false beliefs. Anywho, it is more likely from some unreleased Unsolved quest.
---
I have several risque messages written in neon, maybe they are just thirsty creeps

More hair colors would be nice but probably won’t be purchased by many. My character has a certain look and I couldn’t see her any other way. But, like you stated before it wouldn’t be hard to do, and there’s already a hair parlor it could be done at! I don’t know how and if atoms could be spent at in in-game locations, but it could be however much atoms to “book an appointment”. I just want new hairstyles but that probably won’t happen until the next game since it’s a long process to make.
---
Exactly. It’s that or high end trades. The market for legacy explosive energy weapons is out of control. Saw a bloodied explosive go for 225k yesterday. Vampire explosive was 85k before it sold on Facebook.
---
Yes it sucks but it's how they plan to make money and if someone else buying atoms means the servers stay up longer then I'm all for it
---
So many repair perks for rifles and PA, melee needs some love.

I see him quite often from my base on PS4. He walks along the base of the mountain between gorge junkyard and morgantown station
---
Without weapons there's not much you could do to one punch. Fist damage is pretty low just going off adrenal and a few perk cards. It's going to be alot of couch spamming to break vats combos, and hoping to throw a block before they press that Vats Crit button on your noggen.
---
Why are you even playing this game if you hate it so much? Go play some GTA Online instead and pick yourself up a few shark cards.
---
The atom repair kits only go to 100%, and the quest/event reward repair kits only go to 150%. You can still be the 200% guy.
---
Who even needs that much caps like *bruh sound effect #2*
---
Bravo isn't solved yet on nukacrypt for this week, so this is news.
---
I've been selling my mark 3 stealth boys because of them never working!

I support this fully. I love my berserker hunting rifle but it's very one dimensional gameplay.
---
While we're at it, can we fix nocturnal so it's not worse than a non legendary weapon
---
Borderlands 2 has a trading system in place for this. That was back in 2012 btw.
---
I can’t believe repair kits in the Atomic Shop is what’s keeping you kids up at night. I’d hate to see how depressed and frustrated you’d get if you got hit with a real problem.
---
I’d buy one!
---
Thanks for reminding me to buy one.
---
I know you're doing what you can in terms of relaying info back and forth, and I refuse to shoot the messenger, but when you say this after the deluge of community outcry *against* putting utility items in the Atomic Shop, it just makes you and the rest of the team at BGSA sound bad. 
---
The logic put forward for *why* they were added was eh at best. While use in combat doesn't give much of an advantage, really, it's still something the majority of people I've spoken to or read didn't like. 
---
You can still remove them from the shop and put them at every vendor, both as an item for sale and a plan. It'd be great for these to be tradable items as well, at least after a while. Who knows how many players bought dozens or hundreds of them on the first day? 
---
I loved this user's idea for utility item *skins* being in the shop. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgpi42/a_different_way_to_handle_atom_shop_utility_items/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Thank you!
---
Yea, but apparently no one that works at Bethesda has ever actually played an MMO
---
How can you not understand that a repair kit is not cosmetic, unless you’re just choosing to be contrary?  It makes a broken weapon or piece of armor go from “not working” to “working”.  That has an affect in combat.
---
Furthermore, if people don’t have to stop combat to repair items, or spend the time to gather resources to repair, that has an effect.  I’m not saying it makes or breaks the gameplay, but it is NOT cosmetic.  It has a real effect to gameplay, unlike, say, a cane having red and white stripes 0.o
---
Just saved me the hassle as I was only going to get it if it was an actual skin for a legendary variant I have. Thank you
---
Bethesda, please let me decorate my camp with repair kits! Until you give in to my demand this game sucks and I’ll never play it again! Just kidding, I love Todd Howard.
---
u/Valseek Any chance this could be fixed? Possibly making it so people who have the quest complete can use the terminal to actually get the plans rather than being kicked out by an oversight? Also, could the registration system be improved to not allow people who aren't on that part of the quest to register their power armor? Just some feedbackz
---
If you took a look at my post history you would see that I'm an active data miner. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh and for proof: [https://imgur.com/3xrnoan](https://imgur.com/3xrnoan)
---
I've witnessed it happen to a random's base, turning round to hear a huge metallic clattering and went to witness everything blow up!
---
I love the look of it, as a water cooled machine gun, or rifle made for power armor.
---
But as THE assault rifle, it just isn’t right. Especially when we already had the R91 and service rifles.
---
I'm not against inconvenience in games as part of a system to push behaviors. 
---
If I were redesigning the perk system, I'd probably do something similar to your idea.  I'd have crafting, hacking, lockpicking be permanent skills that you either had to discover in world or actively quest for.
---
I'd have gathering, damage, condition related perks similar to now, but the limit is based on int.  Actual int,so mentats and mutations affect it.
---
People really sleep on the 10% mutant's effect.  I see a lot of weapons being vendored because it's "only mutant's/explosive" and not AA/E or TS/E.  People are crazy with what they sell.  I bought a *** TSE handmade from the Charleston Station a while back for like 250 caps the day after the TSE nerf.  The only slight downside is that it's lvl 35 and does a couple less damage.  Somebody fucked up bad with that decision.
---
Do you teleport through walls with this. not got camera yet but was wondering if could get into that legendary vendor bots room at that train station????
---
speedy are you talking about the one day exclusive hotter rod paint? because it's blue and has flames
---
(I know this is a old reply)
---
Looks like I'll be back in May, haven't played since Dec..
---
lol this is effectively a skin, you can't craft it for free and you need the plan. I'm actually pissed that I can't use a legendary for it and you fucking mungos are focusing on the wrong issue. 
---
If you need all the same prerequisites to craft this one as the regular, how is this p2w or an actual Weapon? Tell me how this is isn't cosmetic only please.
---
Yeah, thanks to you I was able to get the quest on all three of my characters...which if I had kept trying to do it on my own...would have taken forever lol.
---
It is, at least for us. The devs probably made it the way they did so that a new player who's exploring will find it randomly. iirc there are two people that spawn holding the camera, that's probably so there are two quest spawns on each server (I can only guess though, no idea if their spawn is guaranteed at at least one location each). Probably would be better to just have them permanent at attractions that don't have much else going for them, like the Nuka Cola plant or the Miner Monument.
---
I don't blame you lol when they work they're kinda useful in PvP against VATS builds but other than that, just kinda take up space.
---
Just add it in. It doesn’t need to be a skin.
---
Thank you, nobody else has had any extras. I didn’t make the post to beg for it but it’s really uplifting seeing how many people want to help out. :)
---
I did this and It threw me right out of the server.
---
It's honestly a terrible setup given that a large number of our weekly challenges (not to mention dailies) revolve around it...
---
we just solved it so Nukacrypt will be updating very soon.
---
Sometimes you just gotta hit the player vendors for the things you can’t find if it’s making you crazy cause you can’t find it. First 3 months I wanted that jet pack cause I loved it in Fo4. I set my base close to whitesprings and hit that vendor multiple servers a day. Months later, still nothing.  Hell, my base is still in the same spot. And I still check regularly. Not. A. Friggen. Once. 
---
Grinded junk and sold, bought for 1.5K.
---
Agreed.
---
You can always sell your duplicate plans for some caps
---
You probably can. One of the times I spawned under the ground then got put back since I was out of bounds. There's as far as I can tell no way to aim where you end up, so you can't reliably glitch into anywhere specific.
---
+karma
---
I have a TS Gatling plasma level 40 that does more damage than a level 50. even though it was nerfed, it is still really strong
---
Cant place atomic store items in a teamates base, or so I've been told
---
Thank you so much. I've server hopped 30+ times and nothing. Sent you a friend request and I've joined your world and I'm headed over to the monument. Really appreciate it!
---
Seems to be hit or miss. Friend did this and it worked, I did it and it did not work. So unless they come up with a fix, I will never be able to complete location challenges, etc.
---
Dang, that does suck!
---
I was in the same boat... I hopped dozens of times at the monument, gave up in disgust, trying Wavy Willard's and a couple others with the same bum luck. Coming back to the monument somehow did the trick.
---
Join the enclave and you'll get the plans for free, then you craft it.
---
If it’s anything like the Burrows, then no.
---
It reminds me of lhugueny.
---
This read like arguments you have in your head while taking a shower.
---
ugly as it is it's based on the [Lewis](https://www.rockislandauction.com/html/dev_cdn/71/3558.webp) machine gun
---
Do I really need to explain pvp is players attacking other players?
---
I stopped doing them... I get that damn lead mamosa thing 6 times already and the oak Holla beer 4... I dont care... I dont grind for bs
---
This would be helpful for people with a lack of atoms so people with not much atoms will flock to these events making some events not so dead. This would be a great idea to make people do events and i think they should add it to the game.
---
No worries, if it comes up as a reward again I’ll try to remember and msg you.
---
Commando. I have almost the same gun accept with VATS crit instead of Perception. It really shines as an automatic rifle.
---
Well it's stuff that hasn't been released yet.... so....
---
lovin' the 10mm..been my weapon of choice since Fallout 3
---
Spent the last of what I had last night getting that sweet Plague Rider armor. 100% in on those. Would like to see more of the same too. $40 in when I get to play next.
---
It's perfectly okay to have but it is rare.  If your on PC I'll make you one. 
---
Proof: https://imgur.com/FPABWb5
---
At the moment laser rifle still breaks after a couple kills, so it's not worth using it. Tesla is also just generally better for both ammo saving and armored enemies, because it has higher damage per hit and can chain enemies. The only real downside to the tesla is its range and low ammo capacity
---
Thanks :)
---
Are you really surprised?
---
Sure, inconvenience can serve a purpose... like having to farm junk to keep things repaired. Inconvenience that drives compelling gameplay, leading you to explore.
---
However, perk card flip flopping doesnt drive compelling gameplay. Its inconvenience without a purpose. Its not a meaningful part of the system, it's an unfortunate side effect of their bad implementation of a decent concept.
---
Yeah let the ban wave begin.
---
When you notice the problem, I'd say, probably as depressed and frustrated as you would get.
---
Mine might be glitched but I load 6 rounds and have 24 I was just smoking low level scorched with it.
---
Luck. I somehow got the plans to build the leg pieces, and my friend got the plans to build the chestpiece. It’s just pure luck. Open locked containers around public workshops, there’s chances for plans to be in there.
---
I would fully support this decision.
---
If my level of surprise were measured on a scale from 1 (totally not surprised) to 100 (flabbergasted with supriseration)... I would rate this about -50.
---
you did get your clue.  if it was a bug they would have responded acknowledging it, so there must be a way to find an alien in game now.  it's probably a random encounter with a one in a bagillion chance of it happening...
---
🙋🏻‍♂️
---
Okay, should I use a drum magazine or a stinging magazine
---
too many posts about it, they acknowledged the camera challenge bug, why not this one?  aliens in the game confirmed.
---
Nope not working. Click on targeting hud, hit x to confirm, hear the sound as if it crafted, then nothing. Then keep hitting x like a mad man from frustration.
---
Did you have a workshop?
---
The single action reloads bullet by bullet unfortunately
---
they're in the game, probably a random encounter, otherwise Beth would've acknowledged the bug already, it is to do with challenges and the camera one was acknowledged...
---
Yes I didn't know that automatically made me fair game when I wasn't even near the place
---
Neither use a perforating if it has it for superior armor pen.
---
Bethesda could really tap into nostalgia with weapon Skins of guns from 1, 2, 3 and New Vegas. Stuff like the Winchester P94 plasma rifle from Fallout 1 and 2, or the Gatling Laser from 3 and New Vegas, hell I’d be happy if I just got a Colt 6520. Fallout has so many unique weapons, I hope Bethesda will be adding them over time, or at least skins that look like them.
---
Anyone taking that workshop will instantly trigger you for PvP
---
You represent the majority. Got it
---
The Flogger strikes again
---
Pacifist mode means you can't damage othets.  The converse is not so.
---
My guess you either owned a workstation and part of a team stayed there while the PvPer came to you and powered up in order to gank you. 
---
Or..
---
You were accidentally on a PvP server?
---
I might. I’ll look tomorrow.
---
It’s a Bethesda game not even a year after release. You gotta give Bethesda games time.
---
I mean, as far as we can find, they aren't fully in the game yet, only as name files and stats if i recall.  i really don't think  they are fully done and set to spawn yet, otherwise someone would have found one already...  They are probably being saved for the space station.
---
That sucks
---
I'm on PC, which location are you referring to?
---
the challenge did work for me.  
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/8JaTZG5](https://imgur.com/gallery/8JaTZG5)   
---
Found the alien near by Berkeley Springs.
---
I’m probably being dumb but how do you actually get the camera? Do you have to make it or what?
---
No, not anyone.  As previously mentioned, you have to play a build designed to not need ammo, not need to mod gear (so already have perfect roll legendary armor and weapons), and have no interest in your camp.  That is quite a list of qualifiers you just arbitrarily ignore in favor of misrepresenting the truth.
---
None of this validates your claims that these negate the need for junk and eliminated the risk of death for everyone.  Even if everyone bought them that would remain false, as I and others have shown.  Most players use ammo, don't have perfect roll gear, and do work on their camps.  Repair kits are an inferior option to repairing using perks to get 200% durability.  Most players will continue to need junk.  
---
People have asked for this since the beta (which I have also been playing since).  While it isn't a change I wanted or agree with, I find all the ridiculous claims about it to be far more intolerable.  The change itself isn't alarmist (it literally can't be by definition of the word).  People reacting by making exaggerated claims to spread worry are alarmist.
---
PS4?
---
Fixer with Commando, Covert and Sneak is IMO the most powerful build right now. The furious handmade auto is right there within a few points.
---
Yea I stopped doin them... I got the mamosa 6 times.. and oak holla 4 times... red ant 3 times... so yea.. I dont do any booze challenge
---
Grafton Steel. For the past few days nothing has spawned there.
---
It’s in less than two weeks on May 7th...
---
Here is what your missing. The stuff it takes to repair takes a minute at most to get when in a dungeon. That's not an issue. 
---
Ontop of that, if you repaired an exact copy of my melee weapon and armor with those, then stood side by side to me, I'd be about 1.25 times more powerful. Because I can repair 200%. Ontop of that, if I truly want to buy one my self, I can because it doesnt cost me a dime to play the game and get free atoms. It may not be a true cosmetic - but it has zero impact.
---
Those who are crying over this are fanatics - crazies - who will take every single thing to court. Would you sue someone over breaking a pinky promise to you? At the end of the day, they started to add items that have zero impact in game to you. Are you about to go do a dungeon? Check your weapons and make sure you are above 99% repaired and you dont have an issue. Period.
---
This is the exact same complaint every other ingrate who doesn't like events says! Much like I say to the lovely folks on r/WWII when they demand events be reopened since "game dead". It's limited time for a reason. That's what makes it unique and special. I ground 500 atoms in two days for the moonshine mama mask it's easy as hell to do. Stop crying in the rain and move on.
---
Free to play/pay to win?
---
My location ones are still not working (even in the new character), but I was glad I at least got the recipe ones.  I do hope they fix the locations one day.
---
Sent request but I guess you’re offline now.
---
"sell" the item for a realistic price, and "buy" the other person's item for a realistic price. That way if one of you backs out you don't end up losing anything
---
That’s the million dollar question lmfao
---
What is wrong with u
---
you've never actually played warframe, have you?
---
Now we just need portable holotape recorders and we can re-enact *War of The Worlds*.
---
"Here we are, in the middle of ground zero, gatling fire really heating up on the Scorch Beast Queen. Boy look at the size of that thing, its really taking a beating! There are various mutated creatures closing on our position, from all directions. (Yells away from mic) *Keep that radaway coming Sparky, Fred keep rolling!*"
---
**BOOM**
---
"She's landed, she's landed. Power-Suited 76er's are rushing in with clubs, blades, anything they can get their hands on and... wait.."
---
"ATTENTION, NUCLEAR STRIKE EMINENT"
---
"Ok folks, we seem to be in the blast zone for yet another nuclear touchdown, so we're going to start running now. And remember, for all of your nuclear de-contamination needs, choose ABRAXO!"
---
Yep that was it.
---
You can edit the pics you take with the camera?
---
I spawned one in the Grafton Steel workshop and it counted.
---
You can also use it to make fascnatch sausages and mystery meat pie
---
I haven't gotten any duplicates since they added in all the ranks. I got them in order over a couple of weeks and none since. Before that you could get duplicates of initiate. I still do them since it's on my grinding route but it's been over a month since i got elder and none since.
---
Can't wait for you stupid fucking Bethesda dev's to ruin TES 6 with MTX. 
---
Honestly, listen to the community you stupid fucks.
---
I've been living in mine the last few weeks. Sucks since my armor rating is lower in it than out of it, but I prefer being able to walk at a normal speed and fast travel. Can't wait for the legendary vendor so I can dump all the crap weighing me down and get back to my T-51b.
---
Other reports say targeting HUD is still broken even though everything else (?) seems to work.
---
with the crazy rng in this game I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn they are in fact in the game and literally no one has seen them yet.  some go months of playing without ever seeing a rad storm, I only ever saw 1, ONE!
---
inb4 the bow is as almost as useless as the crossbow.
---
i just got the survival mode weekly. TS fast reload faster shot 50. its not bad at all.
---
Such an asinine way to start a quest like this, ugh, annoying. In any case, if you need the Marsupial mutation, I'll be happy to make it for you, if you bring the flux (I have the other ingredients). Still trying to make enough caps to buy the other serum recipes.
---
If you don't find someone try hopping Grafton dam or other PA spawns in the top half. A lot of those spawn the lower level parts. If you're on in like 3 hours I'll be on to help if you still need it. I can 200% things anyways.
---
It's like people dont understand the mechanics on owning a workshop. Smh.
---
Most likely have to settle for twitch, seeing as server space is very limited. I'm sure the world will be full rather quickly, so not everyone will be able to join unfortunately.
---
Don’t use workshops. Period. They won’t give you as much as simple farming. I’m high level and I don’t use them. 
---
Instead ask, “hey, I need steel, what do I kill for it?”
---
Or “Who drops what?”
---
Seriously, I gave up on them long ago.
---
That really stinks. Iv met a few people from the market and have helped each other transfer large amounts of caps and gear within a few minutes of meeting each other with no issues. But it only takes one person to ruin a good thing. 
---
If your on PS4 and ever need a hand I will help you out, I’m trustworthy and have good karma on the market. Psn sneazel
---
What platform are you on? My AAE combat works fine in pvp and pve.  But I am curious about this...
---
Thanks! Though in a great irony I literally just bought it a couple days ago... I can make grounded if you ever need it though
---
I don't know a way to fix it. I've only ever seen others report the same situation. I've never seen a solution.
---
No one forced a multi million dollar studio to release a half baked shitty online game. How stupid are you?
---
Ah, no. PC. Darn. I'll edit the post to reflect that.
---
I got one a few minutes ago at the munitions factory. You have to make sure it says the name of the robot in the upper right corner of the camera view for it to count
---
nah im still on i accepted it
---
Ok I have so many
---
Something mildly interesting about that... I renamed the weapon I usually attack Scorchbeasts with "Dragonrend", and the game forced the capitalization to change to "DragonRend". Happens with any item I try to rename that way. Only instance I've seen it happen.
---
He activated the pylon and sneak critical shotted you. It’s like 400 - 1000 damage depending on his or her weapon and build. Sorry mate.
---
Notices were sent out at the start of December. By your counting method you pretty didn't including December. A lot of us Received our Emails at the Very START of December. You pretty much just threw 31 days out the window.
---
December First month  31 days
---
January Second Month 31 days
---
February Third Month 28 days
---
March Fourth Month 31 days
---
April Firth Month 24/30 days so far. 
---
Thats 5.75 months so far. They have from the day of this post 37 Days left by the time we hit the end of month 6.
---
SO when May 31 arrives. Thats the END of the 6 Month. Not the Start of the 6.
---
Check the receptionist desk at biv's.
---
T45 isn't as good as excavator.  I promise you that you'll miss your excavator.
---
I gave it the name "Infinite Reload"
---
Probably none
---
It’s better protection wise? The only downside is that the excavator has extra carry weight
---
Aw thanks - may take you up on that when I get starched genes on my alt.
---
Goto a farm(I use the billings homestead), and drink the non fermented beer. Thats how I used to do mine.
---
For the addictol?? Thank you but still unless there is 5 of em right there it dont make it right
---
Hey dude, this looks super cool! I have a ton of plans hoarded, are there any in particular you're looking for?
---
And related, have you set up a discord? Since there seems to be a ton of interest it might benefit you to make one to organize in real-time.
---
I just finished doing the challenge of taking photos of 76 between animals and enemies. the list is longer than 76 but some of them are extremely rare ,like glowing behemoth( nuke only), or glowing mothman(never even seen it).
---
Point is in those 76,none of them unlocked the "alien" by mistake.
---
By claiming the workshop you are automatically pvp.  They are probably all perked up to do crazy amounts of dmg.
---
That's fine for some of em... but this is more about the craft/drank different kinds ones
---
Good to know. I'll avoid that.
---
Erm, where abouts is that?
---
Every power armor is going to give you great protection.  Might as well go with the one that lets you carry more.
---
Yeah sometimes if u server hop..u will get it twice in a row..and do u know the church at harpers? Next to armor bench deep pocketed leather arm limbs spawn
---
Still there? Lol doubt it ...😭
---
No, unless you want to risk losing it all.
---
Yeah, it does make it quite a bit more difficult to make 15 different ones. Eventually you get many different kinds of beer though.  1-2 hours worth of waiting for all of them to ferment though is kinda ridiculous. If you have to craft them all from scratch
---
How can I support our boys in the lab working on these codes?
---
They're the true heroes
---
I checked shops for a few days finally found it near Lewisburg.
---
There is but you have a chance of losing your items to server crashes etc
---
You can find a container like the beehives by the Gilman lumber mill and put your items you wish to transfer in the hives and then rejoin on someone who is in your world and grab the stuff from your other charActer. But again you risk server crashes etc
---
From what I've read it works on all PA, but it only has the X-01 model... so anything you put it on looks like the X-01.
---
Lol I actually really like it
---
Store the thing it’s sitting on, your turret will come back in storage
---
Yurp
---
Short answer: no.
---
Better answers, either make some friends that'll do it occasionally or you can post in the market forums looking for the service. Your best bet is to find someone with high karma in that subforum and you pay them some caps for their time doing it.
---
What platform?
---
I want in
---
Do you have any "friends" that play? Not necessarily people that you know personally but just people on your friends list that play the game. If so join their server, dump your items into an in world bag then switch characters to claim the items. Your friend doesn't need to know unless you're worried about them switching servers. It's not fool proof but it works.
---
R u accidentally in survival?
---
Yeah when I first saw the gun in FO4 trailers/gameplay I thought it was an LMG and that a different rifle would have the mantle of “assault Rifle”
---
Miss the old model:(
---
Check the Giant Teapot. I usually see multiple ants during the event, and you have a chance to get even more ant meat with Butcher’s Bounty.
---
Ever wonder why they didn’t just call it the 1cm?
---
 Hahaha like the money made from these shit heap games goes into the developers pockets and not to the shareholders and CEO! Read up on the gaming industry, you’ll realize these cash grab games are bullshit that overworked, underpaid developers are bullied into making by scummy, rich boys who probably haven’t played a video game in their life. Plus, Bethesda already should have made their money back because the game was “a huge success.” Oh, and not to mention all the money they saved themselves by giving $120 paying customers Nylon instead of canvas haha
---
I would pay so much real life money to have skins for classic fallout weapons. Give me a plasma rifle that looks like an actual sci-fi pulp energy gun! Give me back my badass looking laser rifle and pistol!
---
I mean seriously for the laser guns though, they look ugly as sin and have since Fallout 3.
---
Xbox
---
That sounds like it might be my best bet
---
50 caps LOL
---
Not sure if you still need help, but you have to find a random spawn of a tourist’s body, loot them and read their holotype and note, and take the broken camera. (I recommend searching for ‘tourist’ on the sub, and there’s all sorts of lists) Be prepared for server hopping though. Then you just repair it at a tinkerers workbench.
---
It's the water park at the far north of the map.
---
Thanks!
---
I never even thought of that. Thank you!
---
You need two XB1 to do it alone. Otherwise you have to trust someone to hold them for you and wait for you to come back w your lower level character.
---
There’s a vendor in white springs hidden upstairs that sells it :D
---
C'mon man no need to be toxic
---
Yep.
---
Have spent 2 hrs server hopping.  Still nothing.  Pain in the ass.  Should be a more common random event than this for what it is, daily this and thats for atoms and all.
---
I've been on a break for a few weeks but when I left TSE amounted to a mid level weapon. Sure it will work but no one used them seriously beyond level 75. Did something change? Also I'm going to preempt anyone that is going to try the "actually I'm level 336 and I have a TSE that does infinity plus two damage and I one shot everything". I am not getting into a debate about play just asking a simple question.
---
Not toxic the vendor will literally pay you more
---
Boi, the money made from these shit heap games never goes to the devs pocket’s, but to the shareholders and CEO! Read up on the gaming industry, you’ll realize these cash grab games are bullshit that overworked, underpaid developers are bullied into making by scummy, rich boys who probably haven’t played a video game in their life. Plus, Bethesda already should have made their money back because the game was “a huge success.” Oh, and not to mention all the money they saved themselves by giving $120 paying customers Nylon instead of canvas haha
---
You can make 50 caps easier and faster than just the time it would take to load in and locate this guy.
---
Only mod it has is extra claw
---
I know he doesn't want legendary's but if people don't want them he'll take em.
---
Yes. Because I can differentiate between pay to win and pay for convenience, I'm a boot licker.
---
Go ahead and explain to me how a fucking stash increase provides a competitive advantage. Go right fucking ahead.
---
And note, a competitive advantage isn't some 1 out of 987474 instance scenario. It provides a tangible , regularly occurring advantage
---
People were asking for repair kits that they had to pay Atoms for? Can you produce a single instance of a post that supports that claim?  
---
Exactly which claim that I am making is alarmist? The one where I say that this is now possible, under a set of circumstances where it was not before, or the one where I claim that a melee build can buy repair kits and never again ever have a need for junk items?  
---
I mean I know you want this to be alarmist on my part, but it isn't. These repair kits are absolutely going to have an effect on the junk economy and everything that I have stated as a possibility is totally 100% possible now, even if most people are not going to participate in the practice.   
---
I get your mentality, you are saying that this is low risk, whereas I am saying it is not possible, and the possibility itself is wrong. We are in totally different worlds here. The biggest dividing factor that if my viewpoint won out here, there would be no room for abuse whatsoever.
---
Here's a question that's not about non-cosmetics in the atom shop. I understand that this is basically a skin because it costs the same to craft, so I am not upset about it at all. What I wonder is will it ever have the ability to gain legendary effects? This is especially important because if not then it means that this has no use at all except as a party favor
---
It's not about the money. Its about finally finding a fair fist to cuffs in the wasteland. Been running around the survival servers bloodied boxing glove and haven't found a single worthy opponent
---
The north face is definitely easier. Marsupial is a must have to reach the other side, but I got stuck trying to climb up.
---
I honestly was until I saw what their definition of dungeon was
---
Good idea 😂
---
Cywren Caster? Is that you?
---
Well... I had a huge message typed and Reddit decided to clear my text box (all I did was press the keyboard down arrow a few times)...
---
Cliff notes:
---
Game ***STILL*** freezes/unfreezes in SBQ and Imposter fights.  
---
Seems to only happen after long game sessions where things seem fine if doing it right after logging in.  
---
Hypothesis: The game's "Garbage Collection" routine is not functioning correctly and the game fights for freeing up allocated memory. 
---
The game runs nearly perfect otherwise (frame rates drop from nearly steady 65FPS down to 40s in Harper's and Camden), and never used to do this sort of thing until around the January patch. Initially manifested anytime I'd go near Charleston, which has been fixed finally since about Patch 7, now it's just SBQ or Impostor battles :\\
---
Usually I have to blindly navigate Task Manager to end task, but today after almost 20mins straight of it being froze ( (while typing this on laptop), it recovered! Interestingly, while frozen initially I could hear someone chatting over mic, despite thatoption being DISABLED...
---
Lol true, but youd be suprised. The true sweats may have grinded through it and may just post about it
---
I'm in my low 140s and have a TSE handmade (purchased, though since it has no third diamond I don't think it was one of the mass duped ones). With all the commando perks and demo expert maxed... it's ok? It jumps around like a ferret on crack and is a pain in the ass to use generally.
---
Now my furious plasma rifle (flamer) is a whole nother story... that thing melts anything but SBQ honestly. No recoil, insane damage ramp up and the ammo weighs nothing.
---
Apparently salt fixes the camera glitch
---
I saw a post saying you could buy the broken camera from the ammo vending machines.
---
Haven't tested to see if it's true though.
---
Eh, not really honestly. That’s a legitimate frame of reference in my book.
---
What they said is correct. You can put it on anything but it makes it look like x01 PA.
---
Needs to be in the forrest.
---
Dont worry you have 4 million days to complete the weekly challenges
---
Its definetly "higher tier" theres better, not much though. I like my instagating lvl35 lever action for most mid-high tier enemies. It can 1 shot, while my tse handmade takes 2-3
---
Been asking the same question for months. It’s the rarest encounter in fallout 76. I’ve been playing for 300 hours and haven’t seen one
---
Is it a bolt action 308? If so you just hit pay dirt. On ps4? I will trade a 10mm level 50 smg. That's a rare as hell gun.
---
If you don't want to PVP this is the only option. If you claim a workshop you are giving up all sense of safety. In addition, if anyone in your group has claimed a workshop you are in the same boat. Don't do workshops if you don't want to PVP
---
It’s very common
---
They don't. It is actually kind of un-intuitive the way they are
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Oh ok. Thanks!
---
Having never played warframe I'm curious if it's as easy to earn/ even possible to earn in game currency to buy items
---
Don't something like Fortnite do this, like skins that are really rare never come back to the store front?
---
And yeah what’s up with the timer lmao
---
I used to shoot all three limbs off and then run away before it exploded. Each time you shoot a limb off, the animation buys you a second or two, so it works out pretty well.
---
Once your build's finished it's quicker to just kill the things.
---
One of the reasons I stopped playing this game. They keep removing anything worth doing.
---
It does. You just have to get really REALLY close. It took me 3-4 tries at the cargobot caravan before I finally got one to fly right above my head (we're talking haircut close) before I got a pic of the vertibot to count. I've heard of folks taking over a workshop with a vertibot helipad (i.e. Grafton Steel, Poseidon)  and using that to get close enough to count. There's also an event at the Morgantown airport that'll finish with a cargobot delivery after 3-4 waves of low level scorched and that should allow you to get close enough for it to count.
---
None. I don't think there is a negative to mitigate. I had carnivore before I got class freak. Nothing is different as far as I can tell.
---
Did you found this keys?
---
Had that happen with a missile turret two days ago and a tinkers bench yesterday. Also yesterday by friend logged in and his quad explosive double barrel has vanished from his inventory. That was his main weapon.
---
Find someone with high karma that is known on reddit. I do it for people sometimes but mostly friends. There is a guy on here that does it for karma. He has a mic and will join your party talk you thru the process. Hes got like 300+karma. I'll message him for you if your interested.
---

This post says you can find it at ammo vending machines. Idk if true or if it gives the quest.
---
Still not as rare as flatwoods monster
---
*griefs* 
---
Huh…nothing’s happen- GASP😱 IS THIS HEAVEN?!
---
What magazine would you recommend?
---
It won't work on Grognaks, if thats what your after? Bug with that, only ever hits 100%. Annoying.
---
No.
---
Subscriptions take the power from the player. With MTX I get to choose when and what content I support in the game.
---
The green glow is a radiation storm. It’s become a source of frustration because there are challenges tied to it that are almost impossible to complete since it’s so rare to encounter one
---
I’ve had that happen and it is really disheartening.
---
This is him and one of his post. Fyi
---
More appropriately, they're making these items for people who buy currency.  If you're able to buy everything you want with earned atoms, then you're in luck.
---
Happened to me several times and the worst part is that it counts against your budget. Even though it’s not there the game counts it against you.
---
You have no idea unless you experience it yourself, and I hope they fix this before you or anyone does experience it. I am hurt now. I'm probably the heaviest hitter at the Event doing 829 with a Gatling gun, yet I get nothing.
---
I just did a sbq too and i got no loot for killing her
---
Have you picked up anything in that locker in the last few days? It seems to take a lot longer than the 24 hours people have suggested it takes for a location that you've previously picked up plans from to respawn. For instance, the plans on the armor workbench in the prison *STILL* haven't started to spawn again for me, and I picked those up just an hour or so before I made my initial post, so that's been like what? A week? As for the locker at Grafton Steel, yes they absolutely still spawn there as I saw a few different armor mod plans spawn there when I was server hopping early, just never saw the BoS Arms plans that I still need. I've seen the legs and chest spawn there though.
---
Serendipity's fair enough. You dodge some hits, but the ones that get through still hurt. PA bloodied with Emergency Protocols feels almost invulnerable though. I imagine Sentinel setups are similar.
---
It has happened to me lol. Once or twice actually.
---
How about just add an R91 instead.  They're very different guns, I wouldn't like it to be reskinned.
---
I'd rather they not make a gaas in the first place I'd rather they lose money on this game repair kits are bullshit
---
If you are looking for Brothers and Sisters of Steel, we have a place for you. 
---
On PC.
---
I didn't even get a chance to sprint towards the body. This sucks big time.
---
Did you have the protective learned before these dropped, if you recall.
---
Okay thank you
---
Or at least face tattoos that don't look so stupid.
---
No, it was delayed until May
---
I always thought the harpoon gun, with specially crafted ammo would be a fun way of handling this issue.
---
Clever devil. I hadn’t even noticed or made that connection, lol.
---
Bethesda needs test servers asap with expert glitchers with OP status to test everything. Internal testing isn't working.
---
No i don't. shielded marine  just Popup
---
I'm okay with it.  Would be more okay with it if the legendary spawn rate was higher inside the buildings ..... but it also seems a bit nerfed to me.
---
Yes they do. It’s been suggested that some kind of public test server would really help the game in the long run by having the hardcore players iron out all the bugs before the official release of said update.
---
How long before they nerf durability to drive you to buy them? you should very much give AF
---
What kind of bloodied weapons do you have?
---
Which plans are you looking for?
---
Can’t use eggs but you could use rugs xD
---
Have you tried the Hunter's Long Coat or other cosmetics of that manner? I think it looks pretty badass. Still, a pain to get.
---
2 star Black powder rifle and a 1 star pipe bolt action
---
Wow you just blew the community off and did it anyway. Man I feel sorry for the rage2 and wolfenstein devs when thier sales tank by association to this garbage fire...
---
We just need a quest that rewards a harpoon gun with a legendary effect like "Deals 200% additional limb damage" or something like that.
---
It's a pretty smart sales tactic. I don't blame them for using it. 
---
I've held out for shop items to go on sale. I'm sure plenty of others have as well.
---
I found my first last week, it’s a rail rifle.
---
Upvoted for reference to one of the best films ever...
---
Gee, just saw your reply. I got the acceptance but I couldn’t find you. I think you’re on Survivor mode? Joining you now.
---
I’d love that just as much to be honest!
---
I went there and didn't get the mission I did see ch monthly October I already had that one. Didn't get the mothman thing. Unless there is another thing I didn't see
---
"Pay to win." I dont think that means what you think it means.
---
Same over here, hopefully they add an event with it
---
I simply don't believe this. No one has posted proof. Everyone i know has had zero issues.
---
Have to find the dead tourist Ansel, he has the holotape and camera that starts the quest.
---
We know exactly where it goes they control the balance this is a casino and they are the house. It'll just be loot fodder for bullet sponges balanced so that you never get out more resources than you put in so you have to buy kits in the atom shop to repair in the middle of an event, and all the while the whales will excuse it because you can earn some in game...
---
I've heard it does not so you are either dead from fall damage or wearing actobats armor.
---
I'm sure the vaults will open before I get to see one of those guys.
---
Lol k.
---
This, 100%.
---
Have to find the tourist corpse...but that's easier said than done. He spawns at all the different tourist locations across the map...randomly. I keep checking Reddit as ppl have been posting when they've found him and invited others to join....
---
Yep that’s what it is I carry 2 grognaks and they only ever repair to 100% even with the weapons artisan perks installed
---
Would've worked even better if the spawn was guaranteed at some point so you are sure to get it.  Some of the random spawns of FO4 I still haven't seen and I played the crap out of that game.  Trying to play the crap out of this game, but they keep adding more crap.
---
I'm pretty sure I have a plan for an X-01 mod but I don't think there's a way to view known plans. I'm also fairly sure I got it from an SB queen, but not completely sure.
---
I could make a whole new suit and see, but that's a lot of mats to waste just to find out. If anyone knows a better way to see what plans are known let me know.
---
Brev sounds like an hassle, anyone know of these locations?
---
What’s the second perk on the black powder rifle? I’ll definitely add you in a few and stop by! :)
---
Lol I'll take that as a compliment
---
Pretty sure the reason is that flashlight color is tied to pipboy color, and there is no player specific pipboy color because it'd be a very unnecessary load on the server. Hud color likely isn't an option because pipboy color isn't.

The other place i found a few of my Marine plans was in the open railcar just a bit west of the Watoga station. They sit on top of (Or clip through) the top box next to the body.
---
No

🍿
---
any handmades?
---
Love this.
---
I figured it was my fault the first time. It was labeled "aa" after all, the second time no way, but cant prove it. This is the third time. I dont use it a lot, because it feels like cheating. But it was gone and this was a mutants so no way it got dropped. 
---
I dont buy guns, I got 1 to replace the first, but I earn all my stuff. This sucks.
---
It’s pretty sad and disappoint that you’re right
---
You can place a keg? I assumed it wasn't in game yet..
---
I have a level 45 2 shot handmade
---
Mirror ballllll
---
No idea, I never seen anything good either
---
For what it’s worth it was really easy to do. Nukashine lasts two minutes before transporting. So get your stopwatch our and emote at exactly 120 seconds after drinking and land at your random destination emoting whatever emote you chose with no fall damage.
---
I've been saving all my maps for a day that I'm bored and have nothing to do. Got over 200 of them altogether so...yeah lol
---
Oh this is sick, should build it like the Combat Zone from Fallout 4 where you meet Cait!
---
Noice! Art of something you enjoy (hobbies, TV / Movies, etc.) just seems to have that extra “personality” and stands out from the “uh, here’s a tree and stuff” picture.
---
Keep enjoying the game AND your art!
---
Great point that I hadn't even considered. Thanks for sharing
---
Wait till you try to earn some atoms doing the challenges with it. 
---
I must have had good luck because I found an Ansel within a reasonable time.
---
I got the plans during the BETA I think
---
And are you going to cry about knowing it exists now or something?
---
Check “hot” it’s up
---
The BoS Combat Armor Arms. I have the legs and chest.
---
Battlebot event reward maybe?
---
Wiki seems to think that’s a solid place to spawn.
---
this wouldn't happen because the point of the atomic shop is to make money so the game updates are free the servers are payed for and people are paid. The repair kits are obviously a decision made to drain players atoms with small 50 atom purchases so when the 1 day exclusive items come out they buy atoms. I love this game and don't mean to come off as rude but Bethesda is a company and they need to make money to keep people employed so they can keep making games.
---
Let me check my guy I'm loading in right now
---
it did?
---
The plans
---
It's impossible to prove, you'd have to be streaming 24x7, with captures of equipment before and after, and even then people would claim it was "fake" because atleast for me I usually notice the missing gear when I log in next.  
---
  
---
Before we go down the "You dropped it" route, all of my gear starts with a "_xxx"(X=Name) which puts it at the very very bottom of my list, so it's next to impossible to accidentally scrap or drops.  
---
   
---
I've personally lost 3 or 4 PA pieces, 1 Legendary armor piece and half a dozen weapons.
---
I hopped into a few and nothing happened, just looked cool.
---
There's a perk to make the negative mutation effects negligible. The only downside is you need a minimum of 8 luck for a decent mutie character. 3 for bloody mess, always. 3 for class freak, reduces negative effects by 75%. 2 for Starched genes.
---
There are some really great mutations for melee. Talons, adrenal reaction, marsupial and speed demon come to mind.
---
Personally I'm all about eagle eyes so I can stack it with other perception boosting stuff (get a total of 20+ per) and 1-shot VATS headshot most things that aren't SB's at the SBQ fight.
---
Link?
---
Platform?
---
Pc
---
Yeah...
---
Maybe for new characters it might work since they explore more then seasoned characters? So they might randomly stumble across it...
---
*Starlet Sniper would like to know your location*.
---
Now and then something special but rare, mostly common stuff now days. Found the star spiked clock on him which I had never seen anywhere in all my playing and haven't seen it since. Just have to keep looking. Also has stone benches which used to sell at WhiteSpring and only he sells them supposedly and has become rare.
---
I'll tell you what, I'll be farming that spot for a while. If I come across those arms I'll grab them and let you know. Keep me posted if you happen to see those legs or know of another spawn location
---
Use a middle man or intermediary
---
Good to know. I'll look there in a bit.
---
Well that's one of the "Unicorn" drops and only became available since patch 8, so congrats!
---
Dude. I’ve gotten 5 full mascot outfits, 3 imposter bodies &amp; 5 fucking fedoras.. last night I do it for the 14th time &amp; I got the damn helmet..
---
Level 367 and yet to find one (can't bring myself to check my hours played, might break me ;)! )
---
+karma , thanks for the 3 3*s
---
Ditto, seen many reports on PC, not sure about Console
---
i agree, but i still feel like this would work in their favor, especially if they made some items exclusively purchase-only, and it would give them the ability to change the value of atoms gained in-game as opposed to those bought. It would potentially make them more money.
---
Given all your hard work data mining and whatnot, hopefully the overwhelming appreciation of many of us might temper that a little bit :)
---
I just ran into this!!!   crafted 63 film,  got credit for 36.   come on bethesda...
---
if you want us to craft film 4x, say that ffs.
---
It is a random event. I actually hung out around the vault hoping it would pop up. Since it has appeared in a couple of daily quests, I think they may have tweaked the frequency. It seems like I see it every time I login.
---
Lol maybe. Is it in an Out House?
---
It's a pain, best to wait for someone in this sub to find him and you join their session. Best places I have seen is at the lighthouse and bolton green for easy spawns, but you going to have to server hop

This is just a fun idea. I'm hoping I'm around to watch the bru-ha-ha.
---
These days all the Useful stuff you CAN buy with Platinum is way too high of master rank to be P2W.  
---
The only exception to this is Prime Access.
---
You can manually-click and get it to fire faster, but it's a pain in the ass to get the timing of your clicks right. If you do then it's capable of firing at *least* twice as fast vs holding the down fire (mouse for me). 
---
I'd love to know where Bethesda came up with that "400" Fire Rate on the Gatling Gun lmao  
---
Realistically, it should fire about two to three times faster than it does... Then again, the Lever Action should, by default, carry 6 to 7 rounds, and be upgradable to 8. So that's Bethesda for you! :P
---
No worries dude! I’m adding you now!
---
I found him today at the Giant tea pot slumped over the picnic table.  I’ve also heard he can be found in Uncanny caverns....
---
There’s a grafton monster that spawns every load in by Charleston. Drops around 6-8 acid each server hop.
---
What started out as a fairly innocent Atom Shop has descended into garbage. Lack of quality updates, limited time gimmicks, and now the introduction of utility items when cosmetics were promised.
---
So much for Pete Hines' insistence that Bethesda can see the line and won't cross it. The only line they're seeing is the one they want us to file into to throw more money at their mediocre service. :-p
---
I still support the game, but I'm not spending another cent on their cash shop, I won't be pre-ordering any more Bethesda games, and I'm going to be thinking twice before I defend them on other forums.
---
It's there in build mode, but just like the majority of the animal mounts, the plans do not drop for it yet.
---
1 Hour ago wtf..!! What a luck!! today is my day!! the queen will give me a perfect lvl50 TSA!! THX BRO
---
I've had that bug also, it's quite annoying at times.
---
Hachikat
---
And again, i don't believe you.
---
🤞🏻
---
Lucky Hole Mine very typically has ants in and outside the mine. You may only need to server hop once or twice if you don't get them the first time.
---
And how much would you want?
---
Yeah its a pain. I've got a pretty sweet 3* myself and I've actually cut back using it. Can get almost as much damage from my bloodied brass knuckles, and the modded sledge does almost twice as much in the correct instances, and neither suffer from the bug. 
---
Love the thing, hopefully they address the issue some day.
---
I would like just a one-time season pass payment if it meant I got all the content they were releasing. No having to grind every day to get every possible daily/weekly to not miss out on a 5 day limited skin, no pressure to run calculations and projections for atom earnings...I am perfectly fine paying for good content. If it drives them away from scummy sales tactics, all the better. Just let us either buy a season pass or choose which content to buy, and make all the skins as well as silly dresses, princess beds, and whatever else unlockable in game. There are plenty of events with underwhelming rewards, they could definitely be buffed up with skins
---
So I hopped on because I couldn't find the screenshot and I headed down to the spot. Theres a very good explanation as to why you couldnt find it. The symbol I had seen is no longer there. I'm not Crazy- there was a weird symbol in the water I swear :p - I've gotta look harder for that screenshot. I don't understand why it was there before
---
Lol yes a bit...  
---
Though it smarts when someone loots their 3rd explosive weapon in 2 days and I'm on #5 for all my hours played! ;)
---
Well less pain, more like envy!
---
Boss!!!
---
Make an offer
---
nope its gone
---
The dev's haven't been "gun people" since Fo4. The combat rifle being .45 is... well it makes sense if its supposed to be an M1 knockoff... I guess. But it looks more like a BAR or something.
---
I think the lever should keep its high damage and decent fire rate at close to mid range, but just have lower damage at range. Then buff the shit out of the hunting rifle for range and damage. Take away the .50 receiver and give us a dedicated .50 cal sniper rifle with a new model and slower fire rate. I'd call that a good balance. Make you pick the right rifle for the right situation, instead of the lever gun just beating everything.
---
Its worth noting that the lever gun was originally a 45-70 bullet in Fo4, which is substantially bigger than a .45 ACP. Mainly longer and more powder. So it made sense then that it was pretty nasty at mid range, but sadly not as much now.
---
Yep .... Keyboard, Terminal, Roof ..... In .... no marsupial required.
---
Looking at the ESM, your best bet would be Ash Heap events. Lode Baring, Breach and Clear, Battle Bot and Earth Mover can all drop it. Chances are likely to be extremely low though. 
---
The other grenades and mines are in the explosive crate list, so they show up much more frequently.
---
2,000 be enough? I got some trades too.

There you go:

I think he was a bigger deal before they put plans in without the restrictions. I always checked his wares when I heard him but wasn't enamored much myself. 
---
Think he shared a cap pool with Watoga, now hes got to be part of the 1400 shared cap pool, would explain why hes out when you see him.
---
I know, right! I am constantly over loaded with food, I can't even give it away. And that's just from cooking, I don't pick up found food any more.
---
If you could get a picture that’d be appreciated, I forgot to take a picture of my little “sink” while I was on but I’ll try to remember tomorrow.
---
Exactly, warframe has WAY too many barriers in place to ever become p2w. You pay for convenience and fashion. You can buy a reactor or forma if you're too lazy to grind one out, you can buy some platinum to trade for a specific prime part if you don't want to farm the relics, you can rush a foundry item if you want to try out the new stuff faster, you can buy paints and cosmetic pieces for your warframe. You can't pay to bypass mastery requirements, and mastery tests are limited to one attempt a day. Mod cards, credits, and endo are necessary for late game and you can't buy those in any reasonable way. You can't pay your way through the game.
---
Not sure I’ve even seen an alien then if the flatwoods monster doesn’t count.
---
Everything but cosmetics can be grinded for in game. They recently introduced Nightwave so all the really rare stuff is easier to get. Platinum, the ingame currency, is basically made by grinding up Prime weapons and warframes and selling them to other players. I've only played about 1200 hours and I'm sitting on an easy 1500 plat that I earned.
---
Since beta people have requested them (many literally referencing ones in ESO when doing so).  Honestly, I don't care enough about your opinion to search for quotes and links from threads months ago to prove anything to you.  I don't particularly care if you believe me or not, nor does that have any impact on how blatanly false your claims about the impact of repair kits are.  
---
You didn't start by saying there might be an impact on the game's economy, you began by saying it removed all impact of death and need for junk.  It doesn't, and that is an objective fact.  There is still a need and use for junk, despite your constant efforts to claim otherwise (literally every character will need at least some until the get perfect roll gear at minimum, even in your most extreme assumptions).  Claiming the contrary is alarmist.  There is no basis to claim what you initially did, nor is saying it will have an impact on the economy the same thing as those initial claims.  
---
No, you clearly don't get my mentality.  You are grossly exaggerating the impact by misrespresenting things.  If you said you were concerned about the impact on the economy because it would damage the value of junk for use in repairs and possibly in PVP (which is how you are trying to characterize your view now), then I wouldn't have commented.  I agree they will likely have some form of impact, however I am not in a position to speculate on how significant that impact might be.  I only take issue with people making blatantly incorrect assertions like the one you made in the first comment I replied to.  Neither of us wanted or support the change, I just find grossly exaggerated claims about what repair kits actually do to the game as objectionable as I do the idea of buying any.
---
Yeah, they can win cryptid photo challenges with remote triggers and earn themselves more atoms. Very unfair!
---
You open still?

Fixer is fun but I am in love with my vampires auto handmade. I can run at 20% health either adrenal and nerd rage  and never loose a drop of hp in combat.

The problem with this game is all these Atom shop specials is it makes the store feel empty.
---
What’s a intermediary
---
Are you on PC? I have him now
---
Happened to me and other people during SBQ twice. Lots if question marks emote at that time.
---
The problem is the slow server. Beths need to bring in better cloud servers because the current ones are unacceptable.
---
PS Fior
---
One thing is the sometimes very lengthy (up to 40 secs or more) delays before item appears in the corpse inventory. Alternatively, I have seen on rare occasions where a nearby non legendary will have it pop into their inventory. Seen it about 5 times, always Super Mutants for me, but YMMV...
---
Never to that extent but a night or two ago my generator blew up when I logged in.
---
Inside or in the shed out back?
---
Why does this come up after literally every patch?
---
Video of it happening? Or is this like that "players can steal items during trade" FAKE glitch that people refused to let die?
---
I'm not saying you aren't getting glitches, but I run speed demon and no hunger/thirst perks, and it seems about normal to me.
---
LMAO for reals tho

---
I'm on ps4. I Mained that shotgun aa explosive and faster crit fill. Then it I stopped as soon as it was not killing at range. Are u getting kills at medium to long range?
---
Do or don't, makes little difference either way, but it never hurts to check one's posting history / comments before rushing to judgement.
---
I mean, I quite like the modern laser rifle design, but yeah I know what you mean
---
It has to do with how people have limited personal time. Why did they make the quest do hard to get? I personally have spent ALL day today looking and not found it. This wouldn't matter if it wasn't the only new content to look for plus if it didn't need the camera to get your daily atoms. Very inexperienced devs when dealing with online multiplayer games.
---
I missed the flatwoods monster because if that, ffs
---
More of it cant be a skin. I dont think... How do the attachments work with the hammer and the candy cane?
---
omg yes it dose !!
---
Terrific weapon.  You can buff the fire rate even more with a speedy receiver.  Add the drum mag, the comfort grip and the rifled barrel too; skip the sights as they're busted anyway.  You can practically snipe with this weapon with a long barrel if you can visualize the dot formed by the vanishing point of the shrinking reticle as you aim down the sights.  It takes only a little getting used to.  Plink scorched and mutants at New Gad for an hour from a distance and you'll have it down.

They have brought some items back in limited salesa few times already, and I expect they will continue to do so in the future.  Since this is supposed to be the way they sustain the game I don't really mind it.  I prefer this to paying a subscription or having more things that are essentially required to play the game in the shop.  There honestly isn't a way for them to do this that will make everyone happy, and so far I'm fine with the current balance (though wary of more items like the repair kits being added).
---
no idea, but [this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_foil_hat) is the hat I am referring to
---
I'm not sure how much hp the SBQ really has (ESM claims 32768, might not be the same server-side), but a 190 damage shot with no armor penetration will do \~15 damage if the 70% damage reduction and 300 DR are correct. 30 shots would be close to 1%, depending on how many pellets missed.
---
How controllable is it? Possible to do in power armor? You could have a huuuuge advantage in PVP evading people. Not that I wanna do it...
---
We can only pray for a perfect TSA
---
+karma Thanks, my dude! :)
---
Hahahah
---
Yup, but lets add repair kits so people get distracted by that while we reduce/don't fix the free challenges so there is less free atoms, making an incentive for people to spend $ to get those sweet new power armor skins that are 1400.
---
Although this is probably the best option, there are items I have that are worth more than caps. If I got stiffed for my item but got let’s say 10k caps I’d still be heated and feel ripped off.
---
Inside from the front entrance and down the right side hallway towards the cells.
---
Yeah I’m not too sure why 210 years after the bombs fell there’s still a huge radioactive zone around the impact crater. It would make more sense for rad storms to be common in 76, as I’m sure neighboring DC hasn’t experienced full radioactive decay yet.
---
They know they’ve burned anyone who isn’t a little money piggy already and aren’t willing to do what it would take to make right with the rest (operate at a loss, finish the game and relaunch) like No Man’s Sky - so they’re gust going to extract every dollar they can from the little sub piggies who get off on being exploited.

Banjo found it pretty quickly, then hid nearby to congratulate the line of folks server hopping to find it. “Congratulations friend! Your journey is just beginning!”
---
Damn, that sucks. Oh well, thanks for answering!
---
You could use something along the lines of "Deadly Merchandise" perhaps with a caption of, "The only people that will regret buying from here, are your enemies." if you can get the letters in of course or on a longer sign above it.
---
They need to make the current map a little more interesting before working on other maps.
---
Lmao.  Just did it for the first time and got it
---
My biggest beef with the modern laser designs is they are literally all based around the same silly blocky rectangle shape. Like even the gatling laser is just a bunch of individual laser rifles bolted into a cylinder shape. There isn't really a good reason not to make it a little smoother looking, fallout is supposed to be based on pulpy sci-fi concepts and it just really doesn't fit the retro-futuristic style at all.
---
Where was he located there?
---
So where’s you end up? I seem to always get the same few places.
---
For sure man! I read it somewhere and being I've used the excavator for a while, it just now made sense to me lol
---
The complacency of some of these comments is astonishing... ya'll are the reason the gaming industry is fucked.

---
Even if I can just change the color of the hud I’ll be happy
---
They probably do it so you can’t grind out the atoms you need for what you want, if nothing was limited time nothing would be exclusive at all and not a lot of people will buy atoms at all because you can earn them so easily.
---
Awesome!
---
That’s bullshit. How much harder would the server really had to work to change a light from green to blue?
---
Do we know if they added more of the "Unsolved" quests like last week, or any more mounted animal plans?
---
Ammosmith, to my understanding, gives you more ammo from the pre-existing ammo recipes as the alternative would be creating an entire new set of recipes to hotswap between. The challenge likely looks for the player crafting the ammo, which is done in the non-ammosmith amounts, and I doubt challenges also check for perks, like Ammosmith.
---
If they want people to use pistols I think they need to have a non Agility perk that gives least 75% anti Armor.

I didn't really notice the jerky movement. Jerky mouse pointer is usually related to incompatible refresh rate. Try calibrating the mice in windows or use the manufacturers software.

---
The map is nice, but I have fast traveled to every one, relogged multiple times, and still not found it after a FULL day of searching. None if this is on you, good on you for posting the map. But this is a huge failure on Bethesda. I spent a day looking for a camera. I wouldn't care if it wasn't tied to my daily rewards, which I have already been cheated out of the past week while it was unavailable and now I can't even get it after it IS. I don't know how to force this point home with Bethesda that players don't like things that have no reward at all but I hope someone does. If rather have to do 10 quests to go across the map to find specific parts for s sturdy camera than this rng BS

Thank you for informing me that this is an actual known bug. Now it makes sense. Since I carry 2 grognaks until now i just assumed the artisan perk was for guns

Well thanks for being an ass. Sure you found it a bunch. I have just said I have spent a FULL day and not found it. I wish I was as lucky as you. I'm simply trying to say this was a poor intro to the quest

I got ultracite gatling laser mods randomly, I think a beam splitter and charged barrels(?), but have never seen the actual weapon.

I wouldn't call over an hour of server hopping "easy". And I'm swearing because I'm irritated by shitty game design?

And no, you don't have a fucking week...you have a fucking week to find the camera AND take a bunch of rare as fuck pictures.

Same here,I was serverhopping the day before yesterday for half an hour to no avail. Yesterday I decided to try and combine server-hopping with visiting all (or almost all) the tourist locations. Lost an hour on that - no luck.
---
Went to youtube, clicked on the first video on topic. The guy there showed where the body can be at Bolton greens. (It's in the fountain in front of the building) I never checked this location and decided to make a final try befor scrapping the idea to find that stupid camera. And... Hallelujah! Got it from the first try,the tourist was there with camera and the quest finally started for me!
---
Couldn't believe my luck. But yeah, the way to introduce new content like that is fairly stupid...

This explanation really helped me https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I think the hardest part is unscrambling the jumbled letters
---
It doesn't work on my combat rifle either
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
It’s a party up in here. Going to get this thing for as many people as I can.
---
Anytime!
---
No problem man!
---
The mods are easy to find, vendors sell them regularly. Ironic the gun itself is harder to find than the mods.
---
The guns drop rate is so low it mine as well not be in the game.
---
I only ever seen one player ever use it in my 167 levels of playing.
---
Just for you, and so I can repost the link every single time I'm going to have to explain this again and again and again in the future.

---
Maybe even put it on that Pistol Perception perk to make it more useful.
---
Yeah they put too much useful stuff in agility and also in strength imo. I still hate the card system I'd much rather have a system like fo4 but have a level cap at 50
---
I think there is a way to ser it so your pip-boy is like the power-armor version constantly, if the tan is better
---
As above, don't attempt it with a container, it doesn't have to crash for you to lose everything, if no one is in the area the containers sometimes reset. I lost 5 weapons, all my mods &amp; some armor trying to transfer.
---
Very nice, lovin the freckled look. She's got the "What the hell am I doing out here and what's that smell?" look going on.

Plasma flamer is actually very strong and good for horde enemies even plain crafted ones. Expensive ammos though, which is managable as a sidearm.

---
Lol, it doesn’t. If they had good numbers they would release them to counter the atrocious rep this game has.
---
It’s juat in a death spiral and they will get all they can out of the money piggies, to extend the game as long as possible, so it’s less embarrassing when the game’s shutters 2 years in, no content in the second year. It happens in business all the time, raise prices and exploit new revenue streams as the consumer bade shrinks to cover costs. BSG knee how unpopular this was and how much more it would damage their rep and they still did it - because otherwise they’d have to operate at a loss which I’m sure the suits won’t allow after the utter disaster that was its launch and rapid price cuts, or close.
---
This sub is a ghost town compared to how it used to be, the vast majority of the dissatisfied already counted their losses and bailed. It was just those with some hope they would pull a No Man’s Sky and turn it around, or those with no standards who’ve stuck around. 
---
You can see it by how much louder the piggies are as a percent of the voices even just compared to a month ago when they announced they were going back in their word - that’s yet another wave, giving up.

My friend baanday is adding you 👍
---
Any Idea when and How Player Vending will come out and work?
---
I suggest downloading the logitech software and calibrate it. Also, if you use gforce, may want to download geforce experience for latest drivers.
---
I like this card system but it is grossly unbalanced like you said.
---
How about neither on a 60 dollar game that was launched in early access.

I've seen one. It actually spawned right by my camp. It took off before I could kill it to complete the challenge though.

but don't worry, you can enjoy a broken promise and buy a repair kit though
---
Lets put this in perspective. I only tried to help. Offering *my time for free*, and how I got it done, *which I don't have to do*; and all you guys have done is complain, and act like it's my fault, because I have a different experience/opinion.
---
I generally enjoy offering help here, but a couple of you are a bunch of entitled brats. Make it easy Bethesda. Make it so there's no point in me playing. I don't want a sense of accomplishment. Just give me everything cause my $60 waa waa. Honestly. 
---
Then the other idiot is wondering why idgaf anymore. Try showing some appreciation that someone actually took time out of their day to offer help to you, and maybe you'd get further.

Smh

What do mean mining in excavator?

Yeah... I still can't find the damn things, even with server hopping

When the raiders are too dumb to realize their wallets are getting raided lol
---
From theyr roadmap:
---
New Vault Raids: Vaults 96 and 94 Opening – For our most seasoned players, test your strength in all new high-level group Vault Raids.
---
Unless of course you'd like to assume that theyr announced "high level group vault raids" are half an hour short too and "testing your strength" poses no threat of wipes at all, which would obviously take a toll on everyones equipment, in which case they probably piss more people off then they do with the p2w content.
---
Sweet! Can I travel to you? Your PSN?
---
Same as my u/
---
It’s hilarious people are so deluded they’re calling you a troll, like shut doesn’t constantly malfunction with the game, lol.
---
Impressive.  Sorry you used up all of your luck for the rest of the year however.  If you’re ever gonna sell I’d be sorely tempted to throw 15k at that.
---
I mean they need everything and make the game less and less fun to play each patch so this should be expected. It like they don’t want us to have any decent loot or chances to get anything. Bethesda hasn’t made many positive changes for getting loot in a while save for a single area or two.
---
All the plans I have extra I always put in the white springs register where all the crafting stations are.  If not there the church in Flatwoods :/. If you make a run at the cabins behind the top of the world hotels there are normally a ton of different plans that drop.  Can’t remember top of head what the cabins are called.
---
Gold 👌🏻
---
Attempting to resurrect this because since the 4/23/19 patch, Discord crashes my game after about 5 minutes.  If I don't use Discord, the game runs fine.  Last time this happened, Bethesda support suggested that I \*not\* use Discord.  I was like, "uhm, no..."  I have more friends that I talk to in Discord than the actual game allows.  That, and the in game chat is buggy as all heck.
---
&gt;It all sucked like any trip to the DMV does (minus the ghouls) and I loved it.

Have you seen a DMV employee they have ghouls

Ya'll standards are strange....having 32 people on a map doing stuff is like 2006 teir...when games were 50 dollars &lt;.&lt;

In WoW you can respec now whenever you're somewhere you accumulate rested XP, so any inns or capital cities and some other places. There are also items you can get that let you respec once on the fly anywhere you are.

In case you were curious.

Example: Consumer-serf

You use a bank robbing analogy for a video game. Half of the population would have to be robbing banks for that to even make sense.

Funny you mention moral guidelines on a video game sub, you seem very young.

Yeah it's cool in theory but doesn't pan out in practice
---
Tyvm. This saved so much time. I appreciate greatly
---
I support this as long as I can get a refund on the whole game :(

The repair kit is not pay to win.  If they sold guns for atoms maybe.  
---
I am so tired of people complaining about repair kits.  Keeping your weapon repaired is not a big deal.  Anyone who buys this is a sucker.
---
The arms on the excavator power armor allow you to mine double the ore when all pieces are equipped
---
Someone did it for me, just returning the favor
---
Borderlands is awesome how about we let them keep thier ideas. The game would become Borderlands light if BGS started taking thier ideas.
---
FYI BGS is already releasing a game with stuff like that it's called Rage 2 and it happens to look pretty freaking good.
---
Still got it going on on here.
---
Thank you my friend! Sorry my mics not working for some reason.
---
I could do it for you
---
i can make you one for free.
---
It’s amazing how you guys just have no standards, at all. You just enable shitty production.
---
Hey pal go to Colonel Kelly Monument and server hop. Should be a body up by the monument lying on a bench.
---
If you have all materials I can do for 750 for the whole set.
---
I have no idea if mine works half the time or not. I unplug mine once after I log in and that seems to fix it.
---
Thanks for the rifle!
---
The game heavily relies on forcing you to pick QoL things like reduce weight or less spoil on top of having too many required staple cards already.  
---
I stopped with the mind set of having 60% damage for 9 perk points. 30% with only a 3 perk cost is 100x better.  
---
Also not one of those people using 2SE with Demo Expert.
---
Do we need to have no weapon out of is it just in all the time. Also is it a mod for the power armor or is it natural?
---
I feel bad for your parents.
---
Plans and he's the only NPC which isn't an annoying robot.
---
No. It's trash.
---
I'm on Xbox so you can give it to me :p
---
Natural
---
Why waste the plastic. just give your stuff to a noob if you dont want it.
---
Its a camp item
---
I have friends that consider beers a unit of time. They look at their drink and say "I got about 15 minutes."
---
Yep. I've done the Biv dailies religiously since the patch came. Multiple copies of just about every other booze recipe except Cranberry Moonshine. It's become REALLY discouraging. 
---
I'm only missing the Imposter 'Squatch costume at this point though, so I've got that going for me, which is nice
---
I would do it im level 148 but on ps4
---
I'm on PC, I think I have an extra Nuka Dark recipe (and loads of others), I need Cranberry Moonshine, Firecracker Whiskey (all of them), and White Russian.
---
You can sell some of them as bulk that you cannot sell as individual pieces. 
---
So I'm gonna keep bulking my glass and other garbage because I can get caps for it.
---
This was a lot of effort to get angry about.
---
I'm sure Biv has something for you to help you relax.
---
Oof, looks like I'm done bulking. Thanks for sharing!
---
If it’s a crashed vertibird it won’t give it you, I called in a supply drop and took a pic of that and it worked.
---
I'd buy a light skin, prefer if it were free but if it keeps good stuff like the fridge and stash space out of the shop then bring on the lights!
---
Had 3 mole men in a row go nuclear complete with power up sound.
---
I have the materials, I just need to get caps. I bought a ton of mods from the vendor today specifically to maximize my Excavator only to find out I won't ever be able to craft it because of Bethesda and their bugs.
---
No, it works. The extra weight is from the mods that were added to the gun. If it didn't have 90% reduced weight, it would weigh 20+ pounds. The 90% RW only deals with the base weight, then weight is added on when the gun is modded :)
---
Added ted1ted
---
Your awesome!
---
I just bought a sheepsquatch head at Watoga, seems someone sold it there. (PC)
---
I'm not that attached to it, and would be willing to trade for something
---
That's just the 200 mirelurk steaks I sold them.
---
If people want to spend they’re real world money on a repair kit they can be my guest I’m happy to sit back on my fat stacks of cash, caps, and atoms from not wasting money on unnecessary items. We have the ability to get most materials very easily (except ballistic fiber which might be the only reason I use the kits I EARN from events) so I have no problem exploring and farming because that’s how you find those fun random encounters that make the game great.
---
They’ll stick with micro transactions since the main model for everything is a continuous cash flow.  Everything is a service, software is a service instead of being owned in many cases.
---
I've learned a lot of the popular recipes too if you want me to mod like calibrated shocks while I'm at it.
---
I lost most of an X-01 set the other day. No guns yet thankfully.
---
 💪
---
I wouldn't use them as a pawn shop. They certainly reset on the daily.

No Happy Snappy Pro 🤨

didn't you post this earlier today?

I loaded into whitesprings this morning, first time looking for camera got it immediately &gt;\_&lt;
---
You rock
---
Yeah, that's what I bought that ended up making me realize I can't craft Excavator.:/
---
Mine renamed no problem on PC.
---
How much are you charging? I'm low on caps right now.
---
Yeah its not worth it honestly
---
Gracias for this! Spent way too much time trying to locate them myself today.

Lemme tell ya, it's a thing of beauty when that green laser starts cutting things to ribbons. It's not *quite* as fast as my prime minigun at chewing through scorchbeasts, but I think the UGL may be more ammo efficient in the long run. 
---
I just want that damn plan.
---
Well once you have the base you can obviously craft the mods. I can craft tomorrow afternoon if you'll be on.
---
I've never even seen the Lode Bearing event...

Breach and clear I've done a bunch because i like ore.

I guess the RNG gods are not pleased yet...

Here for a few more minutes, then I gotta join a friend for a launch.
---
Fix the resort mirror :(
---
Because A LOT of people aren't bulking it for sale, they're bulking it just to carry around because people keep telling them it saves on carry weight.  This post isn't aimed at you, so I don't know why you feel the need to make it personal.
---
It's either server hop until you find it or spend hundreds to thousands of caps fast traveling back and forth? I know what's easier and cheaper.
---
I've heard they can drop rarely from certain enemies such as the SBQ, but never had such fortune. You can buy them in the genetics lab in the Whitespring bunker, but they're expensive - around 20k, give or take depending on charisma. You can buy cheaper from other players; the market rates vary slightly by console.
---
It's a Dev room item, not officially added.
---
Yeah, but can I still get one from someone? You get the plans from scrapping and I see everyone with it...
---
I don’t even seem to get any plans.  What’s the frequency of them dropping?
---
Oh man, that has to be worse than never seeing it at all.  
---
I love that we can have these "no, it's real, I saw it once" stories, but gosh darn it.
---
They're not pay to win, they're pay for advantage. If they keep it up, those advantages may add up to be substantial. I don't care about repair kits, I'm worried about what happens when they keep adding these tools.
---
No charge,  Just supply the mats
---
I feel that, I'm just buying random plans to not reach the cap limit at this point. Still, it's better than any alternative without a proper system for item trading in place. Also, I'm hoping that the way the sheepsquatch event works means there will be actual cap sinks in future updates, so caps might have value again
---
Seriously, see Biv. He can help with those anger issues, at least temporarily.
---
It looks really cool from far away, I was in the middle of one before but yeah, it looks like when a nuke drops, not much to see.
---
Pretty pissed we can’t use the ProSnap Camera, or at least have it as a learnable crafting style
---
Wow! I appreciate that! I definitely have the materials to make it!
---
I crafted one for you if you still need it. my GT is the same as my name on here, i needed to lighten my stash as far as materials go so just come and grab it when you're ready. i'm online now.
---
Sometimes when building at my camp an object will randomly disappear but if I try to place another it will tell me it's intersecting if you server hop or restart the game your problem might solve itself
---
You're amazing! Thank you so much!
---
Furious? I’ve seen a Furious The Dragon before, is that any good?
---
u/melodicmutiny, u/nutsupreme \-- I am jealous. I'm on PS4, maybe it's a console specific issue. Just tried restarting my app, and still cannot name my camera at all.

Maybe one day he will be called Snapping Turtle.
---
No problem
---
Probably didn't get a reply and wanted to refresh the post so he could get some answers. At least he didn't make a whole bunch of alts to ask something stupid about the atom shop
---
Thats definitely epic but i did name it after i put the 105mm lense on not sure how much that might effect it
---
If you're on Xbox  I'll give you a mod
---
I am my gt is deadlybanana974

Wait my GT is CharG31912, i forgot the G lol
---
I'll be on tomorrow night if that's fine
---
I have ammo, how much for the shotty?
---
Yea just message me when you are on
---
If you want a good Lever Action try to look for a Double or Quad.   
---
At base it only has 5 shots so with double its 10 and 20 with quad. It reloads pretty fast for it being a single loader.
---
You should be able to go back to the computer and download the plans...
---
it wont even let you bring up the rename screen ?
---
I’m still on btw, getting off within 30

You were in a team, right?

That means your teammate can initiate combat and you become flagged too.

Nope. Only options after pressing Inspect are Prev, Next, Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Exit.

I got it done during Collision Course, but I had to wait until the cargobot started to fly off before the picture counted.

yes must be console specific then you need another Ps4 user to confirm

Nothing because 75% reduction of Zero is still Zero.

Though things like Dog Food can be used by both.

Pistols are definitely cheaper AP cost in VATS. I don't normally use it, only for the Biv drunk-luck get a critical on an enemy quests, but I grab my dusty 10mm for this purpose.

Absolutely no clue 🤷‍♂️
---
Release the vendor!!!! I need room in my stash box and don’t want to sell anything
---
I upvote this
---
Yeah, I try to interact as it suggests but they do nothing
---
I just want them to add the service rifles from FONV already. I was a big fan of the more realistic military weaponry, and with the customization they have in FO76 it would make it possible to potentially go full M4 with them too. Rail systems, fully-auto, maybe even options to add new sights.
---
I get what your trying to say, but...
---
Flatwoods is 6 caps from where exactly?
---
You need a Beginning and an End for it to make sense. 
---
Otherwise, it's just 6 caps to Flatwoods from anywhere.
---
It's a discussion on reddit my dude, I'm fully aware that they're gonna do whatever they want. I was just curious what people's preferences were.
---
I had this happen to me also, I believe when I removed the wire from the power source, and then attempted to attach it again, because the game looks for objects which it can attach to, I reattached it and it forced the object forward
---

---
I never post my build and I apologize for it. Mine isn’t a build that came off google. The less people who have my build, the better. It seems like Bethesda likes to target certain builds and nurf them without saying anything. However, you can google bloodied and melee builds and get a pretty good idea of what to invest in.
---
I’d suggest not copying the full build though. Each build should be tailored to your play style. It took a lot of time and mess ups to get my main to where his build is perfected for my play style. I only have one optional point and it’s only optional because the guy I Party with got tired of sharing lock picking lol.
---
If you’re serious about wanting to make a good bloodied build, try using an online character builder, so you know which levels unlock what and invest in those as soon as you can. You’ll still hit 50 and have to rearrange some cards but the stat points should be the same. 
---
If you want a good boost to start you off, invest in strength at the beginning and get three stars in fist weapons. That way you already have max damage on one type of weapon and only have to invest three points to get it vs. the usual 9 points.
---
Hopefully it helps you along your way without actually having to post my specific build and gear. I don’t claim to be godly nor do I want to sound cocky. I just don’t want people copying my build and put it on the radar with Bethesda.
---
I did but I had work so I was unable to reply to people. As the other commentor mentioned, I got a lot of stupid answers so I decided to repost it. 
---
Most just said "lol must've been a scorchbeast" but all my stuff is already repaired which I had forgot to mention. I reposted it with that part included.
---
“I’m downvoting because I don’t understand basic economics and I think developers should make a game the. Continually pay employees to run expensive ass servers 24/7 while pushing updates all for my measly $60 waaah”
---
Found mine finally, and it looks like I found another after. Between the wendigo cave and the picture of a dog to the north, slightly closer to the cave. There is a radio tower looking thing. With a bunch of raider cages at the top of the mountain
---
TLDR: yes, it is stupid
---
It's fascinating how the calculations are done. i did some testing with a bunch of perks, weightless legendary gear, and weight reduction armor. Each of them works differently lmfao
---
Weightless for armor/weapons, like you just found out, only affects the base weight. Any mods are additive. For the purposes of this, the sturdy/heavy armor upgrade counts as a mod even though you can't change it. It also means you can go to 0 (technically negatives) if you have weightless armor and then apply either lightweight or ultra-light to it. Great for hoarding 0 weight legendaries in your stash box until the legendary vendor comes in
---
Perks do what they say. Unlike weightless, they affect the total weight. Afaik all weight reduction perks range from 75% to 90% when fully maxed out. So a weightless weapon fully modded out with a 90% weight removal perk will weigh 1% of its base weight and 10% of the mod weight. Their main advantage over the armor is that you can use them in power armor.
---
Weight reduction armor is where it gets interesting. You have five armor slots, each of which can have a 20% reduction. This theoretically means that you could reach 100% weight reduction for a given item type. Sadly, it caps at 90%, so the last armor piece will only be half as effective as the rest. This also affects total weight, not base weight. It stacks with perks and counts towards the same cap - 50% lower junk weight from the rank 2 perk card and 20% from the armor will result in 70% less junk weight. Any combination of perk and armor still cap out at 90%. If you have the chem and food armor at 100(90)%, and are only using thru-hiker (-90% food weight), then the armor will not affect your food in any way and will only reduce chem weight. If you have both thru-hiker and traveling pharmacy (chems -90%) as well as the armor, you can remove either the armor or perks and your carry weight will not change. 
---
HOWEVER, there is one "exception" that I found. "Weapon weight" is not treated the same as "rifle weight" or "heavy weapon weight". It is its own modifier, affecting all weapons (except for I think grenades). That means you can have a weightless heavy weapon (like the daisycutter quest reward fat man) brought down to 2 pounds, up to 6 with the MIRV mod. That can be brought down to .6 with the bear arms (-90% heavy weapon weight) perk. THEN, you can use a full set of weapon weight reducing armor to further bring that down to .06. Without any perks, armor, or legendary effects, a fat man with a MIRV mod would weigh 24 pounds, but only .06 with all of these applied at once. That is a 99.75% decrease in weight.
---
Sadly, you can't stack such ridiculous weight reduction on the weapons that need it the most (rifles) because they don't have their own weight reduction perk. You would need a full set of 3* legendary armor with a specific tertiary effect just to get it down to 10%, or 10% mod weight and 1% base weight with a weightless 3* rifle. In comparison, heavy weapons are surprisingly easy to cut the weight on because they don't usually have many mods, and the bear arms perk already gives a 90% reduction. Either the weightless effect or bear arms perk are enough by themselves most of the time

Can someone tell me if the keg is a reward from Biv or something else. That's my goal right there been trying for a couple weeks now
---
I think mine is fine? What wall are you placing it on?
---
Give me back my Pancor Jackhammer. Me and that gun had a lot of fun back in the original game.
---
I hate to shatter your naive innocence, but that literally describes every industry kiddo :( it's kinda adorable that you think you uncovered some huge conspiracy though. Welcome to the real world, where businesses exist to make money for the people at the top.
---
You're right though the ring leader could probably fund the entire game themselves and give it away for free and still have more money than us. It's just really dumb to expect that.
---
Lol they're downvoting you, of all people. 
---
I've seen a lot of people post this. I dont know why people would lie. It's not like Bethesda is going to give them weapons back. 
---
From what I've seen on this sub alone it seems to be tied to item renaming. Can anyone confirm that the items they lost were indeed renamed?
---
Perhaps the game code is not storing the updated names item and when it tries to recall the gun to inventory when you log in it cant find it so it removes it.
---
If it was an automated gun that started to steam the more you shot it I think it'd be pretty sweet. But most aren't automatics, and it looks like a rifle with a weight problem.
---
what a about 2 out of 3 times the sheep dies and turns invisible and no one can find it..i feel like  boycotting the event till its fixed..also the lag makes it nearly impossible to even get near the sheep for melee attack
---
luckily i got it from some one who posted on looking for group who had one on them seriously those people are a blessing.
---
Definitely not pay to win in anyway
---
You can. You just need to get a buddy and join him, deposit the item in a world container, then join as your other toon. Then just grab the stuff from the container.
---
This is called "muling"
---
I need this...
---
Congratulations.

 I found a TSE laser weapon two or three months ago. Glad I kept it but the only problem with it is that TSE weapons seem to break faster than everything else especially before they updated the damage and durability of laser weapons.

This would stop or at least hinder people from just making characters to store items. And encourage playing on new characters and leveling them to get to this area.

---
I tried to reattach it but it doesn't go to reconnect to anything
---
This was my first thought. Net gun!!!
---
Not sure if this is bait or not...
---
This was before I even knew about the kill challenge. Just after I took the last picture and was going to try and attack it when it disappeared. I'm wondering if it's like the mothman and has different temperaments because it seemed very calm and didnt even try and attack. Also if you do the event queen of the hunt you are guaranteed to find one cryptid and apparently if you server hop without collecting the sample you can restart it but I haven't tried that and I dont remember how old the video was that I watched.
---
You ever download that service rifle mod? The one for FO4? I would love something like that implemented, it introduced one gun that could be changed up between the service rifle, marksman rifle, or assault carbine from FNV, or some gun in between, all through hundreds of mod choices. By far one of the best weapons mods out there, although i forgot its name.
---
💪🏻
---
Do you have Inn-Sewer-Ants!
---
This. Give it a small buff and let it use weightless armor. Would make it not something that's immediately trash.
---
Inside (white) of a brick  wall
---
well sometimes there are these events when a lure is used to force it onto the ground. Would be awesome to deploy that same effect maybe temporarily with a grenade or so that you can cruft (just like the pumpkin grenades and orbital strikes)
---
I agree completely.  The more weapons and armor etc the longer the game will last.  I dont think it would be that hard to add all the weapons from fallout 4.  Seems like just copy and paste but I'm not a developer.
---
I would need dare I say "friends" for that to work.
---
☺
---
P.S.
---
PSN: illahstrait 
---
if anyone needs a friend for transferring items. You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
---
Something like this is such a no brainier you have to assume there's a reason way there's not an option for it . My guess is it would only work half of the time because it was the whole server that crashed, or you would go into a queue to get back... And probably lose your loot either way. A case of more trouble than it's worth.
---
Often the servers themselves crash, so there's no server to go back to.
---
^ this
---
It needs a good touch up, some animations here and there and a change in sound to make it sound as heavy as it looks and you got yourself a true Lewis Gun
---
Or have a number 1 and 2 status bar that slowly build as you eat and drink. As #2 goes up your carry weight capacity goes down, eventually charisma drops as you become irritable and if you hold it too long you get dysentery. If you eat too much meat and don't have the carnivore mutation your #2s take longer too, you could have to watch your character sit there unsuccessfully for several minutes waiting for RNG to give you a successful BM roll. #1 goes up and your character starts to do the pee dance decreasing your ranged weapon accuracy. Hold it too long and you can do damage to your bladder or get a urinary tract infection. 
---
J/K that would be horrible
---
What if you also had to do kegels regularly for prostate health over lvl 200?
---
When I heard him talking about Chally making piles, I nearly choked with laughter!!!
---
The way I see it, you're still paying for the "free" content by taking a huge cut in quality. Right now, it is clear that Bethesda no longer cares about preserving the legacy of the franchise or placing people as top priority. They are running this game purely as a business, and that's understandable given that they are a business. But that means you have to understand how they operate. 
---
The only thing that brings in more money for them is the atom shop. That money is needed to keep the game alive and pay for producing more content. So they want to maximize their gains. The way they do that is through overpricing atom shop items, flash sale pressure, and reducing the amount of free atoms players can get. I don't think anybody would disagree that all three of these have to some extent been happening since launch. The content can be thrown together last minute (and based on our experience/datamining, often is) with no regards to quality testing, because it quite frankly does not affect them if the reception of new content is poor.
---
Meanwhile, imagine if they went back to paid DLC. Since there is an actual cost to it, some people would wait to see how it turns out before buying it. Others would buy immediately, and tell others about how good/bad it is and what technical issues exist. If it's broken or low effort, then less people will buy the DLC based on those results. Their income would directly be hurt by low quality product. They would have an incentive to produce better content for the game. Something that many people are asking for in countless threads here. Something that won't happen unless A) DLCs become paid, or B) Bethesda stops acting like a business
---
I’m actually surprised we don’t have more wall options. I like scrappy looking stuff so many of the metal and wood walls from 4 would be perfect. But yeah interior walls with different wallpapers would be excellent.
---
What, why?
---
That's a pretty detailed analysis.  Looks like I needed to get there sooner or bring a bigger gun.  Thanks everyone.
---
Yessssss!
---
I believe it was just called Service Rifle, I have it installed to my NMM, though I've yet to fully delve into it on my playthrough with it. That would be a perfect addition to the game.
---
Maybe I just got lucky. It was at the fourth spot I checked.
---
I just got lucky I suppose. Fourth spot I checked.
---
Sorry I couldn't help
---
If I could karma you on here, I would a million times over. People like you make this community what it is. Thank you so much.
---
These guys were in the prima game guide. Very odd indeed
---
the egg event ended a while ago. you had to go into the atom shop and claim your free egg once per day until all 6 are obtained
---
Lol I was trying to sell my recipe for over 2 weeks and no one ever took the offer so I just consumed it. Ironically it was the first recipe plan I got.
---
:( Dang. I missed out.
---
And what makes you think they wouldn't sell different color pip-boy lights and the fridge in the atomic shop? If they know you want something they'll use it to their advantage to squeeze a little extra money out of you.
---
&gt; Give me something to grind Atoms for in the time spent doing nothing in this game. 
---
"Jeez you're so bad at business Bethesda. This item is the best, keep it on the store so I have time to grind for Atoms instead of spending real money!"
---
So limited time items sell incredibly well and are a popular business strategy because it plays off peoples desire to have exclusive stuff and peoples inclination to impulse buy something when there's a time pressure involved. It also keeps old items seeming fresh when they cycle old limited time items back in the store, and increases the likelihood that someone will buy more than one skin of the same type.  
---
If you want to grind for Atoms instead of paying, go ahead, there will be more limited time items in the future and ones that have already come and gone will probably come back eventually (some have already come and gone and come and gone again I believe).
---
Maybe a prime receiver gets better armor penetration. ?
---
That's the drink, not the recipe though.
---
You had to go to the atom shop and select the free eggs from there. Did not happen by just logging in as far as I know. Have a good one.

I love that idea. A massive tunnel with checkpoints along the way but you can’t fast travel to them, so you have to plan ahead. Maybe make it like some of the older DLCs where for some story reason you enter with nothing but one weapon and some aid, and the only way to get it back is to leave from one end or the other. 
---
But then that said, the possibility of bugs that could wipe your entire inventory and no backup saves...
---
Still interested?

Well if you need the consumer challenge 🤷🏻‍♂️

---
Longer female hair is a necessity
---
Yes, I will.see you soon!

I hate time limited stuff, especially for digital items that they can't run out of -  they do it on purpose to create a sense of urgency to get you to spend atoms.

ahhh sorry, PC, added to post body now

You can change the gender of your character in thr character customization menu
---
What drove you away if you loved it at first?
---
Hunters long coat
---
You can change the look and gender anytime.
---
The assault rifle is based on the maxim/vickers gun. Not the Lewis.
---
Ya, keep it. The only way you get rid of this gun, is if your trading for a piece of max lvl sentinel/assassin armour or other legendary armour or another gun of similar value that pertains to your build.
---
I bulk it so I can more easily keep track of general amount of each I have. So for my own organization.
---
Which location is that one?
---
Yeah I've changed my characters gender about 4 times now
---
wtf im lvl 169 and dident know i could this
---
I dont know everything they have fixed but they have fixed a good amount definitely (while probably much more than just a good amount) they've added a couple new side quests (one of the new lines is all story driven while the other is some story but mainly to get 2 new crafting stations) and a new dungeon (maybe two, been to busy to play) I would recommend watching Juice Head on YouTube. He has a lot of good videos on 76 about patches and leaks and expansions etc.
---
Okay. Deep-Pocket mods. Carry weight perks. Reduce weight perks. The methods are there, you just want to complain.
---
Yeah its right in the pause menu its a small font but its there
---
hmm, I checked there first. guess I missed it, thanks
---
It's a skin, not a paint. There's a difference
---
I wanna say its so everyone can enjoy the skin and its part of the 4 horseman esthetic  but it will happen with every skin coming out for the next 4 weeks
---
I have 7 strength and 275 carry weight. When I have my food and chems set up. (This is without thr unyielding buff)
---
When I go out adventuring I have 105lb. You may wish to look more into weight reduction perk cards.
---
How is this a stealth NERF it's an exploit. Plus they already said (as one comment here showed) that they would increase the ammo amount of the fuel ammo.

I know a trader on XB1 with an extra Nuka Dark Recipe. I traded it to him for a 3\* Auto Stim Left Arm. If you're on that platform, PM me your tag, put you in touch.

I'm amazed you managed to type all that out with Todd's dick in your hands.
---
Cool, I'll give that channel a shot. Thanks!
---
You seem pleasnt to be around.
---
But the only advantage they might offer would be in PVP, and I’m still curious to see how well they would work there, since you have to open the pipboy and select the weapon to repair it. That leaves you open to attack for a precious few seconds, thus negating any potential advantage. And even if they are amazing in PVP, those servers are still in beta; BGS could shut that down in a heartbeat when the beta ends. 
---
And you’re worried about something that you have no good evidence is going to happen.
---
My favorite by far where the t-posing enemies that couldn't hit you bit they would just levitate and follow you until you killed them. I have my camp next to whitesprings and the group of souls next to my camp always has 1 or 2 pacifists but I artillery blast them so they die
---
if you're still looking for some help im around now, can see what we can do
---
No body there on PS4
---
If you're spending 90% of your in-game time managing your inventory,  you're playing the game wrong
---
The dead tightrope walker corpse is down at the bottom too.. lol
---
Yes.
---
It's hard to gauge without know exactly how far you were... But there's been content drops, new quests added and some stuff here and there. If you're buying it again(?) and leveling a new character would be appealing to you then I'd say yes, but if you already have a high level that you'll continue with it'll still be a lot of farming, and maybe 20 or so hours of new content
---
Giant Teapot, draped over one of the picnic benches out front.
---
They mean zetans, but currently they don't spawn ingame yet, currently known alien ranks whenever they do spawn include alien, Lieutenant, Captain, Star Admiral.
---
They know if players get loot they'll eventually stop playing the game because there is no content..... getting loot is the content.
---
It's called a skinner box.
---
I'll help clear the silo. Psn xPunkishx
---
Nah just add it as a new friggin gun. 
---
For one the animations between the R91 and Ass Rifle are totally different. (Bottom fed mag versus side mag). 
---
For two... more weapon diversity. A third 5.56 gun would be swell. .45 has way too many.
---
For three.... THE R91 IS ON ALL THE FRIGGIN COMMANDO CARDS!!!!
---
It feels like cut content at this point. Cut content makes me feel ripped off. There are so many signs that the big wigs cut off development halfway through on this game. Weapons that exist on animated cards and not in-game is one of them (see also: the totally useless automatic pistol cards).
---
Thats pretty weird, I got one of the combat achievments by killing him and he counted as an alien for that.

When you get kicked you can still join off your friends if they didn't.
---
However as my pal found out after he almost literally singlehandly carried  Sheepsquash with 15mininukes, 40 grenades etc the body doesn't even show up because the server doesn't remember who did damage I guess.
---
I should have realized the only people left using this subreddit were the ones too dumb or too stubborn to give up on a lost cause.  Bethesda's taken a great idea and ruined it.
---
Stealth grenading things is fun. I like seeing how high I can make corpses fly....so far I've cleared one of the taller buildings in Watoga with a super mutant.
---
I have 15 strength, Excavator Armor modded with Motion Assist and Calibrated Shocks, and the Marsupial and Herd Mentality. 
---
I range to a good 585 when alone and 615 with friends. If I feel the need I’ll put on the sun strength card which raises me to about 630-640 something.
---
Can I ask what each item you are carrying is and there individual weights. And also your total carry capacity .

You dont have to feel offended. You asked a simple question and we gave you a very viable solution.

So flatwoods monster and any dead aliens don’t count? I wonder if this was just an oversight or if aliens were meant to be in the game by this point. 
---
My guess is that the maker(s) of the challenge looked at the full list of crypids that will eventually be added and put that number in without realizing
---
ill be on in a sec
---
New content is nothing worth doing really and the waste land is even more boring with decreased creatures to farm and much smaller player base.....overall it was much better in first few mths even with all the problems....
---
I was playing on ps4  and recently got a pc. Im checking out that youtube channel that the other person recommended.
---
Just adding to OP's comment.
---
No spoilers, but play the quest all the way through that the dead tourist gives you. You unlock a more useful zoom lens at the end. The atom shop shows camera skins with more lenses and film, so hopefully its something thats continually updated (and for free).
---
I've ONLY had the mask drop... 3 times. I just want the Imposter outfit! And potentially not to waste my caps failing the event...
---
Sure looks like it's listed under paint when I'm painting the power armor parts.
---
There has to be something to play to win lmao 🤠
---
Ahh, I have both im pretty sure. But am xb1. 
---
Feels bad man
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the info.
---
It exist in the dev room that people cheated to get into it's not supposed to be in the game.
---
Do you use a tesla rifle?
---
My character has a glow effect centered around his right hand. Most notable sleeping/using an instrument. I've narrowed the cause to having a tesla equipped at the time.
---
Did you learn the plan by going to the notes section of your pip boy? When you craft the lens it’s a mod for the camera so you have to go to the modify menu.
---
I haven’t gotten any new quests since crafting the 105 mm lens
---
Your funny
---
They want you to buy their bullshit monopoly money.
---
Don't.
---
It's no problem! I'm not really having a hard time getting ones I don't have, it just went from averaging like 6-7 new recipes a week to like 1-3. So I'll survive, it's just annoying lol.
---
But it's one of the only things keeping me playing until the Ever Upwards quests on May 7th besides double XP this weekend so I'm cool with it.
---
I used the Jackhammer in Fallout 2 and the thing was a powerhouse, it’s really good for clearing out the Hubologists.
---
Last time I checked repair kits are nice to have not pay to win though ?
---
I recommend wearing the BoS fatigues. It'll have a nice desaturaed look
---
Amrite
---
I mean yeah, that’s a pretty fair argument. They could design some cooker stuff. Hell, I’d pay a lot of a Recharger Rifle/Pistol skin for my laser weapons.
---
Ain't that the truth
---
It’s near the bed and breakfast, follow the cliffs and you should spot it.
---
While I personally would prefer a paid expansion model, I understand that they tend to fragment the player base. So I can see why they’d want to avoid that. 
---
I have no problem with cosmetic mtx, I wouldn’t even have a problem with convenience or QoL mtx if they were one time plan purchases. 
---
I do have an issue with consumable convenience items. Those are simply a developer creating a problem and selling a solution. That incentivizes building inconvenience into the game and that’s just not fun.
---
I'd really like more lenses and camera bodies. A 0.5x (wide angle) magnification lens would be cool, as would things like cameras/film that give you black and white, crazy colors, filters, etc. Hell infrared/night vision film could be useful to explore dark areas, or reveal invisible cyptids or something like that.
---
Also as a photographer... the 105mm lens being super tiny sorta irks me. Because you know... it should be like 105 millimeters (10cm) long!
---
And, Lemme put my photos on my wall at my camp! I know people can hack it on PC and put anything (vulgar) they want in there, but thats why we have player reporting!
---
Your point is and has been very clear, but it still is only your point of view/opinion. Unfortunately for me, that is the current general view and very possible the way BGS has made the raid system.
---
Still to your four points.
---
1. There is not really that much variance on 3\* good legendaries as most only need 2 specific stats to be god tier. I also have close to 80 items waiting for the legendary vendor and not a single 1\* among them.
---
2. Yes, we have no knowledge of time and length of the raid area. If like in Burrows you can run through the mobs then in the end it will be speedruns to the end boss and kill it and then exit. We will only have to wait and see how it's going to be.
---
3. BGS doesn't care if you play 50 minutes a week or 50 hours a week. As long as you play and buy their stuff from Atom shops. If you play less, there is better chance for you to buy Atoms with real money as you are not getting them through game play. Lockouts will make you play longer time to get the items you want.
---
4. Nukes are time gated for the server they were launched, you and I both know that. One of the biggest mistakes BGS did was allow and force server hopping to make the game playable.
---
You have made your point and I have made my point. We see this very differently and neither of us have any idea what the better way will be for the Fallout 76. Only time will tell.
---
Look at your own screen shot. It clearly reads "skin".
---
There is no technical difference between skins or paints in this game. Paints are just new instances if a model with a different texture applied.
---
Thanks peeps. Added and waiting.
---
Their reasoning was ridiculous.
---
"We nerfed it because we thought it felt too much like a mandatory pick".
---
The fuck? Well now you made it even MORE mandatory! Assholes.
---
I logged in after the update, went to the water park, then the fair ground, then to Point Pleasant, and found her in front of the Mothman statue. Musta got lucky.
---
Plans.
---
Theres 2x xp this weekend?
---
The big advantage would be if you pour enough money in you wouldn't have spend perk points on things like luck of the draw or gunsmith meaning you have more free for offensive perks.
---
1600 Atoms.
---
I have both Nuka paint plans If you are interested. I'm on PC.
---
I loved the unlimited weight glitch. I would make people shit their pants when I deployed my army of Power Armor suits.
---
I'm sitting on 5k atoms because I never find anything good in the shop.
---
But you can swap out perk cards...
---
I found the tourist without even knowing it was a random spawn.  I thought it just always spawned at the water park.
---
Finished the quest about two hours ago and tried to help a friend start it,  body wasn’t there.   Had no clue it was a roaming spawn.
---
Kinda bullshit.
---
yes for Bravo
---
There is a difference. A paint can be applied to different models, a skin changes the entire model. Go check the Atom Shop, you'll see some are called paints and other are called skins.
---
I mean... if you just keep everything loose you know the exact number you have of each while with bulk you'd have to remember which ones come in stacks of 10, 15, 20 or 30.
---
Why the downvote? I thought was pretty constructive criticism
---
Ooooh, I didn't see a notice about receiving a plan! Thank you!
---
Yes
---
Any chance someone has datamined future Atomic shop items?
---
Yeah they posted about it a while ago but haven't mentioned it recently, I assume it's still happening:
---

---
You can delete them you know. But fun fact: they do end up in your capture gallery!
---
Not really, you have to trade for it. All plat is purchased by someone. But it evens out the market a bit. Very rich players blow money on plat so they don't need to farm as much buying items from other players.
---
these are generally used as passives that make durability last longer the time you want them equipped is when you are using them in a fight, but if you can just pop repair kits on the go and buy more repair kits on the go it doesn't matter how fast things break rendering these perks obsolete if you are willing to spend the money.
---
Hey, you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the boarder, right?
---
Took 2 or 3 server hops to get it, but sure enough.
---
[Teapot Camera Location](https://imgur.com/a/3XS114n?)
---
As I said, technically they are implimented the same way. And having armors assume the look of other armors just defeats much of the point of the different armors in the first place. Why get x01 armor when I can make my t45 look exactly like it? Better stats? Doesn't mean a whole lot in the end.
---
Now its not possible to enter the silo. Why is this?
---
This is just Bethesda's plan to keep us playing. Low drop chance outfits and plans. Minimal content. God how did Fallout become this.
---
&gt; You seem to not grasp that fun is subjective.
---
I specifically addressed this, so I don’t see how you possibly came to this conclusion.
---
&gt; You are basing everything in the sole assumption that the intent...
---
Let me stop you right there. No. My argument has nothing to do with intent. Again, not really sure where you’re coming from.
---
Yeah, people have been asking for repair kits for awhile. Not sure what that has to do with anything. Repair kits aren’t the issue, the issue is monetizing a way to skip playing the game, which is bad game design no matter how you look at it. 
---
It feels like you don’t understand what I’m saying, or even the issue in general. I never said getting junk is a chore. I said it shouldn’t be. I never mentioned my preferences, in fact I’m trying to talk about the objective side of things. Your reply is so off base, I’m not even sure how to respond.
---
What are you on?
---
Server hop?
---
I got griefed for the first time a couple days ago. I was level 18, he was 113 and he destroyed my entire base before killing me and my teammates
---
Sorry for the late response, a trade would be preferable, but if you don't have the head it's cool.
---
A tse radium and 1k works for me! A tse radium sounds like fun to try out
---
Well if you need the bottom outfit I'll trade for a mask
---
PSN sorry
---
Aaayyy I possibly have the same last name as you. :D
---
Bethesda definitely doesn’t listen to players ‘as much’ as before. But I think these problems are a little different, because in Fallout 3 the game was just over, like there’s no arguing that that would be better than being able to play as your character again. But with Fallout 76 - I could argue that the repair kit problem isn’t as severe, since it’s just a optional add in object that doesn’t really affect anyone - most people were concerned about them breaking their promise. The problems are pretty much on different levels of importance, But 76 has been pretty messed up at launch and while it’s way better now, it still feels like Bethesda isn’t really listening to what people are saying. (In regards to challenge glitches and whatnot). At this point I’m just hoping for the best from them and enjoying the game as is.
---
Is sentinal paint not a drop?
---
I have never run any passive durability perks in survivor mode and have never had a gun break during combat. I just keep my stuff repaired at 200% and if it drops below 75% I’ll repair with my plethora of mats that are prob the quickest and easiest thing to farm in this game
---
Prime's a straight +25% damage against scorched &amp; scorchbeasts, or +36% after the damage calc. Good for a queen fight, but not essential. Better to invest your time in farming Psycho first, as you only need two or three per queen fight.
---
190 pip-boy damage sounds low for a TSE shotgun. Not enough damage perks maybe? Mostly you just need to get there earlier though.
---
So I'll give it for free if you don't have the head.
---
Dang. Can’t help you there.
---
Wow I thought there was at least a tiny percentage of saved weight, and I’ve been collecting SO much plastic to do so, oh well
---
Done and in silo A
---
It’ll never happen. Caps is part of fallout lore. It is, and always will be the currency of choice. They wouldn’t change it ever.
---
You don't want weapons in the atom shop. People think the Assaultron head is p2w or something, but it's virtually the same as a skin. You need the crafting requirements for the regular head and it does the same thing with the same stats except it makes a cute Baaa sound. But the reason you don't want weapons to pop up similarly is for the fact that at the moment legendary effects cannot be applied to crafted weapons. It makes the imposter head a paper weight :(
---
I server hopped and now am inside A
---
That's pretty much what I said
---
Total carry capacity is 235 when wearing regular armor, and inexplicably 225 when I get in my T51-b power armor.  Strength is 15.  I'm using the bear arms and ballistic ammo weight perks, and ditched nearly all food.  I'm using the pharmacy perk and have about 15 pounds of chems/stims/radx.  I have an .50 MG and a Gatling that together weigh about 17 pounds.  I also have a railway rifle that weighs 15 pounds and a shotgun that weighs 15 pounds (I'm ditching the shotgun; no room for 3 weapon types of perks even with 15 strength).  My regular armor is a hodgepodge of legendaries with chameleon and damage resistance perks, and most have deep pockets attached.  I have maybe 12 landmines and grenades total on me, and 5 fusion cores (since they're all 50-75%).
---
I last logged in four months ago.  Mostly stopped playing because when a fat man and four mininukes took up over 10% of the stash alone it just sucked ass to try and do anything more than just play as a heavy machine gunner.  I can get my current carryweight down under 225 okay, but it fills up as soon as I grab a couple guns or some scrap.  What the hell is everyone doing to get so much fucking room?!
---
Strange, ill have to do my biv quests again this weekend then
---
Np thanks though
---
Thank you for that -)) gotta give that tse plasma gatling another go with all the perks on. I almost forgot I tried to do a heavy-gunner pa build after all these months of tse rifling and super-sledging :D
---
Haha possibly? How’s that? Lol
---
There’s no official way of doing it. You could just get a friend to hold onto them and swap accounts
---
You need someone you trust to hold on to them then join back in with other character
---
Despite the fact that they claimed to wanting to provide support and new content for many years, they know (now) that 76 is not here to stay. Not after the botched launch, the constant complaints and the myriad of problems that still plague the game. Bethesda claims that sales figures have been very good and that many people keep playing it. But it's 2019 and they have access to detailed statistics in regards to player behavior. And there lies a huge discrepancy. Turns out that Bethesda grossly misjudged their playerbase. 
---
As a result, they'll try to make as much money as possible while the game is still relevant. And then, after the first wave of free content updates (i.e. at the end of the current road map) they gonna release the game on Steam, make some extra bucks by doing this, add support for mods and then slowly reduce support to the bare minimum... that's why they try to incite a sense of scarcity and urgency when it comes to potentially popular Atomic Shop items. We ought to spend money NOW, not in two or three months, before we finally lose interest and move on to other games.
---
What are the other two stars?
---
Sat-monday hopefully.
---
I have literally 5 str special with rank 2 junk rat. I also have egghead (-3 str) and eagle eyes (-4 str). I'm literally running with NEGATIVE str. My max weight is 195lbs. When I want to do special big haul, I pop excavator armor. I have absolutely ZERO. Zero problems with carry weight.
---
Well if your last name is in the name and starts with a "p", its the same.
---
Idk but every one I’ve joined so far failed. I try my best to be a good conduit but no one still seems to know what to do, and I’m low level so I would do garbage damage to it anyway.They make the smallest amount of damage on the Sheepsquatch and then I watch the timer go lower and lower as no one else becomes a conduit and we fail!
---
Unfortunately I have no friends that are willing to play with me because they stopped playing :((((
---
I splurged on get off my lawn stuff... Waited and i received 👍
---
Nukemanrunning.  You on?
---
Damn. Maybe in the atom shop eventually.
---
Yes,  25000
---
25k I believe
---
25k per character.
---
Oh. Ok
---
Bethesda: "What's that you say? Nerf Bloodied builds into the ground to make them equal to Berserker? Sure, no problem!"  
---
Seriously, be careful what you wish for.
---
Nah. This is why i was against survival mode. You shouldn't get to demand a feature be removed because it bothers you. It's part of the experience.. A "roleplay".
---
Lucky me!!! Signed on, went to waterpark, picked it up off of Ansel first try. This was 2330 central time...I'm gonna guess its gotta be a timing situation. When everyone is on, harder to find. Of course, I'm sitting in a full server on PS4, so idk...
---
On pc, you can change it in the ini file! It changes the light, and the pip boy without affecting your hud (can be changed as well).
---
I have use the iconic amber colours since the beta.
---
Now your just talking in circles. It's simple, a paint is applied to the default models, and skin is it's own model, end of story. If you like the skin and want it, cool.. If not then don't buy it.
---
Enclave items wont have plans. This goes for the armor pieces, underarmor, and PA mods. You can learn the prototype power armor and mods for the undersuits.
---
Your math really helps point out what is going on. Thanks for doing all that effort. But it helps show me where your math is different than mine. For me, acid weighs 0.01 and bulk acid weighs 0.08, which is half the weight of 15 of those items. The difference is that some of us is a perk called Pack Rat. So long as I keep that perk on, I see benefits from almost ALL scrap in bulk.
---
They just want to pressure you into buying Atoms with real money.
---
Warframe store is filled with items, because the game has been out a lot longer than 6 months.
---
If they lowered the cost of the items I would be more interested in getting them. At the current costs I have no interest in doing challenges for free Atoms nor buying them with my money.
---
1400 Atoms (14$) for a skin on Power Armor? I'd be willing to pay 300-400 on them. If they really want more players to spend money, they need to up their game by adding items and lowering the costs by large margin.
---
Has anybody gone and made. More yet? In case you scrap your camera you got one in stash 👍 Can you trade cameras? Not that anybody wants to. But they are in high demand lol
---
I really appreciate you doing all that legwork. I commented on your post. In short, your math is only half complete. Put on a level 3 perk called Pack Rat and try the math again. I think you will find the weight of scrap becomes worthwhile for almost every bulk item.
---
Bait.exe
---
Yeah, they use region-specific tables. The plans that drop in the Forest are mostly common as muck. Even Toxic Valley has a lot of rare stuff (eg BoS armor plans) in the tables.
---
White text pip boy people? I've found my home
---
PSN: Markooshy
---
I have him on me
---
of course not every build relies on passives it would depend on the weapon, but you also have to consider that there are also passives for armor which are often notorious for thier repair costs.
---
TY!
---
I still hate the Repair Kits but I love the rest of the update
---
Good going, Bethesda.
---
What are the other two stars on the lmg?
---
Yo, if anyone on PS4 finds the camera please shoot me a message.
---
I've been searching for eight hours for the damn thing.
---
Good work! I really like it! Keep on drawing! I’m a pistoleer myself. Quad .44 revolver!
---
PSA: You can now buy the ProSnap Deluxe Camera (Broken) @ the Whitesprings Vendors. The update added all the faction vendors to the Vendor Area. You will find extra vendors  (protectrons) in the various stores alongside the original Whitesprings vendors. I've seen at least two vendors with the broken camera for less than 100 caps. Buy it, fix it at the Tinker's Workbench, craft some film for it and you're done!
---
I think the best thing we can do is take pictures of it and send them in to Bethesda in bug reports.  If enough people complain about it maybe they will fix it faster.
---
To make it more viable over the Handmade maybe make the Handmade use 762 ammo like in FO4
---
A feature being removed would suggest there isn't an entire set of servers dedicated specifically to that feature. You don't get to demand how others play, and having someone team request you twenty times so their buddy can stomp you isn't roleplay. I've been gaming for fifteen years and I've done straight roleplay servers in better games and we'd have laughed you off the entire internet for suggesting that qualifies as roleplay. Then we'd have laughed you off the planet with the LARP groups I've in. You like PvP? Phenomenal. There are entire servers for that. Being a jerk and exploiting to get around existing ~features~ specifically developed to prevent the thing you're defending isn't roleplay, unless you're roleplaying a clueless wad in real life.
---
And a camera crew was set up at the top on a viewing platform also
---
Agreed. My favourite build in NV was a sneak Pew Pew build, thoroughly OP in end game :-)
---
Higher ups in the company probably want to make as much as possible and are forcing developers to add such “convenient” features to make that money
---
Thank you so much
---
No problem!
---
it’s not like i play survival anyways, with all the level 150s with bloodied and adrenal reaction stacked. as far as i, a level 70 is concerned, they’re invincible
---
If they had 1000 items instead of 100 you would burn all your free atoms up and be forced to buy to get what you wanted. Yes you could play for months to save up but getting more than 20 in a day is difficult. And those who have money to spend will spend it. If they have something to spend it on. I worked in retail and our manager always said to not let the customer leave the store with his money. He will spend it someplace else. That is exactly what is happening to Bethesda. Their customers are leaving the store empty handed and spending that money in some other store.
---
It take soo many days and doubles.
---
To craft a drink can sometimes take up to 1hr+ just cause of spawn luck and fermenting time. Also if you didnt know you can put it in your stash and it will ferment it all (10 at a time but you dont have to reload it) 👍  hope thats not a bug lol
---
Ah, and yet, I'll still procrastinate.
---
By the chair assembly or whatever it's called
---
Your numbers don't come anywhere near 200 weight. Are you sure you're not lugging around 1k gunpowder or something? People tend to miss the stuff in Misc.
---
he might’ve been being sarcastic, t45 jetpack plans aren’t that rare
---
You sound like a crying little fucktard trying to tell others how to game. Why don’t you stfu and go back to one of your other games? Poor little snowflake can’t handle people that want to be raiders 😂😂😂
---
I server hopped on PS4 at the water park in toxic valley yesterday, took like 8-10 tries. Just walk like 50 ft forward from where you spawn and he'll be against the car on your right. Probably more effective than running around the map.
---
I agree. Bethesda has made my do not buy for at least 6 months list. Give it time to see if they actually created a decent game or just another bug filled grind.
---
Gotta get dem micro transactions
---
You lucky duck!
---
Ok, not defending repair kits, i think Bethesda made a reabad choice adding them but... How would they possibly make any difference. I seriously doubt anyone will go "raiding" with gear that is almost broken then decide "oh im not gonna fast travel to my camp to repait real quick, instead i use one of these repair kits MUAHAHAHA"
---
I assume you’re on PS4? Are you selling the plans?
---
Yep they should be encouraging various parts of the map to be hubs of activith and yet are squashing it everywhere they can
---
Bethesda are extending the Horsemen of the Apocalypse from Fallout Shelter with Unique Power Armor skins, essentially letting you have have the unique Horsemen appearances for the Power Armor you use instead of locking you out of using it because you don’t have/main a specific variant.
---
Which is basically 280 caps per suit you can use it for
---
+1 Agility, 50% limb
---
Oof. Someone is hurt and way too defensive, gramps. Want to 1v1? Adventure mode of course. Atleast point me to your camp?
---
50% Limb Damage, 90% reduced weight.
---
Yea fr, shop items are super misleading too. I bought the wiffle bat skin cause I thought it would look sick with the heated rocket, But it just makes all mods invisible.
---
What console are you on?
---
I get that but it seems to me that if you go as long as i have (late nov) playing and havent got much to show for it then then you continue to make it harder its going to make players leave. I have a few three star weapons and armor but I have yet to get one myself worth keeping. I needed to buy them with caps or trade and they are not the quality of items people keep in high regard. The luck factor is horrible.
---
Thats whats off and why i dont like/use the pipboy. Its the colour. White or Blue. Orange was Exclusively for new vegas it just..........Blended.  so. well For that game. In 76 I like the other view cause I can see myself change. Without closing the "pipboy"
---
Looking for Caps or 5.55 ammo now
---
MWO is another good example. Players there spend hundreds on Mechs. I personally have over 120 and will buy more. But Bethesda has not put enough quality into the game or their store merchandise to justify spending any cash on the game. They ignore major problems with the game like the disappearing inventory items which quite often are legendary weapons. Generic pipe pistols never disappear. They don't even acknowledge they know the problem exists and that they are working to resolve the issue. Who wants to spend cash on an item only to fast travel and find they no longer have it.
---
Look at the in game name. It clearly reads "paint"... dur...
---
This "paint" vs "skin" argument is stupid and moot. The point is there is a clear expectation that until now, variants did not change the model to that of another set of armor (Read as example, making your T-45 look like X-01.
---
its business, they need to make money somewho.
---
you just mad becuase you dont have enough free atoms to buy whatever you want. 
---
buy more atoms or wait for it to go on sale. 
---
it also has to do that BGS are very generous with the atoms, they should lower how much we can get for free, and bring the prices down in the AS.
---
Literally anything from fallout 3 or new Vegas. That’s a gold mine of unique weapon skins and outfits just sitting there
---
Yeah, but consider this:
---
You'd have a lot of people with thousands of 5.56 rounds already farmed for their handmade. They would get understandably confused and pissed, especially if they aren't "gun people" (I'm not, I'm just from texas. Gun stuff is everywhere).
---
Additionally, it makes no sense to have mass quantities 7.62 guns in west virginia, let alone wherever nukaworld was supposed to be set. You could argue "but commies, they made them by hand, probably with hammers and sickles". But there's also the availability of the ammunition, and tooling to make that ammunition. 5.56, being the "NATO" round (meaning used by everyone thats not the commies) would be a lot more common.
---
So I think 5.56 makes more sense for the time being. Now a semi-auto 308 version of the R91... that I could get behind!
---
I found him 2 nights in a row at Colonel Kelly Monument
---
If I'm playing 1v1 it's on a Tristan in EVE. I'm playing an Adventure server on a story game for a reason.
---
I've been hoping servers traveling to the water park and monument
---
Now people are looking for them. They will see them more often.
---
If you have rad resistance and your inside your camp, you wont notice it... hear the thunder maybe... Uunnnnless you lookoutside.
---
Yeah I guess you’re right, and a 308 version of the r91 would be godly
---
Wrong. The gaming industry is fucking themselves. Companies like Microsoft and ID made great games without ever having pay to play. They did it on one price for the game. But they made quality games.
---
One day a random thing dropped the plans so I can make the ultracite laser I don’t know what or how but I’m 90 percent sure I was level 20 then
---
Thanks man, I appreciate you doing this a lot. Your world was full so I didn't want to block traffic and I had to log off anyway but next time I see you online I'll be playing Santa haha

Except it's not strictly a story game. Geezus.

Not a smart sales tactic. I went to purchase an item only to find it not available. So no sale! That is a sale missed forever. If a new player starts the game today none of those items are available to him. So they will never get his money if he may have wanted one of them. The store is so limited in choice now taking any item out is just bad business. They need more choice, not less. You would buy the items you want even if they never left the store. Having seasonal items is one thing but weekly items is just more Bethesda insanity that won't pay off.

I have to deal with a stupid ass bugged UI everysingle time I repair literally anything while also having to spend twice as much time in the UI and on the workbench because of Repair Kits making it so you can't repair on the main menu of the workbench anymore, why wouldn't I be annoyed at Bethesda selling stuff in a game I paid 80bucks for when it didn't even work.
---
I've got to take my rickety old bones to bed, but thanks for being respectful in your responses even though we don't agree. It's highly appreciated. Have a silver.

Ah, thanks! I've actually never explored that area in detail at all.

I'll have to go on up and server hop for the camera.
---
Hey no problem!
---
Everyone swears it’s super rare but I saw two in one play session
---
Lever action rifles?
---
Me too, that’s the only place I could get him to spawn
---
Yes, you apply the power armor skin at the power armor station. Weird....
---
Only affects outgoing damage, not incoming. The current trick being used is having one player spam people team requests nonstop until they accept, and that player is working with another that is already aggressive to them. The unsuspecting new teammate is then fair game to the aggressive player. As soon as they die, they're booted from the team and the pair take off to find someone else to repeat the process. It is exploiting a loophole in the way damage is handled in Adventure, and having Pacifist mode on just means you can't even defend yourself if it happens.
---
Really? That’s because of the Repair Kits? I thought it was a stupid change they randomly made to change the controls around or something. In this case we should get the old way of repairing back, that’s just incredibly dumb to keep as a feature.
---
Now all we need is the anticheat software to flag people for speed hacks :|
---
Yes! Change your hair. Wear a helmet.

Look at the name genius. It says "paint".
---
1. Two specific 2* traits for weapons, yet I haven't found a single one of those out of all the two and three star weapons I have found. That is the definition of a lot of variance, and precisely why the content should be repeatable. I played for a couple hours tonight, killed a dozen or so three star mutants/ghouls and got a very poorly rolled 3* pistol for my effort. Whoo, rewarding!
---
2. Yes we will, but its certainly not going to be 1 3* legendary per 2.4 minutes.
---
3. Yes, they do. If you are playing 50 minutes a week, most people will be less likely to spend money on Atom shop stuff, because it's something they are hardly invested in. People spend money on frivolous stuff in games that they care about. Lockouts wont make you play the game longer, just the same time span, or less, with less time played overall. It also makes it easier to completely cut ties with the game if you are barely playing it.
---
4. lol wat. People launched three nukes in a row. A player can launch a nuke from a given silo every few hours. There are three silos. Nuke zones last at least like two hours. A team of two, or even a solo player, can constantly launch nukes by server hopping and rotating who launches what nuke, using all silos. You and I both know that.
---
It's funny to me that you say BGS made a mistake by allowing server hopping to make the game playable. Said another way, if there isn't repeatable content that players can do to keep themselves busy, the game is unplayable.
---
That is an argument for my point of view - that content should be repeatable, as much as a player wants, because otherwise the game is unplayable. 
---
Really, think about that last statement you made and compare it to what you are saying the raids should be like. You are simultaneously complaining that people are able to farm zones as much as they want, saying that this ability is what makes the game playable, and then advocating for systems that limit or remove that ability. All in an effort to... make people play less, over longer periods of time, grinding the same content so BGS doesn't have to make more to keep it interesting, and to your mind drive them to spend more in the Atom shop to buy overpriced cosmetics.
---
And... that's all good stuff that you think will retain players and bring new ones in?
---
You must think the players are pretty stupid. Go check out Anthem backlash to see what happens when the players realize that the company is structuring the game to make you slog through unrewarding content with time-gated access for a *chance* at better stuff, while trickling in currency, of which you need a massive amount, to pay for overpriced cosmetics. That game is in crisis mode because of the kinds of ideas you are espousing. Once/day legendary missions (vault raids). 63k coins for a spray paint, which is literally days or weeks of grinding (atoms for skins - why not just make the players want to play less by making everything unrewarding and time gating the good stuff, so they buy Atoms instead of earning them!?), unrewarding stronghold missions ad nauseam (go do whitesprings and harpers ferry til your eyes bleed!). 
---
If BGS listens to you, the game will be dead by the end of the year, maybe this time next year. Anthem tried all these things right out of the gate, and now they are slowly walking it back, giving the players what they want. Which is? Infintiely repeatable content that rewards the players for their time with gear and collectibles instead of expecting them to grind endlessly for scraps with limited chances at better gear through arbitrary time gates.

Wavy Willards seems pretty easy. Fast travel there and a car with Ansel leaning on it will be directly in front of you.  I server hopped maybe 4 times and he showed up.  Easy place to get to from the spawn point.
---
You can read the sub as well as I can, and tell that numerous people had to server hop a lot or fast travel a lot. As with all random spawns, sometimes you're lucky and sometimes you're not.
---
Factoring in Pack Rat you're looking at amounts of weight that are approaching so minuscule they're nearing inconsequential for all but the craziest of hoarders, like a psychopath I ran into in a thread yesterday who  claimed he was constantly carrying around 50 bulk steel on top of all of his other bulked junk.  Yes, bulking that steel alongside Pack Rat would have saved them about 7lbs of carry weight... but who on Earth needs to be carrying around 1500 steel scrap at all times?
---
For the sake of not caring about this anymore I'll concede Beth should have been more clear about the difference between a skin and a paint.... But they make the difference known at the point of sale in the Atom Shop, which is where it actually matters. That doesn't negate the fact you're arguing semantics, and by simply paying attention you won't be stuck in the horrible situation where your T45 looks like an X01.

Took me two and a half hours of server hopping till I got him.

Hey, good news! I do that. I also haven't been a victim of this particular issue, but that doesn't make it ok, and it operates off an obvious exploit. It also requires every player on a server to individually block someone who is consistently harassing players by spamming requests.

Ima comin! GT TheBleedingRed
---
Old Ranger 275 on route!
---
Yes, leads me to believe the burrows was originally a quest they just shoved aside for later. 
---
Much like how Nuka World for FO4 felt like it should’ve been there from the start.
---
Just checked, I learned the recipe. But dont have an extra copy. Sorry man
---
Survival is so screwed up as it is. The rewards we used to get over there are pretty well gone. Used to play over there to gain caps. There's no money in it now. Almost no one carries aid or junk so there's no loot either.
---
To compound on this issue, some will use glitches to become unreachable and camp spawn points. Others will camp out a considerable distance away and snipe at others who can't even see them because they haven't even rendered yet, or won't because of the distance (using a scope will show players who aren't rendered yet due to distance). 
---
When it first started, I pilfered a great deal of caps and loot. Now everyone dumps both of these before heading over. It's just not worth it anymore, especially considered even if you do find someone with caps, you'll collect 1/8 the payout you'd have gotten before. I'd rather go to adventure and collect 4 times as much and be more likely to score loot.
---
I miss the old super sledge design..
---
I thoroughly enjoyed the rundown of each weapon.
---
Coming!
---
Mine does and this weapon is insane if you have All heavy weapon damage buffs. damage boost for strength perks, plus adrenaline, nerd rage and finally Bloody Mess all maxed.
---
I don't even think some of the dupers sold them that cheaply.
---
Idk how much people sell them for
---
Just go to the town where you did the Nuka shine quest if you finished it. There is tons of beer bottles around
---
On my way!
---
Were fairly sure somebody has set up a bit to downvote new posts in this sub in an attempt to generally shit on the atmosphere.
---
It makes all armors look like X0-1
---
I like it, because I love the look of X0-1, but getting mods for it is a pita, so I always had t-60 legs, removing the paint from the x0-1 so it doesn't stand out, now I can have the entire set look the same.
---
So I nuked the spot. Not great news but something interesting happened.
---
After I nuked the spot, I checked a few indoor locations and started noticing something. Every indoor location had a certain map marker on my hud. The map marker was the one that marks the center of a nuke zone.
---
Soooooo, what does this mean?  It leads me to believe that indoor areas are somehow grouped together at the center of the map, but are either too deep to be affected or are only virtually located there.
---
Either way it seems like another dead end.
---
I wish there were more interesting places to nuke.
---
Put the camera away drama queen.
---
Why did you not buy it when you saw it then?
---
Alien toy?
---
1/2 :  Both cases would result in the adventurers becoming Scorched as the plague has not been eradicated and they aren't inoculated.
---
3: the vault dwellers would need to be vaccinated prior to exiting the vault otherwise they would succumb to the same fate. Of course, given Vault-Tec's history, the chances of a vault (other than a control vault) having surviving dwellers is not very high.
---
66!
---
You're. Im sorry reddit internet friend but i must make this correction.
---
this here. it's predatory and disgusting.
---
Yeah, I was thinking about the whole scorched plague thing with the travelers, about how it's only a limited time event, or you might come across dead travelers throughout Appalachia. 
---
But, I mean like it was just an idea, I guess to maybe spice up the game a bit, maybe add some variety, or some cool random encounters. :/
---
I would be more cool with the limited time stuff if i knew it would eventually come back.   I just broke the bank scraping challenges together to get the silver excavator armor.    unless i knuckle down and try to bang out the little "ATOM" challenges (IF THEY WORK) i have left there is no way in hell i'm gonna be able to come up with 1400 atoms unless i "BUY" them.   which is exactly what there Money Store people want.    I'm a OCD Style (gotta have it if it's limited) type of person but with the way the atom store is currently i'm picking and choosing what i "REALLY" want.  and i'm not gonna dump any more then the initial 60$ i put into for right now.
---
XB if it matters, but I bought 2 for 1500 each about 2 weeks ago.  The seller had a few more, wish I had bought them all.  Had 8k after I got them, gave one of the recipes to a friend and 2 weeks later have 21K and around 40 serums to cash in.  I'd pay 3K easily if on XB, just to give some perspective on value.
---
any mods you add to the gun don't get the reduction in weight
---
Pretty much
---
They're making us pay for the shitty reception the game got when they released it in alpha.  
---
And if we don't pay, our game will die.  
---
Bastards.
---
I hope Bethesda listens. This is a must
---
Can't speak for the XB1 economy, but if you bought them for 1.5k you were no doubt buying from a duper, which from my understand was far more prevalent on the XB1 than PS4, which is saying something because it got out of hand bad on PS4.
---
You're joking? That seems a little ridiculous, is that intended?
---
Just drop in front of me in its original form just like in FO4. It could be set up so if you are in your CAMP it doesn't disappear...
---
And it makes you click "OK" to confirm you are making yourself open to PVP.. So, read things that pop up on the screen before you click them.
---
Ok that makes sense, but how about junk 'displays' you could snap to surfaces just like decorations?
---
Also, My camp is on the south peak of Seneca Rocks, if you wanna knock off a quick daily 
---
gt/KittiHawke
---
I have seen it where if a player uses their perks to pacify an enemy they can get stuck in pacified mode if someone else loads the area. It's a small bug
---
You can climb the northern peak by jumping on rocks, no need for Marsupial or Jetpack. For the other one, I needed a Jetpack torso. I can't run and jump, I fell into a small chasm between the peaks and had to jetpack ledge by ledge.
---
Retweet
---
Agreed, like it!
---
Can I learn the dense mod from scrapping, or is it a bought mod only?  
---
Explosive shotgun is causing a lot of respawns....
---
You'll need a radiation suit or power armor and lots of RadX (diluted if your mutated) and RadAway.
---
Not everybody knows this Franchise. There are many new and young people , that discover this and they will never have the chance to get it. Frankly not everybody with responsibilitys has the time to know about this timed items. This reduces the replay value because there are simply some items you cant get ... not even with money
---
Agreed, it's so annoying.  Make the sales limited time, but leave the stuff in the shop ffs
---
Landview Lighthouse.
---
Could be, I just saw it posted and bought one each for myself and my buddy.  It's not like the person had a ton of recipes for sale, but I agree, it was a good deal either way.  Like I said, 3K seems fair enough, you only need 1 recipe to use it to get rich.  Plan collectors is another thing, but at least they know where to find the recipes from MODUS.
---
What do you?! 
---
Mean fedoras and 1* wood armor are the best!.....
---
😋
---
Yes that music makes my ears bleed.
---
The forest does not drop power armor plans, as the loot you get is region locked to level 15, and the only suit of power armor that low is raider, which is excluded from the forest region.
---
Also, most weapon plans are level 25+, so overall the forest is just trash tier plans like the rolling pin, boxing glove, and pipe weapon mods you can learn by scrapping 50 of the things.
---
Where would I be without my nocturnal wood arm?
---
A spy is sneakin' 'round here
---
Janitor's closets at schools and hospitals all over the map will have the varieties of Abraxo, as well as the "rich folk's" homes in the Toxic Valley. 
---
The various fire departments tend to have cleaning supplies. 
---
All of these locations sometimes have Industrial Solvent. 
---
If you find a laundromat or a place with laundry machines chances are there'll be some in the same room. 
---
Chem labs tend to have various cleaning solvents as well. 
---
Other stuff with antiseptic includes turpentine, toothpaste (already mentioned) and the customary "wild antiseptic". 
---
Farms tend to have an impressive variety of substances available, although they can be tucked into odd corners or in the upper floors / lofts of various storage buildings or the like.
---
Wow, talk about someone with a miserable life.
---
bought mod only, now you can still find the mods for the dense but not the plans anymore or the bos plans and it's been like that for like 4 patches now if not longer
---
COMMUNISM!!!!!
---
The very first place I looked- they don’t count as beer bottles for crafting Molotov cocktails
---
&gt; But they make the difference known at the point of sale in the Atom Shop, which is where it actually matters.
---
Oh but they didn't.
---
The atom shop category is listed as "skins", but they put the "paints" in there?
---
Even the paints say "Skin is craftable at power armor stations".
---
As mentioned before, it may say skin on the shop page, but actually in game it is called a paint.
---
So it is pretty damn clear that Bethesda has used the terms interchangeably.
---
&gt; That doesn't negate the fact you're arguing semantics
---
Semantics are important here though. The terms have been used interchangeably, so if anyone was confused by this, it is completely understandable why they would be annoyed by their armor now looking like X-01 when all past "skins" (As per the category title) have not changed models like this.
---
Your argument is that skins are different than paints. In this context, they objectively are not different. The semantics are important.
---
&gt; and by simply paying attention you won't be stuck in the horrible situation where your T45 looks like an X01.
---
I'm not in that situation.
---
My point has been sufficiently proven.
---
I can't play the game during Easter, It's only a week but I feel like I lost a lot of things already
---
That's what the camera/emote glitch is for.
---
&gt;There are no other Perk Cards in Intelligence besides Durablility and Hacking that would benefit any other Weapon Build.
---
No the aae and its rw has been broken for a while i have other handmades with the same mods and rw and it weights 5 pounds less
---
You didn't read the pop up message that appears when you claim a workshop, that's what happened.
---
As cool as this sounds I would prefer if they fixed (made reasonable to use) weapons that are allready ingame. Just try to kill supermutant with laser or plasma rifle...
---
Okey dokey, thanks for the help
---
I think it's far too easy to find to be valuable.
---
You seem to have stuck around.... what’s up with that?
---
Also, join a team and use the radsponge perk - share the card. You won't really burn through any RadAway with the perk.
---
It works for vendors now surely an easy fix for players
---
This mechanism is intended to encourage people to play more often and to spend real money. 
---
Every player does not need to get 100% of the items. If you wanted that, then I guess the above statement would work for you.   Those that do not invest with real money?   Just get a few of the items that would make you happy... or wait until something popped up.   
---
But I seriously doubt Bethesda will change the limited time items as it makes them money.
---
Even when you are someone that has the money and the will to buy skins and you are busy because you somehow have to earn this money and you dont look into the game everyday then you can easyly skip some skins and even though you would buy them with real money you simply cant
---
Well, if you're feeling gutsy, wear a hazmat suit. You'll take very little rad damage and can pretty much survive til it's over, as long as nothing else kills you, and you have some RadAway in case your rads get up too high. You'll have no armor whatsoever, so you'll be extremely squishy. If you have the right perks, like Serendipity (Luck), it may help you to avoid some incoming damage, but your luck won't last that long.
---
Or, if you have power armor you can wear that. You'll take more rad damage than you would in a hazmat suit, but it's still significantly less. I also believe you'll need a helmet or it'll be like you're not wearing the power armor at all. Just bring lots of RadAway.
---
In either case, take Rad-X, which will reduce your rad damage intake drastically. If you have a lot of them, bring'em with you as their effects will wear off after time. If you're mutated, Rad-X will stunt your mutation(s) till it wears off.
---
Weapon wise it's good to have a few that'll last awhile and packs a good punch. If you go with higher level friends, let them do the heavy fighting. As long as you get a shot in you'll get XP and loot.
---
Be wary of players who want to trade with you in nuke zones. Some will look to see what you have and then kill you and take it, especially Hardened Mass and flux, which go into your junk (I could be wrong about the flux, as it may go into aid instead, so it's safe). In other words, don't trade with anyone while in a nuke zone.
---
That's about all I have for tips. Generally it's best to go in with friends and lots of Rad-X and RadAway., but you will not survive for long without a hazmat suit or power armor with a helmet. Good luck.
---
It took me hours and I finally gave up. I came on here to see if anyone on PC had one spawning and sure enough someone did. I friended them, hopped on their server and bam, done.
---
Keep an eye on here for someone who's playing on your console to post.
---
I would love to buy it from you!!
---
I’m on Xbox....
---
there’s a perk card that reduces armor weight to 50% (can’t remember what it’s called, but it’s in strength). I also use weight reduction armor, I carry round near to 100 weapons and I’m hardly ever over encumbered
---
“Prepared for a nuclear or possibly even biological attack from China, the U.S. President and the Enclave retreat to remote sections around the globe and make contingency plans for continuing the war” 
---
The enclave could be everywhere and anywhere at any given time. We know of them from the west coast and the east coast but nothing in between. What could they be doing over there... I need more lore.
---
and giant scorpions.
---
Eh a rifle but can still one shot them
---
np
---
Well regardless, we are of the same Mexican (Padrõn) clan.  Bye!
---
Just had this happen to me at fort defiance, it was everywhere I could see, once I ran out of it and it was gone altogether. But yeah like a disco floor all of a sudden, but so deliberate it seemed
---
Hey if you find a tourist on PS4 please let me know and I’ll do the same. I’ve been searching for hours at a time in the same 3 spots and I can’t find anything. It’s becoming really annoying
---
Technical data is all over the place. Safes especially, just about anywhere, as well as various cabinets locked or otherwise.  Now and then a critter's carcass will have one as well, usually the nastier stuff such as bears/yao guai.
---
When I was hopping servers attempting to acquire Plan: Pump-Action Shotgun I gathered 8 technical data within a few hours from the Charleston Herald's filing cabinets.
---
Well I guess they never got around to adding it in the next patch huh?
---
Too busy giving the people what they want........ repair kits...
---
They're supposed to be adding human npc's at some point. Some people speculate it'll be when they decide to open vaults 63 and 96. I dunno how they'll pull it off with them not being inoculated against the scorch plaque, but I'm sure they'll think of something when and if it happens.
---
Demolition expert?
---
Yeah. This. It's easy in hindsight to forget the paranoia that gripped America during the Cold War and how that same paranoia was present in Fallout's alternate timeline during the end times.  It's reflected in much of the patriotic artwork in the game.  It's also present in the dialogue with pre-war characters, like the brains of Big MT.
---
Yup, and it really throws off the genuine "feel" of the sub.  
---
You know how the first couple of up/down votes dictate how a thread or comment will be viewed by the rest of the sub, well if they can get in a couple of early downvotes, they can sway things.
---
Excellent.
---
My camp was visited by level 5 and 6 griefers last night. No idea what they were thinking.
---
Don’t know if anyone has wrote something like this but I’ve ran into a Brahmin 2 different times that was dead (at one of those random encounter spots) and when I went to go loot the body it said it had “Mysterious Quill” inside of it. Like 3 or 4 and you can see the quills sticking out of the Brahmin too
---
Did you completely forgot the commie bastards invaded Alaska!!! . Colonel Gusty needs to kick someone’s commie ass!
---
Very good info :) Thank you for this!
---
My pipe revolver carried me through lvls 10 - 30. Decent power, durable, and a decent reload rate.
---
Sounds like me the first time I went to a blast zone! No stupid questions!
---
Yeah if I create a post and I immediately get one downvote it goes nowhere. Even if it’s just a simple question it just gets whitewashed away and I have just wasted my time
---
They want your money. That’s literally it, it’s terrible.
---
The cryptid ones are pretty bad, but alcohol isn’t so bad. Just trade! I do have most (all?) recipes, I’ve sold a few brews to different folks so they could get their atoms.
---
I thought they removed that function because people where snooping in preparation to pvp.
---
Interesting since there are some recipes you can buy that cost 19500 caps at the sciencewing of the enclave. This is quite close to the cap limit
---
They could always remap the inspect button to start/options/PC equivalent. It could then replace inspect universally without interfering with any other menu commands.
---
Cool :D Nice to see 76 is giving you inspiration :)
---
WTH...I was not even trying to start the quest and upon arriving in white springs there was Mr tourist 😅
---
No one said it was p2w, but it's a weapon not a cosmetic. Is the weapon change compared to the in game only cosmetic? Yes, but it's still a weapon in the shop. The idea behind that and the precedent it sets is bad for us as consumers. Not to mention the added downside of those who have nice assaultron head legendaries can't apply it as a skin... It's just an unfortunate decision on every front from Bethesda. I'm exceptionally sad, this game launched to a shitstorm of bad press (mostly deserved but far overblown). They started bringing it back and were making solid strides, but then they keep slipping shit in like repair kits (not awful in and of themselves but again, they're setting precedents and breaking promises) and now a weapon that should have just been a skin. Why the fuck wasn't it just a skin? It makes absolutely no sense on any level... unless they're starting the atom weapon shop small with cosmetic/event weapons.
---
Molotov cocktails are built at the weapons bench as I recall. Since there is a "default" Atoms challenge to build 76 of them, get 76 beer bottles plus the requisite oil and whatever else stockpiled. Then build 'em all at once.
---
I had something similar happen when my shotgun broke in VATS while I was spamming on the SBQ. I VATS unarmed attacked her while she was VERY high up and literally got sent flying into the sky to punch her. I died to fall damage. Wish I clipped it.
---
Check who is on your server, put it in a container log out, then switch characters and then rejoin using one of those people you saw on your server earlier. Check the container for your stuff.
---
Communism and Constitutional Republic are complete opposites of each other. One ideology hates the other becuase it hinders grow in economy becuase it’s not helping support the nation while the other wants to spread its information for more control of people to create a powerful government. I’ll let you figure out which is which from that information.
---
You must be playing on PC, as our limit is 3 characters per account, unless they've recently increased it.
---
PS4, and I have 5.
---
Feels good. I'm gonna get fallout fixed. One bug at a time.
---
Well I'd love to see a video of oneshotting SB; you should definitely make that happen.  
---
I haven't personally used snipers since November and am not a fan of vats critting in general, so there's that...
---
Then maybe it's just Xbox.
---
Because they're meant to be difficult to get. Only other way to get them is by a queen drop or buying from another player.
---
Yeah. But you just nerfed fun.  Ordinarily that’s Bethesda’s job.
---
But if they put cool stuff in the Atom Shop then you'll buy the cool stuff and leave all the pointless stuff instead of buying the pointless stuff out of boredom and if they *leave* the cool stuff in the shop then you'll have time to earn the atoms for them via challenges and if you earn all your atoms via challenges then you won't buy atoms with real money **which is the entire premise, purpose and point of what they are trying to do with the Atom Shop.**
---
It's not pleasant, but it's the reality of what Fallout 76 is intended to be.
---
My gold skin instigating prime .44 is a pretty decent weapon.
---
 But I really wanted to have a good 10mm so that I could use the tricentenial skin.
---
I only use the first level of each pistol damage perk quick gives me 30% extra damage.
---
yea those 2 don't stack ..but if you have 2 pieces of armor with the 50% those do stack :)
---
bloodied, vampire’s, furious (for fast fire rate weapons), explosive for rifles, swing speed for melee. for three stars probably faster reload or fire rate, reduced weight, strength for melee
---
sure, but if that's what it takes to get noticed. im posting another minor exploit later if I can trigger it.
---
Same as mine :D
---
% damage reduction and armor penetration perks doesn't stack up, each % is calculated alone and then added to the total reduction. So none damage reduction/armor penetration it's gonna be 100%. (Sorry for my bad english)
---
If youre on PS4 I can give you a mole miner mascot mask. Psn is kit_cloud.
---
Leaching children's toy with lead. Just scrap the toys :)
---
i think it takes the perk first and then applies the armor effect, so you’ll get like 95% reduction. damage reduction perks and effects stack in a weird way, but if you have two armor pieces with 50% fall damage reduction that should stack to 100% reduction
---
💪
---
I don't have a problem with it tbh. Besides, there's a new pistol card coming according to datamines. I actually use both perk cards; the pipe revolver benefits from both the rifle and pistol perks once upgraded to a pipe revolver rifle. It works. I only wish I found a legendary one.
---
I've gotten a few helmets and no outfits.
---
Coming!!
---
I just want it to be white ngl
---
This is amazingly helpful. I was curious as to why I snapped a picture of a vertibot and it counted for the sheepsquatch instead.
---
If Demolition isn't already in everybodys non replaceable Core Build than i don't know why is everone running around with duped Explosive Weapons. You cant really replace that with better cards, everyone has it. Dunno 'bout you but with 10 intelligence (what you need to equip demolition) you still have plenty of room for durablity/repair and crafting stuff. Don't need to remove them so i can fully use the potential of repair kits. I never repairded my power armor since i got it.
---
This is why we need a weekly question sub.
---
Although maybe mods don’t want that as it will make the sub seem less active.
---
Well, I happen to like bulking my stuff.
---
At the very least it removes clutter from the list of junk I have to scroll through. No more searching for that raw/scrap item.its all right there in bulk.
---
Also If I didn't bulk all of my stuff all of the time, it would rot in my inventory(I'm a hoarder what can I say)
---
I appreciate the math, just because selling it is
---
Yeah, it’s not there, but I never finished so it shouldn’t be there.
---
that second mod could be for the excavator power armor
---
I met someone playing who had lots of friends (300) and could not play. They fixed it by removing the 300 friends then it worked. That’s what they said but cant confirm this myself. I think having lots of friends stretch’s the memory usage too much in the game.  Do at your own risk. Or contact  Bethesda support. Good luck
---
I got my main character, and 3 alts full of stuff lol
---
Just found the same - first thought was that it was the headquarters of CH Monthly, but then Fallout Wiki reminded me it must be Ray Gary.
---
I think!
---
Also the friends noted:
---
Mike 
---
Glen
---
Scoot (Mr Wendigo)
---
Jerry
---
Cal (obviously)
---
Andrew
---
Shawn
---
 
---
Can anyone identify the others?
---
I'm highly suspicious of "Shawn".... given  there was a "Shear Terror"... :)
---
Nerd rage as well
---
Why?Repair Kits are pretty useful for repairing something on the fly , in a dungeon , nuke facility or whatever.And making them available for purchase with real money gives us lazy players an opportunity to get rks without the grind.
---
You can become an alcoholic now, fight an impossibly hard boss at an event or run through a small dungeon. This next patch should include the scout quests if the data miners are correct.
---
Please I need this!!
---
i installed the latest nvidia drivers and the logitech software, did not change anything.
---
Just added you buddy. Join me.
---
The dude is right. Everytime I claim one, the game crashes one way or another then I have to fight and waste aid getting it back. What's the point if you can't keep it when you log out.
---
move camp to a new spot.
---
* STILL HERE *
---
Do you still have the cores? When will you be in game?
---
Oh, I didn't know about that, but if it's true, then I think that that's great news!
---
I saw a post earlier that the camera could be bought from an ammo vending machine.
---
Don't know how true so take it with a grain of salt.
---
turrets there does not benefit anyone,
---
Agree, a simple preview option... 👍🏻
---
I think people's issue with repair kits is that they're a non-cosmetic micro transaction, so somebody with enough disposable money could keep their weapons fully repaired all the time, giving them an unfair advantage over players less willing to spend money.
---
I think the real outrage from it comes less from the specific example of repair kits, and more for the precedent it sets. As expensive as atomic shop items have been up until now, it's at least all been cosmetic items which don't directly affect gameplay.
---
If repair kits are okay, it might open the gates for other gameplay influencing microtransactions, which runs counter to Bethesda's promises before the games' release, where they said microtransactions would only ever be cosmetic.
---
Must vary by location.  As Grafton steel hasn't given me any new plans since I got the BOS legs 2 days ago
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH!! You’re a life saver! I just got off after searching for a little and I spent all yesterday searching too. I’m so happy I might cry :’)
---
Read the roadmap. I feel like it would be cold. WV's climate and temperature proves that theory. They get an average of 30 inches of snow and it gets in the 20's during winter. I also feel like there might be exclusive enemies in the Nuclear Winter mode.
---
you do realize that  you have everything you need to do inside the WS, the only benefit i can see from having a camp there is for the free fast travel, other than that you have a high risk of getting your camp leveled.
---
Glad I could help! I spent all day today as well lol. Enjoy! :)
---
Imagine getting downvoted for speaking the truth. Like you said. If your weapon breaks out in the field thats on you. Its not hard to repair your weapon. Or have a backup weapon just in case. If youre running with only 1 weapon and it breaks leaving you defenseless thats all your own fault
---
We are getting updates in small chunks every other week. Considering how small the dev team is, I appreciate their effort and always welcome new stuff to do, even if it doesn't last long.
---
I still don't know what their plans are for the proper end-game content in Fallout 76. Are they going for the traditional MMO game raids or is it going to be more like Diablo 3/Path of Exile. Either way it will be most likely about the gear grinding. Daily quests for reputation gain to unlock better items at the faction vendors?
---
If you were to place it anywhere I'd say Vault 76 would be the perfect choice. It costs 0 caps to fast travel to and every level of player can access it.
---
How much RAM do you have?
---
this has happened to me a couple times now I know why ! thank you.
---
Add \[XBOX\] to your title. Also, stating how much you're willing to pay would attract more people without thinking they're wasting their time.
---
Are you really trying this hard to get yourself banned? :D
---
/u/Aten_ra
---
You and me both. I’m sure there are more lenses as I’m pretty sure I seen a image showing a few different types but yeah the 105mm looked like a 10-18mm to me 😂
---
That's how the "Freefall Legs" worked in Fallout 4, so you are likely correct.
---
Dear god. I hate Bethesda as much as the next guy right now, but this is messed up
---
Trying to get this game fixed. This stuff needs addressing and fixing. I am effectively trying to be a beta tester now. Going to video every single bug/exploit/bad thing I see.
---
Or you could just use PA to safely jump down from any height
---
Until now I haven't even considered renaming the camera... I think I'm gonna call it PapaRADzzi! Heyooo.
---
I found one in Grafton train station, a note about two girls who went off into the forest near the waterways by Clarksville. I didn't spend too much time but searching gave nothing but there was nothing in the quests menu after I read it.

Please calibrate the mice after installation.

And post tutorials for others to take advantage of those bugs while you're at it. If you have something to report do it properly. Check Bethesda's own website on how to do it.
---
32G, guess I should update with specs
---
Or maybe they added those items cause people actually wanted them in the game. Majority probably doesn't for one reason or another, but some others do. I think it's all about the matter of personal choice. 
---
You don't have to buy repair kits to stay competitive or to enjoy the game without any restrictions.
---
I've got about 20 *** items put aside
---
I think I have the mascot head. That's the grey one, right? You can have it.
---
16GB would've been plenty. There could be many reasons for why you're experiencing those issues. Game itself could be at fault. I get random CTDs and freezes maybe 2-3 times a week during loading or using the inventory.
---
Does diluted rad-x not interfere with mutations?
---
I killed one the other day during a routinely simple BoS Event that turned into a nightmare...

Pfff... time limited... Blackbird paint will never appear again despite ppl craving for it? Lol, of course not, will be added again at some point to grab some revenue and then another day with a discount. This is a sooo predictable marketing technique.
---
 Just be patient and wait for item to become available for discounted price.
---
I imagined sheepsquatch sewing hats while the server's cooldown between the events. Show some respect! 😂
---
Bethestha programers, sure
---
Really sick of this being broken for months. It's not a hard fix.
---
There's a bunch of touristy places  it spawns at but I just server hopped at the miners monument and got the tourist corpse after a few tries.
---
I did
---
I had no issues renaming mine on PS4, I just shortened the name on it after fitting the 105mm lens. I think I did it at the crafting workbench
---
That's...nots what's happening, here. You posted on reddit and stated that something was super easy, and people who didn't have your experience disagreed with you.
---
You're not being helpful, you're being insulting when our experiences don't match yours.
---
exactly , I don't know a ton about programming but surely this is an easy fix
---
one sometimes spawns behind the abandoned bog town
---
[Lorenzo's Crown](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/23/Lorenzos_Crown.png/revision/latest?cb=20151128154155) is what came to mind as well when I heard engravings, if this is the item OP is looking for I've got some bad news...
---
https://youtu.be/gCp0V9d3un0?t=514
---
I actually just watched a video with a town setup.  
---
I started it at the part where she shows the distance in person, but if you click through the very start, she shows how far apart they are on the map, too.
---
It does not, thats why we Mutants use it ;)
---
Naw, they want to make money not set goals for people to grind challenges
---
I’m not collecting too much until it’s closer to release. But my player inventory is a bit cluttered with legendary melees since I have the weight reduction perk for them.
---
Another good location, two good locations actually, Colonel Kelly Monument and Philippi Battlefield Cemetery. Both in the Toxic Valley, as well. I found Anne at the cemetery, on the path leading up to the cannons.
---
We need a mod for the harpoon gun that does this.
---
Not sure how true this is, but I've seen other posts indicating queen no longer drops recipes.
---
ok thanks
---
If someone offers me caps but says they can't trade till later and someone offers me more, I ask the original buyer if the can match the price, if not I thank them and sell to the highest bidder.
---
I took a pic of the Cargobot that spawns during the Morgantown Airport Event, and it somehow counted for Sheepsquatch as well.
---
It's the same story as any post-apocalyptic entertainment medium.  They leave the reasons for the war vague so as no to offend any potential market. 
---
Years of consumption led to resource  shortages which lead to war.  Resource shortages are a classic way of making a post-apocalyptic movie or video game without really placing blame on any particular country because you are marketing it worldwide and don't want any audience of any country to be offended.    The lore is slickly worded so that Chinese audiences can tell themselves that American greed probably justified the invasion of Alaska and American audiences can tell themselves that China was the villain because communism.
---
Todd is that you?!?
---
The.pond south of Solomon's pond regularly has one
---
The best way to get Mothman is to do the event path to enlightenment he spawns at the end also I found fogcrawlers at treehouse village
---
I ran into this as well. I got a t51 and an Exca suit out of it, it happened while a friend and I were dropping frames so I could mod out his suits. Afterwards, I also had the legs of my excavator I was wearing bug out and showed in my pipboy a couple dozen times each. After I relogged it was just the originals + the accidentally duped pair
---
Server hop and buy as many nuka grapes as you can afford. With just one cola nut perk I can get rid of 800+ rads and completely heal. Plus they dont cure your mutations. Nuka grapes are found in the soda bar on the second floor in whitesprings.
---
Yeah I know, but I don't often use PA; so is a bit of a hassle getting in and out every time
---
Search reddit for.tourist locations, so.eone made a list with locations or keep checking on here &amp; someone will post they have them.
---
They cost about 24k base price, 19500 with Hard Bargain rank 3.  And around 17600 with 15 pts on Charisma. Possibly cheaper if you can continue to boost charisma past 15pts with chems or unyielding armor.
---
You just changed everything. Thank you. 
---
God. I've thrown away so many diluted chems. I have a hoarding problem and 800lbs is just not enough.
---
My wallet is being raided? I haven’t spent 1$ in atom shop
---
Anecdotally, I can say once a Prime plan or serum recipe is learned it won't drop for you anymore. 
---
My main knows all of both and never receives either. My alt knows most serums recipes and also never sees them. He doesn't know all the prime plans however and only seems to get the ones he doesn't know.
---
ok thanks i will check it out
---
Twin lakes. Just south of the middle of the map. Guaranteed spawn point
---
Oh saw that once in the distance as i was climbing some rock. Wasn't sure what was that. I thought that someone ate too much taco or something.
---
Like the one from Fo4?
---
Since the update I've had it crash once or twice a day minium! My PC is more then capable of handling the game its doing my head in lost 2 3star legendarys last night that i just picked up gutted as i have very little decent weapons and finally picked up a good one then 20seconds later crash.
---
2 characters with stash as at least 1/3 full of ☆ if not 1/2.
---
My melee character now has a heap on his person too.
---
There is no "Can become an alcoholic" you want those atom points you are constantly drunk.
---
thanks
---
My buddy keeps asking me where she can get a "Choco Cow" to get some chocolate milk.
---
I had the xp thing happen to me kind of.. I never had the gained xp show up on the screen but when I looked from the Pip-Boy I’m pretty sure I received it. In a SBQ fight when you lag I think sometimes it doesn’t appear only because so much is happening. The loot problem I have had happen on a few Legendaries if I die to my gun as I kill them.
---
I sure will since i have been saving my atoms from the start for the good loot. I wont spend it all tho because i wanna buy the refrigerator too!
---
It can be a bug... ooooor.... bethesda is up to something. Perhaps maybe more Zetans
---
The Hoarding Problem is the sign of a good Fallout Player ... Keep it up
---
(oh and make an alt if you run out of space on your main character =)
---
I’m thinking there will be a cap on how many tokens you can get a day
---
I literally server hopped 35+ times at a spawn location, STILL I haven’t found one
---
 We got nukes, we got knives, we got sharp sticks.
---
For some reson game returns me to my original position shortly after i teleport =\\
---
I just started playing again after a long post launch hiatus.   
---
That sucks dude, hope you have some better drop luck. If it makes you feel any better I'm still using base gear as well haha.
---
Good practice there dovah -a good way to work
---
 Not bad, for a human.
---
Mannequins!
---
Ah okay. Yeah I dont have the head but that’s alright man, I more or less asked out of curiosity- those things are hard to come by and you don’t even know me; I don’t wanna demand a free handout of a rare item. That said if you want some caps for it I could always pay you, but if you wanna keep it as a bargaining chip for the head it’s all good
---
When setting up too close to an existing camp, you'll see a boundary wall, past which you can drop the camp unit. This wall is one camp's diameter from the center of the adjacent camp and is the closest point where you can drop the center of your own.
---
Questions are dangerously close to independent thought, citizen.
---
Easier solution man! Don’t play in 3rd person 😅
---
Yea totally agree, although yea, i simple preview of the active character would be enough for me
---
I never wouldve bought the patterned dress cause I thought it looked weird on the mannequin. Turns out, on my Toon its actually very fitting.
---
they did it for vendors, and it's amazing. We need this!
---
i'm doing the same, you can get the T-series power armor body plans from the distant thunder and line in the sand events
---
Thanks for your help
---
No problem, enjoy!
---
Thanks again!
---
So did this give you the quest??
---
Describing a good deal of US history in one sentence
---
Np, enjoy!
---
Have you not seen the constant bitching about the game somehow being pay to win just for having repair kits in the game?
---
She has 'learned' a new perk now: Vanishing Corpse (the bot version of Last Laugh).
---
Better be real close when she goes down and mash that 'take' button because once she hits the floor... *poof aand she is gone*
---
My title says needs more weapons (or skins in atom shop).
---
I think it's just down temporarily. I've been trying to access the shop all night but it won't load! Relieved to see I'm not the only one having this problem.
---
*like the rest of this subreddit*
---
I think pistols are fine. I have most fun with pistol build. I think Op builds should be nerfed to pistol level
---
Weapons for the game in general. Or in parenthesis weapon skins in the atom shop.
---
Not gonna lie I switched from a ranged build to a melee build just for the higher carry weight. 
---
Ended up being way more fun, so I didn't regret it at all. 
---
Just need to get a decent deathclaw gauntlet now. Got a 3 claw currently but it isn't legendary.
---
@OP: their tactic is good (in bizness term) otherwise you would not have made your post ;)
---
They want you to buy the stuff when it's here.
---
Did people actually ask for them? I didn't see any posts on here or Bethesda forum about them and I scour these places daily.
---
The big question if people did ask for them is did they ask before or after the nerfs to white knight and plumber perks
---
I'm saving all my legendary knifes and low weight weapons for the vendor
---
Yes I can read. It doesn’t matter though. People are still out for blood over this fucking game
---
Noice
---
Make it public and it gets fixed.
---
This one doesn't break the universe, but it needs fixing regardless.
---
anti-armor perk should be removed from the game completely or nerfed for 25% max. These perks are making armor non-reliable in pvp and power armor is just a joke
---
Install, restart pc, calibrate, restart pc then fo76.
---
If that does not work, goto fo76 settings and see if it has mice calibration or not.
---
If that does not work either, check the dpi settings of the mice since you have g502.
---
Also, try other usb plug for the mice. Try other mice too. If other mice works fine, then g502 is broken.
---
If the above fails, then I need to see the video so I can check how the mouse pointer actually moves. Otherwise, it is difficult for me to analyze the problem.
---
I'm still ranged, have 265 carry weight, which is usually enough for a while. If I actually over by to much, i just hop into my PA and fast travel like that ... Calibrated Shocks rule \^\^
---
Which system you on? Don't think I have a decent DCG for sale right now (xbox) but could check when I get home
---
People have been requesting repair kits since launch, pretty much. But as a QoL request, not a p2w request. I'm personally not happy about them going back on their cosmetics only statement.
---
I beg to differ, best place for this type of place would be whitesprings, it has plenty of space and places where the doors are locked, it would be easy to place the atom shop behind one of these
---
radshield is better, but you have to manage your stock
---
With surely the slowest reload in the game I think not
---
 &gt; You don't get to demand how others play
---
But you do?
---
On PC, but I appreciate it nonetheless. I'm just starting endgame. Launched my first nuke yesterday, on whitespring, so I'll end up finding something decent eventually. 
---
I realized it was time to make some changes when I hit 50 and was still using a level 5 anti-armor pistol for sniping lol
---
You can one shot everything below lvl 50 too.
---
Behavior is not a matter of level.
---
I could definitely see a Sonic Emitter type weapon that makes a sound so high frequency it stuns them and forces them to land, it’d be perfect and easy to explain. You find out it was something the Brotherhood of Steel (or maybe even the Free States) was working on prior to their extinction, but it wasn’t finished in time, you do some more questing to gather resources and stuff to build it a la most of the main questline, and then bam, you’ve got yourself one hell of a useful weapon.
---
They’d probably have to have some way to balance it though, as the ability to just instantly force a Scorchbeast to land after it takes off again would make them trivial to dispatch, especially the Queen. (Not that that’s a bad thing if you ask me, but I don’t think it’s QUITE what they’re going for...) perhaps the gun relies on an MF Breeder battery and has a cooldown or something, or the Scorchbeasts have a cooldown before they can be downed again.
---
Am I the only one who immediately thought of the old spice advert whilst reading this.   
---
"look at yourself, now back to me, now back at yourself, now back to me, what have I got in my hand, it's a camera, now I'm emoting, We're being thrown across the map..."
---
Power Armor is a must to say the least. You could use a Hazmat Suit suit but you want the armor boost so i dont recommend going into Blastzones with a hazmat especially if you are lower level. Use rad x(diluted when mutated) to get less rads, and always have a good amount of rad-away and Stims. Enemy-wise try not to be in the front if your not tanking. stay back and get your shots off. maybe on a roof or smthing. Kill the critters. those combined and schorched can deal lot of damage. 
---
Dont forget that all armor buffs are inactive once you enter a suit of Power armor. 
---
Oh and if you see a Nuke Zone try to fast travel a bit away from it. sometimes you spawn in the blast zone and you die very quick if you havent had a PA on already.
---
I'd love a luggage bot.
---
r/76market
---
Whitesprings would be a good aesthetic yes, but for a level 5 to get there without being crushed by the ghouls is a big risk! Maybe if they just made white spring free to fast travel? Then you would be in the safe done straight away.
---
I love your argument but 7.62 is practically. 308 so they could just have the handmade use that as a receiver upgrade...
---
They're generous?!?!?They're generous?!?!?Jesus Fucking Christ.I'm speechless.
---
Over 2000 lbs of legendaries 2-3*
---
I wouldn't recommend this method. I, like most out there, tend to check containers for items. If i find loot I'll assume someone didn't want it and tossed it so others can benefit from it.
---
Yes it is a bit risky for low levels to get there I agree, I remember when I first went there n it was reminiscent of a scene in a zombie movie lol, terrifying but fun
---
Compared to other games like FO76 they sure are.
---
Could be some kind of mirror reflector lens? Like the kind they used to shoot shuttle launches with...but made super tiny? But it zooms... it makes no sense.
---
Nah it's cool you can have it, I don't really see a reason for keeping it.
---
If you wanna add me my PSN is the same as my username.
---
No he didn't forget, they invaded Alaska for the oil deposits
---
Really? I thought it was shorter and fatter than 7.62 Nato (aka 308). But I'm not really a guns n' bullets guy.
---
Gross
---
Tell that my Bloodied 10% damage by aim and 15% faster critical.
---
It's my lifesaver weapon and exremly deadly when I've 250 - 375 % more damage though stealth
---
That’s what I thought how ultrarote ammo is made before I put my prime reciver on :(
---
I don’t see way they don’t make normal ammo upgrade able to ultracite
---
Wow what a unique post! Did you come up with this by yourself?
---
you are not alone

I call it "Bethesda'ing" I wrote a short story about why I call it that.

---
Errrr, yes, a AA is great, but a level 5 gun might be a tad underpowered for you at 50 ;)
---
But hey, I've been using the same TSE Gauss for 3 months now, with nothing even comparable dropping for me. So, yea, if the RNG doesnt like you, no god tier items for you ;)
---
Well it's us who got our good posts downvoted to hell for no damn reason so we pass the bad mood to other posts. Every time I have posted here, those have got like -10 and I have deleted those. Then when I'm sad considering suicide for being loser, I open reddit and see same post made by someone else and it has hundreds of upvotes so I get filled with rage and go downvote every new post and comment I see. And I'm not only one.
---
So its an exploit to make crafting the most expensive ammo in the game just a bit easier? Did you see how many materials crafting the gun takes? I really dont see the exploit here.
---
Unless you think using springs to craft ammo is somehow easier then lead and steel
---
Great to know! Any idea of the probability on the drops?
---
*stares at you in Liberty Prime*
---
I was with another guy and he eventually found one after maybe 20 times but it seems even more difficult than finding any other random spawn
---
Stay strong man! Although there are a tonne of griefers out there, there are also heaps of awesome players as well.

Ps4 user, I was able to rename it

Camera rename https://imgur.com/a/cUeM5Wn

...and it doesn't even loop properly. It just stops for a second and then awkwardly resumes from the beginning. DJ T-0dd needs to work on his beatmatching!

Might be a specific bug to them. Ps4user and i was able to rename

Yes this is the post Check out @Fallout’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1118560518082584584?s=09

Or how about getting disconnected when you're managing 5+ workshops.
---
don't spread false news, you can bau a broken camera that has no quest or nothing, just a random object
---
I like the base building part and farming the fusion cores for my laser gatling.  but its annoying that I cant run the perks I want without being handicapped in pvp. I like power armor and jump jets. I hate crouching and stealth, the entire mechanic is lost to me as long as I use voice activated coms anyway, the speaker icon gives you away even if you're quite. I like voice activated comms. ptt is horrible if your in a menu or fighting and nothing is more lame than the emote wheel spamming for communications. essentially every facet of my play style is opposite of what I would have to do to be good at pvp. so much I love about fallout 76 and they had to turn this element of it into moronic derp derp fight monkey  crap straight out of fortnight. lets not forget the stupid masks and outfits. HEY BETHESDA CAN WE GET A GIANT BONKY HAMMER TO HARVEST RESOURCES WITH? IT WILL GO GREAT WITH MY COMMIE WHACKER, MY GIANT PATRIOTIC BOBBLEHEAD MASK ,  AND LETS PLAY PA PAINT KIT! I love the game till idiots show up wearing that garbage and make my favorite perks liabilities. nothing better for my game play immersion than getting one shot in my advanced x-01 power armor by a heart emoji wielding mute wearing a bobblehead mask...using a plastic bat. so stupid. Luckily most of the time I am left alone, most of the players are pretty cool, and when the special needs crew shows up I server hop away.
---
Same for me. I even do it on multiple characters every day and still don't have the cranberry moonshine.
---
This sub is in need of a sense of humour implant, stat!
---
Can you give me a good way to farm cores? Need some badly
---
...neither have the devs. So don't worry.

Did you have to cross the border to make your attempt at crossing the boarder, and what were you crossing him with?

Well, quit spreading your bad mood. Go back to being a lurker like the rest of us. I just occasionally comment and get downvoted for giving folks general advice they don't like.
---
I was sitting on 7k before some skins and CAMP objects (always on sale time)
---
If you still need the Mascot head in about 3 hours (8am EST) I'll trade you one + 500c for an imposter body. Last piece I need.
---
I'll be on for an hour or two doing my vendors and dailies
---
They aren't pay to win, Bethesda said that if they turn out to be too good they will nerf them so they aren't pay to win.
---
Fallout 76 definitely has one of the friendliest communities I personally have ever experienced, which is why I was so shocked by this players actions. No matter though, not a single soul in this world could kill my passion for Fallout.
---
Just remember they do this in game because they are week and pathetic in real life.
---
 Look at it as a good reason to go hunting for more scrap and a challenge to improve your camp.
---
What do I need to do to ensure a spot for me to be there? I definitely wanna gamble all my caps and legendaries away.
---
That's really cool!
---
Hey can you provide some photos what it looks like in game? With armor and without. Also what about the upgrading? Which stats are affected when you upgrade it?
---
I'm down for some cores in the evening, if you will have any. Could you please respond later today, if they will be gone or not? I'm at work, so can't join the game for next 8 hours.
---
Someday, when not adding p2w items to the Atomic shop.
---
You can get BOS plans. I have gotten 2 this week.  I also had combat armor dense to drop for me on Tuesday, but it was actually for marine armor.
---
That doesn't matter, the definition of p2w says that if you have the option to pay real money for some gameplay advantage it is pay to win. That in certainly the case here.
---
If you move your CAMP everything will get repaired without cost.
---
No, actually it is not.
---
By definition sure but it's so miniscule I don't understand why people care.
---
Dam you just added me a friend and I’m over encumbered. Sorry bud
---
He’s making it public to show how it’s done so they know how  to fix it and how to replicate said bug
---
And in Vendors....
---
You can find a fan-made map, where there are different locations of fusion cores.. either in power armors or fusion generators. You can google for those, if you don't want to occupy the fusion core workshop.
---
Isn't that something Reddit as a whole should/can deal with?
---
You can’t drop a few things? They will still be there when you go back, if you choose. :)
---
Hey... yeah... what’s up with that?!
---
Yeah, this is kindda why I've been tsking a break. Just run out of things to do and the repetive grinding gets old. I feel like the o ky reason I play anymore is to keep my weapons and armor repaired and to make more ammo after doing a sales run. My stash is almost completely full, and I just have nothing to use all that junk on otherwise. I'm just slowly getting bored with it, which sucks cause I really do like the gsme.
---
I don't have very good weapons or armor cause I get so exhausted from grinding legendaries and getting crap gear, so it just discourages me from playing. I couldn't tell you how man legendary leather or wood armors I've gotten or legendary pipe weapons. After awhile, I just get frustrated and bored with it and quit. I guess I'm nit a hardcore grinder like some people. I can't bring myself to constantly so the same thing over and over and over again hoping for that one great drop. That's not me.
---
So with the updates, I just look forward to new quests and new things to do, and once player vendors hit, I'll buy my gear from others rather than bore myself to desth grinding for it.
---
I've already done pretty much everything there is to fo in the game aside from a few minor quests like those damn golfer scorched I can't ever seem to find. They really need to give us the option to abanfon quests cause that one just doesn't seem worth it.
---
Anyway, so it seems the camera thing is the only major content they added with Wild Appalachia. Once I locate a camera I suppose I'll run that quest and wait for more mounted head quests to drop.
---
Yes, joining back into server now.
---
In my pants.
---
Yes on my way thanks
---
You left the server? It'll still be there?
---
Yeah its a glitch, way I got around it was world hopping and it cleared it up and there was just the original piece I picked up in my inventory.  
---
Hope this helps.
---
Yes sir :-)
---
On my way, thanks! 😀
---
Contractions were in what, 4th grade?
---
Says loading lol but bugging out bare with me
---
Oh good! It was pretty annoying for a while; glad to hear it sorted itself out!
---
I'm hoping there is a stash chest at the vendor lol
---
I’m here can’t see you
---
I'm in the same boat. Got the email about it months ago as I filled it out about the same time. I'm guessing it'll probably be next month at the earliest.
---
I mean... Challenges are supposed to be challenging
---
Yeah that often happens to me
---
Yes. Exactly.   
---
We just crawled out after a fairly recent nuclear apocalypse. I would want a little bit more 'doom and gloom'.
---
And as a bonus, all the "goofy" things stick out so much more, since they are going to be a welcome change of scenery.
---
Glad you got it!
---
Yes! Man i really hope Bethesda adds this in the game!
---
Thanks bud that’s really good if you
---
Pay to play mechanic? Are u an idiot? I always repair my items on bench cuz it’s part of gameplay. If I forgot to do that my weapon broke in a middle of the fight. So if ure to lazy to pick up resources and repair ur gear buy a fucking repair kit. If u don’t want to buy it, it won’t change ur game at all.
---
I've done the Sheepsquath Event and the Harper's Ferry sewer dungeon. I don't use alcohol on my main, but my low level is shaping up to be an alcoholic as part of the build I'm doing with him. Hopefully with the scout quests there'll be a lot more to do. In the meantime, I'll stick to FO4 on my break from FO76 while I wait for something more worthwhile..

I vaguely recall them saying we had until May to lodge a claim, so I’d expect August-September

I advise you not to take any workshops before you well geared.  Or else this is just a way of inviting other people to Open Pvp ''Hey look guys here i am, wanna fight?", is what everyone saying if they take a workshop and everyone is freely allowed to take advantage of this invitation.
---
I was contemplating firing up the ol' tablet and doing some doodling. Might have been the nudge I needed.
---
Thanks! +karma
---
Nope I have 4
---
I have one
---
Actually I had noticed not long after I posted. I was searching atom store instead of atomic shop. It seems after reading the one from 3 days back that it was a popular idea amongst the community, and the comment from the Bethesda employee seems  promising.
---
No, he isn't. He's teaching people how to abuse the game engine. It's not dissimilar to showing how to dupe. Bethesda doesn't want people to post about it on some Reddit thread. They already have a system in place for reporting bugs and exploits.
---
Remember that ''these'' people are also part of this community. If you go around and point fingers at people, they are goin to point theirs at you too.
---
"You've gained Karma!"

😀
---
I feel those rooms in Whitesprings Hotel have a different purpose that is yet to be revealed.
---
Just spam friend requests to random people in game.  Usually some of them will agree.
---
Protip: move your CAMP ~ 1 foot. Rebuild from storage, fully repaired, for free (only costs caps to move your camp)
---
Sets a slippery slope as precedent.
---
So you’re telling me this guy posted the video with the soul point of showing is this game breaking exploit? Or having evidence of this bug so they can replicate it themselves, or he didn’t know about their big report system
---
A bit aggressive there, fella. I think there are people out there that can only play Fallout 76 an hour a day and would rather not waste their time looking for Ballistic Fibre to repair their broken left leg armour piece.
---
if you want to sell it to me: my gamer tag is : jtenhaaft on xbox one
---
line in the sand is offers a rare chance to get a plan, you can let the SAM battery deal with scorchbeasts that show up and just focus on the scorched, distant thunder seems to have a higher chance but there is an optional objective to use a recon scope to mark 6 scorched for the artillery, completing the objective seems give you a better chance of getting a plan but you do get a mix of body and mod plans, i do it every time it shows up it's not hard and also pretty quick. of the 2 distant thunder would be your best bet just carry a 10mm with a recon scope or the pearly peepers to mark the enemy and then switch to you other weapons to deal the scorched. there is also surface to air which i don't do that often but i did get a plan from it once - they are all in the cranberry bog
---
Yes it does. If people start leaving the game, eventually the playerbase will decay to the point where people who spending money on microtransactions will get bored and stop playing also.
---
Nope
---
Ill bet they wull sooner or later put same items on sale again at some point. They wouldnt put much afford to create them just to put them for a week sale.
---
He's saying 7.62x51mm and .308 are the same.
---
You could always just carry an excavator for extra 10 lbs. Allows you to make those jumps, can have a jetpack and extra weight capacity for fasttravelling if you pick up too many items.
---
They better install those mist sprayers
---
Griefers are just looser in the real world that no one likes so they take it out in a game where they can hide behind a screen
---
Ok so I can actually give you an answer to your original post. I think they are doing limited time events because we could all easily grind for Atoms and get everything. If there is a limited time sale we have to buy atoms or go without.
---
For example I have earned over 7K atoms @180 hrs of play. That's a lot of free atoms considering I've never grided for them. They were just in the course of play I wasn't trying to get them.
---
Thank hou for the explanations on the Warframe game.
---
This . I got my gold 44 second time around
---
He knows full well not to post such info on here as it breaks the rules. And you're defending him for all the wrong reasons too.
---
And like I said earlier, there is a proper way to report exploits, he just chose not to do it.
---
this gives me hope. going to try this ASAP. thank you for that psa
---
I support this request
---
Let me change it to the New Vegas orange so I can pretend I'm playing a better game. 😔
---
I didn't quite catch that, try again.
---
Also worthy to note that the diluted and undiluted versions of Rad-X and RadAway stack. I usually pop a Rad-X, diluted Rad-X and glowing blood pack before entering a blast zone.
---
I rather like the 5.56 AK.  Probably because I own one.  (Although, mine doesn't look a 200 year old rusted, rotting relic that's been welded in bad places.)  So, yeah, 5.56 makes good sense to me!  To be fair though, I've never heard of a shortage of 7.62x39, even when imports from Russia were slowed down (largest manufacturer of the garbage steel cased rounds, but keep in mind, AK's love garbage...yummy.) .  It was pretty common in southern Virginia a few years ago at least.
---
I believe you bro, I do! xD hehe, no but really though I do :P Sounds like some people suggest, some kind of artifacting happening behind the scenes. Or some elaborate easter egg lol. What did the symbol look like though, do you remember? There's several symbols all over 76 that repeat, would be nice to see if it's one of them.
---
Yeah? I’m defending for all the wrong reasons? You’re upset over no reason, he posted it here to give it traction to be fixed, how many support tickets and bug tickets go unseen? this is increasing the chances of the bug being seen by a dev or a community manger
---
I think devan posted "patch 9" in a response to a post in the patch 8 notes here on reddit.
---
The way people are hoarding stuff. Makes me wonder... will there be some sort of limiting factor? Can only gain or turn in a certain number of tokens per day, for example... Tokens can't be traded, dropped, sold or transfered between characters, perhaps...
---
While everyone else is assuming it's gonna be as easy as turning in 4000 crap legendaries and spamming the reroll button to get a bloody explosive boot in your ass gun in a few minutes, I'm thinking about ways the devs might try and prevent that exact thing from happening.
---
the new dungeon doesnt have waves its actually just like white springs
---
I was counting all things i bought and since beta i made 13000 atoms. Never bought any. Daily challenges were great when i was young haha.
---
Yes, certainly - I can't at the moment, but I'll try and remember to take a few this evening!
---
It's counted as 'Casual Underarmour' so I think the boosts are to Charisma, Intelligence and Luck - I'd have to look up the armour bonuses.
---
My main issue is that it's very 'blue-black' whereas most of the other armours are 'brown-black' so it just looks really odd.
---
Maybe with the blue shaded BoS combat armour it would look good and as was mentioned before, it's not too bad looking with the Urban Scout Enclave armour :)
---
Im planning on levelling an alt (currently 16) to 40-50 during the double weekend if I can spare the time to pick up all the weight reduction perk cards and wear some 20% weapon weight armour
---
I shall hold back any excitement, cant get disappointed if you dont get your hopes up
---
It works pretty well.  You need to have a look around to make sure nobody is near your chosen container.
---
Yes, it is a bit nerve wracking. :)
---
Watoga got hit by a double whammy. No need to go there anymore for the BOS / station vendor, plus all the nostar legendaries have gone. Plus, the robots all have higher DR compared to other mobs, while dropping ER ammo, so overall it makes little economic sense to go there.
---
Same ign, have a pretty big group on discord. Usually on after 10p (pacific time)
---
Wrong again. And stop telling me why he posted it here. I know why he did it - you won't change my mind on that with your lies.
---
What he did is bad. Telling people how to dupe/exploit is bad. Are you really that thick to understand what I'm saying? Or are you still sticking to your guns with "but the CMs will see it and act on it" bullcrap?
---
Happy to point fingers . I just don't understand pleasure of destroying something someone else cares about just because your character is stronger.
---
I wouldn't say they are community but are and always have been part of civilization. 
---
Too scared and week to play survival so pretend to be hard on adventure. 
---
Have fun and enjoy the game. I like having the risk of being killed by other players as few things in the game are powerful enough with my 161 level character but randomly destroying stuff gives no reward apart from feeling big.
---
community
---
noun
---
a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.
---
the condition of sharing or having certain attitudes and interests in common.
---
Do you have serum recipes?
---
7600 hours = 316.67 days, logged in play time, for what is it 10 atoms?!  Can they spare 'em?
---
I tend to use out of the way containers at out of the way spots, but yeah doing it at like White Springs would be pretty risky.
---
Lmao buddy, is he advocating for people to go do it? Is he telling people to do it?
---
This is so far down the list of stuf that needs fixing its not even funny.
---
He's teaching people HOW to do it. Just read the title again.
---
OP just didn't wait till camera recognized its target. I did kill alien challenge looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong ago, never killed any other than flatwood monster.
---
I would say because people farm it for outfits and ballistic fiber, so you have a lot of high levels going in there and setting the spawns high.
---
\+karma
---
Thank you very much for the useful information! There isn't enough out there for this game, unfortunately.
---
It was an unannounced add-on what did you expect? We've been asked for a different farming location they gave it to us.
---
&gt;  A LOT of people
---
Many people.
---
It's like a free ride when you've already paid.
---
It's just really annoying, I'm only trying to complete te main story quests...
---
is he telling people to use it? To abuse it? Or is he passing the information he has and observed down, if you seen to care sooooo much about how this big is reported how about you go report it the way you want to?
---
It's just because all the high levels go there to get the brotherhood plans every day by handing in the technical data so the monsters spawn to there level
---
i would say that the action hero can replace both as vampires (for me) isnt usefull because i can just use a stimpack instead
---
and two shot is better than explosive and faster firerate gives higer dps than assasins
---
Ideally you should only be using one or two guns as you not have enough perk points to cover multiple different weapon types.
---
Go check your ammo tab and sort by weight. You may have a pile of mini nukes or missile that weigh a ton. And you shouldn't be carrying around that many landmines without explosives weight reduction perks.
---
Power armor only gives you 10 strength. Once you are over that you don't get any extra bonuses to strength. So the deep pocket mods on armor don't count once you get into power armor as you take off your armor to get into power armor.
---
Check your junk tab and misc tab. You may have a lot of gunpowder or other items such as ore which isn't auto tossed into the stash.
---
If you only have 2 weapons and the stuff you said you have you should be about 180 MAX carry weight. I suggest stashing EVERY single item you have on your person from armor to ammo and just pick up one thing at a time until you find what's weighing you down.
---
If you haven't been on for months it could be phantom weight. If you clear out your entire inventory and you still have a weight problem look into this.
---
Take a workshop then just sneak and you'll vanish from the map.
---
Assuming /s?
---
Read. The. Title. Again.
---
Same. I trash anything that's over 3lbs
---
Do we know how it will actually work?
---
I've been hoarding legendaries with the idea that Bethesda is going to nerf this in some way so I will need loads of legendaries to get a decent one.
---
Yeah? What’s the content of the video? Is that saying “go abuse this” you can title a video whatever you want and have the message in the video completely different
---
I had wondered what the point was of taking a workshop... As a non PvP'er is there any point?
---
I’m not sure whatyou mean
---
I miss the nuka world hair colors from Fallout 4
---
What's the action hero's effects? I don't play survival.
---
Vamps 50cal is nice, I've got a vamps gatling laser that works great with my bloodied build. I can hover at 10% as long as I'm shooting.
---
My character is now rocking the misery look red nurse outfit and sledgehammer 👌😎
---
You're arguing for the sake of arguing. Even when you know you're wrong. Might as well talk to the wall instead
---
Lost an unnamed tse 50 cal. Fortunately I noticed before I had gone far (just grabbed it from stash, swapped cards, FT to sbq, no 50cal. Ran around the spawn point, no bag, so i dropped some junk being hopeful. 
---
When the bag appeared my 50 cal was in it. Its A TSE so should've been near the bottom of my items list. (Eg other things shouldve been dropped first)
---
Maybe but there would likely be some things that aren’t ever meant to be available. Fallout 76 mostly has copy pasted stuff from past games, mainly fallout 4 but also some things from Skyrim like scorchbeasts (reskin). I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a lot of things that are left over that they didn’t bother completely removing, but aren’t available without exploits.
---
Ghouls are some of the weakest enemies in-game, you might want to upgrade your weapons a bit... 
---
For example you can easily one-shot ghouls with level 35 lever action rifles (with the right perks) or without a specialized build but an instigating lvl 35 lever action rifle...
---
Lmao am I now? Or do you not feel the content of the video and the message behind it is more important that the title?
---
Two shot, 25%faster fire rate, 15% faster reload
---
I ment incomming arktos pharma undergorund instance
---
Nobody playing adventure mode is bragging about being griefed.
---
Yes. 100% this. I bloody miss that Assault Rifle
---
Yeah. I sold mine to a vendor already. If it didnt weigh so much id keep it as a trophy.....the challenge is fun tho
---
Yeah it sucks, but if you have a nice halfway decent build you should be able to make it work. Best thing about fighting there is all the corridors and stairs make for great choke points. Frag mines work well here.
---
There's also a lot of routes for escape through holes in the floor when thing gets hairy. Just don't get trapped in a room. I wish you luck. If you're on PS4 I could help you clear it some time
---
ohhhhhhhh
---
Most people, as it seems, still dont get that you can get killed everywhere on the map if you take a workshop. This reddit is full of (Adventure) Mode complains about that they still get killed by other players and that it kills their game experience and fun. So why not make em disappear from the map as long they took a workshop, exactly like in Survival mode :x
---
They were communists, and if you ask me complete nuclear annihilation was too nice to a nation of dirty commies
---
If you're on ps4 feel free to add me and if you need back up can always come and lend a hand even if it's repairing stuff
---
&gt; decent deathclaw gauntlet
---
why that one, its so heavy. why not a power fist or something lighter?
---
It’s a good excuse to throw Molotov cocktails around for a night.
---
Still there? Coming!
---
Great idea
---
Do you think it would be viable if for whatever reason down the road bloodied wasn't viable in certain battles?
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4. My username is (currently) POW_bros_2 if you want to friend me. Vould defiantly use the help.
---
Yup!
---
That is a tough call. 
---
I'd stick with the vamps 50 cal, personally.
---
PS4
---
Yeah and even if one person finds her the body does not seek to line up for other players. My buddy found her, then she was about 10 feet away for me. You can see the distortion. But it's difficult
---
For PC I'd craft you a set for free if you provide the materials and I'd make you a pair of Calibrated Shocks for the materials (which includes 10 violet flux) and 400 caps.
---
If you are on PC I'll come along and clear it with you
---
Ah that sucks, I’m on xbox otherwise I would have given you a hand :(
---
Did you test the action hero already? I have it and in my opinion, it's not that good. The accuracy is sooo bad. I will stick to my AAE and sell this spray gun.
---
There has to be an equivalent hotkey on console to even consider it.
---
I've got a fully tricked out recon Hardened Instigating Hunting rifle but I don't even use it anymore, just stick with my Hardened AA Lever Action now. I'll hang on to the Hunting rifle for if I ever play survival mode tho, it's probably better in some situations there 😉
---
That's my experience as well, just wanted to know it wasn't personal bias. :/ onto the mule it goes.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=grief&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=grief&amp;restrict_sr=1)
---
Have you learnt to play nice?
---
Thanks for trying tho. Appreciate it :)
---
No way Two shot is better than explosive on a heavy gun. The accuracy malus is way to big.
---
The resources. Thats my only guess.
---
Nah? I'm on PS4. Thanks anyway :)
---
"Rifle with a weight problem" sounds much like the handmade. Had to throw away a armor piercing handmade because of that.
---
Yip, correct choice. I'm glad, that the challenge was this easy and I didn't waste a lot of time on this one.
---
You can't be a ''non Pvp'er'' if you take a workshop and basically tell the world ''Hey here i am, wanna fight?''
---
That's true, but I'm sure there is. I'm sorry I can't give an example, being a PC player myself.
---
Though I'm pretty sure there is, being that once you hover over an inventory/open a container certain hotkeys are disabled. I have faith in Bethesda figuring it out :D &lt;3
---
The vendor counters from the Vault 88 DLC.
---
So what.
---
Hopefully not
---
A slippery slope to where?
---
Juicehead has it I think I remember seeing him use it in a few of his videos
---
Related question... Does the double sneak damage stack with double Instigating damage? I've never been able to figure out how that is calculated..
---
You can get the paddleball with Mr. FUZZY TOKENS at Camden Park.
---
Nope . Buy another copy and maybe try not cheating this time
---
A lot of people are filling up their mules with  legendaries  myself included. Bethesda will know this and I'm sure they will limit it hard. I'm going to guess it's something like one roll every 20 hours in line with the current vendor cap cool down.
---
Oohhh that makes so much sense. I didnt see anybody that ever had it so i just assumed it was an unreleased floor loot item.
---
Of course, fanboys didn't get what i said lol. I said that is NOT normal being already able to do ALONE 80% of the map alone. As i said i'm at level 45 (46 last night), and again, alone i have no serious problem right now, challenging monsters and questa. What i'm sayng it's just i wasn't expect so much "piece-of-cake" missions. Still have to finish the main missions but i'm near to end them tho.
---
Gave up. I can't reach the south point.
---
If anything they are oh to lose
---
Be careful you don't replace the world with people farming for leather level 1 or 5 legendaries with unyielding and become bloodied and berserker based.
---
No i read ALL terminals, audio tapes, piece of papers....i am against any form of rushing videogames...since 11 years old. Now i'm 31.
---
I have a few but I can’t be bothered mostly. He’ll be here and in the game for the rest of it’s existence soon enough.
---
Convenience
---
Two weeks of NORMAL gameplay. I have really not the time to play 24h/ day. I play 2 hours/ day more or less.
---
yeah a guide to the best events would be helpfull
---
Definitely.
---
Bethesda has failed every time so there is no reason to be excited.
---
Best argument in a healthy discussion sir.
---
I just joined this toxic community to sell items in Fallout.. i’ve managed to make good caps here but the most the people are trolls.. Most of the time I get downvoted for no reason as well. I stopped leaving my posts up cause honestly I couldnt care less about upvotes or karma.. now I only make quick posts to find someone to sell to or buy from, and once I do I just delete my posts when done.
---
It's what I do and it works
---
There’s gonna be a lot of funny salt on this page if people have hundreds of legendaries and can only turn in a handful a day.
---
Ansel Adams is a famous photographer.  Both are references to him
---
Hmm, are you sure about this? I could've sworn I've had mutations cured by Diluted, and some googling tells me it can indeed cure mutations (but maybe they've changed this?). For what it's worth I've recently been drinking Brahmin milk to be sure to keep mine and never lost a mutation from that.
---
I didn't know! Thanks for the info!
---
+karma thank you!
---
when they added the vendors and the other armor plans to whitesprings they didn't add an enclave vendor so it could just be that they overlooked adding the plans to the vendor downstairs
---
Don't bother picking the codes up after the quest line, they are not needed to launch a nuke. You can get the codes online.
---
This! And there is literally no excuse anymore to miss an item you want with them announcing what's going on sale and when. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales
---
And most things are datamined long before they get into the shop. 
---
And if you don't have enough atoms, buy new ones or do your daily/weekly challenges. You're not entitled to anything in the Atomic shop, you already have gotten what you paid for. Free atoms is a pure bonus!
---
I really enjoy the limited sales, that's why I try to keep a buffer of 1.5k atoms for special items i really want.
---
Are you still there by chance?
---
 Now we are getting closer :D Thats pretty much 20-30 hours what a normale game story will take to complete if you just follow it linearly!
---
Yeah I'm not sure but I think it was 2 month of grinding Mr FUZZY TOKENS to buy it. So yeah It is a funny weapon but needs to much time to get it
---
Yeah I’m carry a few three star melee weapons and I’ve got a few three star firearms in my stash. Only like ~10 things though so not a crazy amount
---
The typical things you ask yourself when in Toxic Valley.
---
I had a lvl 125 toon and hadn’t gotten this achievement.. had to make a 2nd toon and then got it.
---
Everyone wants that dude xD I bought this game in hope that is going to be really hard. I finished the story with lvl 28. Afterwards i found out this game is made for Casuals, what means even a 3 year old kid can play this Teddy bear filled candyland. But as soon you find some people and a community you can play with this game is getting really awesome.
---
Still hoping for more Roleplay Features and bigger servers :x
---
They were supposed to be fixing this sort of thing in the last update. They haven't done anything that I can see. Even youtubers with serious rigs are having problems.
---
Good! and I hope you have some fun while doing it.
---
Yeah, it’s prob people who played Beta before achievements unlocked. More people have crafted a gun than left the vault 😂
---
I'm wondering too.
---
My personal guess is that they will add a basic mechanic to scrap legendaries, but nothing altering the current crafting system.
---
You gain (via quest) an ability to scrap/convert your legendaries in tokens, then you can use the new legendary trader to trade the tokens for "something".
---
That was my issue
---
If you started during the beta and never made a new character you didn’t get the achievement.
---
Same. Just found it funny!
---
The delusion is real.
---
Oh it is... lol
---
i’d just be happy if i could move the tattoos on a different part of the face because i really like the anchor one but it looks dumb on the forehead
---
I dont even bother. If I find it fine, if not I can live without it.
---
You’d think the game code would award these retroactively... but you can’t expect something intuitive from 76’s code ...lol
---
Oh did they add new non-daily photo challenges? I’ll have to take a look at those
---
Oh. I thought we were talking about 762x31 vs 762x51 nato.
---
Majority of those posts are not bragging. They aren't happy about being griefed, they are complaining.
---
Yeah, when I hit level 50 I still hadn’t unlocked the achievement for level 10 😆
---
Still dealing with this glitch
---
Serendipity doesn't work In PA btw.
---
Might be a problem with your build or weapons because you should be able to kill level 62 ghouls at level 30+ fairly easily 
---
I can help you on PS4 if you’re still stuck
---
I was thinking gta 5 level P2W.
---
Then maybe this is bethys (its my cute nice name for bethesda they can have the capitalisation and the proper name back when they stop pulling this kinda stuff) way of telling you that you should be spending money of store items every day :P
---
They have said that it will show on the map while powered.
---
I can change my QoL perks like "white knight" for something useful in combat. So yes, it's definitely p2w.
---
I always assumed the atomic shop was located in whitesprings because they both play the same music
---
Same here😃
---
I like it 👍
---
Oh now i get the confusion :x Sry yeah i meant complaining! In my language bragging means somewhat the same like that.
---
I managed to get another one on a lucky break today while hopping a few times. If you still need one, my GT is Flik Triplez. I’m usually on around 4ish central time
---
Isn’t he located in a train station? All train stations have a stash chest and one crafting table each
---
PS4 fight club and no tehsandman or joecoolnyc? I call shenanigans!
---
Can you turn in data at fort defiance? I've always turned it in at camp venture.
---
To be honest I've tried this a couple times and if you want to make the borroes a worth it experience nuke it and you get crapped tons of legendary bloating ones and regular bloating ones down there. Lot of one star stuff but I got lucky and got a 3 star assassin's deathclaw gauntlet a couple days ago.   The amount of  Enemies is up there with White Springs and each time a new person enters the dungeon most of the enemies respawn so if you get there early enough it gets to be a  Continuous cycle of experience
---
I had never seen it before that update either.
---
Bethesda is going to make it so camps don’t take damage, soon.  Be advised that even now if you take a workshop you essentially activate PVP, which will enable players to damage you (and probably camp too, when they make that change).
---
Shape shifting aliens confirmed! Lol
---
The Nuka Cola plant has 3-4 cans, I think, not far from the main entrance. You may need to hit it twice.
---
Search for those board games. They should reward nuclear material when scrapped.
---
I have a pistol build. I rather like it. But it isn't nearly as powerful as my unarmed build. It is fun though
---
You can transfer items to alts using trusted traders on the market subreddits. You give them your items, they hold onto them whilst you swap characters and they trade them back to you. Of course a small cap fee is needed but it’s never really much
---
It's in the world section.
---
I am not but add me and if I find it I’ll invite!
---
Ahhh crap I got confused you can't guess that's why I got down voted
---
A ghillie suit would still look good while crouching so I would like them to start there.
---
Yes this! Please!
---
The only thing you get from forest maps is overencumbered from the crap weapons.
---
Extractors at the power plants.
---
Neat idea!  👍👍👍
---
no, I wait and check them  multiple times but still no legendary loot
---
Thanks for the info! Hopefully they’ll be easy enough to do
---
They can disappear from the map if they go sneaky way
---
I thought maybe I had missed something.
---
What’s your level? I can do it for free but I don’t have any mods to put on
---
Im level 30
---
Well, I hope it doesn't go that way. Like I said, I don't want Bloodied to be nerfed, but rather Berserker to be buffed to make it viable, considering all the disadvantages it has. Nothing more.
---
Well time to become a librarian.
---
I've gotten 3T60 jetpack plans from her over the past 5 times I've done the event  Add a bunch of mascot heads and outfits. I have not tried it since Tuesday though so I'm not sure if anything's changed in the last update
---
What time can you be on today. Anytime past 12:00 ET works for me
---
Chinese AR as a Handmade skin would be lit. I wanna relive the days of Xuanlong.
---
Dead Money's AR as an LMG skin. They are shaped quite similarly and both use 308. I suspect the LMG is inspired by the Dead Money AR to begin with.
---
Service Rifle as a Combat Rifle skin would be lit.
---
Hunting Shotgun from NV as a Pumpy skin. Dinnerbell was my favorite shotgun in NV
---
Riot Shotgun from NV as a Combat Shotgun skin, or the f3 version.
---
I'd die for the old Guass as a skin. The YCS was my main gun for many a run. Old Alien blaster as a skin seems obvious. Likewise for other weapons with direct lineage.
---
Old 10mm as a skin... This one is peculiar to me. I feel like it almost should be in already, since they brought back the 10mm smg, with a look similar to f3. And the pistol/smg in 3 were basically the same model with extra bits attached for the smg. Just remove the corresponding extra bits from the 76 model and bam. W/e I guess.
---
Yes, activate your vending machine and you shoe up on the map. Hidden as usual the rest of the time. There was some speculation whether vending machines at Whitespring may become mirrors of your CAMP vending machine. I have no idea whether that was something that may happen or just wishful thinking!
---
Like all those mobile games. No thanks
---
Jetpack mods are worth upwards of 10k as far as I know.
---
Going to the cinema soon so I’ll be gone for a couple of hours. I’ll be on most of the day after that
---
Being able to have sleeves would be cool.
---
I'm thinking many people will get a surprise or get shocked when the vendor comes. 
---
Personally I think rolling will come with a cap fee from 200-500caps, to keep it limited.
---
And i think there will be 3 different tokens, depending on each legendary effect, to keep you from spamming shitty 1 star legendaries to get to roll everything.
---
You should be able to handle ghouls. The rad damage is the problem. Grab some power armor and a 2 hander and beat them to death. Levels don't mean a whole lot in 76 and damage is equalized.
---
That's because the kill quests use the actual Alien Faction not the AlienRace Keyword. 
---
The Alien Faction includes the Flatwoods Monster and the Mothman, the AlienRace does not.
---
Yeah. It wasn't super obvious, because it didn't have a cue to tell you you were in the correct position to peek. And you could only peek *around* things like corners. You couldn't peek over things. I was really disappointed to see this wasn't implemented and improved on in FO76.
---
Rust is barebones hardcore f76
---
I do enjoy getting all of the shiny silver lockets from those maps
---
Agreed
---
Kind of like what Warframe does.
---
It's a win win for them to as giving atoms costs them nothing and it ups the player base.
---
Really you could just have a daily quest that is "Play for 2 hours" and you get misc crafting stuff
---
And a weekly challenge b that gives you 10 atoms
---
It's in the same menu area as the party poster and the sheep scwatch 8 my brother poster at the very end I believe.
---
Grefers in Adventure are just jerks that can’t cut it in survival. They’ll only engage when the fight is one sided and the people who like adventure mode are perfect soft targets because they’ve already said they don’t want to fight.
---
If you’re on PS4 I’ll be on a couple times today. I’ll give you tons of building materials.
---
Not even Survival Mode can compete with Rust. 
---
Funny Side Joke: People having fun in Rust, because of that :D
---
I think caps will be the limiting factor, probably from 200-500caps depending on charisma/hard bargin, or more. There is no good money sink in the current game, this vendor could change that.
---
If you need black titanium kill Mole Miners and scrap there breathers (I think might be filters) and you get a crap tonne
---
Nuclear materials I just get from killing lots of glowing enemies
---
Pick some up from the locked room when doing your daily Biv quests
---
That 1 was from a couple weeks back. I think I got it down at the taxidermist's office on the top floor on the wall next to the terminal. There are 5 ones that are up there
---
I only take workshops for the free travel and plans you get for claiming it lol, I dont care if someone takes it.
---
Ok. Would 1:00 work
---
You can also sort by value to make them appear on top
---
Awe, we gonna get our c.a.m.p’s smashed up good
---
He is just "too serious" :)
---
Oh Bugthesda
---
2300 pounds of 3 star items.
---
I will probably come eventually when the game is really old. But I hate the idea of missing a day, and you have to start over, but hopefully they won't take it that far.
---
I think if bloodied gets nerfed after we got herded into that by unbalanced incentives built into the game I will be FURIOUS. If anything they need to reward bloodied builds more with encounters that encourage non-PA bloodied builds, so you can use the upcoming bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Do actual adults play Rust? I was watching my nephew play and everyone he encountered sounded prepubescent.
---
Like a F2P? Sure, if they make it free to play haha.
---
There is a negative, you can’t eat fruits and veggies, remember?
---
As long you as you own the Workshop everyone can kill you anywhere on the map and destroy your camp if they know where it is :x Thats why the OP got surprised by another player and didn't know that it was his own doing that people are able to grief.
---
The ability to pick your server would cover this. Just put your stuff in a container and log out then change characters and log back in the same server and pick em up. I feel like this would be super easy for Bethesda to do.
---
What about T-51?
---
I don't think there's any jet pack for the excarvator. There is for T45, T51b, T60 and X-01 though.
---
I’m usually on 3 pm EST to midnight EST, will you be around then today?
---
They put pee pee in our coke
---
I guess it depends on the weapon. I can generally run around a nuke zone with my vampire cultist blade and stay at full health without using any stimpacks. Wish I could try a vampire .50.
---
I had a funny feeling I may have found it before but had mostly forgotten. 😅
---
Do not replicate. It can brick your game.
---
Anyone else want the Rangefinder?
---
I have this unlocked but can’t find it in build menu. Which tab is it under?
---
I’ve been holding on to so many pieces of wood armor and tire irons, you wouldn’t believe.
---
I’ve had this issue too even power armour multiplied.
---
Me and a friend set our CAMPS up close to each others. I had the CAMP there first and he moved in after and placed it down as soon as it turned green. When we logged in later on my CAMP couldn't be placed as the spot was taken. There were no other CAMPs there. It is a little bugged so make sure you can log in and keep your CAMPs before building too elaborate things.
---
And by the way... as close as you get is farmland close, not even suburbia close.
---
You're not entirely wrong though. People farm it for ballistic fiber and straight jackets (I think. . .). I'm level 39, and I'm not going anywhere near there until  level 50 (i'm cowardly).
---
I've posted a few general things on this sub, and it always goes minus straight off the bat. Why do people do that! Are their lives that sad, they have to drag everyone down with them?
---
Making a good pistol build is kind of different than other builds I've tried. There's just SO MUCH that you need in the agility tree to really make things viable. When I've worked on melee and rifle builds it's easily possible to get what you need in their respective SPECIALs without over-cramming a single stat, they have more wiggle room for play styles (imo). Good luck doing that with pistols, especially if you ever hoped to sneak.
---
How much are mounted wolf head plans worth?
---
Guess I've just been lucky, only been killed by someone once, figure if someone hunts me down to kill me because of a workshop they must be pretty bored, I'll just respawn and go on.
---
I'm not sure if they're worth that much because I think you get them from that quest line so everyone who has done it ends up with that plan. Could be wrong though because I've never seen it any other way or drop anywhere else.
---
It's in the files but not in any leveled lists which means it's not obtainable except maybe from the dev room.
---

---
Use bloodied melee weapon/sniper rifle on a trap placed on indestructible object (like floor). Hit it while standing on it. If placed right, the forces are calculated such way that you are being thrown in the air yourself. Longest flight distance we achieved that way was around the nuke blast radius.
---
Do you really gotta ask how much a plan that is VERY easily accessible is worth?...
---
Did you plan on getting rich off of it?
---
Nuka Plant has a lot of nuclear material laying around
---
Just keep checking the enclave. I've gotten it a clue times. Those damn calibrated shocks though...no chance
---
They removed the being able to see someones inventory without accepting a trade.
---
One of the issues I love implemented and will miss when fixed.
---
Thanks, but if my base is being attacked I'd rather be cowering inside, keeping my turrets repaired as best I can, not running around trying to scrap my plants.
---
Is the death one out yet?
---
Absolutely!
---
My favorite is the wendigo so far.  I put it in people's camps hidden away then wait for them to freak out lol
---
You are a troll. Change my mind.
---
See I stay in low level zones so my turrets have no issue I see where you're coming from sorry
---
Fusion cores and plans
---
They don’t impact PvP at all.
---
They also generally suck. 100 percent and 150 percent don’t compare to the 200 you can get without.
---
Lol that’s pretty dramatic! I’m just talking about my princess bed!
---
Check for "my bucket list".
---
best glitch in game.......
---
That's a thing already 👍 they did it a few weeks ago
---
What am I missing about the camera? It's a feature we already have except with greater restrictions? What's the point?
---
We have plenty of buttons which are not used when looting this can be done
---
It’s just a bed! Not the whole game! *stamps foot like petulant child*
---
You've not been on this sub since the patch huh?
---
me after legendary vendor: [I expect nothing and I'm still let down](http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sad-Deweys-Low-Expectations-Are-Never-Met-On-Malcolm-In-The-Middle-Gif.gif)
---
I think you can scrap the crappy ones for plastic
---
I fourth this.
---
At least there will be a max of like 25 people to get through
---
Its pretty fun to walk around with it in your hand snapping away, also its a lot easier to snap enemies and action shots because you can get to it alot quicker
---
Exactly, only worse--they've been giving us dailies for the camera/film since before we could find the corpse!
---
Legit Mind-blown as a European!
---
Guess not for Excavator. Maybe the other one you mentioned then
---
Not true. It can crash your game, put you in an infinite loading screen, stutter tremendously, and even kill you, but it cannot brick your game (as in make it completely unplayable). I saw this false information spread yesterday and it’s simply not true. But do be careful with it. It can be used strategically if you know what you’re doing.
---
I just hope they do the right thing and only allow Legendary trade ins on items found AFTER the patch.  Pretty much every single developer does this when they introduce similar systems in live games, Bethesda should follow suit.
---
I couldn't craft the poster for the Nuka Shine quest until I'd already started the quest, even though I'd picked it up from the Atom shop.
---
Your guess, though incorrect, makes more sense than what Beth did.
---
While you’re doing it you might as well craft a total of 76 Molotov’s for the other challenge.. gets you another 40 atoms
---
If you add hydraulics to both arms on the  excavator  you get 4 from every ore :)
---
And Ultracite is not a ore, it's a vain isn't it ?
---
Did you use the flash fermenter in the basement by Bev? Not sure it's required, but during that quest is the only time you can use it.
---
Wait where is it? I've looked in the basement and Haven't found anything
---
It's not technically difficult, they just need to store a reference to your current server locally, then have that option to connect to that server on the main menu
---
Once you pick up the camera on one, you'll only find the holotape on the other.
---
&gt;I'm just not a fucking sheep. I don't regurgitate the popular opinion.
---
you are and you are doing it .
---
"Real talk" sounds like "give me an answer to appease my inner *communist*."
---
I must have played on a jacked up server or 76 on PC is messed up. Just killed her 3 times on the same server and she dropped 0 repair kits for me. Or Stable fluxes. I got some nice plans though.
---
A food tab and a drink tab.Amen.
---
I liked it because it was so easy to do: just collect all the weapons and materials needed in adventure mode, reload into survival, scrap and craft, done.
---
I have done the previous challenge as well, and both of these have certainly taught me more about the mechanics of navigating survival mode than I would have otherwise learned, because I don't like PvP.
---
I’ve traded one bullet for 1000 caps once. 
---
A random note (not a plan, just a price of paper) for 1000 caps. 
---
And once 8 purified waters for 250 caps each (2k caps in total)
---
The bullet was for building someone’s camp, and the others because I gave them lots of plans they wanted first.
---
what system do you play on?. 
---
i would love to take a look at your invertory if selling is the goal.
---
Guess I'll start a new on survival and just play all sneaky beaky like
---
I think Bethesda is ruining caps economy by allowing or not limiting value of items to be sold more than the robot vendors caps prices.
---
I had the same thing happen with my x-01 last night. We were doing uranium fever. It said the server wasn't responding and disconnected me. When I came back in all my power armor parts were doubled. Didn't affect anything else just my power armor.
---
As long as it wasn't shoved down our throats
---
Now who’s making assumptions. 
---
That being said, just because people complain about something on this sub doesn’t mean that there’s any truth to it. Remember the amount of people whining about their weapons being stolen during trades? How about people absolutely convinced that you could be one shot through slap damage?  Point is, people would often rather complain than stop and think for a moment.
---
They occasionally spawn outside the gate to the Service entrance at WS.
---
My level 70 sneaky sniper laughs at this. Yesterday a survival player I encountered several times before had a chat with me. I've seen his inventory. He never traded, and was only using items he looted himself. His rifle was mutant slayers limbdamage handmade. All his gear was pretty much PoS by my standards. Before I had a chance to see his equipment, I fought him on several different occasions. I respected him as an worthy enemy. Seeing his output and his gear, it makes all the "oh nah gad op duped level milion guys" laughable, IMO.
---
In my stash I have two cavalier sets, sentinel set, weightless sentinel set, unyielding sentinel set, and some random spares. I don't use them on my main PvP character. The items I selected for myself are cheap, I completed the set recently for &lt;20k caps. The main advantage comes from knowledge, not level, not gear.
---
:O I didn't know that! Thank you!! And ultracite is also ore, there's ore veins around fissure sites and in the glassed caverns
---
Its in bevs room, on the same wall as the door you enter on. Right around the middle of that counter. I think its sparks it has some sort of animation.
---
I don't want to use it, thank you. Not taking my chances.
---
They *broke it* a few weeks ago
---
The door that's locked? I have the codes but I won't open.
---
Poor delivery you shouldn't teach people how to use the exploit. But it's important this gets fixed
---
The other door. The entrance. Go down the three stairs to have main area that bev hangs out in and its on the left wall.
---
I'll check it out when I get back on thanks
---
No problem, you don’t have to. I’ve been using it non stop to test different things about it and can guarantee you I’ve not had any long lasting problems. I’ll continue testing, for science, and will post if anything truly terrible happens.
---
I am very excited to see death. I am curious about what these are leading up to, if anything. Seems anticlimactic if they are just being released arbitrarily.
---
Most likely there will be a limit as to how many weapons you can turn in over a 20 hour period.  To top that off, you will need to find the Legendary Vendor since Beth said he will be "elusive". Data mining dug up that other day indicates the Legendary Vendor will appear at 9 different locations throughout Appalachia.
---
Hope it helps.
---
I've been saving every 2 and 3 star lol I'm going to have to start another mule
---
Where's a good place to find these weapons so I can start farming mods?
---
Well it was a thing then it was broke then it was fixed again recently but I haven't been on since Saturday so idk if it's been broken since this new patch or not but I do know for sure it was working last weekend lol 🤷‍♂️ who knows they rebreak fixed things constantly
---
I hate to digress, but aren't some of the daily challenges already something like a free login bonus? Like for example the 'Drink one alcoholic beverage while being level 21 or above'. And then we have our daily allowance of 1400 caps from vendors that we forfeit if we miss a day.
---
I actually prefer that these daily bonuses require us to DO something in game in order to claim them, but that might just be me.
---
both similar guns, it really could be either, probably both, but the barrel of the Lewis gun is nearly identical, so you really can't say "not the Lewis" cos it clearly is...
---
I was actually thinking about this 2days ago
---
https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy
---
So like 3 rifles?
---
:3
---
I do alot of trades I think about it constantly lol it's kinda sketchy sometimes
---
What's the secret there?  I tried 10mm gun but it just didn't seem to do much damage...I chalked it up to the ammo...maybe it was the gun's fault.
---
It should
---
Yup.
---
thanks i needed to kill one for a challenge
---
Maybe the sheepsquatch is invisible and is actually in all those photos.
---
WooOOooOo spooky!
---
It's not a gaurenteed spawn but 1 out of 5 times they'll be there
---
I've noticed that if you kill it while its invisible it doesnt show on the ground until it turns to a metal pile
---
They also invated Mama Dolces! The indignity!
---
50 caps that someone gave me for canned coffee.
---
I've given up on trading since 1) only 23 others on a server 2) two thirds are higher level so don't want what I have 3) trading interface is cumbersome, 4) communication for even trying to find potential buyers is terrible.
---
ah, well I know I have been experiencing it as I described, either way submit a ticket
---
Sometimes I still do. You can carry a lot of PAs before you can't even jog anymore and the card reducing PA weight works on frames too.
---
yeah, works very good, 1 small run on my alu run gave me 174 alu, lol  (with super duper)
---
Oh wow haha that's awesome. Definitely gonna get the bracers today!
---
PSA Using a family account on PS4 you can have way more.
---
Somebody wake up Hicks!
---
I picked up 60+ from the burrows.
---
i came across the body of one there once but that was during nuke zone so wasn't sure if it was a nuke only thing
---
My biggest cap trade was 42k, for a van/sent marine chest. Then 19k, TSE 50 cal, and quad explosive double barrel, for a van/sent arm
---
I guess it's just an immersion thing, although honestly it's actually faster (on pc) to use the full camera mode. (Just hit ESC -&gt; T) and it's open immediately.
---
No nuke needed. It's a regular enemy spawn
---
cheers
---
I've had the invisible/unfindable corpse issues pre and post this latest patch. Try waiting around to see if it will turn into a metal pile, as the other person said.
---
That's too much. Should be about 1500 I think
---
Because that isn't true. With most gear without gunsmith5 a gun will last plenty long enough in survival to put you into the lead
---
Yeah that would be cool :x
---
Im on xbox lol so it takes me ages
---
Yes they literally said they were going to be adding in a fridge you can buy for your camp to slow spoilage. Do you even know what you are talking about?!?
---
Got it, only do it 2-3 times... for science...
---
Really? Yesterday I put that offer up some guy responded with “I don’t think duper’s sell them that cheaply”
---
I'm still amazed the didn't test this. Yeah I know Bugthesda but still
---
They should just add a **trial period** for purchases in the Atomic Shop: After buying a camp decoration, skin or outfit, it would become usable/wearable for an hour (or 30 minutes, whatever). If you don't like it, you would go to the item page in the shop and simply hit the refund button to get your Atoms back.
---
Boom. No muss, no fuss, no questions asked*.
---
Skins would revert to their defaults, everything else would just disappear after the trial. And since purchases in the Atomic Shop can neither be traded nor dropped, I don't see any significant potential for abuse.
---
* If BGS were clever, they actually would add a small survey to ascertain which items get refunded and why - and thus have access to reliable first-hand feedback as to what kind of content people would like to see more often or less often. That's a win-win situation if I've ever seen one!
---
That's the whole point.   
---
In the Fallout timeline, we didn't invent transistors following world war 2, and we were more open to experimenting with atomic energy. So the big result was that the miniaturization of technology took a long time to catch on and the world burned through it's resources at a faster pace. Eventually this led to conflict over the last remaining oil deposits with China and...war were declared.   
---
That's it. And that's all you need really. War over key resources is not a new thing and it's not a rare concept. There are a lot of real life examples of it. I think that the original developers went with that being the reason the world went to war because it's so mundane and realistic a reason. It wasn't because one nation was more evil than any others or someone wanted to rule the world.   
---
It's like the intro to Fallout 2 says:  
---
"*War. War never changes.*
---
*The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many* [*humans*](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Human)*, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones."*
---
yeah i never go back to play responder events like feed the people, but some better rewards would bring people back to those events, right now the responders feel like a low level faction and get ignored by most people by level 20
---
I paid 200 caps each for some serums I haven't started heavy trading yet.
---
I had this happen to my only turret. The wire was still there but no turret. After trying the repair all and finding everything ok I built another missile turret and then it clearly stated that I had no turrets and after I built it I had on. It had just disappeared. I only hope it doesn't still take up budget.
---
I actually used to see them fairly frequently when my camp was on the back of the harpers bridge. Maybe that's a hot spot.
---
Two 15k trades for TSE Combat Shotgun and TSE Handmade
---
I'm still interested if you would like to sell it.
---
1) and 4) are easily solved by trading on reddit. Plenty potential traders, and you can discuss everything here via messages or comments.
---
Also, once you get a high enough level and start killing Legendaries with 3\*, the level difference woun't play an important role.
---
I can craft it and I know every mod for leather armor.
---
Yeah, that is a bug and going to be patched. The patch notes said it would be a rare drop, 3 a kill isn't a rare drop.
---
it work for flux and the new camera film
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one. It would take too much effort for me to make room in my stash. I’ll wait until he comes out then take stuff over as I get it. Besides, I’m not going to sit in line while people trade 2000 pounds worth.
---
I have filed reports for this and they claim they are unable to remove the extra key and holotapes from our accounts! But yet they can remove any items they wish from people that duped items...so scratch your head on that one for a little bit. My misc tab is so full of extra keys, key cards, and other items that are not able to be dropped. Thankfully they have no weight but it clutters the PipBoy screen when I have to search through that tab.
---
Seems you've not been playing survival, these repair kits are being used quite heavily to avoid uncrouching to repair.
---
I'll buy bullets off low levels for 1K caps just to give them a little spending dough. Early in the game that's a lot of caps.
---
Amber pop boy text reporting in
---
You can't show them in your CAMP, they can't be dropped.
---
Are you spamming reload during a separate animation action? It could be similar to how you can collect water while drinking.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It's a win win for them to as giving atoms costs them nothing and it ups the player base.
---
 I do not believe that statement is correct since Atom's are a form of currency.
---
 Them giving away free atoms is like giving away free money and the way BGS has been playing their hand lately I do not believe this will ever happen.
---
yeah, same thing happen'd to me, think there is a new bug, all "bigger" bosses i have killed does the same.
---
Had a mothman attack me in camp last night, same thing, killed it, it flapped into the air, landed in an ash pile and disaperad...
---
Killed the imposter, same thing, just vanished into the ground.
---
Killed a ledg. super mutant in watoga, same again, went into the ground, this has never happen'd to me before patch 8.5, played since first hour of beta :(
---
5 million caps?  Sold!  Lol.
---
Fallout Tactics is going to be your best bet there then.   
---
As far as we could tell from it, the Enclave was non-existant or not active in the midwest in the 200 years after the war.  
---
The main issue there was Vault 0, a massive automated vault meant to be used to rebuild using an army of robots controlled by a supercomputer, went crazy and started destroying settlements until the midwest brotherhood stopped it. Even then, they only won by sacrificing their codes and starting to recruit wholesale from nearby settlements for soldiers. So you got human, ghoul and even super mutant (west coast intelligent FEV strain) brotherhood soldiers.   
---
I always got the feeling that if the Enclave was active in the region, they would have either been in Vault 0, or would have been destroyed by it.
---
25k for tse tesla
---
&gt; I could buy a stack of repair kits and move any durability perks into more pvp ones. Id never have to worry about repairs so I wouldn’t need them. Just buy kits when shit breaks. I dont like that.
---
BINGO, not only that but people in PVP are using them also just because it allowed them also to repair without uncrouching, unlike a workbench they have to uncrouch to use and show up on the map to be hunted.
---
Crazy
---
Why is it not the same cryo??
---
27per with ammo smith...
---
Jus got an explosive Tesla last night
---
Well played, sir.
---
I've had this happen several times over the course of the games life. Not sure what triggers it to do it though.
---
*slow clap*
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Two completely different triggers for that quest vs the picture quest. There is literally no way to complete this alien picture quest.
---
Around 200lb of 3-star legendaries... poor stash... poor me trying to manage weight somehow until player vending and legendary vendor
---
watching, waiting
---
My favorite method would be base vending, but also you use your terminal to send a protection trader to a location.
---
I got one, thanks!
---
Yeah, the challenge is another impossible one.
---
I was about to buy it hoping it was exactly that; then I decided to search this sub to find out first. Thank you for this thread.
---
Still broke
---
Thanks for mentioning this, I didn’t even think of that!
---
They aren't in the game yet, so another impossible challenge for atoms.
---
As far as I remember there is already a stash inside if you sneak peak inside through the window cracks.
---
My stash is basically 2/3 of legendaries waiting for a vendor to turn them into tokens.
---
right now?
---
Even if they don't want to bother with body ones...let me move/toggle it to the neck or something :(
---
They have some that go one the neck, but most are weird face-exclusive tattoos and just look out of place.
---
Few minutes ago
---
Nope, tested it without PA and waited for the nametag to pop up in the view finder. None of the aliens work for this challenge. Someone already datamined what it was looking for, it is specifically looking for Zetans, which aren't in the game...
---
There are no Zetans in the game, already datamined to check. So the fact this challenge requires Zetans makes this weekly impossible.
---
are you still on that world?
---
Yeah, the combat challenge is only looking for any creature with the "alienrace" tag. While this picture challenge is looking only for "zetans" which aren't in fo76 yet, and the soonest they could be added would be next week at the patch, which means this weekly is impossible.
---
I think so
---
*BOZAR! BOZAR! BOZAR! BOZAR!*
---
Probably cost like 1000 atoms if it did.
---
It works for basicly everything except making bulk junk and quest items
---
my psn is moshitout can you add me and direct me to it?
---
If you go to a in game vendor you can by repair kits for caps! They’re called bulk junk ;)
---
Wavy Willards
---
If Bethesda left all the idea work and prioritising to us and just did the actual work, the game would be so much better off. Literally. *Literally.*
---
Well, the flatwoods monster look pretty much like a Zetan to me. Im sure they will add more of them in the future, I mean im not sure why they would have referenced West Virginia and Vault 76 in Mothership Zeta so much if there were no Zetans in that place, or none of them even watching WV from space.
---
Hey no sharing secrets haha
---
thanks homie
---
And a violet brahmen for some Milka ^^ but only as a easter Event or something.
---
Np I hope he's still there
---
How about letting us use normal ammo on Prime receiver.
---
You would need Prime receiver to be able to use the ultracite ammo, but you could also use normal ammo in it which would do normal damage.
---
It's the same ammo type and only difference is the uranium head, sorry, ultracite head in it.
---
The hunting rifle badly needs a .50 reciever that ups the damage late game.
---
Awesome thanks all for the responses.
---
Fair point! However I don't think you can get every piece of repair items you need for power armor n stuff.
---
Sorry, I zoned out at best fallout ever
---
They do it so we spend money. It makes sense to me the best items limited time and no say whether or not they will be available later because some people will buy atoms so they don’t miss out. Unfortunately those are the people that keep this kind of behaviour happening.
---
How do you transfer the loot?
---
This challenge is impossible, just like they were last week. This challenge requires "Zetan" for it to count, there are no creatures with that tag in the game. So it is literally yet another impossible challenges.
---
It is impossible to complete, it requires the "Zetan" tag which isn't in the game yet.
---
i been praying to godtodd for this for a long time
---
I won’t be back online until ~ 9pm Pacific time, and then only for an hour or two. Friday I’ll be online earlier and later. I still have about 50 cores; I’m giving away 10-15 at a timr
---
What is places your troop leader visits Alex....
---
YES!! Awesome idea!!!
---
You're really making a post whining about getting downvotes....wow....
---
It isn't, they datamined exactly what this challenge requires. It requires a "Zetan" tag, which isn't in the game yet. So this is just another impossible challenge they put in.
---
Good pickup! They're close enough for me though... 😁
---
I still don't understand why this camera is a thing. We can already take pictures in game. They're no different.
---
...and Glowing Blood Packs for +75 Rad resist does not affect Mutations either (does not suppress)
---
Well alright, then I owe you one. Sent you a request. I'll be on probably around 4-4:30 PM EST.
---
Get the fusion generator plans (or fully “power up” a power plant), take the workshop at a power plant, build a fusion generator, power up the fusion core resource generator. About 8 100% cores an hour.
---
&gt;the emitter’s high pitched noise sound effect could just straight up be the actual Dragonrend shout voice clip sped up like 3X.
---
That is actually a really cool idea I hope a dev reads that, it would be totally do-able too so funny
---
Yeah, I even tried to photo the interloper in lucky hole, on the off chance...
---
Yeah, they will add them later, that has already been datamined as well. The problem is they currently aren't in the game and the earliest they could be added in would be next weeks patch, which would mean this challenge is literally impossible to complete.
---
for challenges it is FAR easier than bringing up photo mode...
---
I’m preparing to be completely underwhelmed.  Hope for the best but expect the worst.  Why expect anything differently? 
---
The game froze up on me twice this morning in 30 minutes of play.  Once while I was in the middle of farming ghouls at Whitespring.  Fix that shit before rolling anything else out!!!!
---
I’ll be on about 9pm Pacific time, for an hour or two. I’ve still got cores.
---
I 13th this! Brilliant idea!
---
Loooool and I can get back to trollin' people stayin afk while trading woth the vendor.Perfect!
---
Bullet pen, on a sneak sniper built. The 308 wins out of everything you guys discussed  in pvp.
---
Or the legendary choices end up in the atom shop!   That would be hilarious
---
Maybe, it's you?
---
The datamining has shown this challenge requires "Zetan" tag, not "alienRace" which is what all the aliens are in the game so far. This is just another one of their impossible challenges they put in so people can't earn atoms and have to buy them.
---
Yeah confusing as hell I was totally looking forward to using that against  them as a reward for that quest
---
Hoarding legendaries was the sole reason I created a mule account
---
Because [this guy  in the comments ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh3a6i/bethesda_please_let_use_inspect_items_when/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) even says that his stuff is being downvoted to a lot recently over here
---
Really? You need film, a camera and a zoom lens. You can do that all in photo mode for no resources.
---
How does it break?
---
Me too! I have had them all last week, and I’m almost a level 70. I don’t stand a chance against a 152! They are horrible, and I have been playing the franchise for years, and now I feel heartbroken because of it. I even get killed for not wanting to be in parties, I’m an older player, this co op with people I don’t know isn’t my thing. I feel as of right now that Fallout needs to change or these people are going to entirely destroy the franchise. If you’re on Xbox and need some help, I’ll be happy to help you too.
---
We can’t let these griefers ruin relaxation time!
---
I M M E R S I O N
---
Nah, most of it is melee and light armor pieces.
---
Most modders even say "IF YOU WANT TO ADD THIS TO BASE GAME BETH GO FOR IT" in their liscense. They literally have the creators legal blessing.
---
true i have a super sledge that deals like 350 damage
---
Yeah we experience server instability on PC as well. Extreme load times on occasion. Server crash sometimes as well. It happens less than it did at launch but still pops up.  
---
I don't think they test this well before launching a patch. It works internally so they just launch and fix the bugs as they can.
---
Yes the process of taking pictures for challenges is FAR easier.......................
---
FO76's multiplayer came from a fucking mod. Look up fallout 4 together.
---
I thought so too but you don't gain diseases from shooting stuff, the Responders even say melee is last resort against scorched and other enemies. Melee doesn't need a nerf. Diseases and other cons of using melee need a buff
---
Wholesome bro!!
---
😂
---
The community people have mentioned a couple times that they will be soon:tm:
---
Bone shards. 
---
I don't use cultist weapons or chimes, so they're useless to me at least.
---
Yes. That will definitely happen when they change it so CAMPs can't be destroyed in adventure mode in the same update as vending machines.
---
The brainfungus soup is great this time of the year
---
A couple of times ( and today ) after the SS was killed and the event ended , I could not find the body so no loot.
---
It's hard to find anything on the ground at that ambush site.
---
So this must be another bug to add to the list.
---
Just because you don't like a feature it doesn't mean nobody likes it. I'm sure there are lots of people loving the camera and nah i'm not one of them.
---
Did I say power armor and spring board trap, I meant no armor and a flamethrower, you should see yourself fly with that bad boy
---
Did I say power armor? I meant no armor and a flamethrower, you should see how you fly with that thing
---
This is why I wear a mining hat at night. I hate the green light.
---
Is that all they're used in?  
---
I've been keeping my stash at 50 scrap bones for no other reason than it's a nice even number...
---
Guns are still better despite the damage output of melee because ranged is better in general. Melee takes more damage than ranged in general. The only downside is cost of ammo.
---
They literally had ammo selling in the beta. What are you talking about? What has defelated the value of caps is the 25k limit which you can fill up on in like a week selling crafted hats that take 10 minutes to farm.
---
I like this idea. More practical, but I'd still love a robot run museum or art gallery with everything neatly displayed. The good thing about a trial is you can see if it works too!
---
Gold, silver, asbestos, antiseptic all seem to be rarely used. Also I find keeping most resources at 150 works well, I do it for most resources except, lead, steel, cloth, acid and plastic.
---
We are all entitled to an opinion and I don't care about story or npcs I care about playing with friends and then droping a nuke on them. Thanks for your feedback.
---
It is crazy, and since its rarely used no one collects the ammo. So when I try to buy some there's like none available or just really small amounts
---
Military grade duct tape also has Ballistic fiber in it.
---
After we had camera related challenges for a week before we could do them I was pretty excited to start them. It ended up taking me three hours and hundreds of caps just to find one, and it's a crappier version of the existing system with limited zoom and lenses and has caused way more bugs and crashes for me. Not impressed that this was delayed and released in this shape.
---
I have but I've been selective in holding back items which may also be attractive trades for just being unusual or weapons that would improve with a good re-roll I'll put up for trade later as they'd be pretty nice with improvements. I'm not going to spam it as it's going to be a busy vendor and I have weapons that I want to hang on for a re-roll to hold on for myself.
---
As, so you were never a fan of what made the Fallout games good in the first place. Got ya.
---
I was looking at my stuff. I have exactly 8 legendaries. Only two are in storage. And they are shitty so I wouldn’t get much for them. Anyone want a two shot lvl 15 grenade rifle?
---
Totally, my melee character is always getting some disease I'm addicted to antibiotics and disease cures. Depending on your perks radiation damage can be an issue too as glowing enemies plus a variety of ghouls give it off.
---
Hell bro if your a pvp player you should of already switched to AA over Bloodied. If your a pve char and bloodied gets hit badly, and it’ll need to be hit badly, I’d recommend having both a furios Fire rate gun  for tougher enemies and bosses, and a explosive gun, I’d probably suggest trying to get a double or quad if they exist otherwise TSE are still viable in pve
---
I almost wish if you were in passive mode or whatever the camp couldn't get damaged. I get NCPs but some ass hat that's bored shouldn't be able to just mess with shit, shit that people don't want messed with. I mean if you have the settings on you should get no damage anywhere unless initiated, then it's fair game.
---
I just think it's fucking idiotic to spend time working on a camp then a tool comes along and ruins it because his mama yelled in the room and told him he had 15 minutes left.
---
Sure that guy could have been just trying to troll. That ain’t always the case however. I gotta story to tell and it begins by observjnv the following fact:
---
Put simply, attacking and killing high level players who own workshops is hands down the quickest and most efficient way to make caps in this game. 
---
Over in Survivor, I have to kill a 200 level player 4 sepearate times to make 200 caps. In adventure, I can make that in two bullets. The solution is simple however - don’t claim workshops unless you are ready to pvp. 
---
Nowadays, in my endgame when I’m bored, I’ll simply go on adventure and try to claim every single workshop, looking for pvp. I am level 150 and don’t stash my caps on a mule, meaning, you are welcome to try to kill me and claim them caps. 
---
I’ve had some truly epic pvp moments on adventure. My best was making 2000 caps in about 15 minutes. I contested a workshop owned by a lvl 160 and killed him a few times before he called his other 3 high level friends over. I was tired of getting killed at my own shops and after my little bro was killed at a workshop repeatedly one day, I said goodbye to my gunslinger build and respecced into a PvP based stealth sniper. Meaning, I can hold my own. Anyway, this level 160 has his 3 friends all trying to get me to leave the shop but my chameleon ass doesn’t let anyone get close enough, shooting them guys down with my Sole Survivor as they speed demon marsupial bird bones their way towards me. 
---
This lasts for 15 minutes, I’m getting 5 kills for their teams every 1, and I look down at my caps and notice I have gained around 2000.
---
Do you know of a better and easier way to make caps?
---
Bethesda has said this? Well I'm glad to hear it. Better sooner than later imo
---
You don't play Fallout for the challenges.  
---
You play it because it is your duty to rebuild America and make it great again.
---
yeah i pulled it from the body the first time but it wasn’t in my inventory to start the actual quest. was helping a friend find one last night then just got the note from that body. thank you. it’s a fun little mission.
---
9 photos of robots,cryptids,and other bs vs 5 pics of red rockets and than other great challenges that have nothing to do with pics. Ill take the latter
---
You have traders that still want caps?!? I'm a trader and completely maxed on caps on all my characters. Crazy you still can find traders who want caps.
---
I want tattoos. Seriously I'd run around naked.
---
When people make a post, sometimes they’ll downvote all other posts in new surrounding there’s so it’s seen first
---
IMHO The scorchbeast out front (line in the sand) is more difficult/tedious than the ghouls inside. 
---
@40, you should be able to deal with the 62s w/o issue, especially with the right weapon.  (I melee them).
---
Power Armor helps.
---
Have you done a nuke zone run?  If so, the same weapon you used there to take out the glowing ones will do a good job on the charred.
---
Something similar to NV's ammo mechanics, different ammo types do different damage/degradation to the gun?
---
That's not a bad idea.
---
ESO does the daily log in rewards. If you miss a day or start in the middle of the month it just locks you out of the X amount of days you miss at the end of the calendar. Its a neat way to get little extra things, but it does suck to miss the bigger end of the month gifts :'\]
---
I run a Bloodied build, my power fist do 800dmg per hit and I don't have any Melee Perks lol
---
I downvote every post about repair kits (doesn’t matter which opinion), every “been away 2 months, whats new” post and every “To the player that...” post. Since 3/4 of all new posts have one of the mentioned topics, I currently downvote a lot.
---
For science!
---
Cause - Thor's hammer hammers!
---
Lol first thing I noticed too, I was triggered
---
4 y/o, Fallout 1 demo xD
---
The spoilage issue isn't about food, it is about end game mats such as fluxes which will spoil in roughly an hour after picking. Making it impossible to farm them and keep them for long periods of time. With the fridge that won't be the case.
---
The fact you are only talking about food shows you either aren't very far into the game or you are being disingenuous with your defense of this multi million dollar company.
---
Yeah, all the time. Not every trader, but there are lots of traders who srent caps maxed, and being caps maxed isn't a permanent condition.
---
I’m hoping that the future plans for faction stuff will give us more of an opportunity to really pick a faction and pursue it. We all kinda end up joining all the factions over the course of the main quest, and we can choose to roleplay as one if we want, but one of mine would absolutely be a Responder (if the Order of Mysteries wasn’t an option) but there’s just nothing there. You do the training quests and you move on.
---
Too bad they still have impossible challenges up right now.
---
At some point it will end up being like this, don't worry. I can't wait for the day when logging into Fallout will grant me 1500 Alliance points!
---
I would hold onto it. Who knows, maybe one day pistols will get buffed out of mediocrity. I'm hanging onto a quad revolver and crossing my fingers.
---
Would be cool if it was like an arena. Have a crowd watching. Like on escape from New York type stuff.
---
Wasn't found in a fusion generator was it? Let me guess Static object in the game is how you found it?
---
That's what I do.
---
It's just reddit... Every post in every sub gets downvotes. Most of them are probably bots. Don't pay attention to the votes.
---
But not the challenges they are worse and force server hopping like a mad man,id rather go into photo mode 100 times than server hop 20 times looking for a megasloth
---
Fair enough, but still also very rare. I switch to a power armor build weeks ago, dont even have body armor on my character anymore. In weeks of playing hours per day, I have accumulated... 26 ballistic fiber and basically several hundred or even thousands of everything else, including adhesive, screws, gears, and springs.
---
CHEESE! FOR EVERYONE!
---
They could just use the codes from the mod that literally does that, the mod creator even gave them their blessing to use it in the base game.
---
Hopefully you will be able to port to it. Can't wait to put my vending machine right in the middle of a extremely high radioactive zone!
---
It is a pistol. I've tested that much. You won't find much information about the salvaged assaultron head since it's been bugged multiple-ways up until recently. The quad legendary affix is nuts.
---
They could have done anything else to provide IMMERSION
---
The night in early December when I came out of the vault a newborn wastelander, and level 267 greeted me with a blast from an automatic weapon at my feet.
---
I started to bolt and then realized they’d dropped a bag full of goodies including BOS under armor and some weapons that were above my level, but not too far. They sent me a team invite and we were off.
---
That was a nice gesture, but then the player proceeded to fast run me through a bunch of hot spots letting me get hits in while they killed higher level mobs and I leveled to 10 in about 90 minutes.
---
One more gift bag of stims and some level 10 stuff and they waved goodbye. Wherever you are random high level, you got me off to a fast start and I really, REALLY appreciated it.
---
There really are some great people out there in the wasteland.
---
Right? :D Awesome! &lt;3
---
Sweet, that oughta shut some people up then :) cheers!
---
I honestly don't understand how anyone could say this is the best fallout ever, I mean I really like it but it's not even in the same realm as New Vegas or 3 or 4. Your opinion is yours and all but WTF?
---
Oh yeah, they are both insanely rare. My main is also a PA user and I've got quite a bit BF from the duct tape while farming places you'd not expect to find it.
---
 There's also the depot to the west of the cart, and drop site G2/C2(?) to the northeast of watoga.
---
Those are the spots I farmed the Marine armour from.
---
Yeah after a few others have weighed in, I've decided to keep it.
---
I am just about at the point of not being able to play. I have minimum bulk, and have to use weapon weight reducing gear and bear arms, carry tons of weapons on me, as my stash is chuck full of  armor.  I have even gone through and minimized the weight of all the gear i dont use on workbenches. every day I sell off a chunk of stuff.  I need a vendor or something bad.
---
I kill swan as part of my farming route. He has been legendary a total of four times out of hundreds of rounds three stars all four times. He only dropped a legendary once. It was an assassin sentinel chest armor so I'm not too salty but I see this bug way too often.
---
I feel ya and agree. The extreme loading is really wearing on my nerves. I now keep my radio playing on my pip-boy just so I know I'm possibly 100% loaded. On xbox we have been getting these lag spikes at random, sometimes like every 10 seconds while in groups. Nothing more annoying then having the game pause for 5 seconds while surrounded by mobs. Getting odd visual background also. At times the trees and shrubs are tracing/bleeding into another, making me think I'm on some crazy drugs.
---
 Don't even wanna get into their servers not being able to keep up. If you run fast into a town like watoga you might get rendering issues so walls and objects are simply not there for a few seconds. Just enough time to feel like night crawler and walk through anything.
---
It either completely disabled Adrenal Reaction, or inverts the formula and gives a negative damage modifier, if you are in a group but far away from your teammate. It doesn’t do anything at all to Adrenal if you are not in a group (expected) or in a group and close to teammate (not expected- should do more damage)
---
thnx for the info
---
Might have figured it out. I fought the SBQ the night before and used the weapon swap trick a bunch of times to blast her. It must bug the game up for next time you log out and then in again by loading  the amount of reloads you interrupted all at once.
---
Weapon swap is a bug where you can fire it then swap to another weapon then back again and it will be instantly reloaded.
---
Hot damn! I dont know how far I went but the fall killed me lol, then got DC’d
---
Batons, lead pipes, etc. Every light 3 star is now saved. I buy them from vendors too.
---
But why stop there? If the additional tabs are added, subgroups to aid could also include a chem tab, the food tab, and etc. I just woke up and saw this post, sorry if I repeated someone one else unintentionally..
---
Don't forget to use green thumb. Collects twice as much fauna.
---
I love the new camera for its glitchiness. Been experimenting a lot with the new slingshot bug to start using it in various situations. Found an easy way to avoid the fall damage so you always survive when being flung around. So it’s a way to avoid combat, fast travel when over encumbered, etc. 
---
But as far as what it’s intended for, yeah, they could have utilized their resources better and skipped a camera entirely
---
where did you get the dense plans?
---
After unlocking every recipe and building part I don't know what else to spend caps on. I have a full sets of all the end game armors as a collection, etc. I really don't know what else to spend the caps on :(
---
Never thought to look on the ground...
---
RIP serrated faster swing switchblade taking care of afk vendor hogs.
---
New vegas bro
---
I asked them if they wanted in, they passed lol
---
Put a camp by the water, by Billings Homestead workshop for tons of corn and grain. Theres even a few junk extractors over there.
---
On Xbox I go to the friends tab then down to recent players, click the first person and press join game, it takes me back to the server if it wasn't a whole server problem..took me a bit to realize I could do that but it's helped a few times I was disconnected from server or my game crashed..
---
Here you go, since Beth won't do it modders have:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32
---
Yeah that’ll happen. Equip some armor that reduces fall damage or the goat legs perk card and you should survive. But the disconnects are pretty unpredictable. They almost always happen when you fling yourself out of bounds
---
I run a bloodied build too, and it's amazing against Super mutants, but having low health is a bit scary against hordes of Mr. Gutsys, and rad damage from ghouls does hurt. At least there's some trade-off. I got my Bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet to hit a tooltip value of 2,200. I'm tempted to see how high I can get it by stacking food and chems.
---
Only the Sheep card to spawn the sheep thingy. Caps are a joke, I'm at 70k across 3 characters.
---
You will need bones to make the mounted heads as they unlock and certain serum recipes call for them but there’s plenty around if you know where to look so I keep 10 in my stash just so I can quickly whip up a serum if needed.
---
Looking to make some White Russians myself with brought me to this thread.
---
I did, also had bird bones. I was also aiming up at about a 45°, when I reloaded I’d gone from Fred’s BBQ shack to Blackwater Mine
---
On one account? The weight limit sucks when you go to buy a plan or beer and can't due to max account weight.
---
You are wondering why your house with a bunch of BRIGHT LIGHTS is drawing the MOTHman to it?
---
I have gotten my last technicians pool cue from sheep man. It takes less time and stims to farm elsewhere for the same legendary loot table.
---
Okey thank you for clarifying
---
Pretty much for the same reason that radiation gives you super-powers. The Fallout world is based upon pulp fiction of the 1950's more than physics.
---
I've got an extra mascot head I can give you.
---
Yeah that's true... I hate those gustys. But the most problems I have with the big ghouls and yes, the damn radiation dmg.
---
Would be amazing to know how high you came with the dmg. Overdrive, furry, psychobuff glowing steak ect.
---
Yesterday a level 303 was doing the same with my girl. He was not alone, he had a couple of friends too. I started to kill the guy over and over with my sniper. The guys was revived at least six times. He tried to sneak and shot randonly with hi suseless explosive gun but that did not save his life at all. At some point this nugget started to run away and jump like hell. He was still getting killed.  
---
I enjoyed it very much.
---
Need them for Deathclaw Gauntlets, too
---
When a nuke drops. Kill glowing enemy's and loot their bodies. I did a run the easter holiday and got 56 nuclear waste.
---
Caps and stimpaks along with junk.
---
Take my upvote friend !
---
Raiders tag checks out.
---
I have a couple dozen 2 and 3 star pieces. I really hope they don't put a limit on what and how many you can trade in. Just let people play the game, as much as they want.
---
I haven’t found it worth it to hold onto workshops. I’m not hurting on mats so that might be why, I hoard everything. I just claim them, defend once or twice, then carry on and if I lose them, so be it. I also don’t play long enough in any given session to worry about holding on to them. 
---
I’m so sorry this happened to you. Server hopping was smart. Watch the upper left corner of your screen. Don’t quote me, but I think it might pop up a message when you are under attack. 
---
The griefing in my experience has calmed down significantly since launch. Good luck adventurer, and don’t let this get you down fellow vault dweller.
---
I, too, wish people like that didn't exist.
---
Explosive 3* Radium Rifle, shortly after full launch. Cost me 4k, which, at the time, was a lot and made me broke.
---
I didn't think Graham had it. I thought it was only the responders rare vendor.
---
Melee runs the risk of taking damage while closing the distance with enemies and while actually dealing said damage. At least with ranged weapons you can deal damage at a distance and not worry about that.
---
PS4 here.  Hmm maybe an option, thanks
---
Alas, console -_______-
---
 I agree, in the meantime  you can go to Fallout76Prefs.ini and change the RBG colors under \[Pipboy\] I have the color of my light orange, you can google the RBG numbers for the color you want  
---
my path to the file is:
---
C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Fallout76Prefs.ini
---
this is how it looks:
---
\[Pipboy\]
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=153.0000
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=204.0000
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=255.0000
---
Even within the context of the fictional world, I really cannot see why I would want to compete the bucket list of a long-dead tourist. At least "securing technical docuements" makes some sense.
---
Put Trump in a bunker and leave him there for 200yrs. That will make America slightly better again
---
Im not a fan of most single player games and this game gives me what I love about the fallout world and I can do it with friends. The game is bigger and has may more cool enemy's and locations than its predecessors. And more non location cool things to find. Their has been nothing memorable in fallout since that first behemoth. I have memorable experiences almost everyday in this game. Cryptids,nukes,greatest perk system,amazing easter eggs,visit other camps and make friends,scorch beasts, better robot npcs than some human ones have been,survival,nothing about any previous fallouts was difficult. Just a few reasons.
---
I need those shameful reminders lest I fall into old habits.
---
Ugh i know.   My worst was 3.
---
I don't like green light
---
What would even be better is just allowing us to make our own tabs. I hope Bethesda allows us to do this at some point.
---
Yeah you’ll fly about the distance of a nuke zone if nothing is in your way. I could type up a whole paper on the physics of the launch from testing it so many times.
---
Found the weakling.
---
Then put your spacial points elsewhere
---
Its my favorite bug now. Fast travel, AWAY!
---
Good to know!
---
But OP wasn't some high level, they were level 24.
---
The person attacking them clearly wasn't after the caps
---
Yeah, I don't your situation is the average one. Most players dont have everything in the game. I have tons of recipes to learn still, will take me at least 200k caps to learn all the buyable patterns still. 
---
Idk what to say other than people looking for starter and mid level gear, ammo, aid, etc still have plenty of people they can buy from with caps.
---
Once you have film crafted, the act of taking a picture is quicker than pulling up photo mode - that can't be argued
---
The only negative I find personally is now the materials I use for film would typically go towards my 1,400/day vender selloff...
---
Antiseptic becomes very useful if you make meds or serums
---
Hrm. I see
---
I'm not saying my situation is an average one, most traders aren't average players. I'm only talking about your average trader, I have no clue about those that don't trade, how far they are along in the game. Sorry if I came across like I was saying everyone was in the same situation as me, I was only talking about traders. As that is the main group I play with and talk to, and most of us don't know what to do with our caps at this point.
---
Fair enough, I personally don't bother so antiseptic is pretty useless to me.
---
I thought it was all aid not just stims.
---
Yeah I was more addressing some of the comments in this thread that suggest that everyone who pvps in adventure is automatically a griefer
---
Sort by new and ask yourself how many posts "add to the conversation". Most new posts are old complaints or old questions which have existing better threads.   
---
That said, this subreddit is full of people who seem to downvote based upon "I disagree with that", which I don't think makes for a productive subreddit, but it is what it is.
---
Bone is also needed for making the skeleton mask and costume as well now.  They used to be  of the best items to craft to sell to vendors before Bethesda lowered the value and raised the materials required.
---
If it’s for the crafting tick offs for weekly weapon, just go in
---
Assuming your camp isn’t **glaringly obvious** in it’s location, you’ll be fine
---
Nobody is revealed on the map unless you are top three
---
I was collecting weightless things, i had one weightless rocket launcher i planed to destroy at this legendary vendor, until i had to craft rockets for survival challenge, now i have 72 rockets, so lets rock!
---
I mean, it depends on your build. Bloodied stealth vats sniper can drop 5 enemies in 5 headshots with aimbot Gun-Fu from 100 yards away. Can’t do that with a super sledge.
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
This weeks objective can be done in 5 minutes or less so if that’s the one you’re eyeing it isn’t that bad - you might just be able to chance it and d it at your own camp if it’s not in a public spot.
---
Fallout 1 is the best Fallout ever, says the guy in his 30s
---
That’s really useful info, thanks. I was wondering if it would show up elsewhere but my hunch was that Bethesda just forgot to check that the challenges were possible once again. Seems that is the case.
---
5k for some two shot LMG
---
Aftet 500+ hours my west Virginia is just fine their is only so much to do after doing everything else but I like the comment
---
They aren’t griefers they are just roll playing as Raiders 
---
(eye roll)
---
I get you, but I'm telling you that I have lots of traders on my friends list that do accept caps, so you arent really accurately representing the situation. If you were, I wouldn't be able to trade anything because I have no top tier gear, at all, yet I trade daily and 90% of those trades involve caps.
---
Everyone can tell that that is just a normal storm photoshopped to be green. Everyone knows that Rad Storms are not real.
---
Nope, they have no way of dealing with it. Other subs have had this issue for years, there is nothing really reddit can do.
---
Some people didn't like 4 or New Vegas because it wasn't as... Dead and desolate as FO3's capital felt with all of its ruin. Sure there were cities and even little towns but outside of that it felt dead. 76 gets back to that. And to be honest Whitesprings feels as alive as any city in a Fallout game lol
---
Keeping people engaged and playing the game (and buying other stuff) is worth more than giving away 10c to a $1 of atoms every week to the few people who would actually achieve that and costs them no actual real money but could gain then more in the long run.
---
It was a highly unusual night.  I'm not sure why they kept spawning.  I checked the map every time to see if perhaps someone new had entered the area, but it was always just me.  So I just kept killing them.  haha
---
This is also how I learned that if you stay in Watoga killing robots long enough a crew of Gutsies will eventually flood the town.  They actually ended up driving me out and brought my killing spree to an end
---
If Alaska had the Appalachia Colonel Gusty, then no amount of armor would be safe.
---
I had it go invisible last night when it died (first time I’ve seen that in ~15 kills) but it was still there- you could see the chameleon shimmer, and interact with it. So I got my loot. I’m pretty sure it did the same for everyone because there were a lot of folks running around confused, but when I explained on voice comm what I saw, and they came and searched near me, seems like everyone found it.
---
Negative karma means nothing. It doesn't go and hurt your overall karma as negative karma now only really makes your post move down the queue it doesn't actually do anything else. So you shouldn't worry about downvotes at all.
---
Someone on the Discord for the Youtuber InnovSurvivalist had the same thing happen to their TSE explosive handmade... I had a TS Handmade I didn't need, so I gave it to them. Nowhere near as good, but it kept them in the game playing the way that they wanted. I wish I could have done more for them, but I just didn't have another handmade that was better.
---
They lost theirs when they accidentally killed themselves with a fatman. I have heard of this happening to others.
---
My deepest sympathies on your loss
---
Sometimes thr gutsy are there from the beginning!
---
Don’t think for a second a lvl 70 can’t compete with a lvl 152.  I’ve been ganked plenty of times by people levels 70-100. Especially if they team up. If people have alt characters they can still have killer weapons and armors 
---
I met a dude that was lvl 4 and he had the most impressive weapons stash I’ve seen yet and could have killed me pretty easily as a lvl 171.
---
Hopped 3 times at Bolton greens, found one on the big fountain. Lots of scorched there though. Also blowing up the bus causes the tourist’s body to go rocketing away.
---
I enjoyed the world and the gameplay and the guns and enemy's and enslaving children. Also the story in NV and 4 were meh at best
---
Yes and it's glorious to hear that sound when you're making violet flux
---
If you want to game a glitch, you can find the edge of the blast zone, stand outside it, place PA inside, hop in, step forward, jump out. Boom no rads no PA. Ezpz until they fix it (has been in the game since release)
---
Don't feel bad, I've had three characters running those quests and don't have it either.
---
20k caps and AAE 10mm for 5 serum recipes.
---
It's a real shame, really interesting that there are people who are *that* spiteful.
---
Honestly though can't they just intelligently identify a profile that's blatantly downvoting everything all the time?
---
In a suit of power armor at watoga. You know the one, by the crashed vertibird.
---
Not sure. But I lost all my stims and still had over 60 Radx and Radaway still on my character.
---
I wouldn't say easy, really depends on the group but it's simple enough and laid out plainly for those wanting to.
---
I still want a Charleston DMV photo frame so we can see the ID card we fought so hard and waited so long to get, heh.
---
Might be based on what system you are playing on. I am on PC and yeah the markets are pretty much completely dead on the PC. But it is MUCH easier to set up trades on the pc with the text chat mod, so maybe the PC traders are just faster at maxing out since they have a legitimate way of trading with the text chat.
---
I have some violet flux I’ll trade you for cobalt flux.
---
Well, I don't fully agree with them either.
---
I wouldn't say everyone doing pvp in adventure is a griefer. Just a portion. Much like it's always been in these kinds of games.
---
I pvp for workshops all the time. if it's owned and I need/want the resources there I'll go fight them for it. I'm not server hopping just to find another workshop.
---
I love taking workshops TO entice people to pvp me.
---
Sure I could just go to survival but like you I'm in it for the caps. I have no need to fight if the person is a low level trying to claim the shop. I need big fish for big caps
---
I also stay in the work shop the whole time I own it because I want to fight.
---
But finding someone who has a workshop and then tracking down their camp to blow it to hell is griefing
---
Yes, i like eating my food and using chems directly from the trash container
---
This is a good solution as well! I also love my x01 bright headlamp
---
Sounds like a bug or somoene put that fusion core in that armor then, because beth said they nerfed them to only spawn at 25% left in fusion generators and PA frames.
---
Games are weird for achievs/trophies. You've got games like killing floor 2 and gears of war that add achievements randomly, and then you've got games like rainbow 6 siege that have multiple season passes but didnt add achievements from the base game. I really hope they add more achievs/trophies though, I'm loving this game
---
From what I understand most of the downvote bots use multiple accounts, and proxies to bypass anything reddit can put in place to stop them.
---
You lose all your junk, random aid, and caps equal to 1/4 of your level. 
---
Just a heads up, dont spawn into Whitespring or any popular station with all your aid and junk...
---
I like fo76 bc after you're done with the story you can still go out and have fun with friends. In the other fallout games I get bored bc I cant find anything else to do after the story other than some boring side quests. Fo76 is entirely different from the other games. Different people are going to like it, it attracted a whole new community.
---
Looks like there is no creature with "Alien race" flag.
---
You can check all records from f76editor

---
"AlienRace" referenced by "EncALien01" - "EncAlien04" but its zetan aliens from prevous parts of the game, and they are not ingame atm.
---
FlatwoodMonster is not referenced by AlienRace flag.
---
Wait really? I got a TSE + 90% less weight railway rifle like  3 days ago aswell, my first ever TSE :D
---
I guess that's possible and the thought had crossed my mind, but who fuckin knows with this game. As much as I love it.
---
Yeah, I feel like I've done everything in 76 and am bored. The others had a fuck load of reply value.
---
76 has nothing.
---
Because that would be asking too much of them. We get one thing at a time. Working on all that tab sorting would be months of content updates. Atoms only pay for so much code.
---
To add on, I also play on survival with a different lower level guy.
---
My main guy is mostly a builder and I'm not about to break down and store my camp just to play survival.
---
My survival alt is more pragmatic, stashing the majority of his junk and aid. No building big complicated structures, just doing quest/events and trying to survive. I also don't go out of my way on survival to mule my caps to someone else or one of my alts.
---
Or, they could add more weapons in future updates. I would love to see one of the vaults or a new place happens to have an armory of new and unique weapons. Would make it worth the wild to raid a vault to get an R91 blueprint/legendary
---
Don't sell such items for caps in the future :P
---
If you get killed you drop all your junk items you are currently carrying (exactly same as adventure mode), small portion of your aid items (don't carry 100 stimpaks with you) and small amount of caps (scales with your level). Higher level you are more you lose. And ofc higher level player you kill, more you get.
---
If you are thinking about the weekly weapon remember that you can collect what you need for the objectives on adventure more and then just log to survival directly on your camp and craft / scrap what is needed.
---
On a side note, i played survival the first time the bonus xp was on earlier this month and it wasn't that bad really. Rather enjoyed it. And i generally hate all pvp. I got killed maybe 3-4 times who weekend (played like 10h each day). Don't be afraid of high lv's. There is no difference between level \~60 and level 500 character if you have planned your build in advance. Other than maybe the experience they have of the game. Only thing might be that they may or may not have better items on them IF your lowbie toon is your first and not your alt.
---
Yup, which is why I said, it might be a bug. Pretty much anything at this point might be a bug with the way this game works. It is very frustrating to love something so flawed and having to watch bethesda make it worse and worse.
---
I fucking launched my self from whitespring sallows the way over the east barrier.
---
food aid chems tabs please
---
I, too, want nothing to do with PVP.  But, like one of the other responses indicated, as long as your camp isnt in a highly trafficked place, you'll be fine.  Just make sure you have all the materials ready, and then exit Adventure server at your CAMP.  When you spawn in on the Survival server, you'll be at your base.  Just craft (and scrap, in the case of the weapons) quickly, then bounce back off the server.  You'll be fine.  I did this same thing yesterday.  I also just switched back to Adventure, if I ran out of mats.  Didnt feel like taking a chance by fast traveling around to get more stuff needed.  :)
---
Same boat, but on Xb1. Got all of the achievements for Fallout 76 and loving the game. Would love to see some more achievements added in the future.  
---
Perhaps we might see an achievement added for finally completing the Overseers quests when the DLC "Wastelanders" rolls out... Or not.  
---
Who knows, but I'm getting antsy for some more achievements to *~~^(whore)~~* Hunt as I always enjoy getting achievements in each game.
---
the best they can do is 500 atoms. /s
---
Ansel is a reference to Ansel Adams (which the Nvidia feature is named after).  He's the photographer who took those famous photos of Yosemite.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel\_Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams)
---
Annie is (I believe) a reference to Annie Liebovitz.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie\_Leibovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz)
---
There's been speculation recently that people were wrong in thinking he's in a singular spot.. he actually has 6 or 7 spawn locations.. "roaming vendor"
---
They’re also used for weapons like the deathclaw gauntlet
---
Better than 2000 caps?  Maybe in old survival mode when a kill was worth 2x their lvl. 
---
My first 2 kills I got about 500 caps.  I ended up with about 8-9 before I got killed the first time.  I didn’t like losing 300 caps, but by that point had probably netted almost 1K.  
---
In a way, I think they’ve made survival less fun because it’s just people getting sloppy and killing each other over and over again because the cap penalty for dying isn’t that great.  While I think it was the right decision to nerf the cap loss or gain, they obviously went too far as there’s not much incentive to hunt players.  It’s still fun to wander the wasteland but not nearly as exciting and harrowing.
---
They’re not similar. They both kinda have a barrel shroud and that’s it.
---
It's strange that the plans are tied to doing a weekly challenge, for the weekly challenges are recorded on a account level and unlocking/learning plans are on a character level.  Which means completing the challenge will somehow unlock the plans for all characters on the account or only one character on the account will be able to learn the plans; which would suck.  Of course this is Bethesda we are talking about, so a lot of what they implement is problematic, strange or just messed up lol
---
Sounds light to me, I have 4 characters at 1700 +/- each
---
I have been forced to vendor dozens of legendaries from the stockpile, due to weight restrictions.
---
Gauss 2k Stand Fast/Bastion 1k
---
You’re right, I suppose I assumed it would be similar to something like the quest tab. After thinking about it and your response, it’s a loaded request.
---
i have gotten to the point where I am carrying my heavy weapon legendaries in my inventory because it weighs so much less there than in my stash. that way I can fill up my stash box with 100+ pounds of light weight legendary armor and light melee/pistols
---
I’d love for them to put a trigger option where you can set certain junk manually to not be scrapped. I get annoyed when I go a digested goo run and accidentally scrap.
---
This is what most high levels they find single digit levels and help them to 10 or so
---
Thanks!!!
---
This is correct. Currently the only "aliens" that would work for this weekly are the Zetans they will be adding in the future, that aren't currently in game. 
---
So this is another weekly challenge that is completely impossible to complete because the NPC's needed for the challenge aren't in the game yet. Just like last weeks camera challenges that were impossible, and the impossible challenges they had during the brewing release.
---
This is becoming a regular occurrence with these challenges, and now that they are starting to add in these p2w things such as the repair kits, fridges, and being able to stash junk from anywhere into the Atom shop is really really shady looking.
---
Bethesda please stop role playing as vault tec.
---
Your post promotes interest in bobble heads and magazines, items that otherwise are ignored and neglected in fo76. You deserve an official fo76 reward from Bethesda.
---
dude, how does the assault rifle look more like [this](http://norfolktankmuseum.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Vickers-Medium-Machine-Gun.jpg) than the Lewis I linked to?  it def looks more like a Lewis than Vickers...
---
I can totally understand it for political, maybe financial motive, but a community about a game? It's saddening
---
It is. Got a late start. Started 2 weeks ago.
---
Give me back my light in shining darkness
---
Relax I was laughing
---
Are you on PC or console? If you are on PC you can modify your INI files to completely remove water effects, grass, reflections, and shadows and you should be able to play it without any lag at all.
---
Yeah it always frustrates me when I’m looking for plans and they have every note that exists in the game in their inventory
---
Give me back my light in shining darkness and maria
---
Done and done, and I mean done
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
At first, I thought you were being serious, but you gave me a good laugh now.
---
There are tons of times companies would want to "force" a viral marketing ad to the front page. That is what they normally use these for, to force viralness.
---
How did we all start talking about warframe anyway?
---
On 1 account, different characters
---
I just find it odd that this is the only Alien challenge scripted this way. The other 5 are done properly. To me it almost looks like someone did the weekly challenge after an 8 hour coding session. It looks like an innocent mistake using Race instead of ActorType. 
---
This one seems like mistype rather than the other ones you mentioned where they just dumped everything in without flags to prevent them from being in the pool. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to include FWM since the other 2 photo challenges do.
---
Yeah daily logins are cool.
---
Maybe legendaries that have some of the same effects as mutations.
---
-marsupial
---
-speed demon
---
-etc
---
New things:
---
-stagger effect
---
-fire damage (perfect storm)
---
-acid/poison
---
-unbreaking
---
I would also like to see a rework on existing effects:
---
-beserkers
---
-nocturnal
---
-enemy specific attacks (exterminator,hunters, etc)
---
-junkies
---
-stalkers
---
All aid is susceptible to dropping on deaths, not just stimpaks. It seems to be relative to how much aid you have, I carry as little aid items as possible in Survival so usually I only drop a few items in low quantities. That does not seem to be the case for some of the players I’ve killed, as I’ve seen stacks of 30+ purified water or stimpaks drop. Obviously I have no idea what their inventory looked like but I can only assume they were carrying a lot more aid items than I do lol
---
Haha, AP regen on hits, infinite vats 🤘 would be op, unless its just a small regen
---
I got loss of one star items
---
If you're thinking about going for the legendary weapon and don't want to PvP, first make sure your camp is placed at an out of the way spot where it is less likely that other players will be around.  Start in Adventure mode and gather all your resources there then fast travel back to camp, log off, and relog back into Survival to do the actual crafting.  (you will need a lot of adhesive and beer bottles btw)
---
Here's the strategy I used for getting The Action Hero.  
---
Ranged Weapons: hit the Charleston area to kill Scorched and Super Mutants until you've picked up 20 of their guns (I had to store some in stash so I could fast travel)  I also hit Wade Airport to get some extra adhesive since that place is littered with glue and tape  
---
Melee: Crafted 10 boards since they are wood and leather only and then scrapped those 10 to meet the requirement
---
Energy and Explosive Ammo:  With these two simply pick the types of ammo that use the least amount of resources you have an abundance of.  I chose missles for explosive, for example.
---
Molotovs: This one can be a little tricky because it requires 40 beer bottles.  I went to the frat house in Morgantown (the messy one, not the one which the Nuka Cola room) and collected around 20 bottles from a single run through it. Logged off, ate dinner, logged back in and hit the frat house again for another 20 bottles.
---
If you've gathered your materials ahead of time you can knock this challenge out very quickly.  I spent maybe 30-40 minutes on it.  In all fairness, however, I had an abundance of other materials already in my stash.  If you have to scrounge for steel, etc as well it will probably take longer.
---
Sure, it would be a neat location in theory - but please take into consideration that whenever an item is put on sale or gets added/removed (oftentimes on an hourly basis!), someone at BGS would have to manually update the display cases and then distribute the altered game files. Each of these would be like a mini patch, increasing bandwith and maintenance. Plus, running two independent item shops is prone to errors and discrepancies.  Just the upkeep of such a location would be a full-time occupation, likely requiring a team of half a dozen people - people, who I'd rather see working on actual additions to the game!
---
That's why I think a trial period would be the best solution for both BGS and the players.
---
I wouldn’t mind seeing a faction war type thing like for honor does. Play for a faction, earn them points.
---
It happens sometimes, if you change to a new server it should fix it
---
Meanwhile im still trying to find out how and where to get one, so i can jusdge by myself if its useless or not...
---
What if it was like “replace 15% dmg with *small* AP regen
---
How many Mr. Fuzzy Tokens can you get per day?
---
Yeah I’d definitely get some if I didn’t have to put them on my face.
---
I know, right? The FOMO is real hear, I wish they didn't have limited time events or limited time atom shop items, it really detracts from my experience, especially since I'd like to have the chance to be a completionist and get everything, but I just can't with the limited time events or atom shop items, and the stash box limitations.
---
I did that with one of my characters and took way too long to get all the mods I wanted for my X-01. On my other character, I decided to stick with either my modded Excavator PA or buy and install mods for my T-51b which are readily available at Whitesprings.
---
Yeah. has happened to my wife and myself. We hopped worlds, and it sorted itself out. Apparently it's just that server you're on isn't coping.. or something of that nature.
---
If it wasn't a repeated pattern I'd agree with you, but at this point broken challenges happen every week now. I definitely wouldn't put it past them to "accidentally" make a challenge that earns Atoms not work especially right when they release all these new PA skins and such for only 1 day.
---
They want to force people into buying atoms instead of doing challenges for the atom's, yet they want to be able to point at the challenges as "proof it isn't pay 2 win" since anyone can earn them through the challenges! Lets just ignore the broken challenges...
---
Here's why:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh885p/why\_the\_kill\_an\_alien\_challenge\_works\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh885p/why_the_kill_an_alien_challenge_works_with/)
---
I submitted a ticket with all the information needed to fix it. So it'll probably be fixed well after the fix is relevant.
---
I have no idea how it is actually gonna work or if saving items will give any benefit, but just in case i've been throwing everything to my mule account. I have my third mule toon now almost full of just legendaries (stash + toon = \~2400lbs?)
---
Im new and only been playing a couple days but nade spamming has worked against anything slightly too hard for guns or melee
---
If you’re looking to get this to make caps, just a fair warning, it’s been needed recently. Now costs more materials to make and the payout is a lot less. 
---
New plan to get instead for caps is the marine tactical helmet.
---
I'd trade for any plans or recipes I'm missing, I'd have to check later. I know I need these booze recipes: Cranberry Moonshine, All Firecracker Whiskey, White Russian.
---
Or a 1* bloodied handmade, assault rifle, lever action, or combat rifle.
---
Or do you have any offers that might interest me?
---
most items aren't worth it to bulk though, that would just be a waste of plastic
---
That would be cool! 
---
I was thinking of an legendary effect like returning ammo to the wepon, ( not to the mag ofc) would be kinda cool! Or like 15% chance for a bullet to return to the mag with extra dmg like luck in the chamber ( destiny refferense)
---
I’m surprised this haven’t been added?
---
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
I actually have that plan thanks I will use that one instead
---
I thought this too, but most likely the cost is the legendary itself.
---
I think you mean flora, unless that flux has mutated even further since I last checked
---
unless it's a treasure map or quest related I drop it, who keeps random notes?
---
I don't normally accept random team invites unless I know people. I just get annoyed getting them or trade requests every couple of minutes from people wanting my best weapons and armor. But I will always help people out if you are near me or I hear gunshots. I am also on PSN (RebelCop), feel free to come tag along one day.  If I know people need help with a particular area or quest, I have been known to tag along and assist with those also. Since being in the end game stage I have nothing better to do other then grind all day for supplies.
---
I have no idea, but damn.. I want that so bad as well.
---
no secret of course, just the usual perk cards, the gunslingers, gun Fu and vats buffs..it's more my "having fun with mid-level hordes" gun..it gets tucked away if there's a SB overhead ;)
---
The guy destroyed their camp not workshop.  The higher levels ruining noobs camps are griefers
---
Would also be cool with a melee legendary effect that makes some form of aoe dmg around you when you hit stuff, like a small energi/rads/poision etc explosion
---
i wish they looked a little less.. sticker-y? but i 100% agree, i’ve been wishing for tattoos in other areas since FO4 :|
---
I do. The people I play with do so we can trade them with each other, then I give what’s left to low levels.
---
It is.  Junk and random aid items.
---
I'm on PC. I have 2 Mascot heads. I'll trade for an imposter helmet.
---
Where? Spent a long time server hopping at reported places for nothing.
---
Then they will nerf the amount of milk we can get even more! I like the idea but anytime they giveth they also taketh away :-)
---
Well you can dilute your regulars. I didn't realize diluted didn't effect mutations though. Been selling them by the score. I just always used regulars because its my kind of value when wasting precious resources...common enough to find everywhere.
---
This would be amazingly useful!
---
planning to replace the helm with the sentry bot helmet, will go great with my spiked heavy rocket sledge
---
Sorry, I should have included that of course! Yes, I play on PC :-)  
---
Will try that, thanks!
---
So your armor piece removed 50%, and your goat legs reduced the remaining 50% by 90% 
---
Which totals 95%. 
---
Or maybe your goat legs took it down by 90% and the 50% was applied afterward = 95%
---
I'm not talking about plans or recipes, I am talking about the random notes you find in Appalachia.
---
True, but having a lot of items in the store means effort from their part and they don't want that.
---
agreed on the teapot
---
Lol ya lots of people having that problem find someone on Reddit holding the location on your console or pc
---
Yeah they updated the survival. When it first was released you lost a lot of aid not they made it so you don’t lose everything. I’m always looking for people to group with for survival so if you want help I play on Xbox gt: Tops Bloobie
---
Your virginity, for sure.
---
I am on PC, as well.
---
It's a bit strange that you were saying that your situation might not be average cuz younplayrd so much, but here you are saying that you're the average. 
---
I get that some people are uninterested in caps for trade, no doubt about it. Just accept that that's not true for everyone, of even most. The only trades I have done that wasnt for caps was junk for junk trades. 
---
I have seen TSE weapons for sale for 35-50k caps. 
---
I definitely get your point that caps are a limited trade currency, and ingest how player vending seems useless for you. For me and many others, it will be very cool.
---
Hopefully legendary tokens can become a core currency and be used for trading.
---
Really like the stagger idea... also would really like to see stalker become a different perk tier.
---
I couldn't do it. I had to sell them. I ran out of space in my stash.
---
Excellent request and one I've been wishing for a long time. It's time and resource consuming enough to collect ultracite and to produce the stable flux without having to fabricate the ammo too.  I come across large amounts of the proper caliber for my Prime modded gun that I literally have to just give away.
---
I actually no longer have that weekly challenge now (PC). Maybe they're swapping out broken ones out when they realize they're broken.
---
I've been on that end of those mistakes before, so I understand how they happen. With this current one being told to flag it as "Aliens" and using the wrong Alien tag is somewhat forgivable in my mind. Same with the photo issues last week; they added the challenges before they stalled the release of the camera.
---
I'd chalk it all up to negligence or call it a Rookie Mistake before I called it out as being malicious.
---
I feel your pain. For me it's Lead Champagne Bellini :(
---
Thanks for that. I have no idea where that is, but am going to find out!
---
Nope. I'm asking to close an obvious exploit. Exploits aren't fair game. That's not demanding how others play, it is asking the company responsible for creating the rules to close a loophole and enforce them. PvP players don't get to go to the Adventure servers, exploit a loophole, and say that the problem is Adventure players buying and playing a game with that loophole. That's demanding we play PvP. Asking the devs to fix an issue that is not supposed to happen in the mode we chose to play isn't the same thing at all.
---
Me too, but the effort to get those keys...  Jesus.
---
Yep just got into the Enclave quests and would love a skin
---
Hahaha exactly
---
Exactly, I mean would any of us really loved Popeye as much if his anchor tattoo had been in the middle of his forehead?
---
I was saying bethesda may possibly add it to the atom shop eventually because they want us to pay atoms for it.
---
Right
---
Dang. I'm a bit of a hoarder because I carry around stuff to give to other players. Currently carrying over 100 stimpacks and my stash is full.
---
Most (all?) nuclear plant workshops have a nuclear ore mine. Take the workshop, build an extractor, stock up on acid (require to refine the ore to useable material), profit? Hell while you’re at it, see if you get the event to power up the power plant. It’s a lot of work but gives high end power generator plans (you can get fusion generators from it) and nuclear plants also have the fusion core manufacturing, so if you power up a plant and take the workshop, you can run the fusion core generator and get 8 100% cores an hour to power your new P.A.
---
I'm on PC.  How much do you need?  You can find enough to make 3 cobalt flux at the Whitespring (with green thumb).  There are 5 plants between the two enclave entrances, 5 plants between the NE entrance (by the train station) and the SuperMutant camp to the north and 5 more on your way in heading toward the little firehouse.
---
Toxic Valley up north.
---
Ahh...my bad...I don’t keep those.  I do end up with a bunch then just delete them when I realize I have a bunch.
---
2300 lbs  + 400 lbs waiting for the vendor.
---
2300 lbs is 1044.2 kg
---
Same here. Kinda confuses me that people hold on to pointless notes.
---
Probably... I just figured the plan is really expensive from the vendors and I could definitely sell it to someone cheaper if they wanted it instead of reading and never using it. 
---
The most I've paid for a gun was a tse gatling for 2k caps so on the off chance they were starting to collect power armor plans to run a modshop... I could see how it could be worth it in that situation.
---
Thanks for looking out.
---
Well, I've got good news and bad news. The good news is you don't have to get Fire Whiskey. The bad news is it isn't in the game. Nobody has it and it doesn't appear as a possible recipe in the 'craft x different alcoholic beverages' challenges. I know it appeared in a preview right before brewing/distilling got released, but it's a myth.
---
Never actually crossed my mind. Thank you for this. More ammo!
---
I second you they should be able to give to the ability to gain such atoms on such said time
---
No problem. Share to save a life lol
---
That's a very un-fun idea, fo76 shouldn't feel like a daily chore.
---
How about continue improving the game so that I \_want\_ to log in daily to \_play\_.
---
It works on Missile Silo Mainframe Cores.
---
if it is a possible drop, it's rare Fasnacht mask-rare. Nobody has ever reported getting one.
---
You must have some benevolent leaderboard hunters in your servers...Everytime I get caught in my camp when I'm in the top 3, the whole thing gets leveled.
---
I had one guy this morning get mad cause I killed him on his first attempt. He hung out on a ridge overlooking my camp and unloaded missiles and an explosive .50 Cal on my beautiful camp until I eventually logged out.
---
Dunno, you buy first!
---
&gt; If you haven't been on for months it could be phantom weight. If you clear out your entire inventory and you still have a weight problem look into this.
---
I did that last night and it's looking more and more like this.  There's 25 pounds somewhere I can't account for.
---
Will be adding you! see you in the wasteland
---
Well, that is neither reduced nor eliminated with lvl 3 Class Freak -- it has no impact, which is what the OP was asking. Imo, that's not really a negative like -4 INT with Marsupial-- it's actually the point of carnivore. Also, you can eat prepared foods made from fruits and vegetables. Your hunger will not be satisfied, but you can still receive the buffs (e.g., cranberry relish and cobbler still give you the buffed XP). You can do this with or without Class Freak. So, my response stands-- nothing is different with respect to carnivore with Class Freak active versus without.
---
I played my first 100+ hours solo. You'll find that playing with friends is a good thing too.
---
I just want the helmet, would go real well with my Trapper gear. Lol.
---
This is done intentionally so you feel like you missed out in many and then go open your wallet to get one skin for 14 dollars just remember there’s other 3 skins with that theme 56 bucks for all 4... that’s what almost paid for the game you guys are smoking crack
---
As cool as it would be, I think this is a purely aesthetic decision by Bethesda to not allow it. 
---
The time period the game is based on was extremely stigmatized against tattoos. The only people with any kind of sleeves were complete carnys or people living on the absolute fringe and the main styles of the time were fairly simplistic (in America). 
---
Running around with a water colored brahmin would be cool and all but probably both lore breaking and visually jarring.
---
It's getting better, I haven't disconnected in days. Days I tell you!
---
Oh, I see.
---
yes.
---
Yup, it is so obvious it isn't funny or slick. They just look desperate and pathetic.
---
I played over 400+ hours solo- it’s definitely worth if you like exploring- just beware Scorchbeast fissure sites!!
---
I'd say wait a while so there's less bugs because oh boy.
---
To be fair, they also said the Burrows would be really challenging and, well, it's not.
---
I doubt the Vaults will be long enough to require repairs.  No one would play them.  Today, there aren't many players that run silos because even at the 30-45 minutes it takes to run one of those, they are still prone to disconnects.  I won't run one without knowing I had a friend on the server, just so I could rejoin if I needed to.  There's little worse than running a whole silo, going to the SBQ battle, and crashing with no way of returning.
---
I enjoy it for those reasons. I rarely group up. I just cant convince my friends to buy the game :/ 
---
You have to go in expecting your typical Bethesda bugs and also be aware you cant mod all of your QoL issues away like their single payer counterparts. 
---
There is a ton to explore. The survival aspect can be brutal at times. 
---
That my 2 cents. If you can find it for 20 bucks id pick it up.
---
How/where did you find the plans? I still need the Arm one.
---
This was done to make some time for them to figure what the eff to do next and how to get money from players
---
He probably would (or should) always be at his station outside of Harper's ferry, where they teased him in the trailer. But yes, the datamined stuff shows more spawn points, so it's going to be interesting.
---
Firecracker Whiskey and related beverages appears to have been cut from the game. 
---
You can be forgiven for thinking it exists given that it was specifically called out in an "Inside the Vault" right before brewing/distilling was released, but nobody has it and it doesn't appear on lists for the "craft x different alcoholic beverages" challenges.
---
Just another thing Bethesda blew off and didn't bother to explain.
---
At the moment loot from the bosses are actually worse than average. I don’t recall getting the same wood garbage repeatedly from a single creature. After some youtubers bragged how they could farm guaranteed good legendary from Awol event, it got nerfed immediately, for several weeks i got nothing but wood pieces from legendary gutsys, recently I started to get rolling pins and batons so it’s improving.
---
No, at the time of the invasion there was only one oil deposit left on the planet, that's where the Poseidon oil rig was built. I think they invaded Alaska because it was the closest state, and it allowed military access into annexed Canada and the US.
---
This.
---
I use perks to reduce weight on Aid and Food so I always have all of my Aid, Food, and Drink items on me. I use one of the inventory mods so my stuff gets sorted by type and it's still a small pain to go through.
---
fallout 4

#HOARD EVERYTHING
---
Im on xbox. I just joined the reddit fo76 market place yesterday. I plan to post anything useful on there today. Ill be in game most of the day today.
---
Lol.  You almost got me there.
---
I have been playing for a month allready and as for me, this game is all about exploring, reading terminals, notes, etc. Allmost all I do in game is exploring and crafting.
---
And yeah, you can do allmost everything solo. There is also "Lone Wanderer" perk wich gives bonuses if you are alone
---
Cork. Seems to creep into your stash from nowhere by the ton.
---
The daily quest gives u 3 tokens
---
Keep us updated.
---
Plot twist  
---
*this is the beta*
---
Look at MG 08/15 in particular if you really want to see a rifely looking one.
---
That barrel shroud is just a big radiator and hollow tube which if you look at the in-game model it is most definitely a water jacket like the maxim and the higher level “barrels” look very similar to later model vickers guns. 
---
The Lewis gun has a top mounted pan magazine which the assault rifle does not have. If you look at one of the maxims with the belt drum it’s very close to the higher capacity magazine modeled in-game, never mind that it feeds from the side unlike the top mounted Lewis.
---
The maxim/vickers barrel protrudes from the water jacket and it is recessed in the Lewis gun due to it needing to be able to pull air through the radiator jacket when it’s fired.
---
You’re holding up a picture of a ford pickup and saying it’s a Chevy because they look vaguely similar.
---
That's a good point.  Their recoil from getting hit can buy you time.
---
I feel like sometimes people wanna steal your post for karma...
---
Like me posting the camera teleport method ... 
---
I’m never bringing a bug here ever I’m keeping to myself and rejoice of the other ones I know and I’m not sharing
---
&gt; It's a bit strange that you were saying that your situation might not be average cuz you played so much, but here you are saying that you're the average. 
---
I didn't say I played that much. I clearly said I took 3 months off from playing. I said the exact opposite.
---
&gt;I have seen TSE weapons for sale for 35-50k caps. 
---
That is insanely overpriced. You can get TSE's for around 4k caps.
---
&gt;Hopefully legendary tokens can become a core currency and be used for trading. Maybe they will remove the cap limit. Point is, player vending for caps may well be a starting point.
---
From what I understand the legendary tokens will be untradeable, so I doubt they will be the future currency. We had already tried to switch to a different currency, ultracite ammo, but bethesda put a stop to that when they suspended traders who had traded for over 100k of that ammo.
---
Me too, it's awesome to see the Fallout universe still inspiring people!
---
Here is a pretty good list of the ways to modify the INI files to increase performance:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9u0xtb/pc_fallout_76_optimizationperformance_tweaks_ini/
---
What a lovely dead horse.
---
How do you survive the fall?
---
I worked very very hard to make my Excavator PA work, reactive plates, faster sprint, etc. A week in Survival Beta week 1 told me the armour was worthless and I switched to X-01. At least I don't die in half a second now.
---
I'm curious as to why they took out the option to change your pip boy colors in the first place. If I remember it was available to do that in Fallout 4 on day one.
---
Try going against ghost leviathans in *Subnautica*, mucho scary times.
---
bro, it's based on all air/water cooled light machine guns from WWI/WWII, *including* the Lewis gun, and I think it looks more like the Lewis than a Vickers but sure, I see the resemblance there as well...
---
I commented yesterday I could brick your game and a guy ( whose name ) code monkey ) lost his shit because of wording.
---
I’m like dude we understand that you work in coding but for much simple people putting ( brick , corrupt , break ) pretty much bottom lines you could make your game eat crap
---
Pretty sure all of those are options. Most of mine came from mass crafting and breaking with super duper. 
---
But for example, ultra light build for marine I have mod pieces for.
---
If you loved fallout 4 you’ll love this
---
I've played my first 220 hours solo need to work on that friend thing soon
---
I love it, its a great grind style game that you can sink a ton of hours in.
---
Ok from what I can tell ultra light is a mod. Mods can be added and the Tiers is upgrading the base stats (welded, tempered etc)
---
I'm saying that people need to chill the hell out over this stupid outrage since there are worse shit that they could've done. Like, seriously, this is first world shit you guys are complaining about.
---
On a slight unrelated topic... there are plans for a tin foil hat?
---
I keep 50 in my stash, they don’t take up much space. Most things I only keep 50 of, except or the things I use a lot of, or rarer stuff like ballistic fiber an gears...I hoard these things.
---
How about just boycott repair kits if no one buys them they would take em down really.
---
I can't remember the last time I was over weight. With unyileding armor my carry weight is 400ish depending on my health. The only weight reducing perks I use is the traveling hiker and pharmacy because I hoard chems and drinks.
---
For real. I got the bad luck one and spent like an hour trying to find out how to move it only to find out your cant. Who gets a tattoo dead center on their forehead lol. I swapped for the eagle on the throat.
---
I mean, that's what the atom shop is for, isn't it? To make money on cosmetics that people want?
---
the current challenges are silly chores already. what are you talking about.
---
If you have two pieces of armor that reduce fall damage by 50% each, it totally negates fall damage. Alternatively, if you equip the goat legs perk card you can survive most falls but still take damage and can break your legs.
---
Haha same
---
I'm up to 360, and still play mostly solo. I do think it's more fun completing survival events or silo/sbq fights with a team.
---
Thanks for the response. I am trying to figure out how to improve my weapons, and armor.
---
Power armor makes diseases a joke.
---
Thx
---
Now it’s just infuriating tbh I used to grind all challenges for atoms my last purchase was the silver excavator skin ...
---
Now I won’t even stack 200 atoms all challenges are messed up.
---
I’m really thinking about playing this only on patch release dated rather then daily grind. 
---
Shit is getting outa hand , and I’m not about to pay for a skin.( I’ve done before) that it’s un achievable , look at the long term every single week they’re going to be using those “limited “ tactics, to pressure you in to tossing your money , then next week again , say loot boxes are wrong , this shit kinds is too
---
Idk, look at this sub. If it wasn't it would be dead on here. We have reg 76, bazaar and market. Something to think about..
---
I just got it on my own at Mothman. 
---
Oooh, I think welded and the like can be found as mods as well(though I could be wrong). I pretty sure its just the tiers you are speaking of are just grouped this way because they are more likely to effect D&amp;E resistance. While the others are more likely to add effects(like deep pocket)
---
Their screwing up the challenges every update is not new anymore....  
---
I guess they have no department for the quality control.
---
Also sailors and Marines?
---
Cool I'm getting on in a few, what's your GT
---
I'll stop whipping it when they stop bringing it back to life.
---
I think as a rule of thumb, all of the PA paints are going to be like this.  They are the most expensive thing in the shop and, for some players, the most desirable.  They'll exploit both those things to make players buy Atoms with real money.
---
On the other hand, you're Lv. 250.  You probably have hundreds of hours in the game.  They're giving us a bunch of free DLC all year.  The game probably didn't meet their sales projections and yet unlike Skyrim or Fallout 4, there's an ongoing cost to them to keep the servers going.  They're going to try and make it up somewhere.
---
Now, if you bought the super expensive Tricentennial Edition, I feel for you.  But if you're like me, and you spent all of $35 on the game, you've probably gotten your money's worth.  I think of Cities: Skylines and how I paid $30 for that, but over time, I've probably paid closer to $100 after all the expansions.  The Sims people have it worse.  Here, I'm getting all the expansions for free, so I'm not that fussed about paying for Atoms if something *really* good comes along.  Fortunately for me, it hasn't.
---
You think that is nuts, should see the ripper someone found recently. doing 400+ damage every quarter second is just brokenly OP.
---
Get some chameleon armour and farm the sentry bots at Whitesprings.
---
You guys convinced me already :)
---
All of the above. 
---
Easiest is to find someone who can do it. Otherwise it's farming mats for scrapping, or neverending server hopping and fast travel to farm plans.
---
It also helps if you scrap **every** non-legen. Armor drop you get.
---
With VATS in melee you can teleport to them form a distance, kind of like a weaker version of blitz from FO4.
---
When 99+% of legendaries are trash no that is not too high of a drop rate.
---
Caps, Aid, Junk, and Morale.
---
Less anecdotally, people who data mine the game files say it was removed from the drop list for SBQ.
---
You can't solo sheepsquatch with that stealth VATS sniper build. That melee build you can.
---
I sent you a friend request on fallout 76.
---
Same
---
But you are the loophole . You are the one that’s accepting the group invites and not blocking them
---
That’s an Incredibilis idea
---
Ty 👍
---
Holy sh*t this is really OP af 😂
---
Nah bro, you said you have every plan unlocked and then in an edit that said 'then again, I have been playing on and off since beta and only took a 3 month break'. You offered that as an explanation for why you are filled to the gills with caps and plans.
---
Lol, please. Find me a TSE for 4k caps. That is the best possible DPS combination unless maybe you roll bloodied. I sold a quad crit damage combat shotgun with some other third star for 4.5k caps. I sold a stalkers explosive gatling gun for 5k caps. Dont tell me the the best guns in the game sell for 4k. You are being dishonest.
---
You're probably right about them being untradeable. Do you have a source that lead you to that understanding?
---
And yes, the infamous ammo bans. What a joke.
---
Yup, yet you still got idiots in this subreddit defending bethesdas actions. It is pathetic.
---
It took three server hops, but I got in, thanks.
---
They expect people to have forgotten waiting for another upraise to actually make them...
---
I worked in production control to make shit like this won’t even take a few days.
---
And shipping perhaps a weekend ...
---
Just saying unless they’re stiching every single thread and seam by hand ...
---
Works for serums too if thats what youre crafting it for.
---
Fo4 I've done almost everything within a few months and I dont care about small missions. I've tried to get back into it but it's boring after 2 playthroughs. I have a whole bunch of friends that have fo76 and I play with them regularly. We find plenty of stuff to do and I've been playing since its release. Maybe if you socialised ingame you'd find some people to have fun with but for some they cant get into fo76. But shiting on OP for liking 76 more than any other FO game is just a shitty thing to do. Go play your games and quit shitting on others for playing other games.
---
I would like to see a gun that buffs the higher your health, but not sure of the risk to add to this kind of an award with a legendary.    I enjoy running vanguard only reason why I’d like a gun like this
---
I believe it can also drop as random loot, I've sen a number of what I think are the same item dropping from ghouls in WS.
---
what a twist i found him  im museman143 friend me.
---
Also a little disappointing that the skin can be applied to any armor piece. If I wanted to put it on ultracite, let it still look like ultracite with the paint added to it.
---
I know a reliable way to dupe your pa pieces...
---
But won’t bother to share let Bethesda do their job rather then lurk for free bug test
---
I’m on xb1 during the week, get on between 8-8:30 pm EST. And I’m on most of the day during the weekend. My GT is the same as on here and I’d be happy to help you out. I’ve been thinking of doing the same thing. If you don’t find anyone else to help you out...hit me up.
---
Three star!  I've got 100's of one star!
---
(I've never seen a 3 star legendary since beta).
---
Wonderful that they're implementing this but the golf campers will have immunity as well
---
Also why would you be in the fo76 subreddit. Do you just come here to complain about people who enjoy the game? If so you must be REALLY bored to do that.
---
You can find ultra-light plans pretty easily from armor plan spawn locations. I've unlocked it for all chest/limb armor types through a variety of finding plans and scrapping.
---
Revelation AOD
---
I will be online in about an hour.
---
Just a means to FILTER vs sort would be better for all inventory tabs.
---
I’m at about 720 hrs, mostly all solo. It’s fun finding ransoms and teaming up occasionally just for an event or two. I don’t use a mic and get by just fine with the emotes.
---
While true, it was still on the fringe of society as a whole in the bigger picture of America. And unless everyone is playing a former soldier with stamps of different countries, etc, the original point still stands. 
---
Most people are going to want something other than American Traditional stamps.
---
Sour cream as well
---
I'm still trying to get the lvl 25 achievement. Kinda sucks it didnt autocomplete when we left beta.
---
Because Reddit is an echo chamber. Say the one thing that no one agrees with and BAM, you get hit with a shit ton of downvotes. Just remember that karma doesn't really matter and that if anyone disagrees with you, well that's their problem.
---
I'm not falling victim to it myself, but defending players teaming up to harass everyone in a server as it being the fault of the other people on the server for it is a bad take.
---
Responding inline on comments makes life slightly easier when chatting back and forth.
---
That’s a good idea 💡
---
Nothing, the whole theme of the game doesn't work if they are actually the bad guys . It was a pointless war over resources no one even really needed. It's supposed to be ironic that they are throwing thousands of soldiers running on fusion engines to destroy all life on earth to try to secure worthless oil.
---
This is where I'm setting my expectations:
---
* The vendor will have a small stash of tokens that refreshes each day.  
---
* You can trade in legendaries and get tokens at a rate of 1 token per star (excepting "Scorched Killer" weapon mods)  
---
* You can spend tokens to "re-roll" existing legendaries. Maybe it'll be better! Maybe it'll be trash!  
---
* Rerolling costs tokens equal to the star level of the item plus how many times you've rerolled the item that day.
---
Ditto.
---
Wait that’s a thing? And someone’s gone and spent money to use it on a game subreddit? Jesus christ
---
Okay, dunno what kinda dipshits you're playing with or why their grandmas play with them, but I seriously doubt they meant paid content or grindy fuckin bullshit they put in to make the paid content "okay"
---
Jack, Subject Delta, and Booker DeWitt approve of this suggestion.
---
I have a mic, but use emotes more. Sometimes, it's just easier to tell the lvl 2, "hey, there's a bag of stimpacks for you", than shooting the ground, teabagging it, jumping up and down, all while emoting "come here", and then watching them run off after a radrat.
---
I want them to bring back the *chance to send enemy flying, that was in fallout 4
---
It is classified as a rifle, meaning it can be quite powerful for rifleman builds. It also counts as a silenced weapon so with the mister sandman and covert operative perks the crossbow (especially a 2-3* legendary) is exceptionally deadly.
---
Nah, I've enjoyed it and been part of the community for a month. Just when I see people making ridiculous claims like 'best fallout ever' I feel the need to say something, since they are giving Bethesda a free pass to continue to make some of the worst games in the franchise. Blind defence does nothing.
---
Search for weight reducing items. , everyone is loosing their shit with their gears , cavaliers , sentinel , etc ...
---
I don’t care for pvp ( I’m not your kids babysitter )
---
And pve I do fine without those prefixes ...
---
Now the amazing gear , will make my character take over 800 lbs of stuff , whilst just showing my regular weight..
---
Voila extra stash space
---
Yeah, it should've been either cheaper for an individual skin, or that price for multiple versions of the skin for the different power armors
---
I'd think, given the extreme rarity of 3 star vs. 1 star, that rerolling or adding stars to an item would be exponentially more expensive the more stars you add, and turning in 3 stars would give exponentially more tokens than a 1 star. At least i hope that's how it works because I have 2 mules filled with 200+ 3 star legendaries each.
---
800 lbs is 363.2 kg
---
I bought the signs &amp; letters plan from someone on here for 4K.
---
Bad converter bot.  2300 lbs is 1040 Kg.
---
Boy, you should see the next 3. Maybe instead of uninstalling, you should grind for one of the better ones, later.
---
Or, you can just complain on here, I guess.
---
That's going to be me day 1 lol. I have like 10 pieces of gear that I want to reroll, and hundreds of 3 stars to trade in.
---
Fallout 4 is definitely my worst fallout, tied with 76. Complete railroad. No replay value.
---
Can I server hop to find plans for Buttressed marine chest for example?
---
Always useful drops to, like the Mole Miners so much delicious loot 😋
---
I'd say players who can solo the Sheepsquatch are an extreme edge case.
---
If it’s a direct copy of the FO4 asset then the helmet and outfit are one unit. All or none when wearing it unfortunately.
---
There is one in Fort Defiance (because asylum), one in a mobile home in Berkley Springs (because trailer park), and one in Pi House (because drunk frat boys).
---
Just make it so players cant damage buildings in adventure mode
---
From what I recall they did mention something about that, but I could've sworn I heard something about a flag being used in it. Maybe i'm just getting things mixed up. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a retexture of the flag so it was like a canvas which was painted to say "trading post" or something on it.
---
I haven’t been, strictly because I don’t like losing caps when I die. And you mentioning the chameleon mod is the first time I’ve heard a good reason to use them in PVP, so thank you.
---
I would love this.
---
&gt; (excepting "Scorched Killer" weapon mods)
---
You overestimate theur QA. They will leave this in for a few days, allowing a select few to stockpile a couple hundred thousand tokens before they fix it.
---
Make friends.
---
/r/fallout sure loves calling intentional mechanics of the game "griefing".
---
I actualy enjoy the robot npcs alot as well. The bonus is if they act stupid or do weird suff you can just say "there on the fritz!" Where as a human npc acting at all strange is just immersion breaking.
---
I've got a berserker explosive .50 cal which isn't worth using compared to any other explosive weapon, also it's damn easy to kill myself without armour.
---
Who knows, o get downvoted without any reason to, so maybe an system glisch or something. 🤣
---
Same. Except mine disappeared when i got kicked and rejoined
---
Thanks so much!  I finally found the camera and got the quest but the damned note isn't showing up in my inventory!
---
I did about 15 hops at the waterpark, no dice. I was going back from it to the graveyard to the monument, didn't find it at any. Almost an hour and a half wasted.
---
How? slap damage is off now.
---
As far as I remember from reading over the lore, America was the first to figure out properly miniaturized fusion power. China was the biggest rival to the US at the time because the resource wars in europe had decimated most other world powers, so they were the ones who ended up sending spies to the US to try to steal America's new 'key' to solving the world resource shortages.
---
America and China were already postured against one-another in a cold-war style showdown over their ideologies, and this spying likely is what began the fear campaign spread across the country by the government to vilify the chinese. All it took then was for China to invade Alaska once its resource shortages got dire and their spying was unsuccessful, and America fully retaliated.
---
I’ve got tons of legendaries, but have chucked half of them away because they were taking up too much of my stash
---
How many pipe pistols can you carry with a capacity of 800 lbs ?
---
Finally a use for the 3 star Furious Dragon and Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Gun.
---
Question: If we win can we donate caps to a charity of our choice? I want to donate to the relief fund of those Apexigod has destroyed.
---
It would be a nice feature. Course on the topic of consumables, would also be nice to be able to cook up canned foods to boost the benefits of them, while also adding on a Spoil meter. Take like the pork &amp; beans. Cooking it would change the model to like a white plate displaying the food that was inside (they do need to update the soups/stew models).
---
I (am pretty sure) I can solo Sheepsquatch with my HW build. Still working on a couple items for my concept but it already works fairly well.
---
You can solo sheepsquatch with level 5 armor, just needs 5 pieces of sentinal armor, and a good melee weapon. Then just pin yourself between the conduit and the stump right next to the conduit so you can't be staggered. Boom soloed it without even needing stimpacks.
---
the actually deployed water cooled machine guns in WW1 were all maxim designs and no one used water cooled ones in WW2. The only air cooled machine gun that had a jacket like that was the Lewis. 
---
The Lewis looks vaguely more rifely and that’s it. Maybe the pistol grip is more similar to the Lewis but it’s based on the maxim. You’re free to think whatever you want and I don’t care, but it doesn’t mean you’re not wrong.
---
Lost mine to and that Veil of mysteries thing plus lots of other stuff, I’m pretty sure it is just my ‘fumble fingers’ hitting the wrong keys and dumping them into bags then walking off 🙂
---
Isn't even just the chameleon mod, by not uncrouching, you also don't show up on the world map for people to find you.
---
Yea fuck green light i want nice white light, I was using the miners hat for a wile till I found my tinfoil hat.
---
Why is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgom54/psa_serious_game_breaking_bug_involving_camera/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)  getting downvoted
---
you should look them over. I had several 2 and 3 star items I did not know I had till I went on my mule and actually looked at each one in inventory.
---
Dam thats sux id help you but I'm on ps4
---
But in survival, you don’t show up anyway...
---
get bent...
---
Current workshop PVP mechanic is broken in adventure, it's halfway into PVP, but not quite there.
---
Bethesda haven't thought it well through and we ended up with non-pvp Adventure mode where you can be killed anywhere on the map if you have workshop, rather than being limited to, well, workshop.
---
And all PVP encounters from it are usually 1-2 shot death while you yourself cannot even put a dent on other player, you cannot even call it pvp, it's player versus broken game mechanics.
---
They didn't invade Mama Dolces, MD has always been a commie front, with the hidden mission of slowly killing the USA with junk food.
---
How is that “the right thing” to do?
---
It’s sad how true this is.
---
Yeah, but the melee build can do it with level 5 armor and not need a single stimpack. Just put 5 pieces of any type of sentinal armor in each slot, then use your melee weapon while having yourself pinned against the conduit and stump next to it so you can't be staggered.
---
Fo76 was mostly a flop because of how buggy it was, how overpowered weapons are, and the duplicating that came with the bugs. I love fo76 but not for its story. It's fun to me because of the multiplayer and pvp aspects that I've wanted in a fallout style game. They're not really known for their multiplayer so I'm not surprised that it has so many problems, I do expect them to get better as time goes on though. But saying people are giving them a free pass by playing their game because they like it isnt bad.
---
Get a hazmat suit or power armour. The Poseidon Nuclear Plant has some damaged hazmat suits inside and maybe a normal one if your lucky. Best bet though is using power armour with some rad x.
---
Same. I just sold rad-x since it killed mutations. This is a game changer.
---
It depends on the mod? Some are scrap only, some are plan only, and some can be gotten both ways. There used to be a lot more plan resources you could find from vendors before patch 5. Now it's RNG hell.
---
I think buttressed might be scrap only, or at least I haven't seen a plan for it yet.
---
&gt; oh and make an alt if you run out of space on your main character 
---
I lucked out. My daughter got the game and did not like it, so I have her account. I can double-run the game to transfer to my mules without burning alt slots.
---
Was it a two-star?  Picked one up from a train station vendor yesterday.
---
I meant before the slap nerf. I never did it but I've played with people that could kill you with one if you didn't heal.
---
The point you're making is you're an entitled little bitch who expects Bethesda to keep this game running by paying their employees in all the free atoms were giving back to them. It's a cosmetic, grow up.
---
Don't have to scrap to get welded first, then tempered then Buttressed or can I just randomly get Buttressed?
---
Now this is just a suggestion, but hear me out.
---
As you said, it would be nice to get cheese, but also how about cream? That stuff doesn't spoil and I've been carrying like 16 bottles of it. With that said, given that we have razorgrain flour, we should be able to combine it with boiled water or purified water to make bread. If we could use tatos to make a sauce we could even make a pizza. After all, we find pizza trays at various locations. Even cramburgers could benefit from a razorgrain bread bun and brahmin cheese.
---
When ZOS announces that ring crafting in ESO was coming, people hoarded /bought rings to save up. When ring crafting was released it only applied to rings gathered after the patch. 
---
Waaanh waaah!
---
Sooo much wasted hoarding. 
---
I am not hoarding legendaries.  They’re not that hard to get.
---
The actual hat to wear ? Or plans to make them?
---
Yeah, resources per ammo ratio per damage for fuel is far outside of avg on charts =\
---
You sure it’s not just the broken camera you scrap? I get lots of those
---
Yes you do if you are on the leaderboard.
---
I ended up doing a kind of "flexible Bloodied" build where I tend to hover around 40-50% HP, but can go lower if I'm against something tough.  My Bloodied Power Fist is normally around 800 at 40% HP, which is more than enough to kill pretty much anything short of boss characters.  I've seen it get as high as \~1800 around 10%, but then you get into that survivability problem, and I'm not big on dying.
---
That’s a good point, and an all too real example. That’s 100% the reason I stopped going to vault 76 or camping at the overseers camp. I like helping new players but it’s almost too early at that point. I would rather they fuck around for hours first figuring things out, then I’ll dump them a bunch of ammo, aid, and plans
---
I finally got the damned thing. If you're on PS4 right now, you can add me, it's at Bolton Greens. PSN: treswatson
---
They broke their cosmetic only promise, then they heard all the negative backlash from the community but said FUCK IT let's add gameplay enhancers anyway, because they know the backlash will die off eventually,they're counting on it. I hope every gaming youtuber picks this story up and absolutely roasts them for it! My god,it's like Bethesda got so used to controversy, it's the only thing that gets them hard at this point! Just look at blades and what a turd sandwich that's turned out to be
---
When i did it the "nuka-cole room" and frat house together gave me 53 bottles. So yea.. Good tip here.
---
And does crouching negate that if you’re on the leaderboard? If so, that should be fixed.
---
The game is absolute garbage, yes it’s fun up until about level 100. Then there is absolutely nothing to do, at that point you will most likely have your build and legendaries you want. PvP is an absolute disaster there are people that shred me in 3 seconds and I have armor that reduces all damage and damage from players on top of that by like 135% when standing still. (Assassins sentinel) 
---
Now Bethesda are adding repair boxes in the atomic shop that breaks their promise of it being only cosmetic items. This sub has been dying since I first started playing. It’s true this community is still active but not NEARLY as active as it used to be.
---
You should ask somewhere else, nobody in this community will say anything bad about the game because everyone just downvotes it. They are very biased and don’t consider how bad the game has been since launch, how long it takes developers to fix issues, and the devs flat out lying about stuff.
---
I guess I should do that, thanks for the tip.
---
Good idea, but 'Nah, Atoms'.
---
Bulking has increased my stash space. I do this frequently. 🙂
---
That, I don't know for sure.
---
double please
---
Ops first line is they are a big defender of Bethesda.
---
I 100% believe people are allowed to enjoy the game. Hell, I did until the last patch dropped and any love I had died.
---
But maybe if people stop defending a giant corporation for their repeated blunders, shit will actually get better.
---
Lolol
---
Judging by this interaction you probably don’t actually know what that is either.
---
By reporting a bug? Do you not realize how these things work?
---
Yep, everyone will have it so everyone is a potential buyer of camera skins.  They're probably kicking themselves for putting the original camera system in the game, as it it takes away from this one.
---
Just the hat, I don't think I've seen plans for it. The wiki also doesn't give a recipe.
---
True, these weren't very good weapons or armor. I think I only got one weapon that wasn't half bad and a piece of Assassin's armor (neither one 3* however).  Otherwise, there were a lot of tire irons , wood armor, and rolling pins.  However, I stored them away for the legendary vendor rollout, so it's a nice little collection for that.  And I didn't get a single drill or syringer, so that was nice.
---
Yes, crouching takes you off the map just like in adventure mode.
---
Yup this is the best thing to do. It’s a harmless glitch in my book. Just saves you the chore of using rad x rad away and healing or nuka grapes.
---
ranged bloody builds are pretty fun too. A gun-runner pistoleer with gun-fu is Roland the Gunslinger in a target rich environment.
---
I just wish a quad bloody single action with fast reload was possible. But with bloodied a 10mm or pipe pistol works great, and they can have large fast reload magazines.
---
Few options, new players typically choose either hazmat suit or power armor, 2nd more advance way is to have a teammate with rad sponge perk card.
---
I just drop stims/radaway at overseers, and everything else at flatwoods now. They're on their own at that point, lol.
---
Gotta horde something.
---
i'm on  pc
---
 how do you  install that?
---
While you're at it, add a chem tab.  Or at the least let us sort by favorited items.
---
If we got a mailbox system as well I could see some Prewar Messenger like the Messenger bot showing up each day to deliver the daily mail which could come in the form of burnt magazine (and some usable ones), packages (from players), that boost you mentioned, and maybe even a subscription to some "Nuka of the Week" or "Beer of the Week" group. Given that the messenger bot is rather timely it could be that the daily would just stack up over the days you don't collect it (the bonus would have to be limited though to a 1x the bonus for checking it to avoid abuse).
---
Yeah, my TSE .50 cal max level disappeared from my inventory too. Ridiculous.
---
All and any mods
---
It’s not, people have had this issue for a long time now.
---
I agree 100%.
---
They will keep turning the dial down on legendaries until players start to leave and then they'll turn it back up a notch. It's sad what corporations have done to videogames.
---
Won't bother me then. The outfit is freakin' awesome as.
---
I'd be okay with buffing diseases if (and this is a big *if*), it was possible to reliably avoid getting most of them.  Right now, even with Vaccinated, you'll still get them with alarming frequency.  The Mole Rat will spring up and nip your leg.  The Feral Ghoul will register a hit even if you dodged it.  Diseases are just a fact of life in melee.  You'll have one pretty much all the time.
---
You should apply for a job with Bethesda and fix everything for them, you genius you.
---
You can do it manually by adding it into your data folder in your FO76 install and then you have to add it to the custompref document that can also be downloaded right there and add it into it. Or just use this mod manager: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/221
---
I lost all the stable flux from Sunday night. Still a little salty about that.
---
Faction tatts like star ship strooper lookin brotherhood tatt or skull raider sleeve.
---
Forgivable as a mistake, sure, except that they've made no effort to address it (beyond "not intended"), correct it, or compensate people for it. Taken together it feels less like a mistake.
---
I've Never upvoted so fast in my life
---
I do it for easier inventory management. I don't need plastic for repairs, so I'd rather see sellable bulk over loose junk.
---
Ammo converter will be coming to an atomic shop near you! But really though they listed when they announced repair kits they were planning refrigerators and ammo converters too but likely to be part of atomic shop since they related more to make game easier and they don't consider it pay to win.
---
I bulk things to sell  
---
You cannot tell you dont do the supply drop event and take the 100 pre war money
---
If you are on PC the "better inventory mod" does exactly that.
---
Get in the habit of putting the goo in your stash on the way to the workbench.
---
Bulking all of your junk is not a good option, whether you're doing it manually or all at once. Without Pack Rat only two junk types benefit from bulking and with Pack Rat if you're carrying enough junk to make it worth the permanent investment of perk points then you need to stop carrying so much junk.
---
It's been this way for several patches.
---
is there an announced date yet? I know it was delayed...I think until May 9 maybe?
---
I'm guessing they will do a traditional buy/sell spread like they do with caps. You get one token per star on trade-in, but to re-roll a 3-star will be like 30 tokens or something.
---
I just hate it in a way because now I won't be able to find random legendaries dropped all over the map or sold to vendors. I've gotten every weapon I own from a vendor where someone either didn't know how good the item was or just didn't need it. Like my TSE Gatling Plasma I bought for 400-ish caps...
---
It's been 5 from the very begining... on all platforms
---
Unless all you're bulking is lead and aluminum, no it isn't.
---
The mod, Better Inventory, needs to be made into base game and include Stash.
---
Ohh great... more server hopping then.  
---
It's like they are stress testing login-logout system with cameraman and now with legend vendor.
---
I'm lvl 121 and I don't PVP. It's people like that with nothing better to do that make low lvl players avoid me. I have plans, ammo, and aid i'm willing to give but they just run away. Sometimes i'll collect a full suit of low level PA so I can drop it for someone in need.
---
antibiotics?
---
u/yellowspaces have you completed the camera quest yet?
---
My new theory is that I can’t rename it because the camera is currently marked as a quest item. Gonna finish that quest and report back.
---
Or even better...  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31088/](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31088/)
---
Sorry, but I'm on PC
---
Funny that you mention those quest worked fine ( relating the camera quest ) but the weekly challenge itself it’s bugged and impossible due to zetans nor sheepsquatch being in the game ( as right now )
---
I am not an impluse buyer. I like to take a little time and think about purchases. With stash limits you must consider carefully what you collect. Previous fallout games did not have such limits and collections could become massive. Player homes even had armory's to display weapons, armor and various outfits you had found. Doing this in 76 is impossible.
---
You could do the same thing with a gun though.
---
You sure about that? I could have sworn I was getting 80+ per kill in silo last week, and I do a lot of nukes.
---
So, in everyone's opinion, are 2 and 3 stars the only ones really worth stashing? I'd love to free up stash-space and dump the one stars I've been hoarding.  I sorta went all Hoarders on them not knowing exactly how the vendor will play out.

What happened to China? Reports uncertain. China may be fictional.MOIRA BROWN TERMINAL ENTRIES
---
China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), was a country in Asia before the Great War. China was the primary rival of the United States during the twenty-first century, with the U.S. having developed relatively warm diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union during the twentieth century in the Fallout universe. It was a military and economic superpower, able to fully compete with the U.S., and was consistently portrayed as an equal to America. For instance, China attempted to be the first to drill out the last sources of petroleum in the world.[1] It is implied that Americans sabotaged this attempt and, that without such sabotage, the Chinese would have been successful. In addition, China developed the unique 'Hei Gui' stealth armor that the United States military reverse-engineered with the deployment of its unstable, wrist-mounted Stealth Boys.
---
Political system
---
In 2077, China was a socialist nation with single-party rule.[2] The ruling political party was the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Two leaders of the nation have been mentioned, President Xin and Chairman Cheng, and it is unknown which account is more reliable. It is possible that China's last head of state before the Great War was President Xin, while Chairman Cheng was the leader of the CCP. The last Chinese Ambassador to the United States was Xiu-Ling.[3]
---
Background
---
Prior to the Sino-American War
---
In 1927, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Republic of China and a communist revolutionary movement. The conflict was briefly suspended in 1937 when the Second Sino-Japanese War began, carrying on into World War II and ending in 1945. In 1949, the Civil War ended with Mao Zedong and his communist revolutionaries victorious. On October 1st, the People's Republic of China was established. All remaining supporters of the Republic of China fled to the island of Formosa. Due to the divergence, the status of Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet and autonomous regions are unknown.
---
Relations were strained with China even before the Sino-American War, as it raced with the United States to tap the last remaining oil fields deep beneath the Pacific Ocean. The work of Chinese geologists and petroleum exploration engineers was sabotaged by American spies, allowing the United States' energy company Poseidon Oil to erect an Oil Rig of their own and claim the resource. The strained relations eventually led to the Chinese invasion of Alaska in 2066, where the Anchorage Front Line became the first and most important battlefield.
---
Sino-American War (2066-2077)
---
￼Chinese military banner as seen in Operation: Anchorage.
---
The exact details on China as a nuclear powerin the Fallout universe are sketchy at best. It is not actually known how many nuclear weapons or of what types China brought to the final blasts of the Great War or even if it was the only country launching nuclear weapons at the United States, which was at that time in the midst of resource disputes with many other nations.
---
2066: Chinese forces under the leadership of General Jingweisuccessfully invaded Alaska, claiming its pipeline and oil reserves for Beijing.
---
2067: The Anchorage Reclamationcommenced, with the first suits of T-45d power armor deployed there.
---
2073: China became increasingly aggressive in the war, using biological weapons against American forces.[4]
---
2074: American T-45d power armor units, conventional infantry, and mechanized infantry divisions outfitted with the power armor were deployed to China as part of an American counter-invasion of Chinese territory, but they became bogged down on the mainland, putting a further drain on American resources and supply lines.
---
2076: The advanced T-51b power armorfinally finished its development cycle, and the first mechanized infantry unit outfitted in this version of power armor was sent to China. The new armor allowed these troops to finally carve a swath through Chinese forces. Chinese supply lines from the East and Southeast Asian nations China had annexed began to break down. Shortly after, the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing were occupied by US forces.
---
2077: At some point, one of the nuclear powers began launching nuclear weapons. This resulted in a massive retaliatory response that culminated in the Great War on October 23, 2077.
---

---
Infiltration of the Eastern Seaboard
---
Chinese commandos infiltrated mainland America during the Sino-American War, in order to spy on and sabotage the American war effort. Their focus was Washington, D.C., which they penetrated under the cover of Mama Dolce's factory and L.O.B. Enterprises, supported by several Chinese special forces teams. A large amount of Chinese arms were also covertly transported to the American capital city, possibly in order to equip communist sympathizers and Chinese sleeper agents and spark an insurrection that would severely affect the American ability to effectively wage war. Two agents, Agent Wan Yang and Agent Jiang, had infiltrated Point Lookout to destroy the Chinese sub SSN-37-1A that sank in American waters. The side quest The Velvet Curtain deals with this directly.
---
Attempted sabotage of Hoover Dam
---
￼The following is based on Van Burenand has not been confirmed by canonsources.
---
Shortly before the Great War started in 2077, a Chinese infiltration and sabotage team discovered the Hoover Dam secret genetics laboratory - Classified Sub-Level 1C - and tried to destroy Hoover Dam, so the genetic work could never be used against them. Some of the Chinese stealth soldiers made it into Sub-Level 1C, while others were planting bombs in the main generator rooms - Scum Pits. One of the bombs went off prematurely and alerted all of Hoover Dam, including the guards in S1C. Things become cloudy in the reports due to the chaos that ensued, but suffice it to say that the Chinese were defeated, the generators were heavily damaged, and S1C was compromised. A couple of Chinese stealth soldiers and four scientists were trapped in S1C after the hatch was sealed. The Prisoner could find the soldiers there and use the materials from their stealth armor to make his own armor.[5]
---
Infiltration of Limit-115 Laboratory
---
Chinese Hei Gui units managed to steal Limit-115 samples during the Hoover raid, but they were killed in Denver in a crowded public area, breaking the vials with the virus, unleashing the New Plague on Denver.
---
Good for what? I cannot think of a use for one. Any radium rifle has some viability for countering bloodied builds, but supressors doesn't really add to that.

Lists just don't work well in this type of game. Sick of scrolling for eternity to find stuff and accidentally scrapping stuff. We're in 2019 not 1999.
---
What's even worse are the people defending this crap,they're like religious Zealot's and just shrug off the backlash as "haters". guess what? Most of the haters have moved on, the backlash is from you're fellow players like myself who don't enjoy being lied to and are trying to help you! If you don't want to help that's fine but please don't get in our way by defending this crap
---
Does that fo4 mod actually work with fo76?
---
dude, I am not an expert on the matter, I googled the matter and know what my eyes tell me, the gun looks fucking similar to the Lewis gun *and* the Vickers, you are being a pretentious cunt acting all superior on the matter, so, get bent asshole...
---
i laugh in my 15 endurance
---
Yea. I do that until I’m on a daunting scrap run and forget to drop the goo before scrapping.
---
Theoretically all mods are not allowed, but in this game many people use mods and don't get banned - including me ;) I use silent camp (silence turrets and generators) and white wall for brick set (they look much better). Both those mods only change textures on client side, so other visiting my camp see dirty walls and hear turrets.
---
Nope, the melee build is needed due to the staggering, ranged builds can't keep the sheepsquatch in stagger mode like melee can with power attacks.
---
Not once have I ever read a single post in reading this sub daily since beta that supports your claim that people were asking for these kits in the same way ESO had them. 
---
All of the things that you assert need junk outside of repairs are luxury items or gameplay choices that are not necessary to successfully complete all content of the game. Repairs are the only thing that we absolutely need to do in order to continue playing the game with our settled kit.
---
This is not an exaggeration or an alarmist claim, it is how the game works.
---
Your camp, ammo, mods, etc... Are all not required to play this game. You don't need to build an armor and weapons workbench if you never have to repair.
---
I am sorry you feel this is alarmist, but you are twisting it into that. What I am claiming is entirely possible now.
---
We left the beta?
---
Ok thanks I’ll go looking.
---
Yeah, not correcting it right away is the part I can't condone. They need a better downstream of community reported bugs to the current coding team. But like I mentioned, I don't have that weekly anymore, so they may have removed it (I don't think weekly challenges reset on Thursaday's, do they?).
---
I think it depends on if a fix requires down time or not. If they can fix it with no downtime, looks like they do it, albeit not as quickly as we'd like.

If it requires a patch I think they let it sit until they have a large patch to reduce down time. That line of thought kind of makes sense logistically as we've seen patches undo other patches, but you're right on the need for compensation. If there's 40 Atoms of challenges not completeable, 40 Atoms should go into everyone's bank regardless of how long the fix takes.
---
what does pre war money have anything to do with bulking junk?
---
Not really "amazing", more like "how it used to be"
---
They should have made it exactly like adventure mode but with less pvp restrictions. Having train stations as the only spawn point was just a bad idea. Of course people are going to spawn camp.
---
If you are over level 250 then you have certainly already gotten your money's worth of entertainment. Beth has graphic artists and programmers that need to get paid to keep busy. I think that everyone would agree that if there wasn't an Atom shop at all that would be much worse.
---
Sunny top train station is the worst, people are able to build a camp on the exact spot you spawn, so people build a ton of missile turrets that insta kill you has you spawn
---
Unfortunately not.   
---
That mod was a total game changer. New categories in the Pip boy + coloured thumbnails saved me so many times trying to scroll through endless lists and not accidentally drop or scrap things.
---
While this mod was great, really the game needs a total UI overhaul bringing it into 2019. The pip boy UI is almost the same as the first Fallout lol.
---
Ive got a few I'd like to reroll. 3 star versions of stuff I like. Pole hook. A Dragon. Gatlimg plasma. That kinda thing. 
---
Still hunting and storing good stuff on a mule character to sell/trade. Also kinda thinking about turning him into a player made quest giver. 
---
He's slow as hell from being over encumbered and can only use level 15 stuff. Classic escort mission material.
---
plastic is used in more than just repairs, for instance shotgun shells take plastic.  and all my junk is in my stash, not much need for management beyond the occasional dumping of some of the stacks that get too high
---
Yes, and don't believe anyone who says it is okay. ANY AND ALL MODS are bannable.
---
The fact that what's essentially a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet is being offered as an "Unstoppable Monster" would suggest they are fine with Bloodied as it is right now.
---
It's a good, high damage build.  But you don't see everyone running it either because it rightfully entails a certain amount of risk (and against specific PvP builds, it is of dubious value).
---
There are a couple gun perks that give you stagger.
---
It has increased their stash space by using all their plastic. It'd be the same if they just threw the plastic on the ground.
---
The game is a jumbled pile of bugs and glitches but it's the only game that's been able to keep me playing since release, love the game :)
---
Why is that good?
---
Upvote this to upvote heaven please
---
Yeah, chance to stagger, power melee attacks are 100% staggers.
---
I can not think of a single scenario where I would ever want to bulk all. This seems to be a completely useless function.
---
I go there for the SB nest, you can find some Ultracite in them
---
Build your base in a secluded spot, respawn there.  There is a lot of walking in survival.
---
Yeah, I'm an unarmed, non-pa, mutated abomination of all the is natural. I'm a special case when it comes junk requirements.
---
I’m expecting whatever system to suck, but to be broken and exploitable for the first few days.  It will be the equivalent of gambling to reroll legendaries.  I expect you to reroll the whole thing too, which sux, vs 1 of the stars.  I also expect the tokens to be sold on the atom shop.
---
Why would we ever want to bulk everything? This seems like a waste of plastic.
---
I'm running around with my excavator armor cuz my stash is full of shitty 2 star and 3 star legendaries 🤣🤣 so I'm encumbered as hell lol
---
Wait so does that mean if I used **Diluted** Rady-Away and Rad-X I can remove my starched genes perk and be okay?
---
Can I get a fast pass?
---
Wait this isn't a thing? I don't usually trade with players but I had assumed that it would work the same as vendors. I agree this is something that should be added. 100%
---
where ? any place ?
---
It sounds like welded is known by default. The tempered, hardened, and buttressed mods can be learned by scrapping and don't have plans. Here's a link for the source:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout\_76\_all\_plans\_recipes\_weapons\_weapon\_mods/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
Ohhh. Damn, I totally misunderstood their purpose. 
---
Thanks.
---
You have no clue how much time or effort they put into this so don't talk out of your ass as if you do. This shit didn't get delayed a week because they had the entire dev team working on it for months and needed a week of overtime to finally push it out. It's a fucking quality of life addition, you may not appreciate it but people out there who thought having to fumble through the selfie mode just to take a simple "in the moment" picture was stupid appreciate being able to quickly pull out the damn thing and click.
---
Sadly lots of times when bugs like this exist they don't get fixed until they go public. By putting this out in the public it forces them to fix it instead of ignore it.
---
&gt; it's LIMITED TIME ONLY so I have no chance
---
Lack of planning on your part does not constitute a crisis on anyone else's part.  Shoulda had some Atoms saved up.
---
That sucks!!☹ my friend lost his 3star tse shotgun yesterday. We all offered him some of our best stash weapons but he was so upset he barely spoke the whole session... it sucks for us too. He tore some stuff up with that thing
---
Nuka cola room must have been hit and wiped out befoe I hit it then.  I didn't find a single empty bottle there
---
If it's not independent thought, it's collective thought. That sounds an awful lot like dirty commie talk, *citizen*.
---
I’m not being pretentious, I’m just telling you you’re wrong and offered examples as to why. You’re the one getting butthurt because the side profile picture of a gun you googled looks slightly more rifely and someone called you on it.
---
You were wrong, I pointed it out, and now you’re cranky and lashing out with insults.
---
American flag, and the 2 tents of different sizes
---
Fixing this for you:
---
Fallout \*
---
HOARD EVERYTHING
---
I’d be happy with a small amount of atoms.
---
Just saying - plastic can go for 1-3 caps per.
---
bro, the assault rifle in Fallout 4/76 is a completely made up design that takes cues from both guns, more the Lewis in my opinion, you can fuck right off trying to act like you are right about a fucking fictitious gun!  get bent cunt.
---
I think I'll stick to adventure mode. My wife and I like having our camps close to each other. I also lost 400 caps trying to find these people lol. I'm good on that.
---
Piercing is a good choice too - 35 rounds and some armor pen.  As long as you have Tank Killer too.  I find Perforating a bit limiting at 20 rounds.
---
It’s been fine for me.
---
And the official stance from Bethesda is:  
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/kw/mod](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod) 
---
Yeah, your game might not function properly if you do. That is what their stance is. Nothing about banning. Nothing about it being disallowed. But your game might not work properly. So yeah, go ahead. A lot of people are angry about it because they are on console and can't use it, but... as long as you accept that the game might not work properly, especially after a patch before the mod updates, there is no risk.
---
&gt; I didn't have enough screws to repair some of my workbenches, generators, and purifiers. 
---
You really did get screwed.  Literally.  😋
---
Until Bethesda makes the CAMPs immune to other players, here are a couple things to keep in mind:
---
* You can replace your CAMP without any material cost by just using Move CAMP in the Pip-Boy.  Move your CAMP just a small distance from where it currently is, pay your Caps, and everything will be repaired.  Now, the caveat is that if your CAMP isn't simple (i.e. build on as few foundations as possible), it may be impossible to replace the blueprint.  Bethesda is planning to change this in Patch 9 so it's easier to replace.  But if you can't, you still have the option to scrap your blueprint, which breaks it down into its individual parts so you can manually rebuild it.
---
* If you take a Workshop, hostile players can attack you *anywhere in the world*.  It's almost never worth doing.  Trust me.  There are other ways to get the resources you need.
---
Yeah what did they think would happen you know?
---
Nice, my character looks extremely similar, lol. Gotta rock the red hair and freckles
---
Sometimes, I dream of cheese...
---
Right? We were in a war with Russia and all they ever really did was be our allies in WWII and be communist. I mean, that's a bit of an oversimplification of one of the biggest conflicts the world has seen, but still. When two superpowers are completely at odds with each other as a basis of society, it doesn't take much to tip a scale.
---
I think it depends on your playstyle and how much the game costs.  If you play Fallout 4 with a lot of mods and a hoard of items then 76 might not be for you yet.  Like others have said the game is still buggy and lacks mod support.  You also might run into weight restriction frustrations if you are a collector kind of player especially early on.
---
Now that being said the game has a lot of cool stuff to explore and can be a lot of fun but just know it has it's flaws still.
---
Diluted rad-away has a chance to nuke your mutations.
---
Diluted radx never suppresses the mutations.
---
It's preference mostly I don't mind reloading a bit more as long as I get more dmg per bullet
---
He did for months. How long does he have to keep repeating the same thing over and over to idiots who don't listen and just downvote and troll?
---
Um, in the real world Japan was nuked for an attack on US territory. The Chinese in Fallout actually invaded a US State in a world which functions on McCarthyism as US foreign policy.
---
What I know is you should be able asking customer support, because no one on reddit is going to know any more than you unless you're just bored and trying to stir up shit
---
It being a first world issue doesn't mean it isnt an issue. Yes they could have done worse.
---
They still can. People seem to think repair kits are as bad as it will ever get. This is only the beginning.
---
I have 5 of them.. you can have one for free
---
IGN: Aleoso
---
Someone mentioned on some other post about Ella's bunker, claiming they had collected over 40 there. Tested it for 26 bottles. Which is not so bad also if you hate server hopping.
---
Yeah i know, thats why i mentioned it would be annoying. But if he wants to clear up the misconception, being silent doesn't help. And thats why i suggested copying and pasting a generic tldr of his side. Makes everything easier.
---
I really hope this will be adressed soon.
---
Also don't forget the weapon mod Plans, they went missing the same time (Night Vision Scopes and Ammo type changing Receivers).
---
It seems like easy to fix because it already was in the game, they just bugged it with one patch weeks (or months) ago. While i can not understand why it takes so long to fix, what i really don't understand is that they do not communicate anything regarding this issue.
---
Please Bethesda let some people fix this and/or let us know that you are working on this, and when we can expect a fix.
---
Rofl ty 👍
---
Enclave has its own armor. It needs to spawn as legendary
---
The handmade isn't the fastest to reload - on an assault rifle I'd go perforating in a heartbeat.  Mostly a concern if you have multiple enemies provoked.
---
Cannibalizer satisfies hunger per shot landed
---
?
---
Lol just putting it on the radar. I know I'm not the only one that appreciates cosmetics that don't glitch
---
No thanks.
---
Oh I gotcha! I had always wondered why my mutations stopped working in blasts zones. Now it makes sense haha. So use starched genes when I need to use a rad-away but always used diluted rad-x to avoid suppressing your mutations.
---
That's probably close to what it will look like. I'm guessing the tokens will share the same non-transferable mechanics as repair kits.
---
Not sure (I found the vendor without even server hopping), but I've seen at least 1 post where someone claimed that the item is the same one you need for the quest.
---
No, curious as well. Probably should start hounding them like I did about two figurines I ordered that took about 6 months to finally get, with them being pushed back three months from original date they said would be released.
---
I was camping the fissure site by whitesprings and that bitch came out of know where and turned a sentry bot, 2 assualtrons, and 2 protectrons against me along with the scorched and scorch beast
---
Uh....... *sweats*  LOOK OVER THERE! SUPERMUTANTS!
---
Hmmm, what would an angry person w/ launch codes do?
---
And everyone in guild chat won't stop talking about "pay day" for their 28th daily login.
---
That's exactly what I'm saying. It's understandable that they make mistakes, everyone does.  I don't know the logistics of how broken challenges are fixed and it's entirely possible it requires a patch which can't be implemented immediately. That's fine, I get that. The problem is that they aren't addressing it, keep making the same mistakes, and don't appear to have a plan to compensate anyone. I'm not even asking for them to give us the atoms for free- just the opportunity to re-run those challenges (in addition to the current ones) now that the camera has been implemented would be fine.
---
The fact that in-game atoms becoming more difficult and then literally impossible to obtain is happening simultaneously with the "we know we said cosmetic only but that was just a lie" controversy really tastes foul. You'd think with the fraught launch this game had they'd be bending over backwards trying to avoid bad press, but apparently not.
---
I love this game and I really want to recommend it to my friends, but they aren't making it easy.
---
You need to complete "an ounce of prevention" please use google in the future.
---
Yeah, im entirely unsure what the nuke launcher was trying to accomplish. There where no legendaries and very few flux.
---
I agree, otherwise all the people on this thread with thousands of pounds of legendaries, will immediately get top-tier god-rolled gear, and the game will be broken once again.
---
Why did you remove this post?
---
I don't expect that we'll be able to add stars to gear.
---
Isn't the recipe for that the a reward for some part of the main quest? The one down at the hospital I think?
---
i think everyone is having these issues, no matter what platform
---
ps4/xbox/pc/gameboy
---
they all seem to have severe performance issues after the last 2-3 patches unfortunately
---
YES! Thank you! I was just saying to someone the other day who wanted to sell me a legendary assault rifle that had the effects I wanted, but I straight up told him I didn't want it because I think the current AR is too ugly and therefore only use Handmade rifles. I never touched it in FO4 either.
---
My stash box is full of 2 and 3 * legendaries and im at 498/500 with my excavator power armor on
---
I hope not, I just hope they do what most other games do when introducing a service loke this, and make all legendaries found before the vendor appears ineligible for trade in
---
Same here, no issues. I have been getting booted a bit more often, but it seems more like a server wide thing when it happens. Though I have been able to play for hours on end without being booted.
---
yeah its across all platforms unfortunately
---
its gotten really bad recently
---
very disappointing from a AAA game company
---
I play on PS4 but if I owned the game on PC I would change the icon back over to the BETA icon just for shits and giggles. If anything at least I would get a little chuckle inside every time I started the game. I might even start to convince myself it really is still the BETA and not get so upset.
---
Easy fix, don't trade with other players, I'm waiting for player vending, assuming it's implemented right.
---
Todd makes us all betas by logining in each day
---
And yet, recognising that they could've done worse and that this is a first world issue, you're still gonna complain.
---
Everything in this sub gets downvoted for no reason
---
English is not my primary language.
---
Data-miners discovered this so, so long ago... and you decided to start saving up to it now? Yeah. No. Sorry buddy. I have saved for this one since I heard about it, and I bought it and the new plushie and still have atom for later use.  Plan ahead.
---
Papa Nurgle is disappointed in your economy planning. Always save ahead.
---
Is razorgrain flour used for anything?
---
Oh btw I can rename mine on PS4. Maybe you just need the 105?
---
Limited time doesn't mean it's limited time forever. Start saving now and hopefully by the time you can afford it, it will have returned.
---
The Fasnact donut!
---
you are a special type of stupid arent you?
---
In all honesty... this has been happening for a while now. Prior 2 patches, or even longer.. I honestly don't know.  
---
Interesting thought, and kind wish that this was true... or could be true.  
---
But best I can really think of is... it's a visual bleed/visual glitching.   
---
[Is this what you're talking about?](https://imgur.com/gallery/be7Ot1U)
---
... no stimpacks? So someone else is taking the conduits then? And, yeah, just 5 pieces of some of the rarest armor in the game and some cheese mechanics. Which also aren’t unique to melee- rifles users could do the same. Hell HW could too they’d just miss out on their Armor Piercing.

My bet: trade 30 3 star legendary weapons and get a one star rolling pin

Once I realized how much camp space she took up, I had to put ol buttercup down. 😔

I've noticed this as well.  Nuclear Winter is coming.

"Just needs 5 pieces of Sentinel armor."

You say that like it's so easy to get, everyone should have a full set in their stash.

Easy to get if you're all about pay-to-win, I guess.

The white ground bug thing happens rarely but almost all of the time it snows like 10 secs after fast traveling/entering a world
---
The dozens of people who play will be overjoyed.
---
Looks like its just rendering in. I see purple trees when I first travel in, and then they change to their natural color as it renders in more fully.
---
I tried that when I first noticed the issue. I got nowhere
---
Instead of throwing them on the ground, I have been putting them in my stash
---
Don't know if you're being unreasonably mean orrrrrr...
---
I've never played any live mmo games before but it makes total sense to do that. But it might be hard for them to do it if they don't have unique ID's for items. Maybe that's one of the things they intend to implement along with the vendor.
---
Add sprinkles for just 300 atoms.
---
yes and the game doesn't prevent you from selling when you hit this number. so be careful.
---
I'm doing this week's one, I get all the supplies and weapons ready to scrap and hop into the PVP server, do the work real quick and then hop back to the PVE server.  So far I only have one more challenge to do for the Action Hero gun, and that's to make some explosive ammo.  I recommend locking the doors on your CAMP to slow someone down and if needed bail on the server if you see someone coming.
---
i hope theyre temporary skins remain temporary, i dont want others to get my black bird skin, i like it showing how long ive played the game
---
Who cares? Just don't buy that crap.
---
I searched diluted radaway recipe fo76. It was the first link.
---
Understandable then, but you still give the impression that you really did not "play" the game but rather rushed through things or took the easy way that most normal players wouldn't have.
---
I'm not saying you did anything like that but that's the impression the post gives.
---
You're "already overpowered" ... how so? Explain?
---
Maybe I'm missing something.
---
Same, got word mine was approved for replacement.  No word since then.
---
Just an opinion buddy thanks for your feedback.
---
They did it with the Easter eggs already. And those were one time limited items.
---
Lol. Your opinion is objectively wrong.
---
The best way is to grab some Power Armor.  You can grab a Hazmat Suit but you won't have any damage resistances aside from radiation.  Or if you are brave, wear your regular armor and take some Rad-X (100 rad resist for 10 minutes) or complete the side quest [An Organic Solution](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/An_Organic_Solution) and craft RadShield (300 rad resist for 15 minutes) to use.  Make sure you have plenty of RadAway and Stimpaks.  I'd favorite them and add them to your hotwheel.

Its good for farming water tbh. But tge edge of the map in this game is fairly empty, a few Mirelurk queens in specific locations and some nuka cola macines with potential quantum spawns
---
I’d be more pissed at this then a daily limit but either way it won’t be what a lot of people are hoping for . People think they are going to get their dream gear right away but that would completely destroy the lil bit of economy we have left

Winter is coming.. to ^(Appalachia).

I've never understood why whitespring yellow health bars = become hostile when shot and watoga red health bars = continue normal sentry uninterrupted while you pump shells into the back of their head
---
been on the game from noon to 3am tuesday, and 7pm to 3am wednesday (this morning) havent had a server disconnect, blue screen, or anything else.
---
i got it the second time i did it, i didnt know it was rare
---
Probably because it starts with “Bethesda please”
---
Wow, that's lazy.  They didn't repaint the models, they just repainted the X-01 and anything you use it on turns it visually into an X-01? 
---
Jesus Bethesda, make some effort.
---
Yeah I think the ESO model is nice...can make the call on whether to log in religiously or just pick up a few bonuses when you'd regularly log in.
---
I think its an effective tactic and with so many of their atom shop items being 1-2 day only offers I think it could help keep people engaged and logging in to even see these things. Like...I missed a bunch of limited time stuff I may have bought if I had been logging in a few months ago, but there was basically no reason to (no new content, daily challenges are just annoying enough not to be worth the load-time, etc.)
---
How long does it last??

i want one that turns your ballastic weapon into a lazer/plasma weapon

I can’t cram anything else in my stash because it’s full of trash Legendaries

The Firecracker Whiskey is not a "myth", but the challenge to earn it is currently bugged (the name in the datafiles even includes "wierdBug" in it) and is disabled.  Until they figure out how to fix (or simply change) the challenge to earn it, the recipe isn't available.
---
But ... but ... *it just works*.
---
since we are ina  lore thread about the "commies"- please give me a  refresh on Mama Dolce's- I swear I remember that Mama Dolces wasnt really a chinese front but it was a fake front used by.... the us govt or the enclave to whip up anti communist sentiment? is that right or do i have it all wrong?
---
You're really gonna hate me, but. . . I've gotten it 5x already ; )  .
---
That's so amazingly lazy of Bethesda.
---
are you seriously going to tell me the gun in Fallout looks more like a Vickers than a Lewis when I have eyes and can clearly see that it looks more like the Lewis?  sure it has similarities to both, but it looks MORE like the Lewis than the Vickers.
---
They've already stated they are removing camp damage with the vendor update.
---
Y mean like this

Tbh I've thought this too, it could be a glitch but it also could be the game not differentiating between two instances of the same tile for a snow biome ( nuclear winter)
---
Just wondering how many rounds you looking for?
---
I can help you move some items around. I've had some people help me in the past so I'm always looking to pass my help along. I've done it using a world container before, but that's always risky. My gamertag is ResoluteSpark19.

People that use Berry Mentats and Tank Killer can make you stagger. In that time frame you should be aimable. 9% doesn't sound like much but it happens really often atleast to me :x  You can Counter a High Perception Build with High Agility + Full Stealth Armor and a huge load of Calmex(+3 P and A). Btw you can only see people's names and points on the radar if your character is looking to someone not by turning your camera to him. That recon sight thing sounds scary :/ I'm using one but never happened to me!
---
You want to really know who people cheat in this game? They just change the color effect of Berry Mentats in their game files and literally make you glow like a beacon. Thats what i truly call f \*cheater!
---
As you get high in level, your weapons stop functioning well.  
---
I guess you're supposed to be getting decrepit with old age, or something?  Dementia?  Dunno, but it's stupidly senseless that, at level \~100 or so with my best rifle, I have to shoot a god damn bug 4 - 5 times before it dies.  Same with rats.  It's infuriating.
---
Yea it opens but floor looks a lot more whiter than in this pic. And it snows. I'll post it on filthycasuals sub

id rather it stay a small, dedicated fanbase. doubt anyone would like playing the game if its flooded by people who tryhard or just act rude (especially considering how everyone is super nice in game)

Strangely enough vice city was too much for me apparently but San Andreas was just fine xD.

Pro Tip : Most of the non Nukashine DLC drinks are already "fresh" when you find them in the world. I've come to just always carrying one of each on my person. Vodka, Rum , Whiskey,  BOurbon, All Beers etc. . . Get quest. Open pip boy. Drink said beverage. Do the requirement. Turn in. Quest Complete.

Lol You can farm dirty water at your camp with the level 1 hand water pump. Yeah that’s kinda what disappointed me about this game. I feel like a explored the whole map find something cool and found nothing much to show.
---
I trade with the same people all the time, and those regulars bring me more business. At the end of the day, you don't need to make a killing on all your trades if you are consistently moving items. Trading is as much a social function for the community and keeping items circulating to those who will actually use it, as it is a means of personal enrichment. Your wealth will grow as a result of performing the task adequately and thoughtfully. 
---
Good advice from start to finish.
---
Everyone is complaining about the same stuff everything is almost reports of stuff that's already talked about.
---
If it got a downvote than it's going to get another one now. Same goes for repetitive topics they often get downvote after the third or fourth time they are mentioned.
---
The devs must have been on meth too long and started going insane before they coded that part, hardly any other explanation could make sense...

Good advice from you or me? Lol...seems both of us think alike

I was talking purified. From the industrial ones.
---
I support this cause. I want my HUD to he adjusted too.  Like in literally EVERY FALLOUT GAME BEFORE THIS ONE.
---
I also have one I can provide for free if you want.  Sort of made it a habit to buy them whenever I see them at a vendor.
---
 Ah you don’t need 15. I can get to max using unyielding armour set with 4 chr
---
Dont know if there is one, I generally get 20+ for vending.

This is why subs should have the option to disable downvoting entirely.

It's so strange. I thought the patches were supposed to improve performance.

Daily challenges were great when Bethesda wasn't greedy XDDD

---
Do tell...
---
I'm aware of that. I mean "myth" as in "you can't obtain it and anyone who tells you they've seen it is lying." Not "myth" as in "it's not based on a real thing they intended to implement."
---
He definitely has a fixed location at the station at Berkley Springs. I glitched into it a few weeks ago, and his station is already setup, stash box and all. The only thing missing is the front door and the vendor. All of the items you see in the trailer are already there behind the counter and mounted on the walls.
---

I'm not sure that it even deserves to be on the list.  If new issues didn't keep coming up, maybe, but honestly at the rate bugs are showing up I think just ignore it entirely.
---
I've been lucky, most of the three star weapons I've been finding are light melee and or weightless effect. Makes saving them a lot easier.
---
&gt;Then maybe this is bethys (its my cute nick-name for bethesda they can have the capitalisation and the proper name back when they stop pulling this kinda stuff) 
---
It's not cute, it just sounds stupid.
---
And sanity.
---
Any furious?
---
I’ve seen it said that there is a 3 hour cool down between each event, no it’s not time limited like the parade, possible outfit rewards in addition to the white fedora are the Sheepsquatch mascot head, Sheepsquatch mascot outfit, imposter Sheepsquatch head, and imposter Sheepsquatch outfit. There’s a weapon plan for the Fixer but I don’t know if that’s loot on the body or event reward as I’ve never seen one but hopefully someone else can clarify how you get the Fixer plan.
---
This is Bethesda we talking about they having trouble with coding a camera that does not teleport you to the moon.
---
Let alone a in game atom shop.

I thought this was cool during the [radstorm.](https://i.imgur.com/SKgQsFz.jpg) Looked cool in there.

Heh, I saw one of those meme-y youtubers (Kevduit) have the title "Fallout 76 goes pay to win??!!" and then proceeds to just buy a bunch of them, but I know juicehead and other youtubers will definitely pick up on this, the ones that are critical and do point out flaws. It'll eventually get the gaming journalists attention and so on.
---
God I've seen blades, the micro transaction pop ups are so bloody intrusive and they removed all the end game stuff and locked them in loot chests, with it being 200 hours of grinding to just get a chest that has the items for free and get a chance at getting the 5% of a rare artifact. It's so bloody greedy. I understand they need to make money, it;s a free game but jesus.
---
Yes, but don't take it off too soon after exiting the shower. It seemed like I lost some mutations that way.
---
Well, the ones you attack do become hostile, but none of their friends do.
---
Yes. Because its still an issue. 
---
They could have done worse, and there's still a chance they'll do worse than just a repair kit.
---
You aren't the target demographic, your lack of playing won't bother them at all.
---
I thought the fact that they're skins makes it pretty clear they will cover up all mods, that's pretty much the whole idea behind skins.
---
Another undoable weekly challenge? They are mastering the skill "Pay2Win".
---
Or wait Vault 51.
---
You sure? I can finally take a picture of that pack of Wendigos living near my house without getting my face mauled off now. I’d say it’s a pretty safe way of taking pictures now.
---
And your reading comprehension is pretty bad too.
---
I have a 325lbs CW and on my best days I'm down to 180 lbs so the entire junkland is mines!
---
180 lbs is 81.72 kg
---
Thank you for taking the time to do this research and write this post!
---
I'm hoping Death is next, sexy beast of a skin.  With the sale being a week long, I'm thinking each one will roll out one after another now.
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Yes! I also think they should put in the atom store for "classic" Fallout skins or models or weapons. Old school power fist, super sledge, and plasma weapons. Bring That Gun back!!!!
---
So that's why mu All Rise weighs so much!
---
Thanks to this post I've learned bulking doesn't save space, it's only useful for selling to a vendor.
---
Honestly, has anyone else noticed more leaves on the ground?
---
It's coming in the next patch, Patch 9, on May 7th.
---
It's business, nothing more.
---
Bug?  
---
WTF?  
---
One direct hit should be plenty.
---
I also kept mine semi auto to conserve ammo in the mag and keep dmg up
---
The plan is a reward. Also, if sheepsquatch's body disappears - wait about a minute, it will appear as a pile. The piles of other robots can lie upon it, so collect all the loot from them - run around the location - collect and pray it will appear) Not sure what's in common, but for me it worked several times)
---
So essentially it has the stats of the excavator but look of the x01? I got no issue with that. Excavator mods are easier to come by and I prefer the extra carry weight.
---
The game even tells you at tourist attractions... the body stands out pretty well.
---
Well, they put a fence, this is something. I wish it would be a legendary fence, but nope.
---

I 100% agree, I know a lot of players dumped this game day one and many haven't returned. I, you and many others did stick with it hoping it to redeem itself, yet Bethesda sees the poor sales, think "Hmmmm how to fix... lmao let's break a promise since we couldn't ship a proper working game at launch and just put in non cosmetic items".
---
I agree, this game needs criticism definitely to move forward, if it was all happy days and flowers with no criticism, this game probably wouldn't have moved forward and still be in a buggy state. I see posts stating bugs getting downvoted? Why? It's criticism that will help the game, not tunnel it into the ground. The actual haters are the ones who like to come into this reddit and sput bs like "Yooo who plays this dead game anymore lmao get a life play COD Black Ops 4, you can buy a $30 hammer yooooo just don't play the game, it's a buggy sh\*t", not the "Bethesda why are you doing this? You broke a promise" or the "Bethesda this needs to be fixed, please do this! Not that!"
---
I want to believe that Bethesda aren't doing an EA, but it just slowly seems that they're creeping to it, whether it's their decision or Zenimax, who mostly call all of the marketing shots and ESO.
---
Ah ok so there goes that theory. Ty for the info.
---
You don't need to be 100 yards away or aim with the sledge. Stuff just dies when you click. I mean there are merits to both but fights are pretty low effort with melee.
---
Plague Walker negates those downsides pretty well
---
And we still can't look inside power armor chassis until they are dropped
---
As we have already seen, locations in the game change over time. It's very likely that these places will get involved in future DLC. Eg. the Toxic Valley is mostly empty and uninteresting, but apparently there's a Vault door behind the space station.
---
I'm interested, level 154, some damn good gear of I do say so myself. Really looking for more to do in game. On xbox
---
The BOS plans spawned for me at grafton steel
---
Try running the scan and repair under game options on the launcher. It's helped me before, though with different problems to yours.
---
Plague walker wants even more diseases, melees want plague walker, everybody wins
---
It doesn't like you.
---
I don't like you either.
---

Seriously though, do you have any custom files? Have you updated them?

It's the only thing I can think of.

---
Can't wait for that lock item feature
---
This, the horn mannequin, the stationary bombs away MOBILE, and the emotes that only change the picture above you are pure laziness. It really feels like they just don't care anymore. Also all the bugs that have been in since release that modders have fixed overnight yet BGS can't even acknowledge them. They're milking this fanbase with as little effort as possible. I'd love to go back and play FO4 but even that is still a buggy mess. They put more work into their Fallout merch on their website than the actual games
---
God I'd love to see a snow covered Appalachia for Nuclear Winter, a whole change of scenery would be great!
---
And yeah, that seems to be either a colour or graphical issue that's been around for a while, I get that a lot but with other colours. I have a pic somewhere where the Savage Divide is just the mint green colour XD
---
But the Ash heap turns super white when that glitch happens, literally looks frozen over!
---
wow, you go right into calling someone you disagree with a "little bitch"?
---
i do believe sir, it is you who needs to "grow up"
---
Good idea for cheese. Grilled brahmin cheese sandwiches... We can make the bread from the razor grain flour
---
Same. I've gotten some of my best gear from people selling stuff to vendors, including several sentinel and cavalier pieces and a full set of troubleshooter stuff for the sheepsquatch. I really hope I can complete this 3-star set of Marine armor I'm trying to put together before the end of May.
---
Ah you haven't been on the sub in the past 48 hours.

Step 1: Find the new equippable camera item on a random body

 We saw this coming. Data mined pictures have been available for ages. 
---
 I was ready and bought Plague Rider last night. ;)
---
Thats what i thought first friend I made was a 73 year old guy and he was just wandering around the wastes it was really cool to run around with him
---
Well, it *is* a nice place for a CAMP, at least.
---
There are a few areas like this - they tend to coincide with the pictures of animals on the map (not sure if that's deliberate or not).
---
Renamed mine. Works fine.
---
I'm sure Bethesda are devastated by your actions.
---
There should be some sort of penalty for dying
---
Yes please, I haven't applied any prime receivers to my guns, because I don't feel like grinding for hours just to make enough ammo for a single silo run.
---
But STILL people will say this isnt an issue, even with the many many reports of people having items disappearing
---
im sorry this happened to you, we can only hope that Bethesda sees all these reports and actually does something about it
---
I really don’t understand why more people don’t accept invites. Even if you don’t want to run with me, you can have my shared perks AND a nice bonus of exp and caps as I grind through daily missions.
---
Feel free to add on PSN. Name is the same as this.
---
Why now, if previous fallouts never had one?
---
Greatest
---
It’s a Pistol so use gunslinger perks.
---
If you use a non-legendary one, having perks that give benefits from rads  would sync well.
---
Legendary SAH’s don’t inflict rads. Probably a bug but a good one.
---
Double and quad versions effectively increase the damage even more if you charge it to the max.
---
Charge time is a bit slow so anything that boosts reload speed is great. Ex. Speed demon or a legendary with that for the 3rd effect.
---
Two shot versions are strange right now. Damage listed is the same as a non-legendary. Cannot confirm if the damage inflicted is still higher like it should be or if it’s actually the same. Have not tested it enough. 
---
Be sneaky and make your charged shots count. Trying to re-charge more than once or twice with enemies rushing at you will get you killed. VATS is your friend.
---
I’ll save up when I know exactly what I should be saving up.
---
You can't overestimate QA team that doesn't exist.
---
Death needs to have a negative consequence.
---
Great tip, it’s disappeared on me a couple of times now so il give that a try
---
I absolutely can, I don't need that shit weighing me down.
---
previous fallouts had the ability to go back to a previous save, previous fallouts are always offline. 
---
&gt;!i do not know where my point is!&lt;
---
Because this isnt a previous fallout game.
---
Values are % of displayed "Base value" for items
---
1 Charisma = 250% Buy Value | 10% Sell Value
---
20 Charisma = 180% Buy Value | 25% Sell Value
---
25 Charisma = 175% Buy Value | 25% Sell Value
---
Hard Bargain = +9 Charisma (Unlocks Level 7)
---
Grape Mentats = +5 Charisma
---
Amber alert engaged!
---
Yep. IIRC It was done to prevent XP farming the silos since the bots spawn continuously, similar to how they significantly decreased the XP gain from glowing ones.
---
Yup, personally used it for stable flux crafting.
---
The intentional bottleneck is part of the challenge. If you don't like getting ganked at the fast travel point for the most popular destination in the game, don't fast travel to the most popular destination in the game.
---
Build your CAMP semi-nearby and WALK. Or build your camp wherever, fast travel to R&amp;G, which no one ever uses, and WALK. Basically what I'm saying is you can't play Survival like you do Adventure. It's hard mode.  You WILL get killed, you WILL have to walk. A ton. Also, it's worth it.
---
I agree about server stability, but the fact that ONLY junk drops is an incredibly minor penalty. In my days MUDDING, everything dropped, and our corpse got looted and buried.
---
It’s kinda sad that it had to come to that. The other base games had some interesting stuff to find without dlc.
---
Bulking aluminum and lead *does* save space, they are the only 2 junk items that lose weight upon bulking.
---
Welcome to the adventures of the amazing camera man with special abilities like teleporting emotes or falling to his or her death.
---
Then death has no consequence.  You don't lose any "experience points" or level progression (or whatever you want to call it).  You just restart some menial distance from where you were, and keep doing what you were doing.  At that point, why not just restart right where you were and get back to it?  Why even die?
---
Deathclaws being deathclaws - you have a point.  But then why do deathclaws have that junk to begin with anyway?  Maybe they do collect things, and we've seen them accumulate junk in their nests.  Molemen and some other opponents do collect stuff, from whatever their lives were before the radiation took them.
---
Your death in PvE has to *at least* be an inconvenience.
---
Ur telling me... I live (my camp) a minute walk from colonel Kelly monument and everytime I log in or go to my camp I search.... And nothing
---
I already spent $200 on this game.  I'm not spending any more by buying Atoms.  If I can't get an item, I'm not getting that item.  Oh well.
---
Or even better... [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31088/](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31088/) 
---
With that said, it was still a band aid to a dated UI even back then. Really the game needs a total UI overhaul bringing it into 2019. The pip boy UI is almost the same as the first Fallout lol. My Mrs couldn't get into this game because she was so frustrated by the user interface and how confusing it was. pages of text list menus with unintuitive key assignments.
---
Imagine if there was a character screen with slots for you to equip separate from your inventory. The accidental scrapping and dropping would become a thing of the past which it already has for pretty much every other game made in the last decade.
---
Some good examples of games with well designed UI / Inventory management;
---
1. Example 1[http://assets.vg247.com/current//2016/04/escape\_fom\_tarkov\_hud-1.jpg](http://assets.vg247.com/current//2016/04/escape_fom_tarkov_hud-1.jpg)
---
2. Example 2[http://i.imgur.com/n0nEl83.png](http://i.imgur.com/n0nEl83.png)
---
3. Example 3[http://i.imgur.com/cTAhHnn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cTAhHnn.jpg)
---
It prolongs the game. That's probably the reason they changed it to work this way.
---
Previous fallout games had save points and loading. So if you died and hadn't saved for 17 minutes all that junk you collected is now gone. In fallout 76 you die and have a chance at getting it back.
---
Nice
---
Yup same thing happen to me long ago at level 88 I'm 157 now.  Put in a ticket and got the response  Thanks for putting in a ticket but we can't return items in game and closed the ticket.  So yeah finally found someone to sell one to me that they don't use anymore for 1k caps.  Sorry for your loss it sucks and happens with a lot of people and items.
---
Hope it works for you
---
Yeah when I first started played this I went to most of those places because I figured something would be there.
---
Das war nicht so ernst gemeint 😂
---
Sentient plants. Oh, that would make a nice enemy for a vault raid. Whichever one was overgrown.
---
Oh no.  The game lost another freerider.
---
Once he's here I'll be back down to 400.
---
You can literally find the low level worthless ones for sale at vendors. People don't keep wooden level 5 sentinel gear with only 1 star. Lol
---
To bad your wrong about all of it
---
From you. I was just saying the same things more or less, but as I see them.
---
Wtf are you talking about . We have a decent population that is growing faster than its shrinking
---
I found out what the problem was and it is really stupid of me but also kinda fault on bethesda's part. 
---
So Since I have the issue that I have to disconnect the internet and launch the game always through the direct exe instead of the launcher I kinda forgot the existence of said launcher.... So the game jsut wasn't updated...
---
It has been ages and this wasn't fixed, so ofcourse I forgot the launcher entirely since I need to bypass bethesdas work quality...
---
I hope I don't sound too greedy to get a proper settings in the menu to switch to azerty keyboard.. their apperantly automatic detection isn't doing much. I kinda wonders why they didn't make it a toggleable option in the first place?
---
**Workshop PVP in Adventure Mode should stay in the Workshop**
---
THIS is how it should work:
---
I take a workshop, and i leave the workshop area to go about my business, then, i see someone has contested my workshop
---
I should have 2 options:
---
1) I ignore the contesting player, and i lose my workshop, pvp is over as i've lost my workshop
---
2) I decide to defend the workshop, pvp does not start until I return to the workshop and enter the green-border limit- then PVP is on! PvP can then happen anywhere on the map until either myself or the other player dies.
---
that is it!
---
ill say it again: *WORKSHOP PVP in Adventure Mode SHOULD STAY IN THE WORKSHOP*
---
none of this "2 players team up, one stalks the workshop owner back to his house, the other then initiates workshop contesting, then the other teammate who has been stalking the other player simply 1 shots them at their house"
---
That's called save scumming, and it's done to circumvent negative outcomes. It's a consequence of negative outcomes being a feature of the game. It's not the reason why those outcomes are put into the game.
---
Nope, sentinel also blocks the conduit damage. Also people vendor low level wooden 1 star sentinel pieces all the time. 
---
The ranged cant do it because they can't keep him staggered like a melee user using power attacks can.
---
Based on the rest of the game you've been playing. What exactly did you expect????
---
Love this, would be  a great add.  More often then not people just grab up your junk.  Good on you!
---
If you are 250+ and don't have 1400+ atoms you obviously wasted them on stupid crap. That isn't anybody's fault but yours.
---
It is exhausting and such a put off.... I still haven't found it and that is with several hours and lots of server hopping done the last couple days.
---
Ahh so if you have a high cha already using hard bargain and other buffs so jack didlly?
---
What the... The penalty in previous Fallouts was a game over and loading your last save.
---
Ya that's always bugged me too lol
---
Ugh, that hurts.  I might quit the game if that happened to me.
---
Griefers are the worse kind of people and shouldn't be allowed to do this, can't wait for May 7th patch as its suppose to make your camp immune to damage if you in pacifist mode.
---
I'm on pc. But I want to thank you for being kind enough to post this.
---
I normally don't, mainly because I like to just piddle along.  Unless your partner has a mic, it's hard to just kind of hang out and play at a slow pace that I like.
---
I joined up with the lv91 because he saw me coming and didn't instantly kill me, I didn't run, and then he sent an invite.  I figured that meant he wanted to do something nice for me rather than just up his kill count.
---
He ran me around and got me a lot of stuff.  It was appreciated, but it probably wouldn't have been long term fun for either of us unless I was closer to his level and could farm, pvp, etc on equal ground.
---
Once again, you can check my post history I stick up for him because what happened is bs. They don't care, if he responds back that is literally all he would have time to do.
---
I get that reference.
---
I’ve been having that issue too. Considering- after testing- that I get severe lag spikes and a disconnect after performing the Camera emote glitch, I’m beginning to wonder if perhaps the disconnects are from players performing the glitch and accidentally booting everyone off the server.
---
How about a game with no parameters at all?
---
The issue was, you had to completely close the game and restart it each day to get the new egg to show in the shop.
---
Not everyone but most I've seen had to restart the game.
---
It's ended now so it's too late unfortunately.
---
But, keep this in mind for future shop events. Restart the game after 8pm est each day to reset the free items.
---
I dont even know what to do with the last 5 level ups, now im going to have like 20 more.
---
Oh, I know it works, it works extremely well. It doesn't sit well with me because unlike a physical good that can have a limited supply, or a shelf life, digital cosmetics are unlimited and have no shelf life. So making it time limited is a totally contrived condition to replicate the limited availability of a special edition physical item.
---
I think the problem is that the option itself (probably, don't quote me on this) changes the pip-boy flashlight color for everyone.
---
But yeah, I wish they let us change the UI colors.
---
I find MOST players are like that.  Why?  Why do they do that?  WHY??????
---
It depends, if you have 15 base charisma, hard bargain 3 gets you to 24, so you could still benefit from drinking booze or anything with +1 charisma.
---
But yeah, basically once your total effective charisma is at 25 (I don't think hard bargain actually changes your stat on the pip boy screen), you don't get any extra benefits from boosting it further.
---
That's the reason mods like CASM are immensely popular, because losing progress in tedious and pointless. It's a game, death is common, it doesn't need to be so punitive.
---
I would rather as few mobile gaming tropes make its way into this game. ESO does the daily login thing too. It doesnt sit well with me as a console gamer
---
 the Order of Mysteries quest line was probably best in the game so far, if we all chose a side that could make for some interesting dlc
---
This is a fallout survival game. Survival games like Ark, NMS, Rust, etc all have you drop gear on death. At least this is just junk and not all items
---
You say that now, but it was only just patched to benefit from Rifleman perks.
---
I'd try it as a sneak weapon with those perks you mentioned, but it'll never be as good as other silenced rifles due to middling power and extremely low fire rate. A specific legendary like Instigating or Bloodied one maybe, but it should have extra power/limb damage/other effect to make up for its shortcomings
---
I can help you make a mule if you’d like
---
That would be awesome if they implemented seasons.
---
But the rocket pass tho
---
*chuckles in red dead redemption 2 online beta 6 months after launch*
---
I actually kind of like the look of the assault rifle, it's unique. Can't stand the combat rifle though. That shit is so basic and boring, I don't use it out of principle.
---
Totally on board for the R91 though. And the service rifle and marksman carbine like someone else mentioned.
---
yeah but they would probably need to do that on the survival servers so as not to break the base game
---
I'll check when I get home tonight
---
*Backpacks will function while in PA.*
---
That's a delightful (and slightly terrifying) piece of news.
---
Excavator bonus + 2x Calibrated shocks + Carry capactiy upgraded backpack = Good lord
---
Or they could just use the code from the better inventory mod for the game that literally does everything they are asking for and doing even more, such as telling you how much weight is being ised by each tab, or how much weight the 25 fusion grenades you are carrying weigh total.
---
He isn't wrong, he's just an asshole.
---
I have 4 mules full of legendaries ☺️
---
I shall presume to not waste my grape mentats then lol thank you.
---
and you're just a smug piece of shit that needs to fuck right off, cunt...
---
they cant. vats max range is 50 . after that vats stops working. lol
---
Sucks you’re having issues as well, I just want to play the game.
---
I am referring to when this game first came out. The other games rewarded exploration. So why wouldn’t I expect the same since they are similar?
---
Keeping your word when agreeing a sale and not giving into greed or over bids takes discipline, not many have that trait
---
Good a time as any to start afresh!
---
Merci pour les conseils;))
---
Pvp is literally the worse aspect of this game, really wished they put more resources into pve when designing the game.
---
Hey look, another great cosmetic only idea that can be sold for atoms that people want to buy and it doesn't affect gameplay.
---
Im just conveying what a typical third person would think and feel. Typically people would feel that someone who has something to hide would not communicate as much as someone who has nthing to hide. This is why communication is impt in almost everything we do, from businesses on public relations to a couple looking to maintain a good relationship or to this particular situation. In this case it's better to convey your msg across or let the status quo worsen.
---
And i think you might have mistaken me for someone else on 
---
&gt; once again, you can check my post history
---
Bethesda I want my prison to he Enclave themed damb it
---
I think they do it because it is part of the game meta, rather.
---
Are you still online by chance?
---
It also makes using other Power Armor without shocks more viable if you're carrying a shitload of stuff.
---
we had them in fallout 4 why not fallout 76?
---
Has there been any actual comfirmation of this? I haven't seen any pictures or anything.
---
putting them in the atom shop would be a really bad idea
---
Oooo scandalous 
---
Message me.
---
That moment when people complain about cosmetics in the atom shop yet also complain when there isn't.
---
They're not similar at all.
---
The fo76 world is devoid of anything interesting apart from the good old teddy bears playing chess or similar crap.
---
If someone told you you'd be getting the Fallout experience in 76 they were lying to you.
---
It's just sad man, the game was going so well,there hadn't been a controversy for a couple of months and it finally seemed to be shaping up.now they've decided to throw another spanner in the works and add this shit. its so insidious too,a lot of people saying that its easy to repair stuff with their hundreds of stashed mats weapon artisan white knight etc. They've completely forgot what the experience of being a new player in this game is like, I remember my weapons and armour constantly breaking and getting extremely frustrated with it,this isn't targeted at the players with a couple hundred of each mat in their stash and all required repair perks,its targeted at newer player's trying to get their bearings with the game! Also It will allow squads of greifers to hold spawn points in survival all day . defenders say its very cumbersome and can't help you in a fight but they're thinking 1v1 a full squad who guards each other while one makes repairs have a competitive advantage! Sorry for walls of text ,don't know how to make paragraphs on my phone lol
---
You can factually be a communist constitutional republic.  A republic is a state run in the name of the people.  A constitutional system functions based on a document which describes how the state will function as compared to a system based on precedent. China is a communist republic.
---
The opposite of communism is anarco-capitalism aka AnCap.
---
I don’t expect that and I’m not acting like this is some new found knowledge for people. I just want to remind people of how money is handled with video games (or any industry) when they mention micro transactions. Asking for more free “in-game currency” isn’t entitled or wrong. Capitalism is poison, bois
---
Calm down lol
---
yes it does
---
Walk.. the extra XP you get make it worth it.. 
---
There is a good sniper spot in whitesprings where you can hit the spawn campers.. they don’t like it up ‘em :)
---
That's apples and oranges, if Fallout was a survival game as much as those games, it would have shown in the previous games. Die and respawn at the vault empty-handed, not at your previous save.
---
Please God no. They did this on eso and my adhd tunnel vision kicked in and I HAD to log in every day until it felt like a chore and I had to stop. I still haven't played that game in a long time.
---
Its not they are bored but easy caps. Really hope they make it so you get option to forfeit workshop if someone attempts to take it.
---
i found it now, it being stuck in-between all the atom shop stuff is what caused me to pass it over. but thank you for the reply :)

 I'd take it straight to Wallace. ;) Unless that is Chameleon, then its worth something.
---
A couple months ago I saw a high bounty staying still. They were trashing a camp when I approached. A swift critical to the head with a sneak attack using an instigating black powder rifle did the trick. 
---
I hate griefers.
---
ngl, i was sweating a little reading this.
---
especially when they say "your first backpack (more on that in a moment)," i thought for sure there was going to be a paragraph about the backpacks being in the shop.
---
1500 Brotherhood\* points ;\]
---
Posted a vid on r/fo76filthycasuals, check my profile to take a look
---
There is no 1* Sentinel gear. Sentinel is a third tier effect meaning it only appears on 3* items.
---
4 does give you a very smooth mechanics on how you use your hoarded items, though.
---
There is no reason a courier needs both duct tape and wonderglue specifically to create his/her weapon repair kits.
---
I don’t because I don’t want a crazy friends list with 100s of people that I haven’t properly vetted or gotten to know.  
---
The second reason, I don’t need randos knowing where my camp is and knowing how to quickly find me if they decide they want to troll at some point.
---
Good call, hope they do this
---
I never get it. If they are able to do fusion cores... Why oil? Make everything fusion core use.
---
I've been putting any crappy 3 star or weightless things in there for the last couple weeks....really wish he'd hurry up though as i'm pretty darn full.
---
I don’t think that they think things through until after releasing. They act like none of their programmers or management teams have never played a pvp game.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, that was dumb.
---
Do they yelled Ballistic?
---
There's a severe lack of any faction themed items. Doesn't matter if its base or the atomic shop, we have nothing
---
I was wondering how well this would work.
---
I really hate the new Assault rifle model from 4 and 76, I prefer the Chinese Assault Rifle or the US one from Op Anchorage tbh
---
Wow this is really useful.
---
Basically disease cures but they give you +50% disease resistance for a bit
---
Can i join? I'm level 75 on Xbox one
---
I got this no fast travel here just exploring lots

Quite honestly, I understand where you guys are coming from, but it defeats the purpose of them being survival challenges. You can do all your prep in Adventure and knock out the crafting/scrapping in a couple minutes in survival. It defeats the whole point. 
---
Also it makes this specific legendary and any others like it WAY too easy to get. I legit did this quest after looting after a queen fight, I just ran over to a workbench, switched from adventure to survival, scrapped all the weapons I’d picked up. Was only 4 melee weapons short. Went back to adventure and farmed a bunch of beer bottles, switched back to survival and speed-crafted all the explosives, Molotov’s, and 40mm grenades, plus a few boards to round things out. Total time at all, like 15-20 minutes. Total time in Survival, like 3.
---
OK--
---
Once I completed the Bucket List, the option to rename the camera became available (even before applying the 105 mm lens).
---
I think you just can't rename it while it's considered a quest item.
---
Well you wouldn’t know that on launch of this game would you? Lol
---
Yes, you can build Atom Shop camp items at friends camps... It's just paints and skins that can't be shared.
---
I just got the PS blue screen about 5 minutes ago. :(
---
Just went back to check and she is gone. Sorry.
---
You mean like a sense of *pride and accomplishment*?
---
I dont know if it's just me, but i have a less than 40% chance to loot the body. Its the most dissapearingest god damned thing on planet earth. No way I'm spending 2k to launch those for another fedora
---
You’re probably going to have to trade in 50 legendaries to get one so ya I’m stocking up
---
Why not?
---
like Bethesda ever looked that deep into lore lmao
---
Oh they have great QA that well documents all their bugs. It's called this community right here. Unfortunately it means they can't actually act on any bugs before they get exploited.
---
Wow you got almost everything except the kitchen sink, literally want a sink so I can make a proper bathroom.
---
So cheating is only really possible on pc?
---
🖕
---
(For PC) Have you tried everything states on this guide? https://youtu.be/fJzgi3w5KVE showed it to another post like this and it fixed their problem. Hope it fixes yours. (A lot of people don't seem to know about it sadly.
---
It happens only with the stove, though.
---
50 what? It’s sure as hell not 50 feet because I can vats things (eyeballing here, we don’t have an actual range meter, but I work in construction, I’m decent at eyeballing distances) at least a hundred feet out. 100 yards is exaggeration, sure.
---
Didn’t know this, I missed his body since I was dead when our group downed him. I’ll stick around longer next time
---
If that's the reason, and you want to incorporate it into the world that way, it should be junk moved from your inventory to the enemy's inventory on death, not dropped for you to reclaim all or nothing. With the system in place it doesn't make sense to say the enemies are taking the loot for themselves because they never do. It's just a tedious consequence as it stands, not one that enhances the game. I'm proposing we amend the system, I'd be less upset if it were what you suggested.
---
lol, ok.  thanks.
---
Raw flux goes to aid; stable flux goes to junk. Always craft stable flux on camps.
---
Popping a Buffout-type chem when your rads ≥ 1000 (all red on HUD) prevents you from getting killed due to rads, *as long as that chem's effect is active.* Good for last resorts when you run out of RadAways.
---
Got the fixer plan as a reward for an event. Let’s you craft higher versions of the weapon, and indirectly allow getting upgrades through scrapping lower versions.
---
whoever's downvoting this I have to ask are you ok
---
Oh you don't even loose the workshop most of the time, they engage in workshop PVP just to kill you wherever you areand then leave the workshop right away so it's not even contested. They don't care about workshop, they only exploit its mechanics.
---
Would love confetti to fly out upon headshot kill of enemies. Totally worth wasting a star for it.
---
getting downvotes when you’re 100% right lmao. when i discover a new location there’s never anything of interest besides some junk
---
You know what I mean don't be pedantic, useful affixes, no one cares about the crap affixes so sentinel gear with affixes that aren't even memorable. Do you honestly count the crap legendary effects like the boost at night or troubleshooters because you absolutely will find those types sold at vendors.
---
I'm willing to bet backpacks are going to end up costing a lot of atoms for even the smallest customization. 
---
Since they've introduced a 'utility' item to the atom shop and they specifically mention mods as utility items in the article, I wonder if they'll end up selling some mods for atoms as well.
---
Fingers crossed this system is something we can learn in game and possibly find some of the customization and mod plans around rather than have to buy. 
---
I'm looking forward to seeing this in game.
---
Any downsides?
---
Yay mules! Even if you can't transfer tokens, just reroll on a mule and trade off the finished weapon
---
What about a daily disconnected from server reward?
---
What's great about West Tek?
---
Heavy leather or regular. Either way, im definitely interested. Would you be able to be on 1:00 ET? If that doesn’t work let me know what will
---
This would be a solid point if they didnt already allow face tattoos. I think its purely just a design desicion. If they had body tattoos, then theyd have to do body paint, scars, and grime too, and I think they just didnt want to go this route. Alot of extra coding for things that you will never see for the most part.
---
The prices will just rise for paying caps
---
DM me with offer and your PSN name.
---
better grind than White Springs
---
"As a novice Tadpole, you will need to prove you’ve embraced the Pioneering lifestyle by completing activities that demonstrate their core values: kindness, helpfulness, bravery, and growth.

---
this is gonna be dark isn't it
---
Can anyone copy whats on the article and post it on reddit, at work can go to that site.
---
They stated some mods may take up space in your inventory, so I assume that means you may have +50 carry weight but add refrigeration mod you’re not at +40 or +30, something to that extent for food that takes longer to spoil
---
No ive not confused you at all, I was trying to offer you a glimpse of what he would have to deal with. I have arguments defending him lasting 4 days,  he literally wouldn't have time to do anything else.
---
The people who still don't believe him are just trolls at this point, or idiots who haven't actually looked into the whole story.
---
The new assault rifle is really cool
---
Facts
---
Check Death/War, X-01 shoulders with the skin are different from the T-series shoulders skin. They could have put some more effort.
---
This too regarding camp.  In survival my camp is just a bench and a cooking station, so I don't worry about camp vandalism as much.  It also moves around a lot, so i don't worry about them de-teaming and killing me.
---
Ive found if you turn the opacity down to about 50-60 they dont look as bad. With grime and scars they dont look as out of place. Except the anchor, and rad symbol. Those are just awful.
---
Ive been keeping 2 and 3 stars, and weightless 1 stars. Made more mules as necessary
---
It shows 8:30 AM right now, your pacific time.. for me it's 18:30 PM. 
---
So you'll be online roughly after 12 hours from now?
---
I'm bad with time zones. :D
---
So we can make a refrigerated backpack, but not a fridge for our house?
---
No! Its a stupid idea. The entitlement generation in a nutshell.
---
I've decided to replace caps with 5 56 ammo. Near enough everyone wants it and theres no limit to how much you can have 👍
---
It's very well possible. The market prices have been going crazy high lately, even for super common items (cough TSE +1P lever action). I'm hoping when the legendary vendor comes around they'll level out.
---
It's also super easy to get to that 25k limit, so if you want to be a salesman/vendor you have to have alts
---
Besides watoga shopping center (plans) id try hitting all the vendors.
---
same, my school blocks a lot of sites but decides not to block reddit. which is weird when they block school sites

FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT – PIONEER SCOUTS AND BACKPACKS – APRIL 25, 2019
---
This week, we’re sharing a preview of our “Ever Upwards!” Wild Appalachia update that’s currently slated to arrive with Patch 9 on May 7. Read on to learn how you can join the Pioneer Scouts and unlock your first Backpack. We’ve also included reminders about this weekend’s double XP event and our ongoing Fallout 76 community streams.
---
DOUBLE XP EVENT THIS WEEKEND!
---
You can earn twice the normal amount of XP all weekend long, starting today at 12:00 p.m. EDT. This is our second of two Double XP events, but this time the bonus is available in both Adventure and Survival Modes. Catch the details below and then log in to start leveling-up faster than ever before.
---
Modes: Adventure and Survival Beta
---
Start: 12:00 p.m. EDT (16:00 UTC) on Thursday, April 25
---
End: 6:00 a.m. EDT (10:00 UTC) on Monday, April 29
---
UPCOMING FALLOUT 76 STREAMS
---
Can’t get enough Fallout 76? Neither can we! We’ve recently begun streaming our adventures in the Wasteland every Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. EDT. Join members of the Bethesda Community Team as they take a look at the latest Fallout 76 content and explore Appalachia. Be sure to tune in next Wednesday, May 1 on the following platforms:
---
Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda
---
Mixer: https://mixer.com/Bethesda
---
THE PIONEER SCOUTS WANT YOU!
---
The intrepid Pioneer Scouts have a long history of inspiring the children of Appalachia to strive “ever upwards” on missions of self-improvement and the betterment of their communities. However, a lack of interested children in the wake of the Great War has caused active scout numbers to dwindle. So, the Pioneer Scouts are taking their philosophy of inclusivity to a whole new level by accepting recruits of all ages.
---
Fallout76 PioneerScoutsPoster 1920x1080
---
If you think the Pioneer Scouts are right for you, check out the posters at Train Stations around Appalachia, or unlock one for your C.A.M.P. for free in the Atomic Shop through June 9.
---
HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES?
---
Fallout76 CampLewisBoathouse 1920x1080
---
As a novice Tadpole, you will need to prove you’ve embraced the Pioneering lifestyle by completing activities that demonstrate their core values: kindness, helpfulness, bravery, and growth. You can also earn badges that show your mastery over traditional activities, like swimming, archery, cooking, athletics, and more. In addition to measuring individual growth, badges will come in handy at Pioneer Scout vending machines. Trade your badges in for themed loot that you can use to enhance your C.A.M.P. and show off your Pioneering spirit.
---
Once you’ve been promoted to the rank of the mighty Possum, you will be able to pursue tougher badges and will be rewarded with your first backpack (more on that in a moment).
---
ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?
---
Listening to spooky stories around the glow of a campfire is time-honored Pioneer Scout tradition. Head to Camp Adams after nightfall to hear about the Terrors of the Dark. Listen closely, but be sure to look over your shoulder for any real creepy creatures that may be lurking in the shadows. Don’t worry too much, this story was originally told to more age-appropriate Tadpoles and Possums, so it won’t be too scary for most veterans of the Wasteland.
---
NEW FEATURE - BACKPACKS
---
Backpacks are new functional items being introduced with Ever Upwards that you can equip to increase your carry weight, so that you have room for more supplies when you head into the great outdoors. They are also customizable and can be modded to fit your fashion sense and personal tastes.
---
Fallout76 BackpackConcepts 1022x1080
---
Check out these concepts the Fallout 76 Art Team put together while designing Backpacks! Not all of these made it into the game, but we thought it would be fun to share a look at the creative process.
---
You can also apply one of several functional mods to your backpack so that it’s better suited to the needs of your next big excursion. A few of the mods you that you can learn to craft include: increased carry capacity (it is a backpack, after all), armor plating for more damage resistance, and even a refrigeration unit, which will give any food within some added shelf-life. However, many of these utility mods will take up some space once installed, and will reduce some of the bonus storage your backpack provides.
---
Fallout76 InGameBackpacks 1920x1080
---
Your backpack will remain visible over your outfits and armor, and while you won’t be able to see it while wearing Power Armor, you will still benefit from its carry weight bonus and the current utility mod you’ve applied. Additionally, whenever you learn a new backpack mod it will apply to all types of backpacks you can craft, so you won’t need to re-learn mods every time you try out a different pack.
---
We can’t wait to get backpacks into your hands with our Ever Upwards update, and we hope you will take them with you wherever your travels may lead.
---
Join us again next week for another Inside the Vault, where we will be sharing a look at additional Patch 9 features and content, like Player Vending, C.A.M.P. décor, and more!
---
i didn’t even know you could turn the opacity down.
---
Practically any player in survival is soft target unless you they have very specific set of legendary armour, Damage Resistance doesn't mater in PVP as any amount of it is negated with 3 Anti-Armour perk cards.
---
Mods are good for some people. I like games to be default as possible ( less issues after updates). Also they does not solves problems for console players.
---
I didnt even realize that this was a bug, explains why my aa plasma is no good
---
Please no, phone games do that and it's cheesy
---
For those that can't click link:
---
Hey, they added another capture the flag mode though!
---
Love the “baby-moth” backpack concept image!
---
If I am over encumbered after or during a junk run I usually hide the excess in paper bag in an inconspicuous spot. Fast travel to my camp drop the items in my stash box and then return to where I hide the excess and move on. Better to risk the loss of a little rather than all.
---
Funny, I saw one in WS yesterday.  Thought about getting it since mine poofed at some point, but decided against it since I haven't wanted to melee anything in a long while (I have a low damage pistol for when I'm being annoyed by level 1 scorched).
---
We're not at launch but I understand your point. I fell for it too.
---
You muppets really think Bethesda use reddit?
---
Putting repair kits in the AS was a bad idea.
---
That would feel really cheap. 
---
Like some of the other posters before me pointed out... I would much rather have actual content added via real challenges for higher level players. I prefer to earn my rewards.   :)
---
Yeah on Xbox you use LB and RB you can do it with scars, grime, and tattoos. It makes them blend a whole hell of a lot better. Im currently rocking the bad luck, and clover tatts and the throat stitch face paint. I look like a proper raider.
---
This would be cool.
---
I like it!
---
It's not a huge deal, unless you're a massive hoarder like I am. 
---
Even then, how long does it really take to get back the scrap you lost?
---
Test-running such tech setup, in addition with narration practicing on a non-political sub like this one is viable, though. 
---
Remember the trade hijack hoax thing on the sub a few while back?
---
Yeah I saw the link and there's zero weight reduction besides those two. By 50 percent I think it said.
---
Huh. I like that idea! I find myself having a bunch of 5mm maybe I'll start using that as currency
---
I got one off the SBQ the other day
---
Try brotherhood vender in whitesprings
---
Because this is a total departure from all previous Fallout games in the Bethesda years, and it's an online multiplayer game with a PvP element.
---
But, you know all this.
---
You know what... I was missing that when i made my bathroom as well. I'll add it to the 1.2 list.
---
;-)
---
Probably that 900 hour guy that got banned for duping :p
---
I have crashed multiple times since the last patch  this week.  I normally don't crash at all and only lag occasionally at things like Sheepsqautch or SGB.  These crashes were just walking around in non-populated areas.  Figuring that this might be a thing for me to deal with until the next patch fixes the bug the last patch caused.  Seems like somebody wants job security at Beth.  LOL
---
I wonder what Backpacks didn't make the cut cause all those concept backpacks looked pretty great
---
Fallout 76 is a departure from the previous entries and was marketed as an online Survival RPG. I don't think it's meant to be as hardcore as those or else the fanbase would have really freaked out. Here's an article describing the game play pre-release 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/sources-fallout-76-is-an-online-survival-rpg-1826425333/amp
---
Coming to an atom store near you!  For the low low price of 1500 atoms, per skin... Limited time only!
---
Dis you do the weekly challenges? I know you have 11 million years to do it but it helps xD.
---
Hahahhahahahahaahahahahah
---
I find 5.56 is the most in demand or shells, but they're a pain to craft ha! Youd need a serious amount of 5mm as the rate is like 4 or 5 per cap. But yea, ammo is a far better currency than caps imo
---
&gt; I have like 10 pieces of gear that I want to reroll
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up about this part. We don't know for sure how the vendor works.
---
yeah, west tek, and a few poor deathclaw's will have big lines of players, think we need a "ticket" system, lol
---
Oohhh... and dont forget technical documents :D
---
I hope it’s feature rich in the core game and not mostly Atom store locked.
---
Last night I completed the Fire Breathers quest, the mask and outfit are really cool. I was like we need a "Fire Breathers" power armor paint! :) maybe have a buff on the flamers and add that to the scheme bundle.. FIRE!
---
That's fair!  It's often argued how little sense it makes that you kill an opponent who was fighting with a particular weapon type, but the drop is something else entirely.  I wouldn't mind a system where the drops were more appropriate to the actual combat, and where my own lost junk could be found.  Plus, it would be fun to see over-encumbered charred feral ghouls who can't sprint at you but just slowly shuffle towards your headshots.
---
Things like wasteland whisperer are pretty fun for charisma. And getting all the crit perks in luck is pretty nice. Also luck of the draw and/lucky break are nice.
---
Any more Unsolved quests, you mean? There are a handful of notes in the taxidermy shop that'll start other Unsolved quests, I think there are 4 or 5 in total, not 100% on the number.
---
I want the ability to scrap ammo or better SELL IT to vendors.
---
Any chance this offer is still available?
---
&gt; Bethesda will know this and I'm sure they will limit it hard.
---
Why though? Like is there actually any problem with people hording legendary items to turn them in?
---
The entire point of the vendor is to "give you a better chance of getting dream gear."
---
So if you farmed 1000 legendaries and literally don't have shit worth anything to your build, why should you be punished for it vs the guy who got super lucky and got his perfect item in 5 kills?
---
I think we had them but players were using them to glitch into places or something. I may be remembering wrong though.
---
 Is that a Chameleon piece? Otherwise its worthless.
---
I think the lake gets scorchbeast attacks. 
---
If you keep heading north there are murkilurk queen spawns, it gets pretty deadly up in that northeast corner.
---
Reading... It's a lost art
---
&gt;Once you’ve been promoted to the rank of the mighty Possum, you will be able to pursue tougher badges and will be rewarded with your first backpack
---
because its a top tier item and you can actually trade it for good item(s) not shitty, common caps that everyone has.....You will find alot of people very willing to pay caps for such items but will never sell them for caps once they bought them.
---
I'm pretty sure people also can change the game files on their Consoles. Already seen that in serveral online games like GTA
---
It’s all good. The internet points don’t bother me. Its just weird that what I said bothered some people apparently lol.
---
Except if you need to craft something.
---
Oh yeah true
---
 I don't care enough to vote but there is a vast amount of Enclave crap already. What are you missing?
---
Well, all these people hoarding legendaries are hoping and expecting to exploit the reroll mechanic. Aquire a buttload of tokens to either get a god roll item super fast or get many God roll items, that's the plan, right?
---
Game designers don't want us to exploit the game mechanics. They don't want ultra rare God roll shit to be that easy to aquire. 
---
Exploiting is bad. Not exploiting is good.
---
Upvote because the Enclave needs some love!
---
I tried crafting the Targeting HUD on the X-01 helmet last night; like you, it made the crafting sound but did not craft the mod.
---
Lucky hole mine, you can leave with over 200 ore when wearing excavator and if you put on super duper, you can end up with 1k lead after smelting all of it
---
Cheating is cheating, this is only a small step from saying "saves you the trouble of having to heal when you take damage" and turning god mode on. Radiation is a game challenge, especially in nuke zones, hence the entire point of this post. Overcoming the challenge using intended mechanics is the thing to do, not exploiting a bug.
---
fuckin', got em!
---
They would never give out rewards for that, it’s too easy!
---
Yeah I can help you out when I'm online next. May not be til tomorrow though. 
---
Want yours modified? Or have the mats for a whole new set of legs?
---
I've always had to use the internet too, same with all the effects on armor and weapons, and many other things in the game
---
That really sucks.... I'm only stuck with the overseer's quest line. I raided all the stashes and listened to all the holotapes, but no luck....
---
Your situation is way worse.
---
fuck do you mean vast amount 
---
name 14  Enclave items you can place at a camp
---
Bring Guar Mounts to the Wasteland 😤
---
Awesome! Tomorrow would be great if the other offers don’t follow through. 
---
I just need one leg modded.
---
I'm stuck on the overseers quest line too. I just assumed I missed one but I didn't. I love this game but this is ridiculous now. It's been almost 6 months.
---
Paranoid much?
---
Soon in the atom shop!
---
I have, still not renameable
---
we all know OP wouldnt be added to the 4 person team thats working on FO76, no, OP would be slapped on TES and working on micro-transactions and its shitty story-line.
---
What in the fuck are ass antlers??
---
Thanks for the feedback! We're going to look into this. :)
---
It really is a pain in the ass to craft Hahahah thanks for the suggestion I'll definitely give that a shot
---
Stash right now: 800/800. 
---
Stash after legendary vendor: 100/800.
---
Yea I got you bubby
---
What
---
ESO does it and it works
---
Thank you for the reports on these! We're investigating them.
---
Wait, mods are commons to all packs? Can the man who came with that idea receive a medal?
---

---
Y/Triangle would likely make the most sense. That's the jump key for PC players
---
You fast travel too much. 
---
I have really enjoyed exploring the whole map. 
---
You're welcome to your opinion, but I have loved the game and think they have clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it.
---
I think in general, games need to have much more customization. It seems like just about every game has the same few things you can customize..
---
 If game makers spent more time thinking about how individual people are and look for in creating characters, instead of focusing on money costing things (crates, drops, different colors/textures of guns, etc) then we could create some awesome SUPER immersive games. 
---
It would be pretty cool if we could even draw the tattoos on our characters and also have them wherever we wanted. 
---
I for example have my whole head tattooed (except face), that would be awesome to re-create in-game.
---
Game makers in general need to step their game up in terms of more customization options.
---
 Why would I care? I have no other faction crap in my CAMP. 
---
 The entire Enclave bunker has no analog anywhere. Fort Defiance is not even close.
---
Message me gt is TLF VileNeptun6
---
sooooo why are you on this post then
---
This. I went to swap to my christmas t-51 for some goodie giving fun yesterday, only to discover I couldn't carry said goodies in non-excavator armor.
---
Yeah, kinda tired of spawning in the bottom of a river.
---
Backpack works with power armor. All I wanted to know.
---
None for me either. Had a couple of server drops last week, but none (yet) since the patch.
---
Hmm might be because of the workshop proximity.  True I think there is also a deathclaw nest in the woods behind the lake but I think that was for a quest though.
---
It's just simplification to the game mechanic due to server lag. Make it more complicated and things will break. For example, how to decide a penalty when both player and monster register their hit consecutively or at the same time amid server lag? One that hit the most dmg or one that lands the kill hit? It's impossible to determine this accurately with server lags. Also, even it is possible to implement the code, Beths's servers will operate so slow like a turtle with endless loading due to extra data that goes between the server and the client (imagine SBQ fight with active 25 players x 1000).
---
I agree with your points though. Just impossible to implement with current Beth's servers. They need better and fast servers and for that it probably needs to be subscription base.
---
sounds good. What's your gamertag? And do you show online or hidden mode? I can look out for you when I'm online next if you show visibly. I recently went incogneto, so I would have to reach out to you when I'm online.
---
Doing the lord's work, son.
---
Previous Fallout games weren’t pitched as survival games though.
---
Those backpacks look sweet!
---
Love the mothman and nuka cola one.
---
Sure but I have limited time that I can participate in.
---
Maybe they'll make a new questline and crafting system for cheese like they did for booze :D
---
Start an alt, try a different build. I have a melee character, a sneak vats character, currently leveling a heavy weapons character, and a shelved commando character I might level up next.
---
Because there isn't? 
---
&gt; Many many reports
---
If it was a real issue and so many people were suffering about it, this would be the top post every day.
---
I mean, did you realize? It's always "coincidentally" their most valuable item which disappear. On the thousand items they own, it's always the TSE that disappears.
---
 It seemed dumb. As I think human stupidity is our main purpose in this universe, for comic relief, you understand, that attracted me. ;)
---
I never use PA. Well except for nuke zones, but if you've got your perks right, you can take out mobs with ease.
---
I appear online and GT is Frank J Lapidus. Seems I may have someone who can do it sooner I’ll report back
---
Thanks for that info. I forgot about that mutation! Im getting the serum for that tonite hopefully!
---
Fake. I spent all my time on my alt two-shotting mobs without issues, because my main and his shotgun couldn't do half the same damage. Since all ennemies come at close range super fast it doesn't make any difference
---
Assuming that's not also going to be a thing. Next week's tiny info dump is going to look at vending and CAMP decor, they might very well announce it next week. And yeah, sure, it might even be an atom shop thing, but so long as it's no better than the in-game backpack effect, I am a-okay with it.
---
ok but why are you on this post though if you're just gonna be a trolly cunt about it
---
You're usually better off without power armor for 90% of the game. I only spec into it for specific situations.
---
For all we know it could be one of those CAMP items they mention you getting with your badges. They have clearly implemented some of the "necessary technology".
---
That’s what the existing shitty rng is for. To keep the god tier items rare.
---
There's a lot of goodnon pa legendary armor with all kinds of different effects, just getting your hands on what you want is the hard part. Pa until then
---
There isn’t a end to the overseers side quest line yet
---
Give this player a break. True there are many bugs some of them critical. This ain’t it but it’s a twitch factor (looking at you, Hunters Lomgcoat). No harm in posting.
---
When is this update happening?
---
Nope, gonna pass.
---
 Don't use it. I don't even know what button its on, well it was Q in F4. ;)
---
You could use some perks and have some protection in a rad suit.  The biggest challenge is the radioactive aura around the Scorchbeast Queen and the rad spray attack, but Whitespring ghoulds in a rad suit isn't a problem especially with some perks like Barbarian, Evasive and Scaly Skin mutation.  Reactor portion of a nuke silo might also be a problem.
---
Personally I'd say to keep 1-2 suits of PA on any build, and just use as needed.
---
I just scored a 3claw instagating deathclaw gaunlet last nite too.
---
Ok I'm happy to be the backup plan.
---
It's also the "search" button. Not sure they want to map it to do 2 functions it may effect the container search feature/perks.
---
ah, i didnt realize this was the case. now i understand an interaction that happened when my wife was killed and we weren't aggro or nearby anyone.
---
&gt; A few of the mods you that you can learn to craft include: increased carry capacity (it is a backpack, after all), armor plating for more damage resistance, and **even a refrigeration unit,** 
---
REFRIGERATED BACKPACKS
---
u/yellowspaces Interesting. Once I finished the Bucket List, I was able to rename the camera.
---
Damn I want the sloth or the baby mothman😂
---
As far as I know, they isn’t any more to collect at the moment.
---
ProTip; this means your schools IT person has set an exception in the network content filter for Reddit implying either they or someone they report to is a hardcore Redditor.
---
This triggers so many bad memories of 'I'm going to pick this up' and EATING WHATEVER IT IS INSTEAD.
---
The Mr. Fuzzy one looks cool too
---
Swing speed, and block speed. Lower AP cost. I rock an AA swing speed combat knife, and it does more than enough damage to deal with the pve enemies I end up in melee range for.
---
I think your explanation makes the most sense. Seems like every issue goes back to how ill-equipped FO4's engine is for an MMO
---
I think it's more or less trying to get returning players to come back once regulars die off to keep there numbers stable lol no on
---
Dang, that is so disappointing considering they have all of those nice models and texture already in game.
---
Anytime mate :)
---
Has anyone tried taking a picture of that alien in the cryo freeze place
---
Sure, but it depends on your perks, play style, build, armor, etc. I mean, you have people running around in nuke zones with just a hazmat suit. I'm relatively low level (40) but I just use excavator for fast travel while encumbered. If you're in the end game, I can't speak to that but I assume it's the same unless you're just running nuke zones.
---
 At first I did not understand what you even wanted. I'm still confused about that.
---
 There is more actual Enclave stuff and possibility than any other faction in the game by a rather large amount.
---
Yea it is disappointing, still not sure if the keg stand Plan has even been added in yet either.
---
Just remember, as per the Inside The Vault not all of those models made it in the game.
---
Hats where most normal people get their tattoos so I don’t see what’s wrong with it
---
Wow - they look great ! I guess we better prepare for the debate of " If they provide carry weight they are PTW ". Uggh - some people can't just enjoy new things !
---
Every body on the project would be invaluable, even if you could only be there for a few minutes.  Most of the extras would just be walking across a street or standing around so those parts would be very brief.
---
That true haha
---
Along the bottom of your screen there is a legend and what the buttons do. The button to craft will be "attach" if it's a mod. If it's not a mod it'll say "build". This way you can definitely confirm you are "building" from a plan and not attaching from a mod.
---
The reason your current pictures aren't definitive is because you can simply place the mod in a paper bag and send us all these screen shots of your inventory/stash while also picking it back up and then sending screen shots of the build menu.
---
It seems theres some users (possibly bots) tearing through this sub, downvoting everything in sight. 
---
I too would like to see more unique hidden areas on the map. I used to go wander the map all the time, but after a while, I realized that there's literally nothing to find, so I stopped exploring.
---
I am stucked with Biv's tipsy quest where you register extra hit after drinking a hoppy. I never be able to register this extra dmg no matter what I do. Some quests are broken.
---
Nothing from the atom store has been learnable. These mods say specifically that they are.
---
Gg on reading before posting though.
---
You sure he didn't just take the workshop over? Or maybe built close to it but not in the circle?
---
You can get like 500 carryweight in power armor lol maybe more
---
May 9th.
---
I have a mule on my wife's account that is literally full of 1 star junk I have gotten for free (or bought for 10 caps off the vendors) just waiting. It's a paltry haul, but considering I never run whitesprings or anything else for legendaries specifically, it's not bad, and a lot of it is low weight armor. Fairly sure I have about 150 pieces, maybe 200 stars ready.
---
I read it, don’t trust them.  The greed is too high.
---
I must’ve skipped over that. Thank you for the info!
---
Oh well that explains that.
---
Hmm... maybe i should take a new tripp there, lv175 and only been there once, at that time it was full of "cave crickets" i hate those things, they refuse to stand still while i kill them :/
---
He claimed the workshop from you.  There is a zone in and around all workshops where you cannot place your camp.  This game mechanic is working as intended.
---
I mainly use it to find enemies especially when its dark and I also use it in survival haha everyone is different tho. I've just never had this happen.
---
I had no issues with the alcohol crafting quests but I agree. Quests are broken to shit.
---
Looking forward to this update!
---
If the backpack works and players are happy with it they could easily copy paste some code and reuse a fridge mesh.
---
It's not the fridge we wanted but this is only 2 weeks away, that's great news.
---
"Howdy, pardner! I need to haul arse to yon Watoga place, the BOS wants some of my pew pews! Escort me there alive, and one o' dem Pew Pew's is yours!"
---
\*drops bag containing a Mutant's Pipe Wrench\*
---
Right now I’m rocking a Bloodied DCG and doing around 2000 Dmg. When I was running 2H I was getting maybe 600-700
---
Something will happen soon with player vending. Reason is that your cap count can change at any time.
---
Say you have 20k in caps in your vending machine. Someone comes and wants it all and your carrying 10k in caps already. What, they can only buy 15k instead of all of it?
---
Something will happen with caps. Not sure what but with player vending the current set up won't work properly.
---
Yes I had the exact same problem the last couple weeks, was hoping the fixed it with the patch but haven't tried again yet.
---
Thank you now I can't wait!
---
Isn't it the search button only before you actually open the inventory, or does it also apply after you fully open the container? I imagined this system being you have to actually open the container and highlight the item to consume it, not do it through the quick view menu.
---
Very viable. I have more defense than power armor with proper mutations, perks, and good armor. The only time I ever use power armor is when I'm in a nuke zone. Power armor hasn't been viable to use since the days of Fallout 3. 4 made it as durable as tissue paper, and 76 made it feel like it runs off Dollar Store brand batteries.... Not to mention in PvP it's totally worthless. You cannot use legendary effects from armor with PA, and you have to lug heavy batteries around, not sure why anyone thinks it's a good thing tbh.
---
... Do they even need to be angry? I've seen folks nuke people's camps for the lulz.
---
Does the button on your controller work just find for other things?
---
I clearly wasn't advocating for them being in the Atom Shop, just pointing out that they arent going to make these and then give them out for free when they can put them in the Atom Shop for a limited time for 15 dollars.
---
The projectile for the explosive legendary effect has "stagger: none" in the ESM. I don't know if this parameter is actually used for anything though. If it's really +20% damage then there are code overrides somewhere. You'd need to test it.
---
Yeah, but water, food, and chems weigh .05 lbs for me now, and I carry a bit, so I'm better off not in PA. Getting into Excavator puts me very close to the 450 limit. To each their own, but PA has always felt slow to me.
---
Think they plan to extend the no build zone there
---
Or, y'know, maybe you're just being a paranoid idiot that's thinking just because we got the Repair Kits in the shop means everything from now on will only be in the shop.
---
Actually, it's May 7th, was off by 2 days.
---
And you believe them? Still?
---
I really hope that the backpacks' appearance will be toggleable. For some outfits, they'll be a really nice touch, but we should have the option to "hide" them when we want to.
---
With proper cards, and armor legendary effects, I can carry far more than in power armor. Weight reduction perks ftw.
---
&gt;The Double XP Weekend should be starting right now according to what I read?
---
Yes, 12PM Eastern Time is when it starts. So, 2 minutes ago.
---
&gt;Does the Pioneer thing come out now as well, or is that on May 7th?
---
That comes out on May 7th.
---
When reaching the lvl requirements for the specific PA’s the mods for it will pop up at vendors in whitespring. 
---
Good travels
---
Ditto with the mutations.  God bless Google.
---
Omg. Ty
---
At a minimum, open up the red rocket stations for fast travel as well, and any other transportation hubs - ports/docks along rivers, airfields, etc - the idea being that you’re paying someone to transport you, right?
---
Never heard of this happening before. Need more data... might be that the no build zones are broken. Might be a cheat. Might be that you lost it during a defend event and he claimed it.  My camp is permanent or I'd try placing it at other workshops.
---
Nice name slinging.  😂😂. You’re a cool guy 😎
---
ESO does this and it's just little things you get. Crown store poisons, some random gold or other in game currency. If you hit all the days, you usually get a pet or something cosmetic. They've given away DLC before though. If you want the item, you literally just have to log in. No action needed. If you don't want the big item, most the things you get are deleted anyway, so you are missing literally nothing.
---
Atom Shop? 
---
Did we read the same article?
---
I don’t like or wear power armor either I was just curious as to how you could get 500+ carryweight without it
---
 Slow and boring. My Combat Knives are just so entertaining and generally stronger than most 2H weapons.
---
 With a Vanilla Serrated Combat knife repaired to 200% putting out 150 Damage with 10%+ for Glowing Meat Steak and 25% for Twisted Muscles I hit very hard and do that maybe 3 times a second ... basically till the mouse breaks. DPS from hell baby. 
---
 Now my Legendary Nocturnal 40% Speed one is beyond ridiculous and melts Ghoul Hordes so fast people complain.
---
Can I make them invisible?
---
I’m pretty sure there’s more fasnact related camp items than any other faction which is quite disheartening.
---
I hold up just fine in Survival. I have a maze-like CAMP over some water. Using aqua boy, marsupial, bird bones, speed demon, high AP etc. a lot of players struggle keeping up with me as I swiftly navigate from water to sky to water to through this hole in the wall, etc.
---
Ya it does I played another game to make sure Its been like this for a couple days of playing and I thought it might have glitched but even after the patch the other day it was still like that
---
Yeah but most of the weight reduction perks pair with the excavator power armor and calibrated shocks don’t they?
---
Same, I have a small pile of legendary big guns and the matching perk, it's getting annoying to look for new drops in the giant list.
---
Are these late game quests? Do they drop as plans?
---
yeah, and the new better looking stairs with platform... :/
---
Some datamined very nice skins for the handmade has also not shown up yet :/
---
My power armor only comes out for nukezones, Monster Mash, the Encryptid, and occasionally when I'm overburdened.  Anything else the (well designed, I must say) decrease in perception/liight levels/quality of map markers  makes me feel really claustrophobic. My non-PA armor has me up to about 300 damage resistance, no fall damage, auto-stimming, 20% weapon weight reduction, and chameleon.
---
50 in what ever the range the game says it its .
---
&gt;I can vats things at least a hundred feet out. 100 yards is exaggeration, sure.
---
no you cant. do you even play fallout 76 lol?
---
He stairs unfortunately can only be bought in atom shop
---
This is a mandatory improvement!!
---
Yeah, but I wanted to check and see if anyone had any data first. Hard to test when there’s not a good way to set a control. Also didn’t know if the explosive projectile had a default stagger. As opposed to adding tank killer.
---
That's a great point! Could be part of the reason they delayed player vending to test the waters on raising the Cap limit alongside it
---
Amen but i already have 68 perks to choose and nothing to do with them...we need some more perk cards or something else to do with them.
---
It's on the forehead! I was about to buy that
---
Barfestha has been less than truthful on multiple occasions.
---
I'm curious how the backpacks will play with outfits that already have a backpack, like the field scribe uniform.
---
We need faction flags for our bases and defiantly need enclave themed clothing, there is loads for the brotherhood.
---
If you nuke slightly west of morgantown you will be able to get over 100 raw cobalt with green thumb between Mama Dolce's and the train station. Made 15 stable with super duper a couple days ago.
---
Double XP should be live and the pioneer stuff is may 7th.
---
My buddy and I have 3 mules filled up with max stash and max weight of legendaries. Not a single one of them are any good weapons, found only one two shot weapon (crossbow) a decent amount of 3* armor and weapons, but none are any good. We probably have 2000 weapons and armor to dump onto the vendor, or onto the ground if it doesn’t work like how we think
---
How do you level your chars? Via the quests? Tried it till 10 or 15ish and got  bored,  wanted to farm WS but the 62 ghouls too strong.
---
Same here, i just added headlamp mod after they fixed mods, but can't craft the Targeting HUD.
---
Question from me is what about gear that already has a backpack.  Currently I wear traveling leather coat.  Will that be able to be used or will it be unwearable if you want a backpack? Will the current backpack on the outfit turn funtional?
---
It is a shame that this comment doesn’t have more upvotes
---
or custom flags we can design in a menu with certain words locked out
---
Yeah I have every PA except X-01 on my person, and Portable Power 3 makes them weigh 2.5lbs each. Downside is I have to permanently have that card equipped heh. Being melee, having Martial Artist 3 is amazing and helps keep carry weight down.
---
Interested as well; only level 26 but I've played quite a bit since I got the game
---
That’s fair.
---
Absolutely. Stop asking for easy mode please.
---
Pls
---
 Felicia, is that you?
---
yup, i know, but the one currently there is the single stairs without the platform, if you check your build menu in camp you can see a new with platform as well ...
---
That's would be cool but I can imagine the flags people are gonna make 😂
---
No, he read the one he made up.
---
Yep, I completed it yesterday, all taken in the forest
---
Unfortunately, yes. We can inspect the item and look at a freaking cardboard box up close but they cant tell us a damn thing about it until you actually attempt to attach it.
---
Ok cool post
---
Nope, you can get buttressed from your first scrap. Same chance as any other marine armor mod, IIRC 0.65% per mod.
---
Welded's unlocked by default. Hardened is fairly common as a mod drop. None of the marine material mods are plan-only.
---
I wanna know the epic bug this time
---
Do wait reduction perks not work when in PA?
---
That's actually a brilliant strategy.
---
I have about 2400 pounds of 3 star legendaries 😂.  Farming life of a level 171.
---
This won't happen for the same reason we can't use purified water when cooking. The crafting system is so rudimentary it can't be told "to make item X, consume materials A and B OR C". To add something like this they'd have to redesign the whole crafting interface pulled from FO4 and to them it's just more trouble than it's worth for a small QOL increase. It's annoying, but unlikely to change.
---
Or that is simply due to that fact you would actually miss a TSE, as opposed to the random Hunter's Pole Hook. This is a frequently reported issue, and has been since November.
---
Well yeah but that's why certain words or designs would just bump you out of it
---
think of the glorious military designs we could make
---
Stop you’re telling everyone where my CAMP is! I don’t like neighbors. EVERYONE DONT LISTEN TO THIS MAN, THIS SPOT SUCKS AND YOU SHOULDNT BUILD HERE. NOThING IS THERE DON’T EVEN BOTHER GOING THAT WAY.
---
&gt;I never did it but I've played with people that could kill you with one if you didn't heal.
---
I did that a few times. My bloodied swing speed switchblade does somewhere in the range of 650 damage per stab, so even with slap damage you were going down in 10-15 seconds if you weren't healing.
---
i have ? darn :/ not again...
---
Or maybe you just need to learn how the game works. No his camp was not in the workshop.
---
Who beyond level 100 is seeking XP? If I could shut off all future leveling at this point I would do it...
---
may 7th
---
You've been cured of bone worms
---
Youve contracted bone works
---
At least it's not full-blown boneitis
---
That's even better thank you 😭
---
PA overrides all the armor  and effects of what you are wearing. The only things that still apply weight reduction are those cards you have equipped.
---
NEVER use power armor. hate it. i run bloodied build melee.  
---
was fighting the queen and the only one there without power armor. granted i had to use radx and rad away 2-4x during fight but it can be done. the fight took place outside nuke zone but you can go without it.    
---
If whitesprings gets nuked i go in and fight with hazmat suit on. tough but can be done. im lvl 91
---
There’s no reason to rule out atom shop backpacks at this point.
---
yes, just play the game over again, doing the quests. To speed it up, try to get the cranberry relish recipe, + sleep is +15% xp.
---
If you go to WS when it's NOT nuked, or other high level players have not spawned high level ghouls, the ghouls are lower level.
---
Hell you can contract diseases just by standing near an enemy, its happened to me tons of times
---
Heart of the swamp is basically this.
---
Here’s one QA missed. If you have your camera in hand and sit down in a chair or on a couch, you can now use the emote wheel. Insignificant, but that’s new and not mentioned anywhere
---
I know it was a nice gesture but being power leveled the first time playing is kind of a negative.   Leveling and adventuring alone is really a non-issue in FO76.
---
It is somewhat dangerous. Last person I invited decided it was a good idea to take shots at a scorched beast after i had just passified it. 
---
Turns out there isnt much cover in the middle of a lake.
---
Yeah, that was probably an issue. It wasn't actually a loading issue either. I had mine on top of my camp for a bit (before I accidentally scrapped it) and it always worked properly.
---
Yes I know lol. I got really good at CAMP, while lagging behind here in leveling for PvP. I think by the end of this 2x Xp weekend I’ll be close to my final build.
---
and you don't even sell them in atom shop? good news
---
A lot of people in this thread upset that their exploit has been made public
---
If a TSE weapon is considered super common, then raising the cap limits is not going to improve the economy.
---
That wasn't a Scorched Beast Queen ... It was just a baby. And no it's not a part of the quest, that was just a random flying around doing bat things. You'll see them from time to time.
---
Random guy graduates from tadpole, immediately destroys a lvl 30 player’s camp.
---
I remember like, waaaaay back months ago it was low-xp in the bunkers. The first time I went in there I was thinking "oh this will be great for XP farming" but then realized they give almost none.
---
You said you managed to log in and find it again, is it a certain area it spawns?
---
Player vending next Inside the Vault though. I'm ready to have an actual shop set up
---
What loot did it drop
---
C*
---
Maybe its time to get out them tinfoil hats.
---
I was so busy being an 80s man, I forgot about my boneitis!
---
most people bulk to sell, not for weight
---
So bizarre. Can’t help but wonder if this was overlooked..? Maybe they are encouraging online participation?
---
I NEED that baby megasloth backpack.
---
I wonder if I could wear backpacks with outfits that already have backpacks on them.
---
Go to the bulletin board in Lewisburg and look at the small notes in the bottom
---
This one involves and gives competitive advantage , doesn’t involve emotes or flying across the map.
---
Serious serious problem if somebody figures this one out
---
Huh, . . . today's  ITV kind of made it sound like it would show up with the next big update. Interesting that you just stumbled upon it.
---
"ARCHERY"
---
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Yes, you are spot on too. Beths just slap a multiplayer mechanic to single player game built with old engine. Imagine building a simple road made with gravels to function as freeway to Internet. There will be lots of traffic jump due to slow gravel pathway and too many automobiles.
---
I laugh when Beth changed stash container to not auto-open (we gotta press e now). They must be seriously concerned with their servers to do this tiny performance savings.
---
sticking your head in the sand doesnt mean that the world stops
---
i can only hope when it happens to you, you will still deny its a thing lol
---
With how Rocky things have been you’d figure having it done right the first time would be better for job security :)
---
Do you know how the game determines aoe for an explosion?
---
Is that in the carnivorous forest? Because if so, then why would Bethesda hide him there?
---
they fixed it!
---
Tell me you have a screenshot!?
---
I cracked up at SBQ.
---
I think it's only possible in workshops and in places in FO4 because it's a dedicated spot already. Your camp is already a fast travel point and it's pretty innacurate because you can place that fast travel point almost anywhere on the map. So this would be a fast travel point to a fast travel point now times that by everyone else on a server and the whole thing goes to shit.
---
I've hit that issue as well but in all but a few the body turns into a dead robot.
---
Seems like there are bots downvoting all new posts in this sub as of late
---
They had them early on. Mine still worked until recently when I moved camp and was unable to place it.
---
IN ATOM SHOP FOR ONLY 1000 ATOMS
---
I feel the same way, even if it’s a small, simple thing to do. Atleast doing it feels like you’re earning your reward and half the time stuff like that is a good way to get me back into the flow is game and keeps me playing for a little while longer.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhah2w/the_sheepsquach_lives/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
yeah they severely increased the spoil rate of foods/flux/drinks just so they could introduce fridges and the specialized backpacks
---
Create an issue, sell the solution!
---
smells like shitty mobile game strategy to me
---
On XB1, the aforementioned lever action was duped and there's a boatload of them floating around. For some reason they are getting super expensive, to match genuine weapons with perfect rolls. 
---
I don't think raising the Cap limit will fix that specific issue. But I hope it makes trading weapons that are genuinely super rare or legacy easier to come by. Having to pay 35k for a weapon is a pain in the ass because both players have to switch characters to do so.
---
Explosive legendaries didn't seem to self-stagger in the tests I did. They do tend to cripple all your limbs though, even if you're taking no HP damage. That was a pre-nerf test, for what that's worth.
---
The guy two posts down does (see "SHEEPSQUATCH LIVES").
---
Nah on my first character I walked as much as possible because I usually like to see every inch of the map on fallout games. I even found every location. This was all within a month after launch. I know some things have slightly changed now since then at certain locations.
---
ahhh.... that one, found it, lol
---
Goodness. They're all so cool looking!
---
I imagine maybe like 3 people would downvote without actually reading (because people are idiots) 
---
but I can't imagine 7 normal people would lol
---
I need to pay more attention on the next nuke
---
Yes, I just saw that now. Looks like they're finally here!
---
Haha yeah i realized not. Still fairly new to game
---
Try inspecting the emote wheel. Very fun
---
I actually had one of these and used it quite often when I was low level...it was only lvl 20 so I got rid of it.
---
Yeah I looked,  for every upvote there's a downvote immediately placed
---
Not the perks on your armor.
---
I really hope that the Tirelike backpack was finally included. Best one IMO hands down.
---
dont agree with someone's opinion? call them an idiot! it just works for Fireboy!
---
kinda feel sorry for you
---
Cards yes, armor legendary effects don't however.
---
I had one and some how lost it I’m a stealth melee build but only use it to take down the cargo bot
---
Sorry I’d rather be in adventure, Bethesda butchered the rewards for survival so there is literally no point.
---
Did they remove this?? If so, why???
---
Then don't report it so it won't get fixed so only the grinders know it.
---
Good logic bro.
---
Because no one goes there?
---
Oh I know what you're talking about. It's been like that for a long time.
---
Ah ok didn’t notice
---
I know how the game works. Maybe you need to know what youre talking about I claimed the workshop. As im putting up turrets, he comes along and places his camp. No contested workshop, its still green as im watchin him do it. He didnt een approach the workshop bench to contest it.  Tho ill say, today has been especially bad for little glitches and bugs cropping up. Usually its just little dumb crap thats annoying. But today, its been weird. Rooms im in disappearing and giving full view of "outside" but unable to move, been dc'd several times over the past hour, and each time i come back on and im missing resources or ammo or caps.

I also made a few pics

He had regular legendary drop and his skull, horns and his spikes as junk items
---
You’re only cheating yourself in this case.
---
Yes, especially when the quest location is just a tiny, translucent yellow circle.
---
Sweet
---
To keep him away from kiddies (including me) in low level areas?
---
Curious about the nuke zone experiment that this will undoubtedly lead to.
---
Did you read the article? Literally no where in it were the words Atomic shop. In fact, they even specify you’re earning the backpack through quests.
---
At least now we can customize the names, so i label them T45, T51 etc
---
Sounds like we're in the same boat then. I left the floating wire there in case in randomly comes back one day with an update or something. As for it taking up budget I'm pretty sure it still does but I'm not positive
---
Regular legendary drop and his skull, horns and his spikes as junk items
---
Either that or im an idiot and just can't see it. It's highly possible I'm an idiot and just can't see it...
---
I was gonna say, it snows at my camp all the time.. But I'm on the top of a mountain with no real trees nearby

He did not take it over. Was not claimed when i took it over, to this very moment still in my name.

Hope you don't mind, reference on my bug Roundup.

---
selling bulk cloth probably
---
Avoiding doppelgängers , people that claim they just found something , and to avoid making the game worse.
---
Shit nobody I’ve encounter so far has done such thing to me so I won’t even bother showing nor bother to prove anybody.
---
Just pure honest opinion about the lack of QA
---
Gonna look for him after work. I’m wondering what else was released.
---
Try a new character. Don't be surprised when your level 250 main is running out of perks to get.
---
I'd like to see them release new weapons and armor as well as create new sought after effects that will make the otherwise boring and stale selection we see in the market daily more exciting. This would probably help lower some prices and stimulate the market again.
---
His camp was built right around the junk pile next to the ind. water purifier. Go troll somewhere else jackass
---
Well that’s not the greatest excuse, because deathclaw island is just west of vault 76, which would be a difficult fight that early on as well.
---
There's an event that spawned near the Southern Belle Motel for me that involves herding Brahmin that spawned one for me. Level 80 legendary for me.
---
This is the first time ive seen or heard this myself.
---
They should give us something for all the times we get disconnected after spending caps, mats on workshops only to be disconnected from server. I support this!
---
So the datamined picture wasn't a hoax. Looks the same.
---
I some of the BoS plans at Grafton Steel just last week (legs. still looking for the rest). Here's a video showing where ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAWD0vmkwk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAWD0vmkwk)).
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday, but only with the PA pieces I had equipped. So 4 calibrated shocks in total...
---
And I'll be hunting this later on..
---
I don’t go very far out of my way to farm legendaries, but I’ve been saving every level 45+ 3* I find. I also have some good legends I’ve been holding for player vending, a few people will be pretty stoked that they checked my vending machine...
---
Burtal!
---
It takes pictures?  I thought it was a teleportation device to avoid griefing.
---
I was searching random spawns around the Bog for a Mega Sloth.
---
Experienced this yesterday on Xbox 1
---
It doesn’t show on certain missions since launch. I’d suck if they removed it completely...
---
Dunno. I think I just had luck and logged back in the server I was in- since I found the same type of Legendary Sheepsquach fighting the same Moleminers.
---
You think that earning the general rank in Enclave stopped Bethesda from selling X-01 skins in the atomic cash shop?  I’m enjoying the naivety.
---
I’m not saying you need to. It’s an advantage if you can, though. You can’t wipe the ghouls in Whitesprings before they can touch you, disease you, irradiate you, damage your armor... I can clear Whitesprings without taking a hit if I want to. I can also do it from over your shoulder and steal all your calls ;)
---
And I don’t have to do it from 100 feet- I can do the same from 3 feet away. Vats, head is almost always already targeted, click boom. I’m a bloody vats rifleman build, even supermutants die in a single headshot, sneak isn’t really required.
---
I have an unarmed build that doesn't use bloodied or anything like that, and I steamrolled my way through the game. Instigating power fist can 1 shit almost anything with the right drugs. The only enemies that I have any trouble with are bears that spam the stagger attack, and colonel gutsy robots.
---
I enjoy this game, but man.  This games needs serious work and is in a very questionable state.
---
A game I enjoy but cannot recommend.
---
I don’t see these being sold as an atom shop purchase? It clearly stated a mod you can learn not buy
---
Ive also not had to do anything to defend except take out a couple of waves of scorched. Ive played this game long enough to know the difference between contention and the event: defend.
---
Stop making shit up.
---
It's in Creekside Grove. I was searching random spawns for a Megasloth, so it's likely not a static spawn for the Sheepsquach - just a random spawn.
---
make clothing with them, sells for more...
---
You can contest workshops now without hitting the button, long as you're inside the boundary. I didn't know you could build during a contest though.
---
What are they doing to run people out of there? I love FO76, but I'm not about to pretend it doesn't have some severe issues that don't lend themselves to a fun PvP experience, which is why I don't PvP. So I'm honestly unaware of what they've managed to screw up there, but if it's on the level of this issue or the ever-popular "you can't do direct damage, but you CAN blow up cars as players run by and kill them that way!", I can see why Survival players are walking. 
---
If it's just "we get better stuff and caps by coming to Adventure and using any means possible to kill Adventure players because Survival players don't have loot anymore", not so much. That's the vibe most of these other replies have given. I'm honestly interested in hearing what's up in Survival. What could they do better to get PvP players back over there?
---
Lol ya me too
---
The one I killed dropped a random legendary, mysterious fur, 2 large sheepsquatch horns, 5 mysterious quills, a sheepsquatch skull, and 2 sheepsquatch meat.
---
Ok. Gotcha. I’ll keep that in mind.
---
&gt; For loot I got: (2) Large Sheepsquach horns - bone, Mysterious Fur -  cloth + ballistic fiber, (5) Mysterious Quills - bone; a Sheepsquach  skull - bone and one slice of Sheepsquach meat (plus a one star  legendary). 
---
edited with the loot drop!
---
It’s still in there. On PS4 it’s R1 iirc. Not all missions will show you the location but a lot will
---
Agreed! There were a lot of unique weapons from older fallout games (please give me the Dog Gun and M1 Garand aka This Machine) that I would love to see in here.
---
Also I thought about new prefixes too. Maybe instead of explosive they could have electric, poison, radiation and other secondary damages too. I know we have the radium rifle and tesla but still be cool for other weapons to have those effects
---
I'm all for increasing the severity of diseases, but they can't have the near 100% infection rate they currently have. One single hit from a diseased ghoul will almost always give you rad worms or glowing postules.
---
Like someone else said, there is a 3 hour cool-down, but the event has to be manually started by a player by using the recall card they get from finishing the related quests, or buy a recall card to repair and use from a vendor (costs 1700-2300-ish caps depending on your charisma/perks).  
---
The imposter sheepsquatch can almost one shot kill everyone. Make sure that all 3 pylons have been activated or you won't do barely any damage to it and you'll just waste your bullets shooting it without the pylons activated.  
---
Just make sure you dump your junk in your stash before going to the event and just know that you'll probably die a few times. Just die let yourself die and respawn, but try to revive fallen people who are pylon conduits since they're the ones keeping the sheepsqatch vulnerable (Don't even both reviving the randos who aren't conduits)
---
Do the quest Free Range (;
---
Nice thought but I can see this getting annoying if all the missiles and spoiled food I drop keep getting returned to me by some well-meaning bystander. Before long, i'd have to start making trips to the middle of nowhere to drop my garbage lol.
---
I felt like this too. There is a building across the lake (kinda factory looking icon iirc) and I got excited that it would be special in a way being all the way over there but there’s not much there save for a few mutants
---
lets not go down that road
---
Or even worse... everything drops, mobs and other players can (and will) loot your corpse.. AND if you took too long to get back to your corpse it could decay and disappear... taking everything with it.
---
This man is wise. Listen to him. There is nothing to see here. Move along.
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!! GET AWAY FROM MY STUFF!!!!!
---
CAMP objects now load pretty slowly long after you load into the world so that's another reason it doesn't work
---
I just got a traveling leather coat, I hope it doesn't clash 🤞💅🏽
---
Your daily reward is the vendor caps resetting lmao
---
Same, my favorite outfits are the science scribe and the engineer and they both have things on their backs :(
---
Good to know, cheers.
---
People are afraid, after a consistent industry-wide strategy of increasing microtransactions.
---
Ha, dying in the game is save scumming? Gtfoh.
---
I found my sloth west of Harper's ferry, under a bridge. Follow the road west from the red rocket that's a little south of Harper's, its random. But I've had success there.
---
The main advantage they have is in big fights such as scorchbeast queen. While one player may have to fast travel away and back to repair their main weapon or teplace their camp, others can just buy repair kits and keep their weapon repaired through the whole fight. Ultimately, things that give you even a slight advantage in farming or getting items are enough to be a competitive advantage over players who don't buy repair kits. As for pvp, it obviously depends on your weapon, but energy weapons specifically will break at least once in long pvp fights especially if you werent expecting to pvp. Having to stop and repair for 10 seconds is a lot better than having a broken weapon. Its not that big of a deal right now, but its the principle itself of not being able to buy an advantage that's being harmed.
---
Ruined caps, pointless spawn killing, abuse of invulnerability, no one caries anything.
---
THERE IS NO RISK. They shipped the mode where danger could be at any turn. It’s not like that at all.
---
Lauching yourself into any deep body of water will result in you continuing at that speed until you come into contact with land again.  This works in power armor as well. Its a simple design with the floor traps and a stash box.
---
Maybe you're looking at it upside down.
---
Other players are even less impactful on your experience than actual NPCs in any other game. For the most part you’ll be wandering by yourself and on occasion feel relieved to find another player who will likely drop you some ammo or junk they don’t need, throw up a heart emoji, and go their separate way.
---
If an outfit already has a backpack, then backpacks you equip will not appear (similar to how it works for Power Armor). However, you should still receive the backpack's benefits (carry capacity, mods you've applied, etc.)
---
I've had that problem before, when it wouldn't load. Usually it would be back up in either a few hours or the next day. Its letting me access it but its only showing me items I've already purchased. I've never seen that before.
---
Just curious what makes you think that?  Has Bethesda addressed this at all?
---
Pics?
---
Proof?
---
I don't sell junk or clothing anyway, I farm items and still hit my cap limit daily
---
So much love for the Enclave, glad to see it! Come help us rebuild this great nation!
---
Yikes. They really screwed the pooch on that one, huh?
---
Who even cares. There is literally junk everywhere. Just go in any direction and get more.
---
Nah, better idea is daily exp bonus od pve damage buff for short period like in games like Overwatch where you get extra xp for first win of the day
---

---
A passive perk in a legendary slot would be cool too. Something like a passive lockpick perk that makes it to where you don't need all three perks equipped. I've also thought about weapons, similar to Vampire's, that heal your radiation with each hit. That would be nice in nuke zones (granted you can share Rad Sponge, but this assumes you're not on a team). Maybe we should make a comprehensive weapon suggestion list.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a nuka grape can also spawn in that in fraternity house in Morgantown that you visit for the nukashine quest. The room with the nuka cola collectors room.
---
Check earlier posts
---
Also, Scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens everywhere. Big ones. That don't take damage. And like super irradiated. Basically you just guarantee your demise. Maybe try living in the Ash Heap. Much more interesting there.
---
Where is this perk at so I can grab it?
---
Just saw it that's awesome man I cant wait to see it myself!!
---
It’s weird - I swear I saw their description in the workshop last week but I closed it then reopened it and they were gone.
---
I started to, but realized how long it was going to be before the vendor was in the game, and stash space was more important. XD
---
Indeed, there are so many things they can do different, but I don’t work for BGS so there isn’t much I can do to help.
---
That would explain why I saw it randomly and then never again
---
Explosions have three radius parameters: Inner, outer and IS. I'm not sure what these are used for, but IS seems to be the most consistent for the damage radius. 200 for legendary explosive, 500 for most grenades, 780 for nuka grenade.
---
Does anyone know if this stacks with the bonus survival xp? I have a lvl 5 character I'm thinking about putting through hell.
---
Well it'll help me round out my sniper. Now if I could get some non-berserker weapons to work with that'd be great.
---
it does
---
Hope you don't mind, noted this on my [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 8.5 | 04/22/209 (Wild Appalachia)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhalgb/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_85/)
---
Ghoulish, Rad spounge and vaccinated almost reduce the risk for getting hit by ghouls to zero. Like I can be completely surrounded by the entire pack of ghouls from the club and it does almost nothing while I tonk them down one by one. So really I don't see the advantage personally, I cab see how others will see it though depending on their build.
---
\+++ Perforator and Infiltrator Variants! HoT dAyum!

"While you won’t be able to see it [your backpack] while wearing Power Armor, you will still benefit from its carry weight bonus and the current utility mod you’ve applied."
---
Thank goodness! Looks like I'll keep building up my recently created PA character while checking out this update!
---
Experienced this last night on PS4.  X-01 Targeting HUD wouldn't attach even though it makes the sounds as if it did.
---
It is annoying to say the least that you have to server hope flamethrower traps to get enough fuel just to use a flamer at all.
---
Cool.... I will add you later on . What's you're timezone ? Mine is GMT it's now 6.30 pm
---
Oh that's awesome, thanks! Will sure try this in a bit.
---
The other 2 should also be documented in my post history
---
Fun fact, the film is technically "ammo", so if you equip ammosmith you can make larger batches for the same amount of mats.
---
Ew, people leave it as that? I'm on PS3/4, and I always change button configurations to be more in line with other games. X should be jump, not triangle.
---
And thank you
---
Can confirm, killed the Sheepsquach, but couldn't save the cows.
---
I can carry more legendaries!!!!
---
That legendary vendor needs to arrive sooner than latter, my inventory is completely full
---
What do these have to do with pay to win stuff? They're from a quest line.
---
I dont mind at all, this just improves visibility. Thanks!
---
Only if it involves a white panel van and candy.
---
:) PC?
---
I think they'll be hard to notice because of Pip-boy and armor covering your body even when undressed
---
It’s nice for earning new or extra perk cards or trading a few points
---
Spooky

i’m commenting here just to say, hi juicehead! know you’re gonna see this
---
I have almost 40, hell yeah.
---
still with the mistress of mystery veil of shadows i see
---
They don't say either way honestly
---
Yes. All details in new Inside the Vault.
---
Nice! Did you get any new loot?
---
Guaranteed ballistic fiber drops. Yes! This was a perfect combo like the other big game in the wasteland.
---
But...what if I need it later...like I wanna remember that time I...hm...what is this from? Was this one from the Brotherhood or...nevermind.
---
The point is, I need all the notes because...just because.
---
\*Shrug\*   
---
My already "thick" skin is getting more so, Reddit and BethNet is full of people who downvote or flame because they either Hate '76 or Hate anything negative being said about '76.
---
Great theory, and it's possible that has made it worse, but for me I started seeing posts (and personally had it happen) around Patch 5 or 6, and doesn't seem to have "cleared up"...
---
What about changing PipBoy light color by editing the .ini file? Can it get you banned as well? No mods BTW.
---
We have to bring focus to things, otherwise they will never get fixed...
---
adamantium skeleton
---
I am expecting the base backpack in the game and a million atom store variants in the shop
---
I love the 10th, 15th and 20th backpacks, hopefully they’ll be in the game.
---
I thought it was only for events. Is it for the whole game?
---
Oh shit I’m about to get in right now ! Thanks for sharing !
---
Encounter a lvl 78 bear as well, the cows didn't stand a chance. (at least we made it to the farm to spawn the Beast.)
---
if you are still in need of the mascot head i have one, it is yours.
---
Niceeeeee
---
Or any faction for that matter
---
subscription is a possibility, but will drive people away.
---
Pay for new dlc as they are  released like the destiny model.
---
These are just some unpopular ideas.
---
excellent trade off imo as this would free up some perk cards like Slow Metabolizer, Good with Salt and even good doggy
---
entire game. Kill a lvl 68 Super Mutant on the PvP servers and XP is like 389.
---
Yeah! ...the trees kept pushing out toxic gas, and the veil was the only thing that could cover me.
---
Ok I’ll check and upload a pic in a few minutes.
---
Weird, watching the video it almost looked like there were (2) of the Magazines on the ground...  
---
Rarely I've seen multiple items "Stacked" inside themselves, usually on Older (12 hour +) instances where one or more full respawns occurred and that cell had never been visited.  
---
Regardless thanks for the tag, I'll see if I can replicate.
---
 Oh dear your downvoting is being difficult. Condolences. ;)
---
 I very seldom do that as I'd rather express my dissatisfaction personally. Sometimes a real clusterfuck needs some though, just for balance.
---
You are not going to play an online game with free updates without some sort of monetization.
---
The Atom Store provides the least intrusive method of getting funds that are needed to maintain and upgrade the game over time while leaving the choice of when to spend their money.
---
The only alternatives is buying DLCs out right 20-30 / per quarter roughly or having a subscription.
---
I'll take the ability to play for free after the initial outlay and then contribute as something cool enters the store.
---
Leave the choice in my hands.
---
Great info and pics! Wonder what we’re supposed to do with all those body parts?
---
With regards to the SBQ, there’s no farming advantage to be gained by repairing your weapon on the fly. You get the same XP, and the ability to loot, whether you put 5k rounds into her, or 1 round. Being able to continuously put rounds into her is a benefit to everyone around you, because she comes down that much faster. 
---
With long PVP fights, yes having a repaired weapon is good, but at what point in the middle of the fight are you going to get to stop for 5 or 10 seconds to use the kit? If you’re actively fighting, as soon as you stop attacking you’re dead. The ‘advantage’ is completely negated. Also, survival is still in beta, so repair kits may be able to be used in the future, if BGS sees they are an extreme advantage. 
---
And I’m not buying the ‘slippery slope’ argument that is going around this sub. You can’t point to one object and call it a slope. If you saw one brick laying in a field somewhere, you wouldn’t point to it and say ‘that’s going to be a pyramid’.
---
Can confirm as true as I just killed a legendary noxious sheepsquatch.
---
Niiice!! That sucker probably stays still after death so its possible to loot it as well! (unless there are exploding robots there too ??!)
---
That would give him a wanted level, not contest my claim. The only way youre supposed to be able to take over a ws is by contention. There is no other way, without it being a bug or glitch.
---
To the PvPers their mouth water with more stuffed pinatas...
---
i\`m not the poster but replies like yours always make me smile so thanks
---
What? Seriously?
---
I'm pretty sure all the sheepsquatch stuff is used, or should be used, in making the sheepsquatch weapons that were datamined, which I assume are rewards from the Free Range event which also came out today.
---
Ah ok, thanks
---
My buddy on xbox got a level 50 furious speedy combat knife and he's never played melee so he thinks it's not even good.
---
Same with west side of map maybe we will get dlc
---
You basically got arguably the best possible roll!
---
A weekly, "your camp can't be placed" award to.
---
Ok I'm trying this tonight!
---
Personally I would love the subscription model if it meant the items in the atomic shop were in the actual game instead
---
yea check the pictures, there are some quills, skull and horn. They are junk though
---
It drops ballistic fiber!?  Yes!!! *fistpump*
---
Did you kill it??
---
All very mysterious stuff! :P
---
Large Sheepsquatch Horn (gives 2 bones), Mysterious Fur (gives Cloth and Ballistic Fiber), Mysterious Quills as we've found over at Toxic Larry's, Sheepsquatch Skull (gives 5 bones, but ..deposited it all just in case we'll be able to use this down the line). Plus some Sheepsquatch Meat.
---
When it came to loot, it was a one-star and dropped accordingly :P So nothing too crazy there, but hopefully we'll find some 3-star ones and all the spawn-points so we'll be able to farm them like crazy :P
---
Yes. Seriously.
---
While that's really *nice*, I don't know how to feel about backpacks working with PA.
---
Maybe it would only trigger when you leave vats?
---
We just found one at Beckley Farm! :)
---
I also need to be clear. I dont play the pvp side of the game. Adventure only for me. So just running in and killing me wouldnt work either. Because yes, at least in adventure (whatever the first server option is) you MUST contend it to build.
---
You can edit the position of the camp module within your camp which changes the spawn point, but takes a lot of trial n error to get it spot on where you want it.
---
I really wish you could though. Would be nice to craft a max durability item and then "enchant" it.
---
Well here’s the thing. They aren’t necessarily p2w, because you aren’t just suddenly a god amongst men when you have them. I get it isn’t right though, especially when Bethesda specifically said that all items in the atom shop are cosmetic only. If they want people to pay money on atoms, then make some cosmetics items that are actually good god damn it!
---
Yes. It was aggressive.
---
What is this battlefront 2 now? I wouldn’t mind a stimpak or Salisbury steak thrown at me for logging on
---
You were right until your final paragraph, where you screwed your self. Repair Kits are not P2W (y’all can scream as much as you want, but they offer no competitive advantage) and the fridge/ stashing junk isn’t confirmed atom shop, also not P2W.
---
Personally wouldn’t mind if they kept the atom shop aspects to aesthetics only..
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Ditto.  Though I do use upvotes for threads I believe deserve more attention.
---
Hopefully you rook pictures!
---
this happend to me yesterday with launch codes. A server hop corrected it though.
---
Wow, so i can use those horn and quills later on?
---
Thank you for the reminder. Guess I'll finally hit lvl 400.
---
4,6,7,19
---
Sold!
---
actually there are also gas masks if you're not in power armor
---
me as well, I was just pointing out something better to do with the cloth other than bulk it
---
Yeah. I just saw the other posts. Damn. Those bastards delivered!
---
No people don’t vendor 1star wood sentinel pieces. Sentinel is a 3rd star category, you’ll only find it on 3star items.
---
What I wanna know is why the hell no one is dumping their junk in their stash before doing events like Encryptid, or any other instance where death is likely? Am I missing something?
---
It should amplify 'Junkies' weapon legendaries
---
They do.  They say by advancing in levels in the scouts by getting badges then you get your first backpack.  
---
However, I agree that they don’t go into detail on how you get mods.   Presumably you’ll be able to learn them by scrapping, getting plans, etc.  But they don’t say how.
---
I just came across a real sheepsquatch! Level 96. I was roaming around the mountains east Dent &amp; Sons Construction when the ground started shaking (similar to a deathclaw is nearby and starts roaring). I followed the sound of gunshots and found a level 24 player (forgot the persons username) shooting up this massive sheepsquatch and joined in the fight. The sheepsquatch was a legendary enemy so took some time to take down, and occasionally he shot out those mysterious quills which briefly gives the same effects as carrying too much weight. To both our surpriywe eventually defeated him and got a ton of loot. 
---
I have some nice pictures I took of the carcass. The sheepsquatch seemed hanging out at a nest on the edge of a cliff with two dead brahmin carcasses around what looks like a deathclaw nest. 
---
Sheepsquatch is real folks!
---
Sweet ☺
---
Even the new event is live: it start when you go to Big Fred Place (West from Alpha site), and he is the last boss.
---
I need that Nuka-Cola one...please Bethesda please! Those skins are amazing. Definitely worth putting in the Atom Shop. I think no one would give you any flack for putting skins there.
---
Yep!  I think all of the AllRises are 2*
---
I have been waiting on these skins and I got max lvl sets for each skin to collect with mods and everything. I could have just decked out one suit of X01, saved the stash weight, and repainted for minimal material cost. But i'm already invested so F#$@ it lol
---
I'm digging the baby sloth myself.
---
I personally don't agree with backpacks working in power armor. There's no incentive or support for players who don't like power armor such as myself. Why should a person even be able to just walk around with 700 carry weight by combining PA and perks.
---
Yes. Picture counts toward the weekly challenge :)
---
Thank you!  Perhaps I will try to look you up
---
There's 2 spawns per server, Ansel and Anne.

Contesting workshops in Adventure mode is right in line with the games design and is any players right to do so.  I think almost everyone should know and understand this by now no matter what their level.  If you claim a workshop, you have painted a target on your back.  Completely understood and acceptable and I don't criticize anyone who farms caps or resources in Adventure this way.  Earning caps like this is can be profitable and I'm not overly sympathetic to players who whine because they can't defend their claims.  Understand what's at stacke and accept it or get better!  However, you being a great PVP player isn't what OP's experience was about and he wasn't complaining about a contested workshop not going his way.  It can be argued that going to someone's camp and smashing it down to get a bounty to initiate PVP  or even for no reason at all is also right in line with the game mechanics as they exist at the time.  The problem with it is that more and more players see this as sociopathic behavior and don't care if Bethesda encourages it.  It is also seen as malicious bullying by some because 75% of the time these asshats only target players who are under lvl.50 and much lower level than themselves. They can see whose camp it is by looking at their turrets if they have them, or just watching the map for stationary dots off by themselves.  Most lower levels are intimidated by players of much higher level than themselves and won't even try to fight back.  These types of players know this and exploit it.  If low level Joe does fight back, then their odds of picking up some caps are pretty good and so much the better.  Some may see this as a lazy way to get caps.. I'm sure it isn't profitable all the time, because there are a lot of players and groups who actively hunt players with bounties in Adventure and are set up for it. I personally think most of them don't care about the bounty and have a buddy standing by to take it off of them.  These are the true "griefers". They like to smash other players camps just because they can and don't care if they have ruined someone else's hard work.  I have always accepted this as being part of the game, and dealt with it in many different ways, but even I see this type person as having a sociopathic nature.  Saying they aren't really "griefing" just because the game lets them do it and then defending their behavior with the statement of "I'm just playing the Raider Role" is moronic and most of us aren't buying it, we know what it is. Either way, smashing other peoples camps for fun or profit is trolling and is completely different from contesting a workshop.

If i'm correct the sheepsquatch stuff might be used in making the sheepsquatch weapons that were datamined alongside this event a while back. I think the plans might be gotten from the Free Range even that came out today, but they might also drop from it? Won't know till some one get's a plan, I did get the plans to make the shepard's crook and mutton meat pie (Something along those lines) from the event.
---
Same for me for over a week now
---
I know-- but at that moment I only had the veil available :P
---
Didn't want to teleport away and lose a chance to smack the Sheepsquach.
---
It would make sense, but it would also lower the player base. Basically most people want something for nothing.
---
You're handy.
---
Ug I mean we want to seeseee iitttt!!!
---
I used to teleport to my second floor when I placed the mat while it was still craftable. Scorched beasts destroyed my base now it's gone and I arrive in radioactive water
---
Sounds interesting. Can you provide more details on each rank structure and the daily/weekly missions? What are the implications of ranking up with FP?
---
no rare junk components like the other cryptids?
---
If u add paint from the atom shop u can't accidentally drop or sell it
---
I think so, I'm going to do server hops and see if I can find that event again and see if the drop changes, but there was a bunch of sheepsquatch weapons datamined that I assume use the sheepsquatch stuff. I'll post back if I end up finding out something, unless some one else finds out first :P.
---
About 200 pounds if my stash are 2* and 3* star legendaries atm. If the legendary vender works as I think it will, I can probably get a decent return.
---
wut
---
Me too!
---
I agree, I'd be much happier paying quarterly DLCs. I'd rather do that than constantly altering the game mechanics to force purchases.
---
It is a new event doing it now will try to send pic after
---
Do ya remember what rewards you got from completing the event?
---
Well just read about the backpacks. Fridge goes in the backpack. I’m REALLY hoping there’s a camp version too 😒
---
Good idea never thought of that!
---
Honestly, it's preferred, for me. I am routinely baffled by 65+ characters running in it full-time.
---
I keep an Excavator I renamed FlatBed for when I get OE and want to fast-travel.
---
I just wish there was a viable way to use a HazMat over armor so I was not so vulnerable in nuke zones.
---
Thanks for actual input here.
---
I agree.
---
Both of my characters have a full inventory of legendaries lol
---
Well, I hope when the day comes you'll change your mind and stream it on YouTube or Twitch. It's so far away to get everyone and everything ready. The stage / ring setup is a complicated, yet simple build. We're going to have entrance music, some lights, some fireworks type displays, and more.   
---
It's a lot to set up and get coordinated. Plus trying to get everyone on the server at the same time.
---
This comment made me laugh lol
---
Lol. Sorry man I don't have imgur so I don't have a link to upload. Head over to Big Fred's BBQ shack and do the event. It's awesome!
---
I would go to r/market76 and see what the market value of items are, bloodied, anti armor are what people want in guns, explosive or vats they pay high, sentinel and cavalier is the armor everyone drools over
---
I'd love to work with someone on Xbox and show them how the arena is being built and give them all of our ideas and watch their livestream of their own event!
---
Important question.
---
Some of these 2* gatlings are getting hard to hang on to, that's for damn sure.
---
Well an example of the ranks would be lancer to lancer-knight to lancer-sergeant to lancer-captain and so on. Out missions range from killing a Scorchbeast which is worth 50fp to doing missions like line in the sand. We also write up campaigns that vary by week that usaly requires clearing out different areas and other objectives.  I hope this answers your questions
---
me too!
---
Yes. “Loot all, bury all” was a common command.
---
Yeah, luckily after a few disconnects I'm usually able to find a server that stays stable at least FOR A WHILE
---
Helps that all I've really been doing lately is server hopping to farm plans anyway, lol
---
Done
---
If I don’t fail I will post it
---
Heck yeah! I'm into that! I'd love to watch someone take my idea, my stage setup, my instructions and put their own twist on it and then I could watch the livestream over YouTube or Twitch! I'd be jacked lol
---
fisticuffs
---
"Huh, I had bone worms?"
---
Yes, apexigod#7680
---
But the thing is right now you can play for free and decide if you want to pay additional money for cosmetic things. That's cool. But, just wait until it's quality of life and no longer cosmetic.
---
What I'm saying is I want to spend money on keeping the game going. But I'm not paying 5 bucks for a Mascot head. Help me to help you. We would buy more stuff if it was affordable.
---
GIVE ME THE BABY MOTHMAN BACKPACK RIGHT NOW!!!!!
---
That should be controlled by limiting CAMP placement locations though, not preventing me from choosing where in my camp I fast travel to
---
Completely depends of the item, if the item is legendary and has very good effects, two shot, blodied, explosive it can easily go up to 5k 
---
Hell some items are no longer in the loot pool and those easy go over 25k
---
More like 11 hours from *now*- I’ve got class after work today. But I’ll be on for a wider time range on Friday
---
Legendary Broadsider, food, fur, horns, mutton pie, Sheepsquatch meat
---
I wonder if it is a random spawn or an event ..
---
Same was happening to me, so I went in through the back door. Problem solved lol😎👍
---
You must not be very good at estimating distances IRL then, because yeah, I can and do ;)
---
Buff diseases and add an 'Inoculator' to the Atom Shop.
---
/s
---
Eso does it right
---
As a tattoo artist this shit is beyond annoying. Any and everyone knows it's all about placement. At least we can preview them now. Before it was always a fun adventure finding out where they would go.
---
We've been testing and playing with the fight mechanics. Believe it or not, even with 15 strength, mutations suppressed, and everything jacked....unarmed really doesn't do that much. Might add a stipulation about using VATS criticals, but that seems counter-intuitive because if someone has a critical and they deliver a knockout blow, that's in the spirit of boxing so I honestly don't see a problem with it.  
---
A lot of technical details to work out though. Make it as fair as we can.
---
Yea it's a very curious """mechanic""". Maybe it's a way to inspire trade, risk-reward, instill mystery?  
---
It's very much all of the above when you're new, until you figure out that any of the unlabeled mods that are clearly for PA, pertain to the Excavator (tip: they'll scrap into Black Titanium).
---
It's the same for the Scout mods. "Scout Armor Fiberglass", oh great, my Scout chest piece needs that. *"Just Kidding! It's for Limbs \*snicker\*"* \-.-
---
**Quality of Life changes that need to happen:** Legendary items need to display all of their effects under the name when you pick it up, when you view it in a trade window (bot/player) or viewing it when Transferring into a container (corpse, object, Stash). We should not need to Inspect the item, and similarly this would "solve" the problem where Inspect has been broken since Patch 7 (at least it works again in vendor trades).
---
**^(\[RAMBLE\])**  
---
Yes, I know it means additional coding work and Bethesda only has 6 staff members working on 76 now that it launched; a modeler, a texture artist, a mapper, a quest/event/script creator, and two coders - one to make a change and the other who ignores comments in the code when making their own change. *^((I'm obviously joking, but it genuinely seems to be the situation given how slow the roll out of new content is or even)* ***^(fixes)*** *^(for reproducible bugs introduced by)* ***^(&lt;)****^(insert latest patch number)****^(&gt;)****^(...))*  
---
But just look at it this way: It already takes time to undo these new screw ups, time better spent on making new content/improvements elsewhere, so at least this would eliminate 97% of the need to Inspect an item in the first place; thus, preventing the "problem" the lack of Inspect has caused. *(Remaining 2.5%: look at loot's equipped mods, 0.5% to zoom/rotate the item to appreciate what it is.)*
---
Hard-code those legendary effects to display under the item name and you prevent an issue that should've been a simple rollback to like 3 lines of code which has now persisted for going on 2 months. 
---
Unless GameBryo/CreationEngine is ***so-***far screwed up *(and poorly coded from decades of modification to the base-GameBryo engine)* that these lines of code are distributed across multiple areas? I'm not a coder but having looked at plenty on GitHub for games I have a general idea, so ideally a global "IF" should cover *"it's a container"* (players, objects, bodies... are all technically containers as far as the game is concerned), and "THEN" would *"allow user to Inspect"*. That way any changes to item lists for containers wouldn't in turn screw up this.    
---
**^(\[/RAMBLE\])**  
---
\[I'm ok with this entire post being down-voted for my "arm-chair internet coding advice" response, but I just felt it had to be said even if no one at Bethesda will actually see what I've said here. \]
---
What I mean is the only useful effect being the sentinel. No one cares about "boost at night" or half the other effects possible. You absolutely can find them at vendors.
---
god i hope that one made the cut
---
I NEED it for my mothman cultist outfit
---
can confirm those junk cannot auto scrap, so u r right!
---
**If** the backpack mods are in the atom shop then it would be p2w simply because one of them is increased damage resist.
---
So people are rolling around with mods and all these kids are crying about repair kits ? Lol
---
Making a mule character is more reliable than asking someone to hold onto your stuff, especially if that person is online at different times. You only need to join a friend, store whatever you want to transfer to your mule character in a container, switch to your mule character, join your friend again, and grab the stuff from the container you used to transfer your stuff. Just make sure your friend doesn't leave the world you stored your stuff in or you might lose it.
---
Legendary Broadsider, fur, horns, sheepsquatch meat and pies.
---
They literally do offer an advantage in survival as you can repair without uncrouching, meaning you can repair while chameloned and not showing up on the map.
---
How do you activate free range?
---
Yes, it spawns at random encounter location.
---
Well.. you said it bro. You don't really have to buy anything so demands are quite low.
---
Well, depending on if we split the brackets into separate events or not (still being decided) then there might be room. If we attempt it ALL in one shot, 16 fighters + 4 staff = 20, so 5 people (best case scenario) might be able to see it live. Otherwise, Twitch or YouTube.
---
They should add 'atrophy' and 'bedsoresæ as penalties for being in PA too long
---
You're right :(
---
Much appreciated mate
---
It's a random event out in the Mire. I suggest doing it with a group of others. Defending the brahmin can be difficult solo.
---
I was nr 1 for about an hour today and was in my camp the whole time, probably 7 different people tried to kill me and  they all sneaked through the front door and looked for me, not a single wall was injured. Maybe players are different in different regions? I play on EU
---
Incoming message from Phantom of the AWPera
---
Both mine and my wife’s stashes are full to the point where we have to rework it almost every time we play. Which is fine, because it’s our fault for stacking up legendarys when we don’t even really know how it’ll work, but I do hope it’s not disappointing. It’d be such a good way to reward long time players. Right now I’m pretty much keeping legendarys on the biases that, in order 1. They’re light, 2. The amount of stars, and 3. The effects are good ones like TS. Hopefully that criteria works out for me but who knows.
---
I'm taking names for people who drop out or no show! What's your PSN? If a spot opens, you're in!
---
Generally things can be produced for less than they can be bought for.
---
When it comes to basic items such as aid items, ammo, plans, etc. I always charge less than the asking price. Otherwise people can just utilize npc vendors. Some more rare plans you could sell for over the base cost because you put in work to get them. But basic duplicate plans should be less
---
It's a random event out in the Mire.
---
It’s ever so frustrating when you have Vaccinated maxed as well
---
Card is full right now, but I can take down your PSN and contact you in case someone drops out or decides not to fight. Next fight depends on how successful this fight is, but if it's successful and everyone likes it, you're in for the next card!
---
Shoot, you're telling me bro.
---
Naw, the only way is clear your mutations and re roll them. You might get lucky though and lose Unstable Isotope on the first try.
---
I have something like a random persistent clicking. Even after fast traveling. It's driving me nuts.
---
They might have been after the bounty.  Destroying a  camp in Adventure is an easy way to get a free bounty, and then they either have a friend who they are teamed with kill them (to get the caps) or they just server hop into survival mode with a great big 'come get me' sign on them so that they don't have to go hunting for other players.
---
This is not going to stop until the camps are invulnerable.
---
I just logged to find my excavator chest with emergency protocols unequipped and missing. Not...fracking...cool
---
[https://imgur.com/VWaWGLH](https://imgur.com/VWaWGLH) Found mine in an X vs Y encounter, 1star level 80 noxious sheepsquatch vs Super mutants. Theyre fairly tanky but dont seem to do very much damage. also seems to turn fairly slowly so just keep circling it.
---
LOL that's funny :D
---
As much as possible. I will take anything, 50 to 5000.
---
Right, so I guess just stocking up and using items myself is the way to go
---
It’s in luck.  I’m not sure what level it unlocks at, I did t get it until I hit 50
---
I had 2 sheepsquatch at the end of the event, they killed all my brahmin
---
I find the inclusion of the word "first" in regards to backpack telling too, that means other backpacks are probably going to be a thing.
---
I'd already like to add I see what a lot of you are saying and I’m already changing my perspective. Right now they may be giving every kind of person a place. Some people want to play for free and some would like to pick and choose when to buy small purchases. Some want consolidated DLCS and some may want a subscription service. Personally I’d like to be able to purchase a pass or subscription to have access to all the stuff, at least an option to do that at discounted cost over individual purchases. I can’t spend $5 on a Devil Head Vault Girl, but I can spend $25 on a reasonable package once in a while.
---
I don't know how to set up my very own discord, but I would love to do it for Appalachia Fight League! Lend me a hand?
---
If it's not showing because the quest location is not yet revealed, I'm down with this change.
---
What's your PSN?
---
Modern problems require Morden solutions
---
Not a bad shout, I'll try that
---
Had the event fail but got weight less marine armor legs with perception
---
5mm is the bottom of the trashcan worthless
---
The stage / ring setup is going to be bananas lol we have some tricks up our sleeves!
---
Agree. Harder to get, much harder on the character when they do. Nerf cures to only work X% of the time. In some cases maybe cures can only suppress the symptoms 33%, 66% and half the duration with a Perk card.
---
Lol they had to explain that the terrors of the dark event is made for LOW LEVEL players so people dont whine this time.
---
I still guarantee people will whine
---
Yeah, the quest is no joke.
---
The video doesn't appear to be working
---
Man, I honest to goodness hope not.
---
So much this. It just seems healthier for the game overall
---
I didnt find it hard to be fair, just couldnt distract 2 at once
---
Heck yeah! I hope you'll be available on June 18th @ 5pm CST to tune into the big fight!
---
I know it says not all of the designs made it in... but... can you tell us about that last mothman? backpack, my wife says I have to get that 1 in particular so for my health, I hope that made it in
---
The only time I’ve ever used it is when my friend was high and we were trying to find the objective cuz they couldn’t find it lol
---
Idk that one that is basically a tire and hubcap is kinda weird. Imagine lugging around a friggin wheel on your back. Also, why a tire anyways?
---
Diseases being more diabolical would actually make the Endurance tree worth investing on for some. I only have 2 slots in it.
---
Just need to find one of the events again and see if it drops a sheepsquatch weapon plan :3.
---
I hope not :(
---
With concentrated fire on, I can usually cripple any fast enemy with two or three shots.
---
When I'm outside I like to stay in 3rd, inside and other tight areas I go 1st
---
That's cool, but the only reason I'm wearing the field scribe unit is because of that backpack.  I want my nuka cola themed rucksack (if that's even a thing) to show up!
---
Nah, that would just be stupid to target only one build type.
---
I have always play in first. Im better at FPS games then TPS games
---
That's what I mean. I can kill the enemies easily but the number of mobs and how they go straight for the brahmin makes it difficult.
---
1st person for combat, 3rd person for exploring, however I generally stick to 1st as I find myself in combat 80% of the time
---
Honestly, I can't even tell you right now. The honest only guaranteed spot for anyone is for me (because I'm building the ring and putting on the event lol) but throw me your PSN and I'll hook you up with a guy I got a betting pool idea building with.
---
You're right: presuming you can read is a pretty big assumption. 
---
You assuming that everyone that has a different experience with the game than you have is lying, is a **huge** assumption, though. People have even posted screenshots and videos of the things you're using as an example, so to call everyone a liar is sort of an amazing leap.  Bravo.
---
Sorry still uploading.. 
---
 This video is still being processed. Video quality may improve once processing is complete.
---
As soon as the ring / stage is finished being built, I'll post some pics and hit you up so you can see what we did!
---
I wish I was as cool as this epic gamer
---
I'm sure they are saving cooler ones for atom shop
---
We kind of already have the proof of concept with the distilling.
---
It shows you can have an item from the stash, also represented in another container that modifies it in some way. So rather than having a sped up distillation process, we can have a slowed spoil process.
---
ESO has a model that includes both that works really well. It encourages subscription but allows free play for those who can't or won't pay. I would like to see that here
---
Best I can do is a [vault tec van and a place inside one of out vaults](http://i.imgur.com/mXE6qZi.jpg)
---
A noble cause! &lt;3
---
Agree, basic items, aid, ammo, some plans should go for less than vendors, with the exception maybe being fully modded armor 
---
You shouldn't worry too much about trading just yet, since you can't get Max lvl loot yet, but do infact keep an eye out for good legendaries, you don't wanna sell that to a npc vendor.
---
This may or may not be the exact reason I was looking for it...
---
I just snort-laughed
---
Well said. This is just a test prize too. This entire event is a test run. We're going bananas on it but it's still just getting our beaks wet lol  
---
If it gets well received, is well liked, and people want us to repeat it...then perhaps some donations of much better prizes will be made :D
---
Third for exploring outside. First for exploring indoors. I’m melee so third for combat works best.
---
Is this different than r/Fo76Brotherhood?
---
Well I appreciate all you do. Your bug thread posts are informative and helpful without being the typical trash talk that goes on and I look for them every time you post. They're the most likely way to get Bethesda to actually fix the issues in their game and your efforts are appreciated.
---
I can see selling backpack skins in the shop (or just straight up different models, depending on how they implement things). Honestly it's not too much of a stretch to think they'd put the mods there as well, but I would *think* that they'd realize monetizing carry weight isn't just a QOL feature, and damage resistance is a big ol' NO in my book.
---
Refrigeration...that's kinda on the line for me.  It's QOL, but I can see the argument that it's an advantage in gameplay.  Not sure how I'd feel about monetizing that (though I seriously don't have issues with food even with speed demon).
---
GOD BLESS THE ENCLAVE

I hope the ones I like make it to the game!!!  They said not all in this image made it into the game :(
---
I have 2k weight across two characters saved.
---
My main will be overencumbered until the vendor releases, but honestly I'm not too concerned if the vendor isn't as perfect as everyone hopes.
---
Give me a few rerolls, and ill just be happy to have something to do with them.
---
yes i know they drop in the world thats not the point
---
If you say his name three times in the mirror he appears behind you. Video ready in waiting

1. All fighters pay 250 caps entry fee
---
2. Fighters on deck will have their own locker room with bed and stash box
---
3. Mandatory to stash all weapons, armors, aid items, and junk
---
4. Mandatory clean inventory check
---
5. Outfits provided by event staff / commissioner apexigod
---
6. Mandatory Rad-X mutation suppression
---
7. Boxing with only bare knuckle fists
---
They only say FIRST backpack. Nothing about getting others or how to get modified ones such as fridge ones. It is especially telling as well they just mentioned adding fridges to camps in the Atomic shop as well. So it isn't that crazy to be concerned.
---
Same question ^_^
---
Tell me more about the one you did.  I don't think I've done that one yet.
---
Same here solo level 198 couldn’t keep up with all the killing. But got it to spawn in and killed it but the event also failed :(
---
First for rifle, third for melee, space allowing. Gets a bit cramped indoors with PA &amp; 3rd person.
---
I soooooooooo wish i was more observant when i was scrapping my stuff! I  lost mine and can't find another
---
Yes I have tons of crappy light weight 3* stuff and some decent stuff saved to sell to players
---
Yes please let's just complete the transformation from a $60 dollar AAA title into a mobile game, we already have paid repair kits so why not daily login bonuses too.  FFS why would anyone want this?
---
good for you . vats range is still 50 do .
---
True.  It makes you wonder how differently things could have been if the 76 Beta was a true Beta with solid testing of both game stability and functionality over a few months time.  Now you are patching holes in the boat while its out in the lake already.
---
I do this a lot too. I always pray that the game doesn’t crash in transit lol
---
Sorry, what's BP rifle?
---
Thank you! But between the horde of ghouls and that sudden scorchbeast, I didn't fare too well after. Hah.
---
they tried putting an outfit from fallout 4 in the atom shop and didn't go down well with the fans i don't know if they would try that again after so much backlash from the fans
---
The biggest down side with the normal armor is the constant upkeep.  I dislike wearing PA, but now spend most of my playtime wearing it because I grew tired of the constant search for ballistic fiber.  One run in with a Scorch Beast could turn a 200% repaired body armor into broken body armor.
---
First person mostly, though I've been dressing my characters up lately so I've been playing in third.  And also because I started a heavy weapon character and the gatling gun's sights disappear in first person, but you still get the dog in third.
---
Seems like it would be better to join forces than have conflicting BoS factions.
---
yeah that would be cool
---
Juicehead, Juicehead, Juicehea.... oh wait did you say in the mirror... my bad. (So excited that I was the first one to find this.)
---
How do you do it?
---
50 Bethesda units. We don’t know what those translate to in IRL terms. 
---
Also I’m taking your word for it on “50 units” being the max vats range.
---
ARK implements this pretty well being able to paint your character and Dino’s  in an in game ui , although it’s very hard to use. It’s the only stock game I know that allows that kind of customization . Downside is the player models are not the best , and there aren’t any facial options .
---
Someone downvoted me yesterday because I was talking about a bug I had that they didn't, so they assumed I was lying to trash the game. \[rolls eyes\]
---
Modding stuff also helps significantly. Removing all the mods off everything, light weight or ultra light for armor (easily can drop the weight by half), and for some reason a lot (if not all) long barrels weight LESS than the short barrels. Putting a long barrel on a hunting rifle that originally had a short barrel drops the weight by 0.6 or so. Makes zero sense, but that's how it is...
---
I have Weightless armor pieces with light build mods that literally weigh 0.
---
I have you covered: 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Worn_veil
---
then after you get back into the batcave you can repair it with the Fabricator
---
Was it random or mission??
---
Working now.. sorry for the delay!
---
Would love if one of the mods for backpacks allows you to deploy a portable mini-camp without messing with your actual camp.  Keeping my fingers crossed for that one.
---
yeah a very bad idea, we could see p2w being brought in by the backdoor with these sorts of items
---
The also made it seperate for the nuka girl outfit tho which was also a copy of the FO4 asset.
---
I use 1st for any combat and 3rd when just messing around
---
No conflict we just have our own thing going
---
Super duper and chemist makes crafting aid items easier.
---
 LOL. I can make BoS Heavy Combat but you have nothing I want. I would actually sell most of that to Wallace. ;) What's BP? A bloodied thing?
---
You can rename up to 50 items, so if you're not collecting a giant amount of stuff, it helps a bit. You can also rename items with the same name as another item. You could call everything "Vendor food" if you want to.
---
Sure. But you specifically said 1star wooden pieces. Both of those statements are impossible- wood can’t have sentinel because it can’t have 3 stars, and sentinel can’t be on 1 star items.

Trespassers Will Be Violated.
---
Lol that was all very interesting.
---
i hope you are right!  trust and Bethesda dont really go hand in hand anymore unfortunately
---
i think they made it harder because people said the harpers ferry dungeon was too easy
---
Random, was one at the supposed spawn sites for the Megasloth and he popped up and quite frankly scared the shit out me.. I love this game!
---
But that only applies to what you carry on you.  When it is in your stash, pack rat doesn't apply.
---
I wonder if that Vim design is actually in. Would be neat to see ones for it and Sunset Sasparilla.
---
bullshit
---
Spawns at the end of a event (Did the new Free Range event and fought it at the end) but also spawns as random encounter from what I've seen on here. Has it's own abilities and animations too.
---
I found a behemoth crouched in a  small lake in the savage divide.  Would love to see more stuff like that tbh.
---
..which part?
---
FPS all the way. I'll look at my char with TP, but that's it.
---
 I actually don't get TP myself. Why is it attractive?
---
Good reporting, Hunter! Where does the event start?
---
I wish the backpacks would allow a mini camp in locations.  It would be cool if you camp out and it gives you a cooking station and a mini station to scrap and rework weapons. Then when your ready to move you can pickup the camp and move on. Sometimes I want to temporarily set up in a spot on the map and the thought of moving my house is a pain
---
Logging in before work then logging off after it counted tajes a few minutes.
---
this has been asked for months but it seems its to tough for them to add in
---
As someone that’s spent about $50 on atoms and purchased a lot of stuff, my biggest complaint is that there’s not enough budget in my camp to place all the things I paid real money for. I got the new neon keep out signs among other things and can’t even place them. I have my camp/store looking exactly like I want but have to delete things just to place purchased things down. The budget needs to be bigger if they keep pushing this stuff out so quickly.
---
2 of my friends have had this happen. One was a tse shotgun yesterday (his main gun and what he invested his build to utilize☹) and another friend had pieces of his t51b disappear. Luckily I haven't had this happen to me yet but it's definitely an issue
---
just surprised to be honest that you replied. was just a joke about how you’re always getting the news for us. keep up the good work man
---
I don't care would love to put the grim reaper powerarmor skin on every PA I own.
---
Where does the Free Range event start, and can it be triggered?
---
Fair enough; from my point of view that’s a 7-8 perk point investment that I don’t have to make... and you still take armor damage (plus rad sponge only works in groups!).
---
But that’s the beauty of the game- there’s a ton of different play styles to suit everyone’s personality.
---
ohh... not good, i am out with one of my low lv characters, lol
---
Yeah wouldn’t be surprised. I don’t mind it at all. Just makes it more of a team effort now to do the event. But I will keep try regardless. Got to see if I can solo it and complete it!
---
It's real, I literally did it myself before looking for this reddit, else would have posted my own pics myself.
---
Though I don't know what happens if the cows survive.
---
I feel like having my phone next to me whenever I visit the vendors is a must with this game. Kinda sucks :(
---
Ah, guess I’ll have to pick up the regular scribe outfit (without the backpack), then, so I can have my custom backpack show. Thanks for the info!
---
Yea thanks, worked ... =)
---
Damn! Really is a bullet sponge isnt he? Couldn't make anything from his fur or anything could you??
---
ESO and Guild Wars 2 both have this. It doesn’t make it anything like a mobile game, it simply incentivises people to log in each day. How is that a bad thing?
---
Literally never seen any in over 500 hours
---
Don’t know yet, haven’t tried, logged off straight away to post this :)
---
Big Fred’s BBQ shack for me idk if there are different locations
---
Exactly why my thread we were talking is important. Recently I was able to walk around with bulk scrap without it disassembling. Now that the glitch has returned, I have to keep bulk in my stash, which has no benefit to weight.
---
Is this real? Lol
---
One of them is called Free Range, which I think isn't the only one, but it spawns near Southern Belle Motel in the mire. If it's like all the other events, I assume you can server hop till it pops up and go to it, hopefully other's join also, it's a bit of a group event you could say.
---
I've been keeping them in the hopes that I'll be able to dump them in my player vending machine.
---
I've already been holding on to them for too long just to drop them somewhere...
---
I had to get extremely close to one for the photo to count for the challenge.
---
Was it a hard fight
---
I'm pretty sure the harder to detct is chameleon. It's the same description as chameleon armors.
---
Has anyone gotten extra plans for "the fixer" yet?  I'd love to be able to build one.  I can offer a trade - I recently found a set of "small letters" plans and I already know it.  I play on PC - username jaffo.
---
Literally any other countrymen detected on American soil
---
Yep, see my post for video
---
thanks man, happy you enjoy
---
Very easy
---
But then how would those "types" be organized?? The current filters are filters than all types have in common so it can remain one cohesive list.
---
👍
---
I was just scammed becasue of that
---
DO NOT TRADE WITH CAPTAIN_PROZ
---
Show where Bethesda employee asked us to report bug on this subreddit? You can't, cause they never have.
---
Go to one of the workshops where you can ‘repair’ a vertibird (power plant or munitions factory) and do it there.. worked for me
---
Want to play in 3rd but aiming is just horrible so I'm forced to play in 1st person
---
Well, still a slight problem ... now the terminals don't react to me
---
1st, I find that the character takes up most of the screen in 3rd esp if they are in PA
---
It doesn't call itself chameleon, because the nae is tied to the first bonus. 
---
I think is is though. Feel free to google that description.
---
I went to Poseidon and built one thing is it has to say veribot in the corner of the camera for it to register. So it's a matter of getting in frame just right.
---
Black Powder
---
Yes, see my post for image and video
---
AS much as I like/want to "see" my character/outfit, 
---
I spend 99% of my time in first person.
---
There’s a couple notes that are actually effectively keys. I think the ecological balance daily is one (although that one also gets consumed every time you do the quest, so you have to go get it every time- so stupid) and the terminal in camp... venture? To unlock the door is another.
---
Never had players hurt my camp behind WS. Sometimes monsters would though which is why i now have it off the ground.
---
I'm down to nuke peoples CAMPs just so they have to live in radiation. To optimize the pain, I'll launch it at people who have an investment in the server like workshop owners.
---
Yes it is also on Xbox don’t have Imgur so no pic I was over by Big Fred’s BBQ shack when it spawned in.
---
My Executioner's Gamma Gun would like to speak with you
---
I pretty sure the vendor reset is the only daily login reward we will get lol
---
It is real. Free Range is also active as a random event in the Mire.
---
You think too highly of yourself, don't you? I believe I am far more intelligent than you. So please, don't even attempt to insult me.
---
Mine wasn’t :( bullet sponge
---
I did the exact same thing, but then the game started respawning me inside the nuke zone, so I switched to a Hazmat suit.
---
It's not only in the mire. I had the event near top the world and I hear it is in Cranberry Bog as well.
---
Not at all. It seemed to have a lot of damage resistance and regenerated like all legendaries but it did very little (if any) damage to me.
---
Harder than usual mobs. It has many attacks and i guess one of them slows you down a bit.
---
It can be cripple tho,like a deathclaw.
---
I'm still finding new locations. Very impressive if you really found them all.
---
That’s awesome news! About time it was in game lol
---
The Event is called Free Range. Spawned two legendary Sheepsquatch, a glowing Yao Gaui and lots of small insects.
---
It's where you go during the Free Range event in the mire :).
---
Excellent - names peradokid
---
Well the armor still doesn’t count while in PA, and at the moment PA are without legendaries so it’s a good trade off.
---
Yeah that different from where I found it (up north)
---
BetHeSdA bAD
---
You get a reward and the event concludes- after you kill the Sheepsquach, that is.
---
I just finished the event.
---
Think it could beat a deathclaw?
---
New map icon?
---
The Super Duper perk does apply to the challenges though.
---
And I'm gone all weekend.  Boo.
---
yeah this is getting to be a team one, trying to keep the brahmin alive while fighting the sheepsquatch is going to be next to impossible for one person
---
So you'be bought the game twice essentially. If everyone was like us we wouldn't have repair kits for example.
---
I agree, that's very frustrating. But I'd imagine it's because of our shitty servers and an old game engine.
---
1st person 99% of the time, I go 3rd to get a look at my character sometimes and cinematic shots
---
Ok will do
---
Let me guess, random legendary?
---
There was a part of me, hoping for a backpack, but looks like that's next week.
---
Oh cool, ill have to go there at some point, still no map marker for the new vault up north though
---
Your last point doesn’t really matter I don’t think. Most games I know of people don’t sell stuff to the vendor unless it’s getting rid of literal crap. Anything worth some money should be sold to players.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
I think it's kind of a rough spot for the spawn.  I found a paper bag by Ansel's corpse when I got here and nobody came to claim it after about 10 minutes
---
Explosive beats 2shot significantly if you have the explosive perk cards. 2shot is 25% more damage, worse recoil and accuracy and like double the durability loss. Explosive with perks is 32% bonus damage, in AoE, and may or may not affect durability loss (I’ve heard mixed reports about this).
---
Action hero will still win on DPS (if you can keep all your bullets on target anyway) because it also has that 25% fire rate bonus (and on long fights that 15% reload actually matters too) but it’s going to chew through ammo and break much faster.
---
What system are you on?
---
There's a new event you can do involving the Sheepsquatch that triggers at Big Fred's BBQ Shack.
---
https://i.imgur.com/89zV84J.jpg
---
Btw is there a way to switch off depth of field on the new camera?
---
shut up nerd
---
That’s what I think too. We hate moving my house around the map for just scrapping and cooking. I raid areas and hauling around everything is slow and painful
---
Nice!
---
OK. I'm totally going to die over and over lol.
---
Nice video!
---
Side of a mountain for me.
---
I just did it again and failed too. Got attacked by 2 sheepsquatches and a whack of other enemies. Died twice! Was loads of fun though.
---
Cool
---
Thank you, Hunter! I eagerly await the moment me and the beast lock eyes.
---
Yes it is a lost art...you may wish to start with reading my own post there. I suggested that customization options may be heavily in the atom shop (though I hope not) not that you would have to buy your 'first' backpack.
---
I am looking forward to that first backpack...it's all the options I'm worried about, I really hope it's all available through the game play though I expect a lot of customization like skins will be atom shop.
---
Will check now, Hunter!
---
Guess so.
---
No Spoilers=No Internet LOL
---
the lake has an icon for it on the map but there is nothing there at the minute, it's likely the spot for some future dlc
---
If it doesn't have any turrents then it doesn't bother me, but some ppl might still hit your camp
---
Thanks never switch to the Nvidia thing and back so quickly!!
---
Since November? Really? I've been religiously on this subreddit since release, and I've only heard about it in the past week or so.
---
To me this kinda smells of the whole "players could steal items from your inventory while trading" or the "a player stole all of my power armor parts when I placed it downed (specifically didn't "drop" it according to them)" rumor that no one could every prove was real.
---
If it is real, it's pretty bullshit and unfortunate with random items disappearing, and due to the nature of it, it's pretty much impossible to prove unless you're recording yourself 24/7 while playing, but editing isn't exactly difficult either.
---
Man you scared me, I thought I left that out
---
So, absolutely no advantages except SPECIAL and perks, right?
---
Portable fridge is definitely an advantage IMO. Being able to stockpile tons of buffs is definitely a game changer for me, and I'll be a lot more keen to hunt down various types of food and keep the buffs active if they don't spoil. And assuming it stacks with "good with salts" you can probably keep them good indefinitely.
---
Lmao
---
Cool! Not sure, not that I’ve seen..
---
The retail store analogy doesn't work well here, primarily because there is an alternate way to get the item buy grinding atoms.  If your store allowed customers to "work" for a while to take the item home for free, you'd of ended up with less sales. 
---
The only people who are advantaged by not having limited items are the people who wanted to grind out atoms to buy things. 
---
People who are willing to spend money on the atom shop are going to do it to get the item in either case.  In fact, without the time limit, they may be less likely to make the purchase, as you get rid of the impulse buys and the fear of missing out.  
---
If there are no limited items, people will just grind, even if it takes forever, to get what they want.
---
Yeah you’re probably right about that. I just hope they eventually increase camp budget, even just another 25% would be fine. 
---
Funny story, o actually have bought the game more than that. I recently purchased three tricentennial editions for my friends. We were getting together for a game day and I surprised them with a copy each so they had to try it. They were hesitant initially based on the reviews but ended up liking it. Those three copies were only $45 total whereas I spent more than that when I bought the game at launch. And just playing it with them totally justified that cost for me. So I’ve essentially bought the game 5 times LoL
---
Buy it at whitesprings. I was also confused, but the game didnt tell you about this.
---
Fellow Cryptid Hunter, how did you feel upon discovering the beast?
---
This. My prized possession on my bloody vats sniper are her 3star Unyielding Acrobat legs. Running around &lt;20% health all the time, a short fall could kill me. Now I can jump off the bridge over Flatwoods and just do a superhero landing.
---
Actually I'm thinking that there will be lots of backpack options that will turn up in the atom shop. I'm surprised you don't see the same thing looking at all the artwork...I suspect we'll get a single basic option then have to unlock either through quests for basic ones or through atoms for anything interesting.
---
I did not know it would be that in depth. I’ll def watch. It’s just so far away that I’ll forget.
---
Truth.
---
Everything will cycle in again.  Don't fall for the limited time gimmick, all that shit will be back.
---
Go to a workbench and see what they scrap to..
---
I would venture similar to SB or wendigo - 
---
wendigo teeth scrap for acid.
---
SB brains are edible food, bones and wings scrap to ultracite (as does the hardened mass from the bloated ones)
---
I have never used anything other than leather armour in 66 levels. I'm a stealth build though, so I can't really comment on the pros and cons of getting into big fistfights with it :)
---
Where?
---
Server hop
---
You looking for someone else to play with on Xbox?
---
haaa, not really into pvp
---
Yeah, random legendary.
---
Oh, and I also got the plan for the Sheperd's Stick.
---
I didn’t have to buy a keycard for my first run
---
How do we get the camera and the quest?
---
I’d like to grab an Adrenal Reaction, and a Carnivore serum from you if you don’t mind. 
---
However I’m at work so is there any chance you’ll be around about 7 hours from now? I’m on PST here. 
---
IGN: fnichol
---
There's a free one in the taxidermy shop basement. Check the bottom shelving to the right of tinkers bench.
---
It's just a basic assualtron card after the first time.
---
I think my stash is 85% legendaries at this point... my poor tiny junk pile barely sustains me...
---
It was in the title and I got too excited about the rest and totally failed to see it haha my bad but this is so cool!
---
Yea, did a full relogg, work benches weren't reacting either 
---
Thanks =)
---
No, put many free versions in the game 1st, and then a month later start putting skins in the shop.
---
Holy sheet that looks scary :D
---
I was totally unaware it was in the game at this point, so imagine my thoughts as I hear a beasts cry that i've never heard before followed by the sounds of scorched fighting something, running over and seeing a giant beast, my jaw actually dropped and I grabbed my ProSnap Camera and took the pictures, and then a quick print screen before taking the beasty down! quite tough, even for me being over Lv.200!
---
What part of the map?
---
Like a good neighbor, u/MattTheFlash is there
---
Yeah I’ve had people team request me, I accept, they travel to my camp, leave the team, then screw up my camp.
---
NUKA COLA BACKPACK!!!!!!
---
PLEASE.
---
I have no problems with utility items being in the shop. They are a good drain for Atoms ground out during game play. Basically look at the ESO crown store for things you may find.
---
They mentioned ammo converter, I'd pick one up, because I am carrying a lot of 44 because I wasn't paying attention to when I was crafting and chose it instead of 45. As long as it was a lossy conversion it'd be fine. There is a munitions factory in game to take.
---
I'd pay big $ for a mount like a motorcycle. Or a pet.
---
While I also won't pay $5 for a mascot head, I will pick up that power armor skin on the last day it's available (allows me some more time to grind dailies).
---
I would agree that the prices in general need to come down. Cheaper prices would lead to more foot traffic to the shop.
---
I highly doubt the game is hurting for money, a lot of players play it, but it might become an issue in the future as people hit their limit of MTX. Hence the price should come down.
---
Could be today we see the Zetans.  The real Sheepsquatch's are in game today.
---
There has been some datamined info regarding Legendary PA after this last update.
---
Whoa, that event is live?  When did that happen?
---
"Save scumming" 
---
Yea, I sure enjoy missing the one chance in the game I might have in recruiting a companion because I said one line wrong... god forbid people play the way they want to, even if it means taking more effort to get the outcome they want.
---
I believe you can buy it any robot vendor..
---
You get the first one free, but don't start it at the computer at the event site unless you have a full server or else expect to battle him on your own .. I thought there was an extra step and it is not very clear ..
---
yes BUT it doesn't help anyone that travels to your camp...
---
It actually has to name what you're shooting at in the top right of the camera for it to register. Kill the vertibots, and the cargobot will circle. Chase it until you get a shot at it.
---
 I have over time replaced my BoS Heavy Combat with Legendary bits. Only the Chest is left as I cannot find a Dense mod for it and I'm not giving that up.
---
 The Black Powder guns are the best thing you have and they are not bad, some of the Armor too but nothing I want. The rest is not worth much and I'm not kidding about Wallace.
---
no
---
Right on, I hope to see you there. I think this will be really fun!
---
Black powders ftw! But for real i go through with 2 black powder guns and one shot everything.
---
Unarmed is the best if you want pure raging DPS, but it doesn't work in PA.
---
No haha, just roars. They did an awesome job with the attacks though, definitely not just a death claw reskin.
---
Soon you can carry more than you can store in your stash.
---
Haha holy shit that second picture is fucking amazing, well done
---
Yup, just fought one myself in the Cranberry Bog after an SBQ fight.
---

Ooooo!!!! Look at all the different backpacks!!!!  Wonder which one's made it into the game.  I really like #4, #6, #10, #16, #17, #18 and #19.  Can't wait to be able to collect them!!
---
Because the Responders are unappreciated and unloved.

that comment earns a *hurr* quickly followed by a succinct *durr*
---
That power armor skin is 13 USD. If they aren't hurting for money they're assholes.

I'm Xbox sadly, I think it will be too! Now I wish there was one on my console lol

I have been using it at around lvl15-lvl20 rather than the serrated machete or the Revolutionary sword. It's pretty decent.

---
Thank you, it turned out nice for a rushed picture! Happy cake day!
---
I may be offline then, but should be back online by 8-9pm EDT. See you then!
---
I mean, Beth even admitted to the Power Armor one, and it is a simple search to see other accounts of missing guns. 
---
I have 6 guns missing, the only "proof" I have, is the fact they are on the inventory spreadsheet I have and religiously maintain, and no longer on that characters inventory/stash.
---
Regardless, there is no way for anyone to really provide proof, unless they are recording/streaming the entire time and have it happen.
---
I just fought a level fifty on ps4 south of red rocket in ash heap. There is also a recipe for mutton that uses it's meat. Lousy buff of 10 percent melee. The fight was weird. Don't know if it was lag or what, but I couldn't switch weapons or use a stimpack after being hit by the quills. Disabled it's legs with a shot gun and it fell over like an assaultron. Then just shot it in the head.
---
That’s usually what I see happen here. If it never happened then then it supposedly isn’t true.
---
Does the event appear on the map?
---
It has to be a glitch, but it’s been there for 3+ patches now (possibly since launch, that’s just as early as I’ve personally checked it)
---
Try making a positive fallout 76 video for once. Doubt you will because negativity makes money
---
Dabbin on em
---
I have several legendaries I'm holding onto for when the time comes. Basically whatever players don't want and what sentimental items I can muster up the courage to say goodbye too
---
Yep. Just had one spawn near my camp between  investigators cabin and ripper alley. Gave me a bolstering combat chest piece
---
My arsenal of Gatling guns disagrees ; )  .
---
Do you check every known spawn spot or just water park?
---
cool story bro
---
Cool, I don't really pay that much attention to food/chem buffs, so I'm not terribly aware of what all you can gain from them.
---
Interesting though about the 'good with salt' card.  I'd love to free up a few points if refrigeration is similar, but I suspect that might not be the way it works (or maybe just my pessimism kicking in).
---
There was also an issue with people trapping people or dropping them in a trap
---
Hey juicey. I ussualy watch your videos as I watch a lot of other fo vids. 
---
I ussualy stop watching when you jump on the speculation hate train.  Or skip the videos titled: "betheada effed up again". 
---
Not a crazy fanboy or anything. It's just that kind of thing is ruining the community. And it's kinda of toxic. You are an influencer to a lot of these people who have a hard time making up their mind, and those who have heard mentality.
---
Also in response to the video that said, you have random videos that just dont do well, by chance where they titled something similar to above?
---
Peace.
---
True, I completely forgot about that. I have a lot of armor chest pieces in my stash that I want to sell with the player vending, modding them will save up a lot of space
---
I’m on PS4, and no not really. I enjoy playing solo, what I do in game would be very boring for anyone else on my team. I’m a plans vendor and do primarily just that. Hunt plans one day then stay at my shop all day the next just selling duplicate plans to strangers. It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
I can also be online then, awesome! I’ll see you later then.
---
Didn’t they say that in adventure mode they’re reducing all camp splash damage?
---
1st, I find aiming easier and picking up items
---
I'd think all the people who would just log in for bonuses and then log out would end up creating a mess. Like there'd end up being servers with four active players on them and 20 slots that are being consumed by people who are only logged on for just long enough to get the daily bonus. Used to see this in COD WWII all the time. You'd sit in the pregame lobby and try to find people to play with and none of them were actually playing just collecting their 200 plus consecutive days bonus and whatever promo drop crates and then logging off.
---
Yes for me it spawned there as well
---
True that’s kinda what I was hoping would happen with the lake. At least a named boss gatorclaw or something. I remember during launch people saying that they could be in the game.
---
watch out for that infusion process though.  yikes.
---
how is it verified that missions are completed?
---
yeah i looking forward to placing gnomes and teddy bears all over my CAMP once they let us
---
I hunt legendaries so I can give the good melees to my brother and hopefully become a vendor.
---
I definitely was for a while, but I ended up selling some of them to free up weight once it sunk in how far off it was. Now I just have a few that I've saved up for player vending (that I might hand over to the legendary vendor if nobody else wants them)
---
I hope the plans aren't randomly handed out as part of a daily quest reward and are more like do this quest/task get this plan.
---
Anyone ever find an answer to this?
---
I'm dying to meet this creature.
---
I hope so theres plenty room for something with that swampland off to the side of the lake
---
I found and killed it twice now not the assaultron one.
---
Except he’s probably right
---
Screenshot and post in the report channel in the discord
---
I believe the hornwright quest gives you one.
---
no one brings shit in to pvp animore lol
---
You think that's bad, The Enclave, the Brotherhood, the Responders, the Firebreathers, and even the Raiders have some related clothing. Us Free States? nada. zip. bubcus. If we didn't get a border in photo mode then I'd doubt we even are a faction.
---
Speculation.
---
With the way your camp is 9/10 never loaded fully IDs the problem, say you put it 3 stories up fast travel there and your camp isn't loaded , your just gonna fall to your death or be stuck in a foundation piece
---
That's what I like about the Creation Club. The stuff cycles and if you're just a little patient, you can get all the stuff for free
---
I mean yes painting works but come on, there's literally 2 faces.  Ark has it's good elements but player customization is a joke; i.e. people make monstrosities that make wendigos look normal
---
I needed cork for something the other day and didn't have any cause I thought I didn't need it. Can't remember what the thing was, though. Think keeping like 20 in your stash is a safe move.
---
Once again, above and beyond with the bug list man!
---
I would love to join a community of players, but theres one catch. I RP as a solo scavenger type..... and do not want to 'Join' the Brotherhood. HOWEVER, I would LOVE to have a group of friends with their shit together I could play with. Sooooo could I join at least the discord to communicate? I was thinking, my character doesnt use energy weapons....maybe I can work out a deal to turn in any dangerous tech I scav in exchange for caps/supplies/companionship? Sort of like a Brotherhood Ally/trader adjacent type?
---
My camp is right by the miners monument so ive been server hopping there. I also tried the mothman museum lastnight to no avail. I already wasted alot of caps fast travelling. Eventually... I just give up and go do my normal routine stuff since i have a limited time to play.
---
The event appears when someone comes close-- it's close to Fred's BBQ Shack in the Divide.
---
&gt; The time period the game is based on was extremely stigmatized against tattoos.
---
The 50s maybe were, but not Fallout's 2070s. There are multiple tattoo parlors in Appalachia, including the one converted into the Nukashine speakeasy.
---
Yeah I’ve done it for all the fallout games I’ve played since fallout 3. I like to find a everything.
---
I have no intention of playing on Xbox, but we could start cooperating to get ot going cross platform. 
---
It would be easy to keep a running scoreboard for hi scores for each platform.
---
We are in the apocalypse.  I don't think anyone will judge you for face tats?
---
I've already requested this a while ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anxzz6/there\_should\_be\_a\_button\_for\_eatingdrinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anxzz6/there_should_be_a_button_for_eatingdrinking/)
---
they were supposed to appear at launch, this is why this challenge appears i believe.
---
Nah, early on people levelled up too quickly. The game was way too easy. Good fun, but way too easy.
---
It’s fun. I spent a lot of time designing a store and giving it a unique look. The thing I’m most proud about is the vendor window, it’s pretty unique. And I’ve got the only remaining flying carpet in Appalachia so that draws people in too. [Check it out!](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U)
---
Yea totally agree it’s abysmal, but the painting system is noteworthy .
---
We do have a quest tag you just would be getting a rank or anything
---
If you love this wait till we get the legendary vendor, according to a post I read he isn't in just one place.
---
He can be in a number of select places but only in one of them randomly on a server but you won't know where until he's found just like the camera guy.
---
I seriously hope what I read isn't true because it'll be annoying af very quickly
---
Aaronholt Farm!
---
I'm for any system that keeps the game running while maintaining a large active player base.  I do like how atoms are not necessary to have the best builds.  I buy atoms at regular intervals to help support the game.   However, 20 years ago when money was tighter, the concept of spending real money for avatar cosmetics would have seemed absurd (still does actually).
---
Aaronholt Farm :)
---
Also spawns at an event, free range
---
If they were going that route don't you think they would have nerfed gunsmith and makeshift warrior too? Weapon durability is way worse then armor... I don't even need White Knight and only need to repair my armor once a week at most... I repair my gun at least once a session.
---
Yeah oddly enough I noticed the free states don't have a specific clothing type
---
Thanks, got to keep strong and doing the work if we want things fixed!
---
[New weapon](https://imgur.com/a/rFOX2Vm)
---
Gatorclaws were created in Nukaworld...many years from now
---
Yep totally agree its abysmal, but the painting system is note worthy .
---
No way to judge if they use a vats crit so might as well not try to patrol it. Besides maybe there's a sleeper vats melee build someone brings along.
---
Whenever I think I've found everything, I drink a nukashine and end up at some unmarked place i've never seen. 
---
But I never actually set out to find everything.
---
Please elaborate what you mean
---
That damage can't be real??
---
Remember when they increased the rate that food spoils and are now talking about refrigerator mods for a backpack?
---
Well I’m definitely interested! I’ve been running around in BOS combat armor and T-60 armor with the Knight paint job for a few weeks now. I’ve been waiting patiently for new BOS content, and this sounds like the next best thing!
---
I was going to say there's going to be a deathclaw gauntlet in one of the upcoming weekly survival mode challenges, but that isn't until June so we have a while to go before that one drops.
---
How ya getting the event to spawn? Just server hopping 1 location?
---
fur is made if ballistic fiber
---
hah same, can you still fast travel to your camp in the nuke zone
---
pic or didn't happen :)
---
Its actually slightly less than a super sledge, still really good though
---
You need some tinfoil on your head.
---
If you would like to preview an item from Atomic Shop you can view them in build mode, cant place them but you can view them at least.
---
I need friends to play this :(
---
Very true. I'm down, do the same night across the platforms would be fun. Curious, you said the buy in is 500 caps, but what's the grand prize? Everyone's buy ins or a portion of it or what?
---
Yep
---
Yeah... Thats not a good idea. Im all for a challenge but its a big map. Thanks for the heads up!!
---
Jesus Christ I want one! You could make a lot of money on the market right now crafting and selling those... just saying
---
Are you on Xbox? If so, I’ve started a non profit business recently building people camps! If you want a cool house, I can build you one
---
I have been in similar situations when I first started.  Some areas seem to spawn mobs in certain level ranges.  Occasionally certain spots seems either random levels or based on the level of the character who triggers them.  It does teach you to be on your toes in the beginning.
---
Scorchbeasts can be another matter because they sometimes randomly roam around.  And if they get your scent they sometimes never let up.  If you are in some random area and can't get out of "danger" to sneak away then you might need to log out and back in to a different server.  Until you have the perks and weapons to take them on they are a waste of ammo to attack on your own.
---
what do you mean by quest tag? And sure, I am not worried about rank, but id def like to 'know' and partner with the Brotherhood (and be able to chat on the dischord. I have not done the scorchbeast queen yet and would love to have people to call on for shit like that.) Lvl. 36 on PC here.
---
Food doesn't spoil more quickly now tho.
---
I almost gave up after an hour and a half of server hopping then someone on here posted that they found the dead tourist, so I joined his/her server.
---
Well, I get it, but the guy who $$ caps from me, doesn't take items so I'm good with caps as, in my case, they are monetizable.
---
It's almost like waking up in real life.
---
Didn't crash.. My controller ran out of juice 😂 must  have missed the alert trying to get the screenshot
---
They don't have the tools to verify that this even happened to you. Hopefully support will hook you up but It might be faster to find a new set.
---
Yeah that lake behind the communist factory in FO3 was one of my favorite things I found in any game.
---
I found a few cool things along the map edges in this game but nothing spectacular. There's a couple of reliable spawns for crowned high level enemies at unmarked locations along the upper, lower, and right side edges of the map.
---
I think they're intention is to use the unused areas along the edges for some of the expansions to the game. I think I read here that the other side of the river will be where one of the upcoming expansions takes us.
---
Hope you don't mind, reference on my bug Roundup.
---
I was at the Mothman Statue and the NPC with the new quest for the camera was there. 
---
I was offering for people to join my server to get the new quest.
---
Sorry guest not quest basily you have access to our general chat and stuff
---
It absolutely does.
---
All Raise will scale to you
---
I don't mind the camera feature itself, I actually kinda love it, I'm just irritated with these buggy broken camera challenges. I spent most of my night trying to do my challenges only to find out I won't be able to finish some of them because certain things won't register correctly.
---
Just killed one a little way down from the Top of the World
---
Something crazy happened to me when I was exploring that area: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoc8xq/underwater\_weirdness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoc8xq/underwater_weirdness/)
---
Ok thanks
---
Hope you don't mind, referenced on my bug Roundup.
---
Seems like that will be the case, from what I've read.
---
Just to keep things on an even keel though, if he spawns in Watoga, he won't be legendary and will just sell normal trash.
---
I used to be able to craft all the power armor headlamp mods, but now I can’t find them in the mod menu, is anyone else having this problem?
---
Which location ya doing? I been trying to get it myself, only have had it pop up once and that was from another player doing it xD.
---
I do not! Thanks for your work
---
Damn right. Combat drops from shitball mobs are all i use lol
---
Same. If the Mothman backpack skin isn't in the game, I'll be pissed.
---
The southern belle motel
---
Would be great if we could actually do some of those challenges. They can be ridiculously time consuming. I dont have alot of time with a family and all.
---
It's almost as if multiple threads are doing multiple things...
---
The whole pot, so however many people pitch in, it is all the caps.
---
Yeah but im lazy lol
---
Or neon lights lol
---
Has anyone tried taking a picture of the real Sheepsquatch to see if that counts as an Alien?  I took a picture of a Mirelurk King and it counted as a Sheepsquatch.
---
At level 122 my base weight is less than 120lbs out of 205lbs, massive carry weight isn’t necessary
---
If you check my last post I took a picture of it
---
Yeah, I know. Isn't it wonderful that there's no way for them to verify something that doesn't exist because of their incompetence in the first place. I thought that the first time they fucked me and I had to collect a new set to replace my original. Now I'm just pissed beyond comprehension.
---
If you are on xbox I'll give you a fully modded set for free.  How did you lose it?
---
I would say 30+ server hops for me. I must have the worse luck.
---
Of what? Alien or sheepsquatch?
---
Sheep - search new posts. Several pics already
---
They have added new possible location after they had seen that people aready knew where he might gonna be xD
---
&gt;The southern belle motel
---
just had it pop up at big fred's bbq shack in savage divide
---
Ok, i happened to check the map and got to do the event, it was worth it!
---
https://youtu.be/DDiQPscBn4g I've took the real one down twice. even gave a quick shot of the map   where I found him same place.
---
It spawns randomly, thats where the event is though
---
I don’t like the daily reward system like they did with ESO, but I like the thought of consecutively playing at least once a month would earn you atoms.
---
Definitely worth it, I was the only one on my server who did the event.
---
Usually when something like this is to glaringly absent it means it will come later with an update/DLC/expansion or they'll put it in the atom shop to coincide with an update that has related content. Willing to bet we'll see some enclave stuff mid July.
---
ok, i found out the large horn is used to make the sheepsquatch club. Blund weapon
---
We killed an alien last week actually!
---
Will do, but first I need to hit the Atom Shop for a repair kit because the only gun I carry is broke and I am over encumbered and hostiles are around so I can't fast travel to my camp.
---
ALIENS.
---
Exactly! I say allow perks / special stats of course because that's TRAINING for the big fight, which I kind of like :D
---
I just did one too and was not prepared! I threw a grenade in panic and killed two Brahmin (oops) but we were still able to defeat the Sasquatch and get some legendaries even with the failed event. I’ll try that one again and assign roles this time whooooops
---
Hollyy sh*t
---
Do you discord? Toying with setting up a discord for it, could PM you or have the server alert you.
---
I've been playing since Nov and it's happened to me twice.  Both times leg PA excavator pieces. Luckily I could just craft replacements, so I didn't post about it.
---
You can believe me or not, I don't really care.  As I said, I'm just griping.
---
Only so much we can do lol at some point you just gotta roll with it and roll the dice :D
---
Where do I go to find unsolved quests?
---
Why are people having do many problems with this? I logged into the game and only decided to go to one place, the Wavely car park. Saw two people there, left it 5 mins, then went there and picked it up straight  away. It's easy.
---
Pick up a backpack while you are getting your repair kit
---
How do you craft mutations? If you remove them, can you re-add them later?
---
I found it first location I went to and assumed everyone else would too. Sorry man, keep searching. I found mine right in front of Whitespring, the tourist was on the good of a car right by the door.
---
Free Range event 👍🏼
---
I finally found a use for those supply requisition hollow tapes I have a 100 of period just have one drop and go lewitt and snap yourself a photo my friend
---
Where did you find the cows ?
---
1st, trying to play any game in 3rd person gives me motion sickness for some strange reason lol
---
The fight with the Sheepsquatch was weird I was unable to land sneak attacks and it didn't attack me for some time😂
---
owo
---
Farm the queen, completing the quest will give you improved repair kits
---
People see what they want to see and will argue until they're blue in the face that something was nerfed even though it wasn't.
---
Yeah what Teknik said just go to main page and search by Hot topics
---
The crazy amount of BoS apparel and paint jobs says otherwise
---
I used to mod backpacks into FO4 and Skyrim, not only for the bonus but for the immersion it brings, I'm so happy it will be a thing in FO76!
---
So am I. I really can’t figure out what your confused about
---
A regular alien or a Flatwoods Monster? Flatwoods doesn't count in this case
---
Oh ok well that makes sense. I guess a boss named mirelurk queen we be better then.
---
It is super rare, you're just super lucky.
---
There is stuff out there! I found a small climbers camp that has two cooking recipes and a camp stove out near the edge... I'd add it to the fallout76 map, but not sure sure.
---
Sadly, me too
---
Fair point you have
---
Backpacks I want to get: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, then the entire bottom row.
---
I like the Corvega and tire the most, they fit what characters I like to play.
---
You get plans to make the serums from the Enclave Science Wing for 17,500 caps (with max Charisma). If you remove them you can get them back randomly from taking radiation damage, or in a controlled manner by drinking the serums for the mutations you want. The perk Starched Genes level 2 will prevent you from getting new random mutations, and from losing the ones you have. So once you get your mutation loadout the way you want it, you equip that perk and never take it off.
---
Why's this listed as a bug?
---
So another boss chance thrown in bin.
---
Do it! I’m on Xbox and I would LOVE this!!!
---
I do like it, and yeah once it gains popularity, and the high scores get high, you can start putting up legendaries if you beat the alltime highschore, not just the highest of the night. Branching out to different games would be cool and if people haven't found the game, supplying them for each night would be smart
---
It looks pretty scarry when the legendary effect happens on him:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/VU4aiW6](https://imgur.com/a/VU4aiW6)

And the red colour when he enrages looks pretty cool too:

&gt;west coast intelligent FEV strain
---
Sounds like a new weed strain
---
Seems you need to increase your real life Luck perks, i got it on first try on my 2 toons.
---
Soon
---
What level was the queen? Did she seem to have less health than usual?
---
Oh wow that’s actually sick you may be the first person, at least first I’ve seen. How’d you find it or get it to spawn? Or was it random? Either way thats really cool
---
.....yeah, there is no need for that, got like three from doing the quest alone (and don't need a lvl 50 Sheperd Stick)
---
Did they ever fix the bug where you lose the carry bonus in excavator if you exit and reenter the armor?
---
Your ideas of what works is flawed. You fail to take into account Bethesda is losing money. Not making a profit. If you have nothing the buyer wants they leave without spending. That's been proven over decades of sales. MWO has items on their store and they never take them off. Available only for cash at first then you can grind for them. They are not losing money. Explain why?
---
I wish they would fix some of the centering problems with third person. Aim is off when close up and pretty hard to pick up small things in third person but I do like third person anytime I can use it.
---
But you're not completely off target, regardless, a mutant gator would be cool to run across.
---
Awesome, glad to see there's already interest :) I'll think of a popular night which I can be fairly regularly on and start the ball rolling :)
---
But how do you add things to the map as a user?
---
Thanks y’all I found someone to help me
---
So People never thought of that they maybe nerfed White Knight so they can put in repair kits for a reason and you, the White Knight are Mr.Smartypants and figured that out all alone? \*gives this man a Cookie\*
---
Lucky you. Lol.
---
Because i meant to click spoiler, thanks :p
---
To bad it cant spawn on black powder weapons
---
What build are you running for the damage to be so high?
---
Thanks i will look there tonight.
---
Bloodied
---
yea i did everything... even quick traveled to other side of map and back. (cause there were several players, piles didnt vanish). did not help. searched whole shack area... there was this really annoying gun fire sound effect bug going on, so did search the area only twice. everyone gathered to spot where i slain that thing. and nothing at all. spent probably 100caps and half hour for it.
---
it did disappear the instant i killed it. only saw loot menu for slit second. and gone.
---
If you're really willing to do that, I'd DM you my details and owe you many favors.
---
I was jumping to find marine armor helmet plans. Bam there it was check out the map location. Spawn twce first time I was like wow, then sever hopped and there it was again. So two our of three hops not back. Got a ghoul Slayer sword off of the first one and an assassin shotgun off the second one.
---
But the legendary vendor..
---
Fine by me, it’s always felt like everyone attacks you with the same legendarys already.
---
we was the normal 3 star queen.  
---
i did join a team at the queen fight so i could get credit.
---
I really need to look into that, my damage output is abysmal compared to yours.
---
Yo wtf?? I posted this comment on a different post ON A DIFFERENT SUBREDDIT, and it ended up here lmao how?
---
I want to see how it works on the union soldier outfit that already has a backpack
---
I'm getting flashbacks of that bunny from Wallace and Grommit. ***Cheeese?***
---
I think I did that in the first week of release. I love grenades.
---
If only these were the only bugs
---
That's the funny thing about the word "most", it literally does not mean "all".
---
Yes. None of those things work.
---
Yeah the huge nuke crater in new Vegas or fallout (I don’t remember) called the devils pit??? with the huge horde of centaurs and evolved centaurs was mine. Yeah I’ve also heard about the river expansion.
---
I had a fog crawler (level 51 I think) keeping its attention which helped me. The 'spikes' didn't do too much damage and it gave you warning to block them
---
I only went Willard once and checked the locations around toxic valley. Ive just wasted so much time and caps up there. My camp is by whitesprings so i rather stay there. I will say... I hadnt been up to toxic valley to explore for a while so it was nice doing the dailys up there.
---
Oh okay. I was just confused/curious lol.
---
When I am overweight and used up the available cap pool, I typically drop a bag of legendary items I don’t intend to keep or I stuff them in a suitcase at a train station
---
yea i figured it out by " re-active pylons " message... and i was almost whole time one. but i use super baseball bat as main weapon so needed to get up and close. and i did only enter once in second wind time.
---
Yeah i just put the wrong thing lol, sorry about that
---
I see. That sucks. Every now and then someone posts about having a tourist. Just join one of them. Easiest way.
---
https://youtu.be/DDiQPscBn4g killed 2 level 50's here.
---
Forreal, you'd think you'd be able to get some BOS stuff from distant thunder, line in the sand or whatever but its usually just stims and junk
---
I mean I try to stay pretty objective and I think unfortunately Bethesda has been messing up lately on a couple things. I understand wanting to avoid the toxicity and what not, but I don't want to be the person who only covers the positive stuff and not the negative stuff. Sometimes I can get carried away being overly positive or overly negative, but I try to be fair in the way I present stuff so people can reach their own opinion on something. 
---
Like I think the update bugs are just one of those things that could/should be avoided. With almost every update now we get a few serious bugs. I can see how people view pointing that out as being toxic, but I think it also could lead to Bethesda changing their update methods. Whether than be delaying updates for more testing or alternatively a public test server. 
---
The random videos that didn't do well had nothing to do with negativity. One was on Fallout 76 side quests and another one unrelated. That seems to be due to YouTube's algorithm or some weird factors I'm unaware of
---
I haven't heard anything yet, but I wonder... did people check the taxidermy office? Upstairs, there's a map with many locations marked off
---
I will check on here if i cant get it soon. I rather try to figure it out on my own but its a little frustrating at times. Thanks!!
---
I'll give that a try, I don't recall seeing a fix for that in the patchnotes. When I did queen of the hunt I got a mothman, so I thought you always get a mothman.
---
Isn't fishing a scouting badge?  Seems like Ever Upwards would be the perfect opportunity to add it.
---
me too, man, me too
---
What is your vram usage when those texture anomalies happen? I used to have this happen in Fallout 4 on a previous Fury X 4GB card and it was always after extended playtime causing 90%+ vram usage; simple restart of the game would fix it until vram was getting full again.
---
After 3 hops, I told myself. Nope, not with me. And joint someone. Good luck.
---
Some of the items in the atomic shop can be found in game though, no?
---
What system? If it’s on PS4 I may have a duplicate
---
How many teddy bears playing chess or other board games did you  find? I'm really interested.
---
we have enough rampant fascism in this country as it is, now you wanna add Post-Nuke Fascists?!
---
I’m on PC but thank you for the offer, wish it was cross platform.
---
The sonner it gets patched out, the better.
---
I forget where I’ve gotten them though, sorry
---
Yes! Grind Away
---
Thats leftover code from fallout 4
---
Looks like Skeletors staff Haha. Awesome!
---
I agree with that sentiment.  Until now i just collect meat regardless of what kind it is and just cook and eat it to avoid starvation.  Now I might start caring about which foods I keep in case I need them for specific locations.
---
I believe you can buy them at the whitesprings vendor that sells all the camp plans that's were I got mine
---
But why make new content for low level players? They have the whole base game
---
I think they're at studio 58 in whitespring resort
---
I’ve been checking those map locations every patch. Nothing new that I’ve seen
---
I’ve checked there and didn’t see it. Anyone know what the plans are actually called?
---
Backpacks will be obtained in game. Skins might be in the atom shop but the backpack itself won’t be, and after the fiasco regarding repair kits they shouldn’t be stupid enough to try selling mods on the atom store. They’d end up with my bloodied spear up their arses, every single one of them. 👍🏻
---
What's this?
---
I have two mules, one with 500 weapon stash, and one with 500 Armor in the stash. 
---
If you're on PC I can help you move them from your main char to a second mule one, it's how me and my friends have stored our legendarys.
---
So sad that i only got 3 eggs :( i was busy with exams, didn't even know about the event until it was almost over.
---
Remember that prestiges are coming in the summer
---
Well great. Now THAT's out in the world. LOL.
---
If you haven't played Fallout 1, 2, Tactics, or New Vegas, the strain of FEV that was being worked on by the West Coast branch of West Tech was a lot different then those seen in Fallout 3, 4 &amp; 76.
---
The biggest differences were that if the victim didn't have too much radiation damage, it actually increased intelligence or kept it at the same level. The super mutants were also much more stable and didn't slowly grown into lumbering behemoths as time passed. 
---
Finally, it was administered as an injection or through contact with the liquid. Most super mutants were made by literally dropping human victims into a vat of the stuff.
---
the spoiler tag is useless if you are going to put the spoiler in the title...
---
1st unless I'm looking around corners on survival
---
 Dumped there because they were garbage?
---
I wanna say older vids were pretty bad in a sense of hate. But then again the state of the game was in need of improvement at best. The newer vids are better and I see you play the devils advocate more.
---
I do enjoy the vids most of the time 
---
Can I suggest a snippet somewhere? I've done a little research + investment in on my xbox. I ran some tests and found a lot of "issues" is partly because this game kind of sucks on a spinning disk drive. The size of the land is so huge it needs faster read write data, which current gen just lacks. Fortunately PC you can install a ssd, and ps4 and xbox u can install a usb3.0 external enclosed with a ssd and get amazing results. I'll edit in a second and post my findings from an old link I made. It's like a 50 dollar investment, but it improves my look on not only this game, but older Beth/ games that have huge worlds and load times.
---
Most likely but surely you'd just sell them to get a few caps?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl)
---
it's more about the pictures.
---
Just move your actual CAMP device and you will change where you load in.
---
Dude, you rule! Thank you!
---
Also, as the Melee weapon loses condition it loses damage. 
---
If it deals 100 damage at 100% durability, it will deal around 75 damage at 50% and 55 damage at 25%.
---
Beth is also running the website where they sell the good legendary items for rl money , that’s why they nerfed legendary spawns 
---
/takes tinfoil hat off 
---
You people need a life
---
I'd rather have more stash storage.
---
The two I killed didn't have that
---
Nah man, look, I have the "evidence" right here in this caps stash, I'm sure you'll be convinced by my argument.

---
yeah, but the fact that the real one is in is also a spoiler, imagine my reaction when coming across one *without* the knowledge he is real...
---
nope not at all, sooner they get it fixed the sooner i can go back to no background music
---
Yeah.. skins. Backpack skins. They dont say ”your first backpack mod” 
---
All backpacks are identical, its the mods that make them different
---
My gamer tag is xx Dinkles xx.  Your choice of BOS I or BOS II paint.  Both sets have the same mods (calibrated shocks, jet pack, optimized bracers, and Vats helmet).  I didn't know about this glitch, but don't keep empty power armor frames in my inventory.  I've been collecting PA since Beta, but it's gotten a little ridiculous, so I'm happy to help a fellow Vaulter out ;).  I will be on at about 2:00 pm PDT (about 3 hrs from now).
---
The higher your level the bigger your camp budget
---
Yeah that’s getting super annoying
---
Yea looking back some of my videos definitely went overboard on the hate train, no excuse for that. I think it was a byproduct of just reading forums and discords shitting on the game so I mirrored that mentality even though I was attempting to remain objective. I was seeing less of the positives in the game because I wasn't pay as close attention to them (even if there were a lot of negatives, it wasn't all negative).
---
That is pretty interesting. I was thinking at one point about doing a video on performance improvements in Bethesda games from HDD to SSD to NVME, maybe I'll look into it again. I'd love to hear what you find around that.
---
WE NEED THIS. IF I GOT 1 atom for every disconnect ... I'd be able to get that PA paint I want
---
Crabs and killer plants.
---
Possible rewards?
---
Dedicated the entire day searching for it - just finished a full each of all the known locations on the same server. 
---
Tried server hopping, but on PC oceanic, so get the feeling there's only like 3 active servers to begin with and kept cycling through the same ones.
---
Most frustrating thing is not knowing exactly where they spawn so I've probably missed it several times. Whitespring's a damn huge place to search for a unremarkable corpse. Is it inside Uncanny Caverns or outside? Like "Watoga", seriously.
---
Well, I suppose but what would be a better title?
---
Wow what location is this! Thanks for posting!
---
nice a new weapon   ...is it one hand or 2
---
Damn. Oh well. Thanks
---
I know so many of my space issues are caused by the fact that I am just sitting on two and three star legendary’s waiting for the vendor.
---
The fridge is a MOD not a backpack. Seriously, this paranoia is just stupid
---
Wait so if I have my excavator Chassis in my inventory, and get in my t 60 modded set, I'll lose my excavator armor?
---
When i farm whitesprings i usually get so many legendaries (mostly crappy 1* guns and armor) i just drop them because i don't have enough stash space or the vendor doesn't have any cash
---
Hello,
---
I had the same issue as you untill I followed this guide of Bethesda:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/46062/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNTU2MjE2MjIyL2dlbi8xNTU2MjE2MjIyL3NpZC9mVXphejNjcjR5TW9ZWHlnQU52TTZRMkFQVDV6bnVzemJvNENhUVJxd2RkVFVISUFnU01yaXJpRGl5eFJFem5Ea2ZGQXJCZTJyV21fNnh0UlNDWDc2a3hWdkhXS0NoVVVJYklVSHNXbGVyT21RUVk0Q3Z1UiU3RWwzQSUyMSUyMQ%3D%3D
---
Things seem to be fine now :)
---
It looks really cool, where was that?
---
Different pieces count more against the budget, so you likely have high cost things in there like turrets or crops. Also the items you have stored in the CAMP count against budget, even if not placed. Hope that helps.
---
There are games out there that do all 3 and are successful at it.  However the service provided needs to be enough to justify the cost.
---
Right now, this game doesn't provide enough value to justify a subscription model (though that might be the effect rather than the cause, depending on how you look at it).  I'm not even sure if it is designed in a way to allow that much content.
---
I think the thought process is that they'll earn enough in microtransactions to keep the lights on after they're done adding content.  The game price is paying for a certain amount of content, and continued development will need to be paid for somehow.  And unless they're making bank on microtransactions, there *will* be a point where they stop adding things.  You can't continue to pay the bills (and developers) if the income isn't there.  And that will inevitably be what kills the game off (outside private servers at least).
---
The tricky bit is getting the right price point on the store items.  Right now they're probably looking at the WoW model (charge ALL the dollars!), but this is a different game altogether, so that just won't work (IMO).
---
how would i go about viewing the code if i wanted to do more research?
---
I have a Bloodied one that's my go-to melee weapon for Power Armor.  I like it.  It hits fairly hard, has armor penetration properties, and a Medium swing speed.
---
You got something against tires???
---
True but we dont know what hes capable of
---
I found one after the recent event Free Range
---
Do you have the numbers on how fast things spoil then and now? Most things seem to last 5-6 hours, and there’s zero challenge finding food and water.
---
Lol one can hope
---
There is a million bos paints and outfits. What are you talking about
---
This has been proven to be incorrect.
---
maybe some of the new mounted heads will be rewards as well
---
So since there's no reason to rule it out let's jump to conclusions and start complaining about it now just in case.... Is that really what you believe is the logical rational response?
---
I'd imagine if they did something like this, the welcome mat would just override the existing fast travel point rather than becoming an additional one.
---
Some items take way more budget than others. Whilst  a recent patch really improved things, lights and turrets cost more than say... a couch or table.
---
Other high budget items I can recall right now include water purifiers, generators, artillery pieces, the west Virginia signage from the atom shop, terminals, pylons and wired lamposts. 
---
Not sure about the PA station...
---
Hey are you on PC? I have an Alt with around 75 different notes/recipes I find out in the wasteland I always sell for cheap. 
---
Let me know if you want to check them out.
---
Oh? I haven't done mine. What was your secondary?
---
Xbox unfortunately :(
---
So if I have an empty chassis in my inventory and get in a chassis with armor will it dupe the set to the empty chassis?
---
No you guys are right. There isn't enough negativity around this game so its smart to manufacture some.
---
I keep 2 bulk of everything. Bulk everything else, sell anything above 2. I keep 50 of nonbulkable junk. Seems to really simplify my stash.
---
Depends on what all you have at your camp. Lights and turrets still take up a good chunk. The fertilizer resource or Brahmin takes up a large chunk, like 15% of your budget. Roofs take up a lot too so if it’s a large building, just enclosing all of it will eat into your budget. So it’s either build a smaller place and decorate smart, or build an empty mansion.
---
well does your camp look nice or like a raider shack ...cause i had my non turret camp there forever and it was never messed with but it looked nice.
---
I don't know...  sorry mate, I just commented on the last straw, have seen so many posts spoiling this before you that I just had to write my thoughts down...
---
Is there anyway to increase the budget?
---
So it's basically a death claw re-skin....
---
Like Pokemon Go? 😅
---
I set up a shop there when I first started and had the same thing happen many times. It’s mostly just high level dicks “bored”
---
If you sell stuff to a vendor really quick it can select random stuff in the inventory and sell that by accident. 
---
Same thing happens if you try to loot say, lots of Ammo from your stash quickly, you may end up
---
With some Aid coming over too. 
---
I had this happen with my Legendary Armour before when selling hats but luckily I realised and bought it back of the vendor.
---
Yeah but the quill attack is new I think
---
I'm sorry if I spoiled you, if I thought of a better title I would have used one. I am sorry
---
Which event?
---
2 hand
---
I'd rather have found a megasloth for today's challenge to be honest :D
---
Great point.
---
Wow, this turned from the actual topic, to a bot that downvotes new posts, and democracy
---
I'll have to check that. This is a new problem for me so I didnt think of that. Thank you.
---
You mean like how Bethesda manufactured non cosmetic micro transactions
---
[deleted]
---
Not at the moment. There were rumours that it could vary depending on where you camp, but unconfirmed.
---
Honestly though, since the patch I mentioned the budget should be plenty for a large decorated house. Trust me, it used to be way worse back in the days of having like 4 lights in your house and scrapping things but not getting the budget back!
---
I spend a lot of time building, lemme know if you have any other questions.
---
Free range
---
That seems to be when they hit mine, when I set up a wood shop with not that many things in it, it was left alone. When I put time into it they had their go with it lol
---
A lot of stuff in the game is multiplicative, so if say, good with salts reduces spoilage by 90%, refrigerator does the same, you'd be left with like 1% spoilage rate. Things would probably take weeks to spoil.
---
I agree, especially with camp stuff. I've bought a few things now that really pissed me off. Like the string lights which I thought would look great on my waterfront porch but instead now I have nuka cola shadows all over the place.
---
I saw your post. The spawns are weird In this game.
---
You can get the enclave outfit from the quest line and it looks pretty cool. Not sure if by objects you meant wearable stuff as well so.
---
I have *very* similar specs to your rig, but I'm not seeing many issues.  I'll have the occasional CTD (like once every few days), but it's generally improved since I first started.
---
The one difference I can see is you're at 1440 while I'm running at 1080.  It's possible that your settings are a little high for the card (it shouldn't be, but the game is really a hog on graphics).  You might try turning down a few settings to see if that helps at all.
---
Yeah that’s odd because my house isn’t what I would consider that large and I don’t have that much in it. I must have high budget items. Thanks for the info. I’ll do some more research on it and see what I have to change
---
Awesome, appreciate it :)
---
Building the Red Enamel Stove in friendly CAMPs and Workshops is a bug not listed. Good roundup for the others!
---
Yeah. It works on him.
---
Good luck!
---
Is it using deathclaw animations?
---
Hmmm...dosent sound familiar. New im guessing?  Any idea where it starts? Thanks btw
---
... I might actually do that for the stuff I am holding on that char due to carry weight perks. Thanks for the idea.
---
I fought a lvl 70 same deal with a group of 8 and we got our asses pounded
---
funny this thread has been downvoted a bunch, but a week ago or so i made almost the same post, and it got upvoted past 1000
---
this sub is weird
---
you know, i actually did a thought experiment with this and had a few conclusions. 
---
1: it would be incredibly stable and easy to strap to just about any base frame you tack together. (possibly not even need one if you have rope)
---
2: if you cut open a small slide of tire, stick something into the rubber 'bottom end' to keep things from moving around, you could potentially stuff a lot of stuff into an empty tire and it would be relatively well protected. 
---
3: the heavy metal nature of the center of the backpack would be GREAT for damage reduction when being shot in the back in center mass. You could also bolt things to its frame.
---
4: toss the tire into a pile of junk and no one would be the wiser, you could theoretically use is as a holding stash IF no one else knew how that tire worked, or if it was a fake. 
---
i kinda want this tire backpack now.
---
Southern belle motel, new event
---
Ok. Thanks!
---
let my upvote this now as im sure there will be a bunch of people coming in downvoting saying you are making all this up
---
Was this supposed to be clever or something?
---
Mods don’t change affects.
---
I think we will all need a polly-sea to cover us for the myriad of mishaps we encounter upon every update. I do enjoy an unexpected consequence every now and then, it keeps us on our toes.
---
The glitch has only happened to me when I have a full set of armor on a chassis in my inventory, and I enter an unowned chassis. When I try to "put down" either chassis after the new one was selected, they both read as the newer chassis that was picked up, and the old one disappears.
---
I hopped 20 times to this location,it never showed up!!wtf,theres like 3 or 4 cars in the parking lot not?
---
Gotta say, there are decidedly perks for the super early adopters. You got access to paintjobs a lot of us didn't get, legendary spawn rates I would murder for, etc....
---
Okay, awesome. I'll try and log on around that time!
---
Classic!
---
Was it a quest or just random?
---
Shhhh........
---
That's pretty common now. They changed the way that you log into servers a bit by making you favor the server you were already in as the first option to return to assuming isn't full. They did this to combat server hopping. That won't fix server hopping though since I don't just leave and rejoin a random server, I add everyone in the servers repeatedly and use the people who accept as a jumping point for specific servers. really useful for farming or if you need an anchor to transfer gear between characters. Also fun for getting back at people who think it's cute to harass my lower lvl alt character. When I show back up with my main and I'm all of the sudden over lvl 100, they rethink what they did. Some fun pvp stuff happens especially when contesting a workshop.
---
Can't wait to become Moses.
---
Random encounter up in the mire!
---
I'm not sure if the glitch happens every time or not, but it's happened to me often enough that I have never tried to carry more than one chassis until there was a confirmed fix.
---
So far, only the faschnact donuts (at least from what I have experienced). Course those also require frog eggs (gross). Would honestly prefer if we could get our hands on chicken eggs instead, especially since chickens can be found in the world. Perhaps we could get a chicken coop plan.
---
Inboxed you - realized I was making a conversation in ops post.
---
No. I think the skeleton is the same, but the animations/model are entirely different- he also does stuff that Deathclaws can't do (like jump attacks, kicks, quill throws, and so on).
---
Well, it is a item for convenience so please don't give them any ideas.
---
This is a survival game with wilderness. You can pick up a fishing pole. The real challenge is can they code it in without 4,900 glitches?
---
Confirmed. Began today at noon Eastern time. Should run through midnight this Sunday night.
---
Yep. Someone will find them and make use of them, either in a build or sell them. Paying it forward, we'll call it.
---
That's unarmed vs 2h. Unarmed is best cause it counts both twisted muscle and talons. IMO unarmed&gt;2h&gt;1h
---
They gave us Beta Testers some Atoms, outfits and a hearty handshake. What more do you want?
---
It's coming, afaik. I've got a few things I'm holding for placement.
---
Jump attacks?! POGGERS
---
Because a base in that location, even without turrets, messes with spawns.
---
*It can lock out the low level spawns so people can't complete the "kill 10 golfer ferals" quest
---
*It draws the spans to the base versus where they should be (and where everyone is looking.
---
*Some are placing their base to where no spawn can get in, then drawing the soawns to them and killing them all before anyone else can get a legendary
---
*Several other reasons that interfer with others gameplay experience
---
Generally, it's inconsiderate to place a base next to a random spawn location or high level farming area as it can actually lock the spawns out too so nothing spawns at all.
---
Yea I see where he posted 1h now lol
---
In fo4 I had a museum-style room using the mannequins to model my favorite getups, I miss it!
---
You were probably out of action points from sprinting or jumping. You cant even open vats if ap isnt high enough
---
As far as I know, they are an uncommon drop so you have to craft and scrap them. I've only ever found one and my main character is level 52.
---
It might be too close to a wall or something else obstructing your player from using it
---
thats good i was worried it was only gonna show up in the new event
---
Honestly, no. That's a very common thing used by free to play games, and I feel like Bethesda doesn't need that comparison at the moment.
---
I spend 95% of the time in third-person. 
---
I go first-person when it comes to picking tiny things up, like golf balls or Mainframe Cores, or when I'm in tight spaces with Power Armor, like Lucky Hole Mine.
---
I'm pretty sold on that style. Thanks for posting a picture!
---
Why do you say that?  
---
It's not like *all* Japanese are descended from samurai?
---
That was stressful to watch.  I seriously need to woman up in this game.
---
Yep, my AAE shotty is deadly.  The number of times I've killed myself with it deserves its own achievement!
---
I'm interested and I have a nice variety of costumes.
---
Isnt there atoms for playing a certain amount of hours? Does that count?
---
Running along behind us swallowing up those pesky mole rats.
---
Yeah. He can jump on the spot for AOE damage all around him, and - from what I noticed - leap at you to close the distance if you run away (it does damage).
---
The opposite alsl happens. Say something good about Bethesda here and you'll get set on fire.
---
Let me move it and see if that’s the issue
---
I never dip that low in frames, and I’ve done a few queen events since the patch with no FPS drops really. 
---
The crashes are at random times, haven’t had a single one at anything too graphic intensive.
---
Sometimes it’s just loading the world, going in/out of pip boy or crafting benches, or just walking around the world or an indoor zone not fighting anything and crash.
---
It’s only been since this patch as well.
---
Let's talk about a rational logical response, shall we.  How 6 months of trading and positive karma on reddit can be wiped clean in just a few days by being critical of a game by some Bethesda fanboys (not that I care).  So don't get me started.  I'm fucking mad, and rightly so!  I defended this game from day one.  Worse game community I've ever encountered in all my years.
---
Nah you right
---
I agree with all these points. As someone who rarely uses PA backpacks are a dream come true. Although a nice cosmetic/gameplay addition could be PA pouches. Could physically show little pouches etc hanging off your PA. An example could be...
---
“AmmoBearer” mod - reduces weight of ballistic ammo at the cost of AP. Adds an ammo box cosmetic attached to your PA.
---
This could be similar to backpacks. Sacrifice A to have better B.
---
Off the top of my head, most likely because of the BOS being the dicks they are and demanding any and all research/technology for themselves and not helping out non BOS.
---
Because they were pinching the Responders stuff
---
It's full I've set there for a bit to make sure done quite a bit to see if anything changed but still nothing
---
It happened to my weapon bench the other day, I had the right side of it too close to the wall and it wouldn’t let me use it
---
I *think* the very best armor you can get in this game turns out to be marine combat armor. Can't remember what it's called.
---
Then don’t buy it , it’s as simple as that
---
Who else did you expect to mod r/teachersgonewild
---
It's fine if they do, I'm almost 30. I seriously don't have the time to come up with an elaborate scheme for freebies; I do have the time to try and put more eyes on this fucktarded glitch, though. I posted about it months ago when it happened the first time, and I'm hoping I have photo proof with the armor and my gamertag somewhere in my phone, not that I think that will be worth much to Bethesda.
---
Upgraded Marine armor is second only to BoS Combat armor I think.
---
There is a nice spreadsheet on this subReddit with all of them calculated.
---
Have fun everyone!
---
Holy shit it's about time!
---
Kinda wish they had their own backpacks. Like Raider armour with half a shopping cart welded to the back. Though I guess that would interfere with the jetpack. Maybe a super rare jetpack backpack?
---
Hmm. The only time vats doesn't work for me is if there are no enemies or my ap is too low
---
I'm close to that.  I have two Sentinel and one Cavalier that I found on my own.
---
It's easy to overlook, but nevertheless very rare.
---
I squared off with a deathclaw, we both started running toward each other and I exploded him in one punch. Bloody mess is fun.
---
I believe the details are to good to be made up.  If so, that good of story telling still deserves a free set of T-60 😁
---
Whereas on Xbox and PC people will grief you until you rage quit. PlayStation really does have the best people 💗
---
Disable any mods you have and test (rename custom.ini to custom.iniold) if no mods check the folder anyway to make sure drunk you did not try Instal them.
---
It is in the game rn
---
I've got an alt with about 1500lbs of legendaries on standby, including some good rolls. I'm hoping there is some mechanic that would allow existing rolls to be switched in some fashion. I'm sure we've all had brilliant effects on the wrong weapon (faster fire rate black powder weapons I'm looking at you). If we could swtich/transfer with existing pieces that would be brilliant. However I am expecting simply to be given a method of re-rolling the effects on any given piece. As such 'any' three stars on the right weapon or armor piece will be useful to hold onto. Have been saving heavy combat and handmades as a result...
---
Or trapper armor.
---
Still shit dps with those weapons
---
lol
---
I'm not a serious rig owner (nor a YouTuber), but I am seeing nothing at all like what's described.  If anything, things run better now than the have in the past for me.  
---
OP didn't mention their platform, but on PC there's a ton of possible things to check before blaming outside influences.  Not so much on consoles though.
---
how about weapons breaking too quickly?  I have a2 star TSE handmade that i repair to 200%.  I run about 400 rds through it and it is dead.. broken.. This is insane breakage speed.  Especially when I have repaired it to 200%. A 50 cal machine gun will run through 3-4 thousand rounds without breaking @ 200% repair.
---
It is strange though that at level 1, your budget is maxed out with 4 wooden walls, a roof and 2 corn plants.
---
I now have 9 of the Improved repair kits (3 awarded with each SBQ battle) they are taking up space in my stash, I can't sell them, I can't give them away, and I would only use one as a desperate last resort, so....would someone please explain to me how this creates an advantage.
---
maybe just scroll down just a bit in the "new" or the "top"
---
Power armor needs more mods, and legendary pieces. I havent put on PA in months except one time to jump off a mountain. It's leveling gear for your first character.
---
Man I would kill for some enclave power armor paint jobs
---
Look up the term "glass cannon" while you are at it.
---
Bought a Tse gauss for 7500 the other day. I dont even want it to use it's just collecting dust as a legacy weapon that tons of people have. I'm waiting for time to pass so that it's more rare before I flip it
---
After death, respawn screen does not count unyielding and weight reducing armor effects. Introduced in PS4 with patch 8.
---
Red tactical moth man headlamp cannot be applied, not visible under headlamp section. PS4 introduces with patch 8.5
---
Brahmin cannot be milked while having a disease and plague walker. Patch 8.5 PS4
---
I will also try that too. Thank you.
---
What are your thoughts?
---
If they add in fishing then I'll never stop playing.
---
Downvote the downvote thread?
---
The responders were childish dreamers.  Never really grasped how dangerous the world could be until it was too late.
---
half wall on the top, 4 filing cabinets, 2 in each side, and a white concrete guard post facing away in the middle to cover it
---
I want golfing. The courses are already there. I can see it now my par 3 screwed up by a nuke and then my eagle on a par 5 messed up by a scorch beast taking my ball away.
---
no worries mate, I'm sorry if I was being rude.
---
*sigh* where is the sarcasm flair?
---
I would have said that, but I didn't know if that's objectively what happens, versus the server detecting a hit when you didn't see one.
---
I’m pretty sure everyone thought the Scorchbeasts were a myth or handy justification for the Brotherhood commandeering ammo and food and supplies, so they turned their backs on the Brotherhood, and learned too late that Scorchbeasts were very real after the Brotherhood fell at Fort Defiance.
---
The Brahmin of Appalachia thank you for your service
---
wow, CAMPs actually affect spawns? That's both stupid and shitty yo be honest. I don't have any turrents, except a couple indoors, or anything and no monsters spawn right where my camp is (at the moment near the river away from the golf club) so mobs don't really go there unless you actively drive them there.
---
Do we know exactly how and why it affects spawns? I'll feel kinda shitty knowing it would do that so I guess I'll consider moving it somewhere else then.
---
Badge one: collect 1000 atoms....
---
OP was looking for a behemoth, not a grub worm.
---
I'll take "Truth Hurts" for 1000, Alex.
---
Yeah.  Endurance is a tight stat for me and for END 3, I'd want Vaccinated to do a *lot* better than it does.
---
not amazing but not a simple shack really. My only turrets are inside just in case a monster finds their way inside.
---
That's a brilliant idea!  I'm sure with some tinkering I could get that to fit, or find an alternate phrase.
---
maybe a downgrade is in order then lol
---
Or just farm them without the chameleon and bask in the chaos.
---
I'm afraid that's not how Camp decoration is going to work... 
---
My guess is this:
---
1. Only specific shelves/tables are eligible for specific items.
---
2. Using such a table brings up an inventory screen, similar to a crafting station.
---
3. This inventory screen displays compatible items from inside the stash for this particular piece of furniture (e.g. a small nightstand has one "slot" in the middle, a shelf has three slots in a row).
---
4. Selecting an item will now display it in one of the slots as a static, non-interactive object, but it will still technically be inside of the stash (so it'll still take up space there).
---
The magazine racks or the Bobblehead stands in Fallout 4 come to mind. These are basically containers into which a specific number of a specific item type can be placed and upon exiting this inventory, the game automatically displays these items. I highly doubt that they'll let us freely place junk items around the Camp.
---
Got the crock plan and a mutton pie recipe
---
I think they meant the bit about utility items. Specifically, the fridge one.
---
They worked together a lot at first along with the free states. Eg Grafton Dam and The Battle of Huntersville.
---
But seems as Maxsons ideology behind the Brotherhood changed and things in Appalachia got desperate the groups distanced themselves.
---
The Brotherhood closed ranks and started focusing on technology etc. There was lots of dispute over salvage claims and when the BOS abandoned the Grafton Dam it cut off the trade route between the Free States and Responders. Then the raiders stole mini nukes from the BOS and used them on Charleston Dam. (Christmas Flood). 
---
So after that the factions had all become isolated from one another. Eventually The scorched wiped out the BOS who had held them in the Bog. The responders didn’t listen due to distrust and were caught unprepared.
---
So to answer, they used to be allies but as both groups ideologies changed they grew distant and eventually this distrust lead to Appalachia’s downfall. Had the factions worked together with the responders vaccine, fire breathers ammo, free states detectors/traps and the BOS weapons and military power. They would have defeated the scorched. Alas they didn’t but we cult dwellers have access to all those things. That’s why we will win.
---
Didn't mean for this to sound so ranty guys. I get that it is a 'duh' topic but I just really needed to say it somewhere, been thinking it awhile. Sorry for the discourse! &lt;3
---
Super fun when it happens right after a nuke is launched.
---
i see around this sub that the beast is supposed to show up on a brahmin related event, but mine was just sitting there as a random enounter, though it would have probably gone eating a couple of poor brahmins later if it wasn't for my axe. do you by any chance know the name of said event?
---
Most players don't use the aftermarket.
---
Also, many 76 players have a generous streak in the first place.
---
What? Everybody is tired of playing dross toss?
---
Any updates on finding Wood Armor Plans?  I want them all, because why not
---
Need a Wildman backpack to match outfit. :&gt;
---
:c But the skull is scaaary. I prefer a syringe, or maybe a lantern.
---
I think I figured it out. Attach wires when you are in the power conduits tab. Works reliably.
---
Ya there will be enemies right in front of me and vats will be full but wont do anything it wont even go down when I hit the button
---
It's out
---
There is no need to do the event to see it. I found two in the cranberry bog but they were hard to kill with my low level alt which is nice.
---
Talking about the crook, got a electrified plan for it.
---
The first mention of refrigerators was a while back when they first started talking about repair kits, I hope they don't.
---
just 1 fiber
---
&gt; one slice of Sheepsquach meat

Wondering if Sheepsquatch recipes will show up in world for this.
---
Your on pc?
---
PS4.
---
Damn.oh well.
---
Not a bad idea
---
Well its about damn time...
---
Almost, if you would´ve been on pc i would have given you a new one.
---
I’m starting to realize they’re not very rare. I’ve come across three more since I made this post. All in the Cranberry Bog.
---
How do you get your Pipboy to display those icons by all the items? That is legit
---
Nah, I always have lockpick maxed and on and I've never gotten armor that helps with lockpicking. I have 2 pieces I've bought from a vendor though.
---
Watch all your videos man love every one
---
Scars too... my [PvP character](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/571044854931521536/unknown.png) is covered in them because of how abusive people are but he needs them on the rest of his body too. :s
---
Did they changed the patch day to Thursday instead of Tuesday? Cause both May 7 and May 23 are Thursday.
---
This. Try doing a silo run as melee. You're going to need a lot of stimpacks.
---
Do you have stored items? They count towards you budget. You need to place them or scrap them.
---
For me 'graphically intense' is turning the camera too fast (or probably just at the wrong time) :P  I've crashed a few times like that, and a few times on startup just as the world renders.  Never during SBQ or other fights.
---
I do get occasional graphics 'lags' where things seem to take a bit to display, so I assume I'm pushing the limits a bit on my 1080 at times, which is why I wonder if there's just too much going on at once for the game software (or the card) to handle.  Since the world is all pre-loaded at the time, I know it's not the servers or the connection...but I haven't crashed at that point anyway.
---
But...in the end, this *is* Bethesda we're talking about, unoptimized settings and wonky physics are their calling card.
---
Got the crook and mutton pie
---
How dare you that could be 20 caps
---
Perhaps the decapitated one in the taxidermy shop at Lewisburg?
---
I’m 125 and already there.  I’ve got 7-8 unused.   I’m an explosive shotgun, tse 10mm PA gunner with a ski sword.  I honestly don’t know what to do with more perks.   It would seem that I could essentially build a non PA melee sneak build on the same character.  We need more perks.
---
The big question in why can't you cook the meat?
---
I've never been able to build atom shop items at friends camps, even if they owned the items as well. I've tried build &amp; replace.
---
BUT WHERES THE DAMNED CAMERA? IVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE! IT FOESNT EXIST! BETHESDA SCREWED US OVER!
---
I'd like to get an Adrenal Reaction, I'll be on about 5:00 PM Central.

Just curious, where is your source that Bethesda is losing money directly due to the Fallout 76 atom shop (as opposed to say the other issues with the game)?  I did a quick search and couldn't find that Bethesda was losing money from the Atom Shop, on the other hand the bigger issue seems to be that the items are priced too high for what they are, no one wants to pay $10 for a skin for Power Armor.  .  
---
Of course if you have nothing the buyer wants they leave without spending, that's a no brainer, but scarcity and urgency also drive sales too - which is exactly what a limited time item is.  And it's not like that Bethesda isn't adding items to the store that aren't limited time items.  They are doing both - they are adding new, permanent items and they are also marketing limited time items.  Why does having one preclude them from having the other?  
---
And obviously there are thing speople what, why else would the OP be complaining about the limited items. They want the item, but they wanted to "earn" the atoms rather than open their wallet.  It sounds like they weren't going to spend the money anyways.  On the other hand, there are likely people who saw "limited" and bought the item because of FOMO. 
---
Based on player feedback, if Bethesda really wanted to improve sales in the atom shop the best bet would be to give out more Atoms per dollar (e.g. instead of $1 = 100 atoms its  $1 = 1000 atoms. ) This would increase the perceived value of the items in the game and players would be more willing to spend the money - on permanent or limited items. 
---
Nothing needs to be done to cater to the those who only want to earn atoms.
---
I would make sure no one changed the controls on you. If you confirm that your hitting the button assigned to vats, try doing a full restart of your system
---
Just fought a one star Legendary Sheepsquatch at Welch. Absolutely stoked got a one star legendary cultist blade, his skull a strange quill and some strange hair and his horns.
---
I think the event is called "Free Range"
---
Cannot unsee how tiny those helmets are.
---
ikr the fact that this hasnt existed since launch is shocking to me...
---
is there another new event or just the encryptid? i’ve clearly missed something, only heard about the real sheepsquatch maybe an hour ago
---
Almost forgot about this.
---
Yep that was always a pain in the ass so i just said f it i always have shit to sell and ammo i dont use might as well buy all the repair kits and ammo i need that have
---
You just need a police uniform?
---
Message me. With your PS name.
---
Asides from assorted glowing critters that sometimes drop nuclear waste, there are other sources: 
---
Two of the board games can be scrapped for nuclear waste (their names give it away) - I'm not sure about Catch the Commie. 
---
The blue frogs you can find in the Forest drop uranium ore which can be smelted into nuclear waste. I'm assuming these same amphibians can be encountered elsewhere on the map. 
---
Canisters of it can be found at the power plants in addition to uranium ore veins at these same locations. 
---
Hospitals sometimes have canisters of nuclear waste. The same applies to the Nuka-Cola plants, at least the one on the west side of the map can have a few.
---
I'm so sorry
---
for immersiveness, i would use wood armor for the look and concept to fit my roleplay, but not necessarily for its function.   i would wear nothing but wood armor if i could build it.  can't find the plans.  anyone find crafting plans for wood armor yet?
---
I've never gotten drips based on my perks.
---
Always random.
---
I'll try checking the controls that's the only thing I havent checked but I've restarted it multiple times and I first had the problem before the patch and then had it after too and still yesterday and today
---
Or, I don't know, some brotherhood items???
---
Hes right farm the event when you can for the 20 caps at minimum from it for low levels
---
Anyone think Laps of Watoga after mayor for a day is good XP? No legendaries but might be a solid XP grind and it’s never busy anymore.
---
Another video here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhb1bu/looking\_for\_a\_megasloth\_i\_found\_the\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhb1bu/looking_for_a_megasloth_i_found_the_real/)
---
I'll probably be hitting you up in you're on this evening.  I could use an Electrically Charged serum for my melee character.  Fairly certain my IGN is the same as here.
---
got a sheepsquatch club plan
---
Been doing those nearly every day on my main character and he still never found himself a White Russian.
---
Check out this:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food) . It has all the recipes and you can figure out what stacks and what doesn't. A LOT of stuff stacks to give special stat bonuses, HP regen, etc. I'll be stocking up on the various Scorchbeast stuff and any str / carry weight boosters for sure.
---
OH DArn i wan t that bunny head
---
I got a raw video of my encounter, hopefully documented anything we may want to know. (For science!)
---
https://youtu.be/f7NAsg3XDys
---
Aside from that cursed image, good idea. Would def enjoy the pack mule PA look.
---
Sounds like a photo pose.
---
Couldn't agree more. They did it with "Cram" for the Cramburger, so why not :D Also certain foods, like fox jerky, shouldn't spoil.
---
:o I mean a lanterns ok... the syringe scares me most and I don't usually get scared.
---
No thank you. I already have a job, I don't want to have another one that I need to log in every day even if I had no interest in playing that particular day, and missing out because of things like a vacation.
---
It doesn't really benefit the player anyways, it's just a way for the company to say "We have X amount of active players daily" as they get to count you logging in for your daily reward as being an active player.  It just pads their numbers.
---
Oh, the memories.  I felt like a God with my TSE gatling with prime receiver.
---
This sh*t really freaks out(
---
Not just a regular police uniform like you can find next to the Dam on the cop car but a Responders police uniform
---
O give it a run myself as well. I was actually just thinking about that after I posted it. There is that crash space station mark off to that I keep haunting every day lol. All of my friends now have space suits though so there's always that
---
Haha, I'd take either one.
---
I will be offline between 6-9pm CDT, but on before and after that. See you this evening.
---
My bad for not doing a thorough job before posting. I upvoted it :)
---
I personally really dislike the idea of feeling like I have to log in to a game every day. I may be the odd one out here. I want to play when I want to play. Let me take time off of the game so I don't get burned out, and I'll come back when I'm ready.
---
Cant wait for the video
---
I got this raw footage, hopefully recorded everything we'll need to see
---
How many action points do you have when it's full? Next to your level on the stats tab in pipboy. Maybe you have diseases or some withdrawal causing your max ap to be lower than what is needed for vats
---
I'll look for your friend request around 5pm CDT then. See you soon.
---
nice, thanks :)
---
oh just me and many many other people, including most major youtubers, but hey, what do we know?
---
They let you buy them in bulk at the end , idk if they’re still there
---
nope
---
Then what are you still doing here?
---
WAIT WHAT??!! How did I not know this?!
---
It could be done via an alternate recipe. Player selects the one to use. So each ultracite ammo gets two recipes, one using the standard steel, lead, whatever, and the other substitutes those ingredients for the actual base ammo. Player picks the one that works best for the materials they have to either make new ammo or upgrade existing ammo to ultracite.
---
Apparently the recipe for the meat is a possible drop of the 'Free Range' event.
---
The Enforcer perk adds a 15% chance to stagger on shotguns, and is applied per pellet so is effectively 100% chance.  Also has cripple chance, but I've never seen the Imposter Sheepsquatch actually crippled so it may be immune.
---
[](/kcelestiasly)Listen, listen, I'mma level with you. I want to carry **WAY** more guns, all the guns. I have calibrated shocks on my excavator, and almost every reduced carry weight perk, and I'm still pushing overencomberment. I still need just a few more guns. Just a couple. 70 more pounds tops **TOPS**. Then we can talk about melee weapons.
---
“Hate, hate, hate, hate. Welcome to the playa haters ball ya’ll” -Juicehead on most of his videos
---
You need the recipe, apparently, which should be a drop from the 'Free Range' event.
---
This. In Fallout, McCarthyisim never faded, it only grew stronger. Considering how close the real world got to nuclear annihilation several times over, it's no shock that eventually an actual nuclear attack happened eventually. At least twice, faulty Soviet equipment gave false warning about incoming missiles. In both cases, "retaliation"was stopped by the person who would physically hit the button, on at least one case disobeying direct orders to launch from their superiors.
---
Based on how Alaska went, I am guessing that either 1) America was close enough to winning that China enacted a first strike policy, or 2) Someone got elected/promoted on one side or another based on their extreme support of their ideology and decided it was better to kill everyone then let the commie/capitalist scum live
---
all i really want anymore is camp invulnerability
---
i wish i had the luck of doing it so comfortably, i was completely over encumbered and with the wrong perks equipped :(
---
Amazing!! Thanks for all the info, it's time to go hunting!
---
Creekside grove is a random spawn location, a random set of spawns inside the grove that gets attacked by a random set from outside.  it's a great location for completing some Daily's like killing a mega sloth in the bog.
---
Plz use search:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgu5y8/psa_you_most_likely_dont_have_to_sever_hop_to_get

PC mod
---
I went through quite a few stimpaks lol
---
We don't know that either
---
I've tried that with Rad-X and they don't stack radiation resistances. Only the most recently applied Rad-X works, unless there's a trick to it I've yet to hear about, which is a strong possibility.
---
it's not obtainable anymore, maybe next Easter
---
Yeah. I never liked Maxon. A shame that a scorch beast didn't eat him.
---
I can understand being upset about it if it bothers you for some reason but I don't see why people have to go and be dicks about it :/ I guess the lack of ways to communicate in the games doesn't help either
---
PC mod "Sorting icon tags"
---
I don't believe any of them can. The closest thing is the repair kit and even it is different than the version in game
---
Stealth, Rifleman/Unarmed/Heavy Weapons here, All Deep Pocketed Weight Reduction Armor, base Carry weight of 315, and I leave CAMP at around 210 very well armed, but...
---
When I get into my T-60 with Calibrated Shocks I am almost always encumbered (PA negates my weapons weight reduction armor), so I slog around in the blast zones, then get back outside to exit my PA and I'm good to go again.
---
Wait so is he in the game right now?
---
which is very nice, the game needs more hard enemies imo, let's see what the future holds for us :D
---
I didn't think it'd be so handsome.
---
Everyone leaves out the L, lol.
---
TEKNIKL
---
😛
---
Youtubers. Come on. What are the numbers? Spoil rates then and now.
---
Is this a real thing that's in the works?
---
Honestly that all sounds pretty good. As long as there’s a variety of options
---
As many have said, once you claim a workshop, you're automatically in PvP...when you click claim, a box pops up and tells you that.  The only workshops I'll claim are the power plants for fusion cores.  All of the other materials can be farmed quickly enough, and you'll get more of it through farming.  If you really do wan to claim workshops, hop servers until you find one with very few people and/or lower level people, that's what I do when I take over the power stations.  And craft a work bench and stash box...keep putting everything in your stash so that if someone does come along, you don't drop anything.
---
I havee been tracking down extra copies of the games to do just that. Once player vending hits I will be stocking the machine with extra tapes.
---
Absolutely!!!
---
I've changed enough tires to know that it would be the last thing I'd be lugging around the wasteland lol. They're probably heavier than a fatman
---
Ive gone many weeks backpacking. 6, 7, 18, and 19 seem the only ones that wont make your arms go numb and hurt your back, while still looking realistic for backpacking. I like to keep my character’s comfort in mind.
---
The repair kits came in handy for me during the SBQ fight.
---
&gt;I think it was a byproduct of just reading forums and discords shitting on the game so I mirrored that mentality even though I was attempting to remain objective. I was seeing less of the positives in the game because I wasn't pay as close attention to them (even if there were a lot of negatives, it wasn't all negative).
---
I'm pretty sure you just described an echo chamber, but yeah, being aware of that is the first step to regaining objectivity. 
---
Also, thank you for all your hard work putting out all the update videos, I do enjoy them and look forward to them.
---
At least you wanted the aviator paint job, I accidentally bought it when it was still super expensive. Anyways is the glitched texture stay that way after you log back in? I haven't had any problems with mine, but that could just be that it stays in my stash until i absolutely need to kill something in one shot.
---
I mostly want vending haha :)
---
I run a sneak unarmed build with full vanguard gear build. I find what makes melee so much more viable is blocker and adrenaline. With a non bloody gauntlet and the right mutations I can kill two enemies and do 550 per hit with full health and  keep 500 energy and damage resist. The only thing I can't kill in one sneak attack hit is 90+ deathclaws, and deathskull scorpions. I keep guns on my for fun, but honestly they're just for flavor until something runs up on me
---
Aaand it's god damn 1080p top left corner of a 1440p panel...
---
That’s where my camp is haha yay
---
Yeah I f%#^*d one up today. Had a bit of help from a Super Mutant but he ended up getting in the way so I had to smack him too.
---
Technical Data is the only place I am aware
---
free range event could also happen near tanagra town
---
I think they are useful too. Have an upvote.
---
Their pelt has ballistic fiber.
---
[](/celestiasup)Does camp invulnerability affect pets? I've been putting off getting one since I hear they get slaughtered pretty often.
---
Go to the parking lot of the water park up north, server hop.  The car dead-center will either have a corpse hanging off of the left side or it won't.  When it does, it has the holotape, note and camera.
---
This tough bastard just helped me level up to 49.  Power Armor stood strong the whole time, but it took a hot minute to take him down, and I have to replenish a LOT of ammo.
---
You get one with the scouts questline
---
Kinda bummed that you can't even cook the meat for a base level consumable, then have a couple higher level recipes.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Agreed man, those RDR rewards are a perfect example to give 👍🏻
---
Just saw it! Totally unexpected! (Does that mean possible sidequests added without notice? Trophy hunting I mean)
---
The Poseidon plant has consistently spawned a level 10 hazmat suit in the trailer on the roof close-ish to the railroad track bridge atop the eastern building. There are higher level hazmat suits in-game, but that location has been reliable for me.
---
Loved everything but the fact that power armor users can wear a backpack on with power armor. Why give power armor users more of a buff. Which not to mention how would we wear that inside the armor itself. I feel like the backpack should only be usable for people who don’t use power armor. Give people who don’t like power armor or don’t want to use it a reason to walk around without it. The fact that you are trying to give DR and other utility to the backpack is great but should not apply for power armor users. Us nakey guys want to feel great too.
---
Yes, grab some repair kits in the Atom Shop as well. See ya around in the wasteland.
---
Latest into the vault says it's delayed until patch 14 and it won't be killable but it will be pregnant. There will be an event where you have to help deliver the litter then protect the den from predators and other players. Survival mode only.
---
Sheepsquatch staff
---
Please pay me for playing the game!
---
1/3? \*Laughs in over-encumbered hoarder\* \*cries\*
---
Nope. Tried that, TNT dome, alien in the truck bed, toy aliens, even the monster in lucky hole mine.
---
They need to make the Cryptid Hunters a new faction -w- more quests. The cryptids are some of the most fun content in the game.
---
I thought it was implied they fixed the test? They definitely lost, but only just.
---
I’ll start doing this more. Of the things I listed, this is the one I’ve done the least. Maybe a handful of times a week.
---
Wonder if this is linked to the prestige system?
---
The spoilage rate of food had gone up and down like the tide over the course of these patches. There was a time where food almost never went bad before you would eat it.
---
Through purposeful alteration or accident the spoilage rate has absolutely changed over time.
---
What platform are you on? If Xbox i have an extra id sell for 500 caps
---
People usually drop legendarys in the ice chest too.
---
My game crashed soon as I walked up to it and claim my rewards 😔
---
It is coincidence. My pistol character got so many damn amazing rifles that I decided to switch over. I also get tons of good melee weapons.
---
Right, but I've got 6 plans for Greek Letters
---
You got downvoted but backpack skins coded for the atomic shop were in the game since launch.
---
Yeah they need actual gamemasters handling this stuff. It is one of the things that has me convinced the studio has little experience with online games.
---
Hoping to get the staff and the mod plans for it too, so far only got the electrified crook mod plan and the sheepsquatch shard plan.
---
I WANT TO BELIEVE
---
Damn, I really like this.
---
I hope they keep all this functionality and all these updates to apply to the next game in the series.
---
It'd be a shame if all these nice things like C.A.M.P., backpacks, etc were left in FO76.
---
Cool I sent you a PM with my PSN.
---
If the cap limit increase than he value of my BoS sent assassin set is going to become 2x of what the max is. Just saying I’m instantly going to break the market, because everyone wants these sets and they sell their junk weapons to players to make caps to buy this from me. Now they’ll need to either sell more junk weapons to players or increase the price they sell them to player, the latter being the likely option,, thus breaking the market. 2star shit weapons will then cost 5k, 3 star AAE handmades going to 25k now will go for 50k tomorrow, BOS sent assassin thats around 50-75k will be easily twice that. Don’t say that’s ridiculous because I sell for these prices daily with no problem, make a new account on Xbox bring out 3 new vault dwellers and get them capped out. I have friends with 12 Xbox accounts with max caps on all five alts that’s 1.5mil in caps he has to play with and he admits he broke the market since Survival mode came out since he could sell at whatever price to desperate people wanting in on that PvP action.
---
I’m on Xbox. GT is the same as my screen name. Ill definitely take you up on that offer! I won’t be on for another 2 or 3 hours.
---
You can also get it from a rare random event spawn as well, but I've only seen it once in 360 hours. It's where I got it and the welding mask.
---
Was in the cranberry bog, outside of the antique shop somewhere.
---
Seriously?  Is there nothing team can do to let people choose between the two?  Gear that already has a backpack equipped should come with a cosmetic mod at the armor bench that lets you remove it or something.  I had to farm events for a month straight just for the 0.02% chance at my Traveling Leather Coat and now if I keep wearing it I'm losing out on cosmetic options.
---
I did scrap yet
---
3 full mule characters ready to go. Yes, I'm going to provably break it. All I want is 1 tse handmade 10% while aiming or 90% reduced weight.
---

Im disappointed they mentioned making burrows not rad proof for nukes. I wish power armor was more special use and expensive. It’s like everyone has a shiny sportscar.
---
More love for non PA!
---
I'm just wondering what kind of backpack is going to go well with my white tuxedo. 🤔
---
&gt;just wanted to know if there's a way i can fix this
---
Spend some caps, so you can get more.
---
In addition to what's stated below;
---
Character limits vary by platform, on Xbox you can have 5 per account, to the best of my knowledge there is no limit to how many accounts you can have, one account is designated as the main, and all others are sub (Family) accounts so it only requires one XBL Gold account, (I currently have 7 but only use 3 for FO76), also if you run multiple Consoles you will need a game license for each one.
---
I was mistaken, when I looked at my challenges earlier SFE was outdated (I also had no sound). I think a mod was screwing with the list because my weekly and daily challenges were the same. I'm back to having the cryptic challenge now that everything is updated.
---
I'm not here to trying be a Bethesda defender, but I honestly think the 76 team is just understaffed and overworked trying to appease both players' want/needs and Zenimax wanting to see more money out of their investment into the game. It's probably not an ideal situation but they do need to do more than issue 2 line apologies. At the end I choose not to draw a definitive conclusion about the Dev's intentions because I don't know what they want to do compared to what their parent company allows them or tells them to do.
---
That would either result in free atoms or no disconnects... either of these I'm fine with.
---
That a FE .50Cal?
---
Literally would love to see NV's ammo system period. I really liked how they were able to strike a balance between the arcade nature of Fallout with the realistic nature of different types of bullets.
---
Yes they did
---
Last Action Hero
---
3 new issues i noticed on xb1 (possibly introduced in p8.5 im not sure, been awhile since i last played)
---
1. Clicking play on the main menu and joining a server now causes a large screen hitch/freeze, its nothing major bc game still loads fine but its still really annoying and lasts for like 10-15 secs from what i noticed...
---
2. Game now unfortunately hitches when swapping recent weapons via dpad left and its very common (for me atleast) and very annoying...
---
3. Also regarding left dpad, swapping recent weapons now bugs out and will occasionally swap to a previously used weapon...(cant confirm 100% but it seems its related to your fists, example: i use gatling gun and fat man as my 2 recent weapons, then i unequip 1 to use my fists, then try to swap between fists and gatling gun and it will occasionally equip my fat man again but then back to my fists then gatling gun etc, coupled with the hitching issue its so god damn annoying...also im in power armor, idk if that matters...)
---
&gt; Fallout is all about individuals making geeky calculations on gear combinations and perk combinations to maximize
---
That is just a small part of the Fallout player base. A vocal nerd circle, that is. 
---
Most customers of this company are casuals, who just want to explore new places, to build stuff in peace, to randomly fight some mobs here and there… and of course, they don't use internet to max/min everything and to follow the game evolution everyday.
---
I've been hoarding legendaries for when the legendary vendor comes along. I just hope its worth holding on to all this crap for so long lol
---
no i mean can i somehow return the 15k i had before i sold something for 25k ?
---
Is this the same as the 'Engineer Outfit'?

Shhhh, let those PVE only workshop players carry more scrap. I am starting to get low.

I feel like this best sums up trying to buy mods without google handy.

Just got glasscovered crook
---
I doubt that the legendary vendors will give the amount of caps that people now are asking .

I like to play the game and don't give a lot about c(r)aps. 
---
Sad to see that Apalachia is become wall Street of the Wastelands ....  
---
The wolf in sheep's clothing  is lurking behind Whitespring corner  , maybe a next quest line 🤣🤣
---
What do you buy with you're caps ? More junk to gain more caps .

Who makes up the rules ? There is only chaos in the Wasteland.... 
---
To cap or not to cap ....

 I'm not a 'cap'italist

Shard is the one im missing that i want

The only condition for the quest is an NPC with the AilenRace tag. So nothing that isn't an NPC will work.

we riot when they dont have it when the backpacks release.
---
Sure, mines same also just message me when your on
---
What did you sell that was worth 25k?
---
Funny thing is, it is actually more expensive to craft than the regular one.  Was planning on putting the skin on my quad or something, but nope...can't do that.  Now they have just released an alternative more expensive recipe for a reskin of a weapon that can't be legendary.  Which is made worse by the fact that it is a weapon that people rarely use in the first place and the reskin will likely have the same novelty of the ping pong paddle in that it is just not worth using other than to just mess around.
---
Now, is that tire+rim, ode just the rubber you’re talking about?
---
There is a BoS convoy random spawn, but I have not seen it on the spawn
---
I think the Watoga legendary thing is an intentional stealth nerf, not a bug. I saw a comment from Eckserah the other day where he found that they changed a keyword on the Watoga bots to make them never spawn as legendary.
---
What about letting us remove the outfit backpack at an armorer's workbench? The Union Uniform is my favorite outfit in the game, but I still really want to try out one of the new backpacks!
---
Nothing wrong with the Herd Mentality mutation, as long as you group often...
---
*has messy hair and holds hands about a foot apart*
---
Aliens...
---
I am pretty sure I have an alt on Xbox that has it. I can login and you can have mine from him. 
---
I will be on about 430 ET. I'll msg you at MattTheFlash
---
True, some peeps would love to send through a flaming bag of scorchbeast poo for the lulz.  If you did not recently forget to pick up your dead doggy bag then you don't need to pick up or even look in the Lost &amp; Found box, just let stuff expire.
---
You do have a point, it is a basic mail system for parcels only under certain conditions, which may be a good place for Bethesda to start an actual Mail System.....hint hint
---
Some can, but some cannot.
---
I'm on Xbox, I'd give ya one for free but I won't be home until later tonight.
---
What is that? A radtoad?
---
Cough cough white springs cough cough
---
In the very small instance where your weapon breaks during combat. You could also just switch to your offhand which will be much faster
---
yeah i would love an X-01 PA with enclave paint
---
[https://www.falloutbuilds.com/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/)
---
That’s the one.
---
What platform are you on? Are you looking for any marine armour pieces? As I have some spare bits if you need them (Xbox)
---
Mine’s at 5 because I like Dromeday, but yeah it’s a pretty pathetic stat perk wise.
---
We need spore plants just to see how terrifying they could be. In fallout 2 they were actually pretty tame, especially the talking one in Broken Hills. FNV made them pretty creepy but they only appeared in like 3 areas of the game. Now we need some HD remakes on the newest engine for maximum creepiness
---
Mm hm
---
Arsenal? Gatling Guns? Keep talking…
---
Actual question, not shade: has the blackbird PA paint come back after the intital offering?  I got it back at the first time, and can’t remember if it’s been offered again.
---
Looking to buy Grounded, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Talons, and Twisted Muscles.
---
IGN: AtreiK
---
That may have been it. I got both from a dead BOS engineer next to a cart, or something.
---
Yeah only a few cars, you wouldn't miss him if he spawned
---
Awesome :)
---
you can get the plans it's how i got body plans for the T-series Power armors, they are quite a rare drop so it does take some farming
---
It's a great juice head ad.
---
Hey, I also found a group of 3 ravaged Brahmin between Ft Defiance &amp; Watoga on a creekbank island thingy, they had quills in them and there was this god awful screeching noise not too far off so yeah, linking the 'kills' to a Sheepsquatch.
---
The bigger problem in setting a limit on caps is that it creates an arbitrary value for them in relation to items. If there was no limit on caps, I believe it would likely stimulate the trading between players, and eliminate the annoying "trade only". It is annoying when the person doing it just collects items to sell IRL.
---
I have a ton of fun just exploring around. That being said, I usually follow the main quests and explore all the areas as I journey from one objective to the next. Make sure to do events in the forest (starting) region because those tend to be easier and great for cup, items, and such.
---
Yeah I’ve only ever seen one thing on the atom store I really wanted, the military officers uniform. I was trying my hardest to get enough atoms. I finally got enough an hour after it disappeared from the shop. I understand the frustration, it sucks
---
Do events as they pop up. follow the main questline, and hit every location you see on the HUD along the way... and kill everything.
---
I haven’t heard any confirmation but I would assume so
---
I’m by far no expert modder, but from my experience the mesh is most likely one solid object. So they would either need to redo the backpack and clothing from scratch, or go in and hand remove them from each other, and then ensure there’s no clipping after. They would also need to do this for the textures. There’s also a good chance that there’s no shirt behind the backpacks, so they would need to attempt to seamlessly add texture there.
---
I met one rude guy who acted new so I made him stuff, then he said that it was his 3rd character and then dipped out.
---
I think the idea is they'd rather avoid making a system too confusing for casuals. You're right that it can be done and there are options out there, I just don't think the dev team will bother unless a big stink is raised
---
Yes please I want to fishing.
---
I'm not on now I had to get off I'll look but I no I didnt have any diseases or anything
---
They're just "Modern Couches". Gives 4 variants (blanket/dirty) of the same red couch.
---
I don't like the idea. Its like they are trying to make you play the game to get rewards. Events are cool but i wish they had let us know about the easter eggs ahead of time. I didn't get but three because I didn't log in until it was half over.
---
so it just happened? and all i got are those lousy eggs?!
---
It's really not that simple. We need the option to buy things and it be affordable. If we don’t but things we’ll get quality of life and even pay to win purchases. When your gun breaks constantly and you’re forced to spend a lot more time scrapping and hunting then tell me it don’t buy it. It’s as simple as that. Right now it’s not bad. But we’ll see after they’ve made their money off game sales and take note from EA and Bungie. When their fans fucking hate them but still play and complain all day. Like they give a shit they’re raking in the bacon. 
---
So, no, it’s not “as simple as that” this is a very multi-faceted issue.
---
Yes, it's possible to do so. 
---
But when you're in a nuked whitespring, in the SBQ, or now in the Burrows, ennemies are ON YOU. Not at a few meters, they are on you, immediately, all the time. In those case, using a shotgun, a handmade or a pistols makes no difference : you take damages and you need ammos to make less damages than the guy next to you who's hitting them with a few claws taped together.
---
Not to mention that you'll probably miss a few shots now and then because VATS sucks dinosaur balls and ennemies tend to telep, whereas melee is quite always ok.  Ho, and you have to reload, even when using that sweet quad combat shotgun.  
---
So, yeah, melee is way stronger than range, and pretending it's because you take more risks is just a plain lie.
---
i don't think we have access to the full map yet so it could be that the lake gets some content when the map opens up
---
It could be a withdrawal effect. Iirc they aren't listed in the pipboy so I always just pop an adictol once in a while to make sure I'm good
---
Worked for me today. Try restarting the game? Sometimes the content gets a little messed up if the game updates while you’re playing or if you don’t exit the game completely.
---
Hey, Be a part of the problem if you want, that's 100% your choice
---
It could have something to do with me adding the lens, but I’m not sure
---
They probably will, just don’t expect it for a while.
---
Back in Ultima Online we died, came back to our almost empty corpse. Left only was our clothing that was cut into bandages as a nice mocking gesture. In Wurm Online the same. You lose all your shit when you die. Absolutely everything stays on your corpse. 
---
This here? That's nothing. The only little thing you lose is a little bit of useless shit that can be regained with almost no effort at all. If you die and lose a stockpile of ballistic fibre or screws it's your own fault for carrying the important shit around. The whole landscape is littered with red rockets and train stations where you can stash your shit safely on a regular basis.
---
Nothing else is lost. Your expensive weapons? Safe. Your metric fuckton of ammo? Completely safe. Your stockpile of chems and stimpacks and food? Apart from the pvp server, where you know what you sign up for... you got it, nothing's gone. 
---
I suck ass at this type of game. I've died more often than I dare to admit. I've never lost a single piece of junk (reached level 55 after like two months of playing). Be more careful and thoughtful and stop carrying around so much important shit.
---
actually sold it for 30k. it was an AAE harpoon gun
---
TSE 3-star anything is not super common. What rock do you live under?
---
Found him during the free range event (or open range? You escort the cows) in the Mire. Lvl 80 Legendary 1*.
---
This is it for AlienRace NPC's, the ones with NPC by their names [https://imgur.com/J3DMJ4D](https://imgur.com/J3DMJ4D)
---
The Sheepsquatch challenge has some weirdness in it. For example, the base challenge is looking for an NPC with the race "SheepsquatchRace" but only if it doesn't have "ActorTypeMothman". Some of the challenges seem really janky and rushed, but that challenge works so I'm not going down that rabbit hole.
---
If you got all 6 eggs, you can make the bunny head at the armor station.
---
So join a group, equip and share lone wanderer?
---
Holy Sh*t he exist. We all know what to do now
---
Works on broadsider, harpoon gun too.
---
Typically an event in the mire. The shepherd tool can be looted from a nearby robot.
---
I know this is farfetch and probably  not going to happen but I hope there a mod in it to help reduce the weight of weapon or explosion so I can stop using the perk.
---
How dare you try to impose tyrant-regulated clothing onto the free-staters?
---
wha?
---
Nowhere near a definitive list but I got all 3 of my pets by farming these random encounter spots.
---
At that level, you either have to grind a LOT of low level enemies or get slightly out of your comfort zone and start pushing to the north and east side of the map. So, realistically grind like a madman or get out there. Enjoy yourself either way. 🤘👍
---
Non power armour has better carry weight alreadybbecayse of unyeilding +1 str weapon weight effects, deep pocketed and not having to carry power armour around. It kinda does need it. I can only fast travel if im not in power armour rn (435 max carry out of, 385 in)
---
not really. Most of this server dickrides BGS
---
Are you on PS4?
---
The crook is a new weapon entirely, craftable from 10 to 50. At level 50 deals 101 damage with a slow swing speed (Unmodded and Without Perks).
---
You can find these much cheaper on the bazaar, people. Bought pretty much every single serum at 150 each
---
There's the enclave plasma rifle
---
Which will never be used because it doesn't drop as a legendary form and can only be bought from the enclave vendor, with a different (and more limited) mod pool than the regular plasma rifle
---
It's a repeatable event in a low level area. They can't spawn level 50 enemies in an area where the average player will be level 20
---
But it’s not weekend ? It’s active EST?
---
Nope. Coincidence. Drops are random.
---
The Repair Kit babies literally can’t stop shitting their diapers at this point, everything Bethesda announces is immediately accused of being in the Atomic Shop
---
With the game including so many cryptids, I thought the main quest would be all about them.
---
Agreed I want this
---
If the other person doesn't have the responder one, let me know and you can have mine :\]
---
Fun fact, the staff he's looking at isn't even bloodied. The damage would be well over 1000 if it was (I assume legendary variations can drop from sheepsquatches)
---
Oh boy, too much to list. All I'm saying picking up berries makes me slow down to a snail pace.
---
Then quit.
---
The emote it called "Bye Now", it's not saying "Buy Now".
---
To the guy who recommended 5.56 as currency. You da real MVP. What they should do is make Ammo worth money to Vendors so that opens up Ammo as being a legit 100% form of currency! 25k could be too low I agree. That’s 17 Vendor Maxes.
---
Wait so sheepsquatch is a roaming AI like mothman?????? That you can run into and kill?
---
Will it also be possible to hide the backpack optics without PA?
---
No, its gone forever. The only thing you could have done was move it to a second character
---
No I'm on xbox unfortunately :(
---
Exactly! Friend an i were just talking about how the PA users can double dip with excavator and the backpack upgrades too. I agree they need to make NonPA viable.
---
Facepalm.
---
Repost it a million times!!! 😜
---
TSE Handmades do not go for 25k. More like 6k for a max level 3 star. The only think that pulls even 10k is stuff like 3 star Gausses.
---
Bumblefucked into this event at Aaronholdt Farms in the north-eastern part of the forest.
---
What’s up?
---
Bullistic Fiber? You can never have to much of that!
---
I've heard it can spawn in the Mire, I've had it twice at BBQ. Once was a level 80 Legendary Noxious Sheepsquatch, other was two level 80's and one Legendary. Hunting that plan!
---
The nuke wasteland expansion is rumored to expand enclave stuff.
---
Worked for me as well. I would suggest you restart the game.
---
On consoles, rarely you can find them that cheap (maybe 200-250), but not on PC. Also, since you can sell serums to vendors for 500 caps each now, the prices for serums have been going up. Also, recipes no longer drop from the queen and can only be purchased from the vendor for 17,500 caps (at 25 CHA). 400 caps is pretty much the going rate for serums on PC nowadays. Of course, if you want to negotiate on price, I might consider it.
---
What was the reward?
---
Ah. Sorry. I just found it after server hopping for awhile in Wavy Willard's parking lot. I just stayed there and changed servers. Didn't travel elsewhere. Took me like 10 tries, but it's RNG as far as I know, so no telling how long it could potentially take if you're just looking at one spot. Good luck! Would invite you if I could!
---
Idk what to tell you if youre HONESTLY convinced that they NEED this money from microtransaction to keep the game running, and not because of any sort of greed...
---
did you not scroll through the feed before posting?  literally every other post today is about this...
---
Haven't seen it.  My guess is the cycle is a long one.  It might not be a year, it could totally be a year, but it's certainly going to be months before anything cycles back unless they're seasonal (Xmas) then expect a year.  Some games have featured 'vaulted' items and remove a few at a time to sell again before locking then back up. Some games have a yearly event where you can buy the things you've missed out on previously.  Some games just put everything on a timer and put them back in the market every X amount of days.
---
I would have to disagree. Why should PA users get another buff to their kit while us NonPA users are still left in the dust :( backpack should not be wearable in PA considering they have excavator armor already. Maybe make it so the PA could craft the upgrades in them but they should not be able to get the DR buff or even more of a weight increase.
---
to express sarcasm online most have taken to using /s
---
Is the nuka cola “ jet pack “ considered a backpack?
---
Thanks.  That sight has some poor search features.
---
No way to sort weapon type, pvp, pve, exclude builds like bloodied.
---
Do you know of a good 2h pve solo generalist build?  Perhaps one that uses Combat shotgun as ranged?
---
Yeah; it spawns around the world and in the 'Free Range' event (as far as I know, at least!).
---
There looks to be different curves for different levels, so yeah, weight limit changes. I'm also seeing things like armor plated and everything from low capacity to very high capacity. Looks like there will be a good amount of customization.
---
Nah son
---
Go to Wavy Willards and keep server hopping till the dead body of Ansel or Anne appears.
---
I created a list of my legendaries

---
Crook and Mutton so far, really hunting that staff
---
Just got "Glass Covered" plan for the crook.
---
No. Hmm lets wait until the vendoring drops.
---
Furthermore, the game would need something to dump caps on. There isn't much. The number of caps in the game just continues to grow.
---
&gt;Anyone who frequently trades knows many items exceed the 25k price when on the market
---
No, they exceed cap limit. They will continue to exceed cap limit.
---
Yes, yes but we need to know....
---
Whatcha get??
---
I'm aware It’s some of both. But I don’t know how much of each it is. But if you think Bethesda made as much off this game as they hoped well IDK what to tell you.
---
if you got all 6 you can craft bunny head at armor workbench
---
4,999 caps
---
There are huge areas in this game that I've had very little reason to ever visit.  Giant missed opportunity.
---
Same here, just got a glass covered plan for the crook, but wanting that staff and the mods that go with it.
---
Like others have said, this is not the case. A few weeks ago there was a post regarding legendary drop types/frequencies and what was in your stash. 
---
The effort and data seemed sound, but after this week, Im not so sure.
---
I had 4 TS drops in 4 days... 3 TS Handmades + 1 TS Gauss. I have no rifles or two shot anything in my stash... so who knows 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
nuka cola jet pack?
---
That is disappointing.
---
I would suggest you go with shotgun ammo instead. It's more rare and more valuable.
---
On PC for long they were equal 1 cap. But now 5.56 is going under and rarely traded for 1c.
---
It's this week's reward for the survival challenges.
---
Guess you could always grind for the regular leather coat :-/
---
You have to be a higher level in order to be able to use higher level weapons. I bait them out and jump on a ledge and knock em down with my nice handmade.
---
&gt;What, they can only buy 15k instead of all of it?
---
They can buy it all. It's not their business some of the bottlecaps will fall off.
---
Sometimes I just got hunting animals in the game. I sneak up and try to get that perfect shot and blow up that opossum.
---
Thanks! I'll need it
---
Yeah I initially started in wavy willard's but after two or three hours of horrible luck I decided to check out the other locations. Still nothing...
---
Guess I'll just go back to server hopping lol
---
So if I read this correctly, some random code in the game had caused an item to drop during fast travel and was not because of something you did, and then since you immediately realised it was gone, got lucky and dropped a bag right in the correct area to find it and pick it back up.
---
This is a hell of a bug.  :(  a quick fix might be to prevent players from dropping favorite items without an additional warning dialogue (just like they now do with scrapping favorites) to at least put a bandaid over the issue.
---
One day....hopefully
---
Yes !  this  ↑ ↑ ↑
---
I’m pretty interested in this. Sign me up.
---
And in Fallout: New Vegas.....
---
And in Fallout 3.....
---
I assume a lot of the empty spaces in the game are for player CAMPs. After all, 24 other people are playing with you and need spots too.
---
Done the same thing a bunch of times... I've never experienced this glitch. And it's happened to you twice? 
---
I'd try to recreate it and make a video. Send that into Bethesda with your ticket.
---
Furious Prime FFR, Vampires, TSE, Bloodied Troubleshooters, AA etc. . . I loves me Gatling Guns.
---
Im not even gonna try it out. Sounds lame and I don't take pictures anyway. Not my cup of tea
---
And that would be a problem for anybody...why? 
---
Giving you the benefit of the doubt on whether you meant that be a trollish statement or not. I'm guessing that, just like PA, weapons, armor, etc., it will indeed have skins in the atomic shop. I certainly hope so anyway,  I'd have to have a bright yellow backpack on with my full woodland cammo combat armor!
---
Do you mind if I add these pictures to the main post?
---
I would do it if I had enough caps to give away but I’m really poor. I’ll see if I could find someone and contact you
---
Yea It really doesn’t bother me, it’s just part of the game. Guess that’s why they give you a movable camp that’s broken half the time lol
---
Wow! How did you sell it for 30k then, if you can't carry more than 25k?
---
They probably never made them. Hoping we forget.
---
I’m going hunting boyzzzzz
---
People preordered the fuck out of this game, it was arguably the most hyped release of 2018. Im not trying to deny that bethesda didnt make as much money off this game. I'm just saying that the atom shop and atom currency as a whole was absolutely planned before release and any sort of negative reviews or boycotting, and it was done to mirror games that make tons of money off of this system such as fortnite and overwatch. 
---
People tend to forget that all the shitty performance, bad coding and cash grabs happened BEFORE we found out the game was shit... it was delivered to us in this state, NOT changed to mitigate a bad release.
---
took 5k with the mule
---
I want an increased build budget for all my atom shop items.
---
Why is he doing the Naruto run?
---
Skins will definitely be in the Atomic Store. There's currently 8 vault-tec color variants in the game files. They don't have the ATX prefix, but I'm will to bet they're for the Atom Store.
---
We actually do - for the BOS.
---
Just killed one :) didn't know they were in the game lol
---
Why wouldn’t it just continue like the normal vendor/trade system now? You’re carrying 20k caps and you sell something for 10k, too bad, you get 5k and the other 5k disappears.
---
I've also done it and had it not happen, I actually thought they had fixed it before it happened again today. I'll def try to recreate it and see if I can record it.
---
Not trying to contradict because I'm on XBOX, but pretty sure things are mostly in the same place cross platform.  So this is just FYI.  I routinely collect around 70 cobalt from the Whitesprings area.  This can vary a bit with the nuke placement of course. I think there are three west across the road from the train station in  between the tracks and the road there on the corner. There are quite a few plants around both sides of the power plant East of the train station across the road all the way down to Southeastern entrance road just past the tractor trailer wreck where the ghouls are.  Don't forget the Gloam Soap on the trees give raw cobalt flux as well.  The Blue Bomb Berries all along there will sometimes give up a couple, but mostly can't be harvested for some reason.  Can't always harvest them when they are Firecracker Berries either. Anyway, Morganton is the best area for Cobalt flux in bulk
---
sure, i'll keep updating my post with new stuff
---
Help, looking for 2 X01 jet packs
---
FirstWiseGuy
---
Yes i would love this! My best friend Mothman is so chill took way to many photos with him xD
---
Who in their right mind would use vending machines if the caps "fall off"?
---
No, Ash Heap is a bad spot also. Especially on the cliff side right down the road from Welch and the train station. Mole Miners and super mutants that are around level 90 constantly show up in droves using weapons that I havn't seen in game yet. They are indestructable so there is no reason to go in that direction either.
---
That's a good idea I'll try that when I get on tonight I didnt think of that
---
Fishing would be amazing. Love to get a two headed fish and mount that sucker.
---
Don't you think that'll be an issue? At least the perks part?
---
With the right perks, you can have +45 max HP, 125 DR,  -65% incoming damage, +48% damage, +40% crit damage, and +60% AP regen.
---
This isn't even counting perks dependent on time of day or the huge bonuses from perks to almost every stat mentioned from high rads or low HP. There's also Mysterious Stranger, and SPECIAL can really help with damage, HP, AP, and crits.
---
Praise New Vegas
---
Two of my power armour pieces disappered too 🤔🤔
---
Sure they didn't fall victim to the horribly buggy, random resort after every frigging inventory action you make? Got scrapped/sold/dropped, and you didn't notice until after?
---
I had to do standing in the actually water.
---
&gt; the duplicating has been resolved
---
hmmm…  I am not sure about this.
---
I still see many scumbags selling the classic duped ítems in eBay, Ali, websites… AAEs, full sets of Assasin/Sentinel, serum plans, gold tier mele weapons…
---
They've just stopped to make public fun of Bethesda in YouTube, that is.
---
Dear tourist against a car wsterpark car park search body
---
My brahmin were Daisy, Dahlia and Nuka-Cowla. Love that the names are randomized.
---
The same happened to me around Christmas. I was fortunate enough to buy a second one from a vendor because it breaks too quickly and I didn!t have anything better back then. Only to find out a week later that I have only one hammer again for no reason.
---
Yup
---
Quite possibly, I don't know when or how though. I'm sad
---
I log all legendary items I get on a note on my phone, store them on some alts I have, random armor and weapons just get lost in the void often. Mostly chest pieces it seems, a few random weapons.
---
Serum's sell for 500c and are a fraction of the weight. 15 oil, 3 stabilized flux a day. And thats without super duper. 
---
Theyre just really not worth it to sell sometimes. Unless they have specific effects that make it desirable.
---
On a side note I will buy another if any PC player has a fasnacht beret they wish to sell
---
We need answers man! Lmao! What did you get..?
---

I'm really not a fan of how they roll out quests sometimes. I get encouraging exploration, but I wouldn't have even known some quests existed if I didn't check this sub. Putting out new content well after a lot of players have finished all the original quests stresses me out when I am never sure if there is anything new to do and if there is, where I can actually do it!
---
1) They exist, tamed one three days ago.
---
2) 100% of the tamable snallygasters I've found (grand total: 1) were at[the lake with the crashed vertibot](https://i.imgur.com/6V7qKhr.png) north of Abbie's Bunker. 
---
Word to the wise: due south of the lake there's a cave with a static spawn of two honeybeasts and snallygasters are brave and stupid. I started escorting mine home and it immediately Leeroy Jenkinsed its way past their cave and got itself killed. Be prepared to defend that moron all the way back to your camp.
---
They're safe in my stash, it's actively using them that exposes them to the risk
---
If you're on XB, I still have 6 spares.
---
OP: look! Cool thing!
---
Half the comments: Bethesda bad and something something atom shop even though no mention.
---
is this real i havent been on today
---
i cant play this game until the vendor is out .. my stach and my inventory are 90% legedarys ... i cant live with this anymore &gt;.&lt;
---
Friend request sent
---
Absolutely! glad I could help. Just be warned it took me a while to find the plans so if at first you don't see them, keep trying.
---
Yeah I know exactly where to look. Just not as lucky as others I guess.
---
Only item on hand I had dissapeared was my max level All Rise.  Poof gone, only noticed because it wasn't on my quick key wheel anymore.
---
&gt; I'm not saying do it exactly as RDR2 has done but they showed their players the appreciation of thrm sticking by it etc.
---
Yeah but like, Bethesda has actually updated their game.
---
Dead Braham
---
WHICH PLAN?!?!?!?
---
Oh shit
---
I got two recipes, the base one for grabbing the meat and one for a mutton pie or something from the event.
---
I learned to embrace my parasites. We live permanently together and are friends now.
---
Yes it is real lol
---
I consider that "training for the big fight" because everyone has the same chance to grind, surf the internet, and utilize knowledge to come with the best build. It doesn't cost caps, just time, and people who want it will do it.
---
We can't account for every single thing, just enough to level the playing field :D
---
I seen him and died. Yay!
---
Yes a recipe does drop and it's buff is +15% melee damage
---
I had assumed my pet would tp when i originally got a megasloth. So I immediately tp'd to my base. 
---
Havnt seen him since :(
---
I've reduced my play time significantly because my caps is full and my stash and mule are both filled to the brim with stuff that I can sell but can't. I've been leaving stuff at train stations and lunch boxes for others too. It's kind of annoying to have to deal with so many limitations that won't grow with player's characters.
---
Thanks, I'll try a complete restart of the launcher and game then.

I was out in white springs one day when I hear area chat from some guy who needed food was overweight and couldn’t find food. I walked up and left him about 5 ragstag steaks water and a few stimpaks. Nothing I didn’t have a ton of. Then he was so grateful he dropped me two stealthboys without me asking for anything. I love helping out people in the game. I know for fact that I have met more helpful people in my hours of playing than griefers. So much so that my 9 yr old now plays the game and is no longer addicted to that fortnite shit he played with that toxic player base
---
Oh really? I could of sworn I was standing in the middle of the lagoon in the shallow water.
---
Yeah, I guess that's true. How many are in so far?
---
You can cook the meat, mutton chops is added, no recipe needed. Gives +10% melee damage
---
Sweet. I've got my CAMP on a lead deposit near there. Can't wait to check out out. Is it by that rest area where the fog crawlers and the mega sloth spawn per chance?
---
It might just be a one time glitch that didn't recognize the boundaries correctly. Try server hopping and claim it again - it only takes 5 minutes to claim Charleston landfill from molerats. If it turns out to be a repeatable glitch then Beth definitely needs to know.
---
Is there anything else wierd your doing? I always carry a t-60+excavator set and only ever lost a pair of legs that I blame on jumping + shooting explosive rounds @ mobs at my feet. I also generally scrap between 1-6 chassis a week, that I come across in the wild and havent had one glitch out a set yet, probably just jynxed myself though. 😁
---
If you lose a suit or want to farm for other t series sets, check out watoga and look for the vertibirds. There are 2 PA roof spawns where vertibirds have crashed down, and the downed vertibird on the ground in the middle spawns another, there is also a spawn at the BoS camp south of Watoga ( and all the other camps too) one at the bunker near fissure prime and one more at the scrap yard east of watoga. Couple tours and server hops and you'll have your sets maxed out and complete.
---
Sometimes if you spawn with part of your body inside the ground mesh you can just walk through it. 
---
I suspect this is what happened to you.
---
I have no idea where my Voice of Set went
---
The mire is where I found him. Just randomly walking around and he freaked the heck out of me. I did die.
---
You're welcome.
---
I killed mine in the little pond there, hopefully it works!
---
Xb1
---
But will eventually get on pc
---
Does the cooked product come with any buffs?
---
That's exactly where mine is. Lead = ammo. Great spot for random events
---
I don't think I got it. my PSN is apexigod
---
Wow I really appreciate the offer friend, but sadly i'm on PC.
---
I like the idea of sending it them !
---
Lol RDR2 "nice" handouts seem more like distractions from the fact the online mode is awful.
---
76 is actually improving.
---
Lore wise we're about 100 years away from most of it  being invented.
---
Nope, they walk, taking roads as much as possible. Options are to escort them or server hop (which tends to make them immediately appear on loading in). Even server hopping, I've lost one. World's most boring escort mission is the only guarantee of safety.
---
Also seems there might be a glitch with it.  
---
Just finished it for the first time and sheepsquatch’s body instantly disappeared.  I was able to see loot for a second and then he was gone.  
---
That just feels bad.
---
I hope everyone who commented can see this. Thanks to everyone that helped me, I thought I had everything I needed but it turns out I need a but ton of loose screws. So now I’m on the hunt for those lol.
---
Holy shit that enclave rucksack looks cool
---
Eh..we arent entitled to anything extra. They give away free items in the atom shop on a decent basis, that works for me.
---
Where did I call anyone a liar? It’s pretty funny that you attempt to criticize my reading comprehension and immediately make shit up. Those people who have posted alleged evidence are mistaken. It has been proven to be impossible to be one shot through slap damage. I have seen people get flagged for PvP without realizing it for a myriad of reasons, which allows them to get one shot. In their eyes, they haven’t instigated anything so they’ve just been unfairly instagibbed by someone who *clearly* must be cheating. Are they liars? Sure, maybe some are but I doubt it. The far more likely scenario is that these people truly think something funky happened and just didn’t know all of the facts of the situation and how they were flagged. 
---
As for people legitimately stealing from inventories, give me solid proof. All I ever saw were posts where people talked and didn’t provide concrete evidence. I know of really bullshit ways you can lose unintended weapons, like if you’re pricing out an item and right as you go to set it the person requests an additional item and the price is instead placed on the next item in the list. Can’t say if that one still exists but if it happened to the average person during a trade I can totally see how they’d think someone just stole an item.
---
I had the same issue the other day. I gave up on trying. I'm on ps4.
---
Who’s Anne?
---
Yeah, there's got to be something specific about the glitch, because I just tried to recreate it on video for Bethesda and haven't been able to. I have real human witnesses who saw it happen though, which is the only thing comforting me right now.
---
Guess ill have to find another one. He wasnt too hard to find the first time though.
---
It needs to be a random spawn, not a static spawn. And it must spawn by itself, cant spawn any other creatures with it. It also can't be tamed if it's a glowing, scorched, albino or some other "faction" of creature. Diseased is ok.
---
Take your own advice and read. OP was talking about the customizations. It's right there in the first sentence.
---
What does this have to do with anything in this post?
---
I'll sell you one when I'm on in about an hour, make me an offer ^-^
---
Nice idea sending it to them :)
---
Thanks! I'm looking forward to hunting one down after work.
---
The tourist with the camera
---
I was just about to create a post with my sheepsquatch pics, as I hadn't seen confirmation of it being real.
---
Found mine near the radio arrays.
---
I'm going to work on recreating it until I can get it documented.
---
That’s fine, I’m happy to buy skins. I just don’t like unfair advantages, even if I’m the one with the unfair advantage. I guess one could argue that camouflage skins help in pvp but it’s more in a grey area.
---
How do you save for it before you know how it will work? I stockpiled a ton of garbage legendaries now I'm selling a lot of them. I suspect they will not let us sell a rolling pin for a token then use that token to enhance a handmade. That makes it wayyy too easy because for every handmade there are easily five hundred rolling pins and tire irons. It will grant legendary effects to everyone who collected garbage which is a dime a dozen.
---
Secondary melee?  I use a Ghoul-SLayer Fireaxe
---
Same here m8 just made a post just now about it. good to see another wastelander has encountered the beast.
---
Requires? Absolutely not (although I would argue that it’s required if you run heavy weapons; I consider Stabilized a keystone perk for HW and it requires PA). Although a lot of these other posters are calling a lot of negatives on power armor that also may not be true depending on your build and existing gear ;) 
---
I live in PA, but I intended to as soon as the BETA ended. I wanted a HW/Explosives build, and that means Stabilized-Power armor. But I find it works VERY well for me as a bloodied HW user. I don’t use vats most of the time, so no core drain there. Rarely jet pack so no core drain there. Don’t need to sprint much in PVE combat so low core drain there, and out of combat I run reduced sprint cost + longer core duration perks. No power attacks with HW so no core drain there. I actually am halfway through giving away over 100 cores that have been building up in my stash.
---
Melee weapon.
---
This happened on my first attempt at the one in the Mire. Multiple people there, multiple explosive weapons, and the body just disappeared immediately.
---
Do you know if people do an emote if it captures the icon above their head?  I haven't tested it myself yet.
---
Right but what i'm saying is they're pretending they're doing things to make up for a shit beginning, but really it's more cash grabs. A short fucking side story with a Assaultron outfit on it and Bad Billy and Goat Plushies starts hitting the Atom Shop.
---
Well it might have to do with the event you can do to fight the sheepsquatch.
---
I can craft a replacement for you if you need to.  DM me
---
Server hop until you get on a server where most players are similar in level to you.
---
I found that one spawn of the video, picked up two which I didn't know yet, and then they stopped spawning even after 10+ hops, guess there's a cooldown or something. Is it the only spawn, in the locker?
---
That did indeed help in order for it to work, thank you!
---
Joining!

"Pretty tanky"
---
I'm level 55, and my SS was level 50. It took 200+ of my 5.56 rounds, 15 of my 40mm grenades, and then I beat the remaining 30% of its life with All Rise. I was lucky it was by itself in the middle of nowhere, cuz I threw everything I had at it for like 5 minutes. Doesn't do much damage, has some slight stagger. Just went toe-to -toe with it as a commando build with the super sledge, no PA.
---
Oh great another thing to give people's  melee weapons even higher damage. I swear the guys in charge of updates for the game are pure melee builds..
---
It eats Brahmin, I assume that’s why it dropped its skull, I got its skull from the free range event
---
I’m your expert on this! [Check out this video showing what my store used to look like](https://youtu.be/1y3ONQo0l5w). It shows off my design for a shop window. 
---
Basically I have a steel wall with a window as my vendor window. On my side of the window, I have a table with an office chair sitting on top of it. This is where I do all my transactions. I can teleport there basically by selecting the chair if I’m leading customers to the window. The window has two posters on the side windows to draw focus on me in the middle. This works great to corral folks to trade. Also having letters over the window helps the customers know what they can browse your inventory for. 
---
On your side of the window you can also add lots of different things to make it feel more like a shop. For instance, I have a radio for background music, a tv just for the hell of it, a safe I can click on while sitting to get stuff out of storage, etc. I had the mannequin with the alpine horn until I learned the sound is only on the client side, customers can’t hear it. I do have a switch for a siren that’s on the roof so I can grab peoples attention that are outside the shop. I also have a few things on the customers side that I can interact with. The mothman statue and exploding power armor statue currently. It’s fun to activate those while people are waiting to trade. 
---
And my other pointer on a good store would be make the outside look flashy and inviting. You want people to just wander in and know what they’re there for. Spell it out for them and be flexible with trades. If you low ball yourself a little, people usually buy more items. I give things away for free a lot too and am then always shocked when repeat customers come by to bring me new inventory. You can make thousands of caps daily running a good store. [Here’s my current store](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U), it’s like my 5th one and I’ve had it now for about a month. Great location for tons of foot traffic. Hope this helps!
---
Yes this is a huge kick in the balls fo4 when the game took a dump or some wierd stuff like that happend just pull up a handly old save and problem solved.  here grind out or trade for a really good item and poof its gone thats a bad time.  They need the power of a roll back.... Back in the day when my d3 account got hacked they rolled back mine this needs to be a thing.
---
SHEEPSQUATCH STAFF
---
i got a quest from a table at the Southern bell motel
---
Cool, I going hold on to it for now.  It might be rare.
---
I am interested 👀
---
Again, the advantage is ignorable, but it does exist. In the rare situation where you would have beat the SBQ but she's left with *just* enough health for you to lose the fight, you may have won if you had been doing damage for the minute or two you were absent. In the rare situation where you have time to repair your weapon in pvp, thats an advantage over someone who couldnt. These instances are rare, but if you roll a bunch of dice enough times youll eventually get all 6s, and ultimately that means eventually there is SOME advantage. As for your analogy about the brick... I wouldnt care if someone put a brick in a field, but I would care if they put down a brick and said "I'm going to build a pyramid".
---
Not rare at all lol
---
Damn, how are you coming across that many?
---
I do not think a Mirelurk King was coded to be a Sheepsquatch.  And others have reported similar such things where they took a picture of something and it counted as a Sheepsquatch picture.
---
My hypothesis is that if you take a picture of a real Sheepsquatch, it will count as an Alien.  Ignore the coding for this.  It may be the only caveat to the buggy challenge.
---
Runnnn.....its a dupper
---
I found a single dead Brahmin with quillls at the encounter spot that's at the end of the switchback east of Freddy's House of Fear, so it seems they've been added to the pool of random encounters.
---
All of the posts I've seen so far have just been random world encounters, not an event. Are there any details on the event?
---
I found the camera on Xbox
---
Yeah, but I would be ok paying for skins, just saying.
---
No this isn’t something that you are obligated to do . If you don’t like how the game is being run then play another game, simple as that . By not taking a stand and staying regardless of what they do then you are just enabling that behavior
---
I've had 2 legendary and one non-legendary at BBQ.
---
well...took me 6 punch to kill it. I am running unyielding bloodied melee
---
YOU WHAT???
---
Have they released paint for the handmade? I have it in my lever for that purpose.
---
Were you alone or with people? The event may scale, and I'll edit the post.
---
I've already bought the game dude. Oh yeah buy it and don't play it. Easiest 40-60 bucks they've ever made. That'll show em!
---
Welp, there goes my hopes and dreams lmao
---
Aye, that's why Weapon Artisan (Repair to 200%) is so useful, soon as it hit around 90% I Repair mine back to 200%. 
---
200% to 100% gets like an 5% Damage buff, but the real usefulness is that it doesn't degrade. 
---
Also if you have Melee Warrior (Melee Weapons wear down 50% slower) they last forever. 
---
I use a Perk Loadout Manager (PC Mod) and have different builds setup :)

---
Yeah, there very well is the possibility that there is a bug outside of the scripting typo. But from what I've experienced personally the difference between them using Race and Actor type is the difference between kill challenges working and photo challenges not working.
---
Had that in my post already, just got barbed sheepsqatch staff mod
---
This goes to show a little bit about how the distrust in BGS has poisoned the community - everyone just assumes the game is broke when an event doesn't work, because a lot of time that's the case. 
---
I'm loving that this time around it was just because no one had found it yet. Killed my sheepsquatch, came to post picks, and there were 3 other posts where it seems like we all found it at the same time. Neat!
---
I’m on Xbox but the only thing I can’t find is the helmet, I heard the reason pc players have it is because they got it from the dev room and learned the plans
---
I killed it twice and got a mod plan for the crook, spiked or something
---
Try to kick any quality of life cards like thru hiker, pack rat, strong back etc..  your cards should focus on either defence or attack.
---
Get fireproof and the dense mod for Chest Piece to combat against explosive weapons.
---
The search feature of the site does allow you to search for builds that have X Perks like "Shotgunner"
---
I don't 2H/Shotgun so anything I suggest would only be out of guessing and not experience. Sorry.
---
i have gotten nothing but white russians for 3 days
---
This would only be an issue for some of the more extreme cases where you're dealing with 100% unique textures and models.  Many outfits with backpacks aren't unique though and the modded versions could easily just reference their backpackless versions.  For example the Field Scribe outfit is just the Brother Scribe Uniform with a backpack slapped on and the Traveling Leather coat is the same for the Leather Coat.
---
It's a different world when your build has a name to it. I have a angry handmade, level 45. Takes a lot of ammo to get things done.
---
I would die from fall damage so much lmao
---
It usually triggers when you fast travel to Fred's bbq
---
You know, I was loading into a world as I was replying to your comment when he finally spawned! 
---
I think you're a good luck charm xD
---
Are you joking? I don’t remember getting anything for partaking in the BETA.
---
Not sure
---
My carry weight will be 600+ pounds!
---
Ah I want that club!
---
I only eat dog food 
---
But nice to have tho
---
Aww thanks glad it worked out!
---
How are Anne and Ansel different? Is it cosmetic or are there 2 questlines?
---
Hahha, just try full melee build. It take less resource
---
As someone who plays fallout 76 a lot still I think you are being objectively fair.
---
I just don’t use that many. Most of those have been building up since I started playing. I rarely even grab loose cores anymore. For future core usage I’m just going to grab a power plant for an hour. 8 100% cores will last me a week, and I already have like 60 I’m going to slowly drain out. 
---
Basically my core drain is extremely slow because I don’t use it for anything more than basic movement 99% of the time. And if I’m jetpacking or sprinting, I’m usually in exploration mode so I’ve got extended core duration and sprint cost reduction perks equipped.
---
When I went there and didn't find a submarine I was sad.
---
Ones a woman, the other is a man... pretty sure same quest.
---
How do you get through silo?
---
I did it just had to server hop like crazy 😂
---
what you are experiencing is not unusual.
---
The radar array is in the Savage divide, which is subject to enemy scaling depending on who else is around...and the esst side is almost always higher level enemies.
---
Western side of the divide (top of the world, palace of the wind, red rocket)...will give you easy enemies if its just you, more difficult if a higher level is around.  
---
  Some of the quest lines, Roses being one of them, will send you to places you probably should not be at 20.
---
IMHO, at 20, you should (still) be roving aound in the toxic valley for a while.  West side of the divide about L25-30, Ash Heap 30-35ish, savage divide 35+, and te mire and cranberry box at 40+.  
---
Depending on your build, whitesprings nuke zone at about 27.  Going to be tough, and you'll likely die a few times, but it can be done.
---
I have about 40 stored. At some point I'll respec into a rifleman. But not today.
---
Is the Shepherd's Crook a new melee weapon? And if it is, do you know if it appears in the legendary pools?
---
I would totally consider a new character that just camps, hikes, hunts, and uses my handy dandy refrigerated backpack.
---
Yes to the first question, and I do not know about the second.
---
Very big weapon issue that [I reported and was acknowledged](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al3flg/did_they_just_bring_back_all_the_old_bugs/efbo86b/?context=3) way back in January, after patch 5: an automatic tesla rifle can STILL TRIGGER THE DAMAGE BUG that was supposedly fixed four months ago. Don't have any real proof other than a really low quality video but I've seen other people bringing it up too, especially in the past few weeks
---
Im not proud but it took me a while to learn how to herd them lmao
---
Thanks! Really appreciate it. Yeah just taking my time to learn the ropes. It was just a crazy morning lol
---
possible second one in berkley castle
---
Are you on PC?
---
It doesn't matter how YOU use it. It matters how you CAN use it.
---
You got the Classic Collection if you played in 2018.
---
Search camera locations in this forum. Filter to "This week.
---
I totally agree. Its clear where the focus is for Bethesda. It just blows my mind that the majority of this sub is people refusing to see the big picture, supporting and defending a company that is sooo obviously and unabashedly lecherous at this point. 
---
Fallout 76 might be an example of the WORST way to implement microtransactions in a mainstream title: you dont see Ark Survival Evolved (probably the worst game of the 2010s) trying to charge people for repair kits and weapon reskins at this point in their failed evolution...
---
I respectfully object. It might be "neat" but there are other things that they should focus their efforts on rather than mini games. Fix the bugs and add more fallout content before adding extraneous things.
---
Maybe the one near Charleston DMV?
---
Are you still on that server by chance?
---
I keep an eye out for low-weight items that are also cheap. I’m saving up for the legendary vendor.
---
Yeah! Let's make it like WoW!
---
This hustle is starting to be a hassle lmao
---
Throwing knife
---
Oh....lame 🤣
---
Yes I have also found it whilst searching the mire.
---
Aint nobody got time for that
---
the wendigo is a good distance into the cave, not outside.
---
You'll have to kill a bunch of other things on the way.
---
If you kill the wendigo in the cave, the mission will reappear once you logoff/back on.
---
Yeah, 5 people including myself. Lots of high levels.
---
Goat feet my dude
---
GPU driver update?
---
I lost a two shot explosive double barrel shotgun from this, Bethesda basically told my to turn my console off and on again. It obviously didn’t work. 😡
---
Ah! Appreciate it. No idea that this would work.
---
I Found Sheepsquach at South mountain lookout near Spruce knob
---
I'm so upset I bought this game, I keep checking back to see if its good yet lol...
---
I bought one of the duped .50 Cal's for something like 250 caps. TSE +1 Agility. There were three of them in the vendor at Watoga.
---
Joining
---
We need uniforms. Definitely uniforms. The Ghostbusters had uniforms why can't we?
---
I’ve run across legendaries in Whitesprings multiple times, but I always kind of assumed they were just recently sold to the vendor by a different player on my server.
---
Possibly! Hopefully you get some traction with this post, and either get BGS on fixing it, or someone can find a work around til they do.
---
On workshops, it's is perfectly fine to have PVP over workshop when both parties are at or near workshop. What we have though is forcing PVP at any point of world through Workshop contest mechanics that should have been limited to workshop area, while it at same time isn't about workshop for contesting party at all, they don't even finish capturing process in almost all cases I've seen myself =\
---
That is one of things that need to be fixed as it is a broken mechanic for Adventure mode
---
meh. If I have them and it doesn't work or I can only whittle the pile down a little at t a time I can deal with that. Always be prepared....but don't set expectations too high.
---
Oh yeah.
---
Oh got it. I had no idea!
---
Sorry where is the bulletin board?
---
I have over 800 hours in and I just learned I can moved the camp module itself in camp without paying to move my camp to affect my spawn-in and fast travel location at my own camp. Learn something new everyday lol
---
I've found a couple 3 star armor pieces with ammo and weapon weight reduction the past couple days. I've paid no more that 300 caps for each. I will gladly use those to replace my crafted stock armor piece.
---
Never going inside of a city or building and surviving off of stuff purely in the wild would be an interesting playstyle.
---
I did update the driver, yes -- and before you ask, no, I'm not rolling back (the previous driver was something like 375.xx  ;; current installed is 425.xx).
---
I don’t feel like it would save me from my own stupidity
---
Wait.
---
So you have to kill one at an outside spot for it to not repeat itself with every single login?
---
Gah, I literally just hopped off. I'm so sorry!
---
I would say it's just need to be that if you enter workshop during contest period then you accept the PVP challenge, and if you don't you forfeit it as it is right now.
---
You're talking about a world were our personal information is collected and sold, it's exposed on many fronts and people put up with it. You're talking about a country that takes money from it's people and can't even account for where it goes. It's just the 21st century and greed. It's even affected Bethesda and this is the result.
---
I'm excellent, thank you
---
"I survived 400 weight and Scorchbeast Spam"
---
&gt;I was totally unaware it was in the game at this point
---
So were we until we saw the title to your post.   ಠ\_ಠ
---
Saved me emoting with the camera several times
---
Yes, excellent, thank you for the reply
---
I never buy legendaries at vendors cause they usually suck. But I found two decent three star legendaries the other day for under 50 caps each and bought them.
---
First time I did anything in the divide, I was travelling with a friend who was about L70.  I was about 15.  Swarmed by L50 mutants.  
---
Friend saw the first one and said "Hide!"  Which is exactly what I did.
---
Came back a bunch of levels later, and it was all L6 scorched.  
---
Ditto the quest that takes you to Lewiston in the ash heap.  
---
Once you make about L40, life gets easier, and you'll level up faster.
---
Meantime, enjoy exploring!
---
Awesome, thank you for the reply regarding the price
---
Did you find a sloth? Any idea where they spawn in the bog?
---
They're excited with the new content, cut them some slack.
---
I dunno, I just laid into it with my prime ultracite gatling laser for a bit and it died. I got a one-star Hunter's Walking Cane out of it, so that was a *fantastic* investment of resources.
---
I really wish that wood armor was near impervious to melee while being slightly worse than now on energy and ballistic.
---
I think it would make things interesting.
---
Thank you for the reply regarding price
---
I have bought a few things.
---
Enforcer. Shotgunner. With that gun you are a PvP god. You need nothing else for pure dps at this point.
---
Do you recall a ballpark price and quality?
---
Agreed.  It would be like getting a participation trophy.
---
Hmm I think I need to invest in that
---
There is a safe squirreled away in a sunken shipping container, but you can't get to it :(
---
I just killed one.
---
There are no normal fish there all dead the only thing you will catch are anglers or mirelurk
---
Is this why I stumbled upon a small herd of dead Brahmin?
---
It's live now? When did they add it?
---
No worries.
---
My opossum made it all the way back (almost a third of the map hike) just to get killed by a solo mongrel at my base...😔
---
Are you on PC? I will gladly buy any 3\* TSE handmade for 6k if you know anyone who sell. Heck, I can even pay 25k for it. Most people don't even want caps on PC, having a very hard time getting a good gun for caps. And i'm sitting on 110k on my account, caps are mostly worthless.
---
Not really. Apparel was maybe 200-300, armor was maybe 100-400. Not sure. I do check the vendors all the time, though, just in case there’s something cool.
---
Ie double barrel shotty for 100 caps. Sold for 30k caps + 😂😂
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Bird bones helps too. I just dont like fall damage tbh. I even have armor with fall famage reduction and still I somehow find a way to Insta gib myself
---
I contacted Bethseda about my Grog axe that suddenly disappeared. They couldn't give a crap.
---
Need to see the drill as proof
---
Just pick a statue and keep server hopping
---
biggest thing i see is scrapper, white knight, and travel agent are situational, so no need to full time them, i run a stealth sniper build and build is somewhat similar to yours.   
---
other suggestions would be:   
---
drop 1 from int (only need 8 for weaponsmith and weapon artisan for repairs) move it to endurance for 3 points and use fireproof as a main, pretty much makes you immune to explosions/TSE explosive dmg (not the bullets but the explosive part)/ scorchbeast cries.   
---
drop 1 from str and make tp lvl 2, move that point to chrasima for lvl 6 (also allows sharing 2 star cards if ya ever team) so you can equip/use tenderizer.   
---
also unless youre really having ammo issues id drop scrounger, move those points to perception and invest in tank killer and a higher perception. (one run of west tek, and lucky hole mine usually gives me a weeks worth of ammo)  
---
and like i said these are just my opinions.
---
Bingo!
---
Thank you thank you!!!
---
Got the sheepsquatch club, so possibly only the shard left at this point
---
No icons showed up in the photos.
---
Me too, i wanted the useless eggs tho lol
---
I'd rather see all these excited posts about the new event and the Sheepsquatch as opposed to people bitching about the repair kits and "pAy To WiN" relax dude, they're excited. They can post their excitement all they want
---
What is this RuneScape
---
Nice! Just killed him again. Not so rare of an event I guess.
---
Its the (probably) last plan i need from the event :p, got like 12 other different plans already
---
Are you a mod?
---
Okay Lorax, thanks for speaking for all of us.
---
That is what they are
---
womp womp
---
i pre-ran it with a different character.
---
Which plans you got?
---
Glowing and scorched work, but I think you're right about albino.
---
I can confirm I did have complete set of t60 duplicate for me and I have no idea at all how it happened all pieces were the same I ened up scrapping one cause had no use to carry an extra it was a good couple months ago and hasnt happen to me since. Wondering if t60 only this happens to?  Cause I now use x1 did they ever fix the helm target bug that would cause blue screen on ps 4 ?
---
I have run all of those as a stealth sniper build and the only time I get enemies "on me" is when I make a mistake. I hardly ever need stims to the point where I regularly sell off 20 at a time just to stay around 50 "just in case". 
---
If you go charging in with no understanding of sight lines and aren't listening to the sounds of the enemies then yeah, you are gonna have a bad time of it.
---
This would be even better with a garbage bag ghili suit.
---
Wendigo mount is found through a quest you get at the Southern Bell Motel
---
Epic idea, particularly if it allows for us to micromanage space for growing crops
---
4 mods for the crook (electric, glass, horn and one other i dont rembrr), meat pie, crook, sheepsquatch club and staff, and a mod for the staff
---
&gt;* If you take a Workshop, hostile players can attack you *anywhere in the world*, even if you are Pacifist.  It's almost never worth doing.  Trust me.  There are other ways to get the resources you need.
---
Wait seriously? I've been playing since launch and never noticed this.
---
Just curious what your perk load is, 610 damage on that Shepherds Crook is bonkers!
---
I always get the same quest, but it's for a Wendigo outside the House of Horrors. I kill it, and the quest comes back after I login again. I get rewards every time though.
---
Why is this being downvoted? They litterally meantioned this as a possible future atom shop item
---
The Sheepsquach had been added a while ago, but it was disabled. They might've turned it on with today's dailies.
---
I bought eiter an Executioner combat or a vampire lever action from a vendor after a fachnacht parade.  Very good price on it, too :)
---
OVerweight, frustrated with player vending, etc, I have sold lots of legendary armor to vendors.
---
If I actually marketed them here, would likely get much better pricing, but I cant always predict what time I'll be on to actually make the exchange.
---
Let me join the choir. 
---
"Cool story"
---
They need to make changes to enclave stuff first, such as make it so that we know whether the polymer mod i am buying is for the chest or legs or arms, fix one of the urban scout armor limbs since it is messed up and so it gets less damage resist than its forest counterpart, and we need legendary scout armor to drop, after that is done, then i think they should offer scout armor skins and enclave outfits in the atoms shop
---
I can acknowledge that the whole notion of workshops in conjunction with how pvp optimizations skew outcomes dramatically results in a bunch of overhead that many (often myself included) find counterintuitive and dissatisfying. Given what it sounds like your playstyle is, I don't know that Raider defense will be something that will line up effectively with what you like to do. It'd be convenient if it was - if power armor was an effective (let alone optimal) option for solo pvp/survival, if voice chat didn't double as sonar for potential opposition, and so on - but that is simply not the state of affairs. 
---
It sounds like you're taking the right approach by just hopping - saving yourself the frustration of getting killed or robbed by a workshop opportunist. If you stash your shit and take a death, you're out a few caps at most. Small price to pay for free fusion cores or clean food imo. I honestly enjoy the combat aspect of FO76, pvp included. The game actually feels good to play for me. The issues are generally around the gimmicks that end up a result of gear/build tweaks and strategies that turn a lot of what could be a really engaging system to a coin flip, even for the totally prepared.
---
Far as the flavor of cosmetics and such, the Wasteland has always been a place packed with weirdos. Getting perforated by an automatic weapon wielded by a degenerate in a furry mascot head just sounds like another day surrounded by whack-a-doos, which is what I've come to expect.
---
Good luck out there, and remember that even if you're wearing an X-01 and aren't truly perked out for pvp, you can always pop a Stealth Boy, get yourself an automatic Tesla, and melt someone chasing until you can fast travel or server hop.
---
Nothing pisses a raider off more than the one that got away.
---
Excited to do something new, not thrilled it is right on my doorstep. The quest is simple and fun, I like the mobs, and seeing others show up to do something together.  Obviously have to ignore those who either 1 shot the legendaries or prevent others from participating.  It's quick and fun, something else to do so that's nice!
---
This. Nobody sells TSE Handmades for caps anymore (on PC) forget 3*...even the base 2*...
---
Caps are pretty much only good for middle of the road legend legendaries and for buying vendor plans...
---
They're in Fallout 2 :D
---
PA is absolutely, completely and utterly useless in PVP, there's no tradeoff to counter this
---
I wonder if there is also that unarmed weapon we saw in the trailer
---
New content activated so the level 100+ are logging in to complete the even boosting the local area difficulty
---
I just keep my 2/3 star legendaries and got rid of my 1 star. I was starting to get really hampered by the weight of the legendaries. I had about half of my weight in legendaries.
---
It’s in the train station, where the lying Lowe and party posters are
---
I doubt it, its the bear skull gauntlet not sheepsquatch gauntlet
---
yeah mobs in game are based with whoever spawns into or runs through there recently (i dont know timers keeping mobs at a certain lvl) so basically you got unlucky and spawned where a higher level player had recently been through there causing 50+ mobs..  
---
server hop or going to a different area is about the only way to fix that, also to combat this always watch where ya know you are wanting to go for 20-30 minutes.. like the idea "i think ill go to watoga later" start watching it, check map often to see who goes through there if its been clear 30-60 minutes good chance if you head there bots will be/spawn your level. you see a high lvl there best to avoid it since everything will spawn to him and if hes 50+ bits will be higher lvl.
---
Oh ok nvm
---
I still want a huge mirelurk queen boss and a massive drilling machine or something in the ash heap.
---
When you do add me ^_^
---
I like how you question my reading comprehension and then have two paragraphs about how people are liars.  All because some of us had to server hop more than you did.
---
 I mean you never know but i havent seen anyone get it yet so unlikely
---
just regular slugger perks + adrenal reaction
---
I lived up on the mountain side behind the water park for my first 80 lvls I think.
---
Does it have to be at night?
---
Saying Bethesda messed up is toxic? So being critical of the game is toxic, gotcha. And yes, talking about how Bethesda messed up and venting is "ruining the community". The only herd mentality I see here is yours. And by the way, all of his critical videos perform as well, if not better than the rest. Sorry to disappoint ya.
---
Odd, I've been carrying around two PA chassis in my inventory from first day and till few months ago and never had PA disappear, had it duplicate though
---
Cuz then your other team mates could just spend all there time killing enemies etc.. for exp and benefit from the exp the team leader gets from doing quests without ever actually completing them themselves, would be a really quick way to level up that could be perceived as an exploit.
---
I actually like it that way, it's fun getting large mission boss mobs to spawn.
---
Move out to the mire! Where the wildlife is plenty and the trespassers are tasty! Plenty of mystery meat pie to go around! Lemonade too!
---
How many times did you done the event to get all that stuff?
---
Not common but highly duped in the past.
---
No, I've had most during the day.
---
I think most players will start relocating to high traffic areas for player vending.
---
I had 12 level ups to use a few days ago, just unlocked random perks just to have. Now I have 11 more, guess I’ll be doing the same. Thinking about just waiting until the new (forget the name of it) thing comes for levels over 100
---
I thank the good lord that I haven't dealt with server disconnect like everyone else. My serious an only problem I've encountered the whole time I've played since launch is no mods off of armor. I can scrap armor for days an haven't once got a mod from it. But now weapons, it feels like every other one I scrap  I get a mod from. Anyone else?
---
OMW I just encountered a level 80 legendary sheepsquatch while exploring. Just to let you know. 😉
---
There's nothing saying you couldn't hang a bag off the back of your nuclear-powered-walking-tank-war-suit.  Allowing players to climb inside of PA and keep the benefits of the backpack they were wearing was probably the compromise they made to avoid the technical hurdles of modeling and animating a backpack on the outside of the power armor.
---
I have 27 skulls so i think 24ish bcs ive had 2 a ffew times
---
Thanks, so its it random? Or do you think something triggers it?
---
What does it require
---
i want to be a tadpole
---
PM explanation?
---
Oh I totally agree with you, but most of the time, the nuke doesn't cross the road, as most people leave the train station out of it, so none of those are available.  The 15 (x2 = 30)  I mentioned are almost always within the zone.
---
I agree about Morgantown.
---
Fissure site prime is pretty good for violet.  I can pull about 100 violet from the southern bog, but I usually have to wait until the nuke zone clears.  It's hard to sneak in PA or a hazmat suit.
---
While everyone was throwing away legendary stuff during the parade event i was picking it all up lol.
---
Smart, good job lol what have you been paying for them or just finding them? (Also, I played wastelad and it gave me +1 endurance for 15 minutes, wasn't sure if anyone noticed)
---
There are only 2 things able to cancel the sentinel effect: staggering or crippling - and somehow crits ignore the sentinel effect as well.
---
I do know some guys modifying .ini files, but it doesn't allow you to spot and aim perfectly to any player in range of your weapon, things cheaters are usually able to do whatever the build you're running and the gear you're using ;-)
---
Absolutely. The camp update really can't come fast enough. But workshop pvp needs to be limited to the workshop and there needs to be a way for people to just release ownership of a workshop.
---
It doesn't help how rife for exploitation the workshop pvp is.
---
Because of the way they've announced camp invulnerability will be ["will prevent other players’ attacks from dealing damage to objects and structures you’ve built in your C.A.M.P. so long as you 'or your Turrets' are not hostile against those players."](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4gWcpeopiSywMb5GCpPAem/inside-the-vault-new-survival-challenge-rewards-and-more-april-18-2019)
---
It means unless they make it so workshop pvp is limited to only the workshop area, the griefers who find your camp will still be able to do this.
---
If you own a workshop all they would have to do it be in a team and start contesting it. Then their friend who is lying in wait can still wreck you shit.
---
"fixed like everything else"? You mean just the stuff that we like? All the broken shit that actually needs fixed isn't getting fixed.
---
I ran into Rachel the other day, and tagged 10 rabbits with my pearly peepers as I have no tracking guns. I know there are camera challenges, but I would love a bird watching challenge with binoculars. Heck there is already a birdwatching station with a list of local birds.
---
Don’t hate the playa hate the game. Oh wait! that’s exactly what you’re saying 😂
---
Not entirely sure. I'm pretty certain there's only one location it can be active at during any given time, and then there's probably a cool down timer.
---
I just imagined the Harper ferry vendor Wallace saying “cheese” in his smooth voice.
---
I’ve got an AA lever action +250 dr while reloading, 25% faster fire rate level 45
---
Fishing is my favorite thing in any rpg. Its my favorite thing. Favorite.
---
I have Explosive Flamer, as soon as they balance fuel crafting...
---
&gt;I have friends with 12 Xbox accounts with max caps on all five alts that’s 1.5mil in caps
---
Sounds like your friends are dupers.
---
Statue? I thought the whole thing was next to cars?
---
The fo3 dart gun was my favorite!! ❤ the syringer just doesn't do it for me either.
---
Please pm the details
---
This - is bassically what I'm talking about. You kind of prove a point. Thanks. 
---
No- saying someone messed up isnt toxic, but crapping down the same pipe for months on end, making speculations and send hate twords just a speculation is toxic. Rounding up a group and telling them this game is trash is toxic. Only focusing on all bad things while ignoring any good, is toxic. 
---
If I enjoy playing golf, do you think I'm about to watch a top 10 reason golf is a crap sport? Probably not. Kinda the same boat.
---
Chicken coop. That would be awesome. There goes all my camp budget.
---
It’s like Skyrim all over again only dying because you Missed judged the height of the jump lol
---
Why are downvoting him for pointing out a fact?
---
The main questline has a bunch of special item rewards that spawn at your current level.  For that reason it may be a good plan to level up through exploration rather than the main questline.  Others agree?
---
Yes just found him twice up on the hill above Dent and Sons Construction
---
Honestly, it shouldn't be too hard to make a very simple fishing mechanic. You can already interact with water, so the game already tracks that, and a fishing pole objects already exists. Plus they already have the the ability to interact with things from a distance like with the Pacify command when aiming a gun. All you'd need to do is add the Fishing pole as an item you hold, then when you "aim it" at a source of water you press a button and your character could do an animation. Then a fish or other item could have a chance to be granted to you like they do for dozens of other interactions. Then they just need some fish models for your inventory, maybe make it based on which biome you're in.
---
Either that or add "fishing stations" to some water locations. Just a little chair with a fishing rod next to it. Then you just interact with that, some animations play and you catch some fish.
---
Obviously they'd have to do more to make it a game. But a basic fishing interaction, shouldn't really be hard based on what you can already do in the game.
---
I have fond memories of trying to cross the map as a low level player to get to the plan.
---
I would be okay with it if we got the milking perk.
---
It’s x2 xp all weekend
---
How do you get it to work?
---
I got 3 or 4. I knew about it, was just too tired most days after work.
---
Also forgot to say I’m ps4
---
I found a normal fish swimming in the giant lake behind thunder mountain power plant I saw only one in the middle swimming alive
---
Because many people are too lazy to put in any effort before they are told exactly what to do. They believe it's only fair when they themselves start doing it.
---
You can rename it now by hovering over it in your inventory and "Inspecting" the items.
---
I think this was fixed in the April 9th update. :)
---
Nope. Not yet :(
---
No keeps popping up now..
---
I agree with you, but also see OP's point. 
---
What about taking a portion of the durability of all your items? That's still technically a hit to your resources, fits in with lore and physics, and would have the same level of punishment, if not more punishing, making you want to avoid death. 
---
A PvP kill could also maybe drop a bag of junk that you had on you at the time, along with some caps. This make PvP have a point to it other than griefing.
---
I saw a video where it said the start of the quest was a corpse next to a car or something.... Was I lied to?!
---
I didn't figure there was, but thanks for confirming that for me!
---
You got me bro I have no idea. I fought him/her once and my game crashed but I seen it on someone's stream
---
I just did Fred's BBQ shack, Brahmin were killed by a Yao Guai while I was fighting the sheep
---
Hey dude, did you know sheepsquatch is real?
---
If by "misjudged" you mean trying to make it from the NE corner to the SW corner of the map in one jump. Then yes. Sucks Morgantown causes loading errors mobing that fast. Dropped my 60 lead 68 meters in the sky.
---
tbh, id disagree. but the sad fact is if you reported the bug and how to do it, theyd immediately fix it while leaving a bunch of other far more game breaking bugs in the game.
---
something about that just doesnt seem right. so yeah screw it. why tell em?
---
I like the idea but if it works like the c.a.m.p.s repair all no thanks.
---
Thanks
---
I've had times where it seemed I was constantly getting hammered by things non stop. And at other times, I would go whole play sessions without seeing any enemies at all. Seems to vary by server and if someone just cleared the area prior to you getting there. I will say levels 20-50 were some of the hardest in the game for me. Mainly because the forest is now too easy but it seems all the other areas are too hard. Just keep pushing through. You can always server hop if you get cornered and are knocking at death's door. Don't be afraid to retreat from an SB. They are hard until you get level 50-60. Then they seem to get easier. Good legendaries and perks help tremendously.
---
The watoga High school with 5 pieces of chameleon on and a really good combat knife its super fun when you kill enough ghouls legs start to spawn in have had up to 4 three stars in a single event and all the sweet sweet candy you could every want------The invisble stabby McStabsin
---
Try this: build a foundation with half or less of it sticking out of the ground. Put a door on the foundation. Now store or scrap the foundation. Change the door to a wall, then add a half wall underneath it so it touches or goes partially through the ground. 
---
Now if you do this with multiple foundations to make a small building and follow all the steps above, you can have something kinda like a greenhouse when you’re done. It’ll be a small covered building with just a dirt floor you can use for crops. Or if you build it around certain plants, they should remain there. Just a thought.
---
It will be if I get a potato with cheese.
---
Omg thank you!!!! That sounds good for now :)
---
It would be nice but the problem is sentinel armor. You have to be standing for sentinel to proc. If you were invisible and able to attack by standing it would be pretty OP.  You can't target invisibility with VATS. The only think that could break it would be stagger effect.
---
I do agree that Chameleon mutation is outclassed by 1 lowly piece of chameleon armor. Not sure what the fix would be there.
---
Just the poison doing it's job, watching a Deathclaw slowly losing it's health as you pray the stealth boy doesn't run out too quickly. Fun times.
---
Amen on the heavy weapons bug. Using my gatling t the others get fixed. Lost 4 fusion cores in about 30 seconds yesterday. Can confirm that they were all 50%+. Still only got the rough ~100 shots out. Spin problem on top of that.
---
Haha no problem!
---
Yest it is a random spawn, but oddly enough. I ran into Ansel three times at Tyler County Fair Grounds. It was on my third encounter that I finally picked up his loot.
---
Re-occurring bugs that came back with patch 8:
---
- VATS still misses often the first time you VATS with 95% accuracy. Going in and out of VATS fixes this. Vas fixed in 7
---
- Dying while overencumbered sometimes forces you to spawn at vault 76. Was fixed long ago.
---
- "Nothing is selected" while trying to place items in building mode. Was fixed in 7 (i think)
---
- Drill is back in the legendary loot table (the syringe has always been there)
---
Well, I consider myself a Bethesda fanboy but they just keep screwing up over and over again. Juicehead is simply pointing out the obvious.
---
I believe I read that wood armor made you undetectable to the scorch beast.
---
I just dumped 10k of .38 and 10k of fusion cells on a level 12 today.   He was happy.   I was happened to be released of that burden.
---
For some reason I cant just trash ammo.    Or adhesive, or lead, screws,springs...
---
Yet I am swimming in it.
---
Just bought one of those at the enclave bunker. Did wonder what it was.
---
Some level 130 guys came and ruined my camp yesterday after trying to get me to pvp them for like 10 minutes. I’m not moving, just upset and wanted to complain.
---
How are the weapon damages so high?
---
Love it 😂
---
That's for the new camera! You need to search for one of the two corpses that spawn in a tourist location and grab a broken camera off the corpse. There should be more info about that somewhere in /r/fo76!
---
Snallys are tameable, but you need Wasteland Whisperer maxed. As far as I can tell, Animal Friend does not apply to them. They are also frail, so good luck getting it to survive the hike back to your camp (don’t follow them, they are more likely to make it alone).
---
I’ve encountered tameable ones most often at the spot to the right of Cranberry Glade. The Glade is also a random encounter spot, so it’s one of the best places to hunt for a pet since there are two spots right near each other.
---
Happened to me earlier but it was with the imposter sheepsquatch, the body was invisible (looked like how you appear in chameleon) but I saw loot for 2 seconds and then nothing. Waited for a pile to show up but nothing appeared so left after 10 minutes
---
Can you elaborate on what "keeps getting screwed up"? 
---
I've personally had nothing but good playtime for the past 2-3 months
---

Here is my shotgun build I just out together today and will start leveling now that we are in double experience. 
---
I want for pretty much all damage and armor buffs- with a few of the obvious crafting  cards.
---
Card is full! All 16 fighters ready to go!
---
Currently taking in backup fighters just in case.
---
We just found it somewhat immersion breaking. I understand how it could be an exploit but to even that our you could share all exp gains across the whole team.
---
Borderlands has a huge following and this is the system they use so I don't think it's a bad way of running things
---
A sale always improves things. But the Atom store is part of the game. Not a separate entity. Without the game it's useless. The reason for failure is several. Mostly lack of quality in the game and available merchandise. Now Bethesda is betraying players trust. I heard my brother say he can no longer trust Bethesda.
---
 He won't be buying any of their games when they come out. And he owns a lot of their games.
---
I actually did live in the mire before i moved to the savage divide. I found an awesome treehouse that wasnt a marked location and made a lovely home up there.
---
I suppose in the multiplayer pvp aspect it could be an exploit but it works for borderlands/ coop modes
---
No I have 2 stored items
---
I think they definetly need to look at it as it only drops in 1\* variants right now. It also isn't very good defensively.  
---
I always wondered why it was in the game.  
---
Maybe it could "mutate" and regrow durability outside of combat or something like that? They definitely need to make it drop at 3\* variants though
---
Sure, I don't disagree. I'm sure they employ many developers who want only the best things for the game and the players. Unfortunately those aren't the people making the decisions.
---
Just got heavy sheepsquatch club mod
---
I really like how they're sneaking in stuff like this and the unsolved quests. Adds to the "mystery" factor.
---
Why would this system prevent that? I agree that number and toughness of mobs should scale with number of players
---
There's no benefit gains between 1 charisma and 20?! That seems crazy.
---
That sounds great!  Because to cut down on needing a huge number of actors, I'm going to need whoever is able to play multiple people.
---
No, but he is a whiny child.
---
I think we might be old my friend :)
---
I tried to get into fortnite, but the 4-d platform construction chess with shotguns made my brain hurt.
---
I got the staff plan. Is it rare?
---
I’ve tamed scorched animals. They are obnoxious though since they like to attack your camp (without doing damage).
---
The rest about them being a random spawn and solo is correct though. You also need to be a higher level than the animal, supposedly twice the level, however this does not apply to scorched creatures.
---
You're welcome, friend.
---
The truth is out there
---
Yup next week if things go as planned
---
Don't know if this was mentioned but... obviously don't stand in the blast zone as the nuke is landing. That's guaranteed death.
---
every white spring run ends with a trip to the magic fountain the rate you contract diease in this game is nothing short of riduclas.  I love the one where nothing hits you and you contract it from your knife holy shit boys its gone airborn
---
The buff to energy weapons imo was still too low on certain guns. The regular laser gun being the main one.  Unfortunately the explosive variety are about the only decent ones out there to my knowledge. Maybe bloodied or furious like you have?
---
They should have fanny packs..
---
Some guys tried to do that to me a couple days ago but they didnt know i was home crouching the whole time and i just logged out and switched servers. But honestly out of all the people that have come through my c.a.m.p. recently this was the only time that someone just decided to attack my house
---
Please add fishing. It could provide a tiny tiny xp reward for catching one. Little activities like this could really help fill our void between updates.
---
Just had 3. There were also 3 people at the event so I don’t know if that makes a difference. 2 of them were 3* lvl 80 too
---
It’s a lot better than “Repair kits are literally p2w!!!11” posts that we keep getting here everyday times a million.
---
I see where you’re coming from, and I’ve never played borderlands but speaking as someone who mainly plays solo, it’d probably annoy me 😂 but I’m a begrudging fecker lol
---
I definitely believe so. I haven't gotten it yet, and I've done it enough times to get all the plans I have above, plus a couple extra of the electrified mod. Could I ask which location you did it at and got the staff?
---
Add Plan: Sheepsquatch shard to your list - New throwing weapon, deals 100\~ physical and poisons the target, needs mysterious quill and a little other junk to craft.
---
Filter by weight or value. Plans have both, notes don't.
---
The problem with the damn camera? Its in a random location!!!! I hate that! They wave it in front of us then put it who knows where!!! The hell?! Not fair!
---
They did say it would be delayed till patch 9 so we’ll just have to wait and see.
---
Are you the same Altairp who made the animal farms mods for Sim Settlements? If so, love your work!
---
You got it. I know there's the staff too, bit I don't know what the full name is.
---
 🤞🏻
---
What outfits did we get?
---
I'm getting tired of stockpiling legendaries. My stash is full of junk/legendaries and now I can only equip weight reduction perks to maximize efficiency.
---
Sure, it was bbq, only me and another person. Cows did take damage, but non died. Also 1 sheep spawned
---
Sheepsquatch shards as well for new weapons
---
well i thought about a furious one as well however im not sure about it and i guess bloodied works im gonna try that one out thanks.
---
yes definetly they should have buffed them more like 60-80% instead of 20% the energy weapon "fix" felt like a joke
---
It makes Stabilized perk not work as well. I belive all anti - armor type effects are literally anti-armor, so although they lower the physical armor of enemies, they do absolutely nothing for energy damage. It is such an unbelievably easy fix to change these perks / legendary effects to lower both physical and energy damage... can't believe it hasn't been done yet.
---
FWIW I'm in the same boat - I have an AA / 25% fire rate Gatling Laser that's worthless.
---
I think if the game give allow u do that its not player fault . But of course wasnt to work this way ... because still a exploite afterall
---
I got it first try.
---
Maybe that's the issue, maybe PC is different. I'm on Xbox.
---
I’m the same. I only wish I could wear the hazmat suit over my standard armor and not have to use PA in nuke zones.
---
Shotgun and melee work well together as the perk points go to pretty much the same Special stat under strength. 
---
I run rifle and one hand melee and just alternated picks between the two every other level. I also picked quite a few QOL perks in the beginning just to make things easier. Once you get to level 50 you can re-spec points if you think you messed up.
---
You can search reddit as well for some guides on builds. I see quite a few posted on here.
---
Also the southern belle motel!
---
Just added it probably as you were typing that out 😂 Thank you though.
---
On Xbox? Maybe mine's dupped. I hope I don't login one day to see my three guns missing and I'm running around with a fucking Pump Action again.
---
I understand the argument, and don't disagree that this has the potential to set a terrible precedent, but I also see where putting them in the Atom shop simply makes them available to everyone.
---
I have met many players that even at levels over 100 have never participated in a SBQ battle, or only did it once, and won't go back again.
---
I have not heard from anyone yet that has received any of the kits from other events besides Scorched Earth.
---
They won't show up on outfits wich already have a cosmetic backpack
---
I’ll take either at this point
---
Quit and relaunch didn’t fix it? Did you remap the key somehow? I know you can on PC
---
It can’t be that rare, because I got one 😅
---
I’ve been running BBQ, wasn’t aware of the other location except for random event spawns.
---
Buddy, the explorers outfit isn't rare.
---
The Free Range event is up now, it's possible they snuck in a few side quest like they did last time
---
This is data, not code. Just get FO76Edit and fire it up.
---
Killed one as well, am 23-ish, he was 50 legendary, had to lure him on my camp near Mount Blair to kill him. I think I used 90% of all my ammo. Halfway thru his HP bar he suddenly ran away and reset ALL his health. Had to lure him again and use a gatling laser. Think I expended something like 5-6 fusion cores.
---
Funny thing, ANOTHER one spawned at the same spot immediately after, but at this point I noped away
---
Do you find 76 better as a solo experience? It was sold so heavily as a multiplayer experience yet it doesn't really act as one In my opinion
---
For the Free Range event? If so, I'll add it!
---
Is that really what you want? 
---
Right now you probably find the game intrinsically rewarding to play. When the add this sort of reward, what is called an extrinsic reward, what happens is your gratification starts coming from the reward and not from the activity you originally enjoyed. If the extrinsic reward is ever taken away, you no longer enjoy the activity the reward was associated with even if you originally enjoyed that activity before you started getting rewarded for engaging in it. Thats how extrinsic rewards destroy fun.
---
It has trade in value , I’m sure you got the majority if not all your moneys worth , and you can boycott future releases
---
The question is more like... why would you not want to use power armor? It's plentiful, it's easy to repair, the extra carryweight far outweighs the loss of junk / ammo / weapon weight reduction (assuming you even have those legendary effects, and the aid one doesn't work afaik), and the DR is so much better. And yeah, makes nuke zones a breeze. The only reason I'd not want to use it is if I was going with a very VATS heavy bloodied build and stacking tons of perception / agility through an Unyielding armor set, or an Unyielding Melee set.
---
Had it happen to me but no meat pile showed, hung around for 5-10 minutes and nothing
---
Didnt they say fridges were coming with backpacks?
---
Just look at the front page of this sub right now lol
---
Sounds like Santa needs T-51 calibrated shocks.
---
Xbox? Me and my friends were doing it earlier and we dropped around 50 items. Check the ice machine outside the golf club. If you find anything, you're welcome
---
Okay you must be special. Like, helmet special. 
---
Calling people liars indicates that they’re intentionally spreading false information. 
---
These people just didn’t know the rules of the game enough to know why they were wrong. 
---
They’re not liars. They’re stupid. Like you.
---
I left them out, I really just listed end points
---
Like you saw his little CAMP unit there?
---
Oh must’ve been missed thx
---
I was just able to attach my HUD to the X-01. I was up in The Enclave when I did it. I'm on Xbox.
---
Yep! The very same- and thanks, I appreciate it!
---
Yeah I'll go to Gamestop and get my $6
---
How on earth does that work? Why is sentinel so powerful?
---
Yeah in fairness there’s guys out there just become wanted so they can initiate pvp with someone who has the electrically charged mutation so when they hit them and spark they immediately become hostile. Then their whole team just kill you straight away, it’s so annoying, it would be great to see some worth of nerf even if the amount of caps the wanted player can get is reduced during the time they’re wanted.
---
Cant be rare then.
---
If you do Enclave events, you can get Enclave armor and weapons.
---
explore look for events on the map, kill everything that moves, loot all the things.. avoid quests save that stuff for lvl 50.
---
Yeah I have a bunch of plasma cores from a trade and honestly thinking about just dumping them for someone else next time I'm on. And hey, if you're on XB1 I can help you with your junk problem...
---
What the fuck?
---
Yeah, but... free staters are a bunch of individualists. They wouldn’t do anything like a uniform. At best a logo/flag.
---
Also, if you have anything locked at your camp and they pick the lock, your turrets become hostile and then they can level it just like they do now.
---
Sorry for the late request, but can you make it 3 Adrenal Reaction serums? My team mates want one as well.
---
Drat, I'm on PC
---
it must be new, I just killed one today, this is interesting because noones done so before-hand except you three hours ago and me at this very moment.
---
Yay backpacks! I’m excited for this to finally be in the fallout series ☺️
---
Oh hon. You're calling me stupid because some people had to server hop more than you did. Think about yourself.
---
Tbh I like both ways of playing, there’s something rewarding about playing in a team but as an Fo3 and FO4 player I love the feeling of hopeless loneliness the game provides at time. How about you?
---
Yeah, thankfully My camp is open to the public, but I can see a lot of newer players getting ganked because of it.
---
Best if you guys are in the same spot. Cells reset if unoccupied, and the time length before it resets can be very short. I’ve done essentially what you suggest, and when I loaded in with the second character, the paper bag was there, but it’s contents would never load. Just endless spinning wheel.
---
They've cut off Vault Boys hand in the Wave emote to use as the Bye emote.
---
Or it's the fact that they're charging for it.
---
So that’s what the mysterious quills were for! I found some stuck in a Brahmin, and was wondering what they are, that’s pretty cool!
---
The sheepsquatch is definitely real! Just seen one in the wild.
---
Bloodied DBSG, 15% FF, 33% VATS or caps for the chameleon left?
---
I had only -50.
---
Lol new players have no idea what we did. Artillery box duping was kinda most absurd.(of the stuff I know, IMO)
---
Of course. I'll be sure to have at least 3 on-hand around 5pm.
---
Plans for the Sheepsquatch weapon mods also drop from the event.  So far I've gotten the Burning Barbed Sheepsquatch Staff mod, +energy/bleeding/damage.
---
https://imgur.com/a/Yz16WEK
---
I found him just outside whitesprings between the golf course and the fissure site! Lured him into whitespring and got extra help from the lovely employees.
---
does this event give any unique loot?
---
I think fishing stations are the most likely option based on how they usually code things. Being able to do a scouts quest and unlocking a fishing station for my CAMP that would allow me to harvest "fish" be incredibly useful.
---
Yeah, there's a respawn timer, but I'm a little iffy on the specifics. I tend to hop until I either get something I want or get bored. Then I just leave it until the next day to try again.
---
Grafton Steel is the only place that I have tried farming BoS stuff because I'm usually over there snagging the Workshop the steel and because it's a relatively easy location to get to. As for other spawn locations, someone wrote up this farming guide that has proven useful (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ae920w/plan_farming_guide/). Maybe there's something in there that can help you.
---
buddy of mine was moving caps to another character last night and lost about 8k caps to the wind, the two didnt realize that it happened when going over the cap limit and one was sittin on around 18k when he tried to take the 15k  being moved between characters.
---
so your not the only one to feel this needless cap limit issue. wasnt me and i wasnt involved in the trade but could still feel the pain of their loss, and sorry for yours as well.
---
Yep I'm leveling a charisma character for whenever raids become an actual thing.
---
Just do you dawg
---
4k total buy-in and 25k total reward? Will you guys be able to sustain this? I wish I could join :(
---
The was an accident on their part, we should have never been able to craft them without learning the recipe (which is not in game) or buying/finding a MiscMod.
---
Other than trading for large items in private player economy there's absolutely no reason the average player would actually NEED more caps than that though so I don't really see how this is an issue for most people.
---
:)
---
That’s what I figured, I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t changed
---
Lol. What’s your source? At best Bethesda’s said “your game might not run right”. 
---
I’ve been running Perk Loadout Manager and Better Inventory since launch, and Save Everything for a few months. Zero bans or any issues. I just have to stay informed with every patch, because it’s pretty regular now that every patch means either I have to update my custom.ini and/or some mods get broken until they’re updated.
---
I think it'll operate similarly to how fermenters work, in that it stays in your stash it's just flagged to show up for sale in the vendor.
---
Nice for you to mention that, I've thought about making a post about it.
---
Did you see the recent video tests with heavy weapon TSEs here?(don't have link, but it was posted like less than 24 hours ago) Explove flamer has nut rate of fire and range. Explosive flamer killed the mirelurk queen he used as target for all the tests, went down fastest, about 3 seconds. It would work nearly every range.(yeah I've noticed that range with explosive shotguns)
---
Do you think there is &gt;5% chance that thing won't be nerfed hard? Right now they've let it be, because the ammo is hard to get. It's not common enough problem.
---
But the ammo is of course going to be fixed for normal flamers to be used.
---
Right. I figured, but I didn't know if you factored in the Gloam soap.  The Bomb Berries can't be counted on  That's why I said it varies with placement of center blast. Prime is the best for violet and I usually can get over 200 there.  Another good place to get violet is nuke the Generals Steak House.  Don't bullseye it, just put it at about 11 o'clock and have the upper Eastern arc edge of the blast stop halfway between RobCo and the road. I can get well over 100-120 fom this and colalt, Yellowcake and crimson from the Generals garden but not in large quantities.  Best part about it is there are relatively few enemies that spawn.  Super Mutants in the Steakhouse, Mirelurk Queen in the swamp behind, but she won' spawn unless you get close to the pond or the ruined shack  and maybe a few yogi's and a Deathclaw, but that's about it
---
Ignore that dude, I’ve had zero issues, I run 3 of the most popular mods and have since launch.
---
Hand scanner in elevator is also gone once I’ve taken the elevator down
---
ah this needs to happen lol
---
Black Squad on Steam has a good system. The days you log in don't have to be consecutive. You get a key to open a lootbox (yeah, I know, but they just contain skins of weapons you can buy with the credits you get from playing matches) after 31 days, so in the end it doesn't really matter if you miss a day.
---
Nope. I’m calling you stupid because you don’t understand the fundamental difference between liars and those who are simply mistaken. Seems fairly basic. Also, note that I never served hopped for the quest. I said that I got lucky and found it at the fourth location I checked. Same server.
---
Man great question. All the noise about it..never even thought about this. Thats gonna be a big plus if that mechanic . I mean i know i enjoy selling p2p. So if this is the way it works..id just over price everythibg and keep it in there for storage if necessary. But i bet tjis was probablt why it got pushed back lol
---
I agree, but after a while of server hopping it was easier for me to just head to each location systematically until I found it.  They really want finding this thing to be an accident, but it would be more in line with their other new content for it to just be one static location.
---
I don't know why exactly, but PC has HUGE inflation. Caps are essentially worthless. You can buy junk with it, maybe ammo, but no one will sell anything good, and TSE isn't even very good. Most people would want like a QE double barrel or a bloodied / explosive for pvp. You can sometimes get a TSE Handmade or .50 Cal for 20-25K if you're lucky, but that's an exception, not the rule.
---
Well, they haven't removed it yet, and they can still remove or replace the legendary mod in future.
---
But yeah, it melts any enemy extremely quickly
---
The game is free to play. They would rather you NOT play if you never buy atoms. So yeah, you’re doing exactly what they want. Good job.
---
Yeah, I have to see if you can build in a taken workshop. I'll try it later. You don't go wanted anymore for attacking a player before contesting at the bench. You used to go wanted for that, but now you take full damage instead. It's bent toward the attacker in adventure because he doesn't take damage either even in the boundary until he attacks.
---
Did testing yesterday bug STILL exists, I brought this up in the last bug roundup. VERY EASY TO REPRODUCE BETHESDA.
---
1. Make tesla rifle with automatic barrel
---
2
---
Not when you leave the server because I transfer items in suitcases , idk the time limit tho .
---
I'm so glad to hear somebody else is at least experiencing something similar. I have no idea the exact conditions for the glitch, all I know is that it has happened to me at least twice, and it involves duplicating one of the chassis I have in my inventory... In my case it is always unfortunately the lower level chassis. I'm still trying to find a way to replicate it so I at least have video evidence, but I haven't been successful yet.
---
ha, I know...
---
Sorry to break it to you but it’s not an mmo
---
Hahahha 32 kills is ridiculous?
---
I use to stay by the sunken haven church that was next to a unmarked train cart bunker
---
If that baby Mothman backpack skin doesn't end up in the game I'm going to be so sad.
---
What is it?
---
Gift it to a random lvl 30/35
---
don't TSG him pls
---
Oh that's different. This is still very high traffic sub. 
---
Simple questions are seen only by people browsing threads by time order. 
---
Anything on the default top views, needs to appeal to large audience.
---
It comes with the effects on the gun already
---
That should have had a day one cosmetic item. OR maybe a BETA tester item. Such a shame for the missed opportunity.
---
The fact you can, or can't build one?
---
I mean, it sort of is a legendary. It has a legendary effect, it’s just not displayed like most legendaries are. Same as with The Gutter.
---
Check my sales post, I have the crook plan, but also the Sheepsquatch Staff
---
I've played all the fallouts at some point with new Vegas being my favourite. 
---
I've always wanted to share my fallout experience with another and fallout 76 had big boots to fill!
---
He popped up on me just now randomly in the wild. I was heading to Westek; I see him talking as he was starting a fight with a bunch of legendary super mutants at the overlook above Ripper Alley. Scared the hell outta me! He's a tank, but we finally got him. Then I killed them. Lol
---
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh9tzr/they_claim_there_will_be_a_refrigeration_mod_on/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to the text documents incase you prefer it that way.
---
Wonder if they added a breakage modifier to explosive weapons...  
---
Can't confirm due to lacking an TSE handmade, but if I can get some "pile on" I'll document and post...
---
You da real MVP Dinkles. You have my favor and my backup in any respect, in the unlikely event it will ever be needed. ,&lt;3
---
Dude, this is blowing my mind. I think my TSE Handmade was 6k and my TSE Lever action was 6k. IDK how much my Bloodied Lever action was.
---
Is this why i found like 20+ plans in a suitcase once? If so, i feels bad
---
All y'all can find the sheepsquatch but not the zillion other threads about it.  It must be really easy to find.
---
Yep I don't need that but a lot of people would do.
---
Thanks for the info! Much appreciated!
---
FYI - if you nuke so that the south-eastern edge of the nuke hits fissure prime, and fight SBQ at Forward Station Delta, you can also nuke the Abandoned Train Yard or w/e it's called. Decent chance of some good mobs there, and south of that train yard there are 3-4 patches of violet flux in the patches of trees. Just that are alone can net 150+ violet flux and it takes only 2-3 minutes to gather it. You could theoretically have a friend hold the server and give low lvl alts hazmat suits and have them run around collecting it as well (can get it on as many characters as you have). I've done this and gotten over 700 violet flux in about half an hour.
---
I just couldn’t think of the name “gloam soap” but I included it in the 15.  Two between the enclave entrances (and 3 pods), 1 near the NE entrance, and 2 between the cabins and the super mutants.
---
You want caps?  That sounds interesting.
---
It may not currently be an issue for most people but it discourages player interaction... Espicially with the Player Vending coming up. People requested that like crazy, and if they plan on streamlining the trading process with vending machines why not raise the Cap limit? I think long term it makes no sense to cap it when they could encourage more interaction between players via trading by increasing it
---
Thanks for the help! I’ll see if can manage to get one!
---
I can, it is an atom shop item, and the only one I can build at other people's CAMPs.
---
Idk I went with LMO(limited multiplayer online) because it’s not massive(25 player limit)
---
That's awesome! Are you on pc?
---
Hell no.
---
If you have two pieces it’s completely negated apparently. And if you do have two pieces you don’t need goat legs. Just gathered this from another post but haven’t tested it myself
---
My main problem lately is glowing mass, hardened mass, high radiation fluids and most especially the weight of glowing mass.
---
And make player to player trades require one item going each way to make the trade work .. you wouldn't believe how many times I've agreed on a trade and the person shuts there Xbox off or leaves the game before I can accept my end of the trade from the window ... Everything has to be for caps to ensure you don't get ripped off which sucks .
---
Same and same
---
I will
---
Someone posted this the other day. I uploaded and used it to find the girl [https://imgur.com/X4ecqTS](https://imgur.com/X4ecqTS)
---
I guess there's a guy too from what I've read. She was in Appalachia cemetery after a few jumps.
---
Maybe but more likely it was someone doing what you were doing . I don’t like to think about em disappearing so I drop a bag and make a lowbie look at it
---
I was alone and even though I failed the event I killed the two Sheepsquatches. They are really hard to kill and their loot sucked.
---
I was there when it happened. I thought they'd patched the pa glitchiness but looks like it's not quite fixed yet
---
I think it basically comes down to duping. Dupers made billions of nuka cola and would litearlly just drink them to fill themselves up on caps whenever they wanted, and all that got dumped into the economy, along with all the people running pre-nerf Whitesprings. I'm sitting on over 100K caps myself and don't really have much to spend it on because people don't want caps for their trades. I could offer 125K caps for a BE or B25 .50 Cal and no one would bite, guaranteed.
---
You can mod it with “shrouded” which is like a combination of Ultralight and Shadowed. So it massively boosts your sneak. Best is finding some weightless wood armor, chameleon mutation, Shrouded on all of it. Massive stealth bonuses... but no other bonuses &gt;.&lt;
---
You're going off about people claiming things that aren't true. Your word choice before this last post was very accusatory. Paragraphs of ranting about people whining and being too lazy to think. Suddenly you don't mean people are lying on purpose. We're just too stupid to understand how the game works. Even though many of us have been playing Fallout games for over a decade and have hundreds to thousands of hours in game. You get lucky on an RNG roll and suddenly everyone else is making stuff up.
---
I don't care what you chose to do to get it. Other people chose to server hop. People that didn't are out hundreds of caps. And you're saying they're stupid because reasons.  Some people got it first try. Others took more work. You can think everyone is whining and too stupid to think. Doesn't make it so.
---
Would love to see this. BDO implemented afk fishing. Would be cool to have some afk activities too.
---
also could just be people that land in your server to play with friends get the "your camp cannot be placed" go to it find yours and they destroy camp to get you to leave server so they can come back in and get their spot with their friends.   
---
seen this happen from time to time, whitesprings has alot of camps on it all over the place most i see are down around the snake on the map. everyone likes the nice green manicured lawns, wall, defense robots, close to nukes and so on.
---
Oh, good. That makes a lot more sense.
---
Dont think it works like that. Pretty sure they are calculated individually. So 2 50% fall damage pieces only take away 75% of the damage. But while stacked on top of goat legs it only gets down to ~98.5%
---
With the plans for it you can craft a level 50 version, but it’s still not great
---
Omg you’re amazing
---
As one of the pre-order BETA players, I feel like we got a bunch of good stuff for sticking around.
---
It would be pretty cool if Bethesda did special anniversary or "birthday" items (preferably not a giant mascot head or lousy t-shirt) for fans that stuck with them through an entire year of ups and downs.  Maybe an engraved or pinstriped power armor skin, a unique recipe for a food or drink item (an aged barleywine comes to mind) or some kind of little trophy to be placed in your camp.  Nothing too crazy, but cool enough for vets to show off and say "I stuck around when most didn't".
---
I have lost 14 items since launch to this bug and its getting old.  I wont bother with tickets as a pet usb rock is more competent.  Most i dont care about and at this point its faster to move on.  Its not me dropping the items or selling them either.
---
I liked the photo the modders had when they put it on the deathclaw skeleton. It looks so silly =\]
---
Pro tip for hoarders like me. Make all mods on your weapons and armor standard... Ultra light mods on all your armor... BAM! Like 100 space opened up
---
TBH that's not a term I've ever heard before or something that Google shows any results for, so it's pretty hard to use.
---
I think most people get what I mean if I say MMO in the context of this forum even if it's not totally accurate, whereas LMO would just be confusing.
---
Thanks for the post, will try and replicate (and I hope some people will pile on for confirmation if I can't)
---
1) Ironically people have been posting there is a exploit that allows you to double the stat gain from a similar issue.  
---
2) They fixed a couple other issues, but did you have the paint applied? For a while you could add it even without it on.
---
3) You mean the fact they Die?
---
Like, the spoiler is in the title lmaoo!!!!!! What are yall doin!!!!!
---
Southern belle motel in the mires and fred's bbq shack in savage divide
---
At Lvl 10-30 I liked it and modded it a bit, but eventually migrated away.  lvl 42 now. I like the faster attack rate, so I have held onto a lvl 50 ski sword.
---
These days it’s easier to one shot a lot of low level creatures with a plane old super sledge I salvaged off a super mutant.
---
&gt; They seemed more like a distraction from the shitty business model and lack of content.
---
*cough*
---
To be fair though, lots of content, still weak on end-game content.
---
When I first heard about this game , I envisioned it as permanent servers your characters were bound to with massive player made cities . Still fun tho
---
Yup I missed it but I saw the quest marker
---
i started to drop all the 1stars bc my stash was 790 lol
---
That's cheating
---
Sent you a friend request
---
No, thank you.😊
---
Backpacks aren't going to the shop, mate
---
Lol. I just imagine a scorch beast coming in, picking up your ball slowly and just flying away with it.
---
These are the new non legendary, legendary items.  
---
Maybe??
---
Can we get pics please??
---
See you soon! Still here
---
1) Does everything freeze or just a hitch?  
---
2) millisecond or second or two?  
---
3) Weird, will attempt to replicate.
---
I hope, if you hear anything let me know..plz
---
What? You’re insane. I never went into thisookung for an argument and I definitely said that I *got fucking lucky* by finding the NPC at the fourth spot I checked. Choosing to server hop could yield quick results or it could be a slog. It’s RNG. The other shit you brought up about unproven horrendous bugs was out of left field. I never called anyone a liar but anyone who says they were one shot from full health is flat out wrong.
---
WOW! Surprised anyone picked up on that. Cheezy poofs was to easy.
---
Kinda would take away from the list imo, but ill add pics of the weapons in a while at the end
---
This is exactly what I’ve been hoping will happen.
---
There are actually two spawn spots within spitting distance of one another: in the lake about 10 feet from the western shore, as well as 50 southwest of the lake walking in a straight line toward the nearest fissure site. Both can spawn tamable animals but I found my snally in the lake itself.
---
Go to wavy willard's check the lot and server hop
---
For perks, Grim Reaper's Sprint lacks an animation or sound when it triggers. It just silently refills the AP bar without letting you know. Not sure if it's a bug or not but it probably is
---
Thanks I didn't see the other post sorry ^^
---
Bullshit.
---
He monetized the hate. Being a figurehead for the community and PROFITING off of it are two different things.
---
I'd like a plan for a trailer building set that spawns or can buy from vendors. Been wanting to build a Sunnyvale style dirty dance bar to sell all my excess booze and such... pretty apt since it's been raining mah fu#$ers recently with this new camera glitch.
---
This seems a little bit like a participation award.  I feel like the daily atom challenges already fill this role, except that you actually have to do something other than showing up.  I don't really like the idea of asking for something while expecting to do nothing to earn it.  
---
Some games do this, but they tend to be the very casual type and make their money on ad revenue, so luring players to at least open the app and be displayed a bunch of ads serves them well.
---
They can be a fun way to send a message.
---
For example, you don't like someone's base? Think it's terribly made? Plop a bag of fertilizer on their bed, add that lovely "you've been insulted!" Insult-bot note and now they know your thoughts.
---
I have to agree. It should be level + caps in wanted. This was how to get around paying in pvp (but you can see them on the map). The wanted level does go up as they destroy your base. 5 caps he destroyed like one thing.
---
I built a test base once that blended with the environment. Had a door to unlock and as long as it wasn't damaged looked like part of the game. Guys would always pick it and go wanted. The amount of traps you can make is so fallout, surprised you don't see it more.
---
I tried closing the game entirely (not just quitting to the main screen) and this fixed it. Also I should note that I’m on PS4.
---
There’s lots of video examples of two pieces negating fall damage completely [like this one](https://youtu.be/8gtbSfGqL3k). 
---
From what I learned today, goat legs doesn’t stack with those fall damage reduction perks. It reduces the base amount of fall damage by 80%. After that the armor pieces would reduce 50% of that remaining 20% of damage. So with goat legs and one piece you still receive 10% of fall damage. But if you just have two pieces of 50% fall damage reduction armor, even without goat legs, it’s still 100% reduction.
---
Thanks so much! Looked for hours yesterday
---
Why didn't they impose serious consequences for those people?

I'm sorry you can find good weapons with caps, that stinks man. Honestly I've hunted legendary weapons everyday and I've found only a handful of 3 stars and really none of them are even useful to me. If i wasn't friends with a girl I"d never find this stuff. I found one gun on reddit, my TSE LA and I had to offer 6k and that was almost not enough. I have no idea how you have that many Caps,a gain PC must be different.
---
He popped up on me just now too. I was heading to Westek; he was talking as he was starting a fight with a bunch of legendary super mutants at the overlook above Ripper Alley. Scared the hell outta me! He's a tank, but we finally got him. Then I killed them. Lol
---

---
Solo'd a legendary diseased one in cranbarry bog by fissure site. Dropped auto grenade launcher legendary and usual materials
---
Maybe when you sell a legendary to a vendor for tokens it will become purchasable from the vendor for tokens? Did they say anything that would preclude this possiblity? I can't remember.
---
It would be cool if that were the case, because then the legendary vendor would become the defacto trading hub for legendary items and it'd be even easier to buy people's discards.
---
and how it affects you that others can carry more things? or for whatever reasons they wear a PA
---
How do you get the plans?
---
Standard vending units will come with 150lbs of dedicated space.
---
500lb and 1000lb variants will be available inthe atom shop for 1000 and 1500 atoms respectively.
---
QoL, no advantage.
---
10% melee on basic meat + wood cooking, 15% if you throw in some pepper, boiled water, and carrots.
---
No and I'm on ps4 I checked my button layout and it's right so I'm not sure wat the deal is I've played about 8 hours like this I thought if it was like a negative effect of something it would have wore off by now but I'm gonna try some adictol when I get on later thats the only thing i havent tried I did disease cure and checked everything but so far havent figured it out
---
No problem!! Took me hours as well
---
Appreciate it.
---
Don't worry! It'll be Atom Shop only for 1800 atoms! ;)
---
Hmmm, ill have to recheck. Was almost positive I killed myself with fall damage just last night. 
---
Couldve just been the game fed up with me using the camera though.
---
SecondLife, Fallout style
---
Some good points here, thanks! I've made some tweaks, so hopefully this'll work out!
---
Another UI bug I've noticed (and still not fixed yet):
---
*If* you try to equip any of your own power armor *when* the last fusion core has already been drained (or you have no fusion cores left in your inventory) *then* your player character freezes for 1 minute (ie. until the power armor chasis returns to your inventory) *plus* you cannot perform any further actions on screen (eg. looting bodies) as the UI on-screen prompts do not appear. Only restarting the game will correct this problem.
---
This UI problem is also sometimes triggered by using heavy weapons (eg. 50 cal, gatling plasma) when aiming, firing then releasing the aim (so that the camera zooms back).
---
Last time there was double XP, I started a brand new level 1 character in Survival and was level 17 in a couple of hours. The bonus is no joke.
---
A lvl 252 player and I killed both pretty fast but he was using an explosive weapon and I was melee’ing them with my 500+ damage power fist.
---
Well, that's a fair assumption since caps are also non transferable outside of usage as currency.
---
I pretty sure it switches because when I did it it was just a wendigo and in the video it was the Flatwoods monster
---
Good deal, see you shortly!
---
The reason many items exceed 25k caps is because duping caused mass inflation of the in game economy.
---
My only worry is that tokens will weigh as much as bobby pins used to.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch fight. I finished it about 8-10 times before getting the plans. I have them now though and can make anyone on PS4 a level 50 one if interested. I low ball myself so it would be dirt cheap or free
---
Adventure or survival mode?
---
Sheepsquatch was activated today along with the double XP.
---
i used to play football (soccer) with the baloons at the fasnatch with a friend by just crashing against them lol
---
i would love they would let me build that mini soccer field from the vault and just play some shitty soccer with awfull physics in my camp lmao
---
What perks are you running? those damage #s... ;)
---
Still here! :)
---
You on PS4? I will buy 2 from you.
---
I'm interested
---
❌* STILL HERE, COME JOIN *❌
---
Gentrification is a son of a bitch.
---
I buy them from people, some give them to me, others I find. 
---
And I didn't know that about the endurance. Did you have to beat it? Makes me wonder about Grognak too...
---
Which ones can?
---
That place is awesome. It was so creepy when i came across that area
---
I know I was excas hell for this. My favorite part of the game is the Cryptids and folklore they used
---
I keep all until it dies away.
---
The concept image has both tire and rim
---
FO76 has much more going on than RD2O
---
Pretty sure it's not in the game yet
---
Right now the market is whack. I love to browse the market. The post for " W: XYZ H:caps" just make me laugh but sad at the same time. Horrid to imagine starting as a new player. If you want that amazing legendary, you best farm it yourself.
---
 If its a TSE it will degrade very fast. You did not specify the Legendary, and it makes a huge difference.
---
Not available yet, maybe whenever the Arktos basement opens.
---
I suspect there's been a large uptick in the number of players lately because I have characters with camps in four different spots and they all face the same issue. They need to reduce the no build area around camps and maybe around some of the marked locations to try to alleviate it a bit. I don't really want to have to build in the middle of nowhere away from any sort of features just to get a spot away from people.
---
they could start by doing a quest that "x" lake is saved from rads and their fishes are healthy. So you can only fish in that area to test it and then make some quest so you can clean the rest of the lakes who knows xd
---
Wouldn't it be just as likely to have an adverse effect on new players though? By not capping the limit, it increases their availability to long time players which makes buying highly valuable items that much further out of reach of new players, who let's realize are far more likely to want and need to shop at player vendors than experienced players.
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. ...
---
Arktos basement?? I haven’t heard anything on that care to explain or link to post about it??
---
It was not  TSE, shotgun and handmade were AAE and .50 Cal was FE. Will edit post to add that.
---
Is this a temporary event? Or is this one going to remain?
---
I have only had that happen when I disconnect. Then it does seem to reset. I have never had it happen when I die.
---
yeah i kinda agree, im not asking to be paid or want something of value or anything like that but what i would like to get would be say a sign, or cosmetic shirt or something saying "Beta" or can be linked to have been a beta or day 1 player.  
---
reason: sometimes when i am running solo on an alt, i dont wear my headset/mic and get followed by some lvl 20-50+ wanting to pass me off their junk, doin the whole bag drop and shooting at it, standing infront of me blocking ways and so on, not knowing my mules got lvl appropriate legendaries on him and 300+ of each crafting mat ive muled over when my main hits their materials cap, be nice since there is no "thanks, but no thanks" emote i could run to my lil 1 square shack point at wall with a "Beta" sign so they realize ive been around for awhile and go looking for another low level to heap their generosity upon.
---
Perfect thanks again!
---
Do shotguns break that fast? I always feel that shotguns are one of the more durable weapons. Though I do have luck of the draw perk equipped and it procs especially often when using a shotgun. Maybe something you might want to consider
---
They havent added the Camp Decorations yet.(For held items). So yea i cant show them till that happens.
---
some of the apparel. The high-end repair kit supposedly.
---
*My backpack's … got jets.*
---
*I'm Boba the Fette*
---
There is ALWAYS a wendigo as the boss at the end of One Violent Night event. Also common (though not every time) spawns in the downstairs locker room of the whitesprings golf clubhouse building and also upstairs in a building on the edge of Clarksburg (the edge of town near the shooting range).  I’ve also found a pair of wendigos randomly along a road in the Toxic Valley (when I was level 20ish). Best of luck
---
Would love some rail cars so I can build on a track somewhere, like the rail bridge near-ish top of the world.
---
From what I can remember,  I would compare it to a Chinese letter. A series of lines intersecting to form a symbol. Didn't look like anything in particular that I remember. I wanna find that pic! I'm at work but after I'll check my ps4 and my phone. I know I took one
---
Bloodied automatic explosive rifles are north of 50k.
---
r/woooosh
---
Also, sometimes dying when overencumbered at Harpers Ferry it forces you to respawn at the trainyard nearby to Whitesprings. Maybe it didn't have the your correct location when you died?
---
There's like 17 maybe 18 possible mutations you can obtain and I don't think you can ever have all those physical representations show up. there just ain't enough space on a human body lul
---
omg bro you are the one that brought other shit up. 😂
---
Awesome, a friend needs it so I'm heading your way
---
Just sounds like a name error
---
yeah, but don't worry. If you got all six eggs, you got the crafting recipe for the bunny head. They just quietly added it to the list of armor plans you know, there was no indication ingame that you received it (or if there was, I totally missed it myself).
---
Sweet sounds good buddy
---
And thanks much
---
Sorry. I mean the concept of people lying. About what? Server hopping and getting unlucky? Do you think that I don’t understand how RNG works or something?
---
Lvl 375 player with a 2000 cap bounty wearing a sheepsqatch impostor outfit and a bloodied/ss/str mole miner gauntlet shows up.

---
Robot:  "*Sigh*......Sign right here and please wait to be seated for orientation...."
---
One tip- the Leader of the Pack is a good event for around your level. You can get decent legendary gear around your level, and it isn’t too impossible to get through. Great xp from all those wolves too.
---
I too would love to see fishing added. I would spend quite a bit of time fishing, and money on atoms for fishing themed camp items.
---
That sux. I felt the same way for months but when my highness finally granted me a B/SS +1 str mole miner gauntlet, all was forgiven
---
Cough cough Ash Heap cough cough cough cough cough cough cough ... Excuse me, I live in the Ash Heap
---
Luck of the draw helps quite a bit since it seems that each pellet has a separate chance to trigger it, but it's unreliable and too random so I didn't wanted to use it in the test. You can go and test with a combat shotgun if you want, assuming that you use the same parameters listed here I predict that it won't last longer than 150 shots before it breaks.
---
there was a big herd of them there all with different numbers, and none of the videos I seen had those Brahmin walking along the path, so unless it’s a random encounter then I don’t know.
---
That's fine
---
I haven't seen the event yet, but I've encountered two Sheepsquatch in the wild within 5 minutes of each other. I can't wait to actually see the event.
---
Should’ve taken a bit more ;). Sorry for your loss- I did the same thing and accidentally flushed a few grand.
---
Thanks for the tip, just found him in there.
---
I did it once and thought it was hard. I wasn’t prepared from a weapon standpoint. I think if you assign someone to be the Brahmin herder and keep them moving while others kill the enemies that may be the way to go. Will have to try it again. I had two strangers with me, and we were level 56, 75, and 100+ and failed the event.
---
Yeah, the lvl 35 version does a couple points less damage, yet it gets thrown away out of hand.
---
I can confirm all of this, although the one by freds BBQ seemed to be much harder that the one by tanagra town, could just been luck tho
---
Where was this? Im getting blueballs from my lack of sheepsquatch encounters
---
Good tip. Personally I like to make the drinks from scratch. So i get a real feel for the questing aspect. Doing it like that isnt much fun for me. But thats just me.
---
Not sure why I got downvoted for just pointing out a simple fact... I even stated that I don’t use power armor myself lmao
---
no it's not I ran it. i did the work it's not cheating!
---
iv done the event 2 times in the last 10 min guess ill post if i get it
---
Realistically it would be best against energy but it would be neat to see a unique set like that
---
GT ResidentBaton68 got it
---
Ive seen juiceheads vid on it and he said he has seen it a lot, im just not having any luck
---
I don't feel so wood Mr Stark...
---
join me ill wait
---
How can you know that?
---
I mean you're literally calling me stupid and now you're getting defensive because you brought this entire thing up.
---
More than any freebie I want them to readdress the community and make us a set of promises that they actually stick to.
---
We need the community management folks to actually engage the community and start answering instead of ignoring the hard questions here.
---
Those two things are worth more to me as a customer and fan than any amount of Atoms
---
Yeah but my explosive combat shotgun last for days if not weeks without repairing if I combine gun smith and luck of the draw. Considering that explosive effect degrade weapons faster, non explosive shotguns gonna last for weeks without repairs. I really don't think that should be a thing.
---
No problem :)
---
Speaking of that is player immunity a thing if you're in pacifist mode now?
---
Most of them would be subtle! And in the case of some like the Grounded mutation need not appear at all!
---
Do you start that with the recall keycard? Or is this a different event
---
You can check by inspecting a weapon or armor.
---
Having the same problem on PC
---
I wouldn't rule out future content.  There's a lot of spots on the map that look like they should have names and map markers, but they don't.....yet.  The location to dig up Mire treasure map #1 immediately comes to mind, as does the sunken church east of Raleigh Clay's bunker.  There's also a large area north of Vault 76 that has several interesting shacks and structures that are as of yet unmarked, including a camp in the middle of a large crater.
---
lol I can tell you have yet to reach endgame if you think “nonPA users are still left in the dust”
---
Yeah thats not true bud. You def still get a wanted level, if you arent already at odds with that person. As soon as you attack another person or their camp, you get 10 cap wanted. Every attack after adds ten more. Im not sure where youre getting this full damage thing, but in adventure you take no damage until you retaliate. Unless they contend the ws. Ive read nor seen anywhere about you take full damage. Please give a link, if you have one.
---
I called you stupid because you somehow think that I think people are lying. About what? This is in a thread about the stupid camera quest. Do you think I’m under the impression that some people aren’t wasting their time server hopping 20+ times because of bad RNG? That’s entirely possible, even if it’s improbable.
---
True, but at that point why not just wear the version without the backpack?
---
Guess I was lucky when I read all this. I just wanted to enter Whitespring, saw a dude on a car and was like “hey that wasn’t here before” and voila, the quest started.
---
I definitely have the repair kits, I'm just not certain where they came from.
---
Truth, I mean it does have a huge number playing but the server limits really put a crunch on how massive it actually is.
---
I wish it was a true mmorpg
---
Xbox?
---
You all better be sporting your colors as often as you can. I used to routinely patrol in my BOS combat armor ( still my favorite look) so hope to see more of that out there
---
Yea probably from him. I got 6 from fighting SBQ 2 times. So I think you get them from “endgame” bosses.
---
adventure for sure, survival don't know, since I don't play it
---
i dont have the beth comment on hand but the BOS armor paints should come back in Patch 9
---
It’s called Letters and Numbers, sure fire way to tell if it’s the right one is the price tag. It always sells for about $9,600
---
It’s called signs and letters.
---
Then the meta would shift from server hopping to ethernet cable pulling
---
With bullet proof glass please. I swear a stiff breeze takes out razorgrain
---
Join the discord
---
💯
---
I thought so, but understandably wanted to be sure.
---
Hi,I'm not sure how it's called in English,cause My game is in Spanish,but i think it could be Lights and sings.
---
Hope I helped U.
---
Ive run into this twice already....both times they were walking down the path in the opposite direction of the event
---
I actually tried using Luck of the Draw 3 and Gunsmith 5 and while it did made a difference I didn't found it to be an extreme one. Are you using a Combat Shotgun or a pump/double barrel? If it's a combat one would you mind telling me that mods you are using? barrel/stock/magazine/etc maybe they make a difference. I would love for my shotgun to last for days without repairing it lol.
---
If on Xbox just got recent players and try to find one in the same server.
---
I triggered the battle on xbox a few minutes ago and we failed. Level players i remember seeing:  265 194 89 64 50. I think i'm 94.
---
If i had known i was about to start battle, i would've made a reddit announcement so high level players would see then join.
---
No he didnt. Like ive already said. No one took my workshop until server got shut down for maintenance. Love how confident your response was tho. I know all about the zone. Ive been playing this since it was available to buy (not preorder, release date).
---
Are you forgetting what your first 2 posts itt were?
---
What is a crook?
---
Thank you :)
---
did you reply to wrong person ?
---
My AAE shotty has horrible durability. I feel like it also isn't repairing to 200%, only 100. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
his hair looks like that because it is slowly being abducted by ALIENS
---
Got all the bos gear lol
---
Thats what i believe it was as well.
---
Just pretty shocking to see dude building. I dont mind neighbors, but damn. Thats ON my shit lol.
---
I’m not entirely sure about that. I think the responders were always under-resourcesd, but shared knowledge with even the most clueless wastelanders to help people be able to survive on their own (teaching the benefits of cooking food and purifying water, for instance). Ultimately their group was too small to have bigger impact.
---
clearly you don't get it then \^\^ but good luck with however you choose to play
---
I would imagine it to be very possible at level 15 with raider power armour and an explosive shotgun without cheating.
---
Thank you for the purchase!
---
Which apparel?
---
The high end kit in the game is better than the shop version, they have different item nomenclature.
---
Ah, I'm just trying to find a pricing for them, but no I just played it and it gave me +1 endurance
---
Have you ever played other games? Especially ones that cost $60?
---
Gonna still drop your junk as usual, I'd assume so at least as they haven't mentioned any new mechanics like that.
---
Different
---
Same here!
---
its still funny
---
Obviously, you're not a Big Lebowski fan
---
I have died quickly, but it has never been from a single instance of damage. 
---
I have also seen people use fast travel protection to sprint up three flights of stairs and shoot me on the roof of a high school.
---
I'm not quite sure how your experience is different from mine.
---
A legendary just spawned for me outside Camp Venture. Dropped a 1* ghoul slayer golf club.
---
https://imgur.com/gapNMNa
---
I stay away from train stations. Too many campers that can’t play normally there
---
My camp glitched, and now i live in the toxic valley. the neighbors are toxic, and the atmosphere is poison. also i live near a mirelurk queen
---
I went to groves cabin and didnt see the event anywhere. Does it only spawn some of the time?
---
the tan trailers with the sliding doors or the green pop up trailers would be an amazing addition. Im kind of annoyed they removed the shack building set that was in fallout 4 because you could build really good builds with it that fit the world really well.
---
It's this^^^
---
Will this affect good with salt or add to its bonus?
---
The prefabs from FO4 sucked, I can't imagine they wouldn't suck here.
---
if they could add snap points to rails so you could place cars on them that would be amazing
---
Its called the Bear Arm, players have obtained it through the dev room: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/553183183005548579/556312095361335388/20190315_221523_HDR.jpg
---
Nice, almost enough to pick up your mom.
---
Where is your CAMP at? Are you set up with turrets at Whitespring?
---
Didnt they specifically say they only dropped from sbq currently in the notes?
---
Not that i dont think he should drop them as well, just didn't think he would yet.
---
That’s true, but at the same time, how often is the shed itself in the blast zone. To use that weapon bench you have to get out of your PA (if wearing PA), getting irradiated if you aren’t wearing a Hazmat suit underneath. Then you may have to wait in line for others to repair their weapons, all while the SBQ is reeee-ing and crop dusting you. Or sitting on the ground wondering why you haven’t started DPS-ing her.
---
Yes more spotlight on this issue thumbs up. Lost 2 really good peices that made my builds.
---
Like a cane
---
I mostly upvote Aliens references... mostly.
---
Reminds me of Metro. I like it
---
Extra points for the directors cut!
---
Re-read and yeah it’s a bit confusing because I went on a bit of a tangent. Fact is I don’t think anyone is a liar, I think that they’re either mistaken, whining, or uninformed. Having an NPC that’s part of a tourist based quest spawn at a random tourist hotspot on each server is just fine. Walk around a bit for goodness sake. Is playing the game a bad thing? Is there not adventure to be had by hunting for something?
---
Not sure how to link it but look up 76market
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised
---
Good question - I should have clarified. Definitely not close to Whitesprings or with a comparably obnoxious set-up.  I’d definitely understand the dressing down if that were the case.
---
Pretty far away from everything and quite innocuous!
---
I had the same problem being near Top of the World. I enjoyed my time scouting for a good spot and have myself a nice cliff where I can watch all the action from now. That being said, I miss my first real camp location sometimes.
---
Text Chat Mod  on F76Nexus
---
Actually I fought SBQ too so maybe that makes more sense.
---
Yeah! No more splash damage, except in workshops
---
You play to many phone games
---
I found one right by Welch. Right by the overseer's house. Legendary 1 star lvl 50. I'm only 28 on this character so not sure if that's just the lowest it can be when spawning.
---
Amazing animation attacks and love the enraged mechanic, though I wish it kept the pissing attack, it would've been hilarious to have an animal damage you by pissing from it's junk.
---
Did you do get the heavy Gunner perks yet? I'm around that level, have all of those perks so I'm working in getting melee and shotgun ones since they fit well with high stength.
---
That would be my guess.
---
&gt;They are currently dropped as loot by the Scorchbeast Queen and may be added as rewards for other types of in-game content in the future.
---
Straight from the notes.
---
I try to mod my shotgun so that it has best range/accuracy as possible, minus the stock. Don't wanna lose durability bonus from a forceful stock. What I noticed is that my aae handmade break a lot faster with same amount of usage. that thing breaks fast
---
Bahaha yes
---
The explosive damage  prefix  for shotguns is glitched as well in pvp. It's rediculous.
---
:) I dont normally get all ranty and I have to say your guide is spot on for the most part. the only thing I would add to your guide is that if you arent going to defend it never spend past the workshop resources. you get paid to clear it if its a power plant you can get double the caps by completely fixing everything and if you stay under budget and dont get whacked it can be very profitable. the sting comes when you invest a ton of mats and still lose it to invader or server disconnect.
---
I don't trade gear with players that aren't on /r/Market76 and have at least a couple positive karma and 0 negative karma.  It's way too easy for someone to agree to a deal over area chat and after that it's purely based on faith.  
---
If the trade system was set up so that the deal wasn't complete until both parties agreed to a confirmation (like an online handshake), that would help considerably.  Sometimes Market76 traders aren't trying to skimp me, they just hadn't realized that the trade window closed down without me grabbing my end of the deal.  (random trade window exits happen for some reason)  Luckily the players on Market76 are pretty honest, and if I mention that I didn't get to grab my gun, they reopen the window and try again, or immediately rejoin me on the server to honor the agreement.
---
With the current system, I would never, never, never do high end trades with random players without being able to look over the item being offered in detail.  I'll risk trading common commodities, but never legendary gear.  It's way too easy to claim a gun is AA/Exp/reload when in reality it's AA/whatever/whatever.  The same works on my end.  Even if I'm being completely honest, the player can't see for themselves and has to accept that I'm telling the truth.  The trading karma system on reddit is a good benchmark.  No one that wants to trade with any level of trust is going to intentionally risk losing a "AAA rating" so to speak.  Even one blemish casts a level of doubt.  If they have two, I refuse the deal no matter how good it is.
---
For console? No you have to risk getting ripped off because Bethesda cares very very VERY little about in-game economy or about its fans getting scammed by untrustworthy teens! (Haven’t ever got scammed I barely trade but on Xbox I’ve seen a HUGE increase in people complaining about scammers &amp; all types of stuff..) not good with player vending coming next month
---
I believe whole is on beta it will suck. When the alpha comes out it will be seasonal so only new characters will be allowed. Once this happens it should be more playable. They are just testing servers with OP builds right now.
---
You can't say the level 10 did the nuke solo then.
---
Any tourist attraction I think.
---
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG AND THEY EVEN MADE IT CUSTOMIZABLE
---
I think i know the area lol. I always crouch walk through there.
---
I’m going hunting later
---
It would be super easy to add to existing cooking stations, too
---
The two need to come hand in hand otherwise popular vendors will get griefed while they try to sell.
---
I'm sorry...it just sounded funny to me
---
I was about to ask the same...
---
Hahaha yeah same. I’ve done maybe 25 SBQ’s in 2 weeks &amp; I’ve gotten ZERO serum recipes (although I think I saw a post saying it isn’t even in her loot pool anymore) but the legendaries I get are pipe rifles with vats Crit &amp; bullshit. I can’t wait for the legendary vendor (hoping he can help us with getting at least somewhat better roles on these things because man am I tired of it
---
Depends. There’s no slap damage anymore, but if you own a workshop and someone else has a friend in their team, the friend can challenge the workshop while the someone else kills you. It’s a stupid exploit that will probably be patched soon.
---
oh dear Lord, I'm afraid to ask what it'd be worth. how about 900 caps and my gratitude forever..?
---
It seems a small thing but I really like having some believability in terms of how I'm lugging stuff around. Can't wait for my backpack!
---
Those green mobile building things would be cool to build in, the one in the Morgantown airport had a nice studio apartment vibe.
---
No.  I guess that’s next.
---
I’ve done 7 in the last 2 hours so you’re getting unlucky. But the worst is finding a server on it &amp; literally nobody is doing it besides you.. try killing 12 bloodbugs before at least one Brahmin is dead. Maybe heavy weapons builds are better since they spray but my all melee guy can’t even land a hit on the fucking bugs lol
---
FYI... “alpha” comes before “beta”. Typically, alpha is the state where new stuff is being added and changed while beta is polishing up the product. Public alphas are rare. Some software stays in beta forever, lol.
---
Are your CAMP budget and STASH budget separate, or are they tied together? I feel like I don't have a ton in my STASH but I'm pushing the limit. Wondering if I need to downsize my CAMP a bit.
---
What about a Toy Alien? Or Jangles?

Shotgunner fall behind rifle builds way to muCh to be viable. Don't mean to break ur bubble but I did  Main  shotguns and it just doesn't compare Sadly.  The biggest reason is the  range for shotguns is too short. You will get  out gunned by a good player especially since the map is so open and vast.
---
Your best bet are maps.  Unless I’ve missed something (which happens in this game...) the t45 pieces are pretty rare to find as standalone plans.
---
You’re still able to get in the dev room? Is it still an insta-ban? Funny how Bethesda prides themselves on ridding duping when the dev room thing is 1000x worse haha
---
I didn’t get this???

Iron man dies in Avengers endgame.

One of the new faction vendors in Whitesprings has all the PA mods. I think it's the Brotherhood or Responder one- can't remember.
---
\&gt; while you won’t be able to see it while wearing Power Armor, you will still benefit from its carry weight bonus and the current utility mod you’ve applied 
---
While I love being able to still get the buff, can we have a reason to get out of power armor yet? I'm disliking that 99% of end game is just power armor game play and 99% of that is X-01 too.
---
..it'd be doubly cool if we could make it our actual toon skin..I'd love to run around the wasteland with open running sores.. wouldn't have to worry so much about people wanting to tag along then :)

Juicehead made it sound like it was a common event since he did 6.
---
Hi
---
Ok, cool. I know there are certainly people that have no idea what is going on. Just look at the people shooting the Sheepsquatch before the pylons are covered. 
---
But not everyone that has an issue with bugs or whatever are whining, bitching or stupid. 
---
I've got over 600 hours in game. Sure, I don't know everything. But I've certainly experienced bugs.
---
 And I don't find spending tons of caps fast traveling to and fro very adventurous. I started out looking for the Tourist naturally. I went to 4 touristy spots. Then I looked here to see if people had found him and where. I went to Kelly's monument, the graveyard, and the fort, walking. Then I server hopped those locations a few times, walking between them. Then I decided to check Wavy Willard's. And since I'd already spent over an hour trying to get it more naturally, I started hopping at Willard's. Finally got it on something like the 20th hop. 
---
 If the weeklies/dailies weren't linked to getting the camera I'd have zero problem trying to find it "naturally". I'd be cool with wandering around for days hoping to see it in my travels. But we've had 2 weeks of challenges that weren't even possible without it. We've missed out on what, like 100-300 Atoms already, somewhere around there. But I don't have 8+ hours a day to play. I've got work and stuff. So I do what I can to get the dailies in a couple hours per day.
---
lol good luck finding someone to buy it for more than $0.50, yes it was getting better until the repair box drop where Bethesda broke their cosmetics only in atom shop promise.
---
😂 you a sucka if you think the creation club is anything but a cash grab from Bethesda...Im a long time fan of Big Beth, but they took a turn for the worae when they realized that the community modders would fix their games for them -- leading to them just pumping out more titles on a dated engine...the Creation Club is literally just Bethesda "partnering" with the top modders to make "official content" for games that couldnt make them anymore money -- Enter FO76 that now has Microtransactions...where is your Creation Club now? Not needed in this title because now they can just dump shit down our throats themselves without wasting man power on old content.  Just think about it for like, I dont know, 2 seconds and you could see that Bethesda has been learning from EA
---
It would only be a temporary fix.  The best way to fight inflation in a game economy is to give people a way to spend thier money that takes it out of circulation. Something like a vendor that sells a rotating stock of unique outfits or weapons (think the gutter, or the fixer, but max lvl) that are only available for a limited time and priced relatively high. This would hopefully create a drain for the caps in circulation while allowing player merchants to speculate on which items will become rare and desirable.
---
Because for some outfits that's not an easily accessible option.  The Traveling Leather Coat and Leather Coat are each 0.02% drops off of specific Mire/Free State events.  Sure you could try trading for the other version, but until we get item for item trades I wouldn't trust many people.
---
So do you have to keep the crook equipped and keep spamming the herd button?  That might’ve been my problem. I’d herd them, get attacked, switch to a weapon, fight them off, repeat.
---
I mean I was just commenting on my preference. I never stated i support the Atom Shop, so your rant is null and void on me.
---
I said I like it because I don't have to spend money, and you get on me about spending money in game?
---
When this happens to me they kind of just die somewhere else like their body will move to a location maybe where they should have been or something
---
The problem people have is not with the repair kit itself, it’s Bethesda breaking the cosmetics only promise.
---
It's the underground area that's not the Burrows in the wild Appalachia trailer, don't believe there's been any official announcements on it yet but search for the recent data mining threads which have all of the info that's currently in game.
---
seriously what they should do is have a log in rewards every week we should have challenges like - completed 5 events with others - logged in 5 days - played 5 hours - basic thanks for sticking with us rewards
---
Better yet give us repair kits as well for them as well so people have a few on them at all times. 
---
Also.... can I get a canvas or nylon skin for my backpack and a nuka dark rum flair key chain for it
---
But for real, I played beta and have played every week since release and as far as I know I haven’t gotten anything for free, atoms or apparel. What is the classic collection?
---
Which terminal?
---
Heya, sorry I didn't get back, I'm honestly thinking of buying more as a backup, would buy spares for 1k each?
---
Can you run into issues using mods with fo76 because it is all online?
---
I think those who destroy camps should be banned! Period.
---
We all remember how well ESO's sub went haha
---
Maps? Do you mean treasure maps or?
---
they need to have a system that detects known plans you have and give a 50% chance you get a new plan this would give people more new plans but still give them a few to hand off to others as well 
---
also plans should be 0 weight
---
Jims1973, I think, sells them
---
I was rocking that EXACT outfit yesterday, i see u are a fashionable wastelander too
---
Hence me saying high end. And I'm not listing them all but clown outfit for one
---
My last play no one was killing anybody. 0 player kills all around and 2hr+ alive. And it was always like that in adventure mode.
---
Totally, I always assumed that was the delay, but I’d risk it because I want them so bad haha :)
---
They could have turned invisible too. Happened to me with a mole rat.
---
thanks for the reply
---
I didn’t? Lol
---
Was asleep till just now, haha
---
Did mods pull me down??
---
Yup since the update it has gotten very bad cause I’ll snipe them and run up where they died and. No where to be seen..sucksss
---
Ditto... lean into the event already reaching the farm. Several high level players involved ended it fairly quickly. I was on the lower end of levels at 179...
---
Also that's a hell of a way to say they call them different things
---
When can I find it, I'm itching to see this magnificent creature?
---
If my visual is correct.... A Horny Butt
---
Thanks for the info, first run underway now
---
I'm setting up a discord now.  I'll be messaging you all in a bit!
---
Oh, well yes, I like to be funny, even when it's unintentional.  
---
I thought you were just, well, unimpressed...
---
I don't want to disappoint people, or bore them.
---
There’s no mention of player vending so clickbait lol
---
 Add Plan: Burning Sheepsquatch staff mod to your list - adds flaming damage to staff

Where you in the swampy area around top of the world

maybe get a lunch box ever sunday
---
Dude, most people are terrible human beings.  I don't claim to be a saint, but I try to be kind to others.  It seems like Reddit brings out the worst in people.  I've learned to NEVER engage in debate on Reddit, because it always leads to the ass-end of Shit Row.
---
Nope! South central east.
---
That sucks, but I like the outdoor brewery idea, might steal it when I can build anything else at my camp.
---
Take off the fucking tinfoil hat.
---
HAHAHA 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
---
it isnt as visible on the plague one, but if you check the looks for the other 3 outfits they REALLY change stuff up (lots of spikes, engravings ect) which would be really time consuming to apply it to every suit.
---
i had the same mindset as you till i was the other 3
---
Sometimes you see a nonviolent survival server.
---
Sometimes griefers set up shop at Whitesprings.
---
The areas around the stations should be pvp restricted.  Spawn camping is griefing pure and simple and will ruin your fun quicker than anything.
---
The endless spinning only happens to paper bags who's owner isn't in the same world as you and dropped it before you join. I have transferred stuff between characters multiple times with most of the times not having a player close by and I have yet to lose anything. I still consider it a risk, so I never transfer items in bulk so that if a transfer fails I would only lose a couple things instead of half of my inventory.
---
That’s a start. But I want a refrigerator that preserves food items.
---
Backpack mods are cool, though. Sign me up.
---
But two shot explosive laser rifles are, I just gave an example
---
Forgot to mention to use world containers, not bags, so that doesn't happen.
---
I would also love to know. That helmet is sweet
---
A terminal in one of the whitesprings homes. 
---
Inside the door you throw a left and in the room is a terminal and a glass cabinet next to it.
---
Gotcha, similar, but not exact
---
How do you scam on there? You open trade interface and put something up for caps
---
Just once or everytime
---
I hear ya , it’s definitely something I just made up but I’m sure if you look up the definition of mmo it wouldn’t fit
---
I got pictures of it if anybody wants to check it out
---
There are effects from fo4 they haven't used much/at all.
---
Wounding and staggering were and could be very powerful primary effects. Defiant was a great perk on low capacity weapons. 
---
Plasma infused, incendiary (except for perfect storm), and freezing could be added in the same slot as explosive, and could have damage scaled with power user or science perks. Incendiary could scale with fireproof. 
---
Poisoners could be useful in PVP, especially if scaling with plague walker mutation or vaccinated/natural resistance (would make those perks useful) 
---
More unique versions (or even plans/mods) of existing weapons but in alternative calibers would make good quest rewards, akin to the Fixer, like a .308 and 5.56 combat rifle or a .308 lever action.
---
Yeah I think you and I are largely on the same page. This quest wouldn’t suck if the amount of possible spawn points were limited to one of the areas of the map. Where, I don’t know. It does suck having to walk around the entire map when you have hundreds of hours already sunk into the game. However, it could also be pretty neat. If you choose to play with friends and divvy the areas up then suddenly you’re covering a hell of a lot more ground and can fast travel for free to one another. As I mentioned elsewhere, it’s not that the tourist simply doesn’t spawn. There’s just a ton of ground to cover because of all it’s possible spawn points. 
---
I too was, and still am pretty salty about them putting challenges in the game that are literally impossible to complete. It’s absurd that they let it go for days. Bethesda has made a ton of questionably awful choices. I just don’t think this (how to obtain this specific quest) is necessarily one of them.
---
7 days to die lol. I've given up hope of it being anything more
---
How long does it decrease thirst and hunger
---
Did it for you

Hmm.

So if I understand this correctly, if I disagree with you, my opinion doesn't count because i'm some sort of shill?
---
Or the Traveling Leather Coat.
---
Your statement is irrelevant. Based on your reply it seems that you did not watch the video. 
---
He is simply making light of the situation and poking fun at the people raging over this “pay to win” item. 
---
**”Breaking the cosmetics only promise.”**
---
Should anyone even be surprised? Everything about this game has been **broken** since before it was even released..
---
Wow didn't see that coming lol fun event
---
Tl;dr: The reports of this game’s death are greatly exaggerated.
---
Can we get tattoos that don’t look like cartoons
---
Not sure. Maybe at least one person does? Will have to do some experiments I guess
---
I'd suggest posting in /r/Market76. Lots of people trade through that subreddit since there's more tracking of good and bad traders and such; not that a small trade like this poses risk.
---
I should try again, haven't in a while but it shows up under effects Wastelad and shows how many minutes it's giving +1 endurance
---
Experienced this as well were you near an event by chance cause there is an exploit people use to make themselves non vattable
---
how do you get the mods for it? i've gotten it but only have standard
---
"but we got the legacy collection!!!!1!!!!"
---
Yay games that don't run the best on 64 bit systems which 76 requires, have all been free on many services multiple times, and can be bought for $10 at most with frequent sales. Those games are so different from modern fallout and especially 76 that I doubt a majority of players will even touch them if they haven't yet. Id be really happy to just get a ball cap that says 76 or "under construction" . There's a large number of is that paid $60 for a game that was being sold for $15 one week later.
---
I had the plan for barbed staff drop, but thats all so far. 32 runs
---
There's a persistent, common bug where if you kill a legendary enemy before it has a chance to do a legendary health regen, it has a tendency to disappear or fail to register the legendary loot pool.  If you're there by yourself, hit it a few times, let it regen and collect as normal.  If there's others in the group, get a baby hit with AoE damage or by using your weakest weapon (instigating bowie knife in my case) and let the others deal with it while doing something else productive.  If there's nothing else to do, just kick back for a couple seconds, let the health refill and blast away.
---
Sometimes legendaries seem to disappear all on their own, even if you gave them a chance at a "fair fight", but you're minimizing your chances at two different levels of disappointment by simply exercising a couple seconds of patience.  Ghouls and animals seem to be the most prone to random disappearing acts.
---
No one forces u to buy Atoms. Nice try
---
Just want to put in my vote for the tire and hubcap kthanksbye
---
And you’ll also see posts like this
---
ah, thanks!
---
Wait what the hell did they give us, I preordered it the day it was allowed to be and I even skipped school to play all the beta days and I didn't get jack sh!t
---
Same problem here, it's funny because my friend crashed and I said "Hahaha I've never crashed!" Then trashed 2 seconds after :\
---
The game has improved, the community is great (except for the person above), if anything you’re kind of getting the game for free so it’s worth it.
---
Black Desert Online uses that. And the rewards are good enough.
---
All I was saying is...If you (as in anyone reading the comment) think the Creation Club isnt a cash grab, then you a fool....dont take everything so personal internet guy...geeze
---
I'm glad we can have fun without you in the game.
---
Please stay in your mother's basement while you play with yourself.
---
😆
---
I blame the kid that made a wish for more inventory space...
---
Oh ok thank you didn’t know there was a new one
---
Got: Burning Barbed Sheepsquatch Club Mod
---
A game isn't dead because of what's happening on Reddit or what people think of a publisher/developer company (if that was the case then all EA games would have been dead already), a game is dead when nobody is playing it. I really doubt F76 will be dead anytime soon. Look at Lawbreakers for an example of a game that actually died.
---
I came across a player (think their username was “Just_Buddy” or something like that). They had their CAMP set up like a trading post near Whitesprings. Really good experience trading with there. They had a great selection of items and the prices were reasonable.
---
10/10. I’d totally buy from there again.
---
In workshop the rules change. Try it yourself. It was changed a few patches back. You have to be in the boundary of the workshop and if you see the owner is inside, attack him, you do full damage. You don't have to press the button on the bench anymore.
---
It’s a really nice spot for players that preferred premade bases like in fallout NV and 3
---
Uh oh someone is having a bad day :|
---
That concept art for the backpacks are so awesome
---
And this is how a proper argument should end
---
Its over on a junk pile by one of the farms :p

Its over by a junk pile and a farm :p
---
Seriously. It's so whack we can only get super lame tattoos right on our face or neck.
---
It can be up to three... we had 7 players and three popped out
---
I bypass all those Mine Locker missions, I never find them
---
no, at least if it's not cheat mods
---
I'd like these a lot if they were hidden until you get the Enclave unlocked. I believe the Enclave reveal was one of the best things in 76 maybe even the best in the modern fallout's and really like there's no sign of them in game till you learn the secret of Whitesprings. Plastering them all over the atom shop to new players will kinda kill that.
---
Damn, I might have to pass this one up too then. I just can’t find it, and I’ve been in this mine forever.
---
Like the chassis themselves?
---
Monster fish or a hydra enemy would be cool?
---
You can get more then one meat from it
---
Internet 101: "Im right, you're stupid and wrong"
---
Don't count on it.
---
I dont think its marked locked or anything. Just mash all lockers you find and you will receive the "contents" of the locker through the quest completion screen.
---
ESO style !
---
Sorry, used up all of mine feeding the cute rat god
---
This!!! I’m wondering the same thing. I haven’t got lucky enough but no way they added these weapons &amp; not legendary versions.. none of the weapons are good without a legendary version.
---
Do we have the option to hide the backpack? (but still get the benefits just like the power armor) Because some outfit won't look good with backpack on our back, for example the tuxedo, suits, elegant dress, etc (formal outfit), not matching color, and so on.
---
If you server hop or changes to a different location.
---
Well, the only problem is that I haven’t seen any lockers, but I’ll keep looking. Thank you!
---
What kept you from using a level 1 character?
---
Thanks m8!

I used to live near that behemoth. He's a great neighbor. He would always lend a hand with those random scorchbeasts.

god dammit they did it again
---
Sweet that they are fulfilling this within the 4-6 month window.
---
I'm sarcastically saying no, never played any other game than fo76.
---
The game sucked at release. I still played and beat it back then minus nukes. The game is very good right now. Right now, what issues do u have with the game?
---
Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics.
---
Oh dam I threw loads away the other day coz I was weighed down by them. Got loads in my stash. What platform?
---
There's a locker room to the right as soon as you enter the mine. It's usually there.
---
There's still some stinkers, but since beta I've probably witnessed maybe 7 of them personally grief me, VA the hundreds of awesome people I've interacted with
---
Even just a T-Shirt in game or a camp poster would be appreciated.
---
I don't wanna seem entitled here, i just don't feel like Bethesda, well, *appreciates* the BETA players sticking it out.
---
"people are having fun with something i don't like so i'm gonna make a post about how they're all wrong and nobody should do the thing i dislike"

If y’all are on Xbox I believe I can make it! I’ll double check but I’ll gladly make them for you for the low low price oooof! 120 caps
---
what are they? I havent logged to RDR in a while
---
Fallout 1 and 2
---
Wow.. you must live a super depressing life.. go join the outer worlds sub, they have a wonderful selection of 200+ complaints about the epic store. But instead you bring negativity to a sub that has actually been really positive for a while now. Everyone playing this game consistently is enjoying it &amp; having a lot of fun. Sorry you’re a nonce &amp; would rather dwell on a game made by a company who hasn’t made a title since 2010. Repair kits aren’t pay to win because you can get the better versions in game through the SBQ. You wouldn’t know, just a low life :-)
---
I actually opened ALL of those, and it wasn’t one of them. I also opened some lockers near the end of the mine on the left. Do you know if there are any more locker rooms? Maybe my quest is just bugged.
---
Can people STOP using explosive weapons on the free range event. FFS you need to keep the Brahmin ALIVE!!
---
I might have to resort to that if I still can’t find it.
---
Same thoughts. Sad life to bring negativity to a sub that’s been very very positive lately. We’re all having a lot of fun. Even most of the youtubers hopped off the hate train but OP got a big stick up his ass :-) too bad I won’t see him in survival. I have a DaisyCutter that would love a whiney baby to hit 💕
---
Lmao. I got it first try and wild willie's
---
I can make those for you. Free if you got mats otherwise 300 ea is fine.
---
Refrigerated backpacks = time to role play as a post apocalyptic Domino’s Pizza™️ delivery guy
---
You have to take the loot to get it to complete. It's usually 3-5 items. I can't picture any lockers in the Uranium Fever event area... so I'm not sure.
---
Player vending is still planned for patch 9 according to this week's inside the vault. Mentioned very briefly.
---
you cant get in to the silo at level 1, as you are not a general.
---
Proxy wars my friend. Proxy wars.
---
Legendary enemies refill their health about half-way through the first bar.
---
That's precisely why this game doesnt have it. It's not a co-op game. It's live. 
---
It's an mmo game. Different styles of game play need different mechanics to avoid exploitative behavior. It's why we don't have a stash we can access with multiple characters either.
---
I'd like prefabs (trailers, train cars, shipping containers, buses?), but not in the atom shop. I think some new plans for camps should be added in an update. They could include different variations in the atom shop or something.
---
i'm on xbox too, if you're talking about the combat version and not the tactical one i would love to buy you one :)  
---
gt: Mr LapeZ send me a message :)
---
True. I'm personally not expecting nor asking for anything.
---
It'd buy them a lot of goodwill though, if they recognized BETA players sticking it out or something. Even if it is just a poster of a T-shirt or something.
---
Overall, it'd be nice and I would really appreciate it. I do think the concept is a bit entitled however.
---
Its the group of lockers where uranium fever takes place. The one closest to charlie excavator
---
Could do it like TESO. your rewards don't reset, but you have to log in a certain amount of days in a month to get all of them. Maybe also do a special one for logging in so many days, but instead of a mount, do a C.A.M.P. item.
---
How about a reward just for being bored to death playing this game
---
I had that problem for a long time, then I found the plan in a random trash can, along with a bunch of other garbage somebody offloaded. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, and all that. I recommend searching all garbage.
---
Horses! Maybe we ride super mutant dogs? I’d like that. No! Mole rats!
---
Yessssss, feeeeeeed my plague aura!
---
What a classic
---
i never said i ran the silo at a level 10, i said i launched a nuke.
---
Maybe it’s their way of balancing OP weapons, explosive shotguns are being duped and abused way too much more than intended.
---
Some new attachments for the crossbow would be appreciated.
---
no I don't have the materials but if you're good with 300 each that'd be awesome :)
---
I'm not sure of next steps..will you be on sometime in the near future?
---
How are you over encumbered if you are only carrying one gun... You sir need to play some Outward, that'll teach you some proper inventory management, LEARN TO SORT YOUR @5$# out before venturing forth sir.
---
I’ve actually never done Uranium Fever, but I I think I know the excavator you’re talking about. If it’s the same one you’re talking about, I checked all of those lockers and took everything from them, but I still can’t find it.
---
Do people target round there?
---
That’s okay. I’ve been taking everything in every locker, but still can’t find it. Thank you anyways!
---
&gt;My game crashed, however
---
LMAO
---
Sorry man, I’m a PS4 scrub. Thanks a lot for the offer though.
---
I've always wondered if Vault-Tec somehow triggered a false launch to trick the Chinese systems into starting a nuclear war and then planned to push for power after all of their vaults opened.
---
Yet another sbq disconnect. Still happens, whatever fix's they have worked on aren't enough
---
I still dont think we need a raise. There are plenty in game ways that you can burn caps on be it fast travel and plans that I think are 6k at the most keeping normal play well under the limit. Until there's the player storefronts where we may need more caps on hand I don't think we need one and when they do raise it I never hope its more that to 50k. I think the only thing keeping our "economy" alive is they have to abide to this cap limit. 
---
TSE weapons are "rare" but in reality the duping catastrophe we had months ago still has left so many in circulation that 10k should already be a scalpers price, but the fact that we have people still willing to pay 25k are part of the problem. TSE has even been nerfed so hard that you really could go your entire time playing without one and still not be too far behind someone who has bought one. Just dont spend real money on that garbage if people are still doing that.
---
Yes and over by twin lakes and outside of grafton
---
Yeah...if you can't find them online then the locker location has to be random. I did that quest and those lockers worked for me.
---
I think they broke vendors because when I buy stuff from them it doesn't give them all the caps like it used to
---
I've seen a video that featured a double-barrel shotgun with it, too.  It was magnificent.
---
Damn, that’s okay. Thank you!

If he didn't use orbital beacons, perk cards, and/or mirv to level it he's probably a snuffaluffagus. Easy to pk, power armor xD

Balls. I was finally happy with my Camp as well. :( Is there a specific reason why? I built there specifically because it's most empty area.

&gt;Save your money, buy yourself The Outer Worlds

Yeah things are going great over there. Epic nabbed exclusive distribution rights and it got so bad they had to pin a post saying promoting piracy will get you banned. I put a link to the post it's freaking hilarious if you like pirate puns that is.

You might want to reconsider where you tell people to go. It worked great for the "Fuck this game I'm getting Anthem" crowd

I have no hate towards the Outerworlds it looks like a great game. Just keep in mind it's only going to be 20-30 hrs of gameplay per the developers.

I'll wait for the bargin bin price and keep playing 76.

Hahaha this post is stupid
---
A little OT, but I LOVE my quad 10mm pistol.  It makes short work of low-level mobs, costs very little AP in VATS, and reloads quickly.  It also seems to do a good job of hitting VATS headshots, with them landing about as often as torso hits, and concentrated fire 1 is the only aiming perk I'm using
---
Only place I’ve ever seen it dropped was during a nuke and off a legendary enemy. I’ve searched for it everywhere with no luck. So it’s only obtainable that way. Hope that clears things up

I feel like BOS VI should be Sentinel, not Paladin as Sentinel is the next step up.
---
That one is especially annoying, there's no mention of that in the item description either.
---
I saw someone on another post mention having the same problem. Can't remember if they got Event loot though.
---
The 3rd view took some time to retrain, but I liked it so much! I completely disliked the 1st person view now. Try it! More FOV, more focused, better VATS, enjoy your outfit
---
People that destroy camps for no reason are going to be really bored when they release the update to prevent camp damage. It seems like camp destruction is on the upswing lately. I've lost 2 camps since Sunday.
---
Yrolls will be trolls also raiders
---
You can still help by describing where the spawn actually is.  That's what helped me find the one at Miner's Memorial (on the stairs by the memorial itself) when server hopping earlier.
---
I finished the new event and got the new Sheepsquatch club. After that the event drops mod plans.
---
No, Chameleon is a a one star mod like Hunter's, you can't have them both on the same armor. "Harder to detect" is a seperate 3rd star mod
---
I swing my driver at the balls anyway, doesn't do anything but it makes me happy.
---
Seconded
---
And then what would you call the radiation resist perk pa has or the fact pa has actual helmets that have defensive stats
---
I can't speak for actual explosive weapons, but I'm fairly certain I do no damage to the Brahmin with my explosive handmade.
---
There is. It's called Fallout 4
---
Exit to menu and come back if you'll be gone awhile. Or chameleon armor crouched in a hidden spot works well
---
Ah. Well that's awful, but glad it's on them being crappy and not me accidentally in farming territory. Thanks for the information!
---
PS4 I can give you about 10
---
I'll hop on now..
---
I have quite a few of them they are awesome!! I unfourtunately do not remember where I got the drops
---
Abyone know what day the weekly challenge resets? My timer is glitched and says 43 billions days.
---
Great strategy guide btw, thanks!
---
Crafting plans for armor pieces for the T-series are exceptionally rare.   
---
I have maybe 1K hours or more in game and, I have found TWO:  
---
T60 Right Leg  
---
T51b Left Leg  
---
That's on my main character, currently Level 170, running 8 for luck stat.   
---
The (quite expensive and flux-ingredient intensive) plan for the calibrated shock mod is available from the BOS vendor in Whitesprings, and the BOS vendor at Watoga Shopping Plaze (Vendor Box Phoenix). Finding the mod itself is also possible at both of those, and random spawns (BOS camps mostly, but not exclusively). (the mod is way cheaper than the plan, when you find it).
---
 One Enclave. One America. Now and forever.
---
The 11 minute videos weren't useless at all. They almost always summarized what was happening on reddit and the community reaction to new updates. Every single person that made a video on Fallout 76 after release (when there was actual hate towards the game) was criticizing the game. Even Oxhorn criticized it in his own way. I started watching Juicehead back then because he was one of the few people that were somewhat respectful and weren't shitting on the game (unlike for example LegacyKillaHD, who was sharing facts but had little knowledge about the game and was rude). If you have a recommendation on who you think summarizes the news better than Juicehead about 76, then please do go ahead and share. There's a reason why his channel truly blew up after 76 and people still watch him. His videos also have a very good like/dislike ratio. I have no idea what problem this sub has with this guy. Have you seen how badly other Youtubers portrayed this game? Yet you choose to shit on him. But hey, you do you.
---
k I'll see you
---
Yeah I noticed my vampire combat shotgun degraded really quickly when I used it in Uranium Fever. Had to fix it twice once when doing it solo
---
Usually every Tuesday at 1600GMT
---
Thats something i dont think alot of people are aware of. So many great unmarked spots to build off of.
---
Honestly.
---
I run a shop and whenever I open it up some Scorchbeast guano pile sees my weapons in my inventory and offers on them, I say no and they start breaking things out of frustration.
---
As if that would make me sell to you.
---
Same I'm on PS4.
---
They already do, i've racked up about $40 in atoms
---
I've got a Vampire's and an AA Grog from farming WS.
---
If you're on PC I can sell 113% fusion cores to ya.
---
I'm pretty sure it has to be a legendary drop. I've never seen a vanilla version.
---
Right! Now if only I could find a junk pile in the mire ~sigh~
---
Ok how many fo76 youtube videos did you watch before making this post?
---
Ouch, well now I know if I'm with higher level characters to avoid that area
---
Low level areas can be a blast when using a favorite load out. The game doesn’t have to be hard to be super duper fun
---
I would love to have you make me one!
---
thanks dude! sorry about the delay...first time :)
---
When I play solo I dont worry about quitting for a break.  Only thing that happens is you restart on a different server and baddies respawn.
---
Is this that hard to understand? If you buy repair kits, you don't NEED to repair your weapons before going out in the field. If you buy repair kits, you don't NEED to carry a backup weapon. If you're playing a rifleman character, that's 20 pounds you're saving up right there. It DOES give you a competitive advantage because it makes the game objectively easier.
---
Last time I was on got $ and a bunch of gold bars.
---
Oh np.. Have fun!
---
Map aint the same, though.
---
OMG, so you are saying that you bulk it so it can be sold as intended? Brilliant! since we are being obvious, did you know increasing your charisma makes it so selling items gets you more Caps?! Shhhh its a secret. 
---
TL:DR Try reading the post
---
Needless to say I hit the shops like no tomorrow.
---
Is that on ps2?
---
Camp items, thats what I'm talking about
---
Did you nuke it?
---
Biv already gives you daily missions, that's your daily, or the carnival events, or many other daily events.  You SHOULDN'T get something just for turning on the game, that's fucking dumb and against anything real players want.  There's daily challenges, daily events, etc, if you're too busy or lazy to actually play the game, you DON'T deserve rewards bro!!
---
(jump)..(jump)..(jump)..
---
They cannot.
---
Man I never see more than like twenty people on, must be a flop ;)
---
I can't say if it's worth it or not. Different people like different things. But the population seems to be fairly strong at the moment, judging by all the activity in the trading subs, here, and the console communities.
---
What are other players going to do that prevents you from going afk a bit?
---
Add me
---
i've checked the bodies multiple times in as many servers, it only has the tattered dress, some pre-war money, and some ammo. as for the police uniform, check the vendor in grafton and point pleasant I could be mistaken, but I think i bought mine there early in the game.
---
Shoot I'm on PS4
---
Dark days
---
Absolutely. Either a longer loop or some extra stations. They get repetitive so quickly.
---
I think it might be a naive assumption that duping has been resolved.
---
Feels really good! Made TONS of friends also.
---
PS: if anybody needs the Tourist I have him currently again. PSN: Markooshy
---
They were the best of times and they were the worst of times
---
Mine goes from 200% condition to broken in one West Tek run.
---
Murder me and destroy my camp
---
I asked this in a separate thread, but since you've analyzed it, perhaps you know... is there a way for a player to NOT respawn at the workshop they are "defending"? I had Thunder Mountain last week (farming fusion cores) and got repeatedly pwned by a three or four man squad who were just farming ME for caps. Never got an option to spawn any where else, or ignore, just auto-spawned in one of two spots in front of all their guns. (Adventure Server).   
---
Finally got enough distance to get out of the (very large) workshop area after multiple deaths. Lost 1500 or more caps, and some stable flux to boot.   
---
No problem, GG 76, I should have taken more time with my turret selection, but there should be a mechanic to relinquish the workshop and end the groundhog day respawn loop... (if not, then yeah, it feels pretty grief-y)
---
Yes sort by value...
---
What’s your psn name?
---
Are you referring to the helmet that has the big bug eyes? The tactical helmet? Assault isn't on consoles. It was a Dev room only item on PC only.
---
Are all those weapons 2h. I can tell with the crook but not sure about the club
---
No...never had to before. There was at least 2 everytime. Last few times nothing.
---
 I was just able to apply mine today. I was up in The Enclave when I did it. I hope you have the same luck.
---
Agreed...BUT, I might actually start using the Excavator again for the extra carry weight, and I wont look like a doofus-bus-transformer.
---
Pigboy0921
---
I live in the swamp, far far to the east, where it's always dark and the toads and crickets eat your crops. No one ever goes out there, so you'll have the whole place to yourself. I hope to open a diner out there someday, if they ever add the kit to the atom shop.
---
I have a few to spare, my psn is the same as my u/
---
I'm not positive. But I noticed mine right after i crafted the Easter bunny mask from the daily egg thing.
---
Anything to contribute.
---
- Tyrese, *TWD*
---
Yes 3 times in 2 hours including one others have had: after picking a lock. Shoddy.
---
A full set of legendary armors can get you to 15 legendary effects plus mods and they don’t use Fusion Cores to work
---
I've got that listed under NPC's, let me know if I missed a detail!
---
Tried it and didnt work
---
Did Bethesda officially comment?
---
The instability of the STALKER games lended to its Ukrainian charm.
---
That said, they're still one of the best series of games I've ever played.
---
Could not agree more!
---
COUNTRY ROADS....
---
It's really weird, it all started when they "fixed" the ammo count issue.
---
I rarely see legendaries running solo, they've only spawned for me when at least another player is running or has been through. Never done it nuked.
---
And FAN Girls..didn't forget us..lol
---
I unplugged my Xbox and started it up a minute later and I was able to log in if you’re still having issues.
---
Literally today I went afk for 5 minutes to get a snack and came back with Morgantown nuked. Definitely glad I didn’t leave but coming back to a white screen was scary.
---
THIS TOTALLY EXPLAINS WHY I SAW LIKE 15 DEAD COWS IN AN AREA YESTERDAY HOLY SHIT
---
Note: leave your explosive weapons at home. Event fails if the brahmin die.
---
I didn't notice mine doing damage to them
---
Um since it is worthless I would be glad to offer you a few caps for it.
---
Id rather get new content, then 20 gold bars to buy shitty outfits to wear while doing the same shitty game modes over and over. Im pretty sure R* has completely stopped focusing on RDO. There hasnt been a peep from them for months other then to tell us about their shitty limited time clothing and third capture the flag mode.
---
No, you clearly don't have any clue how pvp works in this game. The ultimate armor is actually sent gear, and that's bypassed completely by VATS... and those people don't take fresh workshops. They only troll and grief players without them.
---
I randomly had a squad help me out with the herding quest. Very unexpected but a crazy bastard boss at the end! I’m glad they incorporated an actual Sheepsquatch into the game.
---
Long as they fix the bug where some songs get cut off at the end. 
---
If they cut off "Orange Colored Sky" or "Maybe" one more goddamn time lmao
---
yea it was a official Bethesda account iirc
---
club is 1 handed. also there is sheepsquatch edge or something. Should be knife
---
Thanks for putting in the legwork, no pun intended ;3
---
Your body is unkillable unless you fight back and iirc your camp will be soon too
---
Ok, ya'll realize spoiled meat and fruit are consumable right?   Who cares about rads and illness, all cured easily.
---
I mean never hurts to carry a backup weapon. Saves ammo. Simple as that. Plus like its so easy to find weapon benches just around the world. Most expensive thing in a repair is springs. And thats just as easy as getting a few clip boards. If my weapon is broken or near broke and i have no springs for some odd reason. Woah i have this melee weapon that i use to smack things. Until i get my mats. Repair kits for atoms is litterally a complete waste of atoms. Hell id sooner buy a weapon camo or skin in something i never play before id consider ever spending atoms on a repair kit.
---
Well shite. I already got the tactical marine helmet after server hopping for hours at C2. As a ps4 player, I’m really disappointed since it wouldn’t even be that hard to add it into the game...
---
I think we’re experiencing the video game equivalent of hyperinflation. Too many caps chasing too few goods.
---
The current economy does not have a proper cycling mechanism in which to remove caps from the pockets of players in a efficient way. Increasing the cap limit will only drive prices higher because the relationship of supply and demand does not change, only the price will change— inflate really.
---
FO76’s economy needs a closer examination before implementing ideas like higher cap limits.
---
Yeehaw folk UNITE
---
They'll probably fill it out as updates come along.
---
Oh absolutely, I still am playing SoC on the side right now
---
It was fixed a while ago but the recent patch broke it again somehow.
---
Definitely need an item for item trade, but for advice as it currently is never set it for zero. Especially if it's pricey items, decide in a price(like 5000) you both sell your items for 5k and get it back when finishing the trade. If they run off well you still got some caps off of it.
---
Oh man, damn, i need this but will probably miss out
---
For other faction events too, you get outfits. They're just super/rare drops
---
No. I've had quite a few 3\* Ghouls today down there. Farmed it for about 3 hours.
---
I remember having trouble with that months ago. There is a work around - try and google it.
---
I can't remember the fix - might be in your inventory ( misc ) make sure the quest item has a quest symbol next to it ( a diamond symbol ? ). Or there are too many entries and you have to delete some.
---
So go play 1. Or 2. Or 3. Or New Vegas. Or 4.
---
Not much has changed since release. The quests that have been added is maybe 2 hours of content if I am being generous. There are some QOL changes that are nice for new players that are just getting started which is nice. But really most problems that were there are day one are still there.
---
This train wreck clearly needs mini games when main game is broken as hell.
---
Move your camp 1 foot, completely repaired. In Adventure, you won't be murdered.
---
How did they/he do that I thought our camps were safe?
---
I will 100% disagree.
---
Berry mentats highlights living things. Including players
---
Yes! Every good multiplayer online game has something passive and relaxing to do to pass the time. 
---
In my case, that’s running in circles at trade hubs giving gifts to random folks — but fishing is fun, too.
---
barbed and weighted staff https://imgur.com/a/rFOX2Vm
---
I'm on Xbox, but if anyone sees this, i got 25 cores for just 1000 caps.
---
For some reason this keeps happening with lots of stuff, it’s like the build the new patch off of an old one
---
Not defending these dickheads or anything but it's literally an in-game feature implemented by the devs. Not sure anyone should get band for it. 😅
---
Maybe a VIABLE crossbow?
---
Now I have to trespass now BEWARE OF THE CRYPTID KING! ps. How do you get the mothman title?
---
The Dawnguard.
---
Oh... you were serious. . . as I run silos all the bloody time and find melee significantly faster/easier/requires less healing items for most sections. Destroying the mainframe cores obviously faster with explosives.
---
That would be cool, with a smaller budget and only smaller real camp like items available. Not sure if it should grant another fast travel or if the camp should automatically undeploy if you leave a radius.
---
It was a messy firefight. I may be making an assumption.
---
I wonder how many people’s shipping addresses are not verified? Would it not be that same as the PA Edition’s shipping info? If you don’t respond do you miss getting it?
---
Good idea, except for the items that are worth more than any amount of caps
---
Berry Mentats.
---
I actually just completed my first ever trade, but for caps, and I have to admit that it didn't feel very intuitive and I appreciate u/thehippoz for being patient with me.
---
I can see how scamming could happen and you're right, just have both parties fill in a box on their side with whatever and then hit ACCEPT when they've seen the other parties box contents
---
Yes, Fashnacht items for sure
---
Were just down the hill from Dollie sods
---
You should get into PipCoin...
---
You must not play the game much because most if not all of the game breaking bugs were fixed a while back lol.
---
Royality fees are probably the big reason.  You willing to “pay to hear?”
---
Well, I never said it was a big competitive advantage. It is there, though, and by telling Bethesda we don't care, we're allowing them to keep pushing more and more utility items, each one slightly more useful than the last. It is, as many people have said, a slippery slope.
---
there was the Fascnact Parade event a while back. all the rewards were cosmetic but they were pretty neat. mostly masks, but also CAMP items and a few recipes like donuts and sausages. the event was a hit so i suspect they'll bring it back next year.
---
also for Easter week you could get free painted deathclaw eggs in the atom shop, and if you got all 6 you got a free Rabbit mascot head mask.
---
nothing in the atom shop that was "limited" has returned but i'm sure they will eventually. like. in a year.
---
This was a seasonal event and was it the first?
---
Also, is it done already?
---
Yes! PA definitely need some legendary pieces.
---
The computer assisted locking mod on the missle launcher can lock onto invisible people.
---
I have periodically run The Burrows since launch and in the first days, I could find at least six or seven legendaries. In my last runs I could find no legendaries or one at the most. I always play solo and with no nuke at Harpers Ferry. It has been nerfed for sure.
---
No doubt, that's the shadiest aspect of it. However as of now that's the best bet until item for item is implemented, we can only hope it's soon.
---
Nope, you’re fine.
---
Yes, no
---
You specifically called out the mitigation of a tedious activity as objectively bad design (regardless of its monetization), ignoring that since fun is subjective this inherently fails to be an objective evaluation.  You and I not liking the solution is our opinion, and your feelings about it being monetized are also an opinion.  These are not actually objectively provable things since the underlying driver is an entirely subjective concept (what is fun and what is tedious).
---
Very Interested!  When are you online normally?
---
 I have played Stalker far more than any other game. I have played the mods including the great Russian mods a great deal. The game is very solid and there's something wrong with either that machine or the mod.
---
Your showing offline, would you send me an invite? Conwaytwitty757
---
That's why we need legendary pieces for PA
---
Hm, interesting. 
---
Sounds like I missed quite and interesting event then unfortunately. 
---
Would you recommend I return to the game now, I was lvl 150 but just had to stop. I've been thinking about returning but don't know how much things have changed.
---
He is asking if the club can be a legendary drop
---
Showing you offline.
---
I'll give that a try. Thanks 😊
---
