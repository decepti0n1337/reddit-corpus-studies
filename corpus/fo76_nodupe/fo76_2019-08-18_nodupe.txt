I did acknowledge that it is to raise their daily average logins. That's the number they care about. They don't care how many hours a week you play, they care that you logged in every day.
---

---
Which makes it especially shameful that the atomic shop isn't changed daily outside of of one or two items. You want me to log in every day to farm my wallet at least give me the dignity of making an actual daily rolling sale inventory page.
---
The exceptional irony is that I would buy regular expansions if they just provided actual content and a good user experience. There's a reason I was subscribed to games like wow for literally a decade on multiple accounts when things were focused more on weekly rather than daily.
---
---
---
This is scary. Just got my dream weapon. Skinned and renamed. Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do if I lost it.
---
I never kick but I might not stay on a team or sever long if there isn't at least one person with mutation. That is my only problem with joining an all low level team.
---
What‚Äôs harder is that such challenges don‚Äôt align with what I‚Äôm normally doing on any given day in Appalachia.
---
The types of challenges you‚Äôre talking about are better suited as the real difficult ones of the Pioneer Scouts. 
---
Now, if they were going to expand that program and make a level above Possum and do this sort of thing? I‚Äôd love it. But it doesn‚Äôt jive well with a grinding seasonal thing.
---
Christ, I don‚Äôt know how the fuck these things are WORSE than the airborne abominations of nature that are the Scorchbeasts, I mean fuck, these things wiped out the population of a fucking *STATE!* They should be a *lot* more dangerous than they are in-game
---
I believe it‚Äôs possible to get back there with glitches if you know what you‚Äôre doing
---
Leveling up should give you perk coins past level 50 or 60. Then you should be able to trade legendaries for perk coins rather than scrip if you want. Just an idea.
---
Ah - good to know - thanks!
---
Maybe something like line in the sand except youre fending off raiders or other enemies from destorying hatching deathclaw eggs or baby deathclaws the more you save the better the reward
---
Magic weapons still work, so booyah!
---
Nothing works.
---
Yeah I figured where there is a camera, there is a way!
---
Fair point.
---
I'm sure there is a middle ground and my examples were just examples of how to use existing content to make the challenges more engaging.
---
Yes!
---
Unfortunately not. I guess i wasn‚Äôt aware of not using power armor.
---
Right? I feel like that island is screaming to be used for *something*
---
Just admit it. You‚Äôve slept with Biv haven‚Äôt you?
---
I have no idea what this means
---
Is it that obvious? üò≤
---
Yeah it's annoying missing out on these free atoms
---
Legendary just means ‚Äúhas an ability normal weapons/armor don‚Äôt have‚Äù and has nothing to do with being limited. It‚Äôs more akin to a rarity than something special few have. 
---
Legacy gear is closer to your take on Legendary
---
Ok
---
Look it up, the new legendary perk cards gives you 5* extra perk points to spend at max level.
---
Same
---
Yeah Mutant's can REALLY needs a revisit. 
---
I mean just having Herd Mentality (that one mutation needed for mutant's 10% damage) and being in a group (super easy now with pubic groups) let's you completely counter the 5 addictions\* needed to reach max 50% damage on Junkie's, leading to the question why use mutant's at all?
---
Tho honestly that would more likely to lead to a nerfed Junkie's rather then a buffed Mutant's so yeah be careful what we wish for.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\*Alcohol, Buffout, Daddy-O, Mentats, and Fury together gives you Strength -2,  Endurance -1, Perception -2, Charisma -2, Intelligence -1, Agility -1, so once you add in HM you get a net gain of Endurance +1, Intelligence +1, Agility +1, Luck +2.
---
Having worked in DevOps, I can *assure* you they are outsourcing the bulk of this work to the cheapest contractor they can.
---
it's a dlc called contraptions sadly it's not in the main game but the goty version or season pass is most of the times on sale you should try one day just for the lolz and to build something xd
---
[this is the description appanrently](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Logic_gate) and the stupid pylon counter works as intended i miss having the light panel switch colors T_T
---
Cheap for sure
---
Wait... you never use scrap to repair gear?
---
I do that every day for the 'buy 3 items from a player' challenge :)
---
Just a touch. üòÖ
---
I haven‚Äôt gone back to see that bot in a while.
---
I‚Äôm supposed to craft wine and keep forgetting.
---
Up vote!
---
There are couple hundred more important things they need to fix / improve before they look into chainsaws and drills for your theme.
---
Wasbt it 5 at max lvl? Or did they change it?
---
Ah my plan foiled again!
---
They should delete the Nocturnal perk while they're at it. Any weapon I get with that perk is an instant scrip item.
---
What's your theme that uses a drill?
---
which event is that?? also where's that at??üòÖü§î
---
Play PoE and you‚Äôll change your mind. FO76 feels very reasonable, imo.
---
No you right. Remembered it wrong, but dang that‚Äôs a lot of perk points you can freely move around now.
---
F76 is capped at 120FPS since BETA for engine bugs reasons.
---
100% getting 3 which are mainly agility, and luck and maybe strength but I don't know anymore since the damage nerf happened if they happen to release it like that welp guess everybody pretty much has to go tank build cause the daily ops destroy stealth solo builds and encourage team work
---
So are you saying you will fill your slots with non legendary perks? I‚Äôm just not sure what you are trying to say..
---
You may feel that way but it's literally using the same code and hp/DR/damage modifiers not that it's saying much since survival mode was never really hard on any of them.
---
I always play conduit, and the impostor always explodes and yeets off somewhere I can't find it.
---
[removed]
---
yeah man, it was reported within the first hour. theres a whole thread on it.
---
Have they added any new rewards to Meat Week? If not then I can ignore it altogether.
---
What are you on? 76 uses the same gun mechanics as 4 to a T. But now worse because you have lag crap on everything.
---
&gt;. I happen to have a bachelor's degree in computer science.
---
"I literally just graduated and have 0 actual dev experience but trust me because i technically have a qualification"
---
I mean the fact that you think it would require a "full engine rewrite" is enough to tell me you have no fucking clue what you're on about.
---
I'm a quack surgeon. Plague doctor mask with the quack body outfit. The drill is perfect for some makeshift "surgery" on unsuspecting ghouls. ;)
---
I agree with this^
---
Yes, that's why people don't like them.
---
Its definitely under utilized for being a named location i feel the same way about the big lake by thunder mountain power plant a event there specifically involing the lake would be cool
---
That will show'em!
---
Only new thing that I know about being advertised being new is a tenderiser plan so we can get a legendary version to drop from events/mumbles.
---
I love naming my weapons!
---
Drac is my Vampire's Radium Rifle.
---
KaBlammo! is my Pump Action Shotgun.
---
Night Night is my Baseball Bat.
---
Speedy is my Handmade.
---
Mercury is my TS Gatling Gun. I only use him for SBQ fights.
---
Judy (as in Punch and...) was my Power Fist, but I got two new legendary gauntlet weapons that were more powerful, but until I decide which I like better they are Judy? and Also Judy?
---
Daisy is my Hunting Rifle, who was named after the first brand of rifle I learned to shoot.
---
Joy is my Medic's Lever Action Rifle, named after Nurse Joy.
---
Chattanooga is my Railway Rifle, named after the Chattanooga Choo Choo!
---
Most of these have other effects but I only mention them in relation to their names.
---
I want someone on my team with a mutation (for Strength in Numbers), so I‚Äôm never gonna party up with 3 level 10s. Other than that, I don‚Äôt care as long as you mute yourself.
---
Ok, this is what I‚Äôve been worried about.  I‚Äôll have to test w a friend, since you can‚Äôt tell in a SBQ fight.
---
I don't mind them, rather want atoms back and the atom store not selling random ass garbage lol
---
Not just bloodied, I‚Äôve dealt with more PA tank builds with heavy guns running through to kill everything, including legendaries.
---
A square house with a red rocket garage on the side of a road. 
---
I SURE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS ON EVERY SERVER EVER
---
*Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.*
---
k
---
If he‚Äôs on your team you should be sharing rewards. Also I‚Äôm sorry to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù but you should let people play the game the way they want to play it. I agree it‚Äôs frustrating but seeking revenge just sinks you down to their level.
---
Let them have the loot I always tell myself...
---
The other day I submitted a ticket about it to Bethesda. After some back and forth all they told me was they were not able to help me with the budget, implying I fill out a feedback form for the development team.
---
Fasnacht. I played at launch, drifted off, then came back and that event hooked me in.
---
I was using a Sack Hood occasionally for that look.
---
Yah yah, buh-bye.
---
An update would be nice.... you know seeeing as this hasnt been fixed for 2 weeks
---
I miss you already.
---
But he just wants his team to be rad free. He's playing the game how HE wants
---
Thanks!!
---
I'm not worried about me getting the legendary, I do fine for my self, but it's for everyone else at the event. And that's fine and all, I'm playing the game the way I want so ü§ó
---
Since they can‚Äôt come as weightless, they‚Äôre insanely heavy without a frame tho üëÄ
---
Yeah, that's the point of this post. People are blowing out the proportions of level ups when its fairly easy to do and aren't near those numbers in any way if you simply search it up and become informed. You get EXP while doing these as well which is a repeatable as well so its honestly 30 min and not near and hour or 2 unless your luck is super poor. I'm in the 70's and its about 2800 or so and I fill them up in my daily challenges no problem. The weekly give you large number boosts to the total as well. You should see how Battlefield 4's progression worked, that was literally a chore to get certain things that were necessary for proper gameplay.
---
So your title is a lie...you bought something and waited almost 2 years for it to become "good" and *now* you decide to leave.
---
I didn‚Äôt listen to the ‚Äúcritics‚Äù, had fun at my own pace, took a break when it got boring and came back with full gusto when Wasteland went live. Enjoying it at my own pace saved it for me, even if my friends gave up on it.
---
This is how I feel, but didnt know how to describe it
---
Yeah, just had that issue in a game about 2 hours ago. Placed down my camp for the score mission and then everything was gone.
---
Don't you get credited a legendary kills if on a public team?
---
In Radiation Rumble I ore then shishkebab heal and I still get all the meat piles.
---
Agreed if you steal my loot I should have the option to attack.
---
And GTA 6 should be released 
---
That makes two things we would like to happen but probably won‚Äôt
---
When do they come out? I didn't even know about this! üòµ
---
I'd buy more shit if my building cap wasn't almost maxed out. Lots of cool shit but no point in buying cause I'm at max. More weapon skins as well would make me tinker with playstyles as well; I'm a very visual person. Make it cool and interesting without fucking it up and I'm in.
---
Huh, I only knew about the Huffwarbler Teapot so far. Visually identical to a normal one, but still an oddity...
---
Hopefully the Tenderizer and mods won‚Äôt be hard to get
---
Yep, many of us had that problem today.
---
It‚Äôs so stupid because another one of THEIR OWN GAMES has this functionality, ESO.
---
Seriously, my quick wheel is half guns of different types and half grenades of different types. I'm a walking arsenal. The strange thing is, I use all of them. I think I need to simplify.
---
I will almost definitely take a few of the basic special ones. I need those extra perk slots to accommodate all the food build carry weight perks I refuse to give up.
---
Tired of not getting full rewards for this event because people are just xping off ghouls.
---
And Bethesda customer support doesn't care... They just auto lock any ticket that mentions score...
---
Shame on people for playing the game as it‚Äôs designed
---
I was having a good run of it at fever for a good long while until yesterday. 
---
Fortunately I managed to tag the 1st 2 legendaries first but you would think me kiting them out would be a sign of the civility of the event. 
---
Nope, I was too close to the main supervisor spawn so the 3rd materialized at the other one and white wolf fedora, gauss shotty just killed him. 
---
He wasn't on my team so I couldn't leech his precious rads away.
---
If you complete the event you can put the syringer back in the metal box beside the computer that you return the holotape to
---
This is the equivalent of someone making a Facebook post saying they‚Äôre deleting their account
---
Well if that's all there is then I can ignore it completely since I don't use two handed weapons.
---
It's flat and boring
---
That‚Äôs commitment right there. Sounds really fun to play but really unfun rolling a level 1 set of each enemy specific armor that‚Äôs got powered as the second roll and either sent, cav, or sneak. How long did that take you?
---
Yep but that‚Äôs been sitting on that same table across from Silva Homestead since launch. This thing (visually identical to Fancy Hairbrush) has been in the files but unobtainable until Wastelanders. And they REALLY tucked it out of sight - exactly the way every treasure hunter would want it :)
---
As Tshk80 mentioned, are we sure it‚Äôs actually applying, though?  Hard to test since health rubber bands sometimes, but I feel like my sneak attack numbers aren‚Äôt real sometimes.
---
Unarmed do out perform them!
---
Me playing at 142 all the time says otherwise but thanks.
---
Also it used to be capped at 72 just like FO4 until a few weeks *after* launch where they enabled higher FPS without making you run faster.
---
I‚Äôm taking all my TSE, AAE weapons and VanSent forest scout armour to the grave.       
---
       
---
Like I care who you are.
---
Thanks, i had some laughs!

I've created a Jazz Machine on my CAMP but sadly the speaker's pitch all reset when you log off

---
How do you like that perk? I've heard some pretty good things about it. From some old posts, it seems like it can essentially double the durability of weapons/armor at max rank.
---
2 weapons, my armor, a few needed aid items and ammo leaves me at about 100 lbs. free space is a little under 200
---
I do enough damage with 2 clips to the SBQ in stealth to get loot
---
Forgot to crouch once, unloaded my 2 clips, and got nothing from her
---
Fine! If that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to be, I will just kill all the legendaries as a solo player. Then you won‚Äôt get them at all. All the nocturnal rolling pins will be mine and mine alone. That will teach you a lesson. Right?..... right?..... seriously though. Why you gotta be bad funning me in front of my friends?
---
So you agree that I should be able to share what ever perk card I feel would be most beneficial to my fellow team mates and if I see someone who is so close to death and can't heal because of all the radiation damage they have taken then I feen it's only right to help them remove those rads so they can heal and feel safe once again
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt criticize him for that!
---
Sometimes it's fun to sink to the bottom. Petty revenge can often be the best kind.
---
In other games, only a small amount of the total users actually try the PTS. It might not have high enough adoption for them to be comfortable.
---
I was thinking eastword. Maryland, with the Chesapeake Bay beaches and Mountains you can ski. Maybe introduce some ship based combat :)  we are dreaming anyway :P
---
I guess idgaf lol
---
I have tested the perks on PTS, and right now it looks like i'm going to max the stealth damage bonus perk first and rest 5 slots will be just for the specials. My alt is gonna burn all his perks and get the ammo factory one maxed and be just a crafting toon from now on.
---
I had it for my weapons at first, mostly my magic shotgun that never missed and hunter rifle that i rarely missed with and from level 20ish to 60 or so when i started changing my build i never repaired my two guns. 
---
Now, with heavy weapons and a fair amount of misses i repair maybe ever 3 levels. Do with that info as you please.
---
Does not even matter if you check your fps with any software. Search in youtube the videos that people made looking to the floor and ganining hiper-speed.
---
Thats how they patched it because ingame speed WAS linked to FPS. Nothing to discuss here.
---
So you and 1 other person join a private server and just stand around not shooting each other until the circle gets as small as possible before one of you wins, since time survived and placement is all that matters. That kind of win trading sounds worse than the chance of having a hacker join your game.
---
yeah it‚Äôs the same concept in an mmo where a healer won‚Äôt damage a boss bc they‚Äôre.... busy healing. So games accommodate that and make it so every get da loots. I mean you‚Äôre there, actively participating in the much more difficult portion of the event. And you get fucking shafted bc BGS doesn‚Äôt know how to make functional game mechanics.
---
[deleted]
---
As a bloodied build myself I just tag whatever with a shitty pipe pistol and make sure everyone tags the legendary especially 3* and ashamed of my fellow bloodied brethren  for doing this, and you know who's worst? I'm looking at you Gatling Plasma Legacy Users
---
It just turned night time in the game and he has his rads back, but when that sun come up lol
---
I doesn't matter which ones you pick as you can swap base perk points around anyway you choose.
---
Does someone downvoting my post and all the yes replies mean you can't put mounted heads, letters, etc on them?
---
I kinda get it. Let the game people know that there's another customer lost. We may get some serious change if/when more people bail.
---
I'd like to see the capital wasteland again but it was done in FO3. Lifelong marylander myself
---
Nuclear winter pvp is more fun, balenced weapons, being able to use the camp system as a team engineer for providing our sniper a vantage point and getting out of the fire!
---
That is great!
---
Did they remove the Special point? Cause I read you can put a point and special point into one of them
---
I trust y'all that commented and super appreciate it, but I'm also a conspiracy theorist üòÇ
---
Aweeee is the little baby gonna cry ?
---
The Deathclaw Island Deathclaws are babies, they're capped at lv 15 and loose to me in fist fights!

I waited with everyone a long time.spent money, stayed optimistic. I think I deserve an exit statement. I even got the T51 helmet at home. But I‚Äôm saddened to see that each update is manipulative and dressed up to hide how little content is added.

Graduated HS in MD, AnneArundel cty

Hopefully with the new balance coming they won't just melt everything. I hear level 100 super mutants can be a bitch

---
Not necessarily. 
---
Someone from the PTS said they got a Gutter plan from the daily OPs. If true, then we could soon be getting 4 star* legendary melee weapons which could prove to be quite op, especially if the other survival weapons become legendary plans as well
---
plus changing the armors over to " -15% damage from Human" as well, just bring it in line with the other effects like Ghoul Slayer's and Hunter's
---
Well I‚Äôve left the sub and decided I should say bye. What that means to you is your choice.
---
Need the Elders Battlecoat to return.
---
Cool super close. Howard county.
---
I got a furious harpoon gun a little while back and thought to my self this is it, this is what peak performance looks like
---
It‚Äôs a test server, nothing is set in stone at this point. While most of the damage reductions aren‚Äôt as dramatic as people are saying, unarmed definitely seems to be hit exceptionally hard. I‚Äôd be shocked if they don‚Äôt change it. 
---
The interesting thing about this change is that it makes it much clearer which weapons/classes are underperforming. The entire point of that would be to make further balance adjustments, hence releasing it on a PTS where experiments can be done in at scale. Don‚Äôt freak out...yet.
---
What about a gear set bonus ie 7% damage increased for each peice of mutants gear up to 5 pice  so if u have a mutants weapon and 5 armor u would get a 35% dmg bonus. go full mutants gear  for best results, maybe also a set bonus for gear as well I've 3% dmg reduce per price up to 5 for  max of 15%. Nothing too op but another way about it
---
I think it's a general nerf to all weapons so yea no more one taps from bloodied and I noticed not all weapons got heavily nerfed like gauss minigun had only a 32% damage reduction
---
Sometimes when it happens to me if I wait for their body to turn into the meat pile the pile will appear where I killed them (so the ground), tho idk how much you want to wait for it to maybe happen.
---
Well it would be a lie if it was my intention. I pre-ordered so captive from the start. Admittedly I don‚Äôt care whats in the next update, the pattern will stay the same.
---
Yea ill definitely check it out
---
&gt;  We know they weren't thrilled about atomic weapons but that might not extend to a weather control device, especially if they thought it could be used selectively/nondestructively.
---
It's all laid out pretty good IMO. After Mairposa, the horrors of Appalachia, and the commentary on the nuclear option I'd say it's pretty well laid out where they stand about using advanced sciences for destructive purposes.
---
It means you wanted some attention.

Before you go, did you want to speak to a manager, Karen?
---
Sorry, but I shit my pants after reading this üòÖ Lmfao! Can you say just perfect üëå for a moment like this. I feel sorry for the brahmin being killed in this üòî persons camp, but this was just priceless! And I don't even need a master card for entertainment.

The clown car has slammed into ANOTHER wall!

Noooooooo!
---
i mean the ranger outfits 1st gets are based on riot gears. a simlle riot shield shouldnt be unreasonable
---
it's all perspective. Don't worry, stay with it, you'll get there.
---
There is literally no talk or mention of 4* legendary weapons coming lol
---
Tied with the yao gui stagger of death. The charred feral ghoul glancing blow of radworms.
---
Ooof... I run an AA +10% while aiming handmade and I'm hoping I won't see too much of a difference because it's not like my DPS is that high as it is.
---
Nah not playing has been easier. Disc has been on my shelf for weeks now.
---
I mean... you're not -wrong-... They did kind of write themselves into a corner with that. Still, while they don't communicate it too well, my thoughts were either: that message was a lie, meant to help "persuade" the Dwellers out, while the Vault can actually continue functioning for who knows how long... or: it was right, and basically everything shut down already, but due to the size of the Vault, there was still enough food and air for one person to survive, at least for the year until you ultimately leave. That might be verging a bit into "mental gymnastics" like you originally said, admittedly, but it's a bit simpler of an approach than flashbacks, I'd think?
---
ESO handles multi character account wide functionality perfectly, from the champion points system, to player banks and other stuff. Bethesdas main problem is there isnt really anything to do besides gearing your character once you complete the main story so their only option is to make you go through the same shit on every character to try keep you playing. ESO has dungeons, raids, pvp, proffesions a FUNCTIONING economy, literally they should just copy everything the ESO team did and apply it to 76
---
The main thing for me is that I gotta come back every day some days I don't want to play the game but if I want the rewards I gotta
---
Does the Follow Through work like Tenderizer?
---
Funny you mention Karen, as I‚Äôm pretty sure you are hounding me right now lol.
---
I'll try that, I think it used to just remove from your inventory when you completed it
---
This would be a nice addition, definately
---
Nah
---
Any build can one shot a legendary enemy, its all about having the right perks and weapon mods! Bloodied and junkies just makes it easier.
---
Depends
---
Shotguns man. Shotguns
---
It is delayed on 	consoles
---

---
The two I have left in my atom quest I don't think I've seen come up I probably missed out on doing them
---
Also just to poke more fun at them ESO runs flawlessly on console. 4k60
---
Welcome to the wasteland, what üò≥ happens in the wasteland stays in the wasteland. Lol üòÜ
---
Yea it's probably gonna get hit hard too I saw a combat rifle that did like 400+ damage to an abysmal 160 (bloodied combat btw) so I'm thinking HM will get hit hard too
---
I can't disagree with anything you've said.  
---
I have over 800 levels on this game so clearly I love the Fallout franchise and clearly I've enjoyed this game but it's many bugs and the constant grind are making me less interested in playing.  
---
And introduction of a new outfit or emote while ignoring many needed quality of life improvements really needs to change.
---
I don't say they one shot it, they shot it a fuck ton with an explosive hand made and didn't let anyone else tag it
---
Indeed.
---
:-/
---
I'm speaking on the game in the current state not future; I assure you that a majority of players don't care about or play survival mode in Fallout 4 to begin with. Survival mode wasn't even part of the base game if you remember; it was added after launch. If people enjoyed the survival mode like I do they wouldn't be whining to have it removed in the first place. I only play Fallout 4 on survival mode; 76 has better need mechanics and recipes pertaining to items used for those mechanics in every single way. Incase you don't understand Survival mechanics are more than just thirst and hunger; it also entails health, radiation, diseases, carry weight and with 76 mutation management. The mutations alone push 76 ahead of every past game; I don't even need to bring up the other improvements at this point.
---
It's easier to roll secret service gear because you can work on the exact armor bit you're trying to upgrade.
---
I've heard there might be a bug in the PTS right now with how unarmed damage is calculated, so your damage nerf might not be *that* severe once it gets fixed. And there may be further balance changes, for example they can now increase base damage on weapons or introduce new buffs like some of the legendary perks without buff stacking going out of control.
---
But afaik, bloodied melee had the most various damage buffs of any build (the bloodied suite, Unyielding STR, and various consumables), so it will see the biggest nerf with the new damage calculations.
---
Ya, i kno im probably gonna move some base specials around bc the cap for perk cards is still 15 so any legendary specials perk u pick if u max it, then theres no reason to hav the base special higher than 10. Altho having maxed legendary perks is such an endgame grind most wont need to worry about it atm. Ideally id probably run like 4 specials at 15, 2 at 10 and like 1 at 6. Im a melee heavy build but PER has a lot of QoL perks id like to run, but its a dump stat for me rn. If i dont run all 6 as special boosts, the ones for lock picking and ammo are tempting.
---
To be fair it‚Äôs a small but important minority. I don‚Äôt at all mean to discredit the opinions of people on this sub or other forums. I just see a lot of ‚ÄúBethesda did this and they‚Äôre trash!‚Äù when in reality they‚Äôve just entered into a market that operates differently from what the traditional fan base is used to. And again, to be fair, they haven‚Äôt done it perfectly and there is plenty to criticize ‚Äî I just want it to be constructive criticism that they can use to better this game and community.
---
That's why the *asterisk is there.
---
The Gutter has an inherent effect (brief health regeneration and increased damage) like the Fixer.
---
According to the original post, the plan required legendary modules to build, which means you could start rolling assaultron blades with (4) effects. The inherent one is just guaranteed every time. 
---
Is it technically a 4 star? *No.*
---
Is it really close, and the closest we'll get? *Oh hell yeah brother*
---
Edit: quick format
---
Why direct to bloodied build lol, almost anyone with a prominent build can instant kill legendaries. I see more explosive energy gunner do this than bloodied or melee players, given we are the majority.
---
You have a bit of control over this. I have a character with a permanent grimace. Edges of lips turned down, inside eyebrows turned down, both eyelids pulled as tight as possible. He always looks angry!
---
With the perk cards removed, an explosive weapon is actually better as it splash tags.
---
Explosives are pretty shit in this game.
---
TIL Good With Salt is a Luck perk. I always thought it was Agility for some unknowable reason.
---
I'm not in Singapore, but I play from 12AM to 6AM GMT-7, which I believe lines me up with your after work time for a couple hours. DiscoLando, think about it.
---
üòÇ
---
Near Atlas Observatory, on the right middle of the map. Look to the left of the Observatory and down a little. It's at Seneca Rocks visitor centre.
---
I was surprised to get this plan and remembered your post here.
---
I think it's all in the damage multiplayers in play, not an actual base damage reduction. I'm not on the PTS though so just going off what I've gathered from others
---
No, I don't actually remember that. I started gaming in the early '90s and people still did that then.
---
LOL I love the way they can slap me while I am 30 feet in the air.
---
My priorities are the ammo one, the rads one, and the infiltrator one. After that, maybe poison resist, and then more than likely the special boosters.
---
depends. I do it for fun every so often.  It also is a way to play a slot when your scrip is maxed :)
---
If not for the sulphur fountain at whitesprings, I'd have perpetual radworms.
---
I've been playing one character for awhile but decided it's not fun anymore, so I'm switching back to my heavy weapons character, who is a hell of a lot of fun. Problem is, I have absolutely zero interest in doing all the quests necessary with the Overseer, Raiders and Settlers to be allowed to try and get Secret Service armor that suits my character. So I haven't played in several days, and I'm not sure when I'm going back.
---
Thanks! Yeah I have a full set of that, two unyielding legs. I was debating on going for scout armor since I got these scout masks to complete a set.
---
Not on consoles only pc
---
Snap it in half. Have some balls.
---
Oh my god
---
don't forget the XP rewards for creating your own gear. something you don't get with slot machine.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Not unless you aren't planning on getting the best armor in the game, the secret service armor. 
---
You'd be better off hopping to vendors trying to get a matching set of something
---
I was rolling 1s and someone told me it‚Äôs better to try for 3 as you can sell them for good caps if it‚Äôs not what you want. Ever since I‚Äôm only doing 3s
---
I‚Äôm just laughing my ass off at your passive-aggressive temper tantrum. 
---
This isn‚Äôt an airport. You don‚Äôt need to announce your departure. 
---
Your runway is clear. Just take off, hoser.
---
Agreed, I don't mess with Yao gui and I try to set up so I only have to deal with one ghoul at a time or I can walk backwards away from them while I attack, like across the golf cousre
---
"Doc, it burns when I pee..."
---
Well more points in agility will make stealth pistol builds easier.
---
Kinda yes, but you need to do ranged sneak damage to trigger the effect. 
---
Tenderizer: "Make your target receive 7% more damage for 10 seconds after you attack."
---
Follow Through: "Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 40% for 60 seconds."
---
Would be the worst time to have that problem!
---
Im not angry?
---
Had this issue with my older Xbox. Had to open and clean it out, it couldnt breathe. Havent had an issue since. It happens when there is too much to process and gets overheated trying to process. It causes a stagger on screen then drops to dashboard. Let it get worse i hear it shuts off the xbox, and at one point permanently. 
---
I used a youtube video for opening and cleaning, if you need help, i can get in a discord chat or something and help along as well.
---
Why pick and choose when ACP is permanent and meat week isnt?
---
You seem to be very emotional on the subject of me leaving Fo76. I‚Äôm sorry that you have to experience so many mixed feelings on hearing the news.
---
I didn‚Äôt say you were angry. I said passive-aggressive. 
---
You‚Äôre disgruntled and want everyone to know it. 
---
Congratulations. We know. 
---
So now just go. 
---
What else are you trying to accomplish?
---
I play on Xbox but I've always heard is a .2% chance of dropping but don't know where/how to verify that
---
Good luck. The yellow asylum uniform has a 0.10% chance and the forest asylum outfit has a 0.09% chance to spawn and it took 130 hours of looking for the red one before i found them. BUT i found them within an hour of each other and within the next 10 hours of red hunting i found another of each one. Never did find a red.
---
Just buy one. they go for less than 30k
---
Thank zenimax and their greed for these issues
---
The only emotion is amusement that you thought anyone would care. 
---
Bye, Felicia.
---
lol
---
How much do you need
---
Did this exact same thing cause I found an amazing double barrel junkies shotgun. Few tweaks and additions and I'm one shoting a lot of stuff.
---
Taking One for the Team does the same thing too...problem is how long it lasts.
---
I saw a jerk like this at Uranium Fever a few weeks ago. He‚Äôd KO legendary Mole Miners with an explosive mini-gun over and over again.
---
Yeah but when you said temper-tantrum you certainly had assumed I‚Äôm angry.       
---
         
---
It is easy to call me an attention seeker abroad, but what on earth are you?
---
Mods are good to use
---
WHAT THE FUCK MAN!!
---
I was just talking to my friends about stocking up on ammo and stimpak to try this tomorrow because ‚Äúit finally being release‚Äù goddamn
---
Me too... I play a Junkie's (Vanguard) build. FFS
---
just a 1\* 
---
use this for a rough idea  [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
Ok bye
---
Are you looking to buy
---
I've had about enough of this cattle rustlin' and it's time we do something about it.
---
The guy laughing at you and mocking you. 
---
You‚Äôre the one that posted this, not me.
---
Well yea, but i really don't want to get hit as a bloodied stealth commando :) Even more so now as there are harder hitting mobs around (lv100).
---
Guess that leaves the last laugh for me.
---
Honestly I think Bethesda could get a small shred of respect back if they instead of constantly releasing new outfits, camp items and such to the atomic shop just made it so they where unlock-able through existing challenges or even new ones, for example the Blood Eagle Pack? Make those unlockable by killing a certain number of blood eagles, discover all their camps, complete all of beckets quests. But nope, always has to be ¬£10 for the cool new stuff with actually very little free content drops in between.
---
Like when you actually compare with how much content they add to the game as opposed to what they add to the AS its disgusting.
---
That could actually add immersion though. Do you join them because they're too tough to fight? Or do you side with another faction and fight back because you dislike the brotherhood?
---
The console tax is too heavy for PST 
---
Do those game have PST or beta/early access?!? Because it 2 different thing..
---
We‚Äôll see, won‚Äôt we?
---
You‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs supposed to be leaving. You sure seem intent on sticking around instead.
---
I'm really starting to think that fallout 76 is absolutely fucked on consoles. Delays, performance issues and it beats pc in bugs tenfold.
---
You will see. I won‚Äôt :)
---
100%. I don't get why people care what others have. I just enjoy what I have. I also like to make camps showing things off :) for others to enjoy
---
Get on a team with him and share sun kissed and wash a way his rads lol
---
Nah. I‚Äôll still be here, laughing at you. 
---
I thought you were leaving?  You can‚Äôt even seem to do *that* right, lol.
---
I use ~3 at a time... it‚Äôs becoming a problem
---
Alright thanks. Also happy cake day
---
Ah, so you‚Äôre finally leaving?
---
Damn. Took you long enough, son.
---
The northern parts of Ohio are, the parts of Ohio present on the game map are much like the actual Forest region in game.
---
I'm confused? There is a cap for level 100 to 1000? About 16k a level up regardless if you are level 101 or level 586
---
Yes, it sucks üòï but sometimes we all got to take one for the team. And on another note, if you play long enough Legendary items will become an absolute  non essential item, trust me they are so over rated. And I am not trying to be a dick about it üòí there is so much more to this game. 
---
Just find a build that works and a couple of great weapons  and the rest is history. I have been using the same 3 weapons since launch, sure you get Legendary script for selling them maybe a few caps, but it really doesn't matter in the end game my friend.
---
I‚Äôd recommend against it.  Armor has some high value mods to be sure, but you can bank on most everyone rolling SS (with varying amounts of luck) reducing the value of mid-tier armor.  God rolls are still god rolls but if you‚Äôre rolling to sell, not much luck.  Rolling to keep?  May as well do SS, since you can focus on what you need.
---
I could buy one, but like you aptly stated at the beginning, the sheer grind required to obtain one provides a high incentive to hoard what you find. Even online the cheapest price I found was $20, which is expensive compared to everything else.
---
Did you not understand the post?
---
Check this out https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks should answer any questions
---
Tennessee ernie door
---
Yeah, that's why I only swap between the two torso pieces. Losing 20 carry weight is worth the ability to scale cliffs/buildings when I need to.
---
Make killing players worth a brahmin!
---
It's effectively a balance change. Unarmed Bloodied depends heavily on abusing the current system to generate super high damage, so it gets hit hardest. 
---
I'm sorry you feel picked on, but 500 per hit isn't exactly awful. You're still going to have a very good build compared to the other options if they implement the changes.
---
Of fucking course it would be.üôÑ
---
I left last week. Im on reddit rn. Not fallout ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I understood you were leaving. But you‚Äôre not leaving.
---
I don‚Äôt think *you* understood your post.
---
Mods alone prevent 76 from being better than previous Fallouts.
---
yea!!
---
Ah!  So you‚Äôre going to be a non-player that hangs out in a subreddit for a game you no longer play. 
---
That‚Äôs seems mentally unhealthy. And quite pathetic.
---
So you understand what I wanted to say on my post better than I did?         
---
        
---
You must be a genius and I must have no logic, incredible.
---
Agree with that. I would love more budget in my camp for decorative things, so I could do fancy things with lights and posters and so on. As it is I have hardly anything in my camp and it's maxed out. I'm not very artistic but I want to try to make something nice, and all I'm left with is what feels like an empty, tiny building.
---
Almost everything I've spent atoms on has been camp objects, yet I haven't been buying more even though I want to because I can't figure out how to get budget to display the things I do have.
---
Nah, I left the sub today and dropped this love letter on my way out. Looks like you‚Äôre in to romance.
---
Actually exp required for 101 and 586 are completely different.
---
Exp for lvl 101 is 16,040exp while exp for lvl 586 is 93,640exp.
---
i could share some on discord, idk how to use imgur or anything like that
---
They should rework more of the effects overall
---
Oh, I get it. You‚Äôre a non-player that is going to hang out on a sub for a game you don‚Äôt play. 
---
That‚Äôs incredibly sad and pathetic. You have my pity.
---
On my list of concerns for this game, those would be pretty low
---
Yep, took a pylon today and never even saw the ISS. She was dead as soon as her shield went down. At least I got a white wolf fedora for my time.
---
As far as I‚Äôve heard, the queen is immune to explosions. I.e. grenades explosive weapons
---
Edit: explosive damage on explosive weapons
---
You keep guessing wrong. Do you want to structure a question?      
---
Also you‚Äôre really boring to talk to.
---
&gt; on my way out
---
So leave already. 
---
How many times are you going to say goodbye?
---
I have said goodbye. And you decided to talk to me?
---
u/LadyDevann u/Valseek u/lonevaultwanderer
---
there are new rewards
---
But you keep coming back. After you said you were leaving. 
---
Make up your mind. Are you staying or going?
---
I would say it was a decent deal
---
I got a bunch of fixes higher up but they‚Äôre not fixing them soooo
---
Nope. You can only do it once per nuke like SBQ, but you can easily do it in 8min, nuke it again, do it again, nuke it again and do it again.
---
I get what you are saying. I have many make their way to the 'black hole'.  Same with caps. I've watched much go into the ether.  That's just the way it goes. I'm not upset or even bothered. What you're asking for, simply requires too much extra work by the devs, to go back in time (better things to spend time on).  I still have about 50 packs. I lost 100+ ... I just now got my first good with salt, after 1000 hrs.
---
Remember that terrble pete hines interview where he blamed youtuber's for fallout 76's failure and then tried to say for wastelanders they needed to tell devs to stop adding new lines of dialogue "because there was too much".
---
We all knew what he was trying to say, but it came off as tone deaf, esp. considering the lack of content we got in wastelanders and how we only have actual 2 companions,3 "lightfollowers", and 3-5 faction repeatable quests. All of them which are exactly the same dialogue and text/choices ....just in different locations. Woohoo.....
---
They needed several times more content if they wanted players to play everyday. They should have had expansion content by now or new areas, instead we barely get base game improved upon.
---
You cannot stop crime, say goodbye to every brahmin in the world
---
Only the memories. They can‚Äôt take them away.
---
Hey at least they didn't hear a 3rd party company to write the code and forget to secure the rights and then drop that developer and hire a new one and have to literally rewrite the code. The way Bethesda has been handling games lately, makes me worried for future games.
---
Yes.  To see if you were actually leaving. 
---
You‚Äôre clearly not. 
---
So make up your mind. Stay or go, but close that damn door, you‚Äôre letting all the air conditioning out, kid.
---
I haven‚Äôt come back once. Havent touched the game in over a week. Replying to your dumbass doesnt count as playing fallout 76.
---
Yes, I understand this. 
---
But I've had interesting discussions where it was argued explosive variants of non explosive weapons (Ie. VE .50 cal vs a non legendary .50 cal) will still do marginally more damage, so i wanted to hear if anyone else has thoughts.
---
Using this example, will both weapons do *equal* damage, or will the VE do *less* damage, or would the stock do *less* damage compared to VE?
---
Explosive don‚Äôt work on her, I tested it using my strongest gun I did lower damage in her than anything else, I ended up using a gauss Gatling
---
On my main, yes.
---
Kid, I‚Äôm not talking about playing the game. I‚Äôm talking about these replies. 
---
That‚Äôs where you ‚Äòkeep coming back‚Äô. 
---
Are you leaving the sub or not?
---
The process should be the same, except that Fallout 76 is located within your steam directory instead of your Beth.net directory.
---
but some details, i have a starcase on the first floor, which houses all benches, beds and vendors, then i have a starcase leading up to the second floor which is completely open, i have upper floors spanning the full radius of my camp, from there i counted inwards 2 floors or spaces and started building a wall in a circle , this means that there is a square ish circle on the inside of the second floor with space for players to walk on that is two upper floors in length, from there i started placing single stairs in a "/\\" formation so that players can use that as a raised platform to stand and shoot inside the arena. the floor of the arena is mostly solid with the parts that cover my house as the transparent floors with turrets in the first floor shooting up
---
I have left.       
---
(Has happened).      
---
I dont play anymore.        
---
Why do you keep saying I‚Äôm coming back to fallout? I never said this lol.
---
I kill myself for selling Forest asylum for like 10 caps having no idea what it was worth.
---
I never said you were coming back to the game, bud. I said you keep coming back to this sub and replying.
---
Your commenting on my post, of course I will reply.         
---
Has no resemblance to my status playing the game.
---
some people have more than one =0 some people get extremely lucky. 
---
I had the urban and traded something like 10k cloth for the forest one.
---
There are power plant workshops that have fusion core generators that will generate those for you but be careful with those in public games since other players can attempt to steal them from you (leads to you choosing between attempting to win at PVP or just letting them take it). I just do it on my private server to prevent those problems but that is only possible if you have fallout 1st. Alternatively, if you have a friend who has fallout 1st they can open a private server that you can join but the server will close a few minutes after everyone with fallout 1st leaves. You could also find a place where power armor spawns, remove the core from the spawned armor, server hop, and repeat whenever possible.
---
Feel the same way.
---
Ok. So it did lower than *any* thing else you had, great. 
---
Have you noticed this same behavior against regular scorch beasts?
---
I notice explosive weapons vs regular scorch beasts show less damage in the game feedback numbers, but in reality take it down just as quickly, if not quicker, than non explosive variants.
---
Someone also suggested this damage calculator was current: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
If you play around with it, it shows explosives doing more dps vs SBQ, if all else is equal. Anyone else familiar with this damage calculator?
---
That I do not know sir. My guess is that if you had a vampire 50 Cal and a VE 50 Cal, they would both do the same damage, but don‚Äôt quote me on it. I‚Äôm not sure how that works honestly. I just know I try not to use explosives at queens. I run shotguns, I don‚Äôt use explosives really ever on shotguns. I‚Äôm following tho because I‚Äôd like to know the answer
---
Ah, so you have no self control!  You‚Äôre compelled to reply to anyone that replies to you?
---
You‚Äôre behind schedule then. There‚Äôs a **LOT** of people in this thread you haven‚Äôt yet replied to. 
---
Go get caught up on those.
---
Also:  *you‚Äôre

Easy peezy get a good gun and the marsupial serum from enclave, and daylight rad cure perk.
---
here i am bloodied, tanking all 3 plyons, not getting my tag in on the event i payed for with my keycard because 14 level 300 leeches cannot be fucked to grab one pylon even once.
---
For me it was slightly more but not a whole lot idk if it‚Äôs different for other people
---
its a common idea, but it wasnt me, i started this idea this morning, or my rendition of it. but yeah, i find people like that admirable because they are using resources of theirs to help everyone fight in the long run
---
So if I move my CAMP do I get the budget back if I scrap it?
---
Up to about 40. My current char has no STR. Between 3 or 4 weapons, armor and aid, that puts me around 200/240
---
I can't seem to finish the hologames challenge either.
---
I've found the last two several times (zetan invaders and atomatons) and it still won't finish, even when I try to play the games.
---
That would be dope. Sometimes I wish this was single player so that there was a terf war aspect to the game.
---
Around 220.  I'm a PA heavy gunner, and I carry the gatling gun with a few thousand rounds and the plasma gatling with a dozen cores. As long as I have minimum 200 available for loot, I'm happy.
---
Seriously, the raiders all have hairstyles that the player character can't use. Put them in the shop and leave them there!
---
Omg, yes! Having gone through the faction reputation grind with my main character and realizing that the good weapons aren‚Äôt really suited for that build, made me pretty frustrated. I don‚Äôt think I can bear doing it again with my heavy gunner build...
---
These plans or at least unlocking them should really be account wide.
---
A group of about 6 people take the event on in the video linked below and from when the blockage falls (at 25 minutes remaining) to when they kill him it takes 7 minutes even. I don't know about magic weapons but at least one of the people who shows up is definitely using a legacy weapon (explosive gatling plasma from the looks of it).
---
https://youtu.be/lSeEIHtD0HY
---
You seem really fascinated in talking to someone leaving the game. Can I offer you a DM so you stop ranting my comments?
---
no power armor?
---
i Mean why is your carry so low?
---
Well if you played it for 2 years then I say you got your money's worth. Maybe it is time to move on.
---
It's just silly to me when people announce their exit. Like yeah, you bought a game, you played it, you don't enjoy it anymore and you stop playing. This has happened with literally every gamer with every single game that's ever been made...why is this important?
---
What the hell are you running on a potato?
---
It has nothing to do on Beth end if it‚Äôs that bad for you. When everyone else is mostly fine.
---
If you set it up with the concept that you would go into a temporary cryosleep, or whatever really, you could have an interface like the social tab where you could select your other characters and invite them like another person, but instead you're just bringing them out of cryosleep to play them like a simulation, "Wink, Wink!" It fits with my no-holds barred related to Lore viewpoint of Fallout 76. Say that all of your characters you made are in your shelter in your, "Fallout Shelter".
---
The only thing you'd need is a persistent protected container, whether it was something that the player could build or using some of the space inside the stash box, OR a special marking for items in your stash for an account wide object, like um, maybe an Atom Shop sign? Then, you'd really just need to be able to rejoin the world that you were just on. The rest of it would just be graphics and story elements - doesn't sound all that complex to streamline something that you can already accompish;)
---
nm i thoughmt your max was 220.  220 free is awesome
---
I say Buff 'em  
---
Im unarmed so i love getting up close and personal with those charred fucks
---
Could be a stall tactic, could be legit. Either way gotta roll with it. As long as meat week is coming it‚Äôs all gravy.
---
Nah. You can stay out of my DMs. I‚Äôm not into that. 
---
Besides, it‚Äôs more amusing to watch you flail in public. You‚Äôre the one that wanted the attention, and now you want to ‚Äògo private‚Äô. 
---
Sorry. I‚Äôm not interested in your OnlyFans subscription.
---
My carry is 330.  I usually carry 110 in gear and supplies, hence a free space of 220
---
A stock weapon and an explosive variant will both have the same base damage. The explosive will be added separately but how much it will be can vary wildly depending on enemy resistances. SBQ is very resistant to explosives and I've had weapons doing 1/10th the added damage compared to some other critters. In general Anti-armour, Zealots or Hunters are good for SBQ fights.as she counts as an Armoured Scorched Animal.

---
The performance of this game has been steadily going down with each update.
---
Im able to carry 140 most of the time got 190 on me. Got no weight reduction perks
---
There‚Äôs an obvious disconnect between departments, and one between departments and management. And management and their user base. Disconnects like these are more common than not in every company I‚Äôve worked for, and Bethesda is under a lot more pressure to crank things out a lot more quickly. I guarantee it‚Äôs not a fun place to be a developer for, you‚Äôre going to be almost u over sally reviled and blamed for everything that goes wrong because they‚Äôre probably at the bottom of the pecking order.
---
GT: dydamas. Level 17 right now. I'll be on in a couple of hours.
---
Dude same, junkies shotguns are "magic" right now.
---
Using vats with shotguns that have "magic" perks performs "magic" damage. 
---
It's so wonderful.
---
What you said applies to you as much as me. But for you makes less sense.        
---
What has me in stitches is that up until now you thought that if I reply it means I‚Äôm still playing or something lol?
---
Don‚Äôt cushioned leg mods work like fall damage ? So you can add that effect pretty easily
---
omg. i will now go out of my way to find you on xbox and join your team as often as humanly possible and kill all the legandarys before anyone else can blink.
---
Oh sorry if I wasn't clear, more just wanting exp required to level up to be capped. I know all my duplicate perks I lost are long gone but knowing each level I advance makes it more difficult to get more is rather demoralizing. Also congrats on 1000+ hours hit though, no where close to that yet and only at lvl 325 as of today with one alt at lvl 100+.
---
Well I still intend on using reddit. Thought I should leave a review.
---
Your reading comprehension needs work. At no point did I say I thought you were still playing the game. 
---
Your replies mean you aren‚Äôt leaving *the sub*.
---
Which is contrary to [what you said](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ibpyqz/i_like_to_buy_something_good_not_buy_something/g1xiiq1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Name one person here that honestly cares that you‚Äôre leaving.  Because so far, no one seems to.
---
That made laugh.  Too bad I just spent my last coins or you would get one too.
---
Look at you trying to instill law and order in a post apocalypse wasteland! That's cute, but... NO!

Isn't PoE a free to play game? Meaning that their only revenue comes from microtransactions? Whereas FO76 charges you up front for the game, has microtransactions, and a subscription with paid convenience. I don't personally mind the fo76 setup but its anything but consumer friendly and triple-dips on revenue.
---
Yes, my question is because it *feels* like SBQs damage feedback numbers negate 90% of *all* damage produced by an explosive ballistic weapon, rather than just the 20% thats supposed to be explosive. 
---
But because SBQ fights are often long, im wondering whether the numbers are displayed wrong, or if using explosive guns means I am doing 10% of my usual dps, and would be better served to even use a stock non legendary version of the same gun. 
---
An academic question, as the only practicality of it would be reducing weight if I don't feel like I *have* to have designated non explosive guns for queens.
---
The friend you made!
---
I would actually use the wrapped cap if it was fixed
---

Happened to me on project paradise. Felt it was a bit unfair given I do so much on the other parts and got no reward because I wasn't fast enough
---
it's not something I think about. I play 6-10 hrs/day depending on day. It's kinda sad really. But with all the lockdown stuff, it's what has kept me sane (I think).
---
Seems most of these responses are pointing towards overheating which is probably right as its from 2013 never been dusted inside. Might give it a go or just try a strong vacuum cleaner
---
I guess I should clarify: Capitalism as it is handled by members of FO76s community is bad

You appear the likes of imposter syndrome. How you are capable of arguing so long with a stranger on the internet is beyond determination.

Seems a bit bipolar mate.

Constantly criticising those around you because you feel incompetent.

I feel sorry for you.
---
They reduce damage a lot, but not completely. You can still die quite easily if you're bloodied.
---
Trust me, open it. As long as you follow a youtuber it wont have a negative on it. Mine is from 2013 as well and it really needed to be opened for all the cleaning

Its a gift what can I say.

If you're not at 30k, you will receive however many caps will put you at 30k, anything over that goes to the void.

I think it‚Äôs 50% per mod like the legendary effect? Think they both cap at 90%? I thought it was the same.

With other games, the developers try to make progress and improve the experience.
---
If you say so. My pc can run it fine on low and it‚Äôs 8 years old. PS4 and Xbox runs fine as well. Not the smoothest but more then serviceable. 
---
The guy ranting needs to work on his mindset.
---
They already addressed it once, and probably about as good as you can. You used to not get the prompt that let's you choose another server.
---
What you are asking requires getting information from the server. So on some level you have to load into the server to get that information. What they could possibly do is not fully load before checking the coordinates, but they would have to do that for *everyone*. Now you are slowing down load in for everyone for something that is a minor annoyance for a few.

It's only worth it if you want to use any rolls as a potential trade. For example I rolled a J2525 Handmade from the Purveyor and I traded it for a B2525 Handmade. :)

[Battlefield 4's progression system](https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_4_online_ranks) was not a battle-pass. It was the primary ranking system, no? Also unless I am misremembering you could not purchase ranks directly. In any case, I played Battlefield 4 for around 50-60 hours and never maxed it out and never cared to. Fallout76 on the other hand I have invested tenfold in, and has very nice camp rewards locked behind a lot of levels (raider tree, firefly jar, hidden door, chicken coop, planetarium etc). 
---
What your argument and others like it does is ignore how players (not insubstantial number) play the game in favor of forcing you to grind by doing these challenges as part of a much deeper systemic grindy game design filled with time-gating and artificial delays already. I build and rebuild my camp, launch nukes, camp hop and player vend, and maybe pepper in some events. I'll admit they watered it down quite a bit with the additional challenges, and if I really set my mind to it I am sure I could reach 100 before the timer is up. But that is not the point, and never has been. The point is that its a monetization system designed to extract time and money and they leverage some very cool looking rewards to "encourage" you to do so and then simultaneously punish you for investing in other ways like with all the currency caps. Its a grind because it is, and its a burn-out because it is and requires un-fun daily investment to reach. I say this as someone with over 900 hours in the game and max raider/settler rep who just got home from a long and stressful day on a bitch of a Monday on one of the hottest day in California. I do not want to capture a workshop 5 times and fill it with 5-20 of each category of camp object (which is a currently weekly challenge as I post this). 
---
So sure, it can be accomplished efficiently just like anything else in the game. But video-games (fallout most of all some would argue) are as far away from that as you could be and for good reason. I paid 60 bucks initially, I pay 13 bucks a month, and god knows I've directly bought a good chunk of atoms for my hard earned dough for some of the cooler camp objects. I don't need this shitty ass system and neither does anyone else.
---
Thanks! I am on a quest to get unyielding sentinels scout armor...was just wondering whether anyone has ever had good luck with it
---
Bloodied is the only thing that makes laser rifles worth using
---
no nerfs
---
She's got high DR so damage from ballistics is reduced, and high ER which will also reduce explosive damage. Compared to a battle with a 3* SB your numbers will be far lower because despite being seemingly identical the Q is much tougher skinned. It does not matter what the weapon type is she will negate a far higher percentage of the damage.
---
I believe there is a sale in Sept, so if you can might be worth it to wait till then.
---
" But with all the lockdown stuff, it's what has kept me sane (I think). "
---
Can agree with you there, stuck home since I'm the only one of my siblings who can support my parents who are over 65 thus working from home and have to be careful since my parents are over the age where covid is risky. Jealous one of my sisters went on vacation to Florida(really good prices right now) but thank god for Fallout 76 and Xbox Game Pass for keeping me sane. Really hope the vaccine gets done soon so I can actually work at the office instead of staying home all day.
---
You're immune to fall damage with 2 fall reduction pieces.. You are not with the cushioned mods. I have tested it
---
I just did and it was a pain bc my build is mostly melee
---
Fucking them over without them even knowing it... That's brilliant
---
Clearly you haven‚Äôt been on other games subreddits. Bethesda is known for being buggy but everyone, everywhere complains that the developers don‚Äôt pay attention to them.
---
In the past 4 months: Wastelanders, Seasons, Colossal Problem this week. Contained things like new weapons, ammo conversion machines, new consumables like like lunchboxes. Numerous bug fixes, although that doesn‚Äôt mean everything is working well. But I think they deserve some credit.
---
Check the downvotes from the fanboys on my comments. People can't prefer other games, mate. We should all have the same opinion or else we'll never become a true echo chamber.(as if that was ever a good thing)
---
I'm bloodied (recent conversion), but even at full health my power fist still 1-hits everything, including legendaries.  
---
So uh, yeah.
---
Blame Bethesda for not have event-wide shared mob loot. With One Appalachia the game *needs* that to be changed, more than ever.
---
Long live arm jetpacks
---
Name one person that cares:       
---
u/AFUSMC74       
---
AFUSMC47 kindly tried to persuade me into staying before becoming a manic ballistic karen in a multithread argument.
---
I'm a bloody build and I can't one shot anything. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
---
100% the same. I prefer going into the office.  Going to Florida is nuts. My brothers family all tested + 2 weeks ago.  My brother went on the ventilator Sat night and sits in induced coma. So FO76 has been helping me keep my mind off things.   My ass isn't going shopping in a store for nothing, deliver that shit.
---
The problem isn't that that he was one shoting them, he was camping the spawns and gunning them down before anyone could tag them
---
Damn thats zen bro
---
Should also make players wanted when they activate my trip-wire.
---
If you're on PC you can download the Text chat mod on nexus mods. It's crazy how much it changes your experience, and a decent amount of people use it too.

I would so like to see a baby deathclaw driving a model-T

Fucking taxes.
---
Your reading comprehension is flawed yet again. 
---
I don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre leaving. I‚Äôm asking you why you haven‚Äôt done so yet. 
---
I‚Äôm curious about your hypocrisy, not whether or not you‚Äôre leaving. 
---
But let‚Äôs clarify it a bit better for you; Name one person that cared about you possibly leaving this sub **before** you posted this today.
---
And if I‚Äôm the only one that you think would have cared, then don‚Äôt make a public post to tell me goodbye. That‚Äôs just creepy.
---
And you can‚Äôt even spell my name right, lol.
---
Food build!  &lt;3
---
Sorry for introducing confusion. I should have added an example. 
---
I have used a primed JE laser rifle against her next to a primed Jffr laser rifle against her. 
---
The jffr showed higher damage numbers in the feedback, sometimes by as much as 50% or more compared to the JE 
---
This also happens when fighting regular SB. But JE will take down SB much faster, while showing lower numbers.
---
Shouldn't the numbers be equal?
---
get cloudy's mod manager and direct it to what ever drive your steam games are on/steam/steam apps/common/fallout 76/ data. file path should be something like that and then fly all the mods you want and click install a mod from cloudy's menu pick what ever you downloaded. you don't have to even extract them. and you're done
---
Reminds me of the preserved body of a dude jackin it while Pompeii is on fire from the volcano
---
You don't have a hacked or legacy weapon.  Those people do.  You're actually playing the game it is intended to be played and they aren't.  There's a reason the weapons those people are using were removed from the game.
---
Where'd you get this info from?
---
was rank 45 till a storm knocked my power out for 3 days
---
My Gatling gun does 650 damage without chems plus they are glowing so I do 60% more with glow sight. It‚Äôs little wonder how I one shot.
---
In fact that‚Äôs way over kill.
---
Very interesting thank you
---
pubg literally has a test server
---
Because he‚Äôs an attention sponge. And it‚Äôs been exceptionally amusing watching him ‚Äòleave/not-leave‚Äô.
---
&gt; I‚Äôd be shocked if they don‚Äôt change it.
---
Bear in mind that when they did the big TSE nerf ages ago, they left the missile launcher, fat man, and broadsider in a useless state ever since and never bothered to fix them.
---
This doesn't bode well for unarmed. I hope I'm wrong, but the signs are not good...
---
It will either spill its milk or it‚Äôs blood
---
I want a grumpy face, my character's face has received MAXIMUM DAMAGE so i want him to have grumpy face to compliment it.
---
So you're seriously expecting the mouth breathers in this sub to click a link?
---
It's not even getting pushed back a full fucking week, they're just delaying it a few DAYS so they can make 100% sure everything works perfectly on the PC live build before they ship it to consoles.
---
I've explained it a million times but hotfixing for consoles FUCKING SUCKS because of console certs.  If they release this event and something goes wrong that even the PTS didn't pick up on then console players would be fucked for at least another week if not longer while they fixed it and then submitted for another console cert.
---
But let's be real, Bethesda is never going to get a handle on duping, and I feel they think that too. Thats why they impose these BS caps because they can't put in the effort.
---
Pc only üò≠
---
That‚Äôs absolute rubbish, I can 1 shot the ghouls with my bloodied handmade or fixer
---
They could get Cattle-AIDS which severely debuffs their stats making it where they can't carry much and also infects their alts for increasing amounts of time every time they do it. Eventually, it will permanently erase that character and no way to get it back b/c that's beyond level asshole.
---
Something to do late game finally
---
Yup, look at him plotting to run across the street when he seeing coming by with my power armor. He just wants me to crash into a tree so he can pick pocket me!
---
People generally would like the game to run smooth.
---
I‚Äôd smash
---
Always thought Anndale from FO3 was based on that area.
---
Don‚Äôt need to be bloodied to one shot them either.
---
Get a normal fixer and shoot it‚Äôs head.
---
Hey you guys bitching about nefs in the PTS? This is why.
---
Post them on the official forum if you want more of a chance to be heard.
---
I really appreciate it, thanks bud:)
---
Was just showing that with ops weapon it‚Äôs easy
---
If you are sneak &amp; commando with a bloodied handmade u should be able to one head shot most enemies in VATS. 
---
Put all commando perks in. Concentrated fire, and with your unyielding then you shouldn‚Äôt miss too much in VATS. Stay hidden and get sneak headshot, it‚Äôs how I do it, even on Queen fights.
---
They have goven up on whales like you; people who will pay a big price while others buy none, to instead focus on making everyone buy. But now with gold in PTS, you can buy any plans you missed out on before
---
New to the game only started playing a few weeks after it came on steam. Can someone explain to me what is meat week? Thanks.
---
Stop hoarding. Sell what you aren‚Äôt going to use within the next week.
---
Use your consumables. That‚Äôs why they exist.
---
I rather they catch bugs on pc because it's easier to roll back on
---
I used to ignore them but this isn‚Äôt this first post of seen of people complaining about this useless animal and super cheap repair.  Now I kill every single one I see.
---
Congrats to the OP, just like when you were in middle school, your whining is getting you bullied more
---
And if I saw a dude with a SIGN at his base about that stupid cow I‚Äôll make several trips back to your base to kill him
---
It's a bug everytime I log on I have to take my SS chest piece off and put it on again before the jet pack shows up.  Started with the last update.
---
If it‚Äôs a problem you absolutely should have to plant it.
---
&gt; the level 62 Charred Feral Ghouls urgently need a nerf
---
Actually, with One Appalachia, these guys might be getting buffed, depending on your level of course.  
---
Level 62 is what they max out at now, but after the next big update they'll probably max out at level 100.
---
Anyway, I don't find the poo-bodies threatening at all. Get level 3 Blocker perk, and you'll be able to stand there and laugh at their pitiful damage.
---
100% agree with every word I say, I hate how they strip out the most basic mechanic (looting) behind a paywall. Even though they literally promised that the game will have unlimited storage before release 
---
Hoarding junk is my favorite thing about the fallout games, I just like exploring and looting around. Once I‚Äôm done with the wastelanders questline I‚Äôm going back to 4 or New Vegas, not gonna deal with the bullshit that is 76
---
This is saying pc not console. Says console won‚Äôt be effected
---
Yeah I don't have all the commando perks in and I don't have concentrated fire. Thank you.
---
No, there isn‚Äôt. Just because the table doesn‚Äôt show you the data for levels 101 through 999 doesn‚Äôt mean it stays the same.
---
It shows you the formula right under the chart.
---
[The Fallout Wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level)
---
I am a player who started shortly before the Fasnach Event.  I attended that event maybe 100 times while it was active.  Not a single time did any of the veteran players wait for me to tag the Legendary Megasloth before they killed it.  ZERO.
---
Now I have moved up in levels and I can one shot legendaries.  Can you guess how I feel about waiting for others to come and get a shot in?
---
Than either eat ur flesh or plant its demon spawn babies in your corpse lol
---
This.  Server hop then talk to ditches first
---
Well said.  I'm glad to see someone else bring up FFXIV as a model for how this sm could have been handled, though unfortunately I think we have already gone past the chance of that eventuality.  It's clear that Bethesda rotates teams on this game or something and right now we mostly have the skeleton crew   pushing out Score system updates while the Wastelanders team is on Brotherhood stuff for next or something else and the QA team is on permanent vacation except a validation script.  I have described the situation as leadership asleep at the wheel.
---
My attitude has soured since we started getting detail on the Legendary Perk system and the score update just made it curdle even more.  At this point, I liked the game more before I finished Wastelanders and I wish I had taken my time with it.  
---
I keep saying it so maybe I'll start a clap chant.  All üëè we üëè needed üëè was more üëè rep üëè content.
---
Is it possible its triggering a "drowning" effect? I've seen this too when I had a camp there but usually the brahmin is like kinda underwater. Enough to the point where I thought the game was triggering the drowning effect but the brahmin has nothing programmed in it to detect that. Now that I'm thinking about it I think ALL of Bethesda games have this issue, I seem to remember guards in Oblivion never surfacing for air despite drowning.
---
Should I keep using the bloodied handmade or should I switch to a bloodied gauss rifle and build?
---
Same, mine is always invisible when I first log in. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Are you maxing out your stats with unyielding armor, using + damage food/buffs?
---
Bartering posts aren‚Äôt allowed on this sub. Try the other Fallout 76 subs for that.
---
Yes on the armor, no on the food and buffs.
---
I was probably around level 25 when I first got him and realized I can‚Äôt get meat for him and fertilizer is pretty useless. Kill away.
---
Thank you, I honestly thought sharing this wouldn't be the best idea, I had one obnoxious twonk saying this is bullshit and I'm just doing it for upvotes but honestly although upvotes seem like a small way of connecting with the community I've had some wonderful feedback and it's been really nice. I wish he could see all of these lovely messages. I will, I'm due a camp move/rejig so I might see how I can expand on this
---
You just said in your post that it takes you 5-10 shots to kill ghouls in radiation rumble, but now you're saying you *can* one shot them?  Which is it?
---
Ghouls are weaker than most other mobs in the game and shouldn't take much to kill.
---
Other enemies have different resistances.  If you're not 1-shotting things like gulpers, then that is to be expected.   You need to understand that those other players are likely using weapons with much higher damage than yours because they're using legacy or hacked weapons.
---
I will say though, by not playing stealth, you're losing out on damage multipliers which would lower your damage output significantly.  A stealth build with max covert operative will do 2.5x more damage than you as long as they stay stealthed.
---
GT: BipBipFool, Lvl 25, American but on at random times.
---
Same thing with One Violent Night as well. If you're the one actually progressing the event, you lose out on all the exp from tagging houls and any legendary spawns. Too many times I've seen it fail because people are just there camping the ghoul spawns outside.
---
Best part is even if a teammate gets a tag, unless you're nearby, you'll not get looting credit for the legendary. Sometimes you don't even get that if you're right next to it too. Happens a lot in Radiation Rumble because the tunnels are rather far apart.
---
IMHO you should get score for every thing you do in varied amounts.
---
Dude I know right? I got jumped scared by a super mutant behemoth and did a quick vats and two shots took it down. It was ridiculous.
---
Let the pc players ride the titanic. Who know what will happen. certainly not Beth lol.
---
Try using Blocker 3. Turns them into puppies.
---
Some items, and also as covered it requires another daily investment capped at 200/day and 300/week.
---
edit: Forgot to add I just logged in for the day to cash out on 150 scrip for the day in spite of having a plethora of banked legendary items which is yet another cap on something I could enjoy if given the freedom to.
---
Ok thanks for that
---
I'm heavy tank ty for the mention I 1 shot flamer anything thats not "tough" they take me about 2 full tanks of fuel if they are tough(SBQ imposter ect) i purposely watch for duches that 1shot things (I callout legendarys) if they don't share that will be the last one they get ill lag there game have you ever been chased by an explosive twoshot flamer dumping ammo like its nom not only do you not get to one-shot things cus im killing them you barly get to play cus all you see is framerate 1 explosions worse then line in the sand maybe im an ass maybe people should share but ill be damned if im not getting legendarys
---
They have been working from home dude. If I'm not mistaken there team is only 8 people. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. Also did you read it will drop later in the week
---
Thank you:) I wasn't sure if people meant literally place a candle, either way I've placed them as a reminder
---
TIL
---
Nah, personally 4 was better in my opinion. That at least had a decent story, with, you know, SOME choices, maimly in the side quests tho. 
---
Like, we have to judge it on its main story, not wastelanders, as that would be like using far harbours story for fo4. The fo76 story has NO replayabality. No different endings, no choices, no afternath of your chosen faction conquering the map, nothing. There are also no memorable characters in 76, at least for me. Fo4, well, all thr companions, faction leaders, and story characters are memorable.
---
As for the graphics, yeah, they will be better, duh, the game is several years older. And anyways, no one buys a fallout game for its graphics...
---
And while yes, wastelanders was great, so was far harbour, nuka world and automatron to an extent. Hell, the workshop dlcs werent too bad if u were into workshops.
---
The loudest voices are not always the correct voices to be listening to. This post is pathetic
---
Yep - have to make the donation goal. Saved my scrip on the legendary run for it too
---
Rose is one of favorite NPCs. Her and Ra Ra.
---
Maybe it's more of a "me" problem, so I guess I'll explain my thinking. I hate missing out on events in general. Knowing that other players aren't running them, or watching them vanish on the map just rubs me the wrong way. I always try to run as many as I'm able, but it does ultimately mean I gotta decide which ones are worth my time.
---
So, while ACP is permanent, it's entirely possible the event dies out after a week. At least on Xbox, Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble, and Encrypted are pretty dead outside of the few of us using them to grind them for kill XP. Heck, even Line in the Sand struggles to get people participating this past week or so. If the Colossus is more of a bullet sponge than the Scorchbeast Queen, AND there's less players per fight, what are the chances people consistently run it past that initial wave of "let's run it because the event is new"?
---
Knowing that's a possibility (something we've seen evidence of in previous events that require more thought than just 'shoot everything'), I'd rather not even have the opportunity to run ACP while Meat Week is active, because I don't want to be in a situation where someone launches a nuke when the hour changes over, and need to decide which event may or may not get people participating. I want to take every opportunity at the major events while they're around (especially the likes of Scorched Earth; any chance at an Ultracite plan drop is worth taking, considering the abysmal drop rates for some of them), but I don't want to miss out on a chance at the limited content. 
---
I'm probably being a tad bit cynical, I'll admit. I've just seen events abandoned before, and if this first week is going to be when everyone tries running ACP as much as possible, I'll personally find the decision difficult to make, if that "one or the other" situation does come up (and, yes, admittedly, it may not come up at all).
---
You f*cked with squirrels morty! Never f*ck with squirrels!
---
Gold is to make it so you don't burn out on content; arbitrary system of keeping you coming back for more. It's not for your benefit, it's for the company's.
---
Some pretty fucking awesome ideas here man. Nice to read a post that isn‚Äôt bitching and complaining for once
---
It's literally changed the game for me. I was running around with a BSS switchblade and BE 10mm SMG last week. 
---
Now everything's my prey.
---
Yea... you just provided a prime example of why the community reps likely ignore most of the times they get tagged in a thread, because so many of them end up being people trying to get their attention in the most in their face way possible over such pressing and urgent issues as... the wrapped cap.
---
&gt;Bethesda is becoming more and more like government
---
You have this entirely backwards.
---
Government has become like corporations.
---
Because money doesn't belong in government.
---
I agree and they should have a system like warframe to where once you complete your weeklies or dailies old ones you missed cycle through. So if you want to grind out what you missed because you have a job or family you can.
---
Why this get deleted now I'm sad, some guy praised you in the comments
---
Gatling gun benefits from rifle perk? Or am i reading the perk card wrong?
---
Same could be said for Stalker weapons as well. Stalker melee doesn't make much sense at all.
---
Would be great if they actually increased the range of melee VATS like that of F4's Blitz maxed out. Then they'd actually do something unique and useful.
---
For ranged more vats lockon distance and less falloff would be great too.
---
ü§î I can see that lol
---
That is a theme that runs throughout this game since it‚Äôs beginning. I never get excited about anything that is ‚Äúcoming‚Äù until it is actually released live into the game. This way I‚Äôm not disappointed.
---
Thank you and that's really thoughtful of you:) I haven't bought/obtained most of the plans, I've probably missed a lot of good things that I can add for this memorial. If I remember I'll take you up on that offer when I'm back home, I greatly appreciate it:)
---
Your reward is forfeit!
---
They are fine the way they are.
---
I would love to fish in 76, even if some of the catches were just unimportant junk. I've been on a break for a few weeks now out of sheer boredom because I've basically done everything and there's nothing interesting going on. But I'd love the opportunity to build a camp with a deck or balcony overreaching a lake and just chill in game, watching the weather and fishing for however long I felt like it. I can only do the same events and grinds so many times, but the world itself still looks beautiful to hang out in.
---
I‚Äôm not op...
---
Fucking insane. No accountability with this game and it's letdown after letdown. They're just gunna keep digging themselves deeper into their own garbage.
---
The waterwheel, which cost atoms/money to get, did not provide power when it was added, then stopped working a month in, and then was fixed like two months later.  I don't think it was ever acknowledged by devs.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but can‚Äôt find the ‚Äútest server‚Äù on the PlayStation store
---
Lol, you think doors and walls can stop people from getting in without becoming wanted....
---
I went the other way. From rifle to commando. Rifle is great against single targets but inside buildings and for multiple targets that swarm like ghouls an auto rifle is so much better. And the large creatures as well. 
---
I don‚Äôt really use VATs at all and easily one shot most things hitting them in the head. And well if not 2-3 rounds from an auto handmade takes no time anyway
---
You do not need as much scrap as you think you do.  Keep all of the junk that you use for repairing your armor/weapons and whatever you need to craft ammo.  For the rest, bulk and sell ALL of it except for about 150 pieces of each junk type.   That was always what I did before I got FO1st and I never had issues with being near the 800 lbs limit.
---
It‚Äôs a hotfix for certain quest issues. It‚Äôll also activate a colossal problem and add deep pocketed mods for SS armor. Patch 22 isn‚Äôt until September.
---
If you nuke whitesprings on a server that's set to spawn the robots there's a bug where it will spawn glowing ones that are still tagged as robots, makes for a fun surprise when you run up to loot a legendary and it self destructs in your face.
---
I haven't had one near my camp in a long time luckily. Most of my unwanted visitors are level 3 ghouls and mongrels so I guess I'll have to move when one wasteland comes out
---
Where'd you hear that?
---
That's terrible if it's true.

Edit: The latest Inside the Vault doesn't say PC only.

The only time I really go after legendaries at events is during Scorched Earth where, to me, it is about survival, especially if it is a mirelurk king... he is going down. Otherwise, I let the leggos go... I have all the legendaries I want.  Tried the 10mm or pipe pistol route, but by the time I equip them, the one shotters already have it, so I don't even bother with the trouble.
---
Nah he was complaining how ppl were one shooting the ghouls so I gave him the reason. 
---
Even then I have a fixer build that can one shot them easily. OP just said he don‚Äôt have any commando perks on a different post. Little wonder why his dmg sucked.
---
Weapon choices maybe? You can‚Äôt really one shot everything with guns, just melt them really fast.
---
Your entire proposition is flawed because if my leaving was of no interest to you, you would not be replying.          
---
          
---
I have no trouble reading your statements. I just don‚Äôt understand your main point?
---
Legendary Alcohol!
---
No I never said I can one shot them That's the whole problem
---
Sadness in 450 dmg from gat gun.
---
I got a level 50 robot chest piece, 3\* Unyielding + ammo weight reduction (I forget what the other effect was). But I didn't get it from the purveyor, - it was an event drop.
---
I was gonna scrip it, since nobody wants chest pieces like this anymore, because everyone goes for SS ones with a jetpack. But I decided to put it in my vendor anyway, and to my surprise it sold instantly.
---
So I guess there's still some demand for these things.
---
You don't feel that is a problem?
---
I actually do use commando That's the problem! although I have not yet maxed out the number of commando cards I use I use three out of nine
---
My damage was 520~ until I primed it to 650.
---
So your not far off
---
Restored desk fan for sure, and if you're lucky enough to have one, display a prototype hazmat suit on an ally
---
I agree with your explanation but I am a bit confused by the title.
---
https://youtu.be/7QcpqDGZIck
---
Apologies, I thought I inserted the link. 
---
Supposedly they have to monitor the gameplays before deciding if the release is ready for all, but I feel as if, why separate so that PC benefits from whatever the content has, so that console players only get to log on just to do legendary run dailies.
---
I didnt prime....i just hate having to make ammo...
---
I use a bloodied handmade but apparently I need to up my number of commando cards from three to nine?
---
May Bethesda go down in flames.
---
I just saw the Digi Does Gaming video as well, damn that sucks...
---
Ever hear of fast travel?
---
Currently no cause that isn't the norm of the game. If there were no caps, people would burn through it all and instead of doing the dailies, they'd wait for the end of the season and just buy it all; rinse and repeat. If it was the norm, people would just bitch there isn't anything to do and then rinse and repeat.
---
No.
---
&gt;And you have the ability to literally roleplay in 76
---
Y-yeah... u can roleplay in any game... the institue really is the bad option, its just more subtle than the others. In 76 u just chose bad guy raiders, good guy farmers... in 4 all factions justify their actions, with none except the minuitemen being purely perfect.
---
Yeah, fallout 4 isnt like 3, where ur a goody 2 shoes that saves everyone just because, or satans son who kills everyone he sees. The institute is know for kidnapping, ensalvement, murder, experimentation etc. And tge fo4 BOS are basically nazis, not accepting any none pure humans, like ghouls, synths etc, usually shooting on sight
---
I cant remember how I did it before 1rst existed, kinda like I dont know how I got anywhere without a cell phone and GPS before they existed. But I made it work, somehow.
---
I gave it to a friend (for free, of course), I found it the very first time I went to the Asylum. Now he rocks it all the freaking time.
---
Well same here, I've been running a bloodied type build I created for the unstoppable monster but ever since I got this junkies shotgun I haven't touched it lol. I finally have a shotgun I like
---
There's a teapot with a silly name like that somewhere too.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/JlB8FnU](https://imgur.com/gallery/JlB8FnU) xbox because that's all I have.
---
Well Gatling guns are insane on how low it‚Äôs ammo consumption is. Plus the ACP minions drop ammo so it‚Äôs not much of a problem soon.
---
Well work on that and it will get better. Obviously your build is not optimized yet. Just saying stick with commando over a rifle build for those reasons.
---
Dried meat... Roast meat...charred meat... skewered meat... squishy meat... crispy meat... fishy meat, stinky meat, rotten meat, icky meat, browned meat, seasoned meat, salty meat, slimey meat, sticky meat, sugary meat, meaty meat, chewy meat, gamey meat, fatty meat, frozen meat, burnt meat, spicy meat, chopped meat, stringy meat... red meat... wormy meat... mashed meat... peppered meat ...
---
Apparently I'm a moron and should be using all nine commando cards along with concentrated fire. I appreciate everyone for weighing in.
---
At least use the official source and not some random Youtuber using a 13 minute video to explain 20 seconds of information.
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424236/pc-only-upcoming-maintenance-august-18-2020?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424236/pc-only-upcoming-maintenance-august-18-2020?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en)
---
That sucks though.
---
Yeah they made one hell of a good fishing simulator, but that's about it.
---
Can you imagine the people bitching and yelling if the release date was pushed to 2021.. Sure it‚Äôs easy to say that now, but I‚Äôd imagine a ton of people, including yourself would have been yelling at the top of your lungs to release the game.
---
That Xbox which do cross platform with windows , it not the same on ps4 
---
But that fair enough you got your point across , on Sony PlayStation is different because it a $20K fee for patch upload aka ‚Äúconsole tax‚Äù
---
I do enjoy using vats in the Gun Fu perk but you are totally right about getting mobbed in a corner and wanting auto. I wonder if I should use concentrated fire too.
---
Is the prototype hazmat suit rare or something?
---
Ok? Its there on Xbox..
---
I'd like to buy some some time if ur selling them for 1 c apiece
---
Because it's become a hilarious running gag in my feed; I'll be scrolling through my various subs, then, like clockwork, I'll see "New Fallout 76 Update Somehow Makes The Game Even Worse, Part XXXIV".   
---
The comments almost always rule. I love the genuine surprise and empty little threats you guys make to stop playing. It's like Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes at this point, if the rakes were made of nylon and also gave out Sideshow Bob's SSN and home address to the Russian mob.
---
Your question stated where did I hear that from. Which had the forum less than 2 mins into it. Not, hey is there an official source you can prove?That YouTuber is my friend so that‚Äôs how I heard. Thanks for being confusing though.
---
3 star legendary shovel
---
So put the pts on xbox only. It's still a stress test for consoles.
---
Hell yeah! That would be awesome!
---
Am on board. I'd like to see Bethesda employee who has a personal account that is up on the grind.  Doubt it exists.
---
Have you put the old mods back on to see if it makes a difference?
---
I run rank 3 commando, rank 3 expert commando, rank 3 master commando, rank 3 nerd rage, rank 1 tenderizer, rank 3 bloody mess. Make sure your handmade is automatic. Should guarantee high damage. Also do sneak and covert operative.
---
My only complaint about the ghouls are their bogus broken range of attack when a melee attack can hit you from 10+ feet away while your own melee weapons miss at that range. They still have human sized bodies, your range should be the same as theirs but it is not; constantly having to deal with them slapping me around in a melee fight.
---
What a freaking awesome idea! If I could upvote you a thousand times, I would...
---
Whoopsies is actually easy once you know how. I managed to get it anyway. Unequip any perks or armor that give you disease protection and take a radaway to increase your chances of acquiring a disease. Go to Ohio River Adventures. Along the river there are mirelurk nests. Shoot the eggs to get them to hatch. If it doesnt hatch a diseased hatchling kill it and try another until it does. Once you get a diseased one to emerge just stand there and let it bite you. They do fuck all damage and you might have to wait a while before it finally gives you cooties but it should trigger the whoopsies. Its how I got it after I read a tip on here
---
Google some bloodied commando builds and work out what suits you. I like sneak and don‚Äôt use vats much so in worked my build towards that. If you use vats and no sneaking then it‚Äôs just a few different perks. 
---
Mutations are a must as well it max things out.
---
Your ***failure*** to leave after saying you‚Äôd left is what‚Äôs of interest to me.
---
The particular act isn‚Äôt of interest. It‚Äôs the failure to follow through that is.
---
You could have said you were going to donate 100 low-level legendaries to new players, or dropping dozens of taxidermy plans, and that wouldn‚Äôt interest me.  But go back on your promise?  That‚Äôs what piques my interest. 
---
It‚Äôs the lie that is of interest. Not the action itself that you failed to perform.
---
So, no, I don‚Äôt care if you stay or go. I‚Äôm simply amused and intrigued by your inability to keep to your word.
---
You can't honestly expect everyone to share every legendary at that event... they set themselves up to do max damage for the queen after all so they either choose between not doing anything about the ads or killing them. If I see a legendary and have to choose between killing it for xp and loot or trying to wait for everyone up get a hit before I do anything well I'm killing it sorry. I'm also the guy that makes sure the event never fails so...
---
sweet :)
---
Ya, SS on that might convince me to retire my vampire switchblade ....
---
I have a wide assortment of shovels at my disposal.
---
That's fair, I did ask that.
---
That's my bad.
---
bless you...
---
I literally ran into the overgrown sundew Grove today and saw yet another one in there.  I said oh Lord, not again.   Also, the rewards do not equal the bullet investment.
---
I'd rather have more people bitching than the player-base slowly dwindling as Bethesda piles more and more monetization and time-gates into every nook and cranny. Have you checked out the PTS forum? Reception for the new perk coins system (which they just barely changed after 3 iterations of testing) has been 99% negative. It'll go live close to as is and we may be having this same discussion in a few months, just with less audience imo.
---
I just want either shared inventory or increase inventory per character. Maybe the Bethesda gods will bless us this christmas
---
Hey just curious, is unstoppable monster a reward for something or just a commonly used nickname?
---
Btw I feel like we share the same feel for the magic shotgun. Like I joined FO76 too late to experience the joy of TSE shotguns, so I pretty much wrote them off. But now I cant get over my favorite shotgun lol.
---
This was one of the first thoughts I had after I saw the different public teams types ... that way people who want to PVP can more easily find a fight ...
---
My bad haha. Never good at making titles.
---
Yeah either that or imposter syndrome like I mentioned earlier.       
---
Hope for your sake not the latter.
---
I look forward to seeing you
---
I suppose it could be a drowning effect but I suspect it may be the hidden fall damage glitch. The cow is only in a few feet of water, just above knee high on the animal but it always happens in the same specific spot in the pond. I'm starting to think the terrain under the water (since the cow is actually just walking and not really swimming) may be registering a fall but since the ground is mostly flat (not to mention the water) the cow has nowhere to go and is simply slowly, repeatedly falling until it dies.
---
Fingers crossed
---
Just delete the event already. I‚Äôve already lost all hype for it
---
Yeah I had pretty much the same reaction as you when I first saw one. The wasteland has not been kind to them
---
The unstoppable monster was a reward for survival mode, the mode that no longer exists. It was a weekly challenge for that mode I believe. It was way earlier in the game. It's really op for a melee build. It pretty much tears right through enemies
---
Remember in FO3 how you could ‚Äúhelp‚Äù Cerberus by disabling his combat inhibitor, allowing him to kill the ghouls at Underworld?
---
For those not aware, Cerberus was forced to serve as the security of Underworld and programmed to repeat pro-ghoul propaganda, which he complained about with you and tells you he wished he could just kill the ghouls instead.
---
You'll be surprised to hear Bethesda isn't the only company that does this. Perk coins is a nightmare but I'm not talking about that, I've just been saying daily challeneges aren't a grind and are easy as hell if you just look up what to do. It's veen 2 years and once mods hits, I wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda drops the ball and focuses on their new IP and the next ES.
---
For me it ‚ÄúVisually disappeared‚Äú In my stash menu my Pink bats BE minigun and Black Matte Anti armor Handmade were both missing. But i reset my game and that seemed to fix it  
---
edit In not Im
---
I use a low-level grenade launcher for Line In The Sand just so I can tag all the scorched with one 'nade and then sit through the reload and re-aim at the spot where the scorched drop.  It leaves plenty of health for others to tag as many as they can too.
---
And agreed we do think alike lol
---
At that event if throw. Frag at the spawns to try to tag it. But I do understand your frustrations
---
Fighting fire with üî•.
---
Actually, no. Can you explain it to me?
---
I guess that could work
---
Tried that already, they just told me it was going to be fixed "in a future patch"
---
My unyielding SS armor says "no, no I don't think I will"
---
Fallout 76 has SO MANY quality of life improvements over past entries.
---
So many improvements and superior designs.
---
And yet... It just feels devoid of that Fallout flavor.
---
It's the equivalent of having a brand-name toy and a Superior Knock-Off.
---
Yeah, it can do Karate Chops and comes with a Gun, but "Mookey Mouse" just doesn't feel right.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs fair. PoE also gets much more dev support.
---
Funniest response ever!!! ü§£
---
Since that event always seems to drop grenade rounds too, always good to use them.
---
Sorry man, I was online for a few hours but was in bed by the time you replied. Did you manage to get the plans or do you still need them?
---
That's really cool lol. Like I've heard of a lot of "legacies" but I really like that its survival mode specific. 
---
I always thought it was a bit odd that Beth got rid of survival.
---
I just want to know how they are gonna address the lost duplicate perk cards. I only even knew that was a thing after I was already lvl 300+. That's alot of lost perk coins
---
I have, but the issue still persists. I‚Äôm 90% certain it didn‚Äôt do this before though, I definitely would have noticed it before today since it hinders how quickly I can react to my right.
---
EDIT: I was about to say it didn‚Äôt do it for my automatic fixer but now it‚Äôs doing it too and I didn‚Äôt touch the mods on it, hm...
---
wondering if you ever got a response to this bug? i ran into it as well.
---
Huh, delayed till the end of the week on console. It's surprising it's gone through so many delays when there hasn't been any talk of issues from the PTS but hey it's a good sign the PTS is doing it's job and they are being thorough. As always it's better to delay and get it right.
---
What's TDM? Team death match?
---
Does changing to 1st person view make a difference? Its really hard to tell from your video whats going on, It looks kind of like framerate, but surely youd notice if it was from that as it wouldn't always happen.
---
I‚Äôm perfectly confident and comfortable in my success and achievements in my life.
---
The closest thing to an ‚Äòimposter‚Äô here is you. Because you‚Äôre supposed to be a ‚Äòover there‚Äô person but you‚Äôre a ‚Äòstill here‚Äô person. 
---
Which is it?  Are you leaving the sub or staying on the sub?  This is a very simple decision.
---
A level 791 here... I get kicked off teams all the time.  It is their loss... if it happens a lot, I just move to private server and make all those caps!
---
Yeah it is odd and totally unfair. I loved that mode. It made it more immersive knowing that anyone could be anywhere and you gotta watch you're back. Gave it the feel of a real survival game
---
Also if you are playing on console then you are pretty much fucked when things decide to crap out. Game constantly lags on menus while crafting on xbox one, it makes crafting lacks stacks of food very tedious.
---
Did you seriously give a shout out to the Iron Monger in this post?? lol Fucking... I don't even know what to say to that. Well done?
---
I feel they did a better job in keeping the Fallout feel than ESO did with elderscrolls. ESO is a copy and paste of other popular MMOs, its almost unplayable in first person as the games hordes are designed like a typical MMO coming from every direction with brainless AI. The MMO community loves ESO, but ESO is also why tons of people still play Skyrim. I kinda understand why they chose to stick with the Creation Engine, ESO gained a huge following but also lost a ton of old fans of the series due to its copy and paste camera view and game mechanics. I cant even get into it I tried, it reminds me of my friends who gave their lives and souls to WoW. FO76 is unlike any MMO currently out, it just needs more balancing, more love to all communities, double sided walls for the builders, a proper trading system for the hustlers so they dont get scammed, remove the legacies and hacked weapons for the PVPers. Its simple things, but yet they push out new content, these fixes would be new content there such a big issue.
---
Uh, I usually run around with 99/370. I didn't know I was being so efficient until now.
---
Yes a little too colorful in some parts. And too many parts left deserted, my head canon is there‚Äôs still too few people to start repopulate the areas. Less people = less drama = less blood stain on the wall
---
How did you reset? Thanks!
---
class freak is literally must have on every build. mutations are free stats. tf else you need in luck, free weapon repairs? get real lmao
---
Actually I expect a non-mutant lengendary which give you 60%-80% damage boost
---
Edit:something like "healthy" lengendary effect.
---
For example,  If you have no mutations . It gives you around 30% damage . If you are well fed or hydrated give you around 10%. 30% damage scale with your HP (The more hp the more it gives). All above add up to 80% maybe 100%
---
So it gives you two choice run this effect without mutation give you 70%-100% damage boost. 
---
Or with mutation which gives you 30%-50% damage (a little bit inferior compare to junkie)
---
Free automatic reloads are amazing for vats usage actually, and the crit damage boosts.
---
Already have it ;) I‚Äôm a food build üòÖ
---
Also some 'skins' were entirely new backpacks you had to craft until they combined them recently to all being 'skins' for the actual backpack.
---
Hey np, I've got work in the morning so I'm headed off to bed for the night, but feel free to PM me and we can cook up a time and day.
---
Eso isn‚Äôt a copy and paste of other mmos... 
---
Everything ESO stand for today, it original in the mmorpg scene.
---
Same. If we don‚Äôt get a chance to somehow restart them or at least get some cool Mysteries deco or SOMETHING, I‚Äôm gonna go nuclear lol
---
The first time I watched the guy do it right before I respawned. Maybe it "despawned" the second time.
---
But either way, the same statement still applies, junk shouldn't be able to be stolen by other players on death.
---
We are the few the proud we are PC                               Tod speed and good luck alpha testers
---
I play around 9-12pm during weekdays. Ign same as username.
---
I do value for chems, weight and spoil for food.  Aid is my biggest issue, misc I have well managed.  I need to stop hoarding all the things...
---
That's why I feel like I missed out! Now that I've spent a lot of time getting better at the game and refining my build it just seems fun. Lol.
---
Question though, if you were killed in suvival did you still just drop junk? Or was it actual loot, cause that would be truly frightening.
---
With Fallout 4 co-op? Idk... I feel like that would have made everyone happy.
---
I am just saying that ppl like you cry on reddit that exploiters ruined their game, and then you post video where you obviously exploit yourself. Please, tell me more how you did Raiders the legit way to ALLY while your settlers are just friendly... You are level 100 :'D
---
there are youtube videos specifically showing people neat rare items that they can collect for their display cases. I cannot remember the youtuber's name though.
---
I like what you have to say and I'll just say one thing. I wish more game series could experiment with expanding its world. 
---
We all play games which have their own standards, but imagine if more games changed drastically. For example; a first person assassins creed, an mmo halo game (akin to foxhole), or perhaps a freeroam CoD campaign.
---
Not sure what platform your on but im xbox so i just Quit to home screen.
---
It's not just that.
---
Fallout 76 has a GREAT map, especially for Fallout games. I'd argue it has the most interesting map out of any Fallout game.
---
But it lacks the humor. The silliness. The goofy dialogue options. The little quirks that make you do a double take. The kind of thing where you can shoot a walking Skeleton in a Space Suit with a Dog Brain-powered Minigun.
---
how?
---
But something rare IS something special that few have? I‚Äôm not sure I understand... but appreciate the legacy gear comment. 
---
I guess what I want are some really big rare things to drive the end game momentum.  Easier-to-earn perk cards in an already easy game about how hard(?) it is to survive in the wasteland.... come on. Let‚Äôs make these things actually legendary. Worthy of legend, aka, something you were lucky to see once.
---
But we can keep giving you them instead ü§ù
---
Umm okay...
---
No I tried this on a public team with a friend it did not work.  for us it didn't anyway
---
Upgrading the weapon to its strongest part, being hardened for rifles, or powerful automatic for automatics, plus other armor peircing mags, and use rank 3 of all 3 perks! That should be enough to peirce the pvp damage cap!
---
Same here
---
I don't play bloodied but try killing different enemies when crouched and also in VATS. I've noticed HUGE differences in damage by changing things like that up (I don't use the sneak perk). My railway rifle deals about 75 damage when I'm hip-firing, about 100 when I use scope, but if I'm crouched those numbers double. VATS varies depending on distance (I believe too close is just as bad as too far and a 95% probability of hitting means nothing if it's doing minimal damage).
---
For my shotgun, it's VATS perked so I use it in mostly with VATS. It does about 500-600 damage per shot at close range. The only exception is against a larger enemy. Shooting them point-blank without VATS does stupid damage. I'm not even sure how much because of scattershot (too many damage numbers to make them all out) but it's 1000+ given how quickly I can dispatch with them.
---
No, that's part of Patch 22, if not later.
---
Tomorrow is just hotfixes and turning on Colossal Problem and it's associated side quest.
---
Nah it does it in both first or third person, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a frame rate drop though, everything else moves fine in the background when it happens.
---
If I had to describe it... It‚Äôs like trying to move your aim reticle to the right but auto aim is pulling it to the left, but 76 doesn‚Äôt have auto aim... that‚Äôs the weird part. 
---
I will say this though it doesn‚Äôt happen every time, but it does happen pretty often. It‚Äôs very annoying.
---
So what is the difference between these dailies and the perk coin system if you don't mind a little curiosity? Your logic applies to it the same way and yet it is a nightmare and this is not? All you need to do is level up five times a day and I am sure there are guides on youtube for maximizing daily XP to do so efficiently, and then you just need to scrap a perk card pack worth of cards to get 8 coins a day.
---
Tbh I‚Äôve never really be a fallout fan before. I played and beat 3 and NV and enjoyed them but I‚Äôll proudly admit 76 is my favorite. It‚Äôs because I like this game that I give it so much shit though.
---
Is it a mistake that I'm able to buy deep pocketed mods for my secret service armor? I bought it and use it so I'm just a lucky one?
---
That's my build and my baby.  If I see people one shoting I'll clear everything myself but normally I just grab a gun from a meat pile and just tap
---
Colosal problem is a permanent event.... I don‚Äôt know what you want extended...
---
You mean you dont want to buy the matte black weapon skins? Liar!
---
I really don‚Äôt think so, because there‚Äôs this thing called armor and defensive perks..? I don‚Äôt always hit damage cap with an optimized junkie build so idk what you‚Äôre talking about. Against a NAKED guy, sure. But someone with average DR/ER? No way lol
---
We don‚Äôt care , most likely they kicking you to make room for a friend who just log on
---
Dude just get first. It‚Äôs like what 12 bucks I think? You won‚Äôt miss it as much you think.
---
Yeah not really if your build is O.P you still melt everything fast.
---
sure, free reloads are cool. But you know what else is cool? Doubling almost all of your special stats
---
You've given me an idea to dress as a squirrel
---
Average dr/er yes, but probably not against players wearing a full set of bolstering secret service!
---
You need armor peircing perks too!
---
Already done with unyielding, you don't really need all your special, but mutations do take more than addictions do!
---
/s?
---
It's only in game for torso atm
---
Thank you for this, I will try crouching. I used to hate VATS but lately I'm really liking it. Especially with the gun fu perk.
---
My weapons and armor are not the best, but with the right perks I can deal enough DPS to not have a problem with anything meant to be soloed.
---
Paragraphs
---
Hey yeah! Someone was nice enough to just give them to me. Thanks for following up!
---
That would actually be cool. I know that PVP has to be initiated by the whole team now, but they'd need to lock changing a team goal like Casual to PVP if the PVP teams are instantly attack able
---
I have stopped going to vendor camp there because of this. There are a few other locations that gave done it too me, but Seneca is almost a guarantee glitch when spawning in.
---
Born Survivor is "good" one to share as well.
---
Every type of ore
---
Pre first I‚Äôd end each session at Whitesprings, bulking and selling excess junk. 
---
I‚Äôd sell any chems I didn‚Äôt have hotkeyed, the ones I did have I‚Äôd sell down to 10.
---
I‚Äôd dump any excess ammo, I‚Äôd trade in legendaries based on weight and stars.
---
Nope
---
Oh yea totally agree on what FO76 needs on improvement.
---
So your saying the flatwoods monater holotape didn‚Äôt have this feel?
---
There‚Äôs lots of little whimsy moments if you actually think about it.
---
Wastelanders however is a more serious take.
---
pRIoriTy mESsaGe foR aLL reSponDerS
---
Even with a B2525 fixer and a full unyielding stealth commando build i do the come here emote where the legendary enemys are and only bash them. I do the angry emote when people kill it before everyone is there and pray that their sleeves roll down when they wash their dishes.
---
Yes?
---
You are talking about permanent additions to an end game character that provide game boosts of varying degrees that can change fundamental mechanics vs seasonal content rhat gets unlocked and can then be unlocked for anything you do want or are missing with the gold system  that are mainly visual appeal and don't provide any real permanent game changing rules. Thats the major difference; ofcourse bethesda wouldn't want a roud monkey running around killing and destorying stuff with instantly maxed out perks avross the board. You'll probably have more lower ranker cards than you would maxed cards anyways to make the tedious parts of the game less tedious. The legendary path is just a battle pass for visual stuff. If the daily grind of 30 min is too hard with the minor pay off of 1500 atom, you'd be better off just buying atom points which I think is the whole point of any battlepass anyways.
---
I'm at 9/10 Collect Grognak Magazines even though all 10 are checked off in the list.  Been that way for a long time.
---
I believe it was still just junk but I don't remember for sure. But it did have a score keeper of whos been alive the longest and how many deaths I think. I don't know for sure though
---
Make the death bag the vault tec duffel so they cant get it.
---
I just had this happen for the first time today with my bloodied melee at both Scorched Earth and at the Whitespring Golf Course. I've been playing since Beta and never encountered it before today. Just recently went bloodied with this alt.
---
Well this just gives me another excuse to play another game. I took off work for the first day it was supposed to come out and the disappoint made me pull back from the game
---
Thank you very much for the guide! Hopefully I‚Äôm going to complete that challenge when I log on later, thanx to you :) 
---
I‚Äôve don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so excited to catch some cooties before, lol.
---
This vid is about the level scaling but at the end I'm using a bloodied gauss with high health and the spawn was still easy   https://youtu.be/6jhsMGLRzUE
---
In a single player world, sure! In a multiplayer game it dilutes the richness of the world. I love visiting CAMPS and the value of the fireplace door is lessened because I see it almost everywhere now. 
---
Also segregating is a real strong word between earned and given rewards. What a mindset to have.
---
I also get meat piles from Project Paradise and the Queen from public teams.
---
I'll give it a try on Uranium Fever. You could be right.
---
I misposted this reply on someone else.  Ignore that line.  The rest applies to you OP.  You aren't 1 shotting because you're missing out on stealth buffs and/or you're not using an overpowered hacked/legacy weapon.  A couple of bullets to kill most things is normal (unless they're weak enemies with low dmg resist)
---
All the Rare mask, Board games, once the armor stands come out you can do rare outfits
---
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Just tired of it tbh
---
lol...good luck. Hopefully it is as easy for you
---
Yes lmao
---
&gt; At least on Xbox, Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble, and Encrypted are pretty dead outside of the few of us using them to grind them for kill XP. Heck, even Line in the Sand struggles to get people participating this past week or so. If the Colossus is more of a bullet sponge than the Scorchbeast Queen, AND there's less players per fight, what are the chances people consistently run it past that initial wave of "let's run it because the event is new"?
---
&gt; 
---
The different habits between players of each console is interesting. On PS4 all of these events are decently alive from my experience.  Line in the Sand always seemed to get a few people with the numbers having increased since the legendary run launched. Encrypted had a dead period last year, but has been pretty steady in getting people whenever it runs since Wastelanders. The teams function has increased participation for Radiation Rumble &amp; Project Paradise. Scorched Earth always gets plenty of people and since ACP will run like that I assume it will very much be the same.
---
Wait, that's related to the Gauss shotgun? I've been wondering why I couldn't sprint sometimes here lately.
---
You mean those tapes that just feel like a "Welcome to Nightvale" knock off? No, those don't feel like Fallout.
---
Or do you mean the tape about the guy on the roof who may/may not have been abducted? That doesn't have anything particularly Fallout about it. Just the typical "Crazy guy who is crazy but actually also right." trope.
---
If you want to see the Fallout version of that guy, look up No-Bark Noonan from New Vegas.
---
I forget which one that is
---
They make me think of baby scorch beasts that haven‚Äôt grown wings yet.
---
I hope your right and I'm just screwing something up I have missed a lot of legendaries
---
That wouldn't be surprising. Everything about this game is the cheapest possible. They reused most of Fallout 4s assets and even some of skyrim's including for their precious atomic shop, they obviously have zero QA testers since they release bugs that would be obvious to anyone who has even played the game, and their response time to new bugs is hit or miss. This game is a cash grab and they are trying to maximize profits but using the cheapest lowest effort methods possible in exchange they are trashing BGS's and fallouts name.
---
That's really cool. 
---
Maybe it'll get a revival one day.
---
Enjoy it while you can
---
I made a roadside museum once, I had one room for sports items, one for toys and games, one for medical stuff, etc.
---
How?,you dont steal, no bounty, besides bounties are taken from the thief's pocket.
---
It's an example of why a game like Fallout probably shouldn't attempt an online GaaS model. The players don't generally care what other people have, that's a carrot for the MMO crowd to chase.
---
yes they should also do this for the ohio river adventures
---
For 3* I always try to call people over so they can tag. The 1*s are usually in a group and I'm not looking first if there's a mob. I wish there was a better way but the reward for being the nice guy is dying and having someone take your junk. Don't blame players because the game isn't giving everyone at the event credit for the legendary kill.
---
I really hope so, I regret not playing it much. If it comes back ill definitely be on it
---
Mismanagement? Just look at what their previous expectations for the game were last year when they said they realized the Fallout community isn't as PvP-focused as they thought/hoped. When their obvious cashgrab attempt with a BR-Fallout game didn't work out and they had to redesign what they want to release as 'Wastelanders' as they then knew a PvP-focused Wastelanders wouldn't work out anymore. Look at how they're trying to copy every single monetization aspect of other games, be it convenience items, battlepasses or subscriptions without providing any of the other games' qualities. Some other games might have issues too but those devs usually atleast have an idea on how to handle those or ask the community for help. Meanwhile Bethesda devs/management are so full of themselves that they can't see themselves failing or even going so far to ask 'lower' modders to help them 'god devs' fix their shit....like modders have already done for the bigger portion of two decades.
---
If I saw a sign I'd kill it just for the gigs
---
What the hell. What is fallout to you then?
---
Fall out to me is an adventure where you will encounter the unexpected while still having a semi realistic story to work towards.
---
You really only need about 100 of each scrap &amp; that‚Äôs only important scrap, You don‚Äôt need that much copper or asbestos etc, You shouldn‚Äôt have any consumables in the stash except for blood packs needed to make stims, Remove all the gunpowder &amp; ore, You don‚Äôt need that much flux either, You shouldn‚Äôt have any food or water either in there, I have weapons &amp; rare clothing in my stash with these said restrictions placed on my stash &amp; I have about 350 space left for temporary storing legendarys awaiting to be scraped for scrip, Hope this helps as I don‚Äôt see the point of Fallout 1st for the scrap box, The private server yeah but the scrap box isn‚Äôt needed with good inventory management. Keep notes &amp; plans in there that you‚Äôll be selling via your vendors.
---
Perfect timing since im looking at a reinstated stay at home order from the state.
---
That‚Äôs fair. I don‚Äôt even know what kind of game Fallout is attempting to be.
---
I've been told that my character has RBF. Good! That's how I want her to look, mission accomplished.
---
I noticed this as well. There has definitely been a legendary or two I got despite never touching the enemy because I was getting ore only for the item to be there since a teammate killed the enemy. I suspect its more of a bug than a purposeful setup though since its not consistent.
---
What platform do you play on? I'm Xbox one, I have a diner setup by the redrocket mega stop
---
&gt; Remember Bethesda promised free content, you can set your own pace while playing the game
---
That's just not true. 
---
You can't set your own pace on how much bullion you can earn. 
---
You don't have a lot of flexibility to set your own pace for the legendary run if you want to get the top rank rewards or even just get all the atoms you can now that you can't earn them through daily/weekly challenges.
---
You can't set your own pace if you want to get the most out of the rewards for limited time events like Fasnacht or Meat Week.
---
You can set your own pace for the earning of caps, scrip and faction reputation but it runs at such a crawl once you hit your daily limits it's really not worth the effort.
---
Setting your own pace means giving up content. That's not a reasonable choice for some people. I do set my own pace but I accept that I'm losing out on content by doing so.
---
Yeah maybe there should be more posts about the good parts of the game so people would see the best parts more.
---
I agree in parts with most of what you said, Fallout 1st though needed to happen. Ideally the game can be weaned off the atomic store and rely on subscriptions to remain profitable. Instead of wasting all this money and time making the art department create PA skins the money could come more from having to release content that makes people keep subscribing.  
---
I do first, instead of purchasing ATOMS because that's how I would prefer to invest in any online experience because financially it encouraged better behaviour.   
---
If anything, if you want the game to be forced to improve content. Stop buying from the store and subscribe. Normally I would say don't give them money until things improve but pretty sure at this stage Bethesda would just pull the plug.   
---
Reliance on atom sales is the problem, which is hilarious because back before first and when this was originally announced everybody agreed that it was a huge issue. Here we are all this time later and is it surprising?
---
Someone taking another players loot bag when they die should mark them as wanted and let everyone around kill them. How the fuck is blatantly stealing someone elses stuff not enough to get yourself wanted? Just add a timer to it. After 5 minutes the bag is fair game but before then mob justice should be all those thieves get.
---
Bethesda doesn't care. You think they don't know all of this already and haven't already calculated how low they can keep this game's maitenance budget while still ensuring atom sales?
---
As the OP pointed out, so much of the "content" they have added to the game is built to be habit forming with all of the time gates, dailies, and fomo. All of it is designed to hook people in and maintain a captive audience to fish for atom sales.
---
Lol that sounds sweet I love RR Diners!
---
I'm on Playstation though lol.
---
Wait back up a sec... the US is currently printing money at an unprecedented rate. We are currently seeing inflation in the stock market and housing prices along with other financial assets. It's not a matter of if we should or shouldn't print money it's  a matter of managing capital properly. You can print money so long as the demand for your currency is strong and you're  not using it to try and buy resources that don't exist creating demand spikes. In our current situation we should be printing money the only issue is we are not distributing it in a way that makes since.
---
This. Unless there‚Äôs like amazing rewards in the event I‚Äôll never kill a Wendigo Colossus again.
---
This is what it was in Fallout 4. I have no idea why they haven't changed it back already.
---
Goodbye fellow raider! May the grind be with you!
---
Or it could make them wanted. Either one works
---
There's always heavily modded FO4
---
It‚Äôs 20 Canadian üòÇour dollars suck ass
---
Not quite. it's still pretty 50/50 whether you do, and you have to be very close together.
---
Had a 3* Botfly sink somewhere in a marsh and a 2* Protection blow up to God knows where.
---
Love the gamertag
---
Periods are your friend, internet tough guy.
---
Oh that's probably why I never saw it, I played before the DLC came out
---
Instigating won‚Äôt be affected by the nerf that much since all it does is double
---
The damage full hp enemies receives.
---
Use manual waypoint setting and chat/follow emotes.   Team quest waypoints seem to have been broken for a while now
---
I wasn't very clear in my post, my bad but you are right if you take the toy she starts to get upset then she calms down and says she doesn't need it really. But if you do give her the toy back she will give you her second favorite toy.
---
You don't get loot whether public or not. You have to be close together for you to even hope that works. I still rob my friend of loot quite a bit, and we *only* play as a team.
---
Appreciate it
---
I'm genuinely curious why people keep making posts like this, do you honestly think they have any desire and or motivation to improve the game?
---
That is really interesting! You'd be correct.
---
This might be obvious but the amount of people I see doing bloodied/unyielding and having full(ish) health... make sure you are just under 20% health to reap the maximum benefits.
---
Awe that sucks. I like diner setups too, hopefully I get around sharing it with the community on here so it can be seen by all players
---
I'd be cool with them raiding my stash and just choosing a random assortment of stuff from there. I have so many outfits saved, it would be fun to see what random combinations they end up with.
---
Let me know if you find a permanent fix. When I die, my character is stuck with this shit every. single. time. I can fast travel away then come back, but any progress I've gained in a cave or dungeon is lost.
---
Highlight the door in camp edit mode and you'll see an option to lock. You can choose between the 3 levels.  Each successive level costs more materials than the previous to craft.
---
Why? It will be a non working sissy or like every patch over the last two years.
---
They can‚Äôt even get te-occurring basic events like fatsnatch to work when released lol.
---
Bro stop disrespecting the ground. *spits on you*
---
When you hover over a door or respurces collector on the menu it should have a lock option
---
What about water pumps
---
I appreciate that and I do that. It can get a little hard when I'm close to death and need to use a stim.
---
True, comrade spit shall only be used on fellow comrades. Not lowly capitalist
---
Cursed gutter &gt;_&gt;
---
A rare event where you turn on a siren, spawning Deathclaws all over the map that start sweeping toward Deathclaws Island.
---
Still gonna take a damage hit. Regardless of the effect
---
Ok Scrouge McDuck, hold your horses.
---
Same method
---
&gt; Thats the major difference; ofcourse bethesda wouldn't want a roud monkey running around killing and destorying stuff with instantly maxed out perks avross the board.
---
This is not the state of the game and players already are "roid monkeys" as bloodied/junkies right now can solo 95% of the content and stealth commandos can solo the rest. Additionally, the legendary perks do not significantly enhance your damage (aside from maybe 1 or two of them and indirectly) in their current form so your argument doesn't make sense to me. [Have you looked at them?](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_perks) Part of the reason for the unhappiness is because they are really not that great and do not significantly change the game that much and in spite of that are locked behind an overly tedious self destructive coin grind. 
---
&gt; If the daily grind of 30 min is too hard with the minor pay off of 1500 atom, you'd be better off just buying atom points which I think is the whole point of any battlepass anyways.
---
It is. If you buy every rank past 10 (which is being generous because the first 10 levels isn't all that tedious), you will need 13,500 atoms which comes out to 134 dollars in addition to the base game purchase and fo1st. That is ridiculous any way you spin it and has nothing to do with the difficulty of the challenges, it has to do with poor game design. I play Fallout 76 for the Fallout aspect of it, not to waste my time grinding. 
---
I don't understand how you can encourage this grind as reasonable and discourage the perk coin grind as a nightmare when they are both systems you are tied to as part of the same experience.
---
Colossal problem is being delayed again on console,  but the worst part is they barely tell us a day or two before it's supposed to be released. How difficult is it to communicate with your player base and say "hey we are going to release the hot fix and event on PC first to make sure everything shakes out if it does we will update console if not we will role it back and do ANOTHER delay" this event is just endless waiting and empty promises of release because let's be real when is the last time the game has had an update without a major problem happening that needed to be fixed desperately next patch
---
I'm gonna try this but only because I've tried everything else..for some reason I doubt it'll help me. If it does the trick for you thats great. I'll be back.
---
The majority of us use rads to eat up the 80.1% health that way stims only heal you to 19.9%.
---
I'm really glad I'll be reaching rank 100 in the legendary run tomorrow. It will be just in time to let me devote all my efforts to the new stuff. Can't wait to get me a Chally costume!
---
Thanks
---
Thanks. Could you provide a little more detail on what "properly tuned &amp; primed means?" And what damage level can be achieved.
---
I do that too but my rads are constantly changing when like a enemy comes up and attacks me.
---
Even then a base guass shotgun without any damage buffs is still pretty powerful.
---
Not to mention how ammo efficient it is with 2mm ultracite.
---
Ok something must have changed before public team were a thing I would run two teams of 4 at white springs nuked of course " 2 with 2 people from the other team " and one team would go to left the other right and we could loot the whole thing twice but I haven't done that in about a year tho so I'ma have to try and see to thanks for the info
---
The second I‚Äôm getting steel and lead , it‚Äôs made into ammo that is stored on my person , all food and water are on my person . The second I get plastic , everything‚Äôs bulked . And the left overs are made into plasma cores , I had 300 copper and no longer have any because of plasma cores. Asbestos I only have 150 cause I use it to repair my armour. Bunch of flux because I am in the middle of crafting a bunch of ultracite ammo and converting most of my guns. 10 of each pretty much . The others are stored on other accounts. 200 antiseptic because I craft stims for me and my squad they just bring me the blood packs . 200 ultrasite scrap , for the ammo crafting endeavour. 20 bulk wood , because I also cook for my squad . I make all the xp boosting and stuff like that . And only 100 black titanium . More on other accounts .
---
*kinky*
---
Yes its a bit pricey but they don't charge tax on ps4 so it should be around $17~
---
I know you mentioned you don't want to be paying for months at a time as a solution. 
---
I think as because you are already very careful at storage management, what might be a solution is to get fo1st once.
---
Store all your scrap in the scrap stash and farm for the rest of the month for materials. 
---
You keep the stash and its scrap after you lose 1st, you will be able to withdraw, just not deposit. It's a compromise, but I'm afraid youve already done as much as you can as a non 1st player.
---
Edit: if you are on PC, likely cheaper to buy another copy (instead of 1st for 1 month) and run both simultaneously to do easy storage trades.
---
Kink unites comrade
---
Brahmin milk removes 3.5% rads. Keep some on you, replenish it when you can, eat the spoiled when you need to increase your rads. But all that said... you really want to reconsider your perks... 10-30% and more can really up your damage.
---
Madness, ill add ya bro
---
Oh, well, bawls. Thanks for the heads up?
---
Didn‚Äôt know you could get these could imagine it being quite frustrating shouldn‚Äôt be killable in the first place other then if players are battling (like camps)
---
Where you at?
---
Awesome man. Anything else you wanted to say?
---
I just noticed this myself.  We have to level thousands of times on a single character to max out our legendary perks?  Please tell me this is an oversight.
---
Random works for me, ill add ya once I'm home ü§ô
---
A first person assassins creed is deus ex, an mmo halo is destiny, and a freeroam CoD is The division 2.
---
Shy pisser finally alone.
---
I‚Äôll say ‚Äògoodbye‚Äô when you actually leave like you stated.
---
Let me know when you decide to actually do that.
---
Bethesda devs. Industry leaders! Lol jk
---
The queen is definitely too chaotic to worry about Legendaries, stuff line Uranium Fever tho
---
That‚Äôs what my original plan was , but the amount of scrap I accumulate and I don‚Äôt even know how is what made me think I‚Äôm going to need it month to month consistently. The price of it isn‚Äôt an issue , I can afford it . It‚Äôs just a piss off that I have to pay to play a completely broken game , when I‚Äôve already purchased the game itself. I‚Äôm going to get 3 or 6 months if that‚Äôs a thing . Also I‚Äôm on pc and it dose charge tax for me , so after taxes it comes to 21 something :/ again it‚Äôs just a piss off . Bethesda needs to get their shit together because I‚Äôm trying my damn hardest not to hate this game
---
Great suggestions...is there a food or chem I should always roll for damage? I do use mutations btw.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not a stupid question- I just had to google it today. Make sure you have whatever level of picklock you want equipped! If you‚Äôre on console, I think it should be LT, but the corresponding button should be on the left of the options bar.
---
Luckily you can easily skip one daily and lose no real progress towards the S.C.O.R.E.  You can get make up for the lost (gain overseer level) xp with regular xp.  I've long since maxed out the legendary run.
---
Whatever you choose don't display Nuka Cola flavors or the teddy bears / Mr. Fuzzy plushes. Everyone and their brother has those. Some neat stuff I rarely see are the disassembled mini nuke parts from Watoga Underground, Lou's detonator, Free Radical's face mask and both types of Civil War caps (since the Confederate cap can only be made with a rare, hard to get plan). 
---
I know I said no Nuka Colas, but if you manage to get all 3 types from the Wastelanders questline (Scorched, Vaccinated and My Blood's in it) those do make a cool display.
---
I never said that the grind was good, I'm just saying ot osn't as intense of a grind as people put it out to be. I really want to go back to the Atom system which allows me to turn play hours into money to buy stuff but Bethesda saw this was too effective. I was sitting on 10k before the change and still am there cause there isn't much I still want from the game as the build limit is still too low to do anything with the new material without totally redoing everything. 
---
The legendary stuff is optional content and everything else is a minor remedy that provides no clear bonus above others. This isn't a single player game, it's a multiplayer one with "free updates". It's just now Bethesda will make more money off the game with the limit of 1500 atom instead of the over 5k-6k we could get otherwise. I agree it is shitty, never said it wasn't, but Bethesda/ Zenimax just wanna make more money as the whales aren't cutting it enough.
---
It's too late now, the cogs of fate have decided...
---
I shall kill your brahmin for every downvote
---
Psychotats +25% damage, +15 DR and +3 Perception for eight minutes. 15% risk of Psycho addiction.
---
Oh hah silly me should have noticed the tag. I would imagine in PC case just quit to desktop?
---
Shame I've already lost loads of score from both dailies and weeklies auto completing...
---
Hawaii.
---
Maybe for fun? Just trying to give you something... I am newbie (level 22 but without much time to play really) so I would probably kill someone's brahmin if I don't realize I am at someone's camp.
---
Yet, I normally don't shot at things without checking but could happen
---
I made the post while playing the game and I'm not trying to be a tough guy. Just complaining and saying how I'm a dick to people. But hey, nice to meet you grammar Nazi
---
Ok nice. Should I use bobbleheads?
---
I recently switched back to junkies, so I doubt I‚Äôll be able to dent the colossal much. I‚Äôll only partake if there‚Äôs enough people so I don‚Äôt waste all my ammo. Though I was thinking I would help the bloodied folks by killing all the regular wendigos around them, so they can focus on the big guy.
---
Idk, I have so many repair kits from the SBQ I just pop one whenever something breaks
---
This comment is underrated....
---
Before you said controller is new, that is what I would have assumed... on ps4 one of my controllers does this (but to the left, and its occasional) and its very noticeable. Only with that controller. 
---
I dont use it anymore.
---
Ok brother hood of bullshit bastard. Feel the wrath of previously mentioned bloodied handmade!
---
there are supposed to be unique rewards for the event including an outfit
---
Enclave weapons should be powerful and legendary, but forbid mutants from using them.  Stealth tech should impair DR and cause hallucinations when used frequently and mutated.
---
I fell through the freaking map over by the National Radio Research Center. Also had an RNG run of 10+ 3*‚Äôs that only dropped 1*‚Äôs.
---
Might as well rename it to Delay 76 at this point
---
Also should I change my handmade to use ultracite? I'm very tempted to do so.
---
The prototype hazmat suit is a quest reward. Perhaps you mean the Emmet Mountain one?
---
Can you explain why? I missed the first one and I don't really know the rules or what to expect
---
That‚Äôs kinda worrisome... I hope my new controller didn‚Äôt break already. I didn‚Äôt slam it or drop it yet...
---
Agh why does PlayStation make such cheap controllers?
---
But my ancestor Mario jerked off in  public once. True story. He was bored on a normal day when all of the  sudden the volcano erupted. The volcano started rumbling and spewing ash, so he decides it's all over and whips it out and starts  beating it right there. So all the other villagers take a cue from him  and they start whipping it out and beating like mad. So all the  villagers are beating off, breathing in smoke and ash awaiting their certain doom, when all  of the sudden, snap! The volcano explodes. The lava lands and everyone puts their pieces or, whatever,  you know, away and start running. No one mentions the phenomenon to anyone  else.
---
You can pick up the GotY edition pretty cheap these days.
---
Turn on god mode (treats you as having infinite resources for building) and you could go nuts in a settlement and really build a decent calculator of some sort. :)
---
So many people dropped the damn thing because it missed the first few vats shots. Once you really start using it it's the goddamn Golden gun. I've been using a bloodied one, but recently received a Furious variant from a daily. I decided to take some radaways and see what a full health build would look like using it... And my god.. I'm thinking about going full health for the first time since in almost two years. The gun is worth the grind IMO.
---
Most of us wanted fallout coop not pvp. That's really the crowd they wanted to capture i feel when it came out first
---
There‚Äôs a weapon called ripper that acts like a one handed chain saw. I only seen it a couple of times and I‚Äôve played 400~ hours all together.
---
Mr handy saw could also provide you with that feeling of sawing something as well.
---
Unfortunately no.
---
No, that's the system.
---
As it stands, you need to level up around 800 times to max 6 Legendary Perks.
---
That's without respeccing anything or keeping ANY extra Perk cards.
---
This would be great with Enclave weapons made legendary.
---
Yup, don't forget about discover bog town.  Tried it on a new character and it still didn't complete.  I doubt they'll be pulling resources to fix a bug so people can get free atoms, though.
---
You can but those are so random and each class has its own +20% - +30% so finding the right one is more of a luxury.
---
Opinion 1:  Possession is 9/10ths of the law, no?  
---
Opinion 2:  These are the Wastelands.  You know how we deal with vagrants ‚Äòround these parts.
---
Opinion 3:  If you want the person to have a larger bounty, entice them to pick more locks.
---
I'm un colorado...shame we cannt figure this shot out.
---
That sucks
---
The bounty is for picking the lock. The game doesn't actually punish people for stealing loot.
---
That‚Äôs creepy
---
all companies care about anymore is how to minimize effort and maximize profits. Its disgusting and a product of unchecked capitalist greed. Hell just greed in general, but capitalism just fostered it as a fresh born babe.
---
Do damage before taking all conduits, it still registers as damage even tho she regens lost HP...you always get a legendary drop.
---
Bloody tears.
---
I once had to remove 2 floors of my camp to move a staircase one space.
---
Ultracite bullets requires flux which can be hard to come by. Some swear by it, some of us just don‚Äôt bother with it.
---
Also without recovering the ones we've already lost to opening perk packs with duplicates.  This is ridiculous.
---
Any ‚Äúhorde‚Äù event will come with a legendary, most blood eagle camps have one. Higher level super mutants too.
---
most if not all of your pros are cons to me
---
nahhhhh my guy said source
---
honestly, id just buy it for a month, transfer all the shit from your stash into the scrapbox, then see if you still need it
---
Nuked white spring resort area. Just ran into about 5 three star glowing ones
---
It does but all we can do is hope one day it will be Legendary!
---
Just to be specific I'm talking about horde "events" that pop up to kill the alpha.
---
oh buddy if you saw the performance i get on the OG xbox one you would know i get rekt daily
---
If you move camps can you still rebuild the box after cancelling?
---
shit bethesda get together your
---
Not only work in all situations but heavily outperforms as well
---
Fo4 didn't have light wood laminate. Checkmate.
---
I honestly can't wait
---
The truth of the matter is these guys at Bethesda that design the stuff are really foolish. It's obvious they don't play the game nor do they understand it.
---
Solar weapons

Level 350ish here. Everyone‚Äôs allowed on my team.
---
i **think** so, but you should check
---
Since the Wastelanders update, it no longer spawns. So yes, only the OGs have it
---
1 trial see if you like it first
---
2 bugs been fixed 
---
3 monthly and yes keep
---
4 yes not competing with many for loot
---
5 each area has a specific set levels for enemies even as a level 209 I've had level 5 pop up in my private world just a couple areas truly restrict enemy levels
---
6 your camp doesn't revert it stays where it is on both private and public
---
7 unsure about other services
---
8 you get a survival tent that's your own free portable fast travel that's really handy 
---
You can access  scrap box after membership expires but can't but anymore in
---
9 if they made 1st a better thing like more bonuses imo worth $100 but atm no
---
how is better rewards and more xp for kills a con?
---
Between lvl 5 Gunsmith &amp; lvl 3 Luck of the Draw I rarely ever repair my guns.
---
Legendary perks to me is just added benefit. It‚Äôs not needed but it‚Äôs there.
---
Tbh there are plenty of trash rolls, taking out assassin's and nocturnal wouldn't change the amount of trash you get
---
Thanks a lot :P
---
Cools, ty
---
Con - Putting 2 years into a game, dealing with absolute shit RNG to finally have a small armory of guns you can cycle with your build while you keep up ammo, getting your perks just right  so that there's a synergy with everything... just to have rebalance happen so players that didn't do all that work get to be special.
---
Most not all
---
Been using them since very early on, month or so after launch. Do yourself a favor &amp; grab Perk Loadout Manager while you're there.
---
Nice =P
---
because that's not really the case. if you're bloodied you're actually getting less xp because of how special stacks now.
---
I guess op meant enemies in the forest for example will be scaled up, which in turn means more xp. but I don't really hang around the forest, specially if I'm looking to grind for xp or legendaries. so it's moot either way.
---
yes. you just cant add to it anymore. i got a month when it first came out, and when it ended i left the box out for people who came to my camp and needed it. i have since gotten an actual consistant subscription but if i ever cancel it again i will still build scrap boxes in my camp just in case someone needs one.
---
It should have been additive from the start but the team first off really did not know what they were doing. Someone stepped in awhile later to straighten out their mess.
---
I got it to a base damage of 675. Instigating + sneak bonus puts the first shot at 2700 damage. It's so fun to use.
---
I wall mine up, no windows no doors. What I want to pick up some ammo I put a wall in storage take my ammo and put the wall back up.
---
Honestly the game has gotten stale for me in the last few weeks. It will hopefully feel like a new game. I'm excited
---
That was also the last time fallout a rpg. That alone makes them better than Beth's games.
---
Maybe try moving your camp and see if it resolves itself?
---
Bethesda, for the antique that they are.
---
You're using the new camp skin?
---
On PC it's "F" to lock when you have the item you wish to lock in focus in build edit. You can select no lock up to level 3 lock.
---
I think it's something in their coding that the consoles will not allow at this time.
---
HOTFIX WILL BE OUT 8/18 Tuesday FOR THIS BUG
---
game isnt any harder lmao.
---
1. only a little more xp. you can buy lunch boxes for bullion though.
---
2. you can still one shot everything save for bosses, just less non bloodied people will be able to lol.
---
3. no it wont, it will just be the same as high level zones are now, nothing new to explore, nothing is more challenging relative to what we have now.
---
4. lmao no, people are litterally putting ammo machines in camps, ammo is beyond worthless, and chems and other buffs mean dick now.
---
1. everyone got nerfed, people dont understand this, all the people who very much didnt need nerfs got hit. bloodied is still beyond the best, and even more emphasis will be on all the things people whined about. legacies are still OP, magic weapons still exists, hacked shit still rampant.
---
2. yea, grind is still shit.
---
Did you put the skin on your camp?
---
Makes you think about other game developers ways of doing things. Like it may take Valve freaking forever to make a game nowadays, but you can be damn sure theyll follow up on their games in a fashion that far outweighs the support anyone else in the industry gives. Like I don't know if you've heard about artifact, their card game based off of dota 2? But that was a HUGE flop when it came out. Guess what though? Instead of dropping it and moving on to the next project, they're going to go back and rebalance the whole game, changing entire base functions if need be. It is quite impressive to see that from a company of any stature these days.
---
Unlike what we see here with bethesda.
---
bethesda lazy, never properly added into any loot tables. tons of stuff just forgotten about in this game.
---
There's Primal Cuts events appearing around the map every 15 minutes. You fight waves of monsters and if you kill them all within the time limit, you get Prime Meat (which spoils over time) as a reward. 
---
Every hour on the hour, the Meat Week event starts, where you can turn in your Prime Meat at the grill in exchange for legendary scrip. You can only do a few at a time though.
---
Nuke zones on enemies.
---
It's a hard ingredient to find imo.
---
I store it until I have enough to craft then wait for a nuke to get flux.
---
I would love for my PC account and Xbox account to at least roll into one account. I don't think it's possible. Mainly due to how out of control the hacking weapons are. They would spread bit to Xbox servers and I do not think it can handle that.
---
I'm kind of excited to see how fast a Bloodied Swing Speed +1 Strength Gutter makes its way into the market sub.
---
"has become"? bruh it always has been.
---
Oh damn, I still have a level 50 one but I had another one that was level 1 that I dropped lol
---
It does drop from enemies in the nuke zone, and as most of the sbq happens out of the zone it's in short supply, a nuked whitespring is good to collect it from as the glowing ones drop it and the refresh isn't too long. I had to do this today for flora for prime ammo.
---
That happens in 76 as well. I'm fairly certain that's by design. If reticle is over X for Y seconds, do Z.
---
Well seems like they are kinda doing that. They are nurfing the bloodied and junkie effects to be as effective as the mutant effects.
---
Does that count?
---
Protect it! ‚ù§
---
thank you very much for the info!
---
Future tek skin is broken
---
Well, I just walked through a nuked Whitespring, and not a single HRF dropped
---
At first, I absolutely hate it, but after that knee-jerk reaction,  I can honestly say this is a step in the right direction.
---
All of them are lrvel 20. I use one with flaming and double mods on a 2 handed melee character and it works fine. It's not something I bring to a boss fight but it gets the job done while looking pretty cool.
---
Ah i see, thank you!
---
I think there should be bigger downsides to mutations before we buff the effect because atm there isn‚Äôt really a reasonable downside to running a build with mutations. Given you get get to a 75% reduction on the downsides if you use uny armor alongside it there Isn‚Äôt much of a downside at all.
---
Nuke whitesprings to get your high rad fluids, glowing, and hardened mass so you have all the necessary ingredients, then when SBQ  happens you just have to go pick up all of those mutated ferns
---
The bosses suck. That we can agree one.
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
The hardest part about this philosophy is that it is so difficult to coordinate this on a level that actually grabs and holds their attention. It has to be done somewhat all at the same time and that means a sizeable amount of people who don't use/have access to the social boards we are using right now.
---
Just went through a nuked Whitespring, not a single fluid or glowing mass
---
This is just a test game to figure out the multiplayer aspects that Beth is going to have in future games.  They didn't want to hurt elderscrolls or kill starfield before it leaves the gate with the failures fo76 has had.
---
What?
---
I'll be looking. I feel like it is a server thing at it's heart.  The last time it happened - today, and one other time before, the server was on the tired side - with a nuke drop that was bugged and displaying larger than usual on the map.
---
each time someone makes a post about it being delayed, they delay it by another day
---
That includes being aggroed to other mobs. It's really annoying, because you're nerfed for any kind of protection mission.
---
Sorry, I got some today
---
I search for that Update, where did you get all the notices in the patch? I will to start changing my perks if it¬¥s say so xD
---
EDIT: Well, I find some stuffs in the FO official page, the enemies will rotate some thing to make the game more strategic, but not find anything related to "overpowered perks"
---
Discover Beckley.
---
Acquire Sludge Lung.
---
Keep on going...
---
Hi, I'm a new player. Will you be making a new post updating when this gets fixed, or will it only get fixed when the next major update occurs? I'm sad I can't continue my story
---
Truth be told, the stuff they design is GENIUS.
---
They know introducing a major grind is what keeps the players invested in the game to keep playing.
---
Every major piece of content added to this game has orbited a Major and tedious grind. Wastelanders was a few hours of Quests surrounding weeks of Grinding Reputation and Bullion. Colossal Problem is an Event that surrounds grinding CAMP plans, Cursed Weapons, and rare cosmetics. Legendary Perks are no exception.
---
It's the ultimate answer to "How do we give people a reason to play without doing anything?"
---
Granted, it's the equivalent of giving a fresh coat of paint to a ship that is riddled with holes and doomed to sink.
---
I just recently went to a private server and completed this just to be sure and got no credit.  Once damage is significantly nerfed, it'll just be that much harder.
---
Thank you for posting this!! It‚Äôs going to be a better game overall with the slight nerf, the damage doesn‚Äôt drop that much either. I‚Äôm stoked for this and also the daily ops look pretty awesome, I can‚Äôt wait for the game to be a bit more challenging
---
Just play in private game.
---
Problem solved.
---
Yep. Was doing Uranium Fever earlier and a guy had a Gatling plasma and just went ham on the first two legendarys before anyone else could tag them and on the last he got there too late to tag and had the nerve to give us the thumbs down emote
---
This game also makes trying out different playstyles such an absolute chore. It takes so much freaking time to level a character all the way up to 50 when you're doing it solo, and it sucks that there's really no way to respec your character effeciently so you're kind of forced to make a new one regardless.
---
Imma try that again! Fingers crossed.
---
Xbox one
---
they‚Äôll never let you exchange bullion items with a low level character, but I honestly think once they do the level scaling update that won‚Äôt matter as much
---
What‚Äôs that? Like the one from the legendary run?
---
I still have my lv 50 one too.
---
What do you need 6 for?
---
You see it from bloodied because that's the most common build.  Legendary kills should be lootable by everyone in the area instead of the stupid tagging.  This way it doesn't matter how much the players want to grief others, they still still get loot.
---
I just moved yesterday and it didn‚Äôt work.
---
The Ripper used to be able to drop as a legendary too, but not anymore. If you're lucky you might find one in a player vendor. I found a bloody Dragon for sale once which is also no longer possible to get as a legendary, but a Ripper would be even cooler.
---
I can definitely see your line of thought.
---
Yes the orange one
---
Yup
---
I do have it but I had it unequipped yesterday
---
Ok, might want to include that in your post. Telling people what you‚Äôve already tried should help get better answers.
---
Yes 100% you'd be better off with that mentality, I use that mentality and it has saved me from alot of  dissapointment, new bethesda is just living up to my expectations (of it being delayed)
---
Ya it‚Äôs weak
---
Bloodied will still be meta, it just won't be able to do as much damage as it used to.
---
Berserker commando with full nocturnal armor and rank 3 cannibal. 
---
I heard it from a guy just today.
---
I did equip it for a brief moment but unequipped it right away. It still is showing the skin on
---
Weird
---
What with the PTS and the general idea that all bloodied players are selfish dicks, I‚Äôm starting to feel like a second class citizen.
---
It‚Äôs not the build.  It‚Äôs the person playing it.
---
There‚Äôs plenty of assholes annihilating everything with duped legacies, magic miniguns and shotguns, yet bloodied somehow becomes the scapegoat for all the antisocial behavior that occurs in game.
---
That too for sure ill do more than 2k at times dont die
---
Totally dude it‚Äôs f‚Äôed up
---
SWARMIN' VERMIN.
---
I had been holding off doing this quest since before Wastelanders. Just a few days after Public Teams launched I was playing and joined an Event  team. Next thing I get the Nuke Launch warning, and ignored it as usual. 1 minute later I get the news that I‚Äôve just completed ‚ÄúI Am Become Death‚Äù. I‚Äôm an idiot.
---
Let's not put any blame on the players. They could go take his place after getting their hits on it
---
Do you have the raider or the settler C.A.M.P skin? Maybe try equipping that instead, if not just try unskinning the future tek in the atom shop, then move your camp immediately
---
Todd speed brave ones ,
---
The problem is with the bugs.  It can lock you out of using items, reloading, etc.  It locks you from even switching weapons by using the numkeys, you have to use the wheel.
---
I think that's when people quit using it.
---
Honestly i would remove rose's quests completely theyre boring af
---
Well you know. Though they did go backwards with it in 3 as opposed to 2 but the point stands
---
The build system is all sorts of dumb, especially when it shows green but still won't place for some dumb reason. They really need to LAX things up and make more sense.
---
Explosive affix is useless on the SBQ and colossus wendigo. (exceptions to that rule is gat plasma with a splitter as it becomes a wide spread shotty but can still click magic both heavy style and like a shotty for 300+ per pellet hits)  well really any legacy, my zealots expo harpoon is a beast against her especially with the reload glitch. It has to do with how the legacies all get the pre nerf expo numbers at base.   
---
Honestly if it isn't legacy then expo is garbage for the big boss fights.   
---
Seriously she is expo proof so a expo rifle will do the same if it is VE or VBashing. Thus if no legacies abound go FFR, unless you want to get a magic gun that has one of the broken stars that pumps out DPS that is another story.
---
Can't change weapons either.  I looked forward to this weapon so much, but the random bugs that lock you out of doing anything else killed it for me.
---
Yes ig but like i really dont wanna see sofia in a fedora
---
And it‚Äôs so slow I basically only make new characters on double Xp weekends.
---
The problem is, especially with bloodied, that there isn't enough time to wait for it to be holstered or changed by the wheel to get that stimpak in.
---
I mean it wouldn‚Äôt even matter for most of the stuff as they could level lock it
---
Especially when you‚Äôre being swarmed by ghouls or manic Scorched with axes
---
I think I‚Äôm just going to focus on meet week since it‚Äôs a yearly event and then grind colossal problem after, does anyone know if it‚Äôs like fasnacht and you get a guaranteed legendary on completion?
---
I'm seeing it with the regular mobs too.
---
I look forward to it.
---
A lot of reactions are similar to how it would be mathematically impossible to finish SCORE without paying atoms even before it came out.
---
These seem to drop from animals more than anything else from what I've noticed.  I've completely given up making the flux though because of the farming and weight of the other ingredients like hardened mass.  I just do a nuke silo run and spawn the SBQ.  You get like 4-5 stable flux off of her.  I think it's a much better use of a nuke.  After tomorrow though, nuking fissure site prime might be tough.
---
88-92 out of 306 when I leave my camp, depending on ammo and cranberry relish on hand, no weight reduction cards.
---
Ah this explains why it completed for me. I just never got around to launching a nuke and one day the trophy popped for me and it said I completed it. Lol
---
Really?
---
Before Wastelanders you could find super mutants in more places
---
I kick for this reason.  If I haven't had any verbal communication with the teammate, I won't even bother telling them beforehand.  Everyone should keep in mind that they can make their own teams also.
---
that is pretty much saying
---
just spend money to stop it.
---
problem solved.
---
yes, but i‚Äôve heard from pts players that the new daily ops piercing gaze kills stealth no matter what. bloodied builds are squishy af so what about survivability
---
My sniper runs fairly light at about 78lbs I think, out of 285 for their standard loadout - mainly cuz armor is only about 5lbs. Can't have pockets in the stealth suit, but maxed packrat helps fit more scrapped loot on him. I carry a few radstag steaks or pepperoni rolls for the carryweight as well.
---
My unarmed character is a little bit heavier at around 98lbs out of 315 - they don't have the full sized backpack yet though. Sadly can't fit packrat on her so the weight stacks up a bit faster, but at least I can have deep pockets on everything but the arms.
---
It's not extra storage, stuff in your vendor takes up stash space.
---
dang I would but I usually am not on till about 3AM CST
---
This would make a ton of money.  It was a pita to get my x-01 an arm jetpack.  It's so nice.
---
Shy bladder is a curse when it comes to drug tests..
---
It‚Äôs an online game. It‚Äôs not fallout 3 or fallout 4, you knew there would be updates to the game after it released. Balancing the game to make it more fun and challenging when it is boring and easy is something necessary and you should‚Äôve seen coming. Plus, the nerf won‚Äôt devalue your weapons at all, they‚Äôll just be less effective... just like everyone else‚Äôs. You‚Äôll be perfectly fine after the nerf and still be able to kill thing with relative ease, if you were able to before the update
---
Honestly, as far as I know hrf are only used to make flux.  Just buy flux from a vendor.
---
If you think the issue is going to be addressed by Bethesda on this side of new years you are putting your faith on a lost cause.
---
So the easy fix is private games.
---
Optionally, keep being frustrated by random Brahmin deaths for another year.
---
Or just abandon brahmins altogether.
---
üòÇüëè
---
Wtf I scrapped mine awhile back.
---
They got mutations, giant sonic fast mining drills that are silent and vaporise dirt. It's a mutation due to exposure to rads. Can also use psychic powers to communicate.
---
It's just not visible on mole rats just like mutation on humans . You don't see people with Talons or Marsupial legs right?
---
What are you talking about
---
Lol
---
Everyone should get poison and flame resistance.  Even the base 25 halves the sbq's pee attack and reduces regular scorchbeasts by more.
---
Vault boy and girl mascot heads or future tec bundle üôèüèº
---
Horde events with a leader and event marker are random spawns, but almost always have specific spawn positions. Super mutants in the savage divide are usually in West Tek or Isolated Radio Array. 
---
Another tip is that Animal hordes, things that aren't humanoid, are always at the exact fast travel location for the event. You don't have to go to different zones in search of them like humanoids.
---
Yeah, it'll be pretty sweet when that's fixed... But for the amount that it actually happens, and the fact that rarely causes death makes the juice worth the squeeze.
---
The Flame Resistance is just plain bad...just get Fireproof from END and you are good to go.
---
Seems to me that Instigating won't really be affected.  The Vanguard/Vampire combo seems pretty safe too, as Vampires doesn't add any damage. Furious should still be pretty good as well for melee, depending on how the numbers work with swords/knives.  All of these should be pretty comparable to Junkies.   In reality, Bloodied will still be top dog more for the mutations/perks/armor that go along with it.
---
The best type of friend.  Provides company whenever you need, always there for you, never disagrees with you, and has a customizable head.
---
These events pop up randomly. There isn't anything specific that triggers them. Some events require you to search places to find the leader. Others are actually a horde that move around the region they are based. Its just a case of checking the map to see of there is one on.
---
There is one exception though. The wolf horde in the forest event. This is triggered by doing the event Leader of the Pack. However there is no legendary in this horde event.
---
You should be able to do enough damage pre patch 22 but after? Yeah nope lol
---
I think they have some sort of timer, but I have never figured it out. I think it's a rotation of some type and there seems to be 2 variations. A traveling horde and one you have to search locations for.
---
Not very helpful I know. Lol
---
ü§û
---
I just get in power armor and use an ultracite gatling laser when I need survivability.
---
Placing 'dirt tiles' on 'dirt'? That's just madness!
---
Legit con you missed: SBQ and the new Colossus are super tanky. Apparently Bloodied and Junkies have tough times beating them after the nerf. That won't be fun. Lots of time and ammo spent for lower tier rewards.
---
Good to check task manager to make sure it fully closes.
---
still it is just a cash grab from what you are saying
---
I just had this happen to my melee alt who recently went bloodied. First time for me, and I've been playing since BETA. Not sure if I've been lucky prior to today or if it's associated with the unyielding/bloodied build.
---
Guys, the commie bot got free again. üòÅ
---
Seriously, though, I agree.
---
Stopped by to confirm this worked after just logging back in and trying it a few times. Not sure why but the quest gets bugged on some servers and you just gotta hop.
---
I know some folks said Fuse second but for the record I did Fuse first then blood sample analyze. Failed first few times but after server hopping by logging in the next day it worked.
---
And people with explosive weapons. Someone was doing on an event yesterday just going in one shot the legendary in uranium fever. Like yes I know all the legendaries that I‚Äôm going to get are not going to necessarily be the best but you could give me an opportunity to get the legendary. I tag things once and then call people over. It ain‚Äôt hard.
---
I‚Äôm guessing the refrigerator backpack mod would be another option in a pinch?
---
For awhile I put stuff in there at absurd prices to guarantee I wouldn't scrap it, mostly bug parts for the Badges dailies, but I think that's been rectified.
---
As mentioned you're still consuming stash space.
---
I want them squirrel...... Mmmm tasty squirrel stew so much xp
---
or dirt tiles on foundations even...
---
They need to fix the melee from what I understand... But other than that I've been watching footage from the PTS... OP builds will still be OP. The mobs didn't become bullet sponges. They didn't nerf things for the sake of nerfing, or to make you have to farm more ammo for whatever dumb reason people are making up. They changed the damage multiplies to simplify them from a coding perspective. And from what I understand it seemingly fixed the rubber banding health bar issue.
---
I would rather see a buff of some builds/gear. Some weapons and builds are generally useless or broken by comparison to others, two shot, shot guns(more of a game bug issue), and mutants as examples. That said bloodied needs a nerf of some kind because it's not a glass cannon as it should be but hurting every class to do it is not the answer.
---
I‚Äôm just being realistic with the options you have.
---
You can dream about them fixing it somehow, or you can use the options available to you.
---
I‚Äôm not making money from whatever people buy in the game whether it is private server or atomic shop crap, so honestly don‚Äôt care which option you go for. I‚Äôm just telling you what options you realistically have.
---
I don't know why they pulled some of the styles that were available considering how few they offered to begin with.
---
Fetcha la vache!
---
I think I know why we cannot complete this objective: The scorched queen, like queen Elizabeth, is IMMORTAL and cannot truly die!
---
Everytime we defeat her, her body drops to the ground as if 'dead'. However, whenever another nuke is launched, she absorbs the radiation and comes back to life!
---
It'd be fun if we could nuke the island and get a giant Godzilla sized Deathclaw to spawn.
---
I would say the feelings is much more different when one-shot a super mutant vs. 2-3 shot a super mutant on there head, especially when using slow reloading weapons like hunting rifle or lever action. I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs totally bad but it‚Äôll take time to adapt the change.
---
I see you've gotten a couple downvotes, but at the end of the day, this is the cold hard truth. Bethesda delivered a completely broken game on launch, people bought it - thats fair, they couldnt know the state of it before its release, but then, Fallout 1st rolls around, the game is still an utter mess, Bethesda decides to be cheeky and ask people to subscribe to thier broken game, with features they claimed were beyond thier technical limits - and people did. From that point on, i really just have no sympathy. Why would Bethesda put in the effort to bring the game up to even a standard level of quality when they know for a fact they can leave the game a buggy mess, and people will still buy a years worth of subscription to it. I bet the folks at Beth read posts like this one occasionally, and laugh.
---
For consoles, the event got delayed AGAIN to the end of this week.
---
No jazz. Ah well. Back to the grind.
---
The mothman wallpaper set, I really love the wooden barn looking wallpaper. I hope it comes back soon!
---
Calibrated Shocks for my PA. I have 4 already
---
To me it seems they've fixed multipliers to how they were meant to be an n the first place. However, I think they might need to rework some of it and maybe adjust the hp based curves to reward the risk (especially for melee).  
---
  
---
I think they've double attacked the issue with balancing and have over adjusted currently. Too much in two directions making it a new problem.
---
Seems to be darn near impossible. Whitesprings got nuked 4 times, and not once have I seen it
---
Why would a building team be better?
---
good post, i did read it all, but am a poster of few words
---
I have a nice vampires Gatling laser that allows me to be a conduit for more than one pylon, but then I get none of the loot.
---
What platform?
---
I just aim it in the enemies direction, there is no skill
---
Best damage? Still bloodied. But due to the way AA works, it‚Äôs nearly on par with a bloodied weapon even in a full bloodied build. In my brief testing my AAE 50cal was only doing about 10% less damage than my BE 50cal.
---
But bloodied heavy weapons build is probably the most capable for the daily ops.
---
XBox
---
The problem I‚Äôm discovering isn‚Äôt so much that damage got nerfed, but what it did to certain weapon types.  Rifleman, bows, unarmed and slugger got majorly shafted.  Anything slow that relied on single shot damage took a huge hit.  
---
Weapons like hunting rifles and super sledges need their base damage adjusted to bring them back into some semblance of usefulness, but I have 0 confidence that the dev team will do the work to compensate.  I expect they‚Äôll just sweep it under the rug and pretend it‚Äôs ok that everyone at end game is either playing a commando or heavy gunner.  At least we had the odd, well built rifleman, unarmed or slugger show up and kick some ass at SBQ or Encryptid, but those will disappear completely come patch 22.
---
I'm still OP at full health and I travel light. Share what you want
---
I got a couple of legendary dragons but their legendaries are pretty bad. I keep them cuz their legacy now ;)
---
Does anyone know how long it takes to spoil with and/or without good with salt?
---
They inadvertently fixed this when they were fixing the server  changr dupe glitch. So now pending transactions happening at time of server drop will complete, preventing exploits.
---
Reddit it‚Äôs done. Bugs, server crashes be damned I finally dropped my first nuke........ on foundation. Walked up to random npc he said ‚Äúhow you doin?‚Äù
---
Building gives you bonus Intelligence, meaning more XP for all actions. Event just gives you bonus reward XP for completing an event. So if you‚Äôre doing a Whitespring lap you should join a building team, more XP for your kills.
---
If you have fallout 1st why do people have alts
---
I mean, if that‚Äôs the case, that doesn‚Äôt sound inadvertent. That sounds like exactly what they were trying to fix.
---
If it makes you feel better, the murderers probably get acid from the boat flies that spawn after it dies.... so it‚Äôs not really for ‚Äúnothing/no loot.‚Äù Your Bessie is fulfilling the circle of life. RIP(s).
---
so will the Minutemen and the Railroad tho
---
Thank you for sharing this info!
---
It's also important to note that legendary perks have to be taken into consideration when it comes to final damage output.
---
Similar to how it would be if they suddenly started releasing level 100 weapons. 
---
You start with the top threshold and work your way down.
---
Fair enough, I'll take my 3* card sharing to my own building team...with blackjack and hookers
---
It definitely wouldn't be any simpler code wise.  I think it is an intentional nerf, but I'm okay with it.
---
I seen SBQ die In 3 minutes in pts without magic weapons. 
---
But the colossus on the other hand he‚Äôs a good 10 to 20 minute fight.
---
how do you trigger these events? im nearly maxed and never had either faction ask
---
Ok, Thanks
---
They really aren't multipliers anymore, tbh.
---
What I meant by inadvertently is that they were not set out to fix the incredibly rare issue of someone losing a pending transaction during a server drop, it was a byproduct of preventing an exploit.
---
What the hell is ‚ÄúISO‚Äù
---
If things stay the way they are now‚Äîand that‚Äôs a big ‚ÄúIf‚Äù‚ÄîI think the new meta will be Vampire‚Äôs weapons with low health builds. The way the damage stacks now you‚Äôre only doing slightly less damage than with a Bloodied weapon but you‚Äôre going to stay alive much, much easier. This is all assuming that they do something about the magic and legacy weapons, if not, those will be the new meta.
---
Sometimes you can seemingly get a fair few (5-7) in a nuke zone, other times barely any if at all. Keep killing stuff, they'll drop eventually.
---
Honestly, my first go at the Daily Ops was with my junkie heavy gunner.  I absolutely steamrolled it with a minute to spare for Elder status, even with the freezing effect slowing me down.  If you have a strong build, don‚Äôt expect it to be that much of a challenge.
---
Yeah. Being in t 65 with emergency protocols doesn't feel too "squishy" to me.
---
You're right and thats why you got down voted. There's a lot wrong with corporations greed
---
Can't you just be in proximity of your teammates who kill legendaries and be able to loot them? Like if I'm playing on your team and we're next to each other and you kill a legendary I haven't tagged, aren't I still able to loot it? I swear my friend and I were doing this in Riding Shotgun.
---
That's why.
---
Where did you see this
---
Same thing happened to me, so now I‚Äôm level 75 and don‚Äôt know how to launch a nuke. I‚Äôm pretty pissed!
---
&gt;Did I waste my perk picks
---
Yes
---
&gt;Can I redo them?
---
Not really, you'll have to use perks you gain at higher levels
---
Personally, I prefer lower levels. I‚Äôm greedy and want the caps from all the quests they finish. ü§£
---
I gave up on it and  don't really think about it anymore.    I just maintain the assumption that it's not coming out.
---
 [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424236/pc-only-upcoming-maintenance-august-18-2020?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424236/pc-only-upcoming-maintenance-august-18-2020?language%5B%5D=en)  
---
Presumably they still have stability concerns. They did the same thing with Vault 94 back in the day.  
---
For what it's worth, it plays fine on the PTS, but it's also played fine for the last few iterations.
---
Don‚Äôt assume every asshole out there one tapping legendaries is a bloodied build... Even we don‚Äôt like them, They give us bloodied builds a bad name.
---
Well, now they're just added together before multiplying the base and calculating final damage output. Before they were stacked higgledy-piggledy to get an overblown output.
---
Recently I sent them a ticket on this issue, Provided some proof I killed a queen and showed the challenge uncompleted and they just sent me the atoms. Their aware of the bug but it must be such a low priority to fix as its been around a long time.
---
The only thing that bothers me about it at this point is what took this long to address a rebalance? It was called for months after release, and to a degree I see why some are salty because they got used to it.
---
Now this is probably a tired argument point but other games address balancing pretty quickly, what 2-3 patches? Not at the almost 2 year mark.
---
Then on top of it, if I understand correctly, they've made it punishing in a way to rebuild a character, impractical even given the way SPECIAL is redistributed &amp; the current integration of Legendary Perks.
---
I'm personally just waiting to see how it goes. I'm assuming delays at the very least.
---
+karma thanks bro
---
They have the vault box/girl power armor heads at the shop right now. I am not sure if you are referring to something else though.
---
The only thing that really changed was my lever gun went from fun head popper to garbage instantly.  I put an auto receiver on my fixer, swapped rifleman for commando, and started killing everything in a short burst.  I guess I‚Äôm part of the tribe now.  Rifleman was fun while it lasted.
---
I want the purple sequin dress for my female character. She would look so hot wearing it :)
---
The story was really interesting once. With no choices to make or varied outcomes it‚Äôs just go here, click the thing, go there, click the other thing. Wastelanders was much better, there just isn‚Äôt that much to it.
---
Fantastic. Bethesda sure does love killing hype by delaying something over and over again. I‚Äôm expecting fractured steel to come out next year at this point.
---
When legendary perks come out you will be able to exchange those for perk coins to level the legendary perks
---
 They think Delay after Delay after Delay will make people more eager to play it. 
---
I think it is going to be a Colossal Dud like Vault 94 and Project Paradise was? Once everyone tries it, only the true die-hard fans will play it. We will see some time this year maybe? lol
---
The perk that I find most valuable is the ability to transfer stuff from one character to another.  It's not 100% safe, but I only recently lost about 300 scrip and an Owlet meat when the server gave the 'Shutdown Imminent' notice and wouldn't let me rejoin.  Never had a problem with it before and I've done it daily for at least 6 months.  My internet even completely crashed once and I was able to reboot and get back in to get my stuff.
---
The other 'perk' is workshops if you don't want to PVP and are into building or just to knock out the daily challenge.  I'd say try it for a month first; totally worth it if you play daily/regularly.
---
At first I was very against the changes thinking about all the work I out into my build. But honestly now I think it will be over all better for the game and starting to change my build. 
---
I‚Äôve been bloodied for to long, hopefully not only do they bring these changes refine them every better( for melee players who got hit the hardest) 
---
Hopefully the game is easier to balance and they can maybe add more basic perks for other build have more to work with.
---
Wonderful that an online game that's been out for over a year can allow you to pick the same perk multiple times when it has no function. Great.
---
Hold my breath as I wish for death.  Oh please Todd help me.
---
Thank you I stand corrected
---
I keep to the tried and true Travel perk card. Not everyone has it, it‚Äôs a level 1 card and its a huge benefit (who doesn‚Äôt want cheaper travel)? I just wish it stacked with other people sharing the same perk.
---
You just find raider or settler fighting creatures or eachother at random encounter locations. You get 2x the score from helping a faction fight the other compared to fighting a group of creatures.
---
"Justice for the worker, comrade!"
---
"The only capitalist that can be trusted is a DEeaad, capitalist"
---
My favorite "WEealth, is a greedy mask that hides Capitalism."
---
There are still multipliers but the multipliers are all added together then multiply the damage. At present they stack afaik.
---
It‚Äôs the wasteland... penalties for killing or rustling livestock should be higher than say, modern day Wyoming. üòà
---
I dont do nw and never had anything auto complete.  I'd stay away from nw until after you've done your dailies
---
So I was at the scorchbeast queen event and saw a drop bag.  At the end people will sometimes drop stuff they don't want (even low level legendaries).   
---
I ran up to it and started looting just by reaction, was halfway through collecting a bunch of scrap items before I realized it must be someone's death bag...   But then I saw all the *stabilized flux*.......  I'm not proud of it, but I really needed flux so I grabbed it all and ran.   Sorry buddy.
---
I'm at level 87 on the run right now.  I sure would like this doublescore weekend to finish it up so I can take a break.....
---
If you take out fast travel from the equation(have all characters there ready to go) then the only time it fails is if you lose internet. Most causes of loss are crashes due to fast travel.
---
I just think calling them multipliers isn't as accurate anymore.
---
The team who worked on this at first were not very mmo or online savvy. Making a lot of bad decisions. Later on they actually had some people come into the studio to fix their mess. 
---
The team working on this now is not a carbon copy of the people who worked there when it first released. It‚Äôs known that developers do get moved to different projects either to give advice or help the team.
---
Nuke Morgantown, drop slightly North of Mama Dolces. The airport will have plenty and all the glowing ones in Morgantown itself. You should get 15-20 if you let everything respawn after you clean it out once.
---
The community at launch very vocally said they don't want text chat. It sucks for the mute, the deaf, and the decent human beings who don't use voice (who the fuck uses voice on pc? No one in public lobbies, that's who). 
---
Sucks. There is a mod that adds text, but you need the other person to have the mod as well, obviously.
---
You'll be able to scrap them when legendary perks are introduced, so they'll eventually benefit you. It's weird that you had the card three times though, once you take the first one it should have blocked you from getting duplicates of it.
---
I mean, associative property, so "higgledy-piggledy" doesn't really exist.
---
I'm not sure I understand the question? Its much easier to have alts...each one is a differnt person...different playstyle...differnt camp..the same as a non first player would make alts i would assume
---
Or at least dispense some 'ice water' or 'ice cream'
---
(now that he has a new refrigerator)
---
You will still have the same gear, same perks and also have access to legendary perks. 
---
No one was singled out, it's an overall adjustment and rebalance across the board. 
---
Also this is PTS for a reason but they have to set a threshold for numbers to be able to know if they have to go further up or down or where to tweak but at current numbers were too sporadic due to damage output being messed up due to server lag or glitched math. 
---
Now most of that isn't the players fault but things like magic effects, everybody had to realize that shit wasn't intentional and eventually it would be fixed because it was never intended for a person to be able to do things like solo the queen.
---
This isn't the first re-balance.
---
First was Two-Shot and Explosive effects.
---
Then shotguns.
---
Then Energy weapons were buffed.
---
They have been making small incremental re-balances for a long time. This is the first overhaul of all damage.
---
That's different.
---
I don‚Äôt want to move my camp, I have to rebuild it everytime I move it. I think maybe because of the two sided walls
---
I have not watched your other video but do you have a reason for using smaller generators instead of just 1 big fusion generator?
---
The legendary perk cards I have seen are more game play benefit, stat, and defense based. I doubt they will effect damage much.
---
Pretty cool idea. Nice.
---
Is prime meat tradable?
---
Okay, will try that when I can
---
Wastelanders wasn't exactly great, tbh.
---
 I stole your squirrels and put them in my loading screens, ty :)
---
Paid content? I thought the only thing you could buy is cosmetics.
---
Its not the walls mate, if you don't change the skin and then move your camp it'll be broken.
---
Go AA. it isn‚Äôt affected by the changes.
---
I've seen videos about travelling hordes in certain regions and the event pops up. But no idea what triggers it or how to find them.
---
Yeah I have no idea. I picked it at least twice for sure, have 3 total in my inventory.
---
It's very interesting to see the differences between platforms. As much as I prefer playing on Xbox in general (the achievements and general UI are part of that), the times I've worked with others on PlayStation to make progress towards something have been wonderful (worked on Resistance 2 multiplayer trophies before the servers were closed, and a pile of us all grinded stuff out for something like 3 or 4 straight days, 10+ hours a day; it was all I did for half of that week).
---
It's also entirely possible that Xbox Game Pass has affected the player base on each server. For every level 400+, I see a half-dozen new players wondering why they aren't dealing damage to creatures 40 levels higher than they are.
---
As for getting people to 76's events, I've gone to the likes of PP and RR, while in a full events team (in a server with only events teams), right from when it spawned in, and have had zero people arrive. I'll even make sure to use the Help and Follow emotes to try and draw my own team of similarly leveled players in (for reference, I'm now sitting at level 279).
---
I don't mind for RR or Encrypted, personally, since I've got all of the outfits and plans (I think, anyways), and both the rad barrel plan and Emmett Mountain hazmat suit, so I just go for XP at that point (If others show up, I try to run the objectives, since I have no idea what other people need and default to doing what the game asks me to do). But, as far as I can tell, I still need every single plan from PP, and if no one helps out, I just have no chance at those rewards. Haven't even seen one stray Stimpak Diffuser recipe in vendors! (I've all but given up on ever seeing the Bear Arm plans.)
---
And I've had the argument made that this should be expected, since not everyone plays the game the same way. And that's fair! But... Why join an events team, then? If you're in a Building team or Casual team or something, I obviously don't expect people to show up, but if you aren't running events while in the events team, why are you in it? (Sorry, bit of a mini rant) 
---
My hope is that ACP takes over for Scorched Earth for a while, if only to see the new story to go with it, as well as to try and snag some of the new items/plans. I don't doubt it'll get a lot of focus in the first week or two.
---
Oh I don‚Äôt know it just seemed to me to be more
---
AA seems to be the new thing.
---
Remember the mother Deathclaw in  New Vegas? It was huge, you could have a event where you have to steal eggs while not waking her or her brood up.
---
They are still by literal definition multipliers, they just are not stacking multipliers. It's not uncommon for games to do it either way or a mix of both.
---
Content as in stuff in the game in general - could have worded that better, I‚Äôm sorry. Also the scrapbox, aka the SINGLE reason I keep my fallout 1st active.
---
Follow through, which I assume will be heavily used among the sneak fixer bloodied builds, will do up to an extra 40% damage - I'd say that's pretty significant. 
---
Retribution does extra damage too though I don't see hard numbers on amount at max lvl
---
Stock bash
---
I bash mole miners with stock of my weapon and you can't imagine how many people start to do it too
---
All I want to do is kill ra-ra is that so hard?
---
Sounds like I need to dig out one of my shotguns with extra limb damage effect instead of using the explosive ones.
---
I just figured alts were another way to cheat/ dupe
---
Or the disgusting princess bed
---
Ah yes forgot about fallout first. Never crossed my mind since I didn‚Äôt really care about the scrapbox or private world.
---
That's a good question and yes. The method behind this requires that I intentionally budget power so I can control which objects it will power when I flip switches. On the left side I'm only providing 30 power but the entire circuit has the potential to consume 51. When you don't have enough power the camp has to decide which objects will receive the power that's available so you can use knowledge of this to build some extra logic into a circuit. It's also what allows me to light a specific amount of lightboxes instead of lighting all 16.
---
I just wish I could see all the math, but whatever.
---
By and large, it takes me an hour to do every challenge besides leveling up and nuclear winter, which I‚Äôve skipped entirely the whole season.  I‚Äôm at rank 95.
---
Today I only had about 30min to play, so I didn‚Äôt waste any time vending or puttering around my camp.  I managed to complete everything but level up and NW.
---
When I have more time on the weekends, I launch nukes, farm the hotspots on the map and maintain constant xp buffs from food and sleep.  I‚Äôll probably hit 10k xp at least 7-8 times an hour.  The 10k xp goes a long way towards padding missed challenges or days you can‚Äôt play.
---
Yes. And to get cobalt flux around Mama Dolces.
---
The respawn rate is pretty good.
---
How is my Unarmed build getting nerfed into oblivion anywhere near a good thing?  Because according to most reports those with that playstyle are going to get hit the hardest (incredibly weak pun intended).
---
No drama, but if this goes through i think i will drop my character into a fissure, log of for the last time and look for greener pastures.
---
They needed a lot more time with 76. In the mean time releasing more quality F4 DLCs that weren‚Äôt ones that just added workshop items would be good to tide over players. Far Harbor and Nuka-world were masterpieces and in many ways are better than 76 and vanilla F4.
---
I did this yesterday \[PS4\] with with one of my secondary characters.  I didn't experience any problems with the Mayor for a Day quest.
---
Well specifically for the lever and hunting rifle it's usually the lever that has the higher base damage, but equipping the 50 Cal receiver on the hunting rifle will make its base damage the same as a lever.
---
They probably only dropped 1 star nocturnal pool cues, so having them fall to the nethers would be less frustrating than the prize.
---
I could never figure out if it was ([Base Weapon]+[WeaponCards%])√ó[Weapon Mod]√ó[Sneak] or BW√óWC√óWC√óWC√óWM√óS or something else. Different combinations seemed to work differently, although I never got to fully test many.
---
Yeah, the scrapbox is honestly a necessity for me. It keeps things organized and I always have a use for things. I don‚Äôt use my private server EVER and the exclusive items you get are *nice* but I‚Äôd much rather have a functioning game.
---
In fact you would never die. Except from poison of course if your not watching.
---
Easter egg: if you‚Äôre wearing one of the Fashnact Deathclaw masks all the Deathclaws are friendly.
---
I totally agree.
---
Yeah the fact so many weapons are doing more or less damage than intended is a huge problem. It makes it difficult to make a build without previous knowledge of all the quirks. That's why I changed my mind on the changes to perk card calculations. Now it's way easier to plan a build. You know exactly what a card will do. They get the gun damage/rubberbanding/magic stuff sorted and the game will be all set.
---
Cursed weapons? I haven't heard about those. Will they drop during Colossal Problem?
---
You‚Äôre a lucky person üò≠
---
Oh I just was able to store stuff I couldn‚Äôt before while just with my STASH so I thought it was
---
Abandoned Bog Town is a workshop, you can't fast travel to it unless you've claimed it.
---
I kinda hope not because it‚Äôs pretty rare now. Probably the most og outfit in the game.
---
That's why I'm so excited for the legendary perks.  A bunch of poison and fire resistance
---
Huh I'm not sure. I would imagine so, since that seems to be the staple incentive for Limited Time Events now, but who knows.
---
I only know that your first completion is guaranteed to give you a new Stein CAMP item, and there's a few new things like a Chally costume and Tenderizer plan and mod plans. Maybe some other stuff as well.
---
From what I understand it's all multipliers multiplied by each other.
---
This looks like the best event yet. Yet Bethesda delayed it. For the third fucking time.
---
Ah. Well that‚Äôs extra annoying. They could have at least given the hideout a marker of its own.
---
Feel the wrath of "our" communist BE handmade
---
&gt; 200 super mutants a day
---
&gt;
---
&gt; every single day
---
&gt; for seven straight weeks
---
&gt; 'a little grinding'
---
üôÑ
---
Doing the dishes every single day isn't "grind heavy" either. It's also not fun. It's a chore, and that's how the challenges feel for a lot of people.
---
As it has been pointed out several times before, the issue isn't that the challenges take time to do (although leveling up from 0% to 100% at level 200-300 and beyond *does* take some time, at least without a massive INT from Unyielding and buffs, as does raising your Overseer level from 0% to 100% when you're getting into double, let alone triple digits, and having to log on to an alt or a throwaway character is a really dumb solution to that), but that people feel like they have to log in every day, and that is what Bethesda is going for, as has also been said many times (by yourself as well, in another comment here.)
---
A lot of people can't (or just don't want to) log in to play every day, which then leaves them feeling like they're missing out on something that they should be doing, when the system is built the way that it is. If it was possible to play more at once on the weekend, or on any other given day of the week for that matter, to get all the chores for that week done, instead of feeling forced to log in on a daily basis, it would go a long way to stop people from getting fed up and burnt out. 
---
And, if the chores weren't such chores, but were more fun, with more variety and a little bit of surprises here and there, that would help too.
---
Just leave nuclear winter running on consoles as that mode is highly enjoyable while the ‚Äòteam‚Äô has their come to Jesus moment, just add some more maps already to it...
---
Right there with yah. It shouldn't be tiring to play a game like cmon
---
I dont run a build so one bullet doesn't do much from me, i tap with with my gatling and wave people over
---
No idea if it will work for you, but if I actively track my challenges, I'm able to complete them.
---
Just like everyone else's defeats 2 years of grinding to get that way. I'm a launch player, not a Gamepass or massive sale late joiner. This is like handing out participation trophies.
---
I want that damn elder Maxon coat
---
Items in your vending machines take up space in your stash.  They do not give you any extra space.  The fridge, display cases, etc. operate the same way.  The hard limit is 800, you don't get any extra.  
---
The one exception is the Fallout 1st scrap box, which has separate unlimited storage for scrap.
---
its gotten pretty bad for me too. I'm on pc
---
Ammo and ammo consumption rate for the mg is ridiculous. But on the other hand the mg will MELT most  things. Handmade does have a higher dps, but lower rps (Rounds Per Second), meaning slower kill speed, but better ammo consumption. But man, like the real world version of the MG42, that thing can FIRE some rounds with the Greman Engineering quickness!
---
Honestly, the potential is there but all your mentions, of which there are plenty which is ridiculous by Bethesda, will forever leave a bad taste in most players. I throughly enjoy going on killstreaks in NW while also being  bushwookie other times, so I know both sides of the fence.
---
Agree so much on this but for now I'll just use my two PS4 to give something to a different character
---
I feel this is the perfect time to hit them up. Something they can forward that can be swiftly fixed as opposed to asking them to solve a huge technical issue they might not have all the info on. 
---
This is the kind of post and dev tagging that gets problems solved
---
If the PTS plan of allowing us to use gold to buy the thigs we missed out on goes through, it would alleviate that feeling of missing thigs.
---
They used to have fun dailies on things to do but bringing those in would help break up the monotony of the situation.
---
Ya I can see once you become reliant on the scrapbox you don‚Äôt want to go back to not being able to use it. 
---
I‚Äôm fine with my junk each stacked up to 100 to 150. Going beyond that just feels over kill to me.
---
You on Xbox? I can give you some. I know when I started playing again back in October I took so long to get calibrated shocks being I could never get enough to craft. I have plenty now
---
Could be. The new way makes it easier to figure out for sure though, heh. Add all the percentages, multiply that by the base damage, add base damage, done.
---
My friend plays every night for over a year and he only leaves camp when he needs more supplies for building his camp. 
---
He's constantly redesigning, relocating, redesigning. 
---
I'm the exact opposite, I make a homestead and get so attached to it I never move. I even made an alt with the explicit purpose of just using him to toy around with building in different areas... but he found such a perfect spot...
---
Is that good, you say? OK!
---
From now on, you play ONLY with pistols. Do you agree? If nerfing is good, try it. Nerf killed the pistol assembly completely. It's good to say that nerf is needed, when playing with machine guns and carbines, play with unpopular weapons!
---
explosive will hurt you too if the enemy is too close, remember.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been told sucks I have to buy a subscription to have extra space
---
Not anymore being on consoles it got delayed again. Because why not? Why not delay the fucking update for consoles for the third fucking time. Sorry I‚Äôve defended this game since beta. And this event I‚Äôve been hyped for and to continue to wait until the day before to say it‚Äôs delayed. I‚Äôm fucking heated
---
In my defense, I didnt spend 13 minutes explaining 20 seconds of news as you put it.
---
I opened with the news as well as the official source quote. 
---
The remainder of the time contains my thoughts on the news which anyone is welcome to listen to or just close the video.
---
Just wanted to be clear on that as I don't like how you tried to paint me.
---
I bash legendaries with the butt of my gun always. I hate selfish people.
---
Also some cosmetics and a new grill. You can preview the grill under cooking benches, I‚Äôm hyped for it
---
Three specific ones with fixed Effects:
---
* Executioner's FFR Weightless Harpoon Gun 
---
* Executioner's SS Weightless Shovel 
---
* Bloodied Power Attack Weightless Pickaxe
---
They have a bonus effect that increases their damage at the cost of condition.
---
bugs. Bugs never change.
---
Sneak might need a buff, I think stacked multipliers is part of the build and unstacking them will hurt the build and probably require more rounds to kill an enemy. Probably the same with melee so what they are doing for those builds might make sense.
---
I hope they are going to make some other builds and weapons more viable so we have more choice of builds to use.
---
I used to do this for my bloodied PA main. EP torso for combat, jet pack for out.
---
Then I learned about Ultracite jet packs.... I can have my cake and eat it too
---
I wasn‚Äôt at first until they mentioned that they fixed it to include PA
---
I love shotguns and I'd literally kill legendary miner with one shot
---
I just recently switched to a bloodied heavy gunner w/ emergency protocalls using T-45 PA and I haven't died since lol. I'm usually 20% health but with life giver and a few damage avoiding perks it's dope.
---
If I was still using my bloodied stealth 2h melee build, I'd be so screwed for this change.
---
Also with some of these legendary perks like auto reviving in power armor and poison resistance this might end up being my permanent set up
---
No it a just another character.
---
I‚Äôve got my secret service armor jet pack hotkeyed with other torsos to swap in and out. Stealth suit also hotkeyed for when I hit a nuke zone or am falling a little too far
---
Same here, got full unyielding and a nice set of bloodied weapons. I don‚Äôt even have melee perk cards but my death claw gauntlet one hits. My Gatling gun does high damage per shot.
---
You forgot Bethesda actually banning hackers.
---
pretty sure you can do dirt tiles on foundations... i recall seeing it on the stone foundation.
---
At least they finally fixed sneak recently so multiple sneak procs actually add together instead of neutralizing each other.
---
But I agree, if this also has a comprehensive look at builds and weapons so you can legitimately feel like you can thrive with any build style if done right. 
---
Obviously there's going to be weapon tiers and better builds but more diversity would definitely be a positive.
---
Pistols will be destroyed with patch release :(
---
Why rank 3 cannibal?
---
Even if they had a cap still but made it wayyy higher
---
I really didn‚Äôt notice any appreciable difference with my junkie heavy gunner.  You can still tear through enemies without any difficulty.  I did a couple Daily Ops and easily got Elder rank while solo.
---
The weapons that got hit badly were slow, heavy weapons.  Sniper rifles, sledgehammers, etc.  If you use something like that, I‚Äôm really sorry.  The way that damage has been mostly homogenized with the new formula, one hit stopping power has been neutered.
---
you cant. It says it must be snapped onto an upper floor or stairway. you're likely thinkibg of the foundation varient of the plot not the floor variant.
---
I don't see how lifegiver helps that much.
---
Whelp XD DX
---
Im just wondering how you did that. If you have a perk card maxed out you shouldnt be and to see or purchase it again.
---
that's a kicker of I ever heard one.  They really roped us in with the little idea
---
They were somewhat lacking, along with bows, but yeah.....completely irrelevant come patch 22.  You won‚Äôt be able to give them away.
---
That's what I'm wondering. I had the perk, I had it equipped, even had a spare, and it still let me pick it again.
---
Damn. I've got 19x in stock on PS4.
---
Ah that‚Äôs true, so maybe better for a handmade not a 10mm?
---
YUSSSSSS !
---
There is a dirt tile foundation in the foundation tab
---
I just heard it had some glitch associated with it but I kept it around just because it makes me have a few more hp for squishiness
---
How does it defeat 2 years of grinding? You‚Äôre weapons were nerfed equally as everyone else‚Äôs, meaning they‚Äôre the same value as they were before. Just because they‚Äôre less powerful now doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre worth less, if they were top tier before they‚Äôre still top tier now
---
I'm hoping they fix this soon. I just hit the exact same bug with my new character.
---
Some of us collect low level legendaries for our lowbie toons. You aren't on PC by chance, are you? I have a soft spot for FFR flamers.
---
The communal fire pit!
---
Well if it currently works the way I think it does, I think it is pretty simple now.
---
Yeah I can get over the cap if it was much much higher or the game didn‚Äôt throw so many useless legendaries at you.
---
The build system in 76 *just works.* /s
---
I like the full benefit when I feast on the flesh of my enemies.
---
Well fuck, It was supposed to come out on my birthday, how much damn maintenance do you need for this event ?
---
That was fixed.  It's just 45, or really 9 more health.  3 health for a perk point doesn't really seem worth it, imo.
---
I don't know why people make the mobile game comparison.... If it was like a mobile game in addition to the daily allotments we'd be able to buy scrip for real money. Personally I'd love them to put a week's worth of a scrip/gold in the machines and do weekly resets so we didn't have to log in every single day to turn in... But it is what it is. But then again only 30 minutes a day isn't that big of an ask.
---
Yeah SBQ I think people need to just let go of the whole sharing the legendary thing.
---
I got yelled at by someone for saving them from a one star deathskull radscorp that was about to kill them a second after the queen was downed. They would have lost their flux, but that one star nocturnal tire iron it was about to drop was the important thing I guess.
---
Because mobile games want you to login regularly often to do chores. And the Fallout 76 devs were working on a mobile game before they started 76.
---
I stopped playing about 3 months after release. I'm waiting until more DLC, I'll jump in, complete main quests like the game is a single player game, then probably stop again. Hopefully by then everything will be sorted out, and if it is, I'll play it like the multiplayer game it's supposed to be.
---
Xbox.  I also like flamers, that‚Äôs why this one really struck a cord. If it was a weight reduction one I‚Äôd just use it as decoration but they‚Äôre heavy and I don‚Äôt have 1st so everything has to fit in my stash.
---
I wish there was some sort of way to easily transfer items between characters. I‚Äôd probably be more willing to just hang on to lower level stuff and hand it down.
---
Why do you need to do 494 damage?  I use an Instigating swing speed ski sword and the numbers get stupid with adrenaline, 1 swing kill everything,  2135 is way out of the park, it's not that big of a deal to have to swing twice.
---
Bethesda could add dual wielding for pistols and 1handed meelee weapon. This would balance one-handed weapons relative to the meta
---
Yes, a private server is still worth it for 1-2 players. This is what I do when I want to grind my dailies with my boyfriend but want to be left alone otherwise.
---
I can‚Äôt stand it when people blast music or whatnot. I‚Äôm down to communicate.....don‚Äôt want to hear your background.
---
Idk man the Fashnact Deathclaw One looks pretty badass. This one still looks amazing
---
I build utilitarian camps, they get me repaired/healed/de-raded/etc. Some flair but not much. 
---
To each their own, but I think I might have to build a launcher for the SnG's  of it!
---
That's actually part of the lore and is an intended part of the game. It is ZAX doing his experiments.
---
I think heavy gunner perks are broken in the PTS and not being applied at all. weapons with low per shot damage, such as the GL, were affected the least by this nerf.
---
So handmades and fixers should be fine still?
---
I think the humor and silliness is stronger then ever with multiplayer
---
The true endgame challenge.
---
I feel you. I'm getting sick and tired of Bethesda changing shit that doesn't need it while neglecting shit that needs fixed. I've been with the game since beta and have put up with all the past mistakes. Maybe I'll finish the Legendary Grind; maybe I won't. It seems like someone took the N from FUN and left us with a big F.U.
---
Who else does it just for the XP lol...or is it just me, sry üò¨
---
Those are plantable foundations.
---
Congrats! Really like that head piece you're wearing which one is it?
---
Nice joke. Never heard about it mystery free space
---
People are mostly looking for level 45/50 and there is some demand for level 1 stuff for mules and traders. There isn't much demand between besides people leveling.
---
If you put them in your machine for reasonable prices they will sell. I sold a Bloodied War Drum the other day for 1k caps. Same with 1* unyielding armor.. 3 or 4 hundred caps and they will sell.
---
Never heard about community not wanting a text chat, people say otherwise all the time (since beta)
---
i'm a rifleman and it looks like i'm screwed.
---
They said at quake con they were changing the system and getting rid of a lot of the restrictions to make it more similar to fallout 4. It probably won‚Äôt come until winter or early next year though :(
---
Did you know bear arms stacks with WWR armor?
---
that would be really cool
---
Yeah but it's sort of a dick move to the other bloodied players on the team.
---
Plenty of us don't do stuff like that.
---
Knew it stacked with rw weapons, but now i know more :)
---
I never pay any attention to most mobs at scorched earth. Only interested in the queen and Wendigos and Sloths. If I‚Äôm showing up I want flux and screws. That‚Äôs it. Y‚Äôall can have all those rolling pins shovels and pickaxes.
---
For me it's typically melee guys who 1-shot things. They should get out a Tesla or at the very least, any ranges weapon at all and use bash.
---
The best one is the one I got at the purveyor  junkies 25 15 guass pistol I never rolled for one w modules.too busy rolling armor
---
Why would you pick it again though, if it's maxed out?
---
IMO No.  There is SO much legendary gear in the game that being underleveled it's probably better to vendor it or just give it to an appropriate level player. There are exceptions if it's a great roll at level 35 or 40; and level 1/5/10 is sought after for people's mules; especially WWR armor.
---
and this is why this shit was nerfed, because it was just so open to abuse. Line in the Sand is a joke when you have one or two bloodied players down the spawn camping trick.  
---
Bunch of people complaining even though anybody with two brain cells knows the game is made too easy by all these overpowered legendary weapons and armour.   
---
I do hope they rebalanced enemies to make it more a game of knowing how to hit them and their weaknesses but Bethesda please ignore the complaining and don't buff it back up again. Now you just need to fix the difficulty of the enemies so even a high level player has a challenge.
---
That is nice. I always like to raid whatever is available in open camps heh
---
I‚Äôm at 515 without deep pocketed armor or any +str armor/weapons, I can see it.
---
High cap backpack is 120 :) and I do run 3star strong back for +30
---
next do Stalker melee
---
I can buy stable flux?
---
When I first started I think I killed a couple player ones before I knew.
---
Felt like a chore the whole time finished it up a few days ago with ALOT of queens and encryted events, funny tho still haven't got calibrated shocks for my strangler armor yet
---
I let my brother try NW (he‚Äôs a battle Royale fan that played almost every battle Royale out there) , and he said that it is the second most interesting battle Royale he played (his favorite is apex) , so yeah , I think with minor tweaks it would be great , I‚Äôm not a fan of battle Royale myself
---
Both fun as fuuuq though I have a bloodied one single star with mods and its beastly..it holds 45 rounds
---
Everything for lack of options menus accessibility, you can only acxess certain things  im certain situations (only see your missions while inside a server like really), horrible building mechanics, non existent inventory organizer, the list goes on and on, it's sad that they waste so much potential
---
At events they screw everybody over, even the people who aren't in their groups. Line in the Sand is unbearable with two of these guys present.
---
How about this: The Class Freak perk also affects the Mutant's legendary effect.  
---
For example: Without Class Freak, Mutant's adds 40% damage. With each point of Class Freak, Mutant's does 10% less damage. 
---
* 1 point in Class Freak, Mutant's does 30%
---
* 2 points, 20%
---
* 3 points, 10%.
---
The Strange in Numbers perk can add an additional 10%.
---
Anti armor does have a downside though, not every enemy in the game has armor to pierce. I run AA, have been since early May so yeah, there‚Äôs definitely a downside. AA should be at 35% unless all enemies scaled get armor, then 30% because you‚Äôd only ever achieve that 30% against the toughest of foes anyway.
---
It's late notice but just put this on amd 105 lbs are now off my character, insane!!!
---
Be nice if we get 150 million script like that cork and steal they wanted for the BOS.
---
I‚Äôve got a bunch of HRF and assorted masses. I‚Äôll trade you tomorrow for some stable flux or something. GT is Zug Vordanai
---
High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, and Hardened Mass all drop from enemies spawned in a Nuke Zone.   HRFs mostly drops from scortched and do so at a lower rate than the others.  In order of drop rate, it seems to be Glowing Mass, Ionized Meat, Hardened Mass, then HRFs.
---
Scortched Beasts do not drop any of these.  Also, I have yet to see any of these drop from floaters.
---
Most SB Queen fights take place outside of the nuke zone, causing the spawns to come into existence outside of the nuke zone.  So they won't drop any of these.  I always preferred fighting in a nuke zone, but so many players are bloodied these days and they drop dead with minor doses of radiation.  It's one fo the reason why I prefer a Junkies build, but to each their own...
---
As mentioned, a Nuked Whitesprings is a good source for these.  You can also cause Whitesprings to respawn.  
---
Just after or, better yet, prior to your first run, join a public Build Team (extra intelligence equals extra XP in addition to the team multiplier).  Once your first run is complete, close the Fallout 76 Application (don't exit through the Fallout menu, shutdown the application.  On the PS4 its through the PS menu).  
---
Re-launch Fallout 76 and select "Play with Team".  This will bring you back to the same server and the server will act like you are a new player, causing the glowing ghouls to re-spawn.  If you are doing this at the clubhouse, make sure that no players are in the clubhouse area prior to you closing the application or they won't respawn.  
---
You can rinse and repeat until the nuke zone is over.  Just make sure that you are still on a team that has other players in it before you exit each time.  Public teams makes this much easier now.
---
I want Deathclaws to be the next faction dlc and they have a giant city like Foundation on Deathclaw Island.  They'll all be wearing clothes and wielding guns and complaining about all the work that needs to be done.  Also there'll be this one asshole Deathclaw with a hat and beard who keeps asking you to track down missing equipment.
---
Baby deathclaws hatching like baby turtles, tryin to make it to water before the scorchbeast eats'em.
---
It will probably be ok..what sucks is that everything is nerfed not just bloodied..It would of been nice if they beefed up the not so popular ones but hey what do you do?maybe instigating is still solid.will see
---
Preeeeety sure the daily op info screen tells you about the mutations... just gotta read
---
What about the fact that the game pushes you to participate in events and earn legendary items while also punishing uou for having them since stash size is so limited and the vendor has few scrip to buy they from you. All those dumb limitations supposed to make the player get more addicted and grind for stuff just emds up making everything so frustating.
---
Consider this; a half-price purveyor sale is coming up. This means you'll be able to roll 3\* weapons for only 50 scrip, and (if they're rubbish) turn them in again for 40. So it'll only cost you 10 scrip per roll.
---
That's awesome, *however*... the scrip machine only has 150 scrip in it, so this seriously hinders your ability to keep rolling for legendaries and actually make use out of the sale.
---
If the purveyor 50% off sale goes ahead (which it will, since we've gotten every ATLAS reward thus far), then Bethesda NEEDS to increase the daily scrip limit.
---
I blame Bethesda for not fixing the issue sooner, the game shouldn't be THAT easy.  
---
Knowing Bethesda to make their "player must be a badass at all times" mentality into a MMO which is about team work. When I hear how some people can even solo the Scorchbeast queen THAT'S a sign the game has serious balancing issues.   
---
Now they've fixed the damage, they now need to reform how enemies take damage and make resistance more important. Start making the enemies at higher levels be a threat again.
---
Thisssss
---
I‚Äôve had those for a while now but thanks, it‚Äôs the actual mascot heads like the patriotic one that we got for owning the tricentennial edition. They haven‚Äôt been in the shop since March and I‚Äôm getting so impatient now to finally have them. üòîüòîüòî
---
No need to be confused. Some players yap about everything.
---
MMO's and other MMO like games have been asking is to log in for daily quests and whatnot long before smart phones were even a thing.
---
Lol I have 2 characters at max weight and a mule with 400 pounds on it, iv taken to selling every item in my stash for 250 for a 1 star 500 for a 2 star and 750 for a 3 star. And still cant lose the weight,    to make it worse I scripted everything that was 1 star in my stash today and a couple 2 stars and my stash weight went up by 20 pounds so now I'm maxed with like 8 extra items on my character
---
Because in real life floors go on foundations.
---
Arrogance and lack of communication from Bethesda and project managers, I'm sure devs are rushed and wotk their ass off while not even having time to do things right, while corporate only plans on the new BS stuff to add to the atoms shop.
---
yep so makes no sense why we're unable to
---
Same thing happened to me but I think it was my 2nd or 3rd roll, got a bloodied gauss mini with bash damage. Those gauss weapons with the broken secondary effects just shred everything
---
I can confirm that the Gatling laser was hit HARD as I always use one and I always use a Gatling plasma and a guass mini gun the plasma and mini gun are nerfed a lot but that is to be expected like any other weapon but are still usable. The Gatling laser right now if it was like it is in the pts now I would have scriped my bloodied FFR one the second I got it it got a 77% damage reduction for a weapon that was already just okay that is one heck of a Nerf.
---
I‚Äôm calling PETA
---
U still on?
---
My power was out the week it started and I still got the steel reward.
---
Exactly, corporate will never get it, they will neverunderstand the trade off between getting things right and doing things fast, or getting a few bucks from shops and subscriptions VS actually improving the game and making it thrive with a much bigger and dedicated player base. Truth be told, corporate is dumb, project managers are weak for not trying to change how things are, and bethesda is just a shitshow.
---
Yes, I am, and that is very appreciated. I wasn't sure if something happened and they removed the item from game or if it is based on your luck
---
Word thanks
---
Best thing on shotguns to me has be instigating plus limb damage. Usually kills everything but scorchbeast And wendigo colossi in one shot.
---
I'm a new player and I found one recently. I think I found it while dropping my first nuke at site bravo.
---
Damn
---
Alright give me a min cant sleep anyways
---
But no, that's not bad or anything.
---
Yep to both for me.
---
According to the challenges I still haven't located abandoned bog town and still haven't killed the queen. Despite killing her hundreds of times.
---
My GT is BadWolfGirl#1122
---
and that crazy fanbase that supports the game no matter what is what makes things be the way they are
---
Oh ok will look out for that then.
---
yea, the changes favor auto ever more now. literally makes sneak commando even more meta lol.
---
Stack, no because they don‚Äôt do the same thing.
---
Trigger.... I haven‚Äôt tested it, but I doubt it, because reboot actually prevents you from getting downed. Revenant only works after being revived; Reboot doesn‚Äôt *look* like a revive
---
Okay, I just done like 4 runs through Whitespring, and not a single HRF, so wasn't sure if it got removed or not
---
See this is why I turn them into tasty stew
---
I'm American too and play at random times,  but I'm only level 8. But if you'd still like to play, gamertag Bl00dyMaria.
---
:o can I maybe buy it from you? I really want it and been so unlucky with it. or maybe tell the trick? xD
---
the heavy gunner perks are probably not applying. did you account for that?
---
GT: Shearluck level 18 right now playing with a friend who‚Äôs also 18 I have a level 90 so I made some weapons and stuff for us
---
I doubt it's high on their priorities.
---
Still. It's a bit pathetic that these bugs have been present for almost 2 years unfixed. 
---
Then again. How long was the auto complete challenges bug in the game. Quite a while....
---
I got a unyilding strength chest today pretty proud
---
Assuming that Whitesprings was nuked, you should have gotten some.  Are you looking under Junk or under Aid?  It shows up under Aid, same as Glowing Mass.  Hardened Mass shows up under Junk.
---
I had the MAIA bug too and relogging fixed it, and I also had a scorchbeast I wasn‚Äôt able to kill, but luckily it decided to attack the robots in the city instead of me.
---
When I do this I have to sort by weight and script it that way. Dropped 80 weight last time.
---
spoilers, it doesnt
---
If I knew how those award things worked, I would give you one.  Thank you for speaking the truth!
---
Yeah I've got few goodies from a mate who doesn't play now, sweet as bro I'll add ya once I knock off
---
I know legendary shovels exist and I swear when I find one,  no matter the perks on it,  I will keep it.
---
Solely to say I have a Legendary Shovel and not be lying.
---
I'll take thedownvotes lol, I though patch certification on console was a known thing, you hear devs talk about it all the time and if someone can't google I don't see a reason to send a link
---
I'm sorry but you're a sucker for taking part of the brotherhood of steal "event"
---
Sorry about your mats tho, that sucks.
---
I literally scrapped mine today to make stash space fml
---
Aid, and I watch what I loot from the dead bodies of the enemies I kill first. Got a good amount of nuclear waste. Does weapon or luck affect drop?
---
If you're going for a shotgun build, remember to pick your perks wisely. A good shotgun is trash if you don't have the right perks.
---
People sell stable flux at 150-200 caps range, save yourself some time and just buy flux, if you on pc, people use text chat mod to trade, consoles have some sort of texr chat too. Nuke whitesprings, or morgantown (including airport) to get rad materials in a bulk
---
You didn‚Äôt get a bad one for sure but that limb damage will mmm spice it up
---
Yes. And it‚Äôs predatory behavior that some of us don‚Äôt like and don‚Äôt find reasonable. The fact that it exists and is done by other games does nothing to change any of this.
---
yep just tested out the plasma and the gauss mini they both benefit from heavy guner perks and they are still fine, well fine for what you can expect after the nerf but the Gatling laser is unseasonably weak just unusable, even the mini gun is not that bad and for a gun you have to spin up being that weak is ridiculous.
---
Someone did exactly the same thing to me over the weekend on PS4, walked through the door and died, upon respawn I noticed the infinite needle punjiboars under a doormat.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt
---
I'm sure Raider Punk gets the call on his radio from your pipboy and sets it up. All good.
---
You're in luck! Anytime you enter a nuke silo, the quest on how to launch a nuke starts automatically, whether or not you're on that quest.
---
Considering ACP landed on console with patch 21, couldn't they just enable it as planned then and delay the hotfix if that is the case?
---
The mats arent the issue, it was all common crap. The issue is the fact the some people really want the rewards, and asshoel like you are either to greedy or mean to let anyone have enything nice, ever.
---
I couldnt care less about the common garbage I lost, I care about the loss to the community event. My intent wasnt to gather trash, it was to help people who wanted rewards.
---
it's kinda your fault for walking around with that much junk. specially considering trap bases have been a thing forever now. I get the scenario, but still.
---
it's also your fault for believing the event is real and Bethesda is actually tracking progress. community events like this will always succeed unless they don't want it to.
---
And how long would have that taken to make? Its not like it would have been a 5 minute flick the switch now its co op, they would have had to rework the engine of FO4 (probably breaking everything in that) and can you imagine the onslaught if the DLC made a game in good working order into a buggy mess
---
Never seen it in vendors before, but I'll keep an eye out. I play on XBox, actually
---
Never said it was reasonable to do, just that its the reasoning why. Unfortunately with all top AAA dogs out there, it's going to be their norm.
---
Well it **is** in fact just two extra modifies in the old system but I didn't say that those don't do a lot. I just wanted to point out that melee took a much bigger hit, especially unarmed and that I find that sad, on the PTS a bloodied gauntled with shockpads on a dedicated unarmed build with all mutations and unyielding SS armor does less damage than a grognaks axe without any perks. I can do less with an unarmed weapon than others with two shots on a rapid fire gun and that isn't balanced either. I literally can't kill the new and improved level 100 mirelurk queens, neither with unarmed, rifles nor bows (those are what I got perks for but admittedly no legendary bow)
---
For me the idea is funny, in a normal sense, but the guy took all my stals scrap. Thats my issue. Not the junk, I didnt have anything of value on me.
---
Piss off, bigot.
---
that's weird. I'm pretty sure they're not working with flamers. are you sure they're working with GLs specifically?
---
If the issue was more of a Microsoft and Sony one, Would it not be safe to assume Bethesda is aware of this and might, you know, factor this into their calculations before announcing a launch date?
---
Food for thought.
---
It's worth it for that and the private server. Great for farming and grabbing a bunch of workshops without anyone challenging. Also comes in handy for those dailies that have everyone looking for the same thing. Like kill a deathclaw.
---
Carry a single,  non-optimized weapon.   That‚Äôs it.
---
If you‚Äôre bloodied and there‚Äôs no SBQ running,  use a damn mutants weapon.
---
Don‚Äôt. Be. A. Dick.
---
I didn't know how it functioned... I knew there were perks that you could stack together and get a multiplicative effect, but wasn't aware that this perk was not one of those perks. That's the whole point of this post.
---
Yeah, I got a good laugh out of it, I never carry junk anyway, then I just used a craftstation he had near a window to get in
---
Well I know when I needed it I could never find it but when I am not really using it I always find it. Like I got lucky and a player had 60 violet in vendor I bought and just get the ones I get from Queen events. I don‚Äôt craft ultrice ammo so I don‚Äôt use much. I will be on later I will message you and we can meet up and I‚Äôll give them for free
---
ah, what?
---
Wait what nerf? They really have to buff more stuff not cut out more functionality...
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4 this week.
---
I still have this problem with the diseases smfh
---
I can assure you that even if we fail this community event, we'll still get the rewards. It was meant to fail from the start.
---
This literally made me laugh out loudüòÇ
---
Fix the glitch that makes u hip fire when u go to shoot at an enemy, even though u are pressing the aim button. Happens to me in almost every game. Nerf the spawn rate of grenades. Buff spawn rate of stimpacks. Give us some kind of defense from people using  v.a.t.s. grenades on us and 1 shotting us, I think the fireproof perk card would help. Make it so the gauss shitguns doesn't cause your game to lag if someone is shooting at u with one, my character will just freeze while trying to jump away from it. It's not fair to die because of lag. People are complaining about this same thing happening in adv mode when someone is using the gauss, making everyone experience lag or frame drops while doing events.
---
Can usually find flux on trading markets for 150-200ea
---
Just keep trying. Trading posts are not allowed here so this posy will likely get removed.
---
Effing sludge lung...
---
It might be nice if they would tell us *why* is being delayed so much. 
---
Like "Hey guys, Earl down in Maintenence said all his items got deleted after exiting the event and we don't want that to happen to y'all on live. As for Earl, well. Fuck Earl."
---
And all of that is well and good. But, Bethesda is aware of everything you just mentioned and are sort of expected to factor such things into their calculations before announcing launch dates, you know, like every other studio somehow manages to do.
---
 replace or sell us better damn robots like mr gusty, assaultron, hell even tv robot from fallout New vegas make them customizable
---
Then stop defending it? You never said it was reasonable, but you are vesting a lot of posting towards pointing out how ‚Äúnormal‚Äù something is that you claim is unreasonable. 
---
Why are you even posting this? Bethesda themselves have requested feedback for continued tuning on the challenges and ways to improve the score system; since this was the first one. 
---
Many games have deviated successfully from the ‚Äúdaily‚Äù model.
---
The biggest positive the the Salty is it‚Äôs blazingly fast reload time
---
I don't think that weapons affect the drop rate.  My luck is at 6, so you should at least see a few if you are around the same level.  Glowing Ghouls have always dropped it, just at a much lower rate than Scortched.
---
Another thing to look for is an glowing Ultracite ore in the nuke zone.  Picking it will cause scortched to spawn.  You can continue to pull on it even after you have mined it, causing more spawns.  Typically, you'll find a node north of whitesprings, near the cabin, if that area is covered by the Nuke.
---
please feel free to foward idea to bethesda
---
I doubt that bethesda would engineer a cmmunity event knwoing full well it would fail. The negative PR would be awful.
---
Trick is having a friend anchor the location, and then cycling through all of your characters. As long as you don‚Äôt buy anything his inventory resets.
---
At least that‚Äôs how it used to work, Dunno if that has changed since I last did it.
---
But I‚Äôll sell ya one for 1k
---
I got 11 railway spikes from a SBQ today. Yeeeey.
---
It sounded good in my ears until i read the scaling is not even bringing the whole map to lvl50.Still 0 point running in around in the Forest as a high lvl.
---
Rads managment and dealing with such "problem" is the first thing a bloodied should learn, so you're doing them a favor, but keep in mind one thing :
---
The guys who has the choice : shooting them once to tag or killing it emptying a mag often do the second choice, that's the kind of players you should blame.
---
In my case i have a reduced weight tesla rifle ( can't always use it tho, that thing is not really stealthy ... )
---
I get limits to an extent as much as I hate them.
---
But at the very least let me scrip everything and have something weightless to trade in daily.
---
Also let's just make the cap a weekly one not everyone can get on daily if I want to burn my weekly cap in a day that should be my choice.
---
I'd settle for scrip notes and weekly limits.
---
Also what about veteran high level players? Will they get grand fathered in and receive whatever multiple of legendary cards because they already at 300 or 400?

If it's this easy and the PTS allows for gold to be used to buy any plans we missed then for me it's no problem and can deal with the situation of daily and weekly challenges. Unless they are bringing equivalent atom in the legendary run that we missed out compared to before then thats the only downside. And no, I'm just explaining it cause it seems like I am talking to a brick wall.
---
I never really carry important junk on me in larg amounts. I sell lead, bulk most everything else to sell to vendors, and walk around with a few things incase I need to repair in the field.
---
They don't feel strong enough to me.  Magic archetype needs a buff, tbh.
---
Have you heard anything about unarmed?
---
See the game shouldn't require multiple mules or choosing to drop stuff to be playable.
---
I'd be happy with scrip notes so we can atleast turn all the weight into something weightless.
---
I get that you're upset over this but that's no reason to call me an asshole.
---
Bethesda has basked in negative PR ever since fallout 76 first launched, even before that. Doesn't mean anything. Any PR is good PR for bethesda.
---
I spend 10 minutes stalking and potshotting someone until they drop, I deserve that pile of crap.
---
You were probably confusing it with Thru-Hiker, which reduces food weight.
---
You tried, but you should have thought first.
---
The cr and ar were meant to complement each other in fo4: good semi-auto/vats vs good free-fire automatic. The handmade was a dlc, end-game weapon that was meant to surpass the other two so that it felt like an upgrade from what you had played most of the game with.
---
In their usual short-sightedness, the devs just ported the guns over with similar disparities in utilitiy but made them all the same level.
---
I really don't think the devs played much 4 or 76 or had the time to think a lot through.
---
It's possible. Just try carrying around several hundreds of weapons at once. Massive frame drop. Unable to play. For some reason, it's okay when you hoard with your mule but not okay when you try the same with your main
---
Bloodied magic gauss minigun ~ 20 rolls in, pretty great, tbh.
---
As a bloodied build it‚Äôs huge. It‚Äôs basically the biggest threat to me in power armor, and still a nasty threat out of power armor.
---
It's true... but they really didn't do us any favors putting it off for so long. They should have fixed this back when they first suggested it needed to be fixed when the game was about 4 months old. They said a "balance pass" was in the works... and then silence for like a year.
---
Furious doesn‚Äôt pair well with explosive because if you hit anything other than the main target you lose the furious damage boost.
---
For shotguns, I recommend seeking out a magic shotgun because shotguns are underpowered. Magic shotguns do 3-4 times the damage they should in VATS. Check out Angry Turtle‚Äôs videos on YouTube about magic weapons for details.
---
ah yeah, I knew that. the problem is whenever I find him all my friends are offline and when they're on we can't find the damn not xD
---
Oh yes plz! Add me when you can :p
---
Does this work the same way for all quests? I'm a newbie and I'd hate to miss out on quests just cause I joined a public team and someone else completed it.
---
A
---
Even better: Humanoids.  So it's at least effective against Scorched, Raiders, Super Mutants, and Ghouls.
---
Just carry a non bloodied weapon?
---
Full commando and tank killer IMO plus one ground and pound
---
&gt; I'm sorry but you're a sucker for taking part of the brotherhood of steal "event"
---
The fact that youd rather just brush off the event even those who would liek to participate could use your help suffer.
---
I'm not saying you should dedicate your gaming time to this event like I did, but your doing more than just not participating. Your comment is the kind of post/comment that alot of people see and decide to not participate. You are doing worse than not helping, you are encoraging others to not help who might not care either way.
---
Thats why I call everyone who says things like that(Brotherhood of "steal", suckers for trying, etc) an asshole. Your to mean to let others have anyhting nice.
---
I mean I can test it but frankly now that it is additive instead even if the perks are not working on it with only a 25 damage that will not add much at all anyway, and with how bad it is on the pts it need a huge buff heck, most people on the pts are only taking one perk of each for damage so only 3 instead of nine because the 5% additive for one perk point is a waste of points plus I used my flamer and it was still working good I am pretty sure it still works on the flamer it just does not show in the pipboy. I know the laser rifle looks like it does not benefit from commando it stays at 60 but you do more damage with them on I think it is just a visual bug with energy weapon damage type.
---
literally just specd one of my characters for regular rifleman fml this isn't fair. Then before shotguns nerf I had my other chrlaracter spec for them and they were fucking nerfed like a week after.
---
It not a nerf per say but more of a reworked 
---
The formula is across the whole game went from multiplying to addition.  It only a nerf if one build is effected but because the current meta will still be the meta then technically it isn‚Äôt a nerf
---
I think you were the only one who thought they would
---
It could be a real long reach melee weapon too. Like a spiky bullwhip.
---
Would still be worthless with only 10% damage but yeah that would be cool. Assassin radiation guns would be awesome.
---
Welp better now then never.
---
Thanks for the suggestion.  I tracked it, then actually ran into a second Albino Yao Guai on my other character, but it was still no good.
---
Ok but no one cares
---
Goes full health build with decent handling on armor, almost negligible on the explosive though.
---
Oh I agree that's shit behavior. I was genuinely asking if proximity changes things for your teammates. Obviously people on other teams get screwed over either way, but I meant specifically on the same team. Just curious.
---
buff the unpopular, but don't nerf the popular AND unpopular. That just ruins the game.
---
No! **You're** breathtaking!
---
thoguht about what? Trolls? Traps? Assholes who have the sole intent to see this game dead and the community considered as toxic or vile as LoL?
---
I was trying to be nice, and didnt think people would be out there actively stopping others from trying to be nice during a community event.
---
Damage cap only matters if you‚Äôre shooting low levels at their workshops lol
---
Huh, I swear I though I read they were going to be  shared between characters somewhere, maybe I was wrong.
---
This.  I see mutant hounds drop through the floor grate upon death never to be seen again.  Happens so fast couldn't tell it they were legendary or not.
---
When was the update? I didn‚Äôt buy until they released Wastelanders, and I‚Äôve got one.
---
Afaik, it's just on pipboi and it will do proper damage when you actually use em on your enemies
---
I cry for that 20 lbs of carry weight I've been missing.
---
I keep a Junkie's shovel around for the cemetery daily.
---
I don't run a Junkie's build, I just felt the same as you do.
---
Added, although I‚Äôll only be online for a little longer tonight
---
I would say that it's worth it, just for the Scrap box alone.   One thing to note is that the scrap box is unique to each character.  So if you start a new character it will have an empty scrap box and not have access to the one used for your main.
---
You do not get a unique CAMP on the private server.  The CAMP you build is the same, whether you are on Private or Public.  It's basically just another public world, but limited to you and your friends.
---
Having the private server allows you to transfer stuff to a second character for storage (typically called a mule) by placing items in a world storage container (cigarette boxes seems to work best, but use the ones in the main world, not in interior spaces) and then switching characters.  You can still lose items if the private world goes down while you switch, but it's relatively safe.  
---
One of the big uses of having a Private Server is to run events.  For example, during Fashnauct I was able to get up to 3 runs in per hour.  I would start the event in a public world, complete it as quickly as possible, then jump to other, slower public worlds, then finally jump to one of our group's private servers.  This helps if you are looking for rare item drops from events.  I plan on doing something similar for the upcoming Meat Week.
---
As for the Atoms, it depends on whether you end up spending them or not.   Me, I like to spend them on CAMP items, but I'm a builder and like  to rebuild my CAMP every so often.  There are cosmetics for weapons etc., but so far the majority of Atom shop items are for CAMP building.  Of course, you can also use the Atoms on things like the Legendary Run to buy advancement on the board and reduce the grind.
---
why does it takes 6 months to release a little event that use ressources already availible in-game?!?!
---
Have people stop duping
---
I heard that it was supposed to be the legendary perks themselves shared between characters, but also could be wrong.
---
Man I see these I quit messages every day but the community is still going strong.
---
/r/thathappened
---
yep it is just a visual bug but even still the Gatling laser is WAY to weak as someone who always uses it I would never have even touched one the way it is in pts.
---
You never know - you might find yourself jumping back in 6 months or so down the line (servers permitting)
---
Until then, take it easy - all the best!
---
If you are quitting the game, how about you go out with a good gesture &amp; give your stuff away. No point it going to waste.
---
Thank you! It's morning for me, I'll be online in a few hours. So guess we'll meet tomorrow for you xD
---
Holy Mothman what de fuck did I just see.
---
I only got an anti armor magic gauss mini so far.  Its killing me rolling for junkies.
---
That said my record is currently a six second queen so I guess I'm pleased enough.  
---
Fricken event doesnt even start fully before she falls back into prime if the nuke is placed so you can stand right next to where she'll spawn.
---
NOT RECOMMENDED ON POPULATED SERVERS
---
Angry people follow you around forever.
---
You should have thought about all those things, but primarily you should have thought about the fact that ANY death would lead to your junk being thrown on the ground for anyone (asshole or not) to take. That was your first mistake.
---
I think the complaint boils down to two main points.
---
First is that these rewards could be added in any other way that encourages consistent play. You could add new events, new drops to existing events, mess with the drop rates to make things more enticing to grind out. Instead, the devs added a checklist with tasks I would wager a significant portion of people would never have otherwise done. It's not really content, it's just prizes locked behind an arbitrary "play for X amount of time" barrier. There are already rare plans and outfits in the game, locked to specific events or locations... Why not create new content with those prizes as the rare reward? Or place some of those new items in the overworld as a rare spawn? Why did it HAVE to be added as an engagement-keeping season system?
---
Second is that people can tell when they're being lured in to play more than they otherwise would, and they don't like it. It obviously works, which is why companies utilize those kinds of features. But that doesn't make them fun, or engaging. That just makes it feel like a chore, when the game should be fun, first and foremost. If it isn't fun, then what's the point in keeping players engaged if they only see reason to be dissatisfied? I'd wager most people who complete the season never even buy in to Atom purchases with actual money, be it spent on season ranks or not.
---
I was playing the game regularly anyways, so playing with an extra incentive is fine by me. But I can still see that the season system, in its current state, is a cheap way to keep people engaged, instead of offering any actual content to play through. (Heck, most games' seasons are like that - they all operate under the assumption that you'll play that game, and only that game, for as much time needed to unlock everything.)
---
I will give 76 credit for one thing, though. The season doesn't force you to be GOOD at the game to progress quickly. You just have to know where to go to complete your tasks (though the Nuclear Winter tasks can sometimes demand skilled play). It's a time sink, but you aren't necessarily gaining much by being a good shot or having crazy weapons.
---
Edit: I should say that I do agree, with the season set up as it is, that, if you want the rewards, you need to play more. But I only say this BECAUSE of the way it's set up, not because I think it's set up in a fun way. I also don't think the actual complaint being made by the general public of the F76 community has anything to do with being given the rewards without that participation. I think it's a lot to do with how it feels like we're just playing for the sake of playing, without any actual content to go with the launch of the season.
---
That is also my limited understanding.
---
Wow, that really sucks. Sorry thought it might help but things are weird right now. Hoping it'll get better with the patch tomorrow, but I mean, it is Bethesda, I'm bracing for more fuckery.
---
76 in a nutshell. If you play "fair" you get fkd if you cheat or troll you get to reap the rewards because there's zero consequence. You spend all this time grinding for what? Nothing to show for it but lost time. Thats why many people dont even take part in events.
---
It sounds like the best purchase
---
I‚Äôve also been wondering the same thing, also do the smaller events reward it like a blast at Seneca rocks and the messenger have a chance to drop it. I‚Äôve been doing every savage divide event for 6 months and still don‚Äôt have itüò¢
---
If it takes killing a game or two to get Bethesda to stop producing broken, shitty games then so be it. I'd rather tank 76 and get a decent game that actually works and doesn't have micro/macro-transactions coming out of it's ass.
---
The thing that bothers me is the "Big" things , SbQ and the Colossus. Rewards neeed to be raised to guaranteed 3* cause the ammo&amp; aid consumption is gonna go up uf these nerfs go through
---
In the end it will since the odds of the op items increases by alot
---
Yea can confirm it double the raw flux 
---
And I believe good with salt also slow down the expiration on it
---
you do have a massive ego. now I remember you.
---
first, nobody was targeting you specifically. the guy just had a trap base setup. was he cheating? I suppose so, since Bethesda is fixing boards. but the point is that he didn't go
---
&gt;oh boy now I just have to wait for some sucker carrying 25k wood for the atlas event to show up
---
I bet he was just as surprised as you. hell, he must've thought you were a duper.
---
and second, you're even more naive than you let out in that other topic, for thinking this 'event' was ever going to fail. I doubt Bethesda even have the means to track progress. they just fill the bar with whatever number they feel like, because events like these are supposed to give players even **more** inane busywork while they quote unquote, 'work' on new content.
---
We all thought it but i just steal them most people dont lock it.
---
I got in to an argument on here yesterday about people openly whaling on the game. Was told to stop victim blaming when I got mad that someone said they don't care about the bugs and will spend tons as that's "just the way it is now".
---
Same here except fore excavator P.A. build which is closer to 300.   I try to keep \~100 lbs free but use weapon weight reduction armor, and bandolier to reduce weapon weight penalties. Keep food/drink minimal and constantly scrap junk and dump it off at the survival tent.  Usually carry 6 rilfes when exploring, but only 2 if trying to gather enough weapons to meet daily cap limit.
---
Exactly, I even remember they said the idea was that you could use them on your new toons to give them a boost and I thought, well that‚Äôs cool.
---
I mean, I did make a bunch of caps selling the lesser loot, like oil and copper and such. Reached the 1400 cap limit every day. And gained like 4 levels. But thats not the reason I was doing this. I was doing it for the community.
---
I wasnt playing fair or cheating, I was being nice instead of mean.
---
I'd love to see Legend of Zelda- levels of chicken aggro...
---
Stop hoarding and take a break or just get fallout 1st
---
It‚Äôs in doors.
---
It‚Äôs in the same section as the nuka cola door.
---
Does not happen to me. Not even the other glitches. I‚Äôm overecumbered, I have marsupial, speed demon, unstable isotope and electrically charged. So you might be able to discard those.
---
Can.I.Have.Your.Stuff
---
I mean it would've made logical sense to pool the coins together, but considering how grind heavy this game is, I suppose this way makes more sense lol
---
I know the junk thing, but I dont expect my junk to hit the ground when I walk into someone completely normal looking camp. Thats within radar distance of Vault 76.
---
I am careful to play defensive in anything so I dont die all to often, dropping my junk. But I dont play defensively in a player camp.
---
Have you considered they made it that way on purpose so that you wouldn't be able to do what you are mentioning. Not saying I agree, but I believe that it's intended what you are describing
---
Honestly I think the game will benefit a lot if they reworked the armor and weapon in the game. I think gearset and quality would be better then the 3 layers of RNG we currently have.
---
I read Bloodied still highest dmg , BUT will it actually be worth it? I went low health after the TSE nerf and switched to Junkies 1 month back - there is 0 chance i would switch back to Bloodied anymore.
---
The dmg difference is minimal and it feels like i can never die with full health lmao, i still run Unyielding 4pcs + 1 Vanguard cause they have the best possible rolls.
---
Not specced into any defence and no need to manage rads all the time either or worrying being hit by a Cockroach
---
What system?
---
I looked through my doors category several times and can‚Äôt find it still. Hope it‚Äôs not a bug or something. The only reward I can‚Äôt access. Could also me being stupid but I‚Äôm pretty sure It‚Äôs not there for me
---
Fuck.
---
Off.
---
Bigot.
---
You dont need a magic shotgun all you need is the right piece of armor.  Equip any piece of legendary armor with "reduce damage while blocking by 15%"  and any old shotgun is now magic!
---
Bethesda doesn't want to listen, hell just look at their insistence for continuing the trend with perk coins and punishing long term players that changed their build or opened up Perk card packs losing duplicates despite absolutely everyone telling them how bad that is
---
Bloodied still has the most damage/defense synergies. TSE might make a comeback.
---
I'm tentatively planning on doing no-PA Bloodied Heavy Gunner/Shotgunner for normal play. Swap into my PA for SBQ.
---
I have a set of Troubleshooters armor I use for when Encryptid pops.
---
Considering building a Ghoulslayers armor set for the Colossus, gotta make sure it works on Wendigos first though.
---
I felt the same way. I went through doors and couldn‚Äôt find it and then spends a lot of time going into other sections.
---
Until I went back to doors and found it like an idiot I am.
---
Instead of going right I went left when scrolling through the items and I found it in doors where the nuka cola secret door is.
---
I love my fancy shotgun. It‚Äôs a fucking magical beast. I did radiation rumble and held the back tunnels on my own and killed about 60 glowing on my own while the other 5 high level players struggled protecting the other tunnel. 
---
First time I finished the event and left with 30 nuclear material and a bunch of glowing blood and a shit legendary (surprise surprise).
---
Just know when you ask this question everyone will say its worth it. Anyone who doesn't will be downvoted.
---
50-1
---
What does this even mean?
---
Nah I get your point but how do we know that is the issue without full transparency from developers
---
This sounds like when the Adrenaline perk was bugged and not working.  My stealth build with an instigating crossbow could clear out West Tek no problem with no damage if you keep the Adrenaline perk fed with regularly spaced kills.  Otherwise, the crossbow is worthless in a crowd (takes a long time to reload).  If I can't one shot enemies, then I lose stealth and get mobbed instantly. This damage nerf sounds like it affects stealth builds big time.  This will kill any stealth sniper build as one shot kills are essential to keeping stealth active and damage up.  I have a bunch of gat lasers for scorchbeasts, but sounds like they will be utter garbage with the nerf.  I might make my shotguns useful, since the rubber band effect  is based on doing too much damage from what I hear.
---
not an argument. you know what's an argument? that more people make topics complaining about the grind than the opposite.
---
but you cannot really argue against that, so you resort to namecalling. so have a good one.
---
and be more careful next time you go wandering in a base with 25k junk.
---
How many daily ops available?!?
---
And the once per day reward tier is for each ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù or just once per day across them all?
---
Wasn't the assault rifle supposed to get a cosmetic update?
---
I mean there is still a high chance of that happening anyway lol
---
Haven‚Äôt seen one,  I do however get near constant bloodied drops as a non-bloodied character.
---
Most recent is a bloodied FFR plasma Gatling.
---
Sorry to reply to ya again but if anyone wants the fancy shotgun I think the only way is through the pleasant valley claim tickets. I had like 20 of them and just decided to turn them all in not even knowing about that gun. I think I turned in 10 or so before I got it. 
---
You have to complete Rose‚Äôs quest. Forgot the name of it to get access to the area.
---
I dont want to argue with a bigot. Literally every argument you could come up with is flawed and looses instantly.
---
Then why have a purveyor sale? She's not gonna give me a good roll on my first or second attempt, it's gonna take a lot more than that. And once I've depleted the scrip machine for the day, I somehow have to store all of the leftovers and turn them in slowly over the next few days just to get back the scrip that I spent.
---
It's not good game design, whichever way you spin it. It's tedium.
---
Agreed lol
---
Yeah, so long as you go full auto.  Semi auto is junk now.
---
I wish meat chunks wouldn't fall through grated floor no matter how large or small
---
6 seconds?  That's faster than I can kill it.  How do you do that?
---
They SORT OF are.
---
Unlocked slots are account wide. 
---
You unlock 1 perk slot per 50 levels. If you have a level 300+ on your account, all your characters have 6 slots (the max).
---
They really need to get rid of perk coins. Give us perk scrappping as it‚Äôs own thing. Give us legendary points based on the sum total of the level of every character on the account (can‚Äôt go negative if you delete a character, but you can‚Äôt make a bunch of new characters and level them up quickly to try and gain more points).
---
This means no punishment for people who have lots of perk variants; no punishment for people who change builds a lot, no punishment for people who lost duplicate perks when opening perk packs, no punishment for people who like to have alts. Everyone is on a relatively fair playing field.
---
Bethesda fucked up this bad? Maybe the PTS was a bad idea if console players are going to be shafted
---
It's maddening sometimes. 
---
I wanted to make an open garage area on the cliffside of my camp.
---
Used concrete and made a nice little work area, used conduit as a makeshift railing that looks rather convincing and actually works to keep you from falling off.
---
I added 4 beams and then tried to put a roof over my workspace...
---
So I tried using stairs and then deleting stairs, only to get the 'parts will be un accessible' message. 
---
I don't want stairs up to the roof. It's an awning, it can't hold weight like that lol.
---
Le Sigh.
---
Just read your previous comment about fending off raiders to save some deathclaw eggs, and what if....
---
As a very rare reward, we got a plan to build a deathclaw nest at our bases that would act as a defense/pet. This would help solve a lot of issues with tamed deathclaw being killed so easily.
---
Mama dulces. I farm quantum there for nukashine.
---
Had one, but sold, regret. 
---
One day i find one, to rule them all!
---
This is the actual answer. Lazyness (as usual). The Handmade was an endgame powerhouse received in the last DLC of Fallout 4, they simply ported it over in FO76 without changing any of the properties, so yeah - it makes the other options look bad.
---
My hunch? Easy food. I've heard two players talk about how it's hard to get food in Fo76. I tend to just loot the meat off of the stuff I kill, so I haven't had any issues. If my character is hungry, I'll try to wander around where I know there will be radscorpions, mirelurks, or bugs to hunt &amp; kill. I haven't quite figured out where raddeer are in order to start hunting those for their food's carry weight bonus.
---
I kick people whenever a friend wants to join my group.
---
I priority kicking people who are not sharing cards when that happens. If their all sharing cards I pick the name I dislike most.
---
What perks should I be looking out for?
---
If you feel that playing the game is a chore, maybe stop playing the game.
---
Stable flux is a rare sight in xbox vendors.
---
It took a huge hit, but it‚Äôs still playable.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs viable for end game play.  I just tried out my sneak unarmed character versus the mutants outside Westek for 10 min or so.  Not the same experience as before.....at all.
---
Or make it so it's obvious the brahmin are owned. Like the red "steal" font/icon we had in FO4.
---
Try the vendor at Camden park. I think that is where I found mine
---
Welch train station usually has it, all the way down south in the ash heap
---
Are you using any weight increase perks, consumables or even armor that ups your inventory maximum? 
---
If you are, they can also increase the chance of this happening.
---
The milk does take away radiation. Useful if you don't have the decontamination shower yet.
---
All master shotgun perks. They are in strength category. You also want scatter shot. As well as a couple others I can't think of. Also, get the gunsmith perks card to tier 5 so you can learn and build all upgrades for your shotguns. Weapon artisan will give your weapons longer life and shotguns break quickly.
---
All 19 mutations, now this seems like a fun side charecter. I shall call him Chaz cause he will be the rad-est
---
There‚Äôs someone on my team right now called Tickle My Flaps - would you kick them off?
---
The main problem with the game. Is the fact that they chose not to go with a standard MMO server style. Instead they chose to go with a more of a call of duty instant quick match type service system.
---
Man I feel you last summer I was in northern cali, blackouts were all a'aout no fridge for 5 days, don't even get me started. Not to mention a/c fuck that
---
I do the same but mainly for the reason that I dislike how the PA jetpack looks.
---
Uggghh. The worst, I'm sorry. Give it a few days, and he'll be trying to tell you how the game works/tell you that you are playing wrong üôÑ
---
I use to sell my not-needed legandaries for less than -100 caps but they started taking up too much space so, I stopped.
---
They said they would be and I am disappointed they are not.
---
Edit: okay they may have said things which those not paying attention may have construed as....
---
Have an upvote from me
---
What are you even talking about? It's the exact other way around, one of those bugged "magic" shotguns don't even need a single shotgun related perk to turn a target into giblets. 
---
I run with an Instigating/Limb Damage/DR while reloading combat shottie and the only difference between perks and no perks is "Do I overkill, or do I 60% more overkill?". None of the other accuracy and crippling quality of life perks even matter when you're in VATS and a dead target is pretty crippled alright...
---
All of these improvements seems possible beside 60 FPS, do you really think Bethesda will be able to make their game perform the way it‚Äôs supposed to be?
---
So I am a junkie heavy tank.  The weapon is a magic anti armor, bashing, 90 reduced weight gauss minigun.
---
The nuke is placed so that Fiasure prime is right on the very edge of the zone.  Basically so you can stand right next to where sbq will spawn, and still not die to the nuke at impact.
---
With proper amounts of server lag, the magic effect is far far, FAR more pronounced than normal.  
---
When the queen, or any scorchbeast for that matter, spawns, they stand still on the fissure for a few seconds before taking off and beginning their offensive.  In that time, spin up and start blasting her right in the face from point blank.  
---
With just my perks, gun, and psychobuff I got about 48 ish listed damage per round on the pop up numbers, but she died in about 6 seconds cause "magic".
---
The scorched earth event hadn't even fully started, and as no one else even shot her before she died, no one else got drops from her.  Because the event hadn't started yet, no one, not even me, got event rewards.  Not treasury notes, no flux, no armor.  Nothing.
---
I got a 2 star assassin harpoon from her tho.  Needless to say, no one left the event happy.  I think I saw a few lunchboxes pop, but everyone else was at v9 when I did it.
---
I call them shitnaders
---
Can I haz ur stuff?
---
I do the same with my camp! I intentionally built mine close to vault 76 so newbs can get supplies.
---
For the folks who, understandably, want to keep their camps locked, I kind of wish there were a "Property of [player name], keep out" sign. The regular "keep out" signs feel too much like decoration, considering how many regular "keep out" / "restricted" signs the main character gets to ignore in the game.
---
Some of us don't used bugged magic shotguns man.
---
Depends on the other 2.
---
LOL the content creator comes to complain about someone complaining about him. First time I've ever seen that.
---
I know one thing I've only ever worked in the auto industry, but If anyone ever fucked things up and missed deadlines as badly as these people do constantly heads would-be rolling and new team's would be brought into sort things out. This is all Bethesda management fault.
---
Or just don't carry junk to begin with.
---
I've recently gotten my base carry weight (without chems and alcohol) to 355. I will generally have 170-200 free. It definitely depends on the day I'm playing, what events I participate in, and how often I drop off scrap.
---
Edit: I forgot to add that those numbers are going to go up as soon as I can put Deep Pocketed on my Secret Service limbs. I have jetpack on the chest piece because it's fun as hell.
---
I stop going after legendarys after only getting tons of walking cane, tire iron, and 1 star armor off a 3 star! I only go to uranium fever for the steel and to the sbq for the xp and flux now days.
---
You, sir or madam, have no poetry in your soul
---
For shotguns though it isn‚Äôt overrated correct ?
---
LOL
---
Then why have the purveyor sale? Because it's an incentivized reward to look forward to, and one which doesn't really need new assets created to run. They don't have to pay the art team to create it, or the programmers to implement it since it's been done a long time. It drums up excitement in the player-base, which people can save their scrip to take advantage of- minor advantage of. Because it's a system with intentionally designed limits.   
---
You can only save up so much scrip since there's a limit, that's so you don't manage to get TOO MUCH advantage from something like this, because you might be able to roll too many times and get whatever it is your looking for too fast. Same with the daily limits you can make from scrip- that way, you can't keep playing for fifty hours, grind legendaries, and find the perfect gear in a week or two, recycling all the legendaries and thus run out a goal for that system, other than simply selling stuff off to make money. Eventually, you'll get what you want- like let's say you decide to trade for it.  
---
But even there you can see a design choice to limit your methods, you have a daily cap limit. So you can't make enough money from their vendors without spending a bunch of consecutive days logging in and saving money. Oh, and while you're doing your daily scrip/cap runs, you boost their player count while being exposed to the various cosmetics and possible things you can buy in the game or see in the game and earn via playing even longer or spending actual cash, most of which, typically, have some sort of time gate which incentives daily logins to perpetuate the same cycle.   
---
And if you want to store the useless gear to scrip later, instead of grinding out more gear later and just tossing it? Well, you need to keep ahold of it. But it weighs a significant amount, taking space in either your inventory or in your stash. You know what frees up a lot of space so you can store more things like that? Fallout 1st, since you can stash all your junk away for free.
---
I presume this means meat week is delayed too. Couldn't a compromise of been to give console players meat week early once you knew you'd delay Colossal Problem on us?
---
Read the post again mate
---
I feel like you should know where to find food by level 10, TBH. Assuming they're at least starting the main quest line, there are recipes to get you by (I don't remember if we got them in the vault, or if we got them from the first responders).
---
I had to keep telling a level 15 character not to eat raw meat/drink unboiled/raw water. Repeatedly. In addition to all the times on the main &amp; responders quests you're told not to do this.
---
Dude is leaving FO76 to play Skyrim for the 568th time.
---
my max is 205 (1 str, fridge backpack for +30, marsupial for +25 or whatever)
---
and I usually carry like 90-100lbs of stuff on me, right after an inv cleaning
---
so about 105-115 free weight.. ish
---
Jokes on you I have a thousand gamma cells and a TS25 Gamma Gun.
---
I can play that game all day.
---
I‚Äôm not sure that would be enough, and I‚Äôm not sure if this dev team has the skill to create dual wielding.  Making one new end game event seems to have tested the limit of their capabilities.
---
Doing the Lord's work here! I found someone's camp who had ammo for 1 cap for each individual ammo. I stocked up and spent almost all of my caps.
---
If that was your camp, OMG, thank you. You let this level 30-something participate in two Scorched Earth events ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I used AR, got BFFR, JFFR, JE and AAE so far for my Commando Build.
---
The one I find dead or unable to get enough people for is project. I'm on Xbox and have given up on trying to get the stimpack diffuser plans mainly if I can get enough people to play it we only have enough people for 2 animals max. If we get three were to thinly spread to keep all alive and one is always at 0 level. Wish we had cross platform or at least a auction house that was cross platform.
---
FFR for stealth. Explosive doesn‚Äôt benefit from headshots or sneak attacks
---
 You can do a 1500 damage crit sneak headshot and have a 100 damage explosion pop off it.
---
But 10mm SMG isn‚Äôt a good weapon as it stands. No scope mods, and more importantly no suppressor.
---
I saw a video angry turtle did and he said it took a huge nerf but didn‚Äôt show any gameplay with it, I love playing my unarmed/heavy gunner build so I hope they fix that
---
Here's a funny thing. I wrote something like this a day or two ago, about this subreddit being funny, all post are complains about something in-game being broken.
---
Yup. Got down voted, and this guy right here gets awards. Funny. Have my upvote.
---
Then just use the foundation version?  Why are you making a deal about not being able to place "floor" pieces at ground level when you could just place a foundation instead to accomplish the same exact thing?
---
That combo is absolutely brutal. I got mine unmodded off of a vendor for like 1k caps, I don't think the dude was aware of what he was selling.
---
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know.
---
Even on PC it's tedious, and we catch a small break by being able to hit escape to exit.
---
They are called proasssniffer106 and penisjarguy1986, which one would you kick?
---
First responder vendor in the church of flatwoods
---
Handmade does have higher damage per *shot. 
---
Most people mean damage per second when they say DPS; LMG has higher damage per second.
---
Also just not into the idea of using a weapon that's so powerful it takes the difficulty out of the game. The combat is the only challenge in this title. Being op would just kill the game for me.
---
Thank you!
---
Yea since the new update my game does nothing but blue screen. I did manage to load in one time before being BS'd so that's a plus I guess.
---
They can get Brahmin from Flatwoods since no one can build a camp in the town, and it has a ton of brahmin there.
---
.... of course you can see it and purchase it again
---
 Sometimes you want multiple ranks. I have some perk setups with 5star adrenaline and some with 1star. 
---
But I‚Äôm on PC with PLM, so there‚Äôs that.
---
My guess is the gauntlet will gather dust in the stashbox, and you‚Äôll go full time into heavy guns.  It might be good versus mole rats, just not the lvl 100 ones in the Bog.  LOL
---
K, bye
---
You have this completely backwards, friend.
---
They didn't change SPECIAL at all.
---
no what they did is fine. its a shard system that ensures optimal performance and so that the world isn't over-crowded.
---
You did ‚Äúwaste‚Äù them, but don‚Äôt worry about it,  you‚Äôll get plenty more as you play. You get another one every level, forever.....
---
"Comes to complain about someone complaining about him"
---
Say that 10 times as fast as you can.
---
I dont recall complaining, nor do I recall the post I replied to complaining about me.
---
First time I've ever seen a simple correction of a statement being categorised as a complaint though.
---
Lot of firsts around here today it seems...
---
Well I guess you should have paid more attention.
---
No problem. I run a shotgun build myself so I get it man
---
Every piece of armor I use has weight increase modded in. I'm going to take those out and see if this fixes it.
---
RNG Isn't bad if done right i believe. However, they went a bit overboard in this game, lol. Although if they were to remove scrip limit, that would make it a bit better. I have 4 characters max stash and carry weight with legendaries. Hundreds of them! Im a hoarder, i know.
---
It would be nice to see additional weapons, prefixs, suffixs, and 4 and 5 star gear.
---
Would the ceiling of your open area be at any point be in contact with an adjacent exterior wall?  If so put up a wall temporarily where you want the roofing, place the roofs and as long as there is any contact with the previously existing walls you can remove the temporary and keep the ceilings.
---
Long gone are the days where games would be released in a final stage, today all game producers do the same, launch something that looks more like an alpha product, throws pieces of bread and all the crazy fans will come rushing to eat them, the cycle repeats and the business model thrives, sadly ppl don't realize what they are doing.
---
....huh, never thought of that. Gut reaction says no, but I have no idea, and what ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù rarely ends up true in this game...
---
Why thank you! :)

I‚Äôve always been a heavy gunner but just started using unarmed the last couple months to save ammo and it‚Äôs super easy to swap between them. I‚Äôve had the best luck finding unarmed weapons so this hurts me
---
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that we invited the same people again.
---
Thanks for your input! And yeah VATS been acting up (and at random times it seems, too).
---
Penisjarguy obviously. Sounds like someone who cuts peoples dicks off to add in to collection. 
---
The other 2 listed here isn‚Äôt that bad If you put all 3 together.
---
Edit : Shit that would offend the penis guy. He might come after me.
---
I've been saying this since this first went on the PTS. I got chased out of town by antipvp players foaming at the mouth calling me a griefer.
---
Don't know why people are downvoting you.
---
I also kick people if I have a friend who wants to join the team. Or I leave the team and start a new one. 
---
I don't normally kick because of perk cards because the way I see it is it's a buff you wouldn't normally get if you were solo. 
---
It is pretty shit when you have 3 people all staring Strange in Numbers though.
---
But we can and do regularly print more money.  No inflation is bad.  Too much inflation is bad.  Deflation is bad.
---
A tiny bit of inflation is good.
---
ty for telling me it has no bounty. now I'll go and kill every player's brahmin like the raider I am :D
---
I stopped questioning downvotes.
---
There are 10 ore nodes in each tunnel, 40 in total, and they are separate for each player. So just three people collecting ore in turns could easily fill the quota of 100 ore needed for the highest reward tier. Also, they do respawn after a while, so if you start gathering right when the event begins, you can do at least part of a second run through the tunnels towards the end.
---
But yeah, you can not get the bar to 100% if you're the only one gathering ore, and even the 75% for even a small chance at the best rewards is really a stretch. Which is why the current event structure is so broken: if you're the only one at the event who cares about the rewards and everyone else is just there to farm ghouls, there's no way for you to get there.
---
Ooof these these things are completely disconnected from pvp.
---
im a rifleman and 2handed bloodied build. If the nerf is massive and im rendered useless then i quit the game
---
its pretty much how it suppose to be. You know, its end game boss, not few minutes farm-able npc. Just ignore end game bosses when you think they are hard.
---
I feel like a lot of people cheering on the damage nerf are also forgetting that ammo weights a shit ton. Once had 1500 ultracite 2mm on me and it took up 75 fucking pounds of carry weight üò¨ not cool
---
Weapon Mods are one thing to be aware of.
---
Outside of that, depends. Not equipped? Bloodied and junkies won‚Äôt show their bonuses, so they‚Äôre out. Furious never shows its bonus. Nor does instigating. Basically 2shot, and explosive are the only ones that‚Äôll show if not equipped. 10% only is in effect while ADSing so it will NOT show in pip-boy.
---
You didnt like the way he painted you, what a joke. Don't make content if you can't take criticism. Clearly something you gotta work on. There's firsts all day around these parts.
---
If it's dead all the time then it's not players it something else a nearby spawn, try moving your camp.
---
It sounds like you are part of the problem
---
As long we don't have to set the tables by finding all the utensils, repair robots, and kill ghouls, then I am down for this idea.
---
I didn't even notice an info screen.  Anyway, I always have to learn the hard way.  Story of my life.
---
TBH I feel like it does great close range, I don‚Äôt need a scope for it. It destroys things up close lol not as much damage as the Handmade but it‚Äôs gotta slightly bigger mag I think
---
Pick a theme and design the camp (not just the displayed items) around it.  I currently have a Nuka Cola Museum as well as a Museum of Technology (with a dark secret), currently trying out some playful "trap" designs to give me ideas on my next camp (likely when instanced camps launch)..
---
Side note... Someone mentioned mini-nuke parts from Watoga Underground??? I'm gonna need those. Also, just in case anyone reads this and has it, I'm looking for a displayable Robobrain Interpolator and a Signal Repeater (I know they are quest items, but I also know that displayable versions exist).
---
But that's my favorite event
---
The main problems is us console folk we can't try these changes. It all well and good trying it out on PC on the PTS but when your missing 2/3 of you audience out. How will using a controller compared to keyboard and mouse effect game play?  We don't have hot keys etc. Maybe of we could get to try the changes there would not be so much of a back lash. 
---
But in my opinion they should buff the other weapons back to rival bloodied do something with the useless prefixes on weapons and release one wasteland. The enemies are all more difficult to everyone. Every build is viable, every weapon is viable, then decided how to balance if again things are easy still.
---
Isn't it technically incredibly easy to roll a bugged "magic" gauss mini? There are so many modifiers that cause the effect, that traditional damage boosters like bloodied or junkies is more like icing on the cake (with junkies being the bugged prefix by itself.)
---
One thing that I‚Äôm *pretty sure* is still a thing is Bloody Mess still acting like a true multiplier. Which honestly it should, otherwise it‚Äôs such a small benefit it‚Äôs hardly worth it.
---
Go play Animal Crossing
---
Still working?
---
They are all really easy and quick but leveling up isnt
---
It's entirely free standing. I tried using walls but kept getting the same message. I messed around with different options, as I mainly wanted to keep the spectacular view as open as possible, while still having my workarea covered from rain.
---
Ended up just using stairs off to the side and then blocking them with the collectron so they're not as visible. I'll take screenshots tonight.
---
Its the fact that I have to log in daily that is the grind, it doesn't matter how long i need to be logged in for. Any other game I can take a week off and come back and still quite easily max out the battle pass.
---
I agree that its not hard but the way they have done it has made it feel like a chore, which is what has killed it for me. I'd rather be able to play 8-9 hrs on a saturday then have to play 30mins a day for a week. 
---
Here's hoping that next season they'll change it up a bit :)
---
Sounds like you never pvped against tryhards in pc
---
Pts has limited players. More people playing on live servers more likely they'll find something game-breaking quickly, to patch before verifying to push to consoles
---
You have to change the skin THEN move your camp. Sorry man, that‚Äôs the fix
---
 Dual wielding was in Skyrim and that uses the same engine as the fallout games so i think they could do it, heck for Fallout 4 modders were able to do it.
---
You know they can add as many slots as they want right? It's not a finite thing.
---
No
---
I have that too. Strange that Grognak differs from other magazines.
---
I was largely unbothered by the majority of issues over the game‚Äôs lifespan, but p22 will be a train wreck if it goes live as-is, which it likely will.  Casual players will have a harder time anywhere they go, the gains for min/maxing for hardcore players have been castrated, and everything feels more tedious and somehow bland.  Now that all weapon legendary effects are largely the same, nothing feels special anymore.  
---
The new system heavily favors automatic weapons even more so than the live game.  If you thought commando and heavy gunner were meta now, just wait.  A melee or rifleman build will be like seeing a unicorn.
---
In time you will have several hundred points to play with don't worry about it
---
üëçüèºüëçüèº, 369 levels now
---
I‚Äôve got 2 bloody, second one is also limb damage.
---
They‚Äôre still rather weak, but fun sometimes. I miss the old days of overrepair :-(
---
Yo how fucking dare you want to leave this game because your build that you worked hard for is getting nerfed into oblivion üò°üò°üò†üò†üò°üò° /s
---
‚Äúfor free‚Äù
---
you mean for $15 a month actually
---
It is connected. Most pvpers are hardcore players and they do whatever they can to take advantage. I'm not talking about some casuals fighting over some workshops level of pvp here. I'm talking about these people that crash servers out of anger cause they lost
---
Shit I scrapped mine bc I thought that I could just get another if I want one
---
*Most events give you lots of useful junk anyway.*
---
I would prefer if people started a new team and left instead of kicking me to start over for no reason
---
Yes it is, as the rof is so high on even the base model that pushing past 200 is easy, and as you say, there are a multitude of effects that cause it.  But note that I said the gun I used was anti armor on a junkie build.  Thus there is really no benefit I'm getting from it other than magic.
---
I want junkies because at any moment the benevolence of todd could descend upon us and fix the glitch.  Also, junkies is one of the effects that cause magic, so my desired J 25 90 gauss mini would very much suffice to be magic until such a day comes.
---
They should just let us go nuts during the sale remove the limit and trade-in limit all together during the sale rinse and repeat still have chance to end up with nothing die to trade in losing some amount of scrip.
---
But seriously I play for hours on end every day. And im so over the limits imposed on me.
---
If I've got the ability to play let me play.
---
I've not experienced that kind of latency before.
---
Unrelated to my comment. How is a level 10 supposed to know that you have a Brahmin pen and he shouldn‚Äôt kill your Brahmin?
---
This would be an epic way to bait people.  Intentionally drop a sweet bag with 50 ballistic fiber, rando grabs it, kill him to get your ballistic fiber plus the randos junk to boot.
---
Crossbow is fairly unpopular. And I went from one-shotting level 68 mutants to double-tapping level 100 Super Mutants. How is this more dificult? Pistol assembly was bad to begin with and I leveled to 130 only by using pistols, in time where they didn't benefit from the Tank Killer perk.
---
I'm down, gamertag Bl00dyMaria. Character is at 109, I think.
---
I'll do it just for the xp farm haha. I love to do it solo
---
I've played every Meat Week to date and I've never really had a problem with spoilage. I guess it can't hurt though.
---
And this is why I hate online games. Developers just can't help but screw with everything. Not all of us go around one shotting everything. Let me give you a different perspective. They changed the player retention mechanism from do x, y and z for Atoms to a daily XP grind. So many of us are rocking bloodied unyielding just for that Legendary Chore. We're not doing it to measure the size of our e-penis. With the nerf to bloodied (I know it's a nerf across the board), it just means more farming for ammo, the one relief bloodied gave from the make-everything-a-chore game BGS Austin seems to love to make. And when Legendary Perks arrive, guess what most people will pick? Damage buffs. And boy won't it be just fun grinding all of those legendary perk points to make up for exactly what they're taking away with this damage nerf bullshit?
---
Sometimes, I'll take a break from farming xp and use my food build to blast away a level 30. Then I write "eat shit" in neon letters as they try to damage me in vain for their fusion core processor back.
---
If they tribute me 1 soot flower or some dumb junk items, I drop them about 30 100% fusion cores and bobbleheads and sprint off into the sunset.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
Exactly while im stuck with a minigun. 1000 bullets is one lb without perks.
---
I have the opposite problem, everyone shows up!... but only for the XP from the ghouls, so no one does the objective - I wouldn't mind if wasn't actually impossible to get 100 ore myself while they farmed their score.
---
I'm hoping once the legendary run is over people may revert to at least attempting to do the event, but alas, i figure it'll become a ghost town.
---
Then don't be demanding some pvp improvement. If you want to pvp that bad, as I said get a community and pvp there. You did mention you play on PC, you know situation is shit here but you keep demanding changes cause your main platform is ps4 and pc users can get fucked. Wow. Just wow
---
I will add you, my GT is Black Cringe.
---
It's a market manipulation tactic, hence why it's illegal in several countries. I'd say it's bad enough with actual physical goods, but when you're just selling digital assets, man...
---
I just got my hands on a IE Gatling gun. Primed it. Full bloodied/explosive build. With glow sight... just the explosion from shooting NEXT to molemen in Uranium Fever does 300 damage. Actually hitting them is like 1300 from the bullet and 300 from the explosion.
---
My daily driver is a B25 with a speedy receiver though. The fire rate on that one is a perfect sweet spot. But with daily ops replenishing ammo? And 5mm apparently being tuned for the minigun? Man... I may get all the 5mm Ultra I need from Ops.
---
You can already see some of the rewards in the build menu like the colossus taxidermy, plush or skin rug
---
This. I would love event wide mob loot in a quest. "Your teammate has picked up [item] and shared with you." Sure, after some quests you'll wind up with a bunch of junk to clear out, but it'd allow lower level folks to feel like they're helping out on higher level events. Or even just ensure the loot is available from a creature to the whole team.
---
My game disconnected me mid sbq quest, I *know* I hit the 3 star queen several times, but when I spawned back in, Bethesda had nothing for me from her üôÅ
---
I admire your optimism.  This is the same team that can‚Äôt manage shared account storage or a basic text chat.
---
Skyrim also had amazing bows with a fantastic combat system built around them.  The bow in this game isn‚Äôt even on the same plane of existence as Skyrim‚Äôs.  It has to be the worst bow in video game history, or close to it.
---
Griefer gang here to take your 20 cloth and 12 leather.
---
Oh, I'm not holding the players blame-free. The proportion of players willing to be a pylon conduct is atrociously small. On the other hand, simply blaming people is cheap; doing so while ignoring the influence of the environment in which they're acting is both lazy and ultimately dishonest.
---
For one thing, bloodied builds - which seem to be the majority of end-game players - are really, really not suited for pylon duty and even if you heal all your rad damage before the event starts, there's no easy way to rad back up there unless you brought a sufficient supply of Toxic Goo with you.
---
Also, as OP wrote - the game does not reward the person for doing the right but inconvenient thing of becoming a pylon conduct. And I have a vague notion that even if we're talking Bethesda here, changing the incentive structure of this event might be slightly easier than changing Western culturalization to the point were significantly more people are willing to go out of their way to inconvenience themselves for the common good.
---
Hope he get better soon op.
---
It's not visible lag like stuttering or the like, but subtle and purely on the part of the server.  I believe it is fairly well acknowledged that the magic glitch is due to the server not being able to keep up with more complex damage calculations in real time, so it ends up being wierd.
---
Typically, I need to shoot the target and bear in for a second or two to start the effect, but with a small amount of latency, I've seen this wind up period be ignored, and even seen weapons that are much too slow to proc the effect, fire rate of around 120, proc the effect a small amount. 
---
Also note that I'm on pc, so we dont have the incredible lag that I've seen reported on consoles before.  Lag seems more subjective here.
---
Wanna bet?
---
What re talking about? Why should they do that? Im using assassins gear all the time!
---
Just because the stuff is useless for a foodbuild like u doesnt mean its obsolet. 
---
How about removing foodbuild perks like good with salt and through hiker? How do u feel about that.
---
My problem is that too many show up and I can't tag those ghouls
---
The damage rebalancing means your damage output is going to be a lot closer to Bloodied than it used to be, FYI. 
---
And I‚Äôm not positive on this, but it FEELS like the wendingo just respawn if you kill them. Like you can never actually clear them.
---
event is not hard.
---
a) Because the lag is ridiculous currently. As soon as the 1st bit of ore is deposited, it is unplayable. We were 6 yesterday, and event failed due to lag.
---
b) people just want to kill ghouls, so those that want to ptfo are out of luck. a proper 4/4 completion doesn't happen anymore.  So no chance at rad barrel plan.
---
c) a lot of players just suck. they will camp tunnel entrances and kill everything. no chance for others. While 1 other is running around collecting ore, which is not enough.
---
This.
---
 I really run a stealth crossbow build. When Adrenaline broke, that was that. Unviable build. The crossbow loads so slow you need to be able to one shot in a crowd of super mutants. Anything breaking stealth and you're in trouble. VATS is buggy and often you hit see 800 damage, but no damage inflicted. An immediate one shot after will preserve stealth, if not run and hide, come back. Requiring multiple shots is a death sentence.
---
Yeah sure. What you got?
---
Isn't that a sign that you truly won? Take your win in whatever form it takes.
---
Yup, not as powerful (60% vs 90%) but still significant
---
Enough Quantum to brick your carry weight.
---
In a couple months your assassin garbage weapons will be almost as effective as the top tier bloody, junkie or whatever weapon.  It won‚Äôt really matter anymore.
---
About 20!
---
Doubt there would be much outrage it's not heavily played.
---
I wonder if the new damage calculations is an effort to stop the magic effect, although I've heard magic still works on pts.
---
Doesn't matter if I won. My problem is that they are using exploits to crash servers.
---
I'm normally at 450 of 501 but regularly max out.
---
Contemporary House
---
Communal Fire pit
---
If this was the case. The best way to farm coins would be to create a new character, get to level 10, scrap every perk and then repeat
---
I tried it once with some random dude in the 200s level. I was so where in the 30s level. I died about 378 times. Now I‚Äôm level 106 and I still don‚Äôt have the right build/setup/weaponry as a filthy casual. Otherwise, I‚Äôd hit that up every time I was on. At some point, I‚Äôll try to figure out the dynamics.
---
2019 called, they want their bugs unpatched.
---
Replaying through Dark Souls 1 to respec is easier than changing your build in F76.
---
The ultracite 2mm I had was for a gauss minigun, I don‚Äôt feel like 1500 is a large number for a minigun
---
I don't think this is correct. I came back after Wastelanders and got the Prototype suit from a mission rather early on with my alt.
---
It's not that complicated.  For example if there are 3 bonuses before it was weapon damage * (bonus a * bonus b * bonus c) now its weapon damage * (bonus a+bonus b+bonus c)
---
The change from multiplying the bonuses to adding them reduces the final number substantially.
---
I see, it's not pro for the players, it's pro for beth.  I suppose that makes some sense, but can't say it's a good way to run things.
---
That won't save you no more. Thinking quantums will save your sorry ass is so 2019. Maybe you will survive in console cause you aren't getting one shotted there
---
Oh man.  You‚Äôre going to love patch 22.  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to give away crossbows and bows.
---
You haven‚Äôt been around FO76 much....
---
There‚Äôs a million ‚Äúeasy fixes‚Äù that we all know about and have been reported and discussed numerous. Most of them remain unfixed. But hey! Sometimes someone does randomly fix them! But I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs more because a dev actually encountered it while playing themselves and fixed it. 
---
Like the Heavy Barrel for the AutoGrenade. It‚Äôs never added the bonus damage that the tooltip says it does. Been that way since launch. Never gets mentioned on forums either.
---
But guess what? That‚Äôs fixed on PTS. I‚Äôll bet cash that a dev ran across it while playing.
---
I've heard the same, and it could be an effort to at least reduce it.  I'm personally not looking forward to the new calculations.
---
I'm withholding judgment until I see the final effects, but it looks at this time like I'm going to be losing around 40 percent of my damage output from the majority of my weapons.  Assuming my math is correct.
---
Perhaps my TSE gatling plasma will see more use then.
---
No.  More time is not more challenge.  The challenge is the same.  The risk they pose gas not changed, and nothing in this game is particularly dangerous or anything but straight forward attacking.
---
It is for a similar reason that I wear the Bog outfit, because it makes me look like an actual Raider/Wastelander.
---
Not so much optimism, just giving them the benefit of the doubt. As for the bows, never used them so can't speak in regards to them.
---
The Scorched body parts in jars.
---
Yeah seems your most recent pvp experience was in 2019
---
I know that.  That's how I thought it worked.  Your first formula doesn't need parentheses, though.
---
I‚Äôm level 106. Once I finish renovating my house, I‚Äôll be on more during the day. GT: Mr Grumpypantz
---
Wasn't sure about your conduct.... Then I saw you're a raider. Checks out.
---
Yeah, idk.  I'm so over the game, tbh.  I might just stop playing after the run.  It's just so boring.
---
neither. get an automatic rifle.
---
Damn and I was thinking of making a bloodied unarmed once one wasteland hit haha.oh well my mains a junkies heavys and sounds like hell still be doing great
---
You are upset that you didnt do any dmg to mob so you didnt get totally bias unworthed rng loot from it ...
---
The biggest reward is from quest itself, dont be mad you will get it next time carry on and btw its not the bethesda fault rules are simple shooty shooty boss you get goodies no shooty shooty no bos mob reward. Conduits are crucial but that doesnt mean you should focus only on it if you didnt had strong teammates you will fail with that strategy.
---
Dont understimate people greed if they would allow all participiants to get loot there is sure someone who will start abusing it, thats why they made minimal contribution eveeything is related to queen minions crisis
---
Yeah it has a 30rd mag, other rifles only have 20. If it got a silencer.... oh man.
---
You do know you can select specific perks outside of perk packs right?
---
Do you remember where you got it?
---
10mm SMG shreds close range with a bigger mag it barely does less than the handmade
---
Ooo I didn‚Äôt know about this? I‚Äôll have a look into it!
---
Yep and i can not confirm but I have heard a lot of people saying they added a damage cap so you can not one shot, and yes stealth is a lot less then what it was but what is hit the most is melee never use it myself but a bloodied death claw gauntlet goes from 1400 damage to 400 seems like a bit much to me I mean a 1000 damage reduction holy crap.
---
My point is that things are supposed to be a challenge, rather than a waste. Who wants to spend 15 minutes killing a boss AND wasting 6k or way more high value ammo along with multiple other people? I'm fine with the boss taking time, but taking time and tons of resources for little to no gain isn't very enjoyable.
---
I forget where I got mine. But, I hate that damn siren.
---
Well yeah, that's the kicker. Having all that additional space costs $15 a month.
---
Edit; Not to mention it does a couple of psychological things to you by doing it. You break the barrier, are given a very lucrative reward in terms of atoms, the service, and items. But even more so, but having those atoms, you will spend them in their store on items, making that process something you've already committed too, and making you more likely to spend more money in the future, if not on Fallout 1st, then on atoms.
---
To me it kinda makes sense, with the same button press and the AP usage, could well be a modified power attack with a different animation, would take up fewer resources and dev time that way.
---
Sounds good, I will add you. GT is Black Cringe.
---
One shotting some)( not everything) is something I had to work my ass out to achieve, also its a high risk high reward with lower hp, I don't really see how make enemies even more spongey is going to make things more fun, specially because it's such a grind to get keep a good stock of bullets. 
---
If enemies didn't feel so "robotic" and ignored bullets so much except for criticals it wouldn't be so bad to get less damage, but as the game is right now it's really frustating how you get the best armor and best weapon and still agains 2 or 3 high level enemies you'll get your health drained to 0 in no time.
---
Define "best". Most damage will still be bloodied.
---
Can I have your lead and cool outfits? Xbox One!
---
That's where I'm at.  Imma finish the run, maybe stick around to finish up a few things, and finish out scripping my trash pile, so that if I do come back, I'll have some stock pile.
---
But I think its time for another break.  I took almost a year off between last summer and this summer.  Came back a week or two before wastelanders.  Before that I played a few months then.
---
Maybe I'll finally finish dark souls ii.  I've been sitting outside the throne of want long enough.  Just haven't had the drive.
---
Excellent. I just fixed my mic, too.
---
Just found out Robert Trump was on the board at bethesda..........if that tells you anything..if it doesnt bethesda was/is being managed like America ...taken for everything it's got and managed into the ground.
---
Looking at the lagfest that is rad rumble and line in the sand currently, I am concerned servers are not capable moving forward.
---
It's super easy to collect 100 ore now especially if you're done with the run./don't need the XP. Psychobuff was recently "enhanced"(it's very well documented so no need to try to keep it a secret from Bethesda) so that if under it's influence you go down to low HP but can't die from rads alone but once it wears off you insta die, as a Junkie's build with duration boosts that means I can take one and have 8 minutes to to collect ore &amp; then stash my stuff... so essentially I can win the event using a broken method in hopes of getting a bugged hazmat suit
---
Sell me on the gauss shotgun, please. I haven't got one yet, but the combat shotgun can already kill in one shot - and the gauss shotgun does the same thing - except it has a charge up time beforehand and a buggy tendency to miss shots in VATS? How is this an upgrade?
---
If you remove all of those whats your inventory minimum at? Is it higher than the maximum?
---
I think score is a little different currency since their will be on going new seasons with new rewards. And all score wiped in between them. The thing with bullion and rep is that it has an end goal and then with reputation a hard stop. Bullion has limited plans and enventually you will reach a point you dont want anything unless they continue to add plans. Thats more similar to how perk coins will work except it will take a long time to get six upgraded cards.
---
 Scipt is never ending valuable currency, basically a lottery ticket for turning in bad legendaries. Overseer coins have an end goal and only exist to make rng not so annoying in nuclear winter,
---
I kinda like how its compartimized in that way.
---
If p22 goes out largely unchanged, bloody is pretty much finished.  Stealth builds might stay at low health for the unyielding stats, but antiarmor performs on almost the same level now.  Strength no longer stacks the same for melee, so it‚Äôs not worth being low health anymore.  If you ever see anyone that‚Äôs not full auto after p22, it‚Äôll be a flavor build, roleplayer or someone like that.
---
I mean the game is just... empty.  Excited to play around in Factorio now that 1.0 is out.
---
Hey being a casual is ok
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda are sorry that you feel like you need to unsubscribe from a sub to not be reminded of our award winning MMORPG Fallout 76. While we understand that many in the fallout community are upset at the recent changes to their beloved fallout experience, we are in fact streamlining the experience to ensure greater investor satisfaction of our finished products. This is Todd Howard signing out and I hope to see you in the Atomic Wastelands^(tm) soon.
---
I wouldn't mind if I need to use more ammo and meds, I do mind that I can't stock up these things because of ridiculous stash limitations. Either make the stash like 2k or extend the perks effects on the stash as well.
---
Or add stash limit extender to the atomshop (the promise of profit might actually make Bethesda to consider solving this issue).
---
Thought I heard something about that.  Might have to take a look.  Thanks for reminding me.
---
My problem is no one shows up lmao. I‚Äôll grind the ore myself if I have to I just need someone protecting the scientist you know.
---
Let me know whenever you're down to play.
---
Yeah I just was writing a bunch of challenges and the numbers for what I needed to complete them down the other day and that challenge the only one I didn't have was the SBQ and I've killed her plenty of times.
---
Also I have two daily quests that I've done before that weren't counted which were mistaken identity, which doesn't show up for me daily anymore and I think the one with the Nanny bot near Harpers Ferry
---
Yeah my main is lvl 360 junkies pa heavy, then I've got a b stealth commando who's lvl 105 (was my nw toon but I hit 100 in that) mainly play him just to level up for the daily haha
---
Hopefully my mic still works, hasn't been used in a minute.
---
just make them only count AFTER level 50. easy fix.
---
even if they did, they would still have to do this again and again. still a massive grind.
---
76 is placed at the bottom of the list because it is indeed the absolute worst "fallout" game ever. This just isnt a fallout game at all, the fundamentals arent even there whatsoever. The weapons mostly suck balls, most of them being weak af and theres barely any variety. Buggy mess with awful corporate monetisation methods. The writing for wastelanders is piss poor and theres only a handful of memorable npcs in the game(overseer,biv etc) I could honestly go on forever about how inferior this game is to fnv and f3 but i cba. This game is fun but its in no way a fallour game at all, i play it as its own experience, separated from the rest of the fallout series.
---
Bosses are supposed to be hard and challenging, nto boring bullet sponges with petty rewards
---
Oh well didn't know that.
---
So we'll probs see you on the weekend?
---
I heard, validating the files through the launcher works?
---
I ended up uninstalling the game &amp; reinstalling it, which fixed that error for me :)
---
I can't recommend buying it, tbh.  It takes a really specific demeanor to like it.  If you like it, you'll love it, but it's not made for everyone.  There's a free demo though, so try that If you're interested.
---
Answer me this then - what was the criticism in your own expert opinion? Walk me through it. Help me understand.
---
My inferior understanding is the poster did not like that the souce being provided was a video on YouTube from a YouTuber he or she had never heard of rather than an official source. Thats completly fair and I am the same at times.
---
Upon clicking on the video and seeing how long it was the poster may have thought "not another one of these videos" and did not proceed further. This is also fair enough and I would not blame anyone for taking that approach.
---
Had the poster watched it, it would have been immediatly obvious that rather than drag a 20 second news story out over the course of 12 - 13 minutes, I actually covered it right in the opening.  
---
This is something I simply wanted to correct for anyone else that might happen upon the link. Its what us small youtubers do from time to time. 
---
Now I have some sort of youtube expert replying to me telling me how I need to work on taking criticism (another first for me, quite a big day).
---
So being the expert that you clearly are (and not someone who has yet to even grasp what is going on in the thread), id love for you to walk me through how exactly do you feel I should take the criticism i received from the postrr onboard in this case. 
---
Or...perhaps instead of worrying about me, you might instead make a point to not comment on threads you clearly have no grasp on? 
---
Just a thought!
---
You have to wait like 45 minutes between the first Primal Cuts of the hour and the cookout.  Nothing will spoil in that time.  You can only deposit a max of five meat per cookout, so there‚Äôs no point in saving them.  Unless you skip the cookout, I can‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd need to avoid spoilage.
---
Don't ask for only 1 or 2 specific thing. All limit is an issue so all limit should be removed, spam that pls.
---
A rank 3 lock will make ther bounty higher.
---
Exactly, melee is already hard because how much enemies ignore your dmg resistance, and how they don't react to most dmg, stunting you non-stop while you are landing hard blows. Now melee mains, specially two handed, are getting thrown aside. They expect all melee mains to either give up and start grinding endlessly for bullets or do some bs setup with faster and much weaker melee weps..
---
same lol, 76 couldnt lick NV or fo1/2/3 boots.
---
Meat sweats, but I don‚Äôt remember what it did.  It wasn‚Äôt anything amazing.
---
Glad it‚Äôs just not me.  I thought my quad Tesla broke the game lmao,  I had to put it away or me and my buddy were going to crash. Even then the lag was unbearable and we failed.  Hard to shoot all the enemies when half of them lag right past you.
---
I just got off but I'll figure let you know tomorrow. This has been a thorn in my side for a long time. I can't die doing any event otherwise I'll have to leave it. It happens 100% of the time. Need it fixed for these updates!
---
When I jump on tomorrow I'm going to get rid of all of the weight mods and let you know. Thanks for the help.
---
I think they should grandfather in a bunch of perk coins based on the level of current characters. to make up for lost perks from perk packs.
---
But other than that, I don't mind having to scrap some cards, as I don't use them all, and do have duplicates, but would like another  way to earn, that isn't scrapping them.
---
I'm that demeanor.  Trust me.
---
I've played a bunch of games like it.  And even made games not like it into it.  I may turn off the aliens occasionally just to make an empire without threat, but it's a game style I enjoy.
---
I only played a little of it before and stopped short for some reason I dont adequately recall.  I think I hit about 50 hours at that time.
---
I wanted that and was ready to grind like that.
---
Levelling my 680 character is not a grind, it's a punishment for sticking for so long.
---
I personally would like my own miniature ICBM missile silo for my camp. the bombs that it drops would be essentially the same as that of the orbital strike grenades and can be used basically anywhere on the map except for indoors.
---
Outcasts were outcast from Maxson's BoS. So no.
---
The caps serve a purpose but its not about duping.  Its about getting daily logins.  Dupijg has never factored into that equation.
---
I don't know. I don't exactly think corporate is dumb in this case. They simply have very different objectives then you do. And we as a community aren't privileged to the data they have regarding this project. I don't necessarily think that the reputation hit from this is something they're very concerned about either. Because there's a couple of facets to it, with this IP in particular they don't plan to release another fallout game for probably 7-10 years. With this being an online service and the numbers they saw following the wastelanders update, I think they have a gameplan going into the next generation for this game in particular.
---
The next IP they're releasing is brand new, and something which a lot of people are interested to see. If you notice, they've been really close-lipped about it, which is, I believe, to be able to drum up as much hype as possible. If that project is successful, different, and a single-player experience not riddled with the microtransactions of this game- well, hell, it will probably boost their reputation again. All the while they leech money with fallout 76 from the people who are dedicated to the game, patching in fixes because they're sticking around and buying things, then you can re-release this game, fixed to the next generation with another 'big update' and see a surge in players, and presumably at that point after having 2-3 years of continuous development and player feeedback, they'll be reselling a much better game.
---
Same. I guess what I might have to do is to switch to commando since it uses similar SPECIAL points. But that means dedicated another 12 perk cards or so... but with the legendary system on the way.....
---
Welp
---
Guess my plans to play tomorrow are canceled 
---
I'll hop back on when meat week starts i guess and then try out colossal problem when it comes out. 
---
Have fun PC players, good luck :)
---
fucking stop
---
It was never funny.
---
Lvl 40. 
---
If it was 50, it'd be more popular. 
---
Also, they could introduce a mechanic that enables corpse-looting if you deposit ore.
---
I'd still go low health just for the fact that you get way more stats (most importantly XP) from a full unyielding set compared to everyone else. My char is specced as a heavy gunner but with that SPECIAL setup I can easily flip around between heavy gunner, shotgunner or melee (and have bloodied and junkies weapons for all those categories).
---
It's so great, tbh.  I don't really like the aliens.  They will be assimilated.  Resistance is futile.
---
Peoblem is that my build is all over the place but mainly meele, so my guns do absolutely no damage and the assaultrons one shot me with their laser
---
Such a pain, hoping they buff us a bit. The legendary sneak card follow through might help us out.
---
Commando is still good.  Rifleman is a little behind on live, but it‚Äôs pretty shit on the PTS.  Hunting rifles and other sniper rifles can‚Äôt reliably kill with a headshot vs standard high lvl mobs anymore, especially at distance.  This, there‚Äôs no point to them.  Rate of fire at close to medium range is the undisputed king.
---
I've heard the term "food build" several times here, and have no idea what it means. Can you elaborate?
---
My junky 2 handed melee felt the same. 
---
My junky commando felt a tad weaker, like 1 extra headshot or 2-5 more body shots depending on the enemy.  I could probably make up the difference by speccing more into damage.
---
Then its a one and done thing with nothing to work to so soon would be forgotten content. They want people to play more and be engaged.
---
Exactly. I've seen plenty of tanky builds put 10 shots into a legendary and kill it before anyone can get there too. It's not just bloodied builds.
---
Delays are great if that means that they've detected issues and don't make the hotfixes creste more bugs... right? Oh wait
---
Soon it will all be clean.
---
Anyhow, nice talking to ya.  I gotta sign off now, it's almost 3 am here, and I have to wake up in 4 or 5 hours.
---
Good luck in your future endeavors.
---
Yeah, this is pretty annoying all things considered. Why even tell us specific dates? They hardly ever hit them. I've been taking a break for a few days, but now I guess I'll extend that break a few days longer until Meat Week starts.
---
I used to use the app on my iPhone to chat. Now I have my mic with my turtle beach x42.
---
Nothing.  They will never remove this limit.
---
I felt this pain physically.
---
Thanks, you too, and good night.
---
It has been since fallout 3 for players once they are established. Most of fallouts 3 unique weapons were behind master locks and master hacking.
---
I got an assassin/sentinal secret service armor piece on my first roll. That (if tradable) would have been god tier last year. I'm still holding on to it just in case.
---
Well you can get an outcast pa skin from nw
---
How many types of crossbows and bows are there in the game?
---
Three. Two of them were added with the release of Westlanders.
---
How many types of pistols are there in the game? If we include all pistols here in general - 12 types (two lasers, plasma, alien blaster, gamma, 308, 45 and 38 pipes, 44 and western revolvers, 10mm and black powder). You can literally use 3-4 of them (10mm, 45 pipe and plasma, maybe 38 pipe too), and, no matter how hard you try, the pistol assembly will be inferior to even the most lousy carbine.
---
Crossbows and bows were originally created for fun and roleplay. No one in their right mind was going to create an archery build, but pistols now, if they have the skill, are quite playable and can even to some extent compete with carbines. But the release of the damage nerf will reduce the pistol assembly to the archery level, and somehow I don't really want that.
---
Damn it, I just feel sorry for the level 400+ character I've been working on for so long! I spent a year and a half polishing the build and now Bethesda is trying to turn it into a slag!
---
Wow is this for looting junk? Dam lunatics
---
Has a couple meanings lol
---
You don‚Äôt have the same xp gains from high int anymore.  There‚Äôs some, of course, but gaining 4 int from brain fungus soup no longer gives an appreciable bonus like it does on the live game.  You might notice it off a lvl 100 scorchbeast, but that‚Äôs after you sank 2000 rounds into it and it finally dies.
---
Doesn't the game ask you? Have no idea how you ended up dropping it
---
Get a combat or pump action shotgun with low damage. Explosive would be good, though. Equip the Enforcer perk. Cripple the ghouls where the turrets and Scavengers can't see and kill them. Collect your ore in peace while no new ghouls spawn.
---
Problem is, there is not enough ore to get to the 4th reward tier when playing solo, and even the 3rd tier (75 ore) requires almost two full runs through the tunnel, which is some pretty tight timing.
---
No offense but I actually like the skin mechanism because I won't sell my weapons to the vendor or drop it accidentally.
---
at least one less duped legacy weapon in the game - im sorry for you
---
100% Agreed, it's criminal and downright baffling that they haven't taken advantage of the styles tab. Lets get some more rewards on the sucker and get it to the top of the subreddit. =D
---
I thought as much. Just wondered if that was only group as it's been spoke about that there was loads of bos factions around America.
---
Ahahahhahahah dude grow the fuck up. Holy shit, you wrote an essay that I'm totally not gonna read. I just thought it was hysterical how thin skin you've got. What are you 12?
---
Not auto pistols though, tank killer works with pistols now in the pts
---
Unarmed seems broken on pts, 1h and 2h doing fine overall, compared to unarmed, they forgot to tweak it somehow
---
They already have a dual-wielding mechanic - just use the code from Skyrim! Flip the animation for the left hand, set the limit with the same pistols for dual wielding - that's it!
---
Yes, it will take some work, but damn, it's worth it! In this case, players will receive a whole set of high-end content builds. Now, if you want to be top - only commando and machine gun are used .. With the introduction of dual wielding , pistol builds will appear and, possibly, melee.
---
And yet that's clearly not your intention at all, who you trying to fool ?
---
I needed this in my life right now. Thank you.
---
I‚Äôve seen a view vendor bots in the train stations with them.
---
They'll probably 'apologize' by adding days to it considering all the outrage lately. That's my guess based on recent behaviour. Like they did with Fasnacht.
---
The disco one seems fit in the greenhouse dome
---
Auto pistol is weak too, I test it. Any commando build is most OP
---
If you have the future Tec camp skin. It is bugged 
---
If you un-equip it and move your camp just a tad it will fix it and show your camp on the map
---
They giving tank killer perk to pistols finaly
---
Um these can be done in like 30mins, most of them ticking the weeklies off too. 
---
I missed like two weeks, don't do NW, had a newborn and was deemed 'vital' during COVID and never got one day off. I'd say I qualify too as being fairly busy irl. 
---
Im in line with Zorbo and on track. I also don't give a fuck about Michelin man power armor and a dopey ass fireplace. I enjoy the game and even little man bops in his carrier to Atom Bomb Baby.
---
It's a fuckin pisser to bowl these SCORE over and we all know it. People just want everything now.
---
It was never meant be funny. It was a very heartwarming moment.
---
Doesn't make a difference, next dupe everything will be multiplied again and again
---
Well, I was going to just write this post to apologize, but after seeing the other response you got, Yikes to that guy.
---
You are 100% right, I was too quick to judge. I won't make excuses, I was wrong. Sorry. For whatever that's worth.
---
That other dude needs to chill though, jeez.
---
&gt;Unarmed Bloodied depends heavily on abusing the current system to generate super high damage, so it gets hit hardest.
---
It's almost like the name implies the trade off for such damage might be the "small" inconvenience of having to be in cigarette lighting distance of the enemy. Why the hell would anyone opt for 500 damage melee hits when I could do the same shit crouched from 5 miles away?
---
What took me 60 seconds to write is being classed as an essay - another first for me. 
---
But yea, that was pretty much the type of reply I (and I imagine anyone following this) was expecting from you.
---
IIRC, it's 1:666 (yes, really), i.e. about 0.15%
---
you cant place foundations inside building spaces like ie the train car and i want to add the half plots on the ground not the full square plots
---
I want to be able to kill todd in game thousand of times lol
---
I read it the first time.
---
As a pvper, I endorse this comment.
---
You tested on the pts? With all perk cards and tank killer?
---
I agree. We survived TS nerf, we survived explosive nerfs, we will survive this also. NON legendary fixer need 3 bullet to kill 75 supermutant with proper build, how is it bullet sponge? To much fuking crybabies and drama queens around
---
Ah no worries - as I said its completly understandable where you were coming from.
---
What other guy??? üò¨
---
Well, seeing as you're getting the downvotes, other people seem to think you're as much of a clown as you sound my dude. Enjoy the life you live. I'm positive your youtube career will kick off soon.
---
I don‚Äôt believe this makes the server lags. I joined a server once with a queen in it and right next to the queen the guy had a ammo factory, more then what you are showing next to it and was giving out free ammo during queen the server didn‚Äôt lag once
---
Wait what? They changed XP calculations as well? I thought it was only outgoing damage output?
---
I found the environments to be amazing. I actually did the entirety of the story in private server over a few weeks as I wanted to maintain the feeling of an abandoned Appalachia.
---
Once I was ready I joined public and the game play became so much better. Nowadays I barely use private as you miss out on so much more with fights and events.
---
So yeah, story and atmosphere got me here, community and events made me stay.
---
Leave Assassins alone pve'er. You can remove Assassin weapons but the armor stays, still plenty of people who pvp. Even more recently, as weird as that sounds. People are starting to fight back lol.
---
You‚Äôd be amazed, or not, at how little is changed from PTS day one to the live game.  Maybe a handful of bugs get fixed, but otherwise pretty much all legitimate player concerns and suggestions for improvement are ignored.  Technical issues are addressed, kinda, but the decisions for the content are basically set in stone.
---
Legendary perks are the only exception, and all they had to do there was add a couple QoL perks to distract player from the fact that all the other perks are still pretty lame.
---
I hope you reported the exploiter.
---
But watch them turn up to line in the sand now that they worked out how to cheat. If only you could blow up peoples tents. That event is a total waste of time now.
---
If your on xbox I'm always up for events  - gt aussiex01 &amp; I have level 130, 260 &amp; 480 characters
---
The other dude that responded to the post. I don't think I can say their names as per the rules.
---
I mean this sucks and all but it says right there in the warning "will destroy this item" it doesn't say "will remove the skin"
---
I don't know how it could be any more clear.
---
I disagree. I counted \~167 machines here and every time this guy added more everyone got Connecting to Server issues
---
They're good changes, but it really needs to be accompanied by (or followed very quickly by) a balance pass on all weapons, perks etc. Removing the crazy scaling that there is currently should give them a lot more freedom in that regard.
---
Yep. Pistols is fully trash on PTS. Semiauto 10mm from sneak kills 100 lvl supermutant with 4-5 headshots. Assault rifle, fully auto - 3-4 shots. But 10mm have 43 fire rate and 18 ammo, assault - 75 fire rate and 30 ammo
---
Pistols unplayable. You can kills ghouls in Whitespring, but you cant go to SBQ fight or daily ops
---
My main character is gunslinger, 402 lvl.
---
I did. Its the same guy who had millions of Fusion cell ammo that I posted about and everyone thought was just a visual bug.
---
All teddy bears including stuffed, teddy bear, pristine bear that all look kinda same. Restored desk fan, super mutants head, ghoul head, sea captains cap, enclave officer cap, clean space helmet, all 8 rare nuka colas, nuka souvenir's i.e clean nuka truck, car, cup and mug  and loads of other rares so people can spawn in and run about doing confused emoji because vendor is in cave below museum . Thumbs up to all those who appreciate the effort of museum bases which many have üòÇ edit: all 11 mr.fuzzy bears, clean abraxo. Lighthouse souvenir, clean salt and pepper shakers, clean oven mitt.
---
And sure enough you go and mention downvotes as a justification. I had expected that a little earlier from you to be honest, but you got there in the end. Well done you.
---
Had also expected you to resort to this once you realised you were wrong and boy oh boy you did not disappoint there either üòâ 
---
So to sum up the thread in one word for anyone reading -
---
Confusing 
---
Reddit is fun üòÄ
---
This is not enough. The damage of pistols has become so small that it is simply unrealistic to kill at least some powerful enemy with them.
---
This is an epic idea, however you can't one shot anyone who knows how to actually pvp. Unless they are a super low level. Nevertheless it's a great idea.
---
Degenerates like you should be crucified
---
Ah - just some kid blowing off some steam - he is all steamed out now though and off for nap time so we all good now üòÉüëç
---
This is my thought as well. It's definitely my first legendary perk.
---
Lol I just thought it was funny how thin skin he had. Didn't like how you painted him so he really had to comment on it. Dude gotta send 50 messages and start typing essays in response to a reddit comment. That's thin skinned if I've ever seen it. I've never seen a content creator come comment on people's comments about them. Thats what I said. Dude turned it into a shit show.
---
Try standing on top of the blue computer console to the opposite side of the decontamination arches. Ghouls can't get to you and you'll have a view of the centre and a bit of both sides
---
Wrong post buddy, too bad you don't get it
---
They are end game bosses. What do you expect?
---
A one minute battle?
---
Grab a magic weapon then.
---
I did the same thing my dude and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs others out there that have too don‚Äôt sweat it :)
---
Yesterday I kicked everyone out of the team. Three Times! And I did not do anything active. No clue why this happened. I am sorry for all those I kicked out...
---
Bro, they possibly could have used Skyrim‚Äôs code for bows, at least as a basis, but they didn‚Äôt.  Instead we have a bow that doesn‚Äôt let the user aim through the sight, they hold it in the wrong hand, arrows get stopped by grass and vats doesn‚Äôt really work.
---
I would not hold my breath for dual wielding, or expect pistols to somehow go from the hot steaming trash they are with the new damage calculations to something reasonably good by introducing two at once.  They need a whole rework from the ground up.
---
What are those?
---
Well if you think about it dupers A. Can dupe whatever they want so turning in scrip is useless and B. You can't drop treasury notes so unless there was some glitch to get a ton of wouldn't be dupeable. Put dupers and cheaters together in one server like cod and let us WHO PAID MONEY play the game
---
It also has the worst recoil ever and drains AP like no tomorrow if you plan to use VATS
---
I‚Äôd rather use a self crafted standard fixer than the best 10mm SMG
---
Meh the recoil isn‚Äôt anything up close with good mods and you know how to control it. And nah I don‚Äôt use AP much but I usually one shot stuff with it when I do. It honestly does better for bosses then my same effect handmade does just cuz of the 10 extra bullets
---
this kinda overdone drama is exactly perfect for this sub
---
"20 TIMES IN A ROW A LEGENDARY CORPSE HAS FALLEN THROUGH THE GROUND! YOU'RE A GIANT PIECE OF SHIT BETH I HATE YOU I HATE YOU"
---
Xbox if you need faschnaut masks I have most common uncommon as well.didnt get lucky with the rare ones
---
The find a bobblehead one took a few hours i looked and looked could not find a single one in all the spots i know even looking online for other spots could not find one. Now and then legandary enemys can be a pain in the arse when events do not want to pop and you have to go find them out in the world. Its not common and likely not a problem as you now only need to find 1.
---
In theory there could be, but it wouldn't be the outcasts you'd know from fo 3 since that's the future iirc. 
---
If they were in fo76 they'd be just guys who mutinied. Honestly I hope there ends up being 2 BoS factions in fo76, one Maxon chapter and another one with opposing views. Then we'd get to choose a side and shoot the other xd
---
Edit: and oh the cherry would be if BoS roamed around in vertibirds ala fo4, shooting and dropping a trooper here and there, and just random encounters of BoS fighting in the bog and mire.
---
Actually you can. The only issue is the you cant blueprint it and place it again. Destroy the train car with a flamethrower and then its just a ghost that you can place walls roofs and foundations anywhere you want. Mind you walls dont work well with it except coving the back. The windows are impossible to line up so no wallpapering the inside unless you want to cover the windows. After you done repair the train car and its ready to go. Its almost exactly one foundation wide inside.
---
I actually love double xp weekends, servers seem fuller, add in a couple of events and it makes for a good old party.
---
And now all you get is a few Rounds of ammo, canned dog food and a radaway. If you're extremely lucky you might get a plan
---
Yay, now pls make it possible to craft legendary Fixers the same way Bethesda!
---
Mine dies the same thing, every single time I die.  Guess the colossus event is out for me....
---
How/where do you find those?
---
It would be cool if there was a nuke event there too. Like maybe if you nuke the island it creates a high level boss deathclaw event like the queen.
---
Happy cake day! 
---
Ah i see. So legacies retain their value against sbq but non legacies do not. Good to know. Would explain my own observations.
---
Vendors reset 20 hours from last use.
---
Build a Brahmin shelter
---
We can't let this overtake us! There has to be an explanation. I'm beginning to think weight is it. I even use weight increase on my backpack.
---
Jesus you‚Äôve grinded a lot huh im level 278 with 841 hours played üòÇ
---
Yep, i've had it a few times... its a pain in the ass lol
---
You should have a massive stack of perk cards that you could scrap anyway
---
Ah that‚Äôs smart asf
---
Yep over 3000 hours
---
Ammo factory's
---
I do feel like I'm repairing my weapons a lot, I'm still getting more repair kits than I use tho. My power armor on the other hand, I usually only have to repair maybe one piece a week if that.
---
Ive been here since launch but I‚Äôve been on and off with it.
---
R. I. P my Gunslinger Build. Was never meta but still a lot of fun. What Bethesda...? Can't hear you, New Vegas is calling and reminds me of working crit revolver builds and a free ncr ranger combat armor.
---
All those general nerfs hits the non meta builds quite hard and on top of that, there are all the bugs...
---
He's getting ready for the Damage system review....
---
More time. more resources. more chance of dying (no matter how small).
---
For me its the abandoned bog town. Every update we get I create a new character and discover it again just in the hopes it will pop.
---
Also recently got my last disease which qas sludge lung which required me getting it then server hopping and then getting another disease to get it to register... that shouldn't be necessary.
---
well if you want XP drop ore in stages. higher level and more enemy spawns.
---
maybe get a proper idea of how the event works.
---
Every patch we get I make a new character and go to abandoned bog town... it won't pop for me. Its frustrating.
---
Huh, that's how it works...
---
If your argument can be reversed with just one word swap, it's not really great argument. 
---
&gt; Pistols  were originally created for fun and roleplay. No one in their right mind was going to create an gunslinger build, but crossbows and bows now, if they have the skill, are quite playable and can even to some extent compete with carbines. 
---
   
---
There is no need to buff everything ot be OP.   
---
&gt; But the release of the damage nerf will bring the archery assembly to the pistol level.  
---
One last thing, have you actually tried the PTS?  
---
My not right in the mind level 314 archer build went from one shot to double tap.  
---
Not that much of a nerf, eh?  
---
Ofc scorched and Mirelurk Queens require double the shots, but only overbuffed bloodied and melee could have one shot/swipe them.
---
Personally I have 490 and I usually have around 300 free depending on what I'm doing
---
an event done decently can get you + 5 legendary's.
---
Good comeback bro
---
&gt;a proper 4/4 completion doesn't happen anymore.  So no chance at rad barrel plan
---
This. 
---
4/4 completion is as rare as getting a decent 3\* from the SBQ.
---
People turn up in their PA and just camp the tunnel entrances. I've seen people turn up and put their PA on when they get there, just to camp the tunnel entrances - why do you need PA for that? Chickens\*\*t.
---
The rad barrel plan is all I'm after from this event now and 4/4 basically never happens. I'll put my stealth suit on (my current build doesn't use PA) and do the best I can at collecting. But if nobody else is collecting ... there's only so many rads I'm gonna take.
---
I've tried the crippling tactic too - only works if you're solo or the other people there know about it. 9 times out of 10 not worth it as someone else will just blast them to eternity. And I've never been able to get more than 2/4 solo.
---
Oh, and just like LITS - leave your Tesla at home, otherwise it's a lag-fest at the moment.
---
Yeah dude, there's been some improvements on the game for sure. But it still needs a lot of work..
---
I got sludge lung recently.
---
Go and catch sludge lung then server hop and catch a different disease it worked for me.
---
Is this a hypothetical or are you confusing me with OP?
---
&gt;Listening to everyone crying over the bloodied nerf when in fact every build got a nerf
---
Why would I cry if I don't even have such a build?
---
Its an exploit that people are using. Usually they will have one at their camp which is meh at ammo production but sometimes people go to the extremes
---
Lol what!! Why does a level 102 not know about ammo factories. Does it need a plan or needs a certain place like the other resources?
---
Work around that worked for me.
---
Went to ash heap and caught sludge lung.
---
Server hop
---
Catch another disease while you have sludge lung.
---
50,000 .45 rounds later "Look guys the SQB is finally at half health!"
---
IMO mutants armor would be the new Vanguards/bolstering for people who use that. A constant armor buff is nothing to sneeze at if it‚Äôs high enough.
---
Though they‚Äôll probably cap it at two or three, so it‚Äôd be about equivalent to vanguard or bolstering.
---
Did you find them in the world?
---
They can't be bought from others but have to be found.
---
I have the same mutations and always have some meat or prepared food. I end up dropping spoiled food more often to help manage weight though
---
As I read through this post, I knew where it was heading and I couldn't help but laugh. What were you thinking man? Even some random death to a bug could have lost you all that junk, yeah it sucks you got killed at a trap base, but come on man, this was more your fault than anyone elses.
---
what was stopping you from playing new vegas in the first place?
---
IDK about SBQ and Colossus but for example, Daily Ops that are coming will give you your ammo back plus more and some pretty decent rewards but who knows.
---
It's from the converted munitions factory in the top right of the map. There's a current bug that let's you build them at your camp or other workshops.
---
It's not suppose to be a thing
---
Change ‚Äúbloodied players‚Äù to ‚Äúmagic and legacy weapon owners‚Äù and maybe you‚Äôll be up to something. And those guys don‚Äôt give a shit about sun kissed
---
Thats great... but the completionist in me wants that check.
---
I vote to keep it.   No amount of nuclear bombardment could get me to move my camp. I‚Äôve built a bunch of them, and I think I finally found both the location and style that fits me best.  You can‚Äôt put a price on that
---
Is it sludge lung?
---
If it is go to ash heap and catch sludge lung then server hop and catch a different disease while you still have sludge lung.
---
Thanks for the tip man.  I'll definitely try this out!  :)
---
Oh really? Sweet! hopefully no more rubberbanding it's so annoying
---
You do, if your teammates got a hit on the enemy. 
---
I am dedicated rad rumble ore runner and I still get all the legendary loot from stuff my team killed. 
---
On impostor sheepsquash I am dps and the pylon conduit tanks get loot just fine thx to being in a team with me.
---
this guy is so greedy, glad you reported him, this kind of work would be problematic to the server and whoever playing in it.
---
The problem is that on the PTS forum everyone is too busy having a sneak peek or basking in joy over the fall from grace that bloody took and engaging in circular arguments.  The fact that a bunch of weapon systems are now completely imbalanced versus the new high level creatures, and a variety of builds will therefore suffer gets lost in the arguments over bloodied weapons.  
---
I worry that it will go live, because players would rather gloat and bicker instead of reporting problems and balance issues.
---
I've finished at least 3 rumbles at 98 ore collected, having collected far more than I should have, when there were ample players there. I can only run so fast. So disappointing.
---
I take 60 seconds to type something out and you call it an essay. Tells us a few things about you.
---
I disagree with you and point out you clearly are struggling with grasping the thread and that means I have thin skin.
---
You are having a go at me for commenting on something, yet along you came to do the same thing. The difference is I actually grasped the thread and knew what I was replying to - not something you can claim.
---
As amusing as this has been, I'm going to go talk with the grown ups now. 
---
Take it easy!
---
lol you just gave me this tip in another post :)  thanks again!
---
The idea of playing fallout typical builds with my friends. No, i like 76 but there are so much fun killers in the moment, i think, i just need a break
---
*Legendary enemy has mutated*
---
The range for team loot is huge. I can run ore at one end of rad rumble and still get loot from team loot at the other end. 
---
Same for uranium fever. The place is much smaller than the loot range
---
Absolutely not surprised.
---
It's the last minute delays. Laughably incompetent. And yet again console players shafted.
---
Two thoughts:
---
1) Like basically everyone who loves to hate Marxists but has never read Marx, you're conflating trade value and use value, and where you recognize the difference, you inexplicably put the emphasis on the former instead of the latter. But a market saturated in B2525 Fixers would be bad only for the traders and really bloody awesome for everyone else (except the people for whom grinding RNG drops to acquire such an item was their whole reason for playing the game, of course). Duping lowers the trade value but not the use value, which is why comparing it to inflation is really not applicable. Money has basically no use value while a duped B2525 Fixer would be every bit as useful to me as one freshly dropped from the Purveyor. 
---
2) The Tragedy of the Commons has little to do with Communism but arises in all situations where the shared use of a common resource is improperly regulated. Global Climate Change and similar environmental degradation effects being the most prominent - and very, very Capitalist - example. To get back to Fo76, "This resulted in the player base missing out on rewards" is simply not true, since Bethesda helpfully adjusted the goals downward. So yay for central planning? :-P
---
Unfortunately for us high level players, One Wasteland has a low maximum level cap in low level zones. All enemies in the Forest will be level 25, even if you're level 100. So I'm still going to remain in the right side of the map, never to revisit the left side unless necessary.
---
The bows may not have been hit as badly, but the pistols are simply killed off.
---
And about the arguments - how many types of pistols are in the game from the start and how many types of bows and crossbows are in the game from the start? There was only one crossbow, there was no bow at all, but there were more than 10 types of pistols. If pistols were a weapon for fun, Bethesda would have introduced 3-4 varieties and stopped there.
---
Once again - I played the PTS, I tried the pistol build for the daily ops, I tried to kill the Wendigo Colossus, the SBQ, I tried to farm mobs. The maximum that the pistol will be good for is farming weak mobs, it is not viable against bosses.
---
Bows, by the way, are not viable from the start. Reducing their damage will not lead to anything, I have never seen anyone play with them. People run around with pistols, albeit rarely.
---
This event becomes undoable once more than four players pop in. they need to give half amount of XP from killing ghouls by collecting ore. this event should allow 4 players max like 8 players max in colossus problem.
---
*\[00:45\] Event: Scorched Earth*
---
wow. that is a terrific roll to get. been though so many, yet to get a bloodied.
---
Am happy with what i have currently though.
---
Instigating, +50% limb damage. +1 agility
---
also. 
---
Unstoppable Monster deathclaw Gauntlet. was from an event.
---
Fasnacht mask
---
The fact there is a limit on scrip is an absolute joke considering there are weight and stash limits. It's insulting tbh.
---
Especially when trying to craft shit with legendary modules for a roll you want. That weighs you down FAST cus of the Bullshit skewed RNG.
---
It's a great trick, although it doesn't work on T-65, gotta use a station for that set. I don't know if it's a bug or not.
---
For good - yes, you're right. We must recycle from scratch. In general, half of the weapons should be recycled. But now Bethesda kills at least one full type of build out of 5 possible. Carbines, machine guns, shotguns, pistols and melee fighters. Only machine guns, carbines and shotguns will remain afloat, the rest will disappear.
---
This is true as long as you don‚Äôt participate in events. Nowadays everything dies in seconds as most who join use their bloodied handmade. Everything gets one-shotted and you probably don‚Äôt get to loot a lot. This has become a bigger problem due to a lot of duping.
---
It would get exploited to hell and back. It wont happen ever.
---
So it wasn't just me. Did the game crashes too?
---
She's the end of the main story boss, which means she should be difficult by "fresh to lvl 50 with little to no legendaries" standards. People rolling up with full 3 star everything and min maxed perk builds should absolutely obliterate her in seconds.
---
I'm still pushing the idea (someone else's idea, but it's a good one) of having another intermediate currency.  Trade your bulky, numerous legendaries in for this new currency, which is uncapped and weightless.  But then, just like treasury notes, you can only hand in enough of this new currency to get 150 scrip per day.
---
We still get Bethesda's daily login requirement they clearly cannot live without, but at least we can get rid of as many nocturnal rolling pins or one-star crafted SS left arms as we want.
---
True yeah , not read much about the Ops thing
---
I cant agree on one shot. One shot bosses and legend, yes i agree, cant even tag a damned encryptid before it melts.
---
But i dont want dealing ages with trash mobs like ghouls(they are the worst enemies imo)
---
The lag is usually caused by Tesla guns. Apparently the ash pile from the Tesla has a different texture or maybe something else with the Tesla. But it's definitely Tesla. Hate that gun now.
---
Its really unfair to the minigun that the weight is so heavy. Shotgun pistol or rifle you barely need a few hundred.
---
Instigating is, if anything, one of the worst affected prefixes, since the nerf has made it that much harder to one-shot mobs.
---
Ghoul Slayer &amp; Co. also seem to work additively, from what I've read. It's just that with the better legendary effects being brought down a bit, they suck much less now, comparatively, than before.
---
AA is indeed quite good as it effectively still behaves like a multiplicative damage bonus. It's still not as good as Junkie's, let alone Bloodied, but it's certainly a plausible contender for the 3rd rank after those two (and generally before Furious, which needs 9 bullets to ramp up the damage)
---
I dunno.  This is a major change on two fronts.  Every single player will have less power, to some degree, while enemies get exponentially stronger.  I‚Äôm fine with having a good fight, but wandering through the Bog feels like a constant uphill battle now, even with best in slot equipment, maximum damage, level 500 and a few fully upgraded legendary perks.  I think it might be too much all at once.
---
They are not endgame. They may be *this games* endgame, but they're not endgame fights, not whatsoever. Just public events that you throw some numbers at. 
---
Hell, the colossus won't be worth doing.
---
I purposely craft shit tone of mine and explosives for the 1v1 lol this event is insane not too mention how many drops I could play this event all day Tbh
---
I mean... I literally came home after work, ate dinner and went to bed today so... yeah... don't have time to play for 30 mon either... plus the time to start up my computer and fo76 and load the game makes it nearly an hour...
---
Nope, if a perk card like scrapper is rank 1 and you open a perk pack and get scrapper the extra just goes poof.
---
Same for rank 3 cards. So cannibal for example you can have a rank 3 version and a rank 2 and a rank 1.
---
You cannot combine the 1 and 2 and then have 2 level 3 versions.
---
This means if you have rank 3 rank 2 and rank 1 of a perk any duplicates also just vanish.
---
So long term high level players who opened their packs have potentially lost a lot of perk coins.
---
I checked, I'm close to but outside blast radius, even for crap aimers..  .
---
Are you stealth too? Because then you're also useless in the new OPs. 
---
Best balancing ever.
---
I'd say make it somewhat like swarm of suitors but for failure, an alpha dealthclaw or something spawns that will be boss level material like SBQ, IS, or EW
---
Unfortunately the way the industry works these days is the game management only look at spreadsheets and graphs of sales and projected profits. Devs have little to no input it's just a wage-slave 9-5 like the rest of us where they do what management tells them to increase profits.
---
I can guarantee you, all these dogshit money grabs they put in the game has increased their profits massively. It's not going any where and I wouldn't even be surprised if they start pulling some p2w bs with legendary perks and coins, that system seems built to be un-completable through normal play...
---
I just want the stein.
---
Wow it only takes 8 sentry bots when you stack xp at level 100 barely dints it for me,
---
They could straight up stick some p2w stuff in the atom store and people would still defend it somehow. Management at Bethesda needs a complete overhaul and lead devs need to retake decision positions.
---
When you have to do tricks to complete dailies easily you don't play the game, you grind. Like making a new character and get started with the early quests to get an easy levelup is something you wouldn't do normally and just wasting your time with.
---
If they aim it a little more to the left of the mine I should be fine. But I'm on the train tracks with steel ore deposit.
---
Your loot? *Our* loot, comrade. Your loot is inside of your inventory. This publicly lootable container on the ground is for everyone.
---
Everything is additive instead of multiplicative.  Strength also doesn‚Äôt stack the same way for melee damage.  Chem buffs behave differently.
---
Nah, you're fucked lol.
---
I'm just over by Grafton dam :-)
---
Then he would have to start from the bottom again when he/ she returns back to the game next week...
---
Wasteland Republic. Callouts, Giveaways, multiple Nukes daily.
---
One and done? There's a shit ton of perks. It would take over a 1000 of levels to get them all.
---
[Morgantown Airport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOz3CyYUT0)
---
Thrill of the grill is way easier than someone to talk to.
---
If you max out a perk (have rank 1 rank 2 Nand rank 3 of a 3 star perk card) it should no longer show up in rhe purchase menu. And lockpick being a 1 star perk should not show up after the initial purchase.
---
Depends by the end of the day probably only 25 or 30 free lbs cause of legendaries. When I first log in I'm able to scrip some of them so I can free up some space.
---
Wasting your time would be playing enough hours to level up once for your high levels, I do that if its ironic timing from NW xp going onto my guy. It takes 7 min to complete the level up just mashing keys to get there, even faster if you can fast travel there. This is to counteract those saying it is grind heavy, too hard, or takes forever; ll of which it doesnt. Only ones that take forwver are things up to chance/ spawn like bobble heads, legendaries, etc. But with most events having 1-3+, its not much to worry about. Leveling up is worth 500 I believe so 500 for 7 min is def worth it.
---
I‚Äôll make a post as to why I don‚Äôt want to move itüòÇüòÇ
---
I have a 400hp car in my garage. I'd be super pissed if someone came and dropped a stock v6 in so the neighbors felt better about their normal cars.
---
Thats also how i feel about this.
---
This has been suggested so many times. One of mine is a unique perk for revolver that fires the whole clip in just a second or so. Making it automatic kinde of.
---
This is why I stopped doing it. I can keep everyone alive solo, just need one or two people to run and grab ores. 
---
Instead, people just camp between the spawn points on either side, not letting the people in the middle kill anything, and they don't get ore.
---
Yeah, unless its been changed in an update, I kill brahmin just by standing next to them with a mutation, and they walk towards me when im shopping. I don't think I should be punished for others failing to keep them contained.
---
I've got one: salvage assaultron head. When doing encrypted, I take it upon myself to heal my rads, and take pylons, because nobody else will. When I'm done, I fire several rounds from my salvaged assaultron head @50 rads a shot to go back to 'normal'.
---
I was surprised when I found out you could kill your *own* Brahmin. Also I saw some guy who locked his Brahmin in his house, so that's one solution lmao
---
Honestly I think they'll postpone legendary perks yet another time since there's little to no positive feedback (third time in a row) because of lack of positive changes made to the system. Of course if they don't want yet another wave of severe community backlash.
---
I've recently swapped to a bloodied heavy build and honestly I'm not used to dealing so much damage, I'm used to only dealing the hundred or so I used to do, I have accidentally one shoted a few legendaries and I've tried to hop on vc and tell them it was unintentional and drop whatever legendary I got, am feels bad man
---
sometimes i forget to switch to my weaker weapons/bash. sorry i wont do it again! (probably)
---
Not sure if it was after an event, but I have had that happen. While I was afk to boot as well.
---
Daisy? The official Red Ryder, carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle, with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time?
---
Still waiting for the SBQ to drop one of those.
---
If they can say that there were Brotherhood in Appalachia, they can say that a group splintered off and made the Outcasts. And I for one support the idea for the potential Outcast cosmetics.
---
more challenge? like she landed sometimes or cripple her? every update their broke some or these. I cant imagine something more complicated than that. I dont know what is your standard to "end game boss" but spend 15min and waste 6k ammo for end game boss looks fine for me. On the other hand they starting nerfing ridiculous damage weapons and majority of people are angry. WTF community.
---
Welcome to the club. I was affected by the bug only once, at the 3rd day, I was online at the reset time. Now I always logout 15 minutes before it and I login at 10 minutes after it, I go to the Adventure mode (so not in the Atom Shop, not on the Run table, not in NW), and I am safe.
---
To be fair, there's no way devs read these posts, let alone play the game.
---

Yea I think I‚Äôve learned my lesson. I‚Äôm positive they said it was fixed in the last or 2nd to last patch notes, though. Shame on me for believing it.

Marine Armor helmet all over again;)

I've attended couple fights with colossus and sbq on the pts and it doesn't seem to differ much (if at all) from what we have on live servers. 1.5-5 minute fights is what you can generally see on PC atm. And that's what I saw in case of both bosses on the pts as well.
---
The rewards were never there, I don't think many people really play these events for rewards since it's just a giant ineffective time and resource-sink. You can get lots of xp from adds (especially now when all enemies there tend to be max lvl yielding more xp) though if the fight will last longer than couple minutes.
---
she is fine for group of players. People start do solo end-game boss and thinking thats how it must be.
---
I know, I mean it‚Äôs the might be the reason as to why I can‚Äôt move it
---
im bloodied but i try and avoid this at events like uranium fever. i just get real close to the legendary and bash it or switch to a bloodied plasma rifle &amp; tag it (which really doesn't do a lot of damage at all) &amp; wave for people to come over. it really sucks though to see people just one shot them with no regard for others
---
I would also change the drop rate of the tattered field jacket, 0,02% is insanity.
---
I refuse to create 4 more characters simply to get more scrip daily. Increase or remove all the limits please. For the past month or so, i have been playing for about an hour each day because the game wont "allow" me to play any more.
---
You're level 304 and 90% towards 305? Well you better wait until tomorrow so you don't miss out on the level up daily challenge! Got 1400 caps for the day? You're done. 150+50 (from dailies) Scrip? Done and done.
---
The fact that i can only craft 2 weapons with modules each day is infuriating me to no end, so i'll say it again. INCREASE or REMOVE all the daily limits Bethesda. This isn't a fun game to play on your free time. It's a second boring and mundane job.
---
Welcome to every ingame item shop ever. Where everything is overpriced because the only customer that matters is whales with lot's of money to spend, and little self control. If you were expecting reasonable prices of 50 cents to a dollar at most for a simple retexture or skin then you must be new to this form of monetization.
---
This!
---
people with fallout 1st will disagree wholeheartedly because they need to justify flushing down 10 bucks a month down the toilet
---
I did
---
Refrigerated Backpack is either bugged or is displaying the wrong value - and I'm betting it's the latter, because I have seen it regularly go from -60% spoil rate to -10% spoil rate in the Pip Boy.
---
According to the wiki, it's 90% @ Level 50, like Good With Salt - but I swear it's *better* than GwS.  I have items that I crafted days ago and they still have yet to have their CND dinged.  I really do think it might be -100% spoil rate.
---
I‚Äôd like this, I have 4 mutations
---
maybe if they have 5 million fallout 1st subscribers giving them free money
---
NPCs are weak anyway like most human players...
---
Oh I see, that's a common problem with most camps. I always have to rebuild when I move
---
Terrible idea.
---
Does it require being able to target limbs in VATS?
---
Bethesda isn‚Äôt doing us a favour on this one eh?
---
Technically they were from Lyon's BoS. Maxson brought them back into the Brotherhood.
---
Good. The last thing I want is to lose the ability to level past enemies.  Hopefully they delay one wasteland indefinitely.
---
\&gt; Plus it's going to be a Double SCORE weekend! 
---
So this is why lots of players have got their dailies bugged?
---
If you have to ask... the answer is no.
---
When you can easily melt anything in the game, you'll know you can tag team her.
---
This makes sense on paper but I'd argue that the community would eat itself alive if it was moved over to weekly limits.
---
Imagine logging on, getting all your scrip the first day of the week, blowing it, and having to wait 7 days until you can touch scrip again.
---
Metallica quote deserves a upvote.  
---
"Its a yes from me Lars."
---
Actually everything we‚Äôve thought we‚Äôve melted it‚Äôs just the encrypted boss has insane damage and put doubt in my mind and made me ask. We‚Äôve finished our prep and plan on fighting it today.
---
Brahman milk. -25 rads if you need to fine tune it the other way.

Invisible bass dude goes off when I have dysentry and go afk for a while.
---
Good luck!
---
For me and my buddy, damage wasn't an issue. Getting her down in the time limit was. We just didn't have enough DPS.
---
I love it bro it‚Äôs so cool.
---
Not as hyped anymore tbh. It looks good, but not this kind of wait good.
---
Sorry for the ignorance, but what's "BR"?   TIA.
---
That‚Äôs the only worry we have at this point, does stagger and limb damage affect here fight?
---
Yup. Several times.
---
I even bought them from players to see if that would work. No luck of course.
---
Most recently I found a copy of zetan invaders on a roof of one of the mansions near the dried up lake (I think the one with the hedge maze).
---
it will be fixed some day but first bethesda needs more fallout 1st subscriptions, who's with me boys??
---
wow. Thanks for the info. +600 hours and didn't know.
---
The last push i needed to go full PA high strength build!!

upvoted
---
2 of my characters are on the lead node just south of the mine. If the nuke is centered on the mine then stepping off my front doorstep puts me in the nuke zone. üòØ
---
Best method is to farm Power armor frames. Drop them to make a wall North and south of the center. Then farm ores. can easily be done solo.
---
Came here to say this but you beat me damn it
---
As an example if you go to Daniel and talk to him after killing roper there is a 20% chance that he‚Äôll give you the recipe for cutting fluid
---
And also plans from Limited Time Events
---
Well, great. The gap between console and PC just grew another few inches. Noice.
---
Can it still be put on arm?
---
Thats not too bad though, I should mention I have a Q2525 and a JE25 10mm plus the JE laser as an auto pistol. I do agree about the sbq, though I have a friend who's super dedicated to making auto pistols work and he was hitting the sbq in the 300s with a B25 10mm auto.
---
I have some tips i hopefully can show you. If you are on pc
---
and get rid of hunters, nocturnal, berserker , that armor one that turns on a stealth field when you get hit
---
Loot is shared for teams as long as you are close to the enemy. But I do agree shared xp would be super nice, and a better shared loot system as well
---
What the fuck causes that?
---
Nice man. I rolled 2 nocturnals, 1 auto stim, 1 mutants.
---
:(
---
No idea
---
No you can't have a floor on the ground without a foundation, the building will be unstable. Oh sure you can have a whole mansion in the sky supported only of one stair case, why not. Perfectly reasonable.
---
Still hoping they ape the syndicates from Warframe in place of the current faction stuff.
---
Why exactly should you reward the usage of mutations, which you actively choose and which brings you extremly hard advantages, with the third highest damage bonus on weapons? What a stupid idea ...
---
No, Mutant's should stay low, because you already have the advantage of the mutations. You would just create a new FOTM for high HP players.
---
They said winter, and then next year, which is still winter. But I wouldn't be shocked if it gets delayed till late spring next year.
---
Include vertibot and pet killers into bounty as well.
---
I dont think I ever called in a vertibot that wasnt shot down by a player.
---
The gauss rifle is tradable, crafted gauss weapons are not. I don't know how that would work.
---
No, it was in the game for some time (dev room items), but it was removed along with Laser Muskets and few other non-legit stuff. Shame, it look nice and I see no reason why wasn't included in some Raider bundle.
---
Playing nuclear winter and going back to adventure.
---
IMHO the best thing that gauss Rifles are missing is the explosive effect. Unlike the forum's author, I think explosive effect is more important that an ability to make gauss Rifles as legendaries.
---
Shame, looks awesome. I prefer that kind of cosmetic compared to the fortnite esque shit we sometimes get. One day...
---
I like one shotting everything with my bloodied commando, at least it takes one grind(ammo) way down in this constant grind of a game. If I still kill the mob almost as quickly, I'd rather not need 4x the ammo to do it if the end result is the same.
---
Based on my experience with it, the colossus isn't worth doing now.
---
the price drop of bloodied handmade could be coming from the PTS changes where bloodied was toned down considerably. so smart traders try to dump them now before changes are applied to live servers. 
---
communism or capitalism argument is simply overthinking. :)
---
This is a really great analogy and spot on.
---
hopefully this means they are going to make bullet storage free because walking around with more than 5k is going to get annoying.
---
We all do :) It'll be probably the only new item than last time, so after I get it, I won't play it again, it's soooo boring...
---
I use Deep Pocketed (save for chest which is Dense) Unyielding FDCWR armor, as well as Deathclaw Steaks and Grilled Mirelurk Fillets so...I'm usually at almost 500 max carry weight.  Out of that I try to stick to around 160-180 weight on me.  I could probably bring that down more but I carry all of my Boiled and Purified water on me to save space in my Stash for Legendaries.
---
The only thing that's even more terrifying than the squirrels, I the beaver. Even the snallygaster is kind of cute
---
Daily scrip limit is the worst. With the caps and bullion limit at least you can continue playing. When you reach scrip limit, it usually doesn't take long for me to reach stash limit. So you can either throw them away or stop playing for that day.
---
This looks like they used the wade airport to create this monstrosity. I've been seeing this done a lot lately. Is it easier for them to get away with this exploit using workshops, since it resets when server restarts??
---
If they allowed players to grind out as much scrip and bullion as they wanted then they would have to design better Season Pass rewards than +50 scrip or bullion though, and we can't have that! No no no no, sirree.
---
I thought they added the explosive effect to gauss rifles
---
Hmm. What makes you think so?
---
Could have sworn I read it in the patch notes with wasetlanders. I'll craft one and see if demo expert affects it
---
Don't worry.   Automatic weapons  will be the next thing nerfed to shit and beyond.   TSE legacy weapons, shotguns, rifles.... I mean, there's a pattern here.
---
In real life those rooms are absolutely massive, l‚Äôm interested to see what they could put in them
---
What are scrips and bullion‚Äôs? I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm new to the game
---
I figure with the rampant in-your-face obvious cheating that's happening on PC NW, plus the publishers lack of action and suppression of information ... it must be a Vault-Tec social experiment in how much pain and futility players will endure.
---
Oh we bow down to your gloriousness! How would we ever complete an event without your cookie cutter bloodied build! Whoa is us puny non-cookie cutter builds! Surely we'll never amount to your level of skill! /s
---
I honestly thought it would be which is why I didn't do it to someone else
---
Also I was very disappointed when I finally unlocked the fert station only to find out I don't get endless ribeye steaks right from home as well as Beckett starting to attack my own buildings,,,
---
They MIGHT modify it slightly in the future but yeah, I don't see them ever going away. OP said it isn't a free-to-play mobile game but it's pretty clear that's the business model they settled on for this game to maximise profitability. Sad
---
Sadly even 1 minute is too much for some people. They see the SBQ not as a challenge but as a chore to collect another legendary and a little more XP.
---
Most/all online games, especially MMOs, have an account wide storage box as a basic feature for everyone. Hell, PSO2 just came out in USA and has one (for free) and that games like 400 years old.
---
I rhink it came out aa sarsastic, but i agree woth out
---
76 needs some of that too
---
Just a bloodied commando, I think sometimes it's vulnerable for a split second as soon as it spawns in and has a smaller health bar, I only shot it like 6-7 times and it was dead.
---
Amazing.   Can anyone even begin to understand the hypocrisy?
---
In simple terms, there will be an event in a few different places on the map where you beat on an oil drum to attract animals, kill them and collect the meat. Once per hour the Meat Week event will spawn, you put your gathered meat on a fire pit and have various task to perform to beat the event, like put out grass fires, gather wood for the fire pit, feed Grahams brahmin, collect plants, kill rats,  turn a spit, beat on a drum, etc; It's an event that draws lots of players together and IF they cooperate and each take one of the task then it can be beaten pretty quickly. Sometime though, everyone wants to play the drum or everyone wants to put out fires or everyone wants to do the same thing.  It's a community event, some people love it, some don't bother with it and others only participate sporadically. The more people you have there the easier it is to get the rewards. I may have left something out, been awhile since I played it.
---
Now I can kill SBQ too, but when update will be released - pistols will be trash. At live servers pistols are playable, if you have skills. But it's live, on PTS pistols too weak.
---
I have B2525 and B5025 10mm pistols, B5025, B2515r and B2525 pipe revolvers, BE laser auto pistol, B5015r 38 pipe pistol, BE15r western revolver, B25 plasma pistol and B50 plasma pistol. I know all about pistols and how to use em
---
There is specifically a death loot bag and a dropped loot bag. I understand you want to bait other players to gank them but that isn't exactly why OP is talking about.
---
Buy sufficient stocks in zenimax that you constitute a significant power amongst the shareholders
---
Thankfully we don‚Äôt have to worry about that, any request to do with making the game better for the players apparently isn‚Äôt even worth replying to on here. Let alone actually changing...
---
All of the limits are annoying, they are limiting the experience therefor limiting the reason to come back, the stash limit ha prevented me from placing things like aid items, clothing and weapons in there (i dont mind having a limited stash but 800 still seems low) and the Bullion and Scrip is just more annoying, why limit them? I stopped playing outside of daily challenges for a few days because I couldn‚Äôt scrip a few legendaries clogging up my inventory, combo that with the limited stash, i either have to drop these legendaries to prevent myself from being over encumbered, or spend my hard earned scrip early.
---
Its incredibly anti consumer, and as someone who paid ¬£60 to preorder the game, im not spending more for the scrap box or Fallout 1st in general.
---
Bullion and Scrip limits must go, they really do nothing good for the players and actually incentivise not returning to play often, something Bethesda wants people to do, my advice? Keep campaigning, if they don‚Äôt remove the limits, they can atleast up them, and im not talking a few hundred, im talking atleast 10,000 scrip and 100,000 bullion, stop limiting your players fun Bethesda, stop limiting enjoyment in your game!
---
No worries, this use to be a constant problem for me too.
---
Let me know if that is what is causing you to not be able to respawn.
---
Just realised I put Camp in the title and not workshop. Thank you for pointing that out. They put the AF's in workshops as they can leave abd not worry about ghost budgets
---
Normal Gauss rifle is explosive as demo expert perk buffs it. All gauss weapons have explosive without having the legendary affix.
---
Battle Royale
---
words coming from all the community ( except the noobs fanboys)
---
Cancel your Fallout 1st, uninstall the game until there are significant changes.
---
This is an echo chamber of "Game bad" yet everyone keeps playing it complaining.
---
Just crafted a lvl 35 with 0 perks for rifles other than demo r5 it was at 178 took demo off and went down to 165. So it does have an explosive effect now
---
" This isn‚Äôt a free to play mobile game. " But we like that revenue stream and engagement benchmarks.
---
To add to this, this incentivises people to save up 1000 scrip and simply not play the game until a sale is on, therefor having a large amount of players who only return for short periods of time, not daily or as often as Bethesda obviously wants us to return.
---
No but hoping for items that rare is the hook of Online games right?
---
&gt;60 fps
---
Why so low? Moar.
---
You must be blind because they have listened and fixed and implemented tons of things suggested by the community already.
---
They should just let the modders take over at this point. Same time next year we'd have a 100% better game.
---
Vats can trigger 2 targets too
---
Damn. This game is still alive? At this point I feel like this game is like a zombie.
---
Bloodied build. Stand in a river or eat bad stuff to get to 19%. Take the regen mutation and adrenal reaction along with nerd rage etc. Add a bloodied weapon and sneak perks for massive damage.
---
Everything about the legendary perk system makes no sense. =/
---
PS: still, no one talks about all the rank 1 card dupes like Aqua Boy that the game has auto-deleted since release. Lots of missing coins.
---
there is never enough money!
---
I can confirm, been using this backpack mod for months and crafted stuff like relish or brain bombs can literally sit in my inventory for weeks without spoiling.
---
It's a bloodied build - radiation generally allow to keep low health. The lower health you have, the more powerful the bloodied effect on weapon and higher bonus from Adrenal Reaction mutation and other Perks or mods (Nerd Rage, Emergency Protocols etc.).
---
I tried the milk once, when i realised how much i work around my rads and all i gave up this option, but it's a good one if you wish to keep hunger and thirst up ( rad away tend to drain those too quickly, yep ... that's also why my character is a carnivore ;D
---
Also i can set the shortcut once and never bother with it, it's why i share the way i do but the 33% upvote tend to make me think people are either angry at bloodied or too lazy to say why and how i am doing it wrong.
---
At least you can get scrip from completing events now...but it doesn't fix the fundamental problem of the ridiculous 1000 scrip cap which can be easily earned in a day or two. 
---
Then you're stuck with 7 pieces or 70-100 pounds of useless legendaries contributing to the stash cap which you can't scrip because of the scrip limit and...ye gods it's a neverending hamster wheel of nightmares.
---
Just remove the scrip cap, then you wouldn't even have to touch the max stash capacity.
---
Come to think of it yours is better.
---
Just imagine dying randomly, then coming back to someone who picked the bag just to initiate PvP. The choice should be on the owner of the deathbag, not the looter.
---
Why a bigger nerf to gat lasers?... they wrnt any more OP then anything else.... prob just becuase "batteries not included &amp; power user" and the fact that power cores are super easy to farm/find. ....there goes my full health heavy gunner, do they realise they are just pushing everyone to strictly only make bloodied builds?
---
So I must have a bloodied weapon for this to work?
---
They‚Äôre using a bloodied weapon which does 100% more damage if you are below 20% percent health so they keep rads on them to make sure they never go above 20% and are using armor and perks that give them high damage resist.
---
Oh look a legendary let me switch weapons real quick... shoot 7 people shot it and now it's dead let me switch back... oh she's landing just one sec gotta get in the pip boy and re equipt the magic nade... ok ready to freeze her now so my other bloodied build friend can drain her before she... takes off again... well guess ill just wait another 5 min for her to land.  Oh look a legendary let me switch... see how that's not fun? Are you switching weapons to minimize your damage every legendary you see during that event? 
---
Let's just get it done and launch another, trust me a quick 3 sbq fights plus an encrypted over an hour helps the whole server more than 2 sbq over an hours time. Plus if I can't use end game weapons at the hardest fights in the game what is the point?
---
The loot thing already happens. If I'm at an event with a fellow team mate, whatever they kill I can loot from those bodies and visa versa.
---
A b2525 handmade or junkies exploding at kevel 35 do very nice damage but don‚Äôt expect huge payments. In general tho level 1 armour sells nicely with wwr and then max gear. Everything between is scrip. Generally.
---
No because both Bloodied and Junkies give damage in lieu of the penalties suffered (low health, addictions). Mutations already give a boost and have their respective penalties (mitigated by Class Freak).
---
What you want is a buff as a reward for having a buff.
---
Ty!
---
That's not what OP means, it's the fact that after patch 21 weapons and armor are breaking faster than before, it has nothing to do with what armor or weapon you have.
---
No. That‚Äôs just the cherry on top. Junkies run low level. You‚Äôll need to take blocker in strength and serendipity in luck as well or you‚Äôll die as soon as your touched. With the sneak multipliers and adrenal reaction and nerd rage you‚Äôll do serious damage with any weapon. Bloodied just chucks another 80% on top
---
Just store your rad shower and place when needed. You may find it hard spawning in as I'm betting nearly every server will have a nuke zone there. put on contractor and try to get the repair magazines, it may be easier to just move tho tbh
---
agreed. some people are just assholes in their guts. uranium fevwr is the most toxic event in the game. whwn i see someone intentionally doing it i block their gt so i cant get in the same server with them again
---
Twin pistols will require some serious mechanics. Now, in order for pistols to be playable, you can, for example, rework the perk that will increase their stealth damage to x4, but slightly cut the range. This is logical - the pistol is less noisy than an assault rifle, less powerful, but it allows you to hit the target in a vulnerable spot and go unnoticed.
---
you now what I don't understand you like do you think there is HP bar at bethesda and every time you post stupid "BeThEsDa rEmoVe lImlT" posts this HP bar decrasing and at the and they will remove it lmao "BETHESDA REMOVE LIMIT YOU ARE MY SLAVES MUHAHAHA" post just becoming karma farming here.  
---
 So there is a place called rules in reddit and every subreddit have one go to rule 10 open it there is a blue sentence in it that means it is link open  that and look at that list and after read the list please answer me if you are not fo76 player that can't read but can write
---
Thanks for the help
---
They never will. It not necessarily in the player‚Äôs best interest for them to raise or remove caps. The caps, although inconvenient, prevent inflation.
---
There are other solutions. With legendary items, if you could manufacture desirable traits or reroll the traits of collected legendaries, it would actually boost the in-game economy.
---
Another solution would be a new vendor/currency that can be used to turn caps into gold, gold into scrip, scrip into ammo currency, etc.
---
It's been a problem since launch with thousands of threads just like this. At this point it's more Bethesda's fault than the players for designing it this way and never improving it.
---
They added this recent LFG system but it still sucks cuz I hate playing with my random teammates cuz EXP from kills isn't shared unless you tag everything. The game just isn't designed for playing with others.
---
Wow, thanks, what a great summary!
---
litteraly because of the scrip limit i stopped playing last night, since my weoght limit has exceeded both in stash and my characters carry capacity, if i could have scriped some of my BS legendaries  i would've kept playing
---
Oh and full unyielding armour. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs 1 star. That gives u +15 in every stat as well so if your melee it‚Äôs a huge boost and the rest is a boost to carry weight. Accuracy. Sneak. Health. Ap. Etc.
---
Feels so weird trading in a just 20 treasury notes from a couple thousand
---
Let's be honest a handful of things out of 1000s of requests.
---
Well said. As you say, indicators. Those of use who've worked in both good and bad companies know them.
---
Wait, how do I make a mule? Do I need to go on the private server for that, and drop the stuff I want to drop, then log back out, log back in with the mule, and pick it up?
---
I have 4 characters with almost full stash. Each is over 700 and that's only because I haven't been farming as much lately and I work 12 hours, have a family etc. Their limits are a joke.
---
Variety =/= quality. Ofc only some of them are usable, but not the reason you are thinking about. You listed only listed pistols that can utilize stealth as a huge damage modifier (which was hit in the nerf). And as pistol user in the past, they were **never** viable for bosses, nor they will be when you can't use the stealth as a modifier.
---
&gt; The bows may not have been hit as badly, but the pistols are simply killed off. 
---
Went from 2300ish damage to 751, that is quite a huge hit. Though it was overkill on the past and that's why I only need to double tap the level 100 super mutants, which in term of humanoid enemies are the strongest. Bows and crossbows are viable, you just have to polish your build. It's one of the best damage per cost weapon, since I kill, while rarely lose ammo.
---
The...ScorchQueen Beast?
---
I also have a Legendary Shovel just for the Buried Remains Daily. The amount of times I've visited the cemetery and found no shovel there is more than the number of times I've found a Mothman or Flatwoods Monster in a random encounter.
---
I'll keep that in mind
---
My allies only wear old/wedding rings.... if that were the case, my mannequins will only wear old/wedding rings.... "NO! Dobby does not get clothes"
---
Is there a link to the the perks and specials, explaining them. Not seen much on them.
---
You deserve more recognition for this. If the game weren't so buggy we could one day have programmable CAMPs and expand on this.
---
Screws and Adhesive! Screws and Adhesive!
---
Never pass them up, ever. Even if it means backtracking because you see the silhouette of duct tape on a shelf. You will use them for everything short of cooking for the entirety of the game. 
---
Go to your Pipboy and scroll to the Junk column.
---
Look for the option to 'view components'.
---
From here you can select the various components you never want to miss. This adds a handy magnifying glass icon when looting, so you'll easily know that typewriter breaks down into screws, or that pens have acid in them, cigarettes give plastic etc. 
---
If you get lucky enough to find a cheap mutation serum, be warned that you *will* lose the mutation when you use Radaway/Decon showers unless you have the perk card Starched Genes maxed. It's in the Luck category after level 35 (I think).
---
Try to limit yourself to one 'signature' weapon as your main and a melee weapon for low levels you don't want to waste ammo on. 
---
This will help you to conserve and build a stockpile of ammo. You'll need it once you hit endgame!
---
Claim workshops for plans. Do the first defend mission as it usually pops up within 5 minutes but then just forget about it. Don't bother with the next defend or the retake unless you just want to do it. There is little demand for them these days, so being contested for one is rare and if someone wants it that badly, you've got better things to do so they can have it. 
---
You can get a water purifier that does not require a water source, so don't think you have to build camp near one. The small purifier only holds 2 but as long as you pop into camp periodically and get in a routine of emptying them, they add up quick.
---
Sell water in bulk for easy Caps. I set up 2 of the small purifiers at my camp, grab the 4 and put 2 in stash everytime. Then I sell a stack of 50+ when my stash starts to get full. 
---
Whenever you kill a large group of animals like Radrats, roaches etc, don't skip picking all the meat. I made this mistake starting out as I figured I'd never be able to use it all before it spoiled. Then I realized around level 60 that I could sell the meat for a Cap a piece!
---
So whenever you get a large group, you'll end up with 30-50 chunks of meat. Head to a train station and sell it all for a nice bonus. 
---
Speaking of selling things you don't use. You can use plastic and a tinkers bench to bulk junk items and then you can sell them. Over time your stash will end up getting full of junk you rarely use like Glass and Asbestos. Don't just drop it on the ground though, bulk it and sell for Caps!
---
Keep an eye on your 'Misc' tab as certain items like Gunpowder and Ores will go in there, won't be auto added to your stash and have considerable weight. 
---
Speaking of weight, Stims, Chems and Ammo will weigh you down quick. Some perk cards can help with this but starting out, you'll want to store excess in your stash to increase your carry weight. You shouldn't need more than 20 stims on you unless doing certain events. 
---
If you see a Super Mutant named Grahm, constantly talking to a brahmin he calls Chally... don't shoot him! Instead just walk over and let him know I've got my chef hat ready to go!

Dark souls has exciting and dangerous combat.  Spending more stuff requiring no extra skill to get a kill is not fun.
---
You made a post telling people 76 is better than fo4 and then you pretty much cry when someone gives an actual argument to your invalid points? Are you serious?
---
Only if they make what some people put on their vendors a crime, because the only time I kill a Brahmin is when someone has a ton of useless shit listed.
---
In a sense, 76 is more fun to play, but the grind is too much.
---
I like the CAMP over the specific build spots. I like the changes to the legendary items. I understand the reason behind perk cards since it is a PvP game but I prefer becoming a God in FO4. I like being able to play with people. 
---
76 has lots of new great changes to the platform itself, but the story is drab and grinding for god tuer items is worse than playing a rigged slot machine. 
---
All I can say is that with all the new technology Berhesda has in this engine, I can't wait for them to be used in TES6
---
I read that in his voice omg
---
&gt;&gt;Bethesda can y'all please give the ~~styles tab in the atomic shop~~ BUGS  some ~~love?~~ FIXING?
---
FTFY
---
Seriously though. Posts like this are just giving Beth the green light to carry on prioritising cosmetics and monetisation over quality.
---
Removing the scrip limit would increase weapon and armor values considerably, it would be slightly slower to build gear, but with the bulion crafting and event rewards that is mitigated. So it would be a good thing overall
---
Corn... just corn...
---
Sometimes it means that they are "food" for tougher builds in PVP but it can also mean players with a lot of QOL perks slotted during normal gameplay while a lot of true min/maxers will only have damage increasing perks (for the most part) as their builds. Started as a weird elitism thing but has become common slang in the community.
---
Even if they were it'd still be disappointing. Whole thing sux.
---
They should decrease Gold Bullion costs for items and make any unlocked plans shared account-wide after Expeditions is released now that we have multiple endgame options. Gold Bullion doesn‚Äôt have to be a pain.
---
Wish I would have known this before I forced myself to solo a silo to get the quest to go away. Only died 4 times so go me?
---
That's standard. I throw on more weight saving perks while I sell things to vendors to get my caps for the day, then switch back to my damage perks when they are cleaned out. 100 is plenty to haul junk for a good hour of clearing spots.
---
nothing a power drill can't fix.
---
I find it a bit funny that you can build yourself a huge mansion, but you only get one small box to stash your junk in.
---
Yeah got it yesterday too after a blue screen. Wanted to restart the game after reboot but steam was like " i dont know that game". Even tried to launch the game with the fo76 exe. But steam still wanted to download the whole game again.
---
So many.     
---
\--the player who had thousands of 10 mm rounds at 0 caps when I desperately needed them (level 25 or so with Perfect Storm as best weapon; didn't comprehend good melee weapons yet)  
---
\--player who dropped 100's of plans, including some of the ones that were really difficult for completing tadpole/possum challenges  
---
\--player who dropped complete set of modded-out Stranger Heart Armor   
---
\--my regular teammates who share so much knowledge and even resources/weapons   
---
\--everyone who revives me when I go down in a mob of enemies, taking the risk  
---
\--a player who led me to a quest's objectives when I was trying to figure out where everything was at....did it without being asked, somehow just knew
---
Thank you, at least I'm not the only one. I just submitted a ticket to Bethesda.
---
These are the kind of people that make me think they'd be great to know IRL.
---
I don't buy their server stability schtick until someone can prove it.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info.
---
I thought this could only be built at the munitions factory? Like how the fusion core machine can only be used at the power plant?
---
I top that. I never get excited was goes live, I wait until it get it's first hot fix.
---
I have 1 too. Or from getting a 'weapon cash/crate' for the raider scum and get a 3 star tire iron. Sigh
---
Is the heavy duty perk still on the list on new perks? Some site show it, others don't...
---
Im glad you think this game is a good idea of capitalism and communism
---
Paper money is backed by substance of value (gold). You can add more money but having the same amount of backing devalues the currency.
---
It normally just searches for the files, finds them and it's okay... wonder what Bethesda is up to. No good probably
---
The plan is called "Advanced Power Connectors". You should be able to get it from the Free States vendors at harpers and Whitespring and also the Mall vendor at Whitespring. Hes the one thats tucked around the corner of the last shop on the right hand side of the strip. The Watoga Train vendor is another spot
---
I'm after the barrel plan so I always collect ore
---
The economy is already fucked, might as well for a little bit.
---
All anyone wants is the high end gear that's been duped 1000s of times, and if you didn't have any decent weapons before the dupe you ain't getting anything really good.
---
Before people would trade good weapons for ammo, junk, flux caps, etc. Guess what? All that's been duped, there's a exploit to get lots of ammo, and now caps are basically worthless unless you happen to find some casual who doesn't know they have good stuff.
---
Fuck, I made plans to play collasus event for Tuesday, now they can't manage to release it on Tuesday AGAIN.  Absolute shitshow sometimes.
---
While not in PA:   about 400 carry weight, 100 lbs free.   If in PA, it's more like 320 with about 40 carry weight.   I only use PA when absolutely necessary.    I carry Rad Ang lager and pep rolls all the time, and make use of strength-enhancing liquor and foods when available.
---
They're more feature designed for player retention.  They want people logging in every day because that builds up a routine and keeps players from wandering off and playing something else too easily.  Just like with daily challenges.
---
These limits in particular also exist as a cap on the hardcore players.  If Bethesda gave certain people the opportunity they would have grinded and emptied out all of the bullion shops within the first week.  Similarly they'd be endlessly cycling through scrip.  There's also such a thing as having players that play too much, you want to keep those players from either burning themselves out or just burning through all the available "content" and getting bored and wandering off.  
---
The bullion limit exists to keep you coming back each day even if it's just to turn in your daily bullion and the scrip limit does the same for people really into trying for their god rolls while also keeping them from being able to endlessly grind and get those god rolls sooner.
---
In general, several parameters determine the build quality in the game. In this situation, the most important indicator is DPS, the amount of damage per second. And according to this indicator, the commando and the machine gun overtake any build, no matter how much it is developed. And with the damage nerf, this discrepancy will become even stronger. I have a machine gunner and I passed the daily ops to the last reward level without any problems. With a pistol, I managed to kill a simple super mutant goliath with great difficulty.
---
Now the gun is capable of killing any boss alone (yes, I even have a video). With the release of the nerf, he will be doomed to the simplest farming.
---
By the way, I can also mention the plasma pistol from the useful pistols - it is quite capable of competing with carbines, if properly assembled.
---
How do people cheat? Not come across this on that event? :o
---
Another reason to carry them:   stash exploits.   It's come up a couple of times, people taking things from stash.   I haven't heard of it happening from inventory unless you're doing a trade with someone you don't know.  (Also the bug initially at Radiation Rumble, but that's been fixed.)
---
Oh man, I'm nearby, maybe I'll finally get people at my camp!!  I'm literally right across from sunny top station where the lead extractor is.  I spawn in on 2 glowing mole miners and 2 glowing mole rats every time, plus the lead, and lots of scorched across from my camp.  It's close enough to run to the ammo factory, only downside is people RARELY come by my camp, I sell everything dirt cheap, usually 1 cap, but I don't sell ammo, just chems, food, and random stuff.  Someone did the pumpkin house with him recently then came by my camp and bought every bit of prewar food and it made me so happy, we took photos and relaxed.  
---
I'm not lonely in game, I mostly play with my husband or daughter if he's not available to play, but I love to have people stop by. 
---
I used to have my camp by the SBQ before tents were a thing so I would regularly get wrecked, usually people helped repair after so they could scrap and stuff.  Any time I see people with broken bits I try to help repair them.
---
Also it kills diversity. Yes i could play with my build for 2 hours a day and lvl up in 5 days, or i can be unyielding and lvl up in 1.5 hour in the most boring way.
---
Not having to worry about how much glass, coal, silver junk I have is worth it. No more micro managing my junk.
---
It's made earning Caps so much simpler, as now I can just store hundreds of lbs of weapons and chems to sell the following day, as I hit the 1400 Cap limit daily. Before I never could do that, always having to break down for scrap to conserve weight. 
---
I park the tent near a train station on the far side of the map from my camp, so I have a free travel point for events or missions etc. 
---
As such I tend not to move it around much but others just use it as a mobile stash/scrap box. Your method may vary. 
---
Yes, it's worth it... if you're playing daily.
---
Dual Wield Auto 10mm  and be able to do the spinning move like the sound of music blond in the original FO76 trailer.
---
Cool, do add us on both steam n in game.
---
geckosg
---

---
I suspect they are making this change now in order to bring 5 stars online with the BOS content.
---
Which is why we have community events like Fasnacht, etc. - bring players back more often
---
Is also why they've introduced things like Seasons and Community Events - also an attempt to bring players back more often.
---
sorry i had a tesla for the person whos brahmin i killed it was an accident a mirelurk came and i tried to kill it
---
It‚Äôs simple: if the vendor prices are too high, the brahmin dies üòà
---
I always carry an entire second PA with a jetpack on me. Takes like 10 seconds to switch, instead of hotswapping, but even without Portable Power that‚Äôs negligible if it means I save up like 10 pounds imo
---
Bye bye
---
YES!  This bugs me, even if I can run all 4 tunnels it's just level 1 rewards.  I usually do them all, taking the shower in-between and deposit at the end, in the last 30 seconds.  The last 5 times we played we had people just sit and do nothing, not even shooting ghouls.  Today a level 24 showed up (NBD, I don't mind helping them with with grind) but they started the event with only us there, before anyone else spawned in. It is such a downer after how well everyone works at Encrypted, and SBQ, even Uranium Fever is getting better unless you play with someone who oneshots everything.
---
No works without VATS but obviously concentrated fire VATS will make it easier to cripple things like scorchedbeast wings.
---
All 20 in a row I highly doubt that.
---
Are you sure about that? Every patch, every update, every new feature people go crazy and expect a fallout game to be perfect. (or atleast work). This is fallout we‚Äôre talking about, it never works! Besides how many times have you seen ‚ÄúiM lEaViNg‚Äù posts. It‚Äôs beond a joke at this point. It‚Äôs just sad how divided the community is on a variety of topics such as pvp, balancing, fallout 1st, the atomic shop, patching exploits, places you can camp, canoninity and etc etc 
---
(Unless your post was meant to be a satirical joke about how both our subreddit and the wasteland are toxic places, or you‚Äôre just memeing, is n which case I slaute you)
---
I hear max raider rep let's you build this
---
Something weird since this is fallout like aton of gnomes or a complete set of pool balls. Things that are mundane to us but have these post apocalyptic would be interesting.
---
Thank you so much! I was about to go mad ovet the fact that i couldnt find it anywhere, you are a saint
---
Those events aren‚Äôt on 24/7 though, the only reason weve had to return in the last month (until Atlas ofc) or so is to complete daily and weekly challenges, outside of those, there isnt a point until community events return.
---
And people who have completed the run, who also have max bullion and scrip, when there are no events, why should they return to the game? The daily challenges don‚Äôt revert to atoms or anything.
---
aka "we don't know what to do but we should do something" change
---
figure out how to balance your game? nah
---
ham fisted nerf of all damage? sounds good
---
Doesn't boost health.  Endurance is the only stat that doesn't get +3 per unyeilding piece.
---
I'm thankful PC players will be testing it for us.   Not in a mad rush to see what the new bugs will be.
---
This was my tactic to solo the vault raids, works a treat.
---
Instead of pacified creature we need a similar to CAMP ally item -- a CAMP animal object that allows us to have a pet. 
---
For example: Dog house plan that requires animal friend level 3 to be build. Dog house comes with a dog (obvious). Dog will guard your camp provides defense.
---
Another example: Cat milk dish plan that comes with cat. Cat will just be cat.
---
Of course building it must replace any tamed creature.
---
Can you share the video, it got me curious. You can DM me if you want.   
---
I did not mention the plasma pistol, because there are glitches to make it shoot faster than most guns and flamer mod. And numbers speak more for the nerf than any other hypotetical situation.  From waht you say, I think you went with the guerilla perks.  
---
And I forgot to mention that the pipe revolver is double dipping in perks, so it's not a great measure.
---
Pc is consuls are not
---
Only other options are to take the chance at using a suitcase at a train station to make the transfer RISKING someone just happen to come across your stuff OR get fallout first and tranfer on private server. I would never risk transferring on public server because of not just the other players but the  server is not the most stable server.
---
&gt;I started to wonder how bad it would affect me, so I downloaded the PTS
---
I've never been able to do that, I thought this was only for people involved with the game dev in some way, players with some inside connection, the elite. There is a link but it never worked so I just didn't bother.
---
I really miss the logic gates in this game, I wish they would add them
---
Yes.  Reliably triggers it for me until I exit the game.  It's usually the acoustic bass riff but sometimes it's the weird synth notes from when you first connect to a NW match instead.  Not a huge fan of the second one.
---
I know exactly where your camp is. Used to have a camp there as well before moving to aaronholt farmstead to farm cranberrys before moving around more. I liked that spot but was hard to find server where it was available
---
No, its not like this. Its a smaller but taller. But does make you ammo. This is someone using a exploit.
---
I‚Äôm partially Meming the fallout community in general is shit like you said but the 76 community specifically is the least bad from what I‚Äôve experienced .
---
I did all the theory tests first and then marked all challenges for tracking: no problems anymore.
---
Yeah.   The last time I did WS, I got two.
---
Oh you'll still level past enemies, eventually. Supermutants in West Tek are max level 100.
---
He's farming ammo with the ammo factory exploit to "prepare" for Update 22.
---
Wait, a Ford or a fjord?
---
It's pretty rare.
---
Look man I've played around with just about every build in this game. I've made a nocturnal only build with my prized NE fixer... a bloodied melee build that only uses a bat and baseball grenades while wearing various mascot heads... a junkies golfer... a witch with a poisonous bloodied  bow... longshoreman with a qe harpoon and a pole hook wearing a dc mask... a medic shotgun build that can cripple everything without killing it while healing my team for power leveling others... I've had fun with all of them but I don't bring the witch to a sbq fight and expect to hit every legendary or melt the queen. 
---
If I'm running queens my goal is to take out 3 queens as fast as possible. Honestly that's the only reason I still do them. It provides me a challenge to take her out in under 10 min. I even have to coordinate with friends... it's not about me being more skilled we just have opposing objectives. 
---
You don't have to join me though... other events still run while sbq is up. You can always do those if you prefer. After the queen is downed you'll likely find me there with you doing some nerdy cosplay sharing everything. Lately I've been going with old man winter using the cyrolator.
---
If you are on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher, you can search through all games and get the PTS.
---
The Beast Queen Scorched
---
Yeah what the other folk said, Bloodied weapons = the lower your health, the more damage the weapon put out.
---
How did it go down?
---
This is so annyoing.Happens to me too.You can hear the sound of the shotgun being charged up so the game thinks you are charging it up.
---
Even on a private server there is a risk of you disconnecting or you not being able to rejoin the same server
---
Places you can camp? There are factions of people on where should you camp? I hope I‚Äôm in the cool ones
---
Yes, I had that issue for a while, now it's a ghost town.  I run into people on my team at the station but that's about it. I tried to space out from my husband and daughter for FT purposes and they are both near the bottom on the left side.
---
I know about the revolver, but this bug is not used in the video. I don‚Äôt use bugs at all, but if the pistols are nerfed, I will have no choice but to change the weapon to "magic".
---
I'm not aware of the plasma glitch. Used B50 plasma with a sniper barrel and B25 as a flamethrower. With the Sentinel set, she performed quite well.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVHZuBjTvY
---
In the video, you can see that not only do I have no perks for carbine damage, but also a revolver with a handle, not a stock.
---
Build in the end
---
I've lost item using my private before. Did the same thing as always, put items in bag and hastily switch character only to find about the 10 bloodied weapons I stashed where no longer there
---
Currently sitting on about 35,660 bullion worth of Treasury Notes at the moment. Something needs to change. Remove or increase (substantially) the cap Bethesda, Please.
---
Also, for those that forgot-  radicool "the more rads you have the more +STR points!"
---
The closest we will get to the outcasts I would imagine is the paint job from nuclear winter at overseer rank 60. So sadly that is your only option as it means they are not intending to put that paint in the shop.
---
I know this doesn‚Äôt sound good for people who enjoy the game but the best way would be to start a protest and stop paying for f1 and not logging in the game. When people leave out of frustration that can be attributed to many things. When it‚Äôs clearly in protest of something, they‚Äôll need to address that.
---
Source: worked in gaming
---
Because it is not intentional they made it where extra damage from anything like perks or legendarys are no longer multiplicative but additive, so any weapon that has a low base damage like the Gatling laser gets nerfed like 5 time harder then anything else. That is why this update is so bad it nerfs everything on the same level not looking into the different levels that the weapons are at, so the Gauss mini gun is only like a 30% nerf because it has high base damage but they nerf the Gatling laser the exact same amount as they do the Gauss mini gun but the base is so much lower that it is a 77% damage reduction.
---
She does not scale. Myth has been busted by many daramines. 
---
32k Health. 70% damage reduction.
---
&gt;And people who have completed the run, who also have max bullion and scrip, when there are no events, why should they return to the game?
---
That's kind of my point - they're trying to put things in to bring them back. Season starts, runs for a while, keeps people busy for a few weeks. Then start to throw extra things in to keep people engaged - events, double xp, purveyor sales, community challenges, etc. Season ends. Rinse and repeat.
---
Pretty soon we'll have daily ops to throw in the mix to - no doubt, community daily ops and daily ops specials at some point too.
---
Not saying I agree with it
---
Yay we‚Äôre the not shittest! I‚Äôll take it
---
These "leavers" never give their stuff away, hmmmm.
---
I assume, my husband ended up in one earlier that was hilarious, he went up to buy and they used a pressure plate, then trapped you in with a punch bowl, scare crows and a bed. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Bowl was empty, and he was overencumbered  RIP.
---
I was on about when wastelanders and it‚Äôs new ‚Äúno camp zones‚Äù first came out people went mental about how Bethesda can‚Äôt force them out of there favourite campin spots and how they were very distressed
---
Fuck this. Even when they add  it  on consoles I'm not gonna do this event. Fuck Colossal Problem.
---
Ik luckily I have people to help me but it would be a lot easier with an account wide stash or mail box
---
I specced out of a Shotgun build around level 25. The extra damage was great starting out but by then I was missing more shots via VATS than it was worth.
---
Both dead
---
On low
---
Commie maggot /s
---
Oh. I'm also a bloodied commando but I have never heard of that much damage. The vulnerability right as it spawns makes sense then.
---
Yes I am on PS4
---
I assume OP plays bloodied build.
---
I mean, the all the pros are taken care of by not playing bloodied or junkies.
---
Just saying, as somebody who plays casual and tried the PTS after hearing about the nerf, I completely disagree with OP. One Wasteland and the nerf (as they exist now) makes for a much worse game in my opinion.
---
I grind my coffee.
---
I grind my teeth.

I don't need any more grind in my life.

Anybody interested in helping each other out? I am on PS4 (n0stalg1x) and online around 10PM CEST. Sometimes in the morning, too.

The Chinese Stealth Suit really helps.
---
6700k, 16gb ddr4, 1080gaming x. Not a slouch pc. Fact is it ran stable and silky smooth before. Now its juddery garbage. My other games including FO4 arent having this issue. Ergo Bethesda is letting the game get worse.
---
There needs to be a gold skin for the combat shotgun to match all the other premium guns
---
I'm level 398, most time I'm doing that event alone. If the doggone npc's can actually kill something then I can prolly actually complete that event. Hell I went to do that event couple nights ago and I couldn't get it to start because the npc you have to interact with was running around, hiding while shooting at one of the turrets. I had to leave and go back to start that event. I have never seen that happen before since that event has been added.
---
Could be a return of the 'Battle of Whitesprings' sound bug. 
---
For a while, about a year ago, if you were in the vicinity of Whitesprings when the entrance was attacked, you'd get a persistent sound loop of the battle, with the Sentry Bots constant machine gun as the star attraction. 
---
This sound loop would persist through load screens, and continue even on the far side of the map, when in camp or in a vendor screen etc. 
---
For some it would stop if they zoned into a building like Al's Tattoo parlor. For others it would remain until they server hopped. 
---
But from what you describe, it sounded like a 'war zone' just with the constant drone of the .50 cal as the focus.
---
Theres a 3 reel in the nw prelobby. Go nutz
---
Just go grab 25 yourself, and hope they can keep at least one scavenger alive until you can get back up there to help defend.   Don't deposit that ore until there's only a minute left.

Thanks for helping me save my money guys. Much love to you all (not you Bethesda).
---
My bloodied commando build is garbage in the PTS, and my bloodied unarmed build had to switch to heavy guns. RIP bloodied power fist. It's insane that it went from my best weapon to me finding a suppressors multi purpose axe w more damage without any 2 handed melee perks. I'm all about rebalancing, I want the game to be fairer and more difficult, but making some builds totally useless as you mentioned hurts. I love unarmed weapons and unless they change something, they're going to be totally useless. Hopefully they take feedback into account and tweak the system to make it a little better. My commando died so many times at a colossal problem that I had a 60 second respawn timer. It was brutal.
---
Wow interesting, im looking forward to testing all the new damage differences. Have you tested tesla rifles or nuka colas by chance? I have a fear that they did not balance nuka colas and with less damage output im worried nobody will die. Already there are fights where almost nobody dies because they can't out DPS colas healing rate. Even with (literally) every damage buff.
---
I highly suspect that it looks better for them to have a lot of players log on every single day than a few players log on for a long time a few times a week. 
---
If you think about it from a business perspective, being able to say that you have X amount of people log on per day shows playing numbers and will therefore please shareholders.
---

---
That sounds like a reasonable ratio considering how many terrible ideas this community has been producing on this subreddit.
---
Simply because the community comes up with an idea doesn't inherently make it noble or healthy for the game.
---
A lot of the playerbase are incredibly short-sighted and protest from a place of selfishness rather than a place of genuine scrutiny that would produce a better game state, even to the detriment of their own experience purely out of ignorance.
---
Stripping away time gates and daily challenges, etc... would essentially gut the community after a couple weeks of people hyper-farming up scrip/bullion and getting literally everything they want out of the game and having no incentive to continue playing.
---
As nerve-racking as it can be to have to wait a day to take another shot at something you're chasing, it keeps you coming back and that's good for the game.
---
If the community dies, money dwindles, development slows, and the game ends up having no future.
---
All because "I want my god-rolled end-game gear sets and weapons NOW instead of LATER!"

100% need a cap casino. LOVE New Vegas. Let us exchange caps for casino chips 1:1. Say 30k max, no deposit limit, only withdrawal limit and let us play slots, roulette, cards, no caravan though xd.
---
Sounds like the deathclaw got a nice buff, this i welcome they need to be terrifying. The weak spot on a deathclaw is ita belly not thebhead. Dunno if you know that but it took me a while to figure it out.
---
How was the damage comparison for enemies in the forest? Ive read they only scale up to 25,so it might be a closer test since their DR will be much lower.
---
Just remeber it is a PTS, give them feedback over on the bethesda forum. Like others said before this formula is supposed to make balancing the game easier, so keep that in mind.
---
Sorry, but I don't have any tesla :(   
---
Nuka cola? Hmmm. Thanks for tip, I'll test it tommorow
---
All I have to say is it kinda makes sense. Before you hate (or go for it, its all opinions so it doesnt taint my koolaid) I think all other fallouts were a bit more difficult than this one. Sure the start can be rough with little ammo, caps, and mats, but thats what the communities for. The idea of one wasteland is to getting people to meet, run around in groups (not just show up for events then back to solo) and experience the wasteland together as one. I think it'll bring a challenge back to the series. And again, they just released the pts, I'm sure theres bound to be more adjustments coming. Boom, thats it ~Mic drop~.....~picks Mic back up~ Sorry if that was too rough ~sets mic down gently~
---
I'm sure you have... From my own personal experience though I believe the game to be excellent value and I really do enjoy playing it.
---
When I look at other games they are either poor graphics, poor characters or an awful interface and overly complex to play.
---
Fallout 76 is a bit laggy and drawn out at times but.. It is what it is and for the hours I put in against the cost I what say that's  a good "bang for your buck"

Just my opinion, obviously yours differs

And the auto complete bug proved a fair few of them right. So...uh....vindication?

Legendary perveyor is kinda like a casino... except you  lose 99% of the time.. and you know your gunna lose, but you do it anyways becuase youve reached your script limit

I agree in fallout's engine, they'd be a challenge (especially the impending reload animation), but I know a version of this exists in mod form for fo4. I thought it would be good, since my western revolver does about half the damage of a lever action, it'd be great if I could squeeze off 12 rounds in the time it  takes to fire 6 1/2. Plus, it would look crazy cool for roleplaying. By the way, this idea came to me when I saw someone selling a ffr lever action; like how does that work?  Faster reload would be useful, ffr seems a bit pointless.
---
But shirley they have to go to each one and set the ammo type? Who's got time for that?
---
I wouldn't go that far; maybe that could be a legendary perk.
---
Mods? What are those?
---
Might be old news, might get deleted from here but this is the first I've heard about it and now I'm stoked! 
---
So thanks OP!
---
Ngl, that'd make quad, a useful legendary effect.
---
What's up with 2 handed melee? Genuinely asking - I switched my unarmed to 2 handed and got decent (not great) damage on bloodied 2 handed weapons. Unarmed was god awful, but 2 handed for me seemed ok comparatively across the board. Am I missing something?
---
I just want to ride a Deathclaw into battle...
---
Those would be fun. More expansion of missions/daily quests for each faction would be nice. Also a mission where I drop Ward into a fissure site would be lovely as well.
---
Lot of internet keyboard warriors out there
---
That sounds bad üòÖ
---
The problem I think is that hunter‚Äôs Gatling
---
\&gt;  Why can't we just have a mailbox or an account wide stashbox 
---
Frankly, I suspect the answer is because you need to grind more/longer if you can only use the weapons that drop on this character instead of transferring them to an alt whose build is a better fit. In other words, it's the same reason why we do not have a global in-game player market but can only trade with the people on the same server and need out-of-game resources like Discord or market subs to facilitate a trade.
---
Thanks I shall give that a try.
---
That's just another bug amongst a lot of bugs in the game. They were complaining about not being able to achieve it even with a perfect run.
---
Pay them, probably.
---
Infiltrator, radiation and agility is what my character level will allow. I saw the original set of perks and got a set of legendary light combat armor only for that perk to get scrapped.
---
A crime instantly giving you a 1k bounty, agreed
---
They hid it well... I found it a few days ago.
---
If the queen is aggroed to something, you might see some big numbers on your screen but you are not doing sneak damage
---
I've heard this several times and completely support it. 
---
If they really wanted to, they could do a cool mini quest line for a new crafting table for canning... a la Nukashine and the brewing station...
---
But even a low effort, ammo converter type thing would be enough. Feed it cans, which can then be used to preserve meals.
---
...also yes, different foods should spoil differently.

It's strange that they didn't acquire the rights to the mod. I would do that. In the fourth part, Bethesda dragged the New Vegas mod into her game without any rights, what was stopping them now?
---
I mostly find them in Harper's Ferry too but never at robot vendors. I think you can get them from pails/holiday gifts too (  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P21&amp;formids=0059CAD1-0059CAF5](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P21&amp;formids=0059CAD1-0059CAF5)  ) or from other players.
---
People playing a video game with so many bugs and issues cannot really be expected to play in isolation and just suffer in silence. It is human nature to want to share experiences, good or bad, it helps one deal with bad things and celebrate the good.
---
Deathclaw Island was so disappointing. It's such a cool name and it feels like it's gonna be terrifying... instead there's an incredibly sickly and ineffective Deathclaw who gets slapped few times and  falls over and dies. 
---
Definitely needs a buff -- Deathclaws used to be 'oh shit' moments, but this one is so pathetic it's hard not to feel sorry for it.
---
Did you not do settler questline? They are all assholes you should know that by now. If you are not convinced, go have a chat with Ward and tell me how it went
---
Sorry i misread . English not my language üòÅ
---
That thing they promised with fallout first! I think its been a year.
---
They scrap at Marigold Pavillion during a random encounter, you get some rep with Settlers for murdering your Raider friends :-)
---
If they want more money to improve server stability, they can just sell extra stash space for atoms :p
---
Okay I get that... I‚Äôm asking what is better?  Any weapon I‚Äôve ever used in the game has never one shot killed anything high level.
---
They are forms of currency you will get introduced to as you progress through the game.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_scrip
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_bullion
---
You're cool bro, no problem üòéüëç
---
Got a specific build?
---
3 minutes on the PTS means 15+ minutes in a casual setting
---
if that is the baseline for a "fast fight" then I'd guess and say 25 minute SBQ fights will be normal for casual players
---
I think they have limits because to make it harder exploiters to exploit huge amounts of scrip and bullion. It would be cool to see a increase in limit
---
I bash this game pretty often üòÖ
---
Really helpful, I appreciate the images too. üòé
---
Or at least an atomic wedgie, I mean the fact thats not in any fallout game just puzzles me. That with a couple back of the shirt over the head hockey punches would keep Ward in his place
---
The SBQ does not scale. This has not only been datamined but also been conclusively tested. But there are factors other than stealth that may play a role. E.g. she won't land (and will thus stay largely out of weapon range) when she gets staggered - more people shooting at her means more chances of this happening. She also won't land if she aggros on someone and then can't land near that character and attack them with melee. Again, more chances of that happening when there are more people around.
---
It is very in good in here at times.  Sure there are lots of frustration posts of recent.  But they are mostly all valid points.  Sometimes for the game to get better we need to get our point across.
---
The only thing that can help this is Bethesda giving more communication.  Like the new event launching today won't hit consoles.  Sure they made a post on their forums, but most players use this as a community hub.  
---
I love this game.  It has its flaws but the game has brought me hours of fun and memories.
---
True, but then they should do something to the horrible RNG to prevent players from endlessly cycling through scrip -- getting a really specific high-tier item is neigh impossible without trading, and for those items, you need god rolls too.
---
I've been lucky with trades, but it's taken me a year to acquire the items I wanted. That's way too long.
---
And I'd also like to point out that after I've gotten the items I've been playing the game considerably more because I'm actually enjoying myself.
---
Yeah that's what they've done before with the caps limit when people got rightfully upset. 
---
Come on Bethesda
---
It's because armor, or in this case energy resistance is extremely effective against low damage per hit weapons, such as gatling laser. Beforehand you could bump the damage per shot to overcome this design flaw in the damage resistance system but now they are gonna be shit on a stick
---
Wich platform are you on ? you should look for an armor piercing faster fire rate  ( or furious ffr ) if you don't have ( want ) a specific build.
---
You are quite optimized and know a bit about the game. Food builds do not invest on rifleman perks or covert operative. Might do 1/1/1 on rifleman but that's as far as they will go and they are not hit with the nerf.
---
yeah that‚Äôs true, should‚Äôve realized that :)
---
Missed opportunities
---
Agreed, every limit should go. 
---
Caps, ammo &amp; bullion are already worthless in trading. Only item to item trades for anything desirable (and even then, you risk being scammed because there's no 2 party verifying trade window...)
---
If you want to be able to one shot things or atleast kill them extremely fast, You need to base your build around the weapons you are using and then further specialise into that weapon type by using one with a good prefix, if you dont wanna go junkies or bloodied, then Anti Armour, Furious or Executioners would be better than your Hunters gatling plasma. As a high STR build you could also look at melee or shotguns for high damge output potential. A shotgun build with a Gauss Shotgun can dish out pretty good damage in events. Fact of the matter is if you go for a QoL build, instead of a damage based build, then you lose damage in Combat. You're basically just trading QoL in combat with QoL in everything else.
---
No, I‚Äôve never utilized a build...I guess that may be the issue.  I came to this game as a Fallout fan without MMO knowledge so I focused on carry weight.  I have legendary armor pieces and weapons but none of them match. I also don‚Äôt utilize many combat perk cards.  I guess this is my true issue.
---
There's so many mods, though. Realistically, fallout 4 is like 30 games in one.
---
\- Watoga Transit Station ground floor and up the elevator right around the corner.
---
\- Robot vendors
---
\- Bubbles at The Whitespring hotel upper floor.
---
I dont mind other people milking in though. 
---
Can we get a milkers stool for the brahmin please?
---
Most perks you need to select. You may get your wish in a card pack but don't count on it. I finally obtained the perk cards that I wanted for all the different things I do around level 92, without moving my special around after level 50. Do some events and you'll be able to play with those toys soon enough
---
If you got good all points on strength you can make a some what heavy build if not I suggest a bloodied stealth even tho it‚Äôs getting nerfed I doubt it‚Äôs gonna be burnt to the grown
---
It's possible to glitch the spawn points so the waves drop in right in front of the emitter but it needs someone with the tent to be there, it can't just happen by itself. It does make gaining XP quite difficult however for anyone that doesn't have an area of effect stule weapon as the waves get butchered rapidly.
---
I saw it being done a couple of times during the XP week but I've not seen it since. I'm not sure if Bethesda has commented directly on it but I think it's maybe considered by them as being in exploit territory.
---
Of the highest caliber too
---
"Hey Ward I have your Stolen object! Please put a padlock to Your magazine"
---
"I would prefer that violence is not the only solution"
---
Yes.
---
But to workaround that issue, select the wall and use the option to replace it. Switch it to a regular wall. Add your wallpaper and then switch it back to shutters.
---
It is how facebook touts its numbers to shareholders. You can prove active accounts by the number of logins. But yeah I would rather watch ads than be subject to use limits. Imagine facebook/twitter only giving you 3 posts or messages a day?
---
Haha. Nice. 
---
How about an event though!
---
What about people who chose the raiders vs those who chose the settlers. 
---
We can settle this raider vs settler debate. ;)
---
Exactly this
---
Huh so Demo expert works now? Interesting. Wonder how legacy explosive gauss rifles and non-legacy normal rifles compare
---
Great!  Thank you!! I‚Äôm seeing that not having a clear build is working to my detriment. Everything is a learning process!
---
Put your brahmim above ground level.
---
It should def be a crime.
---
Has been working since wasetlanders. I have no clue on that one though
---
A lot of my friends and I have fallout 1st and we have no need to buy extra atoms. Because you don't need to get everything in this game to have fun playing it. Nobody is forcing anybody to play or buy. When I have to many legendary's and can't script them , I just sell them and if that doesn't work anymore , then I just trow them away. I don't feel bad about it. Why the need to script, sell, buy and owning everything is something I don't understand. (Sorry but English isn't my native language so I hope you can understand what I'm saying)
---
Well no. Like i said an mmo halo akin to foxhole. And i didnt say a cod with somewhat rpg elements or in an apocalyptic city.
---
How much longer for BOS or everything?
---
1 big BOS mission and then a bunch of missions for another faction
---
I'm not in the PTS so can't check for the new tables. They depend on how good you complete the event. 
---
For the last Meat Week, for example, the best rewards gave some plans with 9% and 2.2% chance. I hear there are new items that can drop so I'd expect lower chances for anything. I'd bet the usual people from the datamining discord will post a nice spreadsheet showing the possible chances.
---

---
i didnt say it has all of them you lemon
---
Had a similar problem. After a launcher patch it couldn't find the game anymore. Support only could tell me to reinstall the game. But at least the exe is still there to start it
---
If camp pets were this easy to achieve, literally everyone and their neighbours would have assaultrons and deathclaws running around their camps.
---
It would quickly get boring, devalue it all, and just make the whole thing less unique. I'm not saying I'm against the mechanic, but don't make it this easy, and this accessible. Make us work for it.
---
Lol now you‚Äôre stretching it brotatoe. Wanting pvp to work isn‚Äôt demanding they be done. Here I am wanting a civil discourse but if you have to put words in my mouth to make your comments sound bigger then I‚Äôm not getting it. Saying, I said I want it cause my main is on PS4? Never said that. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre not reading my other replies just the ones to you and it shows. We all paid for this game and because you no like pvp doesn‚Äôt give you the right to take it from others. Bitching about pvp when pve player are just as shit lol. Having to put words in my mouth to try and pump up your comments. Sad, oh so sad.
---
How can you regulate that? A high end department store marks up a piece of furniture by 210% from factory cost. Every 3 three weeks they offer a discount 50% and the rest of the time offer a 20% off. Yet the price point was set by the store in the first place. What can a law do to prevent this situation?
---
Soo they couldn't delay the game, but can delay almost every fix/event..... Hmm. nice double standards Beth
---
When my friends played the game, they always got annoyed at not killing things quickly. I always told them, its all about your build. They never really learned and slowly stopped playing the game
---
I'll gladly drop Sofia's headache lines for a wandering merchant that's is always in my camp
---
Yeah dude i feel you. I have so many leftover treasury notes i dont know what to do with them. Not to mention script... my inventory is literally filled with 3 stars. I have to put them in my shops just to get rid of them. I have a problem with letting go valuable objects in games. And 40-50 script is good for me. I don't play much but that is my one gripe with the game. Also the ammo converter. It's useless in my opinion. You would have better luck scrapping materials to make ammo then sell it at your vending shop. I logged in one day for 5 minutes and i instantly got 3,000 caps in a single transaction. I keep my ammo count at just over 10k so a lot of traffic comes my way!
---
Everything - thanks
---
Again, this is this casual players perspective. I play with people I know in real life. Any other time, I'll show up to help in events and then go back to doing my thing. I am pretty sure, in that regard, I represent at least half the player base.
---
All that aside, your argument boggles my mind. Successful enterprises don't try to get their user base to do anything. That's  how to fail. McDonalds didn't get to where they were by trying to make their customers go Vegan. You make products that your user base wants. 
---
Fallout 76 initially sucked hard because they tried to turn the Fallout user base into PVPers. This was a bunch of people who liked single player story driven open world content. How stupid was that? Let me be clear: It was extremely stupid. 
---
If the idea behind one wasteland is indeed what you say (It seems like everyone's take-away is different), the FO76 team is alarmingly stupid. They haven't learned their lesson, and probably never will.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one...
---
Ok so now i need second wheel
---
Get it for a month see what you think. A year is a long time.
---
That is on Sony and Microsoft. They require special validation so stuff like PTS isn't as easy.
---
I return because I still have fun with my friend's helping new players and talking to each other, even if I completed everything. And when I don't feel like playing , I do something else.  No body is forcing you to come everyday , only your feeling that you have to own everything and collect everything makes you feel bad when you can't play every day. I was the same when I played HS and it makes me so unhappy that I stop playing that game after more then 4 years. And I learned that when I don't have fun , I stop playing.
---
With the wise words of my wife. If the game frustrates you , stop playing.üòÅüòÅ
---
750 gold for that? Lolz
---
Can you lend me the money, i promise i¬¥ll pay you back - *Laugs in raiderish*
---
Just make a pvp discord and do a pvp meet. Why do you have to have Bethesda do something about it? You can still pvp fine ffs nothing's stopping you. This is the promlem with pvpers. They think they are entitled to something and think every single game should have pvp
---
Looking at your post upvotes seems to be the telling story you are just crying in the wind.
---
Yeah it's boring, but since changes to the general tables means that the event rewards include also The Fixer, Bear Arms, Gauss Guns, SS Armor, asf, I think it's worth to grind it.
---
I agree wholeheartedly, part of the enjoyment of f76 (2 years playing) was starting out with that frisson of absolute fear and trepidation venturing south, into the mire and cranberry bog, and having to really think about how to stay alive, complete the quests and progress. This included what perks to consider first and what kind of "special "  character to create. I am lvl 305 currently,  only switched recently to a middling bloodied set up using my original full health mode which I have stayed with since passing lvl 50, supporting dual shotgun/ commando with the option for heavy weapons with power armour when necessary. While the jury remains out until the patch is released, I am not filled with anticipation and excitement at the likely outcome and can see me giving up on f76. The legendary run was a horrible grind, with disappointing rewards, wastelanders was a move in the right direction to maintain interest, however horribly flawed by the reputation grind. Encountered interesting bug yesterday, passing through Camp Mclintock triggered main quest "basic training"...long since done. Annoyed also I seem to have lost my military photo pose, hard won in the past. Maybe I'm getting the chance to do again......not.
---
Nuclear winter
---
If you do i will actually give you gold, okay so let me run it down for you. Use cola nut rank 2 (thats max). Now, the 3 most common used are orange, quantums and grapes.
---
 A nuka cola can stack its effect up to 3 times when spammed, each. So if you spam 3 of each cola you will have 9 total cola effects active all at once. Its best to test with sent/ass armor and a tesla quad or bloodied.
---
It makes me log off even though I want to play more. There is just no point after I hit the cap.
---
I've got a tent myself tho and it doesn't happen to me! Must just be lucky!
---
Plus have you done any missions for the overseer and the wastelanders questline already?
---
I max out at 410. I'm carrying around 304 poinds on the norm.
---
I have a kidney I'm not using if that'll sweeten the deal
---
Good point.
---
scaling to only 25 is not intended
---
Not yet - waiting to finish main quest
---
Stop playing
---
So is nerd rage constantly going off?
---
I'm pretty sure special stacked the same. at least str for melee weapons did.
---
unfortunately I'm unable to install the PTS but I've been following the reports and people said the xp from unyielding has been nerfed.
---
That.. would be fun. And hilarious. üòÇ
---
I found the Dildonian museum in game recently... It's exactly what it sounds like... Even has a family price for admission!
---
I want that one with the little metal camper (backwoods bungalow maybe?) Because they fixed the issue with the walls the day after the bundle went out of the shop recently. I didn't buy it because it had been broken for so long... Go figure.
---
It reminds me of a suggestion box we had at work - dusty with ancient suggestions never seen or considered. A black hole.
---
My gf loves that bed
---
Yup. I've seen this far too many times and it's genuinely concerning. I mean how addicted are these people? I thought Destiny's 2 sunset decision was trash along with the garbage seasons made me uninstall and play something else, why are these people incapable of taking a break if it's that bad?
---
Most people I've seen on the PTS are veteran players. Veterans are much more likely to have legacies. A live server will be likely be vastly different. 
---
I've seen plenty of magic weapons on the PTS, are you sure that fight didn't have one?
---
Well, about incentives. Thats why they need to up their game and give us more content. There's so much they can do and they dropped the ball very hard time and time again. Removing those limits won't inherently change the game for the worse. Really is no reason to have those limits.
---
At 19% health is constant yes
---
A smaller pet type deathclaw would be neat since no matter what most players builds will melt a deathclaw but realistically i think that would be something we get in the atom shop instead of a reward drop
---
They have a random shoot out in the northern most cranberry bog forest. You can help a side and get rep if they are the last ones standing.
---
Maybe if the standalone terminal has the same functionality as fo4, you can do it from 1 place
---
Doesn‚Äôt that get annoying? The little pip-boy animation like he‚Äôs hulking out?
---
&gt; Sounds like the deathclaw got a nice buff, this i welcome they need to be terrifying.
---
I don't disagree. Deathclaws should be the most deadly thing on the ground. I personally can think of many other land units on FO76 that I am a lot more careful around (like yao gai, assaultrons, etc).
---
My only complaint is the difficulty curve from 91 to 100. It wasn't a curve as much as it was a vertical line. And, end the end, quite boring. Killed it by sniping it and relocating as it ran away from 50 pts of damage at extreme range.
---
So the level 91, while quite a bit less terrifying, was more interesting to fight, since I could go toe to toe with it on the ground. The one wasteland version was boring as hell because I had to kill it via the death of a thousand cuts method as it ran away.
---
Which would you prefer?
---
I ran into bunch of one-wasteland Col. Gutsys and and Assaultron dominators at one of the missile bases. That was terrifying to escape, and then tedious as hell to snipe at extreme range.
---
Maybe you should visit [nukesdragon](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and fill out which perks you use at the moment and then post the resulting link here - you will get suggestions how to improve it for sure. 
---
In my experience it is very hard to mess up a char so much it isn't playable/viable in FO76. Add some info about your playstyle (PA yes/no, weapon preference...) as well.
---
It needs an appropriate reward for the effort. Getting a 1 star rolling pin and some flux is not an ok reward for thousands of rounds of ammo of 10+ minutes of work (more if you launched the nuke).
---
No because at 19% it procs and stays on. It doesn‚Äôt proc more than once
---
I would actually say its no longer a matter of opinion and plainly a matter of fact that a game is bad when it runs as poorly as 76. You claim other games have worse graphics, yet on an i7 processor and 2060ti video card I often walk into areas with textures fully not loaded, enemies being invisible (as well as many objects), and the game crashes or bare minimum goes Not Responding 100% of the time when I use it after fast traveling.
---
76 is a compelling timesink. In the few weeks I've played it, I can't say it hasn't given me plenty of reason to come back to it; however, out of all the AAA PC games I've played in the last decade, this one runs easily the worst post-launch, second worst if you count Dishonored 2 on launch (but that was an incredibly odd bug that got fixed, not just a poorly made and optimized game.)
---
I could see your case *maybe* if the game ran like a game from 2018 and not like something chugging along on a Dreamcast, but as is any bits of quality, at least for me, are immediately ruled out by its devastatingly poor performance.
---
Needs explosive bait...
---
Did you report the player and take screen shots that would give evidence?
---
Scrip is what you get if you turn in a Legendary (1, 2, or 3-star) weapon or armour piece at the Legendary machines at the rail stations. These can then be taken to The Rusty Pick and traded at the Purveyor for a randomly-generated Legendary version of an item you already know the plan for. Bullion is another currency you encounter when you finish the Wastelander content, that you get from certain quests and events and can trade in for plans to build your own legendary weapons and armour.
---
Ahhh, ok. Some people call me crazy but I actually run nerd rage on both my full health builds... kind of a back up plan. It‚Äôs saved my ass more times than I can count
---
I had to drop 3 legacy gat plasmas last night to transfer to a mule. Then drop 10k rounds for my main again, then swap back... Gets me on edge that shit ü§£. We need it, it's stupid not having it in a a game like this.
---
Yep, that's how it's done. That or have an IRL friend hold the stuff you want to switch while you log off and back on with the mule.
---
Alternately, some people buy a second copy of the game and run it on another machine.
---
Just to make sure - you do know you can select a card from any special category at a level up, not only the ones the game suggests to pick?
---
I can't get my head around it.
---
When I saw what Bethesda planned for the seasons I uninstalled. It's a grind and it's not enjoyable let alone truly playable. Initially I stayed because I liked the community, everyone helped everyone and I got to a stage where I was helping others. It wasn't like a shooter where everyone's screaming at everyone, people genuinely wanted to be nice and help.
---
I hope there are changes as I've been a Bethesda fan boy for years but this game completely and utterly destroyed that. Also Fallout 4 didn't help lol
---
NW isn't anything to do with it, it occurs even without NW being played!
---
Level 20
---
Side note Todd Howard and Pete Hines need to step down.
---
There's a couple of quests from the og story that you will need to complete, have you gone to see the overseer yet? She will point you in the right direction
---
Does this include Legends?
---
Yeah if you are close to a legendary enemy and your team mate kills it you can still get loot from it
---
I might have done it with 3 and would have accwpted a suspension, but this conpromised the whole server, affecting other players. He should have at least paid 1st and went to a private world  and even then, e perma ban would be more than adequate
---
I should have been a bit clearer sorry - it has to be used and deployed in a certain manner to make the bug appear, just having someone there who has the tent won't impact the event. Hence why it's something that needs to be deliberately triggered.
---
There is a trick where you can blueprint the ammo factory and then put it in a camp or workshop. I do this myself occasionally (Wade airport is the best spot due to open space) but I only make 5 at a time (max you can run off one fusion generator). This guy in the photo has taken it to an over the top level.
---
Anytime after level 20. You also have to complete the inoculation on yourself and you won‚Äôt progress until completing Signal Strength for Rose from the main quest. Also if you‚Äôre following the Settlers you‚Äôll need to complete the Motherlode mission at Hornwright Industries. Have fun!
---
Not having a build and your weapon are both hurting you immensely. Without a proper weapon and the build to back it up you will always lag behind
---
Add me on Xbox, I lack a mic (mostly use the Xbox app to type messages) but if I see you online I'd be happy to bring some firepower &amp; ammo for your weapons
---
I've found these at Ward Airport a couple of times including a few weeks ago when I took it over and walked away with about 50,000k rounds of .45 and 5mm after an hour or so. 
---
I'd never built Ward Airport before, thought this was just a special feature as the Ammo maker isn't AFAIK available anywhere else. Is this an exploit?
---
I'm sure they'll fix that, eventually.
---
Yes this. But I'll be happy if they just give us back the inventory sorting from oblivion.
---
Making it easier to gets God rolls isn't the point, again getting that perfect roll is another long term goal for people to reach for. A bigger problem is how much people focus on the concept of the God rolls in the first place. No one NEEDS a bloodied melee with both swing speed and strength to kill stuff but people still treat them as the end all of melee weapons they need and are willing to pay tens of thousands of caps for.
---
I have missing link , flavors of mayhem , strenght in numbers &amp; the new arrivals under main .
---
New arrivals says get to lvl 20 even though im soon lvl 32
---
Did that ignored as usual
---
And everyone fucked the end
---
You somehow forgot the legendary run??
---
Legacies aren't very good for SBQ because she has a very high resistance against energy and explosive damage. They are god tier for pretty much every other enemy type but not scorchbeasts. Optimized bloodied and "magic" on the other hand, though...
---
Went to Uranium Fever once and everyone just tagged the first legendary with a pipe gun. Nobody killed it - we all just stood around looking at each other. 
---
If ever there was a time for a laughing emote that was it.
---
They didn't nerf your **pistol** build they nerfed the **bloodied** part, which gave you the bulk of the damage. Because the bloodied and junkies relies on a lot of multipliers. This is true for all weapons, even switchblade is viable with that. 
---
***And that's the thing about this nerf, nobody should be able to kill end game boss with inferior weapon!***
---
Ahahahahahaha entitled coming from the lady that wants an actual feature in the game completely removed and done with pissing off other people who may want to all because some pvpers did her dirty. Not that sounds entitled. Why would I ask BGS to fix something already in their game? This can‚Äôt be a real question. If I could pvp fine then there would be no need to post this.....Again if you would‚Äôve paid attention, I. Don‚Äôt. Pvp. I suggested something that could help open up players to something, while also giving the people who want to pvp a way to. My bad for trying to look out for the community as a whole and not some selfish chick trying to scream loud enough until she gets what she wants.
---
I not adding limited time skins, I am specifically adding the base game skins to this list. I will make a sub-list at the bottom for limited time skins, thank you for reminding me!
---
First of all, mcdonalds doesnt make its customers go vegan because their a burger joint, terrible comparison. But they do have fake meat burgers to satisfy those customers right?(honestly dont know, dont eat there but I'm sure ive heard something about that). Glad we cleared that up.
---
Secondly, I do the same, I play with one or two others I know irl, but I now know so much more online fallout fans from public teams, you know, the other system they implemented to try to bump up the multiplayer feel. And now I hop on and play with them as well whenever my other friends are busy.
---
Lastly, Bethesda made a multiplayer game for that reason, and events like rad rumble and riding shotgun is the way it is because they want people working together and talking more, playing more as a team, they said that temselves so I dont see this any differently. Remember when they said one wasteland is so that a level 300 and a level 20 could fight the same thing and feel the same amount of challenge, yeah well I think that was exactly what they're getting at. I feel like your missing everything they say when they talk about one wasteland
---
So I'm gonna say it again, I'm sure things will change in the pts as it always has. Sorry if this post also chaps your cheeks, but maybe the wasteland is too much for you, sucks seeing another one go because of a bit of an overeaction, but you do you my friend
---
This is an utter fucking joke. I am so fucking tired of your shit Bethesda. I know it‚Äôs only a couple of days for us console users but the constant delays for EVERYTHING IN THIS FUCKING GAME is exhausting.
---
Hmm got some unusual connecting to server issues lately with no reason, maybe time to check out some workshop occasionally...
---
You've still got a fair bit to go, if you haven't done Wastelanders (as per your post below) then you're still in for a decent ride depending on how slow you take it. As far as your current quest line goes, you still have to meet/find another faction and do some things for them, that could take you a while depending on how you go about it too. Enjoy the ride man, I was much lower level than you by the time I had consumed all of the quests and I kind of regret it.
---
I still dont get why they ever even put a cap on any of it. Its not like there is a functioning economy in the game. Just let people farm
---
i have just 4 of them at my camp, and they just bug out all the time and amke about 150 10mm and 50 of the ammo type i want, they messed up my power system and now half of my camp doesn't work properly, how the hell has he managed to make this many work is what im wondering
---
Thanks. I try. I shoot for flexibility via Perk loadout Manager. With those special stats I can have a couple good types of builds (sniper, heavy guns/PA, crafter, burglar, etc).
---
I've toyed with the idea of dropping rifleman down like you said to move points to agility for a bit more flexibility.
---
A pvp event for factions, yes please god howard yesssss!!!
---
That is insanity. You say you counted 167 machines, at 20 power each, that guy would need over 33 fusion generators to power them all. I'm surprised this server functioned at all. The sheer time it would take to set this up and collect all the ammo hardly seems worth it. How much ammo could he possibly need? Imagine if they all got to 100 ammo, thats 16,700 rounds. He must have alts that do nothing but store ammo. This game is too grindy as it is, farming ammo like that is too much like work.
---
5 is extreme too since it is exploit that not all of us willing to take advantage of. Cheating is never acceptable in an online game. There are plenty of tips and tricks on how to farm the components to make ammo that may take you a bit more time, but will be much more satisfying.
---
The AR has very low recoil and insanely fast reload. That said it needs a slight damage boost imo. Maybe let it shoot giant mags of 5mm to set it apart from the combat and handmade. Idk
---
I had a Bloody faster fire version that shredded enemies.
---
I'm a fan of the box in the back room of the Slocum's Joe near the Overseer's CAMP...
---
You got that shit right
---
Instead of giving us a 16 day grind to buy the plans for SS chest and jet pack and *pretending* its content, give us *real* content. Repeatable, difficult (but not ridiculous) Heist missions and that kind of thing.
---
But you‚Äôre a responder!
---
We already have a stash extension by paying for their subscription. We don't need them to monetise stash space further.
---
I can't stand these poser tryhards that think they have any say in how you play and where you should drop. Gonna drop directly on the mine every time, all the time now lol.
---
&gt; she's landing just one sec gotta get in the pip boy and re equipt the magic nade... 
---
How can you know about bloodied build, but not about hot keys? Or whatever the weapon wheel is on console....
---
Same. Last night was the first time I was frustrated with this game. I didn‚Äôt know it was double score weekend so I‚Äôll grind and probably finish before the weekends over.
---
Yeah the last big update buggered it.
---
‚ÄúSlightly worse than a Flu virus‚Äù? 
---
Oh. You‚Äôre one of *those* people. The ones that don‚Äôt understand how bad COVID is and think it‚Äôs just gonna blow over if you don‚Äôt get excited. Right. Got nothing to talk to you about. Glad our interaction has only been via text on a screen and hope to hell that is forever how it stays.
---
Yeah it's a massive risk luckily you didn't lose them
---
God, I have a story in regards to player owned Brahmin...
---
There was this guy running around, being a regular douche, swatting at people with his small wiener death claw, or mole miner gauntlet (can‚Äôt remember). This guy was level~250+, and I‚Äôm about 99% sure running a bloody, or food build. He went to multiple camps looking for a fight, as I saw first hand at a few I was shopping at. 
---
Let‚Äôs jump to me now... After some time passed, same server,  I was running my lowly player shop, and he shows up. I bet he was poking around for a fight for a good 10 minutes. I wasn‚Äôt having it (PVP is absolutely not my thing in FO76), but I did jostle him up quite a bit, giving the ole trusty thumbs down emote, followed by the angry face. I was getting a kick out of how it was really getting to him that he couldn‚Äôt bother me... until he found my Brahmin that is.
---
He finally let up on me, and ran around back of my base, killed bessie, and walked off. Now, I was legitimately pissed. I followed him down the road, and did the angry emote, followed by the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù. He obliged, and followed me all the way back to Bessies corpse. I stood there, motioned to the body, and wanted to clarify what I was talking about, so I shot at the ground near Bessie. 
---
That‚Äôs where I messed up... My dumb ass had a Tesla rifle equipped that did splash damage, and it hurt him. He then proceeded to swat me, killing me in one fatal blow...
---
The icing on the cake was I could then see a camera angle in where he was demolishing very important things in my camp. I did not have enough time to respawn before he got all of my vending machines, and my fusion generator. If you have never lost a vending machine, you have to reset everything inside it...and it sucks major ass. I had 4 fully stocked ones. I ended up powering down the Xbox to not lose more of my camp. 
---
Moral of the story, something about a glass house, and stones or something. Also, remember splash damage is a thing, and it affects more and more people daily! #splashdamageawareness
---
Idk it works well on sbq
---
I don't know if it's a bug, every time an enemy kills me and it's just me around, when I come back it's full health.
---
Ok. Ok. You still haven‚Äôt explained why they can teleport. The technology simply doesn‚Äôt exist yet. And why aren‚Äôt Fallout 4 mole rats like this? In theory they should be 190 years more advanced therefore more dangerous.
---
Yeh I get nervous, in case of a crash or someone finding it. I have a spot now though, always making sure characters are at the same location.
---
Lost a B1025 a while back but luckily the guy was decent and handed it back, so I gave him an Explosive mini gun.
---
Ooooooo good advice!
---
I think 400 scrip per day is pretty fair. That's 10 three star weapons and realistically it should take quite a while to farm those up every day. Heck, even if it took 2 or 3 days to clear out your stash, you'd eventually be sitting pretty good.
---
I'd be ok with 40 treasury notes per day too. Thats 400 bullion a day which is quite a bit.
---
I just play with my gf and pur friends. Randos are whack.  They'll kick you for the dumbest shit.
---
Since you can‚Äôt exceed 15 in any given Special, I barely have any need for it. Maybe get 2 extra CHR if it means I can start sharing perks. Aside from that my Heavy build has everything it needs - except more strength lol
---
Now the Infiltrator and Rad Resist perks? I‚Äôm all over that!
---
If you are already running other mutations then adrenal reaction is handy too for the same purpose.
---
This would also solve a lot of stash limit problems for people hold on to scrip legendaries.
---
Iirc, neither organisation exists yet. The Institute has existed even pre-War, but they‚Äôre nowhere near as sophisticated and advanced as in 4 yet.
---
Dont forget the ammo cost to non fallout 1st members. stash limit means junk limits and ammo making limits if we are burning through three or four times the ammo its going to be hard on non 1st member to keep up with the ammo needs. while that's fine for many high level players since buying ammo is easier right now then making it all it takes is one dupe glitch and vendors are down for a few weeks while they patch it. with melee becoming a joke in damage that is unrealistic to use in pts heavy weapons having heavy ammo needs your looking at an even smaller pool of guns that will be useful after the patch if it goes out as is
---
Yeah nobody actually needs even 1\* legendaries to kill stuff in this game, but the RPG scene and their players are notorious that if a certain item exists in the game they want it, it's their personal goal.
---
TBH the whole multi-star legendaries was a bad idea, I would've been happy with 1\* legendary items
---
Yup, I admit we only used vendor prices to learn cultural differences, not day to day pricing.
---
Day to day pricing is very contextual and depends on your location. PvPers should VPN to Japan for cheap gear. Everyone else should VPN to Japan so sell livesaving sentinels, one of the most expensive armors there. There's no way to manually gather meaningful data from regional markets and build a global price out of these.
---
The tool came to life after I purchased BE15r combat rifle for 1200 caps from vendor of a guy that used nonlegendary fixer as his main weapon, and "didn't play bloodied". I learned that when I found him on map to give him rest of the caps I had on me, so I wouldn't feel shitty, as I already had enormous collection of BE rifles. The tool was made to prevent godrolls being sold for pennies by noobs to sharks.
---
Such criticism mainly proves that there's much to learn for "veteran" players who think "vendor hunting" for items is something else than a lottery. Mainly, that the best grounds to sell items for good prices are outside the game.
---
I have a certain spot but usually I just have someone I know hold them for me
---
You can. If they‚Äôre all connected, you just have to find that one terminal that works. It‚Äôs never just the first or last terminal in the chain so it can be a pain in the ass to change ammo type. And when there‚Äôs an interruption in the flow (one gets blown up or a generator is blown up), it changes which terminal you access.
---
I literally stop playing the game once I cant scrip legendaries. I move to something else for the rest of the day
---
Updated with nuclear winter ranked rewards and legendary rewards.
---
Yeah same here
---
dude what is "scrip"?
---
Pay another new monthly fee in $ and they will remove them
---
Only there is a problem. Now the boss can be killed with any weapon. After a nerf, he can ONLY be killed with a carbine or a machine gun. Doesn't it suggest any thoughts?
---
I don't think you'll find much sympathy here for exploiting.
---
Even if they do that, surely they will put a limit on how many legendaries u can get in a day, so it will be even worse now cause u have to not only login every day but also play the game to get those legendaries similar to daily quests.
---
Everyone understands that this is the goal but content doesn't just fall out of the sky.
---
They have to develop the content and it doesn't happen overnight.
---
Time gates are a placeholder or a bridge in an attempt to keep interest in the game so that other things can work their way down the pipeline.
---
We have to temper our anxiousness as a community and be patient.
---
I get it, it's long overdue and it's not fair that you've all had to wait as long as you have or that you're essentially being penalized because of how terrible a start the game had but that's just the reality we're in.
---
I actually never use the purveyor unless it‚Äôs for the modules
---
Well now I've hit 100 score I haven't logged in for a few days, sure I've got Beckett's quest line to finish and gold to grind but if the game feels like a chore then it becomes a chore...
---
‚ÄúTake action on the next tip. Just do it.‚Äù
---
Setup is pretty quick once you‚Äôve done it a few times. I can usually place about 100, connect them all to power, and find the ammo type console in about 45 minutes. Then if I stay in the same session, I can do dailies, collect ammo, do some events, collect ammo, build for fun, collect ammo, SBQ, collect ammo, fly across the map for fun, collect ammo, etc. It‚Äôs really not a bad day of playing actually
---
I've seen it at multiple workshops, so would have to assume it is not a workshop specific exploit, as others pointed out FLAT build area. I take this on a pvt server to test out builds that are experimental before putting in my camp.BUT....For some reason they seem to use this exploit in less active ones. Maybe to avoid reports?seen it, myself, at Red rocket, sods and can't remember the other one?
---
Bloodied or Junkies, a good Junkies build will never die in PVE. Bloodied to if you know what you're doing. Use Nukes&amp;Dragons to find out about builds or ask here. I'd help more but barely have time to trade with kids running around.
---
Are you on PC? I have an extra...
---
I want them to increase the cap of scrip to 240, make it so 1 and 2 Star armor is 4 and 10 scrips per so we can divide evenly every time with a little good easy math, and lastly make it so Saturday the limits on everything reset every 8 hours instead so on the day most people can play they can get a ton, upwards of 720
---
Want me to donate supplies? Give everyone a scrap box....... Otherwise no.... Haven't got stash space for over 200 supplies
---
I think most people would be completely fine with opt-in PVP like the post describes.
---
I think I've established why those limitations are in the game already.
---
Your saying that there's no reason doesn't really validate the claim that there is no reason.
---
There's a very obvious reason.
---
There isn't much content in the game presently.
---
Chasing god-rolled end-game gear is the progression loop that keeps players playing the game.
---
The limitations are there to ensure you don't just grind for 100 hours consecutively, get everything you want, get bored and leave.
---
You're bitching about the limitations being in the game but at least you're still playing the game and that's good for Bethesda.
---
Even if you, personally, aren't contributing money to Bethesda by playing.  Your being on the server, populating the world, gives tremendous value to the game state for the community.
---
When people feel as though a playerbase for any particular game is dead, games will rarely survive it.
---
They can't fix a game if they have no revenue and if they don't have a community, they get no money.
---
They need people playing and this is an efficient way of doing it.
---
Maybe some day the game will have enough robust content to draw back the limitations or even remove them entirely but that's probably not going to be any time soon.
---
Would this be possible for one acid farm at my base? And would this be frowned upon if I did it?
---
didn't expect to get any sympathy, just saying that it bugs everything up and im legit wondering how the hell did he get this to work
---
THANKS FOR YOUR SUGGESTION
---
I'LL SPEAK TO THE TEAM ABOUT POSSIBLE ATOM SHOP LIMIT EXTENSIONS
---
THANKS AND HAVE FUN

You only say that cause you've never pvped seriously. There's a saying, 'War is very sweet to those who have never tried it'
---
Was in a super laggy server and eventual came across something similar at a workshop. Didnt realize it was an exploit
---
First we must explain to them how playing a game actually differs from grinding tiresomely!
---
All the quest and event rewards are trash, every legendary gear we craft after hours of grinding is also trash. Its so frustrating.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with xp. If you don‚Äôt shoot you shouldn‚Äôt get xp. Loot is already shared though.
---
Because she really wanted you to shoot them!
---
I agree. I gave it a chance when it dropped on game pass but it still has so many issues that I stopped playing early on. If the game is much more stable and less buggy, it could be a pretty decent game that can hold up with Fallout 4.
---
I'd be more lenient in the game if it was free to play but that isn't saying much due to the issues.
---
I got 99 problems but a colossal ain‚Äôt one......today anyways
---
I thought there was a new stein as well.
---
Auto grenade launcher is how.
---
I did not know this.
---
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again ... Unlimited scrip turn in limited daily scrip rolls . Would free up strain on the servers and free up stash space .
---
Gatling lasers are weak. I only carry one just in case i run out of ammo. Grab a .50 cal (quests from becket give you a good one) or maybe a gatling gun (uses 5mm ammo like the minigun, super slow but much better per shot damage). 
---
In general, i use the gatling gun for killing ghouls with the least used ammo (as far as heavy weapons are concerned). The .50 cal and plasma gatling for more dangerous enemies and bosses.
---
 In rad rumble i use enforcer perk and a shotgun to disable the ghouls to delay the spawn of new mobs as more ore is collected.
---
they don't actually care what people want.
---
So you did get done dirty by someone. I see where the rage comes from. You‚Äôre right I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôd like to if it was in a better way. I‚Äôm sure many others would too. Just because you came from that side and didn‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt mean take it away from people who want to see it get better. Things can be fix and people will always be toxic no matter what, that is no reason to quit tho. And using a war saying to describe pvp in 76 lol. There‚Äôs a saying, ‚Äòjust because something doesn‚Äôt work for you doesn‚Äôt mean you can take it away from other‚Äô-Elmo.
---
i allways found it odd that out of all the fallout games so far, 
---
the one where we represent the best and the brightest 
---
we all start as absolute dumb, uncharismatic, blind, unlucky weaklings
---
Bethesda only sell hope and expectations. The goal is not even to improve the gameplay anymore but to suck out as much money out of the current game as possible. Good believers will be able to push more money and think everything will be fixed, but will be disappointed one after another. I played first 2 months and saw the direction where game was going. Fallout is really good and interesting world, but Bethesda is more interested to cash with it than creating a good game.
---
Bloodied is life, nerf or not!!!
---
Why does a free states bunker have a caged skeleton?
---
Lucky us they delayed it again for console players. No meat week, no windigo.
---
It's a great analogy as long as the neighbours car is downgraded to a lawnmower.
---
 Bethesda is a fucking sad mistake of a company
---
Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs a few new things this time. A chally costume and head, a grill plan, and the tenderizer plan
---
Yup I shouldn‚Äôt have bought the game before I knew it had this many problems. I joined on Xbox and the servers were a ghost town
---
True, but doing it at the same time as the legendary perk BS is .... well, BS.
---
Now we, need to choose between getting legendary perks or a re-spec. Or even starting a new char ... again.
---
I'm really curious to see how the changes will affect my build. Full health PA junkie's heavy gunner. I'm not even fully spec'd for damage but can easily murder anything and currently the only things that do any real damage to me are the imposter sheepsquatch's laser (usually while I'm the conduit for all 3 pylons) and to a lesser extent the alpha in project paradise meleeing me.
---
You are the first person I‚Äôve ever saw with this issue lol. I‚Äôve only saw people saying the bouillon limit is too low.
---
I have been playing at reset and nothing happened, seems to be random.
---
I would like to agree with this but I can not I would like the game to be more difficult but I do not see how making me have to shot someone more times adds any challenge at all. The pts is still just as easy as the game is now just more frustrating that with an LMG it can take 18 .308 bullets to kill a super mutant. That does not add any difficulty I still do not get in any close calls all that does is make shooting them feel like a chore when a .308 bullet feels like a nerf dart. how about they just make the enemies do more damage or have armor piercing of some kind or smarter AI so they do not just wait for you to shoot them in a corner or anything hundreds of other games use for real difficulty, but just making it take more time is a really cheap tactic to make a fake sense of difficulty.
---
Limits like this is due to their lack of ability to deal with dupes, I doubt they will ever go away.
---
Good to know, thanks for info!
---
because that's what she is? What is even the point of fighting her if she takes too long to kill? The rewards are garbage.
---
They'll add it to the fallout 1st shhh
---
Hello there, I believe this is already known but I'll send it over. Thanks!
---
1. They want daily login (even for 1 minute) for concurrent player statistics. This is the number that drives sales.
---
2. A lot of people duplicated treasury notes/legendary weapons and could basically just put them all in and max gold/scrip instantly. This is a bonus to having such small daily limits.
---
Every vault has a secret purpose that was nearly always nefarious in nature.
---
Maybe we were told we were the best and brightest but we‚Äôre absolute fucking idiots?
---
Nah, auto grenade launcher comes with 12 rounds,  which would still be 2x the ammo capacity on a drum magazined M79.
---
It also reloads the entire box at once, while the drum would be reloaded one at a time, like the single action revolver.
---
AGL would still be the top tier grenade launcher. But while we‚Äôre on the matter, that one could also use some mods. Basically all non-energy heavy weapons need more mods tbh üëÄ
---
Me too - I actually had 2 rifleman builds with slight differences between them. Respeced 1 to Commando, and moved my good lever rifles over to the other. 
---
Now I'm going to have respec, or mothball, the other ... a level \~150 mule :(

---
You mean 10 .308 rounds from a magic LMG later?
---
No no no no. Everyone's dirty. Did I not say I was in a pvp group? My group offered me duped strangler heart full set so I took it. Then they offered me hacked weapons so I took it. I went for a test run and I was like fuck it I ain't playing with this abomination nor do I want to be on a taking side so I dumped everything and quit pvp for good. They also wanted me to run aimbots which I refused. I seen a lot more than you did so scram. It all fun and good until someone whips out a nuke shotgun
---
They could have put the limits at spending scrips, like 200 per day aka two 3-star legendaries etc. rather than obtaining...for bullions maybe 2 items per day
---
This is known and expected. There's no workaround. If you leave combat she heals.
---
Impressive, i miss the options we had in fo4. I‚Äôve build a machine which playes the stupid raider basketball game for me in fo4.
---
Wheres the link saying it got pushed back again?
---
There is no incentive to play now yet, people play. Time gating is a stupid idea only overseers would enforce.  People should be free to enjoy the game how they when they want.  Bethesda can't fix dupes so they put silly Gates in place to mitigate the damage. How many people complain daily about broken heavy weapons , 6 months still not fixed
---
sad
---
Sounds about right lol
---
Well, I did. As i said - it didn't took *me* longer than like 45 minutes. Most of the time 25-30 to finish every daily (except some NW ones, those I skip). 
---
Legendaries: Check if West Tek if cleared, then check whitesprings, then check some fissures. Normally done by that. Also look out for specific Events that have guaranteed legendaries. 
---
It sometimes takes a couple of minutes. On the other hand buying 3 items from a player, eating food 5 times, take a photo etc etc takes like 30 seconds to complete for each.

You‚Äôre playing like a bloodied build and are expecting to one shot enemies vis stealth sniping, You say you‚Äôre casual but a casual player like I who takes whatever perks are humorous &amp; relies on the base damage stats of weapons is going to be fine with one wasteland because our build are adaptable, You basically sound like another bloodied build player with a gripe but are pretending you‚Äôre a casual player.
---
She become mad with the headache
---
Idk about you but I always crank that charisma to 10 then luck to 10
---
Honestly when I first started playing I felt like Treasury Notes were getting rained upon me and I couldn't cash them in fast enough. Now for some reason I'm struggling to get 20 a day before I have to hop offline. Maybe it's simply the time constraint and not so much the lack of abundance
---
No, meaning you get no NW mods at all, there is no private server NW
---
Hey, if you say so, maybe its not as daunting as it appears. I find it funny that you admit to dropping 100 of these where a chucklehead above called me a  cheater for building 5 of them. Go figure, right?
---
Why so cryptic? Lol
---
What about a furious super sledge with 40pa?
---
Changes will be monitored so they can be released to console towards the end of the week. Fair trade off its still coming this week.
---
Ha fo76 issues go brrrrr.
---
Could not agree more it is nice to add difficulty to the game but making it take more time to kill something rather then adding real difficulty is just a cheap tactic that takes no time to implement so it is a fast band aid fix because if it takes a long time it must be harder right? no it just makes it feel like a chore.
---
You get 6 just from the settler and raider daily........you must be the only one with this  problem

been a while since i leveled up but i think i didnt power through certain special stats but rather mixed it up a bit üòÖ

It prob was the server I was on. I seem to always join server after the queen event is over but I will always look to see if players are down there and if not I still go check. I know I went and checked when I first went but just mutants and gulpers so I left. I ended up joining the event for the defend the turrets. I do my thing and a three star beast spawns I hurry up tag it but I see another player is shooting closer to the grove. So when it dies I run over and I see there must‚Äôve been a colossus that‚Äôs went towards player being it was dead there. Well I said screw it I‚Äôll go check out the trees. I vats the colossus and I wave players. And for ten minutes we bring it out of nuke zone and take it down. This is the six fight with one I‚Äôve done. The last four times I‚Äôve kept the sacs and have them on a display with just balls underneath. But this was on Xbox and it was fun until the end when all I got was a stupid two star raider arm. But oh well, I was so excited for today then a hour after me killing the colossus I read on Reddit that for consoles the event is delayed until end of week. I‚Äôm pissed this is bull and this is coming from someone that defended this game since beta. It‚Äôs complete bullshit to consistently get told a day before the event is supposed to go live that it won‚Äôt.

Nice!

This is where my 'Forest Gun' comes in handy - tag 'em and emote 'come here'!
---
I love my Supressors, Explosive, Reduced Weight 10mm pistol.
---
Everyone should have a 'Forest Gun'!
---
Scorched around Morgan airport seem to have a high drop rate for me
---
I see thanx for the info
---
Just sick of the delays.
---
I agree I can't wait to start exploring the whole map again. now that everything's leveled.  i play a stealth rifleman so i expect the damage buff may be an issue however I only use the  Rifleman perk cards (60% extra damage) covert operative (2.5x damage) and Adrenaline x 3 (+6% damage per kill) with an instigating lever action so I'm not really sure how it affects me.
---
This is not a bug. All opponents are healed if you try to kill them solo and die in battle.
---
It is also healed if it flies too far from the battlefield, but this can be avoided - you just need to shoot at it more often, causing at least some damage.
---
The machine gun is one of the simplest builds for destroying an SBQ solo :) I killed her with a pistol.
---
Yep people are ungrateful. Sad to see this sub become like most of all the other gaming related subs just complaining.
---
I‚Äôve just learned to quit caring what white knights of this sub think
---
Thanks, I see this one pop up from time to time but can't ever pinpoint it. Is there a way to trigger it? I'd grind it just for the legendaries
---
Ah damm was looking forward to play it after work
---
It‚Äôs been like this forever. That‚Äôs why I still don‚Äôt feel like doing it solo. Only time any beast won‚Äôt heal if you die is if they‚Äôre attacking another enemy like mutants or robots or whatever else is shooting them. That‚Äôs they only way it won‚Äôt regenerate
---
You can't equip more cards than 15

Honestly you‚Äôre probably right. With some of the theory‚Äôs about vault tecs involvement in the war it‚Äôd make sense to hand the future of America to a bunch of morons. But naturally as with most vaults it completely failed and somehow we‚Äôre succeeding.
---
I also have a "Blue" excavator paint that I use.
---
Sounds like a job. No thanks. I'm going up keep doing whatever odds and ends feel fun that day.
---
Maybe clear Watoga, or Westek or go kill some scorch beasts. Top out the week with a silo run with some friends.
---
Blue camo also works on excavator
---
Yes, when u go to Big Bend Tunnel East there‚Äôs a guy Vinny in a suit. Kinda looks like a mobster. Talk to him and he‚Äôll give u the option to start the event. It does have a cool down so if someone else just did it u won‚Äôt be able to for an hour I think, but u can server hop or if u have fo1st private world until it starts for u.
---
We‚Äôre not getting it. Someone will post the link and show that Bethesda said only of today
---
That‚Äôs what happened to the last tax collector? üòÇ
---
Connect it to a normal terminal and use that, it hugging out and producing something else is probably someone sneaking in to change it! Lights have been breaking since patch 21,not your fault that is on Bethesda!
---
That is awesome, I do have 1st so I'm gonna give it a shot - thank you!
---
I swear I see this every other day
---
Someone posted earlier with the link to Bethesda stating console won't get it, only PC on the 18th. Persoannly I think it's so they can have a wider audience test it rather than just a few on PTS, then release a more polished version for the console... Just a theory.
---
This game's core concept is flawed and on top of it there's a horrible engine it's built upon.
---
TBH instead of asking for a FF14 treatment we should hope that bethesda will learn from this game in order to make the next one better.
---
Complaining about something doesn't mean anything other than you're complaining.  Simply because you complained about it, doesn't mean it's a problem or that your proposed solutions are viable.
---
Also, some things can't be fixed whether pragmatically or literally.  As a literal example if there's something about the engine the game is developed on makes it functionally impossible to employ a fix for a certain bug.  As a pragmatic example if removing hacked weapons/duped weapons from the community meant they'd have to strip ALL equipment from ALL players in the community, most people would be against it.
---
"Time gating is a stupid idea" is a subjective claim about your personal feelings towards it and has nothing to do with whether or not it works.
---
Clearly it does.  It's serving its function; to curb progression.  That's inherently why people are complaining about the limitations.  They can't farm an infinite amount of those resources and craft an infinite amount of those items to obtain the rolls they want.
---
"People should be free to enjoy the game how they ( want? ) when they want" Wrong.
---
This is pure non-sense.
---
This is a business.  Bethesda has employees.  Bethesda has to make money or those people don't have jobs.
---
Sometimes what players want runs contrary to that fact.
---
If Bethesda feels that these time limits are necessary to maintain an adequate playerbase to fund the further development of the game so that they can make a profit and keep the doors open, then so be it.
---
I'm sure that they're not doing it purely out of the intent of pissing people off.  Generally what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  You want to pander to your playerbase and give them a product they enjoy through and through but sometimes certain circumstances prevent that from happening.
---
Gods forbid making them a useful change for once. Something that actually fits a payed game and not something lifted over from a shitty F2P game.
---
That would be a good feature. I hope in time they implement that.
---
This is my rifle and this is my gun.  One is for shooting and one is for fun
---
I assume you use strength for other perks than damage. Unarmed only takes 3 perk points. With melee and unarmed melee mutations I'm able to kill most things in one hit with instigating knuckles. And kill just about anything in one hit with instigating power fist while sneaking and/or power attacking. I prefer the knuckles, they weigh nothing, cheap to repair and the power fist is just to op for me.
---
I also carry a 90%rw 10mm auto pistol for tagging enemies (and legendaries), it can be a real pain in the arse when every enemy you run up to gets shot dead just before you can reach them in events.
---
EVERYTHING IS GETTING NERFED, not just bloodied, early game players will suffer the most as they have less ammo and worse gear!
---
And semi auto weapons. Go commando and those 4 shots are a blink of an eye. Not really a bullet sponge just using the wrong weapon. Hate that they‚Äôre making rifleman unviable but it‚Äôs better than picking up a pipe rifle as it is now and wreaking havoc lmao to me it just seems like people are gonna have to start trying, using tactics, strategies and thinking about how to go about certain situations. I am excited for this change where as other people seem like they can‚Äôt be bothered to play the game without one shotting enemies.
---
No and very frowned upon. Its a server killer, lags out the game intensely.
---
Tyvm, not sure if these are on the list as well;
---
- Unmoddable camo secret service under armour 
---
- when u die in nuclear winter and go back into adventure mode u can go out of bounds 
---
- favourting the fireworks makes you reload way faster even without the faster reload perk or perk cards
---
I hear ya bub. I don't need to be lectured on how to play this game. The ammo factory is an easily blueprinted in game machine. Its not an exploit like game-breaking duping which does something the game was not intended to do. 
---
Think I'll go build a few more ammo machines right now...üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised he doesn‚Äôt.
---
I completely agree with you on the idea of treating this like FF14. But I think something that would fix a big issue that I heard a lot at the games announcement that it would be online only is to make the online optional. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love playing with other people. Watching them help each other and grow is awesome and makes me feel good in the community. But I like many others enjoyed the solitary part of the previous games. I say scrap the current version, buffer and clean up basic problems that would plague a single player version, carry those fixes to the multiplayer element then fix those and bam a good clean game to appease both sides.
---
Thanks I'll update it.
---
Your actions lag and cripple servers more than they do naturally ruining gameplay for low level players.
---
Can't do this with acid extractors
---
Apparently, consoles also have different certification processes. Sony/ Microsoft have to "pass" any new updates before they can be implemented in game.
---
Agreed...These are things that should be unlockable through playing the game. imagine if instead we unlocked certain face paints, hairstyles, weapon skins and armor skins based on the faction(s) we choose to support in our adv...

Seems like they could have an account-wide stash like the scrapbox. Any of your characters can add to or remove from the stash, which transfers it from your character's inventory to the account inventory, like the regular stash. Given that only one character can be logged in at any given time this seems within the means of the engine.
---
When I logged on last night there was a message top right stating "... New update coming to pc tomorrow", I'm on Xbox, so I thought it a little weird it was specifically saying pc.
---
That's because the floating damage numbers and the actual hit location don't match up. For example. You see a headshot damage but the health goes down normally. Other times, you shoot their chest, see the normal damage but they die as if headshotted.

technically mew content can be llayed right out of the vault, with the Wayward questline being a new tutorial of sorts. to play the actual Wastelanders questlime you need to be level 20, and have gotten innoculated and met Rose. if you didnt do these, the Overseer will tell you to do it before you can do the quest.
---
Do you play earlier an 9pm
---
I honestly prefer fallout 4.
---
Exactly. Bethesda has known about the ammo factories for months and has yet to do anything about them in updates or even acknowledged it as a glitch or bug. No one has been banned. Hell, I even have ‚Äúfree ammo‚Äù in neon letters all over the workshops I place them at, I don‚Äôt care to share. But people will still find a reason to complain about any and everything. 
---
Do it!
---
&gt;They should have had expansion content by now or new areas, instead we barely get base game improved upon.
---
You are right here, the map is getting stale and they need to expand our reach.
---
You get the increased damage from Demo Expert.
---
However, you only get the AoE if you don't have a suppressor attached.
---
It‚Äôs to prevent griefing but in actual fact, that only serves as an even better reason to facilitate their death.

Dude it feels like a job, but I have this unhealthy completionist mentality and I can‚Äôt not do it every day. But as soon as lock down ends for me I will be ejecting the disc for good.  I cannot give this game the time it requires, maintain a career, relationship and a life all at the same time. But the purpose of the post was to hopefully help those that can devote the time to this ‚Äòfree to play mobile game dressed up as an mmo‚Äô. I wish I could play it like you described but my brain won‚Äôt allow it.
---
Here I'm at level 70 with 150 hours in the game and I don't even understand what's that in the photo in the first place lol
---
What about the grafton steel helmet?
---
They didn't fix magic guns, heck they're the only viable weapons anymore as every build is now useless!
---
So you being apart of the problem before and seeing the worst of it means the rest of us need to have any form of pvp taken? This is one mighty entitled child here. You not having fun does not mean you can bitch and moan and try to berate anyone who might enjoy this feature and take it from others. That‚Äôs some Karen shit right there. All your talking points have been about how you feel and what happened to you and not one of making it better so people don‚Äôt go through what you went through, it‚Äôs thinking like that gets people wanting to whip out a nuke shotgun on you. Your current pvp exp. it not the same as the one that could be. Jump off the hate all pvp bandwagon and think more big picture. Be for the people, not for yourself.
---
I think a lot of people check to see it other people are there before they join events. I go to events I want to do and wait for more players. I think it helps if they see someone is already there and they aren't going to be alone.
---
It's definitely a good change, it's just not the full picture. They just did a good job bringing down stuff that needed to be brought down, now they need to raise up things that need to be raised up as well
---
Imagine if the Prize-Bot would show up an hour or so later with everything you left behind... "I'm so glad I finally caught up with you..."
---
Ok , im doing the Rose quest now .

You have to actually select them when leveling up. You have access to them all at each level up. If you never selected them, they won‚Äôt appear in your ‚Äúdeck‚Äù
---
Wrong they nerfed EVERYTHING!
---
For real. I can‚Äôt believe people call this game a mmo when it doesn‚Äôt have a fraction of the mmo systems pso has.
---
My mistake then, I thought that suit was blue/yellow like the ones the scavengers wear
---
Or the equivalent. It‚Äôs was an example using a unit of measure. Like a Flamingo Unit.
---

---
Strength got nerfed, its why melee got hit harder than everything else!
---
I believe there technically is a cap at level 1000. But that's a ridiculous amount of exp required per level, only a min-maxed bloodied build grinding all day will be able to get levels anywhere near consistently at that point
---
Then you need to go talk to the overseer to start Wastelanders.
---
I had no idea these were an exploit, and this explains so much. I have run into a couple of CAMPs with these, and will make sure I look at reporting any others I find.
---
I wish! ;p
---
Because you also got hit you now need 10 times the ammo.
---
Server stability and longevity of the gene are pros for *both* parties. 
---
And I view the **overall situation**, not just from one side.

No. We got NW. They didn't take away everything. Just the ones that's causing problems
---
Did you look on nexus? Nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods
---
The grafton steel helmet isn't a skin as much as it is a unique armour piece. The hellfir and mach 1-3 are the ones I mentioned but I don't know the names as I only have images to pull from.

Ah that was a /s I am a console pleb. We were promised mod support too with first.

Screws - I am a financial auditor by trade, but I learned how to size/make screw from scrap metal in middle school.  How can this be the rarest junk?

The current meta needs reworking, This is a good building block, Ppl will adapt, I too am also excited, Yeah it sucks for certain builds but having to exploit game design to one shot enemies isn‚Äôt how it should be played, Right now it‚Äôs like everyone is running around with a 007 golden gun one shotting things &amp; it‚Äôs not fun for anyone else.
---
If you use damage perks or weapon mods you got nerfed!
---
I know. It seems to go in phases. I went weeks without seeing it.
---
Are you on Xbox? I can put aside some for you when I next find it.
---
Very true.
---
You got that right, except I am not flushing $10 down the toilet when I can travel to my tent and hoard all the materials I want without worrying about weight.  Maybe Mom and dad don't want to put out the $10 for little Jerry as he sits in the basement playing games all day when he should be paying attention to his eLearning classes?

If only Sofia would take note and do the same.

Because the we got raiders aren't raiders. They didn't even get mad when I double crossed them and took all the gold and got the fancy dude killed, on purpose. They keep on telling me how they aren't really bad people and how everybody's welkome. I was hoping they were trying to lure me into a false sense of security and that the other shoe was going to drop but, but... nothing.
---
I digress, faction warfare would be fun. Specially if you incorporate the build mode. Build a fortress, tower defence and defend it from hordes of the opposing faction.

This work on workshop right?!? Who know how many ppl running servers pravite server full of it

this is not an airport. you dont need to announce your departure.

Yep. I really hate the asshole statement that "devs don't play the game". They do play the game. But what the devs want to do with the game and what the management/publisher wants to do with the game can be vastly different ideas.
---
Coming into this game from FO4 and seeing the build mechanics made me want to pull my hair out. Some of the changes are just bizarre, and it's hard to see the reasons behind many of them. In the end I managed to build a nice camp in spite of it, but it can be seriously frustrating. You have my empathy.
---
Dude I‚Äôve had the hardest damn time finding aluminum lately. Like before the recent update I could find it everywhere but now I can never find it
---
Yeah especially since apparently the stash limitations were supposedly because the engine couldn't handle infinite ones but then the scrapbox came out and that's infinite
---
Now, for a limited time only in the ATOM Shop for a low, low, cost of 1200 ATOMs, you buy a Raider Mailbox! Use it transfer items between characters^(\*) or send another player a lovely note. Get yours now!

In the same vain as yourself, you don‚Äôt want pvp in your adventure, but myself and others would like some stable and fun adventure in our pvp. Agree to disagree I guess. I did enjoy this back and forth though. May your rng be godrolls my child. Praise the holy Mothman.
---
XBox, and thank you for the offer.
---
I don't think I have ever seen anyone in that.
---
Is it really considered a nerf or a rebalancing of the whole game  ?!? 
---
The top dps build will still be the top 
---
A few years ago zenimax did the same thing with eso and rebalance the stamina/hp/magicka cap and nobody called it a nerf 
---
Wow is doing the same with the lvl squash in the upcoming expansion pack
---
i didnt think you were be able to actively get the perk again if its only available at pevel 1 and you got it. did you maybe get a duplicate from a perk card pack?
---
regardless, when the legenday perk system comes out, you can sell the duplicates for "perk coins" to help level up your legemdary perks. so, i wouldnt call it a total waste.
---
The Scorch Queast Bean
---
This is the way
---
Well, you still have just about a few days to change your mind. The event is only releasing on PC today. Console is released later this week.
---
It doesn't stop progression. Progression is RNG based my first drop or my 10,000,000,000 could be a good tier roll. People should be limited to 1.5 rerolls per day.
---
My suggestion would be to Craft some level 20 leather armor to cover your limbs that you‚Äôve given up on maintaining. You can repair them pretty easily not having to use ballistic fiber in the process. In fact, I believe it‚Äôs actually cheaper to craft than repair. A while back, I would just craft lower level armor when I was short on materials for repair.
---
i just go to her house?
---
How many machines was it? A friend of mine placed one at my camp and I couldn't delete it so had to reset my camp and it didn't go into storage or save as a blueprint because I wasn't the one who placed it. (So I'm guessing) It didn't even appear as a blueprint thankfully. I did the reset in a private server dunno if that helps.
---
the way bonuses stack got changed. and the more the bonuses, the bigger the nerf. which is why melee got hit hard.
---
like I said I can't test it myself but I don't see why int would use a different/old calculation method considering str doesn't. unless it's specific to melee weapons and doesn't reflect 'real world' usage.
---
but reports indicate that the way int, and special as whole really, stack, has indeed been changed as well, meaning xp has been nerfed for bloodied builds.
---
and maybe dont aim on the enemies with tesla? teslas damage is based on bouncing from walls/floors. Jesus thats unbearable to watch
---
If they're using the exploit they have the time, and don't call me Shirley.
---
Is that available at Taco Bell?
---
I thought you unlock the skin once you loot it?
---
Get yourself a jetpack and explore. You can scale so many places you never could before!!
---
Mr. Bean?
---
Hey im not saying I condone the current execution, it 110% needs more work. Im just saying that having a multiplying formula is a nightmare for the devs overall, its literally impossible to balance it well without botching the content the game provides or build variety. Hopefully theyll actually fix the unarmed weapons before this rolls out.
---
Can someone please explain why pistols would be dealing less damage? Also 4-5 shots is doesn't sound too bad with a 10mm that's like 2sec
---
I wish they would port over some of the stuff from 4. There's a ton of pip boy skins/power armor paints, clothing, etc.
---
Pretty much. Once you‚Äôre past level 20 you just need to talk to her to kick things off.
---
It's sad that you are downvoted by armchair developers who have no idea what an engine is. You dared to go against the circlejerk and no facts can save you from their ire. This right here is why they don't pay attention to reddit and our misguided outrages.

I've two characters, both 160+, and I've no clue what's happening here.

Use this [Character Build Planner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to plan out your build - will help you figure out what perks to get and when
---
Why ask this question? Bethesda doesn‚Äôt even have floors at their offices.
---
Bullshit. They have real coders, stop being an asshole. As another "real coder" I can say that this game has all the signs of mismanaged product that is low on resources. Been there, seen that.
---
Also, the game is faaaaar from trash. If it was trash, nobody would bother playing it.
---
 Two, maybe three extractors. I almost immediately moved the CAMP but that didn't help.

I heard -yes I know- that moving your camp multie times in quick succession(make sure you dont have the thing placed before doing this) CAN eventually clear up the ghost budget(source: I've seen 3 posts where this solution was offered, 1 guy I think responded that it worked)

All of their games are broken to an extent given the engine issue. There are major bugs in Skyrim and Fallout 3/4 that do actively harm the game in such a way as to prevent it working. There is a flaw on the ps4 that can cause games to auto-corrupt save files following about 3 hours of playing, specifically started happening after the CC updated. It's why I cannot play fallout 4 on that console anymore.
---
All of Bethesdas games are really outdated in terms of both combat and movement mechanics. They've always been years behind their competitors. It's the stories and quests that have made their games well defined and playable.
---
Fallout 76, though fun, is quite literally shit. In terms on mechanics and actual gameplay it is unrefined. I enjoy it but daily caps, broken armour skins in the atom store, first person issues relating to magazine upgrades for the minigun blocking your screen, glitched quests (the final wastelanders one is a good example), and more define the game as shitty.
---
76 is a game I enjoy a lot, but it is by definition shitty.
---
What the literal fuck? This PC?
---
It's fine after level 50.  Before then until you spend the points you technically have not leveled up.  If a perk unlocks at level 21 for example and you are level 25 with 5 unused points, you are technically only at level 20 and do not have access to the level 21 perk.
---
Gatling lasers are definitely not weak if your build is spec'd right. I use mine all the time.
---
This is bad because now a pistol needs 2 shots to kill a super mutant. Carbines on PTS kill from 1-2 shots, even on the machine, on live - from one, even without a headshot.
---
Roughly speaking, now the pistol can destroy most of the ordinary enemies with 2 stealth shots to the head. This is a perfectly acceptable result. On PTS, 4-5 shots are required.
---
The carbine kills everyone with a shot. On PTS - 1-3 shots are needed.
---
The carbine on the PTS is still capable of killing any enemy, the pistol is not.
---
I don't believe so as I haven't seen that, though I will need to check that shortly. If you can test it on your side I would appreciate it so I can double check.
---
If you put your camp on an acid pit, you'll automatically get access to an acid extractor. No exploits required.

---
It's not just the damage nerf that's the issue, it's the compounding effect. Longer TTKs mean more ammo spent, more durability hits, more actual time invested repairing and grinding for the SAME amount of resources. The higher level mobs do not drop more resources, it's the exact same loot/quantity for junk/weapons/armour. The extra experience you're looking forward too will most likely be less per hour of play, as the max level mobs on the PTS are bullet sponges. Everything about this adjustment is about lengthening the grind and devaluing your time invest in the game.
---
And then there is the viability factor of stealth/one hit kill builds that really on massive risk vs reward management. Instead of expanding the list of viable builds, this change will only shorten that list devaluing even more weapons and armour.
---
If people keep playing their games and giving them money despite these issues, Bethesda has no incentive to change their ways.
---
Beans Scorched the Queen.

Yes, it is an exploit

Is there something I am missing? Had a general douche come to my camp and I remembered the bait thing people had talked about. Ran to some radstags, back to my base to craft some explosive bait and found the guy's camp. I chuckled which turned into maniacal laughted as I sent the first piece flying into his camp.... Then I sat there for 5 minuted as it did nothing. No explosion, no damage, nothing until I just left defeated.
---
I understand the damage has been reduced but did they just reduce pistol damage or is it because of the bloody nerf?
---
Damn, I should probably quit bitching about it and just do it lol. Fallout is awesome anyway so it's not like I won't enjoy it
---
Gotta say I was disappointed was expecting a 500%+ camp budget camp not an ammo farm.   
---
I am curious though as to why it would lag the server. It has a budget like everything else so if it is within the 100% range the server shouldn't suffer lag maybe if you are near it or are the owner I could see.   
---
I built a camp once a long time ago that took 5 full minutes for it appear for most people if you fast traveled to it you would crash 90% of the time. The budget was so high it was unreadable that was back when we had the camp door glitch, which I did 22 times at full budget.
---
Can we just revert all the "fixes" and just have Ward as he was? It just seems like Bethesda is wasting resourcing on a problem they lack the competence to solve.
---
This is like, what, Ward's third fix and we're pretty much no better off overall than where we started?
---
Well for pc today at noon.  Consoles in 2 days
---
Awesome, it worked! Thanks so much!
---
His biggest complaint was marsupial.  Starched genes comes last.
---
there's a glitch where you can blueprint the ammo machine from the converted munitions factory. each one of those things is pumping out most likely 200 5.56 rounds every 20 minutes
---
Put on scrapper and kill every super mutant you see and scrap their lasers we will get there even without bethesdas help
---
I'm glad I moved on to Wow Classic, there is less grinding there it seems lol.
---
They do get to cook the meat which gives a buff to carrying capacity 20lbs or 25 lbs i forgot
---
Hope you stole everything and then reported :)
---
But for weapons there's already legendaries for Scorched, Super Mutants, and Ghouls.
---
Really? It used to not work on her
---
I take it Fallout 4 coop would not have made you happy.
---
Only karma and endangerol work i think
---
The transition from colonel Sanders to Agent 47 was not expected.
---
A suggestion: You can use Spotify in the background while gaming. I do it on my PS4 all the time. It works on Xbox as well. Just turn down the volume on world radios. You can make a playlist of stuff you might want to hear in game. You can also control Spotify from your phone while gaming. I got really tired of the in game radios real quick. Also, there is definitely music out there that is in public domain they could add to the game. 
---
I personally can't deal with a lot of the in game sounds (chronic migraines) so I just turned all sounds off and turned on subtitles. I am usually in a party with friends and I adjust Spotify to a level I'm comfortable at. Depending on what system you are on, there might be other options for music too.
---
You are only supposed to be able to make one ammo factory at a time from one of the workshops but people have found a way to dupe it using blue prints so will create this monstrosity to churn out ammo for themselves. Lags the sever and will help tank what‚Äôs left of the ammo economy. All round a bit naughty.
---
Will do. Thanks Man. The Fallout 76 Community is full of  school spirit. Go Team!!!
---
UPVOTE bc I'm pretty sure it isn't and I'd like to see where this goes lol
---
Yes.  But check out what Bethesda is doing on any given day on their website.  If they are hot fixing servers, like they will be doing this Thursday for the new event, you will lose your stuff because you wont be able to get back to the same private server.
---
Marsupial
---
I mean we can build a 10mm pistol out of a handful of screwdrivers and an office fan I'd say we're quite capable really
---
I run a low health junkies, kind of a hybrid between bloodied and junkies that personally I think is better than either; it wouldn‚Äôt be hard at all to adapt to use that weapon and still have all the bloodied advantages when needed.
---
It's all modifier nerf - junkie, bloodied, mutant, etc. But pistols is weak and with that nerf it's will be unplayable
---
If it's not the Hoe of Destruction it's not worth keeping.
---
Hey man office fans are deadly. Especially if you say you don‚Äôt like the show.
---
Yup the legendary perks with damage buffs just got worthless. They nerf the damage and then add another grindy as fuck so you can climb back to where you were previously.
---
"Fun". Oh and I won't be using my ultracite ammo until this thing is either reverted or addressed in another way, no way it's worth spending on anything the game will throw at you.
---
I have so many freaking repair kits from the season event, and improved repair kits from killing the scorchbeast queen that I don't even bother with bench repair anymore. Have to use them or they will become a weight problem.
---
Console is live at same time is it not? It's Meat Week that's in two days.
---
Yeah so get a pvp discord and do a meet.
---
Dupe exploiters are good to go but you‚Äôre satan, apparently.
---
Have a source on this? I was a little worried that it was intended.
---
It sounds like single hit weapons got hit the hardest. Same scenario with an instigating /furious fixer wouldn't be nearly as bad due to rate of fire
---
Spot on OP
---
Consoles were delayed
---
Alright , tyvm
---
This, this is another key point that will piss of people. I've been building my bloodied character for 1,5 years and when I finally kinda finish him they go South Park banker on me "aaaand it's gone" -- great, so great.
---
Too bad the Vox Syringer doesn't work on her
---
"LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE! STOP KILLING MY CHILDREN YOU PESKY LITTLE ASSHOLES!"
---
How have shotguns been faring on the PTS? I'm PS4 so I can't test it out myself.
---
that was it
---
Nah, I think I‚Äôd rather find an alternative to our current adventure pvp screw ups rather then be told to sit in the back of the bus with the other people wanting a feature already in the game to be better then what we have now. If you like you can join one that would rather have it taken out if you don‚Äôt wish to see posts of hope like this or many others.
---
yep   they want to monitor the new event on pcs.  because its not like they have a public test server or anything
---
It explains why everyone has straight 1's for SPECIAL.
---
There‚Äôs always a danger of missing the goal. 
---
What you mean is there isn‚Äôt any danger of the reward not being gained. ;)
---
Said this months ago in video form... still true. Play FO4 and the "feel" is... well it's night and day lol.
---
"must fly, must not land"
---
I already tried that many times, spending a lot of caps without any tangible results.
---
This is all well and good but do you think newer players would even know what a main too, cash mule alt toon even means?
---
Mayne Godjirra will make a comeback from NV
---
Gattling lasers are in no way weak, and ult gat lasers are even better. I use my ut gat laser all the time and it shreads
---
I kinda tblught so, was under the impression everywhere was supposed to scale to your level. Im looking forward to having more challenging content everywhere.
---
One of the people I've started playing with is pretty new to Fallout (76 is her first FO game) and while she's almost level one hundred, there's still so much she's learning from other players and is still shocked at how nice some people are.
---
Fuck liver rocks, i'm becoming a whole rock
---
Shakes fist in discover Bog Town
---
That's the only time I ever killed someone's brahmin.
---
It was also a test to see if I could since I always joke when at my buddy's camp that I'll kill his, but I assumed the bullets would just go through. And I'd hate to shoot at his *expecting* it to go through only for it to actually die.
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
My wife actually will just go unarmed completely and punch things. Buuuuut she has my Unyielding Cavaliers BOS set on so she can get away with stunts like that
---
I am sorry to hear that, I hope you manage to get it solved though
---
yeah 4 ammo factory lags and breaks the server, sure buddy, whatever you say buddy...
---
Also remember that the explosive effect on energy weapons wasn't supposed to disappear -- but here we are :-)
---
People who think this is a good idea woefully forget that things that will go absolutely down the drain with this one will take forever to be fixed
---
"Screech and swoop, juuust screech and swoop."
---
And none of us wanted a BR mode lol.
---
I too have been down this long road to Bog Town time and time again.
---
Unless this was stealth patched in the most recent update, the endangerol gives enemies an AP buff instead of giving players an AP buff against them
---
The sonic attack can be translated into "FUCKING NORMIES GET OUT OF THE CRANBERRY BOG REEEEEEEEE"
---
You need lots of perception. Commando is better than rifleman. Tank killer and at least one concentrated fire.
---
I remember laughing when i first came across one in FO3, i still chuckle when i come across one.
---
Others have already answered your question but just to add, as far as I'm aware, An Ounce of Prevention quest that is crucial for you to start the core part of Wastelanders (i.e. dealing with the Raiders and Settlers) is currently bugged so you may have to wait for a bug fix before being able to continue.
---
They were supposed to be out with the previous update but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre getting added today in the update at 9 AM PST or noon EST
---
The endangerol gives -25% damage resistance, and the queen is well armored
---
Private worlds have been failing for container transfers lately. There have been several reports of people losing stuff when doing transfers this way recently. I believe the issue is that 1st players were getting fresh world instead of the one they just left seconds ago.
---
Do not transfer anything this way that you are not willing to lose.
---
Its the one with the blood sample and fuse in the end ? Last time i played story was at beta so i cant really recall
---
And it is possible to lose your stuff. Better to give it to a trusted buddy or use a courier.....
---
Hotfix, colossus event goes live on pc
---
i spend that money on a lamborghini instead, what you don't have one? too poor to afford it? :^)
---
Ha that's what I do too since 2 weeks. Spotify in the background was the best decision after I can sing every single in-game song now lol
---
You are going on the assumption that the devs can read?
---
I mean, you lack the initiative to come up with a discord. What makes you think you can change Bethesda's future policy?
---
Take my money!!! A Cat Milk Dish would be great, having a Cat lounging around/sitting on top of a table would definitely make my camp more lively.
---
A Doghouse would be fantastic too, a German Shepherd to roam my camp/attack enemies (Without the Dog dying) would be neat as well.
---
Not gonna lie...I would lock pick everyone of those and get me some ammo.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/72tNixuDqBoHEVDsI3Dc29/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pts-a-colossal-problem-and-meat-week-begin-soon
---
Some bug fixes among other things
---
Only read the bottom sentence since its to early for people full on complaining, so in other words you'd rather have an untested patch come out that could potentially have negative effects on other aspects of the game instead of waiting the maximum of 3 or 4 days. Wow entitled kids are out on reddit today.
---
Going to remember this Post , when it turns into the No One wasteland ....
---
Colossus and meat week.
---
I‚Äôd like the scrip pop up to not perfectly cover up the level of the next item I‚Äôm trying to scrip.
---
This is equivalent to waiting a year minus one day because you want to be on the previous calendar day.
---
\- remove leveling all together and give players actual XP they can spend on their character as they see fit. Spend XP to buy a perk card(s). Save up to buy an expensive one. Spend XP to increase your stats. Spend some nominal amount of XP to respec.
---
\- Enemies will be a range of toughness based on the type of creature they are. No more stupid level compare bullshit in the background. Zero need for One Wasteland.
---
\- Gear won't have levels. Which would be AWESOME. Balance this by making weapons weaker and then make weapon perks provide a significant boost.
---
This would be a more natural, elegant, and most importantly, FUN system.
---
Very useful thank you. Had no idea this existed lol
---
I agree with you on most of the scrap targets but I actually feel BGS would let us miss this goal.  For one this goal isn't that imperative , in comparison to others,  (however I understand this is completely subjective). If we miss this goal it works out in favor of BGS, financially,  because more people will use Atoms to level up in the Legendary Run. Finally allowing us to miss the plastic goal would lend legitimacy to the scrap goals. This is needed because the general consensus is that BGS will just move the scrap target if we are in danger of falling short. What'd ya think? Does my argument hold water?
---
I just got a build where i was 1 shotting everything and yeah... it's not Fallout lol. It's fun for about a day. I mean i'm going to chew through way more ammo but whatever. Higher EXP and actual challenge again would be great.
---
Good Points but i Linda dissagree in the Battle-Pass. Like it and If normal dailys would have stayed i would so Thema so Not more Atoms for me
---
If your a FO1st member you shouldn't have stash problems.
---
I run bloodied, and I am guilty of instakilling legendaries from time to time; but I really do try and avoid doing so. If I spot one with the green aura, I'll give it a smack with the gun butt, and wave everyone over. HOWEVER: Sometimes that green aura glitches out, and they will appear like a normal enemy....and get promptly turned into a pile of gore before I realize it has stars. And sometimes I will smite a different enemy nearby, and the AoE from my gauss shotgun will just outright kill it. It is kind of difficult to judge damage falloff and minimum safe distance from AoE, especially if the game is lagging a bit.
---
Saw someones headcanon on here once. We are the control group. We are send out in advance to help prepare the actual best and  brightest, what to expect in the wastland. Every time we die they send out another clone of us. Sometimes the cloning doesn't work to well, and people that were friends in the faults attack each other, wear silly costumes, runs towards a nuke dropping from the sky and so on. A new player exits the vault a new test subject is let loose.
---
I‚Äôm 33 year old I‚Äôm not a entitled kid so you might wanna rephrase your words bud. And yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure when it‚Äôs been delayed 3 times you would think there wouldn‚Äôt be any bugs or negative effects. I wasn‚Äôt bitching when it happened the first two times, but now yeah I‚Äôm pretty pissed. But again you wanna he keyboard gangsters think you‚Äôre the only ones allowed with an opinion and think everyone in the world that plays games is a kid. Ha
---
What you're asking for is for Bethesda to make interesting locations instead of stupid shoot 'em up dioramas. Not going to happen as Bethesda would have to give a shit.
---
I use it on my main sniper. It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse. Be aware of how much damage people are putting out. If they put out too much damage it will die too quick and people won‚Äôt get rewards. I usually wait until it‚Äôs already mutated.
---
You can get up on top of the massive NIRA radar dish north of West Tec. Senecca Rock is a fun to climb without a jetpack.
---
Then stop acting like one. Devs push back things all the time but as soon as they do due to some unforseen circumstance everyone goes around complaining. Grow up
---
What‚Äôs in update 22?
---
THIS EXPLAINS THE WEIRD POWER ARMOR LIMB BUG!
---
It‚Äôs sucks because we all hate the boxes that won‚Äôt check off even tho we‚Äôve thrown a couple hundred thousand attempts at it. Bugs like this are such a low priority that they won‚Äôt ever get fixed. Unless they go all in for one patch being a bunch of low level shit like this an old fashioned bug bash. I worked QA and those patches were always promised but never delivered because the last patch requires a hotfix!
---
&gt; I thought you got all cards by 50 normally, seems I messed up. 
---
There is lies the fault to your logic. That's not even remotely true. Most builds aren't even close to being completed by 50.
---
yes. and actually, i hear its bugged and may not be able to be completed, and you have to make sure to put them in the correct order to avoid the bug. i cant remember what it is. i THINK you put the fuse in first, then the blood sample. but i'd get another person to confirm that.
---
But when you take a gun apart, somehow you can't even manage to save a single screw ü§î
---
The challenges aren't hard. They removed nearly all the cancerous ones, probably the worst still out there is the daily level up one, but at least that gives more score. The issue is feeling like you have to play every day, but you really don't have to. You're not missing out on anything crazy after rank 4. There's also more than enough score to go around. I took over a week-long break from the season, did not participate in the double exp week at all, and have done two nuclear winter challenges since it started. I am still rank 81, ahead of the enemy spaceship right now, and will be able to skip a day or two and still make it to rank 100 without paying anything. It's anti-consumer to give so much pressure to daily playing, sure, but this isn't nearly as bad as it could be, or even as bad as how other big games do it
---
This will be my first bonus weekend and first meat week.
---
Any tips on how all this works so I'm not totally lost and in people's way?
---
How about you allow me to complain and not post shit then bud. I believe I live in a world where free speech is ok. So if I wanna complain about it for the first time since the game came out. I‚Äôm pretty sure I can, so how about you get off my dick and keep on scrolling. Ok you entitled kiddy.
---
A pet Super mutant should destroy at least half your camp each day. Smashy Smashy.
---
And did you actually test it? Because my tests last month showed that it gives THE ENEMY a buff that negates your own damage resistance when they attack you
---
Ok , completed that one üëå
---
We ArE SpEzIuL
---
Appreciate it, I just wanted to understand the need so I could avoid it as much as possible. I love my pistols. I mostly just use vats and anti armor so I should be mostly unaffected but I can see how that's bothersome
---
oh, then nevermind about the bug then lol. yeah they just need you to canonically be immune to the scorched plague
---
&amp; Ultra-light
---
Pardon my language but what in the HECK is a magic weapon!?
---
This post is fucking awesome, now I need to go Blast Metallica ... brb
---
So you highjack a thread where someone's truly excited for the game to update whenever that may be. Only to act like a little shit stain cause someone told you to stop complaining, refer to my earlier point stop acting like a damn child.
---
&gt; The DPS nerf on the PTS as it is now, is (IMO) unbearable for One Wasteland content for casuals and unoptimized players. 
---
Isn't the opposite true? They would be the least affected by the changes since they would have fewer buff multiples to stack.
---
Scorched Beans for the Queen
---
From my experience if you used one it changes the ammo type of all of them, and don‚Äôt call me Shirley
---
Make a discord for pvp when clearly stated I don‚Äôt pvp but would if it was better in game, so no need to make one. Hence why I‚Äôm here. To share an idea I heard and have productive conversations about the matter. You lack the initiative to see a better outcome. Rather then take a feature out cause you don‚Äôt like it lol that‚Äôs child thinking. Future policy? Last I checked they weren‚Äôt taking pvp out but more so trying to make it work, like I‚Äôve asked for in this post. What makes you think taking something that could be fun away from people is the answer? I mean you saw my post and must‚Äôve been so butt hurt that you had to throw in your cancel comment rather then ignore it or try and be productive and involved. I mean you‚Äôre still going and at this point and you‚Äôre not even standing ground but trying to come at me, which no lie I think is both cute and funny. I‚Äôve said bye and yet here we are. I can keep this going as long if not longer then you. Or until you try and say some shit comment you find clever or insulting and just bounce with this feeling of winning an online argument.
---
I didn't say stop progression, I said curb progression a.k.a. slowing it down.
---
We're talking about a large demographic of players not an individual.
---
It's meant to average out across the community.
---
A few people will be incredibly lucky and get the perfect rolls on a piece or two early on but the vast majority of players will have to invest time and effort to do so.
---
As far as I'm aware they haven't postponed meat week, that starts on Thursday and was always due to start then.
---
Depends on location of your camp. I‚Äôm set up next to watoga trainyard and camp alpha. My artillery reaches the BOS camp the random enemy spawn and some enemies in the trainyard. Just can‚Äôt be seen throwing the flare.
---
the handmade matte black skin is literally the purchase I most regret even more so than the annoying Fasnacht collectron
---
Then don't pvp nobody's stopping you
---
I don't see how the chance of dying will change at all.  You'll spend 5-10 more seconds per regular monster, if that.  If you weren't dying before you shouldn't be dying now.     
---
The only thing that's going to happen here is you waste more bullets.  There's nothing fun or exciting about this change.
---
Nah, stay. It's not as severe as everyone is making it out to be for ranged. You'll still have an edge over other builds. Bloodied Melee on the other hand, they'll see some changes in their numbers.
---
All of the NPCs still do that thing where we will be talking and then all of a sudden they will stop and just be staring at me and I have to wait like 10+ seconds for them to continue.  Quite annoying.
---
It's only Colossus
---
Would be cool. I remember when there was 3 deathclaw on that island.
---
Why is there a  CAMP party? What are they changing now?
---
same
---
Definitely. Just get on the drums, go into photo mode, and rubber bands the controller.
---
Not home right now. When are they bringing servers down?
---
There are no enemies at the cook out. So yes you can AFK.
---
You can afk by doing drums or turning the cooking spits.  Unlike Fasnacht it actually contributes to the event slightly.  Not a whole lot but definitely slightly.
---
I believe most of the nuclear winter power armor paints are available for different Power Armor types.
---
I don't NW so I am not sure on all, but I believe at least Donut Sprinkles paint, Blue Camo paint, and Donut paint work on several types including Ultracite. I know I used Blue Camo to hide my strangler heart power armor (uses same skins as ultracite) to hide it back when it was still crashing queens. Lol.
---
Its not the weapon, its the build.
---
Bloodied/unyielding low-life builds are currently the strongest in the game by a significant margin. Any weapons type can be bloodied, but stealth commando/heavy miniguns are the cream of the crop.
---
Junkies builds are the next most powerful. They can be optimally played using the unyielding low-life style. But are still strong as full life builds.
---
Nothing else compares really, unless youre using a magic shotgun, in which case your build is irrelevant so long as you stack the shottie perks.
---
Gotcha. Cheers for the response. I really didn't want to have re roll my SS armor for bolestering/vanguard.
---
When I was about level 50 a level 300 dropped a quad ammo explosive shotgun for me. Up to that point, I didn't have a specific build so built one around it and can now 1 shot most enemies (Had to spec as Vats shotgunner as the rubber banding issue without Vats is crazy).
---
Definately getting the right build and matching a weapon to the build.
---
I have music playing a lot of the time (gaming or not) so I am able to add to stuff to playlists frequently.
---
Oh no! Not the Sun Kissed! You legit made me scared firing bullets.
---
Seriously though, I don't care about legendaries so much, so I expect others to do the same. Sometimes I nuke (mostly out of fear somebody else might oneshot it), sometimes I tag and emote, sometimes I don't even bother tagging. Events are plenty, legendaries become a side thing later on. 
---
Select few will know it's all about Nuka Cola Quantum.
---
Amen brother.üëçüëçüëç
---
Maybe I'll do that when needed. Drop off a bunch of Chally Feed in a Loot Bag and and AFK on the Drums
---
I'm down. L337, Heavy, Commando, Shotgun, Master Crafter, PA Smith. ;) GT JaggersLips13.
---
I don't understand how single shot weapons were hit harder. Wasn't everything hit with the same nerf percentage wise?
---
FASNACHT MUSEUM! but only do it if you have all the masks.
---
Agreed. Unpopular opinion right now but I‚Äôm just glad they‚Äôre addressing magic damage and rubber banding.

---
If you are doing PTS, provide feedback on it.
---
If you are not doing PTS, wait till it drops, then decide.
---
They need to consider this for the upcoming console generation change.  Some people might want to switch to PC.
---
Nobody is making me not pvp...?  Well BGS is with how the handled it in adventure, and other for being given to go ahead to abuse the systems. Hence my post and the idea of public team pvp with better systems. I‚Äôve said before, even being able to do NW from adventure would be better then what we have now. Could even public pvp team and only fight in that arena in Watogo. Get teleported in there when you start the team. Something that doesn‚Äôt require 5 load screen and no time in game.
---
Me too man. I love building and hate having the little budget that we do get taken away. Having OCD doesn't things easier...üò≠
---
***facepalm***
---
You tried to lure deer with meat. Just think about that a second.
---
If you plan on AFking, please do everyone a favor and use the drums to contribute. Thank you
---
At launch the m79 was technically a shotgun so you could stack shotgun perks and explosive perks, it was amazing. Sometime I wish we could have some of the fun bugs like that one back
---
And a stupidly easy to do exploit. Don't quite get how this one hasn't been fixed yet.
---
That's 11 yards in Freedom Units.
---
Ashes to ashes nuts to butts
---
Scorchbeast queen be giving us guff.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Throughout history the only way the exploiters of ordinary hard working people listen to us is if we actually do shit about it.
---
I just logged in right now to test it. The endangerol syringe does not change the damage you deal to an enemy. But it makes that enemy deal more damage to you. So nothing was fixed. Sorry, all you're doing is getting people at the event killed faster
---
Well make a discord and have 8 people meet up at Watoga
---
&gt;checkmate 
---
Yup you got me.
---
I've got a Bloodied Sniper and Bloodied Melee and have zero plans to change either. My thoughts are: My Sniper has a secondary weapon for closer-range, so I'll still down everything but the Bigguns (SB, SBQ, Mirelurk Queens, Squatch) before they even get to me; and my Melee has Martial Artist and Faster Swing Speed weapons, so swinging a couple more times shouldn't be a big deal.
---
21 seems to be the cap for what I've seen.
---
I can already see the leeches rubbing their hands together in expectation.
---
This event would give you Deathclaw lure grenades. Lure a DC to attack the targets it coats with the explosion.
---
Its ridiculous me and my wife are new players only level 31 n 27. Uranium fever ran back to back last night and we didn't get a single legendary. Barely was able to kill an mole miners cuz of a guy with a explosive plasma gun and a guy with deathclaw gauntlet. Its ridiculous we have a hard enough time getting legendarys as is.
---
Tenderizer plan, a new brahmin grill and a beer stein. Not sure if there's anything else.
---
I saws the ammo thing on an xbox console server and was like when did this start?
---
Ah yes if I only I was rich lmao. But even then they‚Äôd alienate me and think I was weird af
---
why bro... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Oh I always would in someway. For Fasnacht I'd stock up on Intestines, Steins, Wood, Beeswax, and Eggs and leave care packages on the bridge by the MC before hiding for 1 or 2 events. I used to play an Instrument but someone would Nuke Mine me - once about 5 minutes after dropping off the care package - or lure in nearby Scorched. So I started Churching it.
---
This. I got confused when a guy on here mentioned that you can't do stealth damage when an enemy is agroing something else, I thought he meant that the game won't add the stealth multiplier, but it is actually a bug, you will see big numbers in VATS, but you will not actually be doing that damage. Free aim still seems to work fine, from what little testing I've done, but its extremely hard to tell. Thats definitely the reason though.
---
&gt; Kill X number of critter and they all take at least 4 shots to kill. Everything will be a bullet sponges. 
---
So 4 bullets to take down an enemy is considered a bullet sponge? Really?
---
I'm all for science and the effort you put into this post. Kudos for that. However, taking your protectron example with the gauss rifle, while there's a decent different between the two damage numbers, you're still one-shotting them, aren't you? 
---
So numbers different but actual outcome is identical?
---
I get that this won't apply to all creatures but the sense I got from seeing the PTS in action, it's a marginal change as Angry Turtle illustrated in his video on the topic. It clearly was taking more bullets to take down the super mutants he was taking out but not that significantly hard or more time consuming that it took any extra effort with his sweep.
---
Eh to much outside the game work for things that the game already brings. I have to go outside the game to even want to maybe pvp sometimes? When there could be systems in place to fix and improve this? Doesn‚Äôt that make my time more shit? I mean you want it gone for your shitty time and yet I need to deal with it to make your play ‚Äúbetter‚Äù? Nahhhh
---
It was hilarious how many people had a nappy rash if you would afk at Fasnacht. I had people glitching thru walls trying to kill me, beating me, it was hilarious ... I mean there were tons of people at each parade, so it wasn't like it was a problem but It was still funny to come back and see someone beating up on me, I died a few times because of low health but it wasn't due to enemies I don't think, funny none the less that people took it upon themselves to serve justice.
---
Damage system is getting revamped. No more ridiculously high multiplicative bonuses, everything is a flat increase now. This decreases the gap between bloodied and normal builds
---
Always run with my weight reduction perks for ammo and heavies. I use four different ammo type heavies so weight was always an issue.
---
Tbh i dont mind people exploiting on the condition it doesnt affect others! Yeah it is overpowered but if no one exploited it wouldnt get patched! 
---
I admit i have exploited but i never go to the extent this guy goes ü§£
---
Then they need to push the pts to fucking consoles.
---
Which magic effects did you try specifically because they didn't work for me, and everyone else was reporting the same. So you seem to be the only one saying they're still working.
---
Completely agree. This game is an afterthought and all the real talent is on Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls. Marvel Avenger's will be my new grind game come September 1st.
---
Yea and sometimes people are brilliant at one thing and complete idiots at everything else.
---
There are plenty of doctors, scientists, etc like that.
---
Yes, also this ^. Changes aren't finalized yet.
---
Sounds like 2020.
---
Where do you get the dark matter pa skin?
---
The top of The Top of the World is pretty cool, you can actually get into an unloaded version of the mezzanine level and it is complete bare. From the top you get some pretty awesome views too. I don't think it was too hard to get to the top, but I don't really remember, it was a while ago when I last did it.
---
I can't play with mic or in Partys or even music 'loud' because of my family. But that's it. Always new music.
---
Nah coz everyone can blag it saying they thought they were allowed to blueprint it lol that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do
---
You can pretty much make a throw away character that takes up full camp budget for this. Basically afk on him when you are busy and make tons of ammo to sell.
---
That way if you glitch you camp you can just delete the character after the fact and make a new one.
---
So go do it, put in the effort and do some math breakdowns. Compare shot for shot new damage output with all the different legendary effects and compare the numbers and put in your suggestion for how to rebalance. 
---
Instead of worrying about what others aren't doing, if it's something that you want done - get it done... And welcome to how 90% of us modders got into it.
---
Tsk ... just put it in a stew already
---
What ammo exploit? Have a link?
---
Gob? Is that you?
---
best and brightest being the best and brightest... slave candidates. think about it.
---
* overseer is more or less brainwashed into thinking vault-tec = life
---
* we are taught that vault-tec is our future
---
* we are only taught the basics of survival but unleashed into a harsh unknown world with only alittle crafting supplies, 5 cans of water, 5 stim packs, a radaway and rad-x also the magnum opus = camp device
---
* we clearly show an a good deal of crafting knowledge since as soon as we leave the vault we can make pipe weapons and combat knives as well as learn plans from just a quick glance at them
---
* our vault trophy cases are full of pointless little achievements to bolster and reinforce our competitive nature
---
* and the best of all, we are taught vault-tec = best thing about humanity yet we dont get taught anything about HOW to save humanity or helping the remnants of the military
---
the overseers main plan that vault-tec assigned her was securing the nukes.
---
we weren't intended to restore OUR world we were to restore and hand it over to vault-tec, jokes on them it seems vault-tec died with the nukes
---
I'm proposing though that they shouldn't have even announced FO76 until closer to a release date. Similar to FO4, in this alternate timeline it wouldn't be announced until about 6 months prior to it shipping.
---
IMHO if you are posting in reddit about PTS you are not casual. Fix your build.
---
explain
---
For commando, id recommend looking into a max level quad pipe gun with any decent secondary/tertiary stats you can find. If your build is halfway decent you should be able to put down any mob in a single half second burst even without any fancy bloodied or junkies mods. And a quad pipe gun with the best armor piercing mag will have a 48 round capacity.
---
I have a very nice bloodied handmade on my commando that i almost never end up using because my quad pipe does the vast majority of the heavy lifting for day to day play. And .38 is cheaper and easier to keep in stock than 556.
---
After seeing the photo, I only have one question: "Why?"
---
We won't know until Bethesda actually doesn't anything about it. 
---
I wouldn't do it because getting your account potentially banned or even temporarily suspended isn't worth the little extra ammo you get out of using it.
---
to be fair, the public test servers are a smaller playerbase. they're probably making super-sure that servers can handle it since it's likely that many will be launching nukes to do the event.
---
Oh boy what if we find out they didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôve been orchestrating everything the whole time
---
Also you might just play this game as there goes so much times to gather ammo ;D  
---
Everything is grind in this game still, even now this player has some ammo to spare.
---
Ford, we want a temp bridge so the mobs can cross.
---
Agreed, really enjoyed Far Harbour and Nuka World. Was really surprised they didn't release more DLC and I remember a lot of people expected they would. Especially given that the game had so much good DLC bait like the Memory Den, the Yangtze and the close proximity of New York or the Capital Wasteland.
---
A "canner" machine that crafts nonperishable foods with a cooked item + steel/aluminum + salt
---
Shut up and take my Atoms.
---
I hope so
---
We already got NW for that if you don't want outside the game work
---
Considering they haven't been shy to ban people for exploits before I wouldn't risk it.
---
Might as well be since pvp is completely dead now
---
Some kind of half beast, half scorchqueen?
---
You will still be in no danger after the updates, you will just see max level monsters, which will be no threat to a developed player, and you will only see them in areas that allow for it.  Really think there will be any difference in danger between a level 68 super mutant and a level 100 one?  Is there any difference between a level 10 and a level 68?  Just hps?    
---
What you will see is more time and bullets wasted, and a lot of people probably just moving on to another game, because there are no real pros for most players, and some savage cons to others.
---
Yeah I think the popularity of the coop Skyrim mod and the upcoming Fallout 4 coop mod show how much the fans would love that idea. The idea of exploring a fully realised Bethesda world with a small group of friends (kind of like the experience you get in Divinity Original Sin) would be amazing.
---
**Beans**
---
The problem is the ttk for nearly every normal enemy in the wasteland for most high level players is **zero**.
---
Once you get sufficiently good gear and perks you simply delete enemies and they become nothing more than a loot bag and some xp.
---
That makes enemies quite unformidable.
---
Nothing really poses a threat, so the whole combat formula side of the game is effectively neutered.
---
Having things take a few hits more will mean in outnumbered situations you might start to feel pressure if you can‚Äôt fend things off fast enough, maybe forcing you to change your tactics as well.
---
This would make going into a death claw lair or a blood eagle camp a bit more of an ordeal than simply going in and vats 1 shotting everything in sight
---
I would totally be ok with tougher enemies so long as they reward more XP than they do currently such that you are roughly earning the same XP per hour as before just by using more bullets and by killing less enemies.
---
12 pm eastern time.
---
Yes for new Mission but the Raider don't search the war with the settler
---
Have you played the godzilla mod for fallout 4? Built defenses and prepare for battle. It was crazy!
---
Nuclear winter is boring af.
---
There are better battle royale games.
---
There wasnt a better mmo pvp than 76 tho.
---
You get a giant wendigo and now you want a giant Deathclaw. What's next? A giant Radroach
---
They should have taken the time changing FO4's code to make FO76 an online game into just making a coop. Yes it would have had backlash if it released as a buggy mess but when has that stopped Bethesda? In the words of Todd Howard it's not how it releases it's how it ends up.
---
From what I gather, some players rely on or use food buffs to strengthen their build. E.g. Glowing steaks give (iirc) a 30% melee damage bonus, so this would be useful to a melee build that utilises food. 
---
I use food perks such as butchers bounty and good with salt to get the most out of my squirrel stew and sb broiled brains. I always have brahmin and radstag meat on hand to haul more stuff around with me when needed too.
---
I know most vault dwellers put a lot of time into their builds, this is why I have a weapon for every creature on the map, but realistically I would never bring a pistol or one/two handed melee to fight the SBQ or Encryptid.  I like watching the YouTube f/o76 videos for their builds and weapon tests but some of the blame for the nerf should go on them when they kill the end game creatures in 22 seconds.
---
Last I checked I 'only' had ~64k 5.56 on me - I might need to stock up again.
---
Lucky Hole it is!
---
Yes, but the main factor is rate of fire.  In the live game, with a bloody, junkie or instigating sniper rifle backed by damage perks, you can shoot regular enemies in the head, kill them and cut through a crowd methodically.  In the PTS, you can sometimes kill with one headshot, but similarly to how bloody was hit the hardest, high single shot damage was similarly reduced by a larger amount, because the multiplicative effects compounded into high damage numbers.
---
The sniper rifle, which relies on high damage to kill an enemy with a headshot, can no longer do that reliably.  Versus large enemies like scorchbeasts and deathclaws, or an endgame boss, it is too slow to be effective at all.
---
Bethesda 101 if no ones complaining break it
---
That island would be too small if the mother had to be there
---
We have that, workshop pvp, and adventure pvp. Out of those adventure sounds the most fun, so with that in mind I offer an idea for said mode. I‚Äôve stated the issues with NW before and even gave a small idea to fix that. With the spirit of the whole 76 community in mind I offered an idea shared to me. You no like you no need to play or come at people wanting to see a fix that makes them and others happy.
---
I am so thankful when that happens with my character so from those of us that have been saved. Thank you.
---
Yeah I saw it at a camp yesterday. Dude had like 6 of them an I‚Äôm trying to understand how he‚Äôs pumping bullets out of the earth.
---
Yes , it‚Äôs an exploit. That ban wave is gonna be glorious too , watching reddit explode into 800 posts about how unfair it is they punished people for cheating is gonna be hilarious
---
I did make a post yesterday.  It was buried on page two an hour or so later.
---
I think that the weak bow might have been a reaction to the number of stealth archers in ES games.
---
Give info
---
I had some total prat shooting at me cos I was wandering around with a DCG at Uranium Fever yesterday. Giving me thumbs down etc. I run around dealing with the regulars and switch to a rifle to tag the Legendaries. He was convinced I was one-shotting the Legendaries though. Still, he did waste about 1000 .45 on shooting me, which was fun
---
It is all over the place you take the Ammo Factory Workshop then bluebrint the Machine.
---
Then you can place it down at your camp or other workshop via the bluprint.
---
I would not do it though.
---
Aaah ok that's what I was worried about. Makes sense tho. I have to spend some points now lol
---
Yeah that's the worst kind of development.  When you make something so imbalanced it completely warps game play so that it defines the experience... then leave it for over a year... THEN decide to massively change it once it's become a core part of game play for MASSIVE number of people.    
---
I've seen it before, and it's pretty inexcusable.
---
Handmade imo, The MG42 is the most beastly ammo hog in the game.
---
Meat week was supposed to start patch Tuesday. They delayed it from Tuesday to Thursday to give people time to deal with a collasal problem, now they've postponed the start of the event for 3+ days for consoles so my logic says that includes meat week.
---
Tank killer is a perk card right?
---
They don't need to fix it,  they just nerfed damage.. problem solved...
---
Deathclaws in the whole game are weak. I remember New Vegas it's Quarry and you didn't wanna go there. Same for 3 but 4 and 76 have weaker variants
---
Huh! Maybe they bugged it out at some point? I‚Äôm going off what it was when it first came out
---
I think a slight nerf was fine, but yes, a buff for everything else at the same time would have been a MUCH better way to go than just wreck everything people rely on.
---
No, Dandwich de Queso con Barbacoa, SQB
---
every hour, on the hour, it's this fucking thread again.
---
I realised I was doing the same loops every day, got max caps, camp hopped, while looking for events all the time. So I took a break. Came back every time they gave us new content. Then I came back just before wastlanders, got a new character to level 50 for wastlanders. Played both the raiders and settlers quest, was great. And fell into a loop again. So I took a break. Came back for legendary run realised I'm not a fan of the loops.
---
Weapons with certain legendary prefixes that have over 200 fire rate. That number breaks the prefix and makes the weapon cause far more damage than it should be doing. Pretty much melts the queen.
---
Bethesda. Net still says today. They will probably rake the servers off line in a hour.
---
Ward actually got worse. Every single time I go there he keeps pulling the 1000 mile stare and it makes me want to nuke the damn place. Or shoot him. Or both.
---
That is some funny ish right there!!!
---
 I get to shoot the super mutant 10 times instead of 2.  It's a whole new experience!
---
They patched it :-/ they patched it literally a few days before I was going to be able to buy Stranglerheart! But I‚Äôve still got my regular Ultracite set, probably for the rest of time :)
---
Someone wrote 12 et but deleted the comment
---
Are they really banning for that?
---
That‚Äôs like owning a restaurant, knowing that Coca Cola is popular, so you sell knockoff Kooky Kola to spite your customers.  Why would they intentionally make it bad?
---
If the would only care.
---
I did some brief testing yesterday on this. At low health, with a crafted level 50 sniper rifle‚Äî.308, no legendary‚Äîand no rifleman perks I did the following: 
---
1 headshot killed level 50 Super Mutant
---
1-2 headshots killed level 75 Super Mutant depending on Adrenaline/VATS crit
---
1-3 headshots killed level 100 Super Mutant, again depending on Adrenaline/VATS crit 
---
With the appropriate damage perks and a legendary weapon, you should kill all of these in one shot.
---
only if you unlocked them.  You have to unlock them first before you can choose them.
---
That‚Äôs ass
---
Bat
---
I do!
---
Obviously you don't care too much about happiness of PC players. I might agree with you if I was a console player since I seriously considered switching over to console to avoid hacks and cheats. Whatever you are suggesting only works if you are a console player
---
Hopefully today
---
Try to use unarmed in a power armor üòÇ diffrent weapon diffrent build...
---
PC is getting colossal problem today so it's a full outage, not the usual weekly rolling restarts.
---
Yes it's a nerf, they aren't re-balancing anything, it's just a damage reduction.  Balance would be raising up some things and lowering others to create more... balance.  Not what's happening.
---
Magic is causing that damage that fast, not duping.  I do Events all day and it's not that common. Do I see it, yes, but not that often.
---
And 1K rounds in my VE minigun is maybe 10k worth of damage total against the SBQ if all rounds crit.
---
What weapon do you use
---
At least they continue. Ward literally freezes and I have to back out of the conversation and restart it. Same when I return to cash in my reward. If it weren't for stockpiling T notes I'd not bother with that idiot at all.
---
This kind of thing makes me long for the days when dumb robots were the only quest givers.
---
Allow me to explain.   Blue printing the ammo factory, placing at workshops and farming butt ton of ammo.  This glitch uses CAMP budget, and they cannot be moved or removed after placing.   Work shops is a way around as it counts towards the work shops budget and not your personal player CAMP.
---
The vault with the raiders? Which location is that? And what level are the enemies there for you?
---
Take the workshop and get to work destroying it
---
The Roboticist Possum challenge is also bugged I believe.
---
&gt;Ungrateful.
---
You can‚Äôt be serious.
---
My dude I'm level 440.full 3star Unyielding ss set. There is no gun I can trade for because I have every gun I want. It's getting fucking boring being a bloodied build that can one shot everything. I'm hoping this update will allow me to try different builds find new guns, see what works.
---
No you dont you just hit l3 on ps4 and select a perk to unlock. I dont understand how you have 1000 hrs and didnt know that...
---
an oldie but goodie lol
---
It's a nerf when it means some builds will become literally unplayable, not a re-balance. It needs to be tweaked so that the playing field is fair but doesn't mean some builds get left behind/pushed out entirely. So many builds are lost in the conversation about whether or not bloodied or junkie's will still be the meta or not.
---
On here or Bethesda forums, because on here I see a few dismissive comments about junkies builds but the last post is about adding a weapon or two months ago. 
---
So maybe you deleted it when it didn't get the reaction you wanted, so I'll help explain what gets traction. 
---
Actual math and hard numbers, a direct comparison between like items and situations from PTS vs live and an objective unbiased assessment. 
---
Lots of random bullshit or trying to just say it's bad without showing why, just expect to be ignored or downvoted.
---
It's the level 100 legendary run season 1 skin, it's a black captain cosmos skin
---
That'll show um.
---
This game is the biggest disappointment anymore.....
---
I mean, that‚Äôs cool and all, but that doesn‚Äôt change your situation. Maybe today‚Äôs patch will fix it, but maybe not until patch 22...
---
And what happens if in the middle of that legendary perk grind they change the meta and you now need those perk cards you scrapped or to move points around again?
---
"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."

Hmmmmmmm
---
As I said, how they feel about nukes is very spelled out:
---
 **Elizabeth Taggerdy**: One of the squires on patrol found a nuclear silo. Still functional.  
---
**Roger Maxson**: What? Even you, Lizzy? Are you out of your god-damned mind? Look around. Look at everything. The death, the destruction, the End of the World. That came from the nukes.  
---
**Elizabeth Taggerdy**: But if we don't deal with the Bravos once and for all, they could kill everyone. All life on this continent. That's what Takano said, right?  
---
**Roger Maxson**: There will always be a reason to use a weapon. Always. But nukes? Never again. I'd mothball the whole technology if I could. Am I clear?  
---
**Elizabeth Taggerdy**: Yes, Elder. 
---
On the other hand, they seem to have no issues whatsoever with using advanced technology like power armor, laser weapons, plasma weapons, giant robots, etc. for destructive purposes.
---
And of course, who says they want to use the weather control device as a weapon?  Maybe they have a notion about using it to reduce rad storms, provide additional rainfall to dry locations, warmer winters, milder summers, that sort of thing?  Which sounds nice if you actually believe a complex system like the weather can be controlled without it backfiring spectacularly...
---
And if Paladin Rahmani and Elder Maxim are having a disagreement of some sort as the encrypted messages imply, she might be thinking of pointing it out west and doing something...regrettable.
---
I am pretty sure that was unintentional - kinda like the Gatling gun firing faster with martial artist equipped :P
---
Some of the old bugs really were glorious.
---
I have 1 for personal use only cause I can never find anyone selling shotgun shells for 1 cap, why should I get banned for that
---
Im sure that since the game launched a failure that Zenimax is trying out different forms of monitization to see what they can get away with. They want this so that starfield and ES6 can make them money constantly down the line. (I guess the days of making a good game and it selling for years, like the witcher 3, are over.)
---
Nope... people keep saying this.. but I have proved to people before witch screenshots... The only ones that show in that list that you get to pick from are ones previously found.  People kept telling me to use a certain card... I would go to the list, take a screenshot of the card not being there... So you can say what ya want... but I've proven this so many times. It's not worth me arguing about.
---
They need their A team working on 76 but they don't wanna do that so here we go lol
---
There is a Ripper static spawn on a small table near the warehouse weapon workbench in Abandoned Bog Town.
---
They are absolute garbage unfortunately. My 15 str heavy gunner PA char tried using one and it was ticking for 3 dmg, two or three times per second. A molerat was laughing at me. The characters non-legendary heated shiskebab would melee for 150+ a swing every second and a half or so.
---
&gt; Unlike Fasnacht it actually contributes to the event slightly. 
---
The Fasnacht band disagrees.
---
It just seems like the game is boring, and you should play something else.  I don't see why this would change anything for you.  Everything is getting nerfed.
---
I play on public teams a few times each day now and yesterday was my first experience with the whole team members leaving and then being absolute dicks destroying my CAMP.  I remember way back in early 2019 dealing with griefers before the devs made it impossible to damage a CAMP unless in PVP.  I guess not bad for me, only two real griefer experiences since BETA.
---
Bloodied explosive handmade.
---
On console it‚Äôs literally a single button press.  Can‚Äôt be any harder on PC.
---
On the PTS forums.  I tried to be eloquent, polite and carefully explain the problems I was seeing, but I‚Äôll definitely try again.  I‚Äôll grab a short bit of video so the devs can see for themselves.
---
It is different but to write it off completely is closed minded and short sighted. If I don‚Äôt care about PC player then the same can be said for you not caring about the ones wanting to better the game they play.
---
Bloodied for life, b******
---
What damage reduction is also consider a re-balance
---
I wont even play violent night anymore cuz i help get to the end and never get to tag the windego.
---
I wish they copied or used ARK's exact same building system, it has been the most versatile one I have seen
---
Have a downvote, nerd.
---
Video is good, track your numbers and show hard numbers is even better.
---
Not bad just not nearly as good.  The meme for ES is that players start thinking they are going to focus on one handed, magic or sword and board but always end up stealth archers.  I think they were attempting to avoid that.
---
I too would be interested if anyone has the loot table.
---
Then don't be surprised if someone do not agree with you
---
This is not a problem with bloody assemblies, but with cheaters and exploiters.
---
You can but iirc,you need to turn in some prime cut meat to receive the best rewards.and obviosly complete the event at best.
---
Nothing wrong with that, Fallout 4 is a great game.
---
PS4.
---
Nice gun I have 1 that's primed and I do t 1st shot stuff with that I think it is more for the stuff like shotguns and sniper rifles that have a natural high 1 shot damage anyway
---
It a damage reduction rebalance. What you talking about is weapon rebalance which will probably come later on. You can‚Äôt do both at the same time or rebalance weapon before reworking the dmg formula keep that in mind
---
Also looking forward to TES6!
---
All the damage nerf does is close the gap between low damage builds and the highest damage ones. It shouldn't change the meta all that much in terms of which builds are better for damage output.
---
Because you are breaking terms of service
---
I‚Äôll drop my nuke wherever I want , it‚Äôs my nuke.
---
Who's crying? Are you even able to read lol
---
Holy shit
---
I‚Äôm not was just hoping for a real back and forth and not an insult trade. Was trying to learn and understand from others and see if there was a way to turn this around. Didn‚Äôt get that from you but still enjoyed our conversation.
---
Nope, not the only one unfortunately. The collect magazines one is bugged as well. The ones for Guns and bullets and also about the holotape games are bugged for me.
---
Most often, it happens to me when I return to Adventure mode from NW
---
I know right? I have a nocturnal swing speed sledgehammer and it‚Äôs as good as Junkies at night.
---
And then all the bans will be revoked, again, because player numbers and profit matters more to Bethesda than rules. 
---
Have you learned *nothing* so far?
---
AWWW YISSS. PC MASTER RACE IN THE HOu....
---
\*Bethesda Intensifies\*
---
Shit, were just here as mine sweepers to find all the game breaking bugs before the console launch arent we?
---
They can't. Not only doesn't Sony let you constantly push new builds, it would add to development time having to collate the data
---
10? No. 73 if they all land in her face as a sneak attack, which is still less than one clip. 2 clips is the more usual count though and I average around 300, but that's after waiting for everyone else at the event to put enough rounds in her to cause regeneration while I shoot at the things she spawns in with a bloodied fixer.
---
Cool! :D
---
In the one of the Holo tapes the  Overseer talks about how people got married and had children in the Vault.  Maybe you are just one of those children, a throw back spawn that wasn't as gifted as your parents.  It has been 25 years after all.  
---
Or maybe your are that 45+ something survivor that grew soft and dull having everything provided to you by Mr. Handy's  and Vend -O- Matic machines.  Watching John Wayne Movies in your room all day.  
---
Interesting if you ponder it, but you didn't get your first official introduction to the C.A.M.P. Device till you were leaving the Vault.  And the Overseer seems to try to provide training on the fly in her Holo tapes as you go.  What were we doing all that time underground?
---
there delaying colosal problem for consols but it will go live for pc today
---
Byeeeeeee
---
If you get a Chinese stealth suit and collect some ore you are doing more than your fair share. I do it everytime I see it and have only completed it once with all the scavengers still alive. 
---
I really want the rad barrel plans.
---
You've got an excellent point. It's a very fine line to continue to create new material without falling into that power creep cycle along the way. 
---
They've got a long way to go but if they start to go down the ESO route with how they expand the game they have near limitless potential with expanding the map into the next "zone". I love the fallout world and really hope they can keep it going.
---
I agree with you though, I suspect this game is now mostly just making a quick buck while testing out ideas for other games or the next fallout.
---
I can understand why you'd feel that way. The writing in Fallout games has been going downhill with each installment and there's no denying that 76 is by far the weakest. I just can't help but get super into the lore we've been given with Appalachia.
---
HOW that's a good thing if i take +0.326 Milisseconds to kill a level 100 Super Mutant !!! #I'MLEAVING !
---
Overall it isn't worth doing, in my opinion.  I complete the event doing the bare minimum and I have completed it by filling the ore 100 percent with all setters still alive. The rewards were the exact same every single time.
---
Most likely it just happened that somebody brought out a bugged weapon around the time you were able to hit it
---
My man!
---
So Were all the dupers and they didn't get banned and that was a lot worse, bloodied fixers and handmade's and Christmas presents flying around like they were Halloween candy, it's not like I have a whole ton of them going like I've seen alot of people do
---
Not to mention it permanently messes up your camp budget.
---
How can you possibly have enough power for that lol ?
---
not realy a point the plastic has most likly been finished yesterday
---
Casual means different things to different people, but generally it's probably well accepted to mean someone who doesn't min max to great lengths, but the thing is Bloodied isn't a min maxing thing.  It's just really THE build.  I don't see why causal players wouldn't use what is quite obviously the best supported and most effective build.  Simply having a bloodied weapon, and the the handful of low life perks doesn't mean you aren't a casual player.
---
Fair enough
---
Surprised you didn't get down voted lmao
---
Gramophone please.

I wish I knew what people meant by this. I have never had to go gather ammo, in fact I have to constantly try to waste it.  I have a bunch of .45, I use all that up, then I find out I have over 100 fusion cores on me so I have to use up all that. Suddenly a bunch of plasma cores too, time to use that. Oh look, I have a stockpile of .45 again. Not to mention the endless 5.56 from that being the only thing I craft. The only ammo I ever really run out of is .308, but I have my ammo machine making that and generally save it for SBQ fights
---
Does that even count as a build? That's always been shit.
---
Could be random encounters killing it.  Mine get's killed all the time, but it's raiders or moth cultist, mole rats....etc.  Not other players.
---
The build is still good, although it's rather more affected by the changes than the auto-rifle builds. The damage nerf - if it goes life the way it is currently in the PTS, which is by no means a given - means that one shot kills are no longer a matter of course, at least not from torso shots. So either be prepared to use more than one shot even on some of the tougher trash mobs, or be more careful about aiming for the weak spots (e.g. the head on humanoids) if you aren't doing so already.
---
If you're using an instigating rifle or something weaker, upgrade to a bloodied rifle so the second shot doesn't hit like a wet noodle. If you use VATS, use Concentrated Fire for head shots. If you aren't using Tank Killer, consider switching it in. Your raw damage probably isn't high enough anymore to ignore the mob's DR, and armor reduction still works multiplicatively.
---
That‚Äôs what I did at last meat week. Turn in prime cuts then drum away.
---
Then explain how I selected light footed yesterday without having it unlocked. Or for that matter how would you really even set up a build with it always being random. You are genuinely wrong or have a defective game
---
Yeah but what your saying is they should have released a buggy mess fo4 dlc so we dont get a buggy mess FO76, same problems would have happened, except people would then say "fix you damn dlc before you release a new game ffs"
---
False. I have a brand new computer, ssd, 2070 super card, the works and patch 21 tanked my performance. Stuttering, load lag, DCs, etc.
---
I don't know why they haven't reworked the taming system like this yet. The whole system as it stands is super clunky and not very player-friendly. Most newer players don't even know the taming function is there at all. 
---
I just want a pet Deathclaw that can't be killed by stubbing her toe on the ground texture.
---
Yeah, I know it takes more than that. Just being sarcatic and stuff.
---
Really? the videos I watched claimed that it still worked on heavies and shotguns, sure it doesn't work as fast because of the lower overall dps but it still works!
---
You ever been in a party or group chat with 8 or more people? It's a fucking nightmare.
---
Deer are carnivorous so it should have worked.
---
https://youtu.be/2q91dUtDYkU
---
https://youtu.be/sQOQdBLHrLk
---
Yeah I am somewhat hopeful they will fix it but I need to see them actually do so before I am motivated to play again, and I think there should still be some actually multiplicative effects, like vintage nuka shine and stealth hits as well as vats crits and their perks but those are all things that can be done differently as well
---
To everyone who commented the quest thing about retrieve your loot thank you, because I wouldnt have found it other wise. I was about to comment I'm having the same problem but that worked
---
I dont' know man. All I know is my experience. There are still a couple cards I can't select.
---
I'm lvl 160 and I feel like it's a morning chore now to hop on and get my jobs done then I change to a different game
---
Really? PTS must have boosted them, my lv 200 character even in private worlds only seem to spawn lv 15 deathclaw on that island!
---
Even my automatic bloodied handmade was doing absolutely no noticeable damage in a colossal problem. I wasn't expecting to take it out myself but that damage bar didn't move AT ALL while I was shooting even in stealth w a lot of critical hits. When everyone left but me and my friend it was just sad. I was expecting a decent gun like that to do SOMETHING. It was a rough moment for me not gonna lie. Running away from a deathclaw because I couldn't one shot it felt good though and like something that should have always been that way.
---
What *is* that resource collector? It looks like the ammo machine from the ammo factory workshop. I've never seen that available anywhere else in the game. The ammo machine you buy at Crater with gold bullion doesn't look like that. So what is it?
---
People are tired of finding twenty of those machines in every server while the asshat that owns the camp is screaming ‚Äú it has nothing to do with server stability ‚Äú
---
Meanwhile watoga isn‚Äôt on the map and loading screens take 37 minutes ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Except logical sense has nothing to do with Beth's development cycle
---
This would also add HUGE amounts of server load. The camps already struggle rendering as it stands right now. I'd rather them put that server load to good use by expanding stash size or reworking the ammunition machine
---
When you do a damage decrease across all weapons... how is that balancing anything?  It's just making things take longer.
---
Well thats not the point ... and alot of ppl love  power armor im not but ik some...

"I must apologize for the 76ers, they are idiots. We have purposefully trained them wrong, as a joke."
---
What the hell are those?
---
It's bad because the more multipliers you have the more affected you are.
---
If you have a weak build with a couple multipliers its like going from (made up numbers to illustrate the point) 3√ó3√ó3=27 to 3+3+3=9
---
A build with a bunch of multipliers goes from 3x3x3x3x3=244 to 3+3+3+3+3=15.
---
So while the build with more multipliers is still strongest, the difference is minimal
---
Power armor is only good for heavy gun builds, unarmed mods for power armor arms is just a waste of scrap!
---
Ignorance does not grant innocence.  You still get speeding tickets even if you didn‚Äôt see a sign that said the speed limit went down.
---
Yes. You‚Äôre using an exploit.
---
I have been trying to do this for weeks now. It worked this morning! Inknow they were doing the hotfix today, so it seems to have fixed it!
---
Its like a Protest against the ammo factory glitch
---
Just because other people didn‚Äôt get punished (for whatever reason) means you are exempt from being punished when you do something wrong.  
---
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.
---
How are you selecting them? Because that just sounds like you're doing something wrong
---
So in other words you don't know and haven't tried it yourself at all but myself and an entire group of people actively trying to test everything on PTS who have shown hard numbers are somehow wrong because you saw it on YouTube and decided to come in and act like an expert, did I get that all right? 
---
Dude, gtfoh unless you actually do something yourself and can show numbers, your opinion isn't needed when we're talking facts. 
---
Facts are that so far all the legendary effects tested so far are no longer stacking as initially would in live. They get some boost but fractional compared to live and less than appropriate builds definitely not the "last viable weapons"
---
That sounds exactly like something Vault-Tec would do lol
---
This is coming today? Are we getting another update today or are they just enabling it?
---
When i said unarmed in power armor i was talking about the fact that you cant use a dcg in a power armor ... u missed the whole point but its ok maybe i didnt made it clear enough ...
---
Buildings with cafeterias have a ton of aluminium trays.
---
That's possible.  I merely select the "Pick" option, then use bumpers to filter based on special I want.
---
decent gun? b handmades are one of the best in the game on live servers... thats upsetting :(
---
Correction, you contribute to the event for more than 30 seconds.
---
Mrs. Bean\*
---
No one knows.  There has not been bans yet and no comment from Bethesda.  If they did not ban for the container exploit I doubt they will ban for this.  Unfortunately, if they do not clear all blue prints it wont matter as people will continue to do it.  The same way they stopped allowing new stacked pungi boards but people still have them due to a having a blueprint.
---
Gauss shotty has explosive effects, right? Explosions cause way more degradation since it's based off of number of hits and not number of shots, which is just stupid but its what it is
---
So, it's not actually here at the time of post...
---
So what does everyone use for shotgun mods? I just unlocked the gun and will have a few hundred bullion to spend this week.
---
Only on pc though :'(
---
It doesn't impact on anyone except myself though where as all the rest of those things do, so if those things didn't get punished what makes you think I will get punished for this little infringement
---
Yeah, I'd rarther put on the Chinese stealth suit than power armor, still a much higher dps until the nerf.
---
Mics are my one and only deciding factor when I comes to groups, have a mic and know how to mute yourself. I‚Äôm not gonna mute anyone I‚Äôm gonna boot them for screaming singing eating or having ridiculous conversations on their phone or with their significant other , nobody cares about your personal life or wants to be an audience to ‚Äú I love you Babbbby ‚Äú ... ‚Äú I love yooouuu toooo babbbby ‚Äú ü§¢
---
Problem is, I find it hard enough to get ass/sent gear as it is. If it‚Äôs made legacy, it‚Äôll be worth even more for the PvP crowd and that‚Äôll make it *impossible* to get a hold of for the likes of me, who have god rolls and a legacy but nothing top of the line. I got those by grinding a thousand hours and trading my ass off, but because I refuse to spend real money I don‚Äôt have god rolled armor which is far more difficult to get than a god rolled weapon.
---
Umm ü§î rebalancing can go 2 ways either higher output or lower.. they decided to do it lower and hopefully cap it so it was be sustainable longer
---
This is a very misleading title. Downvote.
---
It‚Äôs more the point, that if you do get punished, you don‚Äôt have any excuse to say that ‚ÄúWell they didn‚Äôt get punished‚Äù.
---
Us console players are tired of this crap :(
---
My headcanon is that my character was born in the vault so that might explain why I didn't end up being too smart. I love that you can create old or young characters in this game and adjust their story as you see fit.
---
In a way, I'm okay with this. If there are problems with the hotfix, I'd rather they find out about it now, before the release on console.
---
I agree, this would be greatly appreciated.
---
I‚Äôm 160~ points not spent. That‚Äôs because I already have everything I need.
---
And if I need something specific I‚Äôll invest a point here and there. No harm done.
---
Comes in like an hour or 2 not sure if its just for pc tho :/
---
Im at the point where I seriously can't tell if this is a joke or not. I did hear something about a cusrsed pickaxe too!
---
Gaus shotguns are explosive by default, but was fine before the SCORE patch, literally the day that came out it broke everyday since, lasted weeks before that...same weapon :-)
---
What method is that? :O
---
That was anticlimactic.
---
Today, but only for PC.
---
Console players will need to wait a couple of days.
---
I'd like an extra 2 days of meat week for us consul peasants to give us something to do while we wait haha. I dying for some content, even meat week haha
---
Why mute when you can boot ? They obviously have issues with basic human communication , why bother trying ?
---
I have encountered this a couple of time with pipe revolvers.
---
This happens when you mod a pipe revolver with a certain mod combination: iirc a long barrel and a rifle stock. When you do, every other weapon defaults to unarmed. Removing the rifle stock immediately fixes the issue.
---
Best bet is using that build planner site someone else linked so you waste as few points as possible.  Unless you are after a super specific build you are going to end up having to waste a few points here and there in order to access the cards you ultimately need for your build. 
---
Without using a build planner it took me until level 75 or so to settle into my end build.  Had I used a planner I probably could have gotten there quite a bit sooner though.
---
[Nah he‚Äôs fine ](https://imgur.com/a/ZSmp5cb)
---
So no legendary drops?  How much scrip do you get?
---
I keep hearing a small whistling noise can any1  tell me what it is it bogs the hell out of me
---
Be careful what you wish for....Faschnact went on way too long for my taste. Rather than an extended event, I'm more interested in real content.
---
THAT POSTER IS MINE!!!!!!ü§£
---
Oh its sarcasm, but the cursed pickaxe is a real reward
---
Yup I run a high health sneak rifleman build, and well I think I'm fucked.
---
Cursed pick axe, shovel, and harpoon gun are on the table
---
Not true. Weapons, clothing, displayed items and plans all take up the majority of my stash space.
---
Theres a place I forget exactly where, it's on a road near helvetia or what ever going towards a ski resort, its a truck with around 10 ski poles giving 2 aluminium each, then I check every ski resort to get around 10 more poles each, typically top of the world is a good pick
---
It is ALREADY on PC in the PTS why continue testing it there! This is such bull crap!
---
Nothing is being balanced.  A balance would alter things (both up and down) so that different builds were closer to each other in power.  That is not what's happening, it's just making EVERYTHING do less damage.  If that's not a nerf, I don't know what possibly could be.
---
I get Cursed Harpoon Gun, seems like it's just a chance to get any cursed weapons - as far as I remember it's has higher damage, but also brake faster.
---
Faschnact was getting pretty stale towards the end there. But I live the primal cuts events, great place to kill a lot of enemies ya know? The meat week event itself is meh, but love my cuts
---
On my junkies chars, usually 100-130 lbs, on my PA char, usually about -900 lbs.
---
That was my first though when I heard haha
---
Radshield when you get the rads where you want them during fights.
---
Pretty sure its like 10 eastern time for PC
---
I'm hoping that when I get full reputation with the raiders I can get that ammo maker and that makes enough shells I will gladly delete it and never do it again or maybe even better people start selling shells for 1 cap instead of 2, but this game if full of if's but's and maybe's only time will tell which way it will go
---
I've already stopped bothering with him. I have plenty of treasury notes and max rep. His osmosis kit can stay stolen. That's my end game. Not dealing with Ward.
---
I do it every time I see it. I used to collect ore all the time but noticing that I (/others in my friend group) am the only one collecting ore every event, I have stopped collecting ore. It has become very rare to see people collecting the ore and not failing the event.  
---
Bad design.
---
All the events with a ! In them, and riding shotgun. Those are all the events that reward treasury notes
---
You can also get them from the 3 dailies from ward, crater, and davin
---
Its supposed to be just that
---
This is such F'ing bull crap! It is already on the PTS for PC! Just give it to us on console I would rather have it broke then not at all.

---
You need to understand that balancing work in parts 
---
They can‚Äôt rebalance weapons dmg.. then change the dps formula
---
It not a nerf because they change the dps formula from multiplying addition 
---
10x10 = 100 they did 10+10 = 20
---
They are spose to patch it today....allegedly.
---
PTS is not limited anyone with the Bethesda luncher can get on it. ANYONE!
---
I hear there were only 100 printed so its limited edition, good luck!
---
Have you actually tried to turn it in in the last couple of days?
---
I did it this weekend on a new char while it was bugged. Even though the molerat and wolf blood samples were unobtainable, the mission completed successfully with just the fuse and the ghoul sample.
---
The trees and shrubs you get from the atomic shop cant be placed on dirt tiles. That makes no sense as well. Was all excited to make a indoor garden but nope. Gold wasted. Thanks

Rule 6.
---
Not even excavator full set with 2 calibrated shocks can help me. Got lots of aid items with me thanks to the chem backpack i hover at 390 carryweight out of 450 (unyielding set + bloodied build + backpack mod ftw). I enter a pa, total weight jumps to 920. Excavator gives 200 bonus max
---
Cats are always cats. All animals can be anything else. Cats are cats.
---
and replace it with "wounding"
---
Well, considering majority of players are using bloody now, I think two other bloodies in your team would be really grateful for such a "punishment" that you make for all of them when you act like a 3yo kid doing that. Seriously, you don't get enough legendaries? Really? People here are constantly demanding to remove a daily scrip cap because they got they backpacks full of legendaries.
---
Who isnt? Its been irritating.
---
Oh good hopefully they do cause I really enjoyed the game up to this point
---
You see it as balance, I see it as a nerf.  I guess that's the end of the discussion.
---
Thanks for commenting
---
The only issue I have with this is the shit rewards from boss fights.
---
I'm not a high damage build to begin with but if I'm expected to dump a ton of ammo into the Queen and the Collossus and still get 1\* Whatever they can fuck right off with that bullshit.
---
Boss rewards need to be a guaranteed 3\* Weapon or Armor along with the Flux and a decent chance for a rare plan.
---
This. I've been trying my fixer and handmade and... Not so less damage. (Full health junkie). Although gutsies ARE STILL FUCKING BROKEN AND BROKE ALL THE FUCKING ARMOR PIECES.
---
The encrypted broadcasts are a series of radio broadcasts introduced in the Fallout 76 update The Legendary Run.  They are archived at the link I provided: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Encrypted_broadcasts.  So far as I know they are available, though they have to be decoded, in game.
---
The Scorched plague has, in fact, been dealt with.  Firstly, there is now a vaccine and it has been widely distributed.  I know because I helped make it and distribute it.
---
Assuming it works of course.  The Scorched plague has been described as "fungal" in origin...which is deeply unfortunate if true because currently, there are no immunotherapeutics or vaccines approved for the treatment or prevention of fungal infections.  May be possible in Fallout.
---
As to the Scorcbeasts themselves, the Fallout wiki speaks rather definitively on the subject:
---
"The only way to safely close the rifts was to launch nuclear missiles from one of three automated silos scattered across Appalachia, collapsing the rifts and killing those scorchbeasts that remain. None of the factions in Appalachia managed to achieve this feat, either due to a lack of means (Responders and Free States) or ideological opposition to the use of nuclear weapons (Brotherhood of Steel). Only the Vault 76 dwellers, entering Appalachia after humans were wiped out from the area, managed to push back the scorchbeasts and destroy them in nuclear attrition, preventing an extinction-level event."
---
They even provided a footnote to their source material:
---
https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs?t=28m16s
---
But after reviewing that link it was much less definitive than I would like.
---
The real problem is something called Gameplay and Story Segragation (see https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation).
---
In other words, gameplay clearly shows plenty of Scorched, plenty of Scorchbeasts and a never ending supply of Scorchbeast Queens.  Based on gameplay, well, it's not only not fixed it's actually worse than we thought as there are an endless number of Queens...
---
But on the story side, we have a vaccine, it works, it has been distributed.  No new Scorched are coming and we can kill them off over time.  The nukes close the fissures, the Queen is dead, we just have to clean up the remaining beasts and that's handled.
---
The problem is...the fissures reopen.  Is that a gameplay thing so that we can keep nuking them?  Yes.  Is it a story thing in that the fissures are reopened by the very Scorchbeasts that opened them in the first place?  Maybe?
---
There are many, many Queens.  Is that a gameplay thing so we can farm them for loot?  yes.  Is it a story thing and there just happen to be more than one?  Maybe?
---
So the story basically says it's handled and the gameplay does not.  Open to interpretation I suppose.
---
Damm im level 23 and got a level 15 laser pistol lol

I mean, some of the speech options with the overseer during the inoculation process are straight gold and are to your point of training them wrong
---
I think blueprinting the machine is already fixed on the PTS.
---
Well, the testers (including me) definitely do not look as distracted as it seems, the PTS thread about legendary perks is once again filled with negative feedback from people pointing out 95% of the same issues that've been there since two patches ago -))
---
Yes... I think we‚Äôre gonna see a lot of people leave over the rebalance
---
Bethesda in general needs to step up their game and treat 76 the way it should be. 76 should be the king of the castle, because it‚Äôs one of the most iconic video game series of all time.
---
Yes, one of the rarest plan drops.
---
I believe that band's name was Nuke Mine &amp; The Corpses.
---
but what about the people who have lower damage weapons like pistols and one handed melee. 
---
And yes 4 bullets from a furious lever gun to the head to kill a radstag is a bullet sponge.
---
Those nuclear winter ones are my favorites!
---
Yh ha ha any idea what time they plan to install the patch
---
That's probably Bethesdas attitude as well at this point.
---
No fix, works good enough, file as done.
---
Sorry, i might not have been clear enough.
---
I meant this bit from patch 21 
---
Legendary Loot: Daily Quests and Events have had their legendary loot rewards updated to include additional items, like The Fixer, Secret Service Armor, and others, so long as you‚Äôve learned the Plans for them.
---
So I've been doing all daily quests and most !events when i play, since patch 21 dropped, and only had the one bullion item from them.
---
War never changes.
---
not all of us
---
got mine last night. lived up to the hype!
---
Rare seems an understatement at this point...
---
Thanks.
---
I use a bloodied heavy weapons build, and my damage is getting cut by about 50% I think. But I'm not really unhappy, since 400+ damage per shot with my gauss minigun is an obnoxious amount of damage really. I shouldn't be killing a scorchbeast in like 10 shots.
---
I believe patches go live around 1200 EST/ 1700 BST
---
The deathclaw is now a threat that is good. They were to weak. But yeah everything is bullet sponges after the nerf. Not fun just like I and allot of people saying. All the yes men out there thinking it is going to make the game "fun" need to get a clue. They need to ballance the individual enemies not nerf out damage. Do actual fixes and tweaks not try and half ass fix it with a blanket nerf.
---
I'm not bloodied or junkies and can put out 1000+ damage with my shotgun (no magic) in the right circumstances (i.e. point blank against a scorchbeast). I play a shotgun/rifle build and a typical (in range, VATS or crouched) shot from either weapon yields 300-400 damage. I believe any weapon in the game is playable with the right perks. I may not be melting 3* legendary enemies, but I'm not having to run away either.
---
It‚Äôs still gonna be fine. It‚Äôs just going to make you deal twice or so the damage non bloodieds get, as well as being invisible
---
Ah ok cheers
---
Ghoul slayers weapon.
---
I have a FSS GS switchblade - unmodified by foods and such, 1 hits L42s and 2 hits L68s.
---
Yeah, and after all the negative feedback from people pointing out a plethora of issues raids had they happily launched 'em on consoles because... Well, Bethesda.
---
Hahahahahah! :D
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand how you could even have that much of an issue with needing shotgun shells, but that‚Äôs besides the point. Even if you stop, if the target people who did the glitch, you wouldn‚Äôt have a defense.
---
So i don‚Äôt understand people who assume they‚Äôll be fine then recommend other people do things
---
Well that's when they start the update and it's a couple of hours after that.
---
I only turned bloodied a few weeks ago bit bad my magic pump action shotgun before I did and that would one shot almost everything so it's not always the the build and is sometimes the weapon
---
Well I'm curious to see whether it will be different in the live game when it goes live today. I was wondering if that event is scaled more for the live game than the rebalance maybe? But doing it with a full team of heavy gun players was much more doable so I'm not sure. It would be really disheartening if the event is basically only do-able for heavy gun users... though I mean if the rewards aren't based on damage dealt, it would be nice to have some people go in there specifically to kill the wendigo spawns I guess, idk that was all I could contribute.
---
I got 6 of them hidden under a junk extractor.
---
Using Bethesda mechanics.
---
I don't feel bad with everything they put us through.
---
The devs hate you anyway.
---
I remember playing destiny 1 back in the day and everytime there was an exploit discovered,bungie fixed it not long after.
---
The ammo ammunition is not an exploit anymore. It's been part of the game since launch.
---
Down vote this suckers ü§ò

I have always felt making flux is to demanding, you should just need nuked flora  and ultracite.   Why a mini nuke can‚Äôt make the flora is beyond me too.

If private teams got bonus then Public would never get used

Does anyone know if the sneak damage bonus is going to be affected by this change in the same way as the other bonuses i.e. will it remain 2x the total damage or change to 2x the base damage added on to the total?
---
All are welcome at the cookout
---
Nah that's a pretty casual build, my optimized bloodied can pull 2k damage with a bloodied hunting rifle but my unoptimized build does way less damage like 600. I still think bloodied will be king because they just have such a high damage output. And most sneak rifleman rely on being able to one shot normal mobs to avoid being  fucked by the regular mobs. I also am extremely worried about my pistol build and non legendary fixer.
---
I have an outfit and, random worthless item problem. It's hoarding at this point. Also the game likes to give me nukes and rockets that I hold onto for my wife to use my pain in the ass ammo converter. I use to just toss them but, she insisted it's better to convert than make.
---
Absolutely Lousy and Purposedly Horrible Application?
---
You can simulate this now by using only crafted weapons and armor on the live server.  That's basically how it feels on the PTS; I'm doing less damage, dying more, and using more ammo and chems.
---
Get a quad missle launcher, put a quad barrel and targeting hud on it.
---
Any events that reward legendaries, Like scorched earth or encrypted, can now also reward you you guns and armor if you have learned the plans.
---
I have never seen anything more bounty-worthy.
---
They are included with this week's hotfix. 
---
FYI, this information has been posted from Bethesda (ITV) and on this subreddit many times.

160? What level are you lol

Be team leader, invite your friends, kick other people.

Thanks!

Just realize its also mixed in with all the other weapons in the game, so getting a weapon that was introduced with wastelanders is gonna be rare.
---
Big freds bbq shack?
---
lmao, bloody is still the strongest build, this update is just pushing more people to use it.
---
Just another reason to not bother with Ultracite PA. The drop rates in this game are seriously garbage.
---
I know, you get sold short every time.
---
I got a Fallout 76 pint glass as pressie, couldn't believe how much less a US pint is compared to a UK pint lol, would be riots in our pubs is they passed that off as a pint.... :-)
---
Would AWOL work too?
---
How about dailies... been doing Heart of the enemy, Cop squatter etc...
---
There was a glitch that allowed multiple traps to be stacked on each other.
---
Yep. And change nocturnal to something like "troglodytes". Instead of based on time of day it has a damage bonus for not being in direct sunlight, so you get the bonus in tunnels, buildings, rad zones, pretty much everywhere if ur not in sunlight, and buff the damage. The mutants change you suggest shouldve happened ages ago....10%?! Bruh.....
---
Well thats your opinion and ik for a fact thats not the same for everybody :)
---
I'll have to tinker around with it then. Looks a bit complex but I'll get it. I'm only level 21 and wasted a few points but it's nothing terrible. At least there's a recovery of sorts.
---
&gt; world which still feels empty
---
Sound like those people that just ran through the quest to power level. Never read the notes or listened to the types. Had a lot of people tell me the game was empty in the early days. When I asked them about certain thing like mistress of mysteries quest for instance they had no idee what I was on about.
---
It is known.
---
They are hidden under foundation s
---
Try north of Huntersville. Between Emmett Mountain and the Blood Eagles base on the way to West-Tec. There‚Äôs a rest stop on a hairpin there that sounds like shat you‚Äôre describing.
---
What console you on?
---
The event isn't really worth it, you're not missing out on anything substantial, believe me.
---
No, you are right.
---
I know that, it was just fun to call them "Carnivores" and post a few vids of them eating meat.  ;)
---
You're so late it's today it's "not launching" on console lol :-)
---
PC.
---
Did you just join this subreddit? People don't stop complaining about anything even before the game was released.
---
I got Sludge Lung on Saturday or Sunday, startled me to see it on my screen. Checked the challenge and it was still showing I didn't have it. I'm not about to go jumping servers to fix Bethesda's problem.
---
&gt; Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.
---
*Well, uh, that doesn‚Äôt apply to me because, uh, I need a shortcut and I‚Äôm impatient and stuff.*
---
I don‚Äôt get why people think that someone else violating a rule gives them justification to do the same. They think they‚Äôre advocating ‚Äòfair treatment‚Äô but that‚Äôs not the case. 
---
Fair treatment would be everyone Th at violates the ToS faces som sort of consequence, ranging from a warning all the way up to permanent ban (or even civil/criminal charges for those extreme cases).
---
Which makes no sense.  Why this one PA remains singled out.  You can obtain those shocks for either caps or gold for every-other PA set.
---
Ward's got style, you know what I mean?
---
Before making drastic changes, make sure you're fully perked for the weapon you like. Don't forget things like tank killer and bloody mess. Every bit helps.
---
Quality advice for many builds!  Thank you.
---
I'm pretty sure once you have your private team made you can then change it to public and get all the benefits
---
Let me correct this: everyone's gonna be shafted since they don't listen to 98% of the feedback we leave on the pts forums.
---
Yeah I told you over and over pvp is a nightmare in pc and would rather not have one. There's no back and forth about this it was removed for a reason and for the first time in a long time pc users are playing in peace at last and you are literally asking people to ruin it
---
I think the change is pretty much global, i.e. all events or dailies that have a chance to drop a legendary now use the same drop lists for 1\*/2\*/3\* legendary items as the purveyor and can thus drop The Fixer, Bear Arm, gold bullion weapons etc. as long as you have learned the plans. And that means pretty much all of them, AFAIK, since they all (or almost all) have a chance, albeit sometimes only a small one, to drop a legendary, albeit maybe only a 1\*.
---
If you dont like a daily, you can ignore it and the next day it will be removed from possible daily triggers. Thrill of the Grill and Someone to talk to are constantly available to me and I ignore them so other quests will populate instead
---
The "Event: A Colossal Problem" will award: stims, flux, 8 treasury notes, up to 3* mystery pick and the following:
---
Reclaimed Deep Mining Gas Mask:        5%
---
Plan: Wendigo Colossus Heads:          9.5%
---
Cursed Pick Axe:                       12.825%
---
Plan: Wendigo Colossus Skin Rug:       14.535%
---
Cursed Harpoon Gun:                    17.442%
---
Plan: Wendigo Colossus Plushie:        18.3141%
---
Cursed Shovel:                         12.311145%
---
Plan: Meat Pile:                       10.072755%
---
AWOL rewards an armor piece. But I think it's gotta be rewarded from the event. I think it may only be scorched earth and encrypted. Like when it pops up on the screen without you having to loot an enemy, that's what they're talking about
---
a random person placed a few in my camp, what about us, the victim's? I dont think people are going to get banned for this tbh. They didn't get banned for the turret glitch and they didnt get banned for the vendor glitch either. Bethesda doesnt have a system in place to detect this. Only reported players will get banned, but Honestly they should just fix the base building system. Its all types of broken. Im able to actually get any extractor in my base, this glitch was introduced with wastelanders and not many people know about it.
---
Domes 2, 3 and 7 are accessible. ;)
---
Oh, that's a relief, thank you :D
---
I thought three of them were accessible, the one with the xo-1 quantum paint, the one with the nuka cola cherry t51b and the one with the alien fusion mag
---
If they leave over that then that‚Äôs kinda sad. Maybe they should have branched out
---
Our God!üôè
---
ACP is a permanent addition to the game, not a limited time event.
---
Same. Being able to one-shot things, because I am aiming at heads, is uh.. logical. If I shoot a mutant in the skull, I mean, it should die.
---
Well considering how many people complained when it was in beta pre release, I don't think it would make a difference and it would be nice, but most beta games don't release updates that often anyway
---
Quite literally yesterday's news.
---
If it doesn't patch there is a work around on private servers.....if your on ps4 you could use mine
---
In case of Bethesda it's the engine. Engine never changes.
---
Not to be rude, but have you actually read the post? I wanna make the Demoman from TF2.
---
If I didn‚Äôt give a shit about visuals I could go for the AGL right away. But I do, so that‚Äôs not an option. ML would be even worse...
---
Last I checked it‚Äôs not gone it‚Äôs just harder. And if you taking it from me make you happy then yeah even if it ruins your time more I‚Äôm still fine with that. That‚Äôs just your view not the view.
---
Almost every other. 
---
Strangler Heart PA is the other one as it's basically Ultracite. Pisses me off, I have the PA since ages but with these drop rates I'll probably get the plans a week before they shut down the game.
---
Rate of fire is the key here.  Sniper rifles have relied on heavy shots to be effective, unlike machine guns.  Full auto is still excellent on the PTS.  Slow, heavy weapons were affected more by the new damage calculations, and cannot deal with the stronger high level enemies.
---
When you can only fire once every second or so, it‚Äôs important for that shot to count.  It was the only way sniper rifles could remain competitive within the shorter ranges and quicker pace of 76.
---
As long as Betas are f2p idc but a beta can‚Äôt be full price and beta I can‚Äôt rationalize that
---
Around 320 having been on since I did legendary run so I can‚Äôt be more accurate.
---
its stuck there forever. ive heard moving your camp multiple times clears it out but havent tried it myself.
---
I'm not recommending anybody do it and I honestly think people who have loads is taking it to far, I think of it as a QoL perk simply because I don't have to jump around looking for my ammo type as much, but can you tell me what is the difference between that ammo maker and the one that you get off the raiders cause they both do the same thing right ? ü§î
---
Could be a Secret service piece or strangler...
---
And that says nothing of dailies...
---
anyways thanks a lot, it seems there just is not a clear cut info on this then.
---
Enjoy the murdering....
---
Hiw long have you played?
---
Thousands of people have left and are leaving, and if they had any talent in the dev department they wouldn't be introducing 15 bugs for each fix, it's trash and you're not even a dev your opinion doesn't matter
---
I'm told thee is not.  You might try moving your camp and just not placing it back down to see if that helps?
---
As a bloodied rifle/pistol build, I would be fine with the nerf if building your character still greatly affected damage output. On the live servers, adding perks like rifleman, gunslinger, etc. boost your damage by a considerable margin. On the PTS it‚Äôs only like 30 more. Captainoob showed this off in his most recent livestream as well. What‚Äôs the point of investing nine perk points if this is all you get?
---
Fix what, exactly?
---
Just before pioneer scouts
---
Did you report the person and immediately move your camp to get rid of it? Why did you even accept a random private team invite?
---
Blueprints and camps are stored server side, it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to scan the files to see whom has either to determine to ban them or not.
---
It all comes down to if it‚Äôs a big enough issue for them to tackle
---
I've gotten SS armor and a Gauntlet from those events. And np
---
Course they would. People you don‚Äôt know would be used in Public teams. People who aren‚Äôt your friends on Xbox, so they can‚Äôt build on your CAMP etc.
---
They're are going to nerf EVERYTHING, specially all the melee related stuff.
---
Quit complaining guys, it is in the game. You aren't allowed to complain if something is in the game, nor are you allowed to get mad at people who just want to be dicks to others.
---
They placed 20 and u used them all? Yeah totally innocent
---
For the obnoxious twonk, haters gonna hate! Jealousy is a miserable beast that a lot of people can not conquer!  The community here and on the game are one of the best I have encountered ever. Good luck to you and your expand. Can't wait to check out the updates!
---
Yes it is.  So now that you can buy that for of PA for gold, why not the shocks too?  It is like buying a car and not being able to purchase breaks.  Oh, have fun playing one event 500x for a less than 1% chance to get breaks.
---
This for sure.
---
I feel like Bethesda was going to do more, but ran out of time and just moved on. Ward literally tells you that the people around Foundation need a lot of help if you willing to ask around. THEN NONE OF THEM NEED HELP! I really thing they were going to do something more robust.
---
As stupid as it might sound, I absolutely think that there are too many weapons in the game, so many of them are useless and used by no one either.
---
Feels like weapons like rolling pins should be taken out of legendary pool.
---
The pieces I'm swapping are T-65.
---
From what I‚Äôm hearing you can‚Äôt. May have to build another camp but someone mentioned that the budget space is still used up from that glitch. Hope I‚Äôm wrong and misunderstood others talking about this same issue.
---
Why not just make it so there is only one weapon of each class? Why shod they all be equal? Pipe guns are for crude beginners
---
I've done all of that but that doesn't make the world feel less empty. Notes and holotapes that are the same boring things we've seen in every other open world game don't really add much when every game tries to do that these days. Also doesn't help how generic most are and they literally are just typical "oh no dead world" with like 5 whole interesting stories. Mistress of Mysteries is an exception, but one of the very few exceptions.
---
Like hell Halo ODST does it better with interesting voice logs in a dead and empty area and that's not even a true open world game. I'm also aware I'm comparing Halo era Bungie writing and world building to Bethesda's skeleton crew F Team which is kinda unfair.
---
You can AFK.  Just AFK while on the drums or cooking spit. 
---
And the rewards you get are complete RNG. My first Meat Week event, I got there quite late and wasn‚Äôt even sure what to do. After looking around for less than five seconds, the event completed, and I got The Tenderizer. I originally thought that must just be a guaranteed reward for everyone the first time. 
---
Turns out it wasn‚Äôt. I just got extremely lucky. 
---
I still feel a little but bad that I got one of the best rewards for doing nothing but just showing up, and late at that.
---
Not just my view, that's now pc users see it as. I really envy console users just for the fact you can play pvp normally. Seeing how console users keep asking for pvp is actually amazing. I'm thinking it must be really good there. But it's nothing but a nightmare fuel on pc
---
So you was around when you could use rifle and pistol perks on the pipe revolver and the bolt action.  They took it away couple patches ago so I don't think they are in a hurry to buff those guns.
---
the rate of ammo production is much better on the one from the factory because it‚Äôs intended to be a contested PVP resource
---
It disappears when you move your camp, but it will always take some of your building budget until Bethesda does something to this glitch.
---
I've  found that his dialog doesn't glitch if you stop mashing the skip dialog button and just let him say his lines.  I haven't had a problem with him since.  and the osmosis kit seems to be stuck in my inventory so I just talk to Ward, tell him I'll find his stuff and then talk to him again and go "Here's your stuff"
---
Impressive! I wish I was above 50 I can't imagine how long that took
---
Wasn‚Äôt explosive bait exploit patched?
---
OK then
---
They've removed stuff before. So maybe they will. Can't stand rolling pins and tire irons
---
I don't know if this is known or not but the Legendary Purveyor has moved to the Rusty Pick. She is no longer at the Berkley Springs train station.
---
Seems people don't know what objective means. They threw it around a lot after the launch. Saying F76 is objectively a bad game, while all they knew about the game was what some youtuber told them.
---
Not just SBQ. I got mine finally from a Scorchbeast at Line in the Sand.
---
My point is that advantages of a private team are lost on public teams (camp building, opening locked doors, shared XP etc). Then the public advantages are lost of the private teams (team type benefit). So you‚Äôd can‚Äôt get all the bonuses in one team.
---
Yea, it'd give me a choice if the junk is worth running to my camp with a bounty. And just helping out everyone in general to keep their junk more often
---
Literally never played TF2. All I can suggest for visuals is use an explosive combat shotgun and hope nobody notices it‚Äôs not actually a grenade launcher
---
Thanks !
---
The Mole Miner Treasure Event, my first reward was the Croc Plan. Figured it was common. Good ol' RNG
---
For example a vacuum tube lamp, and right now im stuck on free states bunker
---
I would love a buff to all lower end stuff. At least you can super buff certain pipe guns to make them viable.
---
Yeah my bad catching up from yesterday‚Äôs news just now!
---
My friends and I though the same but previous poster is correct.  Start your private team with your homies and convert to public in the options.  Now you're private team gets the benefits! As leader you'll have the option to kick unwanted members or if a homie gets dc'd you can kick someone to invite back.
---
Yep I was catching up on yesterday‚Äôs news and just seen it. 
---
Just seen yesterday‚Äôs post too! #mybad
---
I just see legendary perks as added benefit. It‚Äôs not needed but it‚Äôs there.
---
Not to mention you can use any legendary perk right off at 1 star.
---
Follow the road down the mountain and you should see it on the right.
---
Typical chickenshit commie manoeuvre!
---
Yeah maybe buff the pistol and rifle to deal a little more damage
---
yes, this is a low-effort shit post
---
There was a glitch where you could blueprint the ammo machine at the Converted Munitions Factory.  Once you blueprinted it you could build it repeatedly in any other workshop or your camp.  I don't know if Bethesda has fixed the original glitch but they haven't done anything about people who already have the blueprint.
---
Dude get the Batteries included perk on int at rank 3 it reduced the weight 90%  I carry 5k 2MM and 20+ fusion core on me most of the weight no issue with weight 
---
If you use the power user it also double the fusion core to 1k rounds for Gatling leaser too
---
If the patch doesnt do anything for ya, I managed to bypass it be restarting the game fully, plugging in the T-plug, then reading every single message on the terminal first, then selecting mix blood samples. 
---
It's weird, its like it doesn't tick that you've actually read the terminal.
---
A bloodied pipe pistol was op back in the day....i think.all guns need more mods....like can I get a .44 receiver for my gatlin gun or 10mm sub...or mabye a silence for the sub.....
---
The exploit has been around since BETA but it's just now gaining traction. It just requires a flat area.
---
So by doing this you‚Äôre saying the then converted public team would still get the private team advantages also?
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
Fanks didn‚Äôt know thisüëç
---
Wait, it‚Äôs not?  I‚Äôve got like eight of those in my stash.
---
&gt;!;)!&lt;
---
It doesn't make that much to be fair, my main issue with it is once you have it you can in have it, once you place it it can't be moved or deleted the only way to get rid is by deleting your whole camp
---
What are you supposed to do with it? Repair it? Tried a Tinkers Workbench under Quest Items?
---
Also, you can do that sort of challenges by simply going to one of the low level zones where mobs are still capped at level 25. Don't see any problem with that.
---
Exactly why I posted it.
---
I totally agree with needing a surpressor for the 10mm smg
---
Subreddit has rules against discussing how to perform exploits. You can find it pretty quickly if you Google it.
---
There are lots of Early Access games on Xbox that get frequent, constant updates. I'm betting if tiny indie devs can figure it out, perhaps Bethesda could too?
---
Now it is yeah but you can‚Äôt give up on what could be better. Doubt all pc players want it removed. You know since I also play pc. Envy me more so for wanting things better and not for taking thing away because they put me in my feels. So are we done here now? You‚Äôve turned from the original talking point several times and am now just getting dismissive comments from me. Again. Not asking for pvp it‚Äôs already in the game which I guess you keep forget by saying they removed it, but more so for it to work.
---
Gatling lasers are awful on the pts
---
Can someone else mod your SH PA?  Or is that PA locked only to your character like SS PA?
---
Replying to your other post.
---
It would be worth the bounty to break into those things and change the ammo type to .38
---
all 1 star legendary perks are unlocked from the start, you gain more slots per level benchmark. to level up the legendary perks though, you  would need the coins (and to switch out perks)
---
Okay, so its been delayed because they can't push the patch till Friday or whatever. They're not gonna be able to start meat week if they can't push a patch till Friday no patch = no meat week.
---
Instigating is and always will be the best. Bloody gets 1 star out of five for the ridiculous damage it causes, not even an argument. The other four stars jump directly into the toilet if we are rating it as a build honestly. The build as a whole is trash and zero fun compared to a stealth instigating or heavy gunner PA , playing either is  100% more funner on the funsimportant scale
---
I wanna be seal team 6 with some super baddies......let me live my dreams bethesda!
---
Long enough lol.
---
It'd be awesome if the contracted azir for some hairstyles. Their ponytail mod in fallout 4 is great.
---
OK Karen
---
It's mind-blowing to me that they didn't decide to tie the perk points to raw level ups instead of this convoluted system of scrapping cards which causes some people to miss out on a lot.
---
We want the ability to scrap cards but just for the sake of doing it!  Not to have it tied to legendary perks.  It's just weird to me the way they are going about this when it can be tied to your overall level and just be extremely simple and straightforward.
---
Holy shit....are...wait.....no...
---
Of course i did.
---
Why not let every weapon have a silencer
---
Everyone says this and it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve done it before in multiple camps and my camp budget is back to normal once you change camps.
---
I had proposed making Pipe Weapons more flexible - like being able to add whatever receiver you wanted (up to and including the .50) with a decrease in overall durability.
---
As it is, once people can get the combat rifle or handmade, pipe weapons become obsolete.
---
Now thats a good point, i know for sure you can't open locked doors or whatever  of public teammates. Worth a shot to see if you can after the conversion still with your homies. ü§î
---
I'm gonna wait for an official announcement, if that's cool.
---
It does not use any camp budget. It's worth zero flamingos. You are correct that they are stuck after placing. You have to move your camp to fix it.
---
&gt;but similarly to how bloody was hit the hardest, high single shot damage  was similarly reduced by a larger amount, because the multiplicative  effects compounded into high damage numbers.
---
I understand that bloodied builds were hit the hardest because they use multiple damage boosts. I just don't understand how you apply the same logic to single shot weapons because they have the same amount of damage boosts as automatic weapons. Technically single shots will receive the same DPS reduction as autos percentage wise, right?
---
And letting you grind less? No way.
---
Well one of them doses you full of rads when you go near it, so that implies it‚Äôs more than just an empty dome. I‚Äôve been in all 8, and only four of them have anything inside. Three are legitimately accessible, while one that isn‚Äôt has a variety of common junk items while the others are empty.
---
He's definitely not your "friend."
---
Fair point
---
Nice find.
---
No idea, to be honest. I would like to mod it myself so I can swap out mods as I need them. :)
---
Now I wanna se if after 450 points,my gun will actually be 40% stronger while sneaking or just gain 10 damage,with the new damage modifers
---
Huh, I didn't realize the Mask was that low. Pulled it during the previous PTS.  
---
No use to me, but it's pretty neat looking.
---
Fuck at least this time it was the day before not reading the patch notes. Someone going around down voting and flaming anyone who complains about bethesda these last few days. Wonder what the pay rate is, I'll start defending em lmfao.
---
Haha, were all in the same boat, even if not bloodied people will still be upset. Good thing about PTS is that bethesda has been put on notice by the feedback. They have now until patch 22 release to tweak the formula.
---
Excuse me but I still haven't officially found Beckley and Abandoned Bog Town
---
Oh im definatly nervous, because while i dont want an easy ride when playing, i dont want to shoot the living crap out of something and then it kills me, i can start a new character for that experiance.
---
I feel your pain.  I have almost all plans for Ultracite/SH besides the shocks.  Maybe someday they'll adjust the drop rate chance just like the plasma grenade plan had done.
---
Adios, snowflakes
---
It's like console users taking a dump at the upstream and pc users have to drink that water at the downstream. You guys be like, we need better shitting condition we need more toilet paper we need water purifier for people downstairs we should eat more veggies cause out shit stink but no. We'd rather like it if you did not take that dump in the first place. Dump is a dump. We don;'t want it
---
Yh I'm on ps4
---
Steam players can't either unfortunately...
---
Haha, alright my bad.
---
I just figured everyone had at least contact with TF2 at some point in their life (like memes or somesuch) :P
---
The CS would be the next best thing in terms of visuals I guess, but it‚Äôs not the same as lobbing grenades. It‚Äôs also a matter of principle for me.
---
Every rifle can be modded to hell and back, with attachments for every conceivable slot, different receivers, you name it. The heavy weapons get a barrel mod and a prime receiver if they‚Äôre lucky :(
---
I want some sort of progression for the low end heavies (like the M79 for example). Right now it‚Äôs the worst launcher (not counting the Broadsider because that one is just trash lol) and the next best launcher would be the auto grenade launcher, which is a HUGE step. It feels like there‚Äôs no middle ground there - and a drum on the M79 could solve that imo
---
Also it would look cool üëÄ
---
Well, good, what do you see in the workbench? Does the item even show up?
---
What's the quest you are currently doing? 
---
Is it really that hard to provide some more info? Jesus christ...
---
What I'm trying to say is that maybe it would have been more successful to have tried making the changes to an existing game rather than creating a whole new game. That way there only focus would have to have been making and optimising the netcode.
---
Is that feasible in that time? Who knows, I aint a game dev. Is it possible that implementing it in a more complicated game could have led to more conflicts and errors even with a team working solely on it? Maybe.
---
At the least I do think that a buggy DLC would have been more easily accepted and forgiven than 76 has been. It's really clear to see just how badly 76 has burned Fallout and Bethesda as a brand to lots of people.
---
that were some truly hot beans
---
Most countries don't allow gambling
---
Don't listen to them.
---
Bethesda doesn't mind at all or they would easily fix it.
---
I never experienced lag with this Easter egg.
---
mm, scorch quest bean brain tacos - my favourite (the firecracker berry salsa isn't particularly appetising though).
---
It also can be worked around by doing the quest on a fresh private server, if your on pc and the hot fix doesn't fix the bug I can friend you and hopefully you'll be able to to it in a private first world
---
That would be very useful
---
Look it up on YouTube it‚Äôs a 3 minute video. It‚Äôs so easy it sounds like clickbait. Learn how to make 50k ammo in an hour with this one easy life hack! It‚Äôs almost embarrassing someone didn‚Äôt try it earlier.
---
Yeah I agree on that. It def was a let down reading the notes and saying hold on wait it‚Äôs not coming. But yeah I was also thinking maybe it‚Äôs a Bethesda employee that is picking fights with someone that complains about it. Lol
---
Hell yeah dude! What platform?
---
I feel the stuff removed like rippers and Mr Handy buzz hands were removed since it was easier to do than to fix the issues with these weapons, probably same with the Dragon.
---
Same way they made Energy/explosive legacy instead of fixing the issues with these weapons.
---
So as long as as rolling pins and tire irons are working as intended, they will likely stay in the legendary pool, to the chagrin of the players.
---
Ah unfortunately I'm on ps4 but thanks for the offer
---
We would definitely have one dude with a glitched fatman infinitely firing and then the game would crash.
---
oh ok ive seen those fights, i usually just leave 'em be, will take a more active role next time
---
Pretty sure they're in there for the sole purpose of cashing them in for points. If all you got was good stuff then you wouldn't want to get rid of it thus halting your progress.
---
It should be even be better once VATS is fixed, if ever?  Tired of 95% hits missing 3x in a row.
---
No. Both bloodied and junkie's weapons are still better than AA, although AA looks like a hot contender for the 3rd rank on any builds that do not use armor penetration perks and don't want to go the bloodied or junkie's route. (On long boss fights, Furious might still edge it out, but only just).
---
FWIW Tank Killer is a 16% multiplicative damage boost on all but the very weakly armored targets, meaning that is applies to your total boosted damage. And given the overall lowered damage levels, the perk is bound to be more universally useful since it's now less likely that you'll be able to do the 6.6\*DR raw damage necessary to ignore armor on a mob.
---
Well it's their business.
---
They paid for it.
---
I have 140 levels saved up. Wont make a dent in the legendaries and leave me stranded if I ever need something or a respec due to their new balancing scheme. I will just use the base levels and leave it at that. I cant even grind out 1 full card over the rest of the games lifespan.
---
It's impossible to hoard ammo without the bandolier perk. At least it's only two ranks for 90% reduction.
---
Bethesda wants the ammo as currency market crushed. Seems to be crushed.
---
Aaaagggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
---
Thats because it never did anything before, if you use weapon mods for armor pen and perk cards that is.
---
There is no shared xp on any team, to get xp and loot for a kill you have to deal some damage on the enemy. 
---
As for using locked doors and building at a friend's camp, I was under the impression that as long as your friends were on your team they could do so and vice versa. And I mean the people you play with are added as friends on your friend list. Its been a while since I've played with my friend but I've used public teams since they launched and I was still able to use his locked doors and build at his camp.
---
Yeah, I'm putting my money on the latter, but we'll see.
---
.....yes.
---
SOMEBODY GIVE ME A TARGET!
---
A grind to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
*not*
---
It is the one from the munition factory, it‚Äôs a glitch. Once placed it can‚Äôt be removed, since it isn‚Äôt actually a camp item, but it does function the same way.
---
Yeah it would be a bit strange to put 8 on the map and only give you access to 3.. Hopefully they will use them for future content. I didn't realise that one of them had X01 Quantum skin. Upon further investigation, it seems like that was added in the wild apalachia update, so they do seem to be adding content in them
---
You're at -6 but OK 0
---
You'd think it would be easy to address, but on the other hand they STILL haven't cleaned up hacked impossible weapons, and that's a bigger exploit that could also easily be identified from stored data.
---
Lol my point here. Again I play both a fact you just won‚Äôt listen to that speaks to you not wanting to face facts. You don‚Äôt like this feature but it‚Äôs in the game and will be in it. You don‚Äôt have to like it. You telling me I can‚Äôt have pvp in a game I paid for and already has it, is like you thinking you know what‚Äôs best for everyone else because you‚Äôve done it. Nah bro. The only dump I see is you trying to carry this on with no points in sight or any ground to stand on. It‚Äôs here, it‚Äôll stay, it can get better. Like it or not.
---
What about in a private world where it wouldn't affect anyone?
---
Dunno man my bloodied Gauss minigun shoots about 5000 caps per minute worth of ammo I kind of expect it to kill quickly...
---
Yeah I made plans for off for the event start
---
I'm having problems with that too and getting a photo of generator for the possum challenge
---
A note for all those "casuals" saying I'm not bloodied or junkied because blablabla. You don't need to be hardcore to try to do the most damage. I DIDN'T launch a single nuke yet and I consider myself pretty casual because I didn't do raids either and yet I want to have an optimized build. WTF comparing normal weapons with legendaries? Is it legendary for nothing?
---
Upvote. Of course. 
---
PS: I'm lvl 280 and not hardcore but those changes need to be reallllllly adjusted.
---
No we won‚Äôt. Well just read about people saying they are.
---
The system sucks as it is, it's as simple as that, I dont know nor have seen anyone that likes the way it's done, that's saying something...
---
what about meat week? will be on Thursday as planned? on friday with wendigo? or on sunday two days after the wendigo?
---
WHY IS THIS FLOOR ON THE FLOOR
---
Fallout 4 had a lot of valid criticism that people seemed to forget. Nostalgia has put the game on a pedestal. Some of things they did in F4 was already bad enough that I wasn't even upset with the bad decision in F76.
---
The ammo factory has two connections for power and if I remember correctly you connect the power to the terminal on the first in the line and then connect all subsequent ones to the top of the factory body and then you use the one terminal and it sets it for all in the line
---
It might not be as wide spread, and it likely isn‚Äôt impacting all platforms the same. I agree it‚Äôs a huge issue, but do you solve for something only affecting PC players or affecting everyone?
---
I wish one of them had a unique armor piece or weapon. Or even a legendary set of T-60, a secret BoS cache! T-60 matches the BoS‚Äôs MO, and it‚Äôs not totally OP. Maybe 1* and you can choose between each of the 23 legendary effects? Or would Unyielding power armor be a bit much?
---
I just skipped right to t-65 for the same reason dude....ive now got the full set of t-65 with appropriate mods and still no cs for ultracite....    : /
---
Lucky most of my CAMPs are near max build and nobody can do this to me.  For once, I'm happy not to have too much extra build budget remaining.
---
Yeah, best friend! Free ammo!
---
I couldn't even do Someone to Talk To on a public server--animals missing.   They were there on private server, tho.
---
If you can test this for me, as I don't have them, I'll update the list. If I can get it detailed enough I'm going to upload it to the wiki.
---
From what I understand, this build won't really be affected by the change.  It's only non-perk card buffs and legendary effects that have a % change to damage that are affected  e.g. adrenal reaction and bloodied/junkie's weapons.  That's assuming the only change is the one changing % buffs from multiplicative to additive.
---
Yeah and surprisingly a couple days later I got Targeting HUD from SBQ. Extremely lucky week.
---
No you don't play on pc. Even if you do, you don't pvp here. Bring all your friends to pc and I assure you a single tryhard will own all of you and camp the shit out of you. I don't play on console but I watch pvp videos on youtube. You guys suuuuuck. A single tryhard with an aimhack and hacked 50cals gonna demolish a whole lobby. Console pvp looks fun tho I admit. But that's only because theres no hacks
---
Pipe weapons are weak, but have the most flexibility and are cheap to repair. That‚Äôs the trade off.
---
Until your budget is exceeded, you can't get rid of it, and BGS starts banning players with the glitch.
---
Honestly the whole "objective vs subjective" debate is the easiest way to lose my interest in a conversation lol
---
not even upset about getting downvoted for it
---
Honestly I like the progression system in NW. I would love to see something similar used to replace the reputation grind currently in game. Imagine ranked skins. Like a 20 or 30 rank system for the raiders and settlers that give armour, gun, and power armour skins. Nothing fancy, just flat colours, like pink, blue, cobalt, etc.
---
I‚Äôm a girl but point taken, lol!
---
The only answer to the problem is a shitty one.
---
Limit everyone‚Äôs d.p.s in events.
---
Yes, it means a high failure rate without enough participants.
---
But, if people aren‚Äôt doing events anymore because of 1 shot builds, I can‚Äôt think of any other way besides awarding everyone a legendary every time a legendary ad gets killed.
---
That would lead to a lot more people afk-ing events though.
---
I have the key to the Xo1 paint if you want me to hop servers and get it for you
---
I've got two stealth rifleman characters, one bloodied one with TSE/AAE. Looks like I'm getting hit with every nerf.
---
That's fair enough. I have no illusions (and I hope Bethesda is the same here too) that this is the beginning &amp; not the end of combat balance.
---
The console/platform makers/owners charge for every patch/update that's pushed out, that's why PTS is Beth launcher only
---
You'd think they'd focus on exploits from a game sold on their own storefront and launched from their own launcher. After all, it has their name on it.
---
Or for those still skeptical, use workshops instead of your camp. Zero harm done that way
---
I think Ward got life. It's sentient. It's a synth. Not even Bethesda can control him.
---
I don‚Äôt see why people are so mad that they have to play the game now
---
That still works. Double dipping was only patched out for the meat hook.
---
Neither can the water items.
---
Obviously, there needs to be a balance of items, but there is still a vast quantity of mediocre or vastly under-utilised weapons in the game, and with the crappy way of changing builds, most people are not gonna use all that many different weapon types, even among the good to great ones.
---
Also, even 3* legendary enemies seem to have a low chance to drop the 3* items which players prefer over 2 or 1* items.
---
Add in the vast variety of weapon perks available, and the very few that are actually desirable, and you have a loot table that practically never rewards player for trying to grind legendary weapons.
---
And the in game trading system is a mess, as are currencies.
---
So I still fee like curating the legendary weapon pool could do some good, don't get rid of everything, but make it so players that grind out legendary can get a good loot slightly more frequently.
---
I would check your cards- you should have all rifleman or commando (the first rank, expert, master- all maxed), demo expert maxed out, tank killer is nice too. I run concentrated fire as well since I use VATS. I run at 20% health at all times and I think the pip boy shows 440 damage or (close to it).
---
Bethesda gave Xbox early access to their BETA, too. I'm sure Microsoft would be happy to work out a deal.
---
For me it's always been a level 21^Crown Deathclaw.
---
Nope. Strangler heart is non tradable so you have to mod it yourself
---
Good post. This deserves more traction but for some reason the stuff that does well on this forum is usually Bethesda backing posts
---
Rebalance? Link? Not finding anything.
---
Yes. By playing drums you contribute. Only works for like 2 days than no one does the event anymore.
---
Pipe weapons are supposed to be weak weapons that can be crafted by almost any person. Even if they get a buff, I don‚Äôt think it would be a drastic improvement.
---
I've never seen anyone (over level 30 or so) selling _any_ ammo for more than 1 cap. 
---
10mm? 1 cap.
---
50 cal? 1 cap.
---
Mini nuke? 1 cap.
---
The Whitesprings Flea Market! I love it. Ramshack tables in long rows with junk all over them and different vendors sitting behind them. But they only are allowed to sell junk items and chems.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs about exponential growth and reduction.  Let‚Äôs say a weapon that does 80 damage is nerfed by 10%.  You‚Äôre now hitting for 72.  Hardly noticeable.  The same nerf on a weapon that hits for 400 damage is now doing 360.  The loss is much more significant.  That‚Äôs why lower damage, faster fire rate guns are largely unchanged, but heavy hitting weapons lost a considerable amount of effect.  The multiplicative power of perks, legendary effects and mutations compounded into a much larger damage potential for slow, heavy weapons.
---
exactly, the world needs ditch diggers too!
---
Have you joined the Enclave?
---
They‚Äôre changing damage modifiers to be additive rather than multiplicative. Just means nerfs to bloodied and similar
---
I never said I was smart lol. I can't remember the bait from the quest line but all I hear is people using this explosive bait to grief griefers and envisioned this damaging explosion lmao. I guess I don't fully grasp the bait exploit.
---
Lots of great information presented here and I thank you all!  Lots of stuff for me to rework. Thank you!  I‚Äôve definitely learned that a build is much more important than I believed. Thanks for taking the time to reply!
---
Why don‚Äôt you wait and find out how it works before you make a decision?
---
Both console makers stopped charging fees last gen.....
---
As I expected.  Thanks for the info.
---
Ah that‚Äôs interesting, so if I ignore these when they pop they get removed from the possible dailies the next day? For instance if I ignore someone to talk to, I‚Äôm guaranteed trick or treat the next day?
---
I like the idea. Give everyone their own "Beckett's Bar" stand and have them come up and talk to you or to your ally who is also your vendor I think would be cool too. 
---
Separately...dude...please learn to use the proper "their." It was moderately irritating to see that error more than once..lol
---
This happens fairly often after a bad crash. For some reason the client forgets where the game is. Just direct the install to where you store the game. If you do this correctly the install will start and instantly finish.
---
In what weapon do you use .308?  I used it for ~20 levels in my hunting rifle, but rechambered it for .50.  Now I have thousands of .308 and am dying to find something to do with it.
---
I mean, pacify perks are locked behind level 50 charisma and intelligence. Regarding uniqueness, every camp can already build pretty much anything.
---
I don't think I can test it very well I don't have most power armor types available as I dumped most of my extra sets to lose weight. Also I'm only rank 47ish in NW. Would be best to have someone with all unlocked be able to clear it up. I believe the wiki does provide some info on which paints work on which power armors.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
Nope, if you move your camp the ammo factory gets deleted from the budget entirely, and it doesn't end up in your stored tab like the other resource extractors do.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. This seems so easy in 2020.
---
Very true. There have been reports of some consoles kicking into high gear when entering an instanced location. Some have shut down due to overheating, which is really unusual.
---
no worries. anytime. 
---
its been over 24 hours and its still up so i am assuming this post isn't going anywhere lol.
---
super excited for this show, The Witcher tv series is amazing so here is hoping Fallout gets the same love.
---
I prefer everyone spread out, you might spend 500 caps fast travelling but you'll save thousands buying at better prices. If all the good deals were in one place they'd get snapped up quickly. If the items took up double/triple stash weight that might work to keep people pricing things at a competitive rate.
---
They went down at 10 EST, so they're about 24 minutes in right now.  The patch on steam was a \~28 mb download.
---
&gt;  Is it easier for them to get away with this exploit using workshops,
---
Its just better to use workshops. No one wants that many generators or ammo factories in their camp. They are also annoying to place, the airport and tyler county are pretty flat so it makes it easier. Theres no "getting away" for this, I doubt anyone will be banned for it tbh.
---
No matter how you spin it, no matter the excuse, an **exploit is still an exploit**.
---
Who knows
---
I sincerely hope they take a step back and look at all the angles that the damage calculations have changed.  It‚Äôs kinda terrifying to think that no one would immediately realize that slow, high damage weapons would be disproportionately affected by the new math.
---
Now this man is asking the important questions ü§î
---
If it does, a shredding basher‚Äòs minigun with the PA arm mods and the basher perk might be a very unique build to try out.
---
give it 6 months lol
---
Next stop, buying a PowerBall or Mega Millions ticket.
---
I like to plan things. I'm kinda weird like that.
---
Beth won't and can't ban for this for the exact reason this post is about. I do think this is bad behavior, but this game is never going to function like a real MMO.
---
Just return him his eye !  
---
maybe than...
---
&gt;e crossbow loads so slow you need to be able to one shot in a crowd of super mutants. Anything breaking stealth and you're in trouble. VATS is buggy and often you hit see 800 damage, but no damage inflicted. An immediate one shot after will preserve stealth, if not run a
---
This this this. Dual-wielding would be a fantastic Legendary Perk. Off-hand weapon damage could scale with perk level.
---
I suspect they up deathclaws‚Äô defense. There‚Äôs  a perk under perception to check enemies defense in VATS if you want to do a comparison. That might give more insight on why your damage drop so horrendously.
---
I mean, no? Thats a metric shit ton of bait. Its at a workshop, just contest and destroy it if it bothers you.
---
Hardly an exploit when it's so easy to just blueprint the machine.
---
I'll agree with you on the moral/ethical aspect of exploits.....but beyond the first time I took the Munitions Factory, I have never felt satisfaction from farming ammo components.  It is an annoying grind.
---
I've seen this kind of thing happen at player CAMPs too on PC. Best thing to do is get screenshots of the CAMP itself with the nametag attached to the extractor (usually via the camera and printscreen).
---
Alright, glitching some scrap to build up your house I can understand and not be bothered by, but if what you're doing is affecting server stability you can fuck right off. That asshat has no right to disrupt other's playing experience because they don't want to grind.
---
Counterpoint: Fuck bloodied, and any other blatantly obvious meta. That shit needs to be nerfed into oblivion, with prejudice. There should be no single meta in any game, ever.
---
Thank you.
---
Not a workable idea.
---
They changed it a few weeks back so that all you'd need was the Ghoul sample and something broke it. Been trying it every day.
---
Hi! Sorry you've trouble with completing this quest. We're actively working on a fix for this issue that we had intended to release today, but found that it still needs more work before it's completely resolved. 
---
We're looking to get that fix out to you as soon as we can!
---
it is known
---
after I posted this, I had a look at Angry Turtle's take on the rebalance on youtube, and I was happy as he explained it clearly
---
I‚Äôve never been inside of them. Gave me some to do, thanks
---
they should have a "shared stash" like borderlands has. I think you could only transfer 6 items at a time but its better than what we have now

Scrubs goin‚Äô hate
---
They're purchasable for gold bullion in the PTS.
---
Ward's probably took them. Keep an eye out for any raiders who "stole" them from Ward.
---
Yeah, I'd love to try wearing a mask with it, too. It seems like it would take all of 5 minutes to fix this bug. Just fix it!
---
the whitespring building is woefully unused. i hardly even see people at the vendors any more
---
I think the double dip still where if you put a stock on it it gains from both pistol and rifle perks. I used to use a quad expo 15 reload pipe revolver. It was fun, you have to give up str though and the build looks funky.  But you can get huge numbers as a sneak sniper.   
---
I guess I could hop on my pipe pistoler and see I just haven't played it since I got everything I wanted before wastelanders dropped and choose a new toon to play all the time.
---
Well there has to be some good things going on over on pc lol üëç
---
Please don't give people ideas. The community has enough problems with people taking advantage of exploits as is. (This current one, explosive bait, glitching rep, hacked weapons, Line in the Sand scorched spawns, ect.)
---
Message me if they don't fix it.
---
I plant corn, tato and mutfruit. Cook that with purified water and you get vegetable starch which turns into adhesive. That has helped me a lot.
---
How?
---
Fanks, Nice name for a new character. üòÄ
---
Even if you manage to remove the ammo factory you permanently lose the budget it took up.
---
I didn't count how many good stories there was, but if like you said "5", it is for sure not empty.
---
People complained that F2 was to happy compared to F1. The desolation, hopelessness of all the stories ending in a dead person, reminded me of F1 in that regard.
---
I found a lot of stories told by the game world. Found a church full of skeletons with a drinking glass next to each one, mass suicide? Or the golf cart jousting skeletons. The alien writing on the stones. The Lovecraftian being in the mine. Definitely not empty.
---
I found a bloodied explosive .50 cal with 90% reduced weight at Whitespring station inside a suitcase on a public server, so I took that for myself lol.
---
Hol up...Davin? I've been playing for almost 2 months and only get 1 daily from crater and foundation. Where's this Davin guy I've been missing?
---
O okay
---
This whole thread has given me a lot more to add to my wishlist! There have been a lot more things in the shop than I realized honestly (and I hope it all comes back into rotation for all of everyone here's sake).
---
Why is it that mr. Gutsy hurting so much btw?
---
I don‚Äôt pvp on pc. Again. I don‚Äôt pvp on consoles. Again. My suggestion was a way to make it easier to do and actually work. When one guys does that that‚Äôs on BGS and a fix is needed hopefully with something like one wasteland. Feel how you will but it‚Äôs staying so try to find a work around rather then heading your chest trying to remove stuff you don‚Äôt like. Again don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt do it. Simple.
---
This is specifically the Photograph 76 types one where you photograph normal/glowing/albino/alpha stuff.
---
I did a few quizzes, including the Mammal one which should cover the Yao Guai that's giving me issues.
---
If they're screwing around with additive / multiplicative mechanics...have they done anything with the way DR / ER are calculated so it's not such diminishing returns at higher numbers?
---
Also...the change to weapon damage would seem to really favor Anti-Armor, no?
---
South of Emmet it is a rest stop, I have used it a few times for camps but nothing stuck for long.
---
Ty I'll have a browse and see what I can find. I'm gonna update the wiki once I finish collecting everything.
---
You would be planning on iffy information. I would wait to see how it actually impacts you. Being a rifleman it should be minimal.
---
Its easy to dog-pile someone when there's a portion of the community that's toxic enough to try and push the use of exploits. People will make an excuse for anything.
---
I love it.
---
Dogmeat, where are you?
---
&gt; Either fix him or put a terminal next to him that let's us auto start the damn quest.
---
This is honestly a great idea, but also pretty hilarious. They gave us NPCs but they're so buggy we find ourselves wishing for the simpler days when we could just use a terminal instead.
---
I've always been surprised I haven't heard of more people having issues with Wren. They're always in the right place, but often times for me their eyes are missing. Same happens to Ward. Then I have to server hop and try again.
---
The worst for me is the fact that the amount of xp you need to level up is exponential and thus the people like me who changed their builds in the past won't have as many points as other people. And again, it wouldn't be too bad if leveling was linear but fuck me for not seeing in the future I guess. Most of the time I need to jump on an alt character to do the lvl up daily which was stupid enough. Legendary perks are just in a whole another level of stupidity and complete garbage design.
---
I just ask if anyone out there can modify my armor for me. Some people are surprisingly cheap, as in free.
---
He's the robot in the over seers basement. You can use him to get rep from either foundation or creater
---
I think they should re-work the perk requirements for the modifications of the weapons to better align with player progression.
---
By the time you'd be able to make these weapons useful,  you've already got access to better weapons. If you were able to more flexibly modify these weapons early in the game, I feel that alone would make them substantially more useful than they are currently.
---
It's a handmade improvised weapon. You should be able to do ANYTHING to it, really.
---
That's why you put 40 down in a workshop on a private server. Who puts these at their base? lul.
---
Hopefully.
---
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, you know if this happens on PS4?
---
Yeah, I don't deliberately do it and having a BE gatling plasma can be hard to control and if I do, I tend to gun bash them, I never intentionally kill it but having a very powerful weapon in a crowd control event is good but deliberately killing the legendaries is very scummy
---
You *HERETIC*
---
No green stuff here.
---
nice
---
I want a straight answer, not a highly opinionated asshole, thanks.
---
Nothing to do with branching out.
---
The game is being rebalanced around top damage builds so everyone gets their damage reduced.
---
At the same time enemies scale up to level 100.
---
So we all do less damage and every enemy has more hp.......
---
I'm a big shotgun fan, any news on them from the pts? Also they should finally fix tesla shotgun and others that count as rifle even though you transformed them into a shotgun
---
I should have. The luck has already left.
---
Can you, possibly, depends on if they decide to go after the people who are doing the exploit to get the ammo factory or not.  It‚Äôs clearly an exploit since you can‚Äôt acquire it any other way.  
---
If they do, no amount of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚Äúother people do worse things‚Äù will be an excuse, it‚Äôs a violation of the TOS
---
Making a blueprint of them is a glitch/exploit and should at least not work. So you can get banned for it and be sure a lot of people will report you when you have them in your camp.
---
Im excited by the opportunity for more XP. Just want them to figure the formula out before release. Then we'll all adjust to the new balance and move on.  
---
Now they just need to figure out hunters, exterminators, nocturnal, etc to make that stuff not trash.
---
I think it all comes down to personal preference/playstyle at the end of the day. I used deep-pocketed frequently in my early levels but I've since mostly made the switch to ultra-light because I don't really need to lug a ton of stuff around anymore.
---
Light Machine Guns. The best heavy gun IMO
---
Then you don't know how bad it is. Pvp is really bad. I pvp in other games I used to pvp religiously in world of warcraft. Multiple glads and a proud high warlord. But I don't pvp in this game cause it's way too distorted and there's no fixing it in the foreseeable future. I suggest you try pvping in pc and understand why I'm so against bringing pvp to this game. You should pvp in pc. It's a unique experience and you might just quit the game unless you are the one that's hacking yourself. Your expectation is way too high.
---
Yeah your wrong though. But I hope you get banned for it.
---
I can't be the only fool running around Appalachia wearing a chef's hat and lab coat and eating people after clobbering them with a rolling pin. I'm waiting for a good legendary drill to drop because I have plans for that too.
---
Thanks for the workaround.   As my friend and I like to build stuff in each others camps. But strange the UI doesn't even hint at this without reading a random ITV post.
---
Then why are you asking us assholes on a non Bethesda Reddit sub?
---
It's their end all argument. If you argue against it you're not being objective. It's a cop-out. I've told people, so you don't think games are art. So they will say of course it's art. Well art isn't objective.
---
I didn‚Äôt try shotguns at all, but I haven‚Äôt heard any mention of them on the PTS.  I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre performing the same, but I can‚Äôt say for sure.
---
They should just kill the stealth gameplay all together and redoo it imo. Awefull gameplay, sit shoot sit shoot sit shoot.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs an exploit.
---
Yes most likely. This is an exploit, which is something Bethesda hasn‚Äôt been known for taking lightly. I‚Äôd be super careful and at least keep this in mind if you do decide to use the exploit.
---
I have a simple theory I doubt they will ban but with patch 22 I would bet a forced camp move thus removing them and fixing the glitch to BP closing it off for good.  The joke will be they will force the people to never have full camp budget until a more solid player found solution is found that may or may not work depending on your system and well seems like luck.
---
They need to stop especially when theirs a little sign that says homer, poor homerü•∫
---
I enjoyed the low level areas because I can rock pistols without any perks and have fun with them. Or I test out new normally unviable guns. Like running around with a bloodied explosive Tommy gun that has a five foot range. No fun in West teck but great at Grafton steel.
---
can?  Yes.  will?  If you have a clean account I‚Äôd wager no, but you never know with Bethesda.
---
Well notice we aren't really... rebuilding anything. We aren't like the settlers or people of Fountain. We arnt spending all day making farms, or cities or anything like that.
---
Vault 76 was a vault full of Mercenaries at best to raiders and warlords at worst.
---
I'm about to hit level 300 and I'm still unlocking new cards and trying new things that make my build a little better.  There are a ton of viable card combinations.  If anything I would say you would have to go way out of your way to not take a single card related to combat in order to make a truly terrible build.  
---
Don't sweat it, you are most likely completely fine.  If you have ANY sort of idea what you want for a build you are already doing better than I was at level 21 lol.
---
How did it go?
---
I was asking hoping I wouldn‚Äôt get disdainful ChEaTeRs ArE sCuM I hOpE yOu GeT bAnNeD fOr ThInkInG aBoUt It
---
No, all I wanted was a simple yes or no answer,
---

---
Excuses excuses. You try to justify the use of the ammo factories by saying you give the ammo to new players. I tried that with the Large Handmade gifts myself when someone gave me several hundred... I wanted to give them to new players. Instead I got rid of them, they were given to me by dubious circumstances that were clear they were duped.
---
If you want an actual ammo machine that produces ammo for free, get the one from the Raider Reputation (which actually requires some effort to get) or take over the Ammo Factory yourself and have it produce ammo.
---
But I do want to say this: Helping out the new players is a good thing to do, but please don't give them resources and items obtained by illegitimate means.
---
Fuck that Caravan was dope lol
---
Full auto n 10mm also has 75 fire rate and hits for SLIGHTLY less damage than the semi auto 10mm with almost no vats cost.
---
Have you tried a 50 crit pistol with better criticals and eagle eyes? I bet its 2 normal hits and one crit  to kill the super muties with it on the PTS , which is exactly the same amount of shots they take in the live version. Also are you using fallow through?
---
Explosive effect doesnt do very much on the 10mm. I prefer j5025 over any, although the j2525 does well.
---
Revolvers on the other hand sound like they are taking a good hit in the PTS even with tank killer.
---
How is it not great? Wastelanders is how the game should have been released IMO.
---
Same here. I read this and I was like ‚Äúthe what?‚Äù
---
I knew the domes were there, I didn‚Äôt know they were accessible
---
Yep.  Hunting down rad ants was always so much fun for me.  :)
---
28.2 mb on steam
---
It's obviously an exploit that breaks the TOS you signed to play the game. The answer is yes, you can be banned if and when Bethesda decides to do it. No one knows if / when that will be and you will get no notice ahead of time.
---
Wait, wait, wait.
---
After update it also could remove entire game and you will have to re-download everything.
---
Very well. Thank you for your answer. I won‚Äôt build any ammo factories.
---
They haven‚Äôt said anything about meat week yet. I think as of now it‚Äôs safe to assume meat week will stay moved to Thursday as planned
---
And the player is proberly selling it all for overprice
---
Me, cause I only want it for 1 type of ammo and just enough for myself
---
That's alot of text stating nothing new.
---
The same sentiment gets posted every week or so and has happened since launch.
---
That silent majority, most likely on consoles, will keep this game chugging forward
---
Ultra-light for VATS.
---
Deep Pocketed for hip fire.
---
Can‚Äôt get banned but build them at workshops instead of your camp (on a private server if possible). You get resources to use at workshops so you‚Äôre not wasting all your own junk on the fusion generators, plus no impact on your budget.
---
oh sure for the ethics on the matter you saying, yeah it's not exactly a game of happy village animals crossing a river or some shit like that, it's like how the real world works and i do tend to take advantage of it as long as it's possible...
---
They did let a load of dupers go with all their stock and permanently ban others, but I‚Äôd rather keep my nose clean. Never know what kind of shenanigans they‚Äôll pull on ya.
---
Got a junkie's fire rate LMG. Amazing damage, also triggers the damage overflow bug but I got the weapon before that was discovered so there's not much I can do about that until bethesda fixes it. You can eat through a thousand rounds in a minute or two of fighting. I had to change my hunting rifle to .50 cal so that I had ammo for it
---
What do y'all play on? I'd be willing to help y'all along if you want
---
Thank you! I didn't know he gave rep. I hope he's not still pissed about me selling the pictures he asked me to take.
---
You get 18 perk coins every 10 levels.  You can very easily get 10 levels in 2-3 hours of gameplay.
---
Sure it takes time, but the whole point of the legendary perk system is that it is a reward for players who play more.  Your suggestion defeats the whole point of the system.
---
Oh hell yeah. Will you? Maybe, their enforcement is pretty lax.
---
Fair enough, thank you for your response.
---
If those are the only 2 in that region, you are guaranteed that if that region would have a daily it would be trick or treat, yes
---
I cannot make it any clearer that any type of exploit is looked down upon greatly and can / will get you in trouble. If you do this at your CAMP, I will gather evidence of it and report it.
---
**Do not justify an exploit with excuses.**
---
Well he doesn't himself. You have to turn the photos in to the opposite faction that you took the photo of
---
Same on the Beth Launcher
---
Straight answer, no. Don‚Äôt listen to the white knights
---
I'll try not to hold my breath. Counting on Bethesda, there's quite a difference between what they say they've done (or gonna) and what actually happens.
---
Not to high for wanting it to work. I pvp in war and other game but it‚Äôs not my main thing. Again just like you want it gone I want it better. And it‚Äôs not going anywhere anytime soon. Might as well reload that and stop trying to shit on people who want this to work. This isn‚Äôt your game and we are just populating it for you. With that in mind speaking in absolutes only shows that you had you feels so the talking and refuse to budge. I won‚Äôt either so you can keep this up but all your doing is wasting your time. 76 pvp stays that‚Äôs just a fact.
---
That was pre 2013
---
If your on PS4 in have like 10 soso 3* fixers you are welcome to pick one for free. There not amazing but better than non legendary.
---
I just use super duper and alternate through weapons.
---
Yes it is stupid
---
*cough cough*
---
Hundreds of dupers let go
---
Last time I couldn't even get the patch to download properly, it was faster to delete and reinstall the game.
---
This comment made my butthole quiver
---
If there are legendary drills, pretty sure they are legacies, good luck finding one!
---
Do it. I dare you.
---
Something wrong with Ol‚Äô Ward, he ain‚Äôt quite right.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd be intensely wary of anything they didn‚Äôt give a concrete date for. Obviously, the dates will slip, but you still know it‚Äôs actually being worked on. I got the sense a fair portion of the stuff they mentioned at Quakecon was still just being discussed in house.
---
No kidding - nothing disappointed me more than the lies in the Patch 21 notes about SS Deep Pocketed mods...just because it was such a simple thing &amp; they still screwed it up.
---
Tbh do they need a buff? They already can use the rifleman and the pistol perks.
---
Combine this with bloodied,unyealding, explosive,adrenaline and adrenal reaction and it can push out some serious damage per shot
---
Not to mention if you use ballistic boc or damage increasing chems.
---
Edit: I use a bloodied pipe revolver and it can do about 500-600 dmg,  double if it's a stealth shot AND I havnt fully done pistol perks
---
Three to four conversations going on.. everyone talking over everyone...
---
I like ultra light since I use PA. Pocketed doesn‚Äôt do anything when your in PA.
---
Haven‚Äôt sniped on this game yet but I‚Äôd use the perk to relocate and get hidden for the stealth multiplier? Or is this a common method already?
---
The PR nightmare wouldn't be worth it for them.
---
Tbh, I‚Äôd pay for that. I‚Äôd prefer them to create a mission around it and they sell skins in the shop like with backpacks, but I‚Äôd drop the atoms for the function itself if I had to
---
Even at lvl 30 that thing should rock pretty hard. I‚Äòd try to see it this way: there are countless max level glamers with subpar effects being used. This thing‚Äôs lvl is basically what the bashing damage would‚Äôve been on a max lvl one. The ‚Äúunlucky roll‚Äù on it so to speak. But the rest sounds so good that it more than makes up for it. The only problem I would see is the reduced durability compared to a max lvl one.
---
To answer your question, good rolls do have a market if you don‚Äôt charge ludicrous prices. Remember, the thing might be a god roll, but there‚Äôs that bash damaga equivalent dangling on it, too.
---
As for the other stuff, I‚Äôm not much of a farmer so I‚Äôm always looking for cheap scrip üëÄ
---
While you‚Äôre at it, report my dodgy wires. BlackClock69#660.
---
Is ultra light a good match with weapons weight reduction? I have 4 wwr pieces and I currently use the perk that makes armor weigh 50% but my weight is in the lower 230s. Would ultra light give me more ap and reduce my armors weight even more? An does it stack with the perk card?
---
I don't know about a generic buff, but giving them higher powered mod options seems like a good idea.
---
I had this happen yesterday. I had to leave the server and come back in.
---
Ahh, remember the constant machine gunning from the Sentury botts that went on for what like 3 months? Bethesda's soul goal is to torture the people that play this game.
---
**You are taking a risk of being banned for doing this. It is an exploit.**
---
If you want to take that risk, then so be it.
---
Maybe guild stores. That would be more plausible I think.
---
It is in testing don't make choices today made on things that may never happen.
---
Don't shoot at point-blank range.
---
So basically we're going to be seeing more people with gatling plasmas to make up for it... a blanket nerf will only bring out the very best weapons. 
---
My gauss minigun costs about 5000 caps per minute in ammo. Only thing that made it worthwhile was its damage... and I didn't have to use a gatling plasma. Why not just nerf the explosive affix? That would calm the insane damage builds down a bit. Shits still going to get killed in &lt;1 second. 2 tops. Not sure why I'm seeing people say they're actually going to get a chance at looting legendaries. That's not going to change.
---
I stopped caring about weight in PA a long time ago, sadly. 
---
Currently running around 600 pounds, and with all the legendary effects and such it's down to about 330. So whenever I enter PA I am instantly overburdened, which makes no sense. I would really love to see them buffing PA weight stats. 
---
Getting calibrated shocks for me is like putting a carbon fibre spoiler on a pony. A very beefy steel plated pony.
---
I didn't do it myself, I literally just saw a YouTube video of a guy going into build mode and blueprinting it. I'm not "wrong" nor have I done anything wrong.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for easy tasty squirrel stew.
---
*Sticks silencer on the War Drum.*
---
The fix might be complicated, but there's an easy goodwill fix they could apply. They really could just grant everyone success for that part of the challenge via a database edit, and also set it so that all future players just automatically get credit for killing the SBQ, even if they didn't. I don't totally know their tech stack, but unless they built out an insane system, this shouldn't be more than a day of work for someone.
---
Then if they ever get around to fixing the bug, they could undo that band-aid and return to the normally intended functionality.
---
I see your on Xbox... would you like to make a deal stranger?
---
McDonald's does not have a "meatless" burger. Anywhere.
---
Never never ever count on Bethesda to 100% do something good. They can ban players real fast, they can stop smiley from selling extra gold, and making hot fix's to some quirks in the game. Just can't fix anything else.
---
Nah I've seen enough bad wiring to scar an electrician for life. All I care about is preventing people like you from getting banned for taking advantage of an exploit. But if you wanna do it, I can't exactly stop you. Good luck.
---
 So run 40 on a private at a workshop for a night and be done with it for a while. More than you need. Your method is like robbing gas stations for a year everyday trying to make rent and bills. Mine is one day, one heist, one risk.
---
I think it‚Äôd be cool if there were settlements like in fallout 4 that multiple people could build on.
---
Yep time to have actual fights
---
Yep just make tire irons and pipe pistol the new meta lol
---
Well the numbers above show even non optimized builds are hit hard too. And you have to take into account that builds with a lower DPS now have to go up against scaled enemies.
---
For all the hype leading up to the release of Wastelanders I also thought the content would be a little meatier. Or even more consequential considering no one seems that bothered when my raider strolls into Foundation to dump treasury notes.
---
Oh agreed. But the game play loop of 76 makes you pretty much a merc at best
---
Bahahahahahahaha!
---
Silenced Fatman \*evil grin\*
---
Jesus. I already feel like my weapons are hitting like wet toilet paper.
---
It's not rebalancing.  Its an across the board nerf.
---
Bloodied/junkies will still be the best.  Build variety won't change.  We'll use the same weapons/perks as before.
---
Nothing is being brought up to be on par with anything else aka balanced.
---
Wrong. This is an exploit and under Bethesda's terms and conditions.. This would fall under that category.
---
For someone in the Brotherhood I expected better. Now I'm disappointed...
---
Welcome to Fallout 76!
---
Please do so. Myself and others have kept our eyes out for CAMPs with this machine and usually gather evidence to send a large report to Bethesda.
---
**Get. Rid. Of. It.**
---
Except for the revolvers 'cause...well, you physically can't silence a revolver.
---
I was able to load it up after the update so hopefully that won't happen.  I did have to disable to Bethesda logo movie again but otherwise smooth.
---
Most likely, realistically? No. You're not going to get banned. There's a weird culture against exploiting on this subreddit-- The same community that vilifies you mostly, for expressing discontempt with the developers. The game has a dozen thousand issues. You cutting corners just a -little- bit to enjoy it a -little- more doesn't make it a problem. 
---
ill probably get downvoted for saying some exploits are cool. look, this doesn't hurt anyone. this isn't game-breaking. it isn't one-hitting the queen. it's just giving you ammo so you can handle the bulletsponge that is fallout 76 with a little more tolerance. and even more realistically for the majority of the playerbase, after the next patch-- the game's going to become even more so.
---
Ahah I died at number 6'
---
I'll get my silenced Guitar Sword and we can have a \*very quiet\* jam session on some Mole Miners.
---
also this may be of some help [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
Uff da...
---
And have a metric ton filling up my stash nah thanks I have it all boxed in a room and only access it now and again
---
That‚Äôs my play style anyway so I honestly don‚Äôt mind
---
1c ammo; 10c plans
---
I saw a camp where they built large concrete walls around them.   It was an attempt to hide them since they were all locked anyway.  Maybe next time they should try building something with a roof.
---
I wouldn't necessary say "better game". I consider this a "more equal playing field". It's undeniable that the median damage went down a bit. Bethesda should up the overall damage a bit to bring the median builds to the pre-nerf power. That way a normal build would stay roughly the same strong, but bloodied will remain significantly nerfed.
---
Haha! When the game first came out, there was quite a buzz over these to get the Nuka Cola power armor! Kind of sad that they haven't added to this to keep hidden mysterious going
---
Ward is a man descending in to madness. Between talking to himself before you enter. The long pauses dialog where his mind wanders. The threats. He's clearly struggling, with the realm of his own mind. Thousands of NPCs have died at his hands, while he's been selling the items to the Raiders and Blood Eagles only to have you murder them.
---
He's infiltrating the Brotherhood of Steel as I type this. Why do you think the same few NPCs have been banging on that handrail and post for so long? They're out of concrete and plastic. I've even heard a few times their tools have been stolen. Warlord Ward is on the rise.
---
I have to add the food reduction perk (I use the grocer mod) when I go into PA.
---
I would only support console -&gt; PC transfers. I play on console specifically to avoid hackers and the myriad of other problems PC players have to put up with.
---
A fully automatic 10mm pistol does 93 damage (I don't remember exactly, I'll come back later) per shot. Handmade does 176 damage per shot. Excellent balance, I don‚Äôt argue!
---
Revolvers has no silencer = useless
---
You're welcome. I'll get back to you.
---
The thing is, pvp is main thing for me. And I quit pvp while playing fallout 76. That tells something. Look, I think we have this disagreement cause you never pvped and I pvped a lot in this game. There's this gap that we cannot close. PVP in this game is nothing like any you would see in other games. Just keep that in mind
---
Not really sure how using gear and perks for the purpose intended is exploiting.
---
Yeah sure 10 levels....do you know why people abused xp glitches? It's cause it takes hours to get a single level when you're in the 300s and even longer in the 400s an 500s.
---
Confirmed added to the list.
---
I‚Äôm always selling all spare ammo I got at 1c each.
---
I think I'm gonna do the side quest (I'm a lore junkie lol) but hey, I really appreciate your offer!! :) thanks (insert love heart emote here)
---
Yup, Power User 3 + Batteries Included 3 = fun with Gatling Laser. Have about 60 cores, so about 18 pounds for 50k ammo (not all cores are full).
---
Now, if they'd fix the "reloading before empty" bug on fusion cores, that would be nice.
---
I was refering to 10mm semi vs 10mm auto, clearly said that in the first sentence. 
---
Theres is no comparison to rifles. Pistols do like 1/2 to 2/3 the damage i mentioned the auto pistol because you said it 10mm had a much slower fire rate than assault rifles, but when comparing auto 10mm to the auto assault rifle they have the same fire rate.
---
I went into crits trying to get the point across if you spec for crits you can most likely acheive a 3 shot kill rather than a 4-5 with the 10mm. With 15 luck and crit savy you get a crit proc after 2 hits. So you can land 2 normal hits than a crit per mutant to drop them rather than just shooting them with 5 noraml hits.
---
Also you didnt confirm, are you using fallow through and covert operative? I dknt have PTS and was wondering how well fallow through works
---
I can count on one hand the number of vendors I've seen with Flux since Fasnacht.  But a nuked Morgantown netted me only about six HRF.  Just stupid rare for something that people need multiple of.
---
Well sure but I don't think anyone's gonna give me too much crap for doing the enchanting exploit in Skyrim. An exploiter isn't deplorable unless they use exploits in a co-op pve or a pvp environment. I've only ever played 76 in my own private world.
---
Imagine giving a fuck that people have more ammo than normal lol
---
I focus on sell scrip pieces mostly.  I price them at 11 to 12 caps per scrip to help people who don't have time to farm Legendaries
---
&gt;This is the same team that can‚Äôt manage shared account storage or a basic text chat.
---
Where do you have the information that they can't? Or are you just talking nonsense? So far nothing suggest that they cannot do that. It seems more that they don't want to do that. That the higher-ups put the priority on other features.
---
But my wires went through walls, ceilings, are about 40ft too long and that‚Äôs all thanks to a certain building exploit. Putting down a conduit on a mat and moving it around. Sound familiar?
---
Except that even in a workshop, enough of these machines can cause server stability issues.
---
Also my question to you is this: Why are you suggesting that players use workshops to use this exploit? Are you also using this exploit?
---
People were complaining that they were bored with The End Game and wanted stronger enemies to make the game more exciting. So Bethesda does what they do best and went to the extremes with Harder Monsters for everyone and a huge W**eapons Nerf** for everyone! When asking Bethesda for anything we have to be **Extremely Specific** like talking to a young child. People weren't specific enough about what they wanted so here we are!
---
Most game companies consider players with less than 2 hours of gameplay a day normal gamers. Well lets call it casual. Whatever. 150 scrips don't look too small if you consider that
---
I think, at one point, ultracite was intended to be end-game level PA. There‚Äôs too much stuff that doesn‚Äôt make sense otherwise. You can only get plans for it from the queen, and it‚Äôs a pain to craft and repair due to needing ultracite. I reckon they never planned for a full set of ultracite armor to be a reward for one of the late quests, and that you were supposed to keep going at the queen to get the plans to build your own, but they realised they had no other big reward and just stuck it in there.
---
Came across the same except maybe 5-6 floating.
---
Who the fuck are these people one-shotting everything?? I'm level 153 on xbox, a shotgun build with a quad ammo double barrel and it still takes me 4-5 shots to kill basic ghouls. I'm honestly terrified of the One Wasteland update and i'm worried it's what will eventually get me to quit playing.
---
Ok. But people are somehow glitching it into other workshops? I've never seen it as an option in the build menu even at the munitions factory - it's always just already there inside the building. I guess glitchers/exploiters are always going to figure out a way, huh? Smh. 
---
Thanks for the response.
---
There is a side quest for it?
---
I make disease Cure which always sells.
---
Treasure maps, magazines, bobble heads.
---
Making Nuka Cola vaccinated, it sells.
---
Plans rarely sell unless they are rare.
---
Maybe they should've buffed other builds?
---
I'm wondering about what I hear with the special door that is coming down that was mentioned that once attached to your camp will allow for an internal space where you can build to your heart's content. I think this might be beneficial for the mailbox option if they are programming it to be, say saved on your local drive where you could then have unlimited space and possibly a mailbox for other characters on your account that has an interior area as well with the mailbox. This could change a great deal with the stashbox and other aspects but I actually sort of gave up on my second character that I created because I was getting annoyed not being able to give them items my primary had for them.
---
Had you claimed any of the prizes? Do you have them in your game?
---
All of these posts are the same. "my friend and/or a random private teammate built it without telling me" like you didn't ask for it then have regrets due to poor placement or inability to craft your desired ammo or now you're just scared you'll get banned and come here crying for help.
---
Yeah it's like that 90% of the camps I go to but they either don't sell shotguns shells or sell them at 2 caps each now and again I'll find a camp that's sells them at 1 cap but it only ever a couple of hundred and unfortunately they don't last that long, so I have a choice have the ammo maker or spend my gaming time camp and server Hoping it's a no brainer
---
Dang me 20c plans are over priced? :-)
---
If you want a guaranteed 3* your best off saving up your scrip and going to see mumbles, you'll still get gyped but it will be a 3* gyping. I can't see them changing the drops and if they do they'll probably make it worse.
---
Where is this "nerf" mentioned? Is it just an extrapolation of the "One Wasteland" part of the patch?
---
Your word cannot be taken for granted. People have tried to justify this **exploit** for whatever excuse they can pull up. I suggest you stop talking and if you are indeed using something like this, I also suggest you stop. If not, then we have no problems.
---
Just because its 'easy' doesn't make it right.
---
At this point I fully expect patches to be a failure. Patch 21 was one of the worst and you'd think it can only go up from there but the QuakeCon interview or whatever that was, the one where they stockpiled excuses, isn't giving me a lot of hope.
---
Covid is to blame.
---
Giant patch size is to blame.
---
Working from home is to blame.
---
Everything is to blame but certainly not the design choices made by the team and the project lead. Nor the lack of actual testing as the PTS feedback gets ignored most of the time.
---
Finally someone with the the guts help
---
Exactly. I think you can tell a technical adult from a real one by whether they say that without irony.
---
&gt;cheating 
---
Lol its a little bit of extra ammo who gives a fuck. Sad
---
Hi, sorry to hear you've run into trouble with this quest. We are actively working on a fix, and had intended it to be included in today's hotfix. Unfortunately we found that fix did not fully address the issue, so we're still hammering on it.
---
We still want to get this addressed ASAP, so we'll release the fix as soon as it completely resolves the issue.
---
Personally I think ultra-light is overall better because while it is true that you get a higher overall weight limit with deep-pocketed, that extra is worth absolute nothing when you step into power armor or the Chinese/rad suit since not only you no longer have that extra weight, but you also have to still carry around the pieces of armor, and that's when ultra-light really shines. Of course it depends if your armor has a low or high weight to start with, but that's at least my reasoning behind it, specially in rad zones where I can't really wear my normal armor and thus have to carry it around - sure you can drop it off in the stash and pick it up later but I can't be bothered. At the end of the day though, I would say personal preference.
---
You make assumptions with no evidence or facts. You being a pvper in this game and quit due to it, then wanting to remove it does tell me something. That it left you bitter and unwilling to help the problem. It‚Äôs like getting mad and throwing your burger all because your tomatoes fell out. You are not some pvp god on this hill no one can climb no gap due to you know nothing of my gaming history. Been gaming 30+ years so the only gap I see is an old mans way of saying if it‚Äôs broken fix it don‚Äôt just chuck it.
---
Tell me about it... nothing more frustrating than killing SBQ and getting a fucking 1* Nocturnal pipe!!! If 3* enemies drop 1* weapons, then 1* enemies should drop 3* weapons.

 &gt; Hi, sorry to hear you've run into trouble with this quest. We are actively working on a fix, and had intended it to be included in today's hotfix. Unf...
---
In theory - yes.
---
Best case: They will remove all the ammo blueprints from every player and restore camp budget(if it was built in the camp), with no penalties.
---
Worst case: They will suspend for investigation (and then ban/un-ban, it depends) every account that has been reported for this stuff and/or they had found the blueprint.
---
Most realistic case: They will do nothing. If it was built in the camp - say bye to your budget.
---
That's the whole point. Bottom tier trash made weapons. If Bethesda stuck with the fallout weapon tiers, energy weapons would be the best in every department and heavy explosives would be the ultimate solution for big boss type enemies like the mirv fat man.
---
Some of us can go days without seeing any legendaries at WS at all
---
What the hell is "one-wasteland"
---
Gonna make bad life decisions gonna pay the price.
---
Fair enough.
---
You consider it only a balance when it upward dps? It can go upward or downwards overall what more sustainable is an overal balance dps outcome and prediction which is why it downwards 
---
But Bethesda fucked up doing the changes without explaining them to the playerbase and the reason behind it.. this is why they getting shit while zenimax/SE/blizzard get praises because they inform the community when doing changes this dramatically
---
You‚Äôre very misinformed.  I am level 750 and it‚Äôs never been easier to level.  I tend to shoot for 5 levels an hour.  If I could play more than an hour or two a day I‚Äôd be a much higher level.
---
I‚Äôve never used any glitches to level up.  Back when I was in the level 100s you would see people level 900-2,000, those people have mostly moved on or been banned.
---
Brotherhood acquires ALL technology.
---
I can actually can actually see something like that happening, though I doubt they will force a CAMP move.
---
This seems strange to me... you dont have many damage boosts go stack. I dont know why your build got nerfed so badly. According to your numbers you took a 50% nerf aprox. But my semi-optimized bloodied build took a 42% nerf and my furious build just a 21% nerf.
---
I am thinking there is something else here happening.
---
Is it back up? On bethesda.net it says the servers still down
---
yeah i did see how all the dupers accounts got released after a few days
---
The VATS accuracy can be awesome but the reload glitch of having to bash or holster to reload or even heal or sprint is pretty awful. Plus as a Berserker build I‚Äôve probably killed myself more with this gun than by anything else
---
How you "just" did this with the servers offline for maintenance?
---
The day they buff rolling pins! Everything not-meta should get a buff so everything has some use
---
Teammates can build in your camp? Looks like I'm going back to lone wanderer.
---
I don't have Brahmin, but I figure by that point, you've spent enough time playing the game, you know there are Brahmin in Flatwoods you can go get. That area is part of the first few chain of quests you get right out of the vault.
---
I just started playing last week. Found out today players have Brahmin. If I were looking for easy kills for food, Flatwoods is where I'd go. Granted, it hasn't occurred to me to kill cows for food. I've been going after areas with Mirelurks, radscorpions, bugs, etc. (with the right equipment, level 10 character can take down a series of level 5 mirelurks).
---
Admittedly, I am this game's target audience. While I am an adult with a full time job, I don't have much of a life, and I am not currently playing any other games outside of this one.
---
It's an exploit. It doesn't matter how easy or not it is, it's still an exploit. If you haven't done it, then you're fine. But you know, people that look up information about exploits, and then claim, oh they aren't a big deal because they are so easy to do.
---
Are not trustworthy.
---
I like this. Maybe have a 5 item limit per player? Honestly would be sick. I also wish they would allow in game chat (typing for PC) or something so that we can ask fellow players if they have something in particular for sale... I've been searching for weeks for a fixer :(
---
I‚Äôd like to know how many it takes to cause server issues. Most I‚Äôve had was 110 in total over 3 workshops, it caused zero issues to me or friends also on the server. Not even a little slowdown. No one got disconnected. It was fine. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve used it and will continue to use it if I need it again, until it‚Äôs patched out. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to be bethesda top priority
---
Not public teams tho
---
Ik it's annoying having to transfer items to a new character
---
My money's on user error.
---
Ammo you use on enemy now is dropped by that enemy btw
---
When Beckett sells something to another player, do you get the caps for it?
---
thanks this guide is the kind of advice i need around now. fyi the biv quests you don't have to make the drinks like if it says drink fresh wine you can just drink any old wine sitting around
---
You are my favourite kind of vendor
---
Tf is the point of doing this?
---
PC offline only
---
I understand, but i'm telling the truth. The ammo factory does my favorite ammo type and it was indeed badly placed, but yeah, my friend did that
---
I tend to have one premium machine, one with ammo and serums, one with outfits, and one full of scrip. I don‚Äôt bother with plans as they are a dime a dozen.
---
I know!  I always keep 50 rounds on me, and pick up another 100+ during the event.  I love it!
---
I have a drug den.  I don‚Äôt even care if people buy things, it‚Äôs just a raider themed chem camp.
---
Oh ok
---
We intended for a fix to go out during the hotfix today, but they found an issue with it and needed to pull it. We hope to get this fix out to you all as soon as we can!
---
I have a Bloodied Explosive pipe rifle on my stealth commando build... It's a good weapon. Not far behind my other bloodied rifles.
---
I assume your high Intelligence and unyielding?
---
If two weapons with completely different fire rates both recieve a 10% nerf to their damage per shot, their damage per second is also reduced by 10% even though they have completely different fire rates.
---
Good one ü§£
---
For real, I'd rather they just add new weapons to keep the loot pool interesting. Nobody wants to use pipes the whole game.
---
u/ladydevann
---
This is an extremely frustrating problem with the gauss weapons. Can you please look into this issue.
---
Yes Hope my bloodi unarmed build still works good enough of Not i proably will quote until fixes or next big dlc
---
Nerfing solo players is stupid as fuck.
---
Think 1 star should drop 1 star, 2 star can drop 1 or 2 star and 3 star can drop 2 or 3 star items least that would be a little more for fair.
---
You mean there‚Äôs people complaining about xp and not even using the best build to get xp?
---
FO4 spoiled me when it comes to building. I've put up a basic camp in 76, but just doing that little bit has discouraged me from trying to do even a fraction of what I was able to do in 4.
---
Maybe once I get to end game, I'll put a little time into trying to build something nice, but unless they change some stuff to make it easier I don't expect to be able to satisfy my desire to make a camp worthy of my building abilities.
---
&gt;I personally got to point where nothing was a danger to me in the wasteland apart from a Mister Gusty
---
What about an assaultron? That laser beam fucks me up every time.
---
Both Ultracite armor and weapons seem to suggest the devs thought both would be sought after more like you state.  Problem is armors and weapons that also exist from the start (BETA) and after all the DLCs do as much or better, in most cases.  I really want to finish a set of SH PA and use the Ultracite Prototype paint on it.  The paint is really unique and has a BOS emblem on it too.  Most people miss that fact.
---
Well, lots of people use the combat rifle because it runs .45. It‚Äôs not irrelevant.
---
But as to handmade vs assault I guess I can conclude that handmade is superior.
---
That may be the case, so let‚Äôs use the delays to Colossal Problem as an example.  Or the six month delay for Wastelanders.  Or that half the Legendary Run items are poorly designed and buggy.  I enjoy the game, but consistency, quality and attention to detail are not traits I‚Äôd ascribe to BGS Austin.
---
Look up a bloodied build and just follow that. Junkies is pretty much a less good bloodied but with some health flexibility when you need a greater buffer to tank damage.
---
Will be active on PC once the maintenance finishes. Console will be getting it later in the week.
---
No, no word. At this point, I doubt even the devs know what they‚Äôll be used for. Same with the white springs cabins. They‚Äôre just flexible placeholders for possible content.
---
Pc today, console later this week
---
A lot of us have been waiting almost a year for Meat Week. Bethesda better not mess around with that.
---
They have already nurfed explosive- but in doing so they also turned bad weapons worse: fatman, missile launchers. Rebalance is needed and it's not supposed to be a simple blinket fix, but I guess thats what bethesda is gonna try and do
---
You obviously use food and bobble heads, lunch boxes and groups and perk cards with unyielding an 15 base Intelligence. I don't have full set of ss unyielding and play solo 90% of the time and don't bother to use chems or food buffs and don't have a infinite stack of leaders bobble heads from dupping them.  A single lv 68 super mutant give like 212 xp at Wes tek.
---
I did and honestly since its 308 I don't care tho I already just burnt through all 4000 rounds but I don't care cause mg42 go brrrrrrrrr
---
30 years of gaming experience don't matter. Pvp in this game is nothing you've experienced. It's that bad.
---
or swap the "faster reload" perk for your weapon in and out or vice versa.
---
Thanks to everyone else dropping them immediately! ;p
---
Wait they removed laser muskets? why?
---
ultra light, i often Jump in/out of power armour so weightless armour with ultra light can end up with a carry weight of 0 which is really convenient when overall carry weight jumps up and down a lot
---
If you're options are user error and Bethesda, always bet Bethesda :)
---
Yeah know that, but not got a few in the deck.
---
Card packs are usually duplicates.
---
the camden park dailys build up too, if you don't do one, the next day it will still be there plus a new one. i wait and just do all three at a time.
---
You don‚Äôt
---
I‚Äôve been around a fair bit I‚Äôd say, closing in on 1700 hours. All I was saying is it‚Äôs not a bad idea to report these things to the community managers as they are issues that can be solved via a bullet point in a memo vs something that requires extensive effort
---
People dont want to be pigeon holed into a meta build. Full hp builds get 30% less xp, but some people enjoy those and play them. Basically this perk coin system is for one subset of players and even then it's a large grind
---
The Free States are kinda involved in a little war.
---
I know! Whenever I bring back his junk he says
---
"I see you have our missing pro... the quicker you recover our property the better"
---
And then even if I choose my dialog option to finish the quest it wint let me. I have to finish the conversation and try again.
---
I almost just died sipping my coffee when reading that.. soooo close enough guess.
---
If you afk this event, just hop on a set of drums. This actually helps contribute something to the event. Its very helpful.
---
I must have not selected some I think, as I was a rifle / shotgun build mainly.  Only just decided to have a change of pace.
---
it does use some form of budget as when i tried to place mine down, it had me delete about 25% only to use about 10%
---
This. Always do this. Knock them out in less than 10 minutes
---
it happens when you enter power amor because your characters speed gets set to a new (lower) value, somewhere between 80-90%. You can fix it by swaping the "faster reload" perk for your weapon in and out or vice versa
---
also this one isnt new, has been around for quite a while
---
Serious question -  what's this?
---
Then let‚Äôs make it better. Plan and simple.
---
I'd rather you didn't. But I can't stop you, anyway...
---
In another post someone counted a little over a hundred. Its possible there was another workshop on the server that also had over a hundred. Then again this was also on a public world, so if you were on a private one it'd be less detrimental to the servers stability.
---
As for 'priority', that doesn't excuse the fact that this is still an exploit and can possibly get you banned for doing it. But you know this. So good luck to you...
---
What I meant was that I thought that all cards unlocked by 50 - I know builds need to be above 50 usually to get their full potential.
---
Automatic pistol or semi-automatic - it really doesn't matter. The fact is that ANY pistol, no matter how you improve it, whatever mods you put on, with any perks, will be a priori inferior to the weakest rifle. This is the message of my words. It is necessary that pistols are not inferior to rifles, but only in certain uses. As an example, a rifle is powerful, long-range and noisy. It has a good hitting distance, but in stealth she deals x2.5 damage with a perk. The pistol is low-power, with a small firing radius, but it is quiet and its damage from stealth is increased. When close, the pistol will do more damage, but move away a little and the pistol assembly will be useless.
---
Or another option: two pistols in each hand. With the perk, you can take a couple of pistols and use them at the same time. The damage will be more due to the rate of fire.
---
Rebuilding America wasn't the actual purpose of vault 76
---
Spoiler:
---
It was securing the automated silos for vault-tek
---
Dedicated players in action
---
It was great. I actually made two new friends that were incredibly helpful. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the person who teamed up with me to basically have an actual answer to every single question I threw at him.
---
I was a bit disappointed at the never-ending sight of gold, but only 1000 or so ended up loot-able.
---
This is pretty much my game session too, other than I dont do thrill of the grill or someone to talk too, or cap farm anymore.
---
I usually keep a few of each booze on me so I find it super easy to complete the Biz daily when I turn in heart of the enemy. I always pick up the Biv first incase I get the one where you have to craft armor while drunk, because there is an armor bench in the room you turn in SB DNA.
---
And if its a booze I dont have I just save it for the next play session and hope it updates to a type I have when I log back in.
---
Maybe it's different person to person. I've never had any budget taken up by them. And in the image above, there's no way that the person can put that many down and still be within the budget of the workshop.
---
How hard is it to get Ultralight mods added for SS? It's beginning to feel like Bethesda's stretching out mod releases on purpose to give a sense of constant "progression".
---
I hope the walls issue is finally put to bed properly and they haven't created even further build bugs trying to fix the last one.
---
So happy the walls issue is reverted. have had to do soooo many work arounds in camp building so removing that originally was a real bother.
---
Further you get into his quest tree, the more you have to make. "Wasted on X" requires you to make a recipe he teaches you and wait for it to ferment. I do these because learning the recipe is worth it to me. 
---
Aslo I dont sweat it if it takes me a day or two to complete
---
I never use bobble heads they‚Äôre too hard to find.  But before the last double do weekend I was a bloodied build without about 5 Base int.  Levels didn‚Äôt matter much but I did use unyeilding and I got to level 600 just focusing on farming legendaries at that point.  When the first real info came out on the pts on the legendary perk system came out, I switch to a high str and high int build.  With the changes to carnivore and herbivore and the addition of lunchboxes I got up to a little under 700 in that one weekend.  It‚Äôs never been easier to level, and stop assuming everyone is cheating.  If you can‚Äôt be bothered to learn how to legit level up you won‚Äôt get anywhere.
---
I‚Äôll add you as soon as I‚Äôm back online. Keep an eye out for a follow from BadWolfGirl#1122
---
Always read the fine print. That would be a classic Bethesda move.
---
Is there usually an enemy versus enemy random encounter spawn just outside? If so, it's in the Savage Divide, close by Ripper Alley. There's a Nuka Cola machine inside that usually has a Nuka Dark or Cranberry in it.
---
Ugh, a friend that made the blueprint placed one of these at my camp as a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù (he was genuinely trying to be nice) and now I can‚Äôt delete it. I don‚Äôt want to move my camp to delete it because I‚Äôve spent two years on building it exactly the way I want it. I just leave it unlocked and let anyone access it as a bit of penance, but I‚Äôd love to delete this thing and just use the regular mini ammo factory you can build from fully aligning with the raiders.
---
I think the Lever hitting for so much less is some kind of bug. The damage decrease for Gauss seems more reasonable.
---
I also second the other comments that Fallout should be hard and I'm glad the Deathclaws should be the apex predator. On live I'm more scared of Yao-Guais or Radscorpions than Deathclaws. So what you say about Deathclaws sounds great. I miss the feeling of Dread when encountering Deathclaws in previous games...
---
Your attempts to justify it do nothing to change the discussion nor add anything to it. An exploit is still an exploit.
---
What do you mean faster reload perk? I don‚Äôt think I have any cards for that
---
Since each additional buff will have diminishing returns than the previous I suspect it will be closer to your second option depending on your build.
---
I‚Äôm loving my Instigating Explosive 33VATS pipe revolver rifle with pistol and rifle perks equipped. Feels like something MacGyver would throw together if he had a thing for guns.
---
Ah. I see. Sorry, my bad for not understanding what you meant.
---
Pretty awesome. 
---
It‚Äôs always interesting shooting something in the face with a level 45 shotgun and it doing absolutely nothing and then watching a fellow player punch them in the nose once and they fall over dead.
---
Appreciate the response and sorry to hear it won't be in today's patch. I've heard some folks were able to have support reset the quest for them. Is that an option?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs some locations with cats that naturally span in if u wanted to make your camp around one of those spots idk all the locations but I know there‚Äôs one that has like 3 cats that all spawn in close by that is available as a camp spot
---
i'd love it if they made it even more versatile. 
---
a pipe .50cal with a massive ammo pool sounds fun to have. should it equally compare to other guns, no, but with the right legendary effects it should be able to pull its weight and let low level people really experiment with different weapon types
---
No it's not gonna happen because pvp playerbase is toxic in general. Speaking of pvp and gaming experience, quake 3 arena is for free atm if you login through Beth launcher. Enjoy
---
Xbox has a nice "capture what just happened" feature that would be helpful in situations such as this.
---
We tried this the other day and It doesn‚Äôt actually work like they say it does (shocker).
---
1* Rippers can apparently still be gotten at the Monster Mash event it off the vendor for redeeming 1,000+ candies.  I seem to only get about 300 candies each playthrough, so it'll take a while to see one.
---
Be as it may I'd rather you 'acquired' said tech from the Raiders (Ammo Machine) and/or the Legendary Run (Converter) or you yourself taking over the Ammunition Factory. Please don't dirty the reputation through abusing an exploit...
---
...Do I even need to explain this...?
---
I probably claimed some of the prizes, but I'm not super consistent with doing it.  It doesn't look like I have any of the items.  I imagine you think that I would have them in my inventory/crafting if I claimed them at some point even if my progress regressed?
---
after maintenance is done which could be a few days
---
Bloodied people fucking up other people surely is one of the reasons why the damage nerf is happening. Just a food for thought...
---
Just curious, but how do you give them back their loot?  I'm very new at this game, so perhaps I misunderstand. 
---
But I thought the only loot that drops is junk.  I always have junk on me, so if I accidentally picked up someone else's, I'd have no way of knowing what was theirs and what was mine.
---
I mean I would rather look for him then try to find the right angle to where he talks to me. I still have to stand behind him and click the interact button, sometimes i have to stand on top of him for him to give me the quest. But "it just works"
---
Well if fixed it would populate the pvp pool with player not so toxic. And thank you for the quake info I will look into. I enjoyed this discourse. Until next time new best friend!
---
Explain to me how you are able to do this. I struggle to get 1 level a day at 400. I use groups food and bobbles and have a great farming run that ive seen on many youtube videos. Im guessing you are doing something different to get more xp per kill though and id love to know what that is.
---
PC people, enjoy your tire irons and pipe pistols!
---
I can get online if the timing works for ya
---
There extra boost from unyeilding is tiny in comparison to the other buffs you can get on any build.  So far, I see most of the complaining comes from people barely playing the game or who don‚Äôt understand the mechanics of the game asking to get something that was intended to be worked for over a long period of time for free.
---
Imagine thinking I cared about the ammo itself and not the method of how it was obtained. Lol.
---
You know the secret to shotguns is to use them point-blank in VATS, right?  With your stealth suit, that should be trivial.
---
And here I am never one shotting anything but a radroach (hardcore mode self inflicted)
---
They were on average level 50s, but they were robots which seem to be harder than most enemies for me. And robots tend to be the most annoying ammo sponges for me, personally.
---
And it‚Äôs the main quest line for the S.S vault 97.
---
^^ this
---
I think it‚Äôs all part of Fallout 76 being an asset flipper. Bethesda wanted to save money across the board, and so took it to the illogical extreme of only tasking a handful of people to work on atomic store content - thereby chopping the legs out from under their main revenue stream on this game. Also, I expect a *lot* of this stuff was queued up before the game launched. That‚Äôs why we get weird additions like pickaxe skins when its demonstrably not what the player base wants.
---
I just want my deathclaw to be immortal like camp allies are
---
Ah I'm really not condoning the use, even in that first message I said this was bad behavior. I played off the response, but I have plenty of ammo without glitching. Anyone who's played since beta has used ammo for caps longer than caps.
---
I didnt say that, what I said was it wouldnt have solved the issues that this game faces.  
---
I personally belive they wanted to make FO4 multiplayer anyway but changed their mind when they realised how big of an effort that was going to be and would have taken too long in development.  
---
Theres certain things that scream multiplayer in the settlement menu that make no sense in single player, the biggest one that springs to mind (since its been a few years since I last played FO4 now) is the trap doors, NPCs dont fall for trap doors, so why would they be there? to catch yourself in a trap?
---
When people complain about why Bethesda can't increase the camp budget, this is the reason.
---
Server lag, not people exploiting shit.
---
Do you realize what you just asked Bethesda to do?
---
\&gt;  an account-wide stashbox 
---
 Bethesda does what they do best and goes to extremes. When asking Bethesda for anything we have to be **Extremely Specific** like talking to a young child. Or you will get what you asked for!
---
They will give us (**One) 800 Pound stash Box** shared Account wide!
---
I do 40-50 for average plans, 10 for basic plans like mounted stuff, and a more custom price for rarer plans but never for too much at all. Never really had a problem moving out whatever with plans this way.
---
I mean it's a win win.  I get to a point where I have to drop Legendaries sometimes if I don't proce them to move.  If I get lucky and get a bunch of 3*s at 450 for weapons and 275 for armor, I'm rich lol... jk
---
Yeah, he informed me last night after watching me a few times.
---
There have been lots of reports of the quest being broken and not able to be completed.  Doesn't mean its not worth trying though.  It is an unmarked quest by the way, you just need to google where to go and what to do and give it a shot.
---
Well it's easy, I usually carry no junk with me and if it's a lot I'll just drop everything, if not I remember roughly what it was. But honestly I've never ever been asked to give it back or saw a person who would come back after their loot. Usually I see a package laying lonely on the ground for minutes. So meh. Besides stable flux there's literally nothing really valuable that can drop in the junk.
---
I agree, would totaly love to see them implement mechanics to make pistols more useful instead of just be a rifle "wannabe" lol. I too am a handgun main.
---
I think the best solution would be:
---
Reduce the effective range by 33%, but maybe make handguns have  increased VATS accuracy and make them do 1.5x more damage to enemies weak spots to make up for their low base damage and capacity. So in theory headshots would do 3.5√ó damage with handguns instead of 2x , plus you would still need to factor in sneak damage aswell.
---
Their A team is a bunch of unpaid modders who love Fallout, but don‚Äôt want it to go to waste.
---
What do you run consumables wise? Highest thing (other than lunchboxes ) I use is scorchbeast brains for 7.5 int and well rested
---
I'm not sure on that one.
---
Wait, are the servers down on console right now or just PC? Need to know if I can run home from work on launch to grab my scrip for today...
---
I posted my speed run of the burrows, you can clear it in under 5 mins with the right build.  With buffs you can get 20,000xp a run and over 300,000-400,000 xp an hr.  It‚Äôs boring as hell and I‚Äôd wish they‚Äôd add more areas to grind at or adding different ways to get more xp.
---
I tried telling you that when I built your shotgun.
---
3 days if its your first offense. The next offense they consider a life ban if the infraction/exploit is bad enough. If not its 7 days. 3rd strike and youre perma banned and have to buy the game again.
---
Hacked weapon. That minigun has a mirv launcher as a barrel
---
Nice, I can get online now :)
---
Exactly. I have a pipe build and it's pretty powerful
---
Oh ok, thank you
---
Hey, whatever happens in Single-player stays in Single-player. As for Private Worlds I'm willing to be a bit more lenient but still caution people against it as its still an **exploit in a multiplayer / online game.**
---
If you wish to take that risk while on a private world, that's all on you my man. I don't want players like you getting banned for this. But I will still report it if I see it on public worlds because it can cause server stability issues...
---
Jesus you def got a point on that one take the upvote lol
---
It‚Äôs probably the same reason they can‚Äôt increase the stash by too much. If they‚Äôre telling the truth and that is an issue, then it would probably mess it up even more than the regular stash
---
Not all weapons should be equally viable. They serve a purpose as an entry level weapon.
---
You know...this just occurred to me, but theoretically besides ghouls, scorched, humans and wendigoes, you don‚Äôt have to harm any animal types if you don‚Äôt want to. You literally can be a Snow White of the Forrest if you want to be with the Animal and Whisperer perks maxed out.
---
Never carry junk?  So just don't pick up anything?  How do you repair your armor and weapons?
---
No they took it off the menu.
---
Honestly the biggest con is that Bethesda apparently wants to re-balance damage calculations and nerf damage, and release one wasteland in the same update. 
---
Top end damage nerfs are warrented, and changing calculations for easier balance sounds good, if they actually act on it. Nerfing the damage across the board and making every opponent level 100 at the same time will be a disaster, I am sure. They should change their damage calculations, see how every build plays afterwards, buff the worse builds accordingly, adjust EHP of enemies, and only then try to roll out one wasteland.
---
Go full intelligence, worry about your build later. Add in as many intelligence buffs as you can, cranberry relish, brain bombs or brain fungus soup, also use the egg head and herbivore mutations as soon as you can, use brahmin milk instead of radaway, get addicted to berry mentats and ask someone to help you power level. Go bloodied and unyielding until you're ready to change your build as you want, with boosted intelligence it's by far the quickest way to level up. Lunchboxes at Line in the Sand help too.
---
I started a new character about 2 weeks ago, I'm already over level 200
---
Haha I just tried; forgot it‚Äôs a patch day. Gonna have to wait a bit
---
Raider train station vendors. Think I got mine in Sutton.
---
When I had 110 spread over three workshops it was in a public session. To test if it would crash the server, even just on my end, I set up a springboard system to launch myself from Wade Airport to Tyler co dirt track, and then to Billings homestead. This way I wasn‚Äôt fast traveling but instead flying and loading in everything very quickly to see if it would crash that way. Never did. And it had to have loaded in sooo much stuff from one workshop to the other and everything in between. Not sure if having 100 at each would have changed much, but who‚Äôs got the mats for all those fusion generators!
---
I just don‚Äôt agree that they shouldn‚Äôt be used. If bethesda really saw them as much of an issue they would have fixed them in the last two updates or at least addressed and acknowledged it as an exploit on Reddit or in the forums. So unless they patch it, it‚Äôs fair game in my book. It literally hurts no one and doesn‚Äôt cause any noticeable server crashes. But I appreciate your concern.
---
Tis the way of the wastelandü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
He's awful now. He can mutter on ignoring you for a while, or sit there waving a gun about. Can take a couple attempts to turn in the quest. 
---
He was fine just before the fix to make him syationary in one place. At night he was in bed. During the day he was in his office. And in the evening he was socialising by the music. Wasn't hard to find him, he would talk to you 1st time and he wasn't trying to swat a fly with an assault rifle.
---
All damage was nerfed. Bloodied will still dish out more damage than others though so no worries.
---
oh i've been doing the bivs since it came out. it took me several months to realise you don't have to craft the drink. i learned all the recipes long ago but still do it for some reason and sell the plans. i met a level 145 the other day that had no idea biv existed
---
Either way your still my hero
---
Do you mean vault 79?(the vault you break into during the wastelanders questline) If you still need help I can get on soon
---
I been in the habit of doing large batches of rarer ammo and fusion cores for consistency cause they sell.  Good plans I know will get rid of, cause I hate going to others and seeing the same shit over and over, so I like to keep it cleaned up and nice. Any other flux I can‚Äôt use goes fast and profitable. I also have a few signs saying I‚Äôm willing to craft what I can for dirt cheap. I don‚Äôt get much that way but I really dig when someone reaches out for that stuff
---
Yeah, I just tried, forgot about it lol. Well, I will most likely log in later when it's done. Goodbye my dailies tho xD
---
I never used Pipe Weapons, even as I was starting out. There were plenty of better weapons available and ammunition for those weapons plentiful as well.
---
Just PC.
---
There‚Äôs been things of a disturbing nature going on at the McBride Corral. Seems every night one of their herd meets a most unnatural death, and always there‚Äôs holes all over the body. Work of the chupacabra, the livestock vampire, says No-bark, but they don‚Äôt pay no mind. Too many holes, they say, and there‚Äôs bullets in them. Well, says No-bark, we got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that‚Äôs when they get real quiet, 'cause now they see the predicament we‚Äôre in. I come face to face with the chupacabra himself one night whilst I was investigating whether this gecko was hiding his treasure from me. He was the meanest, ugliest chupacabra you could imagine. Had two heads, and fangs down to the ground. Best I could tell, anyways, since when he come up to me he was invisible. Had himself a blunderbuss what would rotate and shoot bullets real fast out of a backpack. Never seen nothing like it. Walked right past me having an argument with somebody. But I only saw the one chupacabra, so I guess the other fella had to be invisible too. Only more invisible than the other one.

My int is 58 and I doubt your ability to get 5 per hour without an xp weekend or 4 lunchboxes.  You are not consistently getting that.
---
I will admit that does classify it as an exploit. A silly one at that. I bet that can be used to make some really audacious builds. But in my opinion that really doesn't warrant a ban. More of a 'we're patching this silly thing and moving on'.
---
But a buildable object that shouldn't be built in the first place that can be quickly spammed to the point of server problems while being used as a mass-ammo farm? That ones a bit more deserving I think.
---
I run a Heavy Guns build and I tear through stuff with my LMG. However, during public events I **ALWAYS** equip a VE gattling that does minimal damage but area damage for "tagging". We all know we can one shot/quick kill stuff just being considerate goes a long way during public events.
---
This.  If you have a set location that's easy to get to, I feel you will see a lot of people undercutting the robots, but very few good deals.
---
Im a handgun main, although i am eagerly looking forward to the new changes, im going to be very sad when i leave home with out my revolvers because theyre just not going to be effective anymore. That is rather unfortunate. 
---
However im staying positive because if these new mechanics are truly easier to balance for bethesda, im hoping they take advantage of it and boost slow weapons and melee to make them viable again with the new damage calculations.
---
Yeah, I was using Vats like you‚Äôd mentioned whenever I remembered to do it, but I wasn‚Äôt aware that I had to be right in their face. I also had to move my perks around for VATs and shotguns. 
---
I‚Äôve also retired the stealth suit for now. It breaks too much and it‚Äôs too tedious to constantly find the materials right now. We can be twins again once I‚Äôve got a nice hoard of materials.
---
awesome! can't wait to dive into this buggy mess when the maintenance is over in a few weeks
---
So I used to just run 1 chr with like 1 point in tenderizer, but I switched to 4 chr, 1 to share strange in numbers and 3 points in inspirational.  You can always swap it out for bosses or whatever, but that is an absolute must.
---
There are a few guaranteed spawns for squirrels and I like carnivore much better than herbivore so I use those.  I rarely use the scorchbeast brains because it‚Äôs a waste of time to go farm them before grinding.  I might get some from the queen or whatever but I don‚Äôt go out of my way for them.
---
Egghead is great.  I have been hoarding the lunchboxes, on the pts you can buy them for gold bullion, so as long as that change sticks all my bullion will go to lunch boxes.
---
But even if you use those, if you don‚Äôt play the right areas, it‚Äôs a waste of time.
---
I just lug around a separate set of PA (although it is for extra carry weight) and it only weighs 10
---
Because it was dev room item?
---
Monoghan powerplant is the other one where I saw it. There was a horde of super mutants trashing it, so I killed them.
---
Ward is bugged for me in a good way.  He gives me the task, I go and see Paige, come back and talk to him and task completes.  I tell him to keep reward, get a larger boost to status then the game gives me the reward.  This has happened the last half dozen times ive been to see him.
---
I took over posideon after someone had done this. Not going to lie it was nice to get the little extra ammo. 
---
Someone took it from me after like 20 minutes though.
---
I had my camp near a raider spawn, they used to hang around the camp and fight off intruders
---
Dropping loot upon death and running the risk of someone else taking your junk is a pretty minor penality for dying. Other games allow a total inventory drop and a chance to loose what ever you had in your inventory. Firearms, armor, junk, aid, etc...
---
Be happy Bethesda has a soft death penality.
---
Also guided meditation usually spawns alot from what I've seen doing it lately
---
Oh. You're are one of those people who thinks Corona is the black plague and that it's gonna usher us into a new dark age, and yeah to the vast majority of people it's a cough and some body aches(aka. slightly worse than a Flu virus) also once it's gone it'll be gone for a good more than likely, not a recurring think like the Flu that kills about 250,000-500,000 people a year and has a vaccine.
---
(So instead of being an ignorant ass how about you either knowing what the hell your talking about, or talking things out like a normal person at the very least)
---
(Also funny how you didn't reply to anything regarding the original conversation, guess you concede that argument)
---
Last info was that it starts thursday
---
Comes down to playing smart.  I run the burrows in under 5 mins and I just constantly hit that over and over.  If you are doing something else you‚Äôre not getting those highest xp possible in the game right now.
---
Is this stuff already on console? or its going to be later? i recall them saying colossal problem is live today but is it only on PC?
---
Yeah. Haha. I don‚Äôt know why I flipped it in my head. We actually completely accomplished it last night smooth sailing. Thank you!
---
Until now i photographed everything correctly including a yao for the "mammalogist".
---
Welcome to the new darksouls courtesy of Bethesda
---
jesus christ
---
Alright cool
---
I have an instigating +40% power attack grognak axe that can one shot (or very nearly so) most stuff if they have full health without adrenal reaction or even a single melee perk equipped, so melee is still viable. I run bloodied heavy weapons otherwise. I did a bit of math, and my bloodied gauss minigun should still be cranking out like 220+ damage per shot after the patch, and my bloodied plasma caster will still be putting out 665 damage per shot. Bloodied will most definitely still be a viable build. Even more so with the poison resistance legendary perk, since poison attacks are about the only thing which can even hurt me much. I wear t-65 power armor and use blocker, nerd rage, emergency protocols, and dodgy. Even more so with food buffs to DR and ER, especially with carnivore. About the only thing I'm afraid of are stingwings, mirelurk hunters/kings, and those poison floaters.
---
To be fair you think those commando builds with gun fu are gonna stop tapping away if they target a legendary ? ;) events like uranium probably is heavy gunners  being inconsiderate if they kill the miner too quickly but if its a group of enemies like queen fights where they spawn together unlike rifles that pick them off in vats most heavy guns are spray and pray meant to to just create a barrage of death so is unintentional
---
Holy crap. I've only seen them spawn as mobs at the ammo workshop. Where is your base?
---
good point, but yah maybe its different per person, im pretty positive fallout 1st subscribers have a lil bit more budget and build space than others so maybe thats a factor
---
You obviously like farming legendaries while I don't. If I see one then I'll kill it but I don't want to server hop 40-50 times a day farming Wes tek Huntersville and other locations nearby or constantly launch nukes when I can't even find a nuclear key card to save my life. I can't even bother doing all the boring events outside of radiation rumble or project paradise. Scorched earth is a *fine I'll go it* event. It's neither fun nor boring, just a thing to do. I get more exp thru nw camping in a bush than I do actively playing adventure mode.
---
This would work on so many levels.
---
Honestly - and I have no idea if this is popular or controversial - I believe they should completely redo the system of taming creatures. Maybe by getting rid of the perks and having it done another way, combining the two existing perks, etc. This current system is too clunky
---
I‚Äôm laughing at this now, yet I‚Äôll be crying about this later.
---
I refuse to use a bloodied build, I can't stand having low health
---
'  We are going to monitor some of the changes it contains over the next few days, and then apply the hotfix to console versions of the game later this week. ' Cool. i coulda swore ITV said the event was live today, but they didnt mention it was only PC
---
But somehow they add in a infinite junk storing box but that is behind an ¬£11.99 a month membership
---
Ammo Factory. Won't ever have issues with obtaining large quantities of ultracite 2mm. But I can see the need for other things like the SPECIAL boosts.
---
looks like I need to visit more servers.
---
Right near Monongah. There is a big power tower right near it. (those things that look like the Eiffel tower, with the power cables hooked up. that thing). My base is right under it.
---
They planned on giving F1 members a larger budget but haven't followed through. I canceled mine after the last update and didn't notice a difference.
---
I've been frequently guilty of underestimating the max level ones and soon regretted it. Even some of the lower level ones can be a seious threat in numbers. I did a defense event at Monongah Power Plant and the waves of them all spawned together inside the substation and start blasting. Nightmare stuff when you're basically boxed in with them.
---
The community always wanted text chat, just like every other game out there.
---
The legendary stat ones have my eye too, pretty much every build has perk cards they'd take if they had just a few more points.
---
Pick any artificial daily limit in this game and the exact same argument can be made.
---
If Bethesda doubled all the daily limits tomorrow, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the change barely registers in any meaningful way.
---
I already run that full time (forgot to list it)
---
Ah I'm a melee build so the only ammo I ever need is .50 for my 2shot hmg, and even then only for sbq/windego colossus
---
I‚Äôm going to get master infiltrator, but not level it up, +3 to both will be enough.  After that I‚Äôm thinking I might actually go after ‚ÄúWhat Rads‚Äù.  I have a concept for a ghoulish build using Rad Resistant, High Rad Resistant Armor, Rad Sheild, Ghoulish, and What Rads to see if I can do nuke zones without a radiation suit.  Might also combine it with Rad Sponge (and share that perk) with my non-bloodied friends.  
---
Otherwise I might just go for END, I always dump END because there are perks I like but aren‚Äôt necessary for my build, even a couple of points into END will let me add things like domedary that I don‚Äôt otherwise use.
---
Ammo Factory, Electric Absorption, Power Armor Reboot, Power Sprinter, Taking One for the Team and What Rads?  
---
I'm a general purpose PA Heavy Gunner, so it all suits me fine.  
---
I'd actually consider Far-Flung Fireworks if they weren't a "chance-on-death" effect. It's less practical in the long run.
---
I would be totally ok with this if they had much better rewards, after all they are supposed to be the hardest enemies in the game.
---
The scrip limit isn‚Äôt 150. It‚Äôs 750 per account. Or did you forget you can make 5 chars?
---
Lvl your other 4 chars to 50, give them fixer and bear arm plans and you‚Äôll never have too much scrip legendaries. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to do that, it‚Äôs ok. You can easily find people like myself who buy extra scrip from players for a fair price for both parties. 
---
I spend around 10K caps every week just buying scrip
---
I have been wanting to experiment with this. It sounds promising. I would like to see what is possible with all of the different pre built structures. I think the train car and the blood eagle nest have potential if I can figure it out. I really wish they had not messed the build system up even more with patch 21.
---
Legendary Strength, then reassigning some points around in order for my heavy gunner main to pick up some other valuable normal perks while also gaining access to all the most sought after NW perk cards (which usually require 9 in a stat).
---
Also I didn't buy a single serum, just chugged a lot of dirty water. I honestly don't see the point of being selective with mutations nowadays, since even the most maligned ones (Empath and Herd Mentality) are actually really really damn useful with the introduction of public groups.
---
Actually, that's just from the meat piles!!
---
love this
---
If we could make mods and sell them I'd probably be rolling in caps (for 5 minutes) from making Ultracite Calibrated Shocks mods and putting them up for sale.... For all 30 of us that have Strangler Heart Power Armor :(
---
same here
---
Anything that gives a dmg boost
---
I've got close to 30. 
---
It all started out with a harmless drop from an ash heap horde. 
---
Now I'm server hopping and scouring camps looking for more.
---
Like what the fuck was so hard about seeing if he was picking crops or something?
---
Weird fix.
---
I thought Bethesda had only features, no bugs nor exploits.
---
Idk. a single MK-V was able to kill about 30 ghouls from monongah, until some guy in full power armor went to my camp to check it out, and he helped me kill the... Tiny sentry bot basicaly.

Bethesda doesn't _really_ do faction stuff. Obisidian did with New Vegas, but Bethesda has never quite figured it out.
---
* Fallout 3 - No factions. There are "good people" and "bad people", but nothing more nuanced than that.
---
* Skyrim - Be a Legionnaire, be a Stormcloak, doesn't really matter outside of an insanely small smattering of circumstances.
---
* Fallout 4 - You can play all three major "factions" for the entirety of the game. I usually cheese it this way to get chuckles out of the Bunker Hill mission where when I stroll up all groups are non-hostile towards me and I can just stroll to the mission end unharmed. You never really see any of the major factions interact with each other, and choices for one mean nothing to the other.
---
* Fallout 76 - Well, same ol', same ol.
---
At the end of the day, Bethesda doesn't really do choice or consequence and never really have. Their stance is to give everything to everyone and not have any real depth to the gameplay. This is why Bethesda games get the notion of "ocean wide, puddle deep", and I'd argue it's a pretty valid design choice. They aim for wide, mainstream appeal, and they do that by ensuring that basically nothing you ever do is permanent. 
---
If the faction you chose mattered and these clashes occurred, some small percentage of people would gripe that they can't switch sides. It's just way easier to never implement actual faction stuff too, obviously :)
---
I might be bad person but when I see someone's ArmCo open making the ammo I use and always need I take it. I once got like 1k 5mm for free. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but I need it and it was free.. so. I lock mine tho üòÇ
---
True, but theres only like 20 junk items. While it does get strained when somebody has like 200 million steel scraps, it‚Äôll probably run better than having 100 legendaries with different effects and durability in there. I can see how that may be suspicious though. I just can‚Äôt see Bethesda going that low and blatantly lying about the limitations. I grew up with their games, so maybe I‚Äôm a bit bias
---
I have the mothman fog machine blowing smoke, I have beds and couches all in the room, painted the walls with the galaxy glow in the dark paint,  have the rotating raider lamp.  Plushies all over the place.
---
They should add a way to exit the game when servers are under maintenance.
---
What rads, taking one for the team, anti venom, then maybe master infiltrater, the rest special perks
---
AA doesn't stack that well. You get diminishing returns after the first one. If you have nothing else better to spend the perk points on, then may as well go for it.
---
While on AA, I wonder if the PTS damage changes will mean that AA gets a damage buff as the armour reductions will be additive, rather than multiplicative.
---
thanks for fucking up server stability by exploiting a glitch..
---
really appreciate that..
---
Armour piercing rounds
---
That would be so cool! I would love to see some new rewards for the raiders and settlers. However if they do add those they have to make it easier to get reputation aside from dailies!
---
There's a workaround on the bottom of this page. Used it a few days ago and worked great!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/An_Ounce_of_Prevention
---
They do roam in herds üò¢ they do
---
Unforgivable that they couldn't patch the smaller updates today like the deep pocketed mods for SS.
---
I get the Colossal Problem hold off but the other hotfixes shouldn't have been an issue.
---
I am going to have to take the Poison Resist since it works with PA, and the rest will be for my Specials. Strength,  Perception, Endurance, Intelligence, Agility.
---
Join Builders public teams and eat XP food like cranberry relish. Look for the "Feed the People" event to get canned stew or whatever it's called. 
---
I went from level 80 to 160 in about a month. Did a lot of Uranium Fever, Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand events to get a lot of XP. If you are low level those may be a bit hard, but you get the point.
---
Get the Inspiration perk card under Charisma and use that while in a team. It grants, 5, 10 or 15% XP.
---
Good luck.
---
What happened to their eyes?? That's what I want to know. &lt;shiver&gt; uhhhh
---
Odd that it is easier to get the harpoon gun than the shovel or pickaxe. WTF were they mining in there? Ambergris?
---
The true cursed weapons are the floater grenades we'll no doubt get as a reward.
---
This is the kind of answer I was looking for. Thank you for your assistance.
---
He is becoming self aware!
---
uh... what is the "Plan: Meat Pile"? Is that a CAMP decoration for gore? if so, im in.
---
Any pictures/video,Platform,username,or are we ment to forever wander the wastes of Apalachia in search of magical haven?
---
Destroying the gear that ppl spent 100s of hours to get makes the game untrustable. Cant spend that again just to have it remove once more.
---
It would be wise. Pistols need to be remake
---
But beyond tweaking the perks, weapons and armour your character doesn't actually improve (stats wise anyway) beyond 50 right? So bumping up to level 100 SM will push them beyond a lot of the players who don't play the meta right now.
---
At least in something like ESO past 50 you still gain abilities and modifiers and actually get better, we don't have that kind of system. I hope legendary perks make a BIG difference or it's going to turn the game into forcing everyone to push for the current meta to do enough damage to enter the bog.
---
&gt;So far as I know they are available, though they have to be decoded, in game.
---
The information you quoted about Takano isn't in those broadcasts. Plus those broadcasts are still being slowly revealed in game. Your source probably datamined it (something I personally despise) and we don't even know if it is going to be live content or not.
---
As far as the nukes go, He specifically says they are cyclical and that the nukes will have to keep coming, meaning they really are not a permanent solution. Thus my comment on the Scorchbeast Queen. We do not have a definitive answer on the nukes being the end all of the scorched, and I doubt we will get one, because it honestly was not really thought out from a long term play perspective.
---
If they are the answer, well, we just ended all of Appalachia and we might as well go live with the mole miners, also it totally invalidates wastelanders. Why would they come back to to nuclear hellhole?
---
On the vaccine topic, we don't have a vaccine, we have an inoculation. We also don't know how long it lasts, and there is always the possibility that the scorched have ranged out of Appalachia at this point. They had years to fly around without being contained to the Bog region. There is a ton of wiggle room in this story for it to go in any direction Bethesda wants.
---
Glad they fixed the future tech camp module thing and the doorways. I‚Äôm surprised they were even aware of the build budget exploit. I knew about it but never saw it mentioned once on here.
---
IIRC, I read something about how there were actually 2 different Grognak 10s in the database or something like that.  
---
It's just obvious that the counter is not based off the progress list and instead there were 2 different counts going on.  One for each issue to be checked off and one for the count to go up.  Something fulfilled 1 condition without fulfilling the other.
---
Not Precious Ambergris!?
---
I saw i guy with a friendly deathclaw in his camp
---
At least you will only get a single one each time. Looking on the bright side, I guess?
---
Going against the grain and saying absolutely Deep Pocketed without a doubt. I can rep 325 carry weight easily and just load myself up with stuff because of perks like Pack Rat or Bear Arms (I'm a big guns build).
---
And yeah you lose the bonuses in PA but I personally don't care since I only use my PA for heavy battles; I swap all my perks to heavy guns so I'm over my carry limit regardless but I hit like a truck. Plus Marsupial/Speed Demon/Action Girl perks make you fast af anyways
---
Yeah I agree with what your saying but i was thinking maybe just a 100lb shared stash as they upped the limit from 400 to 800
---
It would be worth checking, yes. It seems more likely you are misremembering, than you lost 18 levels of progress and had rewards taken away.
---
i noticed my friend being able to build me and bigger, but it might just be me
---
They did the odds a very different way that I've never seen before. I'm hoping this will have the result of being much more predictable. We'll have to wait and see.
---
That‚Äôs fine in theory but my guess is that they want to keep all builds closer to the lower builds damage so they don‚Äôt have to make even more hp enemies and bosses
---
I don't know the numbers so I can't really say regarding AA stacking, but you could also consider vampire weapons if you don't really want to go bloodied or junkie, which you can combine with vanguard armor since they so much synergy together; more armor the more HP you have + healing on hit and you become quite tanky. Just an idea.
---
We play on x box 1
---
Lol 8 Treasury Notes? I already have a tonne of them I can't use.
---
Question on that; lets say i have a totally useless 3 star. (unyielding golf club or something stupid). A 3 star weapon goes for 40 scrip, how many caps would you pay for that item, knowing its specifically fo the purpose of turning into scrip?
---
I'd like to know about how AA is affected myself. 
---
Given the bonuses are additive there now, in theory that sounds like the damage changes are a buff to AA as multiplicative armour reduction give you diminishing returns after the first one, where as additive you get the full value of each one.
---
You obviously arent a heavy gunner because most heavy gunners I know or play with will share what ammo they have and all go farming for materials together since we blow through rounds so fast. Making ammo scarce is a horrible idea. Chems I think would make it more lore friendly and give chems found in the wild more sought after. Just leave the ammo alone though. I already have a boring as fuck time trying to farm for materials. I legit spend three days of game time to farm for lead and kill enemies to get the steel I need. Only to have to do it all over again next week.
---
Weapons should lose max durability every time they are repaired (till they permanently break) .pipe weapons should be inaccurate but easier to repair and build.
---
So many other and some bigger problems got ignored, again. Oh well.
---
Go to Big Bend Tunnel, the center chamber of the tunnel, there's another passage behind that, there are about 10 or more Aluminum veins down the side of that tunnel. 
---
Teleport to Fort Defiance, turn around at the landing point, and get up on the cliffside there are three aluminum veins right there for when you need some quickly.
---
Soon as I finish the legendary run, gunna make a "Lab" themed camp and focus on mutation serums and chems
---
Maybe they can revert some of the enemy buffs like the Queen health to bring things back to normal.
---
So what if me and my 3 buddies are doing radion rumble and I'm getting the ore?
---
Or riding shotgun and im looking for the supplies while they defend? 
---
Im still contributing to the team and they're doing their part, but i get punished?
---
Don‚Äôt die ;)
---
If you solo her:
---
Focus on the adds, they can overwhelm you and also serve if you use adrenaline or fungi
---
Plan ahead with stims and radaway (diluted)
---
Backup vampire weapon
---
There have been exploits in the past that allowed you to get a bit more budget along with small differences in the value of different styles of the same item. It's possible they were just taking advantage of that.
---
Thanks for the heads up. You won't be getting any "your camp cannot be placed" warnings on my account. Good luck with the bot war!
---
They're something of a glass cannon though. Just target the legs and they tend to die quickly.
---
So if I went with the legendary effect I could afford to drop tank killer or the mag and get say demo expert and probably come out on top?
---
Fwiw; Most people hide in the elevator you ride up to the roof in to complete that quest.
---
Also, always make sure the quest updates properly before you move on to the next section.
---
And lastly, most quest bugs can be sorted by server hopping.
---
I think they need to buff weapon by weapon. I'd hate to see a blanket buff to rifles that just makes non-automatic fixers better too. I am trying to stay positive but I do fear if they keep doing 'one size fits all' changes (buffs or nurfs) it's just going to make the best weapons further away from the 2nd best or off meta weapons
---
Not true. Westek still gives you more XP per minute than any other location in the game. The DMV in Charleston is second. Remember that I am talking about XP per minute. I have every major location in the game charted out with how long it takes versus how much xp to you can obtain from that location. Spread out locations like the Burrows and the white Springs Golf Course take much longer and are not as good. I'm nearly level 500 so I'm not just some dude that doesn't know what he's talking about. You're not getting five levels per hour at level 750 I don't care what kind of Buffs you use.
---
If I ever voluntarily do anything in a game that's "boring as hell", please shoot me in the face. Life is too short as it is to be wasted like that.
---
When it‚Äôs green I just smash the place button 10-20 times and at some point it places the item.
---
the fixes are to fix an exploit. Some players were able to complete his daily over and over without a limitation. Within a hour they had a nice amount of scrip and treasure notes (and max rep).
---
&gt;	Underarmor: The Brotherhood of Steel Fatigues are now correctly categorized as Underarmor, rather than an outfit.
---
Remember when everyone was saying this obvious bug (IMO) was intentional. Glad it is fixed.
---
And I thought ounce of prevention was supposed to be fixed? Did I miss something?
---
I found the scorched respawn in line in the sand hilarious.
---
Exactly what I was thinking im stocking up on AA weps just in case
---
Haha glad you took it in good humour. Sounds like you had fun, did you split or take all the gold?
---
Time to grind more ammo as you'll need 2x as much.
---
And grind meds because your intake of damage will go up.
---
And repairing more often so more farming for materials.
---
Overall you'll fight less and farm more....
---
I see they are leaving a ton of glitches still working. Interesting..
---
I‚Äôm just trying to help manage my stash box brotha
---
Everytime I see a melee build at the SBQ event I'm reminded of a meme image of a guy gripping a baseball bat real hard with the words "waiting for the dragon to land" under it. But yeah, melee is a great way to conserve ammo. Used to run PA / Melee ages ago.
---
I'm assuming the harpoon gun is supposed to be comparable to a jack hammer, but it's about the best I've got.  
---
Maybe the mine supported out of work whalers?
---
Thats.....not an bad idea being super tanks is always fun. Though I haven't really felt the need to be more tanky yet I am already swimming in stim packs lol
---
It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to have slow internet. I‚Äôm running at around 6 mbps.
---
If your on console though it has been delayed.
---
Usually updates happen when reset happens.
---
3 months till cyberpunk 2077!
---
Have you checked it it works post patch?
---
Going to remember this comment,  when it turns out you and everyone else is still playing...
---
Yes it's already in the camp options.  Just need to unlock it.  Same with the plushie
---
"They know introducing a major grind is what keeps the players invested in the game to keep playing."     
---
Until the player asks, "What rewards am I getting for this again?   Does this feel more like work or fun?" and heads off to read a book instead.
---
Yeah, I'm not disagreeing. What of it?
---
did i mention that he had to use several fatman shots from a tower he built so he could kill it SAFELY. we couldnt even go into the town, because there was like 3 more of them already there. Still feel bad for the random noob who was hiding from the robots in a house... he got nuked.
---
[r/fo76] H:Rules W:them followed
---
I was told to take all of the gold so I did as told. He explained I could keep the rep or the gold. I ended up picking gold because I‚Äôm not a grindy player who‚Äôs going to amass large amounts of gold anyway.
---
Been asked before plenty of times mate, it ain‚Äôt happening. Sorry
---
If ultralight SS mods aren't there yet I'm not gonna be happy
---
Update end times have never been announced. People will post on here when it is live.

System and name? I‚Äôd love to drop by and check this out. I don‚Äôt do glitch builds myself, but I spend most of my time in game building and I‚Äôm always looking for inspiration.
---
Awesome, thanks for the info!  I may buy the plans for it tonight and give it a whirl.
---
The burrows is better with the right build and path by a lot.
---
Yep! It's actually been in the camp build menu since Wastelanders released. Under floor decor. Doesn't do anything but look...gutsy.
---
So with the 1-3 star mystery pick, is it a flat 1/3 chance to get 1, 2, or 3 star item or is it skewed at all?
---
&gt;On the other hand, they seem to have no issues whatsoever with using advanced technology like power armor, laser weapons, plasma weapons, giant robots, etc. for destructive purposes.
---
It's all about scale with the BoS. Power Armor, Laser Weapons, Plasma Weapons are seen as useful and not potentially world destroying. It's the big things that they tend to squash.  
---
This BoS is pretty strict on nukes and the like, I think you're right that Rahmani may decide to go another way (I hope not) but it wouldn't be in line with the current BoS ideology in play. Taggerdy even sacrificed herself in Operation Touchdown before going against Maxson's orders. It would be very out of character.
---
that guy with the ammo factories, yeah, he has to be
---
If you want to truly reset your budget to zero im sorry but move CAMP. Once you place camp again dont place any items. Delete all items from stored an log out. Log back in an you will be at 0/0
---
wykkyd tryppy
---
It is, there are also arms and legs sticking from it, haha. You can see a preview of it in building mode, in floor decorations.
---
And launches with bugs where half the items get sent to the void and they don't bother to recover them because they cant/don't want to.
---
Daddy, when I grow up I‚Äôm gonna be a warlord just like you!
---
Son, I‚Äôm not gonna be using this anymore. Go and wreak havoc with this weapon, and before you go... *Never. Ever. Let. It. Leave. Your. Inventory.* Understand?
---
Yes dad. *Son examines FE90 Gatling plasma* Where did you get this, dad?
---
We never talk about that.
---
Yaaaa. Its been in the Camp for a while now. You can view it (obviously can't place it without plans). I think its under floor decor :)
---
Yeah, who woulda thunk it? I was told it just works!
---
Yes, it really is a math problem. Plus, the game awards a very high volume of legendaries that people do not want, driving more scrip runs and stash/carry weight issues. The whole economics and logistics around legendaries seems only partially thought out. This isn‚Äôt Fallout 4 where I can just toss them into stash and forget about them. The game may award legendaries like a single player game, but it‚Äôs using mobile game rules to meter what we can do with them. Seems like there is plenty of room for creative solutions here. 
---
Here‚Äôs a few ideas ...
---
How come scrip can‚Äôt be like treasury notes where you can hold an infinite amount but can only cash in so much each day? Why do we have different rule sets for similar prestige currency systems?
---
How about an option to accept the legendary drop or cash out on the spot?
---
How about an option to break down a legendary for modules and/or vault steel?
---
Even if these ideas suck, I‚Äôm confident there‚Äôs a better way to manage legendaries out there than what we currently have.
---
I trust Bethesda is planning to rebalance enemy health and armor shortly after this because switching damage to additive makes calculating things much easier. I would say hold out a little while to anyone planning on quitting. I have a feeling that the game might be in it's best possible combat friendly state after all the changes are complete
---
How did he build so many lmao that's crazy
---
Maybe. You'd have to run the numbers and/or do some tests to be sure but there would be some combinations where going some other card (demo, bloody mess, tenderizer etc.) would be a net benefit for the small AA benefit you get only against higher armoured enemies.
---
Gotcha!  Why do you like them better than the ubiquitous minigun or even the ma deuce?
---
You‚Äôre not punished. You are helping to complete the event. Take turns with your friends.
---
Dishonoured 3 confirmed.
---
Only if they are wearing power armor.
---
I honestly think 100 is too low. If they were to do it I could see maybe 200-400, but who knows. Hopefully as they move forward to next gen they can make some much need improvements.
---
This is also true on Collectrons. You can lock the computer and the bin separately, so as to not only keep your scrap safe but stop anyone from changing parameters on it.
---
Right i'm crying wind when i can drop more kills than you any day of the week. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wrong page, but take a breath buddy.. Relax
---
Go scrip it.
---
Hmm... you know, that was actually one of my first thoughts, but no. This was ambient sound. Think about how in Diamond City, when you walked around, it sounded like there were crowds of people, when there were none. Same thing here. I‚Äôm starting to think Bethesda added it randomly in the world, to make it sound like there was a battle going on nearby between settlers and raiders, or some other opposing groups.
---
&gt; One of the changes in the notes for the hotfix: "Walls: Players can now correctly replace solid Walls with Doorway Walls when building in their C.A.M.P.s." 
---
Yeah, they didn't have much of a choice. Players cancelled their 1st subs over it so it's less that they listened and more that the players forced their hand.
---
heres the table i use. i dont vcare about item lvl, just script
---
some people might pay more, some might pay less

---
 Hopefully the vending glitch doesn't come back and you come back to an empty stash.
---
That what‚Äôs keep me playing the game
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm new here üò≠
---
I would love that. It would give high level players something to keep hunting for, instead of finding the one OP weapon that will never be replaced. If you needed to continually find new weapons, that would change the whole game.
---
Yup. I've easily helped kill and loot the queen at an absolute minimum at least 100 times. Still never got that achievement.
---
They are adding this feature my friend! Perk Loadouts.
---
One Wasteland would have been fine.
---
But the Damage Nerf or Weapons Nerf whatever you want to call it Was Not Necessary!
---
Bethesda has been looking for an excuse to Nerf everything since day one. They normally do it one weapon or armor at a time.  But this gave them a reason to take it to extremes.
---
 People were asking for newer bigger and harder Enemies, not a huge Nerf! Nobody wants to spend all week making, finding, or farming Ammo!
---
I don't have an exact end-time for you, but today's update for PC is pretty small in terms of download size (a handful of Megabytes for Bethesda.net/Steam, and ~1.5 GB for Microsoft Store), so hopefully your buddy will be able to grab it quickly compared to previous updates.
---
For sure, 100% agree.
---
PC but I am not gonna cop to something that could get me banned. Let's just leave it to luck.
---
It being in the PTS doesn't mean for certain that it'll be rolled out in a patch. Counting chickens and all.
---
Don't use semi auto, it eats more AP and drops you out of VATS more often, and every time you drop out of VATS you have to waste more ammo ramping Concentrated Fire back up. The extra damage per shot doesn't save ammo like you expect. Use powerful auto receiver.
---
Infiltrator + What RADs?
---
After that I guess I‚Äôll see how many coins I got left.
---
Load outs where on the road map, but I do t remember where
---
People always it is someone playing bloody, I would assume that it is someone being an ass.  Not all bloody players are asses, and not all asses play bloody.
---
It‚Äôs due to the pip boy. It has been discussed quite a bit.
---
Edit: edited out right hand because of a brain fart, however the pip boy was the reason why most weapons are weird like the bow.
---
I think that entire tab ends in 20 minutes.

What do you expect. He sits at his desk all day and all night without a break and his office is littered with empties. He‚Äôs clearly a low functioning alcoholic.
---
Level 300 and something. Stated basing my shops around selling all the serums. Then started selling Flux and stabilizing materials. Then started selling leveled The Fixers and a few low level BoS Recon Rifles for the noobs. 
---
Supplemented with rarer plans (like Cuckoo Clock, Nuka Cola Clock, Shielded Underarmor plans, etc. 
---
Threw in some outfits that seemed to sell pretty well (Nuka World Outfits, Shielded Underarmor)
---
Then started selling popular ammo like .556 and .45. 
---
Then tossed in decent legendary drops once I hit the scrip limit. 
---
I‚Äôm just a general store now.
---
Taxes? We don't pay no stinking taxes..
---
I'd be more inclined to run up multiple characters if you could trade crafted legendaries between your characters.
---
That‚Äôs a brilliant tip, it always feels out of my way to go to camden park everyday. I‚Äôm using this henceforth!
---
Oh well then :(
---
Ah, right, fair point there. XB1 here anyway.
---
Still, would love some pics!
---
Then again I could be completely wrong because they have made a slew of mistakes
---
awesome stuff, thank you!
---
Yeah, and maybe remastered Mass Effect September 29 (in the UK anyway).
---
it just always bothered me since f4, my character has third degree burns cause of all the brass being thrown into her face
---
I mean there's a perk card called "Serendipity" that has a 45% chance of dodging all damage. Yes, this also includes Fall Damage too. That or 'Goat Hoofs' that reduces fall damage.
---
I'd like a bit more information on what you're talking about here, cause it sounds like you're asking if there is Fall Damage in Fallout 76 or something else....???
---
I will when it is post patch. This one took me 10 hours straight, so I wil need another lazy m onday
---
Pulling a r/forhonor and say they will leave, but won't.
---
My main is a bloodied stealth rifleman and my new alt is a bloodied unarmed because it wanted to run a completely diff play style and now it looks like BOTH of my characters are getting screwed by these changes. 
---
I can‚Äôt think of a single game that I enjoyed having bullet sponge enemies and I‚Äôm not looking forward to it here either. Between all of the RNG grinding/daily limits and now what will end up being an ammo and resource grind, I feel like Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt want me to play this game at all anymore.
---
 I then ate 12.
---
Then there was more than a quiver
---
You mean that patch only available on PC so it does not help ANYONE on console with even game halting issues like unaccessibale areas that are mandatory for the progression of the game?
---
That Patch. Hey thanks for the update.
---
It usually 20-25 caps per 1 scrip
---
Those are coming, currently planned for Update 22, and are available in the PTS.
---
youre looking to 1 shot and thats your problem. I run a prime executioners gatling plasma. works great as long as I've got the heavy gunner perks equipped. when choosing a weapon like that you need to look at rate of fire as well as dmg
---
That would help , but it‚Äôs still ez with a friend or fo1st
---
It may come in handy once the next big update comes since enemies will be higher level all across the board, though I can't really say much about it because I haven't been in the PTS myself but it's definitely a good full HP build to consider. I main bloodied but also have an alt with a similar build, in my case it's not a commando but a heavy, using a VE90 gatling plasma with full vanguard gear, not quite the same but that's the idea. Also, the way vampire weapons work is that you get a fixed amount of health back per hit, so fast firing weapons benefit much more (perfect for a commando), but I could be wrong on that.
---
but the pipboy is on the left hand, the right hand uses pipboy controls
---
I want the ability to free any "slaves" at someone's camp.
---
Yep, they nerfed all damage. But!
---
Carbine is OP - nerf - carbine is still playable.
---
Machinegun is OP - nerf - machinegun is still playable.
---
Pistol is playable - nerf - pistol isn't playable :(
---
Share pics, that sounds awesome. They said in patch notes they fixed. Damn. Well I'm xbox so maybe still doable.
---
So make every build do 1k smh per bullet like bloodied?
---
Blood washed combat armor paint
---
It will certainly be rotated back again.
---
Always one of you in the batch. Like corn in my shit.

---
 &gt; &gt; And I thought ounce of prevention was supposed to be fixed? Did I miss something?
---
 &gt;
---
 &gt;Yes that was the plan, unfortunately we found that there was more...
---
More of a mystery to solve than an actual side quest. 
---
And it's server wide, so if anyone else does it first you can't complete it on that server ... until it resets, one day, eventually.
---
About 50% of the time I find Ward backwards in his chair. Then he won't give me a mission and just stares at me.
---
My question was do insects in real life  ‚Äútake fall damage‚Äù
---
I know this is a fallout thread but the fall damage aspect made me think of this group and I‚Äôm new so I don‚Äôt have any groups to put this in
---
I have seen them in people's camps too..... I make sure to clean them out and go dump the rounds where no one can get them.
---
I sell a bit of everything. From camp plans to mutation serums. You'd say recipes don't sell but make them 5 caps and they're gone xD I sell pretty rare outfits and plans, the problem is that a lot of people have a large amount of plans (saw 1000+) that are some really common shit like mole miner gauntlet or ultracite and they have 30+ pieces of each, but the camp still counts the amount of plans. So a lot of people seeing a higher amount of plans (100+) will think you have the same shitty stock as those people. So to attract customers I put other stuff like ammo, guns, outfits, meds, bobbleheads, etc and it actually works. So far I've sold the most of plans and outfits, some misc stuff.
---
I know it will Eventually be but it‚Äôs quite a rare thing to come back
---
GULP!
---
Yes. Please add chips as a new grindable currency!
---
Still isn‚Äôt fixed. Let me in I wanna teach Rocco some manners
---
Rifle and melee isn't playable anymore either, and early game machine guns are going to be a pain in the ass due to how much more ammo its going to take!
---
She‚Äôs the Tightest slot machine in all the Wasteland.
---
21 is the current patch for August?
---
That hasn‚Äôt been my experience, but I know that 76 is very weird like that.
---
There should be something (worth) to spend caps on
---
Wow
---
fractured steel in winter
---
No, but it didn't always work to begin with. Sometimes you throw it and it never explodes.
---
Mostly for accuracy, instant fire and DPS
---
Thanks for the communication.
---
Pretty sure it's skewed. That's something that's locked away in the exe or server-side AFAIK. It should work the same way the mystery pick at the end of Fasnacht did, so use those results to get an idea of how this will drop.
---
Reset is in like 15 minutes. It'll hopefully come back round
---
I spent ages in the first couple of weeks after launch trying to figure them out. Was so stoked when I figured it out and got the Nuka-Cola T-51b paint. Had to use the Google for the X-01 skin.
---
Like a Ford Bronco or what?
---
But she doesn't see the stealth/vats/bloodied/melee builds popping drugs and about to do several thousand damage in one hit. To add salt in the wound, sometimes a player brings a cryolater as well.
---
impressive. No clue what you are talking about but I'm impressed none the less. In the world of fallout it will be interesting to see what you come up with next. Just don't go too crazy and create something that ends up killing all of us.
---
I am actually not, just looking to improve.  Poor choice of wording on my part but after reading a lot of great and informative responses I think I have things better understood.
---
Awesome thanks for the info! The events are tough but with a team I usually follow them and try to tag everything. Sorta works for xp.
---
This logic always makes me laugh. 'They have so much of X resource, it lags the server when they log in!'
---
It's a number in a piece of code. It's not like by this person logging in, it creates 2,000 connections to the server simultaneously. It loads their profile into the database *once* and that's it. 
---
When you have dozens of ammo factories running, that's different. That's a continually changing game aspect that needs to be refreshed. But a player having huge resource quantities? It might stutter the server a bit on login, but once that initial slowdown has finished, that's all you'd see.
---
They lied about the limitations on stash capacity because they wanted to sell Fallout 1st memberships to people, plain and simple. They artificially capped the amount of inventory you could hold, then put a partial 'unlock' behind a paywall. 
---
And I bet it's not the last time you see this. I would bet dollars to donuts that sometime in the near future, they'll offer a similar 'upgrade' for a nominal fee to expand your normal inventory as well, at certain price points. Want an extra 200 units added to your stash? $5.99 a month. Want 1000? We'll give you a deal at $20.00 per month! What a steal!
---
Mark my words.
---
I‚Äôm counting on it , Would i be a pain to ask when the reset happens what the new items are ?
---
&gt; And I thought ounce of prevention was supposed to be fixed? Did I miss something?
---
Yes that was the plan, unfortunately we found that there was more to the bug than initially thought. As a result, the fix we had ready didn't wind up completely addressing the issue, and so we're continuing to work on it. 
---
We still want to get that quest fixed ASAP, and we will get that fix to you as soon as we're sure the issue is fully resolved.
---
It only seems to work sometimes. Other times it does what you saw.
---
Yeah I'd love to see a similar system replace most of the grind. Remove the caps for bullion and scrip etc. Boom the game is 10/10 more enjoyable and players wont feel ripped off when grinding. It's really not that hard. Hell you could even near infinitely expand the rep grind by having hundreds of shades and patterns and it would cost almost nothing man power wise.
---
Nice, sounds like what I‚Äôm workin towards.  High quality merchandise for a nice price.
---
Some folks like to share, some don't. It's reasonable to assume that anything left open is fair game, and with the converter every ammo type is usable, so I'll scoop up every round I can find. I just figured some people might not be aware that they aren't actually protecting their stash and I wanted to support the players who aren't exploiting/duping ammo.
---
Actually that was still a thing around a week ago. People reported people buying out their vending machines then snagging all the stuff in their stash. I purposefully put a 30k item in each vendor to combat it. If there's a team of them doing it, I guess I'm just fucked
---
There was some cut content hinting at a fourth one but never implemented - a couple of breadcrumbs in the form of notes. The Whitespring Cabins were to be used for a cut quest (Room Service IIRC) that‚Äôs on the wiki. I‚Äôd be more intrigued if they actually did something with those terminal entries in the Investjgators Cabin.
---
Having to use 3 extra bullets won't force you to grind ammo. Considering ammo factory is coming, and enemies will drop ammo for the gun you're using, you'll be fine.
---
You NEVER farm meds in this game. Ever.
---
I get 200+ stimpaks within 2 days just by doing random activities, I have to sell them because they take up space.
---
Unless you're using a flamer or those weak durability heavy guns, repairing is never an issue, especially since repair kits are easy as shit to accrue.
---
Yea happens with the lever action rifle too
---
Reset is at 5pm. I'll tell ya what they are live. It's 4:50pm atm so very soon
---
Okay, sounds good to me, thank you!
---
I got an offer for 45 thousand caps for mine. It's stupidly rare, and they are required for calibrated shocks on Strangler Heart so they're sought after.
---
Sometimes people dump legendaries there for others to find.
---
Ok , Thanks I‚Äôll keep my notifications on to await your answer
---
Anyone else a bit disappointed by the Cursed Weapons or is it just me?  Not a fan of the Harpoon Gun or both those melee weapons.  Also such a missed opportunity to not have a Cursed Railway Rifle.  It fits the theme much more than a Harpoon Gun.
---
Fair enough. I would share if I didn't need it myself and if I didn't know that a lot of people will take it to just sell.. This is why joining people in private teams and bypass all locks is good.
---
yeah she dont know about this furious anti armor executioners cult dagger.
---
I have recorded bugs in the past, I'm so used to it now that I don't bother wasting hard drive space. I'm not really trying to prove anything with this post I was mostly just wondering if this is a known issue so someone could tell me how to get actual railway spikes. I'm not wasting anymore ammo points.
---
The bigger issue is all the time you spent getting that gear for your sniper, now beeing useless and tbh, the part of the time you just spent grinding was wasted.
---
I'm bloody build and when I go into events, I take so much rad away that my damage is not even noticable. But I have experienced others just killing legendaries without letting others get a hit not being bloodied build. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Guess it just depends on the person, not the build.
---
Very legendary,in that case.and I mean the grind not the perk.
---
Communism comrade
---
Most people want those plans for Strangler Heart, which is not tradable.
---
Must be one of the most requested features, should have been in the game at beta, it‚Äôs as if they did zero in house testing on actually playing the game before release.
---
I would argue that last point. The other night, I couldn't connect to a different server for love or money. Tried a dozen times, always came back to the same one.
---
Shielded Underarmor... Still trying to get the Shielded Marine plans, but all the others I can craft.
---
I keep underestimating them. The other night I saw a liberator horde event popping up, immediately clicked on it, a low effort legendary for me, right? Wrong. While I was loading in I realized this event took place in the Mire region, which means max level libs, and of **course** I spawned right in the middle of the horde. I went to the respawn prompt before I had my gun out.
---
I can tackle them one by one if I can use something for cover, but if three of them have free line of sight on me, I just melt.
---
I know it's not the correct place to ask, but to answer your question, sort of. 
---
Bugs like all things fall, but their mass is too low to reach a sufficient speed to weight ratio due to air resistance. humans are heavy and go splat, bugs are very light so their terminal velocity (the maximum speed something can fall at with their weight and aerodynamics) isn't fast enough to reach potential airspeed that can cause damage in most cases. So they should be fine, in theory assuming no outside force like windcurrents.
---
Larger bugs like beetles probably splat, i'm not educated on the matter enough to say. Smaller bugs like spiders or ants, not really.
---
this reminds me of that one skit where the guy could sit anywhere
---
Some of the stuff looks cool. The Chinese are literally one of the major reasons the Great War even happened. There‚Äôs at least two secret Chinese bases in Appalachia. It‚Äôs gonna make sense to have Chinese-themed items in game.
---
The going rates are between 15 and 20 caps per scrip so a 3 star weapon is 800 caps.  You will find the 10 per scrip sometimes but sense caps are worthless the prices have inflated.
---
Edit:  These prices are from my experience and what I have seen on the market that shall not be named.  Everyone has a differnt price for their soul.
---
alt + f4 is the key
---
THANK YOU
---
Yup!  
---
So that we can make interior rooms in our CAMPs, and not just a box, or have a mismatched wall(s) inside.
---
Because dictatorship of the proletariat isn't an idea, *it is truth*.
---
Oh, are they fixing those two??
---
Only reason to use vats with a shootgun is magic damage but i highly dubt thats the rcase here...
---
Ur using Vats with a Tesla too? lol
---
Notice how Cursed Weapons are becoming more and more prevalent? So we will have to $buy$ More and More Repair Kits!
---
The new daily ops have enemies that drop dozens of rounds of whatever you hit them with, so as long as you can collect the ammo off of them before you end the op you end up with more ammo than you came in with.
---
You can also repeat the op as much as you want, and it awards ammo and materials at the end too.
---
Are you on PC?
---
I using a Pipe Revolver Rifle as my main weapon from level 1 to now level 560. From all ranged weapons the pipe weapons will get the hardest nerf from the recent changes on PTS.
---
With all Gunslinger and Rifleman perks, Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction mutation a Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle currently does 3200 damage on a sneak headshot. That is good damage, but you have to pay for it with your perk slots leaving less space for defensive or quality of life perks.
---
With the damage calculation changes on PTS this will drop down to 600 damage on a sneak headshot with the same buffs. So we are talking about 80% less damage. With this big damage drop pipe weapons are no longer viable or at least it is not worth to waste so many perk slots on damage cards when you can get the same with other rifles.
---
Yeah it is annoying it's weird sometimes you can't connect to a new one and other times you can
---
really? never noticed, its still a stupid bug :(
---
I think so too. Almost all games that takes stuff away that ppl have worked hard for loses players because the trust is broken.  
---
There is a reason games that are very popular like Path of exile even has the devs comming out saying they really would like to nerf stuff but that costs too much playerbase. At one point when they removed some really popular stuff they lost 20% players overnight.
---
What a nightmare... with the rng in this game you have a gnat's chance in hell to get something with properly good legendary affixes. Maybe if you could craft legendaries, but as it is now, that would be gruesome.
---
PC servers are still down for maintenance, consoles are getting it later this week
---
PC servers are currently down, so... i assume you gotta wait a bit
---
No. Whever server maintenance ends its up but impossible to know when that will be.
---
I get that. Wasnt Russia involved too? Is there a way to tell their styles apart? Or is Russia really not prevalent in the lore?
---
Only the owner can change parameters, so it's worthless to lock it
---
Getting the Gold Bullion plans on multiple characters is seriously not fun.  As if maxing out faction reputation on one character wasn‚Äôt bad enough.
---
Season 2 isn't BoS themed, there are just some BoS items in there.
---
Legendary arms and armor dealer
---
maintenance is still in progress but should be available immediately after it ends
---
Oooh. Im mistaken then!
---
A post worth upvoting üëç tired of PSA's telling me really obvious things
---
Thats the price u have to pay running around just in ur underware... XD
---
Available now in the "Perk Loadout Manager" on nexusmods.com.  Or wait 'till winter.  I use this many times each day to select loadouts for battle, armor work, weapon work, construction, and lock/terminal picking.
---
FYI - you will see posts about it on here. That's not something people would forget to post about.
---
I like survival games plus fits the theme , nice pre war weapons should be rare treasures that slowly get used up.  We should be able to craft legendary pipe weapons only. Hundreds of years past a nuclear war there should be less and less pre war tech
---
I'm surprised people keep bringing this up. I thought the choice was obvious - it's more readable to have the animations in the centre of the screen and fewer animations are required to get the job done.
---
If you did everything real world accurate, there would be more animations required, more modelling (you need to show more of the right arm during a reload) and it wouldn't look as clean because the weapons has to move left to show the right side of the weapon to show the reload animation and then swing back right to its starting position.
---
Doing it the way it is now is just the cleaner, more efficient way of doing it.
---
The Ultracite Calibrated shock plan is very rare as others have noted. I know the plan and I believe I still have one or two plans that I have been holding onto to use as trade. 
---
I play on XBOX and my GT is GreedyNewt972, I am looking for a few rare outfits, fixers or handmades and other rare plans if you are interested in trading. I would probably also be willing to modify yours for you in exchange for some materials or ammo if I am not too busy grinding out score.
---
I always stay on the cooking spit and cook some stuff that I drop for peeps at the end. Not much of a participation but at least I give free food out for those whose work I benefit from :)
---
I can fully understand you. I always annoy me
---
Perhaps you confused your progress with the progress of the villain (I don't remember the his name.) There are two ships on the board.
---
This event confuses me. Is there a limit on how many players can join the event? If it‚Äôs a limited amount of players allowed then how is it decided who gets to join the event? If I launch the nuke will I automatically get a slot or is it a free for all on who clicks join fastest?
---
the only capitalist that can be trusted is a dead capitalist
---
Yes, we are on PC
---
Pros - 
---
More xp (but actually less because it will take more time killing enemies on farming routes.)
---
Region based spawns equal to player level. (This is pretty good.)
---
Other crap
---
No more one shotting (this is good, but with how boss health and overall damage resistance works in this game there isn't a strong foundation supporting extended fights on fo76.)
---
Cons - 
---
The damage nerf shits on every type and even though bloodied is hit hardest, it will still be the best. Now every other build will just be more useless.
---
Quad harpoon gun is great with the flachette mod, decent damage and essentially unlimited ammo.
---
A 1 to 3 star legendary. 
---
*Really?* After all of the community feedback about how much it sucks to pull a 1* lead pipe from the SBQ?
---
JFC.
---
The que to download the update happens at 10am EST usually. Beyond that, we never really know when Beth is finished with the update and turns the servers back on until they are back on. I am on Steam and I think my update was around 28Mb. The vast majority of the update was in patch 21.
---
Hmm I have to look into this
---
It was really just between the US and China. The Russians were kinda just there in the background, like the UK.
---
Did the camo secret service underarmor get fixed so it can be shielded? Is there an ETA for this?
---
5 and 10 caps for all plans, fusion and plasma cores for 30 caps, popular/useful 3 star weapons and armor for under 1k, items only suitable for scrip turn in 30 caps per star.  Flux at market price (like seafood).
---
Is anyone else's Vital Communication bugged? every day its says   
---
Talk To Ward   
---
Return Item to Ward   
---
and I never have to go an retrieve said item, just free scrip and treasury notes every single day.
---
I'm out of the loop - what is this about removing /reducing detrimental effects from hunger/thirst? Why even bother having hunger/thirst then?
---
def, need the BOS officer uniform plans for this.  Was disappointed to learn I can't sell SS underarmor or Chinese Stealth Suits/Helmets.
---
&gt; pray that their sleeves roll down when they wash their dishes.
---
You're a goddamn monster.
---
Why would i waste three perk points for that? Food is literally everywere in this game... why do you think they call it "Foodbuild 76"?
---
This
---
Honestly the lower levels is the hardest part, imo. If you have gear you can offload to your characters then I suggest leveling them all the way to 1000 before you should a new one.
---
Since all exp required between 100-1000 is the same but 1000+ is x10 the amount.
---
I think at this point I'm not even going to bother with them. :c
---
Maybe Season3 will be BoS themed. Season2 is a Fallout version of G.I. Joe.
---
I have an alt still selling scrip from Fasnacht. So many drops.
---
It needs a buff if the new damage calculation that is currently tested on PTS goes live without changes. With all Gunslinger and Rifleman perks, Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage and  Adrenal Reaction mutation a Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle currently does  3200 damage on a sneak headshot. After the change it will be 600 damage max, so we are talking about 80% less damage.
---
This will help me bury that corpse in the north.
---
I think you missed my point while this is a good idea that could make the event last longer true but that might also piss people off who don't want unnesscary limits and repeatable xp is the only way for people who don't want to spend real money to be able to compete with and finish legendary run quicker as the people who buy their way through event so if you remove repeatable xp then you have to remove the option to unlock rewards with real money too also.
---
So once again this doesn't solve what i actually have an issue with. My point and only issue is with what happens once we're done with the legendary run and my solution is alot easier and more reasonable for everyone. After one is done with the run they can't keep giving us useless score as rewards for daily and weekly challenges they have to change the rewards back to normal or allow for the score to be used and turned in for rewards like currency.
---
I think it is because we aren't all on the same server and because of this it is extremely difficult to set up without increasing lag.
---
I'm about to send u a stealthy bloody build perk load out and a few clips of the damage outputs running thru west tech and the Bolton green golf club
---
The massive stack is currently about 375 lvl up points + 20 perk packs,and I never made a rescpec. That's not even enough to max 2 cards. Ridiculous.
---
Oh, okay.!
---
I think it would make more sense to allow each player to put one item up for sale at a white springs vendor on a consignment basis.  Perhaps these weapons could remain online on multiple servers while the player is not online.  not sure if that's feasible numbers-wise but I've always wanted a way to leave my most valuable items for sale available while I'm not playing.
---
How can you even play without marsupial in the first place, thats the first thing i got on all my chars after lvl 31
---
I have said this before.  After all, the Greenbrier Resort (Whitespring)  has the  only private Casino in the U.S., so why not put one in the Whitespring in the game?
---
XD
---
I've heard that it's permanent, even if you move your camp it won't be there anymore but it will still eat up the budget.
---
Have you seen the damage numbers ppl are posting?
---
3 extra is a tad low.
---
I never said repairing is an issue. You'll do it more that's all.
---
But this change will be fine for you if you play so much.  100 packs a day means you play like a job.
---
I‚Äôve tried selling for 25 caps and the only things that sell at that price are the lightest weapons first.
---
Oh I understand. I only just started playing in May, but my friends have been playing longer. It‚Äôs all they talk about
---
Seems like you haven‚Äôt played much since fasnacht then ;)
---
It doesn't work that way. Unless you play with friends, there are no people taking turns. If you are collecting, you are effectively punished by not getting any experience at all. Particularly in Radiation Rumble, defending the  workers is best suited to PA Heavy builds, while picking the ore is best suited to 1000rad-resistant-suit users. This is the most efficient way of completing the event, I'm not saying that PA users can't get ores and stealth kllers can't kill zombies. I'm talking pure efficiency. In this context, the defenders get everything and the collectors only get a fraction of the exp. It's not fair.
---
Provided this works the way it used to, what you do is:  
---
1. Place down a doorway on one side of a tile,   
---
2. Walk to the other side and place down a doorway on that side,  
---
3.a They're now facing back to back. (or exterior side to exterior side)  
---
3.b Now, select the doorways and change them to walls.  
---
4. You now have the beginning to an interior room for Sophia.
---
Honestly as a PC player I'm not incredibly excited about having my playing experience used as a beta test.  If it's not ready to implement across-the-board than just don't implement it and leave it on the test server.
---
wow, who'd have thought.
---
that's a capital /S, by the way.
---
Funny is the red star in Overseer's house, that makes me suspicious of her real interests.
---
Capitalism is the disease
---
I've never seen a MK V before. I may have to go hunt down a high level liberator horde and see what they are made of. I run a bloodied power armor heavy weapons build, and I'm damn near invulnerable to anything that doesn't do poison damage.
---
I have a resting level of skepticism about this game in general and it seems to spike every time anything gets changed at all.
---
Ark's building system may be versatile but it's really flawed aswell, Conan Exiles has better building imo
---
Probably because the ammo factory is the only one that works, i've tried doing with the food factory and other stuffs but it doesn't work
---
Yes prime meat spoiles but not so fast you couldnt use it at the actual event.
---
And even u manage to get it spoiled there is no shortage of it. The game literally spits it in ur face all the time...
---
Radiation is a hell of a drug
---
The shotgun shells are flying right into our players faces everyime we shoot. wtf bethesda.
---
I may have to check it out as soon as the game goes back online
---
You know what?   I don't need the gd atoms that badly, and I did all the "kill robots" challenges except the barehanded one.   Yes, I am sick of the bugs.
---
I'm suspicious of all of Vault tech to be honest, as we should be.
---
Yep, it's the very concept of daily limit that everyone hates for good reason. What kind of game punishes you for playing it?
---
Unless you're like shit in your corn. Like people who fuck up server stability.
---
Nocturnal rolling pin 99% chance, with love, Bethesda
---
I see people doing that trick too. However, the people who clear out your stash are the same people who duped presents, and thus have a relatively infinite supply of caps on hand. I know someone that had 60,000+ caps worth of items bought by one person in under a min.
---
I would remove and block such "friend" and maybe report them if I don't know them personally or for a long time. You will never get rid of this unless you submit a ticket and even then there's a chance they won't believe/care it wasn't you who did this and punish you somehow. Even if you move the camp the item will disappear but still take your budget. That friend of yours couldn't NOT know this.
---
Same here.   I've given up.
---
They're promising A LOT with the next patch.  Bethesda is having trouble releasing simple patches and fixes on time, I have very little confidence everything planned will release on schedule.  The bulk of it will most likely be pushed back and spread out over a number of patches.
---
Honestly I'm fine with them taking extra time to make sure new content is actually playable on release and won't bug out and delete our characters.
---
Bethesda had announced somewhere on the forums they planned to bring the feature back. Think they figured out the bug they were dealing with and want the exploit back in the game asap
---
Can't wait for the initial market on the Reclaimed Helmet! H: Rec Mining Helmet W: Legacy ONLY
---
For sure not that alt. She‚Äôs still grossly overweight.
---
I was responding to a question about playing with friends...
---
Maybe there is another solution to better incentivize ore collection in that specific event. I just don‚Äôt think someone should get xp just because their teammate killed an enemy. That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
---
Well, it is longer than 2 hours now. But take your time please!
---
Left handed bolt gun animations make me ill.
---
Ward the type of NPC to sleep on the top part of the bunk beds
---
You're missing the vault rec engineer paint for the t-series. It was a free set a day about a year ago. Looks like the atomshop blue vault PA skins but olive drab and caution yellow.
---
Oh wow, bonus challenges. Would have been useful for more people 2 weeks ago. More and more people I play with are finishing up in the next few days or finished in the last 2 weeks.
---
But, hey... "we" did "it" guys.
---
I play on PC but thanks for the offer.
---
i believe you still have to go to the ash heap to get the quest to trigger
---
Dude. You're so wrong. On so many levels.
---
Nerf builds OR buff enemies. *NOT BOTH*
---
Not everyone uses a god-damned bloodied build. Some of us have to *work* for every kill. This update is going to screw those of us who don't run bloodied characters.
---
Wonder what the bonus is.
---
What are the tank killer changes?
---
when it's done
---
Alright I‚Äôll keep an eye out! Thank you.
---
We...the richest, and most gullible.
---
End game builds that take 100s of hours shouldnt be equal to builds that take less work.  I agree bloodied shouldn't be this one above all build, but the amount of grinding I've done to get the right mutations, right guns, and right armor can't be pissed on this easy.  There are builds other than bloodied that should get buffed to reward the time it took to achieve them.
---
tank killer now also applies to pistols
---
The Tesla looses its chain effect when its explosive.
---
Yeah but we can turn random raw materials into elaborate structures and decorations for some reason.  however being able to break down ammunition and changing calibers is apparently something we require a machine to do.
---
15c rare chems.
---
1c ammo
---
20c plans
---
You're picking realism faults in a game full of atomic monsters?
---
If that's the case ALL weapons need a buff let alone just the pipe weapons, that sucks
---
So for those of us who finished the legendary run already?
---
you can mod the regular SS underarmor, but  it does not work on the camo version from the Atom Shop
---
which sucks ass
---
LOL!
---
Dang, I tend to find them during the scorched earth event
---
seriously. even the blue ridge stuff was going for like 20k when it came out haha
---
Grabbing my popcorn to see all of those who said "they would never hand over all rewards to us" faces.
---
The biv quest is worth doing, the plans always sell in your vendor. Plus its normally easy to craft I find.
---
Anyway, kudos to you doing all that everyday. The loading itself zaps my energy to do all that nonsense everyday. I long since stopped bothering doing the monotonous settler repeatable quests. And most dailies for that matter.
---
So i dont get 20 Treasury notes everyday, its just not worth the tedium for me.
---
So happy to hear about that.
---
Not many if the legendary perk system doesn‚Äôt change.
---
Non explosive Tesla is way better for pvp...so I‚Äôd go with the be flamer hands down
---
Awe, I'm glad I'm family. Thank you.
---
Yeah I won‚Äôt defend it, but that‚Äôs the state of the game.  I wish they would add more endgame areas that are larger more challenging and offer greater xp than just server hopping the same location over and over.
---
Coming in Patch 22.
---
I hope you liked his huge 5lb ball(s) you can display them üòâ
---
Not to be rude or anything but you should google about it, this has already been widely documented by people playing on the Test Servers.
---
Wow! Nice!!!
---
Finally someone with the guts to say it!
---
Damn u Ward!
---
Ps.
---
If youre playing on PC there is a mod that works perfectely for perk loadouts
---
From the ones in that list which was posted a while ago, Ammo Factory will first out the door and the first to be upgraded fully. The crafting returns from that are just too good not to make use of.
---
The lockpick/hacker one will be next as my build only has 1 point in perception (had to sacrifice the stat to get an extra couple of points in agility) and getting that facility back without moving points or needing to upgrade will suffice for me. The radiation one will likely be the 3rd pick and 2nd to be upgraded. I can see that one being very useful to full health builds, though probably somewhat useless to low health builds.
---
When is it available?
---
12 loadouts, just like what I already have now. Unless Bethesda is going to make it less than what the mod does.
---
Yeah I seen a couple spots about that. So do you know how much the first rank is? I saw angry turtle talk about the second rank was like a hundred points and the third was 150? That is nuts. I think I might just get the ammo one with whatever I can scrounge up maybe the first rank. and that's it
---
Zero. I only ever had to change out two cards - Ammosmith and Super Duper. On occasion lockpick/hacker - but I usually just ignore that stuff unless it's needed for a quest. The loadout will save me a few seconds at most. I can see where it's useful, but not so much to me.
---
Coincidentally the average quiver can hold up to a total of 12 arrows. However there are some made for more of course.
---
atomic monsters that are hypothetically science realism. it has a chance at becoming real. and yes. because as a person whose grown up around guns, media and video games filled with guns. it make me ill seeing everything like that
---
no one ps4 sad face
---
Thank God. I lost so much sleep over this... I'm so glad they fixed that before those other bugs that don't matter.
---
Well damn it seems like you're in a good spot with your build out.
---
100 for first, then 150 and 200.
---
flip the modles back to the original position and make the reload animations mirrored, and boom you have the correct way everything should be
---
&gt; Settler Forager: Players can now correctly receive Daily Quests from the Settler Forager Ally.
---
Wasn't this supposed to be in the last update?
---
The red star on the overseers house isn‚Äôt communist. It‚Äôs known as a Primitive Star. In German heritage it thought to bring good luck similar to a horse shoe. It‚Äôs also believed to ward off evil. All this makes sense considering her house near Helvetia.
---
you arent creating any new animations if the animations are already there
---
Ty for updating, I saw that but thought it was an atom store thing.
---
How do you equip it anyways....
---
[it‚Äôs just classic Americana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar)
---
Does it have an xp award for completing it?
---
I don¬¥t believe this one bit. This is staged.
---
Hmmm. I still dont want to claim it even...
---
Glad to see Bethesda taking the Monkey's Paw approach to game development.
---
Have you seen gameplay, where killing the sheepsquatch takes like .4 extra seconds compared to live?
---
Well you said you'd be farming more materials, but you won't.
---
I don't think you know how easy it is to accrue stimpaks. 100 packs a day is nothing, if you dedicated a farm to them you'd get a lot more, but that's pointless because stimpaks replenish so much HP, and you have stuff like healing factor/food so you can just not use stims.
---
u/valseek
---
Any news on this?
---
U mean get more weight, right, as my 560 carry weight says (pepperoni rolls ftw)
---
The nerf is in damage calculation. Instead of modifiers multiplying the base stats and your stats, it adds on to the original values.
---
So, instead of perk cards and your Strength special multiplying your damage output, you may see a nerf to your damage output anywhere in the range of 25% to 50%.
---
This is what has made most high DPS builds unviable. Melee was only barely viable before this announcement, and now its going to be bottom-tier along with pistols and unarmed. The only way melee worked was to have mods that increased your swing speed, turning a slow super sledge into a medium-speed weapon.
---
Majorly gutsy?
---
It was but it was free to all players as long as you claimed it.
---
Bunker bundle with a commie bunker, fences and a safe

---
I keep my mini camp  on a little island near the General's, where a lone raider spawns. Raider theme, of course. He really seems to enjoy living there, sleeping, grilling, hanging out in the throne. When the muties attack he helps defend the homestead. Great guy. I'm sure there's no reason they sent him out of Crater or anything.
---
Probably looks like ass since you didn't post a picture.
---
I never buy skins. Just use the standard ones. Its just another layer of bugs.
---
well i dont exactly try to justify it, im just saying as long as im not entertained by enough content and material like wastelanders (witch btw was very short) I'm obliged to use the exploits to have as much fun as possible
---
exactly, we probably have plastic cuts on our faces because of it
---
Nice thanks for explanation
---
Yeah.  I'm leaning on misremembering lol.  But you know how this game is...
---
Thanks for responding.
---
I promise you a bullet hits just as hard whether it comes out of a pipe or a fancy pipe (a gun)
---
We‚Äôve fixed a bug where if you I kill a squirrel at midnight with buffout and whiskey while at 230 carry weight you will disconnect /s
---
Dick move? Yes. But Bethesda is to blame for such a lame way to distribute loot in events
---
Too bad for you mate, luckily, there's an ammo machine from the raiders you could take advantage off without exploiting the game, you should try that
---
We're whalers on the moon, we carry our harpoons...
---
Aww, that sucks, should really be in the game with no need for a mod (or bethesda should add mod support for console)
---
Holy crap. So just to max out one that's 450 levels? Good night. I am only level 160 and I started saving up my perk points and card packs.   I think I have 36 perk points and 5 card packs? Damn so I can't even get one rank yet. I am happy where my build is st but FN F thats s lot
---
I'm on Xbox, and crash at least once per play session.  Sunday, I had time to play for a couple of hours and crashed 5 times.
---
This was a pretty big bug
---
What? 20?
---
Good to know as I am not american. Thanks.
---
indeed, makes me ill too
---
BE flamer. TSE breaks waaayy too fast. legacy Teslas are kinda dumb, the explosive overrides the arcing function that makes Teslas useful.
---
YES YES YES !! The commies return !!
---
They're all super cool imo
---
&gt; **PC (Microsoft Store):** 1.3.3.31 (1.65 GB) 
---
Why are our patches so much bigger...?
---
Only on PC
---
that's a /$ from me
---
goddam commies
---
I don't really know much about guns, but playing a game like Fallout 76 and then playing a game like Last of Us 2, it's pretty easy to see which one takes its guns seriously and has accurate weaponry usage. Even something as simple as modifying a gun has a whole set of animations where you disassemble the weapon and put the new piece on. None of this interferes with gameplay at all and it makes the game much more immersive even for someone who doesn't know guns. Like many things, Bethesda takes a 'good enough' approach to it that minimizes the number of unique animations they have to create. Very little of this has to do with gameplay and more to do with saving money, hence why weapons that should be unique end up just skins with the total wrong animations for that weapon.
---
I just use all my plastic. Well time to equip the scrapper and go on a super mutant genocide
---
Ever since i saw that leaked i needed it , Woo i am happy
---
Pc only?
---
Yep, how are they going to redeem players for switching Special points and lost perk card when opening perk card pack due to duplicate card. I personally will lose more than 200 points as it is now in the PTS.
---
Must have PLUSHIE
---
Yeah and that's why OP said because of the incoming nerf. Those things won't stack like that anymore
---
Looks like just a visual bug.
---
Not true actually.
---
You are complaining that the bonus week wasn't necessary?
---
Best place and majority of theses are underground and you won‚Äôt even know it.
---
I dont know how
---
You get 2 points per card. So you can upgrade 1 perk.
---
Anytimeüëç
---
Typically a meme, but is a mostly viable answer here. Would still be nice to have a menu option though.
---
Be flamer, infinite range and two shot makes any weapon break a lot faster
---
I've looked around a bit, and I see numbers provided by players in this post and others. I assume the player numbers come from turning on the damage indicators in-game. I have not seen any patch notes or mentions from Bethesda that they were nerfing the damage, only that the One Wasteland patch is going to scale the enemies according to player level, within reason (min/max level scaling based on area, if I recall correctly). That's why I asked, all I've seen is either anecdotal evidence or feedback from PTS, which I tend to take with a big grain of salt given this sub's tendency to make mountains out of mole hills.
---
go to the atoms shop under camp skins and choose it. then you need to replace your camp for it to change
---
also not to pick your argument apart, but bethesda chose to make two games, and by your explanation they just "half assed" the guns and animation for "efficiency" which wouldnt even be an argument because if the animations clearly show double feeding or no round being loaded in the chamber at all, it not "efficient" its "lazy."
---
edit: this was a reply to punda
---
Guess Junkies still better
---
O.   Better news but still...
---
Hey, me too. 
---
Do we know if there‚Äôs a way to fix this?
---
A friend of mine has the xbox one fat and when he looks at factories like this his xbox starts screaming lol 
---
I never had a problem too but i use the xbox one x so...
---
Hamburgers?
---
I need some clarification on this. I would never grief anyone in this game. That being said I found a Nazi symbol at someone's camp and I thought "Now is the time!" I dug out that explosive bait and was disappointed, as it did nothing. So I dragged over scorch beast ( took way to long ) and that did the trick.
---
Then you have one of two outcomes (unless I'm just misunderstanding):
---
1. Weapon travels all the way to the left of the screen to reload then all the way back to the right to the starting position, showing pretty much all of the forearm of the right (something new that needs to be added) just to be accurate, or
---
2. You're using a right handed weapon and reloading correctly but shooting from the left hand side of the screen the whole time.
---
1 just proved my case as to why things are the way they are now - more efficient, less work.
---
2 is just weird for a right hand dominated world. Never going to fly.
---
...
---
No. *Colonely* gutsy
---
They told us they were going to put this back and that it was an unintended fix.
---
Man it would nice if the little things that impact nothing like SS Mods and accessing essential areas for story progress could have been released on consoles today.
---
But hey let's test this on PC since we don't have a mechanism to do that.
---
If only there was a test server the public could use to test things..maybe a Publice Test Server. Nah that is a stupid idea.
---
I'm glad tank killer will apply to my pistols, but the slow fire rate of my Revolvers plus the Vats glitch of 4 of 6 shots not doing damage won't help much. My BE Western does 800 or so, but most likely will go down to 400 to then make it completely irrelevant in fights. The high damage barely made it effective, but with the Bats glitch it isn't at all. Pair that with the horrendous balance and I'll have a useless level 175 character.
---
yeah, all the changes are for PC today and then soon for the rest. i thought that was what a PTS was for...
---
sitting on a rad barrel is a great way to toast your buns
---
What do you expect? A cookie?
---
Ultracite is garbage when put up against t65 anyway. 9 times out of 10 anyway, im sure people apply a skin to the armor anyway.
---
Replace camp as in move it, or replace camp as in pick it up in build menu?
---
Telling by the way Russian characters act in the Fallout universe there appears to be at least a positive attitude to each other.
---
Nah it doesn't stack like that with the change
---
right? i guess i was the easiest?
---
There is an overarching theme in most/all of the Fallout games that the Great War was not necessarily the 'good' USSA against the 'evil' Chinese Communists.  I mean, any of the average American nobodies (i.e., anyone who wasn't part of the Enclave inner circle or part of an organized group like the BOS) that somehow weren't totally annihilated by the nuclear exchange were forced to survive pretty much alone in a nightmare world of starvation, radstorms, and rad-monsters.  So, yeah, you could say that the Commie Chinese are 'bad guys' who reduced most of America to a glowing heap of rubble.
---
On the other hand, we also know that the majority of the responsibility for starting the Great War (and the ensuing nuclear holocaust) lay with the hawkishness, apocalyptic fantasies, and barely-hidden fascism of the USSA's leadership.  And in the post-apocalyptic world, the same forces continue to operate, albeit in a fractured, generally disorganized fashion.  In that light, Communism doesn't seem nearly as bad.

most of it is whatever, except for the left hand bolt. it has to be the WORST feeling single action weapon i have ever used in any game ever.
---
the way is breaks line of sight, and pulls the rifle up, its not only cumbersome and very jarring,. but it seems like even more work to animate than a regular right hand bolt.
---
Why tho, steel is everywhere....

With Bethesda you could expect nothing and still be disappointed

Only fixed on PC can still do camp exploit in Console. Now that EVERYONE knows let the lag on Console servers grow!

I'm complaining that it's too little, too late. I'm complaining that they made a whole show with the depositing of junk - whether it's real or not - to "earn" it as a reward when it should have just been given. I'm not complaining that it's necessary. Their use of an already bug-riddled challenge system as the only basis for advancement made it necessary.

Feels more like a Free States/Communist theme than a BoS/Communist one

Guys, I get to make this post next week.
---
And if you have too much stuff in your stash box, you'll lose all of your stuff
---
Good grief is it so hard for them to just, collect ammo as they go along and then go get more when they need it LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?!???
---
Do you use the flamethrower trick? BTW this looks fantastic, will do this with next camp
---
They shouldn't be buffed, but we should be able to fire EVERYTHING from them. Like, 10mm, nukes, arrows, etc. Even fusion cells, and electrocute ourselves.
---
&gt; also not to pick your argument apart 
---
Don't worry, I'm in no danger of that ever happening based on what I've seen so far.
---
They've told us a lot of things, best not to count chickens.  
---
I'm just glad they fixed it, and relatively quickly, too.
---
call of duty has it right, lift the weapon up, pull mag out of the well, place a new mag in the well, tilt the gun to the left insinuating the left hand is holding the gun and pull the charging handle
---
edit: there is no need to have the wepon on the left or push the weapon to the left
---
Lol imagine if there was a perk that enabled VATS that would locked behind a 9 point requirement. Your dumbass would probably think it's OK too. It's ok, new players sure love getting slayed by aimbot according to your logic. Idk how ppl in this sub can be sooooo dumb to not realize obvious imbalance
---
Solid point in the comparison of script to treasures notes. Being the newer currency it seems more thought out and a step in the right direction, so I‚Äôd imagine script goes to a similar path. However seeing how fast things move around here I wouldn‚Äôt expect it before 2021. Of course there will be a glitch from a patch and the machines will be disabled until two patches after that. Maybe 2022.
---
Except it sets a bad precedent to tell players who have done the research to just wait till it‚Äôs live. If everyone did that and it was a clearly flawed fix we‚Äôd be waiting months for it to change. I love Bethesda‚Äôs games, but the devs try hard to not listen when it‚Äôs about something they‚Äôve spent a lot of time on 
---
ie scrapping perk cards for coins and how painstaking it‚Äôs been to get them to improve the system.
---
&gt;lt given this sub's tendency to make mountains out of mole hills.
---
While there can be further changes before it's launched to stable PTS is meant to be the closest to what is going to be launched, so any "level scale" should apply there, and we shouldn't expect things to be too far off.  
---
This isn't a overreaction since people have already correctly reported on nerfs before they happened.  
---
While we have many other issues taking place and some enemies are already unresponsive(do not react) to damage and bullet sponge as it is, nerfing damage  even with scaling shouldn't make things more fun, specially how grindy it can be to produce/find and store bullets.  
---
But well, if you don't want to believe on what's being reported go ahead, I guess we just need to wait and see, though I'm really sure given Bethesda's past history on nerfing guns that this one is def going to happen like it's being reported.
---
Oh crap, it also auto completed 3 of my weekly challenges as well. That... suuuuuuuucks.
---
This mod saved me from the headache of swapping
---
I do a hybrid build so I need different load outs 
---
‚ÄîI have my main which is rifle/shotgun

‚Äî^ same build but switch out some CH perks for vendor
---
‚ÄîI have a rifle/ heavy (for SBQ)

‚ÄîI have a picklock/hacker

‚ÄîI have a scrapper/chemist/duper

‚ÄîI also have a weapon repair/armor repair

This is why I never play when it resets. I quit like 10-15 before and come back 30 mins after dailies reset, so far never had an autocomplete bug, thankfully. I don't think it's the atom shop update, probably there's something wrong with how it resets, because most players affected by this stay online during reset time.
---
And instead you just eventually become a stealth commando... pretty much the same thing.
---
So the damage calculation itself is being redone? I missed the memo, oops.
---
Stacking a bunch of 1.1x modifiers will end up giving a larger bonus than stacking the same number of +10% bonuses, yes. Damage multipliers seems to be part of the cause of "magic weapons" and overly-optimized builds though, right? To me, it sounds like they might be targeting these situations, at least to address the "magic weapon" nuisance.
---
Oh ok cool, thanks!
---
new vegas did it perfect, keeps you aimed as you fire and pull the bolt back
---
Uh oh... nothing about An Ounce of Prevention...
---
All you have to do is bend over, then Bethesda turns up and shoves it in.
---

Large homemade Presents can give you 1000 caps. Duper‚Äôs have thousands of presents. Spend 30k caps, open presents rapidly until you hit 30k caps again, spend 30k caps, repeat.
---
Eh, it‚Äôs not that bad. The small generator method is tedious and uses a lot of mats. Plus, unless you‚Äôre really knowledgeable in building over budget, this will just frustrate the average player. I‚Äôve been able to maintain a 2x max budget camp since before Wastelanders. It‚Äôs actually harder than it sounds and requires a ton of forward thinking about unreleased camp items, wiring everything up properly, and so much more. The lag is minimal, only noticeable a little when everything is loading in.
---
lol okie dokie like home-made's aren't a thing and don't work
---
No a problem that every user experiences every time the server is down must never be addressed.

VE flamer for me.

Check in the top right and see if your at 0/X X being number of dailies.
---
Someone reported it happening but they realized they were getting the points for doing them when they saw that it showed that he didn‚Äôt have any daily‚Äôs completed.
---
"I have no idea why it happened."
---
Literally no one knows what causes it to happen.
---
Perk Loadout Manager is an absolute must. I have no idea how I ever played without it. Most mods come with a detailed description of the installation process.
---
Sorry, my bad then. And you're right, it doesn't make sense at all. What would really make sense is that you get experience per ore turned in. That would also incentivize the completion of the event. It's too much of an exp boosting event lately, and nothing more.
---
No I don't think so. It has nothing to do with your caps. What I'm saying is make him actually useful and work for you. Give him a set inventory to sell and put him at whitespring. I think that would be a great idea for a different type of player vending.
---
I‚Äôd live to see a role for everything.  Rolling pins could get a unique perk that increases food buffs or something.  Rippers, chainsaws, drills, shovels and all the other instant scrip weapons should get something.
---
Well I'm screwed then. So theres basically no protection
---
Yeah, PC servers are down for the update

---
Well it's your fault for playing the game. Don't play and you won't know if they auto-complete. Duh doy.
---
But seriously, why did they think their Atom challenge system was a good idea to use for the only means of gaining SCORE? Don't be in the game at reset or it bugs. Don't play Nuclear Winter and log off or it bugs. Don't think bad thoughts or it bugs. For the game to work more correctly, you have to actually not play it. That's beyond backwards.
---
I hope everyone who got affected by this shit will be compensated somehow, probably not, but I still hope for you, guys, this is frustrating.
---
I'm 45 and using an L20 Instigating pipe revolver rifle because no rifle I've yet found is better--not hunting, not handmade, not combat, not assault. I routinely one-shot L62-73 critters with it.
---
Can't speak to higher-level gameplay but this thing suits just fine right now, and has for 25 levels.
---
How in the fuck?
---
Yeah, but client crash or server crash? Server crashes you‚Äôll get server not responding and then back to the main screen.
---
No problem. I'm looking forward to seeing what it mutters while it collects.
---
I know but I'm trying to see if there is a pattern at all.
---
yes fucking please.  Wasteland whisperer is so damn useless with how rare it is to find tameable pets
---
PC will have the Colossal Problem event, they are patching that in right now. We will be the testing rabbits.
---
Dont die, please.
---
No kidding! Emptied 5k rounds from a final word along with my friend running a (bloodied?) Gatling...failed. queen was down to about a third health and two days of lead farming down the tubes lol
---
On my second account, don't have much in terms of weapons just a railway rifle I found and an ass ton of blueprinted ammo machines to make 5.56 and 10mm to trade
---
I hope we can recruit all the companions to the camp
---
I want the camp to be lively
---
This was probably the least useful of anything I've built and was meant to be more of a science fair than anything... I've built some other questionable (?) stuff:
---
https://www.youtube.com/c/aswiftkickinthejunk/playlists?view_as=subscriber
---
Same! It would be awesome if it collected technical data!
---
Thank you. Yeah 6/9 auto completed. Darn. üòÇ
---
Do you remember what quest you get the prototype from?
---
damn I have horrible timing, the same month I get fallout 76 happens to be the same time an early quest line breaks. hopefully a patch comes soon! great game so far!
---
I wouldn't choose any of those for PvP personally. The best from that list is the BE flamer. TSE is too inaccurate and flamers already break fast without being two shot. Explosive tesla are kind of meh in PvP. Low ammo and no arc so you are better off getting a laser rifle.
---
It's ok, I also spend hours deciding where to put my lamps
---
atom shop update wouldn't explain why it happens the other 6 days of the week
---
As far as damage is concerned, maybe just buff the perforating mag, and grant all revolvers including the pipe revolver a hidden 15% armor pen.
---
Where I'd like to nuke it for everyone üòè
---
I haven't finished it yet, can I get a cookie? :)
---
There is no pattern. Completely random.
---
Fairly sure it's once per day, as far as tiered rewards go. On PTS, there was one daily op, repeatable.
---
I mean, every humanoid you kill drops some weapon, scrap with scrapper perk and you get steel
---
Agreed, changed the way I play the game completely.
---
Now I dont have a build for just 1 type of weapon, I pretty much have a build for anything, and im able to instantly change it.
---
I hope bethesda makes it on the game so console players (and people who dont know about mods, or are too lazy to install them) can get them, because it is truly a game changer(heh)
---
Because they‚Äôre supposed to be low tier, low level/noob weapons. Not everything needs to be as good as the best weapons in the game. Plus, why should a weapon made out of literal pipes, rubber bands, and salvaged pieces of wood be as good as military grade rifles?
---
I already use loadouts (mod)
---
- home
---
- scavenging
---
- dps solo
---
- dps solo, fireproof
---
- dps team, fireproof
---
- utility team
---
- PA, heavy gunner solo
---
- PA, heavy gunner team
---
- animal friend
---
They're basically creating a diagram of it and allowing it to be place in other places
---
Yeah but it wasn't "correctly". Now it's "correctly" fixed. Probably. Maybe.
---
well now that theyve done this, they are free to supercharge rifle damage without balance massive problems
---
oh ok.
---
OK thanks for the information. I am now going to drop something with wendigo on my xbox xD
---
Wow, what trash. Guess I‚Äôll wait until daily ops drop to come back
---
dang, lol. I've been so tired of a full stash box that I was selling 3 star stuff (worth 40 scrip) for like.... 2 caps a scrip
---
I wish I wouldn‚Äôt do it everyday but as I‚Äôve said in other comments, I have an unhealthy obsession about completing everything. 125 platinums is testament to this. But overall this game has got me through the covid situation, I think I‚Äôd be climbing the walls without something to distract me everyday.
---
Maybe I‚Äôll do biv at weekends or extended play sessions if the rewards have value.
---
These rare ultracite plans would have been perfect rewards for the BOS donation missions, even at low drop rates. They really dropped the ball there.
---
The one day I stayed logged in during the daily reset this happens. Not sure if just staying logged out while it reset will work.
---
Standard legendary Tesla for PvP, BE flamer for PvE due to it's weird stealth capabilities
---
Which was great in old Fallouts where you could easily sleep all day and do all your business at night. Not quite as useful when you have no control over the time unless you wanna server hop a bunch, and no way I could tell my friends ‚Äúhey can we server hop, it‚Äôs like 6am here‚Äù haha
---
Can you provide a link to the material that said the nukes would have to be cyclical? 
---
I would certainly hope they thought everything out from a long term perspective, given that in an interview with Metro, Bethesda's VP of Marketing Pete Hines claims support for Fallout 76 will go on 'forever.'
---
As for ending all of Appalachia...what Appalachia?  The Scorched wiped out all human life in the region already.  There isn't really much more that the nukes can do to Appalachia from a human perspective.
---
The difference between inoculation and vaccination is a technical one: Vaccination, introduced by Jenner in 1798, was based upon the use of a mild, attenuated virus (cowpox virus) which produced a local infection at the site of inoculation yet led to a high level of immunity to smallpox. This procedure was called "vaccination" because the material used came from cows (Latin vacca, cow).Inoculation, however, is what was performed in 1782. Smallpox inoculation, or variolation, as it was often called, was carried out by inoculating the smallpox virus itself into the skin.
---
In this case, despite being called an inoculation in the game is actually, technically, a vaccine, as it did not call for injecting the Scorched virus itself but rather factors derived from different animals already exhibiting an immunity.  So yes, we have a vaccine.
---
Though, that aside, I don't even recall actually testing the vaccine to be sure it works and even if it does work, what percentage of people receiving it develop actual immunity.  And as you mentioned, not all vaccines produce permanent immunity so there is definitely room for concern there.
---
You also make a good point that Operation Touchdown took place in January of 2095.  Related dates on various terminals indicate that human life was basically extinct in Appalachia for seven years by the time Vault 76 opened.  That is plenty (more than plenty) of time for the plague to have spread beyond the region, even without the vector of the giant flying doom bats.
---
It's possible that the Scorchbeasts are dependent on something in the local environment (Ultracite?) and that they can't range far from Appalachia for that reason.  The Scorched Plague is clearly related to Ultracite (that's what the pretty green crystals in the Schorched are made of) so it's possible that this would in some way limit the spread of the plague.
---
That all seems optimistic though.  It seems more likely that even if the Scorchbeasts themselves didn't spread, the plague would and would go on to wipe out all human life in North and eventually South America.
---
But...that didn't happen.  For some reason, even with seven years to spread without human intervention, it apparently never made it to The Pitt or Capital Wastelands.  The Raiders who fled the area actually came back.  The very same people.  So even with all that time it didn't spread.  So maybe there was something holding it to this one location?
---
The game was rigged from the start.
---
Perfectly valid points and I agree. All I'm saying is that it makes perfect sense why Bethesda chose to go the way that they did.
---
&gt;Very little of this has to do with gameplay and more to do with saving money, hence why weapons that should be unique end up just skins with the total wrong animations for that weapon. 
---
It's not just saving money (which it certainly is) but also saves on the number of animations required, meaning less hit to your system.
---
Real world accuracy doesn't give them anything by doing so. What does it add to the game? To people who don't know weapons, it's meaningless. To people that do, for some it's bothersome to right a post and discuss but for the rest like myself, I noticed, understood why immediately and then didn't think about it again because it doesn't really matter.
---
For me, this is like someone arguing about how scrapping a fan only gets you a couple of screws when in the real world you should be getting at least a few dozen. It really feels like that level of debate for me. 
---
Maybe not for the anally retentive gun nut, sure. I get that too. All I was saying was that the reason Bethesda went the way they did was self evident - cleaner visually and more efficient to implement.
---
Check the sub, dude. Multiple posts about it in the last 15 minutes.
---
I learned how powerful those little shits can be when I occupied and had to defend the converted munitions factory not too long ago
---
Wow, nice attitude, I was just trying to help. Good luck with your build
---
Days and days between repairs... with multiple hour play sessions each day.
---
It gets so bad, that I either have to leave broken gear on alts to repair or buy broken gear from the train stations so I can complete the SCORE challenges some days.
---
Heavy Guns/Unarmed/Vats sniper builds.
---
I kind of fine that hard to believe.
---
Wren breaks a fraction of the time Ward does. I actually haven't had any problem with her since they superglued her butt to the console. Ward it is a daily struggle.. not if but how many times do I have to restart the conversation to get the quest, then to turn it in again.
---
That doesn't change my point
---
Good policy on the flux ha
---
Cool! I've always wanted to be a rabbit.. ima go check out the new event!  
---
(Level 28)
---
If you thought server lag was bad now! Wait until 34 vendor tents in the same area start to try and load up!
---
That's good but not the point
---
Its about how it performs in the game. 
---
Sniper rifle - slow hitting high dmg per bullet means you normally one shot most things from distance. Cutting that dmg in half means you take much longer with the slow rate of fire and get overwhelmed quickly. Same goes for melee. What normally takes one/two shots to kill, you have to slowly chip away its health with what feels like a bb gun.
---
Faster firing weapons on the other hand, like lmg or commando guns, you are used to spraying everything. Cutting their dmg means you just hold the trigger longer. It doesnt completely neuter your build and playstyle, just farming ammo will be everyday chore. What normaly takes 1-2 seconds to spray and kill, now takes 3-5 seconds to defeat. Major annoyance but not the end of the world.
---
See the difference?
---
"We apologise again for the fault in the ~~subtitles~~ forager quests. Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked, have been sacked."
---
no fireplace secret door?..
---
Yeah. That's what I was alluding to.
---
Do you have an idea why it needed to wait another patch cycle to be implemented?
---
Yeah but... That would require playing the game üò¨
---
This was the reverse for me. I was playing during the roll over.
---
what masks do you have that I could trade for/buy?
---
I love that movie
---
i just find the lack of effort put into the #1 mechanic in the game abysmal, how do they go from the right animations in fallout 3 to completely shift perspectives in 4 and 76
---
edit: it shouldn't be an argument of whats more cost efficient because most if not all of the fixes require a mirror
---
edit 2; i'm not claiming to know how they work or how much it costs for animation, but i'm sure in whatever program they use to create models, textures and animations, there's a button that gives them the option to mirror a selected asset
---
Toxic waste from west tek for 135 rads, or toxic water around crater raiders base for 30 rads. Who wastes their time in water...
---
Tbh never experienced a system like this. Every other online game that has a client will let you sign in but just not find a match/server
---
Man, bethesda is really trying to get us poor recently with all these cool bundles.
---
And also, how the hell do you make an emote for "join my public team"?? thats some hardcore silent film charlie chaplin level of acting, theres already one for "join my team"
---
It's because of how microsoft packages the game because of gamepass users.
---
I like people like you....lol...if your on ps4 I can always help
---
let‚Äôs wait and see
---
or you could just not use them, and use the ones you earned them with. this is endgame.
---
Based on the same amount of evidence as people cancelling their subs.
---
Maybe I should have said players SAYING they cancelled their 1st subs.
---
This sounds like Pokemon... and I'm into it
---
This is so awesome! How did you do this? I once saw a camp where a person sank the chair into stairs that go underground, so you'd have to play that guitar to sink under the texture and then go down the stairs to their hidden floor. That was so cool!
---
Sorry if I sounded rude there, I just can't stand bloodied builds, I'm going to take your advice on not focusing on my build at the start and working towards it.
---
&gt;we shouldn't expect things to be too far off.
---
Fair enough. I haven't taken part in the PTS before (switched to Steam version), so I have no clue how close the PTS has been to what goes live. Only test servers I've played on before were things like Overwatch or PUBG, and what made it to live usually wasn't the same as what was tested in PTS. So I probably have a skewed view on PTS.
---
Not sure why people have an issue with ammo past level 50, I've yet to run out and usually have an excess of ammunition. The ammo converter has only changed excess ammo from being dumped in suitcases, otherwise I was throwing away thousands of rounds a week.
---
I'm not saying I think the reports are liars, but given how the sub reacts to ANY change, I think some of the info is being blown out of proportion. The "mountains and mole hills" point of exaggeration for this sub wasn't aimed just at nerfs that happen. Maybe I'm just a more casual player so these things don't bug me, but especially since Wastelanders,  most of the negative posts related to "game balance" on here have seemed petty or trivial. So what if it takes a few more bullets to kill something, or a Deathclaw is once again going to be a one-hit threat against you?
---
Thanks dude. I won't be able to get on for a while, do we have any new weapons skins or returning skins?
---
they should have made classical ‚Äúushanka‚Äù instead of regular hat for communist outfit
---
I‚Äôm a level 42 and I have literally never fired a pipe weapon once. They seem completely pointless
---
Depends on if people nuke there
---
your methodology seems incorrect or you need to repeat this several more times, your deathclaw numbers are 1/6 on the pts and all reports of the most extreme impacts are ~50% outside of some melee weapons.
---
its like you sneak attacked in live and not in pts
---
I hope there are. More on live server atleast 5 
---
I‚Äôll love grinding dungeon in mmorpg so if they added lots with daily reward for each one it be perfect game
---
Yeah it did had a lot of clipping issues aswell, I will check Conan's, I haven't seen it yet
---
So are those the only 3 items that can be "cursed"? Or can you get that prefix anywhere now?
---
Yeah no kidding..
---
I have 4K treasury notes. Beth please give me more stuff to do with them
---
So the new event doesn‚Äôt drop repair kits? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good or bad. On one hand I have too many. On the other hand I don‚Äôt want to get rid of them if only 1 event in the game drops them.
---
I don't either, yet somehow managed to hit rank 98 last night
---
Im ok with that too. Even if it doesn't work between my characters. I know a few couriers who are always happy to help do transfers. It's trading with the random you meet in game that is the biggest risk.
---
Thx bb
---
....who said that??
---
i've probably blown 100 levels on respecs for fun... The card scrap system will always bug me because of this no matter what. It needs to be ditched, or they need to grant a pack for every 5 levels you are behind on cards. Respecs have no remaining benefit once done.
---
Agreed on both points.
---
Thats why I also suggested an instanced shopping area. Similar idea on what they want to do with instanced camps.
---
They would also be light-weight prefabs. Sort of like Tents. Maybe only have a single vendor but perhaps increased item limit.
---
Most people don't have magic weapons to kill the queen a hundred times a day. And who wants to stop what they are doing to go back to there camp to repair a weapon. There fore more repair kits and more money for a broken game. Does it work Now?
---
he isn't saying they don't work or won't kill someone IRL. they will just be weaker. a pipe is a smoothbore weapon but an actual manufactured gun barrel has rifling that allows for greater penetration, accuracy, and range.
---
Valseek responded to a post about it earlier saying it has been delayed.

A small price to pay for salvation üòÇ
---
Why? Because it's obviously a matter of preference. You don't need to know why, people just have different tastes that's all.
---
I don't get why you keep insisting on proving my point.
---
I think the thing that wasn't made clear (my bad I guess) isn't that I think the way it is should be this way. Just that I understand why it is - it's cleaner in terms of readability and more efficient.
---
damn I haven‚Äôt seen this yet I envy your 5mm
---
commitment? I‚Äôm bloodied, but have a few junkies godrolls, so I occasionally go to a players camp, spend a few hundred caps buying chems, and become a junkie so i can use my fixer for a day. It requires no commitment, I literally turn it on and off at will. And with a full unyielding set, you can pretty much not even feel the debuffs. Just saying, bloodied requires more from the player in regards to maintaining the way they play. Not to mention the constant fear of being one shotted by a blood bug.
---
Lets hope urs never auto complete
---
The emote fell through the shops floor before we could equip it
---
Tse flamers are also super inaccurate

This one comes with a Jetpack too!

But only for power armor, their saving the Secret Service ones for later.

Until Bethesda makes every Weapon Cursed. lmao
---
Well we have to eat and drink so why not increase the realism?
---
Don‚Äôt glitch the camp budget and make yourself open to the stash glitch. Don‚Äôt put anything in the vending machine your not willing to loose outright. Avoid having items in the machine that rapidly put you at max caps and minimize your time to react to a run on your machines.

The cockamamie system they've come up with is so dense I haven't bothered to learn much about it, and don't plan to engage with it in any significant fashion. Certainly will not put any special effort into it.

Bethesda will truly do anything, concoct any number of bizarre unrewarding grinds, rather than produce compelling content. They will also drop these grinds into a game with bugs persistent from Fallout 4. It really is just funny at this point.
---
My friends did that on a private server but 2x bigger 
---
I got a few pictures as my loading screen and I couldn't get every machine in the picture
---
There were hot fixes by other games that take about an hour. It‚Äôs not always instant.
---
uh oh...
---
People farm west tek, and toxic waste weights 0.1lb with food perk. Why waste a minute when there is simple rad management items in the game (its okay to be a casual). Sometimes you need to heal your rads, for encrypted pylons or gathering ore in rad rumble, or you one of those bloodied players who know only how to shoot and dont help with events.
---
Definitely still has glitches and issues, I stopped playing shortly after the game came out in 2018 due to it being...kind of awful, but overall it‚Äôs a much better and enjoyable experience now. I‚Äôd recommend giving it another try, I‚Äôve been playing pretty seriously since March and I haven‚Äôt had any game breaking issues occur (yet).
---
That's coming soon
---
no vertibird power armor, why even live
---
Price gouging at its finest.
---
Did they ever specify what the "bonus challenge" will actually be? It could be everything from one more daily for a week to a doubling of the weeklies...
---
Yes it does ....seen it reported it ...they fixed the blueprint glitch but not the players saved inventory prints
---
I totally agree. Even many melee weapons have the total wrong animations and all they had to do is pull some of those from Skyrim. I thought the branding iron would be a cool addition to the game until I realized it was a skin for a swiping weapon which makes it look totally stupid. It's like the new glaive that's coming. You just know they're going to reuse the grognak axe animation and a glaive has a totally different center of balance and usage in a battle field.
---
"Like .4 seconds" is a bold faced lie
---
100 stimpaks a day isn't casual hours played numbers
---
I don't do it alone. And my "magic weapon" doesn't do me any favors on the queen. And if you don't want the easy cheap option that's your call. But there is no need to go back to your camp, there are benches everywhere. It's just a convince to have repair kits. Definitely not necessary I made from 0-200 without a single one or FO1st.
---
Sorry mate. I came back from a break this last time it left the shop one day late as well. Took me over 6 months of waiting to see it again.
---
Teslas are common because people like not having to aim and they have a fast enough fire rate. My favorite legacies for PvP are JE laser rifles and gatling plasmas. I also have a J25 tesla if people want to just tesla spam.
---
A hotmess
---
Is the update live?
---
Thank you, that is very helpful and satisfies my curiosity. I was only wondering because the updates on other online games I have experience of always took much less time to bring an update live.
---
Are you running mods?
---

---
Think that link should work. That's how it's done
---
Bunker looks cool, would like to see what it looks like inside before I pick it up. Thanks for uploading.
---
You‚Äôre killing it man.
---
Ah ok good to know, thanks, I'll keep an eye out
---
That wasn‚Äôt a woe is me reply, I was just saying it might be connected to the atom store refresh in my case since it hasn‚Äôt happened any other time during a reset.
---
If you log on every single day to do the challenges I'd call that grinding, I've done almost every single non-NW daily since mid-week 2 and all non-NW weeklies and I'm in the 70's, someone starting later is even further behind. I've definitely felt like I've had to grind to get where I am.
---
Nop
---
Kneeling in front puts them very appropriately accessible.
---
You can use one at a time and just swap perks when you need them.
---
Super duper yes, but I don't really alternate that much, 5.56 is my main ammo, but I probably only use ~2k rounds a week and make just as much.
---
Prior to wastelanders, while the ammo economy was still strong, I did luck hole runs pretty much every day, spliced in with quick weights and can chimes runs. Acid was the most annoying to get, lead was pretty easy, steel is everywhere. I made close to 72k 5.56 primary for trading, but also for my SBQ secondary.
---
After Wastelanders though with the dupers and subsequent crashing of the ammo economy, I moved my TSE Handmade to powerful auto and made it my primary gun - it's very nice.
---
Thank you for your service, sir. I give you the highest award I can bestow, a follow.
---
You will gain 4000 levels and love it, cur!! 
---
*laughs in Todd*
---
rifling that allows for greater pÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂eÃ∂tÃ∂rÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂iÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂, accuracy, and range.
---
ftfy
---
I can't believe it is already Tuesday again. and once again, nice job on the title
---
Some side thing in the mire, can't remember the name
---
I cant even get to the menu it just freezes
---
Honestly it's forcing the new meta towards hacked weapons more than anything else.
---
And the reason the dupes are popping up after the updates is because they're just a wee bit incompetent.
---
Every maintenance and update that doesn't come with a number
---
reminder that there should be one with a different color dropping in the event itself
---
I thought of going for the damage while sneaking,but i'm starting to realize that lvl 4 will most probably add like 10 damage. 
---
I'm waiting confirmation from pts.
---
At this point i'll go for STR and AGI. 
---
All these legendary perks and the best one are those that let you use the old and non legendary ones.
---
Same here, but I started playing again like a month ago and it is a lot more fun, it still has its bugs but for me it's not been anything gamebreaking
---
Restarted the client since the patch went live?
---
Don't worry about those high rank cards, you get a majority of the value from any card with just the first rank, and as long as you can make it to level 300 you'll have access to all the slots.
---
Riiiiiight, thats why they unban most of the dupers, because bethesda cares about their terms and conditions (they deserve permaban only)
---
Ugh, yeah. I‚Äôll do this as well from now on. This probably cost me at least a level or two of the season since I‚Äôm only in the orange part of the board. Oh well. I‚Äôve wasted 300-450 atoms on worse than this I guess (aka what I‚Äôll have to spend to make up for these lots dailies/weeklies).
---
Yeah, I completely understood what you were saying. What I was saying is that there have been so many examples of it happening outside of the atom shop refresh, that it can't be considered as a cause for it. It happens to many people every day of the week.
---
No one knows why it happens. Every example of something we do or don't do is contradicted by another example. It's completely random.
---
Until your double score auto completes.
---
Just go trade for them. They were mass duped. I do agree with what you said, it's just a solution.
---
Only on those 3 items.
---
amen to that
---
&gt;Whats with so much Communist stuff all the time?
---
Bethesda looking to be purchased by Tencent.
---
My camps not over budget. The glitch I was talking about effected camp that took a long time to load in regardless of budget. Also I dont care about losing vending machine stuff, this one let them steal your stash items
---
I just want a different set to automatically equip when I enter and leave my camp.
---
Be cool if you could electrify the fence
---
It's a bit of a dick move that they would advertise some PC down time on consoles.
---
It was like that since the start, only for regular teams
---
I was just saying that Bethesda has found another way to get more money out of people. Most people will just Buy Repair Kits because they don't want to leave in the middle of a fight just to repair a weapon that was designed to break faster.
---
I did, it keeps freezing in the menu
---
The biggest thing I noticed is that you have more than 15,000 atoms banked up. Isn't there a top limit on atoms too? With all the other limits Bethesda puts on things, I expect you're getting close if there is one.
---
Hell yeah, the communist bunker is available to grab! Thank you for posting!!
---
Let me get my tin foil hat on so I can vibe with you right quick my dude
---
Illuminati confirmed
---
If you're not too far behind I'd save those atoms for later lvls because each lvl requires more score to lvl up. Getting till lvl 80 or so is relatively easy, then if you don't farm exp (not counting weekly) you lvl barely more than half a lvl. I'm saving my atoms for the last few lvls unless I'll spend them first xD
---
Don't shoot the messenger, but I don't think it's live on Xbox. The notes from Beth were a little unclear on this point. The hotfix today was PC only but it sounded like it also meant the event was delayed on console until later this week as well. See if you have a new NPC at Foundation that gives a quest before you spend the time to drop a nuke.
---
But how long can a Butthole quiver last?
---
You have to wait 2 extra days, calm down
---
Now that's a sweet info
---
Bro spend some of your Atoms, jeez
---
With the way it's worded, making enemies take more damage rather than increasing your own damage, it sounds like it'll work like tenderizer which isn't in the same pool as what is affected by the current PTS changes.
---
I guess you missed all the posts about the console update coming later this week?
---
A lot of people did. Camp builders are essentially funding this game. Notice how quickly they changed course?
---
It‚Äôs a truly better then vault 94 since it‚Äôs not a damn fetch quest where you play hide and seek with key cards.
---
Over time daily ops will be added on for more content most likely.
---
I'd be okay with that, but their initial comment didnt say that. Where did you find that info?
---
How hard is it to remove a couple of conditional bits of code checking for the other two samples you no longer need?
---
Or, they could just revert the change and just hold off on releasing it until it's done.
---
Yes, when is it slated?
---
Like if you die after the SBQ is killed and they only take your Flux.  They know what they are doing.  It's stealing and should give you the right to confront them.
---
Kind of makes me glad I don't have my laptop with me and risk this.
---
If it's for a museum of sorts then I would have to donate ...i dont need anything for them
---
Hopefully a PC player will chime in and offer to modify it for you.
---
Hacking
---
They said they're pushing it back to the end of the week didnt they?
---
Thats dumb... hope they make it so anything can roll that or atleast make it a mod since thats what it feels like it is.
---
"STOP BREAKING MUSIC BOXES THAT MAKE HUMAN FRIENDS' FEEL GOOD!"
---
Irrelevant, it's a plan I don't have and I'm reaching a point where the question "How many plans are you missing?" can be answered with "not a lot."
---
only those items
---
I thought that was meat week
---
Depends on how much you love to grind. Of all the "content" they have added its 85% grind and 15% story.  As far as bugs and glitches, its Bethesda you either learn to play with them or wait for the next patch/hotfix.
---
later this week.
---
There is no ammo economy......
---
Proof?
---
I personally know at least 20 ppl that always say ‚Äúimma gonna cancel over this‚Äù and they never do
---
They will fix this and leave other things still broken. Hopefully they‚Äôll fix the camo SS under armor and the bother fatigues will work properly. It just works
---
They're using the PC to test for a couple days then if all goes right it should get a console release shortly after. Easier to fix on PC then console. Fingers crossed for Friday.
---
I was literally waiting for a post like this on this item.  You did not disappoint.  Thank you.
---
They add instead of multiply. It's a lot weaker
---
Oh boy, more Commie garbage....yay. /s
---
Thank you, saved me the 1000 atoms I would have already spent if I wasn't at work atm.
---
My precious!
---
Slow weapons (low fire rate weapons and slow melee weapons) where hit the hardest in the patch and they do deserve a base damage buff, but remember, that's what the PTS is for, testing, remember to post this on the forums as well so the deve team receive the feedback.
---
It‚Äôs not hurting you so stop it Karen
---
Really? that'd be awesome, I still need to actually make the museum, so I'll tell you when it's made and ready for the displays.
---
That‚Äôs doo doo dude, scooby dooby doo do be smoking doobies dubiously in dubi.
---
Nothing and no one keepin' ya here.
---
I use the ground glitch as posted by /u/ZachyChan013
---
Been following the advice posted here and have avoided it so far.
---
This is exactly the reason why I keep a level 10 hunting rifle on me at all times, I may be a high level but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to kill legendary‚Äôs straight away
---
It's completely bare and roughly the size of the seedy shed, but circular. There are no interior turret windows, despite what the exterior of the bunker might imply.
---
Or until the new nerf hits and everyone is looking for stronger weapons.
---
No. Double dipping was first patched out for the pipe rifle. Left in for the revolver rifle and bolt action
---
Whale like skellies/fossils are all over.
---
Please Note:¬†We are releasing this hotfix today for PC versions of Fallout 76 (Bethesda.net, Steam, and Microsoft Store). We are going to monitor some of the changes it contains over the next few days, and then apply the hotfix to console versions of the game later this week.
---
The Fatman is garbage though, people make jokes about how weak it is
---
It's probably enemies killing your brahmin not players.
---
i think its like two more dailies per day for a week
---
Ship, I really hope its just server lag due to the update and not a bad patch.
---
Probably something in the ballpark of 8 but I get the sinking feeling that Bethesda is going to cap the max number of load outs to 3 or 4. 
---
I'm sure some bone-headed management who doesn't play the game will think that'll be more than plenty. I mean you only need one loadout each for ranged, melee and utility, right...?
---
You can dumb down any quest in any RPG to "a damn fetch quest".  
---
Vault 94 was the best content this game ever had.  It actually required team work and coordination and communication.  Everyone had a job.  Daily Ops isn't even in the same ballpark.
---
They goofed the formula for Unarmed only
---
Bethesda on his best
---
The definition of hotfix has become broader over the last 10 (?) years and usually means a patch that has skipped over many of the usual pocesses or delivery windows because of its urgency. Some hotfixes require downtime, some do not.
---
If I purchase that bunker bundle can I place more than 1 bunker in my CAMP?
---
Thank you, I've deleted post because I was apparently too quick.
---
Who are these "most" you speak of? All my friends will definitely tell you they never bought them. Have you?
---
Lol there goes all my builds. Rifle and bow
---
No Improved Repair Kits? I thought Bethesda said those would be rewarded for ‚Äúend-game‚Äù content..
---
I don‚Äôt know. Nothing surprises me with this game anymore, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll find a way though.
---
It's because that uses mutations instead of a rank 2 or 3 perk
---
This is waaaaay better than some stupid time limited puzzle.
---
Just let us kill and play defend, it is simple enough and there should rarely be any issue.
---
Aaaaaand if you want to do it quick enough to get bonus rewards, it's not like ezpz.
---
Nah, not needed. I mainly need the plan for completionist reasons as I'm using T-65 anyways. :)
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was another bad patch
---
You don't have to go bloodied or junkies, but optimize your perks. Perks that worked well before like Bloody Mess are no longer worth the points they take up. Critical hit perks are now much more worth using than they were. Armor penetration too.
---
Take perks that boost by larger amounts per perk point before using points on ranked up cards that have diminishing returns.
---
Also, for weapons like the lever action, try swapping to a hair trigger receiver instead of hardened. Fire rate seems to increase DPS more with this patch than outright damage does, especially combined with armor penetration perks.
---
Also see if you can manage to drop a one star two shot or AA lever action at the purveyor (if you want to stick with a lever). Should be better than the furious one and easy enough to get with how cheap one star drops are.
---
Yes each rank is always 150
---
Meant, that for me, when I go  into PA, it removed the backpack, so I have to add that perk to counter the loss of the backpack.
---
I wait for 24 hrs. before buying anything so I know it works lol learned the hard way a few times...
---
I‚Äôm your proof. The camp shit was basically the straw that broke the camels back. Been a member since day 1 of launching the service. Figured out no matter the amount of money they bring in still won‚Äôt fix the game.   Cancelled my sub and I just log in to do dailies and bounce.
---
The goal of plastic is already met.[event page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
I don't know if this helps or not, but I'm a new player and just recently got stuck on that quest. 
---
I was able to fix it by inserting the fuse into the box, leaving the building completely and then accessing the computer after I went back in.
---
You're good, just wanted to nip it in the bud before another "everything's getting nerfed" debacle
---
I'm OotL, are legendary perks in the game right now?  I thought they were delayed.
---
I sent the clips and loadout on xbox
---
Lvl 100 becomes MK Megatron
---
Totally agree. 
---
And just to get this straight...Meat Week was pushed 2 days so it gave players a chance to try the new event without interfering with its starting date. But now, consoles have it pushed to (knock on wood) end of this week, while Meat Week is already in progress?
---
After the last few months, I'm baffled and shocked at what keeps happening to this game.
---
Wow great job bethesda, I cant even get into the game
---
Better off dropping to rank 2 cards for the weapon specific and taking rank 3 of the armor penetration card.
---
Directions unclear. Twelve arrows stuck in my butthole now.
---
Sounds like PC might be down for slightly longer due to them adding the Colossal Problem event to PC. Idk if this applies to you.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/424236/complete-pc-only-fallout-76-maintenance-august-18-2020/3?language%5B%5D=en
---
Yep, having the same stuff happening to me. The cherry on top was that I had a player in the server who was going to use a hacked weapon against the colossus.
---
All my excitement was turned into disappointment and annoyance pretty quick.
---
Does the communist PA skin work on every type of PA?
---
Wont sink?
---
Ammo factory. My bloody explosive LMG has been waiting in my stash for too long
---
You got what you deserved you dirty communist !!! ( Damn Bethesda test your atomic  items ... )
---
Agreed, good comment.
---
Why put a bunker on a roof?
---
Level 142 on Xbone
---
5c for plans, 5c for bobbleheads, 10-25c (depends on what it is) for magazines. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking about setting up another vendor and having it be meds and stuff I don‚Äôt need/use
---
Agree. It‚Äôs kicking the can down the road and postponing a true solution. Any limit increase would just become a future problem. Like all the beta veterans that walked to school uphill in the snow both ways with their 400 stash, and here we are facing the same dilemma with 800 limit. I do think that because the game sets hard limits on how much can be spent each day, the devs could ease up a lot on the earning caps. They‚Äôve got the in-game economy under their thumb, so even if I were allowed to accumulate thousands of scrip in my wallet, they could easily limit how much stock Purveyor has to give forcing daily or weekly visits.
---
You mean quad explosive üòè
---
Only into the ground ... not foundations.
---
Dangerously based
---
Yeah the Meltdown mission was pretty difficult sometimes and unforgiving as hell on expert.
---
Dead in the Water and Washout however were amazing in my opinion.  Very well designed.
---
Lol bye!
---
Yeah happened to me too
---
So it can be friends with my roof greenhouse and roof bungalow...
---
Another issue with the bunker is that that any item placed inside it will float because the physicsbox/hitbox/whatever is higher up than the actual floor.
---
It's a bit hard to see that in screenshots so it's better to check that out yourself in game
---
Use the flame thrower.
---
I used to be an adventurer like you.......
---
I thought they said in the gameplay video that it's a guaranteed 3*?
---
&gt; If Bethesda stuck with the fallout weapon tiers, energy weapons would be the best in every department and heavy explosives would be the ultimate solution for big boss type enemies like the mirv fat man.
---
Funny how that turned out to be the complete opposite in Fallout 76...
---
On the brightside though, it's another thing we can add to the Bethesda Twitch stream bingo. See how LadyDevann deals with this one.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen twice.
---
Can confirm, dropped a nuke and tried to fast travel - instant kick from the server
---
Other MORPG games since their inception have managed to design challenging, optional, group progression content.  I see no reason why we cannot have it in this game as well.
---
Also I want to like chess but I can't get over the fact that it's inherently imba because white moves first.
---
Nope. Just one fence piece.
---
Ah. Well. Good to know. I‚Äôve never messed with anyone else‚Äôs and figured it was just best to be safe.
---
Ok, thanks. So, essentially, an emergency patch.
---
PC is working already  since I got into a server and then the game froze and crashed, and now I cant even get into the menu wihout freezing
---
Literally there was a straight up comparison of killing a sheepsquatch on live and pts with the same buffs/build.
---
The sheepsquatch was also lvl 100, and it still only took .4 extra seconds to kill.
---
The only enemies majorly effected by this change is the SBQ and Earle, but they have ridiculous built in dmg reduction that should be reduced.
---
&gt; 100 stimpaks a day isn't casual hours played numbers
---
It really is, unless you log on for 10 minutes, and don't do events/quests and just walk around. Doesn't matter if it's 100 stims or 20 stims, they replenish so much health anyway, so you'll never have to farm for meds.
---
Yep, so there is basically an invisible wall at the entrance to the mine and you get DC'd when you fast travel. This is so disappointing.
---
We can't blame Valseek since he is only a community manager. 
---
Honestly... It's a joke how Bethesda hasn't hotfixed or at least reverted the change afterwards.. AFAIK only a few were hit with the bug they tried to "fix", but it was mostly fine. So they should have reverted said change with a hotfix until a later patch.
---
The fact that they can't even fix the challenges, THEY set out for players to do whilst playing, gives me little to no hope. If you google a challenge not tracking properly, you can find posts of 2018.. Meaning in 2 years, they still haven't fixed it.
---
The high damage builds get along fine for everything except SBQ and colossus because even losing a proportionally larger amount of damage they still are doing more damage than unoptimized builds.
---
I thought it was fine overall for my "casual" characters who don't use any legendary gear, but I guess even though they shrug off legendary gear they're still well optimized with perks and craftable weapons and armor... probably better than most actual casual builds.
---
Admit it! You have a flooting camp!
---
Glad to see they spent the last two weeks productively
---
TSE Tesla all day for any scenario cuz I think it would be fun. Teslas are my fave weapon right now. I have had almost every version except the TSE. It's my dream weapon. One day...
---
Who the fuck gonna use that trash drops, cursed fixer or handmade is another story, why they even bother to add that crap to the loot pool
---
Agreed. Dead in the water wash super fun, struggled with washout but still enjoyed it
---
Same, after 3 attempts each causes a server disconnect
---
Oh man, looks like we'll need another hotfix.
---
I'm so sick of these bugs. I spend way more time logging in an out trying to find work arounds an dealing with bugs then playing the game.
---
Are there any issues with the safe or is that one working fine?
---
I wonder if its a different issue, like there is only a finite amount of times it can be completed per server.
---
Because I completed it fine last week on a private server, and other have noted being able to do it on a public after multiple world hops.
---
...did you read the post?
---
Haha! Made my day.
---
Delayed time wise or day wise? On xbox
---
Wait, what's from Russia with Lev? Is there new story quests?
---
I canceled my 1st subscription. Level 350, had it since pre-order. Not to mention the chatter around a few large groups we run with is resonating the same. Everyone grinded to get here. Take it away to please the lazy ones, the veterans move the hell on.
---
And worse, take the money with them.
---
I think Bethesda got the hint that we like prefabs. The more the merrier!
---
This is exactly why I love and buy all the communist skins. Gets people so triggered
---
Its not just pulling a 1 star from 3 star legendaries.
---
The RNG in this game is garbage and skewed to hell.
---
Ive done the SBQ hundreds and hundreds of times and not once got emergency protocols or calibrated shocks. Without them I will NEVER use the ultracite PA or Strangler PA. Its a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* how skewed the RNG is, thanks, that's fun Bethesda! Especially cus I got all the other junk plans from her hundreds of times that never sell. 
---
Ive also crafted over 50 Gauss miniguns and not once got a bloodied. All those damn resources wasted crafting them. All the effing weight they weigh me down by.
---
I got like 30 exterminators though!! Awesome. More junk cus of the bullshit skewed RNG.
---
Well, this bodes well for having it release 'later this week' for consoles. 
---
I smell another huge pushback.
---
It already HAS been released buggy as hell
---
I assume you‚Äôre on console. You should be thankful. Because the patch is live on PC and it‚Äôs a shitstorm
---
 you said you wanted proof so I gave it to you.
---
And no preinstalled power connector as shown in the pics released before today and in the atomic shop.
---
Makes sence, you cant dig on concrete. But I can remove the space gap by sinking on the ground
---
I'm level 400+ and couldn't even imagine running around like Mario. I do just fine on the ground. The other mutations are ok.
---
I can't quite do a perfect test (would need junkie's and AA versions of the same weapon, which I don't have), but anti armor certainly seems to still work as a % debuff to enemy damage resistance. So yes, if you stack a bunch of additive damage boosts, you'll eventually reach a point against a tough enemy where the gain from anti armor is greater than the gain from junkie's.
---
still did the job.
---
Not on the moon, there aren't!
---
Plzno. Pipes are nuts already due to perks
---
Of course - as always, a CAMP building exploit to the rescue. Good old Fallout 76
---
I think there are multiple things that can cause the issue
---
How is it not a challenge? I die constantly to SBQ
---
Oh damn üòÖ I thought the scorchbeast flew around in an oddly familiar way.
---
I did, you have 19 days Left, you might get to 60-70 if you play extra Hard
---
directly east of Whitespring
---
Only took a handful of Mini Nukes and a few dead Dwellers
---
How is ONE DUDE proof? Why should I even believe you? You‚Äôre probably just making shit up anyways. 
---
Here‚Äôs a hint: there is no proof and there will never be proof because there‚Äôs no way to actually prove it.
---
Well, hate to say it but it was a "good" call by Bethesda to release it for PC only first. Now they only have one platform utterly pissed off at them.
---
I'm just here for the cookies
---
Probably just a picture like the one for Blood Eagle was.
---
Half price chems, and bulk junk sell well for me
---
These people need permanent bans.
---
Hell I don't even have the Legendary Run Finished.. just cannot be bothered with that Trash. PA lookin like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man hehe I haven't left yet but I don't play much ... Figured I'd stick around for any new content maybe. I'm all for correcting the damage sources but they would have to buff perks or something and you I know that won't happen lol They have never buffed anything besides laser weapons and they still suck. Only reason I play at all is to trade on the Market and that's dried up alot with the dupes.
---
IT JUST WORKS!
---
*prove
---
Most likely, yes.
---
In addition, you have to make money on the console every month for PS-Plus or xbox-Live and then get kicked in the ass by Bethesda.
---
There's a few little tweaks you need to do to make sure you can click on the chair inside so that you can get the prompt to sit.
---
For example the newsbox is using  the small bench, and it's positioned in a way that the leg is accessible from the window in the front. Same with the stove.
---
the barrel is using a round stool and is a bit more tricky to sit on. The barrel has a few "holes" in the texture that you have to position the legs of the stool to access.

I've been recording video of my camp building to eventually try my hand at a few tips and tricks videos. [Here's one I made a while back that uses the ground glitch to make a toilet you can sit on. ](https://youtu.be/kIisLsSzIM0) I'm a lot better at maneuvering things now,

Well that sucks, it's going to fuck over every build let alone bloodied

are you on pc?

is anything character bound in any way?

I edited the mistake before your response.

If spelling is your only argument, means you ran out of real arguments.
---
I hope more cursed weapons get added cus I can see this event getting abandoned fast without worthwhile stuff to farm like with the SBQ.
---
They did. Just bought it. Look again.
---
Lmao you saying this really shows that you are really bad at chess.
---
Challenging doesn't mean having stupid designs like what we had in Vault 94 which you'd spend time on and get nothing that matters.
---
Honestly it's not even fun, nor requires any brains, it was a chore.
---
I just want blackbird paints back
---
What platform? Because if you're on a console, there's no reason for you to be trying to buy something that isn't there yet.
---
This is neat
---
Also unrelated, when I rejoined it put me in my camp...  
---
And half my camp literally blew up the moment I loaded in.
---
Hey join my public team.
---
It was a joke.
---
Challenging doesn't require what 94 was but it sure as hell isn't daily ops.
---
If it doesn't require any brains im sure your group was able to clear all 3 weeks on expert consistently with time to spare?
---
I also use "Lyravega's Item Sorting" which adds prefixes to item names to help sort them.
---
Then they should have specified it was pc and not yet on consoles.
---
Confusion is their fault

Its not a floating camp but it definitely shouldn't exist...

More like a tilted jengatower... best description I could give is the Cover from "Cabin in the woods" built into a cliff

If you assume it‚Äôs buggy, why do you want it now? Worst case you wait a few days and it still has bugs. Best case, you wait a few days after it had been tested by more people and it works well. 
---
Forgive me for not seeing the big deal here.
---
Not on console it ain't.
---
So they're fucking over console users
---
Why is it always something. Bethesda is not able to launch anything without it being bugged. Even some items from the atomshop can't be normal and working
---
what a fucking joke!
---
Hey u guys wanna play fallout?
---
Nothing is character bound. It's all freely tradeable.
---
Idk if im impressed or not by that. Did the server just die in the end?
---
How do you flamethrower a foundation?
---
Hey there everyone! Thank you for the report, please try to event again as this should be resolved now!
---
I also work "in the industry" and hotfix is often used this way. This is just pedantics about nomenclature that has changed over the years. This isn't even a new argument and I still remember the [thread from 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abwqnu/bethesda_doesnt_understand_hotfixes_and_schedules/) about this. Bethesda is far from the only company to do hotfixes like this (even my own company deploys hotfixes that have occasional downtime).
---
i hope its better by then whats it like on pc
---
Ahhhh, you're on console. Sry. I heard the console hotfix is coming in a few days. Maybe...
---
It's been widely posted about that only PCs were getting the update today. You missing that info is on you.

Well, most of people like extra freedom of movement marsupial mutation provides, and carry weight ofc

I didn't see any posts about that anywhere

Wasteland 3 comes out on the 28th, it should consume all my time up until next update.

You didn't read the hotfix notes. It says explicitly that the updates were for PC.

Needs more exclamation points.
---
Men with dedication and shear fking willpower who keep making them
---
The new event doesn‚Äôt work and crashes servers/disconnects people, new fast travel bug, new atom store items don‚Äôt work properly...
---
The only thing that seems correct is that the SS limb mods are now available.
---
The big BoS event is going to be season 3 as far as I've seen.  That's why the rewards have almost nothing to do with them.
---
Why?
---
I need the globe!
---
Wow just wow! All that "testing. PTS and delay and they still couldn't get it right!
---
Really?  Define "well" haha. Thats awesome.
---
"Peaceful Protest" no longer means what you think it means, just ask CNN.
---
Here's how it'll go:
---
* Content will be lackluster. We think it'll keep us going for a while but in reality it's really not that great.
---
* Bethesda will finally fix some bugs that have existed for a few months, note i said a few months - the bugs that have existed since FO4 will continue to exist. For every bug fixed, 3 more will introduced.
---
* A new dupe will pop up, it'll run for a little over a week because Bethesda can't be bothered to hotfix exploits for a live service game.
---
* They finally fix the dupe, moments later a work around to the dupe fix is found, it hangs around for another 2 weeks.
---
* People forget all this has happened and continue to support predatory business practices with empty promises and general disregard and apathy for the player base from Bethesda.
---
next time take a few minutes to look instead of posting.

‚ÄúPlease Note: We are releasing this hotfix today for PC versions of Fallout 76 (Bethesda.net, Steam, and Microsoft Store). We are going to monitor some of the changes it contains over the next few days, and then apply the hotfix to console versions of the game later this week.‚Äù
---
It does a shit ton of dps in a short burst. Like 12 per sec.
---
&gt; \# 1 is now canceled 
---
Sure it is.
---
can we appreciate that the bundle is just a big discount for buying the 3 items at once without any unique item that forces you to buy the entire bundle if you want it?
---
I have this problem with him too.  I usually have to back up and put a few shotgun rounds in his face before the quest dialogue starts. 
---
Wait.  On second thought don't fix this.
---
So many other studios are facing the same situation, some MUCH smaller than Bethesda - yet they are more than capable of pushing on great content and bug fixes.
---
Bought the bunker bundle and the grill. A pretty good week for the atom shop!
---
If you're on ps4 howdy friendly purveyor!
---
Bosses in this game are not difficult content.  This is not a normal MMO where high dps is achieved through a beautiful and complex rotation.   It's just "point and shoot".    
---
Bosses do absolutely nothing in terms of providing something difficult.  Timed trials where team members need to communicate and coordinate and complete tasks in a set amount of time is literally the only way to have a challenge in this game.  
---
That rush of beating an expert run with mere seconds on the clock is the most excitement and enjoyment I have ever gotten out of this game.  The people who disagree never had that week 2 expert completion with 5 or less seconds on the clock.
---
Because once the insane fanboys arrive they'll do what they do best. Downvote everyone who dares voicing criticism, no matter how valid. :)
---
Cool story bro.
---
I bet bet fuckin *bet* they only fuck bloodied. Nocturnal will remain shit, the Stalkers legendary effect will remain on melee weapons, the insane damage bug on Limb Damage and instigating weapons will remain. Mark my words
---
Clearly. The game just glitched out and multiplied the machines by x100
---
Some of the rewards will be available to purchase with bullion, if this subreddit is to be trusted. Maybe look into that.
---
Clearing vault 94 only requires good muscle memory; the knowledge regarding the objectives, which are simple tasks so you just need to know what to do and you can do it; and a build that you won't die in. 
---
Oh wait also requires a good server, or you'd get nothing.
---
Just tell me which is the part that you think actual brain power is needed.
---
And people have the right to counter protest, I guess is the best analogy.   Most people aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpeacefully‚Äù protesting anyways.  Also why protest on Reddit, why not go to the source and protest through tickets or posts on the official forums.  Posting here is like protesting unfair wages at walmart at your town park.

I noticed this too. And the fence? FFS!

im not gonn act like i know all of the stuff they have to do to make things like that work but they have been testing it on the pts for a long time now so you would think they would have it all worked out by now
---
*burns down the wayward*
---
If there is one machine I honestly dont care for them having it but when it gets to be 3+ than thats a problem.
---
I think skins are since they just swap out the models. Paints have to be made for each power armor you can use it on, so those are armor specific.
---
QA still on their smoke break, I guess. Thanks for taking one for the team.
---
For 1st is just the love bed and the rug.
---
I have almost 2000 hours in this game. Let‚Äôs stop fooling ourselves guys. This game is broke. Always has been and probably always will be.
---
No e another pluhsie for the comic store
---
When someone makes a big buy out of my machine I usually FT to my camp to thumbs up and heart them if they're still around.
---
So they are making the entire map max level and nerfing our damage to hell?? Tell me what‚Äôs the point of getting more XP if my best weapons and armour are useless anyway?? 
---
Unless you have a team to play with all the time you cannot travel around and complete all the content. So no more soloing. We‚Äôre being forced to team up in a damn fallout game. 
---
So all of our progression and grinding was for nothing because we‚Äôre still as strong as a level 1.  Don‚Äôt tell me perk cards make a difference because these numbers show they clearly aren‚Äôt doing much at all. 
---
Only top tier builds will be able to survive this at all and feeling perpetually weak no matter where we go is pointless
---
No, its incompetence. They lack the tools to do anything about it. They don't have the staff to research and ban accounts.
---
Nerfing weapon damage is trying to blanket fix it, but will be ineffective about removing said weapons from the game.
---
They don't make money from hacked weapons, they make money from the Atomic shop/FO1st.  They also don't really get money from adding userbase unless people buying from the Atomic shop and/or subscribing to FO1st
---
They didn't remove the original emote. For whatever reason, when I claimed the new emote, it unequipped all my emotes. Had to equip all again from the atom shop.

It's not us you have to worry about. :)
---
Unless I'm wrong but if what I'm hearing is correct this isn't just a nerf that of course is something reasonable people might be able to live with it's worst then that. If they're planning on nerfing everything accross the board to the point that everything does more or less equal damage I will quit the game. 
---
There's is no reason why adventure mode can't remain by design an RPG and true to Fallout franchise while Nuclear Winter itself is balanced to become more of a online shooter. The bottomline keep both modes and update them seperately because an RPG/ adventure mode has different needs and wants along with design then a multiplayer shooter and mode meant for competition will.

Which is fine and is why I asked. In my space a "hotfix" can be "hot deployed" to a running server without downtime.

It seems that the term has been a bit corrupted a bit in less conservative software industries to mean "emergency patch"... which is why I asked about the definition.

The ammo wars of 2020
---
My Gunslinger fares a bit better than my Riflemen builds (all Bloodied), actually.  The addition of Tank Killer is fantastic, and the fact that the ArmCo machine dispenses .38 and 10mm ammo like crazy means that won't be much of a problem with the buffed enemies.
---
But I think that, as with Rifleman versus Commando, the current numbers hurt the "high damage single shot" setups the most.  For Gunslingers, that means revolvers, which are typically the strongest guns in our arsenal, but also the slowest.  Quite a disadvantage now, since they basically don't want us one-shotting anything, and that second or third shot on a revolver doesn't come quickly.
---
I know it won't happen, but personally, I strongly believe that Gunslinger and Guerilla ought to be merged.  Pistols are weaker than the other weapon classes, but that would be a fair trade-off - you get the flexibility of an automatic option for "free."
---
Whenever I see one of those camps, I make a bunch of explosive bait and destroy their decon shower or other expensive things to repair.
---
I dislike people who do stuff like this.
---
PTS is only on PC and a much smaller audience. 
---
Just wait a few days. It‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
It‚Äôs possible to create content here that would require doing specific actions to deal damage to a boss and or other mechanics that would instant KO a player if he was not looking at what is happening around the arena. That is what a dungeon raid should be.
---
You‚Äôll need a shit ton of baits to put a dent on this monster farm
---
I forgot this was even happening

They picked an extremely appropriate name for the new event?? ü§∑
---
Yeah since they benefit from both perks you can easily get massive damage out of them. I've got an instigating that got around 600 damage on the first shot without anything special beyond the first rank of each Rifleman and Pistol perks.
---
Is the bunker a separate instanced interior? Or just a prebuilt room like the others?
---
Apparently they do
---
An army of ammo factories
---
You sound charming
---
They updated it on PC and it‚Äôs back up. But apparently people aren‚Äôt able to start the event, as it‚Äôs crashing as people fast travel there.
---
Big surprise.
---
Wow dude, we both came here to say the exact same thing at the same time.
---
I have tried relogging, switching characters, any ideas?
---
You are correct on most people do use it. No argument there. It just doesn't feel like fallout ( I know that's a lame argument ) it's just me.
---
Yeah, I hate bothering people, but honestly I have my boyfriend host a private server so even if my connection goes to hell, he can rescue my items. 
---
An account wide mailbox makes sense, but it would undermine Bethesda's need for us to grind the fuck out of each character.

I absolutely do not understand their mind-boggling inconsistency between instantly responding to a need/mistake vs letting things fester/deteriorate.

Ah. Thanks. I have it for PC and PS4 (my friends play on PS4) and o thought it would be a maintenance type thing where it takes a couple hours.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda could fall into a lake and somehow manage to miss the water.
---
The point of the post was to gauge how many atoms it would cost me to finish, since I will not have time to complete it myself.
---
Not sure why you went the direction you did with your reply.
---
Will be wiped clean. Nothing sticks after a few minutes.
---
A proper junkies build requires certain perks cards, gear, and stats to be properly maintained as well as needs the player to play at h their chems to make sure they are getting the most out of their build. Mutants doesn‚Äôt require any of that except class freak and the option of strange in numbers. Bloodied is harder to survive and requires a higher lvl of optimizing to make work but requires a lower lvl of maintenance.
---
But none of that really applies to my point: mutants doesn‚Äôt require any commitment to a build type compared to others like junkies so it shouldn‚Äôt be as a great a dmg buff.
---
No set date. They can‚Äôt even get A Colossal Problem up within 2 months of their target date so I‚Äôm not holding my breath

If you did watch the youtube videos, you'd find that it's not that easy to archive the time required to put you on the best reward tier in daily ops, depending on the day of course.

The thing with 94 is that you get nothing if you fail, and even if you succeed you'd only get trinkets. Not a good way to make people actually enjoy it.

Wade airport is stupid huge. Its main non-glitch resource is oil, and the oil extractors at one end of the runway are so very very far from the one at the very far end that I find myself longing for fast travel within the workshop. Wade has got to be the largest buildable area in the game.

After the new update im getting an error stating "Disconnected due to modified game files" that kicks me back to the main screen when I try and choose one of my characters. Has this been happening to anyone else?
---
I've been feeling skeptical of this game since before it launched. And nothing yet has made me change my mind.
---
how did the cork one got completed? lmao
---
Both the balance changes and One Wasteland were originally planned to come about a year ago, they were talked about after E3 2019 and at QuakeCon. Delaying for so long definitely did not help.
---
How do you do this?
---
" Maybe not for the anally retentive gun nut, sure. I get that too. All I  was saying was that the reason Bethesda went the way they did was self  evident - cleaner visually and more efficient to implement. " so then why doesn't every other game that features guns do that, or most importantly a huge game like modern warfare hits the system hard as hell, but their animations are top notch and makes sense, i doubt it would take more resources to show a bolt being pulled back from the right hand if they can just do it with the left hand, if anything the bolt actions requires more animations because the developers said "have the player tilt the gun down to pull the bolt back" rather than keeping it aimed and pulling the bolt back, its un- necessary to have to obstruct your field of view and cause more of a hassle to have the stock drop to re-chamber, rather than keeping it steady, aimed and pulling the bolt back. its not about animations costs because it would cost less to not drop the gun.
---
devs came up with the ideas and the prints for the guns, which means its devs fault for getting many things wrong which were previously done right.
---
It's what gun fans do.
---
They can't really distinguish whatever gameplay rationale might exist from the "that's not how this gun works in real life" rationale.  To them, this inaccuracy is immersion-breaking and distracting, and they will complain profusely about it.
---
It's also how, in some games, you get these ridiculously detailed reload animations that have the player character's hands fondling every inch of the gun... when to the gameplay-oriented player, they just want the damn thing to reload so they can shoot the enemy in the face.
---
I was wondering about that emote for a while now. I know we used to have it but I haven‚Äôt seen it in a while. So it‚Äôs back?

---
Please teach me. As far as I can tell, you don‚Äôt choose a difficulty and if the time you get is better than the times they choose then you get scaling rewards. 
---
Am I wrong? Because the only difference to me is that you don‚Äôt choose the difficulty.
---
Oh no...
---
Ammo. Some ammo produced is about 10 bullets a min so 10 * 167 = 1670 bullets a min, 1670 * 60 = 100,200 an hour, 100,200 * 24 = 2.4m ammo a day. So that much ammo can be made to just hoard or what ever they use it for. I imagine its for prepping for the next update

---
In a fucking fallout game we can‚Äôt even viably play alone. We stay weak now even at level 300. What a joke
---
It was a standard one like the wave they removed for god knows what reason
---
Have you worked with multiplicative and additive numbers? Which do you think is easier to balance? With so many sources, perks, buffs the damage can get as high as 10k on melee weapons and not changing how this works will not solve the underlining problem of exponential damage increase.
---
yes it is 2 years in. Nothing could change that. Better to solve the problem now then bite their ass in the future when future content would be pointless because if they build around bloodied other players will complain how tanky shit is and the opposite would be true. 
---
Middle ground is close to impossible with multiplicative numbers in a live server game. There is a reason why MMO games always choose additive.
---
No they‚Äôre up and we are unable to run the event at all

I love the train car. I set up all my main crafting stuff in it (tight fit, but works really well). That way if I move a camp I can just plop down the train car and build the rest of the stuff later.

look at the hunting rifle, if anything its directly putting your player in more danger because of its re-chamber animation. its not an argument of "cleaner and more visually efficient" because if that's the case why don't you just keep the rifle aimed
---
Sweetwater does the same crap by the way. It can take 3-4 tries to get to the "forest is teeming with it" point.
---
Since you deleted your response to me, causing my response to disappear, I‚Äôll say it again here.
---
Not all the criticism that people are voicing is valid.  There are aspects of this game that have been in place since before it was released, things we all new would be there, like stash limits.  And yet they still complain day in and day out. That‚Äôs like a man/woman dating someone and thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll change them‚Äù.  If you don‚Äôt like a design choice of a game, don‚Äôt buy the game. Not ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy the game and keep bitching so they fix it to how I like it‚Äù.

Also, it‚Äôs not a protest to come on here and make a post, then go back to playing the game. You want to protest? Submit a ticket then uninstall the game.  Cancel 1st. And stop playing. THATS a protest.  Anything else is just lukewarm attempts.
---
This isn‚Äôt the official forums. This is reddit.  If you post something, be sure as hell to expect other people to chime in. Better yet, why not just submit a ticket to express your frustration.  Posting here is just an attempt to circlejerk on the issue, or try to rally for a cause.  If you‚Äôre going to rally, be ready for people to counter rally in the form of things like rude comments and down votes.
---
I mean couldnt they just use the converter? Also that bounty would be 835 caps Lol
---
Now - if you could fire drill bits out of a rifled weapon...well it probably wouldn't do much more penetration wise but sounds really cool.
---
\*damn\*....now I want a magnetic launcher rail gun that fires drill bits...
---
It worked for me on private. When I dropped a nuke and tried it on public, I got a disconnect message on fast travel, 2nd time on public, I tried to enter via the newly formed entrance and it was like an invisible wall. 3rd time, I launched on a private server and was able to enter the event successfully.  
---
\*EDIT\* Private not public -.-
---
Todd?
---
me too i'm 70 something.
---
also a lot of people got tired and bought all the ranks I'm not gonna do that until the last day
---
Lol my team watches mine burn for a few minutes and jokes "There goes 3 grand" hahaha
---
I‚Äôd rather have a stack of 5 than one of each. Easier to drop.
---
I quite like the fact you benefit from having a higher level toon, makes the grind I've already done worth it. For some noob to come in and benefit from shit I've been waiting for, well that's... Just poo. Just my opinion.

*enver hoxha has entered the chat*
---
Bethesda? Releasing a broken event? Ha! Never! /s
---
Holy fk that ammo. Most I carry is 10-25k
---
Reee
---
So I assume you should scrap/store before you get off?
---
I read that it has turret windows on the outside but not the inside? And that it‚Äôs a nightmare to place down? And the fence can‚Äôt be lowered if placed on foundations and always leaves a big hole at the bottom?
---
If true, all those are unacceptable
---
Disconnects will prolong the amount of time it will take and thus lengthen the grind, and that is the definition of "content" according to Bethesda.  
---
It's not a bug, it's a *feature*
---
Please papa Todd, I can't handle another one. Is it really unplayable?
---
It seems us console players aren't missing much!
---
Yeah, going to skip this bundle
---
Right, but isn't that how it should be?
---
You wouldn't want this giant, clunky computer strapped to your dominant hand.
---
Great idea! *watches Bethesda burry it* However do to their sick need to force us to play things we don‚Äôt want to as often as they require us to they has denied this option.
---
sigh
---
I just put one in my CAMP with almost zero of the issues listed here. Could use a bit of a resize maybe but its honestly very cool an I'm not having any of these issues.
---
Just had to contact support about this one too, the nav mesh for the interior is completely broken- worse than the camper when it was first released so despite being small almost nothing can actually be placed inside properly either.
---
Right? I got a keg of nukashine and I'm suffering from jelly fingers...
---
Let's see where this party takes us
---
Yeah, Guided meditation is very underrated. I usually get about 2-4 legendaries per run
---
It isn‚Äôt fair that you can‚Äôt viably play as handgun main. You should be able to be powerful when you reach the endgame of your build.
---
i did mine in private, didnt work
---
Hasn't happened yet. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Hey, I‚Äôd be all for them adding it as a new weapon too :P
---
Gotta agree. First time I saw it I legit spit water out of my nose
---
It's been awhile for me, these issues with the Dailies broke my will to grind bouillon. Back closer to the Wastelanders launch if Wren went eyeless, Ward did too. Server hop, turn in, resuming playing the actual game. Glad they fixed that at least, I guess?
---
Now I just ignore all that and never set foot in Foundation or the Crater. No real value to them when you step out of the gold grind it seems.
---
Perma ban anyone who is better than you. The raider way
---
Yore about two weeks too early. 
---
We wouldn‚Äôt lie to you man. You can‚Äôt get into that mine.
---
Man, I saw these posted at the beginning of the month and have been damn near giddy with excitement for them. Mainly because this last month has been spent fine tuning my military C.A.M.P. themes and felt these would be perfect additions.
---
All that said? I was waiting for someone to post a post like this describing the problems with the Bunker and fence because of a lack of quality testing. Thank you for this info though, just sucks the problems are along the lines of what I was expecting.
---
I got disconnected on public server as well. After that we nuked the private server, didn't join the event from the map, instead we walked into the mine. We started the event, but after some of us died, we couldn't respawn inside the event, instead we had to respawn outside in the world, but not in the nuke zone. After walking back to the mine, it was already closed by rocks. 10/10 Bethesda, so glad you delayed it so many times.
---
Man, I just can't wait for the contemporary camp to come back, I had taken a long hiatus, so I was never there for it. I don't understand why Bethesda doesn't want my money, I would literally pay them real money for it if they didn't randomly take crap off the store for no reason.
---
The problem is they are not the same lmao.
---
In vault 94, you'd pick your time limit and reward tier first, there is a fixed time limit enforced, and the rewards are fixed at each tier. If you fail to complete in that time, you get nothing.
---
In Daily Ops, you are rewarded based on your speed, but there is no fixed (or a very long) time limit to complete the task. Every time you play you'd get sth out of it, if you fail to archieve the higher tier, you'd still have a lower chance at getter the good stuff, and every daily ops is like a good exp grind/legendary grind from what I read.
---
People also have their right to express their disagreeing with you. You came up with a post to protect your right but at the same time, you are disregarding other's rights
---
Steel dawn army fatigues at end of the month
---
Consoles dodged a bullet.
---
Most of the NPCs are affected by this but none of them are as rage inducing as Ward.
---
Remember "It just works"
---
After the hotfix I have successfully completed this.  Did not fast travel though, will try that next time.
---
Ok, still have the stupid death in powerarmour thinking I'm overweight sending me to Vault76 but I'm not even able to spawn at 76 :(
---
&gt;"ammo economy"
---
All ammo is worth 1 cap...
---
I drop mines or throw Molotov‚Äôs. That way I get a tag on absolutely everything in the middle while everyone using their duped VBJEFFR402590 Gatling plasmas can be gay and kill everything before anyone else gets a chance at a tag.
---
Some Bethesda developer, somewhere, will never live that choice of name down.
---
See also: the infamous "Best Left Forgotten" in Far Harbor, which I am convinced is a jab at whoever came up with that idea.
---
The same thing happened to me. I always defended it and played well over 2k hours. but slowly it's no longer fun.
---
I honestly have no issues if some does this exploit as long as it doesnt effect the server stability. Having 1 at your camp is fine but when everyone has 3+ it causes some lag.
---
Nice try again this week Bethesda, but I know you're holding out on that Vertiguard Power Armor and X-02 Power Armor.
---
I just... No, that's fine. This is fine. All is well. Maybe tomorrow
---
Eh, I would say that if all you are going for is the damage buff, it just requires picking which chems will effect you the least for debuffs. But the same goes for mutations, pick which ones you want the bonuses, and way the pros and cons. More or less to the same degree. I just feel mutations and addictions carry a lot of the same characteristics, one being permanent (assuming you run starched genes) and the other being semi permanent. But I do see your point, I could just see both of them being borderline equally viable.
---
Good point, I may have thought It increased damage but obviously I was wrong.
---
I'm kind of new to using unyielding, my main is a vanguard junkie build, it's my alt that uses unyielding and I've only been using that char for a month
---
And then the ammo production gets split between all of the extractors, at the same rate, just like purified water or crops.
---
If you walked through this, you'd see each extractor has 1-2 rounds. It would take literal days to reach max capacity for each extractor
---
A communist bundle behind a paywall ü§£
---
I actually don't want to practice. To me repeating the same things in the same order over and over is hell itself. I wish there were never any of the same mobs, loot, or challenges in any location. I prefer to have to solve problems quickly with creativity. To me, that is joy. This is why I hate MMOs most of them are about repetition without elaboration.
---
Right, I gotcha; it just seems like pointless hoarding!
---
Does it save you any CAMP budget?  I don't have the atoms to go on a spending spree, but my thought is some of the pre-made houses help make the larger camps that I just can't seem to fit in they way others have.
---
Whew, I dodged a bullet! Guess us console players are luckier than we thought.
---
Yeah the economy is broken af. I still try to trade but the amount of duped gear is crazy.
---
The most terrible thing of liberator MK V Is the mellee attack
---
I agree.
---
I‚Äôm not disregarding anyone else‚Äôs rights, I would just like it if people weren‚Äôt rude about it
---
 Yea I noticed the suppressor texture looks stretched too
---
I agree 100% as they quickly found when they tried going survival and we saw how that ended. The fact is Nuclear Winter isn't why or what reason majority of people play and want from any Fallout game.
---
Yeah anyone complaining about lag is full of shit
---
Don't care about the ammo but if its true its affecting public servers making them laggy screw that take it to private servers
---
Thank you so much man!! I was going to buy it, I‚Äôm luck to see your post and sorry for your lost
---
Another job well done.
---
/slow clap
---
How much would it have cost to take the workshop?
---
I find that that do actually. The red rocket garage is especially efficient budget wise
---
Always have hated it. I‚Äôm a PvPer and Tesla cunts just ain‚Äôt got no skill.
---
It will be delayed for Xbox and PS4 again, I believe. I'm seeing reports of people saying they DC when they get to the mine, or it won't let them in at all. We will see
---
Blueprint for each different workshop. I can place all the extractors and power connections in one blueprint for hemlock holes. Just add my bluprinted power base and connect 1 wire. I don't worry about turrets or anything on the private server.
---
ah, you're right. i was thinking of the brahmin shaped grill- the free one is like red or something and the paid one is blue. yeah, the chally costume is just dirty.
---
Well, I think it's pointless to store workshop items because I don't think they are saved for when you place things at your CAMP, scrap for sure though
---
Fatigues are a reward for collecting wood from Aug 27-31 for the Project Beta portion.
---
Hackers, hacked weapons and tons of broken stuff, just the fun stuff üòÅ
---
Then have fun with the new update, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll use the perks &amp; gear as intended &amp; not need to exploit bad game design.
---
Even with a nuke?
---
Non binary bean
---
If only. -_-
---
Everytime I have joined a public team, the majority have continued doing their own thing. On the few occasions when somebody had a mic and started talking, they were kicked from the team. Most people do not want to be forced into playing with others. They want to enjoy the fallout experience same way they did the last ones, solo!!
---
i never got credit from it when i do it.
---
cool beth.. game still broken
---
Well as we know its so they can give it away for free next month.
---
How else are ye hunt the wendigo what took yer leg and yer crew all them years ago?
---
ouch
---
I believe its due to the moving parts and the fact they arent in their designated spot. 167 moving parts and errors should cause server strain
---
Geez where do you find nuclear waste
---
Liking that future tec bundle. And communist one with the fence and bunker.
---
It's patch 21 being unstable and turning meat piles into resource hogs. Unlikely to be this
---
Just add a Responders Vault or something where you can pay, say, 1,000 coins to store a weapon/armor or up to X pounds worth of food/misc/junk/ammo. Maybe low level weapons/armor and a bit of junk can be free so you can give your new characters basic items to survive with.
---
How about this-is-not-a-trap-and-we-are-not-cannibals-Con
---
No weapon skins again? A bit disappointing tbh
---
It's their right to express their feelings.
---
Xb1 sorry.
---
You know they test this shit out on us ... I've learned to never log on after a patch.. always lurk on reddit and forums to see what they've done... then .. if it's safe.. log in and see what's up.
---
Karen
---
I really really hope he does not collect meat from those feral ghouls for meat week.....
---
They‚Äôd have to ban like 40% of the player base.. (maybe a little over exaggerated) but I see a looot of people on Xbox with these ammo machines either hidden or just outside their base scattered around. No way they can punish people they‚Äôll kill the game
---
Its for the whole month
---
I agree. I never said otherwise. It‚Äôs also their right to be rude, but that doesn‚Äôt make it ‚Äúright.‚Äù
---
God the rewards for this are so shitty. So shitty. I‚Äôll probably do this once and then not even bother doing it ever again. Way to go Bethesda. So shitty.
---
From my understanding Workshops have a scrap pool outside your personal scrap, so anything highlighted in green when created will not count towards your pool so you won't store that scrap. 
---
I don't believe anything will actually be stored from "public" workshops.
---
You should definitely, gather all resources from machines (e.g. ore, fusion cores, etc...) before quitting.
---
Todd is that you? Can I buy skyrim again?
---
Only works with the ammo factory. The rest of the machines require a resource below them to work.
---
I'm not sure if it triggers as much as it's kinda boring
---
I hope I have two under armor on instead of jsut one. I prefer the fatigues as a uniform
---
That's what I am doing also. Too many characters (4) for me to try too max level a legendary perk. With over 300 level up saved up overall, it's not good enough.
---
I don't have time to grind the repeatable weekly ad nauseum... so I've all got something like 15 ranks to go.
---
Junkees
---
Again not really sure what you're going on about. There's perks and gear designed for certain things. High damage, high health.  If you're mad that people know how to use them, that's on you. It's not exploiting game design when it's there to use. That's half the fun of this system. Seeing how far you can push things with perks, gear, buffs...etc. Its all right there in the game.
---
Not trying to control anyone here, bud. Didn‚Äôt making any demands. Just asking for people to be respectful
---
That‚Äôs way beyond excessive. Hopefully Bethesda does something about this exploit
---
No leve raction skin
---
Yeah most likely, if it changes the appearance, odds are it will work on all armors. If it only changes the color, it's probably PA specific.
---
They really should just make it easier to find tamable pets. The requirement that they have to spawn alone AND be a random encounter is just pure garbage.
---
&gt;I have a feeling that the game might be in it's best possible combat friendly state after all the changes are complete
---
after one apalachia bloodied will be mandatory mark my words this sub has no idea how good they have it now in term of balance
---
I agree. Just asking for people to have a bit more kindness üòá
---
The out of bounds thing is a way to take no fall damage &amp; zero AP drain on jetpacks.... that‚Äôs an effect on the player base &amp; the camo one is a legit issue... y‚Äôall are just too lazy to reload for an extra .5 secondsüòÇ
---
What did you expect? 20k caps, 800 gold bullion, 500 script and a 100% Two shot explosive weapon drop at every kill?
---
It wasn‚Äôt??? When will it??
---
Then he is the exploiter and should be permabanned for using HACKS
---
Oh that globe....why do I need you so badly??
---
Hi all, this should be resolved now. If you experienced this issue, please try giving it another shot!
---
Ok I‚Äôm gonna go for it
---
Thanks for answer.. Fucking bethesda and their stupid deadlines never surprise me
---
Well I have good news for you:  99.9% of the game is exactly that if not 100%.  it is easy to solve problems and content.
---
What I am asking for is just ONE piece of end-game group progression content.  Not asking for the game to be redesigned, just something like vault 94 that is there if you want to participate in it.
---
Well that damn Brahmin was talking some mad shit out of both heads so I had to kill it
---
Right‚Ä¶ Because there‚Äôs no in between right? Get the fuck out of here
---
Hmmm so to get light you would have to put generator inside ? Thats not great.
---
Still doesn't make sense I have a camp with 20 turrets and a gather not to mention maxed lights right next to bog town which has all resources up plus another 20 turrets and there is no lag. Maybe there is packet errors from the factories but I have doubts.   
---
So long as this was within the 100% budget I just do not see it being the source of the lag. Odds are higher it is the new duping method that has been rumored (heard it was a work around of a method from last year) and the factories are taking the blame.
---
Funky Duds and Ammo Factory.  Poison DOT is the only thing that stresses me out.  Also would be nice to feed my Bloody Gauss Mini and use it for more than melting SBQ.
---
I appreciate it thank you so much, I‚Äôm working on Getting Unyielding gear, what is your opinion of the bear arm? Is it worth it? I‚Äôm trying to get a variety of weapons to change up the gameplay. So this may be a long journey. I appreciate your time thanks again
---
I have had some serious frelling BoS fatigue for a long time now, and it is only gonna get worse üòî
---
It does affect the player base, yes. But read what I said again. I said they don‚Äôt have a *detrimental* effect on the player base. And the SS camo Glitch does need fixing. Not that there are any mods for the limbs anyway.
---
I'd tell you how to fix it but having 4 is a no-no
---
already up for you a few threads down when listed by "Hot"
---
Appreciate the info, I was going to purchase it, but that's a no.
---
don't join it via map, go to overlook south of it and run over
---
I was so hyped for when I get home from work too. Makes me question how it was working in the pts (apparently), and then when it's actually released it's broken? Lol wut
---

---
 &gt; Hi all, this should be resolved now. If you experienced this issue, please try giving it another shot!
---
This just happened to me, holy shit.
---
That‚Äôs not what I was experiencing when I did this. Seems to be a steady rate no matter how few or how many extractors you have. What does matter is ammo type. Like with 5.56 you get 5 ammo at a time from each generator every like 30 seconds. But with 5mm ammo for example, it‚Äôs only 1 in the same amount of time
---
Quentin the server maintenance guy at Bethesda wakes up, gets paranoid and anxious at the possibility of the new update breaking the game more than the previous update. He then gets in his car, drives to the nearest medical marijuana dispensary and buys enough brownies to get himself totally and absolutely wrecked for the whole day, drives to work and heads to the morning meeting.  He's then informed of the known issues, and starts eating brownies, talks to his bosses, and requests someone else does the update rather than him. After being informed he's the guy that HAS to do it, he locks himself in the toilet for 3 hours trying to get in a brownie zombie state, only for Dave the Bethesda janitor to unscrew the door hinges and allow the maintenance team to extract Quentin, and carry him to his computer. After numerous attempts to login they finally manage to remember the name of Quentin's cat, Mouse, and find the new update, send it to the prime server for it to start the process of updating the rest of the game servers. At this point Quentin's email starts filling up with error   check requests from the game servers, and he will, like every other update before, get to as soon as he's in a fit state to work on them, tomorrow.
---
Why do people phrase posts like this? I know it's a bit pedantic to worry over that, but the PTS has multiple features that are currently far from functional and has a very controversial change. There are multiple front page posts discussing this controversial change right now. So what's the point of asking if anybody is skeptical of the update? The answer is obviously yes, it does not require a lot of thought or more than 10 seconds looking at this subreddit to see that
---
These are great! Watch me get a Reclaimed Mining helmet my first time even though I just got the Fashnact Deathclaw Mask lmao
---
Have you crafted stuff? Because crafting uses bulk junk as well.
---
Thanks friend! sorry about that.
---
Smoke break? Not only has this ‚ÄúQA team‚Äù long since left the building for their smoke break, but they died of lung cancer, had a nice funeral, the estate sale is over, and the grass has grown back over the grave.
---
Bethesda announced it would come out today.
---
What the hell? Just why?
---
There's a really dinky "Exit" sign with yellow rotating lights around it.  I think the railroad tracks flow up there.
---
I have no idea why Bethesda was so damn intent on obscuring it.  It came up as a PTS complaint repeatedly.
---
And another job well done...
---
East side of room, has a (tiny) exit sign above
---
Yes. Added it to a report I made previously.
---
Thats because this community can't seem to follow along in events with even one step. Like its crazy when you are at events at its as simple as interact with an object an you see people refuse to do it.
---
SIR YESSIR! Level 23, still at 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 because I can‚Äôt decide what route I want to go down with this character. I‚Äôm on all day most days. GMT.

Mate ngl this is some conspiracy theory nonsense and you have no proof that this is a lame marketing ploy apart from your schizo ramblings. Do you really think people buy repair kits or is this what you are telling yourself to further your point? In before "b...bro trust me"

yeah i died and just went outside haha

He is resisting the programming! He will not go down without a fight!

Besides, not everyone here come with democratic backgrounds. Reddit ain't just for NA. Keep that in mind. People might have different perspective and will not take it too kindly if you try to assert your rules into their behavior
---
For people like me that prefer not to watch a whole video when a quick description will do I suggest watching this one.  It‚Äôs short, to the point and it‚Äôs much easier to understand when you see it done.
---
I just completed it on a public server too.
---
You can bypass that by making a terminal
---
For once, these are OK and not absurd drop rates.
---
Kindness and respect are universal. Again, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking
---
I use glowing plans. It lights up green for every recipe and plan out in world that spawns. I missed alot before.
---
So killing enemies with gatling plasma will drop plasma cores? Is that guaranteed?
---
Doesnt mean that we shouldn't complain
---
Maybe his blank stare is a cry for help...
---
He doesn't understand what is happening either!
---
Taking Todd Howard‚Äôs own advice. You should give Bethesda a break then. Game is still being worked on. 
---
I haven‚Äôt heard any news of a new F.O game. Maybe they are going to continue working on this single game and just building on top of what they already have. 
---
Sea of Thieves is suppose to be a 10yr game... WoW is on its 16th year.
---
I hadn't done any crafting between bulking the junk and "depositing" said junk in my stash box.   I bulked it, tried to vend it and then realized I had to put said junk in my stash box.    I tried to stash the junk, but after I did so, it was just gone.
---
Did someone mention plushie!!
---
You are not. You are just getting it two days later.
---
Do you have two accounts or just another character on the same account?
---
Not gonna happen if you try to control their behavior
---
Quite the opposite, they're lowering the gap between builds. Bloodied is no longer hilariously superior, it's only somewhat superior now. They still need a massive rebalance to most of the effects in the game, but you are no longer being punished as hard for daring to not use the meta
---
Depends if you equip the newly rewritten perk: "Fire in Hole"
---
Butthole Degradation Reduced by 50%
---
Why
---
Thanks guys, I managed to get out by defending myself for 15 seconds without getting hit so the fast travel timer would finish ticking down, I got out at 0 seconds left. do you lose anything if you die in there?
---
Game needs bluffs overall
---
"stop whining" while whining on a thread
---
Is the PA the same as the green one, just a different color?
---
Same,it won‚Äôt ever be even 90% fixed
---
There‚Äôs an entire sub in which people can assist you in transferring things like what
---
Sounds like I'm in the rare case - 
---
I actually nuke it (alongside with another guy from different silo), and fast travel to outside of blast zone with most of my public team- wait until both nuke dropping, click the map and join the event then finish the event (but it's my first time running so it took me a whole minute to figure out where is the damn exit - I just barely hit the end zone without time to look up potential chest/loot :-(
---
Yes but they are not in that game a lot. Liberators, the small wastelander quest an mama dolce. An now communist stuff has the most items out of any faction.
---
I agree 100%. I also wish this sub would be moderated in a way that promotes constructive discussion and not quick inflammatory soundbites that gets upvoted. One can dream lol.
---
Seriously what is this about control? I‚Äôm not in a position of power. It‚Äôs a simple post asking people to be more kind and respectful. There‚Äôs nothing else to it.
---
Not on Xbox yet.
---
It'd bring a tear to my eye but the servers lagging so bad its been 72 hours and the tear still hasnt formed
---
Was supposed to be in two days, thursday maybe. They wanted to make sure it was working ok on PC first. Now, who knows, right?
---
Partially resolved. If you die during the event you can respawn outside the mine and won‚Äòt be able to go back in because the rocks are back, blocking entrance.
---
Consoles aren't getting the event until later, and apparently it's not working on PC regardless of that.
---
"Did i do something wrong?"
---
For starters, you tried to play an event that isn't available on consoles.
---
Don‚Äôt buy the bunker pack
---
But why??? Why are there whale skeletons all over in landlocked WV? It drives me crazy.
---
To be honest a little bit I am most likely we will get more parted content and not the original intended patch
---
And in VATS it's pretty much a one shot on anything other than bosses.
---
Seems like poor design, my eyes (and attention) were drawn to a lit up section of rock where it looked like there was an exit, I thought I had found it and did the follow me emote to the other guy who was lost in there and I felt like a total dickhead when we ended up at a dead end. Nothing else really stood out to me as being the exit and the marker was no help. I'll keep an eye out for this dinky exit sign next time lol.
---
That's what I'm hoping to do. With the fence around it. Make it look like a military compound.
---
they did, actually. and it's been posted about many times on this sub.
---
Oh yeah my bad I didnt read it. So essentially there wouldnt be much point in taking one to the event unless you had the ammo for it prior
---
People are sick of people whining about the 'adjustments' made in the PTS. It's been going on for almost a week. No more Mr. Nice. Don't tell me how I should react to these people. I'm getting tired of it and I will make sure that they know of it. How am I supposed to react to a week long whining? People have their limits you know
---
The magazine rack returns!! I've been wanting this for so long!!!! Yessssssss

 "Anything else is just lukewarm attempts." - I disagree, and also nobody has to follow your set of protest doctrines. There are more complex strategies of manipulating corporate interest as a consumer. 
---
As for " If you don‚Äôt like a design choice of a game, don‚Äôt buy the game." - Most people are not able to understand the problems of a game without playing it for some time. Not to mention, many things were/are advertised that do not work in the game - or have never really materialized. Also, people who don't own or play the game - but have played the rest of the franchise - should also come here and complain. To me those people are paying customers as well, and have good reason to make the failings of 76 as public as possible.
---
"  If you‚Äôre going to rally, be ready for people to counter rally in the form of things like rude comments and down votes. " - Right, but that doesn't mean that those that are rude, or who downvote out of pettiness, should not be spoken against - if the intention is to maintain civility.

"It just works" - Todd Howard
---
Never used one but pretty sure it's on par with the DCG/MMG/Powerfist. This build is really fun and versatile I highly recommend. With no vats perks I also run 3 ranks of rifleman. Carry my heavies, B2525 Fixer and DCG and use them all effectively with no perk switches. Unyielding is key cause with your specials that high you can sneak and use vats to your heart's desire with none of the associated perks.
---
All of them are accessible if you know a certain glitch
---
Was this on the PTS or live server? I am just wondering if this is something we need to plan ahead for for when wastelander one comes to live.
---
Have I told you to do anything?
---
Yup, someone was saying a silencer removed the aoe effect, have not tested that myself though
---
Bethesda will refund and will always let you keep the items, buy it, refund and you've got it for free.
---
I used one for a long time.
---
We need fan art of gram (made as a gram cracker)being dipped into a moo moo(made into cup of milk) and gram says (milk of human kindness)
---
Not sure about that. With the placement of each factory it caused everyone to lose control and get stuck connecting. While in the area it was laggy af. Took 1 min to even register my foid going up and running past them was like a powerpoint presentation
---
I like this. They should do it more often
---
You're not using the scrap box right?
---
Yeah you told me to be nice to them. Well, I don't want to
---
You know, I played it on the PTS and it worked fine. Like literally 0 issues. I've tried to run it 3 times live and have disconnected before I could even get in the mine the first two times and, the third time, died, unable to get back in. Not sure what the difference is, but everything they put on live ends up being absolutely awful.
---
Remove the 2 cards from intelligence,just equip when needed,do a couple queen events for repair kits. And switch cards to either heavy or unarmed.remove good doggy remove Aqua boy/girl. Just my opinion tho,goodluck!
---
Lol... us console players are never gonna see this event
---
At the rate we have been going? Guano ü§£
---
Thanks for saving my atoms, kinda dissapointing. Really hoped to do some bunker builds.
---
No I didn‚Äôt. I asked. And I didn‚Äôt ask you specifically.
---
Where did they say this because i cant find anything on Twitter? Btw im not angry at you if may seem that way, but at Beth for not being able to make a single functioning feature.
---
Don't worry they broke it on PC too. We even had the devs play this at this point paraded around, look at this new stuff! Can't manage to get it after weeks of the test server. People force spawned outside the mine on PC. No release on consoles. I'm freaking floored. How does a patch manage this? They push new code live they didnt test? Q
---
The brown one correct? If so I'll just hold off the color doesnt matter to me injust want the grill itself
---
A bank would make god roll weapons costs insane amounts of money. It‚Äôs fine where it is. 30k can easily get you what you want. 
---
Stash limit is there for server stability. Scrape box only has stacking items so it doesn‚Äôt impact stability of a server 
---
Text chat would be nice 
---
They plan on implementing expeditions and daily ops. If that‚Äôs not content idk what is.
---
The cap on gold bullion and script would be ok to if they changed it to weekly. 
---
The cap is there on script to prevent cheaters from exploiting the preveyor and get infinite god rolls that‚Äôs not duped.
---
It's so baffling. I played it on the PTS and it had no issues. None. Whatsoever. But here, I've tried to run it three times and can't at all.
---
Maybe their next project will be outside of the United States and they are rolling out a potential design and testing what is popular with players
---
Thanks! But I‚Äôm asking specifically about the JE or J25 lol
---
I‚Äôm sorry :(
---
Lol if you break the bunker, the power connector shows up.
---
PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RESPAWN BUG I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH EVER SINCE WASTELANDERS DROPPED
---
Whenever I die I get the 3...2...1.. respawn stuff
---
But once the screen fades back in from black I am either a stationary or rotating camera as if it was still looking at my corpse.
---
If I die during colossal problem I am screwed out of the instance because I CANNOT RESPAWN.
---
How do you find out exactly how much over budget you are ?
---
YES! Thank you this was exactly it!! I use them rather than the large fusion and that was the culprit!
---
Oh no I understand! They said it I believe just on their website if I‚Äôm not mistaken, I would go and find the link but I‚Äôm at work right now
---
Then don't post it on a public forum like this.
---
re: point 2 - fast travel out of the nuke zone to the drop site (or wherever appropriate) when you respawn in the nuke zone. You have like 10 seconds with no rad damage to do it and the fast travel is very fast.  I do this all the time to avoid the screwing around with donning and doffing rad resistant armor or hazmat suit. Fastest way to get back to the fight.
---
Dying also makes you unable to get back in.
---
People on my server are doing Tea Time events. I'm reading a lot of reports saying the even is full of bugs. Not going to waste time and ammo to drop a nuke then get disconnected.
---
Mmmmmmmm‚Äôkay
---
The lmg spits or rounds as fast as a minigun but with a much tighter spread and no spin up or spin down. The only downside is that 308 is a bitch to craft compared to 5mm or 50cal.
---
Enclave checking in!
---
Hopefully your build won‚Äôt be too impacted.
---
Are you on PC or Console? The update released for PC but its not due for a few more days on console.
---
I find it surprising that your attributes aren't derived from the perk cards you pick up to max of 15. For example, if you equip 15 points worth of strength perk cards you have 15 strength. This would be the most flexible system and would allow players to try things.
---
Of course Bethesda would prefer it's player base to grind out everything and minimise any enjoyment we might get from the game.
---
Yeah, this is a known issue across all platforms
---
MMO where social features like inviting people either doesn‚Äôt work or shit designed?
---
Sandbox game where fast travel fails 4 out of 5 times?
---
Events with respawn bugs?
---
Loot not share amongst people on the same event?
---
Loot corpses disappearing or being blown miles away into some unfindable bush?
---
Na my man... only Fallout 76
---
Lmao see in a democracy if I agreed with you 51% or 100% there is no difference üòÇ. Let that sink in.
---
Maby add a bank treasury note/bond worth x amount of caps for high end trades
---
Send pms to those people. Why post it here?
---
So you're just going around linking this because of someone else said something an you don't even know yourself?
---
Again, I have it placed it with zero issues this person is claiming except the size is awkward an yes the turret windows are fake. But its a bunker an shouldnt have windows.
---
More like a colossal failure it's been triggered 3 times that I've seen first time disconnected me immediately upon joining the event. 2nd I died and enjoyed the good ole you can't respawn bug. Which if you fast travel away you're removed from the instance and can't get back in and the 3rd time disconnected me upon joining the event again....
---
I swear they don't test anything even for a brief moment.
---
Shh, Now they're gonna reduce the amount of legendary drops to fit the scrip limit.
---
Thanks for the advice =)
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get it either
---
nuke it twice
---
It‚Äôs apparently getting fixed in the next update
---
Didnt know this well fuck me
---
That's not even a big requirement though. Load into a new server and at least half of the camps are from players over level 100 and if this was a feature I'm sure they would all take the perk then unequip it once they have the monster they want. While this certainly would be a badass feature, I can easily see how everyone and their mother would have camps full of deathclaws.
---
Okay, if you just hit Rank 86, you have gained 174250 score so far, you missed 2500, so that's less than one rank at 86. You can get 10,500 score today with the challenges - that would put you at 89, part of the way through 90. Continuing your pace. with 15,000 for the rest of the week - if you get 50,000 xp per day, which you probably would with the level up daily challenge - you hit 95 by next Tuesday. Putting you only 17,025 score from finishing.. if you complete all your weeklies on Tuesday, then you finish on Thursday August 27th without any bonus challenges. Even with them, if they are just extra challenges - you still won't finish any earlier.
---
So, yes, too little, too late, as previously stated - if you use your "casual" player snapshot. This should have been either this week, or last week, to help the most amount of people. With people coming back for Meat Week and A Colossal Delay this weekend, extra challenges would have been big for people sticking around to play these events.
---
Technically, it did release, yes. For PC only. And it's riddled with bugs.
---
PS4, That's kinda annoying but thanks
---
I saw ladydevann say that it was fixed about twenty minutes ago
---
You are literally my favorite person on Reddit.
---
I think this is really the thing. Although I run a heavily mutated build, I'd personally rather see them just drop Mutants and thereby slightly increase the odds of getting something that might be useful. With my luck they'd drop it but just increase the roll chance for Nocturnal.
---
Cool!
---
That‚Äôs my mates camp!
---
how the fight? how tough is big guy?
---
When I was studying physics at university (way back now) - I was something of a wiz in the laboratory, weak on my mathematical/theoretical, strong on practical.
---
A couple of friends helped me build a magnetic launcher to fire a small length of rebar (specially machined for balance) on a weekend when the science labs were all empty. We set up a bunch of cinder blocks thinking that it would probably shatter one and that's about it. Well, I had devised a magnetic feedback system that would put more power into the magnetic loop as it was fired (initial magnetic flux of powering the magnets creates an electrical current in wires counter wound around the outside of the barrel then fed into magnets at the end of the barrel to increase the pull) ...but I had miscalculated how strong the magnetic field would be so the rebar ended up going through the blocks, through the block wall behind it, through the block wall across the hallway, through a filing cabinet and lodged in the outer block wall of the building. Needless to say we spend the rest of the weekend covering it all up as best we could and breaking down all the equipment (mostly fused at this point). Not much damage...just very neat holes.
---
Was the coolest thing I had ever seen...to this day I love the concepts behind any kind of magnetic weapon.
---
\+karma thanks
---
I was even gonna say the whole vibe at WhiteSprings even seems Casino-ish. You got Assaultron out the wazoo to handle anyone winning too much and there's plenty of shops to spend your newly earned caps. Could be fun.
---
Pretty much all the new communist stuff has issues so just brace yourself and do research before you buy it.
---
Glowing enemies or claiming that dump site at the bottom is the map that no one uses. Plus if you have the contracter perk it only takes 1 or 2 per generator.
---
So why is that cursed shovel so damn rare? And the harpoon so common? Did they at least fix it to have some effect other than fire rate like in the old PTS?
---
No where does it require you to complete it. If you dont want the stuff dont do it. Relax have fun. Im currently on lvl 50/100. I might get to 70s and thats ok by me.
---
Events really fun if a bit laggy when theres like 50 wendigos lol
---
A very valid point.  I guess Beth favors the most evil of the factions?
---
I am not currently home and I have read this from 3 different sources (here and from 2 close friends on discord)
---
But hey, be my guest and waste your money on shit that‚Äôs broken, badly designed and basically classic Bethesda untested CRAP. 
---
As for everyone else, I suggest you inform yourself further and maybe watch some YouTube‚Äôs before pulling the trigger on this one.
---
It was rigged from the start
---
I'm getting real tired of waiting for the lever rifle Pioneer Scout paint to come back.
---
I mean... if they really wanted to have people stop using these OP BE/JE legacies they'd add new shit that was better. Add higher level items and poof legacies are worthless except to collectors. They couldve done this with the One Wasteland update since enemies are getting buffed.
---
This game is a MMORPG. Pretty much every one of those types of games adds higher level items to make people grind more to get the new shit. Not everyone likes the grind but if you dont you don't have to do it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you think someone in QA didn‚Äôt spot this, log it, argue against it being a low priority, and be overruled so it could be shipped into your hands, then you will be very surprised if you ever work with a QA department.
---
BRAVO!
---
Had the same problem on ps4. Had two full days with no new challenges. Counter read they had all been completed. They wouldn't reset after retrying the challenges. Hoping they fix this for the second run.
---
Its a dupped delay for consoles.
---
If I find these, I rob every last one. A quick stealth boy,  and pick the master lock. Last time, I stole 500 rounds of .45 and sold them in my vendor for 0. Worth the 10 bounty
---
ok thanks i just finished all my store stuff and then i looked and it wasnt showing up
---
Why does the thing I want the most always have to be the rarest?
---
I would like enclave stuff as well. But I'm absolutely in love with those communist items. I'm a bit disappointed they didn't release the red shift jet pack or fusion generator skin.
---
Well to be fair - throwing mini nukes at the enemy probably SHOULD be the ultimate weapon...especially for the weight of the weapon.
---
But yeah, going to be interesting to see how everything balances after it all hits.
---
what the hell are the other people doing, I have to ask?!
---
I would love to confirm that, but all the loot and baddies are pretty static. Every once in awhile it will be a verdant season or something - but usually all the stuff is where you expect it to be. I also don't mind group progression, I just don't want to memorize moves or mob spawns - everyone can have their own job - I just don't like things that only have one solution (i feel like the GURPS is built around not having one solution, conceptually).
---
I'm just glad I prepared myself for disappointment.  I'm not looking forward to expeditions at this rate because of how easy they are making end game, it's just gonna be another W+M1 dungeon  
---
I want something that is not just W+M1, I want something that is at least somewhat challenging to do, that takes some patience to learn how to run like V94 did.  __TLDR of the following: if it is harder than W+M1 then we will never get it, community is to bad at game to do more than that__
---
Gotta love our disappointing endgame we have beside 94:
---
Queen: crouch/W + M1 until dead
---
Burrows: was supposed to be a "tough end game area" cleared in 10 minutes solo by W+M1.
---
V94: responce to asking for harder content after burrows, needed a team and coordination, needed to solve basic puzzles while in combat
---
Encrypted: W+M1 after waiting for other people to grab pylons, because people wanna be useless and not grab them
---
Project paradise: W+M1, because anything that's not shooting deer is too hard, other 2 animals are always screwed unless you join a farming group
---
Rad rumble: W+M1, everyone just Jacks "muh deeps"  in the corner, completely ignoring both ore and scavs
---
Daily ops:  press W+M1,press a single other button 3 times
---
Colossal problem: crouch/W+M1 until dead
---
LOL, check the spoiler tag... I was being impish.
---
Time for a break.  Put the crayons down and go sit over there. 
---
Nah just kidding.  I get super frustrated when people show up to an event and have their own agendas.  This is why I only do private events.
---
Put a bayonet on it if you need it to have a point.
---
Man I bet that guy was pissed
---
Or we can accept the absolute fact that characters are entirely separate from each other and play with that in mind.
---
ACP has messed with spawning in general it seems. Extra buggy player-spawns all around on PC today.
---
Fast travel to the mine if you can't find it
---
the collection won't be complete til I have my pet Liberator running around my camp..
---
Fair enough  - I was thinking that I might have missed something obvious and needed to move my stats around LOL.
---
as it written in legend and prophecies  
---
A 3 star Ghoul slayer shovel (from colossal problem event)
---
I like the bunker and fencing, as my base is in whitesprings neither of these issues really concern me.
---
I'm also only using the bunker for my PA station. The only issue I have is everything floats inside of the bunker by just enough to give me a headache.
---
makes sense, they are the evilest of game corporations
---
Me too but then the first guy to arrive obliterates it
---
Its in the patch notes as being fixed for the update that just released on PC, you should have it in a few days, for now you'd be best removing the skin and re-placing your camp
---
Okay lmao üòÇüòÇ just been looking for one of those stupid plans forever haha
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can put you in a private server where it works for some reason.
---
(Offer valid for PC players only)
---
Chems, mostly.  I keep about a hundred of each kind in there.  My prices fluctuate, sometimes I‚Äôll get lazy and pay people to gather ingredients for/with me, and I factor their pay into that batch‚Äôs price.   My best sellers are grape and berry mentats (50c) and formula P (100c)
---
Overdrive sells quite a bit too, but I price that at 75 because I buy a lot of the nuka cola I use to make it and that takes away from my nuka grenade stash.   I‚Äôve also got discount plans and 1c ammo, because a lot of my customers just spent their rent money on drugs.
---
R/whoooosh.
---
Nice one. Guess i will have to grind*
---
*I've gotten 3 uny ss and a bloodied fixer my first month trying...... Not bad rng
---
Can I just say how much I appreciate your thread titles. 
---
Thumbs up emote.
---
üôÑ of course you can‚Äôt.
---
Well at least I can now see why no one cares for these legendary perks
---
Has anyone confirmed that it actually works?
---
haha true.
---
It was really late so I left
---
But when the power was on we couldn't connect cords without it say server not responding
---
I got 5000 10mm and 22000 5.56 
---
It was really impressive
---
No, I don't even have a scrap box.  Just a stash box.
---
I‚Äôve been reporting that t 65 doesn‚Äôt even have a variety of head lamps to choose. 
---
We T 65 players feel like simps compaired to other PA users flashing their high powered lights into our faces.
---
good profile pic broü¶ó
---
just did it - worked fine for me and the group i did it with.  Just saying this because that means it isnt always bugged - sometimes it works.
---
Yeah, I have it but dont want to have to rebuild my base so I dont use it.
---
I believe it's a huge driving force behind duping as well. The odds of getting really good rolled weapons and armor is so small that when one is found, it gets duped to hell.
---
Of course everyone wants nice items. Good gear is generally obtainable to every player of most games after enough time investment. However, not this game. You could play for years and never once see an ideally rolled piece of armor or gun drop for you, let alone an entire set.
---
So is it a good idea to base an economy on what basically amounts to winning lottery tickets? Well that's not my point or goal with this observation.
---
I feel the same,also at 2k hours and man I luv this game but its getting really annoying now.it just wont stop,ever
---
Nothing. *Nothing.* The only gunfire was mine, and occasionally a tesla rifle at the adds.
---
Just finished it and got the mask. Don't die and you will be fine
---
remember how yesterday we felt bad for console? Well not any more, they are saving ammo, durability, and precious time
---
+karma
---
Best of luck and good hunting!  I have a feeling they will make a return in future events.
---
Is that guy cramming ammo?
---
Deathclaw island is about the same location as Blennerhasset Island is in the Ohio River IRL. I wish they would've made the island a little larger and included Blennerhasser Mansion in the game. You could have a mansion taken over by Deathclaws giving a nice little horror element to it!
---
If you are on pc- it was fixed today. If you are on console it is fixed later in the week.
---
This. It's really easy to look up builds and spec a character to match your play style. I consider myself casual and have an effective build because I just read up on what works well.
---
Needs to be higher up =/ 
---
Had no bugs during the event, I could respawn normally and was able to fast travel to the event, but having to fight at 10 FPS is terrible.
---
Usually the game runs for me at around 100 FPS, and in the Event it was max 50 fps, with the average probably less than 25..
---
not the easiest thing in the world especially with the fear attack ur literally saying ‚Äújust don‚Äôt die lol‚Äù
---
worked fine for me other than some slowdown in the escape sequence
---
I died a few times and suddenly the mine is collapsing, unless someone kill the thing three times in a few secs, the mine would have killed the thing.
---
And I got my rewards anyway, weird.
---
So anyone who gets the respawn bug cannot rejoin the event unlike other events where you can. It has happened twice now. This has ruined the fun
---
Ironically, switching headlamp mods is one of the ways you can supposedly fix the issue of it aiming to the right.
---
Next week probably. They always split bundles to double charge. In terms of the commies stuff it's like 4 different bundles.
---
I would be alright with this if they removed a great number of the more useless legendaries. After an hour of gameplay you can get a ton of of them now and none actually feel legendary.
---
"Sometimes it works."
---
Hey Bethesda marketing team, you might want to get in on that.
---
This. I used to do QA for software (not games though), and half the stuff I pointed out was ignored as low priority by the devs... That usually came back to bite them in the ass.
---
Oh I liked the look of this and was going to buy it, thanks for this post! üëç
---
I‚Äôll wait till it‚Äôs fixed
---
"Don't die" sure blame players for a respawn bug.
---
I mean you do hear early on that some of the raiders are disgruntled with Meg and are convinced she's gone soft.
---
Yeah, switch to one fusion. That will create much more space for you.
---
Mine too.   I haven‚Äôt been online since last night and when I logged in today an hour after they reset mine were completed too.
---
It's also going to be interesting to see the fallout (sry for the pun) on here when it does hit, this place will be on fire, holy shit it'll be bad
---
Might be a pc thing?
---
Holy shit lmao
---
If your not Red your dead! By the sickle and by the hammer the wasteland will become a becon of communism superiority
---
Why do people like this again? Was this what allowed you to wallpaper both sides?
---
I'd rather not have cursed B2525 handmades and fixers dominate the trading community, thank you very much.
---
Huh that is interesting. Didn‚Äôt know about that one.
---
No kidding. Doing events this weekend an nobody understands how to simply walk down a hall an collect ore or turn on a switch..
---
Just finished the quest 4 minutes ago, you are given 3 options, where you can give her the locket but say her father was gone, give her the locket and say his father turned into a monster, or use a Charisma check of 8 to lie and say you found absolutely nothing.
---
JFC, this is it.  76ers become walking tanks with power armor and rapid fire death or invisible monsters that murder at will, Armed with a literal nuclear arsenal.  Reconstruction is limited to personal needs.
---
We are the pacification unit.  Secure the area and establish a currency for the rebuilders to work with.
---
Fucking hell dude sorry
---
You can use the rug or poster glitch to get power in there.
---
I just wish they kept the forest as a safe zone for newbies to gear up and level. The rest of this I'm fine with other then the pistols I mean they just became viable builds then nerf. 
---
I like having a variety that I can switch between when I get bored with one thing I was able to switch but it doesn't seem like that's an option anymore. Pistols are the most fun for me but then again the majority of these updates gave players like me the finger. 
---
Between that and the completely awful rng system I mean I feel like I won't be getting any 3 star drops after this because the only time I would was on enemies less then 50.
---
With proper care and cleaning, a few years.
---
Yes, but what is her reaction?
---
I had so much of an over flow of legendaries I was selling them at 10caps per scrip. Lots of Good rolls for sell at 400 caps just so I could clear stash space.
---
He‚Äôs tanky, that‚Äôs for sure, but if you have a group of people he is totally doable. Managed to record my second attempt of killing him and will be adding a link to the video if you want to see how it went.
---
It's ok, I just thought you were genuinely asking and thought a link would explain things quickly Lol ‚ô°
---
Next week, they always split up bundles to try an squeeze more atoms out of people.
---
Haven't played it but check out Captain Noob and/or Angry Turtle's vids to get some tips. Basically, it is recommended to be on a team, largely so that if you die the boss' health doesn't regenerate. Also, watch out for environmental hazards and know where the exit is.
---
Sounds more like they went past the budget using the camp glitch. I had a camp at 171% using the glitch and it took a while to load and was laggy/glitchy and if more than 2 people were around you would get the no controls error.  Anything past 125% starts getting funky.   
---
Hell I have just 100% budget but I placed my camp module on top of a phone polle and built 4 towers connected 7 high even with only 52% budget being visible to other players it takes a bit to load in, which makes me now think it may have to do with the size of each object Currently just 55 upper floors layed 12 of the 2x1 stairs 8 foundations 144 metal walls the red rocket building with lights 4 vendors all craftering and a 7 storage.  Last night coming in both times from the south it took 30-40 seconds to fully load.
---
So many legendary items I have scrapped for the steel as I have maxed out the scrip, it is absolutely ridiculously pathetic
---
prey mooncrash
---
Then you should finish in about 11 or 12 days if you do all the dailies and weeklies. If you are indeed 15 ranks away (Rank 85), you would be 93 next Monday with none of the repeatable challenges complete. Which isn't feasible if you get the level up challenge done daily. But, either way, if you complete all of your weekly challenges next Tuesday, you'll finish Sunday, August 30th. Perhaps sooner if you factor in occasional repeatable challenges and whatever "bonus" challenges come next week.
---
This is all based on the spreadsheet that was posted a few weeks ago. I made my own copy, so I can't share it. But maybe someone has a link?
---
I tried the event the other day and didn't get any notification the wendigo colossus died since I turned around to take on the spawns and to head out of the mine. When I realized everyone else was gone and ran out I got caught in the cave in by the exit and couldn't move and due to being over encumbered I couldn't fast travel either so I gave up and went back to the live server.
---
Suggestion to better the event
---
1 an alert to all players in the area that he died and to get out.
---
2 an auto teleport once cave in occurred
---
3 a chest outside the event that collect all loot dropped in the cave to prevent people from feeling they missed out on it.
---
Go to a power armor workstation and while in its menu on the modify section equip the pieces there.
---
Should show a button to press to equip selected power armor.
---
‚ÄúThanks, Bethesda‚Äù
---
Those little blue gens are worth it. They're silent and they stack nicely.
---
Yup. Insta died while trying to clear wendigo spawns off of the people with the big guns, when the fear attack inspired my person to go hug a drill bit.
---
There‚Äôs a reason the taking one for the team perk is theirs - because they swarm you and most builds can only hit one at a time.
---
lol. I was adding that because i didnt want to suggest that the posters experience wasnt true - and i only did it one time so not really enough material to know wheter it mostly works or mostly not works.
---
Apparantly i said someting offensive - dont know if it is the part where i said the event worked or the part where i said "sometimes it works" -- ohh well
---
It just happened to me, dropped a nuke on the mine, fast traveled to the event, waited 3(?) minutes for shaft to open AND... got teleported right outside...
---
Had fun.
---
Had no problems like this on PTS servers.
---
Same problem here, did the event 2 times and both time died with respawn bug and couldnt rejoin. Im done with the game for today
---
Holy crap do we need a where the fuck is the body emote so badly!
---
I choose to say I found the locket but her father turned into a monster, her reaction was at first horror then mournful, saying that he would always remember her father as a human, and not a beast.
---
Yep welcome to fallout 76
---
Word on the street is that the Communist Bundle has significant issues. (Shallow base on the bunker leads to floating, fences create awkward gaps at the bottom) It‚Äôs a bummer. I really dig them. üòû
---
It is...to some degree, I got disconnected a few times but was able to complete it on another server, assuming you don't cop the respawn bug. No idea wtf is causing it, but hopefully something Bethesda can fix on their side, afaik this wasn't happening in the PTS.
---
I want my Enclave themed emotes. Goose stepping and roman salutes would be really faschionable.
---
Level 31 amateur ! 
---
I go to the river by wayward and drink 200 dirty waters as soon as I leave the vault ! 
---
Then buy every nuka grape I find and milk every Brahmin 
---
Full on Muti :)
---
I then buy every useful  serum i find  so that when I get starched genes I can get the mutations I need
---
I died once randomly. Full health to nothing. Other than that me a no PA shotgunner stims build 200+, a unyielding bloodied build 250+, and a lvl 15 guy beat it in like 5 minutes. So underwhelming. Thanks for The 5 minutes of fun Bethesda hope you did nt have too many sleepless nights making this a reality. Honestly felt like me and the lvl 15 did nt even need to be there. I just cleared mobs the whole time.
---
Haha, I'm not sure. He had no idea where he was going either :P
---
I also wish you could sell items with bulk prices, like 10 .38 for 5 caps or something.
---
just done it on pc works great :)
---
Just did it, here are the loot highlights:
---
Cursed Harpoon with Furious, 50% Limb damage, 90% reduced weight (event reward)
---
Bloodied, 50% Limb damage, 90% reduced weight death law gauntlet
---
110 screws
---
Just go without Starbucks for 2 days and there you go.
---
Someone already posted a bug saying the red commie PA in t65 head light flashes out their right arm.
---
oh yeah, i forgot about that too
---
Thats what I did, but its constantly spawning wendigos and not getting hit for 15 seconds proved to be a bit of a challenge, but I did get out.
---
At least you got to play
---
I haven't done it yet so I can't really say tbh
---
I want my rude gesture emote. I need people know I really mean that.
---
So they increased the budget that small generators take?
---
We can build a fusion generator but can't drill a hole in concrete for a chain link fence post?
---
I found a really REALLY flat bridge near the gorge with the thunderbird nailed to the wall...
---
The bunker floated...
---
May have been me, I recognize you from my post I made not too long ago lol.
---
Power Conduits through the wall maybe?
---
nerf to dmg and one apalachia making enemies stronger will make most of the builds unplayable and builds that are left super unfun so people will have to choose between horrible gameplay of shooting enemies 30 times before they die or becoming meta players
---
People aren't very bright.
---
This has been happening the whole season. Nothing new, but incredibly annoying.
---
I actually like them. 
---
V94 raids were a mess. This one feels like a dumbed down but fun horde mode.
---
wait did they drop the commie stuff finally? like the commie commander outfit?
---
Hello ;)
---
I hate that I‚Äôm really tempted to get the bunker bundle
---
Steel Dawn army fatigues.
---
Technically no, but they do come up with some really awesome suppressed revolver designs. Usually slightly moving the cartridge forward to meet up with a seal to help reduce escaping gasses.
---
And lets you put power through walls without using conduit.
---
2nd try. Seems good so far. Edit: Nope, same as before.
---
For the love of God, it's not script.  It's scrip.
---
I want the 'team' emote that has the nuke explosion animation, the salute emote, the black faschnat floors, oh and the grognak rug! I got the grognak bundle for the emote (which has been broken since the day after I got it ffs) and was disappointed the rug wasn't part of that.
---
It starts thursday
---
Starts on Thursday I believe.
---
Too busy being staggered by the little ones.
---
I think this Thursday cause of the colussuss problem event was releasing today.
---
Nah that‚Äôs season 2 legendary run
---
Na sorry man I paid 100 bucks at release and 15 for a month 1st but I don't put more money into this game lol
---
Low level players 10% damage is a huge difference, it already takes loads of bullets for a low level to kill things, and with melee weapons hit hard by the strength beef, they don't have melee weapons to fall back on!
---
This is why the automotron dlc was so cool, you could have your settlement be guarded by some killer robots. Also, assaultrons make excellent caravans
---
Cant wait for cyberpunk üòÅ
---
http://imgur.com/a/lnucph2
---
I use the same trick. Gives you some fun options
---
Try to disable mods if you have any...
---
I used the free atoms from the run to finish the last few levels since I won‚Äôt be able to play this week.
---
That's a really good idea
---
Are there really more Communist items than USA themed stuff?
---
September 8th most likely
---
Commie outfit bundle that comes with outfit back pack pipboy skin, then the red shift green PA armor the commie camp bundle the flags wall paper and floor, this commie red scare camp bundle and Red PA armor skin. That's like 4 already üòÇüòÇ only one I dont have is wall paper floor and flags as those dont do anything for me.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt know why Bethesda even bothers giving dates for their updates, they are clearly incapable of reaching deadlines and shouldn‚Äôt bother building people‚Äôs hopes up when things are inevitably going to be delayed. They either need to set realistic timelines for themselves or just say ‚Äúthe update will come out when it‚Äôs ready, we have no clue when that will be‚Äù
---
Yes please. I have a BE/JE pipe rifles collecting dust.
---
The only chaotic moment about this event is when you look for the damned exit.
---
Seen this posted many times today. Many times. Like a lot.
---
No mods :&lt;
---
Thursday
---
Can the bunker survive nukes like it says in the description? That would be pretty cool. Might be worth committing science on, just to see.
---
You can buy the Blood Eagle Bundle to get the Angry Fist Shake Emote. Sadly it's locked behind the bundle and not in the emote category in the Atomic Shop.. Edit: As an Emote Collector I find this disappointing
---
Fun twist, the cursed shovel should result in the skeleton becoming a charred ghoul with a chance of being legendary during Buried with Honors
---
I believe it was Plato who said 'For you!'
---
Not soon enough
---
Wow thanks for the heads up
---
Some people already reporting multiple crashes lol.
---
It's not about having a higher lvl toon. It's about the ability to do respecs and having a full set of cards to play with. I've swapped my specials so many times and now those points are just gone.
---
I didn‚Äôt see them till it happened to me.
---

---
When the spaceship reaches the end. Either yours. Or his
---
Thanks. I'm at level88 I should make it.
---
Wait so really you just have to shoot the boss, my whole group was just that weak... I am more sad now then thinking that I was missing some special thing that had to be done. Also in that case I should have just looted more screws...
---
i was thinking about getting the fences. guess ill get the junk ones instead
---
Not for long, see PTS damage nerf.
---
Wait these more commie stuff ü§©ü§©üòç the only items I haven't gotten are floors flags and wall paper but everything else is great.
---
I agree its weaker, but in this game pipe weapons shoot rubber bullets for some reason.
---
Shoot fusion cells at the enemy...then electrocute them!
---
Or dogs...or dogs that shoot bees when they bark!
---
I want the tenderizer plan so that I can have more space in my stash.  They are heavy and I have 4 of them.  They take up way too much space.
---
They could do so much more with them. They could add new pipe variants, such as pipe shotguns, pipe SMGs and pipe LMGs and allow many more unique mods, like the reflex sights you get on guns like the handmade and more ammunition variants
---
Shame as I‚Äôve been looking forward to this as it‚Äôs be delayed so many times and still broken and buggy!
---
Copy that, thanks!
---
Im aftaid it's the last week but I hope im wrong .
---
Instead of it multiplying together it will just be added together...I think
---
Yeah that‚Äôs worked out well again lol.
---
Very rare.  I had to trade for mine.
---
Ah yes... decimal health.
---
i guess you‚Äôve been good this year and santa todd‚Äôs not shoving coal up your ass and is letting you finish the even normally
---
Are the Cursed weapons (lol)tradable? Also, *how does a single fire weapon get a fire rate bonus?*
---
Oh ok.
---
Sounds good.i have some odd stuff displayed. Like inert bombs.looms like c4 from modern warfare and I have 3 large gifts I can give you 1 of those as well.there are 3 separate ones a brown green and a shiny red one
---
If you die and your team kills the boss while you are dead, you spawn outside with no possibility of entering the mine again (as far as I know) so goodbye boss loot.
---
Is the olive one for sale this week? Been waiting a couple of months to buy it since it was taken out the first time
---
I want to know if you get a full ultracite fusion core/plasma core if you use those weapons.
---
I mean that's a lot of ammo...but going around and collecting it all would take so long
---
Why not? What do people have against variety? Plus, it only adds to the shit tier drop list and we all know how much fun it is to get a bloodied rolling pin.
---
"I watched a video and now I'm mad" is about half the jackwagon posts on this forum.
---
If those are ammo factories, that guy can kiss his account goodbye
---
This is not the only post about it. Any info you can share?
---
99% sure it's just a prefab. We're not at the "Instanced Camp Interiors" stage yet
---
At this point I just can laugh about their incompetence.
---
In the 1st try my whole team died, so yeah no loot for that
---
4 were server side and 1 was client where the entire game crashed back to my Xbox dashboard.
---
Ah ok that makes sense, thought they were pulling a fast one lol
---
Bad enough now with the rumors...yeah, that will make for some interesting reading if they don't get some fixes in.
---
Working just fine. Done 2 times now without any issues.
---
Free standing on the ground - yes it works. And yes 8 snap points is cool.
---
But it (a) doesn‚Äôt have a gate (b) doesn‚Äôt snap to foundations and (c) if you stand it on a foundation has a huge gap at the bottom.
---
I think you missed your chance.
---
The Olive chinese PA was on sale few weeks ago.
---
It will come on sale again at some point. Don't worry, save your atoms.
---
wish i saw this post earlier üòî
---
Lol double dipping
---
Do I have to purchase a scrap kit?  I haven't ever found one and I don't know how to craft it.
---
not surprised.
---
Its your health.
---
Imagine a minigun with a silencer üòÇ
---
The train car makes a great exterior wall for a CAMP with some sort of perimeter barrier.
---
Mine is nestled near a body of water with a wooden foundation "dock" with water purifiers towards the end.
---
It's a really cool structure and I think the prefabs tend to be much better optimized for rendering which allows for more efficient budgeting.
---
I tested out an AA/E handmade and a B/E fixer versus bots at Watoga.  The AA was only like 20 points less damage.
---
We‚Äôll get em next time.
---
Thanks for the spreadsheet. I was looking for it but could not  find it.
---
Here is my proposition: all pipe weapons are capable of using junk ammunition. 
---
Junk ammunition does same damage as regular but is only usable by pipe weapons and can be crafted in huge numbers for low cost.
---
Gauss Rifle, halfway there. Maybe if they ever introduce different ammunition options...
---
They should‚Äôve just released it when they originally planned. Bethesda releases are just always going to have bugs at this point and mandatory hotfixes AND delays is getting kinda old
---
How do you find out what's in season 2?
---
I‚Äôm confused. Are any of the rewards of even the theme for the next season already known? How do you know there will be more communist stuff ‚Äúafter the next legendary run?‚Äù
---
Yeah this is typical Bethesda/FO76 stuff.
---
O god this bold post makes me not want to even read this and immediately comment how much I hate it.
---
(Ofc I have double vision and it‚Äôs hard to read a post like this.)
---
No. Can't remember what's it it but I think it is the door, stairs, and clean nuka cola machine that is like the punch bowl/kegs.
---
not really, i died combatting the wendigo boss, i respawned dead at the top of the mineshaft, and i had to respawn at the overlook, when i got back to the mine the rocks were boarded up, the event marker also wasnt there anymore so i couldnt just teleport in 
---
same happened in the nuclear silos, if i died i respawned dead in the elevator so i had to respawn outside
---
Well then removing the perk would turn the pet hostile.
---
Bold statement
---
I've always wanted some udders so Bethesda could milk me like the Cow i am.
---
How bad was the event a month ago?
---
I want a junk cannon! 
---
I have a sneaky suspicion they are pumping stuff out to burn people‚Äôs stored atoms, then they will drop some brotherhood stuff people can‚Äôt say no to and rake in the cash.
---
Those are wonderful ideas! Ive always struggled with the huge concrete slab it's attached to. Like the circus trailer, I sort of wish there was no concrete, the builds would feel a bit more lore friendly
---
I wish the Carivan Trader outfit would come back. I really love the fur around the neck and the shoulder guard.
---
Or "Bonus Challnege Week" as the event page says under Deliver Plastic, heh.
---
But we aren‚Äôt hundreds of years past a nuclear war in this one.
---
No it isn't, watch the videos again or look at the PTS gameboard the outfits on that are subjugator and the maoist youth looking uniform
---
These are great!
---
There is end game. It is the same useless end game that exists in any other game were you grind out the few bosses until you get the pointless shiny shit you think looks good. Then you repeat the same thing with the next content update.
---
Same here.
---
I had one guy on PTS (reported him btw) using hacked mininukemachinegunthingy and the frames dropped to like 2. Usually steady \~60.
---
What makes you say that?
---
Isn't it obvious more than half the playerbase here are exploiters? You forget how this forum went into a full rage mode when Bethesda started banning dupers? I don't take people here seriously no more. Oh, and embrace yourself for downvotes
---
They need to allow us to scrap legendaries for modules.
---
Bethesda never fails to disappoint. Never.
---
I gUEss We SHoULD NeRF LEGENd DrOP RAteS THen - Todd Howard Aug 2020
---
Cyberpunk 2077 comes out in November on the 18th though. So that‚Äôs like 2 months right
---
Boooo! My communist base looks like Putin did a pootin in it.
---
Same, died just as the event finished
---
Guys if it is to link me to old ¬´¬†dataminers¬†¬ª post there is no point, once again anyone soloing her will confirm you that she is like paper when there is less than 4 players, and much harder if there are more players.. facts please. And if you never soloed her you will not understand..
---
It didn't work last week, it still didnt work this week, but hey, let's move on to "fixing" other stuff.
---
What commie commander outfit are you talking about if not the subjugator one?
---
Lmao same
---
&gt;to event again as this should be r
---
Can you please fix the reflection bug on amd cars? All guns and metal surface look like shit, with zebra like reflections,  since wastelanders. Is this how the game is going to look forever on my pc? I tried everything.
---
How much are you hoarding?
---
oh god theryre gonna patch that out, arent they?
---
While I‚Äôm generally pretty lenient with this stuff as plenty of sandbox games have huge flaws and Bethesda sandboxes have a huge amount of live objects. I‚Äôm getting tired of their logic to fix things no one asked to have changed in place of obviously crucial patches that they ignore for months or years... some admin needs to be let go.
---
Bethesda said in a q&amp;a on here a while back that they don‚Äôt have text chat on pc because no one would use it.
---
Lmao as a pc player, you got me.
---
Same. This has happened to me both times now.
---
Lol I can't get on til tonight, but if I see this I'm for sure dropping a nuke.
---
My quest for him has been bugged before the videos came out. Ive never had to fast travel to pick up the item. Its hella weird.
---
I've said this to my gaming buddies. They should get a similar management style of ESO, cause obviously it works for that game.
---
You could bait them either way. If it's only death bag, then let yourself get killed.
---
After the legendary run idk man it‚Äôs hard to keep interest in a game that doesn‚Äôt care abt its player base so i might quit like you
---
Can we get a video demonstrating these issues? I'm skeptical of both fanboys *and* haters that this game attracts. Hyperbole is abound.
---
Never came up with auto complete ever so that keeps me going
---
Yeah, I was just commenting on how stealth commando is basically the 76 version of a stealth archer. I started a second character that‚Äôs a full health power armor heavy gunner and it‚Äôs more fun than my bloodied stealth commando, even if it does kill a little slower and have lower special stats.
---
Some people are just assholes, try to remember to stash your junk before traveling to random camps.
---
If you didnt find it
---
This happens to me every time I die.  You don't have to disconnect, just fast travel anywhere that costs like 5 caps or more and it'll spawn correctly.  If you FT too close to where you died it doesn't work.  I hate it!
---
  I am a melee build as well.  First silo I ran (the one near grafton steel), I had no perks for heavies.  Did it in power armor with a troublshooters gatling.  
---
Later learned the more people in the silo, the more enemies you face.
---
Best you can do for now is set up base at an NPC spawn point. They should still spawn, giving you at least the illusion of more allys
---
Yeah.  At that point, I would have left.   One way or another.
---
I've gotten two dropped. The trick is apparently to nuke Whitespring rather than the SBQ
---
Ah shit, been waiting to snag it since I got my first piece of Strangler armor which was like unfortunately a week after it left the store
---
Same mine has been like that since I first did his quest
---
Have you tried this yourself?
---
No worries. I know bloodied builds aren't for everyone, I tried it early on and it wasn't for me, but now i'm a convert. My most recent character is another bloodied stealth commando and they're by far my favourite builds, plus the insane level up speed is addictive, I just logged off and I'm L235 after 15 days play, that's just nuts. My first character, heavy gunner, took a year to do that.
---
Either way if you have a mate to help you power level by taking you round West Tek or The Whitesprings a few you'll level up quicker, but it looks like they're going to kill that with the next patch and the great rebalance so get in quick.
---
Lol yes
---
Oh such a potentially exploitable bug! Try and see if both chest piece mods work. It would be cool if you could double up emergency protocols and jetpack. Or two leg pieces for each side with calibrated shocks for double carry capacity.
---
Many many times
---
Helps put wallpaper side out as well without having to drop extra foundations. Makes time building significantly quicker.
---
They need to change it. A system like at launch where you're punished for making mistakes is one thing, but adding respecs only to reintroduce this penalty two years later is awful.
---
Bloody build myself....entering uranium fever I‚Äôll switch to an auto pipe rifle tag the legendary once or twice and (hit the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emote if enough time) and run away. Usually into another mole miner. I learned the hard way when I killed one and got 3 thumbs down so I coughed up the drop.  Luckily it was just a 1* revolver.
---
Others who bought the bundle have not mentioned this.
---
If it‚Äôs bad, they won‚Äôt release it until it‚Äôs fixed
---
Until this backfires because they're a looting ninja that hoovers it up right out from under you while you're struggling to find that sweet spot. This happened to me after the SBQ fight. I died while looting her, and as I ran up to the tiny bit of blue canvas visible from under her wing, some beyotch in power armor appears out of nowhere, literally pushes me away from my struggles with the bag, and it's gone in an instant. They must've recognized the desperate sprint of a man who wants his crap sack back, and declared "I shall have that". And you did, you magnificent bastard. Again, I don't know how they found it and took it so fast.  I had a marker showing me where it was and I could still barely find it because of the SBQ corpse almost completely covering it.
---
After the fact it was goddamned hilarious, but in the moment I was pissed.
---
I‚Äôm assuming u run ninja and covert operative still tho?
---
I was thinking more like a middle finger or the two finger thing people in the UK and Australia do.
---
Can you explain the terrain glitch more in your video?  I understood it all until that part as I'm not really sure how you were able to get it to sink down.
---
Also, that video was definitely amusing.
---
Same. Died running out because of the endless Wendigo spawns... Spawned outside. As far as I know you only miss a chest with... Materials?
---
I bought it and it floats
---
Can‚Äôt all floating issues be resolved with dirt tiles?
---
They reintroduced it to the shop about two months ago! That‚Äôs weak you missed it :(
---
That‚Äôs what I thought when I accidentally donated. I figured I got more rep
---
They can be found in the atomic shop. If you do purchase them you will find them under "miscellaneous"  in your Pip-Boy. What I really like is that you don't have to scrap at a workbench, you just click on a scrap kit under miscellaneous and it automatically scraps the junk and sends it into your scrap box or your stash.
---
Everything floats down here.
---
Have you played through the main quest and Wastelanders as well?  There are a number of places you encounter the faction or their prior presence.
---
I've lost a ton of items due to one o my characters rolling back 5-20 minutes. Support won't do anything about the character or the items. 
---
I'd suggest not transferring items ever, tbh due to that.
---
What‚Äôs up with this f76 mrbeast persona, I feel like it ruined your message 
---
And if anything exploiting, and in this case duping, is good for people like you who want to be generous, making rare items accessible for newer players
---
Cool.  I verified I do have a few robot plans.  I probably won‚Äôt be on again until later tonight - not sure what time.  If you still need them, 
---
psn is aj ninetyeight and AJ-98 in game.
---
Character itself - 268/353  
---
full stash box  
---
scrapbox - totally not more 50k of junk
---
When it‚Äôs the 27th post in two days on exactly the same subject then it‚Äôs pretty grating. Or the 27274 posts about being able to build what we want as much as we want wherever we want that‚Äôs also extremely annoying. To those people I point out they‚Äôve mistaken fo76 for Minecraft.
---
Yeah, it'll be a bitch. You have to FT in there... I needed 6 tries. Highly frustrating, more so to just keel over when trying to get out, and missing on the "rewards".
---
I would hold off on the bunker. In the next legendary run a brotherhood bunker will be a reward.
---
Do you mean real guns?
---
the mass is dumb af.  
---
but then, there is light. today, i joined a building team as always. building team means to me, everyone gets the bonus and takes care of himself, do whatever you want. feed the people popped up and i joined it for the yummy stew. was alone at first, then one from my team joined in. without any problems, he went for the stairs to guard the upper machine, i stayed downstairs. easiest event ever. then i made this and these until project paradise popped up. i like it very much and dont mind solo a habitat, so i went there and the same guy popped in again. we collected the stuff together, he healed me as i got downed bc of stupidity, we both followed our glowing deathclaw and took care of the evil little ants (always funny to see that gigantic thing running from ants...), killed the sheepsquatch together and it just felt right. i never had so much fun during an event, knowing you got backed up by a reliable guy. its these moments you think back when entering radiation rumble to see 3 guys not moving from the center, one shooting everything while 2 others are afk at the entrance.   
---
thanks team buddy, i forgot your gt but i added you and will gladly join every fight with you from now on.
---
Follow through on my sniper get maxed first, then supplements for int, charisma and luck.  Poison and fire resist sound useful, too.
---
Can you snap it on an angle? I‚Äôd assume no, but I‚Äôd hope yes.
---
Been wondering if people will catch a ban on this? I wanna do it but effort if banhammer follows
---
I already own the original commie PA they released, gonna be an easy pass this week.
---
Gimme that vertibird PA come on Bethesda
---
A good tip for a junkies rifle build is to find an explosive pipe revolver, they sometimes go cheap as players don't realise how good they are. If you put a long stock on it they benefit from both Gunslinger and Rifleman perks, so you get a massive 120% extra damage.
---
I mean it is a communist fence....dont hate me üòÇ
---
I have zero issues with items floating in mine.
---
Way overpriced
---
Russia was defeated for the most part in lore its only China play through wastelanders
---
&gt; lvl69, 420AP
---
_Nice_.
---
This wasn't funny the last six times I saw the same line either.
---
Ah yes. The good old whack a mole game.
---
I saw someone asking 15k for a bloodied explosive Gatling laser come on man it‚Äôs only 2* I‚Äôll maybe give you a few hundred for that trash. /s
---
How is his opinion impacting on you. Here‚Äôs a radical thought. Look at the post header. And if it mentions something that annoys you with whinging. And they annoy me too.....don‚Äôt open it!  Don‚Äôt read it. I know it‚Äôs difficult but I‚Äôm sure you can do it.
---
They went to metro lol
---
Sure. What you‚Äôre looking for is a part of the ground that will let what you‚Äôre moving sink down a bit and still show green.  What happens is when you place it while it‚Äôs slightly below ground the bottom one is pushed up to ground level while the item on top remains in the same position. 
---
I use this trick to fill shelves with stuff as well.
---
First rule of PvP club is you don't talk about it on the fo76 subreddit üòÅ. Glad to hear you had fun. This sub could use some happy PvP stories.
---
Fast travel in seems fixed by reports but respawning seems broken still. Idk, I'm just reading threads because I'm on xbox and cant actually do the content
---
If you play on PS4 and want to know who to avoid, message me.
---
Pretty soon yes there will be.
---
Just wait until the nerfs are live ... .)
---
How does this get missed in PTS?
---
Finished it 5 days ago, feels great not having to log in everyday anymore.
---
Covert op yes. Agility is 12 with max dodgy, adrenaline and escape artist also. Really no need for xtra melee damage when the DCG does around 3k....for now lol.
---
Another, more risky, way to remove it is to have enemies or buildable traps attack it. If you build a flamethrower next to the factory and activate it, the factory will take damage. Once sufficient damage has been dealt, the ammo factory will temporarily despawn, until repaired.
---
I think I‚Äôve just added you as a friend can you check? Thanks in advance
---
I have this weird combination of roof, foundation, railing and poles forming a porch... I'm ready to upgrade, save on budget and look way better
---
Because sometimes you'd find him floating 10 feet in the air, body melded with a guard and impossible to click on, or deserting Foundation and standing 300 feet outside of town.
---
Even tho I was completely against the multiplayer aspect of 76 when it first came out i will miss it when I move to cyberpunk
---
That‚Äôs when you make a meat bomb and blow it up
---
I've been watching people play this event online, and I haven't seen anyone else with this issue (and *plenty* of people are dying).  It might be related to one of the other respawn bugs.
---
But they don‚Äôt even listen to the people on the PTS do they?
---
Why can't people appreciate this game for what it is? Y'all sound like spoiled brats who don't aren't getting what you want so you're throwing a fit. Just have fun or just uninstall.
---
Alright I appreciate it thank you
---
I‚Äôm currently leveling my alt to do as much melee damage per shot as I can. I‚Äôm confident I can get 20k out of my Powerfist quite easily
---
I'm talking about the number of items. I was experiencing freezes when I was hoarding many MANY weapons cause I was wearing 5 pieces of weight reduction armor. Was also hoarding holos and my game rarely freeze after I got rid of them
---
Raiders do exist in Fallout 76...
---
If you are willing to walk in thier camp..
---
Yep it's the respawn bug that they still haven't fixed. Your best bet is to just try not to die at all, and use some perks that will automatically stim you.
---
I hope this comment is satire.
---
I'm literally so new to the game I have no idea how to do it. I don't even know how he killed me.
---
Go into your Pip-Boy under "data", I forget what heading it's under but I think it's one of the miscellaneous, Make sure that you check mark it, allow it bring you to your map, it works the same way when you click the map for your dailies, and it should show you a small gold circle where the cargo bot would be. It keeps moving so be lickety split.
---
It‚Äôs up
---
Never even seen a trap room let alone fell for one, I visit tonnes of camps for vendors and never seen one before. I think you are over exaggerating
---
I already bought it. But I‚Äôm gonna ask for a refund.
---
the person i replied to had a brain fart, i forgot to edit my message, consider my previous reply null and void
---
It did.
---
I put a pylon on top to connect the rest and it works. Pylon gives it a good look aswell
---
That‚Äôs the only quest line I haven‚Äôt completed unfortunately. Only cause of the daily grind tbh but I‚Äôm close. That‚Äôs nicer to hear though at least. I know there is probably more out there than I have seen, for sure. But I still get a weird sense every time they add more Russian stuff that there would be a in-game communistic thing to go with it. For the most part I guess I‚Äôm just wondering why it seems more role play based than gameplay based
---
I'm \[relatively\] new to the game and had no idea what  the heck was going on.
---
So just like every other communist invention; it doesn‚Äôt work.
---
well great, it happened twice already.
---
At least you have a roof over your head. I‚Äôm living out of my tent and using my sheepsquatch plushie as a pillow. Rough times in the wastes...
---
The hotfix was just for PC today. Consoles later in the week.
---
You on PC
---
A great stealth build works so well in here.  I got caught by fear once when I got too close.
---
Yup, I already spent some atoms even tho I said to myself I won't :/ but I just sent you a request xD
---
Probs should do that
---
This is just as funny as the last six times I saw the same line
---
Do the Raider quest line. You‚Äôll be able to strap a bomb to a piece of meat. It somehow avoids all rules and will break the camp.
---
Good write up. But riding shotgun is def not guaranteed 3 star.
---
Fix it once it happens? No. Prevent it from happening? Load into an adventure mode server before checking the atom shop/legendary run board, preferably wait a minute or two after getting into the server before doing either of those things. Wait around a half hour before and after the daily reset before playing. Don't start off a session with NW, load into adventure first. And just get lucky enough to not have a crash while loading into the server.
---
why is it (out side of exploits) that people have to play the way you want them to play. There is room for all play styles. You can be a raider, BOS, settler  or asshol -.    if that is the way you want to play.
---
This is not a fallout 4 game and never was to be like that.  And this game is not about just helping people out. It is a survival game with risks from people and creatures.
---
Just my opinion friends.
---
Cav
---
\+/-15 weapons, full PA set, full unyielding set + mask and apparel, tons of aid
---
You‚Äôre not wrong
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
There‚Äôs a sub that has a name similar to r/fo76FilthyCasuals, it‚Äôs something like r/fo76FilthyFleaMarket
---
If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre using this for, you‚Äôre wiring up your camps wrong. Use the rug glitch instead, it‚Äôs way less janky looking
---
they fell from the sky, along with a bowl of petunias.

Second album
---
Damn i just wanted out of the fomo asap so when i was able to burn all my atoms to complete the rest, i very well did at the cost of my time and commitment. . .
---
Wait noooo I want that shit back as an outfit.
---
Yeah, that would happen to Rocksy for me a lot.
---
It didn't seem like it happened as much until they started trying to fix it before this static fix was implemented.
---
You can! 45 degrees or so, love it for marking off my entire perimeter. It doesn't go down quite far enough, however, on sharp inclines.
---
U have to look under it, it's pretty easy to miss
---
I haven't been following the respawn bug too closely (since I've only had something happen one time), maybe there's some info out there that could help.  I know weight was one thing I remember being an issue at one point, maybe related to bloody builds, but that's all I can remember right now.
---
I'm getting booted from the game anytime I try to go near the quest. I'm on PC
---
Depends on the weapon, I sold a bloodied/ffr Ultracite Gat a while back for 15k.
---
Same people selling ammo for more than a cap or two are likely also the ones selling common mounted plans for over 100 caps. Some just list it for what the game recommends.
---
I would definetly spend 10k+ on a 2* lever with good rolls and even more on a 3*. My first instigating lever I picked up out of a player vendor for 8k and never even bat an eye.
---
Can‚Äôt check at the moment.  avatar is a headshot of someone that might resemble Harley Quinn :)
---
Are you running Calibrated Shocks on your Ultracite as well? I‚Äôve been searching for the plan for months with no luck.
---
Ow dude same,I wasn‚Äôt gonna buy it cause of multiplayer,now I think it‚Äôs so awesome.i met so many nice people on the game and discord‚Äôs,hope next one will be multi to üòÅüëçüëå‚úåüèª
---
Nah. Your first sentence kinda annoyed me but I want through the whole thing cause I'm a nice person and I don't want to go like ignore you just because you wrote something I don't agree
---
The .308 Light Machine Gun
---
I too would like to know.
---
It did, it was included with the update.
---
The can rock late game too, stick a long stock on the revolver and you can use both Rifleman and Gunslinger perks, 120% extra damage. I had a BE pipe revolver that seriously kicked arse
---
This shit is so infuriating üñï
---
Oh wow! That's good to know
---
Somewhat unrelated but I saw it on sale during the quakecon sale, is mooncrash worth it? Prey is one of the games I bought ages ago but can't ever get around to finishing
---
Thank You for your review.   I previewed the bunker in build mode, noticed the shallow foundation and was perplexed that there was no interior feature for the gunports.  Would have been nice to have some interior nooks and some window slit or something.  It also kinda bothered me how the reinforcement ribbing inside doesn't smoothly transition to the ceiling.  Kind of an abrupt angle change.  Kind of a shame as the entrance/door seems pretty neat.   The fences also look pretty nice and I've had good luck with using the junk walls.  Too bad it sounds like these are much more hasslesome.
---
Cork was completed by Bethesda decreasing the goal by an order of magnitude during that donation event.
---
Glanced at your posts. You bitch and moan as much as anyone üòÇ
---
Lol, I actually did work as a dev at a game company. But I just made the physics engine and physics network sync code work. If there was a problem with physics, it was *always* important.
---
Oh man I hope those greenhouse bits are individual parts and not a single pre-fab building. I built a triple geodesic dome base connected by a metal hallway, and it would look much better if the hallway was all glass too.
---
I made mine look great. Its way bigger than the shed. Dont know what your talking about there
---
Ooh. That‚Äôs tempting. I can finally make a zoo with non-square exhibits.
---
Share the xp but maybe idk decrease it a little? Maybe not as well. Its like a mix for me you know
---
let me sum up for you:
---
nothing says 'I am a chinese covert spy' better than a suit and backpack with a giant chinese star on it.  Who would ever think that person was a covert spy?  It's the guy WITHOUT the giant chinese red star that you would be looking for right?
---
Here come the commies to save you!
---
People already have trouble just defending the machines at uranium fever, they rather just run circles!
---
There is a server limit to how many can spawn.  Don't remember if it resets after a cooldown period or whatever but just keep trying different servers.  Once the limit is hit it gives the message you are seeing.
---
People are probably farming more cards than usual for the new event.
---
Trump?
---
The game provides infinite means of disposing of your unwanted legendary gear. It's called leaving them on the corpses, dropping them on the ground, shoving them inside a suitcase or pawing them off on a robot vendor. You know, what everyone used to do with their leftover legendaries before scrip existed. Scrip is just supposed to be a small bonus every day for turning in some of your drops.
---
just don‚Äôt die lol
---
What am I looking at?
---
He's not coming
---
Seems like real life
---
Post a pic of it.
---
Oh man you know it. Laggy mcLaggyface
---
Bashing is one of the components to make it ‚Äúmagic‚Äù iirc. So your LMG is doing a lot more damage than you think it is
---
I'll put legendaries up for crazy amounts so that they are easier to take out of the stash. They need to up the scrip you can get in a day
---
My spoiled vegetables for 1000 caps is very reasonably priced thankyouverymuch
---
Over pricing things is stupid. They're just going to sit in your vendor, taking up space and on the off chance someone is stupid enough to buy something marked up that much, with how many people complain about the 30k cap limit, odds are you won't even get the full amount of the sale because you'll max out your caps.
---
Or I guess it could also just be lazy and people are just going with the amount of caps the game suggests.
---
I price items to move them. If I wanted them to indefinitely sit in my inventory I'd put them in my stash. Also my camp gets a lot of foot traffic from low levels so I get a steady inflow with 10-20 cap non-rare plans and 1 cap ammo.
---
Just try to stash as most as you can and walk around with minimum amount. Aids don't have much impact but weapons/armors/apparels sure do. I carry two weapons and a PA and a full unyielding set. No apperel other than ranger armor
---
Yeah. It's very frustrating. But what's worse is the weekly one auto completed. Now that one hurts. üòÇ
---
I remember when I was using a laser gatling at the time. So I needed the cores and someone tried to raid me. They had a bad day in short
---
It's just an xbox and bethesda thing. I play ps4 and only have issues when my internet acts up and I run off 1 or 2 mbps up and 1 or 2 mbps down and dont have issues unless my connection drops out for more than a few seconds.
---
 Only explanation is the servers bethesda has dedicated for xbox. 
---
I guess it could be a hardware thing, if you havent ever cleaned the console, either take it somewhere or clean it up well yourself. Many videos online about it. 
---
Your console could be over heating, and when it hits a certain core temp it will cease processes as to not damage the hardware.
---
It'll probably be a Sentinel or a Star Paladin. 
---
Either way, we'll fuck them up with whatever on hand.
---
Damn. I just wanna fight him
---
When will there be another item in the 1st member group?...Been like 2-3 months now it seems.
---
Yeah, if you die you can't rejoin the even and get nothing.
---
Me purchasing the red shift stuff when it first came out, ‚Äúglad I got that, Bethesda won‚Äôt release another communist bundle again!‚Äù
---
What bugs? Went fine for me
---
An atomic shop variety was costing less budget, so people were placing a small generator, storing them, then using the atomic shop variant to lower their camp budgets (or the other way around, I only watched it once, never tried it myself). This is how most build budget glitches work
---
I refuse to believe we met the cork challenge.
---
Right now the seedy shed, RR garage, and train car are all part of the same prefab group, of which you can have 3. So one of each, or 3 garages, or whatever. The log cabin is part of it‚Äôs own group of 3. Looks like the Blood Eagle nest and the bunker are now part of their own group of 3.
---
I do honestly believe it‚Äôs because the majority of FO76‚Äôs player base have no clue on the ‚ÄúMarket Trade Value‚Äù of items, be it on PC or consoles. In reality, only a small portion of players are active on trading platforms such as this. You‚Äôll see a Bloodied 1 star tire iron priced @ 5K...because hey...it‚Äôs Bloodied. Or you‚Äôll see an Ultracite Emergency Protocols Plan priced @ 1.5K. People just don‚Äôt know.
---
Edit: spelling
---
It's also nice for vending areas. You can put your machines in a room facing the windows, and when you don't want people to buy anything you can swap them for solid walls.
---
Maybe you are just cheap. Lol. No really. Over priced ammo sure, but weapons and armor are subjective. The market abides.
---
If you need a gallon of water, a tablespoon may be better than a teaspoon, but both suck. Now imagine that in order to use the tablespoon, you had to use it with one finger. That's a bloodied build on PTS. You're squishy as hell. On live, you compensate by killing stuff before it kills you, but on PTS, you can't out pace the damage barring certain weapons (legacy stuff and supposedly auto rifles, which I have not tested yet). That means that *the* high damage build is largely useless. Drop the tablespoon enough times, and it becomes faster to sue the teaspoon.
---
Please note, I am not concerned or complaining all that much. Bloody and Junkies needed a bit of rebalancing. And I rather suspect we'll see a mob balance pass on PTS soon (get damage consistent and it becomes much easier to balance damage resistance). But here and now, PTS is rough for most builds, even optimized ones.
---
That's because I only engage on annoying people. I don't comment on rational comments or posts
---
It is, cause it‚Äôs still a working build budget glitch on consoles.
---
Same. No way to get back in. Buggered.
---
There are those who exist in the game only to burn it down, which is ironically lore friendly. And those guys I dont mind so much (raider/mothman-ish camps), it's the guys who have thier camps set up all nice and friendly then pull the switcheroo on you when you think they're good guys.
---
I‚Äôll have no problem with hardened mass if they did this.
---
OK, thanks! I was wondering if I needed more code fragments or something
---
You go on with your bad self Karen
---
should be able to, i made a base of 4 train cars, and have seen multiple sheds
---
What's exciting about some fuck with a hacked weapon removing any difficulty or fun from a new event before you had even tried it yet?
---
OH man am I dreading those now. Thanks for the warning.
---
Enclave is the big one I want. Responders and free states already have plenty in game and in the shop, but the Enclave has one outfit. One.
---
All the notes were already in the stashbox, but I got tons of holos, moved them.   
---
Will try and see how it's going. Thank you!
---
Not before I nuke him you don't
---
The other kicker is they took off the mods and wasted the material, made it clothing and are now putting it back the way it was and making you waste more material modding them again. I remember telling the group I play with last year "Bethesda does not giveth, only taketh away." They keep proving me right.
---
The reason it lags the server is because of the machines adding ammo to the collection bin. Every 43 seconds, either 1 or 5 ammo of the selected choice are added.
---
For instance, if the owner chose 5.56, they would get 5 rounds per machine for every 43 seconds (One server tick). There are a fair few machines there, meaning the server is constantly adding ammo to the collection bins.
---
 This is what stresses the server to it's limit.
---
 There were obviously players on the server, so the server must load terrain, enemies, assets and items around those players. This is fine, as the server can handle this. However, once you begin spawning in hunderds of ammo per minute as well as placing multiple assets in a small area, the server begins to struggle. Add in particle effects and asset animations, and you can see why this grand demonstration of an exploit can quickly down a server.
---
Of course it was your weapon lol
---
I scrap all weapons or turn them in for scrip. As far as plans go anything good like ultra site plans I sell for 50 caps all other plans I sell for one.
---
Not much, I was near max budget and I was able to place about 15.
---
Yeah trap camps do still exist even after they took the measures with punji boards not being able to be stacked. Sorry to hear about you experiencing this as a newer player.
---
Did they buff Liberators recently or is every struggling person here under level 30?
---
They are less common now that punji boards aren't so easy to stack.
---
Teacher here, I‚Äôve had to go against my desire to not go bloody unyielding just because having that constant xp boost makes the xp grind actually tolerable. With the incoming damagepocalypse I am likely going to have to roll an alt just to get the leveling daily done on the reg.
---
Wait, the Meat Bomb, from the Rose quest line can destroy camps?
---
Did I come to the right place for the ‚Äúwasted months of grinding‚Äù club?
---
why the fuck don't they just highlight legendary bodies for fuck sake.
---
Can't guarantee it will work but it sure did work for me. Wish you luck
---
That sucks lol
---
my C.A.M.P. spot is great right by Monogah and ATLAS.
---
My man, use their broken bs game against them
---
U mean it made your quutthole biver
---
I used the brotherhood beret from the atlas stuff and I used this as an outfit once I finally found it at thunder mountain... perfect match. But now... I‚Äôm so pissed
---
Everything worked for me so far as I can tell the one time I have done it.
---
Someone targeted the mine, everyone on the server fast traveled to the train station nearest the mine to wait for it to drop.  After it dropped the event started, everyone that was at the train station fast traveled to it, we were all inside.  We went down and waited for the rubble to clear, it cleared, then we jumped down the shaft.
---
Fought the dude.  I died *a lot*, both to wendigos and I think burning debris? I would just start taking damage over time damage and see fire, so I assume it was the burning stuff falling from the ceiling.  Every time I died and didn't get revived, I just spawned back up at the top of the shaft and had to jump down again.
---
Dude eventually went down, I tried to take out and loot as many wendigos as possible because after he went down literally dozens of them were spawning.  Eventually I died again and it ported me outside, but I don't think that was a bug or anything, I think that's just how it was supposed to be since the objective at that point was to escape the mine before it collapsed.
---
Does it still have the power connector outside and the light inside?
---
I mean I've been grinding daily (literally) so in the long run I'll make up for what I lost but it's frustrating cause I've lost stuff I needed to repair a lot of my weapons. Oh well.
---
Ugh, unacceptable really. But it happens all the time in camp-building. I suggest placing the floor items on rugs and moving the rug w/ item on top...it should then place on the floor. That might work.
---
Does anyone else get the feeling all the pre-fab items for CAMPS are going to turn into entrances for the "Interior" Camps that are suppose to be coming?
---
I guess you buy nothing from China. Capitalism wouldn't have the ability to continue with out the outsource slave labor from China. The computer/phone we are writing this from was more then likely made by communist party in China.
---
Hate commies? Stop consuming.
---
One time i had a fist fight with another player on the helipad of grafton steel workshop HAHA
---
Ahhh okay.   Thanks for that!  For some reason I just couldn't wrap my head around it. Haha.  Also, definitely would love to see more videos from you!
---
Same, I was honestly set to go
---
Probably because if there was a clear and distinct enemy, they wouldn‚Äôt last long at all. 
---
If anything would bring the Raiders, Settlers, BoS, Responders, Free States, Enclave, (hell, even the Blood Eagles and Mothman Cultists) together, it‚Äôs a Communist Threat. 
---
So it would be challenging, I think, to have them as a joinable or even overt faction.  
---
Maybe as targets for quests, rooting out cells of underground operatives. That could work.
---
&gt;What kind of game punishes you for playing it?
---
Mobile games with paywalls around the punishments. Except there is no paywall around these problems. Whether you are a FO1st member or not, you're fucked just the same.
---
Unless they patched it that I‚Äôm not aware of you can blow up camps with it. Haven‚Äôt tried it in a month though.
---
I usually have to die again when that happens at the SBQ fight.
---
Jeeze they can‚Äôt win lol.
---
Just like raids except they just released it anyway
---
As far as I've seen there isn't a limit (Why would Bethesda stop you from buying millions of Atoms anyway?) as there were also people recently with a bug where their Atom balance would keep increasing over and over again into the millions
---
Might want to buy a mirror cupcake
---
It‚Äôs separate.
---
That's weird but I'll have to give it a try. Sounds like another Todd tax for being alive üòÇ
---
Increased, just completed killing Cryptids for atoms challenge today as well, it is not just you.
---
Just remove not from my name and I can hook you up with some stuff if you need it on PS4. I‚Äôd be happy to help a new wastelander
---
No your not. Man up and file a bug report.
---
It collects soup and other things.
---
It used to collect only flyers but that got patched.
---
The higher level the more cards you'll have to scrap, and/or move points etc. The more characters, the better. Maybe I misunderstood your initial point, if so I apologise.
---
Yeah the suppressors in Skyrim were whack.
---
No.  It collects food, weapons and propaganda flyers by default.  You can also set it to other functions (scrap, fadchnact, etc)
---
Ha, yeah, I feel that. But I‚Äôve worked projects with *thousands* of low priority items in the backlog. And at the front end, users asking why nobody had tested &lt;thing&gt;.
---
The answer is almost always, someone did test &lt;thing&gt;, they found the issue you‚Äôre experiencing, and someone in product made the call that fixing something else was more important - maybe solving an issue in the physics engine!
---
You are asking the state of the game 3.5 months after you last played?
---
Its impossible to set the bunker down in a good spot unless it's perfectly flat. I really regret getting it
---
What's with all the communist stuff lately?
---
Definitely a possibility.
---
Break the under-armor, people complain. Fix the under-armor, people complain!
---
Just wait till the Steel Dawn Fatigues from Project ATLAS come out in a couple weeks. Best of both worlds.
---
So you're calling everyone else a liar?
---
Junkies is a *magic* effect also.
---
Is that all ? 18,500 last thing I bought was the seedy shed
---
What does this link have to do with 76?
---
You mean it doesn't just respawn you at the inside entrance like with all other instanced interiors in the game?!
---
I sell plans and recipes for 10 caps. Ultracite plans for 100 caps, PA plans also. Maybe i could get more but I just want everyone to have fun :)
---
The hell I'm not. Uninstall Bethesda launcher and this rancid bug filled shit show. I shouldn't have to file a damn bug report when this shit has been in a public test server for almost 3 months. So done.
---
Do serum mutations stick with starched genes and class freak?
---
There‚Äôs an extremely similar bunker rewarded at like rank 98 of the next season, Armor Ace. At least now we know beforehand the reward will be trash. Unlike the legendary run, where you get to the end and find out the captain cosmos outfit doesn‚Äôt include the helmet
---
I sell a lot honestly, and if I really have too many in my stash, I sometimes help a new player and and just give them a legendary. Who doesn't need a little help starting out?
---
I wish there was some warning about the delay for consoles. Everything I‚Äôve heard made it sound like we‚Äôd be getting it a couple hours ago. If it weren‚Äôt for the community on reddit, I‚Äôd still be confused
---
The converted ammunitions factory ammo generator is an item people glitch and store in their camp to have a free ammo maker, and people have been banned for them. Even if it's out if other players sights.
---
Thanks, I was already considering it because I love those fences.
---
had to click 3 times on map, but yes it worked.  The instant disconnect only happened on the first try today
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info
---
Yup. I can craft it, if you are on PC
---
That's what she said
---
When I make a comment, it's either I want to help the guy or you are an annoying person. Or when I make stupid jokes. So um... yeah. I'm definitely not trying to help you out so...
---
Ahh game crashed so I took a break. I‚Äôll hop back on
---
Thank god! Now how long till you stop posting in a forum for a game you say your not going to play anymore?
---
If you want to do ops, yes, you should switch.
---
Also, it's a key element to curved or round builds
---
I can barely get rid of my legendary weapons at $250/500/750 for 1/2/3 star
---
How do you point/aim a flamethrower turret downwards to the ground?
---
When I find a trap camp I go to the nearest place and make an army of enemies follow me to their camp and let them destroy it. Even if you was higher level they‚Äôre in pacifist so you can‚Äôt do anything to them.
---
Why do it tho? You can‚Äôt sell ammo to merchants, and everyone sells ammo for 1 cap anyways. I never even run out, I just make more if I get low.
---
OP you missed some other issues with the bunker. Anything placed in the interior of the bunker floats off the ground.   
---
The bunker also cannot be placed on foundations itself.
---
I'm not sure but I think that's how it worked on the PTS as well. When you die after Earle you just get ported outside. A shame, really, since you can't get to your lootbox. 
---
But it's good to know that respawning might just work as it should. Thanks! :)
---
Just scrap it and never look back.  Fertilizer is easy enough to get and the damn cow is too much work.
---
It's fuckin' insane they don't have text chat in a mmo
---
When you stop trying to be a troll and doing an absolutely piss poor job of itüëåüòÜ
---
All I see on the subreddit r bug problems and something about the bos so yes
---
I enjoyed the read but I may be confused about a couple of things. My understanding is that the Brotherhood of Steel is not demanding resources...yet. It‚Äôs a BoS fanboy named Russel Dorsey asking for resources. Russ is wanting to build a base the BoS can use when they return. I assume that it is Russ giving us rewards and not the BoS. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, I sped through the dialog üòä
---
They don't have many people working on the game post launch and never have outside of the two content updates (vault raids and wastelanders)
---
They don't even play test the game, because that would result in finding more things to fix, which they don't want to fund.
---
Small credit to Bethesda at least for not abandoning the game entirely, but they definitely supported the game at a lower level than I ever imagined they would, even if the game wasn't a smash hit sales wise.  I just figured anything Elder Scrolls or Fallout related would get satisfactory support, especially an online game where modders can't fix much themselves.  And it's not like Bethsda doesn't have the money.  Properly funding play testing and development for balancing and bug fixing would barely register on their balance sheet.
---
Oh look, another nuke dropped while I was typing this up.
---
It‚Äôs satire. He‚Äôs active on the ‚Äòbartering‚Äô sub and knows the value of a legacy weapon.
---
But he forgets that not everyone knows who *he* is. He should add a ‚Äò/s‚Äô at the end to indicate sarcasm/satire.
---
I just got the cursed harpoon gun, its uh.. Alright I suppose? 
---
[Cursed](https://i.imgur.com/gDepQ51.jpg)
---
It‚Äôs called the communist commander outfit and it was datamined a while back.
---
I think the worst part is they were right by Wixon Homestead so it's not even like the enemies can do a ton of damage.
---
It‚Äôs ok. I would wait a couple of months to dive back in though due to daily ops plus one wasteland. Unless of course you dont want to miss out on some of the legendary run items you could get.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to reddit though you won‚Äôt run into bugs left and right. This is just a place ppl go to rant when it happens to them hence why all the bug reports.
---
Build nuke mines/grenades and set/throw them around the camp (passive mode on) is annoying for them. Also, wait until they leave thier camp and pied-piper some monsters (preferably flying monsters) over to thier camp and let them chew the place up. One more thing, find out if they are on a public team, join thier team, and then you can hit build to see where the edges of thier camp is, staying just outside of the boundary so they cant build/move traps to where you are. If they are going to spend time trying to grief, I always make time to anti-grief. Bad guys are fair game, I'll bring the whole crew and MAKE them hop server, my crew is bored lol
---
You guys had how long to get this right? Give me a fucking break. There is no defending this development team anymore...
---
I might take you up on that, thank you very kind stranger!
---
Also allowed floating doors so you could do double doors and half width hallways, etc.
---
This happened to me a few days ago but I still did them and got the score on all of them apart from one.
---
I‚Äôve always been able to do this since I started playing a week ago D: these bugs are so weird
---
There is a plethora of guides and tutorials on YouTube demonstrating how to perform the exploit.
---
Mine used to frequently walk across my spike strips and die.
---
Haha I still haven‚Äôt been able to get the event to work
---
Use the lamp and pretend it's on rest mode lmao
---
Bummer I‚Äôm on Xbox - I appreciate the offer though thanks
---
Last night on Xbox I fought one then went to drop plastic off just once to atlas and it attacked me.
---
That does make sense. And I know that this game isn‚Äôt exactly extremely realistic with atom shop stuff and direct lore, so I know getting too deep in logistics is a moot point sometimes. I haven‚Äôt found much on the subject (and I know wastelanders goes into it more) so I figure I‚Äôd ask
---
Super laggy for me and I died and respawned outside the event and got nothing.
---
But since wastelanders I have fought about 30 of them two years before not once
---
If you don't get 100 it's not worth doing. Anything sub that is a fail.
---
Request sent. I guess they dont‚Äôt last long, since it didn‚Äôt auto accept yours
---
Really? Every time I've played it the Blood Eagle Captain has been a 3 star legendary.
---
SFE only if you want to save your loadout from in-game as well. Otherwise you can live without it. Would still recommend SFE with PLM though for convenience sake
---
Those cursed weapons are by far the most useless weapons in game. There's no point to them
---
I'm going to have to make some of these. I've been wanting a way to express my disapproval to people that did not involve going through the trouble of doing a nuclear silo.
---
3 lvl 150 character and you a player who not high lvl lol
---
Wait so the communist bunker is a prefab? Almost got it thinking it was an instanced interior.
---
The battle pass is free (Though you can buy ranks for it if you like), We still have a few weeks left and I managed to get to rank 94/100 with clearly time left to spare without having to buy any ranks.
---
Could be a bit tedious at times, but wasn‚Äôt bad if you can adapt your day to the challenges (e.g. need to kill Super Mutants and claim a workshop? Go take Grafton Steel, need to gather plants?  Put on Green thumb and gather materials for Rad Sheild). 
---
Of course I‚Äôll be finishing it and then we‚Äôll have meat week, so I won‚Äôt really be taking much of a break from the game, no time to go back and work on moving forward in my RPGs
---
Damn you're right. But i'll most def get that bunker bundle
---
Well if it's ok I'll reinstall just to check it out and I'ma remember the one wasteland thing
---
Huh WHOS there
---
I think that‚Äôs one of the only appealing qualities of this game, the wide fan base it appeals to lol such diversity you will find nowhere else
---
I'm still waiting for my honey beast pet I'm sick of getting sloths
---
Scorched with guns still do a fair bit of damage if you jump on the roof. As long as the guy wasn‚Äôt there to kill them. But trap camps suck and don‚Äôt get why someone would do that. Especially when it‚Äôs an area full of newbies.
---
That one I typically see a few others on unless it's really late/early morning. I'll always wait out the timer until it hits 10 seconds remaining to start it though, you can kill all the mobs with 2 decent players but you need at least 3 to handle all the ghouls, keep the miners alive and grab enough ore I find. Sucks when no one else bothers with the ore but I can get it to the first level running through all 4 tunnels.
---
Lol. Bless you. Ask mummy to buy u a mirror for your room. Then u can find what u seek. Or. Alternatively. Stop whining like a bitch?
---
the survival tent is worth the price of 1st. i hate long overburdened walks home
---
Ohhh it's free? I kinda thought it was for atoms when I heard they added a bp
---
Add me, same as username.
---
Yeah totally not true for me, dunno when/if this was a thing and/or when/if it got patched. But I‚Äôve got duplicates of a bunch of cards, and I can totally pick lock picking right now even though I have 1 of each card.
---
Just PA glitch through the walls lol. Some of them have some nasty rads inside though. They're all empty right now though. 
---
Itd be cool if they expanded on the alien lore and put an alien outfit inside or soemthing
---
Happy birthday to the GROUND!
---
That's how it should be, yes.
---
People are saying they can't respawn inside at all.
---
Others are saying that's only happening after Earle died.
---
The first one would be problematic but being ported outside when you die after Earle might be intentional due to the escape the mine timer.
---
I never died on the PTS **after** he dropped so I'm not sure if this is normal or not. :)
---
Well that's a bummer, I'd buy them in a second if they had a working gate with them. Thanks for the reply.
---
Hit damn thank you thank you. I think I'm gonna try and grind that season faster.
---
That‚Äôs been around for a while. Happens to me on scorched earth and encryptid if I die at the end. It‚Äôs been worse, but it still happens occasionally
---
My kid is lv30 and I told him to do exactly that; "sit up there and just try and hit everything you see once"
---
üòÇ ‚ÄúOnly a true patriot would be confident enough to wear Commie camo in public! It‚Äôs the dude decked in Stars and Stripes you need to worry about‚Äù.
---
Last pic.... Nukashine, right?  Or maybe Vintage.
---
I just watched a video someone posted here where everything looked fine. Strange how stuff only floats for some people.
---
Yeah like with encryptid, I have to respond at widows peak or farther or its an endless loop of nonrespawns
---
You can buy the ranks if you want too, 150, but you don‚Äôt need to.  You get daily and weekly challenges that give you the SCORE.  Atoms are even part of the rewards from it.  It‚Äôs not like say, Dead By Daylight, where there is a free version but the paid version is better - it‚Äôs just a single battle pass type of Thing.
---
There's only one kind of trap I like and they don't have them in this game.
---
I just very recently started playing and it‚Äôs pretty much what you can expect. A Bethesda Game with Bethesda systems, Bethesda bugs, etc but if you enjoy the type of open ended games Bethesda likes to create I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find some fun here. In my early hours I‚Äôve encountered characters sitting in the air, other players only showing up with their heads floating in the air, hit detection being VERY hit or miss but you know what? I like this sort of game but Bethesda needs to improve on delivering the updates players want especially bug fixing.
---
Love how you bring political bullshit into it. Keep listening to Faux News ü§£
---
Lol. Says the snowflake literally having a tantrum over a video game because he couldnt be the first to brag about killing a digital monster!!
---
Glitchers, dupers, hackers, exploiters are just as bad in this game as they are in GTA online. Wished they'd just get rid of explosive weapons, like no legacy, straight up replace explosive prefix with a random legendary effect. Make all old plans sold in npc vendors for caps, make all outfits sold in the building it can be found in, all holiday event plans can be bought with gold bullion and all hard event reqrds can be bought with gold. Remove all pvp aspects of the game so no one can inflict damage to another in at shape way or form. Not grenade exploits, no pvp in workshops, it's first come first serve now, traps in camps do nothing so now the fast travel rug can be used, bait meat does nothing to peoples camps. Then after all that, all the exploiters will leave an never come back cause there's no advantages at all. No one can make money off this game irl anymore too. Fuck all of them.
---
Thanks for pointing this out.
---
Was doing Radiation Rumble yesterday and was focusing on mining the ore part.  Once we completed the event I was able to loot Legendary items from meat piles from team mate kills I know I didn't tag.
---
The tenderizer plan will drop from Meat Week which should mean being able to get it from the purveyor.
---
Well I'll prob just wait till the next bp if it'll finish soon anyway
---
Ah since your gonna try it. Don‚Äôt be put off by the ammo converter right off when you get it via legendary run.
---
My pro tip for that is making lots of railroad spikes to convert them into ammo since they only take steel to craft which is abundant.
---
You‚Äôll know what I mean once you unlock it soon in the legendary run.
---
It would likely hit hard, but not ‚Äújust as hard‚Äù. Are you saying that a pipe pistol should do the same damage as a 50 caliber rifle? ‚ÄúNot surprised reddit doesn‚Äôt know anything about guns‚Äù. Get the fuck outta here. Based on your post/comment history you don‚Äôt either
---
Thoughts? Stupid.
---
weird, I'll send again
---
Oh gud I remember having ammo problems
---
Ye and after a week nobody will play it because rewards sucks
---
First and foremost, make the game more stable and less bug ridden. There are so many things in this game we all would love to add or change. For me I can deal with the things that I don‚Äôt like but I‚Äôm so so very tired of bugs and server disconnects. Fun story from today get online looked at the dailys. saw i had to collect some junk for springs and eat some food. my camp is right near sunshine meadows industrial farm. ran over there grabbed the workshop. set up defenses, turned on the food processor and placed a junk collector. my thinking is id hold the workshop and passively collect junk to scrap and food to eat.
---
left them unlocked so all could enjoy. without fail as soon as I fast traveled down goes the server. For the love of Todd this happens EVERY TIME.  As a community this needs to be the or biggest and maybe only demand. Bethesda can‚Äôt seem to add content or change game mechanics without creating or reintroducing more bugs and making the game more unstable. We need to be firm in our demand that they make the game work better or no more of our time and money. Then we can get to your very awesome list of improvements. Sorry, for the rant
---
That's weird, I can't do it.
---
Holy shit you were right damn I'm looking good. Thanks for the advice you made my day bro
---
Razor grain flour
---
Well their developers are based in Austin, and everyone there is a communist. At least that's what Alex Jones told me/s
---
mine was alright
---
Nobody will quit after this tbh. If they‚Äôve stayed during the fo1st debacle and the 15 months without any major features, I highly doubt this will be big enough to change their mind
---
Might be worth going on and doing just a couple of ranks to get the ammo converter, but otherwise yeah, i wouldn‚Äôt go crazy.
---
Anther tip is that some of the stuff in the legendary run will be available to purchase with gold bullion when this legendary run ends. The only thing your missing out is atoms and cosmetics.
---
So don‚Äôt push yourself so hard if you want the chicken coop like some people.
---
Found some BOS Officer Uniform plans on my lunch break and am now freshly stocked on those.  Need to go Flux foraging to add protective lining to them.
---
I will accept that reasoning and it makes logical sense overall. I didn't think about the ticking of the ammo.
---
So we‚Äôve got the subjugator and red viper coming with season 2, but communist militant outfit and hat (which I think is the hat that can be seen on the commie leader ghoul in power armor in the deep) and the communist commander outfit and ushanka have yet to drop. Probably next week or soon though with all this other commie stuff coming out!
---
Yeah, but at least it's new so that got me (and I guess everybody) excited
---
It's the vault tech experimental one I guess, I had built 20 of them before, had to remove 4 of mine to build stuff, and pre patch I even had spare budget for quite a few stuff.
---
Curiously, my power is still enough to power all the lights and stuff, despite me having more than 30 lights, 4 missile turrets, and an industrial purifier.
---
Yeah I'll try and get that before it ends
---
Good ol Obsidian is doing their thing with Grounded :)
---
I agree, but will bethesda listen no. They only "fix" things that are beneficial to them not the players and I'm pretty sure they DON'T care. I've said this enough they just don't care or listen to their players who genuinely love the game. I love the fallout series but I just see time and time again just ignoring us. It's like a one way relationship we think we are getting somewhere but in the end we keep getting screwed over, some of us stay because of our undying love, at the end of the day it's just us loving too much and getting nothing in return, or half assed "gifts"
---
I'm pissed on PS4 as no CP and no MW.... BOOOOOOOOO!
---
It‚Äôs not a battle pass. It‚Äôs a season.  There is no reason not to participate  unless you don‚Äôt want any of the rewards. Ammo converter is only at level 5 (it‚Äôs pretty poorly implemented but if they ever improve it, you‚Äôll be glad you have it)
---
Yeah I've tested it on the SBQ and it goes quite well, I just did a Colossal problem again and noticed the damage numbers were much smaller, I was still doing decent health damage when unloading on him, but I've a feeling when I killed him by accident, his damage resist hadn't actually activated yet, similar to what happens when the SBQ first spawns and you can get a few full damage hits in on her.
---
Whats this rule 10 bs
---
Tell us how you managed to scrap a legendary item...
---
\*Patch notes\*
---
Fixed an issue where players complain about not having any penalties for dying.
---
Yeah I'll just try to get the ammo converter
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate you taking time out of your day to assist
---
I almost agree with what your friend said as far as running your test. Did you know that everyone at Bethesda must wear an aluminum foil hat at work?
---
I get you but tbh the fact you accidentally bought them without full knowledge on the game is fair but it doesn‚Äôt back up this dudes point on these cursed weapons and how it‚Äôs a giant ploy to nickel and dime us for useless repair kits.
---
I just don't want the pets to die. I grow way too attached to lose my pet
---
&gt;**If others don‚Äôt agree with what I‚Äôve said.**
---
Damn. I saw so excited about it when i saw it in atom shop. What a disappointment. Again
---
Except the higher level might not have more cards if they spent more time moving specials around then pick cards. That's the problem. If you spent level ups moving specials you just screwed yourself out of legendary perks progression.
---
Sounds like commie workmanship at its best.
---
Well I hope so because those of us who aren‚Äôt too fond of the BOS will get a break..
---
Some ppl sell at those rates just to SEE if someone will buy it. Also, some ppl dont know they going rate or rarity of objects so they go with what they PERSONALLY think it's worth. Example: I have a friend who sells perfectly preserved pies at 1000c a piece because some people dont know where they spawn statically. It's a free economy,  ppl have the right to try whatever price they want, and you have the right to not buy it. I sell 556. @2c a piece and sometimes they sell, that's called price gouging and would be totally lore friendly in an apocalyptic scenario, i.e. toilet paper, ammo, etc.
---
The Matrix?
---
huh?!
---
If I get a new console I will definitely not run fallout 76 or any game for Bethesda on it.
---
Same here, thanks for the heads up, probably would have got it if I didn't see this first.
---
Wow, can't wait to see how bad this is on consoles, if it ever makes it.  Can't really say any of this was unexpected.
---
You actually think it‚Äôs intentional?
---
There is no hidden agenda, they are simply incompetent.
---
I fuckng hate the bullshit things they produce that won't sit flat on the ground without jutting out or having something clip through them or floating. Log cabin is an absolute disgrace. Ugh. Thanks for saving me the atoms!
---
Quantum phasing with cameras. It just works!
---
Looked at legendary perk system on the PTS?  Every iteration players say how bad an idea it is, yet we‚Äôre still on track to launch it.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs hubris at the top somewhere combined with apathy.  The dev stream shows they don‚Äôt play their own game.  It‚Äôs a paycheck.  Likely that they blow through coders (how few they have) and that how the push new code is broken as well.  It‚Äôs a broken mess that I think would need a top to mid level management reshuffle to address, something we‚Äôll likely never see.
---
Rebalance is bugged and unfinished. They admitted that this morning. It likely won't leave the PTS until they finish it, just like Legendary Perks
---
I hope that it's sarcasm.
---
Its Junkies, 40% Bashing damage, 50DR while aiming. Damage is listed as 117 when using my junkies build (only have enough STR for 3 1\* heavy gun perks though) and damage goes up to 217 when I'm using adrenal reaction and nerd rage.  
---
\*EDIT\* Its primed too
---
Any other company and they would be sacked the lot of them. Can you imagine in your job constantly fucking up this badly over and over and still been employed.
---
Hes got some mole in him
---
I know the feeling and any game should not have that kind of problems. Especially when new content was already delayed before.
---
Hence the second paragragh re-defending your point. I was more trying to play Devil's advocate for the other person claiming it was to sell more repair kits by showcasing how one might actually end up making such a needless purchase for repair kits, followed by how it still doesn't actually add up in the end in regards to A Colossal Problem.
---
lmao
---
Colossus Event.
---
You need to escape the mine after it ends...
---
What happens if you don‚Äôt?   As I didn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt lose anything.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It still happens in PTS, on account of they haven't fixed whatever problem is causing it.
---
such prices make me feel like i'm floating in space forever...
---
Black screen has been fixed apparently but if you die inside the mine the respawn bug is lurking to take everyone's souls.
---
Are u stupid or have nothing to say thinking im using food perk for toxic waste only? Im a hoarder and carry shitton of cooked meat and water, bloodied players was using toxic waste since the start and what kind of bloodied player u are not knowing that üôÑ
---
I won before the battle even started.
---
Some dude did the Hunter VS Hunted specifically to destroy my entire camp without becoming wanted.
---
and why not Cranberry Bog? that would be the best location by far.
---
Legendary perks has been in the making for about a year, its unrealistic to expect it would be in the next patch.
---
Nuka shine
---
I'm not going to waste the wheel spot for it... just like I'm not going to switch weapons... I'm going to kill the queen how I intended to originally and if y'all don't like it go do something else.
---
That was for concrete. Allegedly we managed to collect 200 million cork
---
I love the event. I have run it so so many times. The captain can most assuredly be 1-3 star. Usually 3 star for sure. But I‚Äôve had 1 and 2 star captains before.
---
One that doesn‚Äôt use a food buikd and has no need to take over 100 rads off. Ever. So. A successful one I‚Äôd say
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the entire legendary perk system is a disaster waiting to happen. But if you‚Äôre completely changing your build every few weeks, that‚Äôs your fault. Until they make respeccing easier and less costly, I‚Äôd find a build and stick with it
---
Yee
---
Everyone is going to have a different opinion. Mine? The game is awesome right now.
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Compared to other vendors, I'm dirt cheap.  And yet it sits forever.  People who buy stuff from me either seem to do it for cheap Scrip, and buy it all at once, or they buy stuff just to try to resell it for 400% as much, as I'll later find at their own vendors.
---
Oh NVM then
---
More varied terrain in Morgantown is my guess why it‚Äôs always chosen. When it first came it I couldn‚Äôt get enough, but now like them both. I hope they add a new map soon though.
---
I'm at 100% success rate!
---
That's 1 / 1 though ;)
---
Read the other threads about the communist stuff, it isn't all that good, apparently.
---
Low quality from Bethesda? You're crazy.
---
I cant resist 75 weight pepperoni rolla and 5str meat, fuck stash size
---
Unfortunately it didn't help, even on my alt char, that has nothing game still freezes.  
---
This is being an issue just with fo76.
---
It actually get worse...smh.  This was one of the items that caught my eye after the last datamine, now just smfh (again.)
---
As far as I'm aware, there's not much you can do. That's when basic economics kicks in, if your demand doesn't match that price point then you typically need to lower your price even further. Given competition, this makes it even more likely. That's partly why monopolies or agreements between companies for certain prices on certain products can be so bad.
---
Change it back to default skin move it then change it back and move it again. That should possibly do it.
---
Lol. Maybe I‚Äôll need to consider food perks once I‚Äôve finished my melee toon but I doubt I‚Äôll need the food perk. I‚Äôm not even sure which special it‚Äôs under lol.
---
Selling, my bad you can't scrap a legendary.
---
someone has to nuke Monagah Mine
---
The mire!
---
You can only enter when it's up with a ! on the map.
---
Sorry but communism is best so communist stuff is best too
---
They want the xp and legendaries without wasting their bullets. I can understand it on a certain level. After all, if there‚Äôs a ton of people there then what does it matter if you don‚Äôt do anything? The problem is that most of them have this same idea simultaneously
---
Morgantown have more bushes and water zones to afk than Flatwoods.
---
Lol how does this bug make it past them? Even if the QA team doesn't exist, at some point someone working on this event had to fast travel there and would encounter it...
---
"Can you provide a link to the material that said the nukes would have to be cyclical?"
---
It is what he says in the link you provided, in the no-clip documentary. 
---
As for the difference between inoculation and vaccine, they call it an inoculation in game. Technically they go back and forth at points, but it is predominately called an inoculation. Functionally it's the same either way, but I prefer to use the terminology that they use in the game as much as possible to avoid confusion and cut down on speculation. Especially given that so much of what I've run across on the wiki pages is either wrong, misinformed, or typo'd. 
---
A couple of interesting points about the scorched and ultracite. 
---
You only ever see the crystals on human scorched. We have no information that I know of that definitively states how the crystals end up there. We don't know if they grow out of them, or if they get shoved in. 
---
I have a personal hypothesis that the whole thing is somehow also related to human ghoulism because A. We don't see this effect in animals, and B. There are no petrified scorched animals or mutants anywhere in appalachia, and ultracite also puts off insane amounts of radiation.  
---
As far as the scorched being dependent on ultracite goes, I'm not really sure that is the case. So, the ultracite in fissures appears to be molten, but scorchbeasts are not very heat resistant. We see them flying out of it, but we don't know if they are just passing (swimming?) through a tunnel of it or if they actually live within it (I don't think they can personally) 
---
Ultracite itself is a naturally occurring mineral as well, and even it if is tied to the Appalachian mountains, that is one hell of a large chunk of land. 
---
The story folks have a ton of room to move here, and there are a ton of questions and contradictions floating about in 76 surrounding the whole idea of ultracite and the scorched plague.
---

And good luck
---
Morgan town has a river/lake. I can‚Äôt breath on land.
---
Tried it twice now, first time got disconnected from server, supposedly, this got fixed instantly, and second time i got killed, spawned outside and couldn't enter the mine. RIP in pieces
---
oof yeah just read it, tho the main stuff I want is the older stuff and the new power armor skin (red is my fave color so uhhhhh I need it lol). But doesn't surprise me Bethesda would mess it up lol (I was considering getting the new bundle but I might just snag the safe and forgo the rest after reading about it being so broken)
---
It's always been a thing, but I feel like it got worse after the FED76 pricing tool came around.  I don't know how FED76 works these days, but it seemed to be very naive.  Does it have Faster Fire Rate?  Sentinel?  Cavalier?  Explosive?  If so, charge at least 6,000!
---
Worn out for sure, but it was funny the 1st time and you know it.  Admit it. It's cool. Nobody will think you are too low brow.
---
I know, but it's already nuked. Sometimes with two or 3 nuke areas over it.
---
But the players want *everything*. There's no real coherence or consistency to most playerbase demands - trying to incorporate what the players 'really want' would be a mess.
---
Now, 76 has a fuckton of issues and some things are things that, generally, most of the playerbase generally would like to see added, but still, the stuff the players want is too incoherent and diffuse.
---
This is not deliberate, 76 is just being run through a small overworked team in a minor branch of the company.
---
And everyone thought all those new cooking items were being added to meat week!
---
better you then us thank you
---
I have 4 150+ level characters, all Bloodied. Although sometimes my heavy gunner with 9 damage cards feels _too_ powerful, it's a lot of fun just breezing through anywhere like a BOS Sentinel and wrecking the place. I'll wait to see how much of a nerf this is, but it is easily possible to be too powerful in the game and the nerf has been expected for a long time.
---
More dances please!
---
I 100% live for these titles.
---
I‚Äôm running into the same issue
---
Lol well yeah it's my fault who else would have changed my stuff? Magic? No the issue is now I'm out x amount of coins for this dumb update that I would have never done previously
---
Perhaps you killed him while the character was spawning and at that point you may have inadvertently found a super duper weakness.
---
I actually *did* get it to work. Might be private servers. Heard that the data mining group couldn‚Äôt make it work on private.
---
An emote for a glitch.
---
Commie were losing the war.
---
And they were pushed back in Alaska.
---
So the only actually Chinese Communist in the game would be the spies.
---
Now American Communists, that's a possible thing to do, but free-states was the closest we will likely get.
---
You fucking idiots.
---
And, honestly, I'm sorry to yell at you. I've been playing since launch, have FO1st, and really do like 76. I've defended it a lot. But I just nuked the mine, fast traveled to the overlook, and was sitting there, waiting for the nuke to land, going through my inventory, when the game crashed.
---
When I got back into the **same, private server, on the same team,** not only could I not get into the mine, but a friend who fast traveled out to show me the way couldn't get back in either. The quest had completely reset. I wasted a nuke card, the ammo I spent in the silo run, etc., for nothing.
---
I'm 99/100 on the Legendary Run, so maybe hitting 100 is a good place to stop playing for a while. If you can't be bothered to find serious bugs like this in your play testing, I really don't know what to say.
---
I started looking for these and i lasted about 10 minutes. I spent 150 hours looking for a red asylum (ended up buying one) and i decided i really couldn't be bothered to spend another 150 hours
---
They always add the stuff I want when I‚Äôm broke! üò´
---
the ones i know of for sure is one of the 3 mirrors in the bathroom at the asylum (where a dress can spawn)  for the bog , and in camp venture before you go down to turn in tech data there is a bathroom on the left one of the mirrors in there can spawn the mire one ...now im sure there are plenty of others but these were my go to because i was near them often
---
Try getting the quest and then nuking the mine. I play on PS4 so this is just a suggestion.
---
I've got mine all on a mule for the day when I stop playing enough to get a full scrip collection.  Then they added legendary rewards for events.  And I still unload 8-10 items at least to him, every day.
---
Poor guy has to have back problems at this point.
---
I'd be selling some, but I have more problems with excess caps than I do with scrip.
---
The event only spawns for a limited time when the nuke hits, I'm not sure how long at this stage, but I'm guessing 5-10 minutes.
---
I have a similar magic weapon (Instigating FFR Minigun) and I'm sad to say the damage changes don't fix this. I've used my minigun in the PTS, and it's not fixed. Still deals magic damage.
---
Ironically, this is the 2nd time I see this exact comment.
---
This is what I come for
---
Windigo colossus testicles.
---
"I like to sink chairs into various objects... it kind of adds to the immersion."
---
I see what you did there. Take my upvote, dammit.
---
The nuka collectables would be good. Car, truck, cups, bowl.
---
I don't think I'll be giving this a shot at all until it actually works.  This is just pathetic.  It's been broken and delayed for months.  It will end up like vault raids, empty and ignored by the player base, too buggy and not worth it.  Bravo.
---
That's the really sad part. It was on the test server for weeks, then got delayed but we got this buggy mess still.
---
Ward seems to have a mind of his own! We will raise this internally and see what's going on with him.
---
Is it possible to squeeze them really close to wall structures?
---
What helmet are you wearing? It looks very doomguy-esque lmao

 &gt; Ward seems to have a mind of his own! We will raise this internally and see what's going on with him.
---
I‚Äôve found the bog about 4 times but Fort Defiance is my favourite place to go for legendaries and the chance of a rare plan or outfit. The Mire is the only plan I haven‚Äôt got and sort of given up ever getting it.
---
So has their support team!
---
Sounds like everything new in the Atom store this week is broken.
---
Also since wastelanders dropped there's an extra mirror, it's at bloody franks. I'm guessing it has a chance to spawn it, as I've seen orange mentats recipe in there.
---
Seeing as there's no way this game would be allowed in China, there must be some other reason for Bethesda to be slurping on CCP dong...
---
Not appealing to me anyways. May just buy that cow costume.
---
Add it to the pile.
---
 
---
The ever continuing pile.
---
You paid $100 for this game? 
---
Or you paid the normal price plus $40 worth of trinkets? 
---
There is a difference
---
Drills and wrenches should increase the amount of junk that drops from robots.
---
Radioactive pumpkin seeds and coffee tins
---
"Unarmed was god awful" - what do you mean by that? Unarmed is the most powerful, damage-wise in the game. Unyielding armour set &amp; Bloodied Power Fist, few chems and you can 1-shot the imposter sheepsquatch
---
There are raiders in the game, bud
---
Can you think of another industry where the people behind this debacle wouldn't be fired on the spot for the amount of failures they have over and over.
---
Bummer, I had kind of hoped that this was one of the reasons for the implementation, to try to fix broken weapon effects. Ohwell.
---
Their stuff is not going to move.   Eventually, they'll learn that items are only worth what buyers are willing to pay for them.   Either that, or they'll sit on those items forever.   Dead weight in stash.
---
the official slogan of the game is "buy now, fix later. maybe."
---
If the bunker survives, I doubt the player or any of their camp items inside the bunker will!
---
I'm glad to at least be seeing more posts like this again.  After two years it's effing disgraceful this isn't a feature.
---
Looking at new PTS videos, I saw lunchboxes on sell at Foundation.  Haven‚Äôt been on PTS personally
---
Yep, I think thats what happened, the SBQ has a second or so where she has no DR and I can get full damage hits in on her, I'm guessing this was the same. He had no health bar so I could not tell how much health damage I was actually doing either. (Damage numbers seem meaningless with magic weapons)
---
unlucky.
---
does anyone else ever get the feeling that Bethesda devs *want* to be hated?
---
You put it next to it.
---
I hope Bethesda patches bugged weapons.  One wasteland nerfs everything into dirt while not touching legacy weapons or weapons like this.  It‚Äôs like the devs want people to cheat?
---
Nice, I got a bloodied, 33%vats, faster movement while aim Gauss Shotgun in my first three rolls. It definitely unlocked easy mode for me.
---
Now with the scrap box, I sell everything dirt cheap and spend it on lead, steel, plastic and acid. Best I can hope for really.
---
Man good thing without my gear I'm always over encumbered so I fast travel close, put on my stealth suit and slowly walk in. Being a hoarded finally pays off.
---
It's important to remember that there are people who *don't* play on the PC. They are terrible and wrong. But there are quite a few of them still. At least a dozen.
---
You don‚Äôt - they‚Äôre indestructible. As is the fence.
---
Can i have permission to put this in my CAMP?
---
Bethesda's fueled my cynicism enough to believe they purposefully won't implement this so that people continue to buy private servers for transfers (still risky, but less risky).
---
&gt; A shame, really, since you can't get to your lootbox.
---
I still kept my junk because the event was still active with the objective being to escape.  So seemingly as long as you die after Earle, but before the escape timer runs out, you will port outside without dropping anything.
---
It's trying to hide from the explosive shotgun.
---
It's not "cheating" - that's a legit roll.
---
I waited all day at work to come home, go hit up Reg and find the deep pocketed plans only to hear this.... Uggghhhh!
---
So yeah, doesn‚Äôt work. Both the fence and the foundation are indestructible.
---
Nah it would be a waste of time. They might as well just give us raiders free stuff, the settlers are a bunch of chumps
---
Laggy but totally playable, didnt die once and only in solar armour..
---
I know where me n my desthclaw hand be going at 5 pm
---
It works the same as Scorched Earth. The nuke zone stays after the event is completed.
---
i have two 200s, an 85, and a 50, interested to see what i can use on who, i dont rlly pvp so as long as its not like a posh advantage idrc lol legendary perks as a whole to me are meh, boring, kinda dumb tbh
---
You can sort of catch glimpses of those issues even on their promotional images, which are almost always taken at smooth as baby's butt Whitespring golf terrain.
---
When i get high leveled I promise to provide my fellow dwellers with 1 cap prices FOR EVERYTHING
---
Gaussed that bitch to death :-)
---
Typo on purpose or does the game not allow Umlaute in the name?
---
Also, I want one. Vampire is such an underrated prefix. :)
---
What‚Äôs bad about it? The cursed effect is always on the cursed weapons
---
This happens to me on PTS, so it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, yeah. Miss out on his body loot that way though...
---
Are you ashamed of how many atoms you have or why do you hide it?
---
The more the merrier, if they want Appalachia they'll need to *work* for it
---
Melee + food = 100% more melee dmg or more, they all stack
---
Looking into these reports, thank you for the tag!
---
Good news is you will always be ready for Buried with Honor
---
you are not alone, I also got three star shovel as reward
---
I play on ps4 so I cant wait for the day that this comes out on that so my game can blue screen every time I want to play it.
---
Whew.. I was so close to getting it too.. Thanks!
---

---
 &gt; Looking into these reports, thank you for the tag!
---
what a complete joke.
---
No. Only reason it was in NV because it was vegas. It would be a waste of time when they could be developing actual content
---
Chefs kiss to this lol
---
I want a bunker but I saw a leak for a BoS bunker coming soon. If you're a BoS fan maybe you should wait.
---
I need to check (thanks for noting that).
---
And for heavy / high ROF weapons, Vampire is the way to go, that's for sure.
---
Now I can start banking my legendary modules for other stuff down the road.
---
With the reduced weight, that seems like a great shovel to carry around for the "buried with honor" quest that's always missing the fucking shovel. This is brilliant! *it just works*
---
Prices are way too liquid to just have a set number. If you're selling something of no real value other than scrip, most people I see sell for around 10 caps per scrip, so 50/150/400 for 1/2/3 star weapons. Seen some people go as high as 20 caps per scrip, but I doubt that sells well. Meanwhile if a weapon actually has a desirable roll, 750 can be a massive lowball even for a 1*
---
I meant the reward box close to the exit, sorry. :)
---
That is at least two stars better than what some others got most likely
---
what fun is satire if you have to identify it as such. JK I edited.
---
QA went out to buy cigarettes and never came back.
---
Got the "Cursed Pickaxe" :D
---
Yep, once you get up and running, it's easiest to just buy everything.  I even buy all my ammo, I fill up whenever I get past halfway to caps cap.  Except now I'm having weight issues from too much ammo &gt;.&lt;
---
I‚Äôll do it for free!
---
Shopping in 76 can be treacherous. I stash my junk and wear power armor when visiting camps I don't know. 
---
I've been punji boarded, lit on fire, attacked by a trapped Yao Gui, dropped off of Seneca Rocks, and tossed into the Void below the map.
---
I guess this is the best help they could find for the money, and it shows.
---
A tea pot collection.
---
I pick it because I know it best.  I'm not even sure I've played the other one, and I've played dozens of matches.
---
I think he's saying "the cherry on top of this shit cake" as a bad thing, that the hacked weapon guy made it even worse.
---
I have a VE Minigun. It's pretty much god mode. :)
---
On your regular character or a new one?
---
There was a bug awhile back where you got a ton of packs out of the blue, happened on 2 of my characters, zip to the other 3.   Did you get it the first time around?
---
I will admit the game is leaps better then it was at launch but I do get what you are aayong
---
'Dropping a nuke' (this exists already but I haven't seen it in forever), 'hold on a sec,' and 'let's hop servers'
---
*Quest added: [Repeatable] Brotherhood of Squeal*
---
Breadbox , Salt, pepper,  clean coffee tin, toaster, and an untarnished oven mitt those are a few I can name
---
Same here, do they all have the same legendary effects? I don't remember exactly what mine was, but it was a bloodied one.
---
I‚Äôm talking repair kits, not lunch boxes ;)
---
I was tempted to buy that. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I voted for "Flatwoods" pretty much every time because "Morgantown" is 90% of the time the chosen map... What i noticed... I'm so used to Morgantown by now that i'm pretty lost if Flatwood is chosen because i play so rarely on it :D
---
I know the game feels as if the players are sentient npcs
---
what the hell is this? how is blacking out the info supposed to help anyone?
---
I got nothing. I died right at the end after we downed him, after spending 1000 + ammo and 40 - 50 stimpaks, so I got no rewards. What a waste of time and resources.
---
Hi I'm dirt cheap Egg!
---
Here at my lovely vendor you'll never see more than 1 cap for any ammo and 50-75 cap per star! I sell my lego scrip so you can avoid the fight if you so desire! Fully stocked and happy to serve: come say hi!
---
If you're in need of basic supplies you can always raid my water, brahmin, garden and chems for free!
---
Psn: egroegy
---
Ps: for you collectors, ask about my mule 'o' outfitsb might be something you need!
---
Happy hunting all!
---
Man I got the Reclaimed Helmet on my first run. For once, RNGesus was on my side!
---
I don‚Äôt know if you build your house sky high, but my foundations are on the freaking ground, much lower than the trap. 
---
Also, another user just mentioned that both foundations and the fence are indestructible, so...
---
Saving my atoms for something else now, thanks for the link. I hate it when part of a foundation is floating. (Looking at the weird playground spaceship from legendary run.)
---
If you did not know this is a bug that allows you to blueprint the ammo factory at the converted munitions factory workshop letting you place the ammo factory anywhere, in camps or other workshops as many times as you want.
---
Really - I'm pretty sure it says script in the script...check with the script writers, is it script or scrip...script writers say the script is scrip, the script in the script is a typo.
---
To each they're own, it's my favorite of the Cursed series.
---
A great melee weapon for my non-melee build.
---
On that note maybe i just should wait. I was mostly interested in the fence but i read that it's buggy as hell.
---
Some defunct plans that don't work, brown leather, black leather, and black cloth do however.
---
People are probably farming the normal wendys for screws, or just getting their bearings
---
Robots are armored enemies.. Wonder what the difference is on something with less or no armor. 
---
I always figured the damage formula had thresholds, like how people calculated our armor tops off at 250, unless your hit by something badass like a sbq, which then tops out at 450.  Its the same effect here... Your gauss still breaks the threshold but the lever gun doesn't.
---
Hopefully this is just the start on balancing weapons. It sounds awful today, but maybe something like legendary perks help balance it later.
---
Glad my two characters are bloodied or heavy with several magic weapons.  Maybe I'll be okay.
---
On my regular character. What do you mean "the first time around"?
---
Dev room items.
---
Ever see "The Producers"?
---
Exactly I mean it's not like we want them to turn a mound of dirt into a diamond
---
Is it that easy to just get fixer and bear arm plans?
---
As of update 21... I STILL get this bug.
---
Not satisfied with auto-completing my DAILY challenges now the game also auto-complete  
---
my WEEKLY challenges.
---
I prefer Morgantown as I‚Äôve got my perfect bush wookie run to where I know where to go from start, as well as permutations based on the storm, other players placement, etc.
---
Flatwoods?  It‚Äôs picked so rarely that I just don‚Äôt know where to go.
---
So I guess it falls to familiarity.  People pick Morgantown because the last map was Morgantown and the one before that etc etc.
---
That would be nice! Apparently there is a Harpers ferry map in the files. Would love to see that implemented.
---
I don't melee - like, at all. So these weapons will be completely useless for me.
---
I'm more interested in the camp plans.
---
glad that my 250 cork made it? xd
---
That‚Äôs a good shovel though
---
I died too after it was killed and a lot of people if not everyone in the even died and I was super pissed. After I respawned I was looking for a way back in and the event completed notification popped up and got the rewards.
---
I feel like frog legs would be absolutely mandatory
---
I just had MASSIVE lag when i opened the quick wheel...
---
It doesn't "collect" any of your own supplies.
---
It "finds" (generates) supplies randomly and adds them to the bin.
---
Hmmm there are super mutants at the dump site right
---
Yep. Still gonna keep hoarding atoms.
---
This is what I do, this is what I do, this is what I do, I sit on you.
---
Sit, sit sit on you.
---
Other than the power armor there really isn't anything communist about this bundle.
---
I remember watching a guy do it on YouTube, there's a chest or something near the exit.
---
Anybody have numbers yet on how the cursed effect works? Like if it increases the base damage, or is just counted as a separate multiplier like a perk? And how much % it is increasing it by?
---
It‚Äôs all matter if playing enough hours and maybe having friends to do those events. 
---
Something I would expect from someone complaining he has too many legendaries stored up ;)
---
It's all those fasnacht donuts.
---
Was fixed today
---
Fantastic info here, thank you for saving me the atoms. the foundation on the log cabin is also trash, why they don't make them more forgiving is beyond me.
---
Legit would be pretty cool if liberators latched on to other enemy robot types headcrab style, and mind controlled them.
---
I wanted the plushie but I got a cursed shovel 3 times and my legendary scrip cap for the day is already maxed out. Great odds so far.
---
Yehhhh, thank you. All encompassing downgrades are all encompassing. Downgrade to all. I think that other guy feels personally targeted.
---
SFE makes it possible to save your loadouts. Currently it is not updated because of hotfix. You can set up a loadout now but you can't save anything.
---
No essentially
---
Don‚Äôt lie u will play tiger games
---
That‚Äôs a nice weapon! I have the pickaxe skin pack so I am excited about this!
---
Lol it‚Äôs a fuckin shovel!
---
Hell yeah, now I don't have to be scared I'll accidently ruin my camp
---
When it's released for console, I'm curious if it fixed the weapons &amp; poster display bugs.
---
I have my vendors scattered through my camp so I don't have one good location for it, but those wee ones are great. I'll adjust, but...sheesh! Thanks!
---
I went back to the entrance where everyone else was, but nothing popped up. Maybe it was too late? ):
---
Better red then dead
---
Just read about the bundle too. Shame since it looks like a really good bundle
---
It‚Äôs always going to be either a shovel or a pickaxe. It‚Äôs a mine
---
Oh I didn't even think to check that for PC
---
I don‚Äôt know on which discord you trade, but I get my stuff for the prices I linked above from 3 different persons every week and I spend roughly 10K caps. 
---
Maybe consoles is more expensive than pc?
---
This is not a new bug at all.
---
That‚Äôs probably the bests shovel in the game
---
Or a harpoon gun. Don't forget the harpoon gun and it's years of usage in mining.
---
A new game is about $100 in Canada with taxes etc. We arent all Americans
---
Can those really drop too?
---
It's simple. It's currently only planned to release ESO and doom on the new generation of consoles. Other games at some point later. This is what Fallout is all about.
---
I've fallen for hype before so I'm not getting my hopes up
---
My plans are never bought. They‚Äôre all at 1 cap. My weapons are never bought. Most are under 1k.
---
If people don‚Äôt buy these, they won‚Äôt buy your 1 Star suppressor‚Äôs pipe rifle for 5k.
---
Wish they didn‚Äôt award any exp until the end of the event
---
Walk away with a ton of XP, 3 - 7 legendaries, loot and some T-notes.   It's not all about the special plans you get with 100....not for alot of us anyway.  In fact, I couldn't care less about one more cosmetic outfit or decorative camp item.
---
It will be there in a few days. Besides. Rather have it working 50% when we get it then 0% like this morning for pc players
---
That sounds awesome thank you I will take a look!
---
Hard to count how many times I‚Äôve played one of my fav Bethesda games, spend so many hours playing a character, get fed up with the bug, quit. After months or years i go back to play it cuz i only remember the good times. Wash rinse repeat.
---
yeah, a shitload of people
---
I was able to complete with no issues, however after the event, things are....odd. EX: Toxic Goo is no longer imparting Rads, had to swap servers for it to work, Items in the MISC tab of my pip-boy are missing (VISUALLY ONLY) but are there when in a stash, and good lord MAKE THE EXIT easier to see....
---
Found another Bethesda shill.
---
Better dead than red
---
All entertainment and media has psy-op component in them. FO76 obviously has their own corporate agenda, such as keeping players in the game as long as possible. The more you invest your most precious asset, time, in something, the more likely you‚Äôll spend money for it. I highly suspect that certain bugs are indeed manufactured inconveniences to keep player spending more time. Fast travel for instance can have a hidden RNG that gives us 50% chance to instantly travel. If you‚Äôre out of luck, well keep trying. The upcoming damage nerf is another good example. There‚Äôs no need for it unless they want to force players to spend more time in the game.
---
I‚Äôm of the opinion that if you left over the initial bugs, you‚Äôll leave again over the remaining bugs and new bugs since then.
---
Ah, thanks.  I hadn't ever seen them before.
---
I've about had it with these cheating dipsticks! The lag is almost game breaking from all the issues and glitches and these kinds of a-holes
---
I didn‚Äôt know that. But that makes it even worse
---
Ounce of prevention was not actually addressed in the hotfix...
---
Which outfit are you referring to? Or is it all outfits are now underarmor?
---
People still want about 20k for the Backpack Plan.
---
76 was never meant to be more than a money grab. A bandaid so that Bethesda would have something to release before Starfield. Multiplayer was almost complete for Fallout 4, so they took what they had, handed it off to Austin (who had never worked on a Fallout game OR the game engine) and told them to finish it. Bethesda knew this game would never be a big success but they also knew there were enough Fallout fans to keep it afloat long enough to finish Starfield. It‚Äôs not going to be another ESO, and if Bethesda doesn‚Äôt start doing SOMETHING to fix 76, it won‚Äôt last until Starfield releases.
---
Oh, jeez, now I wish I hadn't bought them.
---
Gloriously batshit as your theory is, it's just a shoddy dev cycle combined with management who put profit over functionality
---
I got the Cursed Shovel! Watch out, Buried With Honor!!! I ended up respawning twice and getting downed a couple of times (my stupidity/first time doing it) but lord was it fun! The exit needs to be WAY more visible though. We had 4 seconds left but got the chest!
---
I have now learned my lesson. Wait for someone else to buy it first and see what their verdict is!
---
The bug challenge is also bugged (ironic) I can't complete the "kill cave crickets"
---
You can buy it on ps5 for a free copy at only 79.98$
---
For example the brotherhood of steel jumpsuit before the patch was treated as though it has an outfit now it is being treated as though is under armour. Other than the pattern to it it gives you no bonuses as under armour. It should be treated as an outfit.
---
How do you get the damage up so high? When I roll these, even at lvl 50 ***, the damage is around 58.
---
I sell unyielding armor gor 2999 a piece and every other armor for 1499.
---
Weapons max out at 5999 and thats only one junkies garling laser.
---
So they announced two games, neither of which are 76. And the article said basically, ‚Äúmore to come‚Äù. 
---
This isn‚Äôt an indication it is or is not on next gen. It‚Äôs basically no information yet. 76 isn‚Äôt even mentioned in the article.
---
Ounce of prevention works now because I just completed ounce of prevention when it was locked out for the last week and a half
---
Are you running the "Grounded" mutation?
---
I think the way legendary perks are now is very good. It creates a new sense of progression that had been missed ever since we got all the wasteland loot. It is an addition to let people at the end game have something to work towards. Being level 320 I think this is great since at my level there seemed to be nothing to work towards. I have all the best gear I could want, all the perk cards I need for my build and stockpiles of junk. There was no reason to play other than to do the daily quests for score. Which could often be done in like 10 minutes (because I don‚Äôt play nuclear winter).
---
This addition is not directed at new players but still lets them benefit from it just to a much smaller degree.
---
Same. Tried it three times - disconnected the first two, got this the third. So incredibly fun.
---
I posted something the other day and it was like I was the lone survivor in World War Z and there were no walls around
---
Truly a shame
---
I've heard there's so much wrong with that thing. 
---
1. Power connector doesn't appear until it's destroyed 
---
2. Objects placed on the floor appear above slightly
---
3. Interior windows are too close to the floor
---
4. Outside turrets are decoration only
---
5. It's tiny
---
6. The foundation isn't deep enough so it always looks like it hasn't been dug deep enough and there's a blank space
---
The whole fucking thing needs taken out and reworked. I was really looking forward to a good bunker.
---
today starts week 8
---
have you seen what even 1 year of rust does to metal, none of these weapons would work, just saying huge missed opportunity on the survival front
---
Thats a wendi-will-not-go lol
---
Enjoy it
---
Yup. Hopefully this event gets bethesda off their asses to fix this bug.
---
It‚Äôs been a glitch for a while there‚Äôs YouTube videos on it but I had it happen without trying once win my furious explosive railway. Had 300 in the clip and it usually only does 10 then I looked up on YouTube and saw it happens. But since then never got it to happen again
---
Here's hoping for more Enclave stuff!
---
Hmm. All I can tell you is the community managers posted here today specifically saying a fix was not included in the patch.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic2o2p/_/g1ztevl/?context=1
---
We will probably get it Thursday or Friday
---
Ooh that‚Äôs the one I want. Can‚Äôt even get the event to work properly though lmao
---
My most powerful bloodied currently is my gauss mini, when using adrenal reaction, bloody mess and nerd rage I do 407 damage per round when below 20% health. Can anyone give me an idea what my damage will be after the patch?
---
Live my dude, lube.
---
I don‚Äôt run any mutations.
---
[Edit] - üòÇ Someone actually downvoted this.
---
Yeah still waiting for the Olive-green commie power armor jet pack and the Commie fusion generator...
---
That was a bug. That outfit is supposed to be under armor. It‚Äôs in the update notes. 
---
Are there any actual outfits that are now showing up as under armor?
---
if you were the first person on a server to do it , it worked fine  , you just got lucky
---
What weapon is he using? Is that unique to him or just a re-skin of another weapon?
---
Someone has to nuke Monongah mine, then you have maybe 5 minutes to enter the mine and join the event. During those 5 minutes you have to wait inside the mine for the enterance to clear out so the proper event can begin. After that it's not possible to join it.
---
Somewhere, there‚Äôs a relevant shot of Randy Marsh.
---
Reported for what?
---
Interesting - I'm running 4 Levels of Heavy Gunner, plus its primed.
---
The pricing by players with their vendors is subjective.  A whole list of scenarios should be considered:
---
1) They're new to the game, don't know what (item) typically goes for...
---
2)  They have their own ideas on what (item) should cost..
---
3)  They don't care what the buyer thinks the value of (item) is, they just want caps..
---
4)  They just don't care.
---
By your post, what do you think a two star Bloodied Explosive Handmade should go for?  Less than 15k?  I once got one for 5k (and to this day it's still the best deal I've ever gotten from someone's vendor - that was awhile ago.)  That two star can easily go for max.  Easy.  My prices vary, if something sits too long, maybe my price was too high - this is where option 4 on my list comes into play.  Lately I just don't care.  After all the various duping that took place (presents, weapons), the market has been a mess, if something sits too long in my vendor, it just becomes scrip.  
---
Lower my price? Never.  I'm j/k... usually if someone asks me to reduce a price on something, I give them a better deal, I just drop it at their feet.
---
This is witch hunting. Don‚Äôt post their names. It‚Äôs one of the rules on the sub. Just report and move on.
---
Yep I know but I have 470 carry weight so I‚Äôm not really in need of food red weight perks
---
Some people want a dog and deathclaw at the same time. I regret taking wasteland whisperer and animal friend. Pure garbage perks
---
Related but unrelated question: when did fasnacht stuff become popular and why? Lmao
---
Teleport away and rejoin the event
---
thanks m8 appreciate itüëç
---
You definitely should sometime!
---
My wife has a little slocum/rr diner in her camp and she loves it lol.
---
Idk why they all look pretty dumb to me.
---
I already told them you fell for it
---
Ngl they should have saved that commy bunker as a free reward next season. It sucks
---
So back when the challenges came out and I found out you could do the ghille suit challenge I got on which I never played it really I was only level 2 I had over 150 packs. I don‚Äôt know why or how then literally after opening all the update came out and you could get Halloween rewards and Christmas rewards. Lol but I still don‚Äôt know why I had all those packs when I don‚Äôt even play
---
I have several of those in my "kitchen" (I can't get pix off my PS4 and onto here for some reason). Anyway, here's what I have:
---
* 1st display - clean salt shaker, clean pepper mill, spices, razorgrain flour, sugar, industrial size shortening.
---
* 2nd display - huffwarbler teapot, house teapot, clean coffee tin, untarnished coffee pot, VTU coffee mug, memor-eaze coffee cup
---
* 3rd display -  cooking oil, food dehydrator, kitchen scale, collander, toaster, bread box,
---
* 4th display - radioactive pumpkin seeds, nukacola vaccine, preserved instamash, blamco mac and cheese, imitation seafood, cajun rice and beans.
---
* 5th display - sugar boms, salisbury steak, fancy lads snack cakes, pork and beans, dandy boy apples, covered saucepan
---
* 6th display - cake pan, cooking pan, frying pan, undamaged abraxo cleaner, unscorched oven mitt, unused enamel bucket
---
I wanted it to be stocked like a "real" kitchen. That being said, I really, really, really miss the OCDecorator mod from Fallout 4
---
I died while he was still alive but respawned far away and couldn't rejoin the event. I think he may have died while I was trying to respawn because when I came back I got the message to escape from the mine on my screen.
---
Pie
---
Using the Punja boards, harassing people.
---
Does it always spawn with the executioner effect or can it be something else?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
They want the Chinese market /s
---
You just need to get to lv 20, quest line unlocks after that
---
Yeah I got fucked by that on the PTS. I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt change that, it‚Äôs bad game design
---
I agree with the bunker except that is not that small... the round shape is weird 
---
The fences for me worked ok, i use a controller so maybe i have more precision dunno, they have snap and you can shift them 45¬∞. If you tried to place regular fences in the game before they work with the same trickery, it's all about the 1st fence that you place that will give you the height of the rest.
---
Here i have some pics.

Cool. I‚Äôll buy the primed mod and look into the Heavy Gunner perk. Thanks for the heads up.
---
It still has the respawn bug :(
---
(echoing voice) COMMUNISM IS A TEMPORARY SETBACK ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM!
---
It's kinda like a James Bond level spy, where he just fucking tells you outright who he is, then has a drink.
---
Pts isn't like live.  Servers under load behave differently than test Servers. 
---
This games problem is and will always be the shakey netcode.
---
I remember back in the old fallout 4 days when explosive pipe weapons could incinerate half the state because of that ridiculous fire rate. When you could get missile launchers, fat mans and double barreled shotguns with infinite ammo. Good times.
---
Yes, and the limb damage effect is bugged. Not your fault, but it is what it is ;)
---
No worries, mate
---
Yeah I know that but I‚Äôm talking about the inoculation part of it surely I can‚Äôt do that without ounce of prevention
---
PTS is the best addition they did to the game.
---
Search the googles for "Clean" food/utensils/kitchen objects. You will find all kinds of things like clean coffee tins, clean Abraxo's...so much. That would look lovely in your awesome kitchen!
---
People don't seem to like that too much - sorry, not sorry. I don't run bloodied or junkies - so I'll take what I can get as a high-health build.
---
This land‚Äôs idea of liberty leads only to imperialism. See through the lies, comrade. Fight for the party.
---
Back to work now, comrade.
---
Speaking as a dev, I kind of understand.   To a point, anyway.   99.9% of people don‚Äôt understand game balance or the parameters of what is possible to do.   Feedback usually ranges from ‚ÄòI want this thing and have absolutely no regard for how that would affect the game or other players‚Äô to ‚Äòeat a dick and die‚Äô to ‚ÄòI love this game so much I‚Äôll have your babies‚Äô
---
That being said, when literally the entire playerbase says something is broken or a bad idea, it‚Äôs generally good business to listen to them.   Or at least look into it and address the playerbase in regards to the issue.    But after a certain period of time, sifting through feedback feels like a bigger chore than making the game was, so I kinda get it.  I feel like we‚Äôve (for the most part) made it pretty goddamn easy for BGS to see at a glance what really matters to the community.
---
I found a camp that glitched into a mountian. It was all space and trippy twilight zone themed. Really fucking cool. Had yo press E on the edge of a cooking stove.
---
Yeah, to bad it didn‚Äôt happen for one of my automatic weapons.
---
bless up, brother
---
award on general principle
---
You fell for it, and it‚Äôs not harassment. YOU were in HIS camp.
---
I'm so happy I can finally put a meat pile on my camp
---
I dont even get why those spawn there
---
They seen to have patched the PC live server into the new console PTS  ;_;
---
How did it fix itself?
---
It was a bug that happened months ago before wastelanders, possibly last year even can't really remember. Nice bug though lol, I had 180 waiting for me to open at level 1 before I ever played a single match
---
Responders had stuff in the shop? Guess I missed that. Damn.
---
Where are all you people hiding?  I have to server hop for about 3 hours to find prices like some that are mentioned here. Been trying to get unyeilding armor for SS and need your low priced weapons for scrip.
---
Chest took 123 modules, Left arm another 67. still got Three to go...on PC, by the way.
---
Agreed. I have a stack of weapons Im sitting on each day I need to break down. I've popped my limit 4 days in a rowm
---
Middle Finger. I would pay an embarrassing number of Atoms for a Middle Finger Emote.
---
‚ÄúStop‚Äù, ‚Äúwait‚Äù, and ‚Äúgo‚Äù would be super useful
---
Just join private server to fix ounce. That's what me and my girlfriend had to do üòä
---
All of this, and the Thorn and Solar armor are still bugged and unable to take most scout mods. When is that gonna get fixed? It's been over 9 months now.
---
I just use rad gun if I‚Äôm in need of some rads.
---
There were a few camp items and a responder power armor skin iirc
---
Try deleting each other then re adding again. It‚Äôs a common bug on the friends list.
---
No. I hid exact amount so Todd couldn't track me down...
---
Ah. I got the power armor skin when it was on sale, but somehow missed the camp stuff then.
---
Cant loot after event ends?  I havent logged in yet today
---
"We're sorry we cannot refund purchases made through the atom store. Our product sales are final, and you agree to all sales when you make the purchase. You have the option of previewing our items before purchase by clicking the item in the sale menu. Have a nice day, and thank you for your purchase!"
---
Upvoted, by the way, the picture of your character without hair is one of the best looking male characters I ever seen. Gz
---
Cant we feed ward to the scorchbeast queen?
---
The nerf across the board is screwing over some already problematic weapons like pipe guns, shotguns, and even rifles/melee. 
---
The real problem is they probably won't make proper adjustments where needed, so the same metas will continue. And that's fine except it's just lame for all the useless weapons out there.
---
I didn‚Äôt think so.  So imo just gonna collet as many Wendigo drops as possible
---
It‚Äôll give you purified water, Chinese swords that are usually broken, frag grenades, and propaganda flyers for the most part.
---
I have one too, but the Goo is fast and on my hot bar. Was just a surprise after respawning and having higher health than Nerd Rage needs and not being able to quickly reset. Thankfully there are LOADS of rads down there :D
---
I can confirm objects that are placed inside floats a virtual 8 inches.  I haven't tested anything else.  I did submit a ticket so hopefully they do a quick fix.
---
Didn‚Äôt see anything on my last run but I‚Äôll look
---
Did you even bother to read the post?
---
Need two emotes.. "thank you", and an "on my way"
---
It still says him along with everyone else is offline
---
Isn‚Äôt Morgantown also the default choice on the selection screen? I expect that‚Äôs also a factor.
---
My inner bush Wookiee also prefers Mtown, but only modestly so. Maybe BGS will randomize the selection screen if they ever add another map.
---
Lmao your knees hurt from sucking Bethesda off yet? 
---
Most of us payed full price for this game. Out of all the games I played and am currently playing. This is the most broken. It need to be fixed but who even knows at this point if they could manage that
---
Eh? I've never had a player kill my Brahmin. They've tried to kill my tamed animal but always fail. 
---
Turn Pacifist mode on in the game options because I'm sure that'll prevent it happening. Either way, this has never happened to me &amp; I have 1158 hours invested in the game. 
---
Maybe take your signs down because they sound like a challenge/dare to me!
---
Brahmin will normally only die if an actual enemy attacks.
---
stack up on ammo that‚Äôs for sure
---
Same. It makes me want to quit the game.
---
Its not a bug, they intentionally changed it in patch 21 but reverted it today...
---
I kinda want an emote that indicates there is a legendary enemy near you so you can let you team know to come tag it and get loot, if they feel like it. I know we have "follow me" and that can work for the same scenario, in theory, but most of the time no one pays attention to it.
---
I always vote flatwoods because it almost always turns up Morgantown.  I'd love to see more area maps happen but I'm afraid it will always end up with everyone voting the 1 map.
---
I did notice that all the shitbuckets just love frog legging around Morgantown explosive spamming (tube/autotube/GS/vatsnade) off the rooftops.
---
There's not one mob here. There's a mob of people who violently hate the game just as loud as the mob of people who violently love it.
---
Search through this sub... they aren‚Äôt censoring anything
---
How long did you guys take for a lame event like this. You postponed it again and again and today I played it for the first time and it wasn't that great. It's just a scorchbeast queen fight with epileptic seizures. The event is not very friendly to who have migraines or epilepsy, which I have both. There are still bugs from 2 years ago that need fixing. The whole game feels like a chore and now we just got another chore
---
I was in westek yesterday and all the super mutants were glowing bright pink.  Idk if this is normal for some reason but figured I'd share
---
They drop bearings now?!?
---
Just don't whiz on it.
---
Thats the meat pile bug, been happening since patch 21.  It gets so bad with radiation rumble and uranium fever I usually get down to about 10 FPS :-(....
---
They must be very powerful to censor the entire Internet. That must be why they are so busy and can't fix year old bugs.
---
You have my vote ...
---
Oh my bloodied I‚Äôm not too worried about I only worry about sneak on daily ops but that‚Äôs why I picked up a junkies double barrel. It‚Äôs my non optimized ones I‚Äôm shitting myself over all of my sneak builds rely on being able use extremely high damage low fire rate guns like hunting rifles.
---
&gt;1. Higher XP and rewards for kills.
---
creature killed per min will get lower so it may not the case(cant do the math so hard to say)
---
&gt;2. No more boring one shotting everything
---
yee because spending 20bullets to kill something is so much fun/s
---
&gt;3. Exploring and fighting will add a little more challenge
---
not realy just more ammo spent 
---
&gt;4. Increased demand for Ammo, meds and chems etc. ( Trading )
---
then you find out that caps are worthless and ammo due to dupes is also worthless on online markets 
---
&gt;5. Teamwork will have more value
---
Ye one of the biggest problems within this comunity is the fact people have no clue how to teamwork and fail even the simpliest cooperative events what can go wrong with this? (xd)
---
all people will cry as this nerfs will hit everything so anything not minimaxed will have potential to go unplayable after the update 
---
This update will most likely kill the game, i dont think making the game like even bigger chore is a good idea
---
Don't leave when it tells you to leave because the mine is collapsing. Apparently theres a chest you have to loot, and I didn't get any rewards because I ran out when the game told me too
---
Edit: don't be stupid like me. Leave be mine through the exit, don't fast travel away
---
Ya'll think its lore, wait and see what happens to the world around you.
---
Side note: Netflix added Space Force, Captain Underpants *In Space*, and The Magic School Bus Rides Again *In Space* around about the same time..
---
Whats with all this talk of communism about? Whats with all this talk about space? Surely has nothing to do with normalization or anything /s
---
Don't die, do not leave for any reason.
---
You will 'Be removed from instance' and will be unable to re-enter event, respawn bug will also lock you out and spawn you into the nuke zone or just lock up your game.
---
If you re-spawn outside the mine entrance there is no way to enter event. You must fast travel into the event from the icon.
---
Harvest wendigo adds as you kill them for screws as there is a 'leave mine' time out, no time to harvest after Earl is killed.
---
A colossal joke.  Earle was clipping through floor and ceiling on my last run.  I got the quest complete and farmed a bunch of screws, but they‚Äôll have to fix this before I waste anymore ammo.
---
only james bond could be that cool to pull that off :)
---
Game is perfectly optimized so its probably that your gpu is dying.
---
Oh wow, I never noticed the visual with radiation rumble. My FPS got *bad* though, like seconds per frame.
---
That's fine. You will be after the annexation.
---
So they are not only NOT fixing VATS they are screwing over Riflemen sounds real smart, almost like they want people to quit playing.
---
I just want more military style buildings and clothes/Skins. Sandbag walls, pillboxes, mounted guns, and ammo cans etc.
---
I got just shy of 200 screws on first run üòé
---
That's the only thing posted on this sub. There's like one "feel good" noob post ("I want to thank the high level player that helped me when I was level 7, I forget your name, but you made my day!!") for every 8374 posts about bugs and glitches.
---
I bought the game when it came out. In no way am I new. There is plenty of things to do beyond what you said. Good luck making a new char. My main point is that it gimps changing classes, the points I already spent, or even loadouts when they happen
---
I think your tin foil hat is slipping. You need to get a chin strap for that thing.
---
Just like the new secret service limb mods, yeah
---
I‚Äôm with you. Personally I just felt the rewards were extremely meh.
---
I was in a group of 7 just now and we were just swarmed by Wendigos. It was crazy. So I thought I had no choice but to kill Wendigos instead of the boss. Is there something I'm missing?
---
Feels more tedious than challenging.  Stagger and fear spam are BS mechanics.  "We have no imagination, so we'll just stagger spam."
---
I think you‚Äôre alone on this one bub
---
That's happened a couple times to me too, I think I've also had it happen in fo4, but with vehicals
---
Let's just hope the Free States will leave some off screen bunkers soon and we can get some new toy.
---
I like the planetarium. It‚Äôs pretty unique.
---
I respectfully disagree. I play a non bloodied pistol build and am looking forward to changes. I have struggled with bosses but I've been able to take on everything else in the game. They aren't so much as making all enemies tougher but scaling them to you. So the question becomes can you take on high level enemies? If you can now you should be able to after the bloodied nerf. You may need to adjust a bit if you are 100% around bloodied but you must realize the current state of the perk is op. It's due for a nerf and I doubt very much it will be so bad to have more challenging gameplay.
---
Once you get to level 20, make a post here asking someone to let you use their private so you can complete the quest. Make sure to include your platform in the request.
---
The 76 community is surprisingly nice and helpful, someone will offer to help
---
I guess when I ran out of ammo because it hasn‚Äôt done it since. And none of my other guns did that either. But that was when I first started using railways being I got the furious explosive to drop and I learned automatic which is the only weapon where the automatic does more damage then the prime. But I was using it and it did it once I ran out of spikes it didn‚Äôt happen again
---
There's no power connector either, although it's advertised as having one in one of the pictures. Also one of the pictures shows the bunker floating.
---
Also, the description says survive a nuclear bomb, but there's literally a giant hole with a broken fan on the roof, you can see sunlight easily through it.
---
Because it's the default option is my guess.
---
Yeah, they tasted great too!
---
If its so broken then stop playing. Easy fix ;)
---
I‚Äôd kill for that shovel. I just love the twang sound.
---
Here I was thinking that scary paint job was doing its job.
---
Always scrap and store your junk before going shopping. (this is a good habit to cultivate in general - use Scrap Kits if you have them while on the go) Look to see if there are stash boxes close by so you can store any junk you do buy. Trap camps are a reality that even my 400+ ass falls victim to!
---
That sounds like a great challenge you can set for yourself. You leave me and my 18 mutations alone.
---
Be on a PC.
---
That surprises me, I live in the area and like to do the event, can't remember him not being a 3\* but I probably just didn't pay enough attention to be honest
---
Yeah I wish I would‚Äôve saved them for the other rewards but oh well. I ended up just grinding the challenges for all the rewards. But I might have to check and see if I have more now. Once I finished the battle pass I don‚Äôt get on nw anymore. I‚Äôm level 30 from just doing battle pass and getting the rewards we should‚Äôve never been able to get lol
---
Let's test your theory...
---
A Colossal Problem has many gli***ERROR - DATA NOT FOUND***
---
Although it might be a little hard to find I've noticed this when the flatwoods monster was inside of West tech and all the mutants were glowing.
---
Pumpkin seeds
---
I think all this is doing is keeping the Bloodied/Junkie's and/or Heavy Guns and Commando metas. It will be more about DPS than single shot damage. It leaves a lot of weapons in the dust which is lame for variety.
---
But as other's have said we are now also having more ways than ever to farm and craft ammo, so I don't think ammo consumption will be all that bad. Maybe we'll have to manage out ammo a little better, but that isn't horrible.
---
However with solid feedback, notes, and voices like yours Bethesda will probably make adjustments to how things are right now, and I have a feeling the nerf won't be quite as extreme if at all.
---
Where is Smiley and what does he sell bullion for? I‚Äôm just getting back to 76.
---
 Gentlemen, which brings me to my next point. Don't smoke crack.
---
Hmm i wouldnt be against it. But the card would have to be in endurance. Luck and agility are kinda cluttered . Endruance makes the most sense.
---
If i could onlt have 3 id pick:
---
Marsupial, eagle eyes and bird bones
---
As was said there is a lack of meaningful ways to dispose of them as just dropping them devalues them and makes legendarys feel much less desirable, they become like "valuable gear without value" which just makes the whole legendary enemy and event reward system feel meaningless which isn't great from a gameplay perspective
---
Ok, I'm done for a while.  I tried to launch a nuke for the second time today and encountered the Terminal access bug.
---
All the legendary weapons I sell, are at the lower end of the prices suggested by [this tool](http://fed76.info/pricing/) and most actually sell fairly quickly. All other legendaries get turned in for scrip. All ammo types are at one cap. The only thing I stopped selling at a cap are aid items, since that always just gets bought out at once by higher level players.
---
RNG. Nothing else to say.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Oh no, not again
---
Right? The community has already been vocal about this but they should really be focusing on bugs and performance first..
---
Season 2 is going to give a lot of communist rewards so I guess their getting us ready
---
How do you even do that? it looks really great \^\^
---
Wait, what? Any idea where this chest is located mate? I was too busy scrambling trying to find a way out to notice anything else really...
---
An Ounce of Prevention quest still doesn't work for me. I thought this was supposed to be fixed this patch? My level 20 Sniper still can't progress the Main quest chain. Previously turned in the blood. Placed the fuse, and "Analyze Blood Sample" in the terminal, but still wants the blood. Sigh.
---
üéà Have an upvote
---
Supposedly happen with Cork too, drop down to 160, tho i didn't see it myself so you know gain of  salt and all that.
---
Jeezus Krighst. I reported someone a few days ago for this cheating. Checked their profile daily over the following days &amp; nothing, they're still playing, no ban. What the fk.
---
What do you do for the glitch?
---
For only 16000000 atomic points (Roughly calculating to a shitload of real money), you can have this USELESS paintjob!!
---
The timer going up is to punish players mindlessly charging at their problem without consequence.
---
If your bloody get EP and more max hp. There‚Äôs tons of ways to get around it.
---
Buffs from food and chems help a lot for survival.
---
Well no shit but I got like four stimpaks, two grenades and some ammo. And Like a one star legendary gun.
---
1.  No
---
2. No
---
3. No
---
Yeah most of them are one gun and a bloodied build, lot of pa in there guess they model after angry turtle. I did it first try in solar armor, no deaths on my alt and found my way out of the mine (barely, had a hard time finding his corpse because it exploded). Everyone was bloodied, they kept dying over and over. I think I was key damage dealer in there too, maybe even rez guy. I need to bring liquor in so don't waste a bunch of stims on the "meta".
---
It seemed there were more windego spawns after he mutated and had the harpoon drop.  https://imgur.com/m6Mpeb8 
---
Bloodied good for xp, but if you're trying to die your way to a win..
---
There are a number of glaring issues with Bethesda being an honest company.
---
what happened to stealth that its useless?
---
Fallout 1st subscribers have more camp budget only in the sense that it's easier to free up space for things like displaying magazines and bobbleheads. I don't know whether level still impacts camp budget but it may...
---
Just the park it 76.  You have standing orders with people I don't.  Also if im advising a seller I advise high if im advising a buyer I would advise low.  He should be looking for 20 the other guy should be looking for 10.  Just a difference of position really.
---
SAVE THE POST OFFICE
---
I guess we are in the post Soviet collapse Oligarch era of "communist" history.
---
Even atomic shop items don't even get some sort of care for quality put into them anymore, what a joke
---
Just sit back and watch the rest of us grind...
---
LOL Thanks for the laugh!
---
They are completely unnecessary ... except as a sneak pistol option beyond 10mm and the charge-to-miss gauss.
---
We need just one more real suppressed pistol option. 
---
Mind you, we also need another option for .44 ammo. I wouldn't mind seeing a basic pipe pistol upgradable to .44 (and even auto). So much .44 ... what an unloved ammo type.
---
Cheers! It's from the Legendary Run!
---
No idea. I just fast traveled out and got nothing for my trouble in launching the nuke. 
---
You'd think it'd act like other events with a reward page but apparently not
---
No. Which wallpaper did you lose? I have a theory.
---
Ha ha ha ha ha.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
If you really do think they are somehow censorsing the Internet I suggest you give YouTube a wide berth as I would hate it to break your bubble.
---
I kinda feel like if they used fuel as ammo, it‚Äôd balance out their much needed buffs.
---
I have zero problem with players criticisms about the game my huge issue are the people who proudly claim to have never played it but then completely trash it based on 2 years old information and if I have to hear about that damned canvas bag one more time I think I'll scream.
---
Didn't we just have the Future Tech bundle not long enough ago?
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs called RNG.
---
We need to boycot this garbage. I‚Äôm looking for quality Bethesda... Q u a l i t y.
---
U only are mad because u don‚Äôt want to do the work to get the rewards so u make a shit excuse why u can‚Äôt get it
---
And yes pricing is very differnt from consoles....you know kinda like you have .50 cals with energy damage, flying NW gods, and mini guns with more launcher barrels.
---
The comic book one. You know the one that's too much unless its on a half wall
---
Untill fix, use private server.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Damn, sorry to hear that mate!
---
I got a message today from a lvl 33 asking why my prices are so high...knowing they aren‚Äôt I asked what they thought was priced high. They responded the mini gun and that the game says the value is 500.  Oh, a legit noob. I had to explain its legendary prefixes are sought after, and no one prices legendary stuff off the games suggested value. Lots of new players probably also pricing too low.
---
no it's literally broken. 
---
I placed mine down 5-6 times and each time the furniture I placed inside it was floating. Plus the bunker itself floats. 
---
Also there's literally a hole in the roof.
---
Nope, just the Cursed effect. The 3star is random.
---
I do believe the cursed weapons are ALWYS 3star though, so there‚Äôs that. But they don‚Äôt always drop. 
---
And they‚Äôre tradeable
---
85% of weapons need buffed.
---
Yeah I'll have pretty solid weapons sitting for 200/300/400 and all ammo except shotgun at 1c, shotgun I sell at 2c because I use it myself pretty heavily so I value it more.
---
Recipes/plans I sell for 10% of listed price.
---
At those rates things except the weapons move at a steady rate.
---
I just don't get people selling for substantially higher.  I know if I'm patient or server hop I'll find equivalent items for way less.
---
It's a Minecraft reference :)
---
I made a little higher tier armor plan location map of where I farm for tier 3 armor plans(marine, robot, etc) for when I was working on the Roboticist badge guide [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cwasvy/where_to_get_robot_armor_plansnot_asking_showing/) Harpers Ferry is on there, but I have quite a few other locations that you can try as well. Hope it helps!
---
My guy, they are both echo chambers of the elite. Neither care about us. This is why I play video games: to escape from our dystopia.
---
I just got the plan for it part of the new event.
---
You can be explosive energy gunner _and_ bloodied btw
---
Afaik to not cheese the now-defunct Vault 94 raid, which had a segment of core replacements on its own. When they removed the raid, the plus weight remained.
---
I personally learned all the core spawn locations inside the silo and always drop the damaged ones after replacing them. You'd maybe save a minute with the pre-repaired cores.
---
I did make a post about this a ling time ago, it would be hard to add that sort of feature at this stage. But my idea was to buff the damage but also add either flamer fuel/fusion cells/ mr handy fuel as part of the repair requirements, which would be you sort of 're filling it with ammo.
---
It didn't go down very well with people! But I agree with you.
---
Yeah for PC only though lol
---
The plans like the bear arm have a really low drop rate and I think you need all three animals alive. Most of the time people only protect one animal and the best rewards I‚Äôve got from that formula P recipe and the arktos lab coat, you can solo one animal with the right build and get the lab coat eventually it‚Äôs not super rare.
---
I can't wait for the meat pile. Going to have fun with that given my cannibal character.
---
I sell everything at 10% of the Value or 1 cap and a lot of it just sits until I get that one "let's clean this machine out" reroll. I just wanna move stuff; I make plenty of caps on my own. /shrug
---
Ah I see, never did them cause they were laggy &amp; unrewarding but that makes sense. You can literally jetpack through 95% of the nuke silo‚Äôs so I wasn‚Äôt sure why they cared about the cores so much to make them weigh so much. Thanks for the answerüëçüèΩ
---
No....they don't.  There is a great deal of engineering that goes into higher end weapons....they don't command the price they do because they're pretty.  A Zip gun firing a round is going to be questionable across the spectrum of ballsitics/accuracy/penetration.
---
Under Mama Dolce's
---
the ammo perk, tho
---
If you turn on Subtitles in your game prefs you will be able to see what all the NPCs say....and mobs. Super Mutants say the best things!
---
That‚Äôs funny, because I know anytime Bethesda replies to just about anything.
---
Well we‚Äôre getting some nice melee weapons from the new daily op. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs high on their priority.
---
The handy buzz saw though is still pretty fun to use and is useable.
---
Well there goes my theory. Can't help ya.
---
Nope. Ya missed it.
---
Seasons are self-contained.
---
Because they never intended you to be able to transfer items at all.
---
Modded chainsaw is pretty epic on its own, flame bar and long bar(bleed) combined do some decent damage. Back when you 200% repair upped melee damage, my furious ripper cut through White Springs like a knife through butter.
---
this is how *EVERY* bundle should be.   I actually bought it, but i dont buy the predatory ones out of principle.
---
Ah sucks
---
That's the "Tenderiser". Plans and mods awarded at Meat Week.
---
Maybe I'm just jaded, but with Bethesda's track record how can you buy anything at all and expect it to work?
---
Did you miss the datamine of Colossal Problem rewards?
---
Ha. Yeah but nobody sells duped legacies or hacked weapons for scrip ;)
---
Sadly I dont think it is either. I just want to see people destroying a sheepsquach with a flaming chainsaw or something, but it struggles with simple ghouls the way is is right now.
---
Anyone else notice they changed Grahm's voice actor and redid his old lines? I came across him with my buddy and we noticed his voice was different and not in a good way. Doesn't even sound like other super mutants or his old voice. It is like someone trying to do a super mutant impression with a stuffy nose and underlying accent.
---
That is what I'm looking forward to the most. I don't have too many cool lamps, actually I only have one lamp from the atom shop, so I'm excited to get this in the next week or two üòÑ
---

Line in the sand rad rumble
---
I'm level 160 all my stuff minus stims and guns if I put em out there, are 5. Plans, waters, drugs. Catch me in the open and you're a low level, I drop em.
---
Is it a step in the right direction though? I have thousands of the damn things that I know I will _never_ be able to cash because I make more than I can cash out.
---
Well, a friend of mine has this bundle and has none of the issues you're mentioning and he's on the bridge nearby Watoga
---
You got any photo evidence?
---
they want people to have as few as possible for the end of the legendary run.  so that people are forced to purchase atoms to complete it.
---
Saw a huge group on the Fallout 76 club page on the xbox spending caps on bulk cork and others scrapping pipe weapons. They apparently spent over 240k caps in total across all the players involved to buy bulk cork from the vendors across a lot of servers. Should note there were easily around 30 or so players doing it along with their alt characters chipping in.
---
Arg -\_-
---
Because 'Murica! that's how.
---
Taking a break for another few months.
---
Smiley is upstairs in the wayward. He sells up to 300 bullion for 6k caps once a week, resets on a Monday.
---
I might be and that‚Äôs okay. I just wanted to see how others felt. I guess my real goal is to see a variety of different characters and builds.
---
I was actually screwing around with a Bloodied Mr. Handy Buzz Blade the other day because I found a reduced weight one for cheap.
---
Before, when I used them against the Queen, I had thought they were secretly awesome because of the way the health bars work (the gray part is actually cumulative damage since you started sawing, not your damage).  But, in reality, it was a bunch of worthless single-digits.
---
Now, though, if I can get the Sneak damage going, it is creating a blur of 143s, which... I mean, if we can trust those numbers, it's not awful.  That's what my Plasma Flamer tends to get, except this doesn't need ammo.
---
Suffice it to say, it also instakills pretty much anything that runs up to me.
---
That'll all go away when the PTS values go live, I'd imagine, but for now, it's an interesting thing to play with.
---
Same applies for rad rumble
---
I even wasn't able to join my friends world (where we were in the party), until the event is over. There just wasn't an option to join
---
Ash Heap

I‚Äôd almost pay gold bullion for screws tbh

I tested it in a dark room and the sight is amazing. It‚Äôs def one of the best lamps there is.

There's a "coc qasmoke" joke in here somewhere but I can't find it right now.
---
Giant Mr Handy like that one place in 4

Just saying differnt economies....and poken some fun.

I thi i endurance would be perfect. Takes endurance to handle multiple mutAtions daily without the body just breaking down
---
The game makes you invisible for the first 30 seconds, for starters.
---
Place a poster with clean line of sight to your generator or something else that's already connected to the grid. Place a power connector on the poster and wire it. Move the poster a foot or so and place it again to lock the pieces together.
---
You can now move the poster anywhere you want within wire range and the wire will glitch through anything, including walls and the ground. You can do the same thing with a rug if you want to use a floor connector instead.
---
üòÇ I am ambivalent about NW but thanks for the laugh.
---
It‚Äôs not live yet....
---
Omg. Can't waiiiitttt
---
Had this happen to me twice today, pretty shit what can I say.
---
unfortunately it actually isnt.  you still have to "destroy" them one at a time
---
Only thing worth it this week is the brahmin costume, that things great.
---
I know exactly where to spawn to get weapons, then hide in a bush.
---
Is rad rumble instanced? Here I wasn't able to reenter because the rubble was back in place.
---
Cool, so I got a bloodied pickaxe first and just now an executioners shovel.
---
They don‚Äôt have that level of power, I mean if Barbra Streisand can‚Äôt do it, Zenimax/Bethesda can‚Äôt either. They can delete posts on their own forum, but they don‚Äôt have that kind of power on Reddit, and based on what you see If you do a simple search, they clearly are not doing that. Shoot, you can find TONS of videos of people showing how to do various exploits and glitches on YouTube, no censorship there (with the occasional DMAC because they left music in).
---
More likely, the issue isn‚Äôt found because not enough people are noticing or talking about it. Not saying you haven‚Äôt had the issue, but I‚Äôve never had the issue with grenades, I barely use grenades except on my commando.  People have talked about the VATS issue for a long time, so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about there.  I‚Äôve never had stimpacks kill me.  I‚Äôve never had the time constraint kick that you‚Äôre talking about.  
---
A lot of what you‚Äôre brining up probably isn‚Äôt that noticeable or people just aren‚Äôt complaining about it nearly as much as things like exploits for hacked weapons and ammo factory.  Shoot, after nearly every major patch there‚Äôs been a user whose been posting the collected bugs.
---
Apparently I'm the idiot? Just completed a second run, and got the rug plan. You can't fast travel out of the mine, you have to "run the gauntlet" as it were and escape on foot
---
How.. just one one on a server makes it lag, that has to be a couple hundred.  I guess this is the future as Bethesda wants us to farm more than play.  This looks like the way to farm! üôÇ
---
I would imagine it's because the escape route loops back around up there and they wanted to prevent players with jetpacks from shortcutting back to the start.
---
... but I mean, that should be a totally valid outside-the-box strategy that only benefits a minority of players, as far as I'm concerned.  Certainly a better design than instantly killing anyone who happens to be next to the shaft.
---
Use plasma weapons. You‚Äôll have more nuclear waste than you‚Äôll ever need
---
Yup... I rock 12, don't like the rest... but if you take away my mutey powers, that's like cutting off a leg.  I won't play 1 legged.
---
The exclusive sales/discounts for some reason aren‚Äôt listed under the fallout first tab (which they should be to avoid confusion). They show up on the last tab of the main page of the atom shop. Typically it‚Äôs just recycled items at a discount. Two weeks ago (I think) the tire walls were the discounted item for 100 points instead of 300 or 500 whatever. These items don‚Äôt show up at all for non first members.
---
However I agree with you.
---
So much for that PTS...
---
I hear you. In FO4 I built what I considered flawless settlements, and the level of pride I had in them was ridiculous. The limitations in FO76 are stunningly disappointing, and at times appear arbitrary. That said, the biggest limitation is the camp budget in my opinion, as you're never going to build a massive compound complete with a  penthouse on the top of an overpass which includes a glass elevator down to the  ground. Once I came to terms with that I found I was able to build a camp that was satisfying and that I could be moderately proud of. Getting more plans and wallpaper from the atom shop makes it a bit more worth the effort. I hope that you can one day build something that you're pleased with.
---
I really didn't have any problems with my bloodied build being too squishy now or on the pts. I was going toe to toe with some level 100 scorchbeasts and they were only really doing damage to me with their lunge and swipe melee attacks. Those one hit me, but they were also one hitting the full health guy in power armor who I was with.
---
The only time i had trouble was with the high perception enemies in the daily op, because I couldn't use stealth at all to break contact. Most of the robots were fine but the gutsy and assaultron are a pain when they can detect you instantly from the moment you respawn. Even swapping to full health defense perks and healing up didn't help though. It was still like three hits to death, respawn, they're already on the way and two seconds later they're shooting at me and I'm frozen and I'm dead. It was either run to cover or die. I think for the daily op it's going to end up needing a special build for each special enemy though.
---
It's just really poorly made like most atom shop stuff. Looks cool, but doesn't work.
---
Yeah. I gave up and cancelled 1st üòÇ.
---
If you are on PC there is a mod you can get that tells you what the numbers are for everything you place called (and forgive me for this lol) "ooh baby I like int raw". There is also a post about the cost of each item. We measure in [Flamingo Units!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/)
---
If not on PC then you will have the "exceeds budget" warning, I assume, and not be able to place anything.
---
(eta last bit)
---
Barring hackers, you just avoid the major spawning locations and you can usually do pretty well.  I hide the entire time and frequently come in the top 10
---
"Was a fun session, leaving now, see you soon!"
---
oh, I miss read, I meant I wasn't able to join my friend's world with that event, even though we were in the party in the same world until the disconnect
---
I prefer to think of them as people who can actually play Nuclear Winter without being monstered by hackers
---
I have actually had people yell at me more then a dozen times, because I pretty much put everything up on my shop for 15-25 caps (yes even 3-star legendaries because my cap are always at CAP!) But they don't like that because I am underselling them....
---
LANDMINE
---
Did you make sure to clear out photo gallery at all? On ps4 to say the least, it's limited about 45 photos I believe. So you could possibly try checking that out.
---
I hope it's actually fixed.  Cause I'm tired of only using walls that are meant for doors.  It just looks so weird in my CAMP.
---
It is on pc

super mutants , scorched, and ghouls all look like they'd take good care and oil their weapons.  90% of the guns in america would be unfireable 5 years from now after a nuclear war

And the outfits. Check last week's post to see them.
---
In Morgantown I spawn right next to a cliff and hop down onto a ledge and then move along the ledge to an indentation where I crouch and watch what‚Äôs happening below.  Also I don‚Äôt team fill because it‚Äôs not fair to my teammates that I am chillin on a cliff side doing nothing.
---
I'm not sure about abusing a creature until it lives at my camp out of fear. Can't I just pet a vengeful mothman into submission instead?
---
I end up doing a bit of both.  I can breakeven on circuit usage if I find about 6-7 of the Mainframe Cores while I'm clearing that room, then I just repair the rest.
---
What about you choose which faction your fighting for at the beginning of the event? I'm not suggesting they add much new dynamics because we all know when they add stuff, it's broken.
---
Imagine they tried making fallout 76 factions like fo4. It would probably be so buggy.
---
You are aware that its not nerf to just bloodied but to EVERYTHING? 
---
&gt;I have struggled with bosses but I've been able to take on everything else in the game. 
---
so prepere to strugle with everything as pistols got nerfed and enemies are getting buffed(i saw some people from PTS saying that pistols builds even minimaxed are trash)
---
&gt; If you can now you should be able to after the bloodied nerf. You may need to adjust a bit if you are 100% around bloodied but you must realize the current state of the perk is op.
---
it will still be the best in the game the nerfs are going to be anoying to me as i will have to change from rifles to comando(and i will have to farm ammo from now on) and im not super happy about it 
---
&gt; It's due for a nerf and I doubt very much it will be so bad to have more challenging gameplay.
---
ChAlLEngINg XDDDDDD i will just use more ammo thats it there is no challange just more grind :V
---
Personally at level 433, I can't say that there's any difficulty in the game. I don't want enemies to level up forever, but I think 50-100 is a good maximum to have for non-bosses. Fighting level 25s is boring an unrewarding.
---
And legendary perks aren't terribly powerful, maybe except for the SPECIAL perks that let you equip more standard perk cards.
---
First is good for two things. The tent, and the scrap box. Anything after that is a bonus.

They may not be what you want, awesome enough, etc.  But they have been actually delivering on it.  If you don‚Äôt like the offerings (an obviously valid opinion, you can take action as you please) but we can‚Äôt say they haven‚Äôt been meeting that promise since they actually have.
---
Yep all the same effects, best one is the Pickaxe with Bloodied.
---
Happens now and then. Having a shotgun with 60 shells in the mag was somewhat interesting but sadly it was on a double-barrel haha
---
She was standing directly across from the entrance to Ward's trailer when I spoke to her.

This. NW is about biding your time, collecting enough gear to be competitive, and surviving til the end so you can take your shot at the win.

P what???

Does anyone know if there are different rewards?

Same for me. Now I'm just left wondering why she's the doppelganger of Dutchess. Not that I mind though, Dutchess is cool.
---
and the private server so you can farm workshops
---
Nope. Killed in 5....
---
I pre ordered the tricentennial version that was at 90 or 100 euros here in germany. And like a week or 2 later it was down at 40‚Ç¨ already...
---
The last few weeks we have had exclusive First sales, so maybe they are finally getting on the ball with that. Last weeks was the Slocum Joe Vendor I think.
---
And "monthly" ish new First items with the Bog Wanderer outfit and mask last month. And the creepy porno bed and thatched rug this month.
---
But I'm not too upset about the lack there, I'd much rather they keep plugging away on the main game and fixes that help everyone as compared to just the Firsts.
---
Im curious too why there hasnt been a Twitch bundle in ages? Definetly been longer than since we got a First item.
---
There‚Äôs been exclusive sales for a few months now
---
Totally a Bush wooky. Still insta killed. How is this fun?
---
When was that posted?
---
1 might be extreme but 3, maybe up to 5 for that mutant's legendary effect stacking sound reasonable. You are not alone
---
Yeah, this. If they ever change it to a system where I need to use a card to get more mutations but still be limited I'll immediately uninstall.
---
I watched a guy do this over I think 7 fusion generators he 2 stories to his camp and they were the only things he was making but for some reason he was only crafting .38 ammo
---
Yeah! Us Raiders would win every time!
---
If it‚Äôs so simple why are you here complaining when you could be working there. I wouldn‚Äôt mind having someone whose competent enough to dish out 100% working content.
---
Funny, but totally pathetic. Why is this shit broken?
---
Planned for fall but will likely be released in winter. Enjoy!
---
The man asked you a question. Did you beat all three raids on expert?? I‚Äôd assume you must have.
---
Where is this chest everyone is talking about
---
Obviously the rads made them grow legs, duh.
---
I don't believe you
---
&gt;maybe there can be a website where players can get a code and they can use the code to load any video / audio files on them and air sound from them and every time they want to claim another radio station they can use the same code or claim and you code and maybe we can make players record their own holotape and then load them to the radio station
---
NEVER going to happen.  Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to want to audit every single voice clip that comes in, and there is no way they wouldn‚Äôt check it before letting people start saying ‚ÄúHitler Did Nothing Wrong‚Äù Bullshit on the radio in game.

This isn‚Äôt to knock your idea, to knock bethesda or anything - shitty people ruin things.

They moved meat week so we would have time to do a colossal problem before meat week.Then today we find out PS4 doesn't get a colossal problem till meat week starts. üòî
---
It was well known this wasn't releasing on console
---
People seem to forget you can buy bulk cork lol, same thing with concrete was this whole like conspiracy because how hard it was to get concrete, also reddit seems to forget they aren‚Äôt the majority of the players, people play only thing game and are willing to spend all there time farming caps / junk
---
I screwed myself out of my first reward, but my 2nd run got me the rug!
---
That's a good point, make it temporary and it works pretty well.
---
Yeah, I was trying to not to have to go searching.  I have 1000's of springs.  I was hoping to make some armour or weapons, then break them down.
---
You just missed the news, it was announced that it would be delayed a few days on consoles.
---
Break free from your chains, comrade.
---
every time if i die i do not respawn in the mine and you can¬¥t join the event again. making the event a instace is stupid. you can¬¥t loot what you killed. job well done again Bethesda this is how you treat youre customers
---
*It just works*
---
Fort mclintock has plenty of clipboards, may need to server hop - if you can hit a private server.
---
What exactly is going on here?
---
what would you like us to do
---
Westek grind, also give legendaries
---
If anything they're just making blooded weapons look better. Because anyone with an Instigating weapon will get screwed out of their damage.
---
It‚Äôs called they bought the ranks lol, I bought some mostly because I have a 9 month old and work so I rarely have time on but overall I liked the run.
---
Downvoted for obvious reasons. It‚Äôs true, so deal with it....üòÇ
---
If you‚Äôve already got a load of springs then you can create a bulk springs at the tinkers workbench and scrap that to complete the challenge.
---
What? No way dude! NEVER heard of this problem...
---
Does adrenaline work now?
---
ffs im fed up of using my ps4 now i just wanna use my pc :(
---
WOW.  I wish I had this kind of creative mind.  Looks amazing.  Awesome job!  Dropped a like a sub.
---
I was talking to my friend yesterday afternoon before the announcements that it was delayed for consoles, and I said I‚Äôm not getting excited about it because they‚Äôll probably delay it again and i don‚Äôt want to be disappointed again, look what happened, sad

Thats kind of funny... ( not really) if you die in the SBQ fight and are outside the nuke zone it puts you in the nuke zone .... sooooo get some one to kill you outside the cave it might put you back in...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇü§£

What the fuck do you consider a trinket? I didn‚Äôt know the best armor in game was considered a trinket that‚Äôs seen as useless. Not to mention the 3* box at the end had much better RNG than in the world. Oh, and the box also dropped legacies. If all of these are stupid trinkets that you don‚Äôt want then what are you playing the game for? The building??
---
i dont fucking now just wanted to rant
---
How much time have you got?
---
And yeah I still play it. It is what it is.
---
I like the community though. That's its saving grace imo.
---
Actually, yes it does. When you're grinding it doesn't reflect the amount of legendaries. If you're playing casual, it reflects the amount you get quite evenly
---
Not surprised someone on Reddit thinks they know more than they do.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say cute...
---
&gt;what about we limited to specific songs that you can find around the Wasteland that can be better maybe they can have some sort of atomic shop item where you can buy songs Maybe
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs false advetsing. The picture shows the structures flush against the ground, seamless. That is not that case.‚Äù
---
Would be my response.
---
Can you place the bunker on a second story's wooden floor, like you can with the greenhouse?
---
How the HELL do you buy the ranks? I miss so damn much info....
---
The part where if you respawn you need to respawn a second time? Or the part where if you leave the Colossal Problem event you can't rejoin it?
---
Awesome, THAT is what I was looking for. Much Appreciated :)
---
I‚Äôll voice my opinion right now. The nocturnal effect should be removed.
---
I think that will be a much less controversial subject than asking people to be a little more wholesome
---
At least you‚Äôre trying to figure it out. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to be.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs pretty obvious cause I get pissed when he‚Äôs not 3*. Lol.
---
Wow the Xbox community must be alot less jaded than this subreddit lol
---
Is the ammo factory? Is this bannable?
---
I didn't know my dad work at Bethesda
---
What exactly is the wendigo Colossus heads? I got the plan from my first kill and i couldn't find where it was in the camp build menu. It's not a wall mounted head right?
---
Allowing any music to be played would require Bethesda to acquire the rights to it (which of course costs money).  It would be possible if people bought it on the Atom shop, I‚Äôm just not sure how high the cost would have to be to cover the licensing rights.

Like others have said, let us know your system and you'll likely find someone who will offer up their private server so you can complete it, no charge.
---
Im on ps4 if that matches your system.
---
Lol I just really and I mean really hate that effect. Its an abomination!
---
well at least you dont have cheaters in NW :V
---
They have, of course, removed all the bathroom stall doors, by now.
---
I totally agree!   I like the level 3 times for the week. It should definitely not be a daily faily though! :p
---
TYVM!!!
---
Power armor is fucking worthless in that marine our scout
---
A vampires gauss rifle and a cursed bloodied pick axe. No special plans though. :(
---
(I did the event solely for the plushie plans).
---
Communist fence.....gate.... I don‚Äôt think those two go together. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Rest In Pieces in pieces
---
Well, compared to the real thing, I think it might classify as cute :D.
---
I would compare it to the last patch. Get a legendary, find out it‚Äôs nocturnal. Get ss deep pockets, actually, no, ya didn‚Äôt.
---
I mean, I come on this reddit all the time and follow their social media, but I guess I did?
---
I did come across the monster while in there now that you mentioned it.
---
I wish you a lot of luck with the support. I've had no end of problems with them. Trying to get a refund is like pulling teeth. The creation club update killed fallout 4 for me on my old ps4. The game corrupted all saves after a few hours following the update. Before the CC update I played around 300 hours. I was devastated when I lost my saves.
---
I got 100 atoms to spend in the CC store and told they couldn't do anything else.
---
He ascended to Heaven
---
absolutely zero problems for me today, completed event 3 times with one nuke done myself. either it was hot fixed it is not affecting everyone.
---
In my session we had mostly 100+-300+ levels. I was in PA and never died but did get hit by the panic attack a few times (wish there was something equivalent to this in the SBQ fight). We took it down with about the same difficulty as a SBQ fight (no magic weapons thankfully). Did enough damage with my executioners ffr gatling plasma to get loot and didn't use much ammo. Then we proceeded to look like headless chickens trying to find the exit. Otherwise, it was fun. 5/5, will do it again.
---
But no one will buy it at all if it‚Äôs been duped that hard and so easily.
---
Lol, well known? Nah. I follow bethesda and fallout 76 on everything, and I'm on the sub all the time. They def didn't make it clear enough that we were getting the event on a delay.
---
Nice.
---
Why exactly? I kinda debate on going to PC occasionally and have an account with some stuff on it but never pull the trigger for one reason or another.
---
Lol okay dad.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
So many things just like this that annoy me. Why are shelves and tables hard to make?
---
Another one is public teams, the ones we have are so generic.  Why didn't they create a Responder/Raider/Enclave/Etc public teams with different team buffs?  Would have almost been as easy lfg ya know?
---
Upvote for ya Vault Dweller
---
Nah man I‚Äôm on pc, thanks for the offer however!
---
Yeah, it's def BS. Typical at this point for them, sadly.
---
Once I got the Marsupial mutation, I started clearing out Whitespring (so I could get on top of the roofs easier and away from the ghouls). Before then, I pretty much cleared out these areas all the way up to level 50: Welch for the Mole Miners, Grafton for the Super Mutants, Point Pleasant for Scorched (not there anymore though), Beckley for Scorched. I also did events that popped up around the Forest, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley.
---
And his kingdom will have no end.
---
Does the reverse apply, like if the comment happens six times does it suddenly become funny?
---
This will bring a purge of everyone's blueprints. Mark my words.
---
No it‚Äôs a run out of the mine before cave in scenario. You get a couple min.
---
The only buff pipe weapons need is a mag size buff. 18 shots in a drum mag is abysmal. Other than that they're more than fine.
---
Yeah, my friends and I were joking last night about how "I'll believe the event being live when I see it."
---
Yeah maybe pc then, I thought I'd missed something
---
Was there a chest you had to loot?  I keep seeing people talking about looting a chest before running out?
---
I do not think you do.
---
Futurama reference
---
I forgot all about that. I rarely use it. Good poont
---
Tried this and still get the same results.
---
best for who? probably only for youtubers. Its completly waste of time and 60GB of data.
---
Bulk trading or to just sell. Sit on the ammo and add it to the machine when you need caps
---
Store and redeploy it as the skin you want.
---
Headaches
---
Just looking out for you ;)
---
*Nice.*
---
I‚Äôm really liking the Pip-Boy color scheme.
---
The commie stuff is lame.even the american stuff is cheezy.
---
Id rather have stuff from the game like free states,enclave,bos,not responders though thats lame too.
---
Blood eagle stuff is pretty cool.
---
I was able to get in, and I'm doing it a second time right now!
---
Its just more convineint for me to use my pc to play
---
It worked just fine for me earlier. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think they have to accept the quest first from the NPC (not 100%, just guess).
---
You seem upset. From what I've seen it isn't a nerf to everything but multiple legendary perks. 
---
Were they min maxed bloodied builds? Because that's what most people use. 
---
I'm not going to sit here and argue with you. I just believe with the upcoming patches after this one the game will balance out. Also it is still on pts which is subject to change. 
---
I recommend taking sometime away from the game you seem very stressed. No game should stress someone this much.
---
I would just join an event team and do all the events that pop up. Easy xp if you eat some cranberry relish and get some rest buffs.
---
OR this was some secret second phase and I'm just too big noob to access it.
---
That didn‚Äôt even make sense...
---
A work around could be make new skins of current shelves with cluttered items on it?
---
That is 110% my perfect End Game weapon. I buy every shovel with reduced weight I find.
---
Take 30k caps and a J/E/90RW minigun for it...pretty please and dont tell Unky Todd!
---
Hot damn. My toxic valley base will finally look like an enclosed biodome facility.
---
Probably same problem as me the first time I tried it. When you install the fuse then ft away you need to quit to dashboard then come back.
---
Power armor is worthless in that game mode
---
When the devs only play one way in a game, you know its broken.
---
I haven't played in a few months but I'm pretty sure it doesn't reset until 8 PM EST
---
Based on the look of the Armor Ace board and some of the dialogue from the Chinese Stealth Armor quest, I‚Äôm wondering if the brotherhood will be facing off against the invading Chinese forces in the Steel Dawn DLC
---
I hope you're right
---
Serendipity activated
---
I was just thinking mostly this same thing except...
---
They want you to burn your stored atoms because the legendary run season is about to end...
---
Super casuals like me probably have a ton of atoms saved, and very little season progress. I'll have to buy a TON of spaces if I want to complete. 
---
So... entice us into spending all our atoms now, and then end the season and we'll have to buy atoms with money...
---
Imagine stealing someone's elses armor. This damn community is cancer with the vigilantes
---
Probably yeah, but the fact I couldn't get back in with still like 10 mins left on the event is very annoying to me. Makes me think that others can't get in either when it starts?
---
 every time if i die i do not respawn in the mine and you can¬¥t join the event again. making the event a instace is stupid. you can¬¥t loot what you killed. job well done again Bethesda this is how you treat youre customers
---
I need them back again!
---
So your saying let the legendary perks when they were first revealed on pts make its way into the base game? 
---
They were horrible.
---
After the backlash they got changed. Who are you kidding. This game needed pts.
---
I tried storing and redeploying but it came out the same.  I‚Äôll try it again later though
---
Nah, I just joined with no prior engagement with the npc. I didn't die, but one low level died twice but got back in each time. Sorry op, that sucks.
---
Try looking for a world for almost an hour that hasn't yet started the event only to find out that you and someone else (1 other person) is the only one doing the event after you had sunk almost 6k rounds into it. Had a lovely time wasting my ammo. At this point I'd rather donate my ammo to BOS because at least then I would still get something out of it. To the other person who stuck with me to the end of the event with just his melee weapon... Kudos..
---
I think it should be the wendigo rug in floor decorations.
---
And you‚Äôre a PC player?
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to be that either
---
Its were the gorillas are.
---
I've only done it once, but I definitely did not get treasury notes or anything from the "and one of the following" list. Got everything else stated
---
Go to the sitting and standing gorillas and then scroll right
---
Silly ward sleeping 90¬∞ upward through bunk beds was my favorite character in the game. Now hes just sitting on his chair high on xanax all the time
---
Oh ffs, I just bought the damn thing üò≠. I wonder if I‚Äôll manage to get a refund now that I‚Äôm aware of this issue. Thanks for the headsup op
---
No? Don't tell me it's just live on PC...
---
More than that.
---
Pre-repaired cards also means you do not have to exit PA to repair them at the workbench
---
 Same
---
Oh crap. That sucks man. I was reading all these posts and thinking that most should really have been watching the plentiful YouTube plays of the event for tips on where to stand etc. but having the game itself run you into a drill? That must be soul destroying.
---
What you mean?
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, I started working on my bloodied unarmed build since last February. I didn‚Äôt gather the armor I wanted yet cause of rng. Now my time is gonna be completely wasted
---
don't read the sub much, do you?
---
I'll try it again but I have installed the fuse, fast travel away, quit the game, went back in, installed it again and same result. Even tried installing it, rebooting my Xbox, going back in, installing it again. Still says the sample needs to be inserted.
---
I know exactly what happened, the game checkpoints it after you install the blood but not after the fuse.  And I have another bug going on where I couldn't exit power armor to get into the machine that scans you. Tried fast traveling back and forth and still couldn't so I had to quit the game and restart just so I could exit power armor. And at that point it was broke.  It doesn't think blood is inserted and I have no way of getting it a second time
---
My base is the Dollar Store. I sell everything for 1 cap . Priced to move.
---
did event 3 times today, died probably twice in total. once was able to return to the boss cave and second was teleported outside (it was find exit phase). 
---
either way all 3 attempts were successful (event completed) and in one I was not able to loot boss for additional item (oops). 
---
from what I see it's really important not to die at final phases when boss is nearly dead - the cave is closed and it's not possible to get back. looks like additional difficulty thing so if whole party dies at final - it's a game over.
---
why didn't you buy the game on PC then?
---
Hmm, maybe wendigo mounted heads? Although I haven't heard of it being a reward. Edit: I just now saw you already tried that. Then it has to be the rug, but maybe it's bugged?
---
I have gotten refunds a few times on bugged Atom shop purchases, its a bit of work but haven't been denied yet.
---
So the junk jet or the rock-it launcher
---
... both in previous fallout games..... hmmmm
---
The Soviets and the CCP always tried to made all the money they could in any and every way possible.
---
It‚Äôs why you can mass produce and sell Che T-Shirts so easily.
---
I guess the difference is that the people who buy the ChiCom on the Atom Shop understand the irony and also aren‚Äôt Maoists.
---
(PS4) Saw it for the first time over the weekend, also at UF.
---
if you have trouble with the enemy waves at the end, hide in the area below behind some shelves. I did this after I fought off all the waves of enemies after which it immediately crashed and made me do it again. Not wasting ammo for a second time, oh no I'm not
---
Is there a perma ban in fallout 76? It should be
---
That was probably me, sounds like me :'D level 32?
---
Thanks a bunch.
---
No mate, i am doing....or try.......the new event, anyway i dont speak english very well
---
Just built here. Didn't think of the underground trick to get through the wall. So much props for time and effort. I am baffled how you got a stairs in there. I use the space as my junkie's "opium den".
---
It's 3 heads on a stick. It's under floor decor in the same line as the 2 gorilla taxidermy statues.
---
I do have the lamp lol üòÇ
---
Wastelanders broke the fuck out of critter spawns. In the entire leadup to Faschnacht players were reporting the issue and Bethesda ignored it until the event went live, nobody could do fuckall, and then had to hurriedly patch the game to fix critter spawns.
---
It‚Äôll be in the last Lunchbox reward. Enjoy!
---
Have you completed the Wastelanders story quest and done the vault raid? If not, then you won't get TNs until you do that. I haven't heard of anyone having issues with the rewards so you might double check your inventory for the weapons, the helmet, or the plans.
---
1c ammo, 1c plans, rare booze and chems as long as I can keep them in stock.
---
When I was in the forest, it was pre-war good, bubblegum and cheap booze for dailies, and Brotherhood Recon Rifles for 10c/level.  The level 10 and 20 rifles had .308 and .38 variants.
---
I gave up on that when level 150+ people would come clean me out on rifles all at once.  It wasn't worth me having to farm screws to keep it up when low level people would never get a chance to buy them.
---
I did this with the cheaper fast travel perk card. Thought I didn't have a copy and quickly used a level up on it. Completely forgot I got one in a perk pack but it still let me buy it. Now I have two of them and they don't even combine so it was a wasted level...
---
Good to know, thanks üòÑ
---
So far Fallout 1st has been an absolute joke store-wise but I'll keep paying for the scrap box and private server access lol
---
No bullshit though, it really is disappointing. I was expecting exclusive outfits, armors and CAMP items plus maybe even cosmetics such as unique hairstyles but nope...a rug and a bed so far.
---
Had this respawn bug happen almost lost two legendaries because of it
---
It was a level 88 I think. Thing that was weird was that while I was running out of the mine at the end, I never saw the two players who did the event with me, but there they were at the exit.
---
Practice
---
which is really a shame because they should finish what they start. The whole philosophy of creating a product, giving it a minimal support base, then moving on to the next project is very toxic and wasteful.
---
Teapots and saucers.
---
I am soooo glad I don't play on PC. Sorry PC folks.
---
Which is funny because that‚Äôs originally what they already did for a week but then they just made that permanent. They probably had this planned before they did that
---
Hopefully a happy ending.
---
PC doesn't have the limit and I cleaned that folder up last week so unfortunately no luck there.
---
Jealous. I got no colossus plans.
---
the fix is moving you're entire camp sadly and rebuilding. They addressed this issue in today's update supposedly... but enequip the skin, then replace your camp down
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Russian_innovation#Soviet_Russia_and_Soviet_Union
---
That list isn't even comprehensive. Stop being a chud.
---
It‚Äôs just live on PC
---
Good news is that half the people on PC are having their game destroyed by event bugs so... hooray for delayed content.
---
I believe this is the case. I started Guided Meditation when someone launched a nuke, figuring I‚Äôd have time to join later.
---
Couldn‚Äôt join later. Sad face.
---
üò≥
---
Express your displeasure at price gouging with explosive bait.
---
On a lighter note; I kept running into the drill and killing myself
---
Damnit, thanks man
---
I think I see some gap between floor itself and the things that I put on the floor...
---
The advice about events is spot on.  Even if you're not strong enough to kill creatures, join an events team and play them.  One shot into an enemy is enough to get the XP.   Bullet to XP ratio is by far the highest you can find and it saves you from wandering around.
---
this is exactly what i thought!
---
Well, Bethesda is at least consistent at something.
---
Oh thank God. 
---
I was gonna prep hard as hell today for the event. Now I don't have to.
---
This really depends on the event, though.
---
Uranium Fever, I try to do this every time - bash the legendary, wave people over
---
Radiation Rumble - I don't do this one often, but when I did it last night there were just too many nasty creatures to try and "save" the legendary. I guess I'll get kicked off your team for that one.
---
Path to Enlightenment- I try to save the legendaries on that one, but we're so spread out I never know if the others are going to come over or not.
---
Leader of the Pack - this one I've screwed up before - didn't even realize someone else was doing it with me. Additionally, they are so low level, I think pretty much anyone can one-shot 'em.
---
_Somewhat_ useless is an understatement. Having radiation damage be slowly removed would be utterly crippling and make micromanaging health far too much of a chore to bother with. Cool perk otherwise though, Shame all my guys are Bloodied. I'll be taking that Poison damage perk. Poison is the one enemy of Bloodied Power Armour users. There's no defence, and if you're using a spin-up heavy gun you can heal until you stop firing and the gun stops spinning. A basic stingwing could kill you in seconds if you're not careful
---
Feel free to find me some time and I'll give y'all a hand
---
GT- jss125
---
Yeah...I'll see myself out.
---
Seeds flour clean pre war food nuke cola moonshine bottles etc
---
What platform are you on? I want in on hunting down the people who hunt people that hunt the monsters.!!
---
Very awesome setup that you have there, I definitely approve! Especially the last Harambe picture....
---
I am surprised that there aren't any other comments about it. A little disappointed to be honest...
---
I actually think those should drop at a reasonable rate, hope it drops for you as well very soon :).
---
I just want to do this event so badly. This is the first time I've even seen a Collosus ;-;.. I've played so long. I wanna murder it!!!
---
I‚Äôm not mad, just disappointed
---
But in that one interview at quakecon they said all of Bethesda studios plays once a week...
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha
---
A single bloodied modifier on a weapon should not be worth more than 3 maxed out rifleman perk cards. The perks are a joke. 9 points in rifleman and it's outclassed by a gatling laser with zero relevant perk cards and a debuf from the grounded mutation. WTF?
---
Thanks man well be on here tonight
---
That‚Äôs great news! Luckily I myself are on PC, but we also have a couple of other members who are on other platforms. Maybe you could be the first to start us on a new platform!
---
When you are in build menu press right on the d pad/keyboard
---
Interesting - I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised with their spaghetti code
---
*laughs maniacally in I have over 6k atoms*
---
PM u/Cjsmastersword for the discord, it‚Äôs where the magic happensüòâ
---
Great post and 100% correct.  I'm doing a little project for my self and keeping track of the legendary drops I get.  In 4 hours play last night I managed to get 23 items with a script value of 466.  That's three days of script to turn in and I'm at like 99% weight capacity.  They want you to play every day but it's obvious they only want you there for 45 min to and hour.
---
Yah the fear can do that. Danger of being a bloody build- if you have full health it shouldn‚Äôt kill you before the fear wears off.
---
Nah, there‚Äôs several very real problems with the event though.
---
Can‚Äôt join once it starts (no event on the map, and trying to enter manually, entrance is closed). 
---
At the completion of the event, the shaft you came in through gets filled with rubble. 
---
If you so happen to be standing there when the colossus dies, you just instantly die and are forced to spawn outside with no chance to reenter. 
---
Plus apparently crashes on join.
---
Yeah, that sucks. Also i had hope that event would bring us something new (Even it would be buggy) but nope, nothing new regarding gameplay mechanics. Most likely this is going to be like a SBQ for me, i might take a part in it if the event comes up but i'm not going to launch nuke for that myself.
---
What response are you expecting? Those points are gone forever.
---
Did they fix the nylon bag having a terrible hit box?
---
Is that just a problem losing in the texture for it or it just not working at all?
---
Damn, I just started playing again and this was one of first things I was going to buy, ty for saving my atoms
---
Question, is there any reason to buy a communist collectron if I already have the Raider collectron now apart from looks? Wish I waited a week for a discounted collectron, didn't expect it to show up so soon.
---
The perk system was suppose to make it easy to change your build, instead you need many lvl ups to change your build.
---
Legendary perks were suppose to make your alt characters, as well as main, more powerful, except thats not a thing either.
---
Its almost like they just spew BS and nothing is ever what they say.
---
I gave 250 scrap metal, I am kind of into it!  I got wine! üëç
---
Not going to lie it won't matter if he isn't most of the time, as 3\* almost never actually drop 3\* items anyway but I get what you mean
---
I posted about this exact issue and how it'll break the event for those who have it often (like myself). There's speculation that weight mods on armor and the back pack may be triggering it. I'm running that test now. Haven't died yet luckily but I'll be sure to post what I find.
---
I've found it easier to get better prices from people who are out in the middle of nowhere, they're usually just trying to get rid of stuff
---
I never saw it and didn't see anyone else stop since we were all rushing for the exit. Someone was nice enough to emote when they found the exit. I did get the quest loot and the loot from Earle.
---
This?!? I know you can loot his body, but chest?!
---
Nice, I got the plans but didn't learn it afraid it won't drop anymore.
---
Have done it three times - no problems.  FT to the train station and then hike it down.  Died a few times - respawn at the top of the mine drop each time.
---
Two different groups the first two times - both were awesome.  Third time - got weird.  Mine got nuked again and many of the players got out - and I think joined up others on another instance.  And then I think it happened again and more players jumped to another instance leaving just 2 of us there, which went south pretty quick.  Not sure time/space continuum jumping to a better matchup instance was the intent.
---
I think this is why they delayed it. Tbch I think it‚Äôs just the engine breaking a little, and while thats disappointing fallout 76 just may never be a good bossfight grind game
---
I couldn't agree more, the first time it occurred to me that the only option I had was to drop a "reward" for defeating an enemy was about the most demoralizing moment in my video game history.
---
You clearly don't watch Penn &amp; Teller üòé
---
I literally had to get to level 92 before I can kill a lot of robots.. it was ridiculous how is it that I find it hard to get through the armor of a level 40 robot when I'm level 85??? And then you have to spend perks on weight that's the worst part!! That and having a chest that's always filled.. smfh just makes matters worse
---
Yep. I have it. Cursed Harpoon Gun: 90% weight reduction, executioner, bashing damage.
---
I have it modded to the max and sitting in my box because I'll likely never use it, but it's neat to have, all the same.
---
Might put it on a wall or something.
---
Clipboards
---
Devs said you can plah the game solo.
---
Same here with 1 year old twins. I can play when they nap and somehow have made it almost halfway through the run. Looking forward to the double xp though because I was sick during the last one. What‚Äôs with the line in the sand event?
---
Doesn't matter what you play on and welcome to the glitched club!!! Lmao!
---
It's a fine event, but don't dawdle exiting the mine. I had no issues with it, and if you can get 8 players in there, it should go well. I had two unenthusiastic randoms, who seemed kinda uninterested on firing on Earl. Spongey for sure, but the wendigos were dropping 20-30 rounds a lot of the time. It's a good event, imho.
---
Yah, sadly seeing as they couldn‚Äôt even try to balance melee right before releasing the PTS, I have a feeling changing stats on any specific items is a long way down the road.
---
Pats 7200 atoms
---
Foreverrrrrr!!!
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
I‚Äôve seen a second ‚Äúperfectly preserved pie‚Äù for $30,000.  I don‚Äôt know why that cracks me up versus annoying me.  I want to buy one!
---
Certainly not only applicable to pc. I‚Äôve had it probably a half dozen times on Xbox.
---
Good thing I have a rather large collection of unused bloodied weapons. Guess I'll be getting some caps from discord.
---
Wait one moment, legendary enemy here, be right back etc
---
haha üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Maybe mark spoiler? Us console players don‚Äôt get it yet
---
would mind to give a short guide on how to reach 420 AP? for real i mean =)
---
"Closer to the end of the week" was the timeframe given I believe.
---
Did the same thing with the workshops:)
---
It's amazing how people are still so far behind in learning about this.
---
siding with the raiders questlin
---
Shocker.
---
Huh, I was hoping at least the plushie would be under 5%
---
I would much rather they have a system where you had the ability to purchase whatever item you wanted.  Then when you killed a legendary enemy were given the choice, take the script or roll the dice and see what you get.
---
Had today gone smoothly, I'd say in 2 days. 
---
Today has not gone smoothly.
---
Yay!
---
I spent 10 dollars to get this and its broken. Kinda sick of this shit
---
Yeah they are funny sometimes they attack players I guess because aggro faction, raider themed camp too and the raider collection bot is hilarious
---
I‚Äôm 1H melee, alternate between Heavy metal armor and excavator.
---
 Easily shift between melee, heavies or Semi auto rifles. 
---
 Wendigos easily killed with a vampire switchblade.
---
15 STR - 1 point for the card with the tank on it, 1 point for bear arms, 1 point for bandolier. Martial artist3 and the rest of the usual melee perks.
---
1 piece of weapon WR armor.
---
 13 PER: tank killer (max), 1 each of the auto/semi auto rifle perks, Glowsight3.  The one that lets you target specific body parts in vats.  Don‚Äôt remember the rest.
---
Over in INT, Stabilized3.
---
Lets me kill just about anything with anything I pick up.
---
Damn it haha wish I read this 25 mins ago
---
It looks like OP has it sorted but for anyone else struggling go check out Sugar Grove for springs - there is not only numerous clipboards throughout the building (which scrap for springs) but there is a shelf in the main room with several clipboards on it (next to where the end of dungeon chest is). Plus there is a robot challenge this week so you can get most of that at the same time.
---
Yeah and that is the underlying problem here, either make all legendary effects actually legendary and to some extend useful or enable us to use scrip more freely, so we can "choose" more and at least get some kind of reward for these things
---
Glaring issues? In Fallout 76? Surely not?
---
They really need to start adding all the items individually as well as a bundle because I'd love that fense but I wont pay 10 bucks for it and a bunch of stuff I wont use
---
The jet will make you jittery.
---
What the other guy said. Stop slamming your head into the wall doing the same shit over and over again- adapt and overcome. Rethink your strategy.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a damage cap on pvp?
---
Both times I died pretty early and the entrance was blocked both times. I don't care about the loot I just wanted to finish the event and mostly I'm disappoonted that they couldn't bring this new event in smmothly.
---
It just means it's time to play Doom or No Man's Sky! Woop!
---
What about the fences? No gates? Can you put then circling around a whole CAMP's area?
---
I suspect there isn‚Äôt..
---
 But don‚Äôt forget to loot his body.
---
Steiner
---
Really appreciate the comment, thats awesome.
---
One more issue, the colossus rug floats off the ground when you place it...
---
Edit: it appears to happen when you place it near a utility or floor decoration
---
Can't you just bulk springs then scrap them?
---
Bethesda really are the prime masters of half arsed.
---
Reading through all the laments from our PC brothers and sisters throughout the day, I can wait indefinitely. Seems like the event is still living up to its name. Crashes, respawn bugs ... they said we‚Äôd get it in a couple of days, but I really doubt it.
---
Pvp damage is capped at 110, doesn‚Äôt matter what your build is.
---
&gt;You seem upset. From what I've seen it isn't a nerf to everything but multiple legendary perks. 
---
its nerf to everything perk cards, chems and any other type of dmg buff got nerfed(expect explosive) 
---
&gt; I just believe with the upcoming patches after this one the game will balance out.
---
it will just kill the game(not instantly but there will be no comming back from it)
---
&gt;Also it is still on pts which is subject to change. 
---
thats why we should give feedback that this changes are bad
---
&gt;I recommend taking sometime away from the game you seem very stressed. No game should stress someone this much.
---
im not stressed just iritated by your(and many others) ignorant and uneducated(for lack of better word) points of view and im not playing this game much just doing dailys :V
---
The PTS is good, but it‚Äôs also been an excuse for Bethesda to do the bare minimum before unveiling content or they do way too much and then refuse to make the necessary change ie another system other than perk coins or releasing additive combat mechanics with zero stats changes to balance it. 
---
It‚Äôs a great thing, but rn it‚Äôs often being used as an excuse for issues that should otherwise be solved or extending releases that will be buggy either way
---
It was super laggy in my event we made it just with a spare seconds.
---
Freakin overachiever over here.    How many caps you vend that wine for after!?!
---
Gonna be pnik cows everywhere!
---
Jeez, you would think this would throw up a red flag on their servers.
---
because i didnt have a pc when it came out
---
Had this happen to me yesterday.  Lured me there with a lot of vendor items, two guys waited there after I had died and rifled through my loot (nothing on me). They then tried to initiate pvp at which point I left them an insult card then they left the server..enjoy!
---
In terms of rad resist, PA has numbers as high as the combination of equipment you mentioned, but it also has a "hidden" rad resist that gives a certain *percentage* resistance on top of the given numbers. I've tried this with the RR legendary effect on a full set of Lead Lined Trapper armour as well as Rad Shield, etc, and it just wasn't the same. Rads shot right up, something was definitely missing.
---
Are you sure, because I got the exact same shovel as OP?
---
Wait it's not up?
---
Kill me I've been looking for this dumb broad for a like a half an hour
---
Did anyone get the miner mask yet? Wanting to see it on a player model.
---
There needs to be more time so we can actually loot Earle before it collapses.
---
Did you mean to link a video?
---
Bethesda once more proving they are beyond all shadow of a doubt, the grand masters of half arsed.
---
I‚Äôm just having a giggle, mate
---
I‚Äôm less sure now. I swear I saw SS‚Äôs of other rolls... but maybe I‚Äôm misremembering.
---
That‚Äôs Earl‚Äôs job
---
They will not help,    my ticket from 2 days ago stated so.
---
And the Nuka Cola Secret Door.
---
The bunker looks really cool but is a pain to use indeed. I've found it easier to place it on water than on land. Here it is in the Twin Lakes area :  [https://i.imgur.com/7BKrNMD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7BKrNMD.jpg)
---
Afaik it's larger than the seedy shed as I can fit all 8 workbenches, the communal firepit, decontamination arch, ammo generator, a rad barrel, a music instrument and the personal computer along with a bunch of small vault tec generators (enough to power the arch + large water purifier). 
---
The most annoying thing for me is, as others have mentioned, everything seems to be floating inside the bunker.
---
I usually sell 3* items for around 500 or under. I only price something at 1k when it‚Äôs something really good.
---
I already know about this glitch it is just i didn't realize it has this much of impact into score system
---
I don't think that is the case, at least I hope so :D.
---
I just emptied my inventory, and lugged back a couple hundred dirty water, early in the game. Plus the new rain collector... ahold be able to get ahead and stay ahead and craft soups at will. My purified waters get sold to station vendors...
---
1st members get 24.
---
Give me a bit and I'll try to make a recording.
---
Not crappy at all
---
I have a little over 11k lol. Nothing I want to buy. Also my camp budget is full so can't use it if I do buy it. I don't want to rebuild as its too much on top of all the grinding needed. 
---
All that makes the game a job and I already work 40 hours a week, so I just play and do whatever I want and most times the challenges complete. 
---
I enjoy the game and the community just not all the work we have to do and now come to find out, the damage is getting nerfed!!
---
Bethesda, enough with making the game harder to enjoy. Games are meant to be fun and you are slowly taking that away.
---
Does the rain collector give you dirty which can then be boiled? Also how much and how often? Thnx
---
I think that making other weapon/armor prefixes viable is the answer to this as opposed to limiting mutations
---
The problem is that they‚Äôre not marked as fo1st exclusive deals in the atom store. 
---
A fo1st subscriber will never know the difference of what he sees on screen unless he checks the web you linked. 
---
Which is kinda idiotic. Putting some sort of fo1st symbol on the stuff on the atom store would prevent all the confusion and I would also make it visible (but greyed out) to everyone else, because it could be a selling point for people who don‚Äôt have fo1st yet.
---
Will he shoot me in the face too?
---
As soon as you get a weapon you get taken out of Invulnerability, so it is unlikely but possible
---
Crystallised while pissing. A beautiful death
---
What else are they supposed to do when there are level 300+ players running around that refuse to start a new character, and taking down the SBQ in 10 seconds flat before anyone else can get any damage in. I've seen it happen a bunch.
---
Sounds like there‚Äôs... ‚Äúa colossal problem‚Äù with this event amirite?
---
Ya ya, I know - unoriginal and it‚Äôs probably been said already.
---
Claim workshops in a building team, public events, dailies
---
Was there a spoiler here? If so apologies!
---
Thanks for sharing as usual!
---
Bloodieds are pretty well nerfed in pvp because of dmg cap. Usually takes 3 hits+ depending on your end. I‚Äôm not a pvp‚Äôer either, just fight friends or ppl who punch me to be annoying. I never initiate and I still lose enough times. 
---
I would rather Bethesda just put dmg caps on everything. The issue for us is less about not getting to do 1k+ dmg but that we have to be at such a low hp to get there. If they introduce this combat change we‚Äôll be useless against bosses and there‚Äôs no easy way to change between bloodied and another build.
---
Just take the game offline.  
---
At this rate and point in time 76 has so many long standing issues that seemingly as shown by today's event delaying a release for a period of time is not even close to enough.
---
Take the damn game offline before your reputation hits the floor, fix it up and re-release.
---
Chainsaw already is if you run it right...
---
Yes, the chicken house gives 10 fertilizer, and the cow only gives 5.
---
They should at least aim for 76%
---
Yet another case of "whoops we used old code from before we fixed this on a different PA". Expect this easy fix implemented before next year.
---
Why even bother to do that? I just throw them into othe sky as fast as I get them. Floater fireworks.
---
The nerd rage perk will add quite a bit of damage.
---
Yes it gives 2 dirty water at about the rate of a small water purifier.
---
PS4?
---
That's "Love" and what I usually use, but not specifically "thank you". 
---
Love!
---
It‚Äôs much more rewarding if you complete the whole thing on a brand new character. I did and it makes you go out of your way to do things you wouldn‚Äôt normally do.
---
Yeah these people must be looking at my atom stash as they only drop amazing shit when I'm flat broke.
---
*Edit: Peeps check the posts re the bunker being kinda shit and having the 'flat area' issues of the RR prefab.*
---
Hard pass actually.
---
It's so cute! I can't wait to get that little guy
---
I spent an hour or so building around the bunker, felt proud that I found out the slocum/red rocket bar counters can sink into the side of the bunker... only to find [this](https://i.imgur.com/XuTbqFI.jpg) when I stepped back a little bit to have a look... so yeah, guess I'm moving again, this was the flattest spot I could find lol.
---
Ah so that's where it is. Thanks!
---
Sounds like a pretty big problem.
---
Not everything needs to be squeezed for all the value you feel it has, not everything even has value.  A shit legendary is a shit legendary, just because it may be worth some scrip doesn't make it any more valuable.  Scrip is a small bonus you can earn every day, not an innate value to every single legendary you pick up that MUST be redeemed.
---
It‚Äôs not really a shotgun, mechanically speaking.  Obviously they have it classified as one, but the thing works more like a gauss rifle with a splitter (think laser rifle).  I fully agree that the range is beyond broken *in NW.*
---
How they gonna release stuff for the atomic shop but not ‚ÄúA colossal Problem‚Äù on console?
---
nope. welcome to the club.
---
It's more fun to watch the bugs from a patch then actually playing it lol
---
4√ó base mag size
---
Sounds about right, with the stinging mag i get 85. The real question is why does my DE GP have the exact same mag size as a regular one???
---
Can we get the numa cola rack from FO4 and also some sideways weapon / gun racks too. None of them would be difficult to implement. 
---
Also.... was that a Scott Steiner reference?
---
I hope it doesnt require me to redo my camp I just moved earlier today didn't know about the bug. I dont want to restock all my items and try to get all my shit to fit again
---
Not all of us are guys. But I forgive you ;) I don't assume people one shot things on purpose.
---
Best of luck! I kinda expected it to be a little bigger, but maybe if I feed him enough people it will grow big and strong!
---
Screws... I mean uh people killing legendarys bad.
---
Is this event live on console?
---
Fine for the most part. Sneak it key
---
Thanks so much bro, you're the best. Just copped it
---
And they wonder why duping is out of control in the first place. You're right
---
Remember to stack relish, inspirational, intelligence boosting mutations, strange in numbers, a lunch box, rested. and unyielding/bloodied to max out intelligence and damage to the point where you one shot everything and you can pretty much watch Netflix while you play.
---
(In all seriousness you don‚Äôt need Unyielding armor. But I would recommend using perks/mutations/and relish. I got super mutants over 300 XP a pop)
---
I would because I'm not the one duping. If I go to a C.A.M.P. that's selling thousands of duped 5.56 (for 1 cap each of course) I'd totally pick up a few thousand if I was running low. Same with plasma and .45. If I see some and I need it, I'm buying it for 1 cap each. I'm sure the vast majority of players aren't duping, so no worries there.
---
You actually think this game has QA?
---
I didn't have any trouble with a bloodied commando build the couple times I did it today.
---
I thought it hsd something to do with meat piles and Tesla weapons. Had it happen today with Line in the Sand. Has never been a problem before even with the tent bug,  but as soon as a Tesla rifle starts popping off, everything is screwed.
---
He's going to join the tea party with sheepsquatch and mr. Peebles :)
---
I don't sell weapons but all my plans including hard to get ones 10 caps all my ammo 1 cap recipes 5 caps
---
DE Gp was always bugged - never worked as intended .  It used to be more of a collector item. 
---
Still a  good weapon because all explosive GPs are -but you dont get any use of the double effect
---
what mutations do you use??
---
Hell yeah Comrade!
---
Sounds like a real problem, they gotta fix that somehow especially with the game crashing for some people
---
This was a cyanide and happiness bit
---
Yeah I got the handmade skin yesterday for a good handmade I got... then someone said they'd give me a B2525 fixer for the handmade. Oh well.
---
Adorable!
---
You have plenty of time to do that before the nuka sends you anywhere
---
Ah ok, thanks for the info
---
Whatever it is, push it back a few weeks.
---
How many times we will be able to shoot a TSE Cursed Harpoon? 2 times?
---
Bethesda has proven they 
---
1. Do not give a singular solitary fuck about quality control or version control.
---
2. They have zero pride in their work
---
3. The CM's are powerless to influence changes and are just here to pretend the community has a voice.
---
4. They will run this game into the ground, cut their losses and move on.
---
Continuing to pay into this game is like going over to Anthem and spending your paycheck per month on microtransactions.  
---
This is from a beta player with close to 1,800hours into 76.  They will NOT learn, they cannot adapt, they simply do not care about anything other then monetary goals and stupid deadlines that they do not have the expertise or care to ensure work is completed by, even with delays.
---
&gt; Having bloodied so much stronger than any other builds is just crazy imo.
---
But they're also super squishy, as you mentioned yourself.
---
You played other MMOs? Because in lots of those games, you have the dps class, who output boatloads of damage but are also really squishy themselves (glass cannons). And you have the tank class, who have a ton of health but don't output much damage.
---
If you think of bloodied and full health builds in this way, it actually doesn't seem so badly balanced afterall. But that's just my opinion on it.
---
yeah its pretty predatory
---
I still havent found a server thats doing it
---
I am always surprised when players ignore the waves and try to kill the boss quickly. Almost every event the waves have better rewards, loot, and XP while taking way less ammo.  Think it's incentive now just wait until they nerf damage, on all weapons making bloodied the only option if you don't like farming resources.  Won't be long and they will just change the name to Farming76.
---
This would be top notch, and I feel like it is not that resource-heavy either, they would just need to look out for them to not pick up armor pieces
---
There's a small closed off room to the left as you enter the mine. After Earle goes down the room is all smashed up and you can access it.
---
The subtle ‚Äúhave a great day‚Äù sign is what ties that dick building together.
---
damn this sucks cause i joined this season late and need all the score i can get :/
---
I can say unequivocally that it is that bad with furious.My lever gun is furious, and I've got the right combination of stuff that lets me maintain furious with it, even through reloads.
---
 I think the max it got up to on the deathclaw as I chased it down was around 130 (due to ranged damage drop off). Increasing damage by 50% isn't that great when the base number it is increasing is hella low.
---
A furious fixer in a toe to toe stand off with a level 100 one wasteland deathclaw would be about as useful for me as a bb rifle.
---
On that particular deathclaw instigating is worthless (which is why I never tested my instigating gauss rifle on it) because that DC spwans in a fight with a bunch of critters that damage it's health before you can attack.
---
Yeah those 2 cap ammo sellers ... I noticed with the legendary run allot of people went to 2 or higher... no thank you ill continue to search or jump server just out of principle...
---
That bunker will likely be part of next season‚Äôs SCORE, according to the datamining.
---
As a newer player things can be confusing. Fast travel to Scorchbeast Queen. Watch high level players kill her before I do enough damage to count. Get no loot. Fast travel to encryptid event and get angry emotes when others fail the event while I'm trying to figure out what to do and killing adds. Go to camp fire tales and get angry emotes after whacking the boss with my grognak axe while everything is exploding around me.
---
Now I don't know what to do.. do I engage an enemy, but try not to do too much damage. But, make sure to do enough damage. But also don't 1hko legendaries which is unlikely for me. But, make sure I get hits in before some one else 1hko's it.
---
Do event, but don't do event too well.
---
I did project purity for the 1st time was worried I was attacking the wrong things most of the time till I kinda figured it out.
---
Kinda confusing.
---
Sorry, bit of colloquialism at play here, when I say guys I'm referring to a group of people, not the gender. Sorry again though!
---
I think there should be a limiting factor. 1 or 3 sounds too low.
---
Equal to your endurance. That sounds good.
---
Happy birthday to god Howard. The creator of life and bloodied fixers.
---
Yeah, I have paid between 10-20k for weapons many times on my various characters.  Why make the caps if you can't enjoy spending them?
---
sorry, but LMAO
---
I mean in the PTS yesterday when I tried it
---
Nope, just later this year
---
I was just being snarky. 18 is the max number of mutations you can have. I only actually use 5 of them.
---
Only thing that annoys me in the event is the level 20-40's jumping in and sitting in a corner stealthing and not contributing anything..
---
why even have them in the game then if they're borederline unattainable?
---
You missed the last run ? im selling all the masks in my shop between 100 and 300 caps.
---
Bro it gets worse, I launched the nuke and everything
---
For the most part it‚Äôs pretty easy when the whole server swarms the new boss.
---
On PC I died a few times and respawned inside.
---
I did however crash and rejoined my team but was not able to get into the mine. Not really a bug but a huge oversight.
---
Nothing. As the other guy said it was a "shit cake". I meant it as an extra bad thing on top of the event being completely broken for me.
---
After the junk dupe I traded some weapons for materials that were valuable to me but lost their value as replacement currency. This included 5k screws and honestly it's been the best decision I've made while playing this game
---
You didn't spoil anything, don't worry. All you said was you killed something. Nothing new in this game üòâ
---
Nerd Rage works on low health (below 20%), so other weapons benefit from them as well.
---
Yep. everyday I tense up logging into the game. No one knows exactly what causes it or how to be completely safe from it.
---
I didn‚Äôt...was just confused as to where all the sudden explosion of interest came from. Woke up and ppl were selling things for 1000 caps or more
---
Join building teams
---
Whats a BoS fan? I thought they all died at the start of patch 21.
---
Yeah, I know PA and Hazmat suit has the hidden %, but my hope was with:
---
* +300 from What Rads
---
* +40 from Rad Resist Perk
---
* +297 from full set of Secret Service with Buttressed
---
* +125 from Rad Resist legendary effect
---
* +300 from Rad shield
---
This would get me to 1062 Rad Resist.  Not knowing the exact required RR (tried googling, couldn‚Äôt find it) makes it tough, but I was hoping between the 6 rads healed per second from What Rads, and the Rads cured from the Charisma perk, that it could counter act the missing reduction.
---
Wasn't during the Summer season?
---
I nuked the mine like 3 hours ago but it didn‚Äôt work do you have to put the nuke directly on the mine? I am on Xbox
---
I made it today finally some peace of mind...
---
Im not sure if the next season will intrest me.
---
Who's down voting this and is happy about the decision or is it the typical "downvote everything" people? Maybe it's the "Bethesda does no wrong." brigade from their official forums that claim to avoid Reddit like the plague...
---
Why are you complaining about free stuff?
---
I'm not bloodied, but from what I could tell, environmental hazards and triggered wendigos are the main issues. You can kite Earl. Spongey, but not ridiculously so. Chems and improved repair kits help a lot. It's not ridiculous.
---
Just typed the bunker in to google to see and got no results.
---
Opened reddit figuring ‚Äúif it‚Äôs shit I‚Äôm sure someone will be warning us‚Äù and sure enough the FIRST POST when I opened the app was yours.
---
Thank you kind sir, your sacrifice shall not be forgotten!
---
Or I could buy it and send in a ticket for a refund stating these problems, and get the items for free because odds are they aren‚Äôt fixing those problems
---
I would ask for an image. Maybe its different level?
---
My lvl 45 1 star bloodied handmade does around 330 dmg at 20%.
---
In my experience, Bethesda will refund you atoms for any accidental purchase. But the response email pretty much states it's your only one. And also with anything that is probably false advertisement they tend to refund.
---
accept this internet bro hug, it's yours
---
Most powerful gun in NW. I stink at 1 on 1 fighting but that gun gives me a chance everytime.
---
They have the information on their website
---
sure don't
---
I know. I know. It's just... After investing sooo much time, it gets underwhelming, ya know? I like the icons. Don't get me wrong. But... Idk. I'm just losing faith I suppose. But to an extent, you're right. It IS free. And I shouldn't be too disappointed
---
I never complained. I think people were mad that they wasted material making it shielded and then Bethesda just changed it. I think after the initial material loss was over nobody complained that they wanted it back the way it was.
---
Thanks :'(
---
Free is free.  No complaints from me.
---
Same here, I love it. I haven't tried the fences yet but the bunker is awesome.
---
A lot of people complained and even thought it was an intentional change (despite not being in patch notes). 
---
Now if people don‚Äôt get their mods back, I think that is certainly worth a support ticket.
---
I got on to see the ‚Äúnew‚Äù content saw that it was regurgitated nonsense and haven‚Äôt been back on. I may get back on and play a clausal problem whenever they fix it. But we will see. Then when the Brotherhood of Steel, but I don‚Äôt really have my hopes up. Bethesda won‚Äôt get another dim from me.
---
I do 5 caps per star, i know its dirt cheap but if I'm selling legendaries it means I'm hurting on stash space and need to move product to get it down.
---
refund, item not working as intended
---
I would always run max charisma too! But totally pointless in terms of story since there‚Äôs not a lot of charisma checks, and there‚Äôs usually nothing drastic that changes when you pass them.
---
I can‚Äôt speak on a max charisma build because I‚Äôve never looked into it, but it‚Äôd let you share any perk card you want in team and it would be fun in teams for sure
---
Right on your lap
---
Hopefully Bethesda comments on this that they see it. We need to know they are working on a fix to all these issues
---
Why would anyone want to cosplay as a big pink dildo?
---
What 5 do you use then lol i use chameleon marsupial and speed demon
---
Just didnt want to ruin anything for the feller there... :)
---
Tesla causes this as for as I'm aware. I've done some testing with line in the sand on private and this always happened when I used a tesla.
---
As much as i hate on Bethesda for their shortcomings in this game, its free shit. They don't have to give you anything and could just make you pay for it all.
---
Yeah I gave up trying to sell anything but near Godrolls for peoples alts, which I have between 3k-5k, hence I rarely have more than one or two for sale. I actually only have one vendor machine as true value gear to sell is rarer than the 30 slots I have to use. 
---
The rest is cheap nuke keys (I hate drones of all kinds so *if it flies it dies* philosophy keeps me stocked), ammo at 1 cap (only 45 and 556- happy to stock more but it seems to sit) and the odd Fixer plan or similar. Sometimes flux, but seriously anyone with decent coin has it in spades. 
---
Thanks to SS I don't know why anyone stocks armor other than uny type stuff.
---
God forbid they release some half decent weapon skins, the atoms will surely burn then haha
---
People really complain about silly things. It‚Äôs free. I rather enjoyed the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù emote.
---
Just another case of devs not evem playing their own game.
---
The little picture of them wearing the Steel Dawn fatigues don't look anything like the type they're changing back.  All clothing should just be clothing, but there's far too many in game and Atom shop items that are classified as underarmor for no reason at all.
---
How do you get so many atom points?
---
And if you‚Äôre an unarmed/BE fixer build?üòÖ
---
I have a quad pipe rifle I use as a backup and the Forrest, cheap to repair with plumbing perk
---
This man is in the mental gymnastics Olympics
---
I thought I had 5 but it's actually 4 lol. Can't get my story straight! I use carnivore, electrically charged, healing factor, and marsupial
---
Not to be THAT guy, but just like the base game too.
---
Id be able to play budget Red Dead 2. I approve of this idea
---
You can really feel the care and pride Bethesda put into this delayed release.  How they through time and competence ensured the event worked in their albeit limited internal testing in various scenarios.
---
Is this happening to anyone with public events in general?  I went to FT to the SBQ and was booted.  Then tried for campfire tales, same.  On Xbox.
---
We should have expected this tbh, beth has idiots working on the game.
---
That's also true. From my experience, tho, it doesn't kill you. It just teleports you outside, so you can take your time
---
Did you have to sneak the whole time or were you able to stand your ground out in the open?
---
You can always move to another game. Games aren't meant to be played forever.
---
Isn‚Äôt it funny though that there‚Äôs a slight possibility it could be true?
---
I prefer to pet them with an overpowered legacy weapon
---
Look man, I just want my watch back...
---
I like it..
---
It‚Äôs not an icon though is it? I thought it was an emote?
---
Also did you see they are patching walls switching to/from doorways?
---
You have more chance of Elon Musk etching a dickbutt with Trumps face into the lunar surface facing Earth then patch 22 landing without bringing all new bugs, and some old ones.
---
You don‚Äôt spend them. Has fallout 1st and completed a lot of challenges.
---
Are you saying I cant tell everyone in the coal mines the entire plot of One Piece while you suffer against a 12 foot mutant monster?
---
PTS feedback regarding it is also overwhelmingly negative but its unlikely the system will change in a major way as this is the third build of it.
---
Dude you just paid for the game once and get quite a few hundred hours of enjoyment and then more if you are really into it. Unless you payed for first but even then it‚Äôs much better then most games based on $$ per time spent.
---
If your tired of this game there‚Äôs quite a bit out there like cyber 2077 coming soon.
---
I don't know either but I want another character to have it.
---
Nothing...I am on console
---
&gt;I think people were mad that they wasted material making it shielded and then Bethesda just changed it. I think after the initial material loss was over nobody complained that they wanted it back the way it was. How can anyone complain that a clothing item that should be clothing isn't something you didn't even see when worn. I can wear the other actual BoS underarmor and have the same stats. What military hides their camo under normal clothes? lol
---
Free shooting shotguns has been buggy for a long time.  Vats seems to work like it used to.  There‚Äôs been a lot of health rubber banding with free shooting, and I can confirm that similar things happen to me.
---
I will go drunk Grunt if that remaster turns out to be fan hype.

or you end up hitting max caps and either have to shut down the vendors, go on a shopping spree, or eat the loss.
---
No but comments may, and it‚Äôs harder to mark comments if that makes sense. You didnt, but comments can
---
Awesome, now I maychave to get the bunker
---
I suppose that's fair üòä
---
Their project lead could fuck up an orgy in the PlayBoy Mansion.  Shit bottling water would require sixteen attempts and still leave a leaking bottle, broken tap, and a trip to the hospital with a promise to fix soon.
---
Ya didn‚Äôt, just don‚Äôt know what people may say
---
And then a few more weeks
---
Maybe. But definitely full of assholes.
---
I thought the Blue Ridge Backpack was just cosmetic. Does it offer buffs like the Possum backpacks do? Either way, I just went with the Chemist Backpack from the Raiders. No downside to it like the Possum ones.
---
1 .. and I bought a whisky for 4 so I am a little behind .. I get paid next week so I will be ok then ü•É
---
Yes sir, that would be known as red shift. This bundle is called red scare
---
you saved me bro. was gonna build a military style base with that bundle. thanks for info!
---
First 10 seconds? You're doing something wrong
---
Seriously? Doesn‚Äôt anyone keep themselves informed on this Reddit?
---
I feel your pain I have a whole machine of one star bloody weapons under 800 haven't sold one all month along with junkies
---
Some stuff I bumped up to 2 just because I kept getting wiped out so often. But at 2 it sits for days.
---
Really wish you could bulk pack ammo and sell it per 100/500/1000 packs instead of per shell.
---
My level 200 squishy babe has been overwhelmed by the li'l gits a few times recently.
---
Instead of looking for junk they have decided to take it.
---
I feel they did this only make the grind even longer for people. You need more ammo and other resources. I'm happy I stockpiled ammo for all the ammo I use and I melee to help conserve, but it still sucks. It makes sense with the way they made legendary perk scrap system. Everything is perfectly made to make you have to play a lot and rank up a lot, and this makes it so you spend more time farming for ammo and chems. People say they're idiots but they know what they're doing. You may get a little more xp per kill but a straight damage nerf is incredibly lazy, especially with how hard unarmed got hit.
---
I got the head display twice so you should be safe.
---
I like the cliffs and I‚Äôm more familiar, but flatwoods is fun for sure. I mostly don‚Äôt like how the river gorge area works
---
I have one, but don't wear it much. I see it as something the BoS mechanic wears while fixing power armor.
---
4per is garbage imo I wouldn't take 12 per unless I need the acid bad
---
Yeah I dropped my sub thankfully before money went out just as 21 hit, it was a true cluster fuck.  The event has zero worth to long time players, and now they want to nerf most builds down, release broken events, and ignore long standing bugs but change the games difficulty per region in one of the most ambitious changes to 76 ever?
---
You seriously think I am to take it seriously that if they cannot sort the fast travel bug, or the respawn bug, or the SBQ flying through the ground, or the explosive bait wiping out passive player camps. or... I could go on but I wont.  That if they cannot sort all that patch 22 will nail it? 
---
LOL NO.
---
Ik lol
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy to ask for a refund if a item is completely unusual or unplaceable I had two refunds when I bought the fuzzy ride and red rocket bundle when I bought it the day it broke. That being said the bunker is usable just bad design so I bet refunds might be harder
---
Oh when that update comes out the unarmed bloodied build is extinct you‚Äôd die too much
---
Actually, stacking 6 20% damage bonuses gives a 298% damage boost overall.
---
This is why multipliers need to die as has been done on the pts.
---
How they got me was I visited their vending machines. While I was scolling through his shop he placed tons of broken spike traps under me and went to the c.a.m.p and repaired them and they insta killed me...I'm assuming traps like that in peoples camps can damage players whether or not you are in pvp mode. Most of the videos on his account was of him doing this to many others. I did report it because it didn't seem fair since we weren't in a pvp situation. He would also lock the room we died in so we couldn't get our junk back the only way to do it was if we picked it and initiated pvp but he was ready with very good weapons on the other end. One guy on the server did manage to kill him and get his junk back though.
---
Yes Yes Yes if you ever visit my base nr new gad you will understand.
---
Absolutely agreed. The payoff for a bloody build is high damage but the drawback is that you are basically one shot all the time, the only real defense is either killing them before they kill you or avoiding their damage
---
no way
---
I find the Commie collectron gathers enough soups and such to keep me fed in between visits back to the camp.
---
You are welcome.
---
I can't disagree.
---
Nothing wrong with saying no. Nothing important in those presents he can‚Äôt earn through the BoS donations or through casual vendor searches. Nothing rude about valuing your items.
---
Really enjoy the main storyline. Don‚Äôt just skip over the dialogue to get done quicker. You‚Äôll run out of good fun quests before you know it. Then the game becomes a grind.
---
10% lower outgoing damage is less than half the difference between normal and hard difficulty in the single player games. And I already mentioned that if One Wasteland works correctly, then new players should not run into enemies that are too high level for them only because of being scaled to other players. Not having to fight level 62 ghouls around Whitespring as a level 20 player makes a bigger difference than losing a few percents of damage.
---
Shoulda brought more stimpacks bruh
---
and animals that you can't find on public servers
---
Yes I have, and I've even relogged and triple checked
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
At least you can do it ffs us console player for pushed off at the last minute
---
Sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings. But I do believe Bethesda is the Evil Empire they are. I see them try and Nickle and Dime us in almost everything they do for a broken game. If you choose to ignore it is not my problem. Done talking about this subject! I am not here to argue about who is right or wrong. I stated My Opinion and that is the end of it.
---
Yeah I'm pretty mad. I switched over to mainly unarmed bloodied 6 weeks ago. I got my time's worth but the risk is too high. It's not fair when sneak is the reason. You should be rewarded with unarmed melee, not being sneaky.
---
The kobayashi maru
---
Cool that was the only change that I felt iffy about
---
Protect and... Conquer
---
I have to stack 2 in the cabin to get them to sit right.
---
Well the great thing about video games is that they aren't real guns and can follow different rules. If we were to go and pick apart all inaccuracies of the game it qould be no fun. I.e. you shouldn't be able to take a bullet to the face, power armor (even on frame) weighs more than 10 lbs, radiation is not representative of real life. Just enjoy the game and stop being a stick in the mud
---
Maybe it's got a damage threshold similar to scorchbeast queen for the rewards?
---
r/unexpectedfuturama
---
Does the shotgun have any legendary effects?
---
And then another one....
---
Restart the game, it'll load in fine. I had the same problem once a few weeks ago
---
Yep pretty pissed about it, everything floats, I covered the floor in carpet to kinda help but the fences also have no gate so theres that too
---
im just worried because of how unreasonable the damage is im one shotting mirelurk hunters and charred ghouls from 20 feet away.
---
üòçüòçüòç
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand... unarmeds don‚Äôt want pitchforks &gt;:(
---
I read it as straight up sneak damage.
---
Nope just a normal shot gun i made and modded.
---
Ffs, it‚Äôs even floating in the promo picture
---
Just give me my damn Raven.
---
uh... the emote is only in the bundle. 
---
you thought they‚Äôd do something decent?? lmao
---
I got to launch a nuke before I realized console player don't get the event :D
---
Yeah.  I really hope it's real, but we'll see.
---
Oh weird, thought it might have been one of the magic ones, no idea then
---
you sound like the DEBBIL!
---
Responders and Free States, my man. Responders and Free States. Factions unique to 76 should be front and centre.
---
There was a whole new event boss quest released today, free community challenges going on with free rewards, in a few days meat week starts again with even more stuff to do and earn for free 
---
Just seems like an odd time to focus on this one thing rn
---
Oh hell, i pick up any plasma ammo as i go along, 2 caps i'll maybe go for, but 5 caps each...haha i think not!
---
Good way to look at it. I think nothing of spending 750 atoms on a beer.
---
They need to fix the floor. Everything floats in there.
---
Can you expand on that
---
I don't want you to be burdened with this responsibility, I'll volunteer to do it
---
Good luck on that one. It‚Äôs insanely rare.
---
Ahh, thank you
---
Bro it's easy to miss and some people don't care about this game as much as you do
---
dont even think about milking me!
---
There's a market for everything
---
You have to know the plan for the jet pack for the particular type of power armor you are putting the skin on.
---
And then only release it on pc
---
Bethesda needs to focus on adding terraforming to the camp system should have been on the list when they started modifying it for 76 tbh
---
He's being sarcastic dude
---
I have a feeling the foundation was supposed to be thicker, but they messed it up and now the foundation is too thin
---
*Our* Raven, Comrade
---
which week?
---
The enclave underarmor is bugged with a lot of outfits
---
Do you have the jet pack plan for the power armor you‚Äôre trying to skin?
---
Half the charisma checks on here don‚Äôt even give you anything. Sometimes the dialogue isn‚Äôt even informative! Only reason to run a charisma build is if you like the idea of being a healer, which really is more just giving friends buffs while you sit on your butt and suffer than actively doing anything
---
I don‚Äôt even pick up legendaries anymore, I log on, do daily challenges, then log off
---
I'm also curious if it comes with a gate
---
Done 4 Colossal Problem events, with 4 completions. Only 2 gave rewards. So  it's 50% working I guess. 
---
It just half works.
---
You mean like vault 94...I hear it's coming back next year but completely different.
---
I'm bloodied over lvl500 with a b25/25 fixer, so don't think that's the issue.
---
Bro even Hellen Keller saw this fuck up cmon beth
---
For the proletariat!
---
Don't get excited, people, Beth gonna fix this cool bug before they fix the important ones
---
The brahim outfit... I need it :0
---
What platform are you on?
---
the respawn bug was unacceptable before colossal problem.
---
but now we can't even complete/get the reward from the event we had to go through a nuke launch to achieve is beyond pathetic
---
15th Dracon Mercenary Company, reporting in!
---
It‚Äôs a spearuhsee
---
And the decades old engine
---
Rough times. We truly are living in a wasteland
---
Console player here - what event?
---
Oh sorry should have said, I'm on PC
---
Contact bethesda and try for a refund
---
The drum mag doesn‚Äôt much more than the stinging mag so 90 rounds sounds about for a quad.
---
If they‚Äôre going to debuff bloodied in general they need to make the hp req lower for receiving buffs. I always run at 30-40% because I just can‚Äôt handle the constant dying between server lag and boss/swarm dmg.
---
I was sneaking the whole time. I didn't really try anything else. I wasn't having any trouble staying in caution even out in the open.
---
Tell em you had a better offer
---
Capitalism isn't the only alternative to communism. You can dislike both.
---
QA Team went to get milk. Just like my dad....
---
Im the same, all recipes go in at 5 caps, pretty much all plans go in at 10 caps, apart from power armour (not ultracite!) which goes for 20 a piece and all ammo for 1 cap each.  I don't care if people re-sell stuff, id rather get rid of 2000 5.56 at 1 cap, than have people buying 200 because ive overpriced.
---
This is a feature that I am definitely in favour of.
---
Assuming its actually fixed, I reckon its gonna require re-placing to work. Try it out on another character or something
---
I don‚Äôt even play bloodied full time and I still get killed by server lag!
---
(XB1) yes for gods sake. 3 crashes in an hour in a half, kill me
---
No gates. But they do snap together and also snap at angles. I personally think their kinda cool. 7/10.
---
Already requested a refund.
---
Ah damn thanks I'll try that! There goes another 4 hours lol
---
Please go back and re-read the whole thing. Or at least the tl;dr.
---
Maybe I wasn't clear. **It's the "one wasteland" adjusted critters that take excessive amounts of damage to kill.**
---
I could still kill the lvl 50 protectotrons with reasonable ease without special targeting. 1 to 2 shots. They were not one wasteland adjusted content.
---
The level 50 radstag doe was "one wasteland" adjusted content.  it took **4 HEADSHOTS** to kill. **HEADSHOTS**. **FOUR HEADSHOTS.** The kind of headshots that get bonus damange and show up as yellow in the damage numbers.
---
It didn't take 4 toso shots on a level 50 protectotron to kill it. And it's an armored robot being shot in the toughest spot.
---
Why is four headshots signifigant? that's only four times the normal amount of bullets? Because that's a WEAK monster. A non-threat.
---
I went through more than two hundred rounds of .45 dealing with the camp of one-wasteland adjusted gutsys and assaultrons.
---
I would have gone thru all my .45 with the level 80 SB they aggroed except my lever gun broke and I had to resort to pulling out my TSE minigun. That took over a thousand rounds at 1-3 damage a shot. On live that TSE Minigun would does 4-7 dmg/hit on a lvl 80 SB. With no heavy weapons perks.
---
One wasteland isn't going to make it challenging. The AI will be the same dumb AI. It's going to make everything bullet spongebob armorpants and the game a grindfest.
---
Lmao why can‚Äôt Bethesda do anything right?
---
Well that‚Äôs some bs. It‚Äôs not that easy to miss.
---
Yeah, the other day I "sold" two nice weapons, so for the second one I was already maxed, but I was in the middle of an event with just one low level person and didn't want to leave it and have it fail.  Oh well.
---
I'm thinking that IF they still want to use that event, they'll do it in november when the actual US elections are taking place.
---
They were part of the update. Consoles didn‚Äôt get the update. Only pc got the limbs as of now.
---
True but, I only things ever manage to sell are bullets and the odd chem every once and a while. I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm selling them for a pretty good price considering the rarity and time it takes to collect the necessary ingredients.  What would you think a fair price for it would be? I don‚Äôt want to have to go lower the 45c mostly because at that point I might as well just sell them directly to NPC vendors for a net gain.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be that slow to get to 50, even as a solo, now that there are public teams. I made a new character a week ago that is level 56 today...And no, I don‚Äôt play all day. I have a full time job and a family. I play for maybe an hour or two at night after the kids go to bed. What I do, though, is prioritize intelligence as a stat (up to my build level), and religiously track my buffs.  Brain fungus grows in the vault tec ah center near flatwoods, which makes a soul that boosts INT. Cranberry cobbler gives +5% xp bonus, cranberry relish +10%; the recipe for the latter can often be found at the white spring recipe vendor. If you get the herbivore mutation, those become 15 and 25% xp boosts. Egghead mutation also boosts INT. Being (and maintaining) well rested is another 5% bonus. Path of enlightenment pops often and is another 5% bonus. These things stack! If you‚Äôve got any unyielding gear and don‚Äôt mind running low health, you can get to where you‚Äôre getting near double XP every time you play. Run leader of the pack every time It pops and get some low level unyielding to make new characters with. Next, make a shit ton of molotovs, and every time you see line In the sand or guided meditation, or radiation rumble pop, go to them, and splash damage every thing you can. When the bigger guys kill the baddies off, you‚Äôll gain mad XP.  My main is level 172 now, and I still can gain a level every hour this way.
---
Edit to add: herd mentality is awesome as a mutation now too, as it counts even if you‚Äôre on a public team with just yourself!
---
More games need to be like Destiny and ESO.  I have those on multiple platforms and the same character across the board.  Even my Stadia account, which I have played all of 3 times has them on both those games.
---
I'm at the point where I'm wishing they'd remove legendary enemies and kill XP from the enemies at Radiation Rumble. Too few people run for ores.
---
That's a real bummer. I'm at work and was looking forward to this bundle but I may hold off if the boundary boxes/collision meshes or whatever verbage they use is off.
---
Agreed. What other system did you have in mind?
---
I stand corrected, people can put their deathclaw gauntlets down?
---
Especially with the legendary perk Around the corner ppl wanna stack up on lvls so exp is #1
---
Is the new event only on pc right now then ?
---
That would be a good comprise. 35%.
---
Also if it's console only, I will pay someone to go and shit on their lawn.
---
Got the mask from first visit, love it.
---
Fusion/Plasma cores missing from ammo loot sucks since these are two main weapons I'm using during that event =\
---
They could at least put lower drop chance or something...
---
I‚Äôll tough it out regardless because I‚Äôm a die hard fallout fan but man I would be a lot more receptive to it if the actual bugs and problems were fixed before doing this it‚Äôs like putting the windows on a house when you haven‚Äôt finished the foundation it just doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
Didn't this happen to something before? Like the pts had no issues then it went live and boom, it hardly worked....
---
I cant help you with your questions, but if you're worried about passing conduits through walls, you can still pass them through windows, then switch it back to a wall.
---
what about the respawn bug? thats plagued me since survival mode despite constant bug reports...
---
Unarmed is bugged in the PTS. It shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed like that.
---
Only chem I really sell are RadShields, I sell everything to the vendor.
---
For a Phantom Device? When I did sell them, I put them up for 100 each.
---
It has multiplayer?
---
yep this is a major criticism of the perk coin system .  Players who used up levels to respec were using up the very resource they would later need for legendary coins.  
---
It's unfair to retroactively punish those players and yet Bethesda has not acknowledged any of this :(
---
This all day.
---
Don‚Äôt rush it. The games quest line will push you into areas above your lvl. If you feel that things are too difficult, step back and just do some side quests until you are a higher lvl.
---
&gt; So they are not only NOT fixing VATS.
---
Yeah, the bow/gauss VATS bug is still there.
---
Then on the switch
---
those are resource extractors, under legal circumstances, they can only be placed above their designed deposits, though the inclusion of a terminal suggests it may be an ammo factory, something I thought was only available at a single workshop, so long as it was done legally, it's not bannable
---
Ohhh I‚Äôll wait for your post once the update is here, you kill that level 90 raider and he still drops a lvl 30 weapon!
---
Sorry but Bethesda clearly could not give a singular fuck for your problems, simply visit the Atomic shop, do your dailies and please bugger off so we do not have to buy more server spaces. \*COUGH AHEM\* Sorry we will pass this onto the relevant team... yes of course. lol.
---
Yeah I saw someone play and it took 4 fucking hits dude. If it's actually bugged then fine.
---
Also got the cursed harpoon gun, same stats.
---
Guys I have a joke, I wander into someones camp and see a jetpack plan for 3000 caps
---
That was the joke
---
20FPS on a One X says otherwise! ;)
---
Fascism and feudalism would apply I guess. I'm sure there are other alternatives too.
---
I've heard somewhere that bait traps do damage to camps even if you're passive, Don't know if it still works though.
---
Could be a good "experiment" on some trap camps.
---
I'm a CHR 15 build.
---
If you plan on being a support character then it can be great as you can share practically any card with any rank, provided, you know what your teammates need or can use.
---
The non-player vendor prices are also neat with it, I can sell serums for 500 caps.
---
For the wasteland story, surprisingly, I encountered many charisma speech checks. There are almost always other S.P.E.C.I.A.L. checks too so it is't that urgent to have high charisma. Also a full set of unyielding armor will get you +15 to your base stats anyway (except endurance).
---
You get a few damage support perks, Tenderizer and Suppressor as well as Party boy/girl and field surgeon to boost alcohol/chems without the need of swapping. Friendly Fire 3 came in handy during Fasnacht too.
---
My tradeoff is to sacrifice Luck, therefore, I can't run mutations for very long.
---
I'd say for non-support build, one would be fine with CHR 3-4 (to allow Lone Wanderer 4 or Hard Bargain 3).
---
Got me today but I died when boss was low, got back down the shaft to the bottom and randomly died, figured it was this.
---
I haven't encountered any bugs. Fill me in? I've killed it 4 times and getting rewards so what isn't working?
---
I'm already in the mindset of if they say it's going to be fixed or something is to be added...just go ahead and add at least a month or two to whatever date they say.
---
Dang, sorry to hear. At my guess, I would probably have to agree that it could be a bug from this patch. As usual with the spaghetti code, make one change and something breaks.
---
You mean they can pick them back up right? Since the bug will be fixed eventually?
---
what an ignormant mindset.  you can easily get 100+ screws by just casually killing the wendingos as they spawn and still kill the boss.  
---
You can repeat the event 3x using the nukes on each server so probably 4-500 screws and also earn the quest rewards.
---
So like, just how many fucking screws, exactly, do you think you need?  Cause you don't need more than 500 per day I can absolutely garan-fucking-tee. :P
---
Collect survivor tapes is still broken too - it won't trigger on picking up the Colonel tape.
---
QUESTIONS FOR THOSE WHO BOUGHT:
---
1: does the fence require a foundation to snap to, or can you place it on the ground?
---
2: how much power does the Vault-Tec prototype generator actually generate? My guess is 2 or 5?
---
3. What's the height inside the bunker? Can it have a power armor station?
---
Good news everyone..
---
Just chairs pfft?
---
Joined a party yesterday and eventually one party member started doing the Follow me emote at his base. Went and saw him sink into the ground. He'd gotten his daily quest terminal and part of his base underfround. Set the lower part up to look like a pentagram and candles cause when you exited the terminal you kinda fell into the pentagram.
---
Earned his thumbs up emote that day.
---
Remove him, literally give us a quest to sell him to a horny behemoth that lives under a damn viagra factory. 
---
Foundation then replaces him with a noticeboard for stolen items. 
---
DONE.
---
Good.
---
I'm down to about 30 plans or so im missing 6 raider items from signal strength 5 paints for data 2 treasure digs and the rest are events.... I'm getting close
---
The 'clean sink' that everyone got for free will give you infinite dirty water. It's just a little slow to collect it because you can't spam the collect button like you can with a water source.
---
Wow okay "Fixed." So we can expect a fix when? Next month? By the end of the year? At this point when Bethesda says they will fix anything all I can do is laugh and make fun of their incompetence.
---
I don‚Äôt think ppl realize how tricky managing it can be. The biggest reason so many people like bloodied isn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs the meta as much as its pros just speed up a rather slow game and cons are severe but there isn‚Äôt a lot of short-term loss from them. 
---
I die a lot? Ok. Worst case I lose my junk and have to teleport back. But being able to one-shot vs 2 or 3-shotting just reduces the tedium of bad combat mechanics. Not to say a nerf isn‚Äôt warranted, but it was fun to be bloodied! The other builds just aren‚Äôt fun to play for me and trying to make bloodied just like everyone else vs bringing everyone else up closer to our lvl of play will just make things less enjoyable.
---
The event did not transfer over from PTS in one piece, it has broken mechanics, I'm guessing a hot fix or will be taken down to be fixed.
---
All three items are available as a separate purchase. Bunker: 700 atoms, Fence: 500 atoms, safe: 250 atoms, or bundle for 1000.
---
I need to pet Noodles. 
---
If ever you see my character tea bagging before a cute animal, rest assured I am declaring ‚Äúpet pet pet‚Äù as I do so.
---
I got the heads and the cursed pickaxe. This pickaxe is so OP
---
Sure.   On two of the daily quests, you have to find specific animals--Big Game Hunter and Someone To Talk To.   Usually the former isn't much of a problem, but the latter.....   if someone's hunted up all the squirrels or rabbits by the Whitesprings Service Entrance, you can nearly always find them on a private server there.
---
Console doesn't even have Colossal Problem yet, so this would be impossible.
---
I get the thing with toilet paper for 30k caps as a gag but when you have ammo any higher than 2 caps I won't bother even shopping. I'm not waiting in line at Walmart here n paying full price.
---
Worked perfectly fine for me the couple of times I have ran it
---
I think ppl really are just focused on the dmg and not remembering how much ho we sacrifice. If 35% gives me full buffs I‚Äôd take the dmg hit.
---
Glad you finally came out the closest.
---
We're proud of you.
---
This would solve so many issues. For how much money people pay for these items, its terrible how many bugs and issues slip through. More obscure things I can understand but many of these bugs are so easy to see just by building them that its clear that nobody over there is testing them properly.
---
Legendary Exchange's only limit should be the players ability to farm/find legendaries to scrip. Period.
---
I think in this case, they're farming ammunition from the new mechanic. Screws are just a nice bonus.
---
You sure you got the right one? Studying a Wiki before completing it, there are two Colonel tapes, and the challenge point might concern the other one than the one you are picking up.
---
I want to be able to sell him to a behemoth that wants a mate, and lives under a damn viagra factory, and hear him screaming for mercy as he is dragged off. 
---
Foundation replaces him within the same day with a noticeboard for stolen or missing items.
---
Sorted.
---
Fuck everything, I just want the plushie
---
And you can.
---
Wow this is giving me a good laugh , they still aten't on the vendor ? üôÑ
---
What about them promising camp and workshop persistence on private worlds?
---
Eventually *in the PTS* 
---
This new combat system will take another year to release lol
---
They will stay at your vendor forever until that specific player buys a couple. I used to craft nuka granades, phantom devices and nuclear mines until I noticed that it took ages to get rid of them
---
Seems appropriate for a communist product /s
---
Tent, Scrapbox, Private World and Monthly Atoms
---
Do they still put out smoke?
---
Working mounted guns would be amazing!
---
Yeah so seeing as your unarmed damage has been bugged so long on live servers I can understand your disappointment... 
---
Oh wait, your damage on live servers is fine!  It's only on the pts the problem exists!  
---
So yeah, feel free to get those panties of yours all in a bunch over a bug on the pts that has had exactly zero impact to live servers! :P
---
what is so weird about this though is that it was a surprise right? they didn't announce it and people weren't waiting for it. so they could have just not released it until things were fixed
---
That makes the B/25/25 bolt pipe I just bought for shits and giggles even more bad.
---
Oh me too dude. Then we won't be always about to die if we mess up once.
---
Guessing OP conveniently missed that info the 100 times it's been posted
---
nope.  patch 22 comes out next month my dude.
---
Respect to you and the build!
---
Don't neglect your C.A.M.P. You can use it as a free fast travel point, add a bed to allow you to heal HP (and get a +EXP buff after sleeping for a bit), and once you learn the plans, you can add some water purifiers and crafting tables. There are locations on the map with resource nodes that allow you to build extractors that you can loot periodically. If you're starting out, I'd recommend looking for a camp location with a junk node.
---
Believe it or not, I was oblivious the whole time.
---
Oh its only out on PC? That lame sauce
---
But, but...the roadmap says it will be released next month?!
---
Bethesda wouldn't give us a vague release date if they didn't intend to stick to it.
---
Guess this makes us blood*ied* brothers?
---
This post was about the sales and exclusive items, those are two separate things (though personally I don‚Äôt want persistent workshops, it‚Äòs better to just take them for things like challenges)
---
The Enclave also got a bunch of spec ops guys to provide the muscle though.  
---
I can't recall where I read it, but you could see the BoS as being a bunch of people trained at the level of professional soldiers, whilst the Enclave troops are a bunch of black ops operatives in terms of training.
---
Hahaha that's me!!! And Grahm walks right over and picks me up!!! He is a undercover JPD officer them ghouls got busted!!
---
does the fence require foundation or can you put it onto the ground? I want to fence in my crops.
---
Hahaha yup!
---
Apparently, it was supposed fixed last patch
---
&gt; magic weapons.
---
Has anybody tested magic weapons on PTS? I thought the magic damage was due to "computationally complex calculations." I assumed that part of the reason of switching from multiplicative to additive was to address that. 
---
Now that I think about it, I've got a magic shotgun on another character. I'll go check.
---
Don‚Äôt think combat was specified for this upcoming season, as they just began it. Could be mistaken though
---
It's one of the magic effects coming from either the gun or your armor. You wrote the shotgun is non-legendary, thus I presume you have a "Reduces damage while blocking by 15%" armor on you?
---
The non-VATS rubber banding is an indicator for some magic going on: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;t=68s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;t=68s)
---
I messaged a guy who was selling 5.56 for 5 caps a piece and he legit said ‚Äúsomeone was just here buying some‚Äù
---
Still no Ghoul Skins either ?
---
Commando is OP. It‚Äôs just the best all around. It uses extra ammo but do what when it‚Äôs been duped and passed around and with the new legendary perk for crafting....
---
Commando just has it easy. Archer, rifleman, non magic shotgun, gunslingers are just weaker than commando and heavy
---
Getting downvoted by commando users. I‚Äôve tried all. Commando and heavy are easiest by far
---
I haven't tried to place mine in a long time. What broke?
---
We are, tho. We all share North America. Everything else is just lines on paper.
---
We all float in here...
---
I‚Äôm trying to sell them at a competitive price usually between 90and 50c
---
So your saying just because you can‚Äôt one shot *while not aiming at the head* with a hunting rifle their useless? 
---
Idk about you but that seems fine to me.
---
Edit: lol look at these simps downvoting. Non auto rifles are still good.
---
Edit 2 : these min maxers are funny always wanting to one shot things. Why don‚Äôt you just play the game and have fun for once. O wait you can‚Äôt your brain chemistry has been warped around always following the meta.
---
Got a bloodied one with limb damage, cuts through enemies like warm butter. ü§ô
---
They did make a post saying it wasn't working as intended, so we'll see
---
Bethesda + damage nerf = laziness and poor ideas
---
It‚Äôs good for Nuclear Winter.
---
Mfw I saw the meat pile plans: :000000
---
The first time we went to run it, his body disappeared and the exit was still blocked for everyone who wasn't the team leader who launched the nuke.
---
They don't snap to foundation and there will be a gap at the bottom of the fence when placed on top of foundation.
---
However on the ground they work perfectly, you can sink them and adjust the height and angle.
---
The new Ammo Factory legendary perk will up your ammo crafting significantly. It may take time to grind out, but it‚Äôs one I intend to grab as early as possible on at least one character.
---
They have also said they are adding a feature to where enemies killed should drop ammo that matches your weapon type. I have even seen reports of PTS players coming out of Daily Ops with more ammo than they went in with, especially if you stick to a single ammo type.
---
Ammo production seems like it may still be up in the air. I am more worried about non damage legendary effects becoming obsolete. Vampires and quad will quickly lose value it they can‚Äôt output respectable damage. Same for anything but unyielding armor with melee builds. Bloodied and junkies are still going to be king from what I can gather from all the reports from PTS players. That will ruin the economy and what little balance the game has even further.
---
It's not even about the raw numbers for me. If it takes 3-4 hits to kill an enemy that can down me in a few seconds, its not worth it.
---
Both infinitely worse
---
Scorched
---
*confused exhale*
---
Just gonna get a liiiiittle mutation, Sharon.
---
Hey that answers a part of my question. Thanks.
---
I agree with you 100%. The rifle weapons are horrible. When I first started playing and doing pvp before they removed it, I was getting killed with tse sub machine guns and couldn't kill anyone with headshots unless they had full health and I used my instigating weapons. I ended up using strictly AA, furious, and TS heavies. Now the only thing I have to counter people at workshops is my TS Fatman with max explosives perk, or my homing 4 shot furious faster fire rate rocket launcher with some berry mentats. A lot of the enemies in game now are pretty resistant to single shot hidden headshots unless its a auto weapon with little recoil.
---
There is a name for that, NecroüôÇüôÇüôÇ .. bad Deadmano ... Bad .. at least take it outside before you stink up the house!
---
I‚Äôd put them for 75 and a couple regular stealthboys for 50 just to display price context to customers.  Stealthboys usually go pretty quick when I put them in my vendor, I price them at 50c
---
Does anyone want to RP as a communist anyway?? I don't get it. Some stuff is cool but where's my Responder salute and other stuff they left out of my previous bundles?
---
Meh have to agree to disagree
---
I saw a datamine for those bubble turrets
---
the devs said it's bugged and will be fixed.  relax.

---
On you?
---
In stash doesn‚Äôt count.
---
Did they fix the broke main quests today?
---
Nobody dropping a nuke? Or nobody joining after it drops?
---
I was picking up the one on his corpse. Do you know where the other one is?
---
Open access to the peoples CAMP. Seems legit to be honest.
---
So I‚Äôve noticed even if when I price them fairly cheap they tend to just sit around. The only thing that ever seems to sell is bullets. Not that I have a problem with making sales I was just hoping to cut a niche market.
---
I feel there should be more communist stuff if the enclave are getting brought back. the brotherhood are just trying to get tech. I know Maxin doesnt care about politics he founded the BoS to avoid them
---
On PC yes, console no.
---
I‚Äôve had five nuke mines in my vendor for the last 120 levels.  My nuka grenades sell really well though.
---
Old Texan proverb. Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice. Can't get fooled again!
---
Yes on me, I was trying to convert 10mm and I had 399 on me but it kept saying I didn‚Äôt have any when I would go to convert 100+ rounds but it works fine when I convert one bullet at a time.
---
Nah they're farming ammo. The wendigos drop more ammo than it takes to kill them with of whatever bullets you use, ultracite ammo included.
---
Destroy the wall with flame thrower and place the fence as close as you can to the wall frame.
---
Then just Repair the wall.
---
They had a bunch of atom shop stuff in the past. In fact it might have been the first big faction bundle. They had signs, cars, outfits, weapon skins. I wanna say May or June 2019
---
uh yeah my left leg does that. ill watch the video because i have no idea how that effects anything.
---
Don't mind me, just sitting here waiting on the return of the Free States bundles.
---
I don't know what "combat update" you are talking about but patch 22 will include the new damage system and one wasteland.  if those 2 don't qualify as a "combat update" then maybe I missed a memo somewhere. 
---
If there was some other large scale combat update announced other than one wasteland, got a link?
---

---
Bigger problem - thousands of atoms worth of items added to the atom shop recently.  How much content has been added to the game in that time?  Not a whole lot.
---
Well still, who's to say "as intended" is all good? I don't want to have to result in spamming stims all the time, maybe that's what they want. It's good that it won't be that bad but I still have to see when it's actually out.
---
well that's not very kind
---
I used to, when I had a regular team to run with.  Support builds are gold in a team setting, not so much solo.
---
I was able to deal with it before because I could fast travel away and still get back to the SBQ before she died but now when it happens it means I'm done with the event and get nothing. Now I want this shit fixed
---
Are you referring to the responders?
---
Thanks! Wish more people handled the discussion like you. Think more bloodieds would be open to discussion a nerf.
---
I like both kbm and controller
---
Yeah I got one on my first run.
---
Ran it a couple times, only problem I had was a crash while exiting the area.  Rest of my teammates (we had 6 or 7 on a private server) had zero issues.
---
Seems like a decent event overall.  Tons of screws...
---
No, Free States stuff. They even gave away a free sign during that week
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs a really good idea. I‚Äôm definitely going to try that and see if there‚Äôs any influx in sales.
---
A Saloon Building Set would be cool.
---
I already read your post the first time and understood it. 
---
4 headshots for a level 50 radstag. Ok.
---
You admit yourself it isn't all creatures so all those numbers regarding the Protectron are just that, numbers. The effective result is much the same.
---
It really sounds like your issue is One Wasteland scaling, or rather than SHOULD be where your problem lies.
---
Yet, that's not your issue at all. Your real problem is One Wasteland balance. You're just not willing to admit that.
---
Btw, it honestly makes you look ridiculous saying something taking 4 bullets is a bullet sponge or a grindfest. It's a laughable statement on the face of it.
---
I'm willing to bet that you'll still be playing the game despite the changes. Though, feel free to prove me wrong.
---
Anytime üëç
---
That niche market may exist but it's too small to deserve the effort
---
I think they have a BOS bunker you can earn as a Daily ops reward. Saw it on some datamines
---
The x100 isn't 100 rounds, its 2400 rounds. The x1 is 24 rounds and x10 is 240 rounds. If you only had 399, then you didn't have enough for the x100. Its a multiplier for the base amount, not how many you are turning in.
---
Time will tell but of all my builds I've tested on the PTS my 2 handed melee feels the least impacted by the "nerfs" people are screaming about.  I can ohk lvl 100 super mutants, which is I guess the equivalent of lvl 68's on the live servers.
---
Based on that I'd expect that unarmed will still be viable, though as with all other builds bloodied will see the largest drop off from live.
---
Same thing used to happen in GW2 (till Arenanet changed how events give rewards), this is not an exclusive thing to any game lol
---
Combat just generally meaning the new combat improvement such as enemy and dmg mechanic updates. But hadn‚Äôt seen any discussion over dmg mechanics being changed until PTS went live. Have you seen somewhere where they said additive dmg will come with patch 22? Seems pretty premature when they haven‚Äôt done anything but switch an x to a +
---
He or his team is probably gonna try pvp or drop kill u for the junk back...tell him no
---
I was seriously considering buying this when I got home later. Sorry you had to guinea pig it, but gawd bless you posted about it. Thanks.
---
Scrip used to be a way to eek out a few more legendaries every day. Now its an integral part to the crafting loop.
---
We need at least 400 per day
---
I've never been able to sell a quantum grenade for more than 75c
---
Ah. Yes, agreed.
---
I understand. I don't run bloodied so I know single shot weapons have always been shit. I can one-shot the vast majority of common infantry with J levers and railways without sneaking but the DPS on anything spongy is complete trash. Instead of blaming the damage nerf, people should pushing for single shot weapon buff.
---
Done it two times today. I laughed so much with my character running around+hands up in the air and the fear emote. That was mighty funny!
---
OP is talking about bolt actions not non autos in general. As evidenced by the post title. The space between shots is too long if you‚Äôre dealing with a mob. Less of an issue with a lever action or semi fixer or the like.
---
it's like geonosis all over again; send in the clones!
---
How does it look with your gear? Any texture or clipping issues? I‚Äôd love to have this helmet since it comes with a normal light
---
I was wrong about the nerf, it seems more broad than I heard. Although I'm still not worried. Have a good day
---
Project purity?! we can bring fresh water to appalachia! James and Dr. Li will be so happy!
---
Issue is the time it takes in between shots. Some weapons should be able to one shot
---
I‚Äôve done it twice now. Got another cursed harpoon gun same stats.
---
Nice. I do that a lot actually. Was just wondering if it worked
---
It's this 100%. Even if the event fails, these people still get rewarded. There's very little incentive to successfully complete the event.
---
If you tied all the XP and loot to the successful completion of events, you watch how quickly these same people focus more on the objective.
---
I love you
---
People of appalachia, do not interfere, our intentions are peaceful: who could throw away this used toilet paper?
---
Is it max level? Please tell me it‚Äôs not
---
I figure there‚Äôs a lot of crossover between Bethesda‚Äôs QA team and the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation‚Äôs marketing team.
---
We don‚Äôt find Abbie‚Äôs corpse either.
---
I am writing into my novel that she‚Äôs alive and coming back to Appalachia.
---
Im dead üòÇüíÄ
---
Past pts's are previews of the next patch.  So I'm not sure if they said explicitly the damage changes will for sure come in 22 but unless it gets delayed like legendary perks and colossal problem I expect it too.
---
Another factor to consider is CAMP location.  You may sell a couple in the Forest, but it‚Äôll never be worth your time/resources as most of your customers will be low levels who don‚Äôt know how to use them effectively and/or are strapped for caps and need to prioritize buying things like ammo.  If you‚Äôre set up somewhere like the mire, you‚Äôll catch a lot of people who use sneak crit builds and do SBQ runs a lot.   And there‚Äôs always the option of setting up near Cryptos to catch anyone who happens to be doing that quest.
---
We all float down here, Georgie.
---
Wow I feel so dumb I didn‚Äôt know they had changed it, I thought they only changed the UI. Thank you for letting me know, I was a bit confused
---
The thing is vats is what your supposed to use with these kinds of weapons. Head shots is not a problem since it‚Äôs always going to be 95%.
---
Also your false when you said not non auto In general. He said going rifleman sucks now which is all non auto rifles.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I never learn the BOS elder paint plan and I don‚Äôt play a lot anymore. I‚Äôll give you one if you want. Just don‚Äôt learn it or you can‚Äôt get any previous plans.
---
Could you remind me who abbie is? I don't remember an abbie
---
Aw beat me to it.
---
Fun fact, you can change the ammo type those produce even if they‚Äôre locked, so change em all to .38 to fuck with these assholes
---
Most toxic players i have met are anti pvp food builds
---
It is.
---
They probably got their pricing from Fed76. The dev admitted himself recently that they're prices are over-inflated and have zero bearing on what prices these things are actually sold in-game.
---
Standing in the middle of them and hearing a chorus of that was a highlight of my night.
---
Sometimes. But than after that it will never be funny again. Better to just let one or two out occassionally to stretchout the half dozen lifespan as long ad possible
---
Are you equiping the bloodied weapon to view its damage?
---
Im pretty sure unequipped it shows damage @ 100% health, but when equipped it shows actual dmg based on your health.
---
Also ts is (base *25%)/2 irc so paper damage would be higher, than say a base / AA or furious. Aka two bullets @ 92 dmg each vs 2 bullets @ 184 dmg each, the 184 is split into two.
---
Abbie‚Äôs Bunker? Where we repair the Scorched Detection System questline.
---
The only proper way to build the bunker to put the Fasnacht balloons in it and call it a day.
---
Drop bears? WHERE?!?
---
Oh yeah i remember now.
---
I never make the quantum grenades, I like having the rad effect of the regular nuka grenades.  I sell them all day at 50c, if I bought the nuka cola for that batch, I‚Äôll price them at 60c and they sell just as well.
---
no idea. i haven't checked the notes.
---
Don‚Äôt die....
---
Event rewards and creature drops/exp should only be given at the end of the event after it has been done SUCCESSFULLY. only way I can think of to fix this mentality
---
OMG! Four whole hits?
---
Whatever shall we do?
---
What‚Äôs bugged this week?
---
I just hit 100 on the pass so I loaded up to see the store but didn‚Äôt bother playing.
---
You must be new here. Feeling skeptical of the next patch and update is a baseline feeling that everyone has.
---
You have a magic armor peice that affects vats shotguns
---
I‚Äôve noticed nobody really likes mines that much. Nuka-products however tend to sell fairly well.
---
Damn I was about to say ‚Äúyou found Abby?!??‚Äù  Isn‚Äôt there a third major player (meaning named and a responder) missing?  Someone from the airport but I don‚Äôt recall their name...
---
Really?  Source on that?
---
Fast traveled into the event, said there were 6 people there.  There were 3 counting me and the other 2 were in their 60s.  After burning up a bunch of ammo for about 5 minutes and it was only down 15% they left.
---
So now what?
---
So I figured I'd explore since I dropped down so fast, but when I fast traveled out, I couldn't rejoin.
---
So...yay?
---
Why aren't you mad? Seems like the most sensible thing to be given you'd paid for this poor experience and Bethesda is doing little to fix the issue.
---
I sure hope not. Not saying you‚Äôre wrong, but the thought Bethesda would‚Äôve ended think they could  make such a huge change in less than a month‚Äôs work really worries me where their priorities are when they should be working on making sure the BoS storyline meets above the standards set by Wastelanders.
---
Its secretly run by Vault Tec
---
Cheers. It only started after the last update. I'll try that
---
Total agree with the overpriced vendors, I don't personally sell legendary weapons, but my extra plans and recipes I sell for like 50 caps max
---
I have 10 mules who all weigh somewhere north of 1100 pounds. I am a hoarder, just incase some effect goes magic. In reality, I would love to scrip it all. I can only imagine how much data the game would no longer have to track if they allowed unlimited scrip.
---
I thought this thread was going to be about radiation rumble
---
Yessssssssssssssssssssssssss!
---
what is funny/sad is that project paradise is the perfect event for this mentality. kill everything and loot it, but no one plays it even though you get 3 legendaries at the end if accomplished
---
A incomplete fence has descended across Appalachia...
---
I powered through to 40 because I wanted that big orange supply crate stash.   3 weeks ago I unlocked that and now I "might" be level 41 lol.  I'm just trying to finish the season and take a break from the game as a whole to figure out if I really want to keep playing it in general.
---
I think I know who you are talking about....but I really want Abbie to be alive.
---
Did it in a group of randoms, 8 players all 190+. Just couldn't do it, noone was a bloodied build so I guess that is why. Everyone was just attacking the boss but eventually had to focus the adds because you get overrun, not to mention the annoying fear effect. The other time I tried it there were two guys running bloodied and the thing died in less than 3 minutes.
---
Yeah.   The only time I ever use mines (and it‚Äôs rare even then) is when I hold Poseidon, I‚Äôll put a couple behind those doors that are opened with a terminal, over by the lunch tables just because I hate the defends there and enemies will spawn in that spot.   The other time I use mines is when I‚Äôm defending the chiefs doing solo silo runs, I‚Äôll use pulse mines there.
---
This is a trivial problem to solve though. You just push all the players onto the one server and test away.
---
Well unless you don't even have enough players to saturate a single server, which for me would be of greater concern for any PTS testing.
---
Thank you! Almost got lured in by the fence.
---
Yeah? 
---
Try to walk across the border and see what the mounties do to you
---
i watched the video posted above and while i dont fully understand its neat. But is it ok to keep using it? is it a bannable combo?
---
Right? I was disappointed not to see a fix for the camo SS underarmor.
---
If only was some sort of PTS that could test these problems out before hand.
---
But should we really expect anything else at this point?
---
After Wastelanders I always take any update/new content with a fucking huge grain of salt and have low expectations. It's the only way to really enjoy what the game is anymore, just don't expect much.
---
ahhh console player my bad, so at least they are in the update lol
---
I swear, sometimes I wonder how they can mess up this much shit. Then again, look at the ‚Äúleadership‚Äù of our country
---
I often wonder are they really idiots or is it really like two poor people frantically trying to solve everything alone because that's all the budget the game gets.
---
I‚Äôve been posted up in the white spring golf course near the bunker entrance. I should definitely move my camp more towards a mire. Do you have any other suggested locations?
---
They will fix it.
---
1. Which Power Armor?
---
If you are trying to do it on Excavator armor, that doesn't have a jetpack mod.
---
2. The Red Communist jetpack is a SKIN for your existing jetpack,  you need to already have a jetpack fitted to apply the skin to it.
---
I missed it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
OP missed it, and I guarantee others have as well
---
What timer?
---
I've come across one like that, not as big though. How does one get ammo factorys like that? Or is it hacks :0
---
No it's no bannable, and it's called magic cause no one fully understands it. Having either certain legendary effects on the shotgun or having blocking damage on an armor piece produces that glitch
---
It isn't optimal, but they will fix it and the bunker is too cool not to have. We brotherhood types love the smell of concrete and steel.
---
I would buy so many atoms for an Order of Mysteries bundle.
---
I don't think you were missing anything, only that no one was controlling ads. 
---
I have not finished the event, just had the same experience there was like 10 wendigoes alive at any one time so I spent more than half the event time killing them instead of doing damage.
---
I can't see how it would be bannable. You haven't done anything but use items in the game as intended. I've got a magic armor piece too and I'm riding the shotgun train until it's patched
---
Try using the rug glitch
---
Can you provide proof that "people have been banned for them"?  I have yet to see any proof.
---
At this point, who is surprised?
---
You'll float too.
---
I always carry a shovel for the "the buried with honor" daily quest. So I will honestly pay a decent amount of caps (10k) for this shovel.
---
Unless you‚Äôre a level 10 with no build, this is either insanely exaggerated or you‚Äôre playing with some pc mods. It shouldn‚Äôt take anybody more than like ten shots, unless you‚Äôre using a minigun or lmg
---
Even tho I pay for first it doesn't help you with any kind of stash problem except you can hold like 3 more gstling lasers with your junk removed lol you can't scrap legendary, so therefor no junk received to use the unlimited storage for.
---
Why would they do that , when they can make a "new" bunker and sell it as a separate bundle ... now introducing the settlers bunker now with added windows, 
---
Seriously though the bunkers a glitchy mess and I have no clue how it passed QA test
---
Every server I've joined has at least 1 nuke dropped on the mine
---
Dont worry they'll screw up Daily Ops too.
---
I was gonna do the glitch to get the factory but googled it to see if it was safe first. Saw an earlier reddit post about it saying it was unsafe and not worth the ban
---
Toward the end of the week..
---
Yeah, that's the way to fix it, ignore the problem.
---
I lowerst graphic and I can complete it 2 times Ok, but I never have problem before. 
---
At the moment 4 cursed weapon, 3 of them the arpoon and only one plan
---
I'll be damned, that worked. Why on earth....
---
Until they fix it, don‚Äôt die.
---
Yea and they smell like rotting flesh
---
Because Star Trek didnt have sliding doors before irl stores did. 
---
I may be living in an illusion, but youre foolish if you think youre not.
---
Except that won't work if they have pacifist on
---
This is the first time I've heard of the new contextual ammo system. I'm disappointed that my conventional explosives build doesn't directly benefit from that system. I wonder if kills from those weapons /grenades will drop that random ammo like with melee weapons. otherwise it feels like a direct nerf to those weapons and they're already pretty weak as-is.
---
Ye supposed to be but who knows
---
Cool
---
Mines are so clunky in this game they take too much time to set up honestly. One of the only grenades I take the time to make are orbital strike beacons. There‚Äôs just  something so satisfying about tossing one at a SBQ when she‚Äôs landed and seeing a giant sky beam blaster her.
---
Only in PC so far not sure when it's coming to console users
---
I'm sure there were complains at first, but I'm sure those people just modded some actual standard BoS underarmor, got the same stats back and went on like nothing happened. I'm sure it was intentional, but if it wasn't then it was one heck of a coincidence since it happened at the same time the first BoS event dropped.
---
Yes but you have to.nuke the mine and stand in the center of the nuke landing with all your junk on you to activate the event
---
Lol. If others can, you can.
---
You‚Äôve seen all the issues today right? There is a reason it‚Äôs been delayed.
---
It is very shiny. Almost like power armor, which makes it hard to match color-wise with outfits. But I havent noticed any significant clipping issues. The padding around the head fits pretty seamlessly into any outfit that meets the neckline, and the mask itself doesnt seem to clip with anything noticeably. I dont think it allows for headlamp color mods, which is... disappointing.
---
I would be absolutely thrilled if the game allowed cross platform save like Destiny 2, my mate plays on PS4 but I‚Äôve invested too much time into my Steam save. I would buy all required DLC twice in a heart beat.
---
In stealth and shooting at the head is the only way to one shot a super mutant in the PTS. By the time you load a second round, the mob already moved and you're safer aiming at the body, which does a pitiful amount of damage, making an instigating hunting rifle a useless weapon. If it requires 4 or 5 shots to kill a monster, then you're just better off with an automatic weapon, or semi auto. But bolt action weapons have a very low fire rate, requiring at least 15 seconds to kill a single super mutant, while on the other hand, your semi auto handmade will kill it in 4 seconds or less. 
---
My point is, bolt action weapons need a damage BUFF. I'm talking about giving the hunting rifle 50 or 60 more attack points
---
Soon apparently, have no clue when but soon
---
I often wonder are the "devs" actually 3-4 Vietnamese kids locked up in Todds basement? Being forced to make atom shop items 20hrs a day just to get 1 meal? Maybe their so worn out that when their forced to make fixes they just end up fucking up? Its a good of theory as any tbh.
---
I can be removed, you just need to move your CAMP. When you move, everything will be in the stored tab as blueprints and you can delete it from that point.
---
This is neither here nor there but I don't think that updates to combat are necessarily going to take away from a storyline.  Dev's don't write the stories, writers do.
---
It's not like a dev changing the equations that govern damage will somehow cause the writer responsible for the storyline to stroke out.
---
Hopefully. :P
---
sheep.
---
So...do you have wood for sheep?
---
Take the duped acid for the duped gifts , you are losing nothing
---
Ye lol. There is also a reason why it was delayed the last 2 times
---
Rifleman, and the hunting rifle specifically, are actually very feasible in non vats, which is why they have a range of sights to help snipers. You can certainly vats with them but I dispute they are ‚Äúsupposed to be used in vats‚Äù
---
If you didn't download any mods then something happened to your install files, so you'll need to uninstall and delete and then reinstall. 
---
If you actually did download mods, then remove those as there isn't a workaround, and then play the vanilla. Possibly might need reinstall.
---
My hope is next DLC is responders and free states returning to take back their land, lead by melody and Abby.  One can dream we could get more free states and responder content...
---
At some point we have to admit that this is our fault. They keep making this broken shit and we keep rolling over and take it.
---
Well, it‚Äôs possible she was killed by a deathclaw or scorchbeast and well.... 
---
Eaten or mangled
---
Oh geez stop! You're such a prude. A lot of comments here are tongue and cheek and should not be taken seriously. So settle down there tiger.
---
It clearly was not intentional. If it was intentional it would have been in the patch notes. 
---
Obviously its supposed to be UA like the normal military fatigues.
---
Just enjoy the game for what it is! If you expect a "fallout" experience then you may be disappointed
---
Hide the Pain Harold, Hide that Pain.
---
Why would they extend it?
---
It's funny how many people on here say "I'd rather them focus on bug fixes rather than release new content" then rage when new content is delayed so they can focus on bug fixes.
---
By the end you‚Äôll be wishing it was over. There are only so many times you can go to that bbq lol
---
I agree awesome. Someone can play the hermonica and piano while we all sit back n slam some whiskey
---
You are being facetious, you know I meant that we are not all from the USA.
---
No 
---
We dont want another faschanat event remember the music  https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY
---
Meat week , Meat week , dont eat chally
---
Because it was supposed to come out today, and instead has been delayed, along with our patch
---
Is reading the subreddit that hard?
---
Well your post to me seemed like someone screaming bloody marry. The gun still kills shit that‚Äôs all that matters. A damage buff is fine if they ever implement that.
---
No need to call rifleman useless.
---
Hilariously mine usually sits at 289,  well below the 297 of my be plasma xD
---
I wanna buy it on pc too but I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm starting over. Only way I do that if they do like triple xp week or some shit
---
It's not new content lol. It's been getting delayed months and it is worse than it was on the PTS. How does that happen? Make it worse.
---
2 out of 3 semi-worked for me.  One time it just wouldn't let me in no matter how many times I tried to join.
---
Hey, when he‚Äôs right, he‚Äôs right.
---
I wasn't playing last year. I'm sure it will be like faschnacht but was wondering what the expectation was seeing that now other things have been pushed back.
---
That is pretty damn cheap. You get to choose how to stock your machines, but I'm pretty sure you can bump up that price significantly without compromising how fast it sells. Like, a 3* at 15 caps and 150 caps will still be an instant buy from pretty much anybody
---
Good to know. I‚Äôve only had them placed into workshops while on public teams and they could not be removed from there.
---
We certainly got our wackos, but yeah. Hell the other day I noticed the BoS banner pole could be put on top of the half-ring campfire as a dancers pole. Next thing you know, we had 4 dancers and attracted 7 others players to enjoy the show.
---
What is this
---
I'd hate to have to reinstall it with my slow internet. I saw a thread where someone said to delete the .ini files, I may try that first, what do you think?
---
Thanks for the quick reply
---
That should be impossible though since any way you split the math, none of the mags multiply by  4 to get 90. You would need 22 1/2 bullet magazines to get that amount
---
Just because you've known it was coming for a while doesn't make it not new content. 
---
It has never been released to live servers before today, that makes it new.
---
One day I was at lost home and decided to explore sparse sundew grove just south of it.  He was there selling lemonade for some reason don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs his usual spot.  I would give you the recipe but I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Is that really a song from it? Lol.
---
Ye but that have had months to sort it out.
---
Should be a pipe perk set. Works on any pipe weapon and includes crafting/repair perks. You could keep an auto, sniper, and pistol handy. Advantages would be ammo, repairs, more available perk slots and versatility. Drawbacks would be lower damage and durability. Maybe accuracy. 
---
They should include some kind of pipe gatling that might melt entirely or explode randomly, but does insane damage.
---
I know that bog standard super mutants one shot me at the "nerd rage" threshold at level 75, and I could not return the favor. So the end result was I'd kill one, have two on me, and usually get one more down before the three that were finally there got in a good hit and killed me. Don't suppose you have a link to your build? Not sure if I missed something in my build for survival.
---
Are you on PC?  Also do you use Launcher or Steam?
---
damage needed nerfing.
---
I mean doesn't hurt to try, also just make sure that the launcher says it has done all necessary updates.
---
Ah, yes.. paradise. Not purity. We've got a few years to go before that.
---
I'll agree that a controller is very nice sometimes. I actually did buy an xbox controller for stuff like Undertale on PC but if I had to rely on those little sticks for aiming in a FPS I'd be completely screwed.
---
I sell plans for between 5-25 caps for the most part. When they've been sitting around for weeks, I take them out, and dump them in the overseer box or drop them at a station or even at someone's camp. For whatever mental health issue that causes it, I run the Tipsy Taste Tests frequently, and those recipes will usually fetch at least 25 caps since it appears people don't like to run it very often, can usually get 50 caps for the Nuka Dark recipe. Same for Stimpack and other more usable chem recipes. I think people buy those more often since they just haven't dropped for them yet. I usually sell unwanted legendary stuff that is worth selling for hundreds of caps. Most I ever sold anything was when Meat Week first started and I sold a Tenderizer for several thousand. But it's mind boggling when I see people selling plans for market price, and 2 star legend stuff for 15K. Sheesh.
---
Excellent, ty!
---
And the safe too. Such a cool model for having another way of entering the stash box.... is it hard for them to make a container that maybe could give you 5, 10 or 20 extra storage space for valuable items? I know that the stash limit has to so with lag and many people on the servers, but come on. 20 extra space when I spend 1000 Atoms to unlock it?
---
I put in a ticket over a week ago, have yet to receive a response
---
Yeah , meat week has grahm saying meat week , meat week , dont eat chally 
---
Wonder if he has new lines this time
---
Died 4 times with falling debris.
---
I would probably pay 8k caps for a Mutant's AP Refresh Weapon Weight Reduction armor.
---
Also, there are certainly weapons I would pay 15k or more caps for such as a VE Harpoon Gun.
---
That being said, I see many weapons and armor way overpriced for what they are and I just shake my head.
---
Lol yeah... And it still has bugs because it's an entirely new type of event and has a lot of unique features all in one new quest. 
---
So again, do you want it working or do you want it fast?
---
Don‚Äôt ever do that again please.
---
I thought I‚Äôd be able to wait a year till I needed to hear the sound of the world ending.
---
Yup. It's pretty much instant
---
I‚Äôm not saying their completely useless out of vats. But to me in vats their killing speed is much better and more efficient.
---
Yeah probably lol especially since some of those are actually probably good legendaries rather than scrip bait. Lately i haven't been running SBQ though so I haven't had a surplus in a little but if I do I may bump up the price a tad.
---
I rather them test it properly before releasing it. Multiple times.
---
Yeah I'm on pc, I have it on the Xbox app for Windows 10.
---
I‚Äôm sure it will last the same total of days
---
You dont really miss anything, maybe a trash roll from Earl...
---
&gt;With the arrival of ‚ÄúA Colossal Problem‚Äù on Tuesday, we are moving Meat Week‚Äôs start date by two days so that everyone has a chance to visit Monongah Mine for the new event. Meat Week will now take place from Thursday, August 20 - 26. Primal Cuts events will start appearing at 11:00 a.m. ET that day so that you can collect some Prime Meat before the first Meat-Cook event at noon.
---
Thank you everybody, I absolutely love this community. I just wish the game was a little bit more stable haha.
---
I misclicked and bought the damn thing by mistake. Submitted a ticket to Bethesda for an atom refund; do you think they‚Äôll give my my atoms back? They can have the bundle back for all I care
---
I got my shop, bed, and all non-brewing crafting things in my garage. It's awesome.
---
Now I just need to find a place where a train car fits and looks nice next to a garage.
---
&gt; It's getting annoying to be treated like the console market is something to 'get around to later' 
---
Wow. The lack of self awareness...
---
Console players have everything geared to them. Patches are as infrequent as they are because of consoles. The UI and control scheme is setup for consoles. There are so many PC specific updates that just get ignored outright because it's just not a priority to Bethesda. They even openly admitted to it saying effectively that PC wasn't a large enough market and while steam changed that, pc-specific updates aren't a priority STILL.
---
80% of the vendor system's utility value is just a more productive way of clearing stash space than dumping things on the side of the road.  Its pretty surprising that people honestly treat it as a serious source of income.  Youd have to be ridiculously lucky or play 24/7 to generate stuff that has a general market demand to get 4 figures from more than that one player looking for that exact weapon/armor piece.
---
I sell every ammo type (only when i have them in great excess) for 1 cap except plasma cores which go for 5.  I make Formula P (20 caps) and Grape/Berry Mentats (15ea) and try to keep them in stock.  Ill slap a 2-3k price tag on 2-3 ‚òÜ Legendaries as long as theyve got more than one in-demand feature (bloody+FFR, AA+Explosive, etc) on a weapon type people use.  The only thing ive ever priced above 5k has been Fixer plans three times (and i got it within 2 hours all 3 times).  To keep it fun, i try to keep one machine stocked with uncommon/rare apparel for 1000 or less (Western w/ Chaps goes for 750) and quest necessary gear- chef hat, blank holotapes, Army papers, etc- for cheap.  Finally, i keep a newbie aid machine with all camp plans going for 20% of the recommended value (no heads except mothman, SBQ) and cheap purified water, disease cures/antibiotics, and cranberry relish/grilled radstag or other helpful items.  I keep it all in its own machine with a sign asking that it be left for low level players, but there are douche canoes everywhere.  Dont be that guy. 
---
If youre reasonable with pricing, you wont have full stash issues.  If your vending machines are somewhat organized, people will pay closer attention which leads to more purchases.  If it sits for more than a couple days, its too expensive or theres no market.  Legendary weapons have no value in and of themselves- if you cant think of when youd use it yourself, scrip it.  Dont be a dick and buy up discounted products clearly meant for new players.  Bethesda isnt going to take care of them, so its up to us.
---
Thought its somthing the whole community needed to hear, spirits seem low today
---
You forgot mutation serums .. 50 to 250 not 300 to 800
---
This is Bethesda we are talking about...
---
If the people giving the OK to stuff like this making it into the game aren't playing the game... WHY AM I PLAYING IT?
---
same with uranium fever and encryptid. everyone just stands around afk
---
You can only buy the special (with the Piper costume) once.  You'll have to drop another 2 bux for the same number of ~~caps~~ atoms.
---
On my 6th go and it‚Äôs quite buggy
---
I want sandbags walls as well, but also Quonset huts (those barrack buildings)
---
I have had this error many times without ever installing mods. I use the Launcher so I just scan and repair and that fixes it. Not sure what option you'd get on the Xbox app but look for something similar
---
That's the whole reason why there is a PTS. 
---
Man, are you even thinking through this fully before responding? The whole point of PTS is second level of testing after internal tests. After they believe most if not all bugs are worked out they release to live. 
---
They already fixed the main issue on PC and it's working right now for most people on PC live atm... And without any new major issues should be live on consoles this week.
---
I think everyone reads it by NEW and not HOT/BEST
---
No, it did not VATS needs fixing.
---
Hacked weapons need to be removed from the game.
---
Bloodied Melee needs a slight adjustment.
---
The glitch kill on the Queen when she spawns needs to be fixed.
---
over all damage does not need nerfing
---
And scrip machines to settlements would be nice as well.  Hell, scrip machines the purveyor runs and we can buy from too would be fantastic.  Sick of jumping all over the map to sit through loading screens for the one vendor that takes the currency you need to get rid of.
---
For LitS there is a place where folks put their FO1st tents that interrupts the regular scorch spawn and forces them to all spawn in a clump right in front of the sonic device. You get wave after wave, or rather clump after clump of scorched in the exact same spot for the whole event. 
---
You just need tag them (with a shotgun or any exploding gun or device) as they appear, and then get huge XP when they die. You can go up many levels in the course of one event, it's bananas!
---
But what have they broke to break it? Again...
---
Location, location, location.
---
Yeah, I know, I just like it when things work the way they're supposed to.
---
The big issue is that people want both. Bug fixes and new content. Both require a lot of work and most people will stay for new content over just bug fixes and they know this so they focus new content over bugs.
---
Okay, so I just checked the Xbox app and it says there's an update to install. That was probably my problem. Don't know how I launched the game when it needed an update, but oh well. Thanks for the help
---
In the past when events were delayed they extended it so they would last the same amount of time. I figure they will do the same thing. Even if they don‚Äôt, it comes back next month.
---
It used to, since the nerf its to weak to trigger the tag in my experience (the aura I'm assuming)  
---
i tried door camping in the sons of Dane event and got almost no tags from it despite hearing them get hit from the acid.
---
After buying the aluminum camper I would have been one to say void it at all costs, but they actually did fix the walls in the camper so there might actually be hope for them to fix this!
---
No worries :)
---
For sure they are with the weirdest fix only for PC. I didn‚Äôt enjoy logging in today for some odd reason.
---
Pts is way easier to do on pc as well
---
Well it works for Minecraft, doesn't it?
---
Damage needed nerfing plus other things.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs still meat week, why make it not a week.
---
And I imagine console players will get this as the game time as PC players. Not sure
---
With the way people sht post yes it is
---
I sell the masks at 50 each because I have a ton I hoarded but wanted to do the community a favor if they missed out. I swear my stash is suffering due to mask overload atm.  I did sell a few suns though.
---
There are different groups of eight. More than one group can do it per drop.
---
I need my enclave and BOS stuff,  it mainly enclave. I love a shiny new sci fi bass and the enclave is the best one to give me that.
---
Communism detected on Appalachian soil, engaging with lethal force
---
Give the prevalence of AFK in Fasnacht this year I‚Äôm guessing a lot of people will set their toons up on the drums or spits and go to work. Or at least go make tea during the event
---
That‚Äôs how I do it.  I throw them at other players usually lol.
---
Frozen Throne was Warcraft 3, not WoW.
---
Lol so then you agree with me that people can miss it pretty easy, cool I'm glad we reached an understanding :)
---
Hope you have a nice day
---
Damage definitely needed to be nerfed. Specifically talking about end-game optimal builds.
---
I'm 3 for 3 completing ok, can't find damn chest mind, isn't very clear where/when to look?
---
How sad you need to find excuses to being either lazy or stupid. Well have it I guess.
---
Yeah something is definitely wrong here. Do you run adrenaline? You definitely want adrenaline. Nerd rage, bloodied, adrenal reaction you should be getting substantial damage. My BE gat gets around 650 damage or so. A gauntlet should easily get over 1000 with appropriate strength.
---
Commie bunker, commie fence, bit to mention the commie armors and commie bad guy coming.
---
Two star weapons can be good, depending on the roll. Overall, I agree with you though. I'm sticking to the "quick sale" prices on Fed76 for mine.
---
Isn't abby in the house in the mire? The one with the workshop?
---
&gt;They have also said they are adding a feature to where enemies killed should drop ammo that matches your weapon type. I have even seen reports of PTS players coming out of Daily Ops with more ammo than they went in with, especially if you stick to a single ammo type.
---
I'm in the PTS and I can confirm this. I use a Flamer and when I leave daily ops I have more ammo than I entered with. Enemies wpuld drop 12-48 fuel each. It was awesome!
---
It is not addressed. However, this event doesn't immediately end when the boss dies. Sort of like Lode Baring, there is an "escape the mine!" phase afterward.
---
If Earle dies while you are respawning, there are rocks blocking the way back into Earles' arena which prevent you from going back to retrieve the loot. This got reported a hundred times and they kept it in.
---
Lol do you even understand what they are ‚Äúnerfing‚Äù specifically? So many people here need an education.
---
Let me give you a hint.
---
* how do you solve exponential damage increase when the system works multiplicative.
---
This should have been in the game at the start. But 2 years late I guess nothing unexpected.
---
Honestly The Fixer sucks compared to the Hunting Rifle for sneak sniper builds. And I hate that gun but that's the build I always use. I'd kill for some variety That I can one shot things with.
---
Amen. I don't understand why so many people like and want all this commie junk. I don't even care that it's specifically communist, I just don't want even more political stuff. We need more from the factions that still exist. Communism is basically dead in the Fallout universe... aside from the stuff they keep giving us players.
---
I just got knight so I'm missing like 4 before Elder I do thank you for the offer though.
---
It seems the only urgency then would be to loot the chest near the exit, to avoid dying from the wendigo spawns, and to pick up the quest related holotape.
---
You would lose your junk though, right?
---
Me and two other people just battled the boss and after a few deaths and all the ammo from my guass minigun. I finally managed to land the killing blow only to immediately insta-die from rubble without looting a single thing from the boss or the chest then be thrown outside. Needless to say I immediately quit the game.
---
It sounds like you have... the Curse of the Harpoon Gun.
---
My second go at this got me a 3 star bloodied gauss minigun. Bit surprised when that dropped.
---
All news is bullshit and they all have their own political agenda regardless of a political party be it CNN, Fox, NBC, ABC or any of them.
---
Oof well thanks. Here‚Äôs to hopping it stays on game pass.
---
how can it be so bad to not even tag weak mobs?
---
I've been able to complete the event.
---
It's pretty dark, but I can just about make stuff out, VATS certainly helps a lot, did you find the damn chest?
---
There already is a M1 grand in one of the fallout games
---
The contextual ammo is gonna be useful for my flamer
---
The Uranium Fever machines collect Ore quicker while destroyed than not.
---
Better than the people who run around not actually doing anything.
---
Meat is meat!
---
There's a blue ridge backpack? Or do you mean the crocolossus?
---
This shit happens to me everytime I die, and I use it as encouragement to not die, and it doesn't help that I'm a bloodied build.
---
Holy crap, shoot it in the head!
---
Thanks. I'm going to make a a list. The first time was at random with my first char(deleted) in the Forest on that LONG road up to the Sawmill that used to have Super Mutants.
---
Wait til you see the rewards for next season. I realize they are still in PTS and subject to change but I personally have less of a will to grind it out as opposed to this season where there are some rewards I really liked.
---
I might have the plans for this,I‚Äôll check when I get home
---
In other games pipe are the worst for the most part
---
&gt;Trump is putting the bugs in Fallout 76.
---
I'm out. I've heard it all.
---
You use that as justification that a massive corporation is SELLING communist items?
---
Iirc I saw in a data mine thread that when they nerfed it they fucked up the damage numbers/times so the acid effect is all out of whack.
---
  I also think they messed with how it applies, because my Tesla coil excavator (similar concept with aura) does not do constant low damage anymore, instead it plays SFX like you keep "hitting them" without moving the hp bar, then it removes a larger chunk of the enemy HP bar after about 15 seconds.
---
Controller &gt; mouse and keyboard in this game. Thank you trade interface
---
Oh man I just bought this before going onto Reddit.
---
I leave all my stuff unlocked for people who visit. Ammo, scrap, collectron, water, etc. 
---
The general rule is if it is unlocked, it is free.
---
Yep. 
---
Well i fortunately rolled a two shot gauss rifle with a magic effect. So I figure screw you Bethesda. You wanna skewer RNG to the point of absurdity il just exploit the system and destroy creatures with a magic weapon.
---
(In fairness of course, I'm not going to ruin other people's experiences doing so)
---
Eventually the new players will be old players, and they will get those perks. If people are so lazy they drop off before this happens who the fuck cares if they are not there any way. Fallout games should be hard grinds not hands outs.
---
I‚Äôve found vampires to be a great affix for this fight. Just go to town on spawns or Earle with no danger.
---
What chest? I've done the event twice and don't know what you're referring to.
---
It‚Äôs not out on consoles they delayed it for us.
---
Don't they test stuff before putting it on the shop? Isn't this borderline false advertising and scam? This isn't the first time atom shop items were released broken and only fixed after a long time or after several people complained about it.
---
If I just wanted a bunch of kills I'd go play CoD or Halo.
---
Your character would transfer though as long as you are transferring from one pc launcher to another.
---
Tied to each platform uniquely, doesnt even go between Beth launcher and Steam.
---
And don‚Äôt forget the buddy systemmm!!
---
But they still delay console release dates for error checking, if the console market is the main source if income,  surely you treat them as primary market units, and not as a 'hey, this is going to take a little while to fix on consoles, but we'll release it on PC, and see if a modder can fix this issue for us, copy their coding over to our official release to the marketplace later, ok?' style.
---
It's just getting annoying AF to be given release dates moved with no actual obvious testing on consoles, unless there's some in house console testing at BGS that we're unaware of, but players out in the real world have a knack of doing unexpected things that developers would never think of trying, and find new and interesting ways of breaking the game.
---
Seem like Commie merch is selling well
---
Ironic
---
Or maybe allow you to repair ally robots (if we get some in the future)
---
You can actually click "buy to own" on game pass for xb and pc if you want to just ensure you never lose it but tbh, I don't think it will be going anywhere. 
---
The devs made it clear they see 76 as a software as a service so they likely are keeping it that way.
---
What??? Who said trump did it? I‚Äôm just saying that that‚Äôs a great example of how somebody can fuck up everything they do. Not my fault two angry trump supporters downvoted me lmao
---
I've noticed that if I fill my vendors with Legendaries that I've priced dirt cheap, nobody will buy. It's almost like people just skim over them when they see the prices are 100/300 etc caps but are interested in why a weapon is priced in the thousands enough to consider its worth.
---
The PTS server is throttled to perform like a live server under heavy load
---
I didn‚Äôt know we could do this!
---
Oh I saw them. More armor and power armor paint for things I don‚Äôt use... and another handmade skin. Of all the stuff I‚Äôd really want out of it they put it at the very end with the greenhouse walls, and that makes me want them way less.
---
[that‚Äôs just the Riker maneuver ](https://youtu.be/lVIGhYMwRgs)
---
That's a positive for me.
---
There aren't many events I enjoy doing and i never do the mundane settler dailies anymore.
---
So I'm glad for the treasury notes.
---
Hey having enough people doing those bits was the difference between success and failure so it could be a good thing.
---
I'm tentatively thinking Junkie's with all 3 ranks of Tank Killer.
---
You need to be on the server as the nuke drops, but you don't need to drop it, joining the server after it drops doesnt work, you cant join the event. As it instances to 8 players max if you are 9 and 10 then you two are on your own :-)
---
Oh man sorry for your auto complete pain.
---
ok, thanks i will try that
---
Reason #7 to wear power armor. Targeting hud
---
Yep.  
---
Low-level player (25), but I sell very cheaply, I make ammo all of them one cap, nothing over 25 caps besides one bobblehead and a magazine, at 100 caps.  
---
My camp is right by Wayward and I gift low levels one-star level 5 weapons and some other stuff or leave it in bags near the overseer's camp...I try to be a good neighbor in the wasteland lol.   
---
I enjoy fast traveling to other's camps and buying plans, recipes, and sometimes other items but some people price the same stuff I sell for mucho caps, like really insanely high and I wasted caps to get there...no wonder you have 125 plans, 5000 ammo, and a bunch of other stuff, your prices are literally insane.   
---
I might get downvoted but I don't destroy anybody's stuff but if you are pricing ammo at 10 caps, stims at 100, and basic 'not cool' plans higher than like 25-50 or so I farm your food and whatever else for you while you are out...as said may get downvoted and told off here for it but my god they are greedy so I can be just as greedy with your corn, blackberries, fert, etc..
---
Saw this on PS4 earlier today. It was both sad and funny
---
"Slip". The items are barebones or even straight imports/reskins from FO4. They only fix stuff that a lot of people complain about, sometimes taking weeks or months. They are not even testing this stuff before releasing it.
---
YES! LOL I love those!
---
Totally. I‚Äôm not going to be able to play as much this year, just hope I get the tenderizer plan
---
Not really. You can easily set melee weapons to use ammo in creation kit. You can also set melee weapons like knives to be automatic and they'll keep swinging as long as you hold the button down
---
The problem is that pipe weapons are craftable from the start of the game. If pipe weapons stayed viable even after you obtain a bunch of new weapons you have effectively made obtaining these new weapons obsolete outside of niche builds and role play. 
---
I have a solution though. They could easily give us mods that make pipe weapons more viable.
---
Make the mods unobtainable by scrapping the pipe weapons, they can only be obtained by buying the plans from some vendor (maybe high raider rep)
---
That way it's balanced with other weapons. You still need to "unlock" these mods the same way you would unlock a shiny new weapon.
---
Blame MS and Sony then because they're the ones who make it so the tools needed to actually test and trace issues like they can on PC aren't possible for consoles.
---
If we can have an MG42 in 76 there's absolutely no reason we couldn't have and M1 Garand. I'd be all for it.
---
It is a potential reward in the second round of the Atlas Community event. So I think not until sometime around the second week of September??
---
Edit: I checked the ITV that has the Atlas Event schedule. If we hit the target, the sale will be from September 10-14
---
wow,that's bad to hear.I would say "let's hope they fix it soon" but I don't think they will...
---
Well damn, I got the rarest drop from my first go. I‚Äôm not complaining.
---
Ain't that a kick in the head
---
It‚Äôs called the ‚Äúbattle rifle‚Äù and appears with the GRA dlc for Fallout New Vegas.
---
when i died i tried to respawn on my allies, it put me outside and the event was no longer on my HUD or in the quest log, no reward either. just jack all
---
You're breathtaking!
---
Or you could buy your way through it all for the incredible price of ONLY! 15000 atoms!!!!!
---
Not being a dick. Pointing out other bugs I have experienced in the game.
---
If it‚Äôs the ‚Äúenclave‚Äù one you get from the events then you have to get enclave mod boxes for it or have it drop already modded, the plans you learned from the vendors could have been for the plasma gun
---
Pretty much, hopefully they fix it cause I used it to deal with those "stuck in wall" enemies.
---
if it does help a fire modded bow has an AoE like a molotov and works great for tags, I've seen it used by low level alts to exp farm
---
no, i was a level 25 (ish) with the weapons I had available to me. (Some flintlocks, molotovs, a single action revolver, hunting rifle, pump shotguns)
---
I would love to see some more WW2 weapons like the MG42 and Thompson. 
---
If the M1 Garand and BAR (both featured in NV) found there way back, they would be welcomed additions.
---
That's what happens if you die after Earle dies. Watch out for the drill
---
Well it would be hard for the brain dead arsepeices that work on this game anyway.
---
Also pick.up the holotape when you first enter, otherwise you have a hung side/optional quest until you next can get in there.
---
I feel like I'm the only player in this game not getting 150 scrip worth of legendaries every day but I'm not usually playing more than an hour or two. It should be higher though.
---
Also SCRIP
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scrip
---
What about these items is "commie" other than the name? They bunker is a concrete bunker with no markings, the safe is green, and the fence is unmarked.
---
You‚Äôre pointing out the bugs we like. You know they‚Äôll get patched. Get your tongue out of Bethesda‚Äôs arsehole and wake up! It‚Äôll be six months before they patch the Secret Service bug but next patch it‚Äôll fix the reload bug, you watch.
---
..james would've been happy. :/
---
fingers crossed then.I have 3.5k gold to spend
---
Thanks I'll keep an eye out
---
Found him twice in the Mire on the main highway. Also in the Mire up the hill where Sheepsquatch event starts. Good luck.
---
No gate for the fence either?
---
We? You maybe. Wake up a realise not everyone enjoys bugs.
---
If you camp outside of Charleston Station then yes, you are potentially affecting a random encounter that can be a rare vendor spawn.
---
Good thing I like my steak medium square!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go THAT far, especially compared to the dupers who have literally caused our vending machines and displays to be disabled in the past.
---
People were complaining about their lack of gold and silver?
---
Idk if your talking about NPC or other players lol
---
Excuse my newbie comment but what is 'scrip-ing' a starred weapon, is it the legendary exchange boxes at stations?  
---
Because I give away my level 5 ones to even newer players than me but still have a few laying around taking up scrap box space...what good are those scrips anyway, I have a few from the seasons boardgame.
---
Even though I think the community event is stupid. Im a BoS fan.
---
There‚Äôs so many bugs in the game already, why not have one or two that actually benefit the player, or that are fun?
---
I have my perimeter fenced in with them.  I love them.  Just wish we could place lights on them
---
Oh, that could explain it. At 25 I‚Äôm pretty sure you can advance to either laser rifles, ARS, or combat rifles. Pretty sure one of those is available at that level. You could also use excavator PA and maybe t-45 if I remember correctly. If I‚Äôm being very blunt, you shouldn‚Äôt be maining those at that high of a level, unless they‚Äôre god roll legendaries. If you have a powerful heavily modded hunting rifle, that‚Äôs kind of viable even in the endgame, but flintlocks, revolvers, and molotovs are generally irrelevant after like level 10-15ish
---
Thats ok. Ill make it my mission to grind for it.
---
It's to stop dickbags not dropping down and letting others work, then dropping in to loot.
---
I think he meant being able to visually see the number for how over you are on budget.
---
Currently on console, I cannot see the number.
---
Guy below just answered it. It‚Äôs a PC mod.
---
you can have a tent or a camp there and not mess with the rare vendor spawn. 
---
anyway
---
Lost home is a better place to find a rare vendor. As someone who used to spend hours looking for the one at charleston i can say for certain that one appears at lost home way more frequently.
---
But why would you play the regular game in the PTS when you don't get to keep anything you get? They opened up to all players because those with exclusive access to pts stopped logging in
---
That mentality is the same as the dupers, it's in game, why not abuse it to try have some fun. Hmm here's why not, because it's not an intended effect..
---
Were you on a public team?  If someone is sharing Aquaboy/girl (or if you have it equipped), drinking toxic goo will not increase rads.
---
I second that, what chest?
---
noooo, you cant just thank me and accept my opinion when im rude to you. Insult me , this is not the way it works!
---
Yeah, it's something to suggest. I know the issue of the missing ammo types has been raised on the PTS. Even a 10% chance of a fusion or plasma core should be enough to keep you stocked.
---
Silver is used for some power armour shit I believe and the gold I think was only ever used for the mole miner pails
---
This is a new system and this is the first event that uses it. I know the issue has been raised on the PTS about the missing ammo types so hopefully it will get fixed.
---
Maybe if we‚Äôre lucky they‚Äôll try it, it won‚Äôt work properly per usual and we‚Äôll be able to convert all our treasury notes and legendaries at one time
---
March of freedom event?? What is this?
---
constructive criticism?
---
Deep Pocket mod on all armor requires it
---
So its a race eh? IM ALL IN!
---
The next event, it‚Äôs not really March because they are changing the name to ‚ÄúArmor Ace or something‚Äù
---
Pink Asylum Dress.
---
Blue Ridge Backpack. Plan drops from Riding Shotgun.
---
Anyway was looking forward to farming can food better
---
Duping is totally different. That can actually have a detrimental affect on the player base because most duplication glitches rely on lag, which a Duper will happily deliberately cause in order to facilitate the creation of the conditions required to dupe. Take the Strangler Heart power armor dupe. How many times did you get crashed out of a server because a couple of dickwads wanted to dupe it? I know for sure I got crashed out while watching them do it. Many times. Does the quick load glitch hurt anyone at all? No? Let it be. Fix bugs that have been in the game since beta first.
---
I am being friendly, friend.
---
You can put power lines and connectors around your camp too. Much cheaper than generators.
---
Consider putting your vendors close to each other. Easier for people who like to shop.
---
I love that mod. It‚Äôs a shame that my T65 doesn‚Äôt have any head lamps.
---
I see weapon displays inside the bunker in the photo. Are they built in? Do they count towards your maximum display count?
---
I have always used excavator but I thought it was ugly until i started using atoms awhile back buying some skins that changed the look. Like blood raider I think and I also have x01 and t65. I didn‚Äôt like the look of t65 until I put captain cosmos on it and it takes away that weird looking gap on the chest. X01 has a bunch of nice paints for it to. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used any of the other t series power armors after I got excavator
---
no one here walks. We pay to ride in other people's cars.
---
More meant that the experience is of quality. As Bethesda has proved, you can have meh writing but still create a great experience. Subtle changes can make the difference between an NCR Ranger and a Minuteman. Plus, the easy bugs that should be easily fixable before going live.
---
The terms and items given for fallout 1st was changed almost as soon as it was launched. You will not be getting extra discounts in the atom shop, camp space or anything other that what is CURRENTLY listed on the fallout 1st page, plain and simple.
---
Lmao, well done
---
Ever get a chance to test that cryo? Wonderin how it does myself a poor console peasant.
---
Do you need a hazmat suit  or PA?
---
It wouldn't been Betheada if something "just worked" for the 1st time.
---
Haha now I feel dumb thank you
---
Where did you hear any of this info?
---
I thought Season 2 was revealed at QuakeCon and they called it Armor Ace when they announced it. And I never heard of this Cannery, are you saying it was supposed to be a reward but it's not on the PTS?
---
Mine too but I managed to get a video of it so I can see what I could have won
---
Oh thanks dude. üòÇ Same to you.
---
I guess I'll have to grind that repeatable xp one.üòÇ
---
Only to initially approach and enter the mine, and upon leaving back into nuke zone. Event itself is pretty rad free and  can be done in normal gear.
---
That's fair pricing an i would buy. Seriously though I've been shopping on my alt recently for new armor an its insane what people want for terrible items.
---
This is a very bad thing. I can't find any mods for it. I spend some time looking for it's mods every day. but nothing :(
---
Thats precisely why they should remove the limitations. Force them to add more content. Even with them its the same amount of content either way.
---
Thanks!!! I'm making a list.
---
Outside the shininess and no color mods that‚Äôs good to hear. I use the scout outfit with the scarf so neck seams won‚Äôt be a problem! Excited for it to go live on consoles so I can earn it. 5% chance seems like good odds to get it quickly if I really wanted it.
---
Tazbaz thanks but I‚Äôm on Xbox bummer - I appreciate the offer tho
---
I always assumed Stalkers would be good on Rifleman builds. Especially with stealth bonuses. If all you need is one shot...
---
Liberty Prime PA Skin if just vanilla PA XO1 for me.
---
There wasn‚Äôt much tbh. I do agree that more Enclave stuff should be the priority but there‚Äôs still not that much for responders or free states. We could do with more items for them as well.
---
Shit don‚Äôt matter to me because I can never get it to spawn. Few times I went there after learning about it like a month ago. ( even tho I‚Äôve played game since beta) but I went there and one time there where three raider punks but no rare vendor bot. I have got the girl to spawn down at lost home a bunch and near 76 and couple times near Berkeley but never does she have good stuff. It‚Äôs mostly chems, bow plans, or just random junk. Before I started my search on rare outfits couple weeks ago I think when I first saw her near Berkeley she had a bunch of outfits but I didn‚Äôt think they where rare until I started on this reddit. But yeah they say you will mess up the spawn but I could care less like I said being I never get it to spawn. Lol
---
Yeah the odds arent bad, unless you're real unlucky. Glad I could be of help!
---
GW2 had some sweet, sweet farms...
---
What were  you expecting exactly?  Fireworks and a blowjob?
---
Oh also I posted a pic on market yesterday went to lost home and the rare trader was a 3 star legendary but still only had chem recipes I can‚Äôt win lol
---
I mean they won't be able to do any damage so why shouldn't they just chill there to get the event reward?
---
Definitely. Thanks!
---
trick question. there is no best looking power armour.
---
I had a camp there, used it to farm that specific vendor spawn every time I went back, you just have to have it a little away from the shack
---
Nice? 
---
Detroit?
---
I found my 5 towards the East end of the tunnel. I can't find the first page myself :(
---
It shouldn't kick you out of the fight.
---
Thanks! Completely missed that one
---
I've only seen it at Ward, and seen it several times, so presumed it was something unique to the airport haha
---
OK exploit, great.  So ... I shouldn't take it over next time for fear of the banhammer?
---
In my experience it‚Äôs because us software developers are being pressured by management to hit arbitrary deadlines so we mark everything as non-blockers T_T
---
Great, thank you.
---
It's called farming. Doing the main objective is less rewarding than the stuff you get during the event, so keep the event going as long as possible.
---
I'm on PC and my user is DocB30tn.  
---
I've only found him once and I was surprised b/c I didn't know what it was for.
---
There‚Äôs no emote listed under the bundle
---
I almost can't believe what I'm reading!
---
ACTUALLY REASONABLE DROP RATES??
---
Also, does this event not drop Repair Kits?
---
 Dishonoured 3 now with Irradiated Blood Bugs
---
Pretending the event from inception to deployment was a smooth process is a straight lie and multiple issues highlighted by the PTS community (myself included) were not addressed or even acknowledged in a timely manner so rather than go back to the drawing board they kept announcing it and then doubling back on themselves and making themselves look bad while the pts community goes "well what about this and this and this and this" and they went ahead anyway. I think this is where OP is coming from and I share the frustration. Additionally your argument is irrelevant because we have had no "bug fix" patches that defer content to fix major long standing bugs. All that happened was an over-promise and under-deliver as per usual and it just so happens to be with something highly anticipated so that is why you see the anger for the delays. The reason its extra frustrating is because Bethesda is trying to keep their pre-planned new content on schedule without spending the appropriate resources to fix the new (and old) bugs that keep popping up faster than that schedule so we are left with a repository of ancient bugs (features) that slowly increases over time that they will never fully catch up on as per literally every other Fallout game they have made. This just bites harder because its multiplayer and consoles are having serious performance and crashing issues just with fallout76.
---
There is a chest near the entrance when you run out of the mine in a room to the right i believe its red.
---
I have seen this glitch many times but i never got the glitch to work for me. I did find the building where the original one is in but i couldnt figure out how to blueprint it. I know this is ironic but mind helping me?
---
That's why I'm waiting to get the "free" armor from Season 2.
---
I do like the whole X-01 style, due to it's unique look, but the T-51 is still what I consider a classic.
---
If however we're talking paintjobs, without a doubt I love the Red Rocket one, with it's subtle wings and aerodynamic look, what would really make me happy would be different color schemes based on it, but hey, the name does say 'RED' so I think a gold or silver version of it might be wishful thinking
---
Good idea.  I think berry mentats would work too.
---
Saved me atoms while at work so thanks to you,  really sucks though.
---
That vendor can spawn in 5 or 6 places, so singling out your sister for camping at one of them sucks... Hopefully your sister can roll with the punches and not take it personally. Have fun out there!
---
Have you seen China lately?
---
Never, because it can't exist.
---
Cursed Weapons have 3 fixed effects, as stated above.
---
Unless it's god tier it probably won't sell in my experience. So I just list weapons or armor for sale before I can scrip them.
---
OK I figured it out and do I have a little egg on my face.  Thanks everyone.   Turns out my 20% of health was a little over that mark.  When I let it run down to about 10% viola.... listed DMG went up to 295 and a shot using the periscope was dealing out 461 DMG.  Also noticing now the DMG a around 35% is still showing 225 so the advice on unequipping it also made a difference.
---
Not BoS‚Äôs fault. Guy is asking for materials for a group who has no idea who he is, what he‚Äôs doing, or whether he‚Äôs even doing what they‚Äôd want. I expect them to show up in Appalachia and be like ‚Äúso atlas is a place that we need to destroy.‚Äù
---
Alright, alright. You guys have a point here. You're right. It's free shit. After a frustrating day of gathering supplies, I was just fed up at that point. But I've moved onwards to doing other events/quests, and it's safe to say I was being petty. I think it was just icing on the cake. BUT, knowing me, I'm still going to play. Mad or not üòÇ
---
Another issue with the bunker is it seems to require an electrical connection, but non is available unless you destroy the building (flame trap it) and suddenly the power conduit appears in the rubble on left side of door. In the mean time I just have a floor conduit to power the structure area.
---
I fucking wish I could. I couldn't even spawn back into the cave
---
I'm a fan of my X-01 Nuka Cola Quantum
---
Based on your toon it looks like you were ghoulified. Did you go into 3rd person to see if you were in fact still human?
---
My fave was seeing someone selling the "Pipe..." note for 30000 lol
---
Emote. Not icon. My bad :o
---
They aren‚Äôt built in.
---
Everyday I get up to around 300 scrip sometimes only 200 after scripping and doing dailies. I keep thinking about saving it but I don‚Äôt being I had that amazing thing happen 4 weeks ago. I only had 260 and only 40 left before daily limit. I went to purveyor before signing off. I rolled once, got bloodied lever action, rolled again, got my first bloodied fixer (250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage). I said oh shit, walked over to scrip machine and scripped last gun. Walked back over, rolled a bloodied Tesla. All amazing and since then I try to get lucky like that again........ and nope. But I‚Äôm glad I know when it might be so I know I can keep trying my luck again. And beginning of September I‚Äôll just save all scrip.
---
Bethesda gives as much a shit as you do to provide details, it seems.
---
Nada.
---
Yes but don't expect those red eye lights on your Excavator.
---
Yeah, contains the cursed weapons
---
I was always partial to the prototype (paint) Ultracite myself, but Patriot Prime happened...
---
But now its my T-65 with Dark Matter skin and Vaultboy Helm, feels like fun to me
---
Fuck yes.
---
Please can anyone and everyone upvote this guys post to the top of the community. I'm over Foundation and Crater when nearly all my notes come from SBQ fights and such. Not to mention I then head to a station to scrip *anyway*.
---
The Thompson is in 76 I believe, it‚Äôs the .45 submachine gun. The Thomson also appeared in  New Vegas in the Honest Hearts dlc if I remember correctly.
---
Hey, if you have any extra bloodied fixers, wanna send one over on PS4? It would be much appreciated :-)
---
Nooo!!! üòÇüòÇ That's the worst
---
Honestly the free states stuff is so small and unnoticeable I hear about it more than I see it. I actually don't know anything at all about the free states people of Appalachia. Be cool if they did something with that.
---
Definitely want some Enclave stuff after the BoS.
---
It's to let you sort yourself out and not be getting spanked as you load in...
---
They have health bars but unfortunately can be repaired. No nuke it wont work
---
I hate Bethesda, but I can‚Äôt resist the lure of the Fallout series. I wish literally *anyone* else could have handled 76. Except EA and Rockstar. They‚Äôre even greedier than Bethesda.
---
W/e I got onto the PTS I was solo. I saw 3 other people the first day though. 
---
To be clear, as far as "performance" goes, 1 player or 12 shouldn't make a difference.
---
Actually glad to hear this. I've been practising with my 2H weapons incase it was never fixed and I hated it. I'm an unarmed gal for life it would seem.
---
I have noticed that also tons of people requesting Nuke cards all of a sudden. Ya it could be the new event but feels like something else.
---
Bunker and fences are fucked.
---
Maybe your button is double clicking.  With the controller it's the "A" button to view and to purchase.  Just a guess.
---
I know, I was saying I would like more weapons along the lines. 
---
And yeah the Thompson in NV was stellar when you acquired enough .45 and the drum mag.
---
Yes to this, let main way to get perk coins through level with optional path of scrapping unneeded cards.
---
Yeah i find it dumb. Why is Bethesda focusing on the Communist shit for? Nobody asked for it, uh well i mean not many people but still. 
---
When i saw Season 2 was going to be G.I. Joe themed i thought pure military themed. I'm personally getting tired of the ChiComm stuff we're getting.
---
Me personally: I want an actual Bunker camp item - not this fake/broke commie shit (Although you gotta hand it to Bethesda: It's one broke item that makes complete sense, hah)
---
They weren't really changed. They added some more useless ones, and made the grind even worse.
---
I loved prey so it was worth playing,if you like the idea of a rogue like shock game its great but having to replay it many times to get the full story was a little annoying as were some aspects of the time mechanics. Its a ok 7/10
---
If you get a reply at all it will just be condolences for the lost S.C.O.R.E. and probably a subtle plug for the upcoming double point weekend to help soften the loss. Unfortunately for whatever reason they can't do anything about and aren't offering anything to make up for autocompleted challenges at this point.
---
The quick reload glitch does effect anyone who spent the time to get the +15% faster reload effect on there gun as it is now effectively useless. I agree it's less detrimental than server crashing but it is still a big big issue for those who engage in pvp or have built there character around reloading fast with perks on weapons and perk cards for it to be completely pointless because of a fireworks bug that ANYONE can Do. Yes I agree fix these bugs that have been in game since beta like the trade glitch but that doesn't mean we should let these other bugs slide/give them an easier time for them just because they are 'usefull' for some people...
---
So? 
---
It‚Äôs their vendor let them sell items for what ever they want.
---
Seriously.. I brought that pack as well, problem is some of the items in this game have been bugged for months and they still haven‚Äôt fixed them. What are they doing are they still useable at all?
---
It‚Äôs not that, I‚Äôm 100% sure I didn‚Äôt double click the item.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since Beta and I‚Äôve never had this happen before today.
---
Agreed. I have a 3\* Unyielding for 500 that no one wants to buy. I'm thinking it can't be because the price is too high. I guess the wrong people are visiting my camp. It's probably because I'm in the noobie area in the hopes of helping noobs get some cheap stuff if they need it. I got good shit! Just buy it already!
---
You can't get back in.
---
Lol sorry on Xbox. But since getting that one I can‚Äôt get one. I think I got all my luck from purveyor. After learning fixer plan after buying for 5k then it dropping next event. Smh but after learning it I got a fixer first night. It was a mutants, but fixer non the less. Then a week later get zealots fixer. Which had better prefixes. But then my fav gun the bloodied one finally came. I love it. Before that I had a 2 star bloodied combat 33 vats chance drop from enemy. That thing was what made me switch all perks around and start using guns full time. Use to use my bloodied grognak axe or bloodied death claw. Which I almost scripped because I never knew about bloodied weapons. As even tho I‚Äôve played since beta I only wanted to carry as much as I can so never messed with weapons or perks much. Lol but if you where on Xbox I would throw one of the other fixers I have to ya üòÅ
---
Useless? Increasing stats and allowing you to add more perks In a tree? 
---
Ignore rads completely with what rads? ( which was in the base release )
---
Idk what you want from the game. But it‚Äôs odv something like how a yu go oh battle would play out.
---
Most if not all players pay for this game once and yet we keep asking for more.
---
Qa testing? Like they have the man power for that
---
Yes it truly is. I said oh man oh man I‚Äôll finally get something good and nope same stuff. And worst part couldn‚Äôt even farm her for a legendary weapon lol
---
Farmout 76
---
The ultimate tease
---
Why and how would the Chinese invade? They seem pretty decimated aside from small hideouts and that one base near Whitesprings. And where would they be coming from? How would there be enough to invade? It‚Äôs not like they have a navy anymore.
---
Yeah, this game really needs real bunkers, but considering we can't even properly set a half ass one in our camp, we can only dream about it... Bunkers would only be possible if we were able to modify the terrain inside the camp area as we want, I don't see that happening sadly.
---
Enclave plasma rifle?
---
There is a difference between it and the regular plasma rifle plasma plans.
---
Only pc
---
We don't find: Senior Knight Ted Wilson - Scribe Grant McNamara - Knight 'Tex' Rogers - Abby - or the leader of the Free States.
---
Many opportunities!
---
Why need a gate when you can just roll under the damn thing. I guess it's not advertised as a security fence I hope.
---
&gt;Demand a refund
---
FTFY. Don't let them get away with selling you this bullshit.
---
lol :-)
---
I‚Äôve had amazing luck with legendary crafting - my first plasma caster was bloodied! But no luck with the purveyor. My character is a bloodied heavy, but I‚Äôm gonna get back into the legendary roll, and see if I can‚Äôt get some sort of bloodied auto rifle. I want to get a bloodied stealth build. All the same damage + stealth damage + looks sleek. I want that BOS spec ops gear, and I‚Äôll be like a special forces soldier.
---
20 years of dealing with end users has taught me not to suggest such things.  Surely it is the horrible programming.
---
That said, it is crazy that there is no "confirm purchase" dialog.  Has never made me buy something I didn't want.... but it still should exist.
---
No one said anything as a justification, but the big wigs of the world like to drip feed reality-to-come in a fantasy manner.
---
Whatever, dude, yall obviously dont get it. Go back to circle-jerkin this dumpster fire of a game, im sure its a concept you can much more easily grasp.
---
I‚Äôve tried it with an N4015 pipe pistol. It just augmented the faster reload perk. And I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôd rather have a bug that doesn‚Äôt hurt the player rather than one that does. In this case, it‚Äôs especially useful for low levels, and sure, I don‚Äôt mind if it gets fixed but it needs to be low priority. This game drives me crazy with its legion of bugs, and this is a break in the life of being shit on by Bethesda. If they fix this one before fixing anything else, it‚Äôll show how much they really care about us.
---
True, to be fair they are fairly generous with the refunds. I bought the mothman signs and expected them to be bigger, I got to keep them and got my atoms back
---
I would much rather that shit get added into the game outside the store or run to be honest
---
If you die before he does you can, you have to die about 20 seconds before he does or just as/after he does to get stuck.
---
Also we don't know which one of the skeletons in  the pile is the "president" of the usa. And he deserves to stay there, swooped by mr handys
---
t51 and x01
---
I did 5 CP events today and usually there is little competition to join the event, there is just one stack of ppl 100+ lvl.
---
Communist can look pretty badass
---
This instance of disconnecting from the server should be resolved by now, if you get booted üë¢ from the server juring any instance you should be allowed to rejoin the same server.
---
 I got booted last night üåô juring the SBQ fight to login back into the game, with my camp being taken by someone else, I am starting to wonder if some of the disconnect issues are because of multiple people trying to login and there camp placement is in the same area. 
---
Nonetheles it should be a good idea üí° moving forward to make it so that you don't end up losing out on your game play regardless of being part of a group or not. 
---
Mind you that would be such a challenge for bethesda's to accomplish that I think I would be dead üíÄ before that ever happened.
---
Have you seen the new 'cursed' weapons yoy can get from colossal problem?
---
They do more damage but break faster.
---
I think they should have made the cursed effect drop as a box mod that could be applied to any weapon, to give it a 4th star.
---
But they kind off missed out on that one. Another would be simply the same effect but in reverse, does less damage but breaks slower.
---
what the hell are you talking about
---
Have you ever played a sniper in ANY other game?
---
Hell, NW almost has it right and even though NW needs a couple more balance passes desperately, it‚Äôs still the most balanced the weapons in this game have ever been.
---
&gt; O wait you can‚Äôt your brain chemistry has been warped around always following the meta
---
 With all due respect, it seems like it‚Äôs your(and half of this sub tbf)brain chemistry has been warped by anti-meta lol. 
---
 Aimbot...I mean V.AT.S. and aoe spray and prayers pointing a finger at other players while screeching about gg ez mode is peak unintentional comedy even for this sub.
---
Again, this isn‚Äôt only aimed at you(see what I did thur) as l have seen some overly dramatic posts from both ‚Äúsides‚Äù of the pts nerf, but the anti-meta meta of this sub has obviously taken on some kind of deeper meaning for some and the projection and delusions of edge have reached embarrassing levels.
---
Think that‚Äôs why they proposed the gauss weapons. They‚Äôre trying to move endgame gear away from being tradeable, so doubt we‚Äôll see the purveyor stuff changed as that‚Äôll just throw more high tier trades led into the market
---
The fact that pitchforks were taken out in the first place is fucked up.  It's first iteration of fucking PTS build for a patch that shouldn't even be out for weeks, even if there wasn't a bug there was no guarantee the changes would have gone onto the live build as is.
---
The only good loot on him, for me so far, has been caps. The one star legendary has been wood everytime...
---
I sell my weapons for 4-30k caps , I‚Äôm not putting up garbage though.  And yes they sell .
---
I'm $orry, I don't think you quite under$tand Bethe$da'$ priority here
---
It‚Äôs so obvious that is console folk are going to get a delayed bugged to crap event.
---
I could advance to combat rifles, but all of the ones i find (they commonly spawn in monongah police department) are level 45 or 50 up. so i sell them. All of the weapons I find, are shit, pipe, or unusable due to level. I sometimes use laser pistols. None of my weapons are heavily modded, or legendaries (i think i have a Mutant Slayers pump shotgun though). Literally all the weapons I find are shitty. its one of the reasons I barely play. Also, all of the ammo i get is quickly pissed away, because when I do join the game, a supermutant... warlord or something (and usually a skirmisher) is taking a giant crap on my base.
---
oh yes, i forgot about the cursed effect. i‚Äôve heard that it makes the pickaxe stupidly powerful
---
I don't mean that you double clicked, just that maybe an older controller button is doing it.  Again, I'm just guessing what would cause it.
---
Now that I'm done with the Legendary Run I haven't gone into NW in about a week, not planning on going back in until the next LR forces me to for score. I just absolutely hate it.
---
I think there was talk off adding a food canning station into the game at some point, nothing really confirmed though.
---
Yes, yes I have and not all games follow the one hit rule. Ever heard of destiny and their damage sponges? There is also some other mmo games that did not follow this rule.
---
The thing I got mad about this post is that op deemed that rifleman is completely useless. Which is not useless even in the pts when they can kill stuff almost as effectively as anything else.
---
It's coming back in Patch 22... Next month.
---
Awesome job everyone . I can‚Äôt stand the BOS so I gave them mines around their donate box .
---
Now these are drop rates that will actually make me happy to do the event. I was expecting some 0.05%-1% drop rate nonsense. Boy would I have loved these percentages for Fasnacht and the Treasure Hunter.
---
Spawn at the rusty pick amd spin left if he is there you will see the yellow balloons
---
Is there a source? What is this guy ranting about?
---
Here‚Äôs hoping membership can transfer with the next gen since games will not n Xbox/Microsoft store
---
That one is a real bitch even with a junk gun hell I was one shoting with a one star rubber band and paper clip gun it was ffr tho üôÇ
---
Yep, still doesn't make sense to me.
---
Who cares about the market?
---
The market only exists because the legendary system is so bad for getting what you really want.
---
If the system worked better we wouldn't need to trade outside of the game.
---
Honestly they should just be up ahead of time in the PTS. Then we can break it legitimately.
---
I really like my Strangler Heart with the a Raider Scabber Head and Left Leg and the rest Raider Waster. Looks like a crazy swap monster.
---
I‚Äôd love this and glass bottle shooting range variations! Maybe a table with cards, bottles and caps like the one in NW vault 51 game room.
---
The gate comes in next weeks bundle  but you have to buy the bundle .
---
Nah, I just have a vague memory really. OP will have to explain himself!
---
You mean the one that looks like Jason from Friday the 13th? White one? It‚Äôs an award from the legendary run...Better grab your ASICS
---
shocker something in this game doesnt work
---
Yeah my buddy accidentally bought some stupid thing and they refunded him and let him keep it. I was pretty surprised.
---
There's actually something of a workaround for that daily: if you walk up and see no shovel, put the body in the ground and try to bury it, then turn around and check behind the tree a couple of paces away. The game spawns an extra one in.
---
X-01.
---
What time zone you in, I'm up to help you tomorrow as GMT here and late. It's really not too bad, I solo'd it the first time at lvl 50 odd.
---
Lol yeah I had that happen too
---
Probably because it is partially the customer service people‚Äôs choices, and they are nice which is why I don‚Äôt angrily send them emails if something happens wrong in the game
---
Is that true? I always try to keep them maintained, but that just seems mind boggling
---
Bethesda does. And that was my point. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want players relying heavily on traders outside the game so they‚Äôre compromising by not changing the RNG but making sure players get it for the weapon type they want, which was what you were asking for.
---
&gt;Mining Mask has a 5% droprate
---
Well that's not too terrible at least.
---
I'd rather have a game that doesn't have bugs, hence why it's important to point out all of them, big or small, I get what ur saying though, and I agree this bug shouldn't have priority over some other bugs like the out of bounds glitch that makes u invincible or the SS under armour people actually paid money for, but that doesn't mean I don't want this bug to be fixed, I was just trying to make the Bethesda community personnel aware of other issues I had experienced if they weren't already aware of them. It's completely 100% up to THEM in what order things get fixed/have priority so we as a community will see what is more pressing for them to fix first when patches roll around. Keep in mind though, some bug fixes even though they may be more urgent, could take a lot more hours of coding than say smaller bugs like this reload glitch and that be why we see those fixes sooner. Really I think it all comes down to communication between the players and Bethesda, if they gave us time frames of a rough estimate of how long some bugs might take to fix with reasoning as to why such as having to completely re write that part of code, us the community will have a better understanding of there "priorities"
---
You and a buddy do it at the same time, then kill each other to collect the bounty.  Be glorious.
---
You completely missed the point of everything that was said. 
---
I never said it was any sort of smooth process, in fact just the opposite, they're obviously having major issues getting it right but delaying the quest because the quest still has bugs is not only the right thing to do but what the vast majority of the community has said they prefer.
---
Not fixing other bugs has no relevance to bugs in this quest or the delays on this quest so that's an absolute distraction from the topic but on top of that it's actually wrong, this patch actually did heavily address other bugs and included a number of bug fixes and reversions. 
---
And you can create whatever imaginary scenarios you want but it won't change anything real. Sure in magical wonderland Bethesda does nothing but devote hundreds of devs around the clock to bug fix things that have been around since Fallout 4...
---
 But that's not happening. So let's get back to actually possible outcomes.
---
No some of the raiders at crater have an all black balaclava on, and its unobtainable
---
Maybe put it in a window?
---
Oh wow, I‚Äôve never roamed around crater long enough to notice I don‚Äôt guess. I‚Äôm gonna have to check them out
---
Ah right the nuka jumpsuits. If you wanna look like a multicolored fashion disaster except the NukaDark one
---
If you want that just play new vegas.
---
Nevermind, new vegas is better than rdr2
---
Wait. It makes you *invincible*?
---
How much you paying . Fuck it I will do it for free . What‚Äôs the address ?
---
I think it's less to do with the cosmetics, tho they were nice, and more that people are finishing the run, or tried of the same two maps, or generally bored/starved for content.
---
I do agree that the wait times have gone up.
---
Making it 100% useless as a perimeter then, unless you like moving a panel. So glad I didn‚Äôt use my score atoms on it.
---
Yea they patched it out in update 21 cant get ghillie suit anymore
---
I'd play it more if it didn't take such a long time to start.
---
They should just make solo modes, maybe a smaller section of the maps like they once had.
---
Even a faster ring timer just to push the action and Round.
---
Displays beautifully doesn't it...
---
Once a few players get the ball rolling on Flatwoods, almost everyone votes it is what I‚Äôve noticed.
---
Yeah a lot of people dont get that its not the devs so much as the soulless corporate vampires.
---
well he wasn't dead when it happened with my friends complaining i wasn't coming back to help
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs what the the scout mask is supposed to look like... if Bethesda would ever fix it
---
U take no damage from enemies or fall damage yes. Very very broken. Only way u can die is from radiation or u killing ur self with explosive bullets
---
I can‚Äôt say with 100% certainty that wasn‚Äôt the case but I‚Äôve never had it happen before and my controller is less then a year old.
---
I‚Äôm just kind of fed up with the toxic BS on this sub. 
---
Your fine because you actually tried to comment on what might have happened but the amount of childish/selfish BS on here is probably going to make me unsubscribe.
---
A couple days ago I found a lvl 10 3* quad ammo  explosive hunting rifle so I made a post seeing if any lower levels would like it for free.
---
Within five minutes it was at -4 karma.
---
I seriously don‚Äôt understand people on here.
---
I think they only did it with those weapons as a way to ensure players completed the grind.
---
If people were able to trade those weapons then there would be no reason for them to log in and grind max rep. So I think beths focus was more on forcing rep grind than directly limiting trade for the sake of throttling the outside market.
---
People could see the rewards on the test server and posted on how they look. But it's a late reward. Scroll down to see it. [Here you go](https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa)
---
Because they are the legit players. They dont want to help, no, that is waste of bullets. Rather afk wait till the event is done. But if you come up with strong or magic weapon, report storm from these desperate people is expected.
---
It‚Äôs clear . The settlers are not worth anyone‚Äôs time .
---
Soft god mode, needs patching ASAP. I definitely agree on this count.
---
That sucks the fun out of a game.
---
A fix wont come until patch 22, which should be around September 10th
---
Also, hasnt the camo SS under armor only been around since patch 21? Or just briefly before? I dont think it was here for 2 patches
---
The Todd Godd demands tribute from us lesser mortals.
---
ikr Im too lazy to find it though haha
---
Fucking hell sake man.
---
Very broken for pvping, but we will see
---
Yes you can tame on console - the animal must spawn at a random spawn location and spawn alone - for instance if it‚Äôs a mega sloth fighting Yao guais- even if you kill the Yao guais- you will still not be able to tame the sloth.
---
Somethings wrong with your OneX then
---
Sneak. If you're melee and have the recipe, use tick blood tequila, it will add a vampire effect to your attacks
---
I‚Äôd love to be able to dance around on a fissure site using this glitch though, that would be awesome üòÇ
---
Yea.... Even as a console player I want a dang text chat like plug a keyboard and ur set.
