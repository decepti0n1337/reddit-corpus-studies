A: there is already building variety from wood to brick to metal to nothing at all and I have personally seen concrete fortresses. 
---

---
B: Not all camps are the same, the vast majority are but that's due to location and not having an environment to be able to build nice lavish camps without chewing up budget, I personally run a riverside camp/bar on the water and bank, I've seen church style buildings and town styled ones. If you go to the right caves you can build vault styled camps.
---
C: the biggest problem with your suggestion is that it would go hand in hand with increasing budget and I agree with increasing budget size but to the scope of fo4? If everyone can rock a castle/mansion/casino that is plenty of server stress not to mention the fact that a lot of players will be competing for the same ideal space for their hovel.

ESO is a different game with a different engine by a different company.
---
After the first few years they started adding a birth control supplement to the wster supply so that everyone would be adults and ready and able to go to settle the wasteland.
---
Steep, but affordable. It gives us a bigger incentive to be frank.

&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd honestly pay 10k caps for a 200lbs increase right about now.
---
I build *a lot and move constantly* and I require a large amount of stash space to haul materials to somewhere I want to be. Plus it'll do the explorers some good considering the new events from the roadmap which may bring in new collectible items or junk or weapons or outfits and etc.
---
You'll need to find *some space* to horde those new items.
---
Those are definitely the big ones for newbies but wth does ‚Äúproc‚Äù mean?
---
I want a giddyup buttercup patterned one like the jangles one.
---
It may be soloable but it is geared towards groups. Also, the majority of the add-on DLC is group focused.
---
Different game yet a *smart implementation*

Slot machines, or the thrill of bargain hunting? I guess if you‚Äôve never been a bargain hunter (and in this day of internet shopping it‚Äôs a rarer thing than it used to be) it wouldn‚Äôt appeal. Me, I find the thrill of the hunt fun.
---
My kids are the same way... remember the smallest detail of video games they saw me play 2 months ago but can't remember shit for school 2 hours ago lol.
---
Crickets......Survival mode is dead.
---
You're getting a lot of downvotes but I think this is a good idea and people are missing the point of it. It's not aimed at people who farm legendaries. It's geared more to the casual player as a sort of handicap to help them get a good drop. I've talked to people over level 100 that don't have a single piece of legendary equipment because they were either unlucky when they explored the places they spawn or they haven't been to those places at all. The game should throw that player a bone every now and then.
---
I was in the middle of taking down a scorchbeast north of Gads when I-bot comes out of nowhere, delivers his insult just as I'm unloading on the SB with my heavy 50 cal, and then gets wiped out by the beast and it's hoards. After I finally defeat them all I see the wrecked carcass of Insult Bot laying in the road, mixed in with the carnage.
---
Wonder if he felt insulted in any way?
---
So my main question is how to kill players with these set ups. So am I to take your information that in adventure mode it's virtually impossible to kill another player with said loadout?
---
I've played around 1300 hours, and gotten more than 50 of what is considered God Tier Weapons, but it's not about Luck, it's about Sheer numbers, those are the 1% exception, 10% are decent, and the rest are Junk.
---
Yeah!
---
Haven't gotten any BSOD, fair share of CTD and full on lockups over the months but its been maybe 1-2 a week now. 
---
I've suspected either Logitech's or Corsair's software (for my mouse and keyboard respectively) but its not founded on anything. Turning them off seems to have no effect. I do think if I use the instant-replay feature of OBS for too long it seems to guarantee a lockup. 
---
As you say I don't have any of these issues with other recent titles, hours and hours of those without a hitch.
---
Why?
---
:)
---
I would venture to guess that since it was established that we'd be out of the vault by 2097 (time was extended for our stay for an unknown reason) so for me it would make sense to pull out as it were to ensure that young children weren't being thrown back out there willy-nilly with no training for it.
---
Are you suggesting we use atoms for the form of payment?   
---
Again, 150 atoms for 5 pound wouldn't be too bad considering some challenges are easy to complete with patience you could increase it but then there is the pay to win route....
---
*Maybe* implement something along the lines of the "Fuzzy" Tokens. and it should be a consumable mod or something to add to the stash boxes.
---
yeah no I noticed this today &amp; yesterday, today being especially bad as I was missing a 95% hit on a legendary enemy, that was literally the equivalent of shooting at a brick wall and missing
---
You just reach thru the crack in the wall and grab it
---
What you‚Äôre saying is correct, but I believe that FO76 should be able to used by players as a building game too. With the budget, sure you can build stuff like houses and whatnot, but a small town where players could meet and take up vacancy perhaps would be really cool imo. The main thing is that I always run out of budget, or items to place. I just want more variety. Nuclear powered camps or anti-scorchbeast turrets. Stuff that would make the camps more enjoyable and aesthetic. In FO4, you could make a settlement that was a reasonable size and also, it tended to have more stuff- farms, water pollution centers, small things that add a whole lot to a camp but can‚Äôt be fit into the budget of a small outpost.
---
*I just want more budget, basically, for small things that make a camp more than just a survivor‚Äôs home.*
---
Like the Village People?
---
1 star lvl 15 legendary! Yess boi here we go take all my 254 holotapes bethesda
---
Honestly this is one of the best "they should do this" ideas I've seen posted here in a while. Mostly because it's easy for them to implement so it could actually happen.
---
Id also love to have an interior brick wall, that has the white on both sides. My bathroom is currently made of wood üòÇ
---
Anytime
---
There were a lot more building options in FO4, even just in the vanilla game. There aren't concrete walls or the vault set. It would also be nice to have a couple different types of roofs.
---
And we get a little bit of pvp back in adventure mode
---
Gotcha... I just ignore them and have. I‚Äôm glad they changed it but I am curious how you can‚Äôt do damage back...
---
I can't speak to Project Paradise (haven't bothered yet) but I get the FPS drops and hitches frequently, and it got much, much worse with the hot fix Monday. 
---
I'm thinking its not so much a hardware issue as it doesn't play nicely with other applications or the particular Windows environments, I dunno just guessing, but it can happen to one and not the other on almost identical hardware. Could very well be lag, that one is hard to control. 
---
I'm running the same processor, double the ram, 2x 1070 and SSD install, I still get these issues and my internet is dedicated to my gaming.
---
I can agree with something along the lines of a 25% budget size increase and a 25% space increase MAX. Adding things like ground to air missile turrets and more defensive aesthetic building options don't hurt either but I could never personally get on board with someone being able to build an entire castle or anything that size.
---
Hit and runs are common and they also block you to prevent you from following them back...
---
There are some strategies. Most obviously, stay alive long enough to be that 25% chance of damage. If you only get one shot in before you're dead, your chances drop to 0. After that, you have to negate the legendary effects. Crippling a limb can negate cavaliers and explosions and staggers negate sentinal. If they are running dense armor and fireproof, explosive weapons will not hurt them but can push them enough to make sentinal drop off for a quick second. I've heard that pulse mines and grenades can devastate power armor. Now you can see why stealth is so valued in survival mode. If you don't get the drop on someone, you're going to have a rough time. The difference here is that this player is specifically set up to troll in adventure. In survival, the majority of players don't have these god-tier legendary armor pieces, so your chances might actually be better there against a random.
---
I have no clue what you are referring to aha are you talking about the band?
---
Am set to go with my partner, from Columbus OH.
---
I'm sure the locals will appreciate the business but still be a little peeved by all the weirdos.
---
Best that they are Max level or at least between 40 and 50. For lower levels I would not go for them...
---
I feel like I've seen your name while playing. Are you on PS4?
---
I'll agree to adding more variety but to act like there was little to no variety in what you can do in your camp is a little absurd
---
Yeah I feel like I‚Äôd get lost and die to some ornate trap, lose some flux, and artillery barrage the hell out of it.
---
If the stairs are built out of carbon nanotubes and anchored deep into the ground I don't see how it couldn't work
---
It‚Äôs not common. But more important I don‚Äôt need it every day. I can generally get most of my caps from just playing and finding junk and aid items. 
---
Also note that I put into my semi daily routines the routes to get these three scrap items. So I‚Äôm not hunting them when I need the caps.
---
You can do it right now. But it counts as two walls.
---
On your two floors put two walls with door frames back to back. Change them to normal walls and you are good.
---
It's just the servers having sync issues. I comes and goes. No way to fix it.
---
Honestly artillery cannons need a massive range and cool down buff, would be actually useful if you could have the range of 1/4 or 1/5 of the map in any direction from the cannon

This. I‚Äôve experienced it personally. Herd Mentality doesn‚Äôt show up in the display area. Confirm by joining a team.

I took a look at my own lists that I started (one back in January and another a few weeks ago), and your experience with legendary effects seems to be mirrored in both. Currently I'm at a bit of a small sample size to make any conclusions, but I'm seeing a pattern of primarily ghoul slayer's/assassin's on my left limbs and mutant slayer's/nocturnal on the right. Also in both lists, I had more right than left spawn
---
Great thought, this would be more of a QoL however, Bethesda never published additional textures for the Robot armor, but the modding community did. ;)

The robot armor has its own texture set separate from the actual robots.

Is there a source for this or is it fan theory?

Agree
---
The END not adding HP's is due to the issue people have with max Bloodied/Unyielding builds and bonus HP's.    
---
Less of a bug and more of a known issue.
---
Remember several patches ago when they changed how the bonus HPs apply, because food expiring was causing people to die?   
---
Same thing would happen with Armor/UnderArmor END bonuses.   
---
When that issue is resolved we will likely see that issue addressed.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a pita.  Happens all the time on my heavy weapons build.  
---
I have to run up and wack em with all rise instead as it doesn‚Äôt seem to effect my melee any.

I never suggested atoms as payment, just glad it's not.

This is an excellent idea. Maybe not always legendaries and more other stuff

I think I do remember getting herd mentality. I'll check this out. I dont care about losing the other mutations at all.

I was having issues with a crossbow over the last week but assumed it was just the crossbow being broken. I was missing 95% shots with a Gauss yesterday though, and weird shots with a lever today.

I just got done running around vendor to vendor and buying stuff. It‚Äôs fun.

In some instances in 1st person the color is incorrect at times.

Do magical armor and weapons follow the laws of physics?
---
Yes
---
I did exactly this too. It astounds people when they see it. Hah.

I've only had it cross my path once. I thought the initial approach was as funny as the insult itself, as it spawned about 100 meters away from me at my six o'clock...

I turn around and realize this bot is lumbering towards me with the speed of a crippled snail. It takes 10 or 15 more seconds before my crosshairs will even identify it as Insult Bot.

Finally it gets in front of me and says "Target Acquired" and then begins to deliver its insult. The waiting for the bot to get to me was the best part.

Yea! that's what i'm talking about.

Nocturnal armor and weapons.
---
Yes every copy of the game come with product code that allows you to activate fallout 76 for your account

Never seen a proper list so far but we could start with:

**discover location**

Mire (4/5 - Valley Galleria missing)
---
Cranberry Bog (2/5 - Allegeny, Cranberry Glade and RobCo are missing)
---
Toxic Valley (3/5 - Clarksburg and Grafton Damm missing)

Atm there is a translation bug with the **Scout Opossum badge challenges** for all non english player where you've been unable to see the objectives.

Diseases was often heard to be bugged cause of no change of catching whoopsis, but lately someone mentioned that it's possible and after that hint i also managed to get it done yesterday.
---
Nocturnal wood armor for the win.
---
To your point about comparison shopping,and established pricing. I've been shopping around,and I've found purple selling non legendary and/or one star lvl 35 legendary weapons for ridiculous prices (like thousands of caps). I usually only sell lvl 45/50 multi starred gear, i cannot move my inventory for a fraction of that (all low level and one star gear goes into the scrapper). I mean, be realistic; I'm not paying 2500 caps for your lvl 35 nocturnal death tambo.
---
Lol! That's hilarious, I'll jump you, then run away and block you so you can't find me üòÖ
---
You are not alone my friend. Seems clear there‚Äôs an issue somewhere.
---
Sorry if some of these are already recorded, but the original post is removed so I can't see. Hopefully they help!
---
Western revolver: receiver damage is borked. With bloody mess and no pistol perks, I get 75 damage from hair trigger, fierce, standard, and steadfast; 93 from vicious, prime, hardened, and calibrated; 102 from refined and severe. It seems that a couple might have gotten mixed up, since hardened and prime are usually the top tier damage dealers
---
Pipe rifle: has a "Stabilized grip" mod that should be a pistol grip, given its name and favorites menu picture. However, it looks like a rifle stock, uses two handed animations, and benefits only from rifle perks. There is a separate stabilized stock that is also a rifle mod and is statistically almost identical. The same situation arises with the forceful stock/grip mods.
---
Splitter mods on laser rifles, gatling plasma, etc SEVERELY lower the amount of shots it takes to break. I haven't done too much testing but it seems like it deals the exact same durability damage per projectile despite each one dealing far less damage individually than a normal shot.
---
No shit. Well, ive been doing this wrong for awhile. Kind of excited to get it right though, that weapon has been amazing even with wasting 9 strength perk card slots.
---
Looks like shit lol
---
Berserker  should, in theory, be strongest because you can't have any other buffs and effects. I'm not saying OP... but a valid amount. 
---
Change my mind.
---
It does and I try to modify my camp outside the parameters that many think but sometimes I run into issues where I glitch my room to be stuck or floors not being removable.
---
Sure. Why not from treasure maps as well? Why not every non-legendary creature have a chance? Why not every PvP kill too? 30% chance seems fair, right?
---
I too love this game however you are asking a lot of people who have already been asked a lot. And also for us preorder beta players all we have to do to get the missed achieves is jump on a second character for time.
---
I agree Berserker deserves some love and respective perks i.e. chance to dodge damage (serendipity-style) per each armor piece you are not wearing, or perks that increase how much DR you can have for maximum power. Since its way riskier than bloodied, it actually deserves to be the single strongest damage output prefix for minmaxed builds.
---
But if you have a berserker rifle and full vanguard heavy combat armor your gun isn't becoming worse in its basic function than lets say medics rifle. 
---
On the other hand, two-shot is always unreliable and nocturnal during the day performs worse than if it was medics.
---
I usually end up dropping things at people's camps based on what they sell. One dude has like 60 plans, so I dropped 8 or so of my duplicates. Another dude has a weirdly large number of legendary hunting rifles, so I dropped a bunch of .308
---
Yea. It can be a chore to adapt your building to fit something new. Player vending made me remodel, it took me all day to figure out how to do it. Hah. Totally worth it tho. Doesnt look like anyone elses base.
---
Y'all are wrong for this.
---
So Furious/Explosive better then TSE???
---
Yeah but they're free. That sort of thing draws a crowd.
---
Umm... that kind of defeats the whole purpose of limited time exclusives.
---
Also, why would Bethesda give up 90% of the profit (with 10% tax) when they currently get 100%?
---
Berserker's also lowers your damage when you are wearing too much armor
---
But tbh, I think these are fine. Compare nocturnal to bloodied. Bloodied requires you to be nearly dead to gain its maximum damage bonus, which is higher than nocturnal's maximum bonus. This is a constant risk that needs to be active in order to benefit from its bonus. Nocturnal, on the other hand, just needs it to be night. You can use another weapon during the day and benefit from the full 50% damage bonus at night with no cost. As for two-shot, its redeeming factor is that it doubles the effectiveness of any projectile-specific effects like explosive or harpoons/bolts to pick up, and is fairly minimal on many weapons
---
mate, sounds like you are the real MVP, good job !
---
Just random theory I made up to explain it.
---
Perhaps you will like this sub. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/)
---
I agree about nocturnal. 
---
As for two-shot, a 25% damage bonus that applies to all enemies is a solid benefit; well in line with most other affixes. There are plenty of mid-to-short ranged skirmishes where the accuracy penalty isn't relevant; every shot is landing. If you really hate two-shot, sell them. They sell fine.   
---
If you want a second terrible affix, I'd look at Stalkers. It's a VATS affix that isn't good for VATS. Now that's a weak affix.
---
I just don't like it when players don't give it any thought. They just throw stuff on the ground and said it's a home. If you say so. *Tries to slide between stairs that's on top of the entrance and climbs up a section to find the vending machines*
---
I can confirm that an instigating/+10% aim hunting rifle with a piercing mag and .50 cal receiver will kill just about anything with one head shot, including lvl 91 glowing deathclaws and lvl 76 glowing yao-guai.
---
This is actually really cool
---
Beacuse its gone, so technically theyre not getting any profit from it. And on top of that, itd remove a lot of the free atoms floating around. So when something new and cool comes along, people would be more likely to buy atoms from them. And theyre not really exclusives, theyre just limited time availability. They did just rerelease the blackbird paint, among other items.
---
Nicr
---
Didn't know there was a sub Reddit for that lol thanks!
---
I've been running bloodied for months and there is basically no risk. Serendipity, evasive, barbarian, and add in some sentinel/cavalier armor and you probably won't even die if you get hit.....yet with bloodied and adrenal reaction stacked you can one shot everything.
---
My only problem is when you hit max caps. I was sitting at 10k no where near max and I didn‚Äôt have anything to put me even close. Or so I thought. All of a sudden 5 serums sold 10 serums sold another 5 serums sold. Uh oh I rush to a vendor to buy random stuff but by the time my load screen finished I was at max caps and they kept buying. I wish they would just remove the cap limit tbh I don‚Äôt see any valid reason for it.

I'm certain i saw "polished" unlock, because i celebrated it, only to not have it show on my crafting mods
---
You need fireproof and adamant skeleton, both max level. You need to maximise stagger perks for your weapon. You need a main gun, a backup, a gamma gun and a tesla gun (nonexplosive). No adamant skeleton = broken legs = superstagger = unavoidable death.
---
The two latter weapons, gamma gun and tesla are extremely effective in their purposes even with no related perks. Q25 Tesla is best roll, never use vats for it tho, always aim on the ground and let the lightning arcs find their targets. Penetrate buildings and covers with tesla.
---
Go down to 1str on your perception build. You can also ditch explosive damage and play without demo expert and explosive guns. My sneaky bloodied sniper only has 3 int and gunsmith there so weapons don't blow up instantly.
---
Yeah it would be a cool risk vs reward thing. In survival it would be like a giant dinner bell.
---
Any random power armor mod spawn, that's all there is about where to find it without a vender
---
Sadly it won't happen that easily. People expect things to be done in a strange way. Then they complain about not having the plans. I had someone come up to me after I built their home, only to find out the relocated because they wanted a better view. Then asked me to build again but for free.
---
If you can, try working for an upgrade to a hunting rifle.  The pipe bolt action is my favorite looking gun in the game, but it lacks a magazine mod to add addition armor piercing effect.  Highly desirable against high level enemies.  I have an instigating lever gun and an instigating hunting rifle, and the hunting rifle performs considerably better against high level armored foes like lvl 68 super mutants, lvl 91 deathclaws and the like.  One hit headshots are common, while the lever gun might leave them with 10% health or more.
---
I‚Äôm too lazy to do all this!
---
Sell good shit. 3 stars only.  No clothing.
---
Ah. Okay thank. I appreciate the fast response. I *guess* I‚Äôll buy it lol
---
Yeaaa. I can see that being a problem. Haha. Not to mention it doesnt work like that in real life. Architects and building contractors would be standing in the bread lines.
---
I actually really like this idea
---
Also the +endurance legendary effect does nothing, no extra health or AP benefits.
---
Yes stalkers sucks if you think about it. If you can land 10 hits in VATS with a 75% hit chance you get 7.5 shots and stalkers gives you 5 shots.
---
It's better that way lol. I've only ever found 1 excavator mod in the world
---
&gt; This doesn‚Äôt have to be a whole ordeal, drip-fed content would suit me just fine, but not atom shop content. &lt;‚ÄîNobody likes that. 
---
It's like you've only just started playing in the last few weeks or so.
---
The limited Fasnacht event added a bunch of decoratives for free. The rest of the DLC content is more of a drip-feed but they too each added something (alcohol crafting stations, tadpole/possum scout camp items etc.)

You know the system is called C.A.M.P., right? I get it's an acronym but the implication is pretty clear it's small and potentially mobile.
---
If there ever is a V.I.L.L.A. or T.O.W.N. options in future, sure if the servers can take it.
---
Player settlements are already so large that C.A.M.P. is not even appropriate. Should be more like H.O.M.E.
---
I mean I'm all for whatever the servers can bear. Real question is how much you'd be willing to pay for this? If the answer is nothing, good luck.
---
After a couple conversations I can answer a few of these...     
---
-They are less agile then they used to be, because they are a large company now, known evil.   
---
-From the one hour long call with their head of Customer Service and support They use Oracle are heavily silo'd, and can't just "walk over and talk to someone", the channels need to be observed.   
---
-Willing to bet hard caps atleast the lawyers are terrified of 3rd party ramifications...
---
There is hope, the fact a dialog has been opened, I can occasionally chat with Community Mangers directly to pass on critical issues, etc, which shortcuts the long non-transparent process gives at least me hope.

Thanks for the positive feedback, one techie to another..

When your bases would sometimes just disappear because it logged you into a server with an already-extant base there, single staircase sky boxes were the only way to reliably blueprint and move your base. And I just haven't substantially changed my base since before that update.
---
My kind of vendor
---
Nope. The only real use they have above level 10 is that they drop gear you can scrap to learn mods.
---
I agree it is tough, but I think it is due the the repetition and volume of the beeps. It is supposed to be tough.
---
The true BS is when someone else kills an officer and the body goes under the map.
---
I looked for one for 30 minutes before seeing his hand sticking out of the concrete in the mire.
---
Stalker actually serves some niche and interesting purpose thats related to what 'in combat' means for PvP, but its not commonly known, and while very useful when played right, certainly not the most powerful either.
---
My opinion on TS is that they loose a lot of reliability in your aiming. I think they got hit by collateral nerf that was supposed reduce explosive damage ridiculness. 
---
What sells isn't actually good indication of whats good. People pay a lot for anti armor energy weapons while anti armor only reduces DR, not the ER that negates energy damage, making it useless. TS lacks the kick it should have since it lands wherever it wants and the gunplay changes.
---
Nah. XBox and PC, but not PS4.  Reddit is actually the only place where my nic refers to how frequently I tinkle.
---
Not against the idea but why not just put a token item in your vendor for person to pay you? Could even literally be a token!
---
Once you see the popup stating x person has purchased that token, you conduct said service.
---
Purveyor only gives out max level weapons.

And your username and console please?

Just looked at the numbers. 9 points of the Gladiator perk adds 0 damage to the mole miner gauntlet. Thanks!

I‚Äôm fine with it being hard, but that‚Äôs just not how audio works. I don‚Äôt even want the codes, I just try to find them so I don‚Äôt have to listen to them.

---
Yep I love lots of Action Points, lots of perception, high luck formula calculations and chance to dodge incoming hits I get on my bloodied build. I think bloodied synergy tree is excellent and rest prefix lines should be reworked until they become similarily cool.
---
&gt; Beacuse its gone, so technically theyre not getting any profit from it. 
---
Umm... that's not how it works dude. All your doing is cannibalising sales that WOULD have gone to the Atom store and taken 90% of the revenue away from Bethesda (assuming 10% tax). 
---
No business manager in their right mind would take that deal.
---
I saw one floating platform today that made sense: it was built two stories high inside a pylon. It fit perfectly and the illusion  that it was supported by the pylon was perfect.
---
Keep the tesla (make it automotic), get some vanguard armor, get the marsupial mutation and bird bones. Get some stealhboys. Then just stealthboy around, jumping everywhere, spraying the ground woth your tesla... theres literally no defense to this tactic besides a missile launcher with a targeting computer.
---
My wife won't let me play in front of my 5 year old after he started trying to slash the dog's throat with his "combat knife". So... Yeah, you're doing fine.
---
This is so cool. Do you have directions/a map on how to find these? I want to visit them!
---
you can buy them cheaper from other players, check player vending machines, just do not pay more then 500 a serum. i sell mine for 360, because the benefits could turn things around for you.
---
Here is one for you.....    
---
Level 50 Heavy Left Limbs for Combat armor drop roughly 1 time for every 250'ish Right limbs, on PC, Legendary Vendor aside (not enough data there yet)
---
It should be an endgame amount regardless. It should be so much that an end game player should actually have to sit and think about a purchase so high. Do I spend 25k on my stash limit or buy a new weapon or armor. Just catering a stash increase to newer players isn't the answer. Remember managing a 400lb stash, that took some major skills.
---
Absolutely. I want to be a wasteland cop.
---
Wait, the Dense Combat Armor PLAN, or the MOD?
---
Yeah not atoms. Just caps. The game needs a good cap sink and this would be a good way to do it.
---
May I see it?
---
Yes but it's gone because they chose to no longer sell it. This creates the urgency for you to buy now or lose out on the deal. 
---
If you can just get from other players at any given time, their is no longer any urgency on the limited offer. 
---
So yes, they would lose profits. Because when sale comes along again, you'd no longer want to buy it because you already got it off another player, at which point Bethesda only got the 10% tax instead of full atom price.
---
Your missing the point. And im not gonna argue. Sooooo your right. Have a good day
---
Ooh! What about the other perks like Can Do! Or the ammunition one? That'd be kinda cool
---
Umm... might help if you give some sense on what it's about and maybe why we should care to go?
---
I'm not going to even bother clicking on that link without knowing whether or not the content is worth checking out.
---
More behemoths pleases
---
It's not for the reason you said but yes it happens. It's not just you. 
---
Welcome mats would be a welcome solution to fix this issue.
---
It's just people wanting the easy way out. They don't know the pain of managing a 400lb stash. They want to come straight outta the vault with a 1k stash limit or more.
---
That's it!
---
As should  treasure maps.
---
They weren't even duped as far as I could tell. He just had like 15 or so different rifles with different *s and effects. It was the only weapons for sale at his camp.
---
So make the game even more of a snowflake fest?
---
They should at least be equivalent to a level 3 locked safe, with chance for a rare weapon like Gatling Plasma or a plan. And/or based on player level
---
Any news on this bug? My comp have been freezing a lot for doing something similar; like eating / drinking. The only way to get out from it, it's to ALT F4 the game.
---
Awesome would like to see that shop
---
It's not the instigating, it's the stealth. Usually happens when your target has another non-stealthed enemy closer than you are (either a player or a monster from a different race). Worst case is when you're playing with a team and they blunder around in PA in front of you.
---
Alright. Thanks for the feedback. It's always helpful to have a different perspective. To answer your question, my friend and I are exploring Flatwoods on our way to Morgantown. He has never played the game before. I sprinkle a few funny clips in as well.
---
I still run bloodied/unyielding

Batteries Included is the better perk to go with drops core weights to 0.3 so you get 10 for the weight of 3.
---
Here's a video of the [super mutants vs sheepsquatch random encounter](https://youtu.be/9Kw7zC5sFtg).
---
I'm fine if you don't want to discuss it but the point isn't lost on me. You want to earn atoms by reselling items you've purchased from the atom store.
---
Bethesda would be stupid to a. introduce competition where there is none b. cannibalise their own revenue by doing so.
---
Have you seen how stingy Bethesda are in terms of free atoms from dailies and weeklies? Sure they're generous upfront but they're stingy AF long term. They're not going to make it easier for you to earn Atom.
---
Though good luck on you if this gets any traction.
---
Ummm...sure?
---
Noice!
---
Its called  McClintic Wildlife Management Area
---
They are a little hard to find if you go down one of the many roads you will see little concrete barriers on the left and right sides of the roads go past those and you should see them some are open some aren't 
---
ALSO WARNING some report's say that there are unexploded landmines so I would just stay on the trail just in case
---
I was for awhile but now I realize how BGS is handling this game, I chucked 'em.  They will never be worth anything but garbage.
---
Maybe the kids are still in there for the next wave of settlers?
---
I would love for there to be some stealthy power armour. I just don‚Äôt use it unless fighting SBQ for the defence bonuses.
---
There you go. Now I'm curious. You just got a view :)
---
Hehehe that‚Äôs actually pretty funny
---
Hi curious. you just got a view :), I'm dad.
---
Ope? Do you live in the land of ranch dressing?
---
Awesome. I saw the WMA but it‚Äôs tough to see where the individual igloos are located! I suppose just driving around might be my best bet!
---
That or the 2nd floor of the Top of the World.

One sec let me see
---
Honestly I'd much rather they fix bugs than create a safe space

Glad I clarified and peaked your interest. Thanks for checking it out.

Like creative mode? I‚Äôd be ok with small private world just the size of our camp, but it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to h e unlimited if it‚Äôs for practice. Same size and space limitations but unlimited resources to play with? Maybe...
---
Nice! I've got Furious Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma, Prime .50 cal that I use for the Queen. .50 can is the worst because the ammo is such a pain to acquire. Fusion Cores you can farm from power plants, find in loose PA, Sentry Bots and Fusion Generators. Plasma Cores are kinda rare tho
---
Yes it is... Couldn‚Äôt hit a shot with my Instigating Handmade with Concentrated Fire and took it off and almost never misses

Thank you!!

lol, mind telling me which vendor you have seen carrying it??
---
I remember you have to go true  a grave yard 
---
Its Been months since I've been
---
All good bud, not like it even matters. Just internet points. 
---
However i do offer my apologies if my assumptions on you were wrong. Whether these points matter or not is irrelevant. I obviously don't know you, or you me.
---
Have a good one bud, may you be blessed with a godly legendary roll on your next kill.
---
Would it be the first hundred or the last? Cause for most ppl that would translate to a 700 lb stash if so..
---
Harpers ferries good option to check
---
Making bank off tourists shitting their pants.
---
So like a sandbox mode? That‚Äôs pretty much a private server, something that we all want. But we ain‚Äôt getting that any time soon lol
---
No problem watch out for deer
---
Unlimited resources to only to create.  You still need to obtain them when you go to Adventure or Survival.  
---
The blueprinting was just a way to save the build design and not give the resources when you go back to survival or adventure.
---
What extra personality do they have over others games? I'd say it's the total opposite. A few new speech lines that get repetitive like in previous games and one NPC that says a few things. Meh.
---
Ok, I'll do a bit of server hopping and see if maybe I was just unlucky. I have tried him quite a few times already, but who knows?? If this works you have my thanks! :)
---
Complete that bucket list from the tourist when you picked up his camera and you get a mod from it that let's you zoom in
---
Something is going on not sure what though. Sometimes my Instigating Handmade seems to do more Damage than my IE lever action on the first shot. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
 I will, if thjere's more than one. ;) 
---
 I won't forget, I named a big ass Black Bear, that charged me once, Thomas.
---
You would choose what you don‚Äôt want to be raided
---
I used to have a minigame CAMP that when you win you get to a room that has a vending machine full of free loot with a sign to just take 3 sets of 3. A few people took nothing, and the rest was split between 2 groups: People who took everything and people who took a random amount (never the 3 sets of 3 lol). I eventually ran out of things to give people and I built another vending for people to leave tips and with that I started buying other camps dog food and other good prizes when they're cheap but most people have low inventory and high prices so it's pretty hard. I'm trying out some other ideas now :)
---
Oh thank you ! It‚Äôs been so long I forgot about that, I will get back to that quest tomorrow night then... :)
---
The acronym doesn‚Äôt really play that big of a part, I think. I mean if they expected the vault dwellers to make camps, then we wouldn‚Äôt really have all the structural aspects and everyone would be making cozy campfires on a cliff side. I understand what you mean, but the players are constantly building very interesting things, and I believe with a bit more they could construct even better things.
---
"I considered attacking you on sight, but I don't think I could hurt you more than life already has."
---
This has happened to me now at least on 8 different occasions. She just ups and high tails it for the mountains to the north east of Watoga and never comes back. Really sucks after dumping 1K+ of ammo into her too!
---
ROTFLMFAO! Thanks man. ;)
---
Interestingly enough, I think that's where she goes once the event timer runs out..I'm wondering if it's a bug where the timer is glitched out and she just thinks it's time to go away prematurely.
---
Well it's good you still kept his piece of paper lol that zoom feature comes in handy
---
Oh and the Fasnacht event wasn‚Äôt bad, but it didn‚Äôt add really anything that good. A bonfire with an old man on it, some scrappy flags, and some other banners that would really go with nothing else in the game but itself. I just think a building DLC could arise, with more building components so people could really make cool stuff.
---
There are plenty of ass hats around but there are also good ones around too. Unfortunately just what we have to deal with.....
---
I know, it was a complement, not a legit suggestion
---
It should be at the Black Powder vendor at The Whitespring. Well it was there, who knows what they've done.
---
Its cheaper to buy the 2 leg mods unless you plan on making your own and sell to others. I can make the mod for you if you BYOMs.
---
Good job - it's always hardest locating the imposter as he runs around like a maniac.
---
"Removing this would make part of the structure inaccessible." no it bloody wouldn't you stupid piece of software *there's nothing above it*
---
Doesnt work with the ammo one, I've tried. On the wiki it says percent chance of dropping aid items, armor, and weapons, so Can Do might work.
---
Ahh interesting, yeah all of those times we still had like 8+ minutes left so we were no where near close to running out of time. That is an interesting thought though....
---
Or have it be like your budget where instead of being a 15 block Diameter, you get that equivalent area.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary
---
I disagree with the price. In endgame, some players throw around 50k for something entirely useless. It has to be accessible to lower levels.
---
Same with mine, if you look at the photo I uploaded you can see that there's still 9 minutes and 23 seconds left. I almost guarantee it has something to do with the way they coded the event, I don't know enough about anything like that to definitively say so though  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Awesome, thanks! Inside, right?
---
I get game freezes and crashes but never a bsod. That's gotta be computer related. I'd be looking at the GPU settings.
---
I found a solution to this and made my suggestion
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you don‚Äôt understand the math of this situation.
---
1 x 1400=1400 (combined cap pool)
---
7 x 200=1400 (separate cap pools)
---
Either way it‚Äôs the same total caps per cycle. Both before and after the change, there‚Äôs a limit that refreshes every 20 hours or so. If you have more to sell, wait until that time the next day and sell more. But this is no different than before they combined the cap pools- you had to wait then too, PLUS you had to waste caps fast traveling to all the vendor factions to actually hit that 1400.  Hope that helps

Everytime I see a player I wave at them and heart sign. Gives me good feelings inside.
---
You monster! LMFAO
---
So I'm still waiting. Sure, I saved some "time" by not needing to fast travel to locations to sell since i can do it all at once, but the fact is I'm still waiting 20 hours.

Damn - PS4 here - won‚Äôt be able to use - hope someone can though!

I hope you subscribe to r/fo76filthycasuals - that behavior fits right in

Deathninja47 psn im lvl 23
---
THIS THIS THIS 
---
I dont care about new content 
---
I want to play the game without server disconnects every 30 minutes 
---
Ive played online mmo games before and never had this problem
---
Indeed and it won't change ever. Especially with the new floating homes now.
---
When I owned the game if just build a singular shack, put a lot of effort into my blueprints. I had a  blueprint for every area I'd want to build in.  The last time i plaid before I sold my copy was I think right next to silo alpha in the lake. Don't know if they patched it but low-key kinda want to get the game again.
---
Now that's a great idea. We could build off of this.
---
*Affect.
---
Wow.  I think ive seen Mothman once since I started.
---
By design, the buildings are more or less squares. If they would make the buildable area a square shape, there would be little more buildable space, without compromising the size of the radius, which would not jeopardize the integrity of the servers stability. 
---
At least no more than they already are.
---
Perhaps its because the majority of Fallout players really don't care for PvP and have tried it, found they didn't like it and now don't play it much anymore?
---
Nah ...... that's ridiculous thinking.
---
 Yeah. No. I have a Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat Knife and its a lovely thing ... at night. ;)
---
Yeah and I hate when I have to make sure I'm not outside the radius too much when I build all the way to the edge. I miss the corner floors and walls from Fallout 4. Especially the concrete version (not the brick).
---
I hate those. Lol. Ive seen people get scammed from those houses. Theyre built over a cliff. People buy junk from their vendor, and the camp owner deletes the floor from underneath them and they fall to their death. Camp owner collects the junk and resells it to their next victim. I always shop in power armor now. Lol
---
I still go out of my way to share hits on legendary enemies, even if it means keeping a 6 pack of molotov cocktails on hand to lob in for minor burning damage on the lvl 40 and under squishy three stars.
---
What I find amazing, is that while numerous people report bugs/glitches u/aten_ra not only compiles all current, but also suggests fixes for the code. That‚Äôs some serious knowledge to be able to do that.
---
Are you on Xbox to make money off me for that sweet sweet candy~
---
It is the creepiest thing on the planet especially when you walk by not expecting it... think I soiled my x-01...
---
What system are you on?  And would you happen to have a plan for the Western Revolver?  I'm having trouble finding mods for it! :(
---
So long as it doesn't affect server performance at all, I'm all for it!
---
i have 254 and can't pick more, This is maximum amount of holotapes
---
Yeah, and not to mention that it stacks multiplicatively with sneak attacks, in a game where escape artist is so hilariously broken
---
I think the last bit of new content revived a few assholes and I have found a few griefers the past few weeks. I‚Äôm sure they recovered just fine and have already forgotten but it‚Äôs fucking hilarious that is was an accident.
---
There is bug with melee and vats just don't hit your target without reason. I missed all 6 round of my revolver with 95% hit chance once
---
I completed it in 30 minutes by being the only person in the Burrows, without being an asshole to anyone other than some ghouls and a handful of robots.  I was on a "hot" server, which certainly helped.  One of those servers where two three stars are standing next to each other and the single star gear is coming in like candy.
---
Still no end game content, but enough content for 200+ hours
---
loved that in fallout new vegas
---
as well, as the classic weapons mod 
---
I want to kill a scorch beast with a BAR 
---
or pick them off a distance with a anti material rifle
---
shooting scorched at long distance  with a M1 Garland or k98 would be badass as well
---
Midnight CDT
---
Took me about 4 hours to get him to spawn the other day, was in the middle of killing a yaoi gai with the syringer, every time I got the fucker close to death, someone would come along and shoot it, or I'd accidentally switch to a different weapon and kill it myself.
---
Figured i'd kill two birds with one stone at the civil war cemetery. That was gorram annoying.
---
Me either.  I'm 99% sure it's bugged.  I've done the event at least 100 times with a high end rifle.  You'd think that at least once I'd get the kill shot.
---
I haven't been keeping track of light/sturdy/heavy, but most of the gear that I just happened to roll with good effects seems to be heavy. I'm also on PC and have been keeping track of my purveyor rolls, I help you gather data if you'd like
---
There are are other ways to get things than from workshops. Contesting them is a detrimental part of the game that should be removed. Don't like it? Go play survival, and  harvest your materials there.
---
Yes, I've noticed this, but I just thought it was my crappy marksmanship.  Nice to know I may not suck after all lol
---
Sly sneaky snumiping survivor...
---
Thanks! I was surprised how fast it went down.
---
Just happened tonight.  Says one thing on one screen then on map says another.
---
Seems to have cleared up. Was happening really but gotten better now....
---
Thanks, I didn't know that jetpacks use fusion cores, now I am happy to have it sold. My stim pump is the best, saved my butt so many times.
---
Do reactive plates also cost core energy when being hit??
---
Not a bad start dude. Certainly more engaging than I lot of others I've seen. Keep at it and you might get somewhere.
---
If you don't mind some unsolicited feedback, love that you read out what's on the screen e.g. holotape and terminal names. Always a good thing, especially considering people may be more listening than watching the video.
---
On the other hand, there's a lot of dead air. Might be an idea to edit it out or talk through it like you're thinking out loud or wondering on what's to come. This kind of thing is fine when you're playing but feels very different as a passive viewer. Particularly one that's already seen the game.
---
All the best dude!
---
That's what I thought, but as far as I can tell the Black Powder vendor no longer sells any mods, which is why I thought it might not be available any more. We really need a dataminer to know for sure I think, unless somebody can confirm having bought one recently.
---
It‚Äôs the only pvp left in adventure üòÇüòÇ quit bitchin and get good.
---
Yeah. Me as well. Been happening to me for a few days. Server hopping has fixed it. Just taking the armor off and on didn't.
---
Basically what I do. Set up vendor machines and generator so my store is still open and get to building. It takes a while but I enjoy the camp building aspects. One thing I learned early on is to be careful with stairs, often times they're locked in once you place.
---
Haha no,  PS4 sorry.
---
Is it really necessary? Low levels first quest takes them to a stash
---
Against pacifist players?
---
Aren't players under lvl 5 immune to PvP?
---
Dad? Is that really you? Why did you leave us? Did I do something wrong? Please come back!
---
I want it for my Dragon. That thing already has insane range, but the ridiculous reload time would really benefit from a nice stabby secondary bash attack.
---
Yea if I join on an lfg post it does it. Then when I quit and rejoin from the main menu it works fine! It definitely sucks.
---
Just for convenience, it's such a through point for the whole game, free travel.
---
Definitely happening on Xbox. I have 3 weapon reduction pieces that are not doing anything right now.
---
I get you üëç
---
That‚Äôs what I thought while cleaning his brains off my bat.
---
It‚Äôs been happening to me for several weeks now.
---
Bloodied for damage is still meta in my opinion for pure damage. I haven't seen a Junkie build that gets close to 10k damage per hit (if there is a junkie build that does, I would enjoy watching that for certain). 
---
Honestly, everyone has their own opinion of what a meta build is. My advice is to go through the posts, and find which build best suits your play style. The top builds that are usually discussed are:
---
Bloodied, TSE, Junkie, Instigating, and PA Focused.
---
Research which fits you best, then make it your own. Don't spend all of your perk points until you have gained some insight and have a clear direction to take your build. 
---
Lastly, don't try to do multiple builds into the same build. For example, if you are going to do Instigating (usually Sneak/Sniper), don't also go for a ton of melee perks. A "Jack of all Trades" is never really good at anything. 
---
This is the build that fits my play style best, because I like doing ungodly damage, but I also don't mind dying frequently. I hope this helps. 
---

---
Yea I‚Äôm on Xbox as well. I hope this can be sorted out.
---
Sounds glitchy
---
But I don‚Äôt think you can put a bayonet on a dragon
---
But when?  Where?  You should be able to say ‚Äúoh it was community feedback #13‚Äù so the issue is put to rest and stops coming up.  Otherwise it‚Äôs just ‚Äúoh that reddit post‚Äù which is a horrible way to talk to customers.
---
Yea me too. It‚Äôs been a few weeks for me too and I‚Äôm not sure what causes it because server hoping fixes it.
---
Lol yea I just wish we could have at least one person tend our camp while we‚Äôre out exploring.
---
Last time I put on hooded rags, it removed all of my armor. That was a week ago.
---
Stick with piercing not sure have to check later
---
Sorry if this seems obvious, but are they plans you've learned? Those are at the top. If you haven't, they're down further in the P's.
---
Im a vendor and I sell crafting materials for those who are lazy and dont wish to find the items themselves.
---
In turn I use that massive amount of income to fund my need for ammunition and weapon crafting for scrapping to learn some mods.
---
Its impossible to not keep everything especially since I charge a fee for modifying weapons that no one else can do say radium rifles and the like.
---
Nice try Todd.
---
OT it is very fun. Has its issues but not an objectively bad game.
---
Yeah, I've heard that. I have a certain look I'm going for though, so my little dude had better learn to toughen up!
---
Hey im on now, sorry i missed ya earlier
---
‚ÄúWelcome to the surface!‚Äù *thwack*
---
Blame Bethesda for their restrictions they added in 76, it's meant to stop this stuff but instead means it's the easiest option
---
I am really glad you liked it and a huge thanks for the feedback. I don't tend to leave quite as much dead space as I did in this video, but I definitely agree that it was a bit jarring after watching it back myself.
---
Again thanks for watching and all the great points to consider.
---
The most popular mods are just ones that help with the clusterfuck of an inventory
---
Oof I can't get on right now because I have to wake up early tomorrow for finals. I can get on tomorrow at 11:30 ct
---
Makes sense but i dont think its a necessity
---
Nay. Makes the game too easy.
---
Ok il try and catch up with you then
---
It's still more restrictive than fo4
---
Damn... I have not started the Pioneer Scout thing but have scrapped plenty a DC hide
---
Whitesprings isn't really a place for below 20. It's a very popular place for people to frequent, so most of the time you will be getting level 42-68 ghouls spawning in.

With that said, my personal favorite low level weapon was the pump action shotgun. It deals a ton of damage and isn't too difficult to maintain. Other than that, the 10mm smg is a solid choice too. It was all right back when I started, but since then it received a buff
---
Convenience like hooking up newbies, switching out apparel or weapons to finish challenges, as you're using it as the free fast travel anchor .
---
Meteoric Sword is level 25, it's a really good weapon. I recommend melee because of your limited ammo resources. But don't spend your perk points until you know what kind of build you are going for.
---
Most of the quest weapons are very good early on, like Black Diamond and All Rise, although if you really like them, wait until level 50 to complete those quests.
---
I mean what could i possibly do with 600 pounds of junk when my total gear weighs a sliver of that amount?
---
I'd want to sell it and they're *Bulked items* already. 
---
My gear only weights 15 pounds, wearing a full set of weightless BOS combat armor with the ultra light build and perk making my armor weigh 0. My rifle eats up 10 pounds due to modifications and such and the rest ammo, and a stims.
---
Im a travelling merchant with a lot of gear on PS4 and *I never PVP* so no need for me to worry.
---
Oh that's friggin *AWESOME!!* You rock dude, thank you!!
---
Wow we‚Äôre
---
How didn't he appear on the map?
---
Also what i thought
---
... No.
---
I used a modded hunting rifle until I got a sniper rifle. Kinda depends on where you want your build to go though.
---
I will have to look for a smg...is it a quest item?
---
So, 100 pounds of spoiled meat &amp; vegetables, then is up for grabs...
---
Most of the my armor reduces the weight of my stuff (Guns, Food, Chems, etc)
---
So wearing Power Armor is actually a *drawback* since armor effects don't stack while in it, meaning for me it's only good for tough fights and rad areas
---
I never did manage a 400lb stash. 
---
I had account mules for that very reason due to the limited space.
---
I'd fork over 5k caps for like 50lbs of space which I would consider fair.
---
Low levels can literally obtain caps at a fair rate if they know what they're doing.
---
My last main quest was the scorch mine so I havent ran into those quests yet.
---
It's old, but most of it should still be good
---
There is no best. Really depends on what you want to do. Might help to say what kind of thing you want to do? Ranged sniper? Shotguns? Melee? Automatics?
---
If you're starting over, XP grind spots are less of a priority over early game where proper gear acquisition matters more.
---
For XP though, Mama Dolce's event for the canned food XP boost, cranberries at at the farm NW of the Forest too. 
---
Find quests/events generally better for XP early game than raw kills. Anywhere with super mutants are generally good. Lumbermill west of that cranberry farm is good if you can handle it. Crashed plane at Horizon's Nest (or whatever is called). Wade Airport.
---
Once you have a PA frame and are like 20-30, you can hit up the usual suspects.
---
Yeah I know that but still, do you think the serums in the bunker should be cheaper?
---
I just figured thats what yhe overseers camp was for
---
Anything that is effective. I have a shotgun, hunting rifle and 9mm handgun.
---
Pretty much lol, I need some thinking to do lmao
---
For XP I grind Ghouls at WS, Events (especially Monster Mash), and SBQ. 
---
For build, it depends on what your style of play is.
---
If your vendor is powered, your camp appears yellow. Especially with an ally nearby, it can be difficult to ‚Äòfind tune‚Äô the cursor to spot the other yellow dot.
---
Oh.
---
he said he was crouching lol
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
I'd post it under cheating/exploiting, that seems the closest
---
he was crouching ;-;
---
I guess not in Survival.
---
I would have assumed that too though.  Or, at least, that there would be some kind of safety area for someone who literally just left the Vault.
---
Oh i getcha, itd be cool
---
You can travel to your camp for free
---
Don't worry I'm on ps4 and am looking for adrenal reaction, scaly skin, electrically charged and carnivore... Do you have these for sale?
---
üëè - seriously, now that was savage. 
---
Well depicted in print as well. üòÇüòÇ
---
Power armor + a fire axe with spiked mod for puncturing. You can kill even the level 62 ghouls with 2-3 power attacks to the head. You can literally do this at level 5. Not kidding. Probably the fastest way to power level yourself. They, they will hurt like hell until you get into at least raider power armor. I'd recommend leveling 1-10 normally (do your responder quests and unlock your workbenches), then farming a full set of level 15 raider power armor from 10 to 15 at Cliffwatch (look it up on [fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com)), then farming whitesprings.
---
I don't know why, but I had a good laugh about this. So funny. Poor level 2. I'm so bad for laughing..thanks
---
You are possibly on them right now at your level. They are long chain quests. 
---
Until you get a decent legendary, I would consider any melee that does decent damage and won't break easily. When I was that level I was rocking any 1 handed sword-style weapon I could find. 
---
The Meteoric Sword drops from the "Breach and Clear" event.
---
Why do you feel the need to camp close to marked locations? Serious question. I am asking cause I camp out off the main road near flatwoods way out on a trail where nothings near me within 250m in any direction. I love it away from the world. Just wondering.
---
I should have them but I'm off for the night now. I can give them to you tomorrow.
---
I did, I also replied to the follow up email. I would like to be able to assist the investigation team in figuring out what my report was about. Make it easier for them.
---
I'll look up cliff watch never been there
---
my god, the same. i think i even hear it after im done playing randomly throughout the day
---
Thats true, i dont have a vendor in my camp yet! But we thought we saw him on the map, then he disappeared, probably started crouching that time :3
---
I let my 3 year old play his low level character all the time. He runs around the forest looking straight up firing his gun. Don't mind him.
---
If you change the pvp scaling it will become the default best though. I'd rather have certain effects available, like improved DR vs. players (basically assassin's). Not saying you should get literally every legendary armor stat available on it.
---
I think you should drop the INT requirement and instead make it optional.
---
If your INT is high enough you can just do the thing, if not, you gotta find a way to cheat, which takes a little longer. :3
---
Otherwise I LOVE this post!
---
 I think he sold the plan. I have not looked in quite a while.
---
Fire Axe, machete or spear for melee. Barbed walking cane is surprisingly decent low level and easy to obtain/build.
---
Double or pump shotgun, hunting rifle, .44 pistol, pipe revolver or pipe bolt action for ranged. Depends a lot on mods you have and available ammo.
---
Don't overlook throwables too. Very handy low level, especially grenades, throwing knives and tomohawks. Readily available but easily overlooked.
---
O.o wtf now that's cheating and not called for.
---
Ah the machete....it does wonders indeed
---
If they built a stash at V76, then new players would feel like they would need to go back there, because it's all they would know at first. 
---
The Overseer's Camp is about a 3 minute jog away at best.
---
I‚Äôm guilty of that but it‚Äôs never intended. I‚Äôve got a Bloodied melee build so I can‚Äôt really nerf my damage. I could nerf my damage by working at full health but then I‚Äôd be over-encumbered for the event because of my unyielding armor.
---
What this guy said. There's little need for it unless you run a lot of mules.
---
I actually like seeing some of the clever ways different players use what they've got, though.  Grafting a building into an existing structure.  Co-opting an existing farm.  Fasnacht poles in place of beams.  Diner setups.  Vendor windows.
---
More variety is always nice, but never underestimate player creativity.
---
Lol, brutal
---
How does one get the frog in the jar?
---
Nah, I found some in containers and from crowned enemies around the ash heap. That's where they first start appearing. If you get lucky you might find a plan for them, too. Some vendor probably sells it
---
Oh, you sure can! :)  
---

---
Nuked WS ghouls are great if you can reliably respawn them. This means either having a friend stay on the server and reloading the server after every clear, or running two accounts. Note that it's \~8-10 minutes before things can respawn, and others will obviously be there taking your nuked spawns. Waiting for everyone to get a tag in slows things down so much that it isn't worth it.
---
If that's not an option, West Tek and Harper's Ferry are both good spots. West Tek is always mutants - like 20-30 of them. Good chance of legendaries spawning, pretty quick to clear. As for build, that's up to you. Rifles, shotguns, heavy weapons (my preferred) or melee all do the job. Heavy weapons don't require stealth to be effective though, so there's that - you can sprint around everywhere unloading into enemies faces without trying to be sneaky.
---
Regardless of what build you go, I'd recommend doing a bloodied build, or maybe using a low health build + an instigating weapon instead of bloodied to ensure 1 shot kills.
---
Any updates on this?
---
I have the same problem but i have it on my person, when i go to holotape it duplicates one of the same tapes every time i scoll through it.  Its fustrating to have to dump the same holotapes everyday.
---
Same
---
They should pay you.
---
Thank you
---
You can get a special one from a quest that spawns at the water park up north, but it's a 10 leveling weapon, so the strongest you will get is a level 20 until you reach level 30.
---
FO76 is honestly fun at any level. And it's not hyper-competitive. So you can pick it up and put it down anytime without worrying that you will be so far behind that you will never catch up. That is why I believe this game will have longevity.
---
I feel that. I had both an instigating and AA railway rifle (with prime receivers) and I ditched the AA. Granted it might done better in full Auto but I had a hunter‚Äôs explosive that I made full Auto and the AA one was the odd man out at that point. 
---
I think it‚Äôs definitely better suited to high RoF weapons.
---
Yeah, I recently completed my FDC set and seems like when I use it and then switch to power armor, thru hiker doesn‚Äôt work
---
As long as you gave them whatever information you could get (player name, the picture you linked...I think that's about it), they'll take it from there.
---
For reports like these, you generally won't hear back much except for information requests (as you found out), you won't get updates on what they do...the most would be 'we took appropriate action', and rarely even that.  There's some potential liability if they give out too much info about any actions they take.  So don't expect much satisfaction, just know that they're taking it seriously, and will do what they think is best.
---
(I've got a couple decades of experience with these things, this is all pretty much industry standard these days)
---
It should assuming the hazmat gives you 0 DR. Which I think it does?
---
There's a whole street of market stalls where the Van Lowe taxidermy place is, Lewisburg I think.  That would be perfect too.
---
For PvP it's pretty much "whoever sees the other guy first and gets off the first few rounds wins". For PvE you can either go the sneaky crit rifle route, the sneaky crit shotgun route, the sneaky crit melee route, or the "wtf is stealth?" heavy weapons + PA build. IF you're doing pve, you should be doing a bloodied build. If you're doing pvp, you should MAYBE be doing a bloodied build.
---
Hmmm...then I unfortunately have nothing. That almost seems report-worthy to me. Probably nothing will come of it, but I haven't heard of this happening to anyone. Which plans did you get?
---
Only issue is people could abuse it by building really long thin bases.
---
Aaah ok. Well that's a damn shame :\ That explains why I wasn't aware of it, as back then I wasn't into my Bloodied weapons like I am now, so hadn't really paid attention to health like now lol
---
Also, while I guess I didn't specifically mean the textures being shared between the armor and the robots, I just meant more in terms of lore, as a reason we *should* have some color choices. I didn't rock the Robot armor much in FO4 so I didn't recall if it had or not, but sorta assumed since they share names with the Metal armor that it would also change the look.
---
Indeed, I figure it's a composite material based armor, so plastic and fiberglass, but more realistically I'd say plastic and ballistic fiber. :)
---
Yep, every patch is a concern over being able to get it from home, or sitting at the library for a few hours over a couple days. That's what makes it extra frustrating to have all these large patches with so few bugs squashed, and even so many additional bugs cropping up/resurfacing :( But... the issue with the long freezes during SBQ/Imposter fights is almost nonexistent for me now, which is a huge QoL improvement in itself! I'll take the overbright terrain texture issue over the momentary freezes during boss fights *any day!* heh
---
Thanks for all your bug work and help/info!
---
Giant trailers
---
I'm logging in right now, probably 5 minutes I'll be in. IGN Sertith.
---
So do you toggle the thru hiker between power armor? Like do you take off normally but thenput it on with PA? Or do you use them together?
---
Gratz on 100 subs! Have an upvote (both here and on YT), because being a small youtuber is fuckin hard. Been there. Technically still there at 15K subs heh. Hit me up if you want to play sometime - Knight\_Wanderer. I'd even roll a new toon with ya because being 385 is boring as hell.
---
I am running with speedstep off. Just checked it.

Guess that means you're not very special huh?

I kid, you probalby have herd mentality mutation.

How do you lock a door?

I‚Äôll see your Mutant Slayers rolling pin and raise you a Furious one with RW and limb damage!

---
This ever get fixed?
---
I have three pieces of FDC so that has allowed me to use level one thru hiker and traveling pharmacy, since three pieces is 60%. That gives me extra perk slots which is nice. When I switch to power armor I go back to the level three perks.
---
It doesn't take much! Especially once you picture what you want to build! I'm a potato mate too :I
---
50 dollars?! That‚Äôs a scam
---
It's a MASSIVE improvement over launch. take your time. Enjoy the story. Do all the side quests. Explore every location. But, definitely ask for advice on builds and what works end game, because this is NOT like Fallout 4 - you will struggle if you don't build your character right.
---
According to the Fallout wiki there's not really a concrete date for when he actually became self-aware, so I suppose in theory it could happen. The pre-existing communication between him and MODUS could also serve to explain how the Enclave manages to bolster its forces and resources so significantly between Fallout 2-3 after such a devastating defeat back west; the Enclave cell operating in Appalachia could have canonically been rebuilt by like-minded 76 dwellers and subsequently their descendants would have helped reinforce Raven Rock's ranks.
---
Tl;dr as far as I can tell, it's theoretically possible and plausible.
---
And what did we learn?
---
Sadly no,  I think one was to make antibiotics and I forgot the other but they aren‚Äôt listed anywhere
---
Thanks, man! I appreciate you taking the time to write a spiteful comment like that, really shows this post was worth a troll. Thanks for the laugh, my guy
---
Like what areas are you referring to? Behind the Whitesprings Golf Club?
---
&lt;&lt; This is what V2 was for. &gt;&gt;
---
Fallout 1, 2, 3, NV, 4 are all single player games, 76 is the only multiplayer game. Fallout has been single player forever. I'm not sure why you're quibbling.
---
It is definitely challenging, but I enjoy being able to get creative with my videos so it's worth it. As for a team up that would be a lot of fun. We'll have to work something out. :)
---
Maxed out on my high level and working on my alt's stash of requisitions. Hopefully this will work out.
---
You're right, never thought of that.
---
Antibiotics I believe, I‚Äôll try to run one again and screen grab the names
---
Don't get caught with your pants around your ankles lol
---
Survival was developed to get the pvpers away from pve players. Now you wanna get away from pve players?  Maybe this game isn‚Äôt for you.
---
Indeed
---
Ok that‚Äôs what I assumed. That‚Äôs a pretty damn good idea! I haven‚Äôt had issues with thru hiker but I use three cards and it saves me like 150 pounds!
---
no.. 
---
I dont want people grabbing up all my lead.. lol
---
Ah. Dumping 250 requisitions into stash.....
---
Do still to open supply drops "randomly" makes you wanted or it was fixed?
---
I'm fine with the closest one being at Overseer's CAMP. It's like a 3 cap FT cost.
---
I second this question.
---
If I had to guess though, my money is on base weapon damage.
---
Aren't level 2 players immune to PvP? And how did you deal 200+ damage with a single swing while not sneaking, since the game spawns you standing up? For that matter, how did you accidentally swing? My game always locks my controls until things are fully loaded in
---
That's a whole lot of coincidences.
---
So a two shot on a single fire rifle is not good? Like a sniper? Damn it i got 2 pipe bolts i was going to mod to snipers!
---
I‚Äôm telling you guys it‚Äôs not a thing. I picked up the controller and hit R2, swung, he ran forward and got hit in the head. I thought he‚Äôd be immune too lol.
---
I used a baseball bat for a good portion of the early game until I got my first legendary super sledge. Baseball bats are pretty easy to find and they get a good list of mods I probably kept using them till level 40
---
That's very interesting, I hadn't thought of how it makes sense like that. After all, there's no reason why MODUS couldn't at some point re-establish communication with Raven Rock and combine forces. It's not even that much of a stretch to say that Vault Dweller's could've found Raven Rock directly by just walking there since West Virginia is pretty close to Washington D.C.
---
who?
---
I don't know
---
[](/bobsbsilly)Well at fallout 76's timescale we'll reach the events of Fallout 3 in around 8 RL years(if you don't count your birth). However Eden contacted the Enclave after the events of fallout 2 which at it's eariliest would only take 5 RL years to get to.  
---
In lore Eden *is* at raven rock and functioning, and he does have all the stories of the presidents that inspired his personallity. I suppose it isn't impossible for him to be somewhat self aware at this point, perhaps not fully developed. It would be pretty cool to have a quest where we get to see him and Modus working together. Maybe we'll even see Eden's self awareness take shape during the quest.
---
Its not though, and the fact that the other two mode are so under used either didn't remember they existed, or simply didn't care enough to mention them kinda proves my point about PVP in adventure mode being a waste of coding only used by trolls and cowards.
---
How about Challenge-Free mode? Unlimited junk ammo and aid, you get to pick any weapons and armor from a master list, no enemies above level 2, and no radiation. Plus 500 xp every 3 minutes just for hanging around.
---
That's really nice! I like how it's set up like a shared dwelling of multiple people. Keep doing the good works of rebuilding America
---
Can‚Äôt recommend builds as mine is garbage but for early exp I‚Äôd say claim a workshop server hop claim it again. That comes with the bonus of getting plans and a decent amount of exp for a minutes work
---
Is there a caps cap?
---
They're a proper pain these days. Highly recommend recommend you don't put them in your vendor. It'll split stacks &amp; get stuck buncha of annoyances basically.
---
I stopped grabbing them. Was previously a pretty good seller, think I cleared about two stacks of 50+ at 5 caps each.
---
That could work, especially if you go with Juicehead's theory on how the Wastelanders DLC will move the timeline forward since on the Pip-boy in 76, the date never actually changes (idk if we're supposed to believe that the game's entire main quest takes place over the course of one day or if the clock is just broken or what)
---
I've done this a lot. For reference, I regularly get 140+ high rad fluids and 280+ glowing mass / hardened mass from a single nuke on Whitesprings. I do this by running 2 accounts - one idles on the server, the other does the clearing. I clear the whole thing in 10 minutes or less, which is just about the minimum time required to leave game and rejoin and have things respawn.
---
1. Start at Train Station. This might seem backwards to what most people do. You probably think you need to start at the golf club. You don't. Get everything on a respawn timer that matches when YOU are going by the area to respawn things and you'll have no problem with new players that just joined respawning things (and thus putting the respawn on cooldown so you don't get anything). The reason you should start at train station is simple - it's where you spawn in at when you rejoin, assuming you fast travel there after you run the loop, and most importantly, it has a scrapping workbench, a vendor, and a stash, meaning you can sell, scrap, and stash after each run if needed.
---
2. Cross the highway. On your left will be the main building. On your right is a row of houses. Go through the housing area. On the porches / in the streets running parallel to the houses lots of ghouls spawn. Follow this all the way to the golf club. Go inside of the big houses. there are 5-8 spawns inside of each.
---
3. There's a big gap between housing areas right after one of the big houses that has 6+ ghouls in it. You'll see a golf cart back on the golf course parked back there. Ghouls spawn there and also back by the giant hole behind the houses. IF you are running into stuff not respawning because you rejoined the game too quickly (meaning you're clearing the whole place in under 10 minutes and being really efficient), go back there and clear this every time to kill some time and get extra kills. Only do this if you are running through it super fast.
---
4. At end of houses, you'll find golf club. Clear it. Don't forget the couple of spawns that are outside. Especially when they're nuked and bloated glowing ones, they tend to get stuck / wander out there.
---
5. Once you're done with the golf club, look at the front entrance of the club. Turn directly around 180 degrees. You'll see another row of houses, back past the parking lot. Run parallel to the tennis court, and stop by the fountain on your left if you are diseased, then proceed up to the next set of houses. Clear off each porch / grass area in front. Ghouls spawn on each. 
---
6. This will bring you to the front of the Whitesprings main building. Run straight to the brick building outside of the resort - the one that has the washers, dryers, break room, etc. in it. Always 4-5 ghouls in there. 
---
7. Head outside to the parking lot - clear the 5-6 ghouls out there.
---
8. Fast travel to WS train station. Scrap, sell, store. 
---
9. Repeat.
---
It's all right on those kinds of rifles, but I'm not sure how it affects each one's spread individually. Each of the projectiles deals half the total damage, so at longer ranges even when scoped in and standing still the projectiles might spread far enough apart that you deal less damage than a non-legendary one would because only one projectile hits. Then again, idk how each gun works, on a pipe bolt for example it might be pinpoint accurate even with two shot. I haven't ever had one to try
---
Maybe try like the rabbits, foxes, chickens, etc?
---
Try cat, dog, beaver, squirrel, rabbit or chicken.  The last dailies had those as critters.
---
My first nuke launch ended like this. It was a major disappointment.
---
Possum squirrels and deer count. Stuff like that
---
Join recent players.
---
Or be part of a team. 
---
This is a known issue for a lot of players and if you are here you should know about it already.
---
i think a critter is something that doesn‚Äôt automatically attack.  Like cat, chicken, etc.
---
Thanks all
---
Just stating the truth, looks pretty ugly
---
I just wish they'd stop beeeeeepppping after they die.
---
Yeah I do but unfortunately most of the time I'm not able to find a team. Didn't know the recent players thing though
---
Oh man that would be GREAT.
---
You could trade them with a 0 cap. Even though some of them don't know how to trade.
---
Guess I may need to adjust my route then.
---
I used supports for mine. Looks like a house on metal stilts. I hate the floating.
---
At least it's evoking a response lol. Appreciate you taking the time to type this stuff out. If you didn't like it at least a little then you wouldn't comment
---
Congrats! Glad you enjoyed it. Love reading these posts about good experiences.
---
Maybe they were all put on birthcontrol and not told, so that no children would be subjected to the crazy shit that happens?
---
Yeah, especially considering a good deal of MODUS's event quests- such as Dropped Connection- revolve around re-connecting his monitoring network across Appalachia. Stands to reason that after long enough, if enough people felt compelled to join and rebuild the Enclave, they'd work on re-connecting him to the main Enclave communications network and get back in contact with the rest of the organization
---
Yea 25,000
---
I use reactive plates for the xp on my lvl 15 raider armor and haven't noticed much usage from that. The jet pack however you can watch drop like a stone.
---
I was saying you don‚Äôt have to wait longer now compared to before the cap pools were combined. It sounded like you thought the change had something to do with the wait (which isn‚Äôt the case). 
---
If you have more stuff to sell and vendors caps are at zero, why not try selling your stuff in a player vending machine?  If you sell legendary weapons/armor you can usually get much more for a piece than the crappy npc vendors anyway. Put some items in your machine for a couple hundred caps apiece, power up your machines and see what happens. Non-legendaries may not sell as well, but someone might buy rarer items to scrap them &amp; learn mods if the price is right.
---
Can confirm, i completed my challenge by killing a chicken near overseers camp.
---
You‚Äôre welcome üòÇ
---
Not OP but I personally prefer to camp near locations I know IRL. I wanted to camp near the TNT Zone but the game made it so small and so hard to camp near so I'm camping right behind TALA.
---
Lotsa lonely gamers out there. Why not just find a friend who plays around the same times and join up. You don‚Äôt even have to be doing the same things- can just narrate what you‚Äôre up to as you play. 
---
It‚Äôs also useful for disconnects since you have a better chance of rejoining the same server if a friend is still on it
---
How did you fit that much in with the budget ???
---
Take away detail and just show the idea! Most of these buildings are pretty bare inside. I take away unnecessary pieces
---
Ah okay makes sense thank you
---
Ugh
---
No never camped there, never will.
---
I'll be attempting a vid guide on camp building at some point so look out for that
---
I have same issue with Mire, but the Bog it does not see the Cranberry Glade and in Toxic I‚Äôm missed Hemlock Holes.
---
Hell yeah go Steelers

üòâ
---
With every good thing there has to be a bad...
---
When Bethesda fixes their garbage building collision system, I'll build something other than a single foundation staircase build that I know I'll be able to place down. I don't like having to rebuild from scratch every time I move.
---
Because I used to have a camp at the red rocket station near Morgantown Airport when I was low level and had very little plans. Now I‚Äôm level 173 with all plans and much more building experience. I also love red rocket stations so yea.
---
I've been selling them in my vending machines for 1 cap ea. Nobody wants them apparently.
---
I did it: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bxbj2k/inspired_by_another_postheres_my_take_on_a_town/?st=jwk2bmt4&amp;sh=8d33e393

Nice!feels awesome to nuke first time,good job and congrats!
---
That's fantastic! Glad to see another warrior taking on the scourge that is the scorched!
---
Enclave Chapter?
---
Teammates can build at your camp. It uses their resources.
---
You don't need to find a team... Just constantly add people every session. The benefits are far beyond staying on your map.
---
Although the game is exponentially better and more stable than it was on launch, the hate wagon was always exaggerated from the start. People focused on the problems and ignored the massive amount of things that were still fun or that worked properly. And if you got your info from youtubers or gaming """news""" articles, I can guarantee that at least half of it was either clickbait or outright lies
---
If you take the code piece on them it stops. Still annoying though.
---
I have one i dont plan on useing   found it in a player vending
---
Ok, thanks
---
Or chance at serum recipe or chance at serum or fusion cores
---
Same. I love wandering around finding neat spots and making bases.
---
The rumored and leaked content in the near future is also pretty exciting. Save those Atoms for the creation club shenanigans.
---
I would hope Trump wouldn't even be in their Timeline, I also hope he'd be long dead by 2077.
---
Yeah. I never used the player-to-player trade thing, so I didn't cross my mind at that time.
---
Nice,  if they have plans you don't have can they still apply them to your camp?
---
I can do 350 in a single swing. Tons of mutations and the right perks.
---
PA could give an advantage in PVP if the medic pump mod actually worked as intended.  Or they could make emergency protocols reduce incoming damage by 75 percent instead of 50 and it would kick in when you actually needed it.  PA has mods which ought to be helpful in PVP but don't work worth shit. 
---
Also in Fallout 4, paint jobs helped to mitigate damage: explosive shielding was a paint job that reduced damage from explosive.  Explosive shielding stacked with Fireproof perk would make PA a monster in PVP.
---
Most likely you guys are experiencing the start of server shutdown. I usually stay on a loot server for hours (6+ hours) with my alt as a server anchor.  I notice that after about 5 hours, everyone starts to dissapear until just me and my alt are left. Maybe an hour or two later I get the server maintenance clock.  I usually loot like cray cray and jump servers with 30 seconds left .
---
Yeah.
---
What kind of moron would buy that lol.
---
Yes, the only thing you can build for someone else is atomic shop items.
---
It is pretty awesome feeling. I always wanted someone to team up with me in order to do that mission. One time I tried and spent like 100 stimpacks and more than an hour. So I gave up. 
---
I tried again after leveling up a lot and getting some experience. it took me about 90 minutes but I got through by myself. I was very difficult. After that I launched it three times, one time each day. I brought the queen about 5 times in total and the server never defeated it. It becomes super easy if you have a team mate. 
---
One day I teamed up with a friend. He was level 173 and never dropped a nuke. We went in and I thought it was going to be easy. It was quite the opposite he needed experience more than strength. I tried saving him and he tried saving me multiple times. 
---
We ended spawing outside the silo and run through it without having to do the tasks just the fights. He was very happy but till this day he didn't ask to do another one.
---
Tldnr: Nukes are difficult but awesome.
---
I bet he just said.  "welp, another toxic game, guess I'm done here."
---
And then never played again.
---
The only thing a teammate can't build at your camp are atom shop items.
---
Executioner's radium rifle....
---
Very nice.
---
Nice
---
I know but sometimes you can hear the beep echoing for ages before you finally find it dead from a fall or whatever.
---
I came here just to say this
---
‚ÄúRaider Abortion Clinic! ‚ÄòBout to have a cry baby? We‚Äôll help it die, baby!‚Äù
---
I dunno, when a server is shutting down you normally get a countdown in the upper right corner telling you it's going to shut down starting at a half hour. I've been in a dead server for HOURS.
---
I don't think it needs legendary effects. PA would be a monster in PVP if the mods actually worked.  Medic pump torso doesn't stim you fast enough in PVP for one.
---
They could also have explosive shielding paint like in Fallout 4 to reduce damage from explosives. Stack that with fireproof and you might have something viable. 
---
In short, PA doesn't have mods that work worth shit in PVP.
---
If  existing mods worked correctly. they might be viable.
---
Well done!!! I will adopt this as it‚Äôs not very different than mine. All I need to do is start at the train station instead. Nice!
---
&gt;If I'm looking for waste acid (which I am, always)
---
As somebody with hundreds of acid and little use for it, what's the price range where you can't turn it down?
---
Thanks for the writeup. Useful.
---
Awesome! But can I offer you trades instead of caps if I don't have time to grind caps today?
---
They do have somewhere else to go; Adventure Mode
---
Don't forget the faster rate of fire black powder guns. "Oh, you're gonna get all the balls so fast! Just gimme one sec...almost there..."
---
I used to hunt the scorched officers all the time for the nuke codes lol but now i just Google what the launch codes are for the current week lol saves me alot of time
---
Something that needs to change.
---
The statement in question is "cosmetics only".

I'll second this. I use my jetpack all the time and never have a problem eating cores excessively. Short taps work great.

Yes, please!
---
I love when you talk to him after the insult and he says "walk it off"
---
Smart
---
At 5 years old he probably doesn't even understand that the other players are actually real people.
---
Also, he has no concept of a number as high as 100.  Like he knows that 100 is bigger than 5, but that's about it.
---
Idk if this helps, but Sunshine Industrial Meadows workshop can be claimed, and if you connect the terminal to the power box next to it, you can produce sugar bombs without any ingredients. Can hold up to 4, makes something like 20/hr.
---
We can figure it out tomorrow.
---
I would use this mutation
---

---
What did you think they used for meat in the stew?
---
Teammates can also build at Workshops.
---
I only use VATS to locate targets usually. I would use it too!
---
So, Carnivore does not give you twice the buff effects?
---
Hell yeah that would be cool too
---
I saw someone offer these services the other day, and it seems like a cool idea for people that aren't into building themselves. Plus it gives people that do like to build an outlet other than constantly moving camps or making alts.
---
I'd be happy enough if they just evened out the bricks so they don't stick through posters and other wall decoration.
---
If it takes me longer than 5 seconds to find someone's vendor, I just fast travel out, not gonna explore your entire C.A.M.P to find it.
---
Huh, I never gave them much thought, but I am o ly using 3 / 4 vendors... Guess I'm opening a cliffside candy store soon
---
More camp budget is something we need especially since the new player vendors so we can show off our creativity and originality to the other players to inspire them or just show them what u can actually do

I spent an entire day acquiring .50 cal ammo, running four workshops simultaneously for lead, steel, acid, etc, and let me tell you that having two workshops hit simultaneously by three scorchbeasts each isn't much fun. Certainly not worth the 3000 rounds I was able to produce with an entire day's session. 
---
However, when one of those workshops was hit with four waves of Anglers, which I am able to one-shot kill with my DC gauntlet, and I was swimming in loot from just those dudes. Musta killed 50 of em. 
---
Note: during this time I managed to make 30+ fusion cores in one workshop, which lasted a WHOLE lot longer in an SBQ fight.
---
Hmmm... maybe.
---
OR
---
You can do 6k-10k+ per hit repeatedly, One-Shot everything, and ascend to Valhalla every 45 seconds because you constantly die a hero's death in battle!

---
Very low chance I've seen maybe 5 legendaries after 50 or so server hops I'm mostly farming it for meat and take the legendaries as a bonus, I've set up turrets to kill them for me but often they don't drop anything, gonna try moving the turrets back a bit and placing punji boards/rad emitters/tesla arcs see if that helps
---
Did they change something? 
---
We had a level 3 attack us when survival mode came out and he couldn't deal damage to us and we couldn't deal damage to him, then we looked it up and it said PVP wasn't enabled until level 5, even on survival...?
---
What would u charge for laser / high end turrets around my Camp? I'm still rocking level 4 mgs :(
---
He knows lots about meat too!
---
Well, they will, but with two caveats: you have to survive long enough for them to register that you, the owner, are under attack; and, most importantly, turrets are complete bupkis against other players. So, getting one-shotted completely screws with the turret AI, but it doesn't matter because the damage they do to non-NPCs is utterly fucking worthless.
---
Yeah, I personally don't use VATS very often and have to remind myself to use it. I find the combat to be more satisfying using manual aim.
---
War, war never changes.
---
You just supply some of the needs parts and I‚Äôll be happy to help
---
No, not just you.
---
Then again, I can't be arsed to drop them in, as they don't have anything decent in them.  Hopefully they start putting good stuff in.
---
actually cleared all of my junk to make space for shop items, hence you supply the junk, Can ya post any pics of shops ya made?

Great! I should have All the materials. Can I add u to psn?

Would it work w melee too or just guns?

i've noticed this forever in fallout 76 and more recently have noticed that tons of 95% shot miss like way more than what was normal in the past sometimes 3 or 4 in a row.
---
Psn anthonybundy71 I‚Äôll be in after 2 pm Melbourne Australia time
---
I meant 200+ to the player. I don't know the rough HP you'd have at 1/2 END, but I said 200 as a conservative estimate. I don't care for survival but I know that PvP in this game has some kind of damage scaling based on level, so low level players don't get immediately destroyed. I remember all the posts complaining about low levels being able to wipe out lvl 200s in x-01 due to this scaling
---
Are you on PC?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true but I‚Äôd like a little more style, a blood washed note would do the trick. (Also letters take up sooo much budget)
---
No m8 ps4
---
Do you mean the one with the terminal that controls things? I found that. But I don't know why people put it there in the first place.
---
I'm so confused. They need the meat just for a stew?
---
I was imagining for melee as well but maybe that would be too generous as there isn't often much need for VATS in melee.
---
damn, well thnx for the offer.
---
If I got a 20% dmg buff I‚Äôd be doing over 5k dmg a hitüòÇ
---
Some players are new and would still like to participate and be part of the world , while getting a few extra caps. Don‚Äôt discourage them or the game will die. Thanks!
---
No worries
---
I'm hoping for an automatron like dlc/update that you can customize  a personal robot and set to tend your camp, auto gather crops, auto gather water, repair structures and defend against critters or take on your voyage as a companion.
---
Can ya post a few pics?
---
Cool I'm in Brisbane so it shouldn't be too hard to catch up with you!
---
What's another 500 damage or so when you are already in the 4000s? It's crazy to me that people get their damage that high.
---
using ultracite? just wait till you find out that t-51b is actually better than ultracite for ballistic and energy defence and X-01 is better for rad defence... ultracite sucks, and it's hard to find good mods for it along with no jet pack if you wanted to use it.
---
well then dont buy anything?

No pics you just have to have a look at my camp

üëç
---
Fair enoughüòÇ unyielding armor, serums, perks, and aid all have to be perfect I could probably do a bit more but I‚Äôve only got lv 3 adrenaline
---
That doesnt help i spent caps just to travel to the camp
---
That sounds neat, but what happens when only one of you logs in?
---
Hate to break it to you bud, but Vending machines weren't made to cater to you. They are so everyone and anyone can sell whatever they want at whatever price they want. 
---
If you don't need those items someone else will. Your'e not the only player bud. Some vendors will cater to lower levels and some for higher. 
---
Quite frankly, some players don't have high end gear for themselves, let alone to sell.
---
What should be changed is the manner in which items are displayed prior to you traveling there, make it so it gives better idea of what to expect.
---
At that level I imagine only boss level creatures could stand many hits, do you feel it needs nerfing or are you happy with it?
---
Request sent mate.
---
Doh!  My bad, thought you where asking why to Mama Dolce's . . . 
---
Sorry
---
Ok I‚Äôll accept when I log in üëå
---
nah, gives people more of a reason to buy player brewed serums.
---
if the cost of FTing around the map is giving you issues.. you might not have enough caps to be shopping in the first place...
---
Pretty much I think it‚Äôs insane dmg but it‚Äôs kinda balanced bc of how much hp you have to give up to get to that w out my armor serendipity and dodgy I would be one shot to most strong things
---
So who'd fault is that? Maybe the person who clicked the yes button to travel there.....

I thought this happened to me for the first time today..

then I found the corpse under a bush...

I just used the playstation app on my phone . I'm at work at the moment but I'll be on tonight.

You're able to place them on top of/below one another until they reach the ground.

I actually was at the start of looting one the bodies only for it to fall through the world..
---
Sup
---
I can honestly tell you that if you go run the event in Watoga you can get 200 fairly easily. It's a bunch of ghouls though so have a ton of ammo or get a good melee weapon
---
Well said! Some people don't consider anyone else but themselves. It's all me me me me! 
---
I find even if i don't need it, if price is good, I'll buy it anyway just to pass on some caps. I'll end up using it eventually and the seller will definitely appreciate the extra currency.
---
I sell them for one cap a pop in my vendor. Cant keep it stocked.
---
Wonderful!!
---
I can definitely do this for you, lemme get some pics for you. Could we talk in pms?
---
for sure
---
Even better is an executioner gamma gun... No one builds rad resist no one..
---
That's ok. I usually trade with friends so if there is another player I do safe trade. If not I just drop them.
---
I kill the sentrybots in WS for cores.
---
Forest event Leader of the Pack is your best bet.
---
Rust.
---
...entitled comes to mind
---
I use both. Jetpacked x-01 and furious severe beta gatling laser/melee build. Without those two perks, there's no way I could feed my fusion core addiction. But with them, I only have to farm fusion cores maybe once a week or week and a half.
---
&gt; they weigh to much
---
with the right perks you can carry 50 of em and not even notice.
---
Chems count as well so maybe a stimpack or something?
---
Ha! Not sure about this whole sacrifice thing you got going on, but definitely would love to be able to leave notes. 
---
So much potential for role playing like in your case. Or simply leave some advice to newbies..
---
Maybe even leave contact info for haggling on prices?
---
On Xbox if you join someone's game via profile when you load in weight reduction legendary effects don't work properly.
---
You won't have the overencumbered status but your weight will be something like 1000/510, running won't consume AP like true encumbrance but you cannot sprint. It's also a ~50/50 chance whether or not you can fast travel. 
---
It makes rejoining and contributing to SBQ or other content from a recent players profile a real struggle.
---
Awesome! You wouldn't know what platform they are playing on would you ...oh, i guess it's whatever YOU are on ...which would be ...? ....(please say PC, please say PC, please say PC, please say PC)
---
Its just your camp I guess. They would really just need to make it so you could build closer to eachother like if you could put the edge of each build space a foot apart. Then instead of it being one camp I guess it would still be two just closer so you could build towns with friends or people could make raider/BOS blockades and such.
---
my 3* Furious exploding the dragon shoots 9 times before it breaks, and that's when repaired to 200%. 
---
It does 800 base damage though, so I keep it around for behemoths and sbqs.
---
Sorry, beyond that I don‚Äôt know much. Guess it was a lark
---
Robots. I‚Äôm hoping they give us robots.
---
I would love to do this but I unfortunately don't own a mic for my Xbox. Would that be a problem?
---
...self centered...
---
Thats fine, but they should stick to aid items and ammo not weapons and armor
---
It looks really good.
---
Rubber, plastic, and cloth. I use them to craft Halloween costumes which sell to robovendors for almost 50 caps each.
---
Yeah assaultrons seem to just not give a damn about walls either..or very high armor.. üôÉ
---
If you find one stomp on the ground it sounds awesome
---
Same here, the weight restriction to 1,500 weight plus your carry weight would limit anything they may be carrying worth anything. It literally makes you delete everything over that weight limit(doesn‚Äôt even let you use the items or drop/trade them) so that update has already happened which would ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem (solving the issue and lifting the temporary bans). Smh...
---
I missed that whole event. Sounds like it was good.
---
I‚Äôd like a vendor robot with a choice of personalities. You could go with sweet like the hot dog lady in Camden park or one with the insult bot chip for instance.

Uh...rng? Sorry idk what that stands for

should be unless it was survival rules

survival?
---
I'm not sure what's got you all bent out of shape. 
---
It was a legit question. I'm fairly certain I've seen others in threads about the camera say it no longer spawns on the quest related Ansel body if you have looted it previously and you then need to find it as a random drop...
---
I asked because I've seen other people say so, but haven't seen him since I first got the camera.... I don't get how that's rude...
---
I legit don't get why you got all uppity there. It was a legit question. Not a rhetorical one....
---
And I wasn't saying it's gone if someone else loots it. I'm saying if I have looted it previously, as it's a quest related spawn, it won't spawn on the tourist again, which is what others have said.... But I didn't know personally.
---
I want some of the Pack outfits :)
---
Oh constantly.  I do feel your pain.  üò°
---
Glad there‚Äôs some one that finds it funny.
---
That's exactly what I did!
---
I've been a high health build for a long time and haven't had too many damage output problems. Stick to sneak attacks. Get crit multipliers. Most of all enjoy being able to take a few hits. Who cares if you have to shoot a few extra rounds.
---
We get overcharged plasma cores depending on INT when crafting them. I'd like to see something similar for crafted fusion cores, or at least fusion cores that don't require stable flux.
---
Do you realize how *insane* that would be with high rate of fire heavy weapons? Right now, no one uses 50 cals or gatlings or miniguns in VATS because the AP cost is ridiculous and VATS crits aren't really what those guns are about, so if you gave those weapons a way to crit regularly AND boosted damage by a flat 20% you'd basically trivialize a shit ton of game content.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Why not give them a 60% chance of the standard loot a 20% chance of a 1* a 15% chance of a 2* and a 5% chance of a 3 * legendary or something like that
---

Last week finally farmed up the  Hunters Long Coat. Noticed when I enter Power Armor and get out or it can happen randomly when I do anything that changes my appearance (chameleon) and the coat becomes partially see through. Sometimes I can reset the appearance back to normal by changing clothes, but mostly that only works once and then I am stuck with the see through version of the coat.
---
 My foot is huge as it bursts out of part of the boot, and can be compared to what it should look like in the supplied pictures:

Okay if we‚Äôre being honest he won‚Äôt be 5 until January but somehow 5 feels better than 4... 4.5. 
---
So like, he‚Äôs starving and dehydrated and has zero ammo and zero concept of what to do (he just got on board with Minecraft like, a couple weeks ago so he‚Äôs fresh out the gamin‚Äô womb!)... all that is to say that I was honestly expecting some backlash about this and I am just way beyond relieved that there are othersssss!! 
---
Anyway, I can‚Äôt wait til my kids are giving me pointers, man!
---
would be sweet if you could build those side by side.. then it would really start feeling like a town...
---
It's about the concept not the specific values, I just through that out there as discussion starter. Do you think less overall buff and no crits would work or you don't like the idea in general?
---
I want the pack handmade paint
---
I used an assaultron sword on a ghoul and got it no problem.
---
You know it‚Äôs so stupid because I‚Äôm just watching this very patient level 105 fellow standing there while my kid runs around like a lunatic and it‚Äôs embarrassing? I guess that‚Äôs what even prompted me to write this silly PSA. Our friend pulls out this fiery-looking weapon I‚Äôm not familiar with and continues just standing there, bless him.
---
Maybe a good idea would be to factor in DPS in the buff so high fire rate weapons don't break it?
---
Corn! Everywhere is corn!

I was posting about this just a couple months after release in various threads where people were discussing possible future dlc. Was downvoted to oblivion everytime saying it just couldn't work with this game. 
---
You people.

Yeah that would be helpful. There‚Äôs an altar made of skulls and bones in my camps basement lol.
---
I didn't catch that. I drank some vodka and cooked a mile eat. I mean mole rat.
---
To be honest I wouldn't put charisma higher than 6,this allows you to use line wanderer 3, suppressor 1 and tenderizer 1. Put the extra 2 points to max agility and 1 more into luck for grim reapers sprint.
---
Why? It's their vending machine. Besides, lower levels need gear to. Plenty of lower levels looking for gear, who can't afford higher end gear or simply aren't at that level yet. 
---
Just because it's not something you need, doesn't give you the right to exclude them from sales. If you don't need it, someone else will.
---
Platform and other stars? 
---
It needed to be asked.
---
&gt; I didn‚Äôt think many people placed their camps in that spot until I tried to join the other night multiple times and kept getting a message saying that my camp can‚Äôt be placed so I had to jump servers a few times.
---
I have a pretty unique spot and my camp is blueprinted, so I sometimes will load in on servers where I get this message, just to see what others have done with the location. 
---
Most often it's due to a fuckin radstag stuck on a treestump.
---
Does anti armor work for energy weapons?
---
Hahaha poor pupper. That‚Äôs one area we‚Äôve lucked out as parents - the bit of game violence we‚Äôve allowed exposure to hasn‚Äôt seeped into pretend play. Yet. Unless you count make believe zombies.

Survival ain't a place for kids, if they are in, they ain't kids, so they will die, and there is no sorry for that.
---
They do in FO3 as well. Particularly in Vault 87.
---
Believe it is still bugged.
---
I have this same problem as a Concentrated Fire stealth sniper build, with either the lever-action rifle or the combat rifle. For me, the VATS misses gets very apparent especially during and after joining a populated event like the SBQ.
---
I've found a "workaround" though. The other day, I saw a marsupial that kept jumping and shooting. I mimicked him, and as long as you shoot while you're in the air, the 95% chance stays true and tends to hit. Maybe it is just a positioning sync issue, where VATS lets you target an enemy at 95%, but somehow your lagged position is displaced and has some obstruction that causes your shot to miss or get blocked?
---
There has to be something in his inventory that is making him fat.
---
Don‚Äôt forget missiles have weight in FO76, unlike it‚Äôs predecessors!
---
Id be fine changing that, but then we all still have the issue of low level legendary items and outfits that are not rare. These other things people should be selling to vendors, I agree with you there, but we need a level and legendary count as well as hours played maybe even, so we can gauge their hauls
---
That's how you pick out the fake story
---
Has he scrapped his junk? How many guns does he have? Is he logging in with power armor? How much does he have in his stash?
---
Everytime I see extravagant bases I wonder how they fit so much with so little budget. I can't build one 5x5 garage with 10 turrets surrounding it without hitting close to the cap. It's the turrets isn't it?
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah...but I see the reason why. They want to make sure camps don't ever overlap on each other and make a mess.
---
That's annoying especially with the neon lights.
---
Another thing that bothers me is the invisible ramp for foundations. Enemies can walk up to my my walls and barriers that have the base of them being head high. Once there, they begin to attack it until it breaks.
---
What? Wish you had some?
---
200 damage with a single swing is nothing with the right perk cards and weapon. My question is I thought the other guy would be immune from damage until he fought back.
---
Which stat is this under?
---
You purposefully tried to kill him though. How do you do damage to a player when they removed all slap damage in the last patch?
---
Gunpowder in misc?
---
I had a few similar experiences in the whitesprings decided to go there to farm a few legendaries and after killing a few they just simply disappeared after hitting the ground
---
Lol, you don‚Äôt... uh... hang around kids very much do you? ü§£
---
The servers have been really unstable. We did arktos a few times tonight, had all 3 alive waiting for the alpha and server crashed. It happened 3 different runs, had a few diffuser runs that made it but it sucks to have the skills to pull it off and it bugs out. I dunno what's going on but we had enough for tonight.
---
This does not work with magazines. They have a value of 0 so you can‚Äôt sell them to a vendor. Just tried it.
---
I have plenty of caps, my issue is wasting 10000+ traveling to shop over the last couple days
---
So youre saying its pretty much useless to have furious on a melee build since you kill everyone in 2-3 hits anyway right? that would only ever stack to 10%
---
See, now you're talking! It's not the players fault. Lower levels (or any level) should be able to sell what they please. Trying to exclude them isn't the right way to do it.
---
This is more of a broken game mechanic, or simply one that requires a little more development. Adding those features would go a long way. 
---
A few others i thought of just now
---
-Perhaps adding a custom note section limited to 20 characters or w/e. That allows you to add something visible when selecting camp.
---
-Have a dedicated slot for you to assign your prized item and it be visible when selecting camp before you fast travel.
---
nope man‚Äôs immortal, lived for 130 years and then became a ghoul with a MAGA hat
---
If you turned him off of the game you did him a favor.
---
I really like how most train station sinks have a little something to snag, it‚Äôs great at low levels
---
Not in survival only adventure
---
They are good for calling a cargobot so you can take a picture of it for that possum badge, nothing else
---
I think this is hands down the best fallout game. Most people would probably disagree with that, but for me personally right from fallout 1 the biggest draw has always been freedom, exploration and character progression. I think fallout 76 does this best and it's only getting better as more is added to the game. Loving it!
---
No gunpowder
---
Have 3 of those creatures , Son is 11 and wants to play fo76 , but we are not english speaking and im worried cause he does not understand almost any  english . But after reading this it may not be so bad to get an extra mule account üòÇ
---
I've checked and he's only carrying about 200 pounds of stuff.
---
Sheepsquatsh ecent in Savage Divide. Wolves always there when I do it.
---
Why are you calling me out like this man?
---
I don't even use an explosive weapon and an enemy was healing himself through my Gatling gun pumping damage out. Just a fat ghoul with no stars.
---
He's emptied everything out and he's still to heavy.
---
Love this idea
---
Just encountered the same issue here. Disappointing, hopefully the bug will be fixed soon
---
Right? That gives them way too much notice and they can just log off the server to avoid damage. 
---
The best way to avoid this is to use orbital strike beacons on peoples' camps. 5 seconds notice if you're lucky, and only if you're paying attention at your camp. 
---
please note: I only use these on camps that have kill rooms when you fast travel to them. they can have fun using my dropped loot fixing their camps.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ you‚Äôre trash dude just get good and quit bitchin
---
I'm glad you agree
---
I tried killing a guy who was fresh out of the vault. I thought the system protected them.
---
Should be under Intelligence it's an Energy Ammo weight reduction perk.
---
Idk really but this sounds ok to me!! It reminds me of my one peaceful meeting in survival.. someone found me and waved. I shit my vault suit pointed my gun and left the area ready to tap that trigger lol!!
---
If your camp was going to be destroyed by the nuke i don't think it will load your camp if you connect to the server. Or am I misinformed?
---
that might be the best pic ive ever seen anyone take in this game graphics wise. This pic makes this game look gorgeous, at least everything except those black balconies that seem to be a different resolution than the building theyre attached to
---

Hahahahaha
---
Place it a few different directions?
---
Mate, I can drop it as a sheer vertical cliff face, as HIGH as possible to make a foundation. Walk straight up it as though t‚Äôwas the gentlest incline rather than a sheer brick wall
---
Been screwed up like this for several weeks
---
Hey... Tough shit, mate
---
Berkeley Springs can be fun.
---
I‚Äôd love to even write little notes at other peoples camp I visit
---
My pet Behemoth, Dave, has killed four scorchbeasts at my camp so far. He's a good frigging pet.
---
The mailbox may be what you‚Äôre looking for, it‚Äôs in the utility section for datamined files.
---
for 3 starts it really depends on what your selling
---
Um been screwed up since BETA üòë
---
Hey, remember all the jokes before launch that people would just be constantly nuking you as soon as you left the vault? About that...
---
I had those damn missiles forever before I realized. There has to be something holding him down I bet. Maybe one thing you are scrolling over lol
---
SBQ drop is based on how much damage you dealt FYI - if you don't hit the threshold she won't drop nothing for you. As for legendaries just vanishing... far too often - extremely annoying.
---
This is where I bought the mod a couple of times. Haven't been there lately though.
---
As someone with several railway rifles.. Please tell me more. I haven't heard of this bug before.
---
Dang. What if you sell it to a player and then buy it back?
---
Yep me too with the queen today and I definitely know i tapped it good before it died and bingo Nothing. Hope they fix that cus thats a biggie if so much ammo gets used up of course
---
I play on ps4 and tbh im  jus ok at fps pvp!! I love this game and I do rely on  my chameleon armor to keep me safe and alive and killin and winnin!! So I cant take any real credit as I, like any smart player knows to use all the mutations and dope ass legendary armor and weapons and maxed perks to get all the edge they can. But I trusted some reg weapons and on ppl and yes you can get a wrecked fast still.. I may ditch some of my legendary armor soon and see how I can do as pure skill based but. I have been tryin to unlock all the perks for higher damage resistance and see how that helps and I'm running the armor plated backpack and scaly skin for even more damage resistance(some ppl can still 1shot me or insta kill me so nothing awesome to report yet)!
---
Hahaha
---
Had one on mine. Took it off, same reason it messes with range.
---
Diluted Radaway would probably be the only culprit, maybe lingering from playing last night? 
---
Hadn't thought of that, but your very likely spot on.
---
I believe that doesn‚Äôt work either.
---
That's the same stats on mine. Maybe dupes =}
---
Yea i did it several times (that time limit is cruel).
---
So my question is how to Maximize the tokens gain?  
---
some times i get 14 and other time 30 (does more players mean more tokens? also it says "Harvest the mine for minerals and scrap" So do i get more tokens if i manually harvest too?
---
and also all the 4 choises do give you minerals ((concrete, aluminium, copper, etc.) maybe from 8 to 20 each)).
---
Well..... I've been keeping them since I began the game, but that wasn't my intention to wait for a better future for them. But now that I see, this idea is actually cool, I mean, these holotapes take alot of time and they give nothing in reward.
---
...I DON'T WANT TO LAUGH BUT I DID, DAMN IT
---
We are also in another server that is joint faction, there‚Äôs a few different enclave, BoS, cultists and raider discord groups represented there üí™ I can send you a link to that if you‚Äôd like to join that and represent your enclave chapter?
---
Happens a lot for me, hell lately i've been using melee instead of guns because of that and i have 5 str
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don't really see this being that big of an issue. Make a max size, and moldable within that size.
---
Mine is the legendary that says, Retreat! Run away! Run away! But I haven't seen any for a couple of patches. Hope they bring him back. I chased that legendary all over Wes-Tec.
---
Two shot and explosive effects are already counted in the number you see i have confirmed by having a regular, two shot, explosive and tse of the same gun
---
https://www.a90skid.com/the-fallout-76-connection-failed-bug-and-how-to-fix-it/
---
I hope you can get this resolved - this article has all of my suggestions.
---
Nope! Not a problem with us, it is preferred but you can always type in the appropriate channel to talk if you don‚Äôt have a mic DM me and I‚Äôll send you a link?
---
Ok thanks, this is  the best answer I could have asked for
---
these count as unarmed weapons not melee.  like you can't use them in power armor either
---
Effects that dont show are only mutants +10% damage
---
Damn and a bonus tip. Thanks!
---
Frag grenades.
---
Yeah. I haven't done pharma yet. Would love to do it sometime. You on xbox?

11100000000000000000000000000 MILLION CAPS
---
I wish the map gave a little more information, how many legendary items, as an example, but I  FT around all the damned time and I still have more caps than I know what to do with, AND I've scored some sweet deals.
---
And a haunted house where you burn them up
---
This sounds horrible and if it were me I'd be super angry, but all the confused and angry emotes gave me a good laugh. Hope your next battle is better tho!
---
Have you tried exercise?  I've heard of Beer Bellies, never Keg Bellies.
---
My daughter is a Daddy's girl. She's been sitting on his lap while he's played games for almost a decade now.
---
He wouldn't play violent games until she was asleep for a long time. She's caught him more recently when she's popped back awake during fallout etc. She had questions when husband had 3* bloody mess equipped.. she asked why he killed that enemy, he told her because it hurt other people.. she asked why it sprayed everywhere and he said because when he kills a monster it gets to turn into Jello and have a yummy jiggly life.
---
Fwiw, she knew he was messing around, told him it was all fake like movies, and he'd better not lie about jello again.
---
Thank you much!
---
Strength 1 or higher?
---
Is he still orange though
---
It has been happening for days for me, especially around places with a lot of enemies. I have to kill enemies and immediately loot them before killing anything else incase the body disappears.
---
We're on pc
---
How is this comment helpful? You're bragging that you have more caps than you know what to do with as a reply to someone that's having a hard time and losing caps.
---
Dont listen to this person, they dont speak for everyone. 
---
Vats and heavy weapons don't mix well, that is true. However, I main a heavy gunner and use vats to help locate smaller creatures and occasionally kill them. Things like bugs, rabbits, etc. I never get do use crits though, and it kinda sucks. 
---
Not saying I don't do enough damage, I do plenty. So I'd say a flat 20% damage buff would be a bit high. Perhaps a boost to accuracy while aiming down sights instead. Adding the ability to crit a random shot based off of luck would be nice, but it would need to be a lower chance, even with high luck. Maybe something like 2% per 3 points in luck. 
---
Then there's the draw backs, idk about removing vats entirely. Perhaps  just removing the ability to attack with it, while still being able to have it highlight creatures. Once you fire however it deactivates. That way it doesnt hinder your ability to attack but doesnt give you the benefit of aim assist. And a reduction in hip fire accuracy to compensate for the ads accuracy boost.
---
I do it because it's easy to defend. I'm in an area with quite a lot of enemies. My floating fortress keeps me safe. Before when I was a grounder, enemies kept spawning inside my base and destroying stuff. that was before player vending, with the amount of foot traffic through my base, I would be repairing more than selling.
---
White springs parking lot. Go in there and there is tons on the toilet.
---
It would actually probably be easier since there's player vending and you wouldn't have to grind so much. But yes a ton has changed in the game. It's worth giving a try if you've already bought it.
---
Or blood...
---
What kind of new things have they added?
---
YES! I with I could upvote this 1,000 times.
---
Check aid..believe it or not..i found ALOT of extra weight in there. Glowing blood will sneak up on be before i know it and salt and pepper...i was picking them up..anyway might check aid.
---
Yeah was gonna say.. Maybe he should pop addictol and desease cures
---
Player vending is probably one of the biggest changes to the game. Various bug fixes and stability fixes. Various DLC. New game mode called "survival". It's basically a PvP server. Umm...I'm sure there's things I'm missing. I've been playing since BETA and I love this game.
---
Oh and new vendors. There's a legendary vendor now along with traveling vendors who have special merch on them.
---
Maybe there already is model for hooded one. Because one i bought is called "somethin something 2" so there must be something something 1 :D
---
Before I saw survival I thought you were bullshitting about this in adventure. But f to that kid and f to u
---
I just started the game (actually STARTED it. I played it once before for about an hour and peaced out) and didn‚Äôt know you could ‚Äústeal‚Äù from people. I assumed anything planted outside was okay to take. I was level 2 and died after I became wanted. The wasteland is very unkind
---
No.
---
Would it depend on the gun or the stats? Or both?
---
a little bit of both like if you have a 3 star pipe rifle your not gonna get much for it but if you have 3 star gauss rifle it can be worth a lot
---
What's really fun is when you get stuck UNDER the invisiramp :'&gt;
---
Going melee in pvp is a death sentence.
---
What if someone builds a wall around a building?
---
Ooooooooooope, Ohioan here too.
---
Not so true, i had fight with level 8 when i was level 200. I killed him in one shot from instagasting hunting rifle, he then killed me with two shots from pump shotty. This happened on survival few week after its release.
---
Btw: he died for science and when he killed me, he got 400 caps, so it is ok i guess :D
---
Yes, both of those, and it can't compete with sentinel.
---
You will eventually get a different server I just don't think there's that many of them that's why you keep going back to the same one I've noticed the same thing
---
Outside Huntersville at the BOS graveyard. I've always seem them spawn there.
---
If you can remember their name you should add them
---
Nope I have them for my ultracite power armor and they don't do anything when I land from high places
---
Sorry, xbox.
---
Survival server. There is no protection for anyone. You get out vault, you meet guy, you ded.
---
Oh that explains it
---
They don‚Äôt work.
---
I assume it‚Äôs because the queen can get outside the boundaries of the game but cannot get back into it. 
---
Just like if find your way outside some of the boundaries in some of bethesda‚Äôs other titles then having to reload a save because you fell out of the world and the game doesn‚Äôt reset you to your last known location.
---
They are worth doing until level 20 lol. It is just waste of time to travel to radio and then to box. Why would i need pre-war money and tomahawks? If this was support for army, america should be so happy whole planet was nuked, becouse they would lose so bad.
---
Bethesda wants us to ft around and waste caps. It's working as intended. You could walk for free. My machines are full of mid lvl gear for mid lvl players at decent prices, and I sell a lot of it. players who are between lvl 20-45 are vastly under served imho. I wish I could mark my camp as a low/mid lvl vender just so I wouldn't have to hear all the salty Meta-gear seeking mouth breathers whine when they look in my machines.
---
Yep. Only really worthwhile on high rate of fire / low damage weapons. LMG, minigun, 10mm submachine and such.
---
I typically start playing at 2am EST, so the servers are usually just starting to empty when I get on. 
---
This means when Uranium Fever comes up I'm usually running solo and can one-shot everyone to my heart's content. 
---
Most of the players I run into have been pretty decent, with lots of ammo sharing, teaming up, cheap sales.. I donno if it's because us night-shifters are just more laid back than our daywalking counterparts, but I haven't seen much selfishness at all, and certainly not more in recent days.
---
I am overstocked of legendaries on my main. But i would love if you could get 400rounds of  random ammo from each supply drop + some chems. Like when you are in fucking war surrounded, you don't need tomahawk, you need ammo, and healing, that is what supply cargobots should be for!
---
I guess they thought that survival in FO76 would be like survival in FO4 ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yas, the ghoul mask is finally in game!
---
The real r/jesuschristreddit is in the comments.
---
That's rather depressing. I was really hoping it to be the problem on my end. Guess people really don't like survival mode :(
---
I think the ramp thing might actually be deliberate.  I think it's deliberate so that enemies can't be locked out of attacking your structures if you place the foundations high enough.  Wouldn't mind being wrong, but I figured Bethesda must have added some things to allow the AI of enemies to be capable of attacking your structures in most cases.
---
I've done a bit of modding (and I need to get back some of the projects that need updates or sit unfinished) but that background has given me enough of a framework to have a basic understanding atleast some of the time.  
---
That said, again it takes the community pointing it the issues, without that one person can't see all the problems, so allot of the credit goes back to the people helping by giving me detail info.
---
*shrug*   
---
Time will tell, but they did end up fixing the issue with my Power Armor Edition in part because of this, so that's something!    
---
(Don't ask, was a giant mess, lol)
---
Yeah it's happened to me a few times now. Not sure how or why it's triggered at this point. To me it seemed like system was taking to long to update true inventory. So when i was trying to buy the item, it actually no longer existed. I was seeing 4 items when seller was only showing 2 items for sale. 
---
I'm wondering if the seller maybe repaired something which used up some of the screws in stash and some were assigned to vendor. Causing it to error out when you tried to purchase.
---
So what you‚Äôre are saying is that I should nuke Huntersville?
---
I understand you emptied his inventory and he was still too heavy. 
---
Is there a chance you didn't do gun powder and/or ore? I keep forgetting about them since it's under misc and unusually heavy.
---
Good opportunities to see how other players choose to live, though - that experience is truly priceless
---
I only team up with people with mics. Seems like if you can spend a minute talking to someone, they're more likely to not be dickbags if you team up with them. 
---
There's one dude I play with occasionally who communicates almost solely through bonghits on his mic. He dropped me a full x-01 jetpack/quantum and a serum for like 1000 caps. And guarded my lootbag when I went down. If bonghit man is capable of humanity, surely everyone else can if they try.
---
It took me a bit to figure this out, but here you go. Try buying them in smaller quantities. The game freaks out when it things that you are buying too many of the same item at once. I was trying to buy over 1,000 rounds of .45 at once and ran into this problem. but I tried buying 200 and it worked. so I did multiple transactions of 200 with no problems. Hope this works for you.

Killing the bots at whitespring works well in a pinch. They drop cores that usually have at least 75/100 charge, and it only takes a few minutes to do the entire resort inside and out.
---
Oh that all sounds awesome. I‚Äôm redownloading it now
---
Hey I read your post..But my friends and I still do not understand how to get the quest/event started for the Robco Engineer. We went to Robco Research Center and nothing started for us. So how exaclty do you start the event or quest?? Is it a scheduled event/quest? 
---
Thanks for the detailed info!!
---
You could have just Googled it or searched reddit:
---
it very much depends on what it is.
---
a 3* nocturnal wood leg with garbage stars is not worth much.
---
a 2* bloodied power fist with vampire and +ap is worth a lot
---
Well, I'll buy it off you if you want. For quite a bit more than it's worth. :) Hit me up on here tomorrow afternoon, it's after 1am here and I need to be getting to bed now.
---
Good catch.    
---
The Purveyor is the exception to the rule, "her" leveled list is set to roll close to best the majority of the time, hence the Heavy Armor by default.  
---
I'll always take more data, at this point I've been focusing on the 2* and especially 3*'s because that's where some of the truely odd patterns form.  
---
Now I base it off my [trades list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1W4imr77PGwM_d5l8KzQJP6KnI5t8PfwZf0kI_nzT5Ao/htmlview#), and the patterns there.  
---
I've recently cut about 1,000 2*+ Legendaries from Weapons and Armor, and you can still see patterns, especially on the weapons, if you browse it.
---
But then I'd have to report to someone... ;).    
---
All joking aside, thanks for the vote of confidence.
---
Thanks for the comment, especially the pictures.   
---
That is... Bizarre....   
---
What platform?   
---
What Armor (primary effects) and Mutations?     
---
Want to try and replicate this!
---
Could be. That is a picture of the one I saw in a player vendor's shop, but the reason I stopped to look at it and noticed the bayonet is that I have one exactly like that too (just without the bayonet) that I got from the Purveyor. At least I know mine's legit. I would rather have a Bloodied variant instead of two-shot. Two-shot messes with your accuracy and can't put out the sheer amount of damage that Bloodied can.
---
Did this start up in the last couple patches?
---
Harpers ferry vendor bot
---
Anything from 1400 to 1800
---
I don't get to have any pets, turrets, or crops :( hardly any indoor decorations either. It's worth it though
---
they just need to get the building system from fallout 4 into this game. it is so much easier.
---
I‚Äôm sure he will get over it and you will, too.  But it‚Äôs nice that you‚Äôre thoughtful enough to share your guilt. Hope you‚Äôre enjoying the game.
---
So say we all.
---
Do you know any 5 year olds? You are WAY underestimating their abilities. My son can count to 100 and for sure knows other characters are real people when he plays (so does my 3 year old). He always wants to join up and be friends with literally everybody he sees.
---
I meant from armor drops, I haven't bought any from the purveyor because of the wood armor issues. Since I started keeping track of it a bit late, all I have are five 3* ranged weapons from her
---
I would say 10 or 15% seeing‚Äôs as how if you have a bloodied melee build you can deal like 3100 damage with a meat hook lol
---
Had a similar experience earlier. Captured a workshop area to farm some junk and got attacked by someone in the 100s. Then they claimed the shop and did nothing with it really sucked.
---
Thats my issue too. Bought a BE handmade just to lose some caps (but got a great deal)
---
30min later I‚Äôm back at max caps again and having to lock my vending machines behind solid walls. 
---
Due to limited caps storage, looks like I‚Äôm going to have to dump stock just to play.
---
Just visited The Floophouse http://imgur.com/a/tQMwukw
---
Great job u/flooping_pigs
---
I‚Äôm one of those people as I‚Äôm not into camp building at all, so Whitesprings is my home.  I‚Äôd love a Legendary vending machine there!
---
I call em out when I'm looting whitespring. If I come across a legendary I cripple them to slow them down and call it out on area mic for anyone nearby. Usually works pretty well.
---
Hell yea i bet if we get an update we can traid in 50 for a legendary drop no legendary but bulk resources or 30 of a type food or 30 random plans
---
Mine is a 5x5 garage with 3x5 being the main area, a staircase to the right of the garage door leading to my bedroom and my twin fusion generators behind a metal wall, downstairs is the lobby with vendors on the back wall and my work stations on either wall. Behind the 3x5 is locked with a keypad and that is my purifiers and shower.  Surrounding the base are 9 turrets that will shoot anything on site and one more inside in case my other turrets went on strike. Very helpful . Still doesn't protect from scorchbeasts though...nothing does
---
Not exactly sure when it started but it's been happening the entire time I've had the weight reduction gear so at least since March.
---
You didn't drop goodies in his sack then yes you are
---
Don't be so polite, engame boss running away midfight is annoying bug and it is happending for longer than half a year.
---
Grafton Station too. I don‚Äôt think it drops, so buying it from the station is the only way to get it.
---
Thanks, man! Sorry I had to server hop on you, those guys were in a group with me and I tried to talk to you in area chat about it. Thanks for visiting!
---
Good work.
---
I remember when we all stood on the grass at whitesprings and picked off the ghouls. Then a patch allowed them to climb up. Certainly changed the gameplay
---
Sounds good to me   let me check and make sure i still have it   and ill let you know  iam at work right now   i work nights
---
Lock yourself in a room so no-one can access and drop everything. See if it goes to 0.
---
I'd like to see the little robot machine from fo4 that you can send out to find ammo, junk, whatever. It just finds it and marks it on your map, so you still have to go snag it, but it was a guaranteed drop for whatever it was you needed. It'd be nice when I need 10 gears or whatever.
---
Bethesda did not acknowledge the problem existed and couldn‚Äôt help me when reached initially. I currently have another ticket open and this time I have some screenshots / proof so I‚Äôll keep you posted when they update.
---
Hahaha just like the intro of Fallout 2! 
---
What the hell is a level 2 doing in Survival anyway??
---
So not only did you kill him you basically T bagged him as well just as he was trying out this new game that so far for him looked awesome.
---
You can just see his face. All smiles as he walks around vault 76 then loads up into the world then . . .thwack.  . . F this game logs off and deletes it
---
What I love is when one stumbles into my camp and gets murdered by the Behemoth in my pond and then I have to listen to that incessant beep until I get fed up and jump servers.
---
NBD. I can't always be on mic between sleeping kids and talking wife üòÇ
---
For sure. I find these kind of kids are doing a good job of it themselves so some decent parenting is in evidence!
---
Nice,  it's certainly easier than making 20 cranberry cobblers or something similar. 
---
I wasn't sure if this was common knowledge or not. Just thought I'd get the info out there. Anything that makes some of these tortuous dailies easier.
---
What Dizzy said, and anti armor is your best friend!
---
Yeah there are drugs for that.
---
See if it sells I guess.  I personally think it's one of the most valuable effects in the game, maybe even more so than marsupial mutation.  Even the thought of playing the game without 100 fall damage reduction makes me cringe.  If anything trade it to me, I just don't see how any non PA user can live without it.  
---
I know bird bones, goat legs, cushioned armor, etc can reduce damage, but 2 pieces of fall dmg armor makes you 100% immune, no hangglider needed.  Jump off the monorail, any cliff, any building, it's ridiculous and once you have it you won't want to lose it.
---
üò¢ps4
---
Good lord, you‚Äôre absolutely precious.
---
I got messaged by a kid the other night, level 5 fresh out of the vault. Sounded about 12 on his mic. He asked me if I had any concrete, so I teamed with him and helped him build his base. 
---
And gave him about 100 plans. Good stuff too, like handmade, gauss rifle, neon letters, fusion generator, etc. Just crap sitting in my vendors for a couple days. 
---
Level 5 kid is now loaded for bear.
---
10mm SMG, you find its ammo everywhere (as well as being easy to craft) and it packs a hell of a punch with the right mods.
---
&gt; Maybe make it so you have to have the plan to install a mod,
---
That defeats the purpose of mods tho. The only reason to use a mod is if you don't have the plan.
---
I actually found a plan once.
---
You can either have bloodied or vampire, not both together.
---
'No hard feelings'
---
I started out around launch and only put in about 15 hours the first few days. Was plagued by negativety and absolute lack of understand what was going on in the game between new systems, invisible mobs, and not having enough storage.

I revisited the game this past week and I‚Äôm at 120 hours played. I‚Äôve not been so addicted to a game in such a short amount of time. Don‚Äôt take my excitement as justification for you rejoining the game, but do know a lot of people are playing and I get fairly positive feedback despite the random disconnects, rare invisible mobs, and goofy CAMP editing system.
---
You need crystal? I think I have a couple hundred if you're on xbox. I was running four workshops for lead/aluminum/steel/fusion core farming, and two of them had crystal so I fired those up also. 
---
As for storing the jetpack, throw it on a spare frame. I have one frame I use for parts. guaranteed it weighs less than one piece of power armor that goes on it, so at the very least you'll save a couple pounds. 
---
That said, I don't think jetpacks + marsupial are useless together. I use it all the time to get into peoples' "impenetrable" camps. Uses up fusion cores quicker, but I definitely get use out of it.
---
i am a complete pve player myself and i dont use workshops so i have no problem at all but i think the problem isnt that people are dicks
---
imo its completely understandable that there is a pvp player base in this game but bethesda ruined survival mode so much that the best way to enjoy pvp nowadays seems to be a dick in adventure mode
---
&gt; The rumored and leaked content in the near future is also pretty exciting.
---
Such as? I haven't been following much news on this game. Too busy playing.
---
I wouldn't touch workshops if I didn't have to. I just simply cannot get enough materials without them.
---
Pretty much all good advice that I felt like posting myself, it's important so should be repeated often.
---
Whitespring though, slow loads aren't just due to camp complexity it's overall server load esp. at peak times. And my shop character lives there so needs amenities to survive. Also she's always well stocked and it's worth the loading wait. Always busy and people appreciate the benches and Mole Miner target range out back :)
---
Welcome to the internet.  Don't act so surprised when strangers don't care for your feelings and especially not for your digital Avatar.
---
Same thing just happened to me!
---
really? i usually dont use them because i get every ressource literally 10 times more efficient by just scavenging it than by using a workshop the only one i would ever even consider using is the one producing fusion cores
---
btw wich materials do you usually get through workshops?
---
Ah, I see you're one of the guys that this post is aimed at!
---
Thank you. I just heard Tina Turner yell Welcome to another edition of thunderdome" in  my head.
---
The gauss rifle is a little tricky in vats to begin with. I think it goes by the chance to hit when you pull the trigger, not when you release it. There's a slight delay while it calculates the percentage that it's 0 so if you're holding the trigger when you activate vats or pull it too soon it will auto miss. On the upside i've had enemies duck behind a doorway while i'm charging, but still hit them anyway.
---
Herd Mentality... -2 to all Specials when solo...
---
I agree but would say 10 seconds as I've found plenty of bargains in those kind of hide and seek machines because...no fucker can be bothered to find them :)
---
It doesn‚Äôt in survival. Also shame on you üòÇ
---
Well, I use workshops mostly for steel and junk deposits. My issue is that, to keep up with my spending habits ever since player vending was added, I sell pretty much every piece of junk that I pick up and usually don't scrap it.
---
Beats me man. I‚Äôm being honest, though. He went down immediately.
---
Yes I'm well aware. But the OP indicates he has grounded, electrically charged and chameleon. None of those cause reduced SPECIAL stats.
---
I was led to believe that Shotgun shoots 4 or 5 pellets normally, and TSE just increases the pellet count by 1.   True?
---
I'm on Xbox and mine is working.
---
Meh.  Swing speed is better secondary than power attack damage IMO. I have a powerfist with the exact same effects as the unstoppable monster and it never gets used because swing speed has more practicality.
---
Beam splitter? Accuracy is awful, but fun üëçüèª Even better if TSE!
---
Many effects often don't show in the Pipboy, HM is one of them. &amp; OP edited saying it was indeed HM.
---
I THINK it works like this:
---
1* legendary enemies drop 1* loot. 2* enemies can drop 1 OR 2* loot, 3* can drop 1,2 or 3* loot. Depends on luck and rng
---
Now picture that same scenario, but Negan is swinging the bat..
---
i get you but as far as i know junk is very inefficient to sell your better off selling water or chema or whatever and for steel the best way is to scrap weapons just take with you every gun when running through an area one or two times and you should have about 200-300 steel without even having scrapper
---
(for money making get yourself the marine helmet plan and make a few of those to sell them they are very expensive and require nearly no materials)
---
Todd hates you.
---
Uh yep yep makes sense
---
Wow, that is surprisingly a low amount of damage thats even less than junkie's which would start out at 50% bonus damage. Since you'd have to stick on target I was expecting it to go up to 90% damage at least.
---
Gotta say my 3 star non-junk never goes in the machines. Anything above 1K I start to begrudge the 10% tax so will happily remove it first. Clothing is light so stays on the shop character (she doesn't adventure so lives in the shop) as well as ammo and good gear.
---
My 4 machines are: weapons, armour, notes and latest/ lucky dip. All are always fully stocked and all sell equally well. Knowing demand and prices is key.
---
iirc there are some holotapes that explain it a little, but not fully. trying to increase tourism i think.
---
Yes, i understand that. But again, OP indicated he did not have HM. And the comment i responded to advised those mutations he did have, caused negative SPECIAL stats which was not true.
---
PC player here. It is working for me.
---
Not for spikes but thats normal.
---
What are his Stats and current effects?
---
Yea i break my double conditioned TS cryolator, TS shotgun, furious Gatling gun all the time before the fight ends. I use tormentor, tenderizer and enforcer when all my weapons break i break out the bloodied weapons.
---
I mainly use instigating melee. 
---
I have an instigating 3* DC Gauntlet that I threw an extra claw on, and it does 350 base damage with my perks and mutations. It one-swipes legendary ghouls at whitespring. Makes doing the rounds super quick.
---
He He. Guess who‚Äôs joining the Pioneer Scouts.
---
Disagree.  Most melee builds are lacking in most areas of defense making it impossible to get to their targets.  But someone who's got their defensive bases covered can do very well in pvp. You don't need to be doing 1k damage per shot to kill other players.  Just tank long enough to get to them.
---
How do you accidentally swing and kill someone that is freshly coming out of the vault. You wanted that fool dead
---
He spawns inside me. I grab my controller and hit R2 on accident. He runs forward...thunk.
---
The only way to rebuild after an apocalypse is together!  Where are your fellow Responders?
---
I just got home from a two week stint of work.... WTF Bethesda. Either fix the Chainsaw or just put it back to the way it was. You made my favorite melee weapon into useless garbage.
---
Yup. I only use them for people with trap rooms when you fast travel. Drop an orbital strike beacon and you pretty much guarantee they're gonna have to use your dropped loot to fix their house.
---
It does drop, but it's pretty rare, so most people just buy it from the vendor.
---
No one is ever going to by Plans for the Mole weapon.
---
Shotguns fire 8 pellets normally. TS increases it by 1, but still increases the total damage by 25%.
---
No-one knows what Explosive does on shotguns, but there was a massive nerf a couple of patches back. They use a different explosive projectile than other weapons now, so the rules will be different.
---
The 200s *may* have used the leveling exploits that used to exist
---
Also, bloated ghouls used to offer quadruple their current xp
---
Used to be much easier to level...
---
It's just a video game sold fraudulently. And if we don't vote with our wallets, devs will keep releasing unfinished games.
---
I paid my money for the game, I'm allowed just as much an opinion as you. Why are you angry?!?!?!?!?
---
I'm also a PC player but it's just not working no matter what ammo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Level 287. 
---
Stack your xp increases like you are doing. Don't go for "grinding" areas, go for events and quests. Take / Retake and Main Quest Line / Dailies will yield levels you can't achieve by killing ghouls in a nuke zone wearing a hazmat suit and running around screaming.
---
This does help a lot. I prefer Heavy and melee personally, but I've yet to get a great drop that shreds mobs. Back to grinding out some levels and legendaries. West Tek it is, two birds with one stone.
---
solomon's pond
---
Nuke zones. Even as a low level I was wearing power armor or a hazmat suit and tagging mobs while the others slaughtered. Doing that got me to 100 pretty quick. Now its queen fights and other events. With the queen fights I try to tag every mob I see.
---
Yeah I had mine glitch out for quite awhile. It had 32 shots instead of 1. Fixed itself eventually but that was fun. I have a 3* instigating and bloodied one too- the insta can one hit cargobots full health no chems, all it's used for. The bloodied on the pvp guy is used for scorchbeasts and mirlurk queens. I have tse stored, it's not enough damage to be useful without the glitch.
---
No one has room for small letters!
---
Yeah, he is just interested in making money no matter what, be in shoddy merch or blatant lies.
---
&gt; since the game spawns you standing up
---
I sneak in fast travel all the time in adventure mode. Is it different in survival?
---
Nah dude.  In the first week people where camping 76 with TSE weapons.
---
I took an old alt I made and grinded him up about 27 levels in 2 or 3 days about a week ago by farming whitesprings. What's nice is you get a stockpile of meds, ammo, and legendary weapons you could sell/use after.
---
I would of up-voted you if not for the last two sentences.   
---
Yes, game is fun and I play it a lot but there is a good reason it got a lot of hate, it was deserved so don't just dismiss it and hail Bethesda just because you like it.
---
This helps, and yeah I should've said what I'm looking for. I'm more into heavy weapons and melee.  I'm prioritizing fixing up my current character as opposed to starting a new. Thank you for the tips.
---
When you say it's not working you mean the craftable amount does not change with or without the perk equipped?
---

Ah, sadly I'm avoiding main quest things on purpose. I've left the Overseer's log in Flatwood on purpose. Hmmm, I did just find a hazmat suit though...! Any particular dailies that aren't tied to the MQ that you might reccomend?
---
Ain't that a BAT in the head.
---
Yeah it'll just craft the normal amount as if the perk isn't equipped
---
between the breakage rate of my 3* The Dragon and the remaining time before the heat death of the universe I don't think I'll ever be able to shoot the ~250 .50 cal balls in my ammo inventory.
---
I was locked out until just today when I found a hazmat suit, so whenever I see that golfcourse go red I'll be making my way there to run around screaming. Thanks.
---
I'm seeing a theme here. Thanks. :P
---
Ah, that does explain a lot, as they still give a nice chunk. That much more, filtered through perks and rested, would be a handful of bloated per level for me right now.
---
If you want base raiding and heavy consequence PvP this may not be the game for you. Fo76 was always intended to be co-op first with PvP as an add-on.
---
Wouldn't be opposed to the whole purchasable repair-kits if events had the chance to drop them as well as there being a recipe to craft them ourselves. Could balance it by costing double the normal resources to make and only usable on the weapon you made it for.
---
I've just started a new character this week that's going to be my survival character and can confirm you can kill lvl 5 and unders in that mode. I still got the notification about PVP being enable once I hit lvl 5.
---
Same here. Not sure of exact locations other than the cranberry glade.
---
Idk, I had the same issue with my mule account and a single action revolver with no combat perk cards that I can think of.
---
Sorry Man, this is just a suggestion and it's not in game. Hopefully one day it will be :)
---
At some point.
---

---
I have a 3* instigating exploding dragon. Does like 800 base damage. If I know I'm going to run into a glowing yao guai, I'll use it, and then immediately switch to my bloodied powerfist. 
---
I'm not running a bloodied build. I just know that between dumping lead from the dragon into it and switching to my powerfist that fucking yao guai is going to pro-swipe me down to a sliver of health, and then my bloodied powerfist will end him. xD
---
Otherwise, the black powder stuff reloads too slowly to put it to much use, in my opinion. I use it to take Behemoths down by a quarter health in one shot, but then switch to something else.
---
Trying to lay the door on a single slab?
---
Drop a second foundation down on the other side of the door
---
No you cannot. The build limit is too small. I had a small house, collector, 2 generators, and 3 turrents and the build limit was maxed.
---
The ones that really annoy me are when you are doing an event, like waiting ages with the jukebox in one violent night solo when an ultra high level player, usually in late 100 or 200 turns up with all the best gear proceeds to run outside before everyone else just so they can 1 shot the legendary. Why when you already have everything :(
---
The only silver lining was he got me with some of his explosions from his gun whilst cleaning up so I proceeded to kill him and take his junk as compensation, tried seeking revenge but I already fast travelled and stashed all the junk he had in bulks ;)
---
29 mins ish  later  that one at robo Corp happened. Another high level who kept dying, got to the legendary and he died. I could of quickly killed it and take his loot but that's rude when he didn't do anything to me. So I waited for him after tagging the legendary. He came back and unfortunately I forgot to get out of there from the explosion and got dropped, no worries that guy Must be thankful I didn't loot him and only tagged the legendary, nope he took my junk &gt;:(
---
Not sure. Running any mods?
---
True I forget that tbh but I‚Äôm confused on why every single server is down lol I‚Äôve been looking for a world for 15 minutes now since my world ‚Äúended‚Äù for maintenance
---
I feel like more people would go out of there way to use the supply drops if they either dropped rarer items/resources or you could simply consume all your supply keys and have all the loot appear in a single chest.
---
Though to limit stress on a server limit it to 5-10 max consumed per drop.
---
When you initially join a server it spawns you standing up. I think the dude misunderstood what the OP was saying because you are right when you fast travel sneaking you spawn sneaking regardless of the mode.
---
I never sleep üòÇ not hardly anyhow I guess I forgot that‚Äôs how this is supposed to go üòÇ
---
The servers that are going to shutdown dont let new people join so I just took every workshop on the entire map.
---
Not many that will yield high xp. Jack at the Pumpkin house, Camden Park, the new Tad Pole Quest (but they take you to some higher level areas)...boring side quests? Mr. Messenger and the like might help. 
---
Best bet is probably to take over all the workshops around the Forest Region and defend them. Or... take your character to PVP knowing you will be slaughtered IF you meet another player, avoid everyone at all costs and enjoy the 20% bonus xp stack and kill everything you see.
---
Okay, good to know.
---
Are you the guy I ran into outside Vault 76 with like 20 PA frames in his inventory? I have a screenshot of that shit somewhere. This guy had an unbelievable amount of power armor, mostly mismatched.
---
I see. Welp I guess that‚Äôs my cue to sleep üò¢ I was having too much fun üòÇ
---
Agree with most everything you said. 
---
Regarding camps we really need plans for nature items. Trees, shrubs, rocks, etc that we can place around uneven foundations or just in general to make our camps feel more natural. While I enjoy having bright balloons and streamers and vault boy statues, I'd love to have it look more natural too.
---
A green house set would also be perfect. The assets already exist from fo4. And we should be allowed to have  small planters for our crops indoors.
---
This is just a guess since i do t use heavy weapons, but perhaps the power user perk.
---
I'll try that when I arrive home. Thanks.
---
It is frustrating :)
---
You couldnt handle him alone? I'd have that thing killed in 2 shots with my explosive bloodied lever action.
---
Who puts a toilet in a parking lot!? This sounds like another trap.
---
Don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of a BS story.
---
Yessss
---
Was the only workable solution I could find
---
Resulted in me upending an entire structure, because there wasn‚Äôt enough space to add that extra foundation to flip it how I wanted -_-
---
I can't even find them in game any more, where can they be found? I haven't seen one drop in months.
---
I've just done what you are describing except I left the main quest at an ounce of preservation and leveled to 50 . I personally eat cranberry cobbler and sleep to get the xp boosts. If the path to enlightenment event is on I sweap by and finish that so I'm rocking a +15 xp boost then do the daily quest for biv and pioneer scouts whilst grabbing any events that pop up. I'm playing for about 2-4 hours a night in week days and dont really get to play at the weekend. I hit 50 in just under 2 weeks. This is my 2nd play through. I bulk my junk daily and cook anything I find for small xp. Hope this helps.
---
It also comes down to game and engine optimisation. 
---
Sure, Consoles may not be as fast as some PC's (depending on how old the pc is) but there's no need to be mean about it. They just want to play the game too!
---
I have another idea to improve taming as well but robotically, adding a microchip to show that its your pet and you like him... i guess
---
Nah no mods just the game. I've looked it up to and there's like no recent problems with it
---
When there is a chance of something hapening, when it does hapen it procks.
---
Context example, when you search a chem box with the pharma perk. When you find extra chems the perk procked. At level 1 the perk has a 40% chance of procking.
---
He went out like a champ though. So long my fugly friend hope you fair well in the next life.
---
Hmmm.
---
I can try to build it seperate (drag the side walls from the original building), then stitch back to the building aswell. Ill see if its work.
---
The plan
---
I avoid survival like the plague as I find being hunted across the map by a guy using a two shot explosive .50 cal death machine that can kill me before the guy even fires a bullet a bit boring. I totally agree. I'd love to be able to rate a player like the old xb360 reputation mechanic. If someone toxic turns up you can just nope out of there
---
You can respec tho right? I just hit lvl 16 and Amy build of shotgun/rifle is coming together somewhat. Any tips or websites I should checkout? I‚Äôm looking to run a good rifle for most encounters and when shit gets in my face I‚Äôll use the shotgun.  Is that endgame viable with the right perks?
---
Ranger station in the bog.
---
But an AAE Faster reload pipe rifle is gonna be worth much more than a nocturnal gauss rifle with bashing damage and +1 perception. Totally depends on all the factors.
---
Give me a minute and i'll go put up my best gear for 100c each
---
I finally got the character I wanted, a Stealth Commando with a Backpack! so now I'm going to start a Strength build.
---
Congrats! The only way you could have made it worse was to have the cannibal perk equipped and accidentally ate him as well when you were trying to revive him.
---
I did hear something about a perc card mentioned. I'll look into it thanks.
---
What format are you on?
---
You just returned and have ALL the badges??
---
Also a new event for later game. A new quest line for around level 35. A new quest line that revolves around chalenges and eventually rewards a back pack that increases carry weight while not in power armour. Player stash is now 800lbs.
---
that is very true there are way to many factors in selling legendary weapons it‚Äôs hard to tell what it‚Äôs worth unless you know what the perks are
---
Im not really into achievement-hunting, for a lack of a better term. Can I equip them or something?
---
"Oh my these applatoes are delicious!"
---
Is there a challenge for that? I‚Äôve only ever had two at once.
---
It states fusion cores... i think you use a plasma core, but it might work. Have a look around the net first if you are not willing to risk a level to get the perk.
---
Im prety sure it works for gattling laser.
---
Does Grenadier still count?
---
Nope. Took them all and nothing happened
---
Agreed totally.
---
You avoided his question entirely.  You say you *just* returned, but have you done the possum badges?  And don't say you have all of them because you don't.  Many of them are bugged and not able to be finished yet.  
---
When i'm bored I grind some challenges for atom.  Sometimes i'll go launch a nuke.  
---
If you're *that* bored, just play another game or something.  I dunno.
---
Make multiple build types. An online game is always changing so you never know when a build will be buffed or nerfed it‚Äôs good to have different play styles at the ready.
---
No, like I said I just returned and got the backpack - I only have 3 that were required to finish the quest.  
---
To be fair my question was avoided too. Whats the point of completing them? The ones I did for the quest didnt give me atoms or anything.
---
The most obvious answer for when things aren't happening in the game that *should be* happening, is it might be bugged.  I haven't run into this issue before so I can't say for sure.
---
Cut your losses, re-log and hopefully try again next time.
---
This is true. 
---
I used to use bugged foundations for the walls of my castle style camp, and enemies would just run straight up a stack of 5/6 foundations before teleporting inside my camp. 
---
They have a ramp so you can't use them as walls. It makes building insanely buggy though, and honestly, the cost of the ramp outweighs the benefit.
---
Im not sure, i just logged in no problem
---
Get a backpack and then earn enough possum badges to mod it. It includes lots of challenges that are actually interesting and get you to parts if the map you've forgotten or never even been to. Photography, gardener, archeology etc are easy enough - look under challenges/world to see the full list.
---
"F76 is good" - Haha, what an good joke.
---
Badges are like tokens for backpacks and mods. Tadpole to earn the backpack, possum to mod it.
---
Thats a good idea, I made an alt awhile ago to build some concepts for more camps/bases. Maybe soon Ill do another play through with them and use different perks. :)
---
Thanks! I just started switching one of my characters to a melee build and wanted to pick one up.
---
its ok man, just wait for fallout 5 and hope its a single player
---
Oh I didnt know you could mod your backpack with them, I should have looked more stuff about it. I had a fun time doing them for the quest but didnt think there was any other reason to do them, Ill try to do more of them.
---
Tubthumping.
---
Possibly, I guess? Maybe they were trying to start up a new character solely on survival?
---
I think you can still be killed if the other is high enough level to one shot you.
---
I‚Äôve been leveling up about 10 levels per day in the past two days, so I went from 15 to 35. It‚Äôs actually not that hard if leveling up is your only priority. Just stick around WS, all you need is within walk distance. I‚Äôve also travelled around players‚Äô vending to see if there‚Äôs any fun stuff out there, which has been a waste of time, otherwise it should be even faster. 
---
A handy weapon helps a lot. I‚Äôm using a level 10 bloodied 10mm smg and a level 15 medic‚Äôs handmade (both came from purveyor). 
---
Also get a marsupial mutation from a vendor. It helps a lot. Yes without Starched Genes you risk losing it if you take Radaway. I‚Äôve been able to keep my health around 20-30, at that rad level the mutation won‚Äôt be removed easily.
---
Thanks for clarifying.  Once you've done the tadpole challenges to get the backpack you can then do the possum challenges.  Each time you fully complete one of them you will get a badge.  You can spend these badges at little vending machines at the Pioneer Scout camp (where the Pioneer Scout Leader Bot hangs out in the mire).  The tadpole badges (which you should have at least 3 of by now since you completed 3 of the challenges), can be spent on a few cosmetic/camp items such as a pioneer scout banner, sleeping bag, US flag, etc...  Once you complete the Possum challenges and collect a few of *those* badges, you can spend them at a Possum vending machine to get backpack mods like refrigeration (food spoils slower), carry weight upgrade, etc...
---
I recommend fast traveling to the Pioneer Scout camp and looking at the vending machines to see what you can buy.  There's a picture further down on [this article](https://twinfinite.net/2019/05/fallout-76-backpack-mods-how-get-what-do/) that will show you the things you can get with the Possum badges as well as a good how-to on doing all of this.

I‚Äôm level 275. I have never used any exp exploit. I have 600 hrs in game. Any one who used the gernade trap exploit was ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù banned (still banned). At least all of the ones I know. They had to buy a second copy of the game in order to play again . So any high level players are likely that high due to playing every day and mainly sticking to one character. In regards to the ghouls giving 4x exp I was only level 90 ish when that got nerfed. It‚Äôs rather easy to level once your already high level as doing Wes Tek run after Wes Tek run nets you a lot of levels.
---
Sell  everything you don't need.
---
Get the Hard Bargain perk at lvl 7 and sell everything you can get your grubby little hands on.
---
I've a flaming long bow bar chainsaw for sale for weeks for 350 caps and nobody will buy it. 
---
In my experience it can melt through the scorchbeast queen once she lands. It might be a useless weapon in most circumstances but not against the big mamma. I've taken 40% chunks out if her health bar with my crappy level 20 Chainsaw while god roll heavy weapons cried in fear.
---
This is why I honestly wrote "chainsaws melt the SBQ" on my weapon vending machine. But no sale!
---
White springs is popular for high level players and it constantly spawns high level mobs because of it.
---
So i recommend just avoiding it till you are higher level. Like around 30 when you will be able to handle maybe 2 mobs at a time.
---
If you are trying to get the holotape for the quest check if someone is clearing the golf resort and look for your chance to run in and grab it after its cleared. However the quest only rewards around 250xp. You can do almost any other event for similar or more xp.
---
What a joke of a response
---
I currently have 4. A power armor heavy weapons build. A chem addicted gunslinger. A berserkers unarmed/ shotgun build. And a sneak/ bloodied rifleman build. So no mater what gets buffed or nerfed I‚Äôm ready to get into the action.
---
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?!?!
---
I‚Äôm more talking about challenges like the scout badges, cos there are all the revive challenges which depend upon you having a friend really. To be honest this is more of a rant from me cos I‚Äôve been stalking people for over 3 hours
---
What system? I'm play rn in xb1
---
Take away the explosive aspect and they're even less effective. I just hope Bethesda stops listening to PVP players and people without better guns and un-nerfs them, even if it's just a little bit.
---
Pick up everything! Sell, Sell, Sell!
---
ive thought about this exact thing before. i have a concrete defense slab wall set up with neon letters to grab attention, then i listed out stuff i need and am willing to buy with my ign for dm contact info, but... it takes WAY too much space out of my build limit. i would really love for Bethesda to add like a bulletin board that you can write personalised notes on, or just add a buying feature to the vendor bots, i dunno. theres a lot of potential for this game to really work out for people like me who play the trader/chem dealer angle. actually just in general theres a lot of potential. i love your idea, also, it would be cool to be able to craft a ton of notes and be able to drop them around the wasteland to create a player made scavenger game. just a thought.

Do a test.  While *not* running the game, open your task manager and take a good look through the "processes" tab and note which ones are using the most CPU.  Also switch over to the "Performance" tab and watch the graph for your CPU and see if it's constantly running high.  From this point you can easily deduce where most of your CPU resources are getting pulled from.  After this you can run the game and do the same thing.  Obviously, since you're playing a game, your numbers will be higher and FO76 will be using most of it, but you can see if maybe there are other things not playing nice with the game while it's running.
---
If you can't narrow down anything that might be causing the issue, then I'd suggest going over to a different subreddit with your question.  Perhaps one that is more specialized in PC troubleshooting.  I'd likely recommend /r/techsupport
---
I got this problem only with my gauss rifle which miss often in VATS
---
Thats really sweet, I went over and found them - they seem useful so Im going to try and get more of those badges asap. Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the help. :)
---
Not really. Not using valuable resources is part of it. I'll often use a mod instead of building because I don't want to spend the junk or flux. 
---
Either way, it's entirely possible to just make some other limiting factor.
---
This is a hiccup caused by audio loading and has been there for months. I'm getting this type of 2-5 second hiccups and my best guess is that 16 GB is not enough. You can try lowering the graphics quality to save some memory (didn't work for me) and quit as many applications as you can, including the Bethesda launcher (minimal improvement).
---
I and others have reported the issue to Beth several times now and is probably a bug somewhere deep in the engine - those get fixed the slowest in my experience.
---
We already can't place CAMPs around most pre-existent buildings, so if someone did make a wall around a building, why would it matter?
---
Avoid pick locking in camps and you'll be fine.
---
He says he's spent 20K on FT. If he's got 20K in a couple days then he must be rolling in caps. 
---
He also says, "I have plenty of caps, my issue is wasting 10000+ traveling to shop over the last couple days."
---
That's not bad. I purposely instigate fights with larger enemies, depending the location, and lead them to other players camps and let their base get destroyed (i only do it to players that have defenses set up)
---
You mean for doing some dailys at kiddie corner cabins...?
---
Fair enough.
---
‚Ä¶.. Must be a leftover camp of the Gourmand-Faction before they&gt;! all went and ate each other or turned into Wendigos!&lt;
---
It can be a bit grindy.  Like I said, some of the badges aren't able to be completed because they're bugged right now.  The only one I can remember specifically is the musician badge.  For some reason it won't log when you play an instrument in the locations they specify.  It also won't log when you play certain instruments in *any* location.
---
U wot m8
---
I was around the waterpark section and there was this monster and a guy and me were trying to kill it. But he got struck down. So i wanted to save him and accidentally at his corps so he died. Not how it was supposed to have gone..
---
are you on pc? I have been looking for a chainsaw for so long want one for my  weapon coletion
---
BlunterNote587 gave you the best advice.
---
Last Sunday I was able to gain 8 levels in 6 hours.
---
20-28, by taking two workshops and constantly jumping on events.
---
When no event was available on the map, I concentrated on building in the workshops and doing tadpole stuff. Even joining them gives you access to two dailies.
---
With Faster Fire Rate instead of explosive for more rad damage.
---
I'd rather buy the atoms for same price than that...
---
Right outta the vault? Hmm.. go to places like New Gad, kill a ton of super mutants, sell all of their stuff.. kill the graffton monster that hides there..   
---
other than that, earning super duper and chemist and being a drug dealer to the vendors
---
What platform? I'll take it off your hands :)
---
Absolutely love those. Im just curious : How often did you have to try to get the one with the arrow perfectly ? XD
---
Yeah I try to sell them a bit, but only thing I can regularly sell is gauss ammo for 1c. I usually manage to clear out any I loot. But getting room for the other ammo as well it's quite difficult.
---
But they can one-two shoot you, even if walls are the way (stupid molemen...)
---
I recently made a new toon for heavy weapons and PA.
---
This is what im personally aiming for:

I asked for help a few days back and a dude replied with an excellent guide, my build is different because i play sporadically and dont have a mule character so i take certain qol perks that he didnt. but the guide is a must read if you ask me.

It‚Äôs just your fault to hit the wallüòÇ

Nuke zones + cranberry relish + WS/Watoga to finish for 3/3 for the daily
---
super mutants werent needed in F76 ?
---
Doode... whoever saied that should be smacked with a rancid rad-Steak. :P
---
For me the Super Mutants  are an iconic part of the Fallout-Series. Personally I couldnt imagine any FO-game without them.
---
And I agree with OP that Bethesda did a nice Job at explaining their presence in Appalachia.
---
To get more xp: Canned Meat Stew and well rested, and also a leader bobblehead if I happen to have one.
---
I guess the reasoning is;  
---
For Bloodied, you need to be on low health to get a high damage bonus.  
---
For Berserkers, you need to go naked to get a high damage bonus.  
---
For Junkies, you need to maintain 5 addictions and suffer the cumulative stat negatives from the withdrawal effects.  
---
For Furious, Two-Shot and Anti-armor, there's no such drawback - and consequently also less power potential.
---
The molemen shoot through the walls :)
---
Can‚Äôt you just maneuver?
---
I've noticed VATS is more broken than ever.  It's basically useless now
---
You can simply hold the spacebar in vats and it will use them automatically.
---
if an NPC is stuck in a wall carry nuka nades, their blast radius can go clean through walls
---
Yesterday in Mire I found injured super mutant. He was marked as hostile but he wasn't attacking me. He was moving around few other dead super mutants. The dead ones had a sheepsquatch quill on them. Looks like the battle was hard.
---
Do i get rewards for turning in technical data to you?
---
i met a friend online about 9 years ago playing WoW, weve migrated over to xbox and playstation and now the switch, hes got a couple of younglings running around, and its always so amazing watching the youngest try and play. now that my 11 year old niece is getting into gaming, weve begun to have a huge age range within our nightly gaming sessions. its nice to be assured that we're not the only gamers  that deal with this embarrassment sometimes. most people we've run across in the wasteland are pretty accommodating about it so long as they know its a literal kid thats whacking them with a police baton.
---
The distance was way too short. I heard the missle flying then I was already dead :)
---
I do this all every time I switch modes..... ;)
---
Not believing for a second that you didn‚Äôt intentionally kill him.  Why else would you spawn at the vault in survival mode? Just doesn‚Äôt add up.
---
Have you avoided it using the higher jump from marsupial?
---
True dat
---
Sell every junk which has only one component.
---
Pick and sell every flower, vegatable and meat you don't need. Cook some of it for better results.
---
Burned magazine or book yields 1 cap as well.
---
Get as soon as possible the following perks: Green thumb, Pharma farma, Hard Bargain and Butcher's bounty. Bonus points for Cap Collector if you know the locations.
---
And for even better results, get Marine tactical helmet plan.
---
Also farming downvotes?
---
Its RNG, I get it all the time, 1 star from 3 star mobs
---
My two star bloodied + swing speed is better. It's really nice but I don't know about calling it god tier.
---
Apparently.. 
---
Just tryin to help guyz geeze
---
3 stars means you only have a chance to get 3 star item and it seems its quite low.
---
I was in a building. That moleman was outside. I tried to jump, but it was way too late.
---
If it could not shoot trough walls, I would able manage to not to die that day.
---
just follow the quests
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. It's just been a bit of an adjustment going from being able to 1 shot kill most things.
---
Bulks of ammo would also be very nice. That way you can sell the bulks to players (maybe vendors too) for 1 hubbuck or so each, which is a way better price than 1 cap per bullet.
---
Yeah... sorry but this isn't right. If you stayed away from workshops your life would be so much better. Roll the puny mutants at the wood yard for steel. Unless you are shooting constantly you don't need more steel than that. Lead and plastic are in abundance.
---
Well, its still weak. Were you bringing junk around that day as well?
---
I'll buy everything you've got if I see it at 2 (that's my 'jump at it' price) and I'll normally grab a couple of hundred to restock at 3.
---
I mean, I am a casual player so I don't know a lot of this stuff.
---
okay, so im super glad you posted this; no cnd degredation, weightless 1% hunger restoration, and super easy to obtain; ive mixed feelings because its my favourite emergency hunger restoration item but... its also my best kept secret cus i hate pvp and im pretty sure its a pvp event. i feel like people need to know about that event, but i really dont want anyone to know because... well... i dunno about you guys, but i really hate getting one shot by someone just using a meta. half kappa, but you have a really great point, i had never thought about hoarding the candies but now im definitely going to.
---
No, I always put my junks to my stash. And I had my revenge too.
---
Hmm. Good thing you didn‚Äôt lose em. But its still weak. Is there other weapons that uses missiles?
---
thx wish I was but XB1 here!
---
The outfit with the wooden mask is prepper trapper 1
---
You cleared it out to zero and it gets stuck. Try selling anyways or buying he cheapest item from the bot. That always fixes for me.
---
this is cool thanks for the video üôÇ im going to try this with my camp
---
Can confirm junk piles.
---
Without. Just walk up and search it.
---
yes, and people who live on the other side of the flat earth have to play at night cuz servers are down during their day time
---
One of the bots at whitesprings has em. Brotherhood or watoga I think.
---
I know this visual bug, that's not the case. I can see they have 7 caps and could sell them something for caps and it properly subtracted. It's just not resetting back to 1400.
---
Have you deleted the ini files in mygames/fallout76 folder?
---
As farvas I know, no.
---
Yes, this is happens at least since December 2018. In addition, recent patches have decreased the 3\* loot drop chances a lot: 20% chance for a 3\* enemy to drop a 3\* item and overall less than 4% chance to see a 3\* drop. This was 40% and 7% pre patch 8 with the same character and build.
---
.... getting rid of my missiles now. Unless it gets buff.
---
.... Well, Getting rid of my missiles now.
---
Definitely need to check it out because I'm the same way, I need certain qol perks as a solo player without a mule as well.
---
I highly recommend the sound mod for fallout 76 if you are on pc. I absolutely love it and it's just a single file to drop in the main game folder and adds HRTF  3D sound mapping.

I personally don't mind that it's the same date, but it could be fun if it followed our real time calender.   Would add a little more realism to the game.
---
Completely agree. Quite often, instead of legendary farming for scrip, I'll buy legendaries at the 50 - 100 price range to save myself the time. When I see people shifting trash (noct. etc) 1* legend gear for more than face value? I cringe. Same with seeing nukes and missiles at high prices.
---
Lmfao that guy's a fucking loser
---
You should run with trapper armor or use a full set with the leaded mod, that's my current setup for queen runs outside power armor.
---
The queen has a radiation aura and does rad dmg on hit, but I simply wear 3 pieces of zealots gear all modded with lead lined. My stats are around 200 across the board with the lead lined backpack on.
---
With this setup and defensive perks, I can hold at 10% health indefinitely while hitting for 2.7k (buffed) and taking zero rad damage. My weapon is a bloody swing speed power fist.
---
If you tried out a couple mutant slayers pieces mixed in with unyielding and rad resist, you would be the unstoppable God of westek.

team with level 99's and use a deathclaw gauntlet as they drag me through hell. 
---
&gt;team
---
whoops, i forgot People who play 76 are as anti-social as all hell. it's amazing. lmfAO
---
you need to learn themin order for the next set to show up. normal, sturdy and then heavy there are also light plans you can get them any time
---
were in welch as of last night
---
Bloody brilliant ! XD
---
&gt; 200 reasonably:
---
Play.
---
But seriously. Play. If you live in the Cranberry Bog you have plenty of events. Take a trip through Glassed Cavern. Kill the Mirelurk Queen. Waltz through the Civic Center. Check out Abandoned Bog Town for a chance at a Behemoth. Tip: get a shotgun with Enforcer and you can kill every high reward mob with a boxing glove and a hand full of shotgun shells.
---
The fastest way to level is combat and you can't get a few feet before ending up in combat. Big mobs (scorch beast, Sheepsquatch, deathclaw) are worth quite a bit of xp. Events have an XP bonus.
---
If you feel wimpy take some time to do One Violent Night and just let the ghouls spawn for as long as you can.
---
This game hemorrhages levels.
---
by placing your camp next to the golf club you are stopping everyone else from clearing it
---
then you'd just be seeing assholes displaying their sets of x-01 and excavator PA like it's special lmao
---
lmao this is nowhere near the golf club bub, this is one portion of the green that literally only spawns ghouls when players arrive.
---
Just checked Whitesprings. They have sturdy, but no heavy. Already tried both Watoga vendors.
---
LMAO NO. then you'd have assholes taking up more space in the world, with their god awful ""houses""
---
Turret farming at the Whitespring isn't some new initiative you've stumbled upon, it's a very well known trick that is widely regarded by the community as a shitty thing to do. Prior to camp pvp immunity you would have been the recipient of a lot of orbital strikes.
---
I think when wastelanders comes out the time will move forward since it comes with a whole new main quest and new factions.
---
This.
---
275 is definitely manageable if you got the game at release. I took a couple months off and I can probably catch up to you even without bloated ghouls, back-to-back SBQ, etc.
---
But they can just spawn inside buildings anyway, so it's as redundant as it is annoying.
---
Just checked and nothing. Unless they disappear when someone buys one.
---
Why? Because I am camped on Whitesprings? I am nowhere near the golf club and the only time these ghouls spawn are during player visits. You guys need to quit the Whitesprings witch hunt. Didn't they patch it so you can't put your camp too close?
---
Not true. I skipped sturdy leather and went straight to heavy.
---
Go to the power substation in Cranberry Bog with Butcher's Bounty.
---
I feel this, I played beta but just now got the game three days ago and I really enjoy it, I have a few friends that have the game and have helped me out with learning the basics and teaming with me, but then last night I‚Äôm playing by myself (I don‚Äôt mind I like playing solo as well)  some arsehole level 114 legit follows me for over an hour hitting me, trying to jump in front of me when I‚Äôm shooting an enemy, etc last night and it‚Äôs miserable. Like dude If you wanna pvp go play survival mode or attack someone not a hundred levels below you.  Like what am I even supposed to do at that point?
---
&gt;&gt;DLC
---
If you mean update, it's a completely different thing, lol. people that play GTA often mess this one up too. 
---
y'see, a DLC is DownLoadable Content is something you'd manually go into a store page to, and download it from there.
---
An update, however could be used for; adding in new content (like the past couple of events) or fixing bugs (which bethesda hardly does, since console players still experience a shitload of lag and freezes)
---
It's weird, it always seems to be people that are like 110 or around there that give me trouble, I don't know if that's some weird coincidence.
---
I'm using a two shot pipe revolver, so I usually target the torso, and 99% of the time it's 95% if I'm not too far away, but recently it's definitely just not connecting and takes a couple more to register.
---
It's not a constant issue but happens every playthrough.
---
I was gonna post about it, but you know what it's like on here. I'm surprised more people aren't telling us that we're doing something wrong, and the game can't be blamed lol.
---
Lmao I have been here for months. I have been doing this for months. I just recently noticed an influx of ghoul spawns due to the amount of people arriving at my camp since the vendors arrived. Chill out.
---
How many times have you attended this event when a similar situation occurred? Is this a common thing?
---
It's been growing in popularity recently. I used to do it solo normally but that hasn't happened for months.
---
Today was the worst I've seen it, but there's normally at least five people there nowadays.
---
Why would you buy meat? Just go outside and stab something and cook it
---
Lucky Hole Mine also can spawn Rad Ants occasionally among Molerats and Cave Crickets. Though I usually only visit Lucky Hole on Lead farm runs. Still, it would be handy to have some ant meat at the vendor when I'm loafing about at the Whitesprings. She's got a large inventory of meats, but it's not particularly a complete enough one to *meet* the demands of *Le Grand Gourmet's* shoppers.
---
You can only fast travel to train stations, the vault, and your camp in survival.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people do it in the first place. I ended up getting off after that, I‚Äôm struggling to not die as it is between repairing armor and my weapon, and it doesn‚Äôt help when I‚Äôm being forced to use vats so I don‚Äôt accidentally hit him.  It‚Äôs things like that that ruin the experience for me, like I don‚Äôt mind dying if it‚Äôs due to my own stupidity and such but when it‚Äôs because someone‚Äôs chasing me shooting cars near me with a explosive shotgun and punching me in the back it gets old.
---
I would argue that there is nothing critical of 76 in this post. I'm not attacking bethesda or 76 I'm just pointing out a bug. :P
---
Ye that should be illegal. Right up there with terrorism.
---
How does one find the spawn point?
---
If its the same as the place i spawn, thats worrying. Im built half way up a mountain, and the spawn is partially inside the wall (which you can run out of) but its round the back of my camp. So nobody will see my nice entrance and guide to the shop placement
---
You could always..... *cough*..... message him.
---
As someone else mentioned, the deathclaw gauntlet is not melee, is unarmed. Same for the power fist
---
could be wrong, but I am pretty sure, that the vendors sell stuff according to the player,and has no set stock, in general .apart from say ,the bos venodor sell some bos stuff and the like.
---
noticed, that if I vendor hop, its pretty much the same items.
---
ie the armour can be had just about anywhere. just, right time,right place.
---
Even if you're not a low health build. You should still get Bolstering instead of Vanguard. For many reasons:
---
1) defence bonus drops by percentage and unless you run Sun-kissed or passive rad cure, you're gonna spend your time neurotically clearing rads or be stuck constantly at 70-80% bonus effectiveness.
---
2) Vanguard is very counter intuitive as a defence. You want to be progressively harder to kill as your health gets lower. So that you have time for your stimpaks to heal you. Remember that you want your hp to move from left to right. The thing about vanguard is that it prevents the few first hit. If you get slapped by albino deathclaw that takes 70% of your hp, it's gonna be near impossible to come back cuz now you're wet noodles.
---
r/HydroHomies approve this message.
---
I'll try that.
---
The 3\* drop chances have been reduced greatly in the past patches. For my character, I used to get 40% 3\* and now 20%. I can only speculate why: balance, longevity, purveyor or to simply feel they are in power.
---
&gt; but I think time progression in the future would be interesting as we could have limited time events relating to irl holidays going on (like we kinda got with the deathclaw Easter eggs, but on a bigger scale).
---
In the Q&amp;A from inside the vault last week it was vaguely mentioned their are plans for future holidays.
---
&gt;Q: Now that Wild Appalachia is finished, can you tell us anything about what you‚Äôre working on next?
---
&gt;Maria:¬†I‚Äôm taking a look at events and the community feedback and suggestions we‚Äôve collected so far. In addition to tackling some of the suggestions that have been raised, I‚Äôd like to make some new events. I‚Äôve been eyeing a few holidays that will be fun to bring to the game. We are working on something right now, but. . . I don‚Äôt think I can say too much yet. Best I can do is assure you that it‚Äôs doubtful you‚Äôve celebrated this in precisely this manner, ever.

Dont blame ya self mate. It was an accident and a hell of a Story to tell - thx for the laugh
---
No BSOD's or black screens. Try lower the GPU/VRAM frequency of you videocard by 50-100 MHz via Afterburner.
---
I do it very often and never seen more than 2 ppl in there. I think you‚Äôre having bad luck
---
No star legendaries don't count but all others do, not just 3*.
---
Make sure you have pacifist mode turned so that you can't accidentally hurt other players. I haven't touched a workshop in months, just to avoid pvp. What system are you on? Someone could show you some resource farming locations, or you can watch some good YouTube videos on it. I'm super casual as well, but resource farming is almost unavoidable in the game when you want to craft stuff and/or repair stuff.
---
It was a bug, should never have had resist. They corrected last patch.
---
I'm on Xbox we ran into same problem..
---
Must've missed that! Thanks!
---
Fast travel should be disabled in survival.
---
It‚Äôs impossible to kill a level 2 at Vault 76. If ur gonna make up a story, at least make it believable.
---
I will hold this build as is and hope they patch it one day. the lack of making ammo is just to nice for me. I consider the ease of faring the fusion cores a pretty strong plus for my personal play style. I always get annoyed and quit any character I have to be in a menu a lot for.
---
I guess I'm lucky because I've been hitting workshops almost daily for a couple months now and I rarely ever have anyone try to take them from me, much less if I'm there at the workshop. I guess that's why this incident was so crazy to me.
---
You have to physically walk to train stations to to discover them as fast travel locations. Even if unlocked in adventure mode.
---
Find friends...
---
A machete eh ? Makes me wonder : Are there any hockey-masks to be found in the Appalachian Wasteland ? :P
---
Yes, I am aware, thank you. :)
---
Mmm than I am out of ideas... sorry :s
---
At least you let him know that the wasteland is gonna be worse. Still you're such a monster... You could've spoke on a mic though and said you didn't mean to kill him
---
Great info thanks you ! How about Furious Tesla rifle do you think ?
---
Time to try deleting the entire game.
---
Thankyou n.n
---
20 Minutes long? How boring is that?! Why not make the legendaries drop loot for everyone in the event? That would fix it...
---
does seem strange, one would think that a combat helmet would give a damage resist for the head. nope..... why have head protection items, that dont work ???????
---
Yeah I've tried but never done it
---
I don't think it would be boring. Currently this event has by far the highest rate of legendaries of any event. Making it twenty minutes would just be bringing it inline with other events.
---
Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward.

"If I live I will kill you, If I die you are forgiven,".

Such is the rule of honor.

You‚Äôre fine, a few deaths in survival never hurt anyone.
---
Yeah man, Hemlock Holes Maintenance for the Anglers, right? They produce more acid that the collectors - their max is 10 I believe. They're usually only level 9 for me as well
---
Welcome to earth!
---
Were people sitting on the fence? There is a long lasting issue where the queen gets aggroed to fence-sitters, she can't find a path to them so it flies away to safety, usually out of bounds. Few times, she flew towards the center of the map.
---
I had seen this many times but we managed to get her back. Usually I run after her which makes the fence-sitters come down from the fence and that makes the queen turn around. I suggest you get the attention of such players by shooting them in pacifist mode with an explosive weapon and emote come here (or simply chat/voicechat them to come down).
---
Yeah, I had taken maybe 5 during my first 15 levels, but then I got one hit when I took over Poseidon. I've done it only twice since then (mostly for plans) and I totally hide nearby when I do.
---
Thanks!
---
Tea Time and Campfire Tales events are okay for getting ants.
---
Dont waste your points in a second type of weapons. I would go with non automatic rifle (and the skills dedicated to it) + high perception due to it + high luck and agility for V.A.T.S.. All that compared gives you my first character and in general the first character I always create in such a game.
---
You will use a lot of V.A.T.S. together with crits every like 2 shots that hit. Sneaking is also necessary, because you wont have much HP.
---
maybe you should turn your game unit off and go into the real world. 4-5 days a week 3-4 hours a day?
---
I already think it takes too long by lasting 7 minutes... and 5 of wich are waiting for the next round ... I would keep it at 7 mins, fix the spawn rate to be more consistent and always make a 1 2 and 3 star enemy appear instead of random, also the loot of those legendaries would be distributed in the end of the event as a 3 legendaries reward for the player. That way people can actually focus on keeping the machines running... until the end
---
If it has a star next to the name then it should count but if it just saids legendary then it doesnt
---
So you don't preference functional hats over COOL HATS.
---
How did you accidentally press the button specifically made for attacking?
---
-Walks down street, sees cat.... KICK!-
---
‚ÄúHOLY SHIT THAT CAT CAME OUT OF NO WHERE AND I ACCIDENTLY KICKED IT!!
---
Thanks, glad I'm not starting to imagine things from too many blows to my unprotected head O.o 
---
But how dumb not to have resists on something that would give a resist irl, even 1 even just army &amp; combat helmet? I'll never understand what goes through the heads of those at Bethesda smh.
---
Why have them just as cosmetics, it is odd.
---
If you are completely alone and nobody else around, it is most likely due to disagreement between the server and client about your stealth status. I get this a lot when I do basic stealth shooting, my screen says \[Caution\] but only half of the shot damage is acknowledged (i.e., the non-steath amount).
---
If they were functional everyone would have to wear helmets to stay competitive and all cosmetic head items would go unused, this way people can look a little bit more unique and still be on a level field.
---
First build was shotguns, I know the crippling power. It is indeed pretty hilarious seeing an entire pack of glowers on the ground but not dead. I remember my first Legendary shotgun. Executioner Combat 1* lol.
---
I think you're overestimating how much it keeps to upkeep heavy weapons. Grinding out SBQ, yes. But just dicking around casually? Not really a big issue in my experience. It's more a "ever couple days" thing, not a "every couple hours". Personally, repairing is a non issue cause of the free IRKs the Scorched Earth drops, so it's just the ammo. Most of which you can farm while farming other things, but I'm getting off topic here.
---
I'll again agree that crippling is important, on big boss monsters (SBQ, Alphas, Imposter). I can't see the importance on other mobs. Even MQs and SBs just melt to optimized builds before it's relevant. Even *half* a dozen shots should do it if it's a lower level SB.
---
Honestly, I'd rather carry around a Cryolator to freeze the SBQ, than a shotgun to cripple. Which I do, despite not using it as often as I should. Switching back and forth even with a hotkey is pretty tedious. When I do bother with it, it honestly feels better than cripple, in some ways. Of course, cripple has advantages. You only need to cripple her twice per fight, and shells are less painful to farm than cryo. You're potentially even using your main gun the entire time, if you main shotguns.
---
If we're talking accessibility for new players, if we're still on that topic, Heavy and Melee pivot nicely into one another. I've got a 1lb knife for mobs that aren't worth the ammo, and all it takes to use is slotting my gunner perks for Incisor 3 and rank 2 if each gladiator. Shotguns can do this too, but rifles struggle to since, if I'm not wrong, they usually have much less strength than you'd probably need. (Though, I think it's unfair to not note that the bowie knife without perks is often just enough for low tier mobs due to being bloodied. I could imagine anyone using it for 'trash control'. The perks just let you OHKO stuff like lvl 47+ scorched with a Power Attack). 
---
A corner case I want to mention just cause it's really funny to me, not because it's viable for most players. It's definitely not. If you're fortunate enough to have an explosive harpoon, that's probably the most economical firearm in the game lol. (If you're not aware, it literally generates ammo when you shoot bodies with it. You have to make 1 harpoon ever as long as you don't miss a lot)
---
About the end comment, definitely not trying to argue rifles are not viable. I don't know if that's been clear. The only class I don't think is endgame viable is Pistols.
---
War. War never changes.
---
The PvP mechanics in this game are pretty average but if you're playing in Adventure just don't take workshops or shoot back at other players. 
---
Unfortunately workshops are PvP hotspots, which usually doesn't end well for the owner. 
---
But if you couldn't contest workshops then 1 player could control them all and no one could take them.
---
Well, gotta get that scrip. And if you‚Äôve got a short time to make your caps for the day, it‚Äôs a short overloaded walk to drag every dam gun the mile miners drop down to the Whitesprings station, not to mention the glowing steaks.
---
Yeah you know how bethesda is, they fixed a different bug and in doing so caused another (resist to show on headgear) ...which they than fixed the following patch lol.
---
Anyway, yeah i agree. Headgear should totally have resist to it. Doesn't quite make sense to me that it doesn't. Which is why many were thrilled that it showed resist, we all assumed it was a new feature or improvement to the game. Imagine our surprise to later find out it was just a bug and removed shortly after.
---
dont give a monkeys what it looks like. I would like it to perform like it says on the tin.
---
still wear the combat helmet tho, gives my that false sense of security.
---
cheers
---
It messes with Berserker's (which requires absolutely 0 DR to reach max potential), so this is a good thing.
---
Exactly. I prefer it the way it is.
---
I am currently 3 / 5. And killed many Legendary tagged enemies, one the one with stars count though. And the challenge isn't even challenging.
---
This week will be worse all around. At least until most people finish their challenge.
---
It's an option. The vendor already exists, no reason why its inventory can't be improved a little bit.
---
Sigh... i just assumed that was normal and how it works lol....
---
I tried using it and didn't like how it snapped to wall so decided not to use it.
---
Thoughts on what causes it? I might mess with it some more and see if i can get it working properly then.
---
I can't wait for all the text-art dickbutt and pepe notes, lol.
---
Just server hop, problem solved.  I'm 120 and still have some annoyances with them, it's easier to "walk away".  If you're on Xbox I know you can block them for the session and they vanish and it's much more peaceful.
---
"Are you fucking sorry!"
---
Here you go. Didnt include mutations though. If you want mutations, like Hawk Eye, you need to remove something from luck

 I forgot you could server hop,  I‚Äôm on playstation and I blocked him for the session (or ignored?) it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything though.

Interesting idea, this sound like it would definitely add to the survival aspect of the game. 
---
They already have the "Verdant" season feature going, but not nearly as comprehensive as what you suggested. I would definitely like to see them expand on it.

Every time I run it everyone waits till everyone else has had a shot at the legendary, most use the come here emote to call ppl in. Last run there was a guy one shorting the normal mole miners and every time the legendary spawned he'd just sit there ant wait till it was down to half health after the heal be shooting it I'm on pc too.

I'm on PS4 and that happens sometimes and it's awesome when it does, but not everyone behaves that way.
---
Yup. They were level 15, so I chewed right through them. I fast travelled back in when i got the notice of a "defend your workshop" event, and there were like 15 of em in wave 1 of 4. pretty crazy.
---
sick shirt, is it made of nylon?
---
Definitely seen a few posts from other offering services for bounty. Would really help if you included platform,  pc, xbox, ps4?
---
Cut those prices down about half, now we're talkin' business.
---
I have a mic but it's not on unless I'm teamed so you wouldn't notice.  No one needs to listen to me mumbling as I get lost in the Mire AGAIN.  Oscream as I round a tree into Sheepy's back.
---
Shit happens
---
Actually they just lowered it for turrets, but that was a while ago. Lights and walls remain the same, I don't know where did that guy got info about that =)
---
You can‚Äôt kill anyone under level 5 regardless of whether you‚Äôre in survival or adventure, so either you‚Äôre telling a porky for some likes or it was a level 5 (flipped 2, easy to mistake) and you were both on survival.
---
Guess I've gotten lucky as it's only happened once, though I would love if some level 30's learned how the Imposter Sheepy event worked so I stopped getting tagged by her (like seriously people, if I'm man I g pylons I can't do that while running from a crazy bitch).  ONE guy one shorted the Wendigo in campfire tails, which I kinda want to know how as not even my Guass can do that (thankfully for my fellow players I'm sure), but overall, everyone's put away the big guns unless we're at Scorched Earth.
---
That would help. 
---
On PC.
---
There are legendaries EVERYWHERE you don't need to screw over other players in events to get it.
---
Did they change that since the release of survival? I used to fast travel to stations I found in adventure mode.
---
Planted as in general stuff? No. Lock picking gets you wanted. Planted as in actual plants? That‚Äôs fine and won‚Äôt get you wanted.

It was working 2 days ago for me, didn't change character since then. But if you wish I can check in 5 hours

Thank you this helps a lot!

Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!

Got mine yesterday from Graham ? (the travelling Super Mutant trader)
---
I was wandering through morgantown airport once, when iwas probably lvl 50 or so. 
---
I heard someone screaming on area chat, so i went to investigate. it was this level 5 or 10 newbie, running around in his tighty whities, getting his ass handed to him by a pack of ghouls. 
---
I dispatched them, and stuck around to see if I could lend assistance by way of free ammo or weapon upgrades or something. turns out dude was probably all of 12 years old, and narrated the game nonstop. like.. "oh, this container has stimpacks. I like stimpacks. oh and some buffout. i could probably use that. do you think it'll make my dick hard? can I dickwhack some ghouls with it? can you change your name in this? I want to change it to Dickwhacker of Ghouls" just neverending. 
---
kid was kind of a riot. then he dropped like 50 fusion cores when I said I had to get out of my armor. :o I didn't ask why such a low-level character had so many fusion cores. it definitely wasn't a mule. I babysat him through the toxic goo room in west tek and when I left he had something like 500 toxic goo. "I'm going to rub this all over my body and become TOXIC GOOOOO MAAAAAAN"
---
tl;dr mumbling is ok by me.
---
Legendary weapons/armour should have no place in survival. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
So no stars didn't work and you've only tried it on 3*s but you're setting up a post here telling us 1 and 2* don't work. I love people that go right onto reddit to post shit they didn't think about first
---
Haven't seen that dude since like 2018. And I make a point to stay on the roads to increase my chances of running into him.
---
I had 25k caps burning a hole in my pocket... if they had something I wanted I would have bought it... 8k for your 3* bloodied LAR... kerching... 3k for your 3* sentinel armour... done deal... you want to wall me into you locked room... your loss, someone else's gain.
---
I love when people buy but then I have that "crap, gotta go restock" moment and I'm always across the map and loaded to the gills (why yes, I am a hoarder who picks sites clean of anything not nailed down...).  Thankfully ammo seems to be my biggest seller, which is abundant (though never when you need it...)
---
I mean, he speaks the truth. A Reddit post isn‚Äôt going to change the nature of humanity.
---
*worked i read that they patched it out of the game recently
---
Needs a big buff. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually seen anyone use one. Even fully upgraded it‚Äôs like launching water rockets, but when an enemy has one it‚Äôs something to fear.
---
That was the reddit equivalent of a 'Butt dial'. Sorry buddy.

this seems to be the holy grail of roleplaying for a lot of people! :D

Nothing beats killing the SBQ and getting a 1 Star knuckle duster, lol.

Well where are the Raiders??

Nice cul-de-sac =)

It is a shame especially given how heavy both the launcher and missiles are, I don't understand the thought process on this.

The last season of GOT *did* kinda feel like it was written by Emil Paliarugo.

i guess the timing is bad 
---
usually around this time the reddit seems to be at its lowest i recognized it when i traded you might have more luck trying it again in a few hours

also i think there are subreddits for fo76 factions your best chance would probably to look out for a raider faction and contact them directly üëçüèº

If you go to a train station in adventure mode then swap to survival mode you can discover it. Then swap back to adventure mode and discover the rest. You start fresh from the vault when you go into survival ( with a new character ) with no locations discovered.
---
Not true, my 5th kill was 1\* Legendary sheepsquatch from Mire Free Range event.
---
I'm conflicted. That sucks, because the Whitespring vendors have been a lifesaver for me several times, but on the otherhand glowing ghoul xp and legendaries. I do understand your pain, I'm lvl 30 and only just found a hazmat suit, so WS became a no-go zone several times a day until today.
---
I got my Cargobot pic from the event in Morgantown Airport, can't remember the name right now, the one where you fight of a few waves of Scorched and upon completion a Cargobot delivers some goodies. Easy to get up, close and personal with it at that point to snap the pic.
---
The vertibot I just went to the other airport and the owner had kindly repaired the Vertibot on site - the one that is part of the defenses of the workshop - so just walked up to it and snapped a pic.
---
I surmise you can do the same with any workshop that has vertibots - power plants, ammo factory...
---

there are lighter build and ulltra-light mods but there is also light armor plans (i only got these recently)

I‚Äôd love to have settlement pieces that are walls with a tree smashed through them. Failing that, I‚Äôd just settle for walls with some crater damage, buckled steel or collapsed bricks. They really need window pieces with wood boards stuck over the broken panes, too. You see them all the time on houses in the game, but can‚Äôt use them yourself.

I got mine from Watoga train station. 3 plans total (1 torso, 1 legs, 1 arms), 1500 ish caps eatch.
---
Oh nice one! Got the same headset, it‚Äôs awesome. ‚ÄúHeadset connected. Battery mediummmm‚Äù
---
This is correct.

Until recently, I only had Light and Heavy Torso's

IIRC, Responder Vendors have them, THINK I saw them at the Fire station. If you're still needing them.

---
Lucky Hole spawns ants, if you're lucky.
---
Tea Time spawns ants often when it feels like spawning mobs at all
---
Project Paradise has ants in the venison room regularly.
---
Campfire Tales is the most reliable source of ants for me. Purposefully taking Wet Kindling during the gathering phase spawns at least one usually, and up to three. Then if your end phase is the defend from insect waves, shit man. If you use a tesla to tag everything, even discounting Butchers Bounty, you get enough ant meat to make about a dozen lagers. If you somehow don't disintegrate any ants, you're in the money, cause you can BB every one of them if you're quick enough to get them before they meat pile.
---
I've done quite a bit of hiding away on Survival the last few days, getting shot in the face whenever I waved at anyone so not bothering anymore, and I can echo your note about getting to the top of the board just by keeping away from everyone for a while and how few people seem to be playing it. I left and joined the same world around three or four times across an evening, all the same names, when I took breaks in Adventure to restock and safely harvest food and ammo. I think the issue is people are just treating it like a Deathmatch mode, more than once my map showed a dozen red skulls around player #1, not bothering with Events (because lets face it, that many people gathering around an NPC-bot is just asking for a mininuke or nukanade), and when you are never getting chance to use Inspirational and no one is nuking anything that 20% extra xp suddenly looks far less impressive.

Well, then I know where I will be server-hopping monotonously for the next few days...lol
---
How would said raider group ensure they end up on the  same server as the target, as they happen to take a workshop (opening them up to pvp) or be in Survival mode?
---
I use a one shot gun and I'm not like this. It's so easy to just keep a tesla in my back pocket for group events like this.
---
I agree with each of your points though. It'd be more fun and rewarding if the enemies weren't all lvl 40 hunchbacks shouting "WUTDAFUG"
---
I'd honestly settle for lvl 50 hunchbacks shouting "FUGADAYUU"
---
I am seeing it happen too, all the time with 95% chance.
---
Im tired of getting XCOMed and rolling my eyes
---
I can provide details on how to get on the same server to the person or group who take the contract. 
---
The targets will be taking workshops.
---
Anything in there that I can‚Äôt learn from the wiki or reddit for free, or is it more of a ‚Äòcollectors‚Äô item?
---
Haha, ikr. If you are xbox and want a piece nodding while you wait to find it. I'm happy to
---
I‚Äôd keep both but the bloodied lever is worth tons of caps on the market and would get you a lot of trades
---
I did a supply requisition, you literally need to be 2 feet from the cargo bot to register it on the camera, still
---
Working on getting the vertibot
---
Grenade launcher, fat man, and missile launcher all need significant damage and durability buffs.
---
And what outcome are you looking for? What will give you satisfaction?
---
I've only just ordered mine but reviews say it's a little out of date. Wiki's def better but I know my old 90s Prima guides are real collector's items now so probably that yes.
---
Cool thanks for letting us know
---
If I do sell it how much you think I should price it at the bloodied lever
---
There's an easy way to get the picture.
---
Remember the US government supply requisition holotapes ? You can use that holotape at a emergency broadcast terminal at any relay tower to summon a government vetibot drop. Once you loaded the holotape into the terminal, it'll automatically marks the drop area on your map.
---
More than welcome.

Take Wade airport and go to the northeastern end, there is a pad. Repair it and a Veribot will appear.

Jump off the roof at WhiteSprings and land next to one of the robots, they go mental on you.  Pain Train also works well if you run and bump a robot.
---
Maybe 13.5k+ but auctioning is always good to see the general price but I‚Äôd keep it and trade for a Gun you‚Äôd actually use, don‚Äôt want to like interfere but I might trade with you if your looking to trade itüòÇ
---
Done! Thx
---
Event legendaries should be lootable for everyone in the event regardless of who killed it, possibly also adding a marker.
---
No, you just dont have the materials you need to repair....
---
At a weapons bench you inspect and then select workbench repair. It‚Äôs a little clunky.
---
Actually one of the reasons I sort of stopped doing events in general. 1. if I own a shop and have pvp enabled I always forget to turn it to pacifist and end up tagging someone and getting rocked before I can say " I'm sor" the the other is just the shear number of times I have done the events along with the fact I know I probably wont get the only weapon in the game left for me. I currently run a 1 star vamp gat laser and would like a 3 star vamp gat laser. however if that never happens I am ok with it. so not much motivation to really go to the events for legendaries. I am full of caps, and nothing more to spend my caps on. so I farm fusion cores hop around and look at hings and help randoms players with some of my wealth from time to time.
---
Apart from Demo Expert I don't think the GL is effected by any other perks? I tried heavy weapons and iirc my 2 shot one's damage was unaffected.
---
This is completely intentional so that enemy are able to damage your camp.
---
There's no way this lever action is worth 13.5k you're pulling my leg right? üòÇ
---
Choose workbench repair not repair kit.
---
Got this one too. Was burned so badly im suprised i wasnt turned into a scorched right then and there.
---
Oh I've got the materials, it just didn't give me an option.
---
NOOO... I got mine done by doing leader of the pack twice...  not a single 3 star killed by me and I got it finished
---
Not kidding you really, If I saw the stats correctly then a bloodied Faster Fire rate  with Faster reload is a really good gun and I sold my 2* FE one for 10k and so yeah, nice gun
---
I‚Äôm... an... idiot.... day one of playing 76 I had a friend tell me to made sure I had it turned on and I never messed with it... I legit spent an hour nearly dying to ghouls and mole rats because I didn‚Äôt remember it existed. Thank you for reminding me :D chances are I‚Äôm not going to forget that again after this.
---
It\`s the power user perk from intelligence. I tried it a couple times and it bugged my Gatling plasma to hell and back, and also bugged the other weapons. I stopped using the perk after that
---
I just whipped up a massive batch of pumpkin pie instead, but this is a good tip.
---
&gt;He just went through and destroyed every thing that I had built and then just sits there, waiting for me to try to go back to it. What a jerk. 
---
You had turrets up? Not that turrets are particularly all that useful at covering all angles of workshop contesting, they still help a tiny bit. Just a pain in the side that you can't build more of them from the free resources before having to spend your own resources to build them.
---
I never knew they were worth alot of caps and here I am sitting on it üòÇ
---
Yeah, because FFR is good with bloodied. 2best 2nd perks are FFR and explosive. But FFR pairs well with furious and bloodied because you're boosting you base dmg quite high so the higher output of dmg raises the dps even better than explosive. Pair that with faster reload. It makes that weapon quite valuable. Id say it could even go higher than 13k.
---
You could use it as a trade to get a weapon you prefer if you don't run bloodied builds
---
I found with the vertibot I had to be standing in front of it and just above it best place to do it as a little airport by Charleston.
---
Link doesn‚Äôt work for me
---
Also, the other perks on the combat rifle arent very good honestly. It would basically just be considered just 1* 2 shot
---
I'm sitting on a gold mine
---
Its really only good for 2 things. And you need a targeting chip to make it useful. 1.) Taking down cargo bots 2.) Shooting people in pvp that spam stealthboys.
---
gonna have to concur with the other scavvers here- workshops are a waste of time for steel in the amount of time to take Grafton Steel, defend it and then set everything up I would clear the raider camps at top of the world, got a legendary or two in the process, fully maxed out the caps from the vendor there and scrapped the remainder and made a couple hundred rounds of ammo with it
---
Dang, I could keep it and see how it treats me if not I can always sell it I guess
---
You can get nice 40 scrip for that combat rifle. And keep that lever!!! At least on PC its a trade only!!!
---
Thanks. I'm kind of over the Whitespring. I've gone back to playing FO4. More fun-less grind.
---
That doesn't bug me to much, it is as designed.  But when I see a 2 or 3 star icon the loot, but when I pick it up it is only 1.   Now that gives me the grumpies....
---
Keep him on Minecraft and once hes half decent at navigating and locomotion in creative get him into survival. There are A TON of transferrable skills between the two. Sure he may not fully get the concept of S.P.E.C.I.A.L of perks fully but hell be pretty ken to thhe idea of gathering resources such as food water and materials. Also minecraft requires one to obtain and store for later certain ingredients to create "endgame-esque objects, yet another concept that will transfer well to Fallout

So my best bet is to keep the lever and scrap the combat for scrip?
---
The terminology deviates from legendary mod slots, prefix, major, minor.
---
B/Q/V/TS/AA/F are the most commonly desired weapon prefixes.
---
B10 is bloodied +10%while aiming, 
---
Q25 is quad +25% firerate, 
---
VE is vampires explosive, 
---
F50 is furious +50% crit damage etc
---
Things like F2525 mean furious firerate with 25% less AP cost.
---
Then the mothman is for you what the Flatwoods Monster is for me lol
---
Take the workshop, hang out, building nothing, complete the first defend event and then FT out. Wait a few minutes and then, if the coast is clear, go back and start building.  Folks just wanting to destroy stuff will get bored if they think you just took it for the XP/drops and they leave.  The types who do this seem to have a very short attention span...

What does WTF mean?

Annnnnmmmmd another one

Kind of yeah lol

For me it's simply like a post apocalyptic western highnoon scenario.

I just came back to this game after putting about 80 hours in it since the beta, I played all those hours pretty much all in a week or so.

I started a new character and they have improved the game but there is still times where the servers crash and or lag out so bad no one can move, Shame.
---
If you paint it, someone will take it. Put a "Free Take Me" sign above it. I'll build it for ya üòâ
---
It's not really what you need, but what you pick up, keep and stash. Usually it is not that large bias but more close to 2-3x of the uniform chance on a pretty large pool (\~200) of items. For example, 5% of my ranged drops is a Gatling Gun just because I have a couple in my stash; it should be 2% if they were equally likely.
---
As for Nocturnal, I get those  between 6PM and 6AM and I can't remember getting them mid-day. So, assuming you are using the Sandman perk's night bonus in your stealth build, that's most likely why you get so many Nocturnal.
---
It was probably in survival mode, but I think all players leaving the vault have some kind of immunity still to prevent people from just camping at the Vault and killing all the new people 
---
OP‚Äôs story doesn‚Äôt make sense in several ways

I was thinking if there was a way to have 'yard sale' or something where people can set up a table and a vendor and set up together...

Claim workshop, get rewards and leave area never to come back. No PVP issue whatsoever. And turn on pacifist mode.
---
Try now, it should work okay on the website. I apparently didn't do it right for the sub.
---
i'm confused you played the game long enough to get your hands on a two shot explosive weapon but you have no knowledge on how repairing weapons work.
---
:(
---
yup. That combat isn't really good, amd weight it's important. If you mod it, it will weight more than 15 kg. But again, don't sell that bloody lever, it's a god roll item
---
Trying todo a weekly challenge and this is driving me nutty :D
---
Stealthboys and tesla rifles... i hate these people. Lol
---
I've noticed on my crit commando toon that headshots are missing more. Torso and arms are the way to go which kinda sucks.
---
Good one troll
---
I never rolled it from the purveyer lol I got it from a random 3 star üòÇ
---
Yeah of course. Bloodied builds are very powerful but you need also collect specific armor so that you don't become just a glass canon
---
[deleted]
---
Been noticing this a lot recently. Also zero star ghouls at Whitesprings dropping one star stuff. Seems odd, they've definitely changed something secretly.
---
you are almost l90 and have everything you want... MF!
---
... I am 130+ and there are still perk cards that I am collecting... not got top armour nor guns... have only 1 top tier back pack mod... can't craft lemonade... can't build robot leg armour... haven't beaten the imposter sheepsquatch... have not completed a 3 animal project paradise event... not played pvp on the survival server ( been there to get sole survivor but not played pvp )
---
Hell... this is just stuff I know I can't or haven't done... there is probably a bunch more stuff I don't know about!!!
---
I spent last night jumping out of a monorail car and being revived by a l20... then finding parts for them to complete the signal repeater quest... crafted then a set of Bos deep pocket armour to replace the l1 leather crap... and bos recon rifle as their hunting rifle sucked... showed them where to find  Ansell... had blast sniping glowing ghouls for xp in whitesprings... (sorry to the level 100+ PA melee builds that we kept stealing kills from....... nah not sorry :p !!  gotta show the kid how to snipe and he needed the xp more than you) 
---
So much you can do....
---
You should try my instigating black powder rifle, with all relevant perks &gt;600 damage and from sneak position kills everything except the biggest boss enemies.
---
That scrip part is for useless 3 star legendaries, not average or even good ones.
---
Beam focuser...and it's a must unless you are going for the plasma flame thrower.
---
HEE HEE!!
---
That's what I always do lol. Can usually kill 2-3 by the time I hit the ground with gun fu. 
---
Vats is just so satisfying in 76.
---
What armor would I be looking for?
---
100% cotton
---
Poseidon Energy Plant is better, you don't even need to take the workshop to fix the pad.
---
If you know the name of one of the other guys you can get back on the same server... Google it
---
Lacked of shared party xp is the most annoying part of the game to me.
---
Second is no perk card layout manager.
---
You know, you can NOT have a game or NOT have it installed but STILL post on THIS subbredit.
---
Yet HERE YOU ARE being A LOSER cause you WANNA be Noticed with your PATHETIC weak troll comment.
---
You don't need to take over workshops to be able to repair/spawn a vertibot, you can even do that when the workshop is claimed by someone else. Whenever this challenge is up, I just go to the Poseidon Energy workshop, repair the pad, take my picture.
---
I check these posts purely for the lols......the comments are always good
---
If you're ranged bloodied, then you want to invest in some bolstering sentinel. Bolstering providing more resistance the lower you're health, sentinel has a chance to reduce dmg while standing still. Pair that with perks like serendipity to dodge dmg while low health and nerd rage to up your dmg output at low health
---
Yeah from my thing it‚Äôs about 15-25k Caps and you got an offer for it if you want to take it
---
I am here because I am a gamer and I would rather see a feed full of game related content over cry baby ass hateful people like you, So here we are. **Eye Rolls**
---
Do the powering up Poseidon Power Plant event  claim the workshop power up the Fusion Core generator and you will get 3 fusion cores every 15 minutes make sure to lock it and collect the Fusion cores every 15  minutes  because the generator can only hold 3 then you can sell fusion cores in your camp for 50-100 caps each.  
---
This might be something you do at a level 5+  rad x and rad away will make it easier also plenty of you tube videos on powering up the plant.
---
Wow.....I honestly would never have thought of that lol I'm glad I joined Reddit you guys provide so much help
---
That LAR is shit... I'll unencumber you for 1000 caps  ;)
---
I do agree with you on the Melee portion. But you can swap out for a Bloodied Lever Action and still 2-Shot with that build. Just like with Executioner, getting the jump on your opponent is key, but then you are also relevant in other aspects of the game.
---
True, but just having bloodied on a good base weapon makes it just sooo good. Plus, martial artist gives it a very nice boost to swing speed so im not missing out on too much.
---
Yeah no
---
from social tab and join world?
---
Comedy gold
---
I'm keeping it sadly it's the only good weapon I have if I manage to get something better than it I'll sell it
---
i buy them whenever i see people selling them at their vending stations at 10 caps or less in hopes they get buffed....
---
last time i checked i had about 460 and i remember buying more after that
---
are you are about that? i have more than 460 on my character...
---
Was his name Glenn?
---
I'm glad you agree.
---
No problem, that's why we're here. Have you used the nukes and dragons perk load out? It lets you see all the perks cards (so you know what can help with a build) and perk points so you can figure out where you want all your points.
---
I wish you luck!
---
i had this problem yesterday but i managed to buy more from player vendors after that
---
Dont feel too bad. I fucking killed the lvl 1 wise mothman under a bridge in the mire. He just popped up as i was approaching the random encounter spot by harpers ferry. Needless to say i shot first and only as it died to one shot did i realise what the name actually said.........he was friggin red tho!! Tagged as an enemy!! I went and did the event "path to enlightenment" to see if we were cool. He gave me his blessing and all but he was still tagged red and was clearly not happy about my prescence at the ritual.......im thinking of changing cults to be honest. The rest of the Brotherhood are kinda looking at me sideways anyway, being the only junkie Elder ive seen around, so the mothnan thing, i feel, will probably be the straw that breaks the camels back.
---
I'm looking for a top tier bloodied LAR... when you have speed demon the reload perk star on it is wasted... and even without the mutation I'm not paying 13.5k for one...
---
üò± I got other players doing that at my place and then recently a robot spawned inside it
---
Mole Miners were once people and they love those f#cking missile launchers.
---
It kinda blows my mind really, I mean either you want to play it again or you don't.
---
I didn't know about this change. I thought it's been around since BETA
---
For me it happened once. but after wandering some time there was marker on map.. but this time... there is marked area, but i been here for 30minutes now.. and it never arrives...
---
I'm pretty sure you're exactly right on this, I remember a post a while back with a PSA on this about low level vs high level areas but also not sure if that was changed when they changed drop ownership.
---
not really, you can still buy more from player vendors
---
Speed demon doesn‚Äôt affect reload speed I don‚Äôt think
---
&gt;Fix the issues that the Pre-Order people have. All of us, supported Bethesda before the product was release and paid more than the others did for it! Examples of issues pre-order people are having are ...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Carry weight is about 200 lbs less than similar players with the same perks.  
---
&gt;Can't complete challenges because we can't discover areas ALREADY discovered!!
---
This!
---
I haven't used that at all
---
It's not going to change no matter what. They will still have them made that.
---
A Bloatfly Larva Syringer, a brahmin pen and a lot of razorgrain.
---
I have experience in software development and developer-management. There are most likely workflow, tooling or coordination problems there, which should have been worked out in a few of months after release. Yet here we are 6 months in and we don't get weekly patches on PC even.
---
Play Cod WW2
---
I agree it's rather dumb, I made the mistake of placing a track light next to a foundation.. I'm not moving my base to get rid of it.
---
NSFW ? where is the nudies
---
Maybe when/if they release the mailbox thing
---
You can also use the Vertibot on the helipad at Poseidon Energy Plant :) It respawns pretty frequently.
---
Hahahaha they made a wiki for these people. That is gold
---
On PS, once you‚Äôre in the repair screen, you‚Äôd hit triangle to use a repair kit, but square to do a workbench repair. If you don‚Äôt have the materials, workbench repair will be grayed out.
---
Ok. It didn't even give me an option for a regular repair.
---
Not sure how long you've been using a plasma gat but it's advisable to never reload until a core has been fully depleted. You'll end up with 30 cores with only a few shots each.
---
just play the game.....pro tip: eat one cranberry relish every hour and get plenty of rest.
---
I don't think some of these players give a care about their camps especially when they have it as a shop for other players. Well hopefully things go well for you.
---
Snipers generally like to use a handmade rifle, lever action, gausse, combat rifle, or a hunting rifle. Each has their fans (especially for the first three), but at higher levels it often comes down to what legendary drops for you (or that you purchase/trade from someone). Bloodied is a legendary weapons prefix that allows you to do more damage the lower your health. People generally  use a combination of perks, mutations, and certain mechanics (e.g.,get high rads to take their health bar down to 30% or less) to make this work well. It's a really powerful build but it's not for everybody (including me). I run a stealthy build and it generally works well for me, but it's a bit inconsistent. Super mutants, mole miners, and even scorchbeasts have a hard time spotting me. Ghouls on the other hand can often spot me quickly, especially in interiors when they spawn in bunches (e.g. the golf clubhouse and Fort Defiance).
---
This one is super long too. Didn't read it. Just scrolled down to make sure the rest of us were on the same page. üòÜ
---
Congrats! I have gave up when I could not fixed pipes related sth. in nuke silo.. those damned robots.. And do not care anymore :)
---
Why didn't you message him afterwards?
---
If I was starting out and saw a cheaply priced weapon that I could scrap for mods then I'd buy it. You know, weapons like handmades and lever actions that are harder to find. Took me ages to mod my handmade, and as soon as I did they made the plans available for all lol.
---
That does make sense actually, makes outfits cleaner and shan't affect other stats.
---
1st Rule: never get the Server Wet  ( it will multiply)
---
2nd Rule: Don't feed it after midnight 
---
3rd Rule: Watch Gremlins
---
It‚Äôs a low chance and it needs to be a random spawn
---
Lmao I love this comment, it‚Äôs not that btw I just thought we all had different servers based on region and that‚Äôs why teams had to leave one world to join their friends üòÇ
---
I thought pvp can‚Äôt initiate for eighternparty or person unless both are level five or higher
---
Jesus there‚Äôs another one, let‚Äôs send them to the wiki page. Again.
---
It was on PC
---
Curious. I almost only ever get contested when I'm actually in the workshop, so the guy doesn't have to track me down to gank me.
---
&gt; You left because of the lack of NPCs. They are, as of this writing, still not in the game. They may never be.
---
I hate that this myth is still perpetuated. 
---
There are a whole host of NPCs. Some even interesting ones like Rose, the scout masters, Grahm, the Insult Bot (personal MPV) just to name a few. Every single character that isn't a player (or enemy creature if you wanna make that distinction) are NPCs. MODUS, NPC. All the vendor bots, NPCs. BIV and the Purveyor - NEW! NPCs.
---
There are just no HUMAN NPCs.
---
u/lamarcs, maybe some clarification in your otherwise very useful guide would be nice.
---
Bethesda didn't make them do anything. They choose to be dicks.
---
Are you PC?
---
Sounds like he worked for materials, they just happened to be your materials. 
---
If we have learned anything from the start if player vending its: Stash your shit!
---
It was a random spawn I did pacify it but no indication to send him to my camp appeared
---
If sold at least three of them...and I'm at the whitesprings train station w/uranium fever just up the hill!
---
Good. Enemies attacking your structures just annoying, nothing else.
---
That's really cool, i built something similar once, have to try again :D
---
I heard deathclaws have to be walked up to for the tame message now. Haven't checked myself yet
---
You played around Xmas holidays and jumped on a big carnival on the map? Do you guys celebrate Christmas in March?
---
Since the aktos pharma update
---
And it doesn't crash the game? wow
---
Ah a fellow Brotherhood soldier who believes in the Holy Moth. Hail to you Elder, may the Wise Mothman bless your soul. Uh even though you accidentally killed one of its babies!
---
You Xbox? I'm 2nd in command of a Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel (Xbox) Discord. Kinda small at the moment.
---
Anyways yeah... I accidentally killed a Rabbit awhile back, was in my T-60, jumped from a ridge-line to get evade a Super Mutant kill-squad that was after me, turns out after I dropped to the ground I heard a squeak and saw a dead Rabbit, saw a live one close by and I immediately ran away 'cause I didn't want to feel more guilty for accidentally squishing it's mate.
---
If you raise your intelligence high (unyielding, bobblehead, chems, broiled scorchbeast brain) and craft them it gives you a higher charge yielding more ammo. This is also true when you craft fusion cores.
---
I play in 1st person so don't see what the characters wearing, I wear items for the effect they bring to the build. Now I needn't bother carrying about head wear except a gas mask for certain areas.
---
Damn raiders
---
Must have been a lvl 20 and not a lvl 2
---
Dear diary
---
In hind sight I think I just now got the gist of your comment üò¨ 
---
From the looks of it, you were being sarcastic and cynical possibly but you completely missed your mark. First of all, I know how big the world is and obviously it doesn‚Äôt stop when I close my eyes. Secondly, I too was being sarcastic but I didn‚Äôt full understand your comment until I had some sleep. And Finally, I thought servers were based on region so, bite me. üôÑ
---
When linking to reddit you don't need anything before the r/
---
I have done it totally alone several times this month. Certain times of the day the servers are just crowded. (After school, later at night)
---
Playing during weekdays rocks.
---
Yes I am one of those hoarders who pickup everything and constantly is overweight and maxed on my stash. This did lower my weight by about 150lbs. So I was able to cash in my 1000 script for 5 crappy 3 star weapons.
---
This is my favorite üëèüèª
---
That sounds irritating.
---
Yeah at least the last time I played with others everyone was waiting for me to finish them with melee.  The explosive one shot crowd was very polite.
---
I love Fallout. It's my favorite game. If you expected a game with no bugs or very few bugs, I do not recommend a Bethesda game. 
---
Here is my opinion. If you didn't really care for it before, you will likely give up on it again. That's okay, because you CAN actually pick this game up anytime without missing out on everything. 
---
My ask is this. Don't ask other people if the game is worth picking back up and playing again. If you have played this game before, only you will know that, because although changes happen, it's still the same game, and it's still going to by buggy because it's Bethesda. 
---
But hardcore Bethesda fans like myself look past many of the ongoing issues, and may even find some of the quirks endearing. I'm glad people gave up on the game early on. Let them have (Insert Battle Royale Title Here) or (Insert Trendy Flavor-of-the-Month Title Here). People who played Skyrim LOVED that game, but they also remember Dragon Skeletons following you around the map, among other epic glitches. It also had VERY LONG PATCHES of boring nothingness and repetitive actions.
---
My guess is the game you left Fallout 76 for in the first place is either completed, super-repetitive, or too grindy. Welcome back! Changes were made! Still the same game.
---
If they had a potential for a legendary high level players would bully low levels out of them. Bad game design.
---
Counter strike also
---
They were quick to fix that, yet I still cant melee vats any flying enemy üòñ
---
If they think that's a viable option, **they're gonna have a bad time**
---
Anyone tried pacify in this place?
---
I had trouble for months, but today tamed  lvl 16 Yao Guai for my camp. It immediately left and killed the brahmin when someone triggered the ‚Äúfree range‚Äù event that was at least 200m away... heads up.
---
You're put in unswitchable Pacifist mode until level 5, but you can definitely be killed with pacifist mode on. I tried to sneak attack someone with it on. Did absolutely nothing to them and got the standard "Pacifist mode on, numbnuts" message
---
An overpriced death trap at that.
---
Haha, sounds dirty. " I gave her the ol knuckle duster" ü§£
---
I am and i play almost exclusively at night or week days due to my job. It seems the same as other times.
---
He just wanted a free nuke and not use a card.  Oh well.  They should really just make it so whomever swipes the card only can access the keypad, unless you're part of the same team.  Maybe try Project Paradise next weekend - from a legendaries perspective it has better rewards.
---
Sorry so much went so wrong... I blame pants guy too
---
I usually look for new players that may need help and give them a hand.
---
Actually, I mostly wanted to share a little story. But apparently nobody read more than the headline...
---
He probably spawned in stuck somewhere.

ign: wellibootz

everyone should have one!!
---
On Xbone. I love the chainsaw, i have found and scrapped so many i can make both dual and bow bar..... still have yet to unlock flamer and i buy up those mods whenever i find one.
---
I have two so you won't have to fight with the other guy :)
---
Nothing has changed. Stay with Fortnite. Leave Fallout with me.
---
The substation near whitesprings has them often, or try autumn acre cabin, investigators cabin, lost home I've seen them there pretty consistently.

Chillllll ü¶ëü¶ëü¶ë

Was being silly, lol. Looks like I hit my mark with a few fellow updooters ;p
---
Hope you get some sleep soon! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The zero star ghouls dropping items I can get behind as it's a nice surprise haha however not when I'm expecting a good loot after putting effort in. :-(
---
Moist.
---
Dang. I bet you made his day lol
---
I have those hoarding problems as well lol
---
This has taught me to weary of suspicious looking camps. Always take a peep through the door before you enter. Is it an automatic door? Do you see a way to open the door from the other side? Is there an elaborate wiring job? 
---
Its CQB people. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act.
---
We're all very proud of you.
---
Yep happening to me now too since last update
---
Earff*
---
nice gonna send a friend ivnt 
---
ign DVW
---
I think he's referring to Camden.
---
No way. Totally disagree. Lower levels need to know the pain we endured early on. 800lb stash is honestly good enough. I would be fine leaving it that way. But to increase it, that should cost the most
---
Don't use those mutations man - its just not worth it.  But yeah some people are just worthless tools.
---
Might be that then :D
---
This is why. I remember back when people were first starting to farm whitespring, everyone would try to build defensive structures to lure the mass of ghouls to. We figured out pretty quickly that a single foundation doesn‚Äôt cut it. 
---
It also allows the player a little more freedom when it comes to camp building. Even if you can‚Äôt fit stairs in for whatever reason, you can always climb the foundation into your house. Less of a problem these days with all the building tweaks, but it helped a lot previously.
---
Rather extreme punishment for over-sleeping.
---
I think he meant the actual weight not the class. They indeed do not benefit from Normal/Expert/Master Gunner. They benefit from Bear Arms though, and Stabilized(maybe?)
---
The way I‚Äôm interpreting your post is that if I take a character who has all the locations discovered on adventure but has never been into survival, that character would need to rediscover all the train stations on survival to fast travel to them, but that isn‚Äôt how it is. If you discover them on adventure you discover them on survival. Everything about your character is the same on both modes.
---
Unless you mean that starting a new character from scratch on a survival server means you‚Äôd need to find all the stations but that‚Äôs the same for adventure so I‚Äôm still confused...
---
I trap people all the time but never take bags. Just trying to keep things interesting out there :)
---
Hell, it used to not benefit from rifle perks at all!
---
LOL, that's hilarious. I'm gonna try to cargo bot thing later.
---
See, there I was taking Lucille out on a hot steamy date when some blue balled prick in tights just had to run right into her. You KNOW how I don‚Äôt like to be interrupted when I‚Äôm with my lady. Some people just can‚Äôt keep their head on straight.
---
I‚Äôve certainly noticed the Gauss Rifle suffers from this more often than other guns.
---
Very few haters in this thread. Sounds like a real issue!
---
I can‚Äôt say for sure about jumping, but the whole displacement thing is an interesting theory!
---
Seriously though, you probably have Asperger's and not ADHD.
---
I'm going to put my money on Yongyea. 
---
I believe he's also the very same person you reference regarding the Unstoppables issue.
---
Cool
---
Hey guys, tomorrow is my turn to post this topic, respect the line...
---
Yongyea. An instigating youtuber.
---
That name rings a bell. I think I remember his name having been referenced in connection to that Unstoppables imbroglio when I saw other people discussing it at the time as someone who was particularly cynical and mendacious in his approach to the topic.
---
All the issues started when they made the survival server just another adventure mode with worse rewards. The ‚ÄúPVP‚Äù community feels like they have nothing to do, so they turn to annoying people. 
---
Make survival Rust! Drop everything on death, lootable stash boxes, and increase Camp strength by 10x :) I‚Äôd play that :)
---
Shiskebob
---
What for? People suck and my city is boring. If I'm not at work I'm with my wife and kids, when they go to bed I play.
---
Don't forget to set up a couple of sirens before leaving.
---
Always good to be cautious. Will never enter a camp overhanging a cliff without getting into power armour first. Same too blindly entering what I'm guessing is a powered door?
---
I mean they have every right to be, it‚Äôs false advertisement
---
Welcome to the internet. I ordered the power armor edition and I was not upset about the controversy. Its amazing how I few hate filled people can ruin things that a majority of the people like.
---
Yes, I shared a little story.
---
You didn‚Äôt bother reading it, but still felt the need to shit about it.
---
Well done‚Ä¶
---
Go play fo4. This is a multiplayer game where interactions with players good or bad are part of the game. ‚ÄúHe one shot me after i accidentally meleed him,‚Äù he came and destroyed my workshop,gtfo with your whining about bad experiences when you initiated all of it
---
It's semi-random, I bought the heavy combat armor plans (for all parts) from the vendor in Whitesprings just a week ago, so it's definitely possible to get it there. Keep trying. :)
---
Some troubleshooting tips:
---
\- Limit the CPU affinity to 2-4 cores only,
---
\- Reduce the GPU/VRAM frequency by 50-100 MHz,
---
\- Quit the launcher and as many background programs as you can.
---
[Hey, what do you know? You're right](https://imgur.com/a/5QqyOON). And it's even the exact same guy that was responsible for the last such incident. 
---
It's really laughable how all these people who are utterly unaffected by this game in any way can all be motivated to be so upset by it in such a predictable, sheep-like manner by such a nakedly crass exploitation like this.
---
You get two options when its possible to tame, pacify and taming!
---
Here the rules for it:
---
It has to be a random encounter, not a set spawn.
---
It has to spawn solo, not in a Group or in a fight.
---
It needs to be halve or less than halve of your Level.
---
You need 6 Charisma (that one might not be true)
---
You need 10% of free Budget in your camp since it will take up that space.
---
I've noticed that as well. I've also noticed that 9/10 there's a nugget with a insane weapon one-shotting the legendaries before I can get near them. For the record, I can also one-shot them but try to let everyone get a hit. Switch to a 10mil you arse!
---
I play in first too, but I still wear COOL HATS.
---
Haha love it. Wish there were more people doing this doing of stuff. Would liven the game up a bit.
---
Cool. Won't be online for a few few hours yet.
---
Agreed. The fact that they said ES6 will be played for a decade gives me some hope.
---
With those kinds of numbers you wouldn't need to build the resource collectors. Don't the anglers drop about 8 acid each as well? I've got a character with a ton of ore that needs smelted but acid is slow to collect, might just claim the shop and defend it every time
---
I've had Radscorpions to defend against too often though. Burrowing nuisances
---
Welcome to the next generation, where all gods right in front of you on black screens and tell you what todo!
---
I'd argue that people who never bought the power armor edition - and I guarantee you that 99.9% of the people behaving as though they're upset about it - don't have a right to be upset. It's all performative: I'd wager that they're not actually upset at all; they're just excited about the chance to be a part of a self-righteous mob denouncing a common object of hate and ridicule. It's one of the uglier and most easily-manipulated parts of human nature.
---
So, we're you in survival? If you weren't then he wouldn't be able to just kill you like that.
---
They're usually available in Watoga Station for me.
---
No I meant as a fresh character. Easiest way would be to go in adventure, then swap to survival to discover location if you don‚Äôt want to PvP so early in the game. ( you can‚Äôt PvP til level 5 anyways ) If you are using a existing a character then all the locations you‚Äôve discovered are still in survival just grayed out expect for fast travel-able locations which would have the usual yellow border around it.
---
Sure, it is false advertising and ya know what? Most of the people who bought it wanted the helmet, not a storage bag. Besides that, anyone who stores it in either bag and expects it not to get damaged is an idiot. I don't even care about the bag. Mine is on display with a custom helmet stand in a protective case.
---
you accidently hit someone, they have every right to attack you back. 
---
thats like saying oops sorry i hit you with my car, sorry champ looks rough and not offering any apology. Play in pacifist. leading enemies to your camp is tough luck, install some turrets
---
you shouldnt be taking workshops at all if you cant deal with pvp, theyre one of the few ways to pvp in this game, and you shouldnt call this guy a loser because your salty and need to git gud. people arent tryhards for having good builds and destorying you in pvp. you are just bad at the game
---
You should! We gotta rebuild America
---
Hahahaha. I came across the same dude I think. You go to look at his vending machines, turn around and the doors closed with a switch on the wall. When you hit the switch the flame traps kill you. People like him are why I never check camps with junk on me.
---
Or how bout they change other events to include legendaries, so it's not one central location.
---
Screenshot.
---
Its a trap at times - they want to get people mad at them so you'll engage them in PvP, then they mow you down.  This is why I'm still for fully removing PvP from adventure mode - it will keep the trolling levels down.
---
I'll do it tonight. At work now

using a good weapon in an event! what an asshole, but seriously you're no better than the people killing op after they hit them. they can still need legendarys. im level 160 and i still go run in and one tap legendarys, so i can get some scrip even though i have plenty of amazing gear
---
Given how it took over a decade to get a fix so that physics were no longer tied to FPS, I'm not that optimistic that changing time speed would work out so well. 
---
Well, not without another decade to fix that issue too.
---
Run Census Violence near Bogtown, you'll get your behemoths.
---
Just watched a couple of youtubes talking about the very subject.
---
No we weren‚Äôt in survival, part of the confusion is the how as much as the why, damn pants guy
---
Thanks, man!
---
Assassinations? Isn't that more Enclave territory?
---
You first sentence is incorrect I believe...beserkers does not nerf base damage you just don't get bonus damage if fully armored.
---
i would love to have legendary power armor, even if it's one effect max....
---
not because PA is underpowered though, i just dont want to accidentally scrap it (again)
---
Do you have to have animal Friend at lvl 3?
---
PvP is mostly off on these Survival servers you don‚Äôt have to play on. 
---
You can mitigate most of the survival elements of the game by using mostly melee weapons. No more farming for bullets!
---
As for stuff breaking, until you start getting really good gear with legendary affixes, when a piece of armor breaks just throw it out. It‚Äôs often cheaper to scavenge around to find a replacement piece than spend expensive materials repairing.
---
Perks can also help mitigate the survival elements, but know that part of the game IS scavenging and finding stuff. Enjoy it every so often!
---
r/nobodyasked
---
That‚Äôs bullshit. It‚Äôs a douche move to attack someone after you inadvertently hit them in a challenge. They need to just drop the heart symbol.
---
Yes.
---
you deserve upvotes, nobody cares op
---
Foundations have always worked that way, and it's unreasonable to expect your Camp to be invulnerable to the games enemies, that's why you have options on where to build.
---
There are lots of places on the Map where you can utilize existing Structures which minimizes the cost of repairs since they can't damage those.
---
I personally chose a very volatile area of the map where my Camp takes a regular beat down from the numerous enemies that spawn in the area, but many of those enemies are frequently legendary, so I keep repairing, and enjoy the rewards I get for braving the harsh environment.
---
The Father approves.
---
I think I ran into that camp myself, had a bunch of high priced anti armor goodness that I was debating on buying, but out came the flames, and died instantly (bloody heavy build). Game crashed and I couldn't remember whose camp it was. I really wanted to try and make a purchase before the flames got to me a second time.
---
I like the idea of that, man! I have a lot of camp ideas. Like an infinite Brahmin farm with a steel extractor, butcher's bounty, and a razorgrain farm. But yours seems like a better opportunity to socialize haha
---
I did this once uranium fever once with only two other people. The game musta glitches or something because literally dozens of mole miners spawned. The entire event they just kept coming and coming. It was fucking awesome
---
Lel cry babies on here down voting comments cause they dont like what someone else had to say. **Shrugs**
---
I don't think mods should come to 76, just because some mods can make a player overpowered.  Granted, I have close to 80 hours in the game and never once been attacked by someone whose higher level than me.  I think mods should be just for single player games,  But, that's just my opinion.
---
Lol guy uses traps that are IN THE GAME, guy falls for trap ‚Äúhe‚Äôs cheating and exploiting‚Äù  LMFAO
---
they wouldn't have to change the time speed, they can leave it as it is because it is already sped up to something like 1sec real life = 1min in-game time.
---
All it would require is for the actual days to cycle 01Jan to 31Dec and based on the in-game day depicts what the weather would be like.
---
Might i suggest a quad barrel for it as well. Lock on an spam the fire button. Lol. A good legendary, like two shot is also a plus. Its hilarious watching 8 missiles chase it down while it runs for its life.
---
Yeah, this is about as large as you get but it's a nice Town Square. The town encompasses the entire build circle too so this is as widespread as you get too. Would be able to fit more if I didn't leave the whole platform up
---
Revenant is an underdog. It‚Äôs a huge damage buff, but I wouldn‚Äôt mess with it unless you‚Äôre on a team who can reliably revive you to refresh the buff.
---
Could even put together a modpack on Minecraft that has all the mechanics fo76 has. Slowly add in each mod as they get the hang of the previous mod until he has all the skills needed to play fo76.
---
That or throw him in the deep end like I was growing up. My first game at 4 was Mario for the NES followed up by mega man, castlrvania, ninja gaiden, etc.
---
Honesty I think I was much more skilled at gaming when I was like 7 than I am now at least reaction wise, probably not strategy wise.
---
Hi and welcome back! Is this your fake account number #100? Did you get a lot of atoms from Bethesda by making these posts?
---
Todd said that at some point there may be private servers where mods are available.
---
He also hinted at a curated mod store for the game. But didn't really say anything concrete.
---
I don't think mods should be used on this game. Well after they fix the perk card loadout annoyance.
---
That's probably why I couldn't tame it I just got it to lvl 3 I'll check it out
---
Did not say he was cheating!
---
Will try it. Thanks for the comment.
---
I have the same specs and no problem. Maybe a drive issue?
---
I want Spectacle Island's build area by the end of the year
---
If your on ps4 i can craft u a full set of heavy combat armor if u provide the materials but if your looking for the plans the watoga vendor sells it. U may need to server hop alot
---
This use to happen with a 980ti I had a month ago before it died. What other drivers might you be talking about?
---
I‚Äôll try these and get back to you on the results!
---
My son just finished kindergarten and is almost 6. 4.5 to 6 is a huge difference around that age. 
---
I have to help him with quests that aren‚Äôt straightforward like getting the ID card but otherwise takes care of himself. I came home from work the other day and he was really proud to show me his x01 armor he finally collected enough materials to make.
---
It's not exactly weightless. I suggest not hording a lot of it because I had a pile of thousands that came to around 20lbs overall in stash. It may weight little but you get so much of it that it becomes very heavy.
---
This guy wants to buff two shot.
---
You may think you want that. You do not.
---
As much as I‚Äôd like all affixes to be roughly equal in power, some just aren‚Äôt. They are always going
---
To be either filler or these weird RP weapons people use for fun.
---
You don't need camp budget. You can be maxed out and still tame something.
---
.. I was under the impression that if you were the one to plop in the keycard, only you are able to dial up the code and launch?
---
Probably uranium fever.
---
 [r/nobodyasked](https://www.reddit.com/r/nobodyasked/)
---
Mainly Motherboard and gpu. I doubt its the gpu driver.
---
Yeah absolutely, I remember they talked about having private/seperate servers where you could just go ham, it would ruin the game if done otherwise 100%
---
Since when? It used to take up budget. I mean i have a Plan for wehn im back home from work then.
---
Looking for anyone who will get the job done!
---
Also they split the players depending on what ppl want to play... Leads to empty servers. Im cool with mods that dont change game play in anyway like pipboy menus and visual effects of laser guns ect.
---
Was there a switch on the wall that didn't power the door? If so I have seen this one. It has the word firesale on a wall outside in neon. The switch powers the flamers.
---
All players eventually end up with so many caps they haven't a clue what to do with them.  You can't even buy some things for 25k caps cause no one is selling them.
---
Just play the game and you'll have more caps than you know what to do with - if anything slows down caps collection its the daily 1400 limit, far too easy to hit.  I can hit that easily even during limited playtime days on at least 2 of my characters, and on weekends and such I've maxed out my 3 active characters way before I'm done playing.
---
Its so bad that people have to shut off their vending machines if they reach near max caps.  The lack of use for caps in turn creates the lack of availability of top tier goods because others will only trade them for equal value pieces since they can't spend the caps.
---
So like FiveM with GTA?
---
I've wanted to do this for forever. Not necessarily with a cargobot, but the TS launcher part lol.
---
I've got a bloodied one at least, though.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
It took longer than I'd like to admit hahahaha
---
U gave him lesson how to respawn :)

Not me but I have probably 10 between the 5 I carry and my stash. Been working on getting my Excavator Armor so I can get plans for the PA workbench so I sort all this crap out in my camp
---
Possibly.  If that's the case the person just wanted a free launch prep...  I've got into a silo that someone got disconnected from and launched using my own card (just straight past most of the prep stages but you do have to get the credentials)...  no sense is letting all that effort go fully to waste.
---
Some servers just seem to be kinder than others.... and some people are total assholes. I have only once launched a nuke once - and that was the SBQ to complete the main quest. There were 4 of us and we spent over and hour prepping! Loads of fusion cores, stimpacks, ton of ammo, 3 spare key cards, guns and armor all over repaired and planys of tasty snacks (ok- totally overprepared). We were mixed level one 50 and 3 about 120. I somehow managed to enter the code without a typo - despite proper nervousnes! Hit fussure site prime on the nose, fast travelled down to get some great photos of he bobm drop. Thankfully a good 10 more high level players came to join us and we destroyed the big bat in about 10 mins. Maybe it's a lot trickier with 2 people- I thought the robot spawns were supposed to be much lower/lesser with smaller groups.
---
Just trying to think of a reason they didn't do it in the first place.
---
He's a wizard, Harry.
---
Do you have pacifist mode on? He may have jumped in front of your line if fire if not. Only other way is if you claimed a workshop.
---
It has to be a random encounter with a solo creature, so server hop farm the random locations. Taming now requires a smaller distance between you and the target creature before you are prompted also.
---
Yeah,
---
more then a dozend replies, mostly from people telling they are not interested in the post and didn‚Äôt read it.
---
But still, you have to tell everybody how much you don‚Äôt care, instead of, well, just not caring‚Ä¶
---
Lol this guy got me too
---
I‚Äôd be okay with mods as long as they were limited to private servers. I‚Äôd also be okay if they didn‚Äôt add mods that can make you OP. 
---
But as someone with 800 hours in game and that does pvp that extra content would be sweet. I just got into a battle with a lv 573 and his 300+ buddies last night.
---
I was walking along on my own business near Vault76, when enough people left to put my 156 score butt on the top 3. Heard something run up behind me and when I saw it was a player and not a ghoul, I put my gun away. Started talking as I walked, but he followed silently for about a minute before two shotting me in the head from behind.
---
Im level 39, hes level 115, I had a screwdriver and maybe a Sootflower. Guess my hopes of Fallout 76 Survival being like original DayZ (not a free for all, but social yet intense) are gone
---
Well put, sir!
---
As with all online gaming. Its summer now but weekdays are best for almost any game!
---
Yea. 4 missiles from a bloodied will definitely get the job done. Lol
---
Why are you still here?
---
some people will do anything to avoid property taxes
---
It‚Äôs like chasing the treasure goblins in Diablo 3 haha.
---
After latest patch my game crashes once every 10-15min, often when trying to fast travel to player camps. Latest crash was bad because I clicked one camp, game crashed, and immediately I get email from Bethesda saying "Thank you for reporting a player we take all these very seriously bla bla bla..." Like now some poor guy might get temp ban because of that :(
---
It is good.  It's easily my favorite game right now.
---
rent?
---
This guy spent hundreds of hours researching this game and leads one of worlds strongest PvP teams. TS underperforms for the cost it has, and is only popular because it was super strong as TSE few months ago. Wherever aiming is important two shot sucks, for a chance to increase damage by 3rd grade buff. My suggestion keeps it sucking parameter but moves the buff to 2nd grade. If there is a drawback, it should be powerful, its not.
---
I did one pass at the Whitespring where it should have been 5, but 2 of them had no stars. Went over to Uranium Fever after and finished up.
---
I think you need to pass on this one.  It just doesn‚Äôt sound like your kind of game.
---
I think things will be pretty silent until after E3
---
I feel like 90% of the 3 stars I kill drop 1 star items. 5% drop 2 stars.
---
[Recent example for reference.](https://streamable.com/uyaan)
---
It's a real shame it happens even from Lv.100 3 star boss from new Arktos event so often.
---
Yeah, there was a bug where you learned the plan when you bought it but didn‚Äôt consume the plan. You could then drop it, let someone else pick it up, learn the mod then return it. 
---
Usually you pay 1k or something like that for the service.
---
Can't speak for IvT but I would be VERY surprised if free junk placement becomes a thing. RIP server performance.
---
Visitors will always spawn where you first placed down your camp device.
---
Unfortunately, I've never taken the time to relearn the controls for mouse and keyboard.  I'm on PC but still use the xbox controller.  Use the left bumper button for vats, right trigger to fire and reach up to Y button for criticals as they come available.  Its just not an intuitive setup.  Takes practice.  OR take the time to learn keyboard and mouse which is probably a much better system...once you learn it.
---
This post is a metaphor for life
---
Be aware the Hazmat suit has very little DR, and most of the critters there hit pretty hard.
---
Vampire weapons will help a lot in that scenario. 
---
Glowsight delivers bonus damage to glowing enemies, and bloodymess deals additional to /any/ enemies. Martial artist increases swing speed, ghoulish uses radiation to head.
---
I did my first WS nuke run about L27 w/ a vampire machete , and lots of radx and radaway and stimpacks. 
---
 I know I was not in PA, and did not have a hazmat suit.  I forget what armor I had.  It was tough, but doable.
---
In first minute loading I'm never able to fast travel to any camps, only worlds locations. Minute or so and it works again.
---
Thougt i saw Han Solo behind the stairs.
---
SBQ loot isn‚Äôt worth it, IMHO.  Nuke somewhere else.  Whitespring, for example.
---
definitely.
---
but it'd look cooler if it was two shot :(
---
I hit the cap limit daily as well but what I'm getting at is that unless the item your selling is the ultimate God tier level of rare or powerful the max you should probably sell anything for is probably 3k-3.5k caps for the average player....if you've got caps ooozing out of every hole then that's good, especially with dlc and stuff coming soon. 
---
This series about showing off vendors is more for the new people who have joined the game or those who have made a new character so they can look out for the cheap and decently stocked vendors early game. Some people will sell some decent gear that low levels can equip at a good price but when someone is trying to hock something like pastors vestments for 150-200 caps it just baffles me.
---
It does suck that there isn't really much to do with your caps once you've amassed a large sum unless you wanna give a bunch to new players or something but hey thanks for the criticism, all feedback is welcome and helps with the way these videos will develop!
---
I don't know, but they don't take up any budget and you can have one even if you're completely tapped out.
---
And so ends the tale of The Vault Dweller
---
Happens a lot and most often from Diseased enemies.
---
Is it getting lost though?
---
If recent interviews are anything to go by, it could be that we as a community don't understand the ramifications of what we're asking for. Not that we could know because there isn't any dialogue to clarify what's going on, if it's going to happen, why it isn't happening.
---
The not knowing is the worst.
---
Would be much appreciated, thank you very much
---
Survival mode would do well without Legendarys, right now it's Godmode vs Godmode until either player staggers.
---
In my best Bruce Willis voice ‚Äúwelcome to the party pal!!!‚Äù
---
No that was fixed. I‚Äôve seen the plan go for 10k or more caps though.
---
Visited floopwood last night, excellent prices on very nice gear, chems were dirt cheap 10/10, will go again.
---
Both perks maxed.
---
Random single spawn creature. Certain ones will not be tamable.
---
Must be half your current level.
---
Pacify, then tame and the options will show up.
---
I just want to start by giving some personal suggestions that i think can please the majority of the community. Broadly speaking there are 3 categories of FO76 players:
---
1) Hardcore PvE: are those players not interested in PvP at all and they wish it wasn‚Äôt even implemented. They are interested only in the story, collecting, trading and stuff like that (and god bless them). They are the ones always ready to help you and offer a warm place to rest and get your shit together.
---
2) Hardcore PvP: are the ones who play the game mostly for challenging, annoying or showing their superiority to others (god bless them too, i guess). They give some spice to this game, if they kill you and steal all your junk it‚Äôs a legit aspect of this game. Don‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game.
---
3) Players like me that want a healthy dose of both of them. Players that like to play Fallout and progress through a more challenging environment and not the godmode sanbox the current PvE is where dying has no consequences and you inevitably only get better and better.
---
So how to create a system that can please most players at once? There is no need of drastic changes, just small things, but a lot of them. The perfect Survival in my opinion (and feel free to criticize me) should:
---
- Give more reasons to join Survival beside the pure PvP. +20% XP is a good start, but it should add something more, like a higher percentage of Legendaries spawn, higher rewards for completing quests and events and 3 stars should drop a guaranteed 3 star item to push other players into survival that are not entirely interested in PvP.
---
- Killing/destroying ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù players/camps for no reason should have more serious consequences. If you kill someone out of the blue without him attacking back, it should put a bounty of 50 caps on you for each player killed that way. PvE players should be more protected because if they keep being killed without fighting back those 50 caps add up and the griefer becomes a juicy target for the entire server. Kill 6 innocent players that don‚Äôt want to fight back? No problem, if you want PvP the entire server will come at you to claim those 300 caps and if you die you lose that amount. If you have less than that amount you go in debt and the caps you will earn from that moment on will go to pay the debt. If you attack someone and he fights back then it‚Äôs just normal PvP, no crimes committed therefore no bounties.
---
- You shouldn‚Äôt be marked on the map for being in top 3 or for having a bounty. At best there can be an ‚Äúarea‚Äù that gives a rough idea of where the player is.
---
- Legendary armor/weapons solution: some say that legendaries shouldn‚Äôt be included in Survival others say that they will quit playing if legendaries won‚Äôt be included. The best thing that came to my mind to please both sides is to include legendaries BUT at the risk of dropping the last weapon/ one armor piece you equipped before dying with your junk and some of your aids. At this point it‚Äôs up to you if you want to play safe and use mediocre weapons/armor that you don‚Äôt mind losing or if you feel confident enough in not dying and use your best legendary stuff. This will create a much more diverse meta than your usual marsupial explosive build and engaging fights with other players will be much more risky and rewarding at the same time.
---
- When leaving a server there should be a cooldown of 5/10 mins before actually leaving the server. This is to avoid someone stealing your precious shit and then going offline two seconds after not giving you the chance to take it back (Bethesda was talking about permanent camps so it‚Äôs technically possible stay there even after turning everything off). Or at least this should be applied to wanted players. Or simply don‚Äôt allow server hopping in this new Survival gamemode.
---
- Add option for auto accept friend invites to make it easier to have people join your event from discord.  The whole social menu needs some love.  Look at blizzard or steam for how to do it well.
---
- Put a last played date on friends list so we can remove inactive
---
- Implement chat so people are more willing to communicate.
---
- Allow us to lock items so that they can not be dropped, destroyed, or sold until unlocked.
---
- Add more high level content.  The Impostor sheep is a good difficulty.  That guy can blast people down quick. A little to fast to kill some times and way to cost prohibitive to restart.
---
There's a guide to returning at the top of the sub. Click on that and read.
---
Now that I know this is possible I'm gonna have to build an airship base.
---
And a bigger build area, too!
---
You can report to Bethesda for harashment or something. And remember to block them so you won't get to same server with him again. (that actually doesn't work but still)
---
Dunno, mine's turned off while I'm at work.
---
I can stay in hidden or caution for an entire SBQ fight no problems. The main benefit of stealth outside of not getting hit is the sneak attack damage bonus.
---
Your sneak rating is determined by 3 things: Agility, Armor weight, Noise (movement).
---
My first stealth rifleman, I went the same way you did; vanguards combat bos armor (one piece was chameleon). I could definitely take a few hits no problems. But I was in danger status more than I would have liked.
---
2nd iteration of stealth rifleman. I went weightless armor with chameleon mutation instead. Changed some damage perks around, but the stealth ones remained the same. I rarely break hidden or drop to caution now. I cannot take the same amount of hits, but I never get hit, so it is a wash for me. Inside a dark building or at night, most critters will bounce off of me and my hidden/caution never breaks. Even the mighty molerat and ant cannot find me as long as I am not moving too much.
---
Both ways are certainly viable; I have hundreds of hours into both. Is more of a "just how sneaky do I want to be" kinda thing.
---
See? It's easy! Lots of fun too
---
Disgusting. And we, the hard working scavengers and vendors may bleedin' caps. It's time for a nuke!
---
I assure you that I will not fall for it again. Just wanted to let others know about this.
---
Something like that would be the best case scenario imo
---
I haven't played the game at all yet, so information for returning players would most likely leave me with more questions. Thank you for the reply though.
---
[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/586173325793820682/unknown.png) made a lot of people sad last friday.
---
I'm assuming two prefixes, two majors and one minor:
---
Bloodied, AntiArmor, firerate, vats50, vatsAP25 combat rifle. Automatic.
---
Bloodied, Quad, Firerate, 10% Aiming, Reduced weight Tesla. Automatic.
---
Bloodied, Quad, Explosive 10% Aiming, Faster reload Harpoon. Flechettes.
---
Junkies, Quad, Explosive, Firerate, vatsAP25 Railway Rifle. Automatic.
---
Bloodied, Quad, Explosive, Vats50, Faster Reload Double Barrel.
---
Bloodied, Quad, Explosive, Vats50, vatsAP25 Pipe Revolver.
---
Bloodied, Furious, Firerate, Vats50, VatsAP25 10mm SMG.
---
Quad Explosive Laser Rifle. OP enough.
---
If you fast travel to that CAMP you spawn on top of that huge power pole (the base is right above it) next to WS station. Like on the very top and the only way to access the base is to jetpack from the that pole onto it. Craziest thing I have seen so far.
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
Give it a read, you might be surprised all the same.
---
There's two different game modes now. One is geared more towards PvE (called adventure mode-this is the basic regular game mode) and the other is geared more towards PvP (called survival mode). That being said, there are still some leftover PvP mechanics in adventure mode. Like if you claim a workshop, you put yourself in a possible PvP situation since workshop ownership can be contested by other players. But other than this, if you don't respond to people attempting to PvP with you in adventure mode, they will sometimes-I haven't had it happen to me in a long time but it does still happen occasionally, they really can't do anything to you. 
---
There's also been a few DLC released since the game came out last year so that's cool. There's also player vending so there probably won't be as much grinding for stuff as there was in the beginning for people starting out-except for caps maybe. 
---
I've played the game since beta and I love it. I would definitely at least try it out and form an opinion.
---
Thanks for saying that, man. My friend I showed this post to really loved your username, she had a nice giggle. Appreciate you for shopping Floopwood.
---
Me too! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ although no sacrifices required though O.O
---
The small letters really don't cut it if you have something complicated to say. I really want a way to let people know that prices in my vendors are for negotiation if required :/
---
Awesome reply, thank you.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
What are you selling at your vendor machine?
---
Surely if you're selling legendary items at great prices you must be selling a lot of them so wouldn't that more than make up for the money you spend fast travelling to other camps?
---
I travel to lots of camps and it never costs all that much (I could make it back after attacking one raider camp and selling their stuff really), and half the time the odds and ends that sell from my vendor (LOTS of plans and outfits mostly geared towards newer players and players who haven't had a chance to explore a lot with some aid etc. and priced really cheap) more than pay for me exploring other players camps around the map.
---
Thank you for the link, I haven't played the game yet, so I assumed that information for Returning players would be more geared towards the in game mechanics that a new player wouldn't be aware of yet.
---
If the launch had been flawless (read: it was a single player Fallout) not a single person would have cared about the bag. 
---
You are right:  it was false advertising, but generally, no one bought it for the bag.  They were after the helmet.  (or the map and figures.  I keep an eye out at used stores for the map and figures.  I don't care about the helmet or bag.)
---
This is pretty much all I do when im not teamed up. I still looking for the plan for the rollup doors and the light switch.
---
this is coming from a guy whose wife has ZERO interest in gaming..bud, it sounds like you two had a GREAT time. You even ended up down at the pub having a brew probably talking about your session. I'm envious! :)
---
You gave him attention. That's probably all that he wanted. Maybe their parent's attention too but good luck helping them with that!
---
You did good today. Nice work!
---
Tis OK.  
---
I spend a good chunk of time last night reorganizing my machines.  It does make it easier from the selling end, too.  Now if I just had the camp space for another machine :)
---
I would say it depends.  If I‚Äôm in the middle of a fight with other players and catch some friendly fire I usually let it go.  If it happens multiple times I let loose and attack.  
---
It seems to me we have a lot of hyper sensitive people playing lately that get offended by the stupidest shit.  Don‚Äôt one shot stuff.  Don‚Äôt PVP others.  Leave my camp alone.  It‚Äôs fallout.  Shit gets real at times. 
---
It‚Äôs almost like Bethesda needs to create a third mode just for those that want to build or showcase pretty camps and trade or not PvP ever (intentionally or not).  Maybe call it architecture mode.  Or capitalism mode.  
---
I go back and forth between adventure and survival and with the exception of knucklehead griefers and bugs in the gameplay I don‚Äôt have any issues.
---
Welcome :)
---
I just wish that you can put more items in the vending machines. Like 50 for example.
---
*Deep into the darkness peering, long i stood there, wondering, fearing.*
---
Violence is the first resort of the righteous, brother!!!
---
What they did was decrease caps to a point that it‚Äôs more profitable to troll and grief in adventure mode so some players have probably gravitated back to adventure from survival. 
---
Losing 2x your caps was a bit much but I would have no problem losing your current level in caps upon death.
---
Surface - never! Vault forever!

Id like to come and visit. Ill be on later tonight aswell.

 I feel your pain. We definitely need something that makes that process smoother. Maybe if we could just see a vendor's inventory when we hovered over the map marker (perhaps after a trigger button). Hell, they could take it one step further and let us purchase directly via map and pay a slight delivery fee.

Sorry, I know the difference between DLC and Updates, just called it DLC out of habit.
---
Bwahahahaha, Jesus Christ. Good luck with that. I'm very doubtful that you will ever be able to place that beast.
---
ha, nice try! see right through your baiting...
---
"why are you angry" lol
---
obviously its you who is so butthurt you cry on a video game forum
---
enjoy your bitter hate filled life!
---
hi im on Ps4, sorry
---
Mine is a bit more north from the watch tower!
---
Maybe we were brothers in arms there yesterday lol
---
Hint for those that are even high level. If when you enter the world, you get a message that your camp could not be placed, QUICKLY chose another server. If you chose to stay there, it means someone on that server already has their camp when you put yours. Before I could turn around,  I was mowed down by turrets and an explosive rifle/shotgun/whatever the hell it was....had over 100 pounds of junk I had to replace that night. I know I made someone's day. 100+ adhesive, 100+ screws, 400+ lead, etc....Like someone said above, the wasteland is totally unforgiving
---
My job is very boring.  Some days I complete my work in the first 1-2 hours.  The rest of the time is daydreaming about getting home to game :p
---
  I hope you find some fun quests or events to do and good luck with the loot!
---
When I made the wiki I just used the top post that was related to bringing people back. People seemed to really enjoy it. I see what you mean though, and I'll make the appropriate changes! Thank you!
---
What platform do you play on?? I have been playing FO76 as a single player game. I too use it as an escape from the everyday :)
---
YES!!!!!!!!
---
I built some as a wall to keep out molemen, they just @#$@$@#$@$ walk up it
---
 /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
Sounds like tomorrow you'll be able to really enjoy Appalachia, have a blast!
---
Now you're talking.
---
Probably used conduit to get up there. It got destroyed and he didnt rebuild it.
---
More space in our storage box, 0/1000 would be helpful for a start.
---
When we place foundations make it so the foundations can all be level and not some sunk underneath the ground.
---
I know that, but i have no idea where that was, it was so long ago. Hence my question if there is a way to find out, without waiting for a visitor
---
If you love Fallout 4, I can't imagine you wouldn't have a blast. Building bases, collecting recipes, crafting are all a hoot. I mainly play solo unless my brother is online. A ball hair away from lvl 100. I own about 300 games on my ps4 and 76 has been the only game I've played since its release lol.
---
the workshop thing now only works if both ppl are in the workshop, they fixed it(or so i read)
---
I have a two shot of both the grenade launcher and missle launcher. If they buff explosives, I'm becoming the next Rambo of West Virginia.
---
I haven't set up a machine yet, because I know I don't have the gear I should be selling. I'd be fooling my fellow wasters
---
"Yippee¬†Ki¬†Yay, motherfucker!"
---
I call BS because you can't get killed til level 5.
---
At least you felt bad about it rather then getting your kicks from it.  Find the guy and drop him some gear or something.
---
Except for the Tattered Mole Head for some reason.
---
I'm far from bitter, but thanks for a fun conversation.
---
They should be in the droptable for a few events too. Uncommon and not sure which anymore. Haven't played a few months sorry.
---
Find the center of your build ring then, thats all you can do without another person.
---
Lmao gotta love being tired, I‚Äôll get sleep in like 4 years when my kids get older üòÇ
---
I'm the same way, when I'm at work.  Thinking about getting home and playing 76.  I can never bring myself to play for more than a few hours though.
---
he isnt saying he expects his camp to be invulnerable! **where did you even pull that shit out from?** he doesnt say that anywhere!!!!!!!!!!!!! *people make up their own arguments my god....*
---
all he asked for was enemies cant walk up them geez is it that hard to comprehend?
---
I go to all defend events (because I'm apparently an event junkie) to help and complete the event. It's sad and a bit funny how many people just leave when I show up.
---
Great list.
---
Dad of 3 toddlers here..totally understand. I dont usually get to play until my boys get to sleep. Then by that time im ready for sleep..ill get an event or two in before i pass out lol. Those days wgere you just get to be free and game..i think we deserve those days every now and then.  Good on ya. I hope you find the 3* drop youve been dreamin of.
---
I don't think they are in survival mode.
---
Damn, pretty sure thats dead center of my build haha. 
---
I cant even re-position my camp as its specifically designed around the incline of the hill!
---
Delete fallout76custom.ini file
---
What's your IGN?
---
I never had that problem til last night it was so weird and also made me lose my progress
---
*"come to appalachia she said, we'll have a good time she said.."*
---
Thank you for understanding and explaining. I love a challenge but not one where it doesn't make sense.
---
1) this isn't an MMO. In a world with a hundred players... it's a bit easier to find that common ground. Not so much in a world with &lt;24 at any given time.
---
There's your keyword... "try".
---
Funny thing is... being nice in a video game gives you the same warm fuzzy feeling that being nice in person does...
---
I'd love to see an option for something I'll call a "bedrock foundation" in camps. You collect stones or dirt as a resource, and it allows you to drop a foundation for your camp. This would create an even, perhaps slightly elevated, base that establishes a blank slate, wiping away any uneven ground, or debris. And at the same time, allow these spaces to be populated with walkways.
---
Nice, thank you for the reply.
---
They are not heavy. They are only heavy when you are not specced in heavy weapons. With "Bear Arms" they weight 2-4 units or so. And that is the reason. If they are too strong, every build would use them because they are stronger than their (specced) weapons they are using. this is not Fallout 4, this is multiplayer with multiplayer balancing. Only if you specc into the corresponding perks, you get an acceptable result, and this is fine. No one else than heavy weapons user should use them.
---
This. It‚Äôs how I did it.
---
I think its because the 6 month promised deadline has now passed
---
Fifty years from now, he‚Äôll be that silent old man sitting in his wheelchair at the nursing home. 
---
Quietly staring out the window. Contemplating the dark nature of humanity. 
---
Well-wishers making desperate attempts to connect with his shattered psyche. But to no avail. 
---
No sound escapes his lips. Just a single tear rolls down his cheek.
---
Some wounds never heal.
---
I'll second this, "Scrapper" perk gets a bad rap because it isn't what it is in FO4, but frankly, the 10+ steel from non-energy weapons and 10+ plastic from each laser pistol/rifle are a godsend.
---
Had a level 60 start hitting me while I was in my camp crafting a weapon ( I am 176). I ignored him while he continue to hit me but as I turned around I noticed a level 260 played hidden while crouched down. The only way I saw him is my curser highlighted his name and level as I turned. These guys were working together, low level engages you and the high level kills you. I was lucky my electric mutation did not react to him so I just wave to them and zoned to a different location. I really hate trolls! They do ruin this part of the game. Usually children to chicken to play in the survival mode.
---
Because your browser doesn't display PNGs as images like it should, I suppose.
---
I'm that asshole, thank you very much!
---
Since a few months, you can also pick up the weights in the courtyard.
---
yeah i could see that for sure, the helmet looked pretty cool, id want some kind of padded case for it, even a canvas bag isnt enough to protect it if accidentally got dropped
---
Free fusion cores?  Lead, aluminum, nuclear etc.  When I posted this I powered up Poseidon like 3 times and built up the workshop just to be disconnected before any cores were generated.
---
Mods increase options and have improved Bethesda titles before. If you don't enjoy the mods just don't join those servers. Sadly I am afraid 76 will probably just get another Creators club if anything at all. CC was nice for console players in the past but it's just a slight glimpse of what mods can do.
---
Todd has mentioned himself that there are millions of people playing their old titles and they have no way to "engage" with them. This hints at the wish to wedge in "recurrent user engagement (spending)". They want to drill into that user base and get them to spend more money. With this in mind it is not that far off to think of the creation club being introduced to 76. It is after all the project that was created aimed at the people still playing the old titles and get them "engaged".
---
Best guess when they will walk about mods etc. is after the total roadmap/dlc cycle is finished. If enough people still log o nand spend money it probably will come this way.
---
Uhhhhh, what?
---
They are outclassed by every other weapon category while being heavier, more expensive, have rarer ammo, reload the slowest, and break the fastest. The problem is that there is no balance.
---
Did you wait 20 hours since you last sold something? If sell 1300 worth of caps, then 8 hours later sell the final 100 left. Your 20 hour timer starts from that last sell you made  not the first time you initiated
---
For sure. Lol. Its definitely got more cool-factor
---
Level 274, all I did was play nearly everyday since launch.
---
lol this thread..
---
because Todd hates you
---
Yup my mistake forgot that happened.
---
The pvp is garbage and the main storyline is boring and uninspired.   That being said...
---
Exploring the massive world, killing unique/ interesting creatures, and getting cool loot are a blast.  You can also play with friends.  Some of the side quests and events are a ton of fun too.  Plenty to do no matter your style of play.
---
Give it a try!
---
I see a lot of people price this way. For me, its more about what legendary effect it has then how many. I would rather have a nice 1* then a crappy 3* any day.
---
I always check the map even if I'm in the forest area.
---
Umm, it's not a "super" fast prompt. It's a reactionary prompt that gives you the choice, you hit the button when you shouldn't have.
---
He was meant to die. It was his fate all along.
---
Any player over level 5 will chew through turrets like they are paper. Actually, pretty much any enemy over 5 too
---
A bit patronising lol.
---
It's because this flood has been inundated with posts like yours for months now.  Every single day.  The mods of the forum have even put in some scripts to autoremove posts asking if the game is worth returning to, but your post slipped past it.  
---
People are tired of seeing it.  Don't take it personally.  Your post could be beautifully written or absolute garbage or anywhere in between.  It's just a really really tired subject around here lately.
---
Love it lol üòÇ üòÇüòÇ
---
Hey, watch a YouTube video by Clown Daddy :Introducing Daniel. Level 2 mowed down at least 5 times.
---
Yesterday, the Queen ended up flying below the terrain level... She came back after a few minutes, and we killed her. But yeah, she has some weird behaviour.
---
give it to me, I'll repair it. oohhh snap server disconnect ..
---
&gt; wiped out by the beast and it's hoards
---
Horde (no need for plural).  Hoards are what dragons sleep on.
---
If they weighed something and they had a possibility of dropping a legendary, it would be balanced
---
Probably doing the missions and what not right off the bat. At least that's what I've heard.
---
I thought players lower than level 10 had protection.
---
How do I get the hat
---
Other was in Legendady Vendors lvl 128 and other White Springs stadion 82.Checked out whats happening and then shoot them with BE Handmade.
---
I like this
---
Would love a job like that lol. If I finish whatever job I'm doing I have to move onto another. You're lucky to be bored at work.
---
Now I‚Äôm going to have to bribe somebody at VTU, Lori Laughlin style.
---
XP is still really fast in this game. Just go kill things. One option is to hold multiple workshops and do the defense missions. You'll get kill xp and the event xp. Make sure your character is rested for the 5% bonus.
---
but I DO need my house swimming in gnomes and mr fuzzies...
---
it's a pvp event but most of the time nobody joins up and to me it is way more fun with other ppl. i try to get my friends to play with me but they end up not trying to kill me. when i played with a random person it was really great, he killed me a few times, i killed him a few times, we don't lose caps when we die. the secret is just being really fast, that way you can avoid the ghouls and the ppl, also store your junk before. but i think it's really fun to play with others
---
I can't read that, the image is too small...could someone clarify the issue?
---
:) 
---
It's still, very much, a Fallout game. If you're motivated mainly by building camps, you may be disappointed with the building mechanics in FO76? It can be **very** frustrating, as stairs/foundations/multiple floors can be very buggy when building, and there is, IMO, a very limited build budget. That being said, you can still build elaborate structures, and people have some amazing camps. You can't place junk items yet, but there are a ton of decorative plans to find.
---
Probably the biggest issue all of us legacy fallout players have, is weight. We have a hard 800lbs stash weight limit (doubled from 400 at launch, yay!), and you'd be suprised how quickly it fills. You have to break the FO4 habit of looting *everything*.
---
Overall, the game is very stable for me on XB. The latest patches have fixed a large part of the launch bugs, but seem to have increased lag and latency issues. 
---
Fo76 has a great community, both here, and in game. Just try it with open expectations, you'll enjoy it.
---
I liked his coverage on Death Stranding. Now its locked into my YouTube suggestion list and I see his smug ass face everyday.
---
I just cant hold it until Sunday... I need my weekly set of new D:
---
I disagree
---
People like want to be jerks, they get off on being jerks.  They will not be shamed into playing against real competition.  They will move on if they get bored.
---
Dam that ruins it completely
---
Server stability is a must for this game to survive. I just don't see u/bethesdagamestudios taking any further consideration to making this lackluster foundation any stronger, and that is going to be a real problem as further DLCs and items, events what not are rolled out.
---
yep, after the event ends it weights a lil bit. did you ever get anything good from the machine?
---
Sadly this game community hates PvP so much that they relentlessly down vote  any discussion regarding PvP. I 100% agree with you that I have seen some great ideas. It they often have negative karma or very low scores so they get buried.
---
I believe this is an option on both XB and PS4. I do not know of a way to do this on PC (w/o asking for recent players who were on same server to add you as friends and joining their world).
---
you dont need to one hit kill legendaries to get your scrip.
---
Yeah, I'm with you. I was hoping the game would let us bulk some of the lower tier ammo like .38, 19 mm, .45, and .308 into bundles that you could sell for say, a half-cap each in order to move them faster.
---
There's no balance with ammo. If you're running single shot weapons, you're swimming in the stuff. If you're running automatic, it's scrounge city.
---
I enjoy using a jumping VATS attack too. Feels so John Woo!
---
yeah i found when you get hassled like this 9/10 its a teen/preteen
---
I get on the mic and every time i say something like," ahhh, did your mommy buy you the wrong flavor pop-tarts and now you are gwumpy? i think someone needs a nappy-poo!"
---
this ENRAGES them! then they get on mic and sure enough its a squeaker letting me know im a n-word and a f-word
---
then i instantly mute and block them
---
No
---
I'm pretty sure it effects all chems because rad aways dont do anything for me any more
---
The people who shit on this the most seem to never log in
---
**Collision Course** is the event at Morgantown Airport that lets you get a close-up picture of a cargobot. Very fast and easy.
---
What does that do?
---
Bit hostile lol.
---
If someone else ordered it, and you break into it, you end up wanted.
---
GET EM
---
Who doesn't love a good point blank missile to the face?  Silly AI.
---
Throw treasure maps in on that
---
Not at all, I typed it in a happy font. :)
---
Right. Buff other events. Don't nerf Uranium Fever. It's already limited enough (by level).
---
Yeah, this guy caught me in his camp by White Springs train station a couple of nights ago, but healing factor saved my a**. 
---
I lost about half my health, but I walked out, looked over to where he was watching from the station and gave him the thumbs down. 
---
Nice try ass-hat, but I don‚Äôt die that easy, At least not from flames. I will watch for you in future my friend.
---
I would also like to suggest expanding the quick wheel in the same way the emote wheel works with extra emotes. Could use the extra slots.
---
He very clearly says earth.  I dont get where people got this from, and it sounds more racist every time I see it.
---
You have to learn them in order for them to show up on vendors.
---
We'll go down to the Mire, have a few laughs...
---
It makes lots of noise.
---
Should have dropped your nuke on their base. Then they wouldn't have gotten to fight the ill gotten queen at all.
---
That was my first instinct, to make sure the message got through, but they didn't appear to have a vendor up, so I couldn't find it.
---
I couldn't buy sturdy until I learned light as of a few weeks ago on my low level mule.
---
Some people are confused. You should say this is was on survival.
---
For Events, I'd like a checklist for alerts.
---
You know how the SB Queen alerts (in the top left) you that the event is going on?
---
Well there should be a list of all events, and then you can just checkbox the events you want to see an alert for.
---
It's interesting, and something I've really been trying to take these trolls to task for lately: Once you press them for details about the thing they say they're upset about, it always becomes clear that it's not something that they've personally experienced, and which in general they don't actually have a clear understanding of. It's just something that someone else has *told them* that they're supposed to be upset about, and they dutifully go forth and behave as though they're upset about something they don't really have any real understanding of. 
---
It really feels a lot like superstition, in a way: People jumping at shadows and denouncing things they don't understand, then becoming very defensive when you point out the flaws in their story.
---
I got mine doing camp fire tales and free range (2 of each) then was lucky enough to get a 3* ghoul at the golf club this morning to finish off the challenge
---
Hmmm...after trying out my 2bar flaming chainsaw in a WS nuke...then changing to my trusty switchblade....you are making me rethink selling it...
---
I think its because people were supposed to get there replacement bags in June and yet there has been 0 word or update on the situation.
---
Int doesn't give you more screws, but it does help you learn plans from scrapping, which is valuable. I agree that it's passive effect is lackluster, though Nerd Rage is also a key pick. 
---
I think the biggest thing the game needs is factions or some other way to connect people. As my friends quit the game, it's harder and harder to get a few crew. I meet lots of good solo folks, but without a structure, it's ships-in-the-night.
---
Do the horde missions. Find the crowned guy and dont kill him. New enemies will endlessly spawn. Find an unasultable position and let the experience come to you. Works with any crowned baddie.
---
Oh man, glad I'm not the only one that hates those floater houses, hurts my Lego-induced OCD.  Assuming ur post is sarcastic that is.
---
Sorry you dont have friends. You know theyre pretty easy to make... I always have like 4 people on 76 at all times now. I thought I saw Nike somwhere in your post.
---
I got myself an instigating baseball bat as a level 12, and was able to one shot lvl 68 ghouls at whitesprings with only 1 slugger card perk and 1 perk in the melee-sneak damage boost
---
it does get hairy quick at that level, if you get surrounded you are dead, but if you can take them out one at a time, it is doable
---
once you get to lvl 20 i think you finally get a sneak card, and that helps so much
---
tip:  if you are at whitesprings and a low level like I was, you can go to the clubhouse, run through the main doors, aggro ALL the ghouls, run out the door on the top floor that has the tin cans hanging from the doorways, then hop up on the raised grass immediatly after you run outside, then walk around to the right so you can see the window looking into the clubhouse
---
all the ghouls should cluster up at the window, and they cant get you! so you can now shoot them or attack with melle
---
at a low level bullets wont do much, but using that lvl 10 instigating baseball bat can usually 1-2 shot them
---
be careful as when you get close enough to attack with melle, they can get you too
---
i learned to swing early and then hop backwards, you can get you r hit without getting hit yourself
---
this works GREAT until another higher level player comes and insta kills them all
---
good luck!
---
I hate that I read all of this in his beautiful cruel voice.  &gt;,&gt; DADDY WINCHESTER NEEDS TO COOL IT OKAY.  Gleeeeennnnn üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Twitter is the home of faux outrage and pathological rage. Most of the people on there raging are unaffected by anything they complain about, but they have to follow the heard.
---
Makes me sad every time I go on there, which is hardly ever. 
---
It's where free thought and expression go to die.
---
wouldnt really call him an asshole. 
---
in a real life post-apocalyptic world, this would happen more than people being nice and helpful. 
---
you handled it well tho
---
Odd. Bad luck?
---
I still have the same 40.3% chance for a 3\* to drop a 3\* item from my last few weeks statistics. Not seen any change or noticeable drop in chances since I started longing it all in December.
---
&gt;If you change the pvp scaling it will become the default best though. 
---
There shouldn't even be a default best. That in itself is a problem.  In a properly balanced game, every build would have advantages and disadvantages.
---
They nerfed all melee weapons a while back. Now no melee weapons benefit from having additional durability from the Weapon Artisan perk card. Sucks, since any very fast weapons like the chainsaw, ripper, etc. are all useless now.
---
40.35% chance to get a 3\* item from a 3\* legendary to be exact.
---
They have so much potential to be fun weapons, but their cost/benefit ratio is just way off. I saw someone using an auto grenade launcher and Fat Man against the Scorchbeast Queen last night and they were hardly making a dent. Meanwhile, a player using a melee build was taking noticeable chunks of health off her health bar with every swing. Could be a difference between builds/legendaries, and the Queen's passive damage reduction probably contributed, but dammit - a Mini Nuke to the face should do something!
---
Good for you. May all your events be rewarding, and may all your drops be 3 ‚òÜ's!
---
He does say Earth not Earf, although I always assumed people were misremembering that he already has the cigar in his mouth by that point, causing the mispronunciation.
---
But honestly you're right, at least some people probably misremember it for less-understandable reasons.
---
yeah its one of the main reasons i gave up on workshops
---
particularly when its mole rats, and its says wave 1 of 4
---
NOPE
---
usually i just let the workshop be taken over by the enemies, then you get a new mission to take it back, and now you only have 1 wave of enemies as opposed to 4
---
but even then, if its mole rats, they get stuck in the ground too often
---
There are some real dipshits in this game!
---
if you want my stuff you gotta see my camp first, im not amazon
---
Nah I run Xbox, sorry mate
---
Yet again I'll say it - Bethesda needs to remove PvP from adventure mode - all it does is enables trolling and its increasingly making it worse for other players.
---
just ideas bro....just ideas
---
That'd be way cooler
---
i think Todd realized we were having fun with jetpacks and did this...
---
I do it twice a day and never see more than 2 people. üôÉ
---
this is what i do as well
---
Does it say eat people on the wall and are you on xbox?
---
Plastic surgery...
---
People are able to do that yet i cant stack stairs
---
But there have been; people around Reddit have reported that they've been asked for address confirmation, before being told that the bags are almost ready to ship.
---
and now you start your own cult!
---
Gotta be a glitch because this happens to me when I run into the legendary glitch at Whitespring (20+ legendary ghouls).
---
kill mobs &amp; leech events is the fastest way to gain exp
---
Ugh. Gonna prepare for the DMV quest lmao
---
selling armor for real money
---
Alright I'm gonna give that a try
---
Do you have to run away from their corpse and then come back for the loot to spawn or is that just me?
---
You are a very angry person.
---
well geez! give them time to get the end game together! i mean, they've only had 6 months to listen to feedback and test it themselves and ....! oh wait...
---
Yeah, i don't need to but I don't keep bad weapons equipped, my weakest can one or two shot most mobs. I have no choice
---
Events/maps in the savage divide are the only ones that have a chance to drop raider plans.
---
Your suggestions have surpassed being "just" ideas. They're pipe dreams.
---
are there level 45-50 ones available or are they all lvl 20 only?
---
Not necessarily. Studies looking into different catastrophes and crises around the globe shows that much, much more people bring out their best and help each other than the few that try to take advantage (looters, criminals etch). While I am not fully ready to end the world to test it in this specific scenario, it does seem something like the responders would be more of a rule than an exception.
---
Weirdly enough. Before reading that study I was convinced assholes were in the majority.
---
I think that speaks for itself as to why turrets still need buffs to be effective defensive tools for workshops.
---
I buy lead and ballistic fibre from user and robot vendors to supplement what I find. I collect all the aluminum, wood and adhesive I can. I get steel from scrapper - 30 from a single minigun. No more workshop...
---
Man. 
---
I tried to wave at someone. Threw a grenade. Then tried to say sorry, but gave him the fingerguns instead.. before running away, only to send a private apology that probably came across as pathetic in light of what had just happened.
---
I'd love a lever action like that. I suspect the damage for me would be 500-600ish lol. My AAE will do for now though.
---
In a real post-apocalyptic world you don't get to respawn lol.  Taking the workshop didn't make him an asshole.  Following me around trying to pick fights did.
---
Small letters, bruh.
---
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY!?!?
---
you always have a choice :P  
---
even just waiting 5 seconds for the weaker players to get their tag.
---
I‚Äôm all for more information on the camp display card but this I do not like.
---
I noticed this yesterday too. Poor idiot was trying so hard to do something to me and then my teammate. I wasn‚Äôt about to turn off pacifist to respond just because some fool is too pathetic to hack it in survival. I just stopped what I was doing and stared at him till he realized and scurried off. How do they not realize how sad they look trying this?
---
Its because Todd knows what you do in the shower you naughty boy
---
Thanks for your useful input to this conversation, it is really appreciated
---
YOU PRICK!!!
---
In my previous build I did that for my fusion generator so that I didn't lose power. Yesterday I was trying to find a scorched and managed to find them in that room which has a lock on the door.
---
I will see if I can chat with them. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I haven't tried.. but can't you write with small letters in someone else's CAMP? If you can build stuff for them, you must be able to put up a sign, no?
---
Once you hit L50, you level up much faster - b/c you'll be spending most of your time in areas and doing events where the enemies give lots of XP....
---
Took me around 5 months to make L50...but only about a month to get from 50 to 98.
---
For example, I did Line in the Sand (again) a couple days ago.  
---
3x L65 SBs by the time the event ended.  
---
 Last night, happened through WS post nuke with no rads, plants were still radiated and still had all the bloated glowing ones (alas, no hi rad fluids, but lots of legendaries) - ended up making 3 circuits, and co-op'ed on a L91 glowing deathclaw and another SB for good measure.
---
Effectively, I gained 5 levels in about 2-1/2 play sessions.
---
All your launch bots will die if you don't defend them, so no.
---
With class freak it's only -13ish% effectiveness, so if you have lvl 1 first aid equipped they do the same as normal
---
A lot of the times when reading these suggestions I find myself thinking 'well why is even fucking here'
---
I did not have that sentiment with this. Well thought out, highly articulated plan and actually makes a lot of sense. So naturally, Bethesda will probably ignore it and nerf more things already in the game.
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper‚Äù fast when you are mashing the drop button to lose some weight because you are getting rapped in the mouth by that damn inbred goat. Sorry I don‚Äôt roll at a slow pace
---
Are you sure there weren't fasnacht confetti rugs connecting it to something? They're invisible from below, and before they were patched, you could build invisible bridges.
---
I didn't have any idea XD I only have 4 possum on my one main, didn't see any real value atm to change it's type.
---
I tried to tell everyone who reported/mentioned the unintentional damage buff in threads to shhhhhhh as I knew they would nerf our previous chainsaw... But alas. I too loved my chainsaw, and it is now scrap.
---
Just started 6 days ago.
---
And, [Oh, hey. An update!](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1136629478527033346)
---
i defend the innocent. they guy seriously fabricated an argument. i call em like i see em.
---
No it's the fact the info is put out and that some people don't want to understand at times. When you do the same thing, don't you get annoyed when others don't want to listen?
---
Workshops are definitely the fastest way
---
I spent a lot of time in the forest last night and exclusively used my somerset special and vats. I don't think I missed more than one or two shots the entire night. I had concentrated fire on for about half the night. But I didn't really use it and just let it do torso shots. 
---
I think what we might be noticing is that they 'fixed' a bug a while back that started the vats chance at 0 even though it showed higher so we always missed the first shot. They swung it the other way so it would seemingly always hit the first shot. I could enter vats with something behind a tree and if I was quick enough, I could hit it before the hit chance dropped to 0. Since the last patch, it doesn't do that any more. So outside of a few random glitches, it seems to be working more like it should. Enemies behind cover are extremely hard to land a hit on, even with a high hit percentage. I don't like it but it seems more fair.
---
ok...so  maybe just shoot the turrets at the end launch-prep bit...but other than that this might be quite a fun challenge for those with the mega-sneak armor set
---
The Fat-Man is pretty good (especially when you have a TS one. It does over *900* damage and that's without any perks, making it capable of one-shotting or seriously hurting targets), and a Auto-Grenade Launcher is also halfway decent (sure it breaks quick but a Bloodied one or a 50% limb damage one will make quick work of some enemies. Or at least cripple them severely)
---
But the Missile Launcher is flat-out garbage. You need like a dozen missiles just to kill one target, the Targetting Computer is bound to miss most of the time, and a TS missile launcher doesn't actually shoot a second missile. And it breaks even quicker than the Fat-Man while outputting less damage overall
---
I don't agree with putting people down for expecting what they paid for to actually BE what they've paid for. 
---
That to me would be like getting angry at my friend for complaining that the Mercedes he's just purchased was shipped to him as a Ford Fiesta. :)
---
False. I started my survival character at level 1. He's surprisingly viable, even without ridiculous legendaries etc. I get wrecked against level 200+ marsupials with explosive shotguns, but for the average player I get more kills than deaths. However they balanced player damage is surprisingly equalizing.
---
So, you're saying, idk what you're saying, not entirely convinced there's a point to this thread? I mean, everyone, except youaybe, knows that atom shop paints don't transfer, and they destroy an item dropped with the paint on it.
---
Side note, I giggled at "raped in the mouth by that damn I bred goat", actually, I laughed pretty hard lol.
---
The guy makes a living on drama and 10 minute videos. It's a decent news source but often there's no point to his videos nor what he's saying, other than it being a topic of discussion.
---
I play really early in the morning before work. Servers are also less populated.  It's pretty great other than less shoppers at my vending machine.
---
I think that's a good idea too - It would be a great way to give highly capable members of the community like yourself a bit of a reward for doing the dirty work for them. 
---
The business model exists out there. . . I'm sure some people would even be happy with Atom rewards.
---
You post a completely unrealistic suggestion and ask people to discuss. Now you're mad because someone pointed out that it would never happen? I'm not the prick, here.
---
Until Bethesda removes PvP completely from adventure mode, the hate train will continue.  Its really on Bethesda for not listening and providing a non PvP game mode.
---
By sleeping with the wrong Ghoul
---
Seems like the hit percentage might not always take obstructions accurately into account. I know I've had times where I knew that I could shoot around something but it hit the obstruction anyway (scoped, not vats). 
---
I do the kanagroo shooting too, but I hate draining my ap on jumping.
---
Heat flashes are from diseased honey beasts. Woopsies are from diseased mirelurk spawn (the little bugs from the eggs). It takes a while for the mirelurk spawn to give you a disease so take some water to heal while they hit you.
---
Hehe I'm carrying 128 40mm, 13 mini nukes, and 50 missiles on my heavy gunner/demo toon. That's not counting the 30 fusion cores, 15 plasma cores, and countless 5mm
---
I ordered the Power Armour edition. The bag was literally the thing in it I cares about the least. it's just a bag. It was probably gonna end up at the bottom of my wardrobe buried under crap rather than be used.
---
I cares about the Power Armour helmet. After all, it was the Power Armour edition, not the Canvas Bag edition.
---
Find a high level to escort you through the Top of the World area.   Make sure that they enter the zone first.  Get a hit on each of the enemies then have them finish the enemies off.
---
Also, glowing ghouls still spawn at White Springs for a short time after the radiation is gone.  Tons of XP.  They can also be lead out of the radiation zone. 
---
I recently helped a level 11 go up to level 29 doing this.  
---
I like using a double barrel shotgun and the Enforcer perk to hobble the enemy (target the legs) than the low level can get shots in while being relatively safe.  
---
I recently had 20 glowing ghouls all hobbled shuffling trying to catch up with me.  It was a challenge to do it without killing them and it was fun...
---
I want to role-play as a "Mike Miller"-esque astronaut (Tandy's brother if you know who that is).
---
Someone caught in space during the apocalypse and comes down and lives in their armoured-up spacesuit trying to rebuild the wasteland
---
Thank you!
---
Yes, however that was what was important to You, not everyone is the same or has the same priorities. :)
---
Why are you being downvoted haha
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Lost the bag that it came with days after it got it, but he helmet is still on display. Didn‚Äôt understand the rage about a bag, especially by those who didn‚Äôt buy it in the first place.
---
Man, this needs to be a sticky.
---
Sleep.
---
Do all sidequests.
---
Hop in on every workshop defense mission that appears on map. 
---
Claim workshops, defend them every time you need to.
---
Explore every location on map.

Craft, scrap.

Here is a list https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/auqj9s/a_list_of_all_the_currently_bugged_challenges_in/
---
&gt;You're asking too much from Bethesda.
---
and this is what you call discussion.....good job sir, really useful discussion material there
---
Well, it has got be something but I searched intensively and I could not find anything that connects to the pole or ground. Apart from the "ship" there is only one single piece of of floor he has put on the pole. That is the one I stand on on the picture. Definately nothing connects to that.
---
You go quietly into that cold night
---
Alot of wishes for a minimal effort 3 person dev team. Trust me on this. 
---
Will never happen
---
Sent a couple friend requests. I'm assuming your busy AF (I quite understand the ever-changing scheduled). Any chance I can get an invite when it's convenient for you? IGN MrBright01
---
Late to the party - but it's called a cap sink. 
---
It's meant to add 'entropy' to the in-game economy / world to keep you playing and grinding.
---
So, how many people spent ¬£175 on a special edition for a bag?
---
When I kill people and they get mad I just send a message that says survive. I feel like a sick serial killer.
---
It's already essentially removed from adventure mode, if you use pacifist mode and don't afk in workshop it's a non issue. Workshops were meant to be contested by other players.
---
Well then it seems that if you're spending 20000 caps fast traveling then maybe you need to just stop visiting vendors - obviously no one is meeting your very high standards for what they should sell and how much (and please, you should give us an example of how cheap you think things should sell for). 
---
I don't have my vendor set up for you, I have it set up for all the other players in the game who might find something useful or different (and most visitors have found at least something that they wanted) and it's cheap enough to not even really think about the cost...it fuels my own addiction to collecting plans and outfits.
---
So with all due respect, maybe the problem is that you keep going to vendors? Maybe you should just leave others and just deal with the legendary vendor instead, you might find that works better for you than spending all those caps to travel but still find the cost of items too high and people not being up to your standards in what they sell?
---
The only other CPU intensive programs I might be running in the background is discord and it's in game overlay, and spotify? Anyway, I will try this!
---
Terrible. If you play it. Todd Howard will come to your house and unplug your fridge.
---
When I replied, I was wondering why you'd invest all that time just to lost it because of server instability. ;)
---
That's a nice sentiment but there's always going to be a best build for pve or pvp, or at best 1 or 2 that have different roles.
---
This is a good soft tiss to hit a homerun "yo mama" roast..but im mature. And it hurts inside to let this slide unroasted.
---
You cant take a workshop and then complain about being PVP'ed. I dont like PVP but if I take a workshop I understand that it is part of the game, while the jerks take things way to far most times workshops are part of PVP.
---
 Maybe it could include a postcard of your camp so people could still see it and decide if it's worth visiting. It would end a lot of wasted caps roaming around trying to shop a good deal.
---
Oof
---
 Contribute to the conversation, what about it don't you like? That folks wouldn't actually come to your camp?
---
If you spawn on the pole, that's where he placed his camp module. The one foundation has to be the first piece he placed. 
---
As suggested in here, I'll bet he built a small "bridge" up to where he placed the main structure, and then had someone destroy the "bridge" when he was done.
---
Seems like a completely wasted opportunity to not make it look like a UFO, or the Enterprise.
---

Usually on after 630-700 pm.

They are not heavier. And there is balance. They are not designed to be used as your normal go to wepaon ("oh, a radroach *BOOOM*"). They are explosives heavy weapons, this is their own category. "Oh, a bunch of enemies standing together, let's rip them a new one." Every person who is using those explosive weapons are using any other kind of strenth based weapon as a main weapon (heavy weapons or shotguns), those explosive weapons are for special situations only, like grenades.That's why every person who is running "Bear Arms" can carry an additional rocket launcher with ease. And if you invest in explosives, they do enough damage. Again, this is not F4, this is multiplayer, and a Fat Man that kills everything in a 40m diameter has nothing to do with balance ...
---
Simply not enough - lame trolls will still continue instigating others to engage them in PvP regardless trying to get them to turn off their Pacifist, trap them by inviting them to a team using a low level, etc.  Until its removed completely, you will always have PvP players trolling other players.
---
If they want to leave workshop PvP then let that be the *ONLY* way to PvP in adventure mode.  Remove the slap mechanics completely, only way to engage PvP is to contest a workshop *AND* be in the workshop area.
---
Well he was running chameleon possibly unyielding and from the looks of it a explosive bloody handmade or shotgun so I don't think he was that hard done by shaggy ;)
---
Nooooo. I use that invisible ramp to slide around structures until I can find a way to scooch my ass inside.
---
 Why not? Just not into player vending? Don't like the player delivery angle?
---
is it possible to launch 3 nukes at once?  all at the prime fissure?
---
Alright. I will try closing every other tab I might have open to see if that makes it any better, and maybe ask around to see how much ram other people are playing it on? Thanks for the feedback.
---
Yet you made a post about the bag shipping even though by your own admission that you don't personally care about it? 
---
Have a lovely day friend :)
---
I've been up there. Awesome base. Very nice Captain. Good vendors.
---
10/10 would travel with again.
---
Is it your home that you do this?
---
Don't give Bethesda any ideas Lol, this will be the next atom challenge.
---
Launch a nuke in a radstorm : 20 atoms
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs been happening more lately. I had a level 12 hitting me as I was repairing my armor in my camp. I‚Äôm level 151. I figured there was some higher level player hiding so I ignored him. He then turned off all the lights in my camp. If you wanna PvP that bad, go to survival.
---
 Thanks, just hoping to generate some ideas.
---
And switch over to super sticks and/or First Aid for those intense fights. No problems
---
So don't die.
---
Hardyhar! 
---
Yeah it happens to me too, when you die all your carry weight perks and stuff get taken off so you switch from unencumbered to encumbered, which then triggers this bizarre bug. They had it fixed at one point and then it got reintroduced by one of the recent patches. Really, really annoying.
---
I seem to think in the early days of the game three simultaneous nukes crashed the server!
---
We launched 3 at once, but I put 2 in the title, because you can only see 2 in the pic. Servers don't crash anymore. and yeah you can nuke prime with 3
---
And free plans and random junk as well. The forest ones usually spawn easier enemies in fairly small numbers.
---
From here: "Enemies are walking up to my barriers and walls before they dismantle it"
---
If you could simply surround your camp with high foundations to keep enemies at bay then that's exactly what everyone would do. 
---
Why else would you want enemies to not be able to overcome the foundation, if not to prevent them from damaging your Camp. 
---
Here's another Idea...Eliminate the Ramp on foundations, but give all the enemies the marsupial mutation, then people would complain that the enemies can get to them everywhere.
---
My point is Quit asking for an Easy Button on Everything! it's a Survival game.
---
I made it to let people know. I don't personally care myself, but I wanted to let people know that it's happening.
---
You mean "even if I'm *not* over-encumbered" right?  Because if you are, that's just where you spawn.
---
The problem is - and it comes up a lot if you're Bloodied - that you run a number of different perks that affect Strength, and thus carry weight, and these are inconsistently removed when you die.  It ends up being a race condition.  If they wear off before you are sent to the map, then the game will believe you are over-encumbered and force you to spawn at Vault 76.
---
Super sticks? Interest peaked lmao
---
It absolutely is an mmo, sorry. There is no set limit on how many people have to be playing at any given time. There are other games that have similar world sharding and player limits per shard that are very much considered mmos already.
---
Additionally that common ground can be found outside of the game itself and you can join on a server that your friends are playing on.
---
cycling the season sounds nice feature. a different season every week?
---
That would be so great
---
But everyone loves the Courier!
---
OH got it. Thank you. 
---
That makes sense in the context of when I've read it. Thought it referred to something else behind the CK scenes.
---
There‚Äôs build guides and creators you can use online. There were two that I saw pop up that are pretty good. Nukes and Dragons, Falloutbuilds.com. Anyways there‚Äôs plenty of places to look. Have fun :3
---
THIS. IS. APPALACHIA!

---
I am only lvl 24 but I got my first launcher at 20 and thought I had finally got my last resort murder weapon. The fixer is 4 times the dps with a fifth of the weight. Pretty silly
---
I saw a video by rifle gaming and he nuked some place with 3 nukes and a Radstock showed then too. Could just be a coincidence bur maybe multiple nukes gives a better chance for radstorms.
---
Spending time with a random kid is both healthier for both parties and cheaper.
---
"Take a picture of a nuke in a rad storm"
---
I would like to add that its not visible with the default theme either, and it is not linked under the visible drop downs at the top.

---
Honestly, I think the cigar thing explains a lot. There are several cigar mumbled lines at major points in the movie, but in theaters the "Welcome to Earth!" line was by far the biggest crowd-pleasing moment. So over time, people just imagine Earf. I couldn't get through ID4 the last time I tried to watch it, and I'm sure lots of people are the same. We just vaguely remember some of the biggest moments from a huge summer blockbuster we watched a lot when we were kids.
---
You can respec, but it's a bit of work. You have to "over level" if you screw up your build. Every level after 50 you can pick either a new perk or to move one special stat point to another. You'll be delaying your end game effectiveness and / or the ability to pick up crafting / situational perk cards until later. 
---
My tip would be to specialize. You can't pick multiple weapon types in this game like you could in other Fallout games. If you want to go shotgun or rifles, I'd advise you to pick one. 
---
As for good end game viable builds, I'd say there are really two that shine above all others - a bloodied heavy weapons build, and a bloodied stealth crit VATS based commando build (auto rifles). 
---
[This site](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) is really amazing for planning your build ahead of time. It even optimizes what perks to pick up at a given level, or at least shows you all of your options.
---
**I did a write up for bloodied heavy weapons. You can read that here:**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the\_bloodied\_heavy\_weapons\_tank\_an\_end\_game\_pve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/) 
---
This guide will also give you the basics of running a bloodied build - what it is, why you should run it, how it functions and how you stay alive while sitting at 19% health.
---
**Here's an optimized solo rifleman build** that I'm working on: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f253ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2p02pp2e31cu0ir2a72an2ar2ao0a12lr2l12lt2lk2lv2a01c72sb0&amp;w=eu0a42s72ag2at1ah0ae2a32i92i44ib4ic4ij2i61i71ia0if2s12im0ik0i50iq2ie2in1ih2i30c50cr0eh2&amp;n=SBQ%20Melter%20SOLO&amp;m=2358bcf](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f253ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2p02pp2e31cu0ir2a72an2ar2ao0a12lr2l12lt2lk2lv2a01c72sb0&amp;w=eu0a42s72ag2at1ah0ae2a32i92i44ib4ic4ij2i61i71ia0if2s12im0ik0i50iq2ie2in1ih2i30c50cr0eh2&amp;n=SBQ%20Melter%20SOLO&amp;m=2358bcf)
---
This does higher dps IF you can stay stealthed during SBQ fight, and it's not tanky at all unless you have full sentinel armor (expensive), and you'll definitely want full unyielding gear. Ideally you'd want full Uny/AP Refresh/Harder to detect while sneaking gear for a full glass cannon build.
---
If you want to hyper min/max, you could run this with an empath bot that provides 5 point adrenaline as well. That would look like this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f323ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2p02pp2e31eu0cu0ir2a72an2ar2ao0a12lr2l12lt2lk2lv2a51sb2cm0&amp;w=a42s72ag2at1ah0ae2a04a32i92i44ib4ic4ij2i61i71ia0if2s12im0ik0i50iq2ie2in1ih2i30c50cr0eh2&amp;n=SneakVATSCrit%20Group&amp;m=2358bcf](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f323ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2p02pp2e31eu0cu0ir2a72an2ar2ao0a12lr2l12lt2lk2lv2a51sb2cm0&amp;w=a42s72ag2at1ah0ae2a04a32i92i44ib4ic4ij2i61i71ia0if2s12im0ik0i50iq2ie2in1ih2i30c50cr0eh2&amp;n=SneakVATSCrit%20Group&amp;m=2358bcf)
---
Those two builds are vastly different in their approach to combat. The Heavy Weapons build utilizes the raw power of heavy weapons like the .50 Cal Machine gun to do massive sustained dps, while relying on power armor to stay alive. The auto rifle build is very finicky and requires very specific gear, like a full unyielding set of armor at minimum.
---
Got the Power Armor Edition. Didn't even think about the bag, I have four similar bags from my times in the military. Just printed a West-Tec Logo and put in one of my Canvas Bags ID-slip and voila. Then put the bag in storage and the helmet on display. Never thought about it once. Didn't order a replacement. It's a bag. I got the special edition for the Power Armor piece, like name said. 
---
Good times!
---
I launched my first nuke in forever last night and only half of the plants in the nuke zone changed. Screwed me out of the violet flux I needed to upgrade my PA.
---
They said they aren‚Äôt ready and are pushing them back till they feel it‚Äôs good enough to have in game
---
That is a crazy story, but I don‚Äôt think you should look at it as a wasted afternoon. I‚Äôm the big gamer in my relationship and would give anything for my husband to play this game with me. He‚Äôs more of a sporadic gamer and likes to play Madden and action games. 
---
He‚Äôs watched me spend hours playing Fallout 3, NV, 4, and 76 and isn‚Äôt interested. He says they look ‚Äúboring‚Äù üò≠
---
Wow, thats stupid
---
They were supposed to build on the same system they used for the Fermenter and Punch Bowl, but people found ways to use that for duping, so I am guessing it is delayed until safe.
---
Which is good... but a bit sad.
---
This is enough though. Camp damage/griefing has been removed. They changed the workshop PvP mechanics to only include workshop areas, AKA no more getting ganked for your junk anywhere win map. Slap damage has been completely removed. 
---
If someone doesn't want PvP but still finds themselves getting killed by players on adventure mode, it's on them.
---
Agree. I scrapped 3 yesterday, all with long bow or dual bar and flames. Had them up since player vendor came out at 350, then 250, then 199.  None sold so I scrapped them last night and learned a couple mods. Gained 30+ stash weight.
---
Nothing like blasting an asshole!
---
That's what I try to do every time. Using robot expert makes it pretty easy. Turrets are the only bitch, and only because I'm too lazy to swap my hacker cards in. üòù
---
I have never got a prime receiver from whitesprings ...
---
I feel the opposite about obstructions. I‚Äôve got stuff that was entirely behind cover but Gun Fu swapped to them just as they were hiding!
---
Only if I am over-encumbered I end up at Vault 76 (as I should), otherwise it always seem to work 100% as it should.
---
This is why you'll never see the end of PvP hate on this sub.  That's all I have to say - it just enables all the bad behavior that others don't want any part of.
---
I did it with a Supersledge.
---
Captain here:
---
Build the 1x2 staircase and put a metal "stair" bar on top of it.
---
Blueprint staircase and the bar, not the foundation.
---
Blueprint can now be placed mid air.
---
*flies away in The USS Enterprise*
---
I played Jazz Jackrabbit at 5, and struggled with it - he sounds like a natural regardless. Granted most of the challenge at that age was remembering how to run the game (leave Windows 3.1, in command prompt type "jazz.exe").
---
Lore-wise this is pretty consistent though right?
---
Vault 76 had the best of the best, they were highly competitive and a lot of them disliked eachother. You can be sure someone would be laying in wait when they first got out the the vault for an unsuspecting vault dweller who was late getting out.
---
Yeah, that seems to be another consideration. Gun fu lets me hit all kinds of stuff that I can't on the first enemy. The first kill seems to be the hardest to hit.
---
Did it with a pickaxe here. Some of the weapons don't seem to work.
---
Your ethos was pretty funny. 
---
I just don‚Äôt want to see a two shot buff is all. I lived through it last time, didn‚Äôt like it. I mean, you wanna take up some cause, take up Berserker‚Äôs. Most weapons would be BETTER if the Berserker affix was removed from it.
---
Go ahead and try it
---
trying to hobble/wound enemies without killing them does present its own challenge!  Sometimes I find myself turning on my mic to say "sorry" when I accidentally kill an enemy I was only trying to soften for someone else.  At times i think i should carry a low level/low damage gun for just this purpose.
---
I got the PAE, I didny even look at the bag until I seen the mention of it. I did the ticket to get a new one, extra fallout gear as far as I'm concerned.
---
Idk why some people got so infuriated over it, I seem to think it ma have been an accumulation at the time though.
---
Nope. Others. If you can get to the foundation level, *right* up against the outer wall... you can slide around the whole thing.
---
Similar to how, if you place a single foundation, but as high off the ground as you can... you can simply "walk" up it and onto it.
---
If someone has a locked door and a set of stairs to that door.. .and no way in, you basically walk up the stairs, turn and walk off the stairs, staying at foundation level, and "float" around the outer perimeter.. .then, if you find a window, activate a chair or bed or workbench or whatever inside... and "presto" you're inside.
---
Grab a 2 hand weapon
---
I think they scale to your level
---
Well, the fat man has really low DPS due to its long reload. It's intended as a one-shot weapon. And melee, especially bloodied melee, already shines as the clearly dominant damaging build in this game
---
This is the guide I use and it's pretty extensive.

It would be a simple start for them to incorporate the in-game date to change with the in-game time passing. Once they start this, they can then start adding features based on the in-game dates such as Christmas, Easter, Independence day, Reclamation day etc.
---
If 1 in-game minute = 1 real-life second, Then 1 in-game day takes 24mins.
---
365 days per year (x 24mins) = 6.083 real-life days for 1 in-game year to pass
---
It is possible. I have done it. Just keep launching the bots every time they die.
---
It is much easier if you remove targeting from the turrets and each 'unique robot' I found the launch bots took longer to die this way.
---
If there are 2 or more people it becomes much more difficult... still doable but there are more enemy spawns.
---
Uhhh bud
---
They can't, they're not good at the game. Just bought their TSE assault rifles/handmades for real money because they're dead inside.
---
Wow thanks! I take so many pics in game but I never share them x) My settings are on ultra btw
---
The guy was probably using a bloodied explosive laser rifle? They absolutely melt the lvl 100 Alpha
---
This was probably the first time I didnt check the map x)
---
Please go outside more often... and I do mean the real world...
---
Hacker will turn off the turrets, if they even spawn in. You could POTENTIALLY remove target restrictions to kill each wave of baddies, but you'd have to turn them off again, and get your own bots back up again. Not very time-efficient. I'd definitely swap in level 3 Robot Expert if you were to try this.
---
I had the same issue a couple of weeks ago when I took over the Poseidon workshop. Built stuff up, defended the incoming waves. I was prob level 24? Then two players, a 120+ and a 50+ came in and though I tried to move around, ganked me within 30 seconds or so. Yes, I had turrets, and no they didn't do squat. The game isn't clear at all about the mechanics of PVP, and I don't think in any game anywhere it's ever fun that you can be inadvertently sucked into PVP against far higher level PCs that can one shot you. 
---
Since splitting off Survival and Adventure, perhaps the PVP at workshops should just be disallowed? Or make PVP 'fairer' by adding a bounty if the attacking player is significantly higher level (for every 5 levels higher than you that an attacker is, put a bounty of 10+ caps). So if I'm 30 and a level 40 decides to attack, they can nail me but get a 20 cap bounty. Then others get to return the favor..
---
Not sure what platform you‚Äôre on, but if you‚Äôre on XB1, try to remember or even write down some of the player names around you if you‚Äôre in a big event in case you crash. Then in the main XB1 menu you can go to recent players and join their game if their settings allow for it, or you can search for a player by their GT and join that way.
---
I‚Äôve had to do this more times than I can count. It‚Äôs very annoying, but worth it to get back in the fight.
---
More slightly exaggerating than overestimating. Unless you're maining two-shot plasma Gatling..... ;)
---
The mats are part of accessibility. A level 5 can't carry a Minigun and 20 rifles to take home for scrapping. Anyone over 50 can easily.
---
Melee + Big Guns eat each other's lunch. They're both STR. Hm. If you don't have this week's Survival legendary it's much nicer than a knife.
---
My day-to-day is generally not doing something like walking through Watoga Civic Center. I try to do Encryptid, take out all the big monsters in Cranberry Bog, etc. Crippling some scorched is silly, but crippling Mirelurk Queens and Sheepsquatch is pretty useful. When Mirelurk Queens spawn legendary you'll die of poison pretty quick even if you can facetank SBQ...... Cripple is great.
---
In other news, I tried Accelerated Barrels. You have to put the Minigun up something's nose to hit it with **_most_** of the rounds. On paper this is probably assuming 100% hit rate, but I think you should give it a try...... :\
---
I actually had a hazmat suit in my stash, but completely forgot about it
---
postcards are a nice idea, but still it's not the same. i think that if ppl want to just shop a lot for few caps you already have an option, which is to set your camp near whitesprings and visit all nearby camps. i have my camp set up way north in the mire for the whole experience, you discover a new place you probably didn't wander into before and you can buy a nice flaming chainsaw. it's also a random encounter spot, i came home to a sheepsquash one day, on another it had the weird mannequins surrounding my fasnacht bonfire. things you can't convey in a postcard...
---
idk
---
I'd argue he's not a loser, but the people who buy it are.
---
The moral side of selling this shit for real world money is another question of it's own, but regardless but those sets will be duped to oblivion and he'll be making BANK. You are deadout if you buy it though, especially as it's not *that* hard to just get trading and eventually get a set of your own - a much cheaper and more fun experience.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not a legendary then I just let go an accidental kill here and there.  But for legendary enemies I do feel bad if I kill it before others get shots in. 
---
As for damage adjustments, I adjust the perks first.  You can reduce the amount of damage a lot by just going with the raw weapon.  
---
But, yeah, I have an auto 10mm silenced pistol that I use for the low to medium level areas where I need to share kills.  I find it much easier to manage the damage that I deal.
---
Have you ever tried to use them. They aren't useless, but they are not good, and need some more damage, not double or triple or something crazy, but 20% wouldn't be amiss. 
---
There is a certain minimum damage threshold a weapon needs to clear to be useful. A weapon that does one damage to every enemy on the map for all players isn't a good weapon, no matter how much combined damage it is doing, because that damage is not dealt in a useful fashion. The fact you need to hit 4+ enemies with a missile launcher just to achieve parity levels of damage hinders the weapon severely, given how much harder you have to work to use the weapon, and how rarely that many enemies are gathered in one place that doesn't have you standing in the middle. 
---
Lets not even begin discussing costs, the amount of material required to make ammo for heavies is immense, and the cost to keep them in a repaired state is very high. This is only acceptable if the weapon is powerful enough to be worth using over a normal weapon, then the high price acts as the restriction. Having the weapon cost a fortune, and still suck, just makes it a bad weapon.
---
you forgot NPCs and a story with said NPCs
---
This is literally to much effort to put in to get items. There are so many other things that are broken and need to be fixed instead of an idea no one will use after 3 days.
---
The reality is PvP in all likelihood will remain on adventure mode to some degree. Bethesda has placed many more restrictions on it, if they wanted to remove it completely they probably would have by now 6 months into release. If it was to be removed workshops would require an overhaul.
---
I think Bethesda has more important things to focus on in the game than overhauling workshops when they are working as intended.
---
That's a brilliant idea - well done for thinking out of the box!
---
~~Walls~~ Locks are immoral
---
I managed to catch [exactly that](https://imgur.com/DDofg3H) last night. It's actually quite a pretty sight
---
give me my 10 atoms bethesda
---
I think this is a pretty spot on assessment.  Seems every few weeks some random topic that is nearly a non sequitur to any other discussion comes up multiple times in a day, then fades to obscurity.
---
It‚Äôll be the same after E3 presentation.  I‚Äôll predict the P2W discussions get brought up anew, people will post claiming to be leaving based on the presentation, etc etc.  interesting stuff for psychological/sociological views on human nature and the internet.
---
Ah oki
---
&gt; Quit asking for an Easy Button on Everything! 
---
again, where do you people even get this from?
---
 the OP is not asking for this!
---
  I know its hard not to project your inner argumentative self, but please, slow down and take the time to actually READ what people type on the internet.
---
  I know nowadays its all about being "OUTRAGED" at every little thing, i know many of you younger people have very thin skins and are prone to be super defensive , to the point you manufacture conflict through made up arguments or infer incorrect assumptions based on knee jerk "hot take" reactions.
---
It seems you get triggered easily and then make nonsense statements.
---
 i forgive you, but the real world is suffering when people act like you do over pretend things.
---
its not too late to change for the better!
---
It‚Äôs so sad too, because it feels like the missile launcher should be amazing.
---
My stats didn't change (3 CHR, 10 LCK) and I'm still avoiding other people to reduce the chance of getting "their luck".
---
You're missing out on *SO* much damage potential by still using a TS weapon... you get less than +25% damage from TS. Bloodied weapons give more than +75% damage brudda
---
So did I!  But I wasn't going to pass up on something free. :)
---
Heh, do you you do my job?
---
I remember when I first started the game they were the coolest thing. I got my first good gun (hunting rifle) in Morgantown when another player called one and used it for 10 levels.
---
I personally don‚Äôt think this is something that needs to change. Yes, it‚Äôs not the most useful at later levels, but they act as very valuable supply drops at an early level and I don‚Äôt think they need to be more than that.
---
Wait, what? The emotes wheel can expand?
---
Trust me, it sucks. I'd much rather be busy. I've done both, and I feel far more satisfied and the day goes way quicker when I'm busy.
---
Yep there's literally no point in building walls because everything spawns on the inside anyway. I learned this in fallout 4 after spending ages building a three storey concrete foundation wall around kingsport lighthouse.
---
Could be a good start to a Fallout game had it had a narrative impact, a la the courier getting shot or your SO dying in cryostasis.
---
You come out of the vault ready to take on the world and make some positive change. As you exit the vault and your eyes adjust to the light, a baseball bat hits you square in the forehead. On the ground, in a daze, a raider looks down upon you and gives you the middle finger. He shuffles to the left, then the right, not sure which way to go, then just runs away.

---
It will likely - but the hate will never end.  They should get rid of non workshop PvP at least though, if not the trolling will never end.  Its plainfully obvious that a lot of PvP trolling goes on, it will never end if people can still do it outside workshops.
---
Unfortunately I would have to disagree that workshop PvP is working as intended too - people that only contest a workshop just cause of caps or PvP is not playing what the workshop PvP is meant to be.  It should be a contest for actual workshop ownership, not an outlet for PvP or quick caps.
---
Max Level - I had to wait 8 Levels for my Alt (37 at the time) to be able to use the Sole Survivor (Lvl45)
---
Maybe, we nuked all the silos, so maybe that did it, wish I could of got 3 in the pic tho.
---
I believe something has changed in the glassed cavern. It seems that scorched spawn now endlessly. If you make it to the end, stay in the area where the elevator is. There is an endless row of scorched that will try to enter that area for endless XP. Bring enough ammo......
---
For the love of god please stop using TS weapons lol.  Junkie's, Furious and Bloodied weapons do over twice the damage!!
---
You e soent more time on this than the developers have! Great job!
---
If all of these things were implemented I might come back to the game. It's become such a redundant grind lately I cant bring myself to pick it up :(. I just hit lvl 50 too ironically.
---
Haha, just checked, it is indeed yongyea. Must be short on rent money this month if he's coming back to the canvas bag
---
Yeah I work hard on my camp and want people there. More immersive. I also could see it backfiring. Glitches where you spend the caps but the product never gets delivered due to server crash or something. I would just rather see more detail in why someone is selling. Mainly I want to know if the weapons and armor are legendary or not. Maybe if they have serums. Maybe also if they have plans I don‚Äôt know. Either way I‚Äôm still going to check most of them out.
---
I did mine with a feral ghoul, and a non legendary combat knife I picked up in world. Maybe you're using a legendary or skinned weapon and it won't count? No idea. Try finding a random weapon though and see if it works.
---
Combat knife worked
---
Thank you I was worried the legendary was going to be 10 levels under the max. Also its a bloodied unarmed weapon this time if you didn't know already.
---
Auto Gernade Launcher is really powerful when used right, not much kill's things faster. It is pretty situational though.
---
We have a huge list of daily missions and yes tech data is awarded. We use a separate website one of our scribes created to award members with faction points or FP for short. FP is our towards each promotion so the more missions and campaigns you complete the more FP you gain and the more you‚Äôll get promoted üëç
---
F
---
It's obviously s sketchy way to get into a place... but I have this NEED to see people's CAMPs. I love it.
---
lmfaooo the anthem road map thing happened weeks or even months ago, and he made a video on it 2 days ago. Does this guy make a living specifically by bringing back old drama?
---
They are good against groups of weak enemies. Maybe that is their purpose and they simply are not meant to be good at single target damage. I run explosive heavy weapons build and use a Gatling laser or .50 lmg against powerful single targets.
---

---
this game good?
---
think of all the responses you could have given, an infinite possibility to say anything.
---
and you chose to bring negativity.  
---
I forgive you, but at the same time i kinda feel sorry for you.
---
I hope whatever hate and anger that fills you up so much you feel the need to spread negativity is one day addressed and overcame.
---
its not too late to make positive changes in your life!
---
You can only build stuff for them if you are on a team. I want to be able to go to some random persons camp and write little notes like ‚Äúgood job‚Äù or whatever.
---
Me and my friend started a survival mode only character and we couldn‚Äôt deal damage to other players until level 5. We never got attacked but I assume bullshit
---
Raped in the mouth by that damn inbred goat.  Now that theres pretty funny.  Even if losing your PA isn't.  Would renaming your power frame so it appears elsewhere help for next time?
---
Same here for me as late as today.  I hope this isn't using resources every time I try it

i definitely learned that lesson !

thank god..

I am so sick of the threads...
---
Ohhhhhh. Got it.
---
I have vowed to never make accounts on sites like that for this exact reason. Even reddit is a bit iffy, but I come here for news and discussions on the games I play with people who actually know what they're talking about. The only thing I know twitter for nowadays is trying to ruin people's lives over decade-old jokes or pretending to be outraged over the drama of the day
---
You were just having a bad dream during your nap. None of it really happened.
---
I was working on a trophy which is killing 20 people. Also, I was bored AF and curious how would the player react. He had a mic and kept saying: What's wrong with this guy.
---
Most people will cooperate as long as they believe their cooperation will lead to a better outcome for them personally. A smaller percentage will help because they understand game theory.
---
That's what twitter trolls do, though. Nothing... until something is trending, at which point they see it on their feed... and presto! Something to lend their sad little lives relevance.
---
Until the next thing comes along.
---
 Too much effort for the developers? That may be a valid criticism. There definitely are lots of bugs to keep them busy. The game is continuing to grow and develop however, changes that we as players and voices on various forums may influence. I've already heard discussions about mailboxes as a possible future addition.
---
You Ghandi'd them.
---
I think I clicked to unlock his door but I never actually did it I don‚Äôt think. It says ‚Äúavoid stealing or breaking in to avoid being wanted‚Äù
---
I don't like trespassing
---
I was thinking that missile launchers need a buff to airborne targets and targets larger than human/Super Mutant size. Like more damage to Deathclaws, Sheepsquatch, Scortchbeasts, and Hermit Crabs etc.
---
Sure. Add new10w. When I get on I‚Äôm down.
---
&gt; Also its a bloodied unarmed weapon this time if you didn't know already.
---
I'm aware, I was just using a very specific example that I experienced.
---
Modern marketing. This is it. Like it or not. 
---
I do not. I don't like the long term implications of where it's going to take us as a society.
---
It has it's ups and downs.  Your day can drag which stinks.  However being stress free is really great. 
---
   This job was coming off a super busy / stressful management position that was going to give me a heart attack.  Thankfully I got an opportunity to work a much quieter desk job.
---
Exactly same thing around Whitespring station. Level 50 something drawing people in PVP while a sneaky lvl 90 something with a bloodies sniper and VATS crit was ready to one-shot anybody dumb enough to react. I let them kill me 4x trying to figure out a way to kill them, but could not find a good strategy to kill both. After 4 gave them a sarcastic thumbs up and when on my business.
---
hopefully never..
---
Im more concerned with server stability than shiny objects...
---
Add me and let me know..
---
Yessir. 
---
Be like 30 mins.
---
press q on PC.. dunno the buttons for consoles...
---
Int is pretty useful as a Heavy char, need atleast 6 for Batteries included and Stabilized. Scrapper perk also helps with gathering steel and plastic from scrapped wepons &amp; armor when making bullets.
---
Only got 20 till it changes haha
---
Black ops 4 is another to add to the pile. Back in January, I was more excited to play BO4 than F76, but it's been getting progressively worse. The two latest updates are so bad that there's been a mass exodus back to previous CoDs or different games in general. Like you mentioned, Anthem is going through its own disaster. Whatever you can say about this game, at least it's getting better, not going down the shitter
---
*Triple nuke Fissure Site Prime during a radstorm while wearing full clown costume and intoxicated with Rum Rogers Reserve* - **10 Atoms**

600+ hrs into this game and have still never seen a rad storm
---
Ah but you‚Äôve forgotten one key detail...
---
My social anxiety üòÖ
---
Cause they are forwarding these via emails as opposed to literally copy and pasting each bug as new tickets/defects in jira. It‚Äôs the community manager ‚Äúnot my job‚Äù or ‚Äúi don‚Äôt have access‚Äù excuse. ANY other studio would have these types of issues resolved month one.
---
This could be whats causing the prob. Did mine with a bat i found cause i dont melee.
---
And that is why I have started hiding my camps. I have one spot where everything I need is already there and there's a place to hide the workbench. But I have already said too much.
---
Twitter is where most people think they're gonna get just enough followers to make them appealing to someone who will want to use them to sell their shit. 
---
That's it. It's about marketing reach, and getting people to do the work for you. "This shit disturber has 250,000 followers in our target demo! Let's pay them to push our crap.
---
That's it. 
---
It exists to give Twitter/Facebook *et al* a laughably easy source of market info to sell to companies, and to give companies a laughably easy way to reach customers. 
---
Fuckin' people have *willingly* turned themselves into an even larger, and more easily exploited resource then they ever were.
---
Or you get no location you can respawn at and you are forced to server hop.
---
ha! actually i do worry about that character, i noticed when he is supposed to be "sleeping" HE NEVER ACTUALLY CLOSES HIS EYES!
---
its like the wasteland has shell shocked him to the point he is so traumatized by mutants and radiation and the spectre of doom he cant actually sleep.
---
you may be right, he might have just hallucinated the whole thing!
---
It is interesting when you look at the view counts on his videos. The ones where he's condemning a game or a company are dramatically higher than those where he's talking about something positively. That means there's more ad revenue available to him if he keeps stirring up hate and anger. He knows where his rent money is coming from: it comes from inflaming the negative passions of people who want to be told who to hate.
---
Fallout 76 hazing, welcome to the frat brother.
---
"Thank you Sir, may I have another? "
---
It's... June 6th.
---
and there has been word and update. Just... not if you're looking for a reason to be outraged about it.
---
I guess that‚Äôs what you get for trying to help people.
---
*megalomania intensifies*
---
If you're on XB1, drop me your IGN - I'll replace the 1k shells you spent on the house.
---
hopefully this does not take off...
---
Same here brother. It's easier when youre both flashing Nuke Emojis than trying to talk to a girl that's out of your league. Lol
---
I guess it was just me that didn‚Äôt know that. I mean I knew you couldn‚Äôt trade atom paints and such. Didn‚Äôt know it would destroy it though, I‚Äôm not sure what I thought it did. Never thought about it. I feel there should be a better safeguard for that. Don‚Äôt know what would be better but Damnet I‚Äôm still mad and I blame the game, it‚Äôs never user error!
---
Me too. I just picked up the first weapon I found in the forest and killed the first ghoul I saw.
---
I agree Berserker needs defending. I just think that the basic premise of legendary having a negative effect and a positive thats not super strong is bad. Berserker on the other hand deserves a set of new perks to make 0DR another flavour of bloodied.
---
The can just make them do more damage to certain enemies like flying enemies. Maybe make the cripple damage splash so wings get taken out easier on indirect hits.
---
There isn't much to research, most of this falls under known trends already. People are already so negatively prejudiced against this game that they are going out of their way to find any way they can to shit on it. And from there, mob mentality takes the wheel. Combine it with the radicalization that anonymity and impersonal interaction allows, and you get the problems we have here
---
*BadSausageFactory then slowly creeps back into the woods, disappearing into the wasteland*
---
They use to be rare, they changed that and i see one almost daily now, mire frequent around nukes now as well
---
I agree with you about removing world PvP, there are ways to bait someone into fighting via team invites or by triggering the mutations they have. It would make sense for adventure mode and I think it would satisfy the game community.
---
Besthesda made it really profitable to do PvP, the cap drops and junk was enough to encourage large number of players to raid anyone who owned a workshop. It was even worst when you could gank anywhere on the map.
---
I have seen a few ideas to overhaul the workshops, most of them being timers and other ways to share. But people will always find a way to abuse the systems in place.
---
I know but I can't handle the anxiety of bloodied. I get panicky when my health drops below 50%. And being a sniper, I'm squishy anyway. I'm trying to find an AAE handmade but people only want to trade for god-roll legendaries and won't take caps. So I use what I've got. It gets the job done.
---
I would hope that is what has happened to all the players whose shops I was in as they vanished. I have a vendor camp and if I am going to jump servers I return to my camp and check to makes sure I'm not wrecking my rep as a vendor by leaving while someone is perusing my goods. Before anyone says they check the map before jumping it may not have occurred to you that some players are eternally in sneak and you won't see that they are at you camp on the map.
---
Also, please to all vendor camps, stop putting a foundation over the spot you dropped your camp unit, other players will spawn within a couple meters of where you placed the C.A.M.P. unit.
---
End game players can get a ak to shoot 500 1 bullet and melee bloody can get up to 10k.... never seen a fat man over 1500.
---
I'm sure that player PVP is only a thing at level 5 and above
---
I have a vampires combat shotgun that I'm not speced for.  It allows me to go face to face with those giant goats without taking damage...thats the only reason I carry it.  The 10mm auto is a great idea - low weight, and only does the damage you want.  And who doesn't love firing the 10mm?  I may swap out the shotgun for a while.
---
You know, it probably would have lol none the less I‚Äôm still pretty burned about it. And I felt I needed to share my frustration
---
If you see me waving across the office right now, then yes.
---
&gt; This!
---
Is that a thumbs up? agree? dis-agree?
---
Yes, all mutations still work while in PA.
---
interesting. i'll have to keep an eye out
---
Pvp in powerarmor is not gonna end well...
---
This is my issue. We, as a species, thrive on the negative. We love it.
---
And, IMO, it creates a downward spiral and "colours" everything we do. 
---
But, we love to be "righteously" angry... even when we're not right.
---
Scorch plague origin confirmed.
---
I don't like being locked out.
---
Looking up for a cylon attack! Look that one as a "69" on his title..
---
 Why not? Are you opposed to people being able to peruse a camp's vender inventory before travelling across the map? Or do you not like the idea of trying to come up with repeatable missions that might actually take you to more people's camps?
---
Just look through perks upon leveling up and see which will be the best at that time for your build. They unlock slowly over time, and some of the best perks are at level 40+. If you don't want anything, you can just save your level up point to claim later. Most perks can be maxed out as soon as you get them (i.e all ranks are available) but a couple of them like lockpicking, hacking, and science crafting are split into different cards that unlock at different levels to prevent that. So once you unlock gunsmith, you can use five level up points to max that immediately. But you can only invest three points into rifleman until you unlock master rifleman and expert rifleman too
---
Karma's a bitch they say ;)
---
200 hours for lvl 8? Must be some speedrunning strats
---
There are a lot of interesting stories with the dead NPCs. I just feel like a lot of people miss NPCs because they hand feed the stories. I think when people really understand why there aren‚Äôt any NPCs it makes sense. I think they‚Äôll add them eventually, but I think the game is fine with US as the NPCs.
---
That guy lives on controversy.  Literally.  It's all his channel is about anymore.  He's trying to get into voice acting now so who knows, if that takes off there might be a few hundred fewer angry people on twitter.
---
Yeah gonna have to agree to disagree there I think  :)
---
We already have plenty of NPCs, some of which have very memorable characters. What exactly do you expect out of a MMO? There are clear limitations to what NPCs can do, and we've already reached them
---
Well private property is considered evil if you're into socialism. Maybe you were in a server of college kids lol.
---
Read to the brave yao guai camera attack - got me already laughing like hell.
---
By all the things went wrong, thanks for sharing. One of the funniest as well as thrilled wasteland storys i heard so far.
---
Greetings to wife also - fingers crossed for ya next try!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about a specific build at all for the first few hundred hours. Just explore and put points into whatever you‚Äôre currently enjoying doing. If you stick with the game long enough to need to worry about specific builds, you‚Äôll have enough points saved up to where you can completely revamp your character later
---
Yeah, I sell mine at my vendor for 99 caps each, except forest.
---
**Sort your machines**
---
yeah, im guilty of not doing this, its a mix in every machine...
---
eventually i should organize them better i guess, but those damn molemen keep attacking my CAMP each and every time someone Spawns into my CAMP!
---
I got mine from killing a scorched at the west bend tunnel with a cultist's dagger
---
well 1 or 2 stars are worth next to nothing. only chips to reroll.
---
but SBQ is the catalyst to summon those hordes that come right to you unlike whitespring those greeny bulbs. to me steak of deathclaw is worth more than piece of 1 star armor.  
---
So my option is that it's not worth to nuke whitespring. (thought i never leveled because touchdown and for my understanding it was exploit back in the days to get a lot levels instantly)
---
It‚Äôs clearly intended.  Stop acting like it‚Äôs a mistake or bad coding, argue the merits of what you‚Äôd like to see instead.
---
 If the mission was set up that the "package" was just a chit, if it was failed nobody would lose anything but time. Course it is Bethesda so.....
---
Additionally mine changes by 100 lbs/KG/(units) often and for no apparent reason.
---
No what?  You are terrible at persuasion or arguing your case.
---
Maybe those used at a radio tower at the forest should only be for low levels and the rest is for us üòÅ

We all seen that one level 12 in Watoga, buying plans. Then the entire zone around is filled with level 40s instead of 60s...

Because **"Nylon"** ... Some still can't have a laugh about it till they may get there duffles finally.

They aren‚Äôt walls.  Don‚Äôt make assumptions.  It‚Äôs clearly how foundations are supposed to work, they are not walls.
---
Probably easiest is to just remove the caps drops and non workshop PvP from adventure mode - as much as I'd rather have an alternative method for contesting, this is much easier for Bethesda to patch into the game and should get rid of most of the abuses.  Its really unfortunate but there's enough bad apples out there that has caused a really low perception of all PvP players, and a lot of this is on Bethesda for not having Survival mode from the launch and more restrictions in place sooner in Adventure mode.
---
Problem is the date never changes, it is \_\_Always\_\_ reclamation day
---
yes
---
Yeah I play afternoons for quests and scripts legendary, 
---
Later at night crafting , base building and farming flux with any nuke drops.

There's an article I read about this a few months ago entitled "[the cruelty is the point](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/)," which really got me to thinking seriously about what this says about us as a species. It's worthwhile reading.
---
Well I definitely gotta check that out
---
You are so clueless, you can‚Äôt even tell when someone is making fun of you.
---
...are we then finally allowed to make canvas jokes without getting downvoted...?
---
You can do it without being detected, sure. A full set of chameleon armor lets you walk right up to scorchbeasts and deathclaws and only staying in caution. Not attacking anything would be fine until the end where waves of robots come to destroy the launch bots you have to protect. I'm sure you could still do it, it would just be very time consuming because they would barely get anything done (the progress is a bit slow to begin with) before they died and needed to be respawned and walk all the way back to their station
---
yea i just put 10/50 of them to sale for 6 caps/each.
---
and few times have already droped stacks of 30 them. (after the patch that only one could be active at the time.)
---
Pharma farma is the best one to use at a low level. Just remember you have to press an extra button when you come across medic stuff in order to search it.
---
But we like how they look and we want to be good guys.  /s

WELCOME TO SURVIVAL KIDDO
---
Much better than pushing out a broken feature that gets exploited
---
In other news: water is still wet
---
I believe this  complaint might be at the bottom of their priorities tbh.
---
Thanks for responding. About the camp platform placement thing you mentioned, it‚Äôs not working for me. I paid extra care to place it down where I wasn‚Äôt building when I moved camp last time, and people are still spawning everywhere. Hell, I‚Äôm spawning inside my own generator room (unlocked) Lol.
---
I don't understand, why would I?
---
Tried that and so have others, the 2nd char does not trigger for us.
---
Even if it did work..that's still an issue that us faithful have and can't get fixed. Remember we showed (now to be seen as unfounded) faith in the publisher and are getting penalized for it!!!! that's wrong on SO many levels.
---
This is why I've moved my camparooni to be hidden down the cliff. You FT in and see a shit shack with some vending, but don't realize there's a floating base down the cliff.
---
And, you get that incredulous look and amazement from new players wondering just how you killed that Super Mutant.  
---
With the silencer, the 10mm is a really quiet weapon so you hardly hear it...  it looks like you are just pointing and they suddenly fall dead. 
---
My 10mm is a one star +30% to Super Mutants.  Got it early on and it‚Äôs one of my favorite weapons when I get tired of all the noise from my other weapons.  Plus, it takes up a lot less screen space.  I find that most guns take up way too much screen real estate.
---
you seem grumpy... does somebody need a nap?
---
rapped*
---
The anecdotal idea that stats effects legendary drops seems very unlikely. I have compared my statistics made up from thousands of drops with others that have done the same from large sample sizes and even though our stats differ widely we have the exact same numbers in the end.
---
Think of it as when doctors smack a babies butt when they‚Äôre born.
---
You fucking legend
---
If you're following a specific build from a video, go to the build planner on the nukes and dragons website and fill out the perks you want. That will generate a leveling guide for you to follow.
---
Well, now you know, we all learned something here.
---
Side note, the warning goes at the same speed your fi her does, also, don't drop junk from the inventory menu.
---
I've been avoiding that event as it always pops while I'm off doing something else or in my way to something else...guess I finally have a reason to do it.
---
Nashville?

Facebook and twitter exist to manipulate thought and socially engineer people. The funny thing is that the people telling the sheep that they're oppressed and exploited, are the ones oppressing and exploiting them lol.

But it's all good because Starbucks have a pride flag on their cups. As if they care about anything other than using important issues to further their own agenda's.

You couldn't make this shit up, yet people are so willfully ignorant and easily outraged, that you'll get called homophobic or a Nazi for pointing it out.

HONK HONK!!

Management I couldn't do. I work in IT, so having lots of projects and being busy fixing things is great for me. I work well under pressure though. When bored I become a horrible worker.

I need a nuke card drop, and if that doesn't work U AM sitting on eight requisition tapes.
---
I refuse to express how hard I laughed right about here. I won't do it!
---
It was pretty fckn hard, I coughed.
---
Dude I hate his voice so much. Nothing against him personally but every word he says no matter the context makes me sad.
---
What bothers me is that everyone just assumes that power armor can't be good in pvp. Why the hell not? IMO that's just absolutely horrible design on Bethesda's part, and it should be fixed.
---
Yeah frankly I'm sick of it. Haven't even played the game in a couple of days. I don't give a shit about any "meta." I like my power armor heavy weapons build, and if it sucks in PVP then that means PVP sucks, not my build.    I'm not going to grind for endless hours just so I can get my build right for PVP. Fuck that.
---
Atlanta.
---
Thx cap!
---
Just to let you know, it works for all my characters.
---
need new guns, lazy bethesda.
---
Bloodied SS to a scorched noggin did it for me.
---
Honestly... if I saw at least 1 or 2 people doing it I would... but when you see 1* weapons for 2500 not even fixed, and same for armor not too mention serums between 800-1200 caps... which seems common, I think I‚Äôm below price... 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong... I asked this thinking I‚Äôm over priced but I went to at least 15 different worlds yesterday looking all over and many prices were wayyyyy over the top and people buying! Crazy!
---
In the study people helped, even at a cost to themselves. We are not as bad as we often believe. While today's society often brig out the worst in us, we are, basically, group animals. When we revert to our instincts we often stop to think about ourselves and, quite naturally, act in a way that benefits the group first.
---
We are better than we seem.
---
I had a couple kids running a live vendor one night.  Surprised the hell outta me.  Good prices though and knew what they were doing, so more power to 'em.  Besides the sucking on a sucker in the mouthpiece, they were polite and not cussing.
---
Yes...
---
could be! those damn idealistic college kids fighting for the proletariat! 
---
when i was in college all i cared about were girls and drugs... Che Guevara wasnt nearly as interesting as the B.T.G. girl from 3rd floor and her triple chamber bong
---
every now and then id even attend classes! :)
---
Yeah but the workshop spits out power cores and I AM down...good idea on this one and I can wipe out the (power up a reactor) challenge and lead deposit miner at the same time.
---
It's a reward from encryptid
---
I wonder if weightless + harder to detect + Chameleon mutation would be the best combo?
---
Agreed! Unless I know someone looking for it it goes to the scrapper!
---
I might have missed you mentioning this, but which platform are you on?
---
I'll take a look right now :) .. can't stay on but I can have a boo..
---
I'll make sure I leave a surprise in my camp.
---
He actually puts his cigar in right after he says "earth". Followed by a mispronounced "that's what I call a close encounter". So I think it's kind of a Mandela Effect thing where everyone remembers him slurring the whole scene due to the cigar.
---
You start with limited resources, your stats will be low and your perk cards few.  Both increase over time as you level.  Perk cards are random draws and some are level locked so it takes time to max out a particular build.  At low level you more at the mercy of what you find and the luck of the draw as far as a build goes.  Many players concentrate on strength early as that helps you carry more stuff and at low level you will probably have to have multiple weapons and ammo as you will run out of ammo often if you try to stay with one weapon.  The other reason for strength being melee is cheaper than ranged, no ammo to worry about.  So get your strength where you want it to be early and also fill out the rest of your stats in accordance with the perk cards you get that you want to use.  Don't rush to combine perk cards until you are certain you want that perk at that level long term as you cannot un-combine them.  Good luck.
---
&gt; That perk only affects rifles...
---
Thanks for the extremely useful advice.
---
Oh, I've been isolating myself from social media so much that I forgot it's the time of the year everybody pretends to care for a cause by putting rainbow on everything. I'm pretty glad this game isn't doing that. Real support is shown through action, not selling things with rainbows on them
---
Serious words of wisdom
---
I don't think so, since chameleon armor stacks and idk how powerful the effect of the chameleon mutation is.
---
It can be confusing for sure, and a bit frustrating when you are level 15 and you really want a perk that's locked behind level 40. As Henny suggests you may want to take some perks early on that you won't really use later and that's totally fine (I did this with pistol perks even though I knew I would eventually be using rifles). How you spend the points on SPECIAL is more important if your trying to become a certain type of build (VATs Rifleman? Points in Perception, Luck, and Agility are important). But don't worry too much about that early on unless you already know what type of character you like to play.
---
I kind of kept a list of the perks I knew wanted and what level they'd become obtainable. That way I would spend points in the SPECIAL categories I knew I'd need for those perks, even though the actual perk I wanted wasn't available yet.
---
List of perks and levels:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_perks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks)
---
The game was rigged from the start
---
This is hilarious.  Kinda scary but still hilarious.
---
Thank goodness! Ready to stop hearing about it.
---
I'll try adjusti g my position then, I always go sideshot for vertibot pics as it often gives it a better "look" (yeah, I'm one of those weird tourist players whose character is snapping pics of everything and everyone).
---
you mean make it into another wow clone but with more bugs
---
Workshops are nice because you can just absolutely load them down with shots from a dozen or more free turrets. Especially when they are properly placed. 
---
I don't even bother with them in CAMP. It's such a waste of build space.
---
You can't on PC
---
I think they need to implement personal terminals.
---
CAMP Terminals, pip-boy personal journals, and even a way to bring text chat in a lore friendly way.
---
I‚Äôm hoping we see some npc‚Äôs when we get the wastelanders content.
---
Then I can set them up to picking corn and scrubbing the damn rust off my walls.
---
Would make sense lore wise.  The 76ers fight back a huge threat, things go back to normal. Few people, lots of land, some of it fertile and pristine, plenty of tech, it‚Äôs going to draw in more people from the surrounding areas.  Perhaps the Son of Dane will come back!
---
Unpopular opinion: I hope this game doesnt get npcs and players embrace role-playing and create their own characters and stories, that would truly make this game legendary.
---
I would assume that just a full set of chameleon armor would be the best, but idk how strong the chameleon mutation is and how much benefit harder to detect armor gives you. Maybe a full set of shadowed weightless armor with that effect and while using the fixer might be worth a shot
---
I wish I had a build planned and followed this guide from Day 1...
---
That Berserker idea is great. I‚Äôd like to see that philosophy applied in a broader sense. Remove generic perks like +dmg to mob types because they aren‚Äôt interesting and don‚Äôt have synergy with a build. Make it so whatever primary affix you get on a legendary really enables a particular build, and let the second and third ones decide whether a weapon is useable or godlike. 
---
Perfect example of this in action. I use a 1* Insitigating Lever-Action for normal farming and scavving because it already one shots most mobs with a rifle/VATS build. Wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if everyone could get a measly 1* that enabled their build properly instead of just using whatever weapon has the highest paper dmg number?
---
This is already going pretty wide, and I don‚Äôt want to be one of those ‚Äúrework the whole fuckin game‚Äù people, so I‚Äôll just leave it at I like the idea of fewer generic perks and affixes, and a more heterogenous bunch of players who actually seem like they are doing different things.
---
&gt;Well, the fat man has really low DPS due to its long reload. It's intended as a one-shot weapon.
---
You just contradicted your own sentence.
---
And as a one-shot weapon, you don't go by its Damage Per Second but its burst.
---
The mods are cool and it's fun to use but the chainsaw itself is only available at level 20 and there are no legendary drops. This is a terrible shame. Anyone know how to shake up a response from Bethesda?
---
This is a currency issue that translates REAL $$ not silly "Whaaaaaa I this is broken" this is unfair trade.. and I think it deserves the highest priority as it's store related. I'm working a partial refund action with Amazon related to this. If that fails, a partial credit card charge back.
---
We have NPCs. Just not human ones.
---
I tried one against a sheepsquatch, I was level 24 and it was level 50. Sneak, headshot and critical, I was expecting to hurt it. Nothing. My legendary suppressed shotgun did duoble the (little) damage. I hadn't any damage boosting perk. I tossed the missile launcher e sneaked back to my CAMP in tears.
---
And knowing is half the battle in G.I. Joe land
---
Hell yeah
---
I will sell one yet!!
---
If anyone gets triggered over a locked door I‚Äôd hate to see them in real life... guess their parents failed on an epic level...
---
This is fundamentally why I simply avoid PvP in FO76 - its all builds based and gear dependent that influences who has the upper hand rather than player skills.  The same is true of other games in other genres that's influenced a lot by what you have obtained/owned - I got tried of Clash Royale cause its impossible to keep up with the big spenders.  Same thing is true even in older formats - Magic The Gathering for example.
---
Hey, at least you get some kind of option. I often die with NOWHERE to respawn to.
---
I 100% agree. Most of the workshop ganking occurs because of the huge potential reward payouts. Losing an inventory of junk and your level in caps (prior to patch) would leave a bad taste in anyone's mouth, especially a new player who wasn't familiar with the mechanics just wanted to give 76 a try. 
---
PvP in this game is like a fine aged cheese. In my opinion it's delicious, but It's an acquired taste, and it's....very cheesy. I completely understand why many players do not wish to partake, and why they would want it removed. 
---
If they remove the cap and junk drops from adventure, I believe it would benefit the PvP community if they increased the drops on survival to compensate.
---
Both vendors and caps reset hour ago - even when I sold some items today. Furthermore, this would not explain cap stashes, as they have been empty long after 20 hours. I would say some of their backend system for tracking these things was not working properly. BTW I dont really understand the downvotes, as this was simple question if anyone is experiencing same issues.
---
There's no way you did 40% of damage with a chainsaw. I think you're probably taking credit for what the guy with the bloodied 50 cal behind you was doing.
---
Video or it didn't happen.
---
I spawned into a totally locked house last night while browsing vendors. No. Way. Out. + the kicker was that the vending machines were not IN the house, not that I would've purchased after being essentially held hostage (lol, yes I know I could fast travel, and I did). So since I was fresh out of "You've been insulted" notes. . . I left a steaming, fresh raw fertilizer on the pillow of their bed. That'll teach 'em.
---
Or you could man up and deal with it. You got killed after hitting someone who probably thought you wanted to pvp. Don't take workshops if you don't want pvp.
---
Exactly. I get the disappointment but enough is enough. You got a power armor helmet! It certainly seems like people cared more about a bag than a video game.
---
"Till I get bored and let him kill me"
---
Suuuure
---
DPS is the only thing that matters in a fight as long as the scorchbeast queen. The fat man will kill a gulper before a high dps low damage weapon. A high dps low damage weapon will be more effective than a high damage low dps weapon against the queen every time
---
He sounds slot like me while playing (well, minus the twelve part).  I swear I was walking through a billing on a junk run and got into sneak mode to reach stuff, so I started going "sneaky sneaky sneaky...sneaky sneaky OH CRAP!". I had thought I cleared the building but the Mole Miner I walked into begged to differ (yes, I do literally walk into enemies because I have a "looking around" problem.
---
Got the friend on my list, thanks mate. I'll catch you whenever.
---
Ganbare!!
---
Usually it's 76,but I lso get alot of random locations, one was the powder resort, the nar train wreck, aaronholt homestead, or the crashed plane in the mire.
---
Only work around that I have seen is being on a team and being able to respawn on a teammate, I don't usually play on a team tho.
---
My example of a "good sale" is when I was shopping the other time, I find a 2* Bloodied and explodes for area effect on a Combat rifle. The man sells it for 500 caps in his machine. This is a fair mans wage.
---
I just woke up, so please bear with me.  That would be found under the "Notes" and scrolling to "Recipe: Antibiotics" would it not?
---
I dream about games too if I played too much üòÇ my NMS ones are usually pretty epic. Also a mom of two and yes when it gets hectic and I don‚Äôt play any games for a while I do get twitchy. It‚Äôs my outlet so stress levels rise when I go on hiatus.
---
I had one guy launch a missile at me outside Morgantown for no reason, didn't kill me but I'll take that as a 'get off my property' I suppose.
---
And the youtube videos T-T
---
Mentioning that you‚Äôd like to order a sammich from their mom over the mic calms them down a lot especially when you say how great a sammich their gf makes...lol
---
Shooting nukes at the queen should be a viable strategy.
---
I'll be sure to leave bio fluid on your bed.
---
What's the point of launching 2-3 nukes on prime at the same time? I seem to see this happening more often.
---
Jokes on you, I don't have one.
---
Am level 130. Have been playing for two months. Just figured this out last week. The expand is ONLY available on icons you have more than one of (ie ‚Äúteam up‚Äù will expand if you have ‚Äúlet‚Äôs nuke‚Äù).
---
It‚Äôs poor scaling. So 1-mid game should be somewhat easy. Mid game it starts to get harder and harder until you hit max level aka 50 and then from there it should get progressively easier since you‚Äôre getting better and better gear while the damage of enemies shouldn‚Äôt scale up
---
I didn't feel like server hopping so I just let him do it to break the revenge loop and block him.
---
How odd, on Xbox they litterally vanish before my eyes.  PS4 doesn't seem to want to play nice with the game.
---
&gt; its all builds based and gear dependent 
---
This has become the most off-putting feature of the game for me. 
---
"All MMOs are like that," they will say. 
---
'
---
Well guess what? That argument ***doesn't mean shit*** to people like me who only bought this because it was a Fallout game and  don't give a damn about MMOs.  
---
I have never played any MMO, and have no desire to play one ever again, and have no desire to play a Fallout MMO.  There are plenty of people like me.  So Bethesda needs a mode for such people unless they want the player base to dwindle.
---
Welcome to reality, little one.
---
227 here...
---
I do a lot of events and take a workshops (defend and retake).  I also attend a lot of Nuke events for the legendary drops and for the flora.  Plus, my camp is in the Mire.  So I tend to run into higher level enemies.   
---
I also run the Top of the World area at least once a session.  Lots of enemies and they scale...
---
I found that I put in much more effort into getting from level 1 to 100 than from 100 to 200.  The XP just seems to accumulate now.
---
Would personally suggest not 3ing perk cards til 20 or even 30.  At lower levels the perk cards from the pack appear to be capped (you won‚Äôt get gun fu at lvl 10) you have a good chance of getting some free useful perks so you can pick up utility perks.
---
Pharma farma, green thumb, and traveling pharmacy are very powerful and useful perks that may not fit into a final build as passive, but are great go-to cards.
---
Well if you think everything in the forest started this way millions of years ago. If we hade been more selfish than cooperating, at this time we would be still living in caves...
---
Trying the whole workshop thing... Taking like 10 minutes to find the enemies to clear the workshops. Super annoying, especially with low AP and no mutations. Was at Wade airport and took ten minutes to clear, and then when the attack happened I never found the last mongrel. Think I'll stick with quests lmao
---
&gt;I am so sick of the threads...
---
of nylon or canvas?
---
Not at the moment.
---
&gt; if it's slow or unreliable nothing else will matter,
---
So correct. If I ever said let's keep adding features before we addressed stability, or if pushing out those new features destroyed stability (picking my works carefully) of prior functionality, I'd be standing in front of the CIO's desk or most certainly.... I'd be fired. If it happened repeatedly.. I'm just not performing my duties, and would not even see the CIO!.. just.. well. Fired.
---
You can see a little grey section of the health bar which is your own contribution - using a weapon like this it keeps growing as you do damage until you take your finger off the trigger. I ran in like a suicidal maniac but she wasn't moving a whole lot. I think the chainsaw was staggering the beast, plenty of people were taking tiny dents out of her health bar but I could see my own chunk and it was substantial. We did 3 sbq events that day so I managed to repeat the madness to confirm it. Didn't work out so well with a more active aggressive sbq on another occasion.
---
 I'm not in the habit of making shit up to sell a 350 cap chainsaw - nearly at max caps as it is. I don't record video while playing games - PC is due an upgrade. Why not try it yourself if you're brave enough.
---
Yea if anything is just hope they focus more on the NPCs they have in the game like Graham and Mrmm.
---
Because it would be sensible and convenient which is something Bethesda has a hard time understanding.
---
Your best bet is to save up your caps by selling extra aid items and spare junk to the train station vendors. Then buy weapons and armor from player vendors. I know tons of high level people who run who run low level events for various reasons then end up with low level legendaries they have no use for and a lot of the time they will sell these low level legendaries for cheap at their shops. Happy hunting!
---
You can‚Äôt but finding a brown paper bag full with spoiled meat and toilet paper on your bed is bad enough.
---
Like you say that, but most of the people I have met are "altruistic" for selfish reasons and depending on what is on the line things change drastically.
---
As an anecdote, I was in a situation where a four story apartment building with no fire escapes caught fire and people were trapped and couldn't get out. There were about 5 of us that were actually putting ourselves at risk to grab ladders and other equipment out of the buildings garage to help other escape, but there were literal hundreds of people just standing around filming these people scream and cry for help as they died.
---
So while I get what you are saying, and the study is probably correct (I am sure those displaced in the fire were given a ton of assistance after the fact) I think there is more too it. People are driven to help others largely because it makes them feel good in my observation, and the number of people willing to help changes drastically as the risk to life increases.
---
Exactly, yet the masses lap it up like good little lemmings.
---
With PS4 controllers it happens to me all the time - all I have to do it set the controller down on the couch and I'm firing off shots. Awful design on those things.
---
I really want more story lines that are engrossing :c.
---
"Msg to haggle"
---
If you were there now she would've had sex with you and accused you of assault the next morning haha.
---
Til the last lock breaks none of us are free ‚úä
---
Oh... I can leave Bio fluid *anywhere*.
---
Don't really do Survival myself but from what I've heard I would think it would benefit from some non-PvP zones...  basically around fast travel points ie. train stations and Vault 76.  Get rids of spawn camping, allows people a chance to safely visit vendors, should lead to more organic PvP in the open world.  The rewards certainly need to be balanced to the risk.
---
Yea I dont get people getting mad at this. They are getting what they bought and im happy and proud that as customers they are getting this when they could just been ignored.
---
Tracked challenges should be displayed in the HUD, like quests. Its a pain to bring up the map, go to challenges and scroll down to find what you want every time you need to remember what exactly you need to do
---
But I want exploitable features to complain about neowwwwwww
---
So trie.
---
Shit. I'd buy this irl. Well-done!
---
I felt bad for a 2nd day noob who I was helping. Just for fun I orbital struck her camp, knowing it wouldn't do any damage - except I hadn't accounted for the Brahmin getting deceased in the process.
---
I love it, and I think you're very talented.
---
Okay, that is freaking sweeeet!!!!! I love it!
---
Power armor combined with melee will get you through these levels fairly efficiently.  I have 10 characters on two accounts so I've had to do this quite a bit.
---
Haha I love this. 
---
I had (taking a break til more content comes) the exact same set up at WS station. Big party camp, tons of tragic coming through constantly. But I always keep my doors open. 
---
I dont know why but I HATE when people lock up their doors. 
---
Lock your resources sure, why not, but a lot of the fun was popp9ng around and checking out builds.  There is no point in locking your front door except to seem elitist to me. 
---
Yeah I get enemies cant come inside anymore, fair enough, but come on. You ain't hot shit cause you locked up the room your bed is in. I just dont see the point. 
---
If I see a locked door I will do everything I possibly can to get inside and leave a bag of trash on your bed. 
---
People spend all this real world cash or all the atoms they've got saved up to get flooring and special beds and furniture, then lock it behind a door so only them and their little gank squad can huddle inside and feel special.
---
You can make a viable build for any weapon using just perks, without any legendary effects. Instigating sniper works well, junkie's is interesting too. Berserker's is an option for a naked character, but I don't think losing out on 5 pieces of legendary armor is worth the damage boost. The best part about this game is you can make a build around a specific legendary weapon rather than just starting a build
---
From a data point of view, it is... why would i rather have a leg piece with flat armor resist vs lower armor resist and 3 potential perks? It‚Äôs a trade off... it‚Äôs easy af to get power armor while armor is an actual challenge. If i was a normal 50 i could put together a t60 set in 4 fast travel locations... when i first started i thought power armor was end game... boy was i wrong. Power is shit at pvp cause the bonuses gained from normal armor while trading off environment factors and armor is more desirable.
---
Agreed. Once you get enough perk cards and the right weapon and Armour load out to compliment your style you can squish everything and be on reddit at the same time and not even get scratched.
---
Telling you to go outside more often is being negative?
---
Only a shut-in would think such a thing.  ;)
---
I literally just busted out laughing at this. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I don't even think there was even two people actually mad about the bag.
---
Downvote the truth sorry no butterfly kisses for you
---
Mine was far from low effort. I spent 8 hours building a cliffside plantation home that would be ‚Äúroughly‚Äù over 2400 sq ft and had very little for the interior. 
---
Now I‚Äôm quietly placed back in the Forest to forever extract junk outside Morganstown in my metal watchtower. Took a while to figure out how to build upward around the trees with adequate safety rails and budget control. 
---
I went with a functional build where players can stop by and access everything along the outside walls of the main floor. Made thousands of caps here in my first few days as people of all levels come through.
---
To note on your comment, I‚Äôve seen some ass builds that are barely functional. Some players are too low to have the proper plans and knowledge. Others are owned by high levels and they hop around the map and other servers in search of stuff.
---
Oh man, don‚Äôt even get me started on PS4 controllers, I use it as my DVD player now basically. And I‚Äôll have it on the bed and I‚Äôll just sit and it will start skipping scenes....
---
I actually had it randomly spawn last night at Too of the World on Xbox on one of the tables at the base.
---
just curious: is there any other way to get onto it other then using the jetpack?
---
No one wants to spend that many caps on a temp buff. Just try to think about it if you were the one buying and using it.
---
So generally people like to make a build around a specific type of weapon or legendary effect. So they will choose armor weapons and perks to compliment eachother. There are good effects on both weapons and armor to consider just to name a few besides bloodied that are worth considering: (Weapon Legendary Effects) Furious, Instigating, Executioners, Mutants and Junkies. (Armor Legendary Effects) Bolstering, Sentinel, Cavalier and Vanguard. Don't take this as a difinitive list these are just the relevant ones that I see people use all the time.
---
Yeah. Everyone ordered that for the helmet and the bag hysteria was pure kneejerk.
---
Ah shit....
---
I have 1 door in my camp locked...my bedroom...so I can nap without people running up to me with the trade emote, and to go through my stash box making space, switching things around, etc.  I've watched people try getting in through windows, use the angry emote outside my bedroom windows, just get upset.  Like you, everything they need is accessible , but they must get in that locked room for some reason!  When I leave the room, I do leave the door open, it's only locked when I'm inside there.
---
Excellent!
---
I had one this morning in Watoga. May have been because prime was nuked sometime earlier but was confused by the green glow and radiation suddenly.
---
I had an instigating spear that would pretty much 1 shot anything but super mutants and higher gutsys. I'm pretty sure that's why I didn't get bogged down leveling
---
Sick pic..where are u standing?
---
Cool more supplies for me to use. TBH I pick up everything even spoiled.
---
Ehh I think a BoS vendor with faction-only rewards could take up excess ammo. Donate x amount of y and you can get a or b reward. Could be an atom daily challenge.
---
[https://imgur.com/lKNkwy6](https://imgur.com/lKNkwy6) Not hard evidence - but it shows bravery in the face of a huge beastie at least!
---
If people really knew how low quality the helmet feels and looks in person, they'd want a nice, crisp as-advertised canvas bag to cover it up, too. Except now I have to cover it up with shitty nylon thank god I'm getting the one thing in this stupid edition that'll make me feel a bit better about buying it.
---
Clothes bug (thank you for getting to these):
---
Sometimes dresses (I've noticed it with all Asylum Uniforms but Red bc I don't have that one, the Civil War Dress and the Witch Dress) clip the front of your thighs out when you play piano.
---
Sometimes the Civil War Dress will go crazy around your legs as the clipping messes up
---
Jumping in the default Pioneer Scout uniform with a female model shows off it's underwear, as does doing the Lotus/Sitting photomode pose while wearing an Asylum Uniform.
---
"Nurse Uniform" outfit has the exact same model as "Asylum Uniform White Clean". Intentional?
---
Either the Travelling Leather Coat or the Tattered Field Jacket (will confirm which I have momentarily) allows Trapper Chest Armor model to clip through. It looks neat but obviously isn't intended.
---
Armor:
---
Trapper Armor seems to break way faster than other armor with a similar sized health bar. I wish we could see numbers.
---
The point of what the video said is that if you want to sell useless legendaries you do it by the amount of scrip they are worth because that is why people would buy them.
---
Mine empties when I don't log-in properly. (Like right now, I tried to join a world and got an immediate \*disconnected from server\* message. Logged back in and my machine is empty.)
---
Third time so far, always due to a failure to join a world due to the crashing or disconnecting at login.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one with multiple characters. Kind of fun sending a low-level character off on  a Nukashine binge. Poor Ulric died many times before accidentally finding the Purveyor/safe place. LOL
---
hi, im on Ps4
---
I agree.  I was skeptical about no NPCs as well as other things prior to release but after playing and seeing how everything has turned out, I've fully embraced the direction this game took.  It's such a unique game.  It was never meant to be a traditional Fallout RPG and I hope they make another one like this after Fallout 5.
---
To be honest, while I agree the flip out was a little overblown, there were a fair number of folks who were upset about it, and rightly so. It was an advertised item, material listed by name, and that's not what was given.
---
Chameleon also. (armor)
---
because you are in a zone where you quest send you to locations where the enemies scale and are much harder to kill, but you likely still have lower level weapons.
---
For me, a L20 vampire machete, a death tambo, and a sniper rifle were my best friends.
---
To be honest, I've been mockingly calling it Canvasgate since it started, and never got a downvote for it.
---
I check my fermenter, which lists just liquor, and all the liquor I have taking one of each with me to Biv. And I make sure I have a piece of spoiled food on me in case I get that test. Wouldn't it be convenient to have the stash box there to do all that on the fly? Bethesda did add stash boxes to the bunker, maybe one day.
---
They changed it. It does not initiate PvP if you are not in the capture area. They don't track you down anymore because they can't. Or, more accurately, they can't PvP you so they don't bother.
---
Cheers for the heads up.
---
I'd love to see how people doing this experiment see a change on PC or XBox, and if there is a cultural shift between platforms.
---
You also act like you being level 8 and him being level 12 is a "huge" advantage and it was a "high level" picking on a low level. No, you guys were both low levels.
---
What if they let multiple players form a group (3-4 players?) they could pool their camp resources to build a larger structure (though the combined budget would be less than all the budgets of the group added together) and it would become the active camp for any or all of that group when they log in, automatically putting any member of the group on the same server so the camp would always be there when at least one of the players was on.
---
Would probably lead to more established camps with a bigger build budget (but overall less than the budget of the group individually so as not to cause issues when only one member is on, otherwise you could have a large number of huge camps all at once).
---
Could lead to much more interesting game play.
---
Totally welcome.
---
If they don't add in safe areas, at the very least they need to add new spawn spots when you fast travel to a location. Some train stations only have one place where you load in, so many players just sit scoped in on the same spot of dirt waiting for you.
---
Would be neat if they had safe areas, like  whitesprings or something. Would allow more diverse player interaction on survival instead of constant fighting. (Although I love the fighting)
---
Not sure if I have remaining budget even for that! lol
---
I was in Survival so i can't be too mad but someone killed me because I wouldn't trade them my shotgun..real mature pal.
---
I wish, I think all it does is make it so if you fast travel they can‚Äôt see your player icon on the map. You can still interact with the person though.
---
I'm with you... or a small Mutant camp (which could be friends with Graham) out on the edge of the map..
---
It isn't canvasgate, it is "the duffle kerfluffle". Get it right!
---
There‚Äôs a red rocket nearby, but it‚Äôs about as far as the train station.
---
Same on Xbox, I want to cosplay as Cricket from FO4 but I'm not brave enough to not wear armor.
---
Yes, and use this to plan your build.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Not getting what you paid for isn't knee jerk. That's really what it boils down to. The fact that it happened during the launch shit show just added. 90% of the hate this game got on launch was dumb but that was one of the few things I think was legit.
---
You'll need different perk sets at different levels, and some are limited use that you wont need equipped all the time..
---
I didn't come in with a build in mind (or even the knowledge of a creating a build...
---
I chose perks based on what I needed at the time and what weapons were working well for me at the time.
---
Ended up being a melee....which was alien to me, in that in all previous FOs, I always used guns for everything.
---
True I had a feeling I'd forget a few of them people do enjoy wearing one piece of chameleon armor with whatever set they choose this is very common.
---

The only downside to starting a new character is that you will be starting completely over, but if that‚Äôs what you want, then it does seem worth it.
---
the game was rigged from the start
---
Not at all, the hardest is between 5-15. I‚Äôve been leveling up my alt in the past couple of days, average 10 levels per day for a few hours of play going from 15 to 35. Essentially less than a full run at WS will level you up. 
---
Find a good weapon such as the handmade, you can handle level 60 ghouls when you‚Äôre at 20. Keep using terrain and objects as your cover. Enemy AI are pretty good but still not human. I‚Äôm using a level 15 handmade (a useless medic prefix). If you can find a bloodied or other good prefix, you shouldn‚Äôt have problem leveling very fast. 
---
The glowing ones are tougher,  takes lots of ammo to kill one, you can trick them to follow you to the sentry bots and let them lend a hand. Just don‚Äôt shoot the bots or they will go after you.
---
That was part of the reason I got the PAE edition was for the canvas bag, planned on using it for my gym clothes as it looked cool and low key enough to not look like some weirdo. the "nylon" bag was shit quality, mine was already fraying badly around the zipper when I got it. Now it already has the zipper completely torn away from the nylon "fabric" it was made of.
---
Any data you can provide? Most ppl I asked think it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory
---
On a rooftop of a camp, at Seneca Rocks
---
I take the workshop and survive the first wave. Then I leave. If it is still up and the second wave shows on the map, I will go back, survive that, then leave again.
---
If someone enters the area, I send them the group emote. Usually they group up. Most just want the experience and rewards. If they won't group, I leave.  
---
And most importantly, I never have junk on me while in a workshop zone.
---
I hear ya. I wish with all the new stuff they keep adding they'd add a little more camp budget. It's getting tight

I think being able to buy directly like you suggest takes any "work" out of the game. Seems like people only want God tier legendaries without any of the tedium that goes along with the game. And to an extent, that has been eliminated with the vending shops themselves along with player trading which has been available the entire time. Also, half the fun of player vending is checking out other people camps.
---
I think the likely reason why I'm against it is I'm a laid back player. I dont care if I accomplish anything when I log on. I just roll with the flow so to speak. I do have over 350 hours in the game and have played since launch and I like the excitement of not knowing what someone has until I stop by.
---
The helmet really isn't that impressive, you can easily 3d print one of the same quality with a ender3 3d printer.
---
I've got bunches.... 3 platforms with at least 3 characters on each. It's fun to try different routes and actions. I finally got one to level 40 without doing some of the main quests - harder than one would think.
---
People got what they paid for, a badass power armor helmet. Everything else in that box was set dressing
---
Can't  you go back to fort defiance and learn the plans? They should be in paladin taggerty's terminal.
---
Learn the plans free to craft it at Fort Defiance. It's in the last room you can get access to.
---
Power fist didn't work for my friend. Legendary one handed sword did. Might be that power fist / deathclaw gauntlet are not considered melee weapons...at least not perk wise, thus not counting.
---
Oh yaaaa
---
You know what my experience with the floating CAMPs are?  I spawn in flawlessly, even if it's on a weird side of the camp.  If a CAMP has a large foundation and lots of walls, I'm that much more likely to spawn into a workbench or a foundation.  It's especially bad when the foundations are deep, like on the side of a hill.
---
Thanks! I'll bookmark this for later use. Really could have done with something like this in the BETA
---
I believe there is a terminal on the top floor of fort defiance.
---
I was mad due to the fact the bag was part of the reason I bought the PAE because I had planned on using it for my gym bag. Unfortunately the bag they sent was extremely low quality and had fraying around the zipper before I had even opened the plastic it was in. Now the zipper has basically came loose from the nylon due to the amount of fraying.
---
I got the joke, and found it hilarious. Some poeple are just butthurt. Now im being downvoted hahah!
---
Id rather see bookcases and tables ect... with junk already; even if they do it OCD style it will still be very limited especally when it comes to shelves were it only lets you place stuff on one level
---
Is it really that common to own a 3D printer? Weird world where someone needs a canvas bag but already has a 3D printer...?
---
Yeah, there are a few quests I'm dreading. Mainly gathering paperwork because that crashed several times during the BETA
---
I didnt know that
---
The ender3 is sub 300$, if I can blow 200$ on a special edition game, I've got enough money to also buy a cool toy like a 3d printer.
---
Nano-machines, son.

Somewhat, except, I have more trouble (problems relating to people and misunderstandings) in emails/forums than when talking to people in person.

Do people with Asperger's typically score in the top 1% - 2% on those national achievement tests?

The first time school [subject matter in class] was hard for me other than because it was boring, was calculus (I was always to slow on the tests, and often solved problems using "my own"  methods that hadn't been taught yet (so they took off points for "forbidden knowledge").
---
For a couple years in college I was actually on the Dean's List.  In Chemistry I asked questions that caused the teacher to actually change they way they taught some parts of it.  In my graduate level CS courses profs would ask me to teach *them* how I had done what I did - I seemed to do best solving the supposedly "hardest" programming tasks in ways that made it seem too easy.  In one course where all the lab work was partnered I showed up about 5 minutes early for the final lab of the course, and when my partner walked in I had the lab *done*.
---
So I did have social awkwardness before college, and I do speak differently than "normal" people - I like to speak *literally* - I don't like to imply things and I tend to say exactly what I mean.  I overshare, and "beat a dead horse" when people want me to just "drop it" I ***hate*** to leave it unresolved.  People say my arguments "go in circles" - I say, why yes, they do, because their argument was inferior and lead it that way, what they were trying to argue is unable to break out of the circular argument that I have contained it within - so what if my argument goes "in a circle" if every piece of the argument is solid and valid on it's own regardless?

---
Don't know the specifics on AP refresh effect.
---
 Hey thanks for your response and viewpoint. Seems a lot of folks have the same kind of thoughts. I think the idea of seeing people's vender inventory is solid, but being able to remote purchase is too much.
---
Yeah...it's part of the reward when you finish the BOS questline. Hope it helps.
---
One of the things I enjoy most is seeing other camps. The effort and thoughtfulness put into some are astounding.
---
its just garbage weapons i pick up and armors. i do have some stuff, but i already have the prices set low(under 100) and still have no bites. maybe its just the modifiers or the ammo
---
These are great! Keep up the good work
---
Also, hold off on doing any main quests until AFTER level 50, so that armor/weapon rewards you get will be max level.
---
Haha, during the early days of the game being released the only viable option was to go with power armour. Now I see loads of people without power armour doing way more damage than me
---
Most quests have been fixed (with the occasional bug here and there). So i‚Äôm sure it will be easier than your experience in beta.
---
Then said person could also buy a cricut printer make the westek logo and iron it on a canvas bag, no?
---
I'm tempted just to lock my doors sometimes for all the douchebags that leave my front door, back deck, and second floor deck doors wide open.
---
Pretty much everything is faster than a junk extractor.  
---
Steel- you can get hundreds an hour with weapon runs and scrapper.  Anywhere the mobs carry weapons will do. Supermutants are best but scorched and molemen work very well too.
---
Do your run, equip scrapper, scrap all the weapons. Rinse and repeat. Way faster than any extractor will generate steel. Grab every junk item you see along the way and you will max out on the rest too. I do this regularly and then sell bulk junk to the vendors to max out the 1400 caps.  
---
Except screws. Elusive bastards. Nobody ever has screws.
---
The Leader of the Pack event that starts up north-west at the fairgrounds always has 3 legendary pack leaders (low level wolves).
---
I once had a nice little interaction with a level 3.  I dropped some materials I didn't need, waved, and moved on.  Then he started following me.  Later we were in a room together and he shot me.  Oh well, I figured, guess he's an idiot.  I killed him in one hit.
---
Then I saw that he'd put something on the ground, some screws or ammo or something.  He wasn't shooting at me; he was shooting at the ground to draw my attention and he missed.
---
That was like five months ago.  I haven't even played Fallout 76 since February.
---
These things stay with you forever.
---
Oh snap! Wonder how many won‚Äôt get this reference
---
Craft/collect grenades for your alt. They will deal the same damage no matter what level you are. The prison in Toxic Valley/The Forest and WesTek have ton of mobs to grind.
---
No clue what a cricut printer is. I'm not about to blow another 200$ on some one off thing just because bethesda lied about what was in the special edition game.
---
The difference is, the 3d printer can be used for many other useful things. A screen printer or w/e would only be useful for printing things onto fabrics.
---
Sorry but someone could tell what is "BIV"?
---
lol you got downvoted too?
---
Ah. So how do you level up without doing the main quests? I found it very slow levelling up doing the main quests and I had high intelligence for most of the game
---
Been that way for over 15 years with their games.
---
Are all of these derived effects applicable to temporary gains from armor? I had heard that Endurance on armor does not increase HP? Are there other similar scenarios?
---
Hmm. I wonder if I can reproduce Negan in game.... barbed wire baseball bat a real mod in 76? It was in 4, but I have never looked at bats in here.
---
Thank god for that. The crashes meant I lost hours of cumulative progress and really stressed me out lol
---
This has worked for me. Other players spawn right where my camp was initially placed. I on the other hand, still spawn in various locations usually just outside my camp boundaries. Fast travel mats would be the best solution. Especially if you can have a personal and a separate visitor mat.
---
LOL @ "squeaker"
---
You see this? This is the kind of thing that just tickles my balls!
---
He has the best quotes. I'm making a Negan build TONIGHT. Thanks for the motivation OP.
---
Incorrect, the advertising clearly stated a "canvas" bag, which is one of the reasons I purchased the PAE, if I would have known that it wouldn't be included I wouldn't have purchased that edition, I would have just 3d printed the helmet myself and bought the base edition.
---
Yes I believe you have to deal the final blow so to speak. I know for sure it‚Äôs like that for the world challenges at least. I‚Äôve done scorched earth 57 times and some how I still haven‚Äôt killed the SBQ!!!
---
No idea. I'm not a number cruncher.
---
That's where my CAMP is. Always have tons of gears, meat and a junk extractor. Invisible deathclaw is scary when first logging in.
---
Makes us a lot of money, but that‚Äôs just my family. I‚Äôll admit a 3D printer can do lots of cool stuff too. I agree they screwed the pooch on the bag never said I didn‚Äôt. Just think people weren‚Äôt pleased with the game and this on top was fuel on the fire. If the game had been 10/10 in all reviews this would have been overlooked considerably more.
---
Thanks üëçüèº
---
Alpha didn‚Äôt count for me. I just walked around the mire (the bridge by the treetops) and it usually has one.
---
Agree with almost everything you said, except server stability. It is no where near any other online game. I get DC'ed once to twice a session, this doesn't happen with any of the other online games I play. I have the chat mod and constantly see people talking about how they are DCing. The game crashes once or twice a week. I talk to a handful of other 76 players and they are all having these issues too.
---
If we are a minority that's fine, but if the community wants to keep ignoring these issues and leaving us behind patch after patch, when some of the patches don't actually solve the issues for everyone, the player base is going to get even smaller then it is. We need all of us and more to keep the game going.
---
Part of the moon shining questline. At the end, you‚Äôll get a new daily activity. 
---
It‚Äôs really easy to just churn through the quests, and it‚Äôs actually a fun set of tasks.
---
Yea it does
---
Fair enough... :)
---
Unfortunately, that is the grindy part. You could partner up with someone more powerful and get your tags on enemies while your teammate kills them after. This will give both of you XP.
---
Gauley Mine is an early place you can find a lot of Scorched at that could help with leveling. Also, cook anything you can find and craft what you can to get XP. Every little bit helps.
---
Yeah no one was like "oh, a canvas bag, take my money"
---
Your reward......
---
A 1* stalkers rolling pin.
---
I‚Äôve been to glasses cavern many times but never saw endless scorched. However every time you pick up an ultracite ore, a bunch of scorched will spawn nearby, same thing happens outside. So I just pick one ore and wait, kill the scorched, then pick up another one and repeat.
---
Oh alright, thanks for the reply :)
---
You won't get any useful perk cards until much higher level. After 50 is when you are start getting the cards you actually want.
---
I understand. You‚Äôre a big proponent of 3D printing and canvas bags.
---
"Take a picture of a naked teammate in a nuked rad storm, while drunk."
---
You‚Äôll rarely lose all your progress on quest so no stress! Most bugs that you encounter with quests now is no marker on the map, marker in the wrong place, and it telling you to do something you already did which you can just ignore and do the next thing. But i‚Äôm not gonna lie, the game still is buggy and kinda broken so I‚Äôm sure you will encounter some shitty bug at some point
---
I'm cool with just a 3-square bedroom with a control terminal.  One way in or out; A code-lock powered door with a 1-square mantrap behind a level 3 locked cell door.  I also have a switch in the mantrap that can power off my vending machines.  It's a small setup, but only 4 of my ~12 squares are off-limits to the public and I've never gotten any complaints.  I've had people jam with me in the music corner, shop quietly, and a few have even seemingly just sat around while I was trying to log out, usually from across the map.  xD
---
I made a new one yesterday and already I‚Äôve been seeing the changes they have done. The airport being one of the best things they have done that I‚Äôve noticed. I highly recommend just to see it for yourself.
---
Correct, it was the combination of all the things included. If it wouldn't have had all the things I wouldn't have purchased it. Because as I said, I could just as easily 3d print the helmet myself and then buy the base game and save 120$ - 10$ of filament.
---
Check watoga and mire
---
This game isn't an mmo...
---
I don't have everything set up for that as of yet, but i'd be happy to send a version in a better resolution if you want.
---
You've beaten the game, move on to something else. There are loads of other games out there.
---
Once you're above 50 you can move points and respec at any time. I'm lvl 180 and have like 35 points saved up to play with. I can respec and go from melee to ranged at any time.
---
Do the side quests too.
---
Then grind for the best gear you want.
---
Then decorate your camp, build it better.
---
Then wait for the next bigger update :P
---
Do you not understand rng?  It's random.  Random means random. There's some guy getting 100 god rolls in a row and another getting 100 wood shit.
---
Random
---
I call BS. You couldn't print that helmet anywhere near the same price point for the same money with the same features.
---
I can see where you're coming from and wanting to cut down on time spent jumping around the map. 
---
The biggest draw of a game like Fallout is the exploration, the lore, the stories of the residents, the grind and luck of the draw for those legendary items. That's why a lot of people play, and your idea ( it's not bad at all), just doesn't fit into this style of play.
---
LOL ... at least you have the decency to feel bad! That does count for something.
---
This is amazing, Can't wait til your next post
---
Blueprints: Alternatively, make them- you know- fucking work. At all.
---
Thanks! I'll try that as soon as we get WiFi back. I do remember the airport being seriously buggy and laggy
---
I don't really care that much about the quality of the game, as I've just used mods to fix the issues and will play on private servers that are coming out next month. So the quality of the game doesn't matter much to me as I can fix that. 
---
I will not sit there and idly let a multimillion dollar company lie to me and falsely advertise what is included in something I buy.

I have found that it pays off to *very*  gradually increase your exploration radius outside of the forest. Too far, too fast... and it's just too hard.

I find I judge the area by "is ammo a constant concern, while

I also manage to win most fights?" is a perfect level of area to be in. Dying too much? Too far. One shot kills all the time? Too easy.

I can imagine an uppercut to a Ghouls face with that..
---
Why wouldn't I be? I make a shit ton of money making jewelry with the 3d printer. Lost wax casting can make you a shit ton of money just buy some gold bars print out the jewelry you want to cast and then cast the jewelry and mark it up 100%. People eat it up.

Gonna get worse with squeekers out of school.

All in all, beside i can understand the frustration and disappointment of some, but after some time now it just deserve it's place as a joke/meme.

People keep saying that workshops are pvp hotspots, but I too have never had an issue with workshops, or anywhere for that matter, with pvp until recently. I‚Äôm talking running into assholes every single day the past week, when I‚Äôd never had an issue with anyone prior. Serious trolls that talk shit, too. I keep feeling like there has to be something I‚Äôm missing.

Hopefully! I rarely find bugs on my current character apart from one where you try to go to a certain area that I can't remember the name of and it would repeatedly crash at the same point every time whilst loading into the area. I had to reload the game every time it crashed
---
Mr. Falcon!

Almost the same for me, except i watched his Cyberpunk videos last year.

Wow thanks this helps a lot

You only have until Tuesday, get busy

3 star upgrades for my Instigating Weapons and then 3 star versions of my Chameleon and Bolstering Armors.
---
Bloodied Power Fist!
---
ROFL, you really haven't kept up with 3d printing if you believe that. I do lost wax casting with 3d printers. The quality I can get from my ender3 is extremely good for not being a resin 3d printer. 
---
Not to mention 3d printers are main stream now, you can pick the ender 3 up at walmart for under 200$. LOL
---
STR gives you 5 carry weight and a whole point in your overall stats.
---
Tough.  I lock the door to my upstairs bedroom.  It's my 'nice' space with the four poster bed and a lot of art and the statues and nice furniture.  But that's it.  Downstairs is every available workbench in game, a rad shower, unlocked water purifiers, crops outside, a scout bed in front of the vending machines.  There's nothing they need to get to upstairs.
---
If people are mad they can't get into my private space? Fuck them.
---
This 100%. Many studies concluded that in an apocalyptic situation the first to vanish are those who prep little but believe their guns can land them food and supplies. Instead of ‚Äòraiders‚Äô, might as well call them ‚Äòretards‚Äô.
---
Sadly I have no friends that play 76 and the one that does plays really rarely. As a result I played an entire character up to level 60 as a solo player. Which made some parts very difficult. *Cough cough wendigo cave at level 20 cough*
---
More like doin the kiddies at the daily corner cabins
---
I think the quest rewards are mostly junk  (the exception maybe being the all rise you get from mayor for a day), by the time you hit 50 you should have found better stuff anyway. Run what quests you want to, kill everything you can, do events, get lots of sleep.
---
And people say it's not a great looking game! Fools.
---
Explosive vehicles around your camp would be cool
---
Fair point, I forgot about the grey bar. I still find it hard to believe but perhaps I will give it a try. What was the listed damage at in the pipboy?
---
What platform are you on?
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just turn them in yourself for scrip and either get better stuff for yourself or better items to sell then?
---
Nom nom.
---
A Bloodied Swing Speed Power Fist.
---
Or heck, any decent Unarmed melee with swing speed.
---
Level 80 Moleminer Kings at uranium fever
---
Make a second character with a different build?
---
What's TSE?
---
BE Railway
---
Yeah no. Those numbers might be your luck but rng is rng and you people should stop putting math to it.  Your personal experience doesn't reflect mine or the next person.
---
Because the extremely low max scrip you can have, and the limit on how many things you can buy off her per day. Lots of us are completely maxed out on scrip and can't buy anymore things off her each day due to the limit. So why wouldn't I sell them off to others as scrip? You can't sell scrip, but you can sell useless legendarys to get around that.
---
Demo doesn't work with it?
---
two shots explosive.
---
A TSE Gatling Gun or combat rifle would be great, but I‚Äôve never been too fixated on getting legendaries. I‚Äôm able to do pretty much anything I want to do and have fun solo at level 62 anyways, so a good Legendary is pretty inconsequential to my play.
---
I'm Xbox 1
---
Ok man. I yield. Good luck fighting the good fight. I hope you get your bag. Have a great day!
---
I second this motion.
---
Seems like I will be very soon.
---
You probably could've handled him. Deathclaws are huge pussies in this game compared to previous titles.
---
Can someone please explain how this is even possible? I thought levels 5&gt; couldn‚Äôt Play survival. If that‚Äôs true OP had to be in Adventure. Even without Pacifist mode on you can harm a player that low of a level. Even if you‚Äôre above level 5 you‚Äôd have to strike back to be vulnerable. It sounds like a funny story and all but there‚Äôs so many other things, just forgive me, I‚Äôm not sure I believe you. Shame on you for down voting that other guy 76 times (kind of ironic) for saying the same thing. It sounds like you thought of this in your head and decided to write a post about it.
---
did he drop anything?
---
BE Gauss
---
Have an IE &amp; absolutely love it, but I feel with higher HP enemies Instigating is a bit useless after first shot.
---
Than and eventually getting 3* versions of my unyielding set. Also building up a bolstering set.
---
Apply to perk points as you get them, even if you don't really need the cards that are available now.  Banking the level ups for later is a false economy. 
---
I was around level 60 before Class Freak, a level 43 card i think, became available to me.  If i'd waited untill then I would have left money on the table that I could have been using.
---
As others say, go to nukesanddragons and fill out the chart.  Save the link and reference it when you need to pick a level up point.  **You may not have a perk card you want but at least the point goes into a category you need**.  Or use level ups later to respec...it isn't the end of the world, and really most players have to respec sooner or later.
---
I'm a commando/big guns build character, and I'm really hoping to find a decent handmade soon. I found one at a vendor last night, a quad explosive handmade, but it cost 22k and I only had 14k. The hunt continues!
---
Yeah, lost wax casting is more than $10 in filament.
---
I own two printers myself, and am very much involved in the scene and I call bullshit on your pricing valuation. Not to mention the valuation of all the extra prep work you are putting in to get anywhere near the quality of the helmet on a filament printer.
---
Also where are you figuring in the electronics work here? Gonna etch your own circuits as well? Maybe head to the mine to dig up the ore you are gonna need for the components as well?
---
The savings never end!
---
The Pioneer Scout challenges are at least 50 hours of game play, so try them. Do the post-release quests for brewing/taxidermy/pioneer scout. There's trophy/achievement for reaching level 100, which is a good level-milestone to reach regardless of platform.
---
Furious or Junkie's ultracite gatling laser, with damage while aiming and reduced weight
---
An Instigating Boxing Glove is pretty effective.
---
Level 180! How long have you been playing that save for? I'm really forgetful so I always forget to put a perk card back if I've removed it to spec in something different for a while
---
Does power fist count as unarmed?

On Xbox, not sure if it says eat people. It was already in the house when I set up there.

I can't give those 3* knives away!! Had 2 in 3 weeks... (low weight stuff always get scripped last) had them down to 399 caps and nobody was interested!!!

Hoping for a bloodied LAR with 2 Vats critical buffs ap cost reduction. increased vats critical damage. Faster critical meter.

Want a SBQ killer....

Not the usual stuff, but looking for a slicker Tesla Rifle to replace my one star Two Shot Tesla. Next to that still looking for a bowie knife with some sick stats.

I play the game at 8-8:30pm every few days and the servers are always full and I‚Äôm on Xbox.

Boogy did too :\ Not sure why all of a sudden

Sigh...looks like the F76 Hate train is back.
---
Sure does! I currently am using the Unstoppable Monster(this weeks survival weapon) and it does 953 damage with my character build. I just like power fists more!

More like ‚ÄúTake a picture of 3 friends, all wearing Faschnat Sunshine masks and Hunter‚Äôs long coats in a rad storm with 3 nukes in the background‚Äù

Literally the second sentence in the post.
---
&gt;If you want a second terrible affix, I'd look at Stalkers. It's a VATS affix that isn't good for VATS. Now that's a weak affix.
---
Especially since it can be added to melee weapons and black powder guns.  What‚Äôs the point?
---
Not sure if marsupial is enough.
---
Another trick is to place your camp, and fast travel to it. Keep moving it around and fast travel, sooner or later you'll end up somewhere unintended.
---
That's how I got up to the Hornwright HQ:

I doubt it.  Maybe Raven Rock, with ZAX/Eden helping out, but the Enclave remnants that come from Navarro arent making the trip for another hundred years at least.   Adams is just an empty ruin until then.

Bloodied or anti armor hunting rifle with +50% vats crits and 25% less vats cost... the dreammm
---
there is no disc. just a code
---
I have a total of 3, the other 2 are cap and stuff mules, this is my main squeeze, been wrecking shit with him since beta.

In the beginning I was guns, I slowly found my way to melee, then bloodied PA, now I'm bloodied non PA with alot of weight reduction perks.

Should show as online now.  I changed my profile settings to online.

Try like a Walmart or target

This is awesome! What program do you use?

If you do *all* the completable tadpole and opossum badges. . . I guess it could take someone 50 hours.
---
Backpack took me and friends a whole 3 hours to obtain- day it was released, without guides or locations.
---
Yep, you have to land the killing blow. Maybe farm the Free Range event and get on mic and let others know you need to get the final shot for the challenge. You might get lucky and be the only one that shows up. Less people are doing it these days.
---
My compulsive habit in this game to is to blast every vehicle I pass down to a hair over 50% damage. No idea why, but I love hearing them blow up as I run away... crowded parking lots are the best.
---
E.U. around 15 euro monies.
---
U.S. around 30 freedom monies.
---
EBay can varry if your patient. Make sure you get your region and dont by a hard copy on pc. You just get code anyways and most likely someone has already used the code on hard copy.
---
Ok thanks anyways, really appreciate it
---
To be fair, this is probably what would have happened in real life
---
It's such a ballache to level up. I already have two lv 130 alts but wanted to avoid needing to transfer it over.
---
Yeah! Like the Mayor of Grafton, or Biv E. Ridge, or the Motherlode, or vendors with individual personalities, or MODUS, or Graham: itt would be awesome if we could have a few like them in the game
---
Those signs are actually for coolant for the nuclear vehicles.  I think gas was actually way higher, if you could actually even find a place with any.
---
Hi a commando/big guns build character, and , I'm dad.
---
Just a heads up that explosive energy weapons don't drop anymore. You will have to buy one off a player that has one from before they fixed it. Expect to either be trade only or beyond max caps.
---
I have a new character I am wanting to lvl up as well and wouldn't mind having a buddy to team with. She is lvl 2 so if you make a new one we can go get our butts kicked together..lol
---
I started a new character when the respec was released, my beta character was a 67 at the time and super derpy so it was better to just burn it down. I set up camp near Morgan town and did the collision course event about a zillion times and constantly cleared the ghouls in the town itself to level. I also Did the quests that I could according to my characters ability. I highly recommend finding a build guide that fits your play style before starting again so you don't waste perks points. The first 50 are important, you want to avoid wasting them on stuff that won't help your build.
---
Thanks! I made some sketches with pencil, scanned them and then i used Adobe Illustrator.
---
QE Crossbow or QE harpoon. I don‚Äôt care about killing things anymore in the game I just want to be somewhat goofy and kill things wildly. I‚Äôm on Xbox if anyone has one and is willing to trade!!
---
ROFL, The light? That was done with a 2$ flashlight from the dollar store. Not to mention 10$ would actually be on the high end if I was using high end filiment like matterhackers, but since I'd have just painted it to give the weathered look as it is in the game I'd have used whatever filimants I had left over.
---
You seem to be way overesitmated the cost of filament. Also, no I'd not use lost wax casting to make the helmet. I have the ender 3 for lost wax casting of jewelry. The money you can make custom making gold jewelry is insane. So that is why I have multiple 3d printers. 
---
I don't even use the ender 3 for lost wax casting anymore I have a legit resin 3d printer for that. Only it can't do large enough pieces for the t-51b 3d printed helmet files.
---
I was teasing in my comment, explosive cars around your camp would be a terrible idea lol
---
Is Bolstering better than Unyielding? I‚Äôve always been heavy weapons in PA but now since I‚Äôm building my second character I‚Äôm thinking a completely different set up (rifle without PA).
---
Reading is hard.
---
Do you get two arcs out of it with the two shot? Do they go to separate enemies?
---
Xbox
---
Maybe lvl 91 was just intimidating and I have no build
---
Wow! I'm assuming that means you use the other two to carry things for your main?
---
There are a few places in the cranberry bog where sheepsquatches tend to spawn. The creekside sundew grove is one, sometimes also at the thunder mountain substation TM-02. Other than that, your best bet is just the free range event
---
You could suggest the greatest fit that ever was- still costs money to licence.  There's plainly no incentive for Bethesda to spend a dime in this category.
---
Suppressor's shovel with -15ÔºÖ damage when blocking/reflect 50ÔºÖ damage while blocking. Is the endgame weapon of my dreams &gt;__&lt;„Äë
---
You've completed the main quest before finishing all of the side quests? Blasphemous.
---
So your the guy in the opening cinematic of Fallout 2
---
Oh I‚Äôm just saying regular Gatling gun, not energy. My guy‚Äôs built for single shot rifles and and a little heavy weapons, because I just really love the Gatling gun
---
Nice guide. I only get as far as clearing out before someone comes down the lift and kicks off the event... really difficult to find a quiet time to solo this one...
---
Fallout 76 is not the same type of game as Fallout 3, New Vegas or Fallout 4
---
You're comparing apples to oranges. 
---
There is plenty of story, just look around and find it.
---
Why would you water mark them?
---
Nice try Todd, we know you are sneaking concept art out from the office!
---
I found this bot before.. Why do ppl want to find him? Also he had a Brahmin like gram haha.
---
good stuff my dude...thanks
---
This isn't exactly true. Save up your script and try it. You will definitely see trents when buying multiple weapons at once. I got 6 weapons in a row with reduced bash damage, and then the next day got 3 instigating in a row, and very unfortunately ran out of script after that. It's a RNG but there is some evidence that it will stay on one attribute for a little while.
---
I didn't know I wanted damage numbers until now, can't wait.
---
yes you can
---
I HATE dialog trees. Ever since the first final fantasy having to go to every npc to check for some hidden progress. Oh, you didnt expand that one tree? Good luck going through 300 Npc trees to find it. Backtracking through every dialog choice. And the whole, I thought it was this way but I was wrong and someone is now mad.  They slow down the games so much. I dont want to stand in one place while the npc takes some vogue glamor poses. I love picking up a holotape and moving on while it plays. If they and npc's it should be similar. Joins as a companion, and spits the quest dialog at you on the way. 
---
No dialog trees please!
---
Oh its a shame. Guess who does have a printer big enough, the company that made the damn helmet.
---
And anyone with google can check prices on the daily for filament. Your not making this thing for $10 bucks dude. Once you figure in all costs the PA edition starts to look pretty damn attractive in comparison.
---
where are the angle pieces of flooring from---?I can only make square rooms so far
---
Lol sounds like a great idea! Do you want me to DM you or something?
---
Every note, every tape I find is a treasure to me.  It tells a story of what happened without some blank faced NPC spouting it to me.  At this point, I think the people who play 76 either love it for those discoveries, or love it for the grind.
---
It's not FO5.  It's not trying to be, and that's ok.
---
They need to swap one of the brewing stations for a chem bench. Let me scrap all that delicious junk I pick up throughout the building and be able to boil my water to make alcohol.

Upvote for weird downvotes
---
Unyielding with bloodied is good for melee because it's boosts you're strength then boosting your dmg. Unyielding with range will give a boosts to perception and agility. But when you're using mutations associated with those (like bird bones and eagle eyes), your perception and agility is already very high.
---
Because a range build tends to loose out on endurance (and strength) and the perks associated with dmg resistance from those categories, it's better to then have boost of dmg resistance from bolstering.
---
idk, it was my brother's suggestion, he said something about people using them and not giving credit.
---
You forgot your, "Well actually..."
---
Really thunder mountain substation 2 has it spawn? Cause that location usually just has deathclaw and ton of radants spawn for me like 100% either that or one or both are dead.
---
I'd say majority of time I don't have trouble with workshops. I have had someone drop artillery strikes on me and kill me and steal like 2 hours worth of work. Maybe another experience or two but that ws because of a girl I use to play with who caused me a lot of trouble.  
---
I would say the stuff you mentioned early on is your fault. Everyone pretty much assumes if someone has pacifist mode off and they're taking damage from someone it's intentional. With events especially you should just put pacifist mode on. If someone melees me I always ignore them and move on with my day. 
---
I‚Äôm surprised actually by your limited bad experiences. People feel empowered in this game when they‚Äôre already assholes to begin with. Some people are just fucking cunts man.
---
Lovely. Still no word on display cases.Figures.
---
Get off my roof damn kids!!!
---
There's some great QoL changes in here, thanks devs!
---
I hope we can change our crosshair someday though, I work better with a smaller... closed crosshair? If that makes sense.
---
Ah. Someone earlier posted a guide so I'll check that out
---
My camp on Seneca rocks gets them almost daily
---
Fools indeed
---
At this point anything good that hasn't been duplicated. To me on PC finding an AAE Handmade with 15% VATS refill would suck. It really takes the excitement out of finding something that everyone seems to already have.
---
3 things, either licensing for Johnny Cash songs are through the roof, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt know many Johnny Cash songs or Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt like Johnny Cash. No matter what most of his music could easily fit into the fallout series better than The Beach Boys I my opinion
---
As I tell anyone playing for their first time- by 30-40 you should decide on a damage type and enhance it. You can always change your build if something desirable drops but in the meantime, enhance what you have or you'll have a bad time.
---
Must be rare then because it seems like 99% of people are asking 4-5x as much for those legendary items in game... even after world hopping several times I might see a deal every now and then but it‚Äôs rare!
---
I also have a printer big enough, the ender3 is more than large enough. My RESIN 3d printer isn't because it is more about super fine detail. The ender 3 is large enough to do the whole helmet no problem.
---
The PA helmet weights less than 2 lbs's a 2 kilo roll of filament is 20$ at walmart, 2lbs is less than a kilo, so it would be roughly 10$ worth of filament.  You are really over estimating the costs of 3d printing or you have a lot of failed prints.
---
Yes! I love it. Thanks dad very cool
---
My bud has one and it wrecks everything.
---
I'd love to see that, the mole miners are pretty cute even when they're trying to kill you.
---
Greaser jacket and jeans. Just need to get the face right. Might find a preset for FO4 that you could use as a reference
---
a lot still remains after the nuked zone has ran its course.
---
still loads of nuked fauna etc.
---
I generally wait until the area has calmed down and most players have left the field.
---
still plenty left, inc legendarys, h/mass,g/mass fluids... and enough enemy's.
---
still insane in cranberry bog, but far more manageable.
---
having said that, 3s/b's , 1 98 deathclaw, 1 mr gutsy and bitch assaultron,6m/kings,4 gulpers, shit ton of scorched and 5 68 supermutants. All at the same time and on your tod........... didnt survive.

---
"Why the face?" - Phil Dunphy
---
This argument doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. Every MMO has non-corpse/recording NPCs and they work fine. Some of them roam, some of them are stationary quest-givers, some of them can actually join with the player and fight.  Would MMO NPCs ever be as dynamic as the ones we all loved (or wanted to shoot, in Preston Garvey‚Äôs case) in other Fallout games? Of course not. Are they totally viable? Absolutely. FO76 isn‚Äôt remotely ear the ‚Äúlimits‚Äù of what you can add with NPCs.
---
I actually feel like the no (or at least rare) NPC idea would have worked better in a solo game. You would really be able to get into the feel of the isolation and desolation of the scenery and feel like you were exploring the aftermath of horrific events. The ‚Äúwe are the characters in the wasteland‚Äù concept is totally ruined when you‚Äôre exploring a burned-out ruin and ‚ÄúxNameThatA13YearOldThoughtWasClever69x‚Äù comes stomping through in power armor and a clown hat, circle strafes you for 30 seconds, gives you a thumbs down, and hops away.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with some signs of human life gradually coming in too. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre supposed to be doing, right? Building safe camps, pushing back the bad guys, and helping to bring life back. I don‚Äôt want to see it go as far as most games, but a few NPCs here and there would be nice, and could work fine.
---
There's a server-specific cooldown, so you may need to wait or server-hop, and you'll need to purchase an assaultron recall card from one of the robot vendors to replace the free one that you used, but you're not completely out of luck. You can do it again.
---
Shooting a deathclaw full of 100 holes destroys its value I guess.
---
My main is a combat shotgunner, and at level 107 I‚Äôve only ever found two legendaries for her, both just 1* (anti-armor and instigating) and both from vendors, not actual drops for me. I‚Äôd be happy with a 3* combat shotgun that isn‚Äôt like Junkie‚Äôs etc. Just something I can use, not picky about details.
---
Same boat. I have three versions right now. Ghouls Slayer, assassins, bloodied. I use the ghoul slayer for WS runs so I don‚Äôt one shot shit.
---
Dude got what he deserved. He's got an explosive weapon so just give the enemy some splash damage from the ground and let the other players lower level than me get the loot. I'm glad he killed the guy and stole his loot. let it be a lesson.
---
Getting accurate testing on weapons and legendary effects is about to come full circle üôèüèª
---
Here‚Äôs to see truly if Zealots hunters or both works on scorchbeast
---
So... A bunch of things no one has asked for and still no UI fixes/bug fixes/ chat. Lame
---
The numbers thing will be cool for testing but i wont want that on all the time. I guess its not all bad.
---
But that's just my personal opinion from looking at the logic behind it. Being a range sniper myself, using only mutations, my perception and agility is strong enough that I can sneak around enemies in broad daylight, and have pretty high chance at headshots as far as the weapons range ability.
---
To be fair, given the time line of inspiration for Fallout, would nylon shirts be that far off?
---
Very interesting, thanks bro üëçüèª
---
Holy shit that took a long time. I don't understand how someone can be happy with the game (which is a dumpster fire) and upset with a damn bag. People are dumbasses.
---
Ah...i don't know what they would use them for other than maybe a background on their phone or something and I would love for someone to pick one of my photos for a background. People seem to be pretty good about acknowledging the OP but that is your decision ofcourse..
---
The fight inside is guranteed to be a deathclaw vs ants/with maybe radroach. But I've seen a sheepsquatch spawn near it and then go fight the deathclaw
---
Meta seems to be bloodied/unyeilding or vangaurd/high health builds.
---
Well if he would TURN ON PACAFIST they couldn't hurt his CAMP to begin with. He played with fire and there you go.
---
Im confident I have an unpopular opinion here, but I would be 100% fine if they never added human NPC's to the game. For me, Appalachia has been the most immersive, and most believable world in the fallout series so far. Everyone is dead, and it feels like a true apacalypse. You are putting together the prices and story yourself. I love searching for the lore, it makes you actually explore the world they spent countless hours creating. I love the environmental story telling as well.
---
I always found that after the human NPC's exhaust all of their voice lines, you feel more lonely than before.
---
Everyone seems to forget about Preston Garvey, and "have you been to the cloud district lately?" Lol. If they added human to the game, I would rather have them Ina much more passive role than someone who you speak to daily. I can get over having a repetitive conversation every day with a robot because, well, it's a robot. Having a human NPC's give me the same daily every day would quickly ruin the immersion, at least for me.
---
I‚Äôll try for something like that. I‚Äôm level 13 atm.

Nothing like being up in the secure BoS area at the asylum, doing some crafting or going afk to get a snack because you figure it‚Äôs safe there, and getting swarmed by ghouls who could hear you through the walls from the other wing of the building, went all the way down and over and back up through the laser grid just to disturb your peace.
---
yes i know
---
oof this hit me in the sci fi feels....  i want to correct him so bad, but ill let it slide
---
Keep your eyes out for the death tambo or mole miners gauntlet. Some great early level unarmed weapons. You'll have to be level 30 for the power fist.
---
The same thing you do by yourself except with people
---
If you're on PS4 I'll give you both a nuke card for your troubles, lol. Sounded like a real butt kicker
---
johny guitar needs a comeback
---
Fallout was already 3-star legendary, but it reverted to 1\* last year due to a bug.
---
So happy for damage numbers. This will make the science all the more easier.
---
Also, holy cow all these combat adjustments. There is totally going to be a deathmatch oriented mode in the near future.
---
Rng doesn't mean anything on its own. It is the [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) that matters and turns a random number into one of the thousands of item configurations, which in general can factor in additional properties. That's why many of us collect data about the drops and try to predicate it onto other distinguishing factor. The counterarguments from people like you are mostly anecdotal or completely void of data countering the hipotheses.
---
Okay thanks
---
Got it. I will probably use a suppressed handmade or other fast firing rifles in semi-heavy style (don‚Äôt have the patience of a sniper lol). So sneaking would be good bonus for damage but I probably won‚Äôt totally rely on it. While playing heavy/PA I can get shot at by a whole mob and don‚Äôt have to worry too much. I‚Äôve been wondering if that‚Äôs achievable with normal armors and rifles.
---
Why is this a problem? Do you not like meaningful QOL improvements to core gameplay mechanics? These look great.
---
It IS the enterprise, and the CAMP owner showed up in this thread. He said he used a bug with blueprints and the metal stairs and metal bars, then deleted the stairs.
---
Um not sure what it is..lol it's  a new account for my mule. Add my main account same as here: LatersHater
---
I was happy.
---
Now im not
---
However, they had the description "canvas bag" that was also factored into the MSRP. If they had said Nylon bag and charged the same it would have been no big deal.
---
If you sneak in from the side of the foundation, you should be able to select it instead of the entire foundation. Have to do this all the time with the electrical connects I put on them.
---
&gt; Finally, for those times when you need to make a hasty exit, but want to pick off one more pesky creature before you go, V.A.T.S. will now close immediately if one of your attacks scores a killing blow.
---
Curious about this one, hopefully it doesn't apply to Gun Fu.
---
Downvotes are from those who don‚Äôt get it. Kids now days.
---
Yep, seen it here too... Gotta (not) love 3 VATS shots at point-blank range WITH A SHOTGUN and not register a single pellet hitting the target at 90+% accuracy. :(
---
Thank god they added inverted controls for all the psychopaths out there.
---
Ah I've never seen that before interesting, I know I seen a sheepsquatch in the mire when I was looking for a flatwood monster, but I forgot the spawn.
---
Just going to be blunt. Thanks for your research and it just reinforces that it's not very good at all. The marketplace, well some of them, misinterpreted the max damage increase as a constant weapon damage increase. Like it does the cap damage consistently. I'd take just a two-shot over this for 85% of situations. What's worse is that the damage doesn't roll over to the next enemy. I wish they would buff this like the adrenaline perk card and make it a very useful legendary.
---
I have 7 doors in my house and people love to open all of them.  What I ended up doing is locking the 3 doors to the patios and the second bedroom door.  There's a shared bathroom between my room and the second bedroom.  My room's door and the bathroom doors are unlocked.  This way you can still see every room in the house but can't open all my damn doors. The only door I have to shut is the front door the rest stay open.
---
We need automatic doors for those of us not raised in a barn.  I'm tempted to put pressure plates and a powered door as my front door, but I don't like the way they look.
---
I want an explosive deathclaw gauntlet. It would have glowing tips and it would be epic
---
He probably fell off the catwalk....
---
A couple of these look nice, but they seem more relevant to PvP. I hope they‚Äôre not gradually trying to make that the focus, or building up to yet-another last-man-standing mode.
---
..sounds like my inner dialogue when I was 15..
---
Wait..you made an ultracite PA set. You haven't done everything if you didn't get a free full set.
---
Go to the enclave and replace it yourself? They sell mods, you know. The only way to even get mods for Scout armor.
---
This is a great step in the right direction, combat mechanics needed some love.
---
whatta dick!
---
I tell my kids to turn off the games and go outside regularly. That's just good parenting.
---
Depends on what the group wants to do. When I'm solo, I sneak a lot and take a few well placed shots during combat. I gather up and scrap everything I see. When im in a group, I play more of a supporting role, dont collect as much junk ( unless thats what we are doing) and generally interact with people more (ones not in my group.)  We find all kinds of things to get into, whether it be events, exploration or just grinding. When people put their heads together, all kinds of things can happen.
---
Because this vendor is the only one that sells the hunters long coat.  It‚Äôs a random spawn for the vendor and a random spawn for the item, so it‚Äôs hard to get.
---
Nice stuff, but taken along with all the buzz around Nuclear Winter being PvP/Battle Royale, these seem to point even more towards that.
---
Either tag along with whatever the other people are doing, just lending fire support, or run a Silo together and kill the queen, or run Project Paradise, or power up some power plants, or anything else.
---
Vampire's Chainsaw with 50% Limb Damage and 90% reduced weight, called "The Bloodbath"
---
Yes yes, it was in the description, and you are right, if it said nylon there would have been zero issue. Thus why it is so absurd to me.
---
I have no walls perse maybe I should add just a locked door and see if people get mad...
---
Vault dweller: Locks camp doors
---
All of Appalachia: [https://imgur.com/f4beLdL](https://imgur.com/f4beLdL)
---
It was me, I instantly logged out and deleted the game.
---
Yes! I want in!!!
---
But unless you are building in the forest, most of the enemies have a ranged attack anyway which they don't need no stinking ramp to hit your camp.
---
uhm what? yeah that's what i did, but i didn't know the mods are broken and break the weightless effect. so i don't WANT mods, i want to be able to revert it back to NONE, read please.
---
Explosives are not godly, but I pulled out my 
---
&gt; shiny explosive 50 cal
---
Why are you unhappy? You are aware these changes will be a great improvement to the game right? And that these will work in both adventure mode and PvP modes.
---
Executioner‚Äôs/+50% limb damage gamma gun
---
I applied a mod to my 3* unyielding/faster ap/reduced falling right arm &amp; it won't let me swap it for anything.
---
I have two stacks of polymer mods in my stash that won't attach either. I'm assuming one has to be a limb mod, other chest.
---
The whole scout armor setup is...leaving a lot to be desired. Once I find a suitable combat armor replacement I'm getting rid of it (unless they fix these issues in a timely manner).
---
Actually, lots of people have asked for some of these. Must have missed them.
---
Got it, thanks. My name is really stupid but I can't afford to change it so it's stuck like that for now
---
Didn't even think about that. In that case I'm totally cool with people using them as background/wallpaper :D
---
These kind of are ui fixes though. I mean I get what you are saying but damage numbers is a huge fix.
---
Will do, cheers!
---
holy sh#@ those are some tuff level 1 scorched!
---
FLOAT DAMAGE!!!!!!!
---
I play inverted Y, but who plays inverted X??
---
It‚Äôs not, I absolutely love having this shown damage dealt option for testing of legendary effects, but a lot of people aren‚Äôt a fan of this potential battle royal mode being added and these changes almost fully confirms this, that‚Äôs all
---
It's just Blackreach ported over. SBQ instead of the glowing dragon.
---
If you can't go on the website herFALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT ‚Äì UPCOMING COMBAT IMPROVEMENTS
---
Welcome back to Inside the Vault! Patch 10 is on its way to Fallout 76 in June and we‚Äôre setting our sights on making a few improvements to your in-game combat experiences. Read on to catch a preview of the adjustments you can expect to see in our next update.
---
PATCH 10 COMBAT IMPROVEMENTS
---
Some of the adjustments below will feel more impactful in-game than they seem when reading about them, so we‚Äôve included a few ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù clips to better illustrate a few of the differences. Once Patch 10 arrives, we hope you will find these changes offer more flexibility and responsiveness during combat when you‚Äôre fending off the many dangers of the Wasteland.
---
WHAT‚ÄôS THE DAMAGE?
---
We‚Äôre adding a ‚ÄúShow Damage Numbers‚Äù setting to the display options menu that you can use to see exactly how much hurt you‚Äôre dishing out when your attacks hit an enemy. This setting can be toggled separately for Adventure and Survival modes and is turned off by default.
---
KEEP YOUR WEAPONS DRAWN
---
Has a straggling Ghoul ever caught you by surprise while you were holstering or switching a weapon? Now, you can blast it back into the shadows without hesitation! In Patch 10, you will be able to cancel many weapons‚Äô holstering and drawing animations by firing them.
---
TAKE AIM WITH CONFIDENCE
---
Sometimes, your reaction speed can mean the difference between looting an enemy and re-claiming your junk from a paper bag. We‚Äôre greatly reducing the time it takes to look down pistol iron sights and peer into weapon scopes for a better view of your targets.
---
We‚Äôre also going to add targeting reticles to a number of weapons that didn‚Äôt previously have them when aiming down the sights in first-person perspective. This should help you make more shots count and spend less time adjusting your aim. Targeting reticles are being added for the following weapons:
---
Gatling Weapons (except Gatling Laser Guns),
---
Minigun
---
Broadsider
---
50 Cal Machine Gun
---
Auto Grenade Launcher
---
Fat Man
---
Harpoon Gun
---
Paddle Ball (yes, even the Paddle Ball)
---
RUN AND GUN
---
Whether you need to make a tactical retreat, chase down a fleeing enemy, or take a more strategic position, being ready to run is critical to maneuvering on the battlefield. Going forward, you will be able to sprint immediately after firing ranged weapons, and can sprint to cancel reload animations.
---
In addition, we‚Äôre removing the temporary reduction in look sensitivity that occurred after sprinting for players who use controllers. This should help combat on controllers feel more fluid and allow you to more easily line up a new target. Finally, for those times when you need to make a hasty exit, but want to pick off one more pesky creature before you go, V.A.T.S. will now close immediately if one of your attacks scores a killing blow.
---
FINE TUNE YOUR VIEW
---
Thanks to feedback we‚Äôve received from many of you in the Fallout 76 community, we‚Äôre adding a couple of new settings to the Game Options Menu that will help you better customize how you view the world. First, we‚Äôre implementing support that will allow you to invert X-axis input. Next, whether you play with a controller or a mouse, you will now be able to adjust your horizontal and vertical look sensitivity settings independently from one another. We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this sneak peek at our next update for Fallout 76. Keep an eye on Fallout.com to catch more details about Patch 10 as soon as they are announced.
---
JOIN US FOR E3 ON SUNDAY!
---
One more quick reminder before we head to Los Angeles for E3 2019: The fifth annual Bethesda E3 Showcase kicks off at 5:30 p.m. PT this Sunday, June 9. We hope you‚Äôll join us during the show, because we‚Äôre planning to announce more details about what we have in store for Fallout 76 throughout the rest of 2019. You can tune in live on Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Mixer, or Facebook Live. In case you‚Äôre looking for even more details about this year‚Äôs showcase, we‚Äôve wrangled everything you need to know in this article on Bethesda.net. Until then, we will see you in the Wasteland
---
üëå
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a nice gun but not op
---
These changes look amazing and I can't wait to try them!
---
Lol. I got downvoters stalking me and down voting legit statements. 
---
That or these people don't want display cases.
---
Or something nonsensical.
---
More crying , waaaaaaa go to survival you griefer.  This is the wasteland nut up or shut up . Just go hide in your camp playing tradeland while giving heart emojis to everyone , pvp will not be removed from workshops . What would stop someone from claiming all the workshops on a server and just sitting on them all day , there are a limited number of servers so going to a new server is not always an option.
---
Kill! Kill them all!!!
---
You say tato, we say trade-o!
---
damn how do you get a free set
---
agreed..on PC it's just a quick tap on right mouse button to exit VATS..this might bugger up Gun Fu..
---
There was a new post here recently - and I guess it flared people back up.  Supposidly- it's still being produced - but nothing had happened in the Beth ticket system. The bags are nothing to cry over but game journalism as a whole is a garbage fire.
---
BOS quest line. At the end you get the set.
---
SO MUCH YES. ROLL ON E3 BOYS!
---
If they switched up everything besides the helmet, would you have been ok with that?  Like if the figurines turned out to be just paper dolls or the map didn't glow in the dark, would that have been acceptable?
---
Thanks everyone. Ill be sure to put all these survival tips in my W.L.S.G.
---
That hornwright base is legit cool. Mad props cap!
---
I get that but they have added new songs in DLC before, even though it wasn't as well known as Johnny Cash. Regardless at least some people can enjoy this song if they never heard it before.
---
I'm always checking player vendors for an explosive crossbow.  Still have never seen one. I did find a nice inst/33 vats the other day I scooped up.
---
Excellent. I have an executioner's bat saved just because. time to dig it out.
---
i did it but only got the plans for it
---
That is intentional, they are foundations not walls. They aren't designed to stop anything, they are just designed to be built on. They have the "ladder" effect on the side of them so that you can't just build a wall of foundations and have an impenetrable base that is immune from enemy damage.
---
Might be tied in with the Wastelanders DLC that's due to drop later in 2019 - maybe? Heard that it is a 'game changer' and have another 'main' quest in it. Just my two pennies worth :)
---
but i accidentally scrapped a PA set today and didnt know what pieces were on it....
---
Ah it's just a name. I wish they would let us use character names. Since it doesn't matter when we make a new character I am just doing single letters..lol
---
Clutter is the big thing missing from CAMPS. All the little dodads and accessories that add that extra layer to a camp. Cash registers, barrels, bottles, junk, containers, and not just furniture.
---
Shhhh!
---

---
this does a pretty good job on explaining, the mods are for leg arms are chest, but are unnamed. my issue is that the ultra light build mod completely BROKE my weightless effect (.13 pounds to .8 pounds), and i can't unequip the damn thing...
---
Aye I found Beach Boys a weird choice, although it is entertaining rampaging though a horde with it playing in the background
---
Im not alone! Yes! I cant stsnf them
---
He needs to rename that bat "Negan"
---
Sure, they‚Äôll help a bit in PvE, but it‚Äôs not like a quarter-second faster draw is the difference between killing a scorched or dying. You don‚Äôt need to instantly draw your gun to kill the SBQ or a ghoul you heard groaning from 30 feet away. You go into those prepared. Coming around a corner and seeing a PvP opponent though? Absolutely.
---
Yeah, the "ladder" effect on the side of foundations are intentional to stop people from just making walls of foundations around their base as a way to stop mobs from getting to their base.
---
If they took that ladder effect away you'd just see bases built with foundation walls and nothing else.
---
calibrated shocks is by far the rarest mod so giving this as an answer is a little weird. also as i wrote above is the excavator bullshit...why would i hoard PAs in my stash lol.
---
At the end of the day the new game mode is optional. It's not like there won't be more pve content for the game on the way, You can still play adventure mode, with these new great QOL changes. I am confident adventure mode will continue to receive alot of free pve content over the next few years.
---
All the dlc for this game is free. Nuclear winter will probably bring in new players for a time, and some may actually stick around after who knows. This is GOOD for the 76 community.
---
My hope is that the wording is just bad, and they mean VATS will exit (without Gun Fu) the moment you kill something, rather than continuing for half a second while the body flies across your field of view, which always makes me spin around against my will.
---
But I've played long enough to temper my expectations lol
---
Very nice!
---
PC
---
I don't agree that someone should be number 1 on a PvP server for things PvE related, besides for time lived because that applies to both. It makes no sense to me at all. I never saw anyone in an indestructible base either but if they want to stare at a wall for an hour to make it to number 1 gaining absolutely nothing, no problem. The way it works now sucks actually. You go from last place to number 1 with 1 kill, get killed, goto to number 24, to 15, to number 3 all in a span of like 5 minutes doing almost basically nothing. Then some god roll unyielding sentinel will dominate the server for an hour, log off, and suddenly a level 12, 22, and 14 will be numbers 3 2 and 1 just cause they've been quietly questing for a bit and haven't died. I wish it would go back to the way it was before and if you wanna spice it up make it randomly choose a different player every 5 minutes to show up as wanted or something.
---
If you think about it, a live nuke should make radstorms more common across the map.
---
Ah, yes. We all know. It‚Äôs gonna be...
---
With bloodied running? Yeah definitely, with the right armor and perks like serendipity, dodgy, etc. The dmg output is crazy.
---
Yeah sniper can be slow. And virtually impossible with endgame events which is kind of annoying. You cant get sneak dmg with mobs aggro'd by other players. That's why I switch to commando build and weapons when heading to a queen or paradise event. Can't wait for perk loadouts.
---
I toyed with the powered doors as well but yeah, it looked like a zitty asshole. I have a nice looking house, and I want it to stay nice.
---
I have done the entire silo stealth not including launch prep.  The tricky part is the assaulttron in the reactor room where you need to pick the lock.  Between it and the rads buildup sometimes you have to kill it.  The other part that complete sneaking is hard is is the room where you have to destroy the first set mainframe  cores to get past the laser grid.  If you do not get turret spawns sneak is doable otherwise the damn turrets detect you and the bots become aggro.
---
Well then you didn't  complete it.
---
I'd love a good 3* guitar sword. Not sure what perks I'd like. Guess +1 str for one. Maybe increased power attack damage. Any ideas?
---
It still wouldn't work. The lore of the game says this scorched plague is a catastrophic event. Everybody who was still alive after the problems with raiders died to this. Anybody surviving got away, and anybody in the surrounding areas knows to stay far away. It's not really any different from the divide in FNV. Everybody is dead or turned into a marked man. Any references from people outside it make it clear it's a death zone.
---
Aside from the lore issues, the core problem of it being a MMO remains. You can't have any kind of NPC beyond what we already have. The game world is static, you can't build a new settlement or have any lasting impact. Even nukes only last a few hours and then everything returns to normal on the same server. We already have a traveling salesman, vendor bots, quest givers, random encounter robots to talk to. That's all the game allows. Anything more permanent would directly violate the core of the game mechanics. I don't understand why half a year after launch people are finding it so hard to accept that this is not, and is not intended to be, fallout 5
---
Interesting. Though I can totally imagine my friends loading this camp with hundreds of toilets or some thing :)
---
What does that have to do with what the OP asked?
---
Yeah, if anything, *thats* what needs to be done. An entire rework of Scout armor. I don‚Äôt get why they would even make an armor that can‚Äôt be upgraded or built through a crafting station. I also don‚Äôt get why the mods are randomized and not named as part-specific. This should‚Äôve been something people would complain about to get fixed.
---
Are you on PC? I have a 1*, can't remember if its level 45 or 50 though.
---
No link?
---
I agree, I have no issues with optional game modes, won‚Äôt change me playing this game at all, I just know for reading on here people will ‚Äúnever play again‚Äù if they add battle royal. I don‚Äôt get it, no one is making you opt in, survival mode only makes you opt in for weapon challenges but most of those guns aren‚Äôt even that good if you ask me
---
Add me: LatersHater
---
I will be on shortly and we will see what you are missing to complete it.
---
True, I think my current character is called Cait or something
---
Flawed comparison. The bag performs its function in an identical manner. Your examples change functionality.
---
That's the first thing I thought, but i doubt it. GunFu will be much harder to utilize in PvP because 1. We all have closer to the same health than the 5 ghouls you jusy VATSed with a lever action. And 2. If it is going to be this almighty balanced battle royale(god forbid) how many do you think you'll get the opportunity to vats kill 2 or more players in a row.
---
The guy who attacked you had a level 10 weapon...
---
And kill/eat him again right after his respawn, "accidentally".
---
Whatever happened to that lawsuit, anyway?
---
No one knows how this will work. They haven‚Äôt shared any details yet.
---
I was always hoping for the typical TSE Handmade until I came across a lvl 50 2\* Executioner's Handmade and fell in love with it. Pretty much gave up on the search for a TSE Handmade after that. I don't know if the Executioner's Handmade is particularly "god-tier" or whatever ppl say but I definitely enjoy the hell out of it. :)
---
Shit, I'm on PS4. Thanks though!
---
Why your newest posts never show up immediately in Fallout.com?
---
I'm strictly PVE so whatever new mode they've got in store doesn't really apply for me :)
---
Im not even that fussed about the overall budget, its just certain things like the small letters really shouldn't take up that much space :(
---
true :) I haven't complained about much but screw up my John Wick perk and I'll be pissed
---
So you have never been surprised by a ghoul, or a deathscorpion, or a damn cricket. Gotcha.
---
Not true I one shot, and get one shotted, regularly in PvP. I think they changed it so that it's not the only thing that's happening.
---
Nuclear winter is almost certainly going to have a new PvP battle Royale game mode. But why is this a huge issue? 
---
All of the dlc is free, and the game mode will be optional. I am confident there will be LOADS of new pve content coming for the game over the next few years. Some of you might not like PvP, but there are people who do. And who knows, this new game mode might bring in an influx of NEW players, where some of them actually stick around after the hype is over. New players are GOOD for 76.
---
Do what I do with my buds in-game..... Take the piss out of each other, share ammo, junk and food. Have a laugh and go slap Super Mutants and/or Glowing Ghouls. Explore (or as we call it...go on a 'walk about'). It's just about sharing the experience with others and makes a refreshing change from going solo. But the most important thing is to have FUN doing whatever you are doing :)
---
You need to see how many other players you can recruit to follow you round the server exclaiming *"I'm Negan!".*
---
Missiles are heavy and the mods and plans are hard to come by... I think its properly been nerfed enough... so please make the mods easier to find and stronger at least
---
Just added it
---
As a heavy gun build I got my heavy God gun. A 3\* AAE Gatling gun (bullets explode, 15% faster reload, ignores 50% of targets armor) Guess the next logical step is a 3\* AAE .50cal
---
Same, it's so satisfying downing a whole swarm of low level Scorched with Gun Fu. VATSing each one individually would be a giant headache.
---
actually i just placed a PA set that i had stashed and its an ultracite set so now i have 2 sets
---
Just buffing the damage by 12% would do. Mods-wise, you can just scrap it. Except for Prime. (If there is one.)
---
i put nsfw because of my language i wasn't sure. what was allowed.
---
This is fantastic!
---
ok, thx, thats what i thought.  If they dont reward old-timers for the time spent in-game, then i doubt their player base will hold.
---
It's a "game feel" thing.  I honestly never stopped to think about that wonky little delay in bringing the scope up, but it *is* longer than it needs to be.
---
Same!! Poor ZAX or JAX or JERGOFF or whatever wont be graced by my presence so long as its PvP BS! Waiting for a place I can go to Kill more legendaries instead of doing the SAME legendary run everytime i log on, spending the same 150 scrip every day, the wasteland gets old when 3 star enemies drop an exterminator's 10mm pistol.
---
I forget this is a console safe space.. None of this matters even slightly on pc... Except the numbers... That will be cool for a test. Now for the love of fuck can we get some pc issues fixed!
---
Yeah I see what you mean now. I decided to try it myself and see you can‚Äôt change anything about it.
---
Why not buy a Pocketed or Deep Pocketed Mod for it? I get you don‚Äôt want it to offset the weightless, but that could be a way to fix it for now.
---
I speak from literally no/little knowledge (I did mod Morrowind a bit) but it seems like just appropriately naming the mods should sort that out, and I seriously can't imagine it being very difficult.
---
The borked application of mods is probably deeper, but still needs to be addressed. I only modded my right arm "temporarily" until I found what I wanted. Now I've got those mods &amp; they won't apply.
---
A few reasons. The story pushes you east too soon. Then the game doesn't do a good job of giving low level legendaries. Campfire tales and leader of the pack are good starts but there needs to be more. Also, a lot of people take the convenience perks first for things like carry weight and not enough damage and build specific perks. So that makes it really hard to keep up with the enemy level increases. I know I didn't decide on a build until well after 50 so I was very unoptimized and had a hard time.
---
I am sure digging the damage numbers.
---
Braxson's Quality Medical Supplies usually has a high level monster spawn. I was server hopping there last week for Fog Crawlers and I got a Sheepsquatch 4 times out of 10 hops.
---
Breaking out Chems would be awesome.
---
More like "it arrives when it arrives."
---
Have you tried
---
-Disabling your antivirus during download
---
-Running Bethesda Launcher as administrator
---
-Starting the download over with 0 interruptions
---
-Installing on a different hard drive
---
?
---
My dream combo would be a TSE anti armor gatling , minigun or shotgun. I don't think this exists but I have a few anti armour 1star legendries and there excellent. Anti armour packs a punch.
---
Or a 3star grognax axe, instigating, with faster swing speed and +1 strength or something. Any other ability that's half useful lol. I have a collection of grognax axes, but there all 1star. I'm currently using a lvl 50 instigating one that does a base of 260 with my perks so first hit on any full strength ghoul, super mutant, scorched etc is a one shot kill. I want to be a barbarian lol.
---
Well idk what there is to do other than kill scorchbeasts/queens in groups? That's the point I got to, and then I quit. Feel free to lemme know if it's any different guys. Otherwise, I'd say the game is still in the same place, just less buggy.
---
I just prefer end game content.
---
I don't really see why it would. Or if it does, its a bug.
---
Your comparing apples and oranges here. Your filament print isn't going to come out at the same resolution as the helmet we purchased.
---
You don't have a resin printer big enough, they do. You are not using the same process they are and cannot produce a product at anywhere near the same quality level without a ton of post print work when printing in filament. That work has a value attached that is absolutely going to drive your cost up significantly. Even at minimum wage you are going to get close if not exceed the cost of the helmet from the set.
---
There is also electricty expended that needs to be added in.
---
And you know as well as I do that the likelyhood of a failed print goes up with time and complexity of the print. That adds costs as well.

"I was going to shoot you on site, but letting you live seem to be more of an insult." (It was something like this, I can't remember the exact wording. I was so excited about it that I tried to show him to a few other players. I must have looked bonkers.

People one tapping you and taking your stuff.

Happy: after learning of the changes
---
Not Happy: the idea of battle royale
---
Man fast travel would be a nice feature...
---
On the real I keep my rooms unlocked unless I fear mobs attacking it, such as generator rooms.
---
Absolutely. Didn't know that was possible until I was on the top floor of Ft. Defiance, minding my own business. Hopped out of my PA because I was 'safe'. Came out of one of the rooms to see the stuff of nightmares: a glowing wending clipping through the elevator doors and running right at me with 4 charred ones right behind. Wish I would've worn my brown pants that night...
---
Free range counted for me this morning.
---
Right, but since the armor of power armor is no more effective than regular armor in pvp, why not add some legendary effects that make it more viable in pvp? Obviously these would be random drops or maybe only available at the Purveyor, so they would be rare, but it'd be nice to at least have the option to play as power armor with heavy weapons and still be on par with non power armor builds in pvp.
---
It‚Äôs a neat concept but isn‚Äôt needed in the current state of the game. You can already just teleport to someone‚Äôs camp as it is. 
---
If 76 was an online persistent game without fast travel directly to someone‚Äôs camp, it would be nice. 
---
Another game I played a while back had a global vendor list. You could buy items from a terminal. Then you had to travel to their vendor in the game world to pick up your purchased items.
---
I really like your art style. I also like how you chose to make each poster a singular color scheme. Excellent work!
---
Wasn't implemented/Not yet implemented.
---
I didnt even notice the bag was different untilmi saw the video of a super angry bald man screaming like a toddler who just threw his toys out of the pram said it was different, but hey, i get a free second bag and 500 atoms
---
yeah, i'm going after muffled now, hopefullly thatll work out, sorry about being hostile in my reply, i was still a bit angry in that moment.
---
Yep. I misread. Sorry. Disregard.
---
How much space is free on the drive? If I remember correctly the launcher will flip out if the available space is too close to the required amount or something along those lines.
---
It did this to me recently as well, but I was trying to reinstall from a backup &amp; the launcher couldn't figure it out. 6h redownloading files I had on hand yaaaay
---
Nice work. I love seeing these, keep it up!
---
Data is useful. Its not the servers, since few report crashes its not the client. In this case, it is probably drivers. especially since they say they changed video cards recently. Likely old drivers still creeping around the system.
---
This is the one I had!! I could remember what it was, now I need to edit my comment, lol.
---
get  a bloodied one
---
&gt;  freedom monies 
---
Lmao
---
Lucille
---
I had that happen more than a few times. There was an army of Scorched outside one camp I went to, I just let them shoot one of the walls into dust, then went outside, killed them and looked at the owner's vendor.
---
Hmm seeems like that's the reason. I can't go clearing whole cache but oddly refresting the page won't still load the newest one. 
---
Oh well at least I know why now.
---
Man that sucks!  Did you invite pants guy to your team?  If so maybe that's how he killed you?  If he initiates PvP then I think every member of his team is out of Pacifist mode and can initiate PvP.  So all he has to do is leave the team and then kill you.  That's the sole reason I won't team up with randoms.  I hate this mechanic.  Either way, don't look at it like a wasted Sunday.  You got to play with your wife and got some good experience from the whole ordeal.
---
LMAO!!! Fresh out of the Vault ! LOL Welcome to 76 bro! There's more of that to come. So now he's prepared. LOL
---
Nicely Done Sir!
---
Generally, it‚Äôd still be useless.
---
I see, probably because the deal was too good and everybody would‚Äòve choosen just that option. Thanks for your response!
---
You don‚Äôt immediately until you check your challenges and it‚Äôs checked out. Trust me, when she gets to like 25% I pull out the executioners .50 cal and let loose in hopes of landing the final shot!
---
Game doesn't need them. Game needs more end game legendary drops, dungeons, and events.
---
have 127GB left , so is my download doomed?
---
I'd love to build a trapper set, but I'm ridiculously fussy about the pieces I'll use :P
---
Ideally I'd love to be able to test all trapper with 3 x Unyielding, 2 x Bolstering. I'd like to be able to compare the AP refresh secondary with the 25RR secondary. Getting those pieces though.....
---
Incidentally I have tried running WestTek in full Mutant's Sentinel pieces. It's ridiculous :)
---
I cant afford to redownload have capped internet , where i am from
---
A bug is precisely why I wonder lol
---
Umm no. I bought for both. I was planning to use the bag as a gym bag based on its original marketing. It looked rugged and capable. What I got was a joke not even nice enough to just be a display bag.
---
That said, I didn't get infuriated or demand anything, but pretending this wasn't a real issue to  be addressed is insulting.
---
I dunno, most the time people getting into fights are just having fun. I remember my group of 3 getting into a map wide stand off with a dude at one point. We killed him so many times, he took us out plenty. Sacked our camp, we stole and Bobby trapped his workshop. It went on for at least 2 hours. In the end I think we all had fun. Admittedly we were ready to be done with it by the end though lol.
---
Ouch
---
It's bugged at the moment, and it has been bugged since launch as far as i'm aware
---
Yeah, everyone who buys something shouldn't care about whether or not they get what they pay for. Companies should be allowed to advertise something, and sell something else that isn't what they advertised, without repercussion or consequence. They should be allowed to say something is one thing, to increase the value of it, and then not make it the way they said it. Companies should be legally allowed to rip people off and should never be held accountable for this because someone was pleased with the product on any level. "Everyone ordered that for the helmet," lmao are you just self-deprecating or really that stupid?
---
Weightless armour in general has the tendency to do that. Sometimes Im able to get it to 0++ whereas before you mod, look at how the stats are being affected
---
Flawed argument, nylon and canvas do not function identically.
---
I found the one terminal that works but there‚Äôs no inventory. Any workarounds?
---
Show damage!?! Bad ass!!!!
---
some sorta legendary flamer or similiar, trying to make a fire build, got the fireman excavator skin for it as well.
---
You know, now that you mention it, yes, my A3 bags are waterproofed heavy nylon canvas.  I got them in the 90s.  Maybe I should do the same and put some cool logos on them.  The longer it's been since I retired, the less I feel like I need to keep everything pristine.
---
Yeah. I've had this happen twice. I don't understand the rationale. And there camp wasn't somewhere where there was a close fast travel point.
---
This is pretty nifty
---
And here I was thinking of Will Smith in Independence Day...
---
There‚Äôs no reason a game environment can‚Äôt change long-term as the story progresses. Every major MMO ever has had new settlements (or hell, continents) pop up, new NPC factions roam into the area, an underground area we hadn‚Äôt found before opens up, etc. The Fallout franchise has a built-in mechanic for this: ‚ÄúGood news! We found another vault that wasn‚Äôt wiped out and it has some people that aren‚Äôt (all) irradiated thieving monsters!‚Äù Or (gasp) the map expands and there are some people still alive over that‚Äôaway. Or some folks a ways off have heard about the scorchbeast detectors, rad shields, and comfy CAMPs we‚Äôve all been building and roam this way.
---
A couple of months ago there wasn‚Äôt a super powerful assaultron in fur popping up to smash people. Now there is. The Burrow didn‚Äôt exist, and now it does. There‚Äôs no end of lore-friendly, perfectly viable ways of bringing more content into the game, and there‚Äôs no requirement that all of that content has to want to kill us and eat us. :)
---
I‚Äôm not advocating for making FO76 like every other MMO (blech) and damned sure not another single-player Fallout. Those are different kinds of games and ought to stay that way. There‚Äôs no reason though that we couldn‚Äôt gradually start to see some friendly (or at least less-burned) faces in the area.
---
Any chance of getting some prints of this? Awesome!
---
&gt; Thinking about trying Survival mode some time. What should I expect?
---
People aren't as helpful or friendly in survival because murder is a perfectly plausible outcome to meeting someone.
---
Keep the amount of junk and chems on your character low so you don't loose much if killed.
---
Have fun but keep looking over your shoulder.
---
If it gets too stressful out there in the wasteland come back to the friendlier folks on Adventure mode.
---
Unless  power user 2 is bugged.  I wonder...
---
Plastic, aluminum, screws, steel, lead and copper are the most common thing I look for and it usually depends on how bad I need it as to how much I‚Äôm willing to pay. 35-50 caps per bulk is what I hope to find.
---
I want to say it negates the increased hunger and thirst after playing with it a few nights ago. However maybe I'm incorrect.
---
Sure they do. The bag holds items of the same identical size allowance.
---
You might have an argument in allowable weight due to material properties but the bag was designed to hold the helmet, which the nylon does perfectly fine.
---
Yeah it a small change but seeing it makes it feel more RPGish you know. 
---
Numbers when damaging an enemy is something you didnt k ow you wanted until you got it!
---
NP. Another thing to consider having a couple you can quickly switch out because the reload is so slow. Like Have and Instigating Explosive and after firing switch to a TSE for the 2nd and final shot. Most things would be dead by then.
---
I would turn my mic on and I would sing them a song..
---
Keep knockin' but you can't come in
---
I guess you better let me be.. üòÇ
---
They work great for long jumps, but not so much for climbing.  Marsupial and Bird Bones help a lot, too.  Typically I only long-press to climb cliffs without having to find a perfect marsupial-height set of footholds.
---
Are you saying people didn't get their helmet?
---
I'm glad that they are making the shooting a bit tighter. That was one of my problems I had with fallout 4. I'm glad that they've been putting effort into it's improvement as other live service games like destiny really benefit from that. I'm curious if they are taking pointers from ID since they are down the road a bit from the Austin office. Improving gun based mechanics automatically quell some of the meta narrative towards melee
---
I have been using that bag every single day to haul gear between work and my house and it has held up fine since the release of the power armor edition.
---
I‚Äôm not against new people coming into the game, or even there being PvP options for the people that want that. In my experience though, the PvE community is a much larger part of the Fallout 76 player base than PvP, but they‚Äôre getting kinda shafted if Nuclear Winter is a wholly PvP affair. The Vault Raids will be a good addition to the PvE, but I‚Äôm also just waiting to see what else will be included in the summer updates. If there‚Äôs more of a balance like Wild Appalachia was, then I‚Äôm not so bothered. Another part of it for me is that adding Battle Royale comes off as a little tone-deaf on the part of Bethesda. A major criticism of Fallout 76 in general has been that they‚Äôre just chasing trends by having a online survival game, and then following that up by throwing in another trend? I‚Äôm not hating on Fallout 76. I‚Äôve been really enjoying it the past few months, I just question how Bethesda has handled some things.
---
It'll also help us test some legendary effects like bloodied, instigating, and furious.
---
Ditto
---
Perk card exchange is something I would like to see. I'm tired of having 6 butchers bounty cards in perception while waiting every other day to level up (over level 100) to get one point of scatter shot. ffs just let me exchange one for one. Hell at this point I would even go for 2 or 3 for 1.
---
I stand corrected. Makes it more awesome.
---
Hit q
---
I don't think any of the dailies have stash boxes. Thus, part of the challenge
---
i didnt know this, thanks for the heads up
---
yep rip
---
Its all about screws and gears
---
Oh I have to give you that--it looked super badass when you rapidly tapped the button, even before they fixed the fire effect on it.  It pairs very well with the Hotter Rod paint job for some really cool meteoric "superhero" landings.
---
My experience is that it is mostly ppl leveling or doing weekly survival challenge then going back to adventure while a very small amount of ppl pvpin each other near a train station.
---
People got butthurt about the people that tried to benefit , I do understand the frustration of all of the tryhards for not even getting the initial bag lol so yeah
---
That's awesome!!
---
It might be. I‚Äôve never tried to quickly bring a sniper scope to my eye IRL. :) But pulling out a .50 cal and aiming it when you weren‚Äôt holding it a second ago? That shouldn‚Äôt be an instant trigger pull.
---
No biggie either way, I‚Äôd just like to have seen more than gunplay changes. Hopefully they‚Äôll come.
---
Glad it worked out for you. Not for me. I wouldn't have bought the PAE if the marketing showed the bag that I received.
---
Yeah it's way more dramatic than I ever saw before.  I first tested it a couple of months ago when someone posted that jetpack burns up core energy, but I didn't even see it move back then.  While they're "fixing" things, maybe they'll fix stomp damage and explosive vents?
---
Just a guess, but with some of these glaring issues that exist, the work &amp; effort could be better spent on those than introducing a new mode (and likely a handful of bugs associated there as well).
---
It doesn't appeal to me in the least, but I'm not gonna toss my toys out the pram over it either.
---
I've been thinking about making a cliff side base, like try to have it right on the side of a sheer cliff. Really like the idea of having a little faux camp right up top.
---
Because people like to bitch and complain on the Internet and completely miss the point that it is entirely optional like survival.
---
If you don't like PvP don't play survival and whatever this mode turns out.
---
It's not like the mode is even remotely most of the DLC.
---
FFS survival was a new mode in Wild Appalachia and it was small when compared to the rest of the DLC.
---
I want a Legendary Delivery Robot.
---
I lock up my adhesive farm plants but that‚Äôs it
---
Can I use this as my phone background? And who should I credit if someone ask? :) (like just your reddit name or?)
---
If it helps I've found the sheepsquatch at these locations.
---
The houses close to welch station a level 50 1*, Braxton's medical supplies level 80 1*, At the edge of the tree line near the rest stop east of investigators cabin level 80 1*, Somewhere between The thorn and Forward station alpha head straight east from devils backbone and you should run into it the ASAMs will help out a lot, you can camp in all of these spots and have your turrets assist the spawns are pretty consistent.
---
I disagree, lets not make power armor worse than it already is. Also it is totally unrealistic for anyone to be firing a minigun without some sort of mechanical assistance in any situation.
---
Try turning it on and off again
---
I've done that too.  It's pretty easy with enforcer as long as you don't mind tanking the gunfire before you break their arms.  My only regret is that there aren't enough sentries around WS.  I wish the power plant workshops had better core production, or maybe that random power armor spawns had better than 25% cores in them.
---
Its shitty reasoning on the lead designer‚Äôs part. But you don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù repair kits to win. Its pretty easy to do without, and just keep multiple guns on you, plus have the right (totally free) perk cards equipped (which reduce the rate at which a weapon degrades).
---
I‚Äôm trying to ELI5, because typically the people that STILL bring this up as an ‚Äúissue‚Äù typically don‚Äôt actually play the game. Therefore its pretty hilarious to most of us when someone (YongYeah) says ‚Äúyeah but the repair kits are total Pay 2 Win, what a totally shit game‚Äù. And we‚Äôre all over here laughing, cooking our rad roaches and setting off nuclear weapons to please the Interloper.
---
Because BR has been done to death by literally every company now and people are tired of it.
---
no waaaay XD
---
The handmade can hold 85 bullets in barrel mode so I think it was overpriced- save your caps and you might get better yet. I've a 1* anti armor handmade with an automatic receiver. Chews through enemies and mountains of 5.56!
---
As others have suggested, here is the link to the build site. At the bottom is the leveling up link once you have your build.
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I suggest putting some thought and time into your build. Consider YOUR play style. For example, rifle or melee? sneak or tank? My first toon I did not consider any of this until level 30 and by then I had to move stats around once I hit 50+
---
Thanks! What price point would you pay for them?
---
These are beautiful!  I just started sharing mine on r/FalloutCaptures \- maybe you should too!
---
I got downvoted on a similar thread for wanting npc's to come back. It makes sense for settlers, raiders,  and the various factions to return to Appalachia after the "nuclear winter ".  It's the normal progression to the story imo.
---
Honestly just some faction leaders and quest givers would be nice. Drop in some roving bands of raiders and traders too! 
---
Unfortunately the vast majority of players don't roleplay as npc's, and the way the perk system works everyone can pretty much be a master of everything.
---
Well good news buddy, you are getting two bags for the price of one! Even though they totally didn't advertise the bag as something that fit the needs you needed fullfilled to begin with.
---
ill use alt F4
---
Thank you! Take your upvote.
---
Have you ever thought it's not gonna be Battle Royale but rather a deathmatch mode with supply crates periodically dropping?
---
They‚Äôre looking great! Keep it up!
---
It‚Äôs a great idea but just fundamentally can‚Äôt happen. It has to always be Reclamation Day so new Dwellers can leave the vault
---
I completely understand why many people are skeptical of this decision, and I know it makes some afraid that Bethesda is focusing on PvP mainly for the nuclear winter dlc this summer. 
---
But remember that survival mode was only a small part of the wild Appalachia dlc, the vast majority of that update was pve content and much needed QOL improvements to adventure mode. I'm confident Bethesda will include plenty of pve updates with nuclear winter. 
---
Bethesda knows the majority of their players don't like PvP, so I'm certain they will have some great content on the way for the larger pve community for years to come :)
---
You go! She may not be the *best* looking girl in the wasteland, but she's the *only* girl the wasteland.
---
Adding new modes when the current modes need a lot of work is why people are angry. It would also divert dev attention from the rest of the game. I don't know about you but I'd rather they focus on the core of the game, and not some side project that most people won't be interested in.
---
Lol love all the people in here defending the griefers bad behavior.  Don't take a post about someone else personally guys lol
---
I'll take you up on that, make it a desktop background.
---
On principle, I'd like to compensate you when physical copies \*are\* a thing.
---
Remember that a Bloodied build is a glass cannon.  A Bloodied build shirks all other bonuses to stack as many bonuses as possible while below ~20% health.  In a PvP situations, they have to strike first, usually through sneak attack or ambush.  In boss battles, they have to keep their distance while they serve as a major contributor to the DPS, but they'll go down extremely easily.  If you want to one-shot almost everything, but can deal with being killed by 3-4 ghoul hits, a bloodied build might be for you.  It's the meta for mowing down Scorchbeast Queens and instigating PvP, but it's a bit less enjoyable than other builds otherwise.
---
That's good to know about the emergency protocols, though.  I just bought the plan and haven't installed it yet, but it's very nice to know it's coming, and that it doesn't eat cores as fast.  That 25% thing really sucks--luck should have some say in what you get when you find one.  Maybe they changed it because it's not instanced loot?
---
I‚Äôve noticed a difference in the depletion I believe because I use it for the same reason
---
If you scrapped the frame the pieces should appear in inventory
---
I think it would be better to just keep things straight forward like.other games do and tie the in game weather to the real life months. March-may is spring, June-august is summer,  etc just leave the seasons set for 3 months at  time.
---
Probably because the effort it took to make this new mode and then maintenance for the new mode afterwards could have been better spent on content more people want and fixing the base game even more.  I don't really see people asking for more PvP in this game so why waste time adding something no one wants. 
---
At least thats my viewpoint on it.  I have absolutely no interest in BR of any game, to me they are a waste of time and effort.  So for a game like Fallout 76 to add another PvP mode instead of adding good content is astounding. Plus Fallout 76 doesn't even do PvP well at all, so in that aspect its even worse.
---
Because it's 2019 and you aren't allowed to simply be apathetic.  You must RAGE over any perceived slight! And then shout about it on YouTube!  And rant about it at every opportunity, even when no one asked!
---
Its never over till you nuke them to assert dominance
---
Also too easy to get imo
---
Hey, mom of 2 kids here too. FO76 is seriously addicting. I drove by a dead possum and for a second considered taking a picture of it. It‚Äôs awesome when I can get a few stints of time to play. My kids are cool with letting mom have a couple of hours of gaming time as long as I reciprocate and give them a couple of hours of undivided attention. This is my first online game too and I am really enjoying it. I even found an awesome buddy in Appalachia. He‚Äôs at least 70 levels ahead of me and helps me out a ton. He talked me into a bloodied build and now I feel like a badass. I would recommend finding a buddy. It‚Äôs been fun having someone to talk to and laugh about all the weird shit that happens in the wasteland.
---
Oh yeah, good point, I didn't even think twice about that. I was so confused that I had to look into it. Apparently the people who do this think about it as if the thumb stick is attached to the back of the character's head. So you move the thumb stick to the right the head swivels to look to the left, and vice versa.
---
I still think it's weird as fuck but I guess I understand where they're coming from.
---
You on PC? I might have something you could use.
---
r/wholesomereddit
---
Maybe, but the backpack is disabled when you get in your PA.
---
I play almost exclusively on survival unless I wanna finish some quests fast. Carry only a few small stacks of essential food/water/chems because you run the risk of dropping whole stacks of things. Also stash your junk as much as possible. Nothing makes me happier than when I kill someone with 500 lead on them. You can only see the top 3 players on the map, and it's really not hard to make it into the top 3 accidentally so keep an eye on your place and plan accordingly. I like it because you never know what do expect. Very rarely will people team up or help you. Keep your mic off too because people will hear you and come find you. Basically try it out for a while and see if you like it. On my lvl 76 character I only lose 12 caps when I die. Not bad really.
---
I like PA and all but no reason not to make non PA work too.  What we really need is legendary PA pieces to start dropping and be added to the Purveyor too.
---
Now that servers don't crash it's time to nuke all fissure primes and turn off those red lights in the Enclave bunker.
---
You really have to be perked out to heavy guns to make them work well. The recoil is just too much. Even just getting 3points in the stabilized perk helps tremendously. A friend has that same gun and it's his primary and he can just melt enemies with it.
---
IMO, there's no way they'll let you convert anything that requires stable flux to craft, unless it's into something that requires the same number of stable fluxes.
---
Came back here to tell you that I have not gotten a single great roll since this one lol. 6 2\* rolls a day (two characters) for the past 13 days.
---
Oh no! Well name it so you don't loose it!
---
The targeting computer always worked for me, but since you lose the ability to get critical hits and you never seem to get a stealth hit you never get the big damage multipliers that guns get.
---
Ok you stole my dreams somehow...
---
I just started playing the game because my kid wanted to play as a team.  I ventured to Camden Park as a level 5 while he was off doing his own thing building a camp.  I was getting my butt kicked pretty bad.  I commented over the mic about them being a higher level and getting killed.  A minute later he fast travels to me, wipes them out and walks away.  Not all kids are terrible but most are hard to put up with.
---
As much as I hear what you're saying, how many of these do you think they've done? Maybe they just don't feel like it. It seems kind of presumptuous to suggest that someone drop everything they're doing to help.
---
"....ow"
---
Before i clock this link im gonna make a prediction, its the let me in meme isnt it
---
You can track challenges so you get a screen notification when it's complete. Button on xbone is Y, not sure about the others
---
I got one for sale! PC?
---
Well, it's kind of difficult to run-and-gun with a Gatling gun in the first place, and Sentinel benefits from being stationary, so there isn't much tradeoff in what you're suggesting.
---
I wish Stabilized wasn't exclusive to PA, but I also accept that it is because they obviously wanted there to be a tradeoff.
---
Plot twist: 
---
 The nylon bag becomes the highly sought after collector‚Äôs item that people pay thousands of dollars for on eBay.
---
Combine the ideas: put a Legendary monster in the box for you to fight.
---
I think the fact that I was ready to get angry as I was reading your comment only proves you right. Take my upvote.
---
I'll go if don't already have other plans, Mom!
---
I mean, if I was offered a choice between a few new weapons, or an improved Taming system vs Battle Royal... imma pick the first two 100% of the time
---
I don't know what you mean by "barrel mode". A drum mag on a handmade holds 75 bullets iirc, and I could only imagine that the rifle being "quad" would quadruple that to 300. Anti-armor is nice, but I prefer the furious legendary effect. 
---
And yes, it was a bit pricey, but he knew what it was worth to me. He knew I would have paid the 22k if I had it, which is why he priced it so high.
---
Nice! I forgot all about that. I‚Äôm turning that on as soon as I log in, thanks!
---
I just take a picture with my phone of players currently on the server. Then if you get dc'd you can join their game and be right back in the action.  Xbox1 player.
---
Chally the moo-moo feels unappreciated
---
Fine, as long as PA users get Serendipity
---
&gt;  This would also help Gun Fu if it switches targets immediately
---
Yep I came here to say that too. Currently you can put 10 bullets in an already dead target before it switches!
---
Well clearly someone knows how to party.
---
yeah, that's part of why i hate it... I'm running a non-PA build this go round. I'll stick with my shottie and Resolute Veteran until something better comes along.
---
Can you give me one good reason to show up if I don't get anything worth while out of it.
---
No offense meant, but who are you to tell people what to do?
---
If I want to farm screws at Sugar Grove, or sit at my camp and just drink beer, I'm doing just that and won't be headed to Fissure Prime.
---
Because they are heavy support weapons that are meant to be in static or mounted positions?
---
PA makes you a walking tank and gives you the strength you need to have any chance of success firing such a weapon in combat. The simulation we have right now is already a compromise of realism versus gameplay that works.
---
Sure, and I drew my weapon and dealt with it. It‚Äôs Fallout for cripe‚Äôs sake - there aren‚Äôt a whole hell of a lot of instant-death, seriously threatening PvE encounters that you don‚Äôt see coming. Coming around a bend to see some bouncing idjit in a PvP build with a sniper rifle aimed at your head though - then you want some more twitch-style gunplay, which is what this round of changes is adding.
---
Seriously though...damned crickets.
---
Get an anti armor heavy gun or 10mm SMG on the sheep. They melt the damn things.
---
&gt;"You better do what I want because I'm an entitled asshole" 
---
Fixed it for you. 
---
just let people play the game the way they want to.
---
upped for Eric Andre!
---
Out of all the Johnny Cash songs I think "when the man comes around" would be the best fit since its literslly based off of the apocalypse and the four horseman, and they already did the rider armours based off the horseman of the apocalypse
---
We should be able to attach some springs and have our doors close.
---
I was wondering the same thing.  Hoping someone can confirm either way.  I guess it would still be a good weapon for a few days till you level out of it.
---
The eat people was in the greek letters on a brick wall. What you described sounded like it
---
Pro tip when fighting SBQ, when she is "stuck" in the air (flying in one spot only) go to 3rd person and aim as far up as you can get, then put SBQ in the crosshair, no need to worry about recoil! I use this with my Plasma Gatlings and it is very effective!
---
Damned crickets indeed...
---
then maybe new PA mods?
---
Would be nice, like how we lock doors but have the option to add auto closing bars onto them
---
Love this, a friend of mine built a multi level, 5 doors, all are left open by buyers lol the machines are even immediately available upon spawn too lol
---
There‚Äôs a timer, you just gotta set it up properly.
---
yea I get that. but what else are you doing in the game at that point. taking pictures? daily and weekly challenges? Na go put in some work for 15-20 min if that.
---
It does but still does pathetic damage. The real problem is lack of critical hits and sneak bonus.
---
Yes and u can become a scorchbeast at level 120
---
I thought the BR mode was some rumor started ages ago by people who misunderstood what 76 was.  Are they making it a thing? I‚Äôm behind on the news so my apologies.
---
Just go to the random spawn points and relog until one shows up.
---
No where does it say or indicate that the canvas bags only purpose is to hold the helmet.
---
Reading this string i see that you do not have a problem with a company that advertises an item and then switches it to a cheaper item after you have made payment.  I do not think I will be shopping at your vending machine
---
Mind if I add this to my bug round up?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs quite easy. That‚Äôs what I did when I started my character. Just do greaser jacket and jeans
---
Really?
---
don't tell me how to play
---
I almost always join in regardless, but it almost seems like a catch 22. If high levels don't see other high levels already there they very well may decide its not worth the risk of wasting a bunch of ammo and breaking weapons and armor.
---
thank you for posting this for us wage-slaves who cant access it at work
---
Ah see I wasn't sure and couldn't seem to find the date they made that trip. I have a terrible memory for the events of the earlier games.
---
&gt;Man fast travel would be a nice feature...
---
It is a feature?
---
Done about 10 since launch and have never got anything that made it worthwhile, and that's if her body was accessible or lootable in the first place lol.
---
This is the only reason I carry raw fertilizer.
---
I like to "gift" it inside their house before I FT away.
---
how do you get the Pioneer Scout challenges?
---
It's a game. It's supposed to be fun. If you focus too much on damage and stats you're gonna forget about fun. People need to start using more buzz saw  and assultron head type weapons. Yes you will die... laughing.
---
I love my level 35 1* explosive dragon. It's ridiculously slow and heavy but it makes ghouls lift into the air if you shoot their feed! 
---
Dream weapon.....Mr Handy Four Shot Instigating Octo Exposive Dragon Head
---
No not really, that‚Äôs false.
---
Even a rope and pulley with a weight on the end
---
I really think intel should also increase energy damage by x per point as well.
---
Your lucky it wasn't me who found you.
---
Go ahead! Here's a reddit I found that helps alot with the scout mods too: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2

Glad to hear new sights for the heavy gunners out hereüí™
---
Nocturnal Exposive is great... At night

No im not dropping what im doing to help you theres millions of other nukes I can easily find yours is nothing special
---
Xbox, unfortunately.

OP, I understand your frustrations, but it would be better to organize a group ahead of time.
---
I know right, and probably ghoul slayers
---
Anything that slightly resembles a W is classed as a white power symbol these days, so let's go with that.
---
I agree that what sells isn't a good indicator of the power of an affix, but it is how other players are valuing it. It will be interesting to see how in-game damage numbers (just announced) will change the market for items.
---
Power armor is so under powered right now. I get it needed to be somewhat weak to have a balance but it‚Äôs just so bad at the moment. Most of the perk cards for PA have been kinda weak to the counter parts.

I lock mine because I don't want people in my living area, I have a whole open vendor/hotel area for anyone to use. However my fast travel location doesn't spawn inside the structures.

Not if you regularly brush and floss.

If you are on PS4, I have a couple of Death Tambos for sale in my machine. IIRC, I put them up at 30 caps.
---
Camp is n the forest, on a power transmission tower just S of Monongah, where the road T's to go to Bolton Greens.  Bronze lion at the top of the stairs)
---
You are not high enough level for the lowest level death tambo I have seen (which I think is L25, the highest I''ve seen is L45, and the only legendary was bloodied), but they are very light - right around 1#, I think. so no biggie to get one eary.
---
BTW, I used a death tambo from L27 or so until about L40.
---
Oh must have been somebody else who knows what‚Äôs really going on...
---
Yeah, but it's pretty exceptional with its legendary prefixes. Seems a shame to waste it
---
nope, go play the little endgame content we have then they can go back to taking pictures and whatever else they do.
---
No you do not. That healthy vault living has given us a natural immunity.
---
I have close to that now but its a 50% block damage reflection, health gain and +1 Agility....with maxed Martial Artist.  its an insane item, got it from a Whitesprings run at 3am.  Good luck, THE DREAM IS REAL!!
---
No problem! No pressure, but I am looking forward to the next one :-).
---
A Fatman does barely more damage in one shot than a TSE Gauss
---
If it's to be a new BR mode, that means the next major update is filled to the brim with new content I'll never see because I have no interest whatsoever in battle royale games. And it's completely unnecessary. If a person wants that gaming experience, there's no shortage of other titles out there that offer exactly that. Hell, if a person wants battle royale in an underground bunker beneath a smoldering post-nuclear hellscape, there's tons of games that already have them covered. Throwing FO76 onto that already-towering heap adds nothing to that genre or to Fallout as a franchise or as a moneymaking property.

As a level 240 ... no.  I'll do what I want.
---
I can get my TSE Gauss to hit for like 1300 per shot
---
Nah I‚Äôm being honest. I don‚Äôt think those rules apply to survival.
---
Zing!
---
So, I've taken a lot of screenshots in Fallout 4 for youtube thumbnails. Made some pretty amazing ones. What people don't realize is that I sometimes spent an hour or more doing "photoshoots" around the Commonwealth to get one good shot. When you get JUST the right lighting with JUST the right weather and an interesting outfit and manage to catch an interesting pose, with lots of graphical mods and a good ENB, the game CAN look gorgeous. But usually it looks very mediocre. 
---
Some of my older shots from my Fallout 4 FROST v.4 playthrough:

---
Sorry don't have those uploaded to imgur yet, but you can see them in the playlist. Some of them... I gotta say, are truly awesome. Really captures the atmosphere. But yeah, some of the better ones took an hour of staging fights, playing with lighting / weathers, and of course some photoshopping.
---
I can see why it's there but it is annoying.  I get stuck all the time between a high foundation and generators or water purifiers close to them.
---
When I first started playing, building suffered from a lot of placement bugs.  I built a 1 foundation base sky base so I could place my base where I wanted.  I moved my CAMP and that one foundation was too high up and I had to enter my base from one specific angle.  I didn't have marsupial and couldn't place stairs for some reason.  It was a pain in the ass, but then I figured out that enemies couldn't get up either.  I'm rambling, but yes I get why they did it and also I agree with you.
---
If you're having a big issue with enemies destroying your first floor, try using that first floor as the foundation and build on the second floor up.  Like a beach house.  To access your house, place a foundation in front of your door.  Don't snap it into place, but move it back from the door about 0.5 or 1.5 foundation squares.  Put some stairs pointing towards the door.  You should have a foundation with stairs, then a gap and then your door.  Yeah the first floor will get destroyed, but nothing can reach your second floor since enemies can't jump the gap.  It won't save you from gun fire, but it will from melee attacks.
---
Example:  |________| \_
---
exactly why we all need to show up everytime. ammo and repairing that's nothing at this point. go help out. do what the overseer wanted us to do. if a lvl 35 is gonna show up k owing they are gonna die and waste all their stuff then a 287 can show up knowing hes well equipped to recover.
---
Had something similar happen.  Was about to buy a full set of Nuka-Cola themed power armor for 100 caps per item and poof, server crashed.  I only managed to get the helmet.....
---
You‚Äôre not my boss!!
---
The train station is technically twice as far as the Red Rocket, from Biv.
---
My melee tank wears that anyway. He was originally made to look like Charlie Sheen from Forrest Beulller
---
Your fine on space that's for sure.
---
I'm guessing you've tried restarting the download already? As painful as it is this was the only way I resolved my issue.
---
May be worth it to fire off a support ticket to Bethesda, they'd have a better grip on the launcher (I hope).

---
Sight sight sights!!! You magnificent people!. As a heavy gunner man this is a huge QoL change for me. Seriously. Thankyou.
---
On a side note, can you please adjust the sights and expanded magazine on the gatling gun so it isn't blocking our view so heavily.
---
Dude they announce bug fixes and stuff in patch notes, not previews.
---
It'd be neat if the immunization process actually did something, like maybe a permanent 5% resistance to disease -- something token that just sort of plays into the storyline. But no, as far as I know it does nothing for you because the scorched plague doesn't really exist as an infection vector. :(
---
I removed the doors and even an end wall so that people can stroll around but, I lock the steel extractor. Everyone tries it and there are days that the lock goes *poof* and I won't have steel for an hour from the thing but yeah, door locking is kinda pointless IMO.
---
&gt;Change perks cars so all cards = 1 point. Leveling up the cards is bad.  Can not separate them.  No need for it.
---
That is such a smart idea, the only one that would react differently would be the 10-15-20% upgrades. In my builds I purposefully run 1 of each type (base, master, expert) 3 cards for 30% versus 9 cards for 60%. 
---
I guess they could just have it say (10% for the first card, +5% after that) and run with this idea.
---
Yup
---
gimme gimme
---
I personally think we should ALL get 500 atoms for being dragged through this over and over again for a bag lol
---
Dumbing things down even further... unbelievable. 
---
Are preschoolers the new target audience now? 
---
Hey, here's another suggestion: in Patch 11, why don't you remove magazine sizes? Shooting 2000 rounds continuously without having to stop and reload (yuck!) would feel much more fluid and would be much more fun! And in Patch 12, why don't you remove the different ammo types? With just one universal fits-all-ammo type we could finally fire your guns with confidence! In Patch 13, you could remove different weapons altogether and just have one ranged gun and one melee weapon. Just imagine the strategic possibilities! And in Patch 14, just add auto-aim with perfect accuracy. Let's spend less time adjusting our aim, because that's not fun at all!
---
In all seriousness... This is one of the ITV articles where they should have included detailed comments by the developers. I'd love to know who thought such changes were necessary - and why. Please enlighten us!
---
yeah my dcg didn't work and then I switched to a sledgehammer and it worked
---
You can repeat it as many times as you want.
---
For 2k caps each additional time...
---
I love running the SBQ. Grinding out those Prime plans.
---
But placing expectations on strangers? Setting yourself up for disappointment bud. Telling others how to play? Rude.
---
I‚Äôd say now is a much better time to join than when it launched. It‚Äôs really fun and has a great end game loop. Adventuring never gets old and it‚Äôs full of random encounters with other people that are quite unlike anything I‚Äôve seen before. If you enjoy fallout 4 or love good Adventure RPGs like Skyrim then I would say it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Definitely do the few of the quests for the main story, it gives you a good start. Do events! Stockpile ammo and keep any high level armor or weapons in your stash.
---
Reply is ADA approved.
---
I really hope this fixes the damage bug...
---
Yep. If I don't see a mob teleporting in, I skip it. Pisses me off to burn through 2K rounds of ammo for zero reward.
---
no i did mine with a bloodied sledgehammer
---
Ah ok that's understandable but I still like to enjoy using the first floor to build a nice home. I have my crops and water in the middle of the camp with a good amount of protection.
---
I also know that I can't stop enemies from shooting my base and that's fine but I don't like it when I have a high enough placement of the foundation that allows enemies to walk up the side. Surprisingly enough the super mutants walk up the stairs but scorch and mole rats hover in the air at an angle as they attack the perimeter with melee attacks. Guess super mutants have an understanding of how to use my home.
---
If the lawsuit is the one with Fallout Shelter, then it ended in Bethesda‚Äôs favor. Other then that one, idk what lawsuit your talking about.
---
Get those pearly peepers, binoculars that tag enemies/players. Pretty useful at times!
---
Does anyone even have a paddle ball?
---
How f\*cking arrogant are you to DEMAND that every player level 100+ immediately drop whatever they are doing at that moment you decide YOU want to drop a nuke and fight SBQ?
---
What an entitled egotistical little b\*tch...
---
Next time you want to drop a nuke and fight SBQ, organize a group ahead of time and make prior arrangements   instead of telling anyone else to play the f\*cking game just to suit your own precious needs...
---
I've killed that thing dozens of times now. It not worth the effort or bullets at this point. I may show up; I may not. To tell you the truth, I find fighting the camp interface so that my camp doesn't look like a cockeyed atrocity the real endgame boss.
---
Even cooler on survival to make a pit. Put a shop and tame a deathclaw. Wait watch the fireworks when someone spawns in üòÄ
---
Better stated than what I posted...
---
I love everything about this post
---
I kinda am imagining it like a Hunger Games style arena
---
"Problem's in the Bag?"
---
Thsi is what i think a lot of poeple seem to miss when i hear people say they want human Npcs added in, they think were saying "the game has no story" when in reality we just want people, some human raiders, some random encounter settlers or traders, a crazy guy running around the woods, people to work on your farms or house your workshops
---
Changing the value of "bPlayMainMenuMusic =" from 1 to 0 kills the main theme music for me but clearing the value of "sIntroSequence =" does nothing to the Atomic Shop music.
---
Yes I can verify this and with the +1 to over all strength it increases melee damage as well! That‚Äôs why IMO +1 strength is the best one to have on armor.
---
Dude i want deathmatch mode so bad. All our gear in an enclosed area, but no repairing or ammo lost. Just pure fun violence.
---
Challenges.
---
Have fun collecting wood 7600 times for 40 cents.
---
So how do you get things from one account onto the other?
---
That ignore the last two weeks of update emails...
---
1) it seems ridiculous in the context of the franchise.
---
2) the mechanics of the game aren't great for it
---
3) Seems like needless manhours spent  that could  be better spent elsewhere.
---
I got the vertibot one from taking a picture of the one at the poseidon energy plant.
---
I had some trouble getting a cargo bot - took several shots around different areas.  I FINALLY got it by doing the event at Morgantown airport.  I had to be ridiculously close to it to get it to register for the challenge, though.
---
Actually, I'd say the opposite is a stronger motivator.  A Lv. 287 has likely launched and done multiple nukes.  A Lv. 35 is likely a (really early) first timer and, as a community, we should try to give them the win.
---
They are NOT weightless.  Get a few thousand and you'll see.
---
Cloud uses *dress like a woman*. 
---
It is super effective.
---
Wish I could put it on the wall of my C A M P
---
Ahhh!!! :)
---
Second this. I picked up my first good bloodied weapon two weeks ago (BE Handmade) and started to fiddle around with it, i also found a BE Lever in a player vendor for 7K caps and couldn't pass it up. Finally get to put my bolstering and unyielding armor to use. It's great for open world battles where you can keep a distance and nail everything from afar, but if I end up with a few too many ghouls in the WS clubhouse i'm toast. I'll pop some radaway and stimpacks and swap for the AAE Lever and my vampires tesla, which basically grants me whitesprings immortality instead. It's cool to put together the power of bloodied, but it's not as enjoyable as a good combat build.
---
Haha yeah, i noticed that too.
---
If I'm busy and think I'm gonna be more than a few minutes late, I usually won't go just because I think I won't get in enough damage before she dies. Like 9/10 times we take her out in 6 minutes or less. Unless she's flying away contstantly or bugs out on something, it's not a long fight.
---
I noticed that with the drill. It did nothing at all. Got rid of it quite quickly.
---
Good stuff. I didn't even know there was a launch animation until I stumbled upon a silo just as somebody inside triggered a launch pretty recently.
---
These are awesome!
---
like zzzx-01
---
That‚Äôs a hard no from me. SBQ means moving cards, changing inventory for PA, spending lots of ammo, in the hopes that you can kill her and then if you do the possibility of looting her. The rewards are not worth the effort. I can get a 1*legendary rolling pin much easier ways.  
---
I‚Äôm far more likely to jump to free range or paradise than SBQ.
---
Go with the prices as written by Animedave85 and look whats possible.
---
it's an event. yall dont do events? I bet when arktos pharma opened up all of yall were down their fighting and looting. poor things. got so selfish in your later years. all that level for nothing.
---
Hi far more likely to jump to free range or paradise than sbq., I'm dad.
---
my stash box doesn't have any room for another t60 jet pack plan.
---
I run stealth-bloodied/unyielding melee.  That way you can get the 3x damage perk.
---
I could see a Mole Miner raid against their main horde lair as a high level raid. They can try to introduce new enemies exclusive to the raid as well. There's so much potential with raids, they shouldn't just stick to Vaults :/
---
Wait, so where you drop your camp is where spawning happens?
---
It's working as intended.  legendary effects that lower the weight of an item only work on the BASE item.  Mod weights are unaffected.  
---
You can take say, a 90% weight reduction handmade rifle that starts off around 1lb and still get it to \~10 lbs or so by adding mods to it.  Has always been this way.  
---
Your item isn't "ruined" as it still doesn't count as armor for the chameleon mutation and you now have the AP benefits of ultra light mod on an armor piece that's still less than 1 lb, you are doing just fine.
---
Nope had to recraft it( if that‚Äôs a real word)
---
Yeah I hopped onto survival to do the unstoppable monster stuff and the moment I got any xp at all I was suddenly 3rd place. Like, on three or four different servers. Doesn't that mean there's only like 3 people in the whole server?
---
I have yet to receive any mods for chainsaws and I‚Äôve scrapped a bunch.
---
Just finish the quest. That‚Äôs what fixed it on a recent play through.
---
Jesus... It's like people are sitting around and waiting for every new update *just* to find a flaw in it and cheat or exploit. 
---
Literally it's sad people can't just enjoy the game the way it's meant to be played.
---
Yeah, I'm actually kind of glad people who threw fits about the bag did so.  It really outed themselves to the world to be immature little shits we can all ignore in the future!
---
Lol that took no time at all. Thnx dad.
---
Usually I have a friend in the game either hold it for me, or I'll put it in a desk and swap to the other character and then get it back out.
---
I want all the 3/4/NV music to come back.
---
what do u mean. the weight of my armor literally goes from .13 to .8 when ultra light says "reduces armor weight". that's broken.
---
I don't know why I'm curious about Pants Guy. Was that his name? Was he wearing pants and if so, what kind of pants does Pants Guy wear?
---
Yeah, no.  I try to help when I can, but I am not your minion to summon.
---
Especially if you're the kind of weirdo who nukes Drop Site V9 and then wonders why no melee players show up and why the SBQ takes twice as long to kill (if you even can).
---
Yep, your spawn point is wherever you first drop your CAMP module.
---
I don't know that it's a bug.  legendary weight reduction never affected anything other than item base weights.  Mods have always been ignored.
---
Quests, events, SBQ, build things together, share/trade materials...
---
‚ÄúBONK‚Äù

The camera doesn't care how good your pictures look it only cares if it says the name of what you're trying to take in the top right-hand corner of the screen, another tip is if you're full on pictures you don't have to go delete more to take more pictures simply keep taking pictures with your camera as long as the names in the top corner of the screen it will register for that challenge even if you don't have space and your photo album
---
You have to visit Camp Lewis. If you have the personal terminal, I think it'll trigger the quest. Otherwise visiting the location itself will trigger as well.
---
thank you
---
What we‚Äôre doing is playing the game the way we want to. We put in enough work at our jobs. People there get to tell us how to do things. In video games? Oh hell no.
---
Quests? I‚Äôm still wandering around opening new locations on my map üòú
---
Nice. May not include anything new and cool, but definitely sounds \*great\* to tool up the combat mechanics.
---
No, but you can get a Scorchbeast-specific disease called The Blight which reduces your SPECIAL stats by 1.
---
What‚Äôs stopping that?...
---
You can try getting the X-01 Nuka Quantum PA paint, the T-51B Nuka Cola PA paint, misc events, side quests, making a better CAMP, daily quests.
---
Accidentally scrapped mine. Still no way to get another pair (other than buy from a player)?
---
Ah ok, that makes sense
---
The perk doesnt work in PA
---
Geez dude. I get the sentiment... but... chill, man.
---
Might be something for you u/HarambeDaddy420
---
Good price and massive appalachia poster map with locations and poi on it!
---
Reload cancelling support? Awesome, it's actually cool Bethesda is trying to be an accessory to advanced tactics like this, gotta love when a game exploit is developer encouraged!
---
Yea but you dont have to load into a building.. and if they had a secret room to make Nukashine but dont have a stash to keep their stuff.. I mean.. come on
---
No, its my CAMP and i use freeplaced foundations, no bars or metalstairs at all in this build\^\^
---
You will have to buy 'em. Or make a new character. If you're on PS4, I can try to help.
---
It happened to me too! I was shocked when I saw the missile leaving! Since then, I'm studying the best way to take a picture of it... =\]\]
---
Okay, I have to ask. Why a single line from The Raven? For the life of me, I can't figure out what this comment has to do with... any of this, but you've got 4 upvotes, so I assume I am missing something.
---
I don't understand the "lure people who hate pvp into pvp with better stuff" logic. I just don't. There should be no pvp specific awards. Period. Ever. If you like pvp go play with other people who are motivated entirely by being good at pvp. Don't force me into pvp like Destiny does. It's why I don't play it anymore.
---
Yes, this! I pinched a loaf on someones pillow last night after being locked in, with no way out but fast travel.
---
I get off at 3:30 EST Ill do it for free if that time works for you
---
Was it inside the elevater by any chance,I've had this happen a few times,have you try ed a scan repair of the game as this may fix it.
---
lol mama murmhgr hates me. Out of dozens of trash I‚Äôve got so far, only a handful is worth keeping/using, and none of them are ‚Äòtop roll‚Äô like yours. Hope you get another one soon üòÇ
---
Yeah it's not the best solution.  I say let us dig a moat.   I wonder if building in the middle of a lake would work.
---
Warm fuzzy feeling.... wait that‚Äôs Rads let me stand out in the sun for a bit brb.
---
 ty again, and you are always welcome to visit me whenever i warp into your server :P

Is was in the elevator, but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
I have a 1* bloodied power fist.  I prefer the 2* bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with 40% swing speed.
---
Nah I save them up then dump them at waroga train station.
---
Pass.  I'll only play the very minimum necessary to get whatever Plans or features you can get from it, then I'm done with it and will never play the death match crap again.
---
The thing in it that **I** cared about the least

#I cared about the least

Almost as if you weren't the only one who bought it. If you don't care, cool. I buy stuff with the intent on receiving it

I don't usually wear power armor, but for dramatic photos, yep, jet pack for the win.
---
People assume that the work that went into this mode takes away from other things they would prefer.  
---
In reality I'm not convinced it's always a zero sum deal in game development.  It's possible BR mode didn't detract from other content but really only the people managing the development of the game know for sure.
---
no you don't get bonuses doesn't matter if you're level 50 or level 300 when you restart you will be level 1 the way legendary work is there is going to be legendary perk cards that are not available to a normal player that you can get
---
That‚Äôd be perfect man thank you so much! Send us a message when you‚Äôre online :)
---
Main story quest to get s feeling for the story. Try not to skip it. Also pick a day and get your camp set up in the right location you like.
---
Don‚Äôt they all mark enemies?
---
Yur a wizard, harry!
---
Tastefully defying reality is often a necessary evil. :)
---
Selling that power fist?
---
Practical method: Assume half of the high levels will show up. If that's not enough, switch servers before you start the silo.
---
The imposter sheepsquatch event is way harder to arrange. Don't bother with that unless your team can handle the pylons by themselves. Expect maybe a third of the high-levels to show up, late, and not touch the pylons. It's understandable because you don't get enough prep time and it needs a weird build.
---
Bethesda could implement a system where you can put out a warning that you're going to do X event in roughly X minutes. Wouldn't need any arbitrary text, so they should be fine with that.
---
These work with Distant Thunder as well.
---
We would need a terrain tool to make it happen. I wish we could alter our camp's Location. I would love to make a small pond and a flat spot without any plants for my crops.
---
I accidentally clipped a very nice camp by whitesprings last night with a nuke. I thought it was far enough away form the camp (it was RIGHT beside the train station) but I wanted to make sure I also hit a specific area in the north called Safe N Clean that has a lot of flux. They were right beside the line. Well, the nuke killed half of their camp. Sorry my dude. I just needed some mass/ fluids.
---
Yeah, a is the power armor helmet was painted like [this special edition statue?](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2016/06/0jIPs7W1.jpg) What if the map was basically the 76 version of [this special edition bauble?](https://www.destructoid.com/ul/355358-that-dark-souls-iii-estus-flask-replica-is-embarrassing-junk/h2-noscale.jpg) Could you imagine if either of those special editions got the shit 76's did over one aspect of the product, to the point they actually had to send out replacements?
---
So that‚Äôs where you find them. Thanks
---
Yes they did in the video interview where they announce they're going to be doing legendary players.   it doesn't matter if you're level 50 or 550 when you restart to be legendary you will be started at level 1 no bonuses for the being a higher level. also they stated that it's going to be legendary perk cards and legendary effects that are not available to other players. since then every update that they've done and they've added a couple of New perk cards but have kept them unavailable,
---
The fight does not require multiple high levels. She can be solo'd relatively easily.
---
If I see a lot of low levels show up I skip it. The SBQ gets stronger for each player at the event. If you got a few good damage dealing players and then a bunch of less then 50 players start showing up the damage being done starts to slow. I've seen it happen too many times.
---
If I want to do SBQ I look for organized groups to join. If I see a random nuke I asses the player levels before deciding if I should waste resources attempting a losing battle.
---
...god i wish i could say yes but... ya know
---
Not really. Your turrets don't destroy your base, why would exploding vehicles? They were great in FO4, I'd place them where I had gaps in my fence, so mobs would try to go through and I'd explode them and watch bodies fly. Great fun.
---
Wait....you can lock plants?
---
Thanks for the recommendations man, I'm gonna have a look at it (:
---
Loved the first poster and you have not disappointing with the second.  Can't wait to see the rest!  Well done Rosyarus - thanks for sharing your talents!
---
Homemaker and wasteland barbie are the real endgame!
---
YOU SHUT YOUR FILTHY MOUTH
---
No, he's just a very angry person.
---
This is awesome - do you have print shop or anything?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been blessed with a couple of good handmades. It‚Äôs a shame that I haven‚Äôt tried to get the most out of them, only played a little when my perks were all in Heavy/Strength. If they allow us to rearrange, save and load perk loadouts nobody will need to build a second character.
---
Sniper in queen battles is tough when so many bullets from heavy gunners just pour in. Also does sneak perk apply to boss fights? I imagine if the bosses were aggro‚Äôd but they didn‚Äôt see you in particular, your shots should still count as sneak attack right?
---
Im noticing it now. They even made a negative remark to me.
---
If your on xbox, you don‚Äôt want that stupid thing anyways... I‚Äôll gladly take it off your hands.
---
You can "call em like u see em" and not come off as an overly-dramatic, very angry person.
---
I really want to be able to do something like this soon, but I don't think I wanna try until adjustments are made (if ever) to camp budget. I have a mighty need to decorate the insides of each little building and I'm pretty sure the limit wouldn't let me. :(
---
Bloodied sneak build is the absolute pinnacle. You'll die easier for sure. But, I literally just stand outside the buildings of Whitesprings and one-shot Ghouls as they run out daily. Even with my health at 35-40% I've gained enough extra power to beat out a normal user with a TSE gun at full health. I'm a Bloodied Gun Hybrid guy. With no Perk cards I can still pick up a Bloodied Power Fist and do 685 Damage without swapping out my rifleman cards. It's insane. I use a Bloodied Explosive Lever Action, Bloodied Gatlin Gun, Bloodied pump action, and a bloodied handmade. With my Perception Vats card I target Ghouls and Super Mutants heads and literally blow them off in one shot If I'm crouched.
---
The amount of people in this thread that are genuinely angry and pissy at the people who were upset they didn't get what they paid for is incredible. This sub likes to talk about toxic YouTubers and media outlets defaming 76 but will happily also include legitimate issues. Some of you are just as toxic as the people you're complaining about. 
---
Take a look and ask why you're angry at someone who wasn't happy with the fact they were misled about a product they bought.
---
I hope it's not JUST a PVP DLC.  There better be some PVE content or I'm going to be really fucking bored.  I'll play it exactly enough to get whatever new content/plans/recipes/whatever is available in it then I'm done with it forever.  Most people have no interest in PVP, and that's just more shit that we don't want.  We were glad to see PVP leave the Adventure servers for the most part, now they're bringing more back.
---
I love these positive encounters
---
Could be spawn problems. I remember there was a brotherhood quest that would have three bats spawn in at once and the normal enemies would keep doubling each time hey would leave the area and come back(IE opening a door loading into another area and come back). Could be that going on.
---
Did you have the flashlight on?.
---
You're right. Thanks for checking us out though! The town does encompass the entire circle though
---
No, damnit, I want total realism as I stomp around a blasted wasteland full of mutated monsters in my jetpack-equipped walking tank armor with my miniature nuke launcher!!!
---
Ok, ok...fair point. :)
---
This sounds kinda cool if they can make perks worth it.
---
Bethesda announced what they planned to do with the game. (https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) 
---
The Wild Appalachia series of updates just finished, and we'll be getting into their next set of updates, Nuclear Winter, starting with a new game mode, also named Nuclear Winter.
---
Someone dug into the game files and found audio files of some form of announcer robot or AI or something which seem to imply that the Nuclear Winter game mode may be battle royale.
---
Everyone is very upset about this.
---
(To be honest though, while I do feel the game itself could use a little more work rather than adding in another new game mode, I'm actually interested in playing it. I like battle royale.)
---
Pardon my dutch.
---
The damage boost only applies to the first shot after it switches targets.
---
The double brew station was to probably accommodate the influx of players. Now that no one checks on BIV, they could probably switch it out to something better.
---
üòÇ No im on ps4.That shovel is pretty fun and i love the sound when i hit enemys...But want know why melee perks have no effects on her
---
If that really affected it I‚Äôd be mad, but yes.
---
That's really cool, still. I wish I could come see! Alas, PC. Wonderful work.
---
SBQ, sheepsquash Imposter, and arktos all have something in common.
---
They were popular when they were new and exciting but once that wore off for most of us it comes down to time, effort, and resources spent vs reward. Here is the big surprise you may have missed those events are just not rewarding enough assuming they don't glitch out or screw you over in some unintended way.
---
However if you are really after doing them there are plenty of places for each platform to find others looking to group up. Take the random element out meet some like minded vault dwellers and have fun.
---
Biv E. Ridge is the name and drinkin's the game!
---
Guy's a shit stain.  Ignore him.
---
So I have a question for you, as you've obviously done this a fair amount of times. 
---
I thought if you had one creature still alive, you'd win the event. The other night me and another guy guarded the friendly ghoul and he was a little dinged but none the worse for wear.  3 other people were in there, they took down the alpha 3\* fog crawler.  We still failed the event. Is there something else we were supposed to do? I was so confused.
---
Start of with few quest and then do anything.  I did a lot of events at first
---
I missed out on a nifty quad cryolator with faster fire rate and AP reduction yesterday. i was on the confirmation screen when the vendor up and left. i just assumed he left because he was max on caps.
---
Loses pretty much all effect on me because it requires exploits to be where you are not supposed to. 
---
Just like hes "not sure if marsupial is enough" to reach him protected in the floating exploit base he probably never once submitted as a bug report.
---
If they intentionally gave us more reign over the map with camps it still wouldn't be "legit cool" deserving of "mad props"
---
I love these combat changes. They are really going in the right direction here. I'm REALLY REALLY hoping they do the same thing with the building mechanics.
---
Yeah, atomic shop music is on it's own, don't know if it can be even switched off
---
you are always welcome :)
---
My only objection to locked doors is that inevitably I will end up fast traveling inside a locked space and either have to waste caps to FT out or waste time trying to glitch outside with PA or interacting with objects outside. Either way, it‚Äôs not a good start for potential shoppers...
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
Stay off the adderall bro! Haha nice base
---
For sure! Even as a player who loves pvp in this game and even built my character for it, I too would be very dissapointed if nuclear winter dlc was only PvP content. 
---
I can't wait for more challenging end game pve content. Arktos pharma is a great start, but badly needs some fine tuning. I think the pve community is in good hands, don't fear :)
---
&gt; Ran up to him ready to swing my Grognak axe into his face.....instead I slapped him with my camera. Mr bear was not amused and quickly b\*tch slapped me twice and I was dead ( never noticed I was low health at the time ) 
---
And now I have to explain to my co-worker what was so funny that I'm laughing out loud...
---
Turn them around.
---
The guy's a drunk.  I'm not leaving *my* stuff at his house!
---
I disagree.  I am a huge fan who missed the special edition for FO4 so I kind of wanted to get this one to make up for it.  The helmet was cool, but the bag (which is the sort of thing that would be sold for the difference that I would have paid at the very least) was what I was looking forward to.  I was planning on actually using it to carry things I might need around.
---
I think I‚Äôm gonna try a rifle build not sure what perks to do tho
---
Okay, so why don't you put up a bunch of legendary items at low prices like that then? 
---
As I understand it, bloodied and explosive are two of the most desirable ones currently (I don't do the bloodied bit myself), so surely the items you have you could price from 50 up to a few hundred caps. Don't worry about it 'not being worth it' I guarantee you put up some items at lower prices than that then you'll have players buying them. Heck if you're on Xbox I'll come and buy some off of you.
---
Como es logico no pediria eso... pero me gustaria que pudiera asociarse un boton a ciertas drogas y curaciones sin ser favoritos o que comieras y bebieras con un solo boton segun una lista de prioridad de que comer (hay comidas con buffos especiales que es mejor reservar)).
---
Odio perder tanto tiempo buscando que comer (siempre bebo agua purificada por no complicarme, pero odio que me caduquen tantas comidas o tantos paquetes que no como y acabo vendiendo por comodidad).
---
That‚Äôs great pal you do that
---
you have the witch costume plan for sale ? Not the Hat
---
As a level 273 no thanks, done that too many times. It's just a waste of ammo now.
---
I dont intitate encryptid for that exact reason, however if it pops up I'm showing up and doing my best to win. being able to send a server wide message would be super usefull. but I'm not gonna message everyone I individually just to see if they will show up. ima just hope for the best.
---
I did that today. I feel bad. Guy was going crazy buying up stuff (thanks guy), hit max and I panicked. Lol
---
in your defense, that player would have seen the Nuke warnings and could have left the server once he realized the red circle was super close to his house
---
As my camp is also at whitesprings, it is a  factor we have to deal with!
---
Got a source for where they specifically stated levels past 50 are not rewarded?  
---
Not that I think it matters, I'm just curious ;)
---
Not well at the imposter squatch event
---
..but great for ghouls...
---
You're not my supervisor!!
---
The nude headless scorched that sometimes chase me around when the server isn't fully loaded would beg to differ
---
For me bloodied weapons lose their damage bonus, at least visually until you select it or another bloodied weapon. It'll do the proper amount of damage when you're using it :-)
---
You can get far better (than even the canvas bag) officially licensed fallout bags cheaper than this one.
---
Sure send me your PSN and I‚Äôll add you when I get on.  It‚Äôs in m vendor at 1k but im willing to negotiate.
---
Gun fu is godly.
---
I farmed it like crazy when it still dropped serum plans. But they killed that.
---
That's when I crashed mate soon worked out it was that.
---
Nope, defending your creatures from the alpha is the last step to the event. Something else must have killed your ghoul. Otherwise the event should promptly end either when all the friendly creatures are dead or when the alpha is dead. You also need at least 1 creature alive to complete the event, however the more you have left the better the rewards. Hope this helps!
---
&gt; Apparently the people who do this think about it as if the thumb stick is attached to the back of the character's head. So you move the thumb stick to the right the head swivels to look to the left, and vice versa.
---
Dude I had this thought as an epiphany as a teenager and tried to verbalize it to my friend and he thought I was a fucking stoned moron. Thank you for the validation
---
If you sheath your weapon in survival mode, you become non hostile and your health bar turns yellow. You can still attack him and do full damage. But it gets really weird near train stations. I really don't understand how this grief-proof invulnerability works. Really wish Bethesda would provide us with some in depth explanation of the mechanic. It feels so inconsistent
---
Back away from my shovel boy!!
---
Two people in the thread claiming to be the exploiter. big laffmyass
---
Aaaaaaand that's the TRUE reason why I keep playing.
---
I always forget how much the average player struggles with just getting off a nuke and then actually killing SBQ. I just nuke her as an after thought - mainly I want the violet / crimson flux in the area, and she's there, so it's like "eh, why not".
---
I have one character that is meant to be a hunter/trapper.
---
he sells hides, leather, leather goods, and rebuilt .308 rifles of all sorts.
---
I use the vendors to paint a picture of my characters. It's not a great way to make caps, but it sure is fun.
---
Just make the workshop exclusive for an hour or two. After that, anyone else can take over the workshop excusively for another two hours. If no one comes by you can keep farming until someone wants it.
---
So, for what other purpose might someone ask for this, if not for the reason I stated?
---
* Is the ability to step up the side of a 6' tall foundation Lore breaking?
---
* Does it prevent normal Camp building in some way?
---
What makes you think I'm Outraged about anything? 
---
Who is really Triggered and being Argumentative here, have you read your own comments?
---
I'm not the one who used Foul language and 13 Exclamation Points in my comment, and at 58 years old, the last thing I am is "Thin Skinned" or "Defensive" of my comments and opinions.

Ya, I just fought up a scortchbeast and his minions while shopping at a fellow vault dwellers CAMP and didn‚Äôt get any loot.
---
I‚Äôll be awaiting my award now.
---
It would make for a lot of possible trolling (and with a budget big enough I could completely enclose my camp with portable toilets! Muwahahaha!), but it would be a great way to start introducing the idea of factions. Small groups of '76ers start banding together and building small settlements...you could put a cap on the number of players in each group...but as a new player joins the budget expands a little (maybe it expands less with each new player so by the time the 5th player joins you can just add a small expansion for their quarters etc.) this way some players would be banding together in certain areas and you would effectively have a player community growing up. 
---
For all the other players it would be like visiting other small towns...heck it would be like visiting Bartertown...Oh I so want to build Bartertown now....
---
Have all CAMP doors close right after you leave the door frame. 
---
 Want to keep them open all the time?  Door stops.  Put them on your door in the lock menu.  Hell even have atom shop items for different door stops.  Like a bucket or a small stepping stool or a rubber stop.
---
No loss for me buddy, I prefer customers who are honest with themselves.
---
Sounds good, we'll hash out the details. I might not make it online tonight but tomorrow after 5pm EST. Psn: yawnbringer
---
I think the special stats should give you more bonuses tbh. Right now strength is really the only stat that really benefits you with melee damage and carry weight.
---
You smashed it, this is really cool! Adding myself to the list of other commenters who would like this in physical form...!
---
It'll be back, I'm still hoping I get another chance to buy the Red Rocket, Rocket at some point :)
---
But it's not like they decided to transition over. The "new game mode" with nuclear winter, whatever it will be, was announced months ago. Hell, it was probably at least in the planning stage since launch. If not that, they would have been working on some other new content instead
---
It's literally illegal. They advertised one thing (canvas bag) and sent another (nylon bag). If you bought a car advertised as having air conditioning but it didn't, you would pissed. Same thing here.
---
Yea fat mans need love too!
---
Thank you, Captain.
---
So basically they're prepping for battle royale
---
That's good I like people who plan, I don't care if a house is locked unless I spawn inside it. Or worse spawn in the floor. If either of those things happen I fast travel away and don't come back to buy anything.
---
Side note found a base yesterday spawned outside dude had those cutouts pointing to his vending machines... however he locked them in his house. I wonder of he has ever sold anything.
---
New songs, new songs new songs NOW
---
If any of this stuff comes out for guns without fixing melee I'm going to be tremendously disappointed and maybe it's time to stop playing what has become one of my favorite games ever. That is all.
---
That's unfortunate.
---
Not just you!
---
I did everything you did when I tried it solo last night. Cleared the bots first. Radstags were so plentiful that I easily got a lvl 3 albino DC. Not one other person showed up so no bot respawn. 
---
The problem is the DC just runs blindly all over the compound. I stop to kill a yao gaui and now its 100 ft away in the next habitat. 
---
All I could do was keep trying to catch up as it got torn apart, bit by bit.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox but thanks anyway!
---
They need to make the welcome mat/fast travel target function like it did in FO4. Then we could pop people right in front of our vendors so they don't have to go looking.  
---
I don't lock my stuff anyway (so visitors can use all of my benches, or grab some water which will refill while I am gone).  Just close the door when you're done!  :)
---
happened to me...i've been told there's NOTHING that can be done (by reddit users).......you have to start a new character and grind back up to lvl 50.  fuuuuuuuuuuck that.  fix the fucking bug.
---
The pearly peepers dont zoom as they are only to mark enemies
---
No, this game is a farming game. So you need stuff to actually farm for not just some weapons.
---
Building materials would be my first go-to. But instead of that they put shit behind moneystore.
---
They fucked the game, the sooner people realize it the sooner changes will happen.
---
Not sure why your being downvoted. Neat base
---
Usually I would agree that game development isn't a zero sum game. Usually you hear these arguments because the art department is releasing something and the game is still buggy, bit gamers get pissed because they see these resources as tied together even though they are separate teams. 
---
But in this case if they did apply a coding team to a BR mode they absolutely screwed us out of coding hours that could have, and should have been used getting all of the other things they have said were coming into the game in addition to big fixes.
---
You can even say "well its a different team of coders" but it won't change that the talent could have been applied to finishing the core product up as opposed to creating an entirely new mode.
---
Yeah, it is really depressing. Ruining all the nice things about the game.
---
WHY DID PANTS GUY KILL YOU?!
---
This is incredible!
---
&gt;sprint to cancel reload animations
---
Looks like black powder weapons are back on the menu, boys!
---
I guess you make a small garden room and just lock it.
---
No.  You have to have them in a room
---
Thx, but that kinda sux. Lvl 400 and lvl 50 get same benefits...one bonus for hitting lvl 50 will dwindle the player base IMHO.
---
Power Armor allows you to enter/exit any openings and a few walls. I spawned in an intentional prison cell before and laughed while the guy watched my warp through his walls.
---
Hundred percent agree with ya there!
---
Where's the "Is this a PS2 game?" comment guy...
---
No, but as a special bonus, you have contracted Rad Worms.
---
IMHO Start with a gun and melee weapon. Eventually you will run out of ammo and need a backup or need a silent kill. If you don‚Äôt want to spoil with the game guide, then take notes. Where you find fusion cores, building plans etc...
---
It doesn‚Äôt hurt to move your camp around, but when you find the perfect spot farming a familiar spot does help to make camp feel like a second home. Look for the archers nest cave west of 76. Or the buried shipping container S.E. Maybe it‚Äôs somewhere fun.
---
Do you know what the download size is before it unpacks?
---
Why this stupid problem hasn't been fixed with a patch? Why the fuck I need to grind another character if this one was already fucking boring.
---
I came across the opposite. Spawned at a train station with my level 30 alt, got hammered immediately by a level 100+ behind the spawn spot. I had pacifist on so whatever. The guy had a ‚Äòraider‚Äô icon so he‚Äôs most likely IQ-challenged anyways. So I proceeded to the vendor bot to sell my stuff, he just wouldn‚Äôt give up, just kept following me and pulled out a lever action and kept shooting me. It was a non-explosive version but apparently to that guy it was his prized killing tool. I got so annoyed I pulled out my level 5 TSE shotgun and shot at the wall and ground a few times, sent the garbage on the floor flying. The old guy turned around and started running away as if his bladder was gonna explode. Really showed me what kind of pussies the so-called ‚Äòraiders‚Äô are.
---
Yeah, mine had been in storage from late 90s too. Finally got some use out of them. Adding West-Tec logo on one and BoS logo on another. Time for them to be something fun.
---
Again, nobody ordered the Canvas Bag edition of the game. Everybody who ordered it ordered the Power Armour edition. Nobody bought it solely for a bag.
---
If you did, you shouldn't have access to money. You can get a better bag elsewhere for a lot cheaper.
---
Nope, the original picture with the nylon bag on specifically said it was not the final product. So, not the same thing at all. Not even close.
---
Why am I downvoted...just dont get some ppl.  I've simply played since inception, and so I'm at a very high lvl.  If they think normalizing everyone will spark interest, I believe they are making a long term mistake.
---
you are preaching to the choir.
---
There should be a wholesome FO76 sub for stuff like this. For every crappy encounter I have there are at least 10 other players who have been super fun and kind. Love this game/community.
---
I swear the drops mimic what you have in your inventory and stash. So many things come in 3's seems like.
---
It‚Äôs been 6 months, my dude. If you dropped 200$ wouldn‚Äôt you be annoyed that Bethesda hasn‚Äôt shipped anything yet?
---
A decent anti armour level action or a quad one would be nice.
---
I'm also in need of a decent sniper rifle maybe instigating or anti armour for that role with more damage aiming or resistance.
---
The very next day I came across another one while on another mission...but hid behind a tree for a while and manged to navigate around it..yet to recover from the 1st fight...
---
I have 300 in the stash and a couple dozen on me, and every time I pick one up I wonder why I even bother.
---
Bethesda - how about upping the quality of the drops, but balance it against the possibility of a pissed-off enemy combatant who's been stuck in the delivery box and is itching for a fight?  Or an occasional noisy siren / radscorpion pheromones / container of rotted meat that attracts enemies immediately?
---
Dont tell me what to do. If I want to go around watoga and collect the power armor, I'll do just that. No way in hell I'm gonna drop whatever I'm doing because some self entitled prick wants help. Ur best bet is to message players before you launch it, but dont be demanding like u are with the post, because if I got a message anywhere along the lines of this post, I'd show up just to make the fight harder for you and not do a single thing
---
Thanks folks!
---
Honestly think there's synths on these boards.
---
ü§î
---
Yeah, give us another line of options after regular locks: Unlocked, 0 Lock, 1 Lock, 2 Lock, 3 Lock, Unlocked: closing, 0 Lock: closing, etc. Just have the closing ones cost an extra spring or two.
---
Legendary power armor was datamined but the devs had yet to release anything about it.
---
95% haven't. All the drama is just here on reddit, and some on YouTube. The majority of players, even the majority of Power Armor Edition owners most likely, have never heard about this and don't know there is a problem. We are just a very loud minority of the game's players.
---
Are mutants allowed to join?
---
On xbox trying to buy the fuzzy outfit is currently bugged! Anyone else experience this?
---
The weightless armour weighs 0.13lbs. The Ultralight mod has it's own weight to it, and when you attach the mod you add it's weight to the legendary armour. The leg is still weightless, and the mod you attached still keeps it's weight
---
This is all well and good until I press E and drink water instead of looting sludge.
---
Yongyea who got the collectors addition free bitched about the canvas bag and in all of his recent videos he literally has the helmet from the collectors addition sitting in a self behind him
---
i see that makes sense. so im better off using something else

Personally my goal is doing all the challenges. I track a bunch and off I go squirreling between them and getting distracted by other things in between.

Personally I hope bethesda goes into the real furniture market at this point.

Free atomic shop item with purchase!

Yes, I want to see more :)

I like to leave the front and back doors of my bar open to let the sun in but the option would be nice because it annoys me when the side door to the living room area is left open. I considered locking it but apparently even though it's a redundant door pEoPle dOn'T LiKe tHat.

Yup I'm not the owner, I just gave my idea on how I'd start building up there.

Winter is coming...

Nuclear winter!

I've encountered 3 outside of free range and all shere around that spot. It feels like a high spawn point for it.
---
and while they're at it maybe give us the option to repair that flash fermenter for re-use using high INT or some rare materials.
---
I still do.  I have 24 of 26 recipes.
---
I've read about this bug but have not experienced it. Im on PS4.
---
Damn, butthurt trekkies are busy downvoting ü§£
---
I think they shipped everything aside from a bit of worthless, meaningless packaging.
---
shiny things are nice but I wish bug fixes and balance were higher priorities..
---
maybe try moving the coins to a new character, then buy the outfit and trade it back to your primary.
---
I meant the canvas bag. Not the shitty nylon one.
---
what finish the whole quest chain in 1 sitting?
---
Not a chance with RL in the way.
---
Wouldn't that just be delightful?
---
That is pretty cool, I want to see more pics of it
---
Fantastic.
---
Because BR mode is tired genre that needs to die. And Bethesda needs more PVE stuff, not PVP.
---
Good one.
---
Lol I want one for my collection! I‚Äôd really like to get my hands on a bloodied with swing speed and +1 strength but unfortunately they are being sold for about 1 human soul. So I‚Äôm going to have to start trying for melee weapons I suppose.
---
I'm on PC and the only mate I have who plays is ps4 üòï I got my bloke to buy it but he didnt really get into it so just use his account to pass hold extra stuff I'll sell later lol

Patiently waiting for more info about Wastelanders DLC.gif

Instigating fast firing 90% weight reduced paddle ball FTW!

Binoculars are very helpful for my melee build character to hit its target, esp the flying ones!!

---
A bit grindy?? Lol. That‚Äôs an understatement. These badges are going to take me months, and that‚Äôs for the ones that aren‚Äôt bugged. 
---
Well I‚Äôm glad that my question sparked the convo. Once I got like 1 badge I realized that the mods for the backpack are for possum only when I found the vending machine. I was just glad to get the backpack so far.
---
This is me! I work in a golf club usually have 6-8hrs out of a 12hr shift doing nothing but daydream about my camp my armor i get to do a lot of pre planning which has helped my character build a lot.
---
it‚Äôll always do that if the blueprint came from moving the camp and wasnt made manually, i‚Äôve had countless camps that i would‚Äôve wanted to keep but move somewhere else but they never fit into the manual blueprints and the ones from moving have never worked
---
will targeting reticles be visible while in Chameleon mode &amp; using a weapon down the sights, also?
---
it's been a pain point that i have a reflex circle (or dot) but when in Chameleon mode the entire weapon becomes invisible including the circle/dot, ruining your ability to target with sights (don't punish me and make me put a scope on everything). i assume the same happens with bare iron sights.
---
Lol that drives me insane, dude has to take his sweet time taking a sip or you loot the mole rat too fast you become overencombered. Power armor helps with the sipp problem tho.
---
Same here
---
They're both meaningless and worthless. It's JUST a bag.
---
Hey there, lvl 302 here..
---
I have been using the fat man, missle launcher, and auto grenade launcher since I found them. I have upgraded over time and now I have a bloodied fatman, a two shot fatman, 2 separate 2 shot missle launchers, a bloodied auto grenade launcher, and a 2 shot auto grenade launcher. To make these weapons effective, it will be important to Max out demolition expert which requires 5 points in intelligence. I also recommend the bear arms and ordinance express perks which allow me to carry all of the weapons I mentioned along with the heavy ammo.
---
My two shot missle launchers show 1072 paper damage ,which recently was more than enough to stop a level 156 in his tracks while he was wielding power armor and some crazy tse Gatling plasma. Missle launchers , or any of these weapons for that matter will NOT be effective against non power armor players due to the dense chest mod most people run around with. 
---
My suggestion is keep an eye out for legendary versions of these explosive weapons, one shotting mutants with missle launchers and obliterating hordes of glowing ghouls with grenade launchers is certainly possible.
---
To me it happened the other way around. Fast traveled to Harper's Ferry to do an Enclave event and a level 30 was there doing the event as well (I am level 133). I didn't evacuate fast enough and was downed by the orbital strikes. This level 30 runs in with orbital strikes still coming down and revives me. He could have let me die and taken all my junk but was kind enough to revive me risking getting downed as well. Afterwards I thanked him with emotes and dropped 20 Stimpacks as a thanks.
---
9h akeightz thank u very much :)
---
Regardless if it's just 2 or not. They would have avoided the mess if they where just honest about the marketing material prior to release. 
---
Bethesda did fuck up on this issue no matter how many people bought this edition of the game.
---
Because FO76 was billed as "Lets Rebuild America Together".  
---
There is a significant lack of any rebuilding or togetherness.
---
Rebuilding is currently limited to your CAMP and Workshops.  Workshops do not persist nor offer a Workshop Blueprint to restore it next time you server hop.  CAMPs de-confliction radius is so high you cannot setup multiple players together to form a community.
---
Togetherness is lacking Text Chat, LFG, automated group finding, etc.  We all cluster together for Queen and Encrpytid if we notice the tiny notification.  But I wager most of us are solo playing even at those events where we communicate via charades.
---
The development effort targeted at ***getting vault dwellers to kill each other*** appears to exceed that allotted to getting us to work together.
---
True. It is just a bag. But people paid money for it. They deserve to get the item they paid for. It‚Äôs really just a matter of principle at this point.
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware of any video interview, if you have a link, I‚Äôm definitely interested in seeing it. All I was aware of was an ITV where they said legendary players would be a thing, but really provided no details beyond it being some sort of reset with new perks/abilities. 
---
I can‚Äôt see them just kicking people back to a conventional level 1 with the only benefits being extra perk choices. There has to be more to it than that.
---
This is the final boss on the Playtime daily FYI. "Survive your playdate."
---
Wasn't it yesterday that You Tubers were talking about the bags again?
---
Yea that‚Äôs fine, we have a bunch of members including myself who use mutations. üëç however if you participate in our RP channels we ask that everyone refrain from mentioning them as it‚Äôs kinda immersion breaking when someone is like 
---
‚ÄúI leap over a building with my marsupial mutation‚Äù üòÇ
---
So yea I you use mutations in game that‚Äôs fine as most all of us do. But using them in RP is a nono
---
Well damn, time to spend the whole day rebuilding the church then
---
It's probably one tiny item IN the camp itself that's screwing it up. Most likely a wall decoration.
---
Nice. VATS closing instantly on kill will be huge for me. I have to run Gun-fu in my melee build because that delay makes VATS too clunky without it against groups of enemies.
---
If you're going to lock your doors though please make sure you put your electical switches that run ALL your stuff outside in the room I'm locked in, because it's hilarious to me when I call the owner back to their camp by shutting off their vendor icon.
---
Ope, lemme just...  
---
I‚Äôve always lived in more suburban areas of NEO so I honestly had no idea that people kind of lumped WV/IN/PA as corn/soy bean farm country until fairly recently!

Check out JuiceHead on YouTube. He does a good job keeping up with the datamined info. Also try searching "datamined" on this subreddit.
---
jeebus man, let it go
---
life is too short
---
you are gonna give yourself a heart attack, you have to choose your battles more carefully
---
agreed!
---
I may make a few more mules and park them at the park just for this.
---
I will play however the fuck I want to play.
---
Maybe so.  In any event I still would contend it may not be a zero sum game because it's still possible systems built for BR can be leveraged in other game modes.  
---
Totally hypothetical here but lets just say it plays out like this:  They make an incancing system,  lobby/matchmaking system, and a leaderboard system for BR mode.  PvE crowd whinges that this takes away from PvE, and at this stage it's hard to argue against that.  
---
Then they launch the vault raids that use the instancing, matchmaking/lobby and leaderboards but it's 100% PvE and the PvE crowd is happy because the vault raids are  well done and super fun.  
---
Was all that BR development **still** a zero sum game?
---
i mean...are they smart enough to differentiate color?  maybe they all went color blind.
---
Have a bl,ss,rw one.Think im one of em üòÅ

Also the one where you have to shoot 3 animals with a syringer. none of the 3 animals register
---
Oh i‚Äôm just talking about its normal edition.
---
Yes and also nuke zones but shh.
---
Yea that‚Äôs bullshit! You can only get so many ultra cite- blah blah blah plans! I have like 15 plans in my vending machine and I can‚Äôt sell them for 200 caps!
---
I‚Äôll help you mule it if you make one. I‚Äôve been looking for one to level with. I‚Äôll provide all the resources as well. I‚Äôm on PC if this sounds good.
---
Stay drated homie.
---
yes i have the witch costume plan and the hat plan and the skeleton plan and skull mask plan
---
I have only seen this event active 2 times, 1 of which I started

This happened to me last night. I bought like 5-6 clothing items and was about to spend a whole check on a weapon and dude leaves. His house was 3-4 stairs up so when his house disappeared my little bloody build died but the person with me survived. Watched him nab all my junk and run. Got away with some gooooooood stuff. Spent a lot of caps and dude kills me in return lol
---
I accidentally ended up inside someone's locked house once because I thought I was going to spawn in a foundation and did the "the foundation is lava" dance and managed to end up inside the locked area instead of where I would have spawned... which would have been outside.
---
I still think that even in this proposal they are still spending man hours that could have been spent improving the hypothetical vault raids.
---
Hee-Hee!
---
Ugh! Why can‚Äôt people figure that out!!?? Miss the drop site and you can fight her without PA!? It‚Äôs crazy!
---
I can't believe the melee in a shooter isn't as exciting as shooting people.
---
You beat me to it lol
---
Cool that would be 8:30 Eastern time for me whats your GT
---
I agree they are teens that need to be put over a knee in real life! I wont give those shits the time of day because thats what they are after is any attention, and when you smack their asses down they dont know how to handle it and you then have to deal with it for hours and hours afterwards....I also made a new toon that is an uber melee build just to go around and smack these assholes around, but Im not so sure Im going to do a lot of that because its just not worth all of the residual that is going to come along with it.
---
FE .50 cal
---
I'll play if there's a mode with no legendary effects. Back in the early days, PvP was somewhat interesting when you had two level 15 dudes duking it out with basic, unmodded and non-legendary pump shotties and hunting rifles and pipe guns, and only the bare minimum of perks. Nowadays it's just getting oneshot by the Bloodied sniper you never saw because he's crouched in a bush *and* invisible. Having that barebones combat along with the improvements they mentioned here would be fun.
---
how much you asking for the Witch costume?
---
Yeah, ok
---
Yea I agree. It would be nice if you could message the whole server at once or something like that!
---
Absolutely - make the game better as it is, don‚Äôt spend resources adding in another mode that will have to be maintained and expanded and continue to drain resources from the type of game we all bought.

It‚Äôs about time. It‚Äôs been 6 months.

Does it happen with any other games?
---
Nah, I play mostly alone and I enjoy it (as much as this game can be enjoyed all things considered).
---
Super duper seems about the same for me.
---
Damn. Yup that‚Äôs epic good! At least for now. People are trading BE railways for that thing!
---
5 months late but:
---
Also one on top of the Red Rocket there. You'll either need Marsupial or randomly spawn on the roof from Nukashine.
---
Nobody paid *for* the bag. Not one person was swayed to buy this edition because of the bag that wouldn't have bought it otherwise. It was never anything but a bit of packaging which the helmet came packaged in. I feel like I can say with certainty that 99.9% of the people who are complaining about the lack of cAnVaS bAg are people who never bought it in the first place and just want something to disingenuously complain about.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre looking for weed.
---
I don't use explosive vents cause I'm always too heavy. The perk for fusion cores does still make a difference, I have a lvl 25 I built a set of t-45 with the jet pack and she doesn't have the perk yet it's crazy how much it drops.
---
Its 15-20 bucks on Ebay.  Dont like it sell it and loose a few dollars.
---
We need more songs like around 100
---
Just block them after you're done and you'll never have to deal with them again.
---
Unless they offer a subscription service that cuts them a slice of the pie too I agree. I think there are enough of us who want more music in the game to cover the costs though
---
Soooooo how will they know who to ship them to? I have the Power Armor edition and would like to get a REAL canvas bag.
---
You'll be fine.
---
I play solo 99% of the time, been playing since launch. You might enjoy a Sneaky Stealth Sniper  build too.
---
Lol was it me? Yesterday I logged into my account that I havent touched since november, the first day i played. I decided I'd try survival because of the XP boost thinking i wouldn't see much of anyone. I spawned at the overseers camp and got blasted.
---
I guess people must be getting bored with this game so they're deciding to be jerks because I never had these issues before.
---
I just purchased this game a few days ago and now I am level 13. I was fearful of how I would regret buying this game. I really enjoy the game and I haven‚Äôt encountered any bugs or game breaking glitches like everyone complained about at release. Bethesda has worked hard on this game and they will continue to fix bugs and add new content.
---
Like the "The culling"... I'd actually nut.
---
Been looking for one of those... the purveyor isn't cooperating.
---
Man, you're probably so fun at parties.
---
For sure, and that‚Äôs all that I‚Äôm hoping is that there‚Äôs plenty of PvE stuff to balance it out. That was the great thing about Wild Appalachia was just how balanced it was. So history would suggest a repeat of that, but the update cycle is specifically named after the new mode, while Wild Appalachia wasn‚Äôt named around Survival. But like some have said, maybe it‚Äôll be PvP in summer and PvE in the Fall with Wastelanders, but dammit I want more to play before then lol.
---
I believe they capped the buff she gets with players quantity.  It‚Äôs not awful anymore... I haven‚Äôt had one get away in weeks.
---
Ill be on in 5 minutes.. 00huntr00
---
join on me.. ill be in the stream behind flatwoods...
---
I always play solo and have a blast.
---
I do join world events like Encryptid, Fasnacht, Arktos, Scorchbeast Queen/Nuke zones etc...
---
I just flash an emote or 2 and get on with my business.
---
It is an almost entirely toxic free gaming community in game.
---
You can always watch some youtubers that play solo or give it a whirl if a trial becomes available. 
---
But given that the game is for the long haul you don't have to pressure yourself into anything immediately.
---
I play on xbox. What I did was create a playlist of all the songs I like on spotify and then have it running on the background while I play. This say it only has songs I love.
---
Probably because so much is broken still. It‚Äôd be like a restaurant that has a rat infestation announcing they‚Äôre adding to their menu.
---
Nearing 600 hours, probably 15 minutes of multiplayer accounted for in that figure. Can easily go either way.
---
Your most likely to find others if you join in on events. In my experience people have been ace, very proper behavior (on PC btw).
---
Ahh I've dated myself. All my SBQ time was mostly months ago bow its occasional because I still run on that assumption. However still may be safe to say if 7 players show up and 3-4 of them are under level 50 they are not contributing enough damage to the fight.
---
I‚Äôm curious to see if you can not put 500 hours in it.
---
8000 plastic for 16000 caps...I died about 20 minutes and lost it all without crafting from it.
---
Big mistake to normalize virtually everyone...if I'm dropping hundreds of levels and a lvl 51 and I are essentially equal...they must think their content is so great, that players will continue. A fair legendary player system would have reinvigorated many long term players. Sad, that would have been awesome like player bosses that you could team up to beat.
---
 "Show Damage Numbers" So much YESSSSS
---
This is a great list of ideas and round-up of feedback from other players!
---
Some notes on here,
---
\- Server stability, along with game stability and performance, is some of our top priorities and we work hard to make improvements whenever possible. Please continue feedback with us on those aspects of the game and we will work to address it!
---
\- We hear all the feedback on enemies and difficulty scaling. With new events like Arktos Pharma and Imposter Sheepsquatch, we hope to continue to deliver a variety of events in the future, some that are tuned for lower-level players, and others that are geared for players above level 50 so that players of all levels can enjoy new events. Keep an eye out for the new vaults opening that we showed off on our roadmap [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019).
---
\- The QOL and CAMP suggestions are pretty on-par with what we see requested from players. Rest assured that while we work on the new content described in our roadmap that we also evaluate requests and feedback like this for the future. Keep those suggestions coming! 
---
\- On a side note for events, we are still evaluating different ways to address event timers for the map. Keep an eye out on our Known Issues and Feedback list [here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en).
---
Thanks again for all the suggestions and comments. We continue to read the reddit and forum posts, and are excited to share with you what's coming at our E3 presentation on Sunday!
---
I unfortunately dont have much feedback on power armor past needing a knuckles mod. 
---
For perks, I'd recommend Iron Fist. The Talons mutation will also help. Strength, strength, strength.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the shortcut to the mistress of mysteries area under the manor

Unarmed weapons don't work when inside power armor. You would have to use one of the unarmed punching attack power armor mods, though I don't think they're probably all that good. In terms of perks Ironfist would be a must. A high strength stat would also be nice.
---
Twisted muscles and talons mutations would work really well too.
---
Thx üòä üëç
---
You can build iron fist and mod the power armor to have either the rusty knuckles or tesla arm mods. Talons and twisted muscles serums would be good. I'm not sure what kind of damage you would be doing though. You can run radicool and other perk cards in endurance to boost strength above 15. Motion Assist Servos will give you +2 strength.

I planned on just using the unarmed power armor mod. It was fun in Fo4, so Im hoping its just as fun in this game
---
It's quest related. I won't spoil it for you.
---
Guess so...
---
Oh. Damn, I thought I was on to something...
---
Yeah, I kind of already got it spoiled...
---
Same. I genuinely want to know how much damage Level 38 me is actually doing to the Scorchbeast Queen compared to the Level 100+ Juggernauts around me.
---
Broke a shotgun n a sniper rifle n I was using whatever I had at that moment...
---
It‚Äôs possible lol. It happened on teusday afternoon
---
I saw.
---
have fun.

(waits till the OP asks about the Outhouses later on...)
---
Probably not but upvote cuz that's amazing
---
Will post more later
---
Having a hard time remembering what my most expensive purchase with caps has, but can say one of my favorites was finding a 2* max lvl furious shovel for 500 caps. I just wantes to have a legendary shovel so I bought it xD.
---
MY MAN! You rock dude!
---
I hope so too, sounds like it would be fun
---
How about separate ADS and hip-fire sensitivity settings?
---
Hi. Socialist here. It's more like "if you like sidewalks, libraries, roads, police protection, etc., you're into socialism." I'm sure you were mocking people less intelligent informed, though, and any impression that you don't have the faintest idea what socialism is was fully intended for comedic effect.
---
Why not just hit up Morgantown Highschool and AVR?
---
Well in my machine  I do 600 on the costume and 500 on the hats but I will give you reddit discount and do 400 for the costume but I'll sell it to u so I dont lose the 10% if that sound good
---
Outhouses?
---
Yup.
---
Ahh, yeah pretty sure that'd be a ToS violation.
---
I‚Äôm definitely down for the fabled Kingdom of the Mole Miners.
---
Is it part of the same quest?
---
if you got all 9 coins from all 5 characters daily it would only take about 10 days
---
Nope. Later on.
---
In that regard, sure.  I‚Äôve had better luck with participation at the SBQ than other events like Aktos or Encryptid.  So much so that I‚Äôve finally invested in a prime receiver.  Never felt the need to craft the ammo before because it seemed hit or miss.
---
Apparently there's a way to make an honest to gosh floating base these days too. If I can figure that out it'll really enhance my tactical stealth action
---
And gt is tanaas
---
I always show people around my base if i can emote them to follow me, and I usually throw a bunch of purified water their way too. I just enjoy having others check out my camp.
---
Mmm.I put few posts and ppl just not interested.Maybe they want screenshoot and dnt believe me
---
Yep and plenty of people are using the pads / mats as switches.
---
My current character is a bolt action no scopes no legendaries Hunter, which I recently broke just because I found two pieces of weightless leather armor. But only vanilla weapons. It's certainly more difficult, but still alot of fun without real legendaries. I wanted to do a full Endurance build, but I dunno how fun it'll be.
---
Thats awesome see you then thanks My GT is Waynestaton
---
There will be bugfixes coming with the patch, this article is just about  new gameplay adjustments.
---
We were both hitting each other with our weapons and neither of us was doing damage. Until suddenly he could do damage but i could not. This took place at moth man museum nowhere near a train station.
---
I bought a set of The Fixer plans for 6K caps. I planned to sell them modded with all the best attachments but two weeks later and I've forgotten to craft one to put in the machine yet.
---
I would run a pure ninja build if throwing weapons were really perked.
---
I don‚Äôt know how you managed to sit through more than 10 hours in this game.
---
The two shot missile launcher does actually shoot two missiles, it just doesn't seem like it if you've acquired a Target and locked on to them already. Try and shoot them straight up to see the spread of 2 missiles. This is the same with the auto grenade launcher as well.
---
TSE Poolcue. It's like having 2 grenades on a stick.
---
I second this. I would love it if they would give us some tools to play with. 
---
For example i would like to have something like the vending machine but inverted so that i can set up "quests" for other players. Like "Bring me 20 loose screws and i pay you 500caps" 
---
And more Faction stuff! I want to build a faction with other players! Rebuild the Brotherhood, capture and control land or workshops etc. etc.
---
The armor of power armor vs armor of ‚Äúarmor‚Äù is not the same. Power armor is for heavy gunners and melee tank builds that‚Äôs it.
---
I don't believe you. Every player I have met in game on XBox has been a cunt. Locked doors or not.
---
So if i Join survival and i find some cool stuff or if a mob destroys some of my camp if i hop back into adventure, my camp will be fine and the stuff won't be  in my inventory right?  Never played survival before either
---
That‚Äôs weird! Maybe it‚Äôs just a select group of collectors and end game players.
---
In the US Gamestop was selling them for a penny. I got one and it was pretty useful for finding bobblehead spawns. Now I'm sitting on enough explosive and small guns bobbleheads to last me till the real apocalypse.

INT is pretty popular I think, because it adds to your ability to share perks. Granted this would be for players who play with friends.
---
Actually that would help me a lot. I maxed my Gun Fu on a build but I'm so used to immediately exiting out of VATS it would never have the chance to switch enemies.

I was pissed off yesterday. I spent 3 hours building a camp from scratch, then 1 hour filling my vending machines.. i have a ton of inventory, and the vending machines glitch out when I load them (I have to add one thing, completely close vending, reopen, add, close, repeat for 120 items). I started venturing around, and came a cross a nicer place to settle down.. same exact "needs support" error message. The CAMP was green when I tried to place it, but wouldn't place. I tried to cancel out of build mode, server hop, power off the xbox, but nothing worked.. I had to break the damn CAMP down to individual pieces. I don;t have it in me right now to spend the time to reload the vending, even if I only build a basic platform for them.
---
A large amount of people were but when they put in their requests Bethesdas shitty website doxxed them all. They should be investigated for GDPR for leaking EU addresses and card numbers, see how the suit settles up.

There was some law firm that announced they were suing Bethesda for false advertising, I think over that one damn bag
---
That flyer alone is hands down amazing, love the concept and sofar the delivery is on point. I hope this gets out there!!!!
---
A low health, unarmed build has been a ton of fun  for me. Just my two caps.
---
Let me get this straight.... You're mad that you did not receive an internet trophy?
---
Hopefully they have multiple dlc drops for the nuclear winter season.  I can't imagine all of it is going to be pvp stuff.
---
It's the game's built in method of trying to stop you gathering 800 pounds of junk, suiciding and then fast travelling while dead to a workshop (or your camp) to salvage it.
---
But yeah if you have anything that affects your carry weight this will happen pretty often because sometimes they unequip when you die, putting you over the weight limit.

**FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT ‚Äì UPCOMING COMBAT IMPROVEMENTS**
---
**PATCH 10 COMBAT IMPROVEMENTS**
---
**WHAT‚ÄôS THE DAMAGE?**
---
**KEEP YOUR WEAPONS DRAWN**
---
**TAKE AIM WITH CONFIDENCE**
---
Gatling Weapons (except Gatling Laser Guns)
---
**RUN AND GUN**
---
In addition, we‚Äôre removing the temporary reduction in look sensitivity that occurred after sprinting for players who use controllers. This should help combat on controllers feel more fluid and allow you to more easily line up a new target.
---
Finally, for those times when you need to make a hasty exit, but want to pick off one more pesky creature before you go, V.A.T.S. will now close immediately if one of your attacks scores a killing blow.
---
**FINE TUNE YOUR VIEW**
---
Thanks to feedback we‚Äôve received from many of you in the Fallout 76 community, we‚Äôre adding a couple of new settings to the Game Options Menu that will help you better customize how you view the world. First, we‚Äôre implementing support that will allow you to invert X-axis input. Next, whether you play with a controller or a mouse, you will now be able to adjust your horizontal and vertical look sensitivity settings independently from one another.
---
We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this sneak peek at our next update for Fallout 76. Keep an eye on Fallout.com to catch more details about Patch 10 as soon as they are announced.

**JOIN US FOR E3 ON SUNDAY!**
---
One more quick reminder before we head to Los Angeles for E3 2019: The fifth annual Bethesda E3 Showcase kicks off at 5:30 p.m. PT this Sunday, June 9. We hope you‚Äôll join us during the show, because we‚Äôre planning to announce more details about what we have in store for Fallout 76 throughout the rest of 2019. You can tune in live on Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Mixer, or Facebook Live. In case you‚Äôre looking for even more details about this year‚Äôs showcase, we‚Äôve wrangled everything you need to know in this article on Bethesda.net.
---
Until then, we will see you in the Wasteland.
---
Sorry the formatting was bugging me

Also, forgot Nuclear Material singles: 4-10 per

No go ahead
---
Too much beans...

Isn't the goo at West-Tek neutralized?  I think there is a computer entry somewhere in there that details how, after the bombs dropped they introduced an agent to neutralize the FEV (which in previous games was a dark green).  The toxic goo is radioactive enough to cause mutations, but no longer contains FEV (Which might explain why the liquid is a lighter greenish yellow).  I think the toxic goo pools are just left over catalyst, not the FEV itself - which would explain why the mutants cannot find 'green stuff'.
---
He is mad that Bethesda will not take time away from content development in order to unlock his meaningless trophy.
---
These changes are awesome and I didn‚Äôt expect to see them. Especially the slow sensitivity after sprinting. I‚Äôm excited
---
Create 4 characters then. You're the one who wants 100% completion status.
---
They don't stack directly on top. I've found a secret with a few things like wires, that if you spam it while green you can make some things work that turn red.
---
1st rule of Fallout CAMP building...
---
Do not move your CAMP
---
2nd Rule of CAMP building...
---
DO NOT MOVE YOUR CAMP!
---
It's just a trophy man. If it really means that much to you make another character. This doesn't make the game "worthless" lol.
---
A normal missle launcher is indeed pretty weak. There is a quest reward called bunker buster which adds 20% extra damage. I was using that weapon to great effect against some griefers in power armor very early on (just weeks after the beta). They were blowing up my gfs base and I got em good, used the fat man daisycutter to kill them a couple times in the same fight. Another interesting aspect of
---
missile launchers is that they can target invisible players, unless they changed that recently.
---
Same. Sometimes you get the locked doors and trespassing signs but I enjoy it much more when people are friendly and more inviting. And have reasonable prices on vending items.
---
I use it too. Oneshotting everything without any challenge can be fun at start, but then it's just boring
---
...cd z
---
Because nothing is worse than getting something for free and complaining you didn't get  .. what you paid for?
---
Sooo i have been down voted to oblivion because if this opinion, but here we go again. Let me start by saying i have been a huge bethesda fan ever since ES: morrowind, i have literally bought anything they made up to this point without hesitation on release day. My favourite fallout would be new vegas and in close second fallout 3.
---
If you are looking for a traditional fallout game this will not satisfy your need. I personally believe this fallout game was not meant for the fallout fan base but rather a new wave of gamers. There is no story, the quests suck and are severely limited. No npcs even though they have vendor npcs. The game was rushed on release and is still so buggy my game crashes at least once every play session.
---
Do not get me wrong, they have made a lot of mechanic changes that are very exciting and fun to play with. The card perk system and mutations are a fantastic addition to the game.
---
That being said, i do not think it makes up for the lack of content and other issues this game has. I try so hard to continue to play this game because, well when i am playing with friends it is bearable. When i play alone i have nothing to do except farm legendary items and well farm anything really.  I have put about 150 hours into this game and i bought it on day 2 of release. That might seem like a lot but, since my lowest time in a bethesda game to this point was at least 500H. I think it falls short of a true fallout game.
---
I think it is time for us as a community of gamers to stop allowing companies to sell us broken and unfinished games. I get it, i spent $80 on this game and i feel disappointed just like many of us do. But we can not let our pride get in the way of telling the truth. I think this game would have benifited from them working on the game for an extra 6 to 12 months before releasing fallout 76.
---
The fact that in the latest bethesda interview Todd says the game is going well and they expected issue right out of the gate is a tall tale sign of where this industry is going. We need to stop these mistakes and sometimes down right lies are okay.
---
If you play solo, most interactions are just a quick wave or thumbs up emote then you're on you way. You can see where most players are on the map and simply avoid most of them if you'd like. Some events are really difficult to do alone, but you don't have to do them if you don't want, but generally people are either nice (even giving you cool gifts!) or indifferent to each other. I've had exactly three brief conversations with other players in game, and have only teamed up twice (for less than an hour) and I've been playing since launch.
---
No bug fixes like the fast travel map bug?
---
Why even shop at vendors when you can farm it all?
---
I can understand the frustration. But I feel like this "problem" he has is insignificant to a myriad of others. But hell, if this is the worst problem in  this dudes life, then my hats off to him.
---
I think i know what happend. When they list the rewards it says only "Power Armor Chassis" but when you place it, it has the armor on it so maybe you still have it somewhere?
---
Hate to break this to you, but you have like 6 months to send a ticket to Bethesda to ask for a replacement. The contact form had a thing just for bag replacement. Deadline got extended multiple times but requests ended at the beginning of May.
---
I've never physically seen one yet,but if it uses stim super to craft, you can't expect the effect of a normal stimpak.
---
...for someone colourblind there would be no difference...
---
Even better than that are the ones who leave V9 in the clear, but *just barely*, so there's no room to move if the SBQ is south of the fence.  You're aware that you should leave V9 in the clear, but for some reason, you want to push it as close to the edge as possible?
---
I guess maybe it's the flux.
---
I've been working on two camps for awhile now, not finished yet but hopefully will be soon. Do you guys accept multiple entries?
---
Damn. I wanted a nice, metal stair tower.
---
meh it probably what going to happen anyway
---
Doom
---
It should only be absurd to you in the fact that Bethesda gave a description that wasn't what they were actually giving out. The people that bought it weren't the ones that fucked up. They only said "uhhhhhh this isn't what I paid for." Then Bethesda tried to fix it by giving away a paltry sum of Atoms.
---
Not me but the best one ive ever seen is the guy who thought "long pew" was a gun. Still cracks me up thinkin about it
---
I overheard Graham the super mutant merchant ranting about meats. He asked Shally the MooMoo if he forgot anything. He then said, "Oh right! And green stuff for MooMoo!" 
---
I think Appalachian super mutants are vegetarians.
---
Camp destruction is gone tho, everyone has to play nice now
---
I could be getting 54 coins, as I'd be using 5 mules + main.
---
I can hear the jingling of caps, now...
---
Fatalities aren't a melee system
---
Hoping it doesn't ruin gun fu perk
---
As long as the HOA has performed an eval on each CAMP, there is no limit on how many a wastelander can enter.
---
Sweet! Thanks
---
Buy it!
---
No floating CAMP better win
---
Those are wonderful shots, thanks for taking the time to share them!  The brilliant color vs. lack-of-color in this game can be quite striking...we don't even notice it during game play.
---
For detail, the Ultra settings far exceed the High settings I play on.  You've convinced me to play with settings, at least for photos.
---
Yeah, I find that the set are EXCELLENT for the "Distant Thunder" quest.  I crouch to hide as soon as getting there, pop up the Pearly Peepers and zoom to max and tag all the scorched, slink back and wait for the fireworks while I chug a Nuka Cola and collect my reward.
---
There are already NPCs in the game. There are even two more games within the game that have a slew of human NPCs.
---
NPC stands for Non-Player Character. There are a ton of these.
---
You don't want NPCs (we already have them) you want something else.
---
Yes they do.  Hit Q.
---
Are you saying the game was rigged from the start?
---
Our HOA By-Laws directly forbid this: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6sx8aVU8AACY0j?format=jpg&amp;name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6sx8aVU8AACY0j?format=jpg&amp;name=small)
---
Asked me yesterday i would say yes... But then i saw my new neighbour just a moment ago - nope...
---
Yes they can be stacked.  
---
It requires using the Metal I-Beam post in the stairs section.  Place stairs, I-Beam on top, 2nd set of stairs.
---
There are YouTube videos demonstrating it if that is not clear.
---
Hey, she's lonely, you're lonely.  It's the apocalypse.  Let it happen.
---
The jealousy is REAL lol dam
---
Lever action is my favorite. I used a 1* vampire for a while
---
We also need faction PvP like Elder Scrolls Online has. A new PVP map with faction controlled zones. They also need to figure out a way to make PvP combat work for melee builds. I‚Äôm sick of getting one shotted no mater what armor or perk cards I‚Äôm using.
---
He literally released a video two days ago saying Bethesda where are our canvas bag
---
Try a lever, these are much better that I anticipated but still don't match an equivalent handmade.
---
thats milk of human kindness for ya
---
Still better than in fo76
---
*Furiously scans for mention of keyword fixes*
---
Sarcasm aside - this is a good step in the right direction
---
Aye do the survival challenge for this week. You get a maxed 3 star bloodied deathclaw weapon called unstoppable monster
---
I think it will be a combo meal of both pbe and pvp, just the battle royal posts have flooded reddit making it seem like it's all there could possibly be(which may help publicity by putting expectations extreamly low haha)
---
Nope don't ever sit for more than 1 hr in any session.
---
Anyway completing in 1 go isn't a fix is it?
---
Come on Bethesda, enough with Atom shop fluff and fix the bugs, not like this is a new release now.
---
Thank you for the very on-topic response.
---
Guess I should have read more into it. Nice!
---
Sorry that‚Äôs the only way I know to get past it. Good luck!
---
lol no!
---
my camp is just the C.A.M.P. that I move around as a free spawn point..
---
I think I could take shop of the year. I‚Äôm on PS4, how do I enter?
---
oooh. Nice. I'll give this a shot. Thank you.
---
Store all junk and keep only bare necessities of aide
---
Lever is pretty much the only thing that can really compare as far as rifles go.  I was using a furious handmade until I got an armor piercing furious lever action which I've been using ever since.  Levers are pretty accurate, have good damage and if you can finish off a single enemy in a few shots you can generally keep enough bullets loaded to stay out of trouble.  You'll constantly be reloading but that's part of a lever action's charm.
---
And for you calling f76 shooter. You probably never played og parts, or even skyrim
---
Me too. I've tried tons of combinations and nothing wants to be simple.
---
The bloodied fat man I have shows ~2700 paper damage, that's a very specific legendary weapon and build though.
---
I've modified my TS fat man with the mirv launcher, this creates 8 tiny mini nukes that each do ? damage, couple that with grenadier for a larger explosive radius and it's magnificent.
---
Yeah, it's really dumb.  Would be nice if they roll this into patch 10 coming up but we'll have to see.
---
Check our Twitter page, all details on pinned post. This is our "CAMP EVALATHON" weekend, so we could def fit an eval in for you. @HOAWasteland
---
Two shot breakes twice as fast you gotta remember that. Back when you were literally shooting just straight another bullet and not 20% of base damage it was well worth it. Really its the 3 big rifles Handmade, Lever and Gauss. Sadly the rifles aren‚Äôt balanced. Lever is a straight upgrade from combat and handmade is an upgrade from the assault. They really do need to rebalance them.
---
Handmade has superior dps compared to other rifles plus insanely high capacity drum mag
---
This differs from my comments so I will have to try this eventually.
---
I'm currently apart of the BOS.  I ran into some brotherhood of steel guys while taking workshops one day, they invited me to discord, hooked me up with some BOS power armor and now boom, I'm apart of the BOS where I deliver justice with my big guns.
---
Maybe they patched that glitch because I just tried it and it didn't work.
---
It's charisma that lets you share perks, not int.
---
Sure, not a problem at all. Glad you like it!
---
This is a Bethesda game so I always temper my expectations. Just curious as to how well the thing works both on an individual and team basis since it is clearly meant as a team heal device. Would be good info especially for any one who wants to play team medic.
---
I don‚Äôt have twitter unfortunately, but I might sign up later tonight just to check it out. I‚Äôm definitely interested
---
So power armor and heavy weapons should never ever be allowed to pvp? That's a really narrow view you have.
---
I have. Your primary method of combat is shooting. It's a shooter. A shooter/RPG is still a shooter.
---
Sent a friend request with a note
---
Really if you want a good rifle you either go the route of anti armor or bloodied with explosive or fire rate
---
id definitely thow in party boy and use alcohol and nukashine as effective as possible! also chems
---
In my time on this earth I have seen far more egregious offenses of false advertising than this. 
---
If getting a bag made out of Nylon instead of canvas gets you that worked up I don't want to even imagine what you would do when ordering something that never even arrives at all, or where the company goes out of business and dissapears when your product is still under warranty.
---
How about a game that just shuts its servers off shortly after a botched release? 
---
I mean there are so many things worse than this that didn't receive half of the ire thrown at bethesda over the bag and it is ridiculous.
---
Get some friends and fast travel to them or bases. Randos work just as good.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs just a way for people to be dicks on a PvE server when a lot of people run pacifist so they can‚Äôt just bait you. It‚Äôs people who are too scared about playing in survival but want to act like a big shot against lower levels.
---
Nope, that's pretty much it.
---
I claimed a workshop and had a guy show up in his underwear, jumping around and then blasted me with his tse shotgun. 
---
When I respawned they didn't take the workshop so I sent back to collect material only for him to reappear and blast me again. 
---
They're bored and can't cut it in survival. Griefing is the new endgame content ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Mole miners don't count as people.
---
This is not a game like wow where your questing in areas. There are like 6 mains big quests that honestly should be done well after 50. Just wanted and explore.
---
Isn't it like half price or below by now? It's current state is definitely worth a look.
---
Lever for the win. I use my lever for sneaky sniping. Handmade tse for close and loud
---
Yeah hopefully, and since that was what they did with Wild Appalachia it would seem that could be the case, but the thing that gives me pause is that the Nuclear Winter updates are named after the Nuclear Winter game mode, so that tells me that it is the main focus of the updates.
---
hi its FritoZ
---
I have 3 characters who have bases at whitesprings train station, one has a giant maze if that helps
---
Odds are, he just wanted the 30 caps for killing you, all your junk, and the hope that you would contest it, for more caps. 
---
Also, he's a complete tool for picking on a much lower level player, but ""RaIdErs""...
---
Scribes have informed me that unfortunately on consoles atm you can not get it yet
---
My dream is less bulletsponging bosses, so we can actualy use whatever type of weapon, not only meta.
---
Great question, I would love to hear a response from Bethesda about some of of these grey area items.
---
primary method? Only time melee player shoots is when you have to cripple scorchbeast wings. Even then you can just wait for landing. Shooting is optional. It's not a shooter. PS you can complete fallout 1 and 2 without any single shot. just saying
---
Thanks. I will try  to maintain the singular color scheme. I was thinking to maybe use two colors for the mire and the cranberry bog, green-red for the first as the other is clearly more red-green. Joking aside, i do have to think on those two a bit. Guess it's Toxic Valley for the next one then.
---
Couldn't see the note on the PS app, but I accepted.
---
You can scrap it and get the plan. It's not legit as far I know. The only way to get one is from someone else who has one or the dev room. They weren't supposed to exist but someone got one, scrapped it, learned the plan, mass produced it, sold it to a bunch of people, and the cycle continued to where it's now so rare anymore.
---
None are legit. All are dupes or acquired from the dev room.
---
This. 100% this.
---
14 year old Jimmy can't afford a new game, and sucks at Fortnite‚Ä¶ so this is how he gets his kicks.
---
Your HOA appreciates the kind words.
---
There will be in some time. Haven't got the time and knowhow yet to set it up.
---
Believe in yourself.
---
The game was bad from the start. What they're adding now is stuff no one needs.
---
Now see, that shirt is just fine. A $15-$20 t-shirt, looks classy, not breaking anyone's wallet. Far better than that jacket.
---
Thanks for the love, jamitch83. We've got over 1000 active members in the HOA, and all of them are serious about CAMP building!
---
RIP, so there's some things on pc that aren't on consoles...
---
Nah its something people do to be dicks. I had the munitions factory once and I saw a level 44 come up but not approach me then he ran off and crouched to disapear from the map. Then his 2 buddies warped to him and the one being lvl 132 capped it from me then I had a firing swuad on me. Luckily My handmade is anti armor explosive and I hopped in my t51 so they all died in like 2-3 shots. They ten said I was cheating and finally killed me after the 4th try. Its just a thing people do to be mean.
---
Whats the reward this week?
---
We do what we must because we can. :)
---
He killed you purely to kill someone who wouldn‚Äôt be really fighting back. Same reason sickos beat puppies really
---
I'm sure that was the plan.... until the bombs dropped. I don't know how to tell Biv that Lewis didn't make it. Would break his metallic heart
---
Function over form, eh?
---
Look up RageChronicles on YouTube. Sandman uses X-01 with a Stealthboy very effectively in pvp. We can argue back and forth on whether or not he's a griefer yada yad, but the fact of the matter is its viable. 
---
A good example of him facing skilled players with end game gear in power armor is the munitions factory war that recently went up.
---
I'd argue that we also need more real end game stuff to do. Raids. Real raids that are challenging.
---
The downvoting it pretty tasteless here.
---
It‚Äôs a legitimate criticism to want a bit more information based on how vague the communication around it has been. 
---
While I also want display cases - I‚Äôm curious as to when the punch bowls are gonna work again. 
---
It‚Äôs kinda annoying that they legit worked only for about a week.
---
I convinced friends to get back in to try it out and the day they did - it was disabled.
---
Suffice it to say it will take a bit before I can re-convince them.
---
I know this is a Fallout sub, but in Wasteland 2 there's a tribe of people who have an entire religion based around the legend of John Henry. Great game.
---
Tones of useless plans, just so I can have nearly all of them. Hundreds of treasure maps, i was nearly bottlecap caped twice, well got 12k caps now.
---
Sure! You can use the Reddit name if you'd like. I have a site, but i guess i'll need to bump that to the top of my to-do list given the requests because it's a bit wonky... and in Dutch... that won't help either i guess.
---
I play by myself and most times playing I never run into another player.
---
I agree with this!
---
MMO style games need a currency sink in order to maintain a healthy game economy.
---
Currency/caps print themselves. You get them from quests, from enemies, from nuka colas, from stashes. There needs to be mechanics to remove them from the game.
---
Yea i knew that part. Came out of the dev room and then got mass produced. Still, someone got a response a while back saying they actually are in the game. Maybe as single items and the plan doesn't exist ? [https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg?fbclid=IwAR0nh-S2mSj3EdF91d8BIiDj9v8zjAyTAo85yJCOR3iI7qss7ZlT7TsWk6o](https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg?fbclid=IwAR0nh-S2mSj3EdF91d8BIiDj9v8zjAyTAo85yJCOR3iI7qss7ZlT7TsWk6o)
---
Yes. taking pics. Crafting camps, doijg challenges. Fartin' around. 
---
ya know... playing the game they paid for, in the way they want to play it.
---
And put a floor down without stairs
---
I think that's just Bethesda saying that so it doesn't look like a massive mistake letting people in the dev room.
---
Never leave home without it Stalker.
---
You can't delete or move them if you do the work around trick though so be careful.
---
This is the response bethesda gave a while back, which leads me to think they introduced them in game...at least on pc. Don't know about consoles...[**https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg?fbclid=IwAR0nh-S2mSj3EdF91d8BIiDj9v8zjAyTAo85yJCOR3iI7qss7ZlT7TsWk6o**](https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg?fbclid=IwAR0nh-S2mSj3EdF91d8BIiDj9v8zjAyTAo85yJCOR3iI7qss7ZlT7TsWk6o)
---
If you liked fallout 4 you will enjoy 76 with the diffrence that you see every now and then other dwellers like you instead of preston garvey. That's the biggest plus imo.
---
But honestly - beside of challenges or some few events up to now all quest, main as well as side quests are completly soloable.
---
Grab it, join us, fall in love with appalachia!
---
Thanks for the kind words. Next one will be the Toxic Valley btw.
---
I try not to be that guy . But once in a while . When I see people leave the vault . I wait for them to get to level 5 and then I initiate pvp lol kinda like saying hey welcome to fallout here‚Äôs dying right away lol . And then when they respawn I tell them to follow me and I drop some aid for them water and food and some plans usually little bundles of goodies lol
---
2500 for Red Menace, the last holotape game I didn't have.
---
Do they snap or did you?
---
;)
---
I'll do it but you need to buy me a PlayStation, online subscription, and copy of the game.
---
When you VATS a missile it fires it and the target can move and the shot misses. The targeting computer is the only way to "lock on" and you can't use that in VATS. I don't think you can do a critical hit outside of VATS. Also, covert ops would work but I've never been able to stay in stealth after I fire a missile. I can maintain stealth shooting a scorched from 50ft away with an unsilenced SMG but if I shoot a missile at a yao guai from  500ft away it knows the second it leaves the launcher.
---
Can't wait to find out how much damage my +40% bashing damage pistol with a bruising grip is doing when I bash. Right now I estimate it's hitting for like 3.
---
The outfit will unlock if you collect 200 tokens I believe, unfortunately it‚Äôs a visual bug since the beta
---
Didn't think about that one...might be true AHAHAHAH
---
Those which are crafter are neither Dupes nor from the Dev Room.
---
Whether they are 'legit' or not at this point a gray area.  Bethesda could purge all instances of them from the database if they wanted to.
---
I wish i had, but i'm going to set it up soon!
---
Well, multiple colors wouldn't be bad if you feel you need to. I just like seeing something without a ton of contrast for once because it's actually usable for something like a phone background.
---
trying to explain why gaming is a release from the day to day existence of work, family and responsibility to someone who just doesn't live that life... is like trying to explain the colour blue to a pigeon.
---
I carry a quad lever and a mutant +30 lever.  Once in a while I use my mutated handmade.    Lever is great.
---
You can beat the original Halo trilogy only ever shooting a gun a handful of times, and they are straight up shooters. Your non-argument doesn't work.
---
minus the playstation and online sub, should only cost about 10$. lol
---
This has "preparing for battle royale mode" written all over it
---
Breaker breaker, come in Earth, this is Rocket Ship 27, aliens fucked over the carbonator on engine four, I'm gonna try to refuckulate it on Juniper. Uhh, and hopefully they've got some, space weed there, over.
---
Yep. The majority of camp items seem to be more "inside" items. Some decorative foliage and would be good, and even promote outdoors-y camp styles.
---
I'm thinking i should really be making a list by now, hahaha
---
Says you, my wife seriously needed that cat topiary
---
Done!
---
I am worried a bit about that too.  I'm not sure why Bethesda is so keen on trying to implement pvp into the game. It seems the vast majority of players are more interested in pve.  Honestly the pvp would be ok but it's very unbalanced. Not to mention there are games out there that do it so much better.  
---
I'm not really understanding Bethesda's vision for survival mode and the whole pvp thing.  I think they would get many more players to start up and come back if they focused heavily on the pve content.
---
I'm lvl 267 and I run to fight her anytime I have a chance. But that's changing because the last dozen drops have been totally junk. A junkie rolling pin, a medic flamer 1 star, 2 star junk armor. I'm not one to complain about drops but I'm in a real rut with the sbq and can't justify burning 5k rounds of .50 Cal only to get a garbage drop and 3 hunks of flux.
---
Have to admit i was also a bit skeptical a few months ago before buying it - never regret it since (except a few moment were challenges drive me crazy lol)
---
Omg I'm thrilled. This might be the first 3D fallout that has actual decent first person controls. I mean they weren't that bad but certainly not up to standard of regular first person shooters. 
---
Especially interupting reload animation when you want to run was badly needed.
---
I hope it also counts for weapon switch though.
---
Maybe it would be cool if this change came with level even.
---
If we now still get the option to rebind all controls on pc, I can die a happy wastelander.
---
Thank you! Do you have a twitter and instagram we can credit or any other social?
---
Thanks dude
---
I don't accept rando requests myself. Not a bad suggestion though - thank you!
---
Note, buying it trading for the hide doesn't count. Same as magazines.
---
You have to find it I'm the world.
---
Im developing my unarmed build atm. I can see how maining it would be dull, I hop onto my heavy weapons or vats rifle builds to break things up. Melee definitely needs more variety in animations and weapon types /customisations.
---
All of those are quantifiable things to be mad about. I didn't purchase it. I don't give a shit either way. I only said "not getting something you paid for is not a knee jerk reaction." Simply put, say what you mean, and mean what you say.
---
Thanks because their site is blocked here and I wanted to read it like it was on the site.
---
I understand this completely :)
---
I am saying that the costs are a wee bit high at present, if they want us to jump about shopping with each other :)
---
You must fear for your life every time you use it!
---
That‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs asking
---
Done! Can't wait to see the results.
---
Always a pleasure mate! Hope to see ya soon - got a perfect preserved pie and a nice vintage nukashine waiting!
---
Mine is for the fortress, how do i join?
---
Oof. It would be a bit hard for a desktop background given the dimensions of the poster. I hope to be able of service for your second remark soon though, but just don't feel obligated.
---
Handmade has 35 rounds which is higher than most similar rifles.
---
Handmade has higher damage than most similar rifles.
---
Handmade has better recoil! This is important for automatic receiver, I can only fire about 5 to 10 shots of my radium Rifle or 10mm Smg before the recoil blows my aim way off target. But with a handmade I can literally unload all 35 rounds without much difficulty.
---
I would argue the gun is pretty average in semi mode, IMHO it's designed for automatic. It's an AK47 fanservice
---
Sadly, the reality of the situation is that killing players in workshops can yield large rewards, like massive amounts of junk drops. Especially when the target player is a low level, as low levels tend to carry more junk on them. Some people do it for the junk payout, and some do it because they are mean. 
---
There is a minority of players who workshop gank for the profits. To help deter them, crouch and sneak around when inside the workshop. You won't appear on their map, and they might not waste time travelling there just to confirm you are present since many players are smart and boogie it out once the capture/event is finished.
---
They added that only after the controversy started
---
Also can put up a looking for group post but then you will have the risk of level 15 players jumping in and just taking up space to get loot
---
You have to tag the enemy at least once to get the loot. Each person gets their own loot. if you don't hit the enemy, you don't get the loot.
---
If your not a team you must hit the legendary or enemy (SBQ) to get the loot and it's different loot for everyone
---
You each get your own loot, as in you might get this badass 3* weapon while i only get a drill....
---
If your'e in a team (not sure if proximity matters) doesn't matter if your team members hit the enemy, they will be able to loot as well.
---
If not in team, you need to at least get one hit in or else you won't be able to loot enemy.
---
&gt;Check our Twitter page, all details on pinned post. This is our "CAMP EVALATHON" weekend, so we could def fit an eval in for you. @HOAWasteland
---
Duely noted. I assumed you level up proportionally as you do the quests, I assumed wrong. What are good ways to level up? Is exploring the best way?
---
Doesn't justify melee being wanky though...
---
It was one of the items taken from the dev room, and if you scrapped one, you learned the plans, so it proliferated. The dev room was only accessible on PC, because it involved editing game files to remove a wall. So it, and several other items (paintball gun, fasnacht masks, etc..) were only available to PC players.
---
Everyone has their own, separate loot window. Given you have "tagged" the enemy at least, or are in close proximity to a teammate who kills. 
---
Your loot doesn't effect others.
---
Just had this happen with a anti armor assault from head. Game crashed after getting it now in my inventory it‚Äôs just a salvage assaultron head that has +33% in vats.
---
Sweet, i dont have twitter though.. hopefully i dont have to join to compete
---
Is Bethesda an ISO9001 company?
---
I understand the sentiment but dude, there are so many things that can go wrong and a material change is such a small one for a consumer good with no real expectation of hard use levels of quality.
---
At least we got a bag. At worst they are guilty of not offering refunds
---
So... When Can I, and almost every European gamer, try to have possum badge ??? Because now, I still have to "barreled gun" or "achieve overseer class 24" ..... Please ????
---
ALL of these are solid points! thanks for posting this!
---
That‚Äôs would be a cool idea I guess? I personally don‚Äôt like BR modes and yes the game still needs work(like every game in all honestly) but why are people getting upset? It‚Äôs a new game type and I‚Äôm sure they are also fixing current problems on the way.
---
Maybe i can use a friends twitter
---
Go out and get some fresh air!
---
Walking is **free**!!
---
No, but I stopped caring about Fallout melee 10 years ago.
---
Can't wait for it! Tried adding you but apparently it's something to do with your settings ü§î
---
I remember seeing some confirmation, it might have just been a cut and paste response, but somebody asked customer support directly, and they said it is a legitimate item...
---
I don't have Twitter but i do have an Instagram account. It's the same name as my reddit username:  [https://www.instagram.com/rosyarus/](https://www.instagram.com/rosyarus/)
---
Good stuff. Definitely need chat. I know a lot of people use the chat mod but many won't use it since it's not an official mod. Plus, not everyone has or can use a mic and accessibility is important. I don't think leveling cards is bad, but you should be able to choose the equipped level and when maxed, never get a duplicate again.
---
Hell yeah the zoomed in scope after firing my hunting rifle was always tedious
---
maybe because shooting is the main way to kill enemies? There is a lot of melee builds in fo 76 you can play comfortably without shooting. If you like pew pew, i'm glad for you, but it doesn't make this game pew pew for everyone
---
Hell yea Thanks so much, for doing it this way!
---
Yes yes it is
---
You mean like in Fallout?
---
Agreed x10
---
Well if you died to a "TSE shotgun" you have no business in a PvP ground anyway...
---
No, I wouldn't want to allocate more than one precious SPECIAL point to fast traveling.
---
Realistically, it's not a huge deal.  Heck, often killing the enemies that spawn around the CAMPs will reimburse a decent portion of that.
---
yeah i placed one of my stashed PA chassis and it had the Armour on it so now i have 2 ultracite PA sets
---
There‚Äôs an 85 round drum magazine, too, for the handmade.
---
Upvote here
---
Taking a designated PvP zone, even just for the killing, is NOT griefing.
---
Solid work!
---
What is an armor piercing furious lever?
---
For anyone looking:
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/HoaWasteland
---
I doubt that. At that point play SIMs instead.
---
MYSTERIOUS BUTTON!
---
That cleares it up a bit ! thanks. So bethesda saying they actually are in the game is...what ? damage control ? i have a link i posted in the comments under this that says they are in game and obtainable. But i'm not sure to what it's referring to, the item or the plan for it
---
I just posted a ticket asking about it on PS4 so hopefully we can get an answer soon.
---
This sounds like something I would do. Previously, I did PVP for the money. As such, I was discerning when picking targets. I only went after high level players as they gave substantial rewards. I stayed away from low level players because it was too expensive to fight them and I risked way too many caps should I fail. After the 50 cap reward cap, junk became the only way to profit off PVP. So now level does not matter, I need to kill everyone at any level in hopes they have substantial junk on them.
---
To those who think adventure PVP players are survival mode flunkies, remind yourself that it is a beta game mode and has tons issues to resolve. Also keep in mind we PVP for different reasons. Mine was profit. I lived in survival when it was double the rewards (though players would offload all caps onto a mule and try to zombie you to death).
---
Also, survival mechanics suck for stealth builds. Oh you got a single kill? Here is your exact location pin pointed on the map. Or worse, someone paid to put a literal target over your head. Try using a weightless chameleon build with a big fucking red target pointing directly at you. Those mechanics cater to eBay gear players, not me.
---
Thanks for reading and verifying some of these things. Looking forward to future patches. Let the team know they're doing a great job!
---
I found this but it's not that clear of a response. [https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg?fbclid=IwAR0nh-S2mSj3EdF91d8BIiDj9v8zjAyTAo85yJCOR3iI7qss7ZlT7TsWk6o](https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg?fbclid=IwAR0nh-S2mSj3EdF91d8BIiDj9v8zjAyTAo85yJCOR3iI7qss7ZlT7TsWk6o)
---
White Springs club house is a good place to start then you can run the loop.
---
The true hero !
---
Oh, look, a RaIdEr. Found the guy that can't cut it in survival and gets their jollies from "teaching valuable lessons to low levels"
---
There's no mr fuzzy sticker on the green one
---
Thanks for the replies everyone
---
Yeah, i know. I meant previously, though.

Scroll past the character builder, should have what you need
---
just go to any cooking station and look thru the recipes. i do corn soup as main food and drink gives AP bonus and the big 1 is cranberry relish +10 XP for an hour. then i use glowing blood packs, brain bombs stuff like that as needed.
---
Ad Victoriam soldier
---
Exactly, that‚Äôs the main thing with me as well. Instead of continuing to try and force PvP into a game that isn‚Äôt built well for it and reach out to PvP players and the normal multiplayer crowd (which honestly only further makes some of their alienated fans more bitter), they could be implementing content that appeals more to their own fans and takes advantage of more of the true strengths of the game.
---
As a lvl 344 i have killed her enough times to know NONE of the group events are worth it. I have gotten enough wood legs of the Queen
---
Ya, I agree. Say what they don't want get down voted.
---
Prove someone wrong - they down vote every post you make after that.
---
Make a statement, get corrected, apologize and thank for the correction - get down voted on every post after.
---
Kinda sad people have nothing better to do.
---
But ya, I'd like cases since they said a few weeks when the Purveyour hit.... Then nothing more.
---
I'd also like more info on the punch bowl.
---
BRING ON THE DOWN VOTES CHILDREN. üòÇ
---
Don't you have to do a certain amount of damage to the SBQ to share in the loot?
---
I agree I sort of half run rifleman/melee, I could one hit everything with my melee, but majority of the time I use guns because it‚Äôs just more fun. There‚Äôs nothing fun about standing in front of a mob one shot meleeing everything
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you and the OP - there's nothing but truth here.  I'm still playing the game but my colleague who told me 76 was coming out and is a huge fan of the series has long since stopped playing.
---
Online games are a bit different, you can't just conveniently save out and continue later while you're in the middle of an event or major quest.  Traditional Fallout fans generally don't care one iota for PvP so that's another miss but the game is in a lot better spot now with regards to PvP than in beta/initial release.
---
The scout quest line that leads up to an item all players will want is tied behind relying on other players and more and more of the daily/weekly challenges are multiplayer/interaction oriented goals.  Yes one can still generally manage without too much other player interaction but more and more the game is slowly changing to encourage more interactions.
---
I made friends and join others now, but started out as a solo player (colleague was on a different platform so playing together was not an option).  I have to admit I was somewhat concerned about getting some of the more recent additions done and having others to play with certainly helped out a lot.
---
Whoa - I recently returned to the game and this guide would've been so helpful! Had no clue it was there since the link isn't visible. I *can* see the link when I hover over the header or toggle the Community Theme off. 
---
Hopefully this will be fixed soon. I am off to check out the guide now. Thanks for sharing this!
---
This weekend is our CAMP EVALATHON, so if you're looking for the HOA to do your CAMP eval, and perhaps qualify you for the CAMPy Awards, deets here:  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8Y69ozUcAAT7Ne?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8Y69ozUcAAT7Ne?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096)

Or at  [https://mobile.twitter.com/HoaWasteland](https://mobile.twitter.com/HoaWasteland)
---
i have a few i can give you... OH wait did you say console? NOPE sorry you are fucked.....
---
I have a pure explosives build that I have inadvertently killed myself with innumerable times. Mostly with the MIRV in vats. Sometimes it seems to want to drop one of the small nukes right at your feet, even if targeting something at range.
---
In hundreds of hours, and months in here since the sub opened, I've never seen evidence of it being obtainable on consoles. The files are obviously in game, but they copied so much from FO4, that it doesn't mean much? Could be Legacy holdovers, future content, or just as likely, the Beth CSR's don't have a clue, and are just placating.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Why? They neutered literally anything bad said person could do.
---
haha, good advice!!
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
They added that after? How? By timetravel? The picture with that text in it was in my local webstore before the game even went live. Ehm... how about no? 
---
The alternative is that they did what every company always do, they add a disclaimer that what is in the picture is not the final product. Yeah, I think I'll go with reality.
---
I'm an unsociable fucker.
---
The only person like this I know in real life is my second cousin.  He is in his 30's, no job, no car, no girlfriend, lives in his grandmother's house.  And acts like he is 15.  
---
I am sure most of them are the same.
---
I‚Äôm imagining a FO76 Call of Duty and I like that.
---
All I know is I got mine from a vendor, nervously scrapped it, and now sell them for 49 caps to spread em on PC as much as one can. 
---
Probably pisses some people off, I frequently see them for 1000+ caps which seems whack as hell to me.
---
At the very least, it's not for a lack of trying. Stability definitely has improved and is probably the most difficult thing on their list considering their engine wasn't particularly designed for online play. But yeah, networking is hard and expensive so you could be right.
---
I see this asked for a lot but I think, power armor gives the best damage resistance hands down, rad resistance etc, carry weight already. If it also had legendary effects, it would just be too strong, everyone would have to use it
---
I screwed up the same way but with a carry weight increase. Thought by adding deep pocket would give me additional carry weight and Voila, lost 5 lbs carry weight
---
bloodied DCG
---
Ok i didnt know as i am on Xbox
---
rippp
---
There is also a list right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/an02c5/food_and_drink_with_additional_properties_a_list/#thing_t1_efpucy8)
---
Well that explains why no one seems to loot the legendary items. #facepalm
---
Thank you for clearing this up for me :)
---
Jesus
---
Coward attempt justifying griefing if you really wanted to pvp you hop in survival and head to one of the little train stations where the other meat heads hang around and fight them. It‚Äôs a dickhead and a sad move if you have to bully as a lvl 100+ and take a low levels workshop just because it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúPvP Zone‚Äù and you want to kill them in adventure
---
Is there PC version?  Or just Box/Station console style?
---
Pip-boy radio set to 0 volume, station always locked in: Spotify do me right.
---
For console users, I concede there being no alternative.
---
There is doors like this in Fallout 4. They close after 30 seconds I believe.
---
Lmao, good thing i'm on pc lol
---
What? Those builds(heavy weapons/tank melee) are the only two builds that directly benefit from using power armor. So if your a rifle build using power armor your gimping your self. Idk why you would use power armor for pvp since i can 1 shot you in or out. So wouldn‚Äôt you rather have 15 legendary effects vs not? Such a sentinel or assassins?
---
I really like this song, but the Live at Folsom Prison version sounds a hell of a lot better than the one you linked.
---
We are actively moving towards PC evaluations, but PC CAMPs may still be considered for a CAMPy award, all you need to do is submit a video tour to @HOAWasteland. You will be given an approval or violation and if good enough, placed into a CAMPy category. Thank you for taking the time to ask such an important question.
---
I love my gauss. Though I think its more of a one-shot type gun, they can be quite exceptional. Instigating gauss will drop pretty much most mobs in one. 
---
That and the ammo is only steel + lead, save on a mat or two plus you get x27 each craft if you got ammo smith.
---
I have done that. I started this Tadpole quest thing a couple of days after it came out. Still no change.
---
Yeah actually good idea. And if you open the map there could be a small box with a list of your on-going favorites you can just click on instead of looking for it on the map.
---
I thought that was last weeks, i saw the week challenge end in 10 hours and that was last night
---
Its pretty messed up imo. If i leave my toon at camp 100% on food and water and go for a smoke &amp; make coffee , about 10 minutes away hes almost on red when i get back
---
Spend those caps then!
---
Damn that‚Äôs awesome
---
I've given deathclaw hides I've found to other people I play with. When they scrap them,  they did count.
---
Does it take down scorch beasts easy?
---
If it dropped consistently good loot I'd jump in. The game needs to motivate players to do it, as is the massive time and ammo sink is such a huge dissentive for some meat and a shite legendary.
---
Could just run whitesprings or westek or player vendor hop and find better loot.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen as well :(
---
This man speaks the truth üëç
---
They've already responded. Apparently I failed to mention which helmet it is so I had to respond with the helmet name. We may have an answer here shortly.
---
I used a Mole Miners Gauntlet to complete the challenge.
---
a few days ago i visited someones store, they were built on top of a cliff with a deck protruding over the edge, which is where their vending machines were. while i was happily looking to purchase some of their inventory, the base disappeared and i fell to my death.... Fun times.
---
So that‚Äôs supposed to legitimize false advertising?
---
Of course, decent controls are a well known feature of battle royals.
---
This wasn't the patch notes. It was a showcase of one of the major changes in Patch 10. There will most likely be a ton of bug fixes and other changes.
---
The pain-train perks might be useful for you as well, you can charge in, knock guys down and then punch the rest.
---
Really looking forward to posting them, nearly at 400 answers so hoping to top that by tomorrow. Thanks for your answers!
---
Destroy that keypad and place a new one. Fixes the problem 7/10 times! :P
---
Cheers, appreciate it
---
Me 2. Cap mines, nuking corners to clear campers. Holding  down points to spawn npcs to help you fight.
---
My vault tec pant suit did not count for the kill legendary weekly. However the enclave officer outfit does.
---
Its not that obvious since this game is clearly not ready for battle royale. Any BR that has constant lag or suttering never gets off the ground let alone brings in new players. Yay for the controls but, as we all already know, the stability isn't there.
---
I could help out if you can wait until Friday 5pm EST.
---
My bad, same thing tho
---
Go to Facebook, search for the Couriers.
---
Problem solved.
---
Sorry, it's a lever action rifle with the legendary modifiers "furious" and "armor piercing".  There's a third one but I don't remember what it is.
---
Reddit gold ~ about one star bottle cap.
---
Man, I would love to enter into that, but I work a 13 hour night-shift on June 23rd.
---
You need not be present to win, though it helps w/ making a speech. :) You just need to have an HOA CAMP eval prior to the end date.
---
Ya but the stinging MAG has 30% armor penetration, which can stack with tank killer quite effectively.
---
It's mostly murder, split between killing someone because you can't trust them to not kill you and the other side is enjoyment.
---
It's tense, gunfights are exhilarating. It's marred by the occasional mismatch or god role build but in my experience it's outweighed by positive pvp interactions.
---
It'll be great for figuring out your actual damage output and determining if you should use perforating vs. piercing, anti-armor vs two shot,and so forth
---
Oh, they're the Silo exits right? In that case I already knew about them. Order Of Mystery is the only quest I haven't completed, which explains why my dumbass thought I found something incredible.
---
Cancer either way
---
Ya its clear... They got raided and now are just letting ppl keep them. Just speculation but i would guess if they were not going to release it, they will now. Cant have ppl complaining that its in one version and not others.
---
So prob just a matter of time since someone forced thier hand lol.
---
Right on. All good then.
---
I only got my camera a week ago so you're not alone!
---
I would love to have an actual poster of this!
---
I wasn't aware of this service. Sounds nice. Can you post a link?
---
You cant have both on the same gun ...and lever has no armor piercing mag
---
"So I made up my new pink haired raider chick and left the vault."
---
Let's see some pics! :)
---
I'll have it done by then but ill message you if not. thank you.
---
Are you sure?  You have to go the extra step and scrap the hide, not just collect it, so I'm pretty sure it works?
---
just fallow the main quest line you will level up fast, all junk is useful even if you don't need it, bulk it and sell it to the bots. keep all the aluminum, adhesive, springs, screws, gears you find.
---
I was skeptical about the lack of human npcs but the environmental storytelling is very good, imo. Some of the scenes you find are sad enough on their own. Plus, all the depressing holotapes you find give a good impression that people simply were not able to survive. It really does give it a "world just ended" vibe I think.
---
This is bait, anti armor and furious are both primary effects, they can't exist on the same gun
---
It's not a magazine, it's a legendary effect.  I'll double check when I log on this evening because I could totally be remembering this wrong, but I'm pretty sure it has it.
---
&gt;Not sure why people are downvoting you and the OP
---
Because... It is Reddit haha.
---
Ha, yeah I suspected they must have a glut of them.
---
Relative order of difficulty: Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash/Savage Divide, the Mire, Cranberry Bog. Some quests have multiple steps that get ridiculously harder like Top of the World. Don't rush to finish all of them.
---
What about the 9,000 who didn't buy it and were faux-outraged about the bag? We can't forget them :P
---
Mutation then
---
Do it yourself. Find a quiet server and an in game container. Transfer said items in and switch character. Join game from someone you verified was in server. I do this all the time.
---
Dmg doesnt change when i take cards off.Pretty sure the shovel is bugged.Gonna msg Bethesda site. Need more ppl to complain...but nobody use legendary shovels üò¢ So think its dead
---
It isn't bait.  Could be me having a faulty memory, which does happen.  I'll check later and update with what it actually is.
---
I thought it was going to be the disturbed Tom meme so you win.
---
You can still zoom.
---
I agree this is a viable alternative but it is so much better when sharing music in world with friends
---
Ok, was afraid I missed something.  I wasn't upset that he killed me, as it is part of the game I was just confused as to his reasoning.  I mean I still went around and collected the acid after he killed me and I even defended his camp in next event.  No hard feeling and I guess I never thought about he could have left camp alone and killed me again.
---
Will have to watch for that next time too as I usually ignore and respawn right there anyhow.
---
Suck to die twice :0)
---
No thanks, we prefer fallout
---
Me too. Thank atom for my goat legs and bird bones.
---
I checked again, they still stack in so far as damage. Only on the Bolt Rifle or pipe revolver.
---
I would edit this to say 25-35 year old Mike is dissatisfied with his progress in real life and wants to show you what a big man he is in Appalachia.
---
Individual loot
---
Done
---
That could be true too... lack of agency and power in one's life can translate to this sort of crap. 
---
And then again... some people... 
---
are just jerks.
---
The map markers make that mode total shit
---
I have a set of plans if you want. Ps4.
---
Why though, it lacks in customization, compared to games that focuses on building.
---
I got a 3\* anti armor rolling pin yesterday. I went to bed after that before something bad happen in my real life like a stroke or heart-attack.
---
I guess PvP is still a top priority for the devs. Few small changes to the running and reload animations isn‚Äôt nearly enough to make a good PvP experience. Hopefully they learned their lesson from Survival mode and will not allow existing characters in the new mode. Otherwise it is already dead.
---
Confirmed the Surveyor outfit issue, good catch, the details will be added!
---
Stock up on straight jackets every time you get on so you can sell‚Äôem, that way you counter the cost.
---
I've been able to target stingwings‚Ä¶ but not bloatflies.
---
Which seems super odd.
---
You should always expect a bloodied explosive shotgun to the back of your head.
---
Last week was the harpoon gun. And it was a million times harder to get haha
---
Should have been a female Robobrain named.... Bev.
---
I visited a camp the other day where someone left a brown paper bag next to a Raider catapult thing and I went down and picked it up but it trigger the Trap and shot my ass to my death I couldn't stop laughing.
---
So my dad's kind of a weird guy. Let's get that out of the way.
---
But short answer: My dad.
---
From the very beginning, he always imagined that you're not controlling the character, but rather the camera that moves the character. If you think about it that way, you'd push the stick at the back your character's head down, and if the swivel is your neck, it causes the front of your face to move up. If you move the stick to the left, it causes you to look to the right. 
---
That kind of makes sense, but it's still not as crazy as why he actually inverts both.
---
The first time he used a computer, he learned that the thing was called a mouse, so he put it down with the tail facing him. This, to him, seemed like a natural position because the mouse would be facing forward with him. Sure, he thought it was weird that everything moved the opposite direction, but he rolled with it. 30 years later and he's still doing it. FPS, RTS, it doesn't matter. Left is right and up is down in his bizarro world and he actually gets annoyed that the mouse is always the "wrong way" after someone else uses a computer.

Really important for testing Junki builds as well.

Just a reminder that barring the legacy explosive modifier, laser rifles are still absolutely terrible and in need of balancing.
---
Well, I am on PC, so if I understood it correctly I would have to make a video to send in?
---
if you find 1 just scrap it then you can make them
---
Goodness that was just a joke lol
---
No. but the outrage over a bag was stupid. How much of it was blown out of proportion. How many people who didn't even buy the power armour edition got "angry" about it. That is why i'm annoyed at the whole "bUt My CaNvAs BaG!" thing.
---
yes, it was bad they didn't make it canvas. Yes, they should have told people sooner that it was changing material. But oh my god, the reaction to it by people has been pathetic. It's a bag people!
---
All come up as 0% for me :/. I don't normally post on these things  but it's affecting game play and making me frustrated lol
---
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me!"
---
Definitely. I‚Äôd be cool to have a couple bots around like in FO4. I‚Äôd be cool to send them out as vendor bots roaming the wasteland.

Mostly because it's cool to hate on BR. "omg everything has a BR mode now" like yeah? People wanna play that shit. Like yeah, a lot of people wanna play that shit?
---
They are definitely working on other issues while they're working on Nuclear Winter, this was their plan from the beginning. People are just looking for excuses to bitch.
---
Seeing damage numbers will be interesting.  I probably won't use them unless I'm testing dps on new weapons, but it's a great feature to add.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the input. Ill have to keep that in mind. I havent even touched top of the world, one day though, one day.
---
Camps can't be damaged in either mode I believe and anything you find on either mode stays when you transition between the two.
---
I feel that way some days. I'll log on and be like..."what the fuck am I gonna do today?" And just fuck around for awhile. But that usually passes after a few days and I get all caught up in the game again. I'm lvl 185 now. Been playing since BETA but I've experienced that more than once.
---
thinking persistently is overrated, i try to forgo thinking altogeth..... SQUIRREL! (Frito runs away chasing a small rodent)
---
That‚Äôs total crap, the bag was the ‚Äúeveryday carry‚Äù item and Bethesda tried screwing its fans for more a greater profit.  If I bought the Power Armor Edition, I‚Äôd be pissed off too.
---
Totally. The only problem would be balancing.
---
Be careful not to get them stolen
---
I think I will do challenges for atoms. I'm burned out on tadpole and possum challenges for now.

Fallout/ elder scrolls melee has always been painfully shit.

todd holds us hostage
---
He's after a rusty trumbone
---
I've been having the same issue! Hopefully this can be fixed with the fix combat update. Cos I've lost a lot of fights due to vats doing this.
---
It‚Äôs just a really overdone thing now, like battlepasses. Plus like other people have said, there‚Äôs so many things in this game that don‚Äôt really work properly right now, so if they put in a battle royale anytime soon, you‚Äôd see even more hate than you already do.
---
Plus there‚Äôs a LOT they‚Äôd have to do in order to make a good battle royale for a game like this, any they can barely fix what they have.
---
Exactly!! Well said.
---
Figures. They put a deadline to fix THEIR publicized fraud. Any respect I had for Bethesda died the week of Fallout 76's launch, anyway.
---
I was in a CAMP down near the monorail elevator, and they had a mirelurk king for a friend.  I didn't even notice it was friendly at first.  I could just hear it prowling around outside and since I like to clean up the spawns I create at camps, I went in for the kill.  I shot it once before noticing it was friendly and felt terrible.
---
Luckily the gentleman was selling stimpak diffusers, so I bought three, stood next to his crunchy-sounding pet and healed it back up while finishing out my medic badge.  I never noticed the sound mirelurk kings make, probably because I'm never standing quietly next to one for any length of time.
---
Take a break! I took about a month off and jumped back in having more fun than before. Make your own end game and role play. That‚Äôs my only advice. If it‚Äôs not fun take a break.
---
On PS4 it is the same button as the VATS Button(L1, LB I assume) to Zoom, and you're able to pull them up with Fire(R2, RT?) in addition to L2(LT I assume)
---
Haha, yeah i guess that could work too

Oh, so you just admitted you didn't buy the power armour edition. Therefore, you have no right to be mad at this at all. Since it didn't affect you.

&gt; armor piercing furious lever action 
---
Are you sure it was armor piercing and furious? I am not seeing that the lever action has any armor piercing mods. If it wasn't a mod then it couldn't be both the anti armor and furious legendary effect as they fall in the same tier.

Load into a game world, and while the load screen is still up, shut down your game and tell me what happens when you boot it back up. Has happened twice, but not in the situation I described yesterday. Someone told me it happens if you stay on an occupied server too so I did assume about that part
---
I ended up using a powered door and the pressure plates to make the door open/close automatically.  I got tired of always finding my door open and occasionally finding an enemy creature inside my house.
---
When I visit someone's camp, I tend to close the door(s) that I find open.
---
Was just about to comment this.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what the powered doors did in FO4? I think we have them in F76 too.
---
I mean, how much did they charge for the Power Armor Edition? It was a dirty money grab on Bethesda‚Äôs part, so I didn‚Äôt feel bad when the lawyers swooped in asking for names.  What does cotton cost per yard?
---
I don't understand why some people like to antagonize others that are minding their own business.  Even gang members in real life generally have the decency to leave regular civilians alone.
---
That's how these "To the guy who murdered a lvl 2 coming out of the vault" posts start...... :)
---
Modded ones i think, i dont remember any stock doors that did, at least not that you could build, 1 of the big complaints was settlers opening the doors all the time
---
Next time u get on send me a msg on xbox so I will see it when I get on the remind me to put one back for u
---
Why not just drop the supplies for them right away?
---
At this point, I'm not.  But like I said, I'll check when I get off and correct accordingly.

**Issue: Scout Mods Improperly Names** (Ticket Submitted on 06-06-2019)
---
The Scout mod are too numerous to detail here but all of them are insufficiently named lacking the Identifier on the MiscMods detailing what Body/Limb they are linked with.  
---
It's understood some of these can only be for the Arms, Legs or Torso, but without the details new players won't understand why X can't be Applied to X.
---
Fix:  
---
Rename the Scout miscmods, adding the Limb names.

Only if you set them up to do that, otherwise powered = open and non powered = closed, also they look a bit trash
---
They had to know how many to make. They extended the deadline multiple times FFS. What more do you expect them to do? Make a new bag every time someone sends in a ticket asking for one? That's impractical and stupid.
---
Yes this makes it tedious to play with friends, especially when everyone one shots everything. I'm surprised it didn't work that way to begin with.
---
Yeah, Yongyea decided to make a video going "It's June, where's the stupid bags?!" despite the fact June is a whole 30 days and he made it 5 days in. He likes to cause outrage over the game for some reason.
---
Here come my downvotes too. As someone who played mainly FPS since the 90s, I am tired of death match. I played COD every year too and I avoided DM. I always liked the more team based modes.
---
These new games doing battle royale has been a refreshing take to DM, but i havent jumped into one of those games for at least a few months.
---
Confirmed and Added the Miscmod issue
---
I would like normal doors to just close though, i dont really like the look of the powered doors and they definately dont fit with my build i have now
---
Oh I've already moved at least eight times, in this case back to a previous spot
---
Yes, I do because it‚Äôs the precedent.  They did the same thing with the map in the Skyrim collectors edition and allowing them to get away with it creates a situation where they‚Äôll feel comfortable with similar actions in the future.
---
l o l
---
Like look I get it. I know BR is being over done(has been over done for a while but regardless‚Äùfucking Minecraft‚Äù )  and I know I would fear them just trying to fix the BR game is a thing from what I have read but people are just nit picking at this point.
---
Thanks for the tip. Lol... I already wasted all my frags and plasmas to no avail because I figured radiation wouldn't work (was one last lvl 64 Glowing One underneath the south building in thunder mountain)
---
Some older interfaces did work that way. But mice aren't the most ergonomic option anyway, especially for people who are getting older, so maybe he'd do better with something that wasn't a mouse? My parents are luddites and definitely do better with trackpads or touch screens or etc
---
I came here searching for the same answer. Any luck?
---
I think my camp is pretty nice, but I'm just a casual camper.  I don't do any weird tricks or create impossible structures that would be considered creative.  It's just a standard hotel.
---
What if we don't use twitter but want to enter?
---
A little tip for people also looking for deathclaw hide; look in the cabins behind Top of the world. There are a lot of green footlockers that can be checked, and the last 2 times I made a run through there, I found a hide each time.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried it since I‚Äôm afraid, have you met the same problem recently?
---
FYI, it sold out out before I could.
---
What system are you on?
---
They didn't get away with it though? They've literally made new bags to give to people?
---
What are you trying to say here?
---
Do you have a custom.ini?   
---
I'm both a Mod user and Author, and I know from personal experience that the first thing you need to do is disable all mods as the first step in troubleshooting
---
I have gotten what appears to be everything someone had multiple times from workshops. If you need junk, farming players is the fastest means to that end.
---
I want legendary power armor frames, so the armor pieces themselves aren‚Äôt changed, but the frame is, and that‚Äôs a great place to put effects like ‚Äúlow weight‚Äù and  ‚Äúhigh durability‚Äù
---
Yeah, like a giant invisible Boulder us in the way.
---
There are a lot of players in the world that need your help: if you're experienced enough in the game to be bored then you probably know enough about the game to start acting as a leader and as a roll model for other less traveled players
---
How do we apply?
---
Ok that's 6 hours a day, every day since release...
---
&gt;A major criticism of Fallout 76 in general has been that they‚Äôre just chasing trends by having a online survival game, and then following that up by throwing in another trend
---
Like all of the content on the roadmap this was designed, architected and started before FO76 was released. 
---
The other side of that is things are trendy because they are heavily played and liked by players. It's not a case of "me too" it's a case of you have to have it or be seen as obsolete.  
---
From what I've seen/heard of this new mode you'll go in with no weapons and almost certainly a new character and will not be able to swap back and forth to adventure mode.  As such there should be no reason for people on adventure mode to be hating in it. If it's not their cup of Joe, cool, don't play it. 
---
I, for one, have done only a bit of PvP, but I may get into this mode as the playing field is level. No need to try to buy up a set of assassin cavalier armor or have a glass cannon bloodied build. It could be fun and I'll wait to judge it on it's own merits
---
I wonder if you'll see other people's numbers though. Probably just your own. At least we'll know though.
---
Unrelated: Every five years I find myself going through another Fallout NV phase. Always a new mod or way to play. Last time I played as a time traveller with a wonky telephone booth trying to save a broken future. 
---
Truly one of the best.
---
Gotta go big chems and alcohol with chem fiend and party boy. Fury, whisky, nukashine, they‚Äôll be your best friends.
---
Yeah, sounds like the same problem, all I would say is don‚Äôt repeat it and waste more time and caps, and instead put up a post here and get someone to sell you the paint until they fix it!
---
Equip ‚ÄòCan Do!‚ÄôPerk in Luck that will help you a lot
---
PCMasterRace here, unfortunately.  Thank you though!
---
They got away with it when they pulled this with the ‚Äúcanvas maps‚Äù for the Skyrim Special Edition.  They thought that they could do it again with the Power Armor Edition.  So read up and quit defending a greedy game company you buddy fucking troll.
---
If we can view damage resistance in realtime, what is the point of the Awareness perk continuing to exist?

It's like the guy who invented Nuka-Shine went from Nuka Cola to Sheepsquatch world, hahaha.
---
Yea im doing the same right now ive done everything I think I can at this point by myself. Im level 74 with my rifle character, all the rifles on him are aae so I have nothing to grind for. I decided to make a shotgun character maybe changing playstyles is what I need I got him to level 50 and realised huh that didnt change anything accept I realised how bad shotguns are. I just mess around my camp now trying to find my perfect spot and help new players out because I want them to have fun. I realised how hard the level 20s can be when you have a mission surrounded by level 40/60s. Other than that just gonna break for a month unless new content hits.
---
You can do this currently via the Awareness perk... which seems like it'll be pretty pointless after this update, heh.
---
The extra damage was a bug, it was intentionally fixed and now works as intended.
---
Wow, and now resorting to insults.
---
You seem like a really nice guy.
---
Mama dolce. I find 5+ everytime i do the feed the people event. Plus you get 5 stew at the end so win win.
---
Been there done that.
---
Fuck yes I can use my dragon
---
Always forget about that one..  
---
This one is a super easy fix on Bethesda's side, I've included the details and the fix.
---
Hence you use the Courier service
---
you are, one of my favorite things in the game, great story
---
I run chameleon armor and use a reflex sight on my shotgun... it doesn't take long to know your weapon and figure out the impact point, just a bit of experience....or use vats. With the speed improvement to scopes I'm not sure a reflex sight is even going to matter going forward as you can just as easily have a recon scope as the reflex without penalty
---
came to the comments for this, was not disappointed
---
Can do at the whitesprings - search all the trash cans
---
Ok so I hope the following helps. Go to the motel at Flatwoods and raid the gym for the weights (lead). Waddle down the road and scrap them at the first workbench you find. FT to the Charleston Fire Department and do the same. Pick up every weapon you find, every serving tray in the kitchen and pantry. Don't forget the balls on the pool table. They have a workbench for scrapping too. Plenty of other places, but that's all your lead done. Even Flatwoods has enough steel if you pick up everything. Watoga High's canteen has a zillion plastic forks, knives and plates. If Watoga's not your scene yet, the cat lady house north of Bolton greens is your spot. I hear Morgantown High is also great for plastic but that's not on my run.
---
I can carry 300 with deep pocketed combat armor everything and my armored backpack - but find so much loot that I have to resort to my excavator PA with calibrated shocks.
---
If you are are on PC and need a cool set of armor that will let you carry piles of loot, I can make it for you.
---
Does being in sneak mode not show a symbol for you on the map? New to this game, so I don‚Äôt know a lot of stuff yet
---
I bought one from a vendor. Scraped it. Didn't count.
---
Nope, I didn't do any modding on 76. Everything went fine after the first appalachia update, seems like it occured after the last patch. Repair didn't help and I'd really like to avoid redownloading the whole game since my download speed is not very fast.
---
He doesn't have a computer anymore outside of when they make him for work, but the x-y movement stuck with him over the years. He does love his tablet though, so you're right on with the touch screens.

Was it all the rare jumpsuit outfits?  Because if so, that was me, and I was just starting in in the western outfits when the shop disappeared.  Everyone heard me exclaim "shitty pissy fuck fuck" into area chat.
---
Before entering Big Bend Tunnel West, in the little buildings to the left of the train tracks, I usually find at least 5 canned dog food.  Can't think of a location with more than that.
---
I run a bloodied lever and bloodied handmade regularly on my rifle build. AA gause rifle and vampiric dragon also float in and out depending on how I am feeling that day. my dragon can one shot a grafton monster with a crit to the spots though which is nice. takes several for a non low health handmade or lever to kill him. maybe even like 5 to 6 shots sometimes
---
As would i
---
The only way this would work is to make them unkillable, and static, as in not moving around very much. You would not be able to have NPCs like in Fallout 4 that help you in combat.
---
The sound drives me insane. It'd prevent me having one as a pet which sucks cuz I like them a lot otherwise.
---
Nope. If they lower the travel costs they have to add some other caps sink instead to keep the economy healthy. It has worked fine the way it is now for months, no reason to change what is working fine and as intended.
---
Today I encountered someone who waited me to get to his keypad door and he shut it on my face preventing me from getting in. lol

Will finally get to figure out if perks work or not. For example anti-armor energy weapons. Now we will see if its just a UI bug while using awareness or not. The queen we can figure out if she had hidden mitigation. Very very nice.
---
I would be willing to take a cap reward penalty (if they ever bump the rewards above 25% of enemy level) for the ability to stay off the map and not be marked wanted by other players.
---
Awesome I‚Äôll add you now! Where do you think is a good place to do the challenge?i can‚Äôt really think of anywhere

Can do! and checking every trash can in whitesprings and everywhere you go, I usually like doing runs of pharma farm and can do back before I got mutations and now i'm swimming in dog food and like 300+ stims

The original Fallout was a spiritual successor of Wasteland, so I'd say any discussion of Wasteland or Wasteland 2 is very on-topic.
---
What wasn‚Äôt a very warm welcome, shame on you Will.
---
There's many ways to PvP. It literally just means player versus player, that can even mean competition in normal event...
---
Well that‚Äôs on you, there‚Äôs a variety of weapons for a reason. Personally I use melee because it seems my luck only allows me to find good melee weapons versus ranged. I‚Äôve played since release and have never came across any explosive or two shots like so many other players, however I‚Äôve ran across some really decent melee weapons and have stuck with them.

I'm PC FWIW. The numbers should be the same across all platforms though. That's what I'm seeking. From what I've seen, the device itself doesn't tell you what it does. The regular stabby stimpacks tell you they heal a certain amount but the diffuser doesn't. So that's what I'm wondering. What are those numbers?
---
My entire point is that we'd like legendary effects on power armor that MAKE IT effective in pvp. Things like Assassins. Regular non legendary armor is no more effective in PvP than power armor is. The legendary effects are all that matter. So let's give power armor some pvp specific legendary effects to make it usable in pvp.
---
Haha nah this was yesterday. But if you see the guy that killed me you can tell him to eat a dick for me lol
---
Most people are super friendly. That kinda surprised me but I welcome it greatly.
---
Easy? Depends. I spend a lot of bullets on them until they land, then finish with the tse.  Prior to getting the handmade tse, it took a couple dozen shots with my lever (no legendary effects). I have all the rifle perks maxed along with bloody mess
---
Right okay, joined your world and I‚Äôm at site Charlie now
---
whoah, that's a lot
---
I bought a single stimpack for **420** caps!
---
We need a parents association. We are dedicated players, held hostage by real world responsibilities. My trade is sleep. I have discovered I can mostly live on 6 hrs sleepüò¥
---
Have you just counted the number of times you've done Scorched Earth or is it tracked somewhere? I'd really like to know how many I've done.
---
Nuka Nades are a ballistic explosion with a radiation aftermath. the explosion would be more then enough if it is close enough
---
If you're willing to go around half dead from radiation... Not for everyone
---
Yeah it was a 3\* Legendary.
---
All hail Bubbles purveyor of the fantastic NukaCola Grape - beloved by mutants and ghouls everywhere
---
But the map doesn‚Äôt update unless you close and reopen? Right?
---
I meant alpha can you fast travel?
---
Enjoy! You only level 16??
---
My post is suggestions to make melee feel better, sorry, but comments like go pick different weapon won't help
---
Aww man I‚Äôm stuck on a loading screen, give us 2 mins I‚Äôll be there soon
---
Aw damn, oh well. There goes that idea
---
I believe this is the case.
---
Sure!
---
BECAUSE REASONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
btw i agree with you
---
I swear more people care about this stupid fucking $5 box stuffer than about the refugee children being murdered in Trump's concentration camps. GaMeRs RiSe Up herpa derpa doo.
---
What if it was never supposed to work and it's just another shitty legendary effect added to the loot pool to extend the grind?
---
bdum- bum!
---
The doors that come with the Slocum Joe's building set did, but I think those may've been a Creation Club thing.
---
Arr, she be a fine ship matey
---
Big help.. thank you.. makes it easier then writing it down
---
totally not a serial killer
---
Ok, I think the root issue has been found, added and submitted, thanks!
---
Definitely sucks. I think it's been more like months, not just weeks since it's been broken... at least it feels that way lol 
---
What i do is use vats to find and target the darn bug, then quickly switch off vats and swing!
---
no i was just asking because i can make them but havn't used them yet and don't have a team to test it with but i could try to figure it out
---
Yeah there wasnt a slocums joe set in vanilla or DLC, definately mods there
---
Thats what I've been doing but just dropping it on the ground. I didn't know it was safe to drop in a container. That would make it more hidden. Thank you for the tip.
---
there was a thread earlier explaining lock picking.....sometimes when you fast travel to a camp it spawns you inside a locked camp. I hate when this happens, I usually fast travel to the nearest location out but I'm sure some people just pick the lock
---
Awesome job!!!
---
All fallout games have raider's. You should expect it, in fallout 4 they attacked your workshops regularly. ..
---
Every game I have played; that forced a BR ends up being mediocre. I'm not against it, but the time invested in such a feature would be better spent on other things.
---
Hey man I can hear you but still loading in, also I forgot to say but I don‚Äôt have a mic :(
---
Hahahaha.
---
You didn't buy a duped handmade did you?
---
That was the end game.
---
The nuke zone is their only spawn as far as I know
---
Hmm yeah i haven't seen any updates to this either. Been hoarding items to display all this time...
---
no worries!
---
Music Licensing = $$$$$$$
---
will be good for my .50 cal but my main problem right now is when shits don't die and heal all his life again lol sometimes it's fix if i reload but sometimes dont ü§£
---
I‚Äôm just gonna restart the game and rejoin, sorry!
---
I do not have a Twitter and my C.A.M.P. is more barn/farm-themed so it doesn't really fit any of these categories. Can I still enter? On Xbox?
---
... you have so much patience.
---
Just travel to the ammo factory and repair the landing pad (dont need to claim the workshop)
---
Make sure your camera is equipped as you've got to be really close to the bot for the camera to register it
---
Nuke zone is the only sure shot. If you are short on caps and know how to make the marine helmet, make and sell that. They require just a few materials to make. Have your hard bargain card active while selling
---
Take one of the workshops with a vertibot landing pad and repair it, then take a photo of the vertibot that spawns.
---
Or go to an owned workshop and do the same thing, I think you can still repair the landing pad if you don't own the workshop.
---
I believe I read there was a bug that would delete excess materials from bulked resources, not sure if that was ever patched...
---
Might be wise to scrap the bulked materials prior to crafting. Particularly any materials that can only be bought prebulked, i.e screws and ballistic fiber.
---
Found a bag at my front door with Communist propaganda inside. Was gone for around 15 minutes.
---
PCMasterRace here, fortunately.
---
FTFY
---
Grinding for legendaries is what Bethesda had in mind for end game. Buying all of those AAE rifles was like putting in a cheat code.
---
Go to grafton steel workshop, fix the vertibot pad, and take a picture. Thats how I have always done it
---
Each song has their own licensing restrictions and pricing. So I do expect to see new music implemented but nothing mainstream.
---
Stop whining over a BR mode. Those of you crying about this need to realize that it will most likely be a small part of what‚Äôs to come. In addition to a BR mode their will probably be newly added quests and events. Stop spreading misinformation that Bethesda is staking everything there is to come on a BR mode only.
---
Try going to Poseidon Energy Plant, repair the Vertibot pad and take a pic of that one. Might have to get right up on it to count but that's how I got that one, lol.
---
Mine puts you well outside my entire fort, it's a compound inside huge concrete walls and you spawn outside of them. Not an issue at my camp. Plus like I said the room is small (4 foundations) so even it puts you in my camp the chances of being in that room are very small.
---
all good relaxing with ac and a cold one ill just pump some country roads
---
I love the damage ticker option.
---
I can craft those I'll give it a try
---
Ok...   
---
It turns out the inverse is true, the Severe Receiver has an erroneous entry giving it bonus damage over the other Receivers, so it's not the Prime and Hardened being "Too Weak" it's the Severe having an Extra Buff..  
---
People are going to hate me, but documenting and submitting.
---
Well shit
---
What‚Äôs wrong with nuke zones?
---
Carry weight on power armor should be buffed...leave everything else alone. ( Non-pa wearer here).
---
No it‚Äôs under the kill legendary enemies in the combat menu in challenges. I wish it would show you how many times you‚Äôve done it. I‚Äôm curious too.
---
Blackwater mine is a good place for glowing moleminers. Obviously anywhere nuked with ghouls.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I like to leave used...er..one raw rubber in their bed.
---
it doesnt the meat hook is atm the best unnarmed weapon in the game   
---
build  
---
3 iron fist

---
Looking promising then that they stay around a bit then thanks
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see the results!
---
thank you for the concern fellow wanderer. Ill keep my wits about me.
---
I think the sneaking issues are largely due to server lag and "walking into" an enemy that's invisible but still able to detect you, and that creates the danger or caution alert.  When it's a burrowing enemy, or something that's supposed to pop out of the ground, like a radroach, the effect can persist permanently and force a server hop.  [Here's a pic as an example](https://imgur.com/VwWGHh2).  As you can see, walking over it put my immediately into danger.  There's nothing on the ground, but putting my crosshairs in a specific spot, I can see that a ghoul is supposed to be there.  It never showed up, and I had to get as far as Blackwater Mine to go back into caution and then be fully hidden again.  (the pic is at the Whitespring laundry/maintenance building)
---
Aside from barter costs, Charisma does affect the quality of your rewards during events, and possibly rare plans and equipment from vendors.  After getting my fourth piece of unyielding/ap refresh/sneak armor and running around at \~19% health for the past two days, I finally got a hunter's longcoat from the Responderbot vendor and the starburst clock plan from Grahm.  I also got two brand new weapon plans from the two Free Range events I participated in, after getting the same stuff for the past month, and got a smores recipe and three possum tokens from three Campfire Tales completions.  One or two desirable drops might be good luck, but I'm starting to see a pattern with a jump from 4 charisma to 16.
---
If a high INT score affected the durability deterioration of weapons and armor, even by a small degree, that would be worth boosting INT for.  If a 15 INT made weapons and armor degrade 15% slower, a high INT would be very desirable.  I personally have 6 for a combo of either 3 gunsmith/3 nerd rage or 5 gunsmith/1 demo expert for the low hanging 20% boost to explosives effects.
---
I know nukes are good I did not know about black water thank you will go there and try it
---
Yeah, I even had my game crash while loading, I was worried from what I'd heard, but no it was ok. Same with vending machines being destroyed and repaired, everything was ok.
---
Maybe I've just been lucky. I'm on the PC platform if that matters.
---
After lvl 50 there are no more points to be had. You either move a point or pick a perk card. Is there anyway you can show us what your build is? I think there's a website where you can actually post your build
---
Maybe that's what the patch on Monday was for because this was happening as of last week when it happened to me a second time haha
---
thank you.
---
QUICK SCOPING!
---
Yea I read that after, pretty cool service
---
Nothing. Just wondering if there was a better way
---
Dang I just packed up one of my favorite Camps since beta, and wanted to try something new. That‚Äôs an L
---
Well I grinded caps not legendaries and I was able to just buy them still a grind all the same
---
Of cpurse this would be posted while im away from home until the 29th....
---
It's only for atom shop skins I believe...there is sneak improvement MODS that can be applied that darken your armor.
---
Dont think the camp repairs, mine never gets attacked though bc i turn off vending machines before going into survival.
---
Also yes on items, you carry over anything you get. Just make sure your only carrying a few aid items and no junk when you go in though. They drop on death and no point in giving someone all your ballistic fiber or stims if you get caught off gaurd.
---
Not a problem bud. Yeah it's a popular spot for people to farm for enemy weapons to sell for caps so don't worry if you don't get a spawn. Just hop servers and you'll eventually get something. Happy hunting!
---
I've seen CAMPs appear and disappear with the map open.
---
I think as far as the character blips though, I think your right. I don't see them move, close/open, totally different spots.
---
Strange - tryed it today again adding you but was the same reason...
---
I'm gonna have a look into my settings and keep an eye on the folks on the server meanwhile
---
Only if you get the wig and perfume and stuff
---
They like to put teasers in to preview items
---
Waiting for the outfits on the corvega backpack images, haha
---
Ok will do
---
So a few people reported this...   (Western Revolver)
---
Ok...
---
It turns out the inverse is true, the Severe Receiver has an erroneous entry giving it bonus damage over the other Receivers, so it's not the Prime and Hardened being "Too Weak" it's the Severe having an Extra Buff..
---
Bethesda needed certain weapons to be insanely powerful so that they could make them extremely rare and keep players grinding for them while they hopefully spend real money in the Atom shop........and then dupers came along.
---
Im away training at the minute, not home again until the 29th...... Having to browse this sub to get my fill
---
Hmm. Just seems to be no consistency then lol. Figures.
---
I still don't understand how duping is supposed to be fun ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thats my second char gonna make a melee build with her
---
She‚Äôs a good looking ship, and anyone who says otherwise be a lily liveried squid. Ye should chew on some hard tack, though, Cap‚Äôn, ye seem to be starving to death.
---
He may want the materials from the workshop. That is a pvp area so it should be expected you could be killed. It's not griefing it's control of a resource.
---
It's much safer than dropping in a doggy bag that's for sure. I'm a little less discreet, but a few of my comrades built their bases by an in world container, or even in some circumstances, around it to help insure safety.
---
 The only time I've ever had an issue was with a server crash about a minute after I retrieved my items and it did not register my picking them up beforehand. Even though I was in the process of selling said items, but whatever. That was once in a great many times I've done this. So not bad odds thus far.
---
It's entirely likely they have a team doing pvp updates and a team doing pve udpates.
---
So I got a response and that response was: we don't want to ruin the mystery by telling you if it's there or not. Which means it probably is. If it wasn't, I think they'd have come right out and said it. I can post the screen shot in the sub
---
You can repair it if someone else owns it, with no repercussions. I repaired the one at Poseidon when I did this challenge, and as I was doing so it so happened another player was actually claiming the workshop. I never realised this until I got a wave from the guy, likely thanking me for saving him the effort!
---
But without dupers you'd still be grinding for them. Bethesda intended for the loot grind to be what kept you playing.
---
Pipe Rifle.  
---
Both Add the Rifle Keyword (Bolt and Non-Bolt) so they are configured correct.
---
While i agree with time better spent. Talk about that update 10... All of it useless for a pc player except the damage shown.
---
Just was thinking about the 10th post iv seen where ppl get blasted in workshops cause rewards are better then survival mode. Or the number of ppl who love the tension that the leaderboard removes effectively making it a br at certain points in the day.
---
Very awesome!
---
then yea it's just people being idiots
---
Splitter Mod..   
---
Can you give me the exact number of reload difference for the two of them.   
---
Sorry going to be offline for a couple days so will be hard for me to test.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Go to Morgantown Airport and do the Collision Course event. A cargobot (which also works) comes to deliver a crate at the end and you can get your pic.
---
During patch 7 there was an unlock issue, I'd try doing some serious scrapping on the legs and see if it helps unlock it, if it's the last mod it can take a couple hundred scraps to get it.   
---
Let me know how it goes.
---
Is it directly above the stairs on the first floor?
---
Current bug prevents placing anything above it.
---
Workaround, 1) move the stairs to somewhere else.
---
2) place the roof
---
3)
---
Move stairs back.
---
Is their anything at all within the area besides walls, floor and roof? I've had that happen to me before and sometimes it's the stupidest thing. Like a wire or conduit on the wall. Logically it doesn't intersect or block the roof, but game can be dumb. Trying clearing area of anything that's not a floor, roof or wall.
---
Other times all you need is to close out of build mode and try again.
---
How could he kill you? Were you in Survival??
---
I posted on another Comment below with the details, it's a limitation because the Bloodied/Unyielding builds were killing themselves when the bonus HP's were removed from Armor, Food, Drugs.  
---
Until that is resolved they have removed the bonus HP's from END.
---
'tis all rum on this ship ye scallywag. We 'ave no meat 'til we hit port
---
Thank you ! Zero communication by them as always...fine. I‚Äôll report the info to my community since dozens came to me asking
---
Did you never had good ol' Nick Valentine as companion when the prydwen arrive?
---
Thanks
---
It's a known bug. It happens with the assaultron head and wood armor
---
How do you get such a clear view underwater? I can't see past my fingers.
---
I have a bunch - more than I'll ever use.  I sold about 20 of them in my vending machine for 1 cap each.  Someone bought them  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I agree it would be great if there were more textures available for the robot armor!   
---
As for the new / reintroduced bugs, hopefully the updates will stabilize.  
---
Thanks for commenting and giving me more data to troubleshoot and report, it takes a team!
---
You know, that‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôve seen a camp leave like the person left the server. I‚Äôve also seen the inventory drop to zero temporarily like they‚Äôre gone then come back. Maybe that‚Äôs what happens when they disconnect power. Doesn‚Äôt leave the map just empties inventory.
---
Why are these types of posts daily now with the same exact points made in every one? Is this just some lazy attempt to farm karma?
---
My planned build was a stealth sniper (rifles and shotguns), and a melee assassin (one handed melee). 
---
Thats how i played Fallout 4, however in FO4 you have unlimited perks so you could master everything given time.
---
I cut my build down to:
---
Maxed Shotgun dmg
---
Chem, Ballistic, and Energy Ammo weight reduction
---
Maxed Rifle dmg
---
Adamatium Skeleton/Fire Proof
---
Maxed Stim effectiveness
---
Enforcer (great for stopping glowing one mobs)
---
Covert Op (ranged sneak dmg)
---
Bloody Mess
---
Class Freak and Starched Genes
---
Tldr; you really need to specialise your build to get max damage out of your gear.  Jack of all trades build will get you no where.
---
Thanks man I appreciate it so much, take care! Let me know if you ever need help with anything from me :)
---
So it's effecting the Weight Reduction Armor effects?  
---
If you take the armor off there is no change in the total weight?  
---
Hate to ask, think you could grab a small video of you logging in, the weight you show and it unchanged when you remove the weight reduction armor?   
---
Helps for reports.
---
You, sir need to lighten up.
---
check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
Gotcha..     
---
Well Watch your Combat Armor, Left Arm and Leg... 3\* specifically, issue does not effect 2\*.
---
I did that for a while too. Got bored, took a break, came back and started helping players under lvl 30 complete quests. Made some weapons for them and upgraded their camps. Felt good to help out. I still help out on occasion at WS
---
*...just beat it, beat it, beat it...*
---
But it cancels the reload too right? Not just the animation.
---
no worries! glad it worked!
---
If it lets you ((Some US stores won't ship outside US)) going through the order without paying will tell you shipping costs. I think shipping can be different with different countries because of VAT.
---
Alright, sounds good hopefully we can play soon
---
Will spend a lot for an Instigating Explosive Lever Action on Xbox One. 
---
Best roll would be weight reduc as third star.
---
you sir are wong   
---
 the meat hook is atm the best unnarmed weapon in the gamei have both deathclaw gauntlet bloodied swing speed and meat hook bloodied swing speed

Far less than the shame of having a bag of tp,fertilazer, and a stew pot left at your camp.
---
Last weekend I used a card, but had to wait another 30 min to access the keypad to launch another nuke.  My buddy had to use his own card to access the keypad.
---
lol thanks
---
Please fix the gauss rifle bug as well.  Its slow to load and so annoying when you charge it to shoot and it just drops the charge.
---
Was able to make what is currently-up work as a background :) I'll keep an eye on this, as your work continues!
---
i can help you later tonight
---
No it doesn‚Äôt happen to other games
---
Cute! üíô
---
I just can't understand the drive for pvp in this game.
---
The Clipping while playing the Piano is something it's unlikely will ever get fixed because of how minor it is.   
---
Bone weighting the "Added" bones that exist on skirts is a real pain, and FO4 has legacy issues where it will look a little off.  
---
I'm not saying it's not an issue, and thank you for Commenting, but this is such a specific case its going to be a low priority.   
---
Some of the other examples could you grab and post some screenshots?   
---
Let me know which Coat it is.  
---
Trapper Torso Durabiity, Hmmm that one is going to be hard...
---
Heres a link to my build, if you'd like to take a look
---

---
Bags do not disappear when you log off.
---
There is a time limit I think, though not sure, but I have left servers only to rejoin it when a friend logs in and my bag was still sitting in the train station roughly 15 minutes later.
---
Yes, I assume so, but that's a trade-off I'm willing to accept.
---
I posted it on the fallout 76 bazaar since I can't post pictures here and it wouldn't let me share the post from there to here. So if you wanna see the actual screenshot I took it's there
---
Yeah, I finally found another  Mr. Handy model and *so far* I haven't scrapped it again. I need to get this thing on display before I destroy it again.
---
Thanks for confirming, think I found the issue and reported it.
---
hmm,   we're going to have to conduct more tests
---
&gt; he thought I was a fucking stoned moron
---
just because other people do it too, doesnt mean you arent a stoned moron =P
---
Yeah, if there was a no-legendaries mode with more traditional shooter time-to-kill, and no goofy heal-with-flamethrower perks I'd start a new character and never look back.
---
Getting our cardio.
---
Your not my supervisor!
---
I'm not sure tbh. I just now looked underwater and it was clear. Removed any perks like aquaboy and it was still clear. 
---
I will say that its nighttime on this server like the video. Maybe day/night play a role
---
Robco has 7 different models I think. Check every room.... And toilet ü§Æ
---
I did a clean install of my 2080 drivers after upgrading from my 980 ti. Just updated windows 10 to 1903 and I also had 2 Bios updates for my Gigabyte X470 Ultra Gaming. I don‚Äôt have much time to play since I work weekends but I‚Äôll let you know what happens!
---
I just feels to me that BR mode trivializes the fallout universe...
---
You still there?
---
idk why i laughed so hard at this,  it might have been the "lol" at the end.
---
I‚Äôve been noticing this too, but it‚Äôs very inconsistent. Sometimes I‚Äôm missing about every 3rd or 4th 95% shot, and other times I‚Äôm never missing 64% shots. 
---
I think it‚Äôs just the RNG gods being fickle.
---
The downvoting is legitimate. They are supposed to be used to bury comments that don't contribute to the discussion, and whining about fucking display cases in a thread about updated combat mechanics is the definition of not contributing to a discussion. If he wants to bitch about that, he can create his own thread and people who agree are free to upvote him there.
---
My record is about 600lbs of junk. Multiple times have I gotten 200-400 lbs. A large portion of hostile takeovers give about 5-30 lbs.
---
People hoard and we profit.
---
You'll get more "rolls of the dice" if you stick with 2\*, they're half as expensive
---
BIV appears to be a reference to the last part of "Roy G. Biv-" Blue, Indigo, Violet. When you drink Nukashine, the colors you see are blue, then indigo, then violet. Why? Not sure.
---
Well just how the game is though I grinded caps initially under the thought that caps were king. I mean they also added player vendors to eliminate some grind.
---
I think most people do check and are at or near the cap limit.
---
Yep. Passed thunder mountain
---
Yup, thats the one thing I was worried about but figured the chances were low. if I do small drops on the coins I can help minimize the risk.
---
and the whiny pvpers downvoted you.
---
I agree with this BUT I've only rolled 3*** ranged three times and gotten really good rolls two of those times. So it may be worth the risk.
---
If you were at grafton steel yard I'm sorry it was a rough evening
---
I don‚Äôt use inverted, I‚Äôm talking about the logic behind why some people do
---
Very true, though I did count pixels for an endanger oil stringer and concluded it had zero effect.
---
Energy plant on the pad... get close to it and take the pic...
---
Done my guy
---
People aren't going to always upvote/downvote for rational reasons.
---
That I could see happening a la static junk items. Makes more sense in terms of server performance and gives builders more options.
---
Probably as a drop from enclave events.
---
2\* is the fastest way.  I've gotten lots of explosive weapons from the purveyor by only picking 2\* stuff. Once in awhile I gamble on 3\* but 2\* is the way to go imo.
---
If the purveyer‚Äôs underground tunnels can lead to the mole miner city underground!
---
Servers definitely vary in a variety of ways.  I'll find a "hot" server where the legendary drops at the Whitespring flow like candy.  Some servers just throw mountains of enemies at you during events while others are like kill one thing and wait 3 minutes for the next one to show up.
---
I've done silo runs where the robots pop out of their pods one after the other, and other runs where we kill maybe a 2-3 dozen at most.  The size of the party doesn't seem to matter.  I've gotten swarmed while solo and alternately had nothing to do but look at my instagram with three other friends involved.
---
I find that quality/kindness level of players seems to diminish significantly on Saturdays and Sundays, especially during mid-day hours in the US.  I'm imagining all the bored, angry teens in the United States log in then just to mess with people.  They tend to opt for the low hanging fruit of sucker punching people in adventure mode.
---
Yes it is
---
If you're sick of hopping just buy one. I bought the forest scout mask for 500 caps
---
I haven't tested it out or anything but I was considering a Nocturnal build (for evening obviously) and switch to a Berserker's weapon during the day time. You could just add a stealth aspect to it for more damage etc. Probably not OP, but it sounds fun to me.  
---
It's amusing that there are still several posts talking about Bloodied builds.
---
"Show damage numbers" GIMME DAT BORDERLANDS FEEL! LOVE THAT SHIT! &lt;333
---
ohhhhhhhh, well same answer hahaha
---
I kid, im sure youre a wonderful person
---
The way of gambling essentially :p
---
I just figure if your after a specific thing, more rolls could help. Or luck comes in, throws all of that logic out, and drops something bad ass first try.
---
+karma
---
What are you going to do when you're a low-effort content creator? You're certainly not going to pull in the dollars with quality and thoughtful content.
---
Somebody in my usual team found a stack of 30 of them at a vendor the other day and bought them all. 
---
We messed around with them a little bit but nobody really was too excited about them in the end. When we are doing an event someone usually has Team Medic shared so we all just use the three of them up to get the ask out challenge done.
---
"Didn't get what they paid for" is a laughable stretch.  People weren't paying $200 for a fucking canvas bag, it was for the power armor helmet.  The bag was just latched onto and turned into a massive deal because people love to bitch about things.  If you went to your average outraged youtuber's comment section and asked the seething masses what actually came with this edition of the game they likely wouldn't know shit beyond the fucking canvas bag.
---
Have you tried to ask in-game with a mic?
---
I normally play solo, but a guy came to me while I was working in my CAMP and asked me if I could help him with the revive thing, and I did. I know many people will do the same without expecting some kind of reward.
---
Personally I managed to do it when a low level got downed in the Whitespring.
---
You know, you could just report them for abuse. I'm sure that slinging N's and F's freely is going to be frowned upon by Bethesda.
---
Flair checks out
---
I met a level 9 today and gave him 15 stimpacks and 15 super stimpacks. Also made him a level 15 fully modded handmade rifle. Showed him how to make ammo and gave him a couple bobbleheads.
---
What's your level? Most of the folks I play with don't mind having somebody else around, as long as it's not a squeaker or someone annoying as hell talking about weapon stats all day and telling us how we have to dry a bloody build.
---
I am down.. but probably be another hour before I can get on... 
---
But I need ammo really bad... i guess I better craft that first.
---
&gt; I dunno, most the time people getting into fights are just ~~having fun~~ arseholes.
---
FTFY buddy :)
---
Just do this.  Pick up can do and swap it in when you are out junk hunting.  You will be loaded with canned food.
---
yikes. they can't take no for an answer, huh.
---
If they changed it no one would use armor. Duh. Power armor is niche for specific things. Bringing them up to par with legendary effects would only make regular armor pointless except for unarmed.  And if you retort with ‚Äúnot all legendary effects, only some‚Äù I‚Äôll refer you to wood armor that can‚Äôt even keep its stars. Worthless whining
---
just play it on loop
---
U can ask here.. Or market place. I found a person in a similar predicament and we helped each other
---
 You need not be present to win, though it helps w/ making a speech. :) You just need to have an HOA CAMP eval prior to the end date.
---
Depends on level, I have three characters, one 48, one 27 and one 12 that I just started. I‚Äôll probs be playing on the 12 because it‚Äôs the most recent character I‚Äôve started
---
Lol copy paste fail
---
You've got time to get the new one tip top and get an HOA eval.
---
We'll be the judge of that.
---
Wait- you want notes to be *harder* to read?  Am I reading that right?  :p
---
Also, the 20s are a tough transition time (just like real life). If you‚Äôre on ps4 and want to grind a bit with someone else, let me know
---
I really like the recipe list feature as well... reminds me what I need to grab for what when I do a shopping trip
---
Currently, a Twitter DM to us is required, as it puts you in our queue, but we won't be locked to Twitter forever.
---
Great idea, ok thank you!
---
Are you on PC? Do you happen to have mod installed? Or what are your settings at?
---
Only children would be expected to be so unruly.
---
Ok had to run away. Ran out of stimpacks and attacked by Scorchedbeast
---
&gt;Currently, a Twitter DM to us is required, as it puts you in our queue, but we won't be locked to Twitter forever.
---
It‚Äôs not console specific correct?
---
I got a lot of good low level legendaries through doing the horde missions in the forest, ash heap, and savage divide
---
Ask people or activate Encryptid.
---
Not at all. We can currently do live HOA evals on both consoles, and accept video tour submissions from PC, but we're working on being on all 3 systems soon.
---
Those are all nice and things I carry on my bloody heavy/melee. I use melee to one shot things, the rifle for scorched beasts and the 50 cal mainly for the queen or large crowds. Explosive shotguns or anything explosive is usually useful in pvp.
---
You‚Äôre a hero honestly saw graham all the time when the game launched started a new character haven‚Äôt seen him in 3 months I wanted his shiny disco balls so bad. Can‚Äôt thank you enough
---
A bit harder yea hah. Just a thought, maybe real implementation would make me change my mind. I read them fine now, my thought is that everythings been on the ground for awhile, maybe have a note in pieces and picking them up puts it together like a puzzle. Idk, different aint always good but its always good to think of something different. And im pc unfortunately.
---
I'm so glad I've wiped him off the face of my Youtube feed. Have not missed him at all.
---
It would probably make more sense to do the contest through reddit, as a lot of people really don't like using Twitter.
---
Awesome! Do you have a discord group for PC?
---
What system?
---
Message and add NO UR A T0W3L. Careful with the spelling.
---
We have well over a thousand followers, all actual 76 players, and that's where the HOA started, but this post is proof we're trying to detach from Twitter exclusively.
---
Activate encrypted. You‚Äôll get a revive in water, so it‚Äôs a 2 for one
---
Thanks bud! Much appreciated :)
---
A lot of the raider's play on PvP servers but when on adventure mode when we see a workshop for the taking why not contest it üòÅü§£ü§£
---
Honestly this doesn't sound fitting at all, it's an 8 minute song that doesn't fit alongside a lot more faster catchier songs.
---
Agree on the 2* choices. The minor effect of the third star doesn‚Äôt justify the cost doubling IMO.
---
We have a general Discord, but our founders are old men. We're still learning how to maximize our tech. :) https://discordapp.com/channels/545243154660589599/545243155113443339
---
1) Ehh, I pick all locks and leave doors open. If camp is locked and they aren't there going afk, all lights get turned out, signs turned off, fertilizer and dirty water left in the bed and all doors and shutters are opened.
---
Camps can't be destroyed so why lock'em? We want to see your camp. Maybe for inspiration. Maybe for enjoyment. Many reasons why people want in the camp. I usually have someone waiting to kill me for when I get wanted and they just give the caps back and I replace any ammo.
---
2) my floating camp is b-e-a-utiful. Prove me wrong. It's held up by a staircase and 4 support beams attached to foundation so it looks like it's floating but isn't.
---
3) agreed. Make em easy to find. Left many camps just because I didn't feel like running in circles. Leave signs or the vault boy pointing or something telling us where they are.
---
4) thanks.
---
mfw no all of the above option for the future content question
---
I am ps4 and my video output settings are:
---
Resolution: 1920x 1080 60Hz
---
Color format: RGB (HDR)
---
Wont do much for pc guys but maybe help a fellow ps4
---
I‚Äôd totally join if it were a subreddit or discord group.  Maybe a guild/clan in the future....
---
It gives you like 1.5 atoms
---
What if there's only enclosed walls and no door at all? ü§î
---
You‚Äôre unhappy about a feature you don‚Äôt have to use?
---
Yay! I‚Äôm one of the two people! Can‚Äôt wait for it to finally come.
---
Done! Thank you very much!
---
Just like Ever Upwards.
---
I couldn't agree more, and I'm not huge into Vats - I like old school, before there was even aim-assist. I do use it from time to time though, and for that reason I completely agree - it's kind of a 'seamless gameplay' killer if you ask me... I start fumbling with the controller trying not to die, back pedaling and jumping, wondering why I can't switch - or even stim! - until it dawns on me that I need to exit vats.
---
Showing damage numbers will be so good. It will allow people to put really numbers to their ingame experience instead of really on calculations that may or may not be accurate
---
It should just be the meta for the game. Hah
---
You see it happen surprisingly often. Not sure there's much point though. It doesn't kill the SBQ any faster.
---
Easy to resolve that.  Just make it so each extra card gives 5% more.  Done.  Same thing as leveling them.  Basically keep it the same but just do away with "leveling" up the cards.  Instead you just add cars to the pile.
---
10k on an explosive combat shotgun. It's rubbish. My explosive handmade is way better. To be fair, I had 25k and wanted to get rid some.
---
‰πá‰πÇ„ÑíÂ∞∫ÂçÇ ‰∏Ç‰∏®Âç©Âç©
---
Damn, mines only 5k..,
---
I'm no Knocking you. I'm knocking Bethesda for thinking that a skinner box was end game content and then leaving the back door open for dupers. Now everyone is basically beating the game after a few weeks of play and there is nothing to do.
---
thanks for you responses.
---
The slocum joe in Watoga typically will have a few scattered around the tables and counter inside.
---
Oh I miss the first days of survival where you would get 500 stimpacks and junk galore for every kill.
---
Lol, I understood that refrence
---
Is this something you have to manually change?? I don‚Äôt recall ever doing it. Maybe I don‚Äôt have it on and pants guy caught a stray bullet. It would still have been very obvious that it wasn‚Äôt intentional
---
I‚Äôd just do a quick map check before loggin off. Easy quick way. Also I have the habit of returning home(camp) before quitting too lol. My guy needs his bed after a long session out in the waste
---
I want in! Check out my camp i think its pretty neat. :)
---
I think this is a awesome idea great song should also add big iron by johnny cash always playing it on my spotify
---
I run 20 str , pa, and occasionally I‚Äôll do rusty knuckle attack‚Äôs in t60. 
---
It‚Äôs shit. 
---
I don‚Äôt have all the perks just for unarmed, but I have some for melee, and fists in pa just don‚Äôt cut it
---
Wow that is awesome. I am on PS4 but thank you so much for the offer
---
I got around 20 stockpiled if you want to buy, im on ps4
---
I check to see if someone's using only time I will leave if someone is shopping, os if there's a purchase/trade that is waiting on me that I dont want to lose
---
Take a photo of the various mine deposits.
---
Some call them sleepers. I once spawned at the golf club and every ghoul there was a sleeper, they had me running halfway to the resort before i could thin them out. Truly terrifying, especially for a low health build.
---
Actually be kinda cool to see how DM works for fallout rewards behind it could be cool too
---
Sour, sweet, gone
---
 There are still tons of bugs, they fixed some but new ones come out with every patch. Everything takes so long to load that if you run you have to wait or get killed by invisible enemies. Sometimes the ghouls don't even get up and they attack you when they are in the sleeping position. There is a patch coming soon so hopefully they will fix this.
---
Except what actually had FEV was dispersed into the water in huntersville
---
Cool story bro
---
This is amazing.
---
seems kinda dumb ...when a bug is better than the feature , it made sense if my weapon is properly maintained it should be sharper or oiled and work better than a highly used rusty pos...
---
Thanks, bro!
---
The thing is, this is not the first time we have launched a nuke. I done my first one by myself and didn‚Äôt really have any issues. When it came time for the wife to do it as part of the story we again managed with no issues. 
---
This server as you said must have been different, it was crazy how many gutsys and assualtrons were attacking in the bunker.
---
Must have just been one of those days
---
So based on these changes, we can assume that from Beth‚Äôs point of view, game is in perfect condition, all that needs attention - some UI tweaks?
---
Yup, this has been known for a long time, but many chose to believe what they want. A few people maxed out their build budget at lvl 2, and then built the exact same structure at lvl 80+. stil maxed out with the same items.
---
Good to have it official though.
---
If I could combine them into creating a scope that would make them less useless
---
Done. Nice to give an opinion in survey form. Well thought out questions and possible answers. Excellent survey. Take my upvote.
---
Takes him to whitespings, then drops a nuke
---
We didn‚Äôt invite him to team. Someone in an earlier post mentioned the pacifist mode and if that‚Äôs something you manually have to do then I don‚Äôt think I ever have. Maybe he caught an unintentional stray bullet and decided he was going to kill us for his own amusement
---
Yep, but I'm currently in an argument with someone so figured I'd get an official statement and share for all to know.
---
Debate is over, lol.
---
i am not a clever man
---
Exactly!
---
Lol it really was. I am on PS4 but I bought a few from a vending machine for a 100 caps. Thank you so much for the offer, I really appreciate
---
And only one choice for favorite. It took me as long as all the other questions combined to decide.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of info for us to help
---
Most of the stuff I sell is (semi rare) outfits, cheap plans (all mine are 1/5 of the listed price), cheap bobble heads, stealthboys, flux and magazines.
---
I only buy plans and ammo. 
---
I do sometimes buy leg weapons and armor if they‚Äôre super cheap for scrapping for scrip.
---
If you manage to get the face right, let us know!
---
I also think BR is a much better game mode the traditional Deathmatch. Dying and respawning over and over has never been my cup of tea.
---
Are you on a Ps4 Pro?
---
That's a damned bummer.  Was it a player vendor, or a bot vendor?  Hoping there's a difference.
---
Wait, what, where have you read this?
---
Yeah sorry it‚Äôs the padded blue jacket but it‚Äôs named the surveyor outfit
---
The thing is, pants guy never launched a nuke. Just killed me whilst I was at the keypad and then turned and killed the wife and left
---
You have 3 options: leave it, correct the name, or change it to something else. With limited info and no pictures it's hard to tell what you want us to do/say.
---
Yeah sorry it‚Äôs the padded blue jacket but it‚Äôs called the surveyor outfit
---
Good advice.  I've seen others saying that footlockers in general seem to have a healthy rate, and I'm sure some are more reliable than others.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I can't understand making a shared world fallout game where you don't have the freedom to attack other players. Thought it was bizarre the moment I heard about the slap system. I guess we all have different points of view.
---
All scorched creatures count as humanoid for cannibal for some reason
---
The wife is actually the bigger gamer of the two of us aswell. I watched her play hours of FO4 and I never had any interest. I watched her play FO76 for a few hours and got really intrigued to play, now I play it more than she does lol.
---
Pity your husband isnt into it so you can play together
---
Yes, it is normal. If you get a 3 Star assaultron head you must scrip it immediately. It's the same with wood armor.
---
There's a bug with some legendary tags
---
This would look sick as a small poster on my wall with all my other Fallout stuff I got.
---
Anything that‚Äôs scorched can be eaten
---
Sent you message I am on early
---
From a player. With all the bugs in this game and surrounding the challemges, it's possible I experienced a bug. I'll check again tonight if I can find one in a vendor.
---
That's very odd
---
Thanks for confirming my suspicion though.
---
I‚Äôm down
---
I agree, changing the crosshair to more of a dot is one of the first things I mod in previous fallout games.
---
Mhm, I saw that
---
Thanks for the answer too.
---
Kind of creepy that it works that way.
---
The only real thing that is sorta kinda not really interesting about a fo76 br mode is the fact that you have these wildly divergent potential character builds thanks to SPECIAL and perks.  Every other BR out there is way more FPS with at most a few classes but you are playing a prebuilt class with little or zero way to customize it in many cases.  
---
So fo76 with it's more rpg oriented character system is a bit of a twist a lot of hardcore BR players have never contended with.  
---
Having said all of that, the main problem with any competitive mode in fo76 is that the designers clearly are not expert in PvP game design or balance and it shows.    
---
The fact that they were surprised by ass/sent gear dominating in PvP just shows they didn't really take a PvP metagame approach to fo76 in the first place, as does the fact it's so easy to 1 shot players using the crit aimbot which is just laughable PvP game design.  
---
For PvP to ever be a thing that's worthwhile in fo76 they need to make VATS work differently vs players if not remove it entirely vs players and basically start over with the weapons and armor you can acquire.  The current gear is balanced towards PvE and it's fine for that application but there's too much of a haves vs have nots issue with long term players rocking full sets of ass/sent and similar.
---
Im with you, mate. Used to run vampire buzzblade, too; now it rusts away in stash. Shame.
---
Like others I map check if I‚Äôm not home. Would be nice but I think they have bigger fish to fry.
---
Oh yes
---
Damn you had a bos jumpsuit in the vendor? Vending been good noticed, maybe new players in the game.
---
Just completed.
---
I think there focusing a lot on the pvp aspect so they can get this game more inline with with their other mmo eso so theres a good amount of faction pvp to do along with the pve
---
I only ever buy stable flux and ammo. If I need/want anything else I use the market place.
---
Lol what? Yea i had an extra one and hunter coat. Its been in there foe a while no one wabted it. Plus i had it in tgere for like 6k to see if itd sell...and...it did..at tge worst possible momebt
---
Nope. The original and I really should upgrade. I have a 4k tv @ 120hz
---
Who got the answer to number 3?
---
You gotta keep doing these and sharing the results
---
Been working fine for me from the get go, PA was the first things I named
---
Are you naming individual pieces?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bx3tjj/furious_mechanics_testing_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
You can do this. Same as with your weapons or armor. I have 4 sets no issues selecting the wrong set
---
as long as i can scrap and stash i dont care if a house is locked,  but  if i haul ass to a house and they have a bad selection of items and no work bench to scrap at and  im overencumbered you best believe im going to a silo after i unload my junk.
---
I sell ammo and harder to find plans for than anything. Usually 5.56, .308 and fusion rounds.
---
I always thought they just meant edible plants. Lol
---
I go with three star (and thus fewer) or else my stash weight becomes even more unmanageable.
---
I have a few machines running I sell random legendaries I get, rare outfits, plans and some ammo
---
I mostly buy junk, legendaries for scrip and plans I don‚Äôt have tho I‚Äôm pretty close to getting most of them
---
Who would the target be? We're only after worthwile targets, but if yours is such, my group is one of worlds finests.
---
Pretty much everywhere there would be food in the old world has a chance at dog food.  So restaurants, diners, etc.  Also placing your camp near a good spot will result in dog food piling up.  
---
ex: I'm leveling an alt and at my level the big bend tunnel is a good spot for me so my camp is right by the west entrance.  There's a raider camp that routinely spawns 2-4 dog food and the trip through the tunnel usually nets another 2 or 3.  That character is literally swimming in dog food but it's acquired over time as opposed to all at once.  
---
Lastly there's a lot you can do to passively increase your dog food by consuming less: use the perk to increase the benefit of dog food plus the perk that makes food satisfy you more.  combined 1 can will give you like 70% of your food bar, so you will hardly eat anything and thus it will pile up faster.  Just de-equip those perks after you eat if you need the slots for something else after you are done eating.
---
Sounds like you suffer from anxiety. Welcome to the club
---
My Sheepsquatch shards do a TON of damage. I killed my friend by accident trying to test the damage. I'd love it if there were perks for throwing weapons. 
---
My only gripe is third person makes no sense where the projectile goes. You have to have that "fire in the hole" perk to see where it'll land and it still doesnt account for vast distances with throwing knifes.  No long distance KOBE's with throwing knifes any time soon.
---
So I was wrong, it isn't just form the assassins prefix, I got a mutant slayers with poison resist and it shows as a poisoners.
---
I don't know what the conditions are, you are the most correct on this one.
---
I check my map as well. I frequently will be shopping and the player leaves the world.
---
Okay. I will wait until that day comes then.
---
I have a bashing shotgun that one shots most things in the forest with a bash. It's not the worst you just are never going to use it in a real fight. Maybe to push ghouls off you.
---
Haha hell yeah, time to go Serum shopping!
---
I also don't have twitter. If I learn to make videos, and make a video, may I ask one of my fellow redditors who does do the tweet thing to bump me onto that list?
---
You can def name it, you have to name the pa chassis then add the armour parts too it. Well that's how I did it anyway.
---
You can build underwater!!!?
---
Waste of atoms, free or otherwise.
---
Mats are by no means rare, may take some time but easily done. Once or twice I've found myself with a broken gun, missing mats...juat grab another weapon &amp; go find the requisite materials.
---
I have used a few improved kits at SBQ, TSE Handmade breaks every now &amp; then fighting her. But same time I've got 2 other ranged &amp; a backup melee. Could easily get by without, but I've got 16 taking up stash may as well.
---
Im naming the chassis with the armor on it. I have 5 sets and they all get mixed up. My raider and t-51 will and excavator and x01 pieces keep switching spots.. its rather annoying really. Also. Im on PC I'm not sure if that'll play a difference.
---
I just realized it kind of sounded wrong for me to ask what your level was. It's just so I know if I've got good stuff I can give you or not. Most of us are in the high one hundreds or low 200 but you're more than welcome to join up. I know I'll be on for a while tonight and I've got some plans I need to drop to somebody.
---
TEH RED ZMAN
---
I had it drop at the fort defiance event recently.
---
I never buy chems, I always seem to collect too much anyway. Plans no, haven't seen any in a vendor I didn't already know. 
---
I do look at armor and weapons if they are 3* or a good deal in my opinion. Most of the time I'll just buy legendaries to scrip.
---
The fake curse wrecked my fucking brain
---
No problem, thank you again!
---
If you're falling through the map, check your ini file. A search on here will come up with posts about it.
---
You don't have to buy atoms in order to get them.  You can get them by doing things in game.  So playing the game and getting something isn't cheating.
---
How often do you need to repair away from a workshop?  I have more improved repair kits from queen fights and while I do pack them just in case, I still haven't had  a need to use one.
---
My husband and I are aging Gen X‚Äôrs who refuse all forms of social media except Reddit. I‚Äôd still like you to check out our home though. Can we still be eligible?
---
He's gonna be so pretty. Trust me. Lady boners beware.
---
Well now we will know if damage just stops applying with the numbers.
---
They're MEANT to take time to do.   They didn't create this content for you to breeze through in a weekend.
---
Idk I feel like it takes away from the fun .. just like in gta when you die for the first time it shows you a little video clip lol . That‚Äôs what I was thinking of when doing this .
---
They‚Äôre read/white, brown/dark grey and yellow/greyish blue. All different shapes.
---
Currently wearing the red one with heavy bos combat armour.
---
I will try to name it first. I name mine like "Armor Chassis \[insert name here\]" I wonder if keeping parts of the same name is getting some kind of mix up. its also very possible I'm just stupid, but Ive tested it with multiple Power Armor sets. it always pulls out the wrong one
---
Very nice keep up the good work
---
Geez are they more common now or something? I would have bought that before I even looked at the price =\]
---
Pls add FOV slider to console
---
Yeah, but Bev E. Ridge would have worked just as well, if not better. :)
---
Are you that guy in  IRL Ohio who has a compound he calls Fort Kickass?
---
Once we could name things it took me a while to work out the pa. Mine are just simply named excavator and t60. Like I said I stripped all the armour parts off first, named the bare chassis then put the relevant parts back on. There may be an easier way though....
---
lol!!!!!
---
I've never bought them from the Atom shop and never will. Having said that, the option is there and some people are going to take advantage of it, no matter what I think about it.  In short, it doesn't matter if I think it's cheating or not. It's there and people are going to do it.
---
My guys have done it a few times, not at prime tho. We've had all 3 land within 1 second and the server held. 
---
I honestly think the worst place to nuke is whitesprings. That place is just crap for stability during a nuke.

You're Welcome, hope your junk sells. ^_^

It scales to your level . He'd need to be 45+ to get it maxed level
---
Wouldn‚Äôt a Recon Scope do the trick?
---
Damn good post, this guy has his s*** together!
---
I kind of doubt that. Power armor is loud, movement is more clunky, etc. Since, as you've already stated, the actual armor on power armor doesn't mean anything in pvp, why would someone automatically want to use power armor which is so much more easily spotted?
---
Ricky... that's not very good. Use space words, real ones, not talking about space weed.
---
Tell ya what, we're gonna change the rules a little bit here. A lot of Redditors are acting like Twitter killed their father, and as such, we'd like to invite those of you who would like an HOA eval to PM us here. This is a huge change from HOA policy, just for you all, and we expect a certain level of gratitude. :)
---
I got the atom store ones and still like the in game with the surgical mask equipped as well. Color matches well.
---
Because going to the same places over and over and over again, doing the same things when you're there, it gets very boring.
---
What happened with fr0g building your camp? I read that yesterday
---
Honestly i dont know. I know ive seen more since the vending started...before that i havent seen any. But still i obly ever saw 3 and bought 2 of em lol
---
Buy another account.
---
never had this problem i have 5 sets all renamed
---
I'm looking for people to journey with too you wanna team up?
---
That's kind of part of the game? 
---
The pro of it, you're not spending a shit ton of caps.
---
Cons: repetition 
---
So whatever floats your boat I guess
---
No, because it's always level 50 regardless of the level of the character that acquires it.
---
Aw, I'm on ps4, but I build camps all the time for people and only charge in materials I'm lacking. I would love to build a camp for you, sorry we are on different systems. If you don't find someone on pc, I could always send you some tips and tricks for building :)
---
Just getting some more ideas, probably will going with him.
---
my lvl 30ish character got a lvl 50 weapon.
---
*puts on Unyielding set*
---
This dude needs to go outside.
---
You bet it! GT in the original post
---
I selected "Confiscate the property by force and leave him there as punishment"
---
What thing is that?
---
I'm taking your name. I already have 2 more people willing to do just that. A group of 6 would be best to reach at least lvl 2 in each lab and keep them alive. We don't use mic but it doesn't take many texts to tell who goes where.
---
Than you. The brown one was perfect. The grey and brown fit perfect with the longcoats color.
---
that should be nerfed eventually
---
Just a synergy of effects that results in good air time
---
Unfortunately you have to quit to main menu to fix it. That's the only way I can fix my FDC when it bugs out.
---
Never though of the surgical mask. Wish there was a rebreather ala New Vegas that i could put on with it
---
I have bird bones and a jet pack. How does one achieve this synergy of which you speak? :)
---
It would be nice if Bethesda made a change so that a customer couldn't buy the item if it put the seller over the cap limit. This is one reason I limit the amount of stuff I sell in my vendor.
---
the earth is flat ass-hats will still fight this one. you can not fix stupid but you can duct-tape its mouth shut.
---
This idea would work good due to Bethesda ‚Äútax‚Äù as the seller losses 10% anyways. Why not allow the buyer to potentially bargain the prices down by 10%. Would make hard bargain and grape mentats worth while again.
---
Damn. Thats frustrating. Thanks man.
---
I like the military aesthetic. Thank you for sharing!
---
No drink animation or sitting in chairs!
---
What's your IGN, so I can snag one off of you?
---
Cool my GT is the same as here I'll friend you later
---
Haha, I don‚Äôt think my box house and generator shed has a chance.
---
"I'm a nuke in the rad wind." --Hoban "Wash" Washburne
---
Nooo not at all
---
I'd say congrats?
---
Ah well gl! Post some pictures, like to see what a bought house looks like
---
This is actually true. I sat in a chair on my rifleman when looting a ghoul, got mobbed by 3 more ghouls. Dead. Bag fell through chair. Loot gone forever.
---
Try the flamer mod if you haven't yet. It's also boosted by rifle perks. It's short range but does good damage and it's fun to use.
---
Tbh i would be bored to tears of all weapons after playing that much. I am really enjoying the mole miner gauntlet atm, I've always played melee but just started messing with the gauntlets. With 40% swing i feel like some kind of vicious....wolverine  running around scratching everything to death. 
---
My go to move is running up behind an enemie and jumping high up in the air then hitting them right as i come down. I call it the stanky gank, because its so dirty.
---
I know. I just never know WHAT‚ÄôS going to sell so I list everything.
---
Added, see you there
---
Me too body
---
So I just direct message a video of my build to the Twitter to get an evaluation? Is that right?
---
yes this has happened to me pretty frequently since that last server maintenance.
---
Dammit I was going to say this exact thing
---
I second the no. 
---
I've tried.
---
My understanding is that they always drop at max level. For those few weeks where everybody was getting them I saw dozens in vending machines. All max level.
---
It doesnt scale lmao
---
Sometimes you get even luckier and get a drill
---
its random whether it works or not. there is more then enough food and water that it doesn't really matter.
---
i get enough ragstag meat and nuka colas that i don't really run out.
---
Only if you're PC. Otherwise, have us out! We're pro's at this. :)
---
i have to keep stuff like aluminium, screws too stimpaks and radaway so cheep they sell,  i make more selling just to the bots. hell i got fusion cores at 60 caps i have had 20 in there for over a week now and at 3KG each there going in the ohio river very soon.
---
Damage Resistance is not the same thing as damage taken.
---
It's not just torso, it's all Trapper stuff. IDK if it just has "low" hp but similar length bars seem to last longer on other pieces
---
I disagree, this wasn't a kneejerk reaction.
---
I ordered the Collectors Edition, a canvas bag was promised. What I got was a nylon bag (which has held up well, but the canvas bag they showed was far better looking) and then Bethesda tried to erase evidence that the bag was meant to be canvas, from their advertisements and from documentation.
---
I didn't get mad or throw fits, but when you're promised something, usually you should get what you're promised. The insulting 500 Atoms as compensation and Bethesda pretending there was a canvas shortage just caused this to snowball.
---
That said, I'm glad I'm getting the bag. Was wondering what was up, its been 6 months.
---
Before you quit if you liked the server, find a name or 2 that are joinable on the server you are on. Dont think recent players will save you as it tends to go down or not update
---
It happened to me during the Sheepsquatch final event, and a couple times during the Campfire tales event, as well as some other ones I can't remember.
---
It's getting exhausting watching other people reap their rewards while I sit there dead hoping there's some way to still get the rewards.
---
Lol no, I saw a cardboard fort named Fort Kickass in a mem a while back. No idea who you're even talking about but I'm about to Google him.
---
I'm sure your right, tbh.  Workarounds in general have been really hard to find in this game - this engine is just cooked.
---
Ty for helping out, though.
---
Thumbs up Krieger.
---
I like mine but sadly I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good enough to compete
---
Ok I am on Xbox.i send a DM to set up a showing then?
---
Done. Pretty cool!
---
You're looking for perks and mutations and legendary effects that all do similar things. Or complementary things.
---
Mutations and Perks that apply to the weapon type you're using. A legendary effect on that weapon that matches your perks.
---
Your build is a combination of your play style, your gear and your stats/perks/mutations. It's as much about what your willing to give up as what you want to get.
---
Intelligence is my highest stat and that gives me the perks to avoid weapons breaking too fast for my liking. But it means I had to take away points from other places that would have allowed me to do more damage. Or share higher level perks with team mates. Or whatever.
---
Then just have the HOA eval it. You can still get the HOA "Approved" seal on a pic of your CAMP, and that's pretty cool, right?
---
&gt; Nowadays it's just getting oneshot by the Bloodied sniper you never saw because he's crouched in a bush and invisible. 
---
Sounds like playing Destiny 2 PVP! Supposedly they normalize damage and resistance across all levels of players, but if you have a weapon with a special effect, or a high-level character power... well, I am a lowbie, and I don't have that stuff! I played PvP for about 10 minutes and quit when I realized how outclassed I was. 
---
As long as there is any kind of gear discrepancy, or access to mutations and perks, FO76 will have the same problems and deathmatch would still only be fun for elder players.
---
Exactly right, Muchacho!
---
I always thought it scaled, my bad
---
I forgot Archer did it too, love that show.
---
If something is too fun in this game Bethesda either fix‚Äôs it or needs it
---
¬°Gracias, papi!
---
Fucking chair
---
I‚Äôd say depends on what your spec is.
---
For instance getting 90% WR for rifle spec is pretty nice. 15% faster vats crit not bad as well.  Always the chance of the whammy (40% bash) but for the most part the 3rd tier isn‚Äôt too bad.
---
Also on recycling, cost of a junk 3* is really 60.  Cost of a junk 2* is 45 (these are 60 right?  Honestly only go 3*)
---
Side note: i know it wasn‚Äôt a player who bought out everything because my caps were the same
---
I have mine set up like that, with a keypad on the outside (and the code posted on the wall) and a siren connected to the door to act as a sort of doorbell.
---
agree, the flamer is really fun.  it's a cool weap.
---
How can we tag them?
---
Good ideas
---
I think Nuclear Winter (soon^^^TM) will change things up
---
Most notable, the prestige system to unlock ‚Äòabilities‚Äô after L50
---
These pictures are like Fallouts infinty stones and i cant wait to have them all!
---
Amazing work and super stoked for the rest!
---
How do evals work? Does someone just come through and look at the CAMP, do I need to talk to them on mic?
---
Can't argue with that, lol.
---
I thought pvp wasn't an option until lvl 2?
---
Yes actually I am because the power armor edition cost me one week's worth of pay so yeah, I better get what I fucking paid for.
---
(And before anyone tells me to get a better job, I've since quit that job and am back in school for my MBA in finance where we learned that not staying true to your advertising is the opposite of what you should do. A basic lesson Bethesda had to learn the hard way, apparently.)
---
You have to get the killshot.
---
what kind of armor do u have for weight reduction? that Traveling Pharmacy may be a waste of STR.
---
i personally try to keep chem levels where i just have enough to play another day. when it comes to most chems and scrap there is no point on holding on to things for the future. some yes, most no.
---
This happens to me on xbox. And I noticed it only happens when I boot up the game after it didnt close out completely prior. Example, I went to take a shit yesterday and only went to xbox menu. I go back to boot up fallout, it says you've been disconnected from servers. It logs back in. I enter world. And this glitch happens. 
---
But I'm pooping now. I completely closed the game instead of just going to xbox home. So when I start it back up the weight reductions will work. 
---
Basically, completely close out the game/application when you're done instead of it idling in background. And it boots up completely fresh each time without that big. For me, at least.
---
I should be on in a few hours if not I'll be on tomorrow, so what do you want to do? Quests, legendary hunting, looting etc.
---
Evals are done live on HOA TV, (twitch.tv/WastelandEstatesHOA), and yes, you'll need a mic. We often discuss ideas, likes, dislikes with the owner, and it's impossible to do a true eval without a mic. But don't worry, we're very cool people, laid back, you don't need to speak more than you feel compelled to. WE are the show, not you. Check out some of our past eval tours on the HOA TV link above.
---
Cash could have a whole DLC, Don't Bring Your Guns to Town... Folsom Prison Blues, Hung my head.
---
That is gonna be hard
---
It would likely sell really well cause it would be impossibly rare.
---
Was this even a question?  This is the first I've heard of it.
---
Also, budget "increases" happened when some bugs were fixed that had resulted in hidden and/or unusable pieces in the Stored tab.  I had a large water purifier stuck there for a long time that I couldn't scrap, along with turrets and generators that vanished when my camp got blueprinted.  You know, back when that was a thing.
---
Challenges are counted across characters minus the level up challenges.
---
Example, collect 760 caps in the mire. Do it on 1 character and it's complete for all characters under that account.
---
So, complete it in one character and it's completed across all but the reward is only obtained once.
---
Because Biv don't share his private stash with \*nobody.\*
---
This is great but.... why not add better sights to the 10mm sub while your at it.
---
I wish I could upvote this harder!
---
oof
---
Treasure maps I sell at 25 each. Sell quick. 
---
Only ammo ever sold at 1 cap is 556.  Agree it needs to be bulkable. 
---
Bulk junk (useful junk) sells at 20 - 30 for me. Any higher no chance. 
---
Flux even 40 is a rare purchase. 
---
I'm on xbox.
---
It‚Äôs easy to get a full house when you stack the deck in your favor!
---
They give me something to spend Atoms on. So I like them.
---
The entire point of the tax is to remove caps from the game to stabilize the economy. Any change that reduces these losses defeats that purpose.
---
Bethesda will not change this. Honestly, i bet they would eliminate the Travel Agent perk if it wouldn‚Äôt results in outrage.
---
Happened to me and I could only fast travel to 76 but it wouldn‚Äôt let me because I was over-encumbered. Couldn‚Äôt respawn couldn‚Äôt FT. Had to reset the game. Quite an inconvenience.
---
Or all walls are just doorways with locked doors!
---
No issue here.  You're likely naming the wrong one. If you put them back one at a time. Name the one you scooped.  Then scoop another to name.  You'll know for sure you named it right. If you try to track order they go into inventory you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Really, I just wanna have fun and do stuff, there‚Äôs the pioneer scout stuff I wanna get done, so there is that
---
I wanted to kill her the moment she spoke. Stupid Amethyst from Rebecca Sugars stupid ass show.
---
Just look at them through a recon scope.  Or the pearly peepers, which are recon binocs.  When you look directly at something for a second or two that way, it tags them with a diamond pip on the compass and the HUD.  Recon Sensors mod for power armor helmets works the same way, except with any ranged weapon.
---
Yeah I just did that. I‚Äôll update if anything goes weird again. Maybe I am just stupid. Lmao
---
I'm going to start carrying orbital strike beacons for these occasions.
---
Oh my guard, the water purifiers... the day I logged on and saw they fixed it was a memory that will last a lunchtime.
---
I've seen some people with the over encumbered issue, mine's a little different in that I'm not over encumbered and I'm not given an option to see the map at all no matter what button. Needs to be addressed both ways.
---
Thanks a lot. I have familiar with that scope but dont know pearly peepers. Glad to know
---
Hyperbuff the damage and nerf its durability. Make em short life glass cannons imo. A good way to balance them and if people want to abuse them the need repair kits or multiple.
---
Anybody that thinks these are paytowin is a moron
---
How is any of this "dumbing down" the game?
---
&gt;Showing weapon damage
---
I don't particularly care for the floating numbers, but a lot of people do, and it'll make things a bit more transparent for people who are trying to test weapon mods and legendary effects. 
---
&gt;KEEP YOUR WEAPONS DRAWN
---
Animation canceling doesn't in any way dumb down the game. IT will make skilled players who can take advantage of it a bit better at combat than they already are, but it doesn't make things easier for people who don't use it.
---
&gt;TAKE AIM WITH CONFIDENCE
---
The delay on scopes/ADS is excruciating if you've played any competitive FPS games in the last 20 years. Reducing the delay between pushing a button and being able to see down the scope is great change.
---
As for adding target reticles for things like the harpoon gun and broadsider, those should have been in the game from day one. If this is what you mean by dumbing down the game I guess it'll make things slightly easier on people because they'll be able to see exactly where the cannonball will fly, but again it's somethings that should have been in the game from the beginning.
---
&gt;RUN AND GUN
---
Again, animation canceling doesn't make things "easier", it sinply makes things more fluid and faster paced for people who know how to do it. 
---
&gt;FINE TUNE YOUR VIEW
---
Being able to fine took X and Y sensitivity independently is also something that should have been included since day one. Adding it now is "better late than never", but I don't see how it dumbs anything down.
---
In conclusion, your rant makes no sense, everyone in the room is now dumber for having read it, I grant you no points, and may god have mercy on your idiotic soul.
---
Yeah me too I've just started that can't wait to get my backpack
---
Please god
---
This thread kind of makes me want to build a camp with as many small houses as possible, empty, but with locked doors.
---
Well that‚Äôs just impossible
---
I wasn‚Äôt really complaining. It‚Äôs still extremely grindy. Especially when spawns seem to break on the current badge you‚Äôre on for finding animals or whatever requires finding some animal or creature. At least they did for me when it came to finding a wolf. Every known location I went to they would never show. Quests involving them wouldn‚Äôt start or they would be absent. Now THAT was quite irritating. I think I finally just got lucky and found a pack attacking someone‚Äôs camp. And then it was a rush to kill one before the turrets did. I was so glad to finally kill a wolf with a knife. 
---
I was never expecting a breeze. Actually I was pleasantly surprised that it IS so involved. Makes the reward that much sweeter. 
---
So yeah, I was definitely curious about someone claiming they had nothing to do basically. Because there is sooo much to do after this first round of DLC.
---
Also trading posts aren‚Äôt allowed on this sub
---
Crops in the wild are instanced. Crops in a CAMP are shared.
---
See! Miniguns need to be buffed they can't even kill a level 1 scorched......
---
Should I make a post for this cause it seems like a lot of ppl agree with me
---
Personally, I will buy every single round of 5.56, .45 or fusion cells I see at 1 cap per round. Not worrying about crafting ammo has made this game 100X more enjoyable for me.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen it but I hate it already
---
Just go to Watoga
---
I hear you for sure. I‚Äôve had that too! Just the most recent iteration was because I was over-encumbered. Not a fun bug
---
No they are not. Anyone can pick your crops... But they grow so fast its a non issue.
---
Unless you were walking out to make vegie starch for a much needed repair. Even then id say "stop right there criminal scum!" Then just walk to the nearest place and get some duct tape.
---
Ash heap is my favorite area and where my camp is
---
This drives me nuts too.
---
Hopefully it doesn't happen as much/gets fixed soon, I love playing events but it's null if we don't get rewards for it.
---
Having worn a jetpack for months, I can say that due to recent changes in fusion core drain, it's not worth having a jetpack unless you're trying to climb somewhere you couldn't normally get to otherwise.  They're a fun novelty, but even when they save your ass by keeping you out of melee range, you'll sacrifice all of your AP in a hurry trying to hover.
---
I wish, but everyone would create a crap ton of characters and have insane amounts of scrip and vendor fodder.
---
Were you playing on xbox? this happened to me on my new character I started for survival.
---
Oh I hate her so bad, and I love it.  She's perfect for what she is.
---
I was pretty happy with wild Appalachia. So the results will probably be that everyone else hated it.
---
Yes. I still see people tell others camp budget increases with level. Had a convo with one today and just wouldn't believe me or any of the websites or YouTube vids. Figured I'd share this for the naysayers.
---
Always bothers me when people come to my shop and spam steal all my crops. I never use them but it just seems rude. We should have some ground rules. Just because it‚Äôs a wasteland doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt be civilized!! (Mostly sarcasm but just because you can take them doesn‚Äôt mean you have to. I don‚Äôt plant many)
---
It all stacks but no one is really sure how high somw say 80%, 85% or 95% but yea it stacks im an aae stealth rifleman
---
In a few months the lvl50 one might be worth something... But everybody and thier dog is getting this weapon. 
---
I did it in 20 mins from vault 76... Waiting for hunger was around 10 mins.
---
We are always looking for new people, we are a multi game server, but most of us play 76, we also have very active voice chats

---
Scroll down to the anti armor section.  Lots of in-depth info there.
---
Slap system was for prevent griefing and a understandable move from the begining - at least also to keep in mind fallout has/had an rp based in the past. Also it was focused on team-play from start less than pvp which was more optional.
---
But since the survival/adventure mode split more folks found their home.
---
Increased budget and larger build range? Yeah you should. Throw in cheaper item materials too
---
I have one in my bag at all times
---
You should have at least 3 luck for bloody Mess 3. Take that off put on can do 3. Run around watoga there are trash cans for searching and just cans of dog food laying around. Make sure to also go onto the civic center and search inside there. More trash cans and food spawns. Don't forget to check the roofs as well. Once you know all the food spawn points and trash cans you'll have a ridiculous amount of dog food.
---
Well I definitely like it. 
---
I watched your videos so far :D
---
It's a known bug. You can scrap immediately for 40 scrip. If you don't, you're hosed. It's happened to me multiple times. A Quad was too good to scrip, so I had to chance it. It's a reliable bug. They report that it'll be fixed in the next patch.
---
&gt; Set a reasonably higher spawn chance of legendaries everywhere.
---
Please, yes. 
---
I am level 37 and I have not picked up a legendary in ... 15 levels? Maybe more. 
---
Strangely I picked up a few legendary armor bits around levels 5-10 *and I am still using them* despite their incredibly low stats, because the cloaking and healing effects are so useful. 
---
Everyone has so many legendaries that Bethesda needed to create a special system to scrap them ... I feel like I am being an idiot by, like, doing missions and wandering around playing the game.
---
They are mostly unnecessary IMO.
---
I have Travelling Leather Coat, I'll send you screenshots and stuff on discord
---
pic or it didn't happen.
---
After reading your post it seems like your biggest complaints had to do with struggling with your equipment. I enjoy this game a lot despite its issues, so I would recommend giving it another shot. If you do, I would suggest following the main story line just for a bit. Its designed to take you places you can handle and gives you useful supplies. Follow it untill you're done with morgantown airport, and I think you will enjoy yourself more. Dont feed the yao guai! That is all.
---
I really miss those days. I was actually pretty decent at PvP back then and thought it was really fun but now it seems the only people looking to fight are only doing so because they know they have a one shot build
---
Still not sure why it's an Int card
---
Just a disappointing choice in my view that goes against the ethos of freedom that fallout is know for, there are many other less draconian ways they could have encouraged and rewarded co operation. I understand what you are saying and what the logic was from Bethesda but I don't agree at all and think the game has suffered for it.
---
Don't forget the overseer ghuls...
---
Wow! Just WOW!!!
---
I understand why they are separated. 
---
One is a detective like quest that you play once, the other one is a replayable end game Event. I can't really remember if you need to win the event to complete the quest because I got a good server and I got it the first time though.
---
Also you can join and play a current Encriptid event without doing the Lying Lowe quest (when the update dropped, the first thing I did was joining the event). 
---
But yeah, they are the same DLC as far as I know so it also could just be a mistake.
---
This reminds me of the ‚Äúthis is fine‚Äù meme.
---
If I could give you a silver I would
---
I think the Disco Ball plans is one of them.
---
Well, if someone upstairs is harping about how freemium games work then they could be implementing more PvP to start dipping into people's competitive nature. Get the bugs ironed out, get people worked up about leaderboards and whatnot, then slowly start introducing p2w items into the atom shop in order to tap into existing (or breed new ones) whales.   
---
I'm not saying anything they've done so far had been leading toward that or has been done with those end goals in mind \~ Just trying to be realistic about game companies and how they seem to work nowadays. It is definitely a possibility.  
---
Love of money. Love of money never changes,
---
Very interesting.  Thanks for that.  It seems I may actually overdo it and could put more perk elsewhere if I use a perforating mod.  I already have an AAE handmade and backup AAE combat shotty
---
It wouldn't be organised like that in a wasteland
---
Sucks, but also makes sense when you think about it.
---
People could easily take advantage and get 5 of them godly weapons to flood market with. We obviously want to avoid these type of situations.
---
Fuckin drill. Why is that still in the legendary loot table? They better have some amazing plan for it, cuz otherwise it's a pretty shitty joke.
---
But can you "bed" them?
---
Sex robots
---
There are 3 things, the entirety of the Lying Lowe quest line, the 4 mini quests that were released at the same time, and the Encryptid. Because they were released at the same time, I would have considered them all one thing.
---
Very true.
---
It's funny that you can say that you enjoyed player vendors the most because of the Lore/ challenge.
---
Other than that I really enjoyed this survey, can wait to see the results.
---
Good point, but also, I think you‚Äôre thinking about it too hard.
---
Lord of the Rings Online had a mpvp "mode" where instead of logging into your normal character, you could log into a "monster" character. That monster character's progress was saved and they could level up somewhat like a normal character. They were restricted to the mpvp (monster player vs player) zone, but at some point there was some kind of dungeon or some such added to that zone  where both sides could enter and harass one another while they raided, so maybe it could be a raid on a vault but similar to a workshop where its open pvp?
---
Side note; I recommend setting your prices to end in ‚Äò9‚Äô when possible. This avoids 1 cap worth of tax to your profit, but then saves your customer 1 cap. 
---
Example:  Magazines, if you sell for 10 caps, you get 9 (1 lost to tax) and the customer spends 10. 
---
If you sell for 9 caps, there‚Äôs no tax loss to you (you end up getting the same amount), but your customer saves 1 cap. 
---
Selling a legendary for 1000; you get 900 caps (10% tax loss), customer spends 1000. 
---
Sell it for 999; you get 900 caps (the tax is 99.9 caps, and doesn‚Äôt round up, so it‚Äôs 99) and the customer pays 999. 
---
It‚Äôs a small touch, but I‚Äôve had customers tell me they appreciate it, once they understand why I‚Äôm pricing like that.
---
Yeah like literally an event where your dude is stripped for the duration...
---
Seriously. Anything by Cash.
---
Endurance allows you to sprint for longer without tiring and increases your disease resistance. Unfortunately it doesn't affect HP.
---
And fix the Misc mods not being able to be applied.
---
Did anyone else notice the one bunny in the back?
---
That sucks
---
I haven‚Äôt bought or used one yet. I was once tempted when my PA legs were broken (I forgot to check how close to 0% I was) and I was suddenly over-encumbered by about 80 pounds. And I had some really good loot. 
---
Luckily, I found a nearby player camp with a PA station after about 10 minutes. Otherwise it was a loooong walk back to my own camp 2/3 across the map away.
---
For the love of all that is user friendly, when I want to build a 4 story apartment style building, why do I have to look up a secret way to finagle the stairs on youtube to get them to work right?!? Seriously!!! Adding damage numbers on hit is amazing and a great step and cool and stuff but goddamnit!
---
Oh OK. 
---
Metal picnic table too I wonder?
---
Since Bethesda updated camps making them invincible it applied over to pvp servers as well. 
---
The only way currently to destroy them is if the camp owner hits you first engaging pvp. 
---
Hopefully we see Bethesda fix this as it‚Äôs ruined survival mode
---
Do you have the plague walker mutation?

Time. Why do people spend money on any convenience?  
---
Why pay to have someone deliver food to you when you could go pick it up instead?  Or better yet, you could instead pick a recipe, buy the ingredients, and cook the food yourself. Or you could pay for a convenience.
---
I think I have a two shot auto grenade launcher I might have to play around with it

happened to me at campfire tales.  just watched as the players picked through my junk on my dead body :(

Flair checks out.
---
To be fair, I don't think I've seen a toilet in a camp besides the odd portable one. Probably something to do with their only being that one broken ceramic one. Squat outside or sit on jagged porcelain?

You can buy the plan from a vendor now.

I have about 50 on me and have never bought one.  Ever.  Just launch nukes!

I do, not sure how I acquired it to be honest but I rarely have any active diseases so it‚Äôs kinda just there in the background not doing anything, since it doesn‚Äôt have any negative effects. Unless I‚Äôm fighting Whitesprings ghouls and they give me a disease or 2. I‚Äôve had this issue without plague walker being active. 
---
Isn‚Äôt there some sort of animation when plague walker actually does damage to an enemy?
---
They need to do like so many other games and have certain weapons do less damage in pvp so they don't fuck up their pve performance. Instead we have things like they are now where literal nukes are weak as shit because if they made them too strong they would destroy people in pvp, which is just stupid. Make explosives really powerful pve how they should be and keep the damage where it's at for pvp it's not that complicated.

i got the recipe from a player vendor after doing the event 5 times with no s'mores recipe. :/
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Nothing makes this game unfun as doing all these holotape quests knowing everyone who voiced them is dead. Everyone. There‚Äôs no other living soul we can save. Worst of all, it tries to draw you in with the ‚Äòfake mystery‚Äô possibility of someone being alive, multiple times. But no, they‚Äôre dead - one way or another.
---
Combined with the complete lack of any hierarchy or organization to rebuild the post apocalyptic world. Which is supposed to be the main quest. It makes everything feels like a lost cause. No wonder everything failed in canon, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre being set up to fail!
---
... and I'm in first place!

Damage numbers are amazing and a huge step in the right direction, but it really really bothers me that I can't build a 4 story camp without finagling the stairs in a bizarre way and being unable to remove floor pieces after doing so! I also can't place objects anywhere near the stairs or they transfer up a floor. Camp construction needs attention badly!!!

I believe she gets "stuck" in a constantly repeating stagger animation when lots of people are using stagger perk cards. It honestly kinda sucks for min/maxed melee players waiting for her to land so they can do good damage.
---
You can't blame the players who are doing the staggering; a lot of us don't even know what's happening. Of course, you're also free to fight however you like, but the cards are just OP since they can stack with multiple players' attacks in a constant loop. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think she needs a bit of a buff against it. Don't nerf the stagger effect itself, just give her a cooldown.
---
If anyone does want to help the melee crowd, though, maybe just unequip the perks after the wings are crippled and re-equip when she lands.
---
Nice. Ill give that a try

I just had the same thing happen to me last night! Just got to level 50 so I was finally able to wear the t-60 pieces I've had in my stash for ages. put them on a new chassis and repaired them all using the last of my iron ore and steel. Was about to collect the armor again when I disconnected from the server.  
---
I reloaded the game with an empty chassis but no t-60 parts anywhere to be seen on my character, nor my stash or anything.  
---
I opened up a ticket with Bethesda and they aren't going to help compensate in any way. They only offered me troubleshooting advice. :/
---
Which one?
---
I'll have to hop around then, I don't think Scout Leader Penny is being very generous to me lol.
---
Just buy the plan from the vendor in Harpers Ferry. You get back the caps you used after a day and don't have to grind for hours.
---
Same way but now you have to walk up to them for the tame to appear,  doesn't work with aiming at them anymore
---
Ooo ok
---
I crash exiting the door at the top to the roof of that building, 2/3 times as well. I'm on PC
---
I mean... Combat *could* Feel a bit better, but camp construction makes me want to scream and throw things *every* time I attempt it.
---
Do you not have the camera on your character? I found it once and started ripping through my camera film like no tomorrow
