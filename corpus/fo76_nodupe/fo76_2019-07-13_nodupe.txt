Honestly, I really needed to hear that. Thank you.

---
I would recommend playing alone preferably on a private server first month if you want to get the classic Fallout feel from the game if you can afford.
---
Because theyre super frail and incredibly hard not to oneshot when you have half decent gear
---
Thanks, guess I must've overlooked it before lol

Even at lvl 300 I cry when this happens, script is script.
---
I'm down for this.
---
yea true, good point
---
I recommend trying a different sub. This one does not allow bartering.
---
It happens to me with new characters. I have to quit and log back in. Then it starts working.
---
Dude don’t back out, as long as the camera is still spinning around your dead body, just go get a coffee and come back in 10min, you can respawn and loot the dead sheep. You’ll get the event rewards too.
---
Plasma cores don’t change the stats, they’re just more common/cheaper to make than flamer fuel. 
---

---
Flamers are 100% silent weapons though, which is super weird, but makes them the only really silent HW.
---
Thanks dude! I will switch back to commando. Something seems off with the damage
---
I was about to say the same thing, they need to buff the legendary miners because all of my weapons one shot them even if I’m not trying to
---
Damn, I initially read this as canary and was quite confused for the first half.
---
I’ll give it a try
---
I’m hopeful I’ll get mine soon. Got all the other rewards, so I know I have to be close.
---
TIL I don't have half decent gear
---
Yeah ofcourse try to get good gear first. When you set yourself, you will one-shot every mob and you don't have to worry about HP anymore, cause nothing can come close enough to kill you.
---
Yep, I didn't even realise how silly I was sounding until I got a little feedback. I'm not being a dick, I appreciate you weighing in.
---
I second this.
---
Oh ok thx
---
My main character's camp is a farm house with a small farm of crops as well as a Brahmin...there's also lots of random wildlife (chickens/bunnies) that spawn close by so hunting is easy. I love cooking up meals but they spoil way too fast and I can't possibly eat them all in time. I would love to can some meals and sell them...even if it's just for 10 caps or something like that. Just for the RP aspect of it.
---
No joke, I’m a level 257 and just discovered the power of shotguns + VATS. I can one shot just about anything and drop the alpha predator in a few shots. No bloody build required.
---
I missed a few days and don’t feel bad at all, the rewards are cool but none are ‘must-haves’. Now if the rewards include nice skins for gat laser, fixer, radium, and other neglected weapons, that would be a different story.
---
I just want to say pretty much everything u/slackerdao said.  I have two characters and the one I played the most is a sneaky sniper. My primary weapon is a instigating limb damage faster reload hunting rifle.  My secondary is a furious faster fire rate faster reload handmade. Both are primed, its really the way to go. And those are the only two weapons I carry. For Queen fights I have a zealot explosive lmg. Even with only a three in strength that gets me the first rank of each of the heavy perks so that I get 30% bonus to scorched,  30% bonus from Perks, and then 30% bonus from being primed.  Can down a normal scorchbeast in one clip.
---
I can send you a copy of my build on nukes and Dragons, it's pretty solid.
---
Every now and then I find it a little rote, but then again I just sat here for 3 hours and puttered around on several quests and events, ran up my SCORE and levels, and had a good time detaching from the real world for a bit. I think some people forget that that's the point of this, and if you are frothing at the mouth over certain elements, you might have a little too much invested in the game.
---
Food and drink never was an issue. I get the herbivore mutation, and my daily food is: corn soup, carrot suit, mutfruit juice, tato juice, glowing fungus soup and sweet tato stew. Buffs this gives me? AP regen +6 (not +6% 6 per TICK its HUGE its +3 without herbivore as it doubles buffs from fruit/veggies) agi +2, ap +20, rad resist +40, perception +4, and hp regen +0.25 (1 hp/s it seems this is not effected by herbivore sadly) also makes cranberry relish give a 20% exp bonus for hour as well as it counts as a fruit/veggie. Also doubles food/water from veg/fruits, hell u could just carry melons around and keep fed/hydrated with those thou no buffs, and removes all disease. I choose herbivore over carnivore since other than the glowing mushrooms, you can grow everything else in my normal buff set on your own Camp. So you have a unlimited supply, as a bonus, 2 Mutfruit+2 corn+2 tato+purified water=2 adheshive via veggie starch. So you can pretty much grow your own adheshives. I cook first and any of those I have remaining I turn into adheshive. Stilt bean stew also is +4 end, lure weed is +2 luck with herbivore. Only thing you can't really get is carry weight and +str from veggies.
---
That set of food will also take u from 1% to full food/water. You don't even need water on you if you use that set. Takes about 3 mins to harvest the crops get water and make enough to last me longer than it can stay before it spoils.
---
Probably accidentally double tapped the workbench with the confirm button when trying to pick up enemy loot. It happens.
---
Hopefully he learned what he did wrong so he can avoid doing it again. IMO no harm in what you did, it's just a game, learning from minor mistakes is part of playing. I learned how not to get into unwanted workshop pvp in a similar way.
---
You do know that BOS is an upcoming expansion, followed by whatever the missions and expeditions are about
---
like bugthesda is listening to bullshit like this lmao Aren’t there bigger issues they need to focus on besides your stupid jukebox?
---
To answer your question, the current PTS only came out a week after patch 20 went live, so I doubt it includes any fixes for bugs that only emerged with patch 20. The PTS is updated frequently before it goes live though, usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays, so check again then.
---
I have the level 100 achievement but somehow missed the level 10 one. Should be impossible. (PS4 if it matters.) But I feel for you; a bug making you miss the one for 100 is much harder to go back and get later.
---
Very true. I know what licensing music is like. (Looking to license some music for cover songs, atm)
---
Lever action rifle is solid and doesn't have the VATS Gauss issue.
---
Sorry to be brief, it is time for bed as I said. You're right, and thoughtful to comment. Seeing yours and the other comments was a wake up call. I'm about to delete this melancholy comment, but wanted to thank you.
---
😂😂 That can definitely be a recipe for disease, in both meanings of that statement.
---
It’s not that simple. The licensing is very specific. They’d have to get licenses to use the music in the jukeboxes as well as the already existing licenses permitting use on the radio.
---
I've already done it but can give you a hand if you still need it. Psn is fakenunchucks. I'll be on in about 30 minutes
---
damn, i feel cheap. I just threw down the cheap rugs
---
If you have a preferred weapon, scrap it to learn the different attachments for it. 
---
ALWAYS have a melee weapon. It's good to invest into the perks for your preffered style (One handed, two handed, unarmed) I invest in Unarmed because it save more space in your strength. This is the best way to save ammo for tougher fights and theyre cheap to repair. 
---
 Pick up almost everything you find to build a stockpile of scrap. 
---
Don't join events too far above your level. 
---
Invest in the First Aid perk in intelligence. 
---
Join a "Building" public team or start one. While you dont have to build, it gives you a boost in all your experience gained. 
---
If you have some vending machines, refrain from selling weapons and armor than isnt legendary. Sell chems, stimpaks, and ammo (.45, .50, 5.56, and shotgun shells are the best to sell) 
---
If you're making a high strength character, Barbarian is a must have card. It adds more damage resistance per level that scales with your strength. 
---
*real important* go to the options and enable Pacifist Mode to avoid accidentally starting PVP with a character. 
---
Have a small farm at your camp with an easy water source like a pond or river. I prefer growing corn and making corn soup. It lasts awhile and restores both your hunger and thirst. 
---
Invest in the inspiration perk and create a team. This allows you to gain more experience while in a team. Other players dont have to be in your team for it to work. 
---
That's most tips off of the top of my head. It also helps to have Hacker or Lockpick, too early on.
---
Just to clarify, I didn't say most players are guys, just that most that speak up are. But with the internet, you can't really tell. I run both male and female characters but I often have a habit of wearing gear that makes it hard to even tell the gender(it was PA on one character and now it's a firebreather's uniform on another, but I generally always wear a mask haha)
---
Simple solution is to weapon bash, does minimal damage allowing others to tag.
---
Haven't been able to get rid of them, and don't wanna try stairs or more foundation because I don't wanna make it any worse so I went with a modified version of what I was planning on building.
---
It's not facing the direction I watned, or quite what I had in mind, but it'll have to do for now... [https://imgur.com/VO7DSUR](https://imgur.com/VO7DSUR)

Probably a small minority; but, that is the flexibility of playing on PC.
---
I personally can't do FPS games with my X1 controller, but it sure comes out quick when playing anything that involves driving.
---
I am going to share cannibal perk nexttime I am in a public team heh. If you do rose's quests there is actually a part where she legit gives you the perk card (and u get to keep it) to eat a feral ghoul as part of the questline. She says you don't have to do it... but she taunts you by saying your not going to chicken out on me now are you? her reaction when you eat the ghoul thou over the radio is gold XD.
---
Cool! See you then
---
uranium fever is the best litmus test for a server that there is..
---
if you do that event on a server and thats what happens.. GTFO.. because every event you try to do is gonna be the same.. those players are turds
---
when you do a uranium fever and people are sharing and dropping the follow me emote when a legendary mob spawns.. stay on that server as long as you can
---
thanks
---
Hey I'm a part of a smallish under 50 person discord that runs events frequently. We just got done doing about a dozen encrypteds. Let me know if your interested and I'll post the link, this goes for anyone on pc looking for a chill group.
---
No. But I can guarantee that if you are full up as a level 20, you are hoarding too many things, or are storing things you don't need to store.
---
Scrap your junk 
---
Also FO1st isn't pay to win. It's just scrap, not item storage. 
---
Stop hoarding everything, scrap your junk, sell your valuables.
---
If you plan ahead you won’t one shot them. I play a bloodied commando build and can avoid one shoting then. Just gotta adjust my hp up some to reduce my damage and then not use vats or sneaking and stick to body shots.
---
youre hoarding too much shit..
---
you dont need to keep tons of all the various junk materials.. for the vast majority of them having between 50-100 is enough.. you probably dont need 800 glass..
---
I keep most junk between 25-50 personally.. but I dont base build so I only need a lot of the gear crafting/repairing materials
---
of course there are exceptions to this such as exceedingly rare materials like ballistic fiber or some of the other materials that are used often while crafting/building/repairing like screws
---
make sure you are breaking down all junk before you store it.. sometimes things slip through or require manually breaking them down.. check your junk tab
---
check your misc tab for gunpowder and unsmelted ores.. that is a source of weight that often sneeks past many peoples notice..
---
get rid of heavy ammo you do not use.. you dont use it, why do you have it right? no need to have 30 mini nukes or 200 missiles..
---
as far as weapons and armor go.. scrip or scrap anything youre not wearing or trying to sell..
---
also in regards to vending legendary gear.. trying to insist on getting max top dollar for every mediocre legendary item you come across isnt going to help your stash problems.. those things sit in vendors forever for a reason..
---
if it is a truly desirable weapon.. sell it for a fair price and be done with it.. dont try to get rich quick off it unless you enjoy holding onto shit forever..
---
GL
---
Instigating guns are great for sneak commandos if you don’t want to be bloodied or junkie
---
Yeah I was playing bloody in my SS armor and gangs of Yao were the last thing I expected lol. I would like to think I could have performed better if prepared but maybe not.
---
Prioritize picking up plastic, bulk your scrap, and sell anything over say 5 bundles.
---
Weapons an armours that aren't otherwise available as legendary variants get added to your "drop pool" if you learn the plans. Legendary Fixers are highly sought after, so therefore the plans are too.
---
now put on solar armor!
---
Holy shit, thanks for that man. Is the lockpick perk under agility? Since I'm guessing hacking is under intelligence
---
Unfortunately, the Xbox game pass ultimate for PC doesn't share servers with Xbox console game pass. Treat them as two different platforms.
---
If you are playing the Xbox version on PC with your Xbox acount  it should be the same but have not tried personally
---
Fallout 4 and 76 are the only two FPS games I play with a controller and it mostly comes down to the fact I hate building with keyboard and mouse because I hate using my arrow keys. Project Cars and The Crew 2 though its always a controller.
---
Perception.
---
I wish someone would share mysterious staranger when I am in a public team as I wanna see what it does exactly, and how often it procs at level 1. I use vats alot for headshots as I am lazy, though this is not as effective with a full auto weapon, as concentrated fires hit rate bonus is severly nerfed if you use full auto, gots from 15% per shot with semi-auto at lv 2, to 5% per shit with a full auto weapon. On the flip side, full auto weapons take about half the ap that semi-auto does to fire in vats. so I guess it balances out. I cna get about 2x the shots in vats with full auto compared to semi-auto. Honestly am thinking of getting gun0fu rank 3 just so it'll hop to 2-3 extra targets as they die. Might be fun for lower level things.
---
No idea why people are hitting with DVs. That's actually really cool!
---
If you’re struggling with stash limit at 20, it’s likely you’re holding on to stuff you don’t need to. Don’t get me wrong, it should be increased across the board regardless of fo1st, but it should be a non-issue at 20.
---
What kind of stuff is filling your stash? Weapons and armor should be scrapped for plans and mats, as you’ll be out-leveling them anyways. You don’t need a hoard of food or water either, just enough. Also make sure you’re breaking down all your junk instead of just storing it. Some junk items will weigh 5lbs, but when broken down into scrap, will weigh less than 1.
---
If you have any questions, I’d be happy to help.
---
Yeah Luck perks are so QoL as well as incredibly efficient for some builds, and I think its mostly over looked to the detriment of many.
---
Lol I put down a bunch of those charlie brown trees and christmas presents and two alpine horn guys in battle with each other in Monongah power plant workshop last night. I hope someone found it before the server reset.
---
It's to research a cure for Ward's narcolepsy.
---
Love it!
---
bulking scrap makes all of it except aluminum and lead weigh more.. 
---
only bulk to sell.. and do it right before you go to the vendor..
---
Also, to craft fixer mods, scrap combat rifles.
---
Wait when is double XP weekend?
---
Works fine for me. If you already had a Project76.ini file in your My Games folder delete that before making the symbolic link. Did it give you an error in cmd prompt when you ran the command to make the link?
---
Shotguns +VATS + perks will let you one shot just about anything without a bloody build.
---
That’s actually a really good idea
---
You can always switch out cards to suit whatever you're doing, too. 
---
Example: if you aren't crafting guns, you dont need the gunsmith card slotted all the times. There's more useful cards to have slotted during combat and crafting.
---
If you learn the plan then you can get legendary fixer drops from  the purveyor. Or anywhere else legendaries are found I think.
---
Yeah most of the time i dont even actually touch the legendaries and if i do kill one i drop the legendary for everyone else plus any others i might have on me i dont want
---
That is essentially what I just said.
---
What build are you?
---
Sounds cool
---
This is where I love reddit... A random post got me some very good feedback. I regret my post but I kinda needed to be told I needed to take a break.
---
As others have said, you can do most everything solo. If you do decide to shell out the cash for the private server tho, be warned that the final boss is designed for many people to fight.
---
Hmmm this same exact post was made 8 months ago
---
Can confirm from Kentucky and all the women in my family are fixing to start canning Garden goods this week.
---
It Just Worksn't.
---
Let’s say you want to roll a fixer via the purveyor, if you don’t know the fixer plan you won’t be able to get a legendary fixer drop from her. the fixer was the most valuable gun in the game, so people like to have their alt/mule accounts knowing the fixer plan to use as much scrip as possible to have a chance to get a nice fixer drop. In order to mod The fixer your going to need to scrap combat rifles as you cannot scrap the fixer even a non legendary one that you can craft (the fixer is basically a cooler combat rifle+ added benefits)
---
thats not what you said.. you said..
---
&gt; Prioritize picking up plastic, bulk your scrap, and sell anything over say 5 bundles.
---
keeping bulked junk in your stash is counterproductive..
---

Hey man, mind if I buy one of those Fixer plans off of you? Been looking for ages, but would hate to just mooch off of ya. :) i just spent most of my caps I earned to get some ammo from a seller, but i got like 1k caps i think! My IGN is NickKnackz

Isent u a dm to talk more

Thanks!🧡

Sheepsquash has what the sorchbeast queen does which is a flat reduction to how much damage it takes, and no perk can offset that. Amror penetration helps, but you cannot do anything about the base damage reduction they have. Think sorchbeast quests has a 70 to 90% reduction flat before its DR is even factored in. Basically its like they get power armor, in a full set of power armor a player takes 42% less damage before DR is applied to the remaining amount. If hit is 100 dmg, PA reduces that to 58, which then that 58 is now reduced by your DR. Which in PA, is going to bring that 58 hit down to 20 or so damage, if that. Sorchbeast queen/Sheepsquash has a simmlar system, where they get a flat dmg reduction before DR is even factored in.
---
On the flip side this makes it real easy on SBQ to see when someone is using a hacked weapon, Seen a guy literally doing over 5%-7% to SBQ a shot with a minigun. Which is statistically impossible even with bloodied build at 1 hp. She has 32000 hp iirc. doing 5% to SBQ a shot is over 1600 damage a shot, which with her 90% dmg reduction and high DR, is impossible to get for any legit player on her. This is 1600 dmg he is going to her AFTER that -90% is applied+her DR. Would take him hitting for 16000-18000+ a shot vs something with 0 armor to be able to hit SBQ for 1600 each bullet.
---
I honestly don't believe all the high minded nonsense of 'I would shoot less damage but its the enemies fault for being weak' because in events like UF you know exactly what the enemies are and how strong, and low damage weapons can be picked up so easily.
---
The truth is people just want to kill and the game is set up to reward those who kill quickly which means high dps at all times. Who in reality runs around with anything less than their best weapons? Look at what happens when someone picks up a bow for a different experience, immediately its explosive arrows and head shots aka exactly the same. 
---
And no I'm not excluding my builds. I have less than optimised setups for more fun, but I'm still able to 1 shot from Stealth most of what I run in to, and a L95 Glowing Behemoth takes just 3 headshots to drop.
---
I can't give you anything other than advice: decide what you want your primary weapon to be when you're a badass - all types are viable.  Automatic rifles, semiauto rifles, melee, shotguns, pistols, whatever you dig.  Take up the associated perks for that type of weapon (melee, shottie, etc.) to improve your damage.  Consider splashing in sneak attack for extra damage - it's all about damage in this game.  
---
Do you have a primary type in mind?  If it's a gun start hoarding it's ammo now.  Check a wiki and find where to buy plans for that type of weapon.  Get those plans, make that shit and conquer.
---
Glad to hear it was helpful. Look out for yourself, take a break and you’ll be alright.
---
Yeah it's unfortunately a return of the energy weapon respawn bug that was really bad at once time, then fixed, now back but somewhat milder since not every one of them that turned to ash or goo seem to do it.
---
Temporary fix is don't run energy weapons if you want to farm an area repeatedly, or if you care about other people being able to farm it afterward. Some believe that making sure you empty every loot pile before leaving the area will prevent it, but I haven't tested that.
---
It was a weird weekend. Since the public teams came out people where doing events like mad, but this weekend it did seem dead. I saw SBQ fail twice. The first time it was empty, I showed up and i was the only one with ten minutes left. Literally the only person there. The second i got there at the end and she was barely damaged when it ended. I was server hopping looking for distant thunder and it was like everyone took the weekend off. Fair amount of low leveled players though, so maybe it was a luck of the draw type thing.
---
A lot of the hardcore gardening folks in my area of WV ended up having low harvest. We had a very late frost, around May 15, and that ended up killing a lot of the crop.
---
You still need the diffusers?
---
That seems to vary. I had a server that was giving me one time XP for draining their health to almost zero even though it didn't kill them. Usually though it's like you said, no xp.
---
It's a heavy weapon, recieves bonus from heavy gunner cards. Based off of the German MG42. Hope that helps.
---
Radiation rumble also a good exp farm even if it fail
---
I'm not completely against the online aspects, I did an event today and a guy stoped me and gave me loads of plans. I just don't want to hit a wall and need help from someone to progress the story.
---
On a side note I stayed away from this game like it was a pregnant deathclaw, but know I'm playing its a great game
---
I think it would take TONS of building towards the idea if it is possible but I doubt it. And for 2 reasons at that. (correct me if I'm wrong but...)
---
1. IIRC, robots tend to have a higher explosive resistance(maybe just vertibots, I haven't researched it)
---
2. I believe that ever since explosives were nerfed in attempt to "fix" legendaries with the explosive modifier, the change didn't fix anything as intended and made grenades, rockets, nukes, and such pretty much useless.
---
If you're having trouble shooting them down, I recommend just using something with a large ammo capacity and high RoF. For the longest time, I'd try shooting them down with semi-automatic weapons and such and it would take ages. What I realized is that since you can't do zero damage and they tend to fly outside of range, might as well not worry about damage and just more hits. I've started using a .50cal and it absolutely shreds the bots(and pretty accurate too)
---
Yes, I do.
---
You will always miss that first shot with Gauss in vats. It's been that way since launch.
---
I really wish the best for you. I’m sure in 10 to 15 years this game will be a very insignificant blimp in your life. And just so you know I’m pretty sure that a double daily score weekend and a double do weekend are coming up with the next few weeks.
---
Not sure. Why re-write something that was already well-written in the first place?
---
That’s my logic at least.
---
Some people in this community can be insufferable sometimes

I do clean up for the pemmican. People who don't want to bother doing the quest three times to get it for the badge will buy it
---
Expeditions look to be that content, coming early 2021, likely.
---
Its gonna take a couple of missiles, maybe if it’s a bloodied missile launcher + consumables you’d have the best of luck but at that point you might as well use a bloodied rifle of some sort (that’s how I take them down) [edit: a bloodied explosive dragon or black powder rifle could probably do it in one hit]

---
I just don’t get it. He can walk out of his base and be hit with 1000 legacies right now. Why steal my two star combat rifle that means the world to me
---
Oh cool
---
If 800 is not enough at level 20, think about how it was at launch. We only had 400 stash space back then, after two increases we are now at 800. I'm hoping there will be another increase to 1000 soon.
---
But seriously, 800 is more than enough. Another way of increasing your stash space is using the other 4 characters on your main account. You can do this on public servers if you have a friend on that server. Ask them to hold onto it, or drop it on the ground. Swap characters and move the item over.
---
Another suggestion is buying a second account. Then running two game clients. I use this method a lot, my second account has all the trade gear and flux making mats and such on it as those items take up a lot of stash space. These days you can get a second account for a couple of dollars so its a small investment for another 5 characters with 1650+ carry weight and 800 stash room.
---
While I play a bloodied build (more or less), I try to use a vampires 50 cal so I don't one shot the legendary miners. As a bonus, it gives me a buffer if I get low on health every now and then.
---
Shameful.
---
For some reason NW always make me think of new Vegas
---
Lone Wanderer perk card, 4 Charisma.
---
I went from the vault to SBQ entirely solo, but it does have some hairy spots. You’ll have to avoid a few events if you don’t want to engage at all, but you can also join those solo and just help out without a group.
---
I was trying to figure this out just yesterday. I'm sneak commando but went with SS under armor for great resist and then was able to move a couple strength points in other spots without losing carrying capacity. I am very happy with the choice.
---
When I run out of space I make a alt/mule character and transfer the unneeded weight to the character I don’t use(if it’s valued items) edit: DROP ALL MISSILES AND MININUKES
---
Apart from the obvious benefits ie more guns = more bullets.. Is that the only one? Sorry I am a noob both to 76 and mmo in general
---
Awesome shots. I wish I could take some this good.
---
Yep. It attaches to the secret service chest armor. So you can still wear the backpack.
---
Because only the debuff for not satisfying thirst and hunger is being removed. 
---
Well Fed, Well Hydrated and the extra Buffs given by Food and Drinks are NOT being removed. 
---
So people who want to stock up or even sell food Buffs such as Extra Exp, Melee Damage or Carry weight can do so without being put on a two hour timer at best. (Without having to resort to 3 perks in GWS)
---
Yea I never join that event expecting to finish it , always see it as exp goldmine
---
The people are generally really helpful in this game. I don’t blame you for avoiding it then, but it’s really shaped up into a fantastic game regardless of how angry this sub gets sometimes.
---
I’ve never used the points, ther is no point after the first 500 levels 😉
---
I’ve had the same all today. It leaves me frozen for a good 5 seconds, which is death for a bloodied build. 
---
Edit: I’m on PC + direct Ethernet
---
I've just started a full strength heavy alt and was also disappointed by this. Not a fan of power armour.
---
Ranged sneak, I suppose is the closest type
---
Jumping on now. Meet me at deathclaw island then let then deathclaw kill me in the shallows. After I die, kill then deathclaw then revive me.
---
I'll have to try that
---
1700+hrs in game. I still found that informative, comparative. Just really cool.
---
I’ve solved that problem by not even looking at the board. So I have no idea what rewards I’m going to miss out if I don’t get all 100.
---
I’ll get what I end up with.

PFFT! I did encryptid at level 13. SOOO MUCH XP! Just gotta make sure you hit the enemies.

And before someone cries that i shouldn't be there. I was one of only two people activating the pylons. Join line in the sand and use a fast fire weapon to get those tags in. And some people will disagree but slap on a hazmat suit (if needed) and get yourself to scorched earth. ANY event with loads of enemies. Just tag them enemies. And try and not be a hindrance.

This, I had long given up on ever getting a legacy laser or even a Fixer that had any kind of damage buff, then these heroes come on out of the woodwork and spread the love!
---
I'd rather have a working fridge at CAMP that drastically slowed down how fast foods went bad. It would gain an extra bar after say half an hour of play and then take 4-5 in game hours of real play(not time elapsing when not playing) while on your character.
---
Oh gods no. I’m just done helping low levels. This is happened twice now, and most of the time I see names on the scammer list of people that I’ve helped whenever they were itty-bitty
---
Those scammers make no sense. Once I gave a guy a one star Lever action and he immediately left the server and blocked my account
---
I don't understand why someone would launch a nuke at prime and not fight the SBQ. There are better places to farm Flux. I could understand giving up after 10 minutes or so has passed and you haven't made a dent, but to find it far in progress with absolutely no damage done, especially on a fairly full server, is odd to me.
---
i’m for this. they need to do more with it, else it was wasted development time
---
I've finally gotten to the end of the first chapter of the Legendary Run, alas most of my friends are further behind.
---
Yea. Again, assholes downvoted this for no reason so prolly gonna get buried
---
"I heard you put a bounty on yourself.......Just to feel WANTED"
---
So rather than coming up with a legitimate argument or admitting your wrong you correct my grammatical errors.
---
Touche
---
Commando or rifleman? Just out of curiosity to what weapon you're using
---
1. Like most people have said, scrap your junk.
---
2. Scrap most(if not all) weapons and armor you're not using. You'll outlevel most of it soon enough. Even for higher level gear, even if there's no guarantee that you'll come across the exact same copy of something, you'll get plenty of gear that you can use. 
---
3. In your misc tab, try not to hold onto ore or gunpowder. They tend to weigh a bit and cannot have their weight reduced in any way.
---
4. Bulk your aluminum and lead, doing so will reduce their weight.(others don't)
---
5. Unless you're aiming to go for some sort of explosives build, get rid of most(if not all) your grenades, mines, mini-nukes, missiles, and grenade rounds.
---
6. Unless you're planning on using power armor or gatling lasers, get rid of most(if not all) your fusion cores. They way a bunch of it stacks up quickly, just like explosives.
---
7. Unless you plan on using gatling plasma, get rid of your plasma cores. They don't weight as much as fusions but it does add up.
---
8. Getting perks that reduce carry weight of items can be useful if you're still having problems.
---
9. Don't go holding onto a bunch of plans that you already know. At your level, if you already know it and you have another, chances are they probably aren't worth anything anyway.
---
I’d say that could be considered a cheat
---
You're*
---
If you can take out a thruster that’s slows them down I haven’t found anything I could one shot them with
---
"Bro just get all this stuff and XP is easy"
---
PS4 sadly.....
---
Id honestly say questline, when u get to wastelanders i rmb the questing giving good exp
---
You must be using the German spelling and English Pronunciation.
---
Mine is super slow lately and today I noticed it having an affect on my vending machines.
---
Human nature friend. Sorry for the loss, best of luck finding better. If your ps4 I’m a total human. Not a robot. /s
---
You don’t need all of it.
---
Just turn up to events and participate, which is more than I see off some high level players sponging xp and caring only about bosses. Run around, shoot lots of bullets, die alot, have fun...rinse and repeat. The rewards are often useless to high levels but can be welcome boosts early on if you get stuck on the quest lines. 
---
Mostly it's a case of just doing stuff...any stuff. Quests, events, crafting, cooking, they all give xp so simply ensure you're not being idle.
---
And at the moment make sure you are in a public team, even if it's just you, to get the bonuses there too.
---
im lvl 304 and have none of them reeee
---
Thank you very much. Keep practicing! When I started taking shots in FO4 back in 2016 they were pretty bad. xD
---
It really is a shit system. It's BORING and the rewards are mostly garbage. The community just rolled over and took it as per usual though since they put fancy art behind the same tired ass challenge system we had before along with taking away the choice we had with how to spend Atoms.
---
At least before I earned Atoms and could save them for something I actually wanted, now I'm stuck with a bunch of trash as "rewards" that I have zero choice in.
---
Just want to throw it out there but I figured out all you have to do is make sure Fallout is on your main drive that you Xbox App is on and it works great!
---
With only 1 rank Mysterious Stranger only appears occasionally, it's not enough to really rely on it for anything. He's actually killed stuff before when it's been just barely hanging on after I shoot it but not often. It might be better with 3 ranks but honestly I just use it because I have 1 free point in luck and it's a neat perk. I'm strong enough that I can waste one point for a little bit of fun, plus when he shows up everyone else can see him.
---
Think about it, how often have you ever seen the Mysterious Stranger? I've never seen anyone but me us it.
---
Sadly best advice either find some strong friends or don’t do encryptid I find I lose more in ammo and repairs then what’s the rewards are worth
---
Thank you so much! Sending it right now!
---
I fully agree.
---
Yes, most who disagree use one themselves so they aren't to be taken seriously. There's a reason everyone wants Bloodied and that's because it's broken.
---
I really am enjoying the game play it feels just like fo4 to me. I am glad I waited 2 years to play tho.from what I have heard it was a bit of a mess at the beginning
---
Join just for the exp for mob killing stuff and events if ur grinding events (and may go afk). I like solo play mostly too cause no one to worry bout and stuff but I always join a team for bonuses. People usually do the same and sometimes join in if they see an event they wanna do. Overall I think its a genuine improvement on qol of game. It broke my expectations in utility tbh and i am quite happy with the addition
---
Just take a break, buy some atoms if you really are worried about missing out on rewards
---
That would be amazing, Are you online tonight?
---
You can play it alone, I personally prefer to play it with my friends. The final boss would probably be tricky at low levels,but a server wide notice will pop up and others will join you.
---
As a rule, you can join in the pop up events - they have a level guide on them - and you can work collaboratively with other players that way without being in a group. Follow the Overseer's story, and the Overseer's personal story (which are two different quest lines) because there is beautiful storytelling and lore there. Don't be afraid to wander around and take your time exploring, it will all still be there when you are ready. 
---
Above all, have fun. My way is slow levelling, taking lots of screenshots, meandering around the countryside and experiencing the whole setting. I've been playing since launch and my main character has just got to level 80 (doesn't bother me, it's not a race). Others like to grind for the best gear and optimum builds, and that's what they enjoy. If you are a long time Fallout player, I assume you are here for the lore and experience, so ignore the preconceptions to you may have and just let it all wash over you.😎
---
Thanks mate i will definitely get that. Any other perks you recommend for a lone wanderer
---
Mines been doing screen tearing when it wasn’t before I’ve also lost about 5-10 FPS
---
Every time I hear you guys talk about this autocomplete glitch it scares the shit out of me because I haven't had it happen to me yet but I dread the day it does. That's why I log in like 3 hours after the reset and make sure to just wait a bit before starting them. I really hope Bethesda fixes it because honestly the battle-pass rewards are really cool.
---
The only cross client saves are between bethesda client, steam client and game pass client for pc. Atoms are restricted to the client they are earned on. Fallout 1st is restricted to the client it is purchased on. Things that are purchased with atoms and unlocked with fallout 1st are available across all three clients. 
---
There is no cross platform saves.
---
When I was playing earlier one flew over me when I was picking up wards lost stuff. I one shotted the vertibots and was able to take down the nuke card drone in 2-3 clicks. Bloodied ultracite plasma caster
---
That is awful. I’m sorry that happened to you. It is a shame people would be so cruel. I love helping others in the game and making people feel like they have a sense of community in Fallout. I would be cautious on giving your favorite weapons, but we just never know when someone is just using us and pretending to be a friend. Chin up tho, what you do to help others is a good thing. Just be careful. 💗
---
Just about every time I do the event and there's more than a few people, there's always at least 1 trigger-happy asshat with their TSE whatever that sprays everything as if they need to make sure they get the legendary if it's the last thing they do. Not really sure if there's anything I can recommend though. I personally don't care too much but I do find the lack of courtesy rather annoying.
---
If you miss. Take a shot out of vats and go back in
---
If you don't have Fallout 1st then you can just go to your friends server and if you don't have any active friends then you can just go to the main menu, wait a few minutes, and then press "play".
---
My go to is a vampires explosive gatling, does enough damage to not feel useless, but not enough to one-shot. And with the explosive effect, it heals twice as much because the explosive damage counts as a separate hit.
---
I find a full set of Troubleshooter to be very helpful.
---
Not really a scam. You gave it to him
---
An Anti-Material Rifle or Gauss Sniper Rifle. All the currents snipers are either way too inaccurate, or way too underpowered - I'd love to have a really powerful powerful weapon to reliably annihilate enemies from a distance.
---
Https://discord.gg/jPtWNN
---
Fasnacht characters are always a good vibe:)
---
Honestly, that’s all about build. I did mostly non-PA melee tank for leveling and story progression, but really that’s the only specific “solo play” perk I can think of. I swapped into heavy PA full health in endgame, and act as medic/mob disposal in events and such, but it’s really not that difficult to find a groove in any build.
---
I could do that I play with 2 other friends who are both new to the game. What do you recommend, I want the full experience of the game. the main reason I don't want to play online/in groups is because I feel it would take away for the single player experience
---
Also can people grief you and how easy would it be for them to do that
---
It started happening after a big patch, some long time ago. Some weapons (Gauss rifle) are worst than others (Revolver). 
---
You can improvise some fixing by practising your timing between entering vats and making the first shot. If the first shot misses, just leave vats and try again. 
---
I do it automatically now, and it is not a problem anymore. 
---
I am certainly hating the "no damage" bug which happens when I can't cause damage in vats, even when I get the damage numbers, the yellow critical, etc. And the enemy does not lose an inch of health when it was a 1740 headshot.
---
Assassins Crossbow. I reallllllllly don't care for pvp and also I just don't like the crossbow
---
wow how'd you swing that
---
lol so true isn’t it 😂😂
---
I've never ran into these people. Everyone I see always emotes the "follow me" emote to let people get hits on the legendaries
---
Jetpack hundred percent. The jetpack is useful to begin with but more importantly makes the game a lot more fun imo.
---
People say laser rifles are weak, I use it as a strength.  A reduced weight laser pistol and a handful of fusion cells weighs only a pound or so.  You can vats headshot anything In the forest , never have to buy or craft ammo, save wear and tear and ammo for main weapons; and most importantly: leave some meat on the bone for other players.  
---
It really cracked me up at fasnacht watching people empty their mags into the level 5 frogs and then the grand finale sloth send off of a ten man kill squad of explosive rifles and lmgs.
---
Don’t sleep on mr sandman perk And better criticals. At night covert ops stacks damage with mr sandman.
---
It depends on your build. I have a lot of fun with my instigating western revolver. Noisy, lethal, full of style for gunfu.
---
I am very unfashionable and use a 10mm - modded but non-legendary. Good power, accuracy, fire rate and shreds vertis and cargobot with ease.
---
Ok I don't always use my 10mm, sometimes I pull out my 38 pipe pistol to chew up some of the hoarded ammo.
---
The legendary run is split into 3 chapters [the coloured parts] so not as far as many people in this thread.
---
Amazing, every time I go in there’s one greedy asshole with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet or something
---
They're all talkers. Gramps is probably the most easily ignored. Daguerre is the worst.
---
You can place them and delete them easily enough at least.
---
We spawned at the edge of the map and just took turns stepping into fire.
---
I'm down for it. Not great with encrypted pylons (bloodied) but can contribute every other way. Bloodied shotgun/HW. DM me your GT if you want
---
Have you tried switching servers and clearing out mezzanine again?
---
Just got fallout, knows about holiday gifts....yeah no
---
How do you know about large holiday gifts if you just got the game?
---
Agreed.  I always have my bowie knife set as a favourite and ready for when the announcement of terminated management comes.  Its two movements on the controller to activate.  I also call other players over to get in a shot but there is always one jerk who opens up with some high powered weapon which one shots the miner.   It does make me think, why the f**k am I being so nice?  I could kill it, grab the loot and no one would even know.   Where I don't do this is Radiation Rumble... the event is hard enough I'm not about to start calling over other players when I'm surrounded by glowing ghouls.
---
Yes
---
lol funny
---
It takes like 20-30 minutes to do the dailies.
---
That was a beautifully crafted space and it’s sad you could only use it once. I hope they open it up again.
---
Some of the benefits are directly relates to the challenges, such as ‘Complete event in groups’, you can easily join a public group to gain the points. It also comes with extra XP gain i believe, which makes you level up faster. Groups can also share Perks, say if someone in your group has high Charisma points, you get better price when you buy/sell at vendor bots too.
---
I’d go for the one with more plans learned. Especially ones from events. 🙂
---
This. I’m LOVING my full health rifleman/shotgunner build. Get those great sneak bonuses from a distance then run in and absolutely pulverize enemies with my shotty. I can’t believe I didn’t discover it until level 120.  I’m not even done buying all the shotgun damage perks I need and I already know this is going to do some real damage.
---
One of the great things about being in any random group is the free fast travel. Fast travel cost goes up as you level but you can always fast travel for free if it is to the entrance of vault 76, yours/teammate's camp/tent, or active public events. The tent is Fo1st only but even free fast travel to camps can save you quite a bit of caps early on. Even if you aren't on the same team, you can use other players' vendors as fast travel points if you don't have any other points near where you're headed(but it will cost you of course).
---
Also, being on a team gives teammate's some caps for every quest you complete and the other way around. 
---
On top of that, with public teams having been added, you can get extra bonues depending on type of team it is(bonus applies after a player is in the team for a short period). The most common ones are events(+25% event xp for each player) and building(+1 Int for each player).
---
Nice!
---
Go with the one that you enjoy playing the most. Plans and items can be earned over time, Fasnacht will be back.
---
I'm sorry I didn't see this till now I'm xbox as well I'm already off for night but if you want send me a friend request on xbox and I'll see if we can meet tom and I'll get you set up a Lil gt:CrowDaddy313
---
But I dont understand why he did that if he already got the weapon; I mean why block and everything, you gifted him the gun so why this craziness
---
I am sorry for you but dont worry my friend, you look like a good man, PC?
---
We are getting the colossal problem with a mini 8 man dungeon and a world boss at the end coming in 3 weeks
---
They definitely do, I have vampire flamer, cryolator, and Gatling Guns all with 25% fire rate that do the trick. My main improvement was when I fixed my power armor build with the optimal perks and health for PA.
---
10-15k ish
---
Not all that great at silos but I’d be willing to do what you’re doing as well! DM me and I’d be happy to build up a similar stash.
---
Im trying to play as a sniper I'm only lv20 but I feel like it's going pretty well. I have 7 in perseption 5 in luck and the rest split pretty evenly between the other specials. What should I focus on to be a sniper?
---
Xbox 🥺
---
So all you need is 1 bobby pin and no skill. 
---
Tbh I pick locks so infrequently I see no need for 'shortcuts'. Its only a few seconds swapping card when you need to use them and pins are plentiful. 
---
FYI. The latest test version of the Legendary Perks has a passive lock pick card which levels up replacing cards finishing at a fully auto unpick.
---
lmao that’s both sad and funny at the same time. Maybe he thought legendary weapons only come with one star.
---
Oh ok my bad
---
100% this. Source, did it myself.
---
50
---
also.. you shouldnt have to use a point prior to level 50(unless youre like under lvl 10 and havent got many packs to open yet).. nor should you have to pick a card over lvl50.. 
---
there should be plenty of doubles a player could use to combine just from opening packs..
---
judging from many of the responses in this thread it seems many people either..
---
A. do not properly understand the challenge
---
B. do not properly understand leveling up 
---
C. both of the above
---
I failed encrypted today because someone launched a nuke as I started it and half the people there left to go fight the queen.
---
Second post about this too.
---
This is if you’re out for rape. I got mine for 3k from a nice player and will sell mine for the same
---
I have done encrypted at least 15 times and still haven’t got the fixed plans.
---
After running thru 50-60, I decided to only roll guaranteed 3* peices.
---
Must have been a glitch that occurred that day, I removed the quest and today I managed to pick it up again just by visiting the foundation and talking to Ward who was sat inside his chair this time 🤨

And what about nuke zones? Can a level 1 with a hazmat suit just waltz in and tear it up?

Question: the legendary fixer also have his standard buff?

I see where you’re going with this... perks

---
It's a little bit old but most of the info is still relevant.
---
I love the Xbox economy.. I spent well over 15000 for the plan at a player vendor before the dupes happened. On the bright side I was finally dropped the bear arm plan at Arktos chemical!
---
The one you find is level 30.  The plan only drops from the event (I bought mine from a vendor). 
---
It’s useful because it has an inherent 10% damage increase over regular combat rifles.  The stealth aspect is secondary.  DPS wise it outclasses hunting rifles
---
Can you explain this since I just walk around in PA with my M-2 Browning.
---
Doesn't work of you're a meelee build
---
I'm on pc and noticed a huge influx of low level players, completely forgot gamepass was also on PC. Lots less high levels packed into a server means less caps moving I guess.
---
I never cook anything that wasn't an atom challenge. I've only recently started making cranberry relish for the exp boost. 
---
I'd forage for ingredients and cook specialized meals WAY MORE OFTEN if I could can and give the specialized foodstuffs infinite durability like prewar food.
---
Same with Gauss Shotgun and the Bows. Feels like vats expect to proc whenever you click the mousebutton to fire, but with these weapons you fire on release instead. Extra problematic if the enemies move
---
Yup. I'm normally on max caps everyday within a few hours, now I have to wait a few hours just for one person to come by.
---
I can fly through silos on my own pretty quickly so if you need a hand there I'm happy to help out. I'm also bloodied so using me as a pylon for Encryptid wouldn't be great but I can at least help out with the shooty all the robots part?
---
I just run encrypted with someone til it drops for a party member.
---
i adjusted my stocks to fit the needs of new players and relocated to near the vault and it helped a bit.
---
Thx I’ll take a look
---
Appreciate it thx for the advice
---
The advantage of using the homing missile launcher on the drone is that explosives deal excellent limb damage to all the limbs at the same time, which in the case of the vertibot means the thrusters.
---
A two shot, limb damage, reduced weight missile launcher is an excellent weapon for this task, as it will very reliably knock out all four engines in one or two shots, and is the best missile launcher.
---
Two shot doubles the damage of explosives making it the best possible prefix on those weapons, and instigating is terrible against the vertibot as it usually is damaged by random mutants and scorched which shoot at it any time it flies over, any unit that has a ranged attack will attack it except robots.
---
The circle of life.
---
Ok awesome thx will do I appreciate it
---
I let the timer tick down but people still fail to show. I end up doing radiation solo but for XP only.
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
Gotcha, transition to luck it is!
---
Market value 10k what most players will actually pay 5-7k (this is just off my experience I started with 7k but only got a handful of purchases so I settled for 4.5k)
---
ya i tried that im just bad
---
ok thanks
---
A little late to this, and other people have expressed interest, but I would buy it off you (I'm on XBox). Been trying to get one forced with no luck through Encryptid.
---
Bloodied seems to be the direction everyone is going, yes? How is it that people are able to manage low HP/High rads and not die so often? Is it stim spam?
---
I'll give you 1 for all of them weapons
---
You're just giving me reasons to drink my delicious Toxic Goo.
---
I know I am but what are you?
---
He's my most common random event next to the lemonade stand. 
---
Last insult he gave me he was listing the guns I use and was wondering why I don't just show my face. 😂💀
---
If we can do this in The Sims I don't understand why we can't do it in Fallout 76! 🤣🤣🤣
---
I can if you like, I'm on now. We can gear you up and do some missions
---
I posted this same question a few days ago and it’s a glitch.  It doesn’t take any caps and the workshop claiming is normal, you just don’t see your marker on the map.  It is apparently triggered by opting to switch worlds when your camp or survival tent can’t be placed.
---
Exslovies weapons and ammo are basically useless in the game, scrap/sell the weapons and just drop the ammo. 
---
Its always good to have a decent chunk of steel, lead, springs, screws, aluminum, and wood. The other materials I would farm as you need. Gunpowder is only useful if you plan on mass crafting ammo. Never craft ammo without ammosmith and super duper once you're a high enough level to unlock those perks. They are in Agility and Luck respectively. Its also not a bad idea to invest the the ammo constructor that you can buy with gold bullion from the raiders. But that will be a bit grindy to get. Dont keep ammo you don't need for now. 
---
Regular weapons and armor that you won't use should either be sold or scrapped. Legendary gear you won't use should be sold through player vending or traded in for legendary scrip. 
---
You don't need 100 of every aid item. Chems aren't that necessary in this game, sell them. Stimpaks and Radway are good to have but you should be fine with just keeping about 30 of each on hand. If you're regularly completing events, the game will give you more purified water, stimpaks, and radway than you'll ever need. Food is super easy to come by, there's no need to stock up on piles of food because it can get heavy and it spoils quickly. Honestly I wouldn't keep many aid items in your stash at all, if any. You can carry them on you and be fine. 
---
Once you're into the ate levels and endgame content, stash space will be much harder to manage. FO1st really isn't terrible if you can afford it, its basically like you buy atoms each month and you also get an unlimited scrap box, survival tent (which is a mini camp) and a private server to play on, which has its own benefits, like self transferring between characters on the same account.
---
lol.
---
Crazy how I have to use 5-6 ammo while my VATs states I have a 95% chance to hit, as in, I'm right next to them.
---
i wonder if they are increasing the number of dailies every few weeks, by the last week, we might be getting 12 a day
---
How do I get these rewards? I’m just getting the basic ones. Help before it gets patched I can grind 🥺
---
EDIT: PLEASEEEEEEEE
---
I just use the Carnivore mutation and eat all the raw meat everything drops and even spoiled meat and vegetables (which turn into meat from bacteria I guess) since you can just eat more of them to offset occasional food poisoning and water is easy to come by. It's discount Cannibal and incredibly lazy, just how I like it.
---
I hear you.  My camp is out in The Mire and normally having 20+ weapons for sale is incentive for people to want to visit.   I watched today and in a 4 hour window no one came to my camp.
---
I want to believe you, but sometimes these posts are scams in hoping someone feels sorry for you and gives you a weapon you want but never had. I have seen that too many times on here with sob stories. It's the new creative way of scamming people since people are not giving away weapons for free in trades first anymore. Food for thought, if anyone plans on helping this guy out.
---
Add me BigRich86 I should be on a lot tomorrow during the day. My camp has almost all the ultracite plans for cheap
---
I've been insta-kicked from teams as well. And it's annoying because they never give a reason.
---
5k. fuck these inflation bitches.
---
It also helps to read those loading screens. And listen when the npcs talk. Seriously, I rarely have issues with these events myself, but other people just don’t read.
---
I would love to be lucky and find one, today I have only seen new players, quite a few older than lvl 100
---
I am one too !
---
I love Insult bot. He normalizes the humiliating nature of the game.
---
Server lag is abysmal tonight.  I suspect that's what you're experiencing.  My converter takes up to 2 minutes to load.
---
Same. Radiation solo is great xp so I don't mind if nobody ever shows up.
---
Mine works on Steam right now.
---
I did, but every time I tried it I got the NoRegionPing Error. I pretty much copied the command above word for word (just I fixed the quotations and made sure the drive letter and username were correct.)
---
I personally filled out all my armor first, since my Marsupial gets me most places, and my PA gets me anywhere else. 
---
I chose this because I think full SS looks awesome, and I dont have enough self control to save 2k while wearing  unmatching armor.
---
My friend was sharing cannibal and it caused my other friend to scream "OH MY GOD WHY IS NOSTALGIA CRITIC EATING HIM" ... His character is the Nostalgia Critic
---
I'm not quite sure, this game can be weird. Have you really been to 20 locations and no luck?
---
I’m not asking for anything out of this. I just want others to be careful, I just wanted to rant about it. I was extremely hurt and angry from the whole situation
---
Yeah, I've experienced the same.
---
Luckily today was different. I went to Uranium Fever and used the 'follow me' emote (which shows up on your teammates screens), and everyone showed up to join me for it and we kicked ass. It was nice. I wish more teams would be like that.
---
Ya but you don't get any of the rare plans without all 3 :-(
---
NP, good luck!
---
But not the most popular, which blows my mind. If they put out a skin for the fixer/combat rifle they'd make a ton off it.
---
Didn't work for me.
---
Edit:Copied the wrong thing, works now.
---
As soon as I walked in the door and spotted a scorched tired up, boom, Explosive Railway Spike to the head. Then I got in trouble.
---
I’ve talk to the scammer list and I put a bounty on him until he gives me back my weapon. I’ll even give him a BE fixer if I get my combat rifle back
---
Thanks for all the info mate i didnt know tou could travel back to the vault for free, and I didn't know you get caps when friend finish quests..
---
Do you have any more useful info mate im fresh from the vault in 76
---
Hahaha I feel you dude
---
you say the buffs won't matter but...
---
If you have speed demon and carnivore you are essentially unkillable while it's active.
---
SO it buffs you with 40 max health, carnivore increases that to 80, 100 with strange in numbers
---
Speed demon has a weird side effect where if your health is below the amount you get from a buff you heal extraordinarily rapidly, faster than healing factor, whenever you are moving.
---
So you need to be one shot from 80+ health in order to die when you eat that thing, which if you have more than 200 armor is almost impossible for most enemies to achieve.
---
Since the recent buff to carnivore it is actually worth considering good with salt and some of the more tedious cooking recipes. 
---
Scorchbeast mixed meat stew is still hilariously terribad.
---
I think the wendigo has built in fireproof like the queen so it's not completely resistant to explosive
---
Someone could have a FO1st tent in the vicinity that you just didnt see. My friend and I do this purposely to not spawn our camp when full on caps. 
---
Could also be an issue with servers like OP suggests, just offering insight.
---
You're welcome.
---
Just did it a few moments ago. Went up about 20k XP. It's nice
---
Haven't we all?
---
100 SCORE for 10k exp isn't as bad as it sounds, at least for high level players. I can easily get over 30k exp from events like "Line in the Sand" and "Guided Meditation" and I don't have any crazy 60int build or anything. At level 400+ I think I actually get more exp from the repeatable weekly just grinding the daily level up challenge.
---
It's awful when that happens. This is why I carry a pipe pistol for this exact type of situation, otherwise I would one-shot all the things, even when I try not to with my other gear.
---
Yah for melee that's power attacking the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish. Short of carrying around some other low level non legendary weapon and switching to it via the hot wheel there are no good solutions. On a different note its not too often that I see melee builds one shooting legendaries (even though they have the dps to do so) for me I see a lot of fixers and handmade one shooting legendaries. Don't mean to ruffle anyone's feathers.
---
I have another issue with this particular game installed from xbox game pass, it seems that i have two file, one sized 74gb at C:\\Program Files\\ModifiableWindowsApps\\Fallout 76
---
and the other 
---
\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\BethesdaSoftworks.Fallout76-PC\_3275kfvn8vcwc = 67gb
---
Somebody can explain me this?
---
I forgot what insult he hurled at me was but then he quoted Michael Scott at the end. 
---
 "Boom. Roasted"  
---
My wife and I are huge Office fans.  She got a kick out of it.
---
Nice man I’ll pay you some caps for it, I won’t be home until around 11 pm but I’ll add you
---
This must be why there’s so many wendigos 👏
---
Because your subscription is under memberships on the Microsoft store.
---
I'm fine with nude enemies as long as they're killable.
---
Waited till last 30 seconds earlier on rad rumble ended up starting by myself and just killing ghouls and half way thru a few people showed up. And it failed anyways
---

---
That’s a good question and I’m honestly not too sure, while I rarely have camp placement issues it does happen occasionally and I depending on what i’m doing i’ll sometimes stay on that server anyways especially if i’m only doing the dailies.
---
Same issue here, it's not even showing up on the Microsoft website
---
It's capped at 8 people per instance, though I've done it as part of a pair.  
---
It's difficult but manageable, mostly paying attention to your surroundings, trying not to get crushed by rocks, or run into acid/radioactive waste/flaming coal/an enormous drill, while fighting off a constant swarm of Wendigo Spawn, which aren't quite as menacing as regular Wendigo.  
---
All and all it's pretty fun though the timer to escape the mine collapse could be a little longer.
---
Not there either, It's just... No where
---
That's far from new.
---
this is one of the oldest tricks in the book tbh
---
The reason you’ve had good success with groups when it comes to events, is because we’re still fairly early into this seasons thing and people are farming xp hard. Doesn’t mean they aren’t bored doing those events, just that they’re currently willing to do so in order to progress in the legendary run.
---
Yeah in that case bashing works just fine
---
you think somebody did this long of a con for a mere 2 star combat shotgun? either this is made up or there is more to the story.
---
No problem if you would come up with what kind of build you wanna run so I have an idea of what gonna be doing
---
These are stunning. They look like they could be promotional art.
---
Added. Usually play on the weekends, but I wouldn’t mind a fourth fixer plan
---
It's less worth it at a low level because you will constantly be getting new higher level weapons but at a higher level it's definitely worth it as well as if you have a gun your gonna use alot just have to repair it but mods make a difference
---
You forgot to mention the cursed items.
---
Thanks for all the helpful info mate. Any chance you know of a list that tells me all the perks that work like that in groups
---
should’ve left the server.
---
As a Canadian: I was pleased someone else remembered curling.
---
You shut your fucking mouth. You are a fat and obese midget with a micropenis.
---
Yeah tbh I really should do more events, maybe that's the issue here lol.
---
This breaks the forums rules.
---
I was thinking the same thing.  Where was the obligation to give it back?  Or even remain friends?  
---
I’ve had several friends in this game that just never signed in again.
---
Nope the challenges just get harder as you go it seems so at the start I had kill 1 legendary as a daily now its kill 3 for a daily
---
You have to use the Steam program not the website.
---
Just a heads up, you can server hop when that happens to avoid the damage from the nuke. Also, sadly that happens sometimes. However, just wait til you can launch nukes, then sweet sweet revenge.
---
Ballistic Fist, Displacer Glove, Zap Glove (Paladin Toasters one of my fav weapons). Althought these could also just be mods.  The Settler Gauntlet comes close to the zap glove but doesn't have the lightning animation.
---
 Too bad melee AoEs will be exclusive to legendary perks it seems too, otherwise we could have the 'explosive/tesla' effects for melee with those. A Zap Glove that chains lightning like the Tesla gun would be so cool.
---
Funnily enough, you can actually launch a nuke *at* the encryptid, and it completes the event instantly, no pylons required.
---
The assaultron might indeed have "a shield so strong nothing can dent it", but it's still not impervious to an ICBM being dropped on its head.
---
I know they're working on improving them since they're so useless atm.
---
If you dont have hard bargain and travel agent the wth are you doin my dude?? Lol
---
Whens Double xp weekend??
---
I mostly took the question to be "is the fight difficult?"  
---
I mean, the Cursed items are cool and all, but the Wendigo Plushy that roars when you click on it? That's the real winner in my books.  
---
That said, the shovel is pretty good as after as a holdout melee weapon goes. Really uncertain about the harpoon gun though.
---
Yeah I do the same, using the 'follow me' emote to let others tag.
---
I will say that there has been a few times when there's a group of miners and there is a legendary mixed in, and due to my Gun Fu perk I basically go through all of them and insta-kill the weaker legendaries before I realize it's a legendary. Totally not intentional, but it happens.
---
Awesome idea and with the new Slocum's Joes set you can actually setup a working dinner with vendors selling food and beverages.    
---
I would like to cook more stuff also, but its not worth the hassle with the rate at which cooked stuff spoils..
---
capture a workshop. plant crops. Pick crops. Use a Turbo-Fert fertilizer grenade. Pick crops.
---
It's a no from me for planting cranberries and snaptails in camp. For reasons you stated.
---
The people who give to these are wanting to help. Whether the OP is lying or not, it’s still helping a fellow waster.
---
Leave it. Let them enjoy the good feeling.
---
Im a bloodied build as well but can take a pylon.  My gamer tag is PyrosComradery look forward to knocking out some events with you if your down!
---
I just run to the Wayward right away.   Make a piece of armor and a weapon at the Overseers camp and that'll get you to lvl 3 along with talking to Dutchess.
---
How do you transfer stuff using first? I didn’t know you could
---
Well, a "bounty" in this game is useless. Can't grief him. All he has to do is block the person trying and poof.
---
Yes it’s worth it. That’s how you’ll do the most damage. 
---
If your weapons break... just fix them at a workbench. Maybe I’m reading too much into this post but please tell me that you know you can use junk to repair your gear when it breaks.
---
For many events I have to go into my pip boy and activate it. If I forget I still get credit though. PS4
---
Same thing happen to me in violent night I was about to beat it but just before the wendigo it ended just disappeared never spawned him in and didn’t get anything
---
I only ever saw a player vendor have it for 15k and I said nope and then I made a post on here and someone said they would sell for 5k and I took the deal. But next event I got one. So I figured I would help someone out. It’s the only one I have gotten. To tell you the truth I think I’ve only played that event maybe 6 times since I started playing again in October
---
If you're lower level take  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Luck\_of\_the\_Draw](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Luck_of_the_Draw) in luck. Maybe stick 1 or 2 points in gunsmith. Most builds use at least 5 luck so it'll not be wasted.
---
I've got about 1200 hours in. 2 characters level 260 and 185. Thursday I gave a level 60 a fully modded set of X01 because I told him I'd make him a jetpack for free and didn't feel like switching flux from 1 character to my main. I think I made his day. Calibrated shocks, targeting hud, tesla Bracers, the jetpack and quantum paint. So many people help out real low levels but forget about the in between levels on your first play through.
---
I’ve been rolling with the raider pillage backpack as it doesn’t seem to clip too badly. Too bad the wrapped cap removes your beard. Been wearing the grey knit cap, patrolman sunglasses and the raider path finder mask so far
---
Also if someone could post a decent video for setting up the emitters correctly, that’d be awesome. Tried and failed once, but I couldn’t ever get the traps to spray radiation
---
Wow I never realized how good carnivore is. I pretty much don't eat fruits of veggies anyway, I should probably pick it up, especially if spoiled stuff counts.
---
I always played solo until public teams, so now people see me chowing down on corpses and they start doing the vomit emote.
---
I really hope so too. If it is, ranking up will be a breeze. The repeatable XP is already pretty easy.
---
I think it’s pretty much a
---
Guarantee..
---
But do they reward more than 250?
---
This was the guy that I played with every day. He knew that the weapon was his until I found him a better one, but that I did want that one back because it was sentimental to me
---
Yup, I gave up for the time being
---
welcome to the internet! I hope you enjoy your stay!
---
Oof. How bad is it?
---
I fear FO76 might reach RDO levels of fatigue. I genuinely like the game, but I dont have much drive to keep getting more stuff because all I use it for it to shoot the scorchbeast Queen and collect flux. Which is getting kinda boring.
---
One of ours in our group always shares Cannibal; we often find ourselves accidentally chowing down on corpses in the middle of battle. 😂 We all teasingly whine about it as we then get beat/shot/whatever as we wait to finish our unexpected snack, but its all in fun.
---
I personally want more unique weapons.
---
Most Of them?
---
Sometimes I do the "come here" emote while standing over a corpse and when someone walks over I eat it. You can imagine how many of them react. The perk is a lot of fun haha.
---
If you have a full stash at level 20 you are doing something wrong
---
I agree. I'm over level 300 and when I started looking into what it would take to get a nice fixer, handmade ect I knew I wasn't even close nor would I likely ever be. I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for yet but I'm thinking my chances have gone way up and I might even be able to use the in game currency, maybe
---
I made the same point earlier. This dude can walk out of his base and see thousands of legacies right now. So why would he take my two star combat rifle that meant the world to me?
---
July 16 - 20
---
Maybe they shouldn't use their best guns if they want to share the xp/legendaries.  If your weapon is too op, just loot a shitty shotgun off one of the miners and use it to tag mobs instead.
---
Sounds exactly how I felt after getting a single star instigating gauntlet.. I mean, it’s almost decent enough to save, but still just a one star. On the other hand, I have had a ton of luck rolling for plasma casters. My best yet is a TSFF 25ap cost caster from around 10 tries
---
Just loot one of their shotguns while you're there and use it for the event.  Sharing is caring.
---
The quotations in the command are needed for it to work right. After running the command it should say...
---
symbolic link created for c:\Users\MyUser\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Project76.ini &lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt; D:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps\Fallout 76\Project76.ini
---
If you go into windows explorer and look in your c:\Users\MyUser\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 folder there will be a Project76.ini file whose icon has a little shortcut icon on it and the file type will be .symlink.
---
I’d be thrilled with one of those pods from FO4 or whatever device was in FO3 that let us go to alternate settings. I’d even give Nuka World another play through with my 76 main if we could have FO4 time travel or whatever story device could place us in Boston.
---
Serendipity + dodgy can help a little bit.
---
No problems. I normally turn in all my dailies only when I'm in a group for both reasons actually haha
---
Let's see...there's various things I could recommend but I think there's too much to just say. If there's any specific questions you have, I can try answering them for you. 
---
A few things off the top of my head, try working on the storyline or quests in general to level early on if you don't plan on doing events or such. Otherwise, if you do do events, grab something with a high RoF and try to tag everything. 
---
Make sure to scrap all your junk, gear you aren't using, and try to store your junk as you drop it if you die. Don't carry too much wood and steel as you can get them easily. You most likely won't use very much ceramic, concrete, and glass so keeping maybe 10-20 is plenty IMO. Other materials like leather and rubber can be useful, but since I don't use them much, I just bulk them as a tinkerer's bench and sell it off. Depending on how much you play, getting water purifiers at your camp can be incredibly useful(just be sure to lock your purifiers). Try to not hold onto much ore or gunpowder as they tend to weigh you down and there isn't any way to reduce their weight. Unless you're going for some kind of explosive build, don't hold onto grenades, mines, missiles, mini-nukes, and such as they weight a lot(they also seem to be pretty useless/weak right now too). Watch out for other heavy weight ammunition(fusion cores, plasma cores, railway spikes, harpoons, cannon balls). If you're still having weight trouble, weight reduction perks, alcohol(whiskey specifically), and ribeye steak(several brahmin at flatwoods) are options.
---
Like said, if you have any other questions, feel free to ask and I'll try to answer them.
---
We had somebody before give us 10 of them and we all had 1000 caps but then we ran out and I cannot fast travel I got fallout 2 weeks ago
---
I’m not bothered about the Christmas and Halloween awards, as it’s obvious those were going to be rolled out every season, but when someone I play with told me the recent loveseat, chandelier, fire pit etc rewards were showing up for him then that did piss me off. What was the point of the time gating of those if they can just be randomly added back in via incompetence? It makes me feel like grinding for anything time limited may well be pointless in the long run.
---
I have a B/25/25 fixer if you want it. 
---
Haha just kidding that’ll cost you 30k caps
---
3 Serendipity helps. 45% chance to avoid all damage.
---
3 Dodgy. 30% Damage reduction for 30AP.
---
Problem is, if you are using the beam splitter mod you have 5 explosions in your face. Pretty hard to survive that.
---
I always use the "follow me" emote when the legendary pops up so everyone can get their hits in. In fact, I do that for every event I participate in.
---
Do better, folks.
---
Couldn’t agree more. Got this game at launch and turned away pretty quickly. Played it again when Wastelanders launched and been hooked ever since
---
I have had so many enemies I killed just not let me loot them. Like the body is there but there is no way to loot and it’s happening more and more. Normally it’s just normal enemies but today a 3 star legendary was stuck in a car and couldn’t loot it. The event thing never happened to me other then once during a queen fight I fought it was able to loot the queen but didn’t get no rewards for doing the event like the flux caps or the 2 star armor
---
I’ve had 10 of them before and I ran out of caps
---
New Vegas?
---
I really am hoping that there’s a reason why he blocked me on everything the way he did, Since I really did enjoy hanging out with him
---
The fixer you can craft has improved sneak or something that is also added to legendary perk effects
---
I feel with the mess they made with the screaming eagle skin it would be much easier for them to just make it its own weapon
---
Too vague to give you any useful information.
---
You're a true monster.
---
Building is def much easier with a controller IMO.  I still use keyboard and mouse though.  The mouse makes the difference in aiming precision and speed compared to a joystick with adjustable sensitivity.
---
WoW led the way for addictive game mechanics. Companies literally consult psychologist when developing game mechanics and reward systems.
---
Yea, this is an addictive system for those who need to feel completion and dont regularly shell out money for a game they already bought.
---
Bloodied builds use radiation damage to stop their health from going too high. That perk will heal radiation damage during the day, so if it's shared, it's going to be super annoying for bloodied characters.
---
What quests do you do endgame? There doesn’t seem to be anything fun tbh
---
Can’t loot anything where? If you mean still on the vault... yea very few things are actually lootable down there.
---
Hey congrats! What platform are you on? If it’s PC I have a mod for that sledge
---
With rank 3 Inspirational, cranberry relish and a decent sleep, we could break the back of this thing by Sunday. Open 3 lunch boxes too and you could be on 320% XP.
---
Sorry I forgot to reply that it worked
---
Can’t you... just do whatever you want in the game?
---
Bloody weapon deal more damage when you have low HP and that perk heals you passively while in daylight.
---
Exactly
---
It happened the 1st time I ran through it.  The 2nd time, the dialogue stuck, so I had to pop him to get the quest to continue
---
There’s a typo in the year. 2041.
---
No I did not whenever I pressed the repair option it asked if I wanted to use repair kits not junk. How do you repair with junk?
---
Happened to me earlier today. Asked a guy to let me get a shot in and he said “Git gud”
---
Jesus how do you sell so much shit a day?! No One ever comes to mine
---
Thanks man!! Unfortunately it's PS4, the only mod I have  is the Heated Coil 😁
---
Anyways, thanks for the offer 😃👍🏻
---
I got 2 meat the other day and tried to give this a go. Got the cranberries, got the spices, and stated hitting fissures and getting wings, brains, hearts, lungs. FINALLY got the third meat, FT back to Camp to cook... And the first two meat had spoiled. @#$-&amp;#_@!
---
When you are at a weapon workbench go to modify. Select your weapon. Select inspect/repair. Then select “workbench repair”. 
---
Same thing for armor.
---
There are perks that allow you to repair past 100%. Repairing at a workbench is the most effective way to repair gear.
---
I paid only 5k for mine after I posted on here being I saw a guy wanting 15k fuck that. I got a drop the next event I will give it away because fuck it
---
I haven’t sold anything in 4 days tbh. My items are set way below market too. 
---
I like the idea of new players, but today’s been server hopping day as most of the servers don’t even have camps set up and/or vendors. Lol
---
That's what I'm talking about! I can already get the repeatable about 10 to 12 times in a day. If they do it for double. Then maybe 20 times or more.
---
I believe i can help you with the ultracite, and i thin i have som raider, too.
---
ill likely be on later tonight, midnight or after though.  
---
If not then,  then tomorrow between 12.15 and 12.45p.  Aj ninetyeight
---
Ahh thanks
---
Don't use it close quarters
---
Yeah I saw that, it might be the first one I'm going to max for legendary perks, even more so if I can freely swap it between alts. It'll either be infiltrator or the Ammo crafting one. Probably infiltrator as I often I have more ammo than I can shoot as it is now with ammo smith+super duper. I never take the hacking perks, there are so few termimals you need to hack that I never felt it was worth the points to bother with it, something I'd get past 50 thou when I have no other perks to get, but not something i'd get below 50.
---
“vault dweller 2054 called, he wants his dumb blue jumpsuit back”
---
You can also use the friendly fire perk to keep it alive
---
Yeah I was just wondering peoples opinions on it. I didn't plan to use it past just testing to see if it still worked on a alt I do not play.
---
lord the 20 - 35 portion of the game is tough. everything kills you, your build is half complete so pretty useless, you're broke constantly, run out of scrap constantly lol. we've all been there. it gets better, somewhere between 35 and 40, you find your feet.
---
Great job and congrats on the nice sledge!
---
have you ever considered going unarmed? Once you go unarmed you never go back lol
---
Dude I did the same thing played at launch got to lvl 50  maybe killed one scorch beast because it was new at the time ...didnt see anyone alive in game besides other players..put it down because I didnt understand what the objective was came back after wastelanders now I been on everyday through 3 dupes so far in like 3 months... Im having a blast honestly.
---
Honestly I view the lockpocking mini game as pointless anyhow. Bobby pins are so plentiful that there’s almost no way I’m not getting into whatever lock I’m picking. So why waste the time with trying to find the sweet spot? I don’t think it’s a cheat, personally, just bypassing a tedious mechanic that barely belonged in 2011’s Skyrim.
---
Definitely just a time saver mod.
---
Wow yeah I don’t have no where near that but thanks anyways
---
I'd just settle for a meat processing station and bait traps to harvest from. Carnivores need their love and an alternative to the turbo-fert.
---
Maybe a "hunter" collectron that gathers meat and hides.
---
This is a bug.  It seems to happen to me every other time I log in.  Sometimes it's the normal white workshop icons, but sometimes it's the blue fast travel icons with no info.  I just either server hop until it fixes itself or deal with it.
---
&gt; You guys lived through all the bugs and the patches that created more problems then they fixed.
---
We're still in those days lol
---
I'll happily keep most of those memories locked away and treasure a few. The first time I found an explosive drop, before they were nerfed, was quite an exhilarating moment. It also happened to be a gatling plasma, and back then nobody knew the infinite power those would end up wielding
---
Good luck out there. The UI needs to be improved big time. It used to be more straight forward before repair kits were added to the game.
---
One born every minute. https://imgur.com/a/J1eTWJH
---
How about the mentioning that you’re a female and having a hard time trick lmao
---
I’m off for the night just saw this
---
It might be your location. For example my camp is on the far west of the map (south of hunters ridge) and no one comes by my camp. I get like 2 a week.
---
i sell the western outfit for 3k, it goes reasonably fast. the western with chaps I've sold 3 in the last two weeks at 7k. gotta be patient for high priced stuff, but ppl will buy it.
---
YES
---
(Mason Jars bc Appalachia, but yes)
---
I'm level 260 on my main and I was using a level 15 pipe rifle. Then the dicks start one shotting everything and I got pissed and pulled out my junkies ffr gatling gun and started cranking. Then they gave me the angry emote. They were all level 70 to 90.
---
Anti armor Fixer
---
The ones you haven’t done yet
---
Just mod fallout 4. Wayyyyy better!
---
Thanks, I always forget about that tab.
---
I just wish we had more of endgame contect dungeons at least.....like turn watoga underground Into a big bend type dungeon...just make it with 4 person cap...with a phase boss at the end put some upgrades in there and maybe a new currency ( I know that's a touchy subject here) with more gear to buy.
---
You cant tame anything that's hostile. You have to find them at specific places and they are passive towards the player. Look up an old guide that explains it.
---
They have to be at random encounter locations in order to tame
---
You might get your shot nowadays as with pub teams I've seen project paradise way more popular than ever before, I myself got the bear plans just yesterday because of pub teams
---
how on earth can people have finished already? they don't give you enough daily or weeklies to do that. are you guys just playing constantly grinding the 100 score per 10k xp repeatable?? how many hours do you play for that to be plausible, out of curiosity?
---
Sounds like the Achilles heel for melee bloodied builds. It was hard enough back when I ran full health and an instigating powerfist, but now melee usually brings me a quick death
---
There are certain locations on the map that get nuked frequently and you want to avoid putting your base near them. Many people dropping the nuke will try to avoid player bases, but not all will. Others will purposely nuke bases for any number of reasons or just for fun. I'm guessing your base is near Morgantown? That area gets nuked from time to time because of all the cobalt flux that's there. 
---
As for what to do, always check the map when a nuke alert comes up. If your base is in the zone, you can server hop to avoid getting it destroyed but you have to do it fairly quickly. Or you can stay and then repair your camp. Either way, it's a sometimes fun part of the game. I personally nuke my own camp every time I want to move somewhere else as a way to say goodbye to the old base.
---
Jealous down votes? I can too and actually prefer to run it solo. Even when I'm with friends I play with all the time. I don't have to wait for anyone and it seems like less robots spawn when you're solo.
---
😂 that’s fair
---
&gt;Reply
---
still which perk card is used?
---
I do the same
---
Yup refusing to speak to you is his most common insult for me.
---
Pipe pistols. So. Many. Pipe pistols.
---
Really wish it was like fallout 4 where they gave you a small permanent bonus.
---
I'd forgotten about The Burrows as well. It's a gold mine for XP.
---
That’s where my camp used to be
---
Blocker also doesn't seem to always be working either.
---
To be fair, encrypted cost someone 2k caps and since no one else chipped on that 2k why wait lol
---
yeah but that might advantage dupers and older players to much. I think a game of having one active magazine is better since low level players could still find a good one early on but get a better one later.  
---
High level players would not have a huge advantage.
---
Spent hours vendor hopping, never found a single duped weapon
---
Thanks man!! 😃👍🏻
---
Actually, I was thinking about a sneaky build with a power fist or a deathclaw gauntlet and the Chinese armor......
---
But that's not my style 🤣🤣🤣
---
My current build works with and without power armor,  and that's what I love about it... However, maybe I can be tempted for that side of the "force" 😁😁
---
I think intelligents
---
You are definitely not wrong on the first part.
---
As for the massive amount of Purified Water I see the "water camps" with between 5-20 water purifiers and I'm blown away. I have one small purifier in my camp and it provides me more than I could ever need to use and with the caps limit fighting the stash limit I either find myself throwing away food/water/junk/legendaries or buying plans I don't need and vendoring them for diminishing returns.
---
It has been happening to me as well, not every time and not every event
---
I love popping in the card for Encrypted and seeing how long before someone else fires off the event.
---
Considering I'm already walking around with every weight reduction perk because perks not applying to stash boxes mean carrying a hundred weapons on me makes more sense than having to ditch 75 of them to fit.
---
Well occasionally the station says something about Galaxy News Radio between the Silver shroud recordings
---
I liked how they gave it a whole theme and not made it really boring like some other game s
---
Thank you for all this info! Only been playing a month and am still trying to get my bearings haha. Super helpful 🤘🏼
---
My white knight seems to be working?
---
&gt;used to be
---
Yes. Used to be....
---
Right now I'm running fill SS buttressed with the shielded under armor. Just need the helmet now and to get better legendary roles... But the resistance points are rediculus, landed a few vanguard pieces as a full health build but I've heard there's diminishing returns and getting one of each like zealots and what not is better so I'll probably keep trying for those
---
It's agility
---
Thanks man, I keep having level 50 super mutants attack my camp and my level 4 turrets go down in one hit.
---
I mean that's what the vault raids were supposed to be essentially, tbh if they just would have awarded full XP on kills it would have been a lot more worthwhile.
---
Neat, I've seen the movie but didnt know there was an actual board game.
---
I'm a girl but you're very welcome ☺️🖤
---
I can help as well if theres room. I run a Bloodied Hm/Gatling laser build. An extra gun generating dps cant hurt lol. My Gt is The Rustard.
---
Yes it still works but it takes even longer now with all of the new random encounters added to the pool over the last few months (maybe just Wastelanders). I had two characters’ pets die (as they often do) within a day of each other and spent 2.5 hours with the first replacement, fortunately just under an hour with the second. I just run the Cranberry Glade over and over until I get the pet I’m looking for.
---
I saw someone running around shooting energy ammo (I think - it was blue) with a Paddle ball. I think I might have the video but didn't want to post it.
---
If you're too low level to actually do any damage on the ghouls, please put on a hazmat suit and collect ore or grab a shishk and friendly fire and keep the NPCs alive.
---
You can get one instantly on top of wes tek.
---
Good ideas but this would implement 50 new bugs lol
---
/sarcasm
---
but how does the encounter work? and which perk card should I use? Ive had a ton of trouble trying to wrap my head around the mechanics.
---
Animal Friend 3 is all you need.
---
This game is dying fast cause of this duping. All the people saying it good for the game will be proven wrong very quickly.
---
GG
---
I have a quest for you
---
The main and wastelanders quests. The grind for faction rep takes a really long time so the sooner the better because if you have a short attention span or get bored of a game easily you won't ever gain access to the really good weapons and camp plans that only unlock after those factions are maxed.
---
Yea I heard about that.
---
There is just something about it giving you one that makes it that much more sweet. 
---
If anyone was wondering...
---
Luck: 3
---
Attempts: Idk I hit the thing every time I pass one
---
No. Iirc it takes whatever is the highest, so it would take your friends rank 2
---
I ignore the NW challenges. I can get enough exp from the repeatable in half the time it takes to do some of them.
---
But I'm a lone wanderer, settler.
---
Tell.me more
---
Do they? 
---
I assumed they pay for the license to use it in the game period
---
Animal Friend 3. Just approach the random encounter solo creature with your weapon drawn and you should see the “tame” option appear. Click, head back to your base and wait.
---
I meant are there any specific wuest I should do ? Like for better rewards or general have a better pay out, I should of been more specific my bad lol
---
does the animal have to be passive prior though?
---
If you're not big on grinding, there isn't much. You pretty much grind events that give you legendaries, and complete all the dailies you can to work towards the gold bullion plans to max out your build. I made my endgame goal to minmax the shotgun build, and I achieved just that.
---
Tell me of this fine quest
---
Are you on Xbox? I can walk you through it in person tomorrow if you’d like.
---
Omg that car bed would be great. Drive in, fly out 😜
---
yeah that would be great!
---
Did you disable the Enlighten ba2's by any chance?
---
I've been trying different dialog options with him now that I finished the rep grind and in one of the options he has the audacity to say something like "We have another ten of these things and don't really need it but it's the principle of the thing." 
---
The bottom line is Ward considers you a hit man. His whole 'I wish it didn't always have to end in violence' is a crock. Just try telling him 'no' some time. He rants about how mercenaries won't even take jobs any more. At least Rocksy doesn't hide the fact that she's hiring you as a hitman.
---
I've been buying unyielding armor if I find it, it's usually a slight upgrade from what I already have.
---
Fuck Ward. When I’m done with settler rep I’m never setting another foot in foundation. For dailies I’ll do raiders lmao
---
Also some way to change them back, as I’m sure some people don’t like the ultracite laser look
---
I don’t know what that means. There are, simply, certain preset encounter areas where they can be tamed.
---
And why are people always ignoring the building team, because it's the best xp boost!
---
I did this today with a few people from this sub. It actually only took 30s after loading in and all that. 
---
I thought it would take forever as I thought you had to find a stimpak before you could revive someone. Thankfully someone here told me that wasn’t the case. 
---
Feel free to msg me in the future if you need Xbox partners to complete quests.
---
Nah the low health stimpack perk and bloodied is A+
---
I found 9 over two matches. Start at the jail then head to the dam then follow the river. For revive I message the other players to meet at the fire edge. Swap killing self. Done and done.
---
oh, someone says you have to find them when the spawn passively or it doesnt work
---
Agree, why buy anything but a b2525 when they are so freely available. Playor vendors will suffer.
---
Same here man, I’m sitting on a shit ton of 3* weapons im trying to unload cause Bethesda thought it was a good idea to give us a scrip limit
---
It saves a load screen to cash in your treasury notes, but other than that, yeah, not much reason to go back to foundation once you've got the Gauss shotgun.
---
This one always confused me early on, it wasn’t until I ran Bloodied that it made sense. Serendipity spawns nearly 1/2 the time. Add in Nerd Rage and Blocker, along with good armor, and you’ll stay alive longer than you’d think. Add in Emergency Protocols on your Power Armor, and you’ll live longer than most full HP builds. 
---
Keeping in mind, of course, that the insane damage you’ll be dealing in Bloodied will stop enemies from hurting you. This is because they’ll be dead well before they see you coming. :)
---
Sometimes shooting behind the mobs deal dmg to them but is further away such that you dont kena
---
He's like a sassy metronome
---
That’s what it said. What I meant was that you had a quotation mark misplaced in the command. Instead of being at the end of the first file path, it was between /Fallout 76 and /Project76.ini in the middle of the path.
---
One gun army should work outside pa.
---
Sent you a private message. We’ll get you a pet tomorrow :)
---
Can play it alone but in a general sense the community does help. If you never bought a single item from someone in game or.met online you'd rely on RNG only. Definitely not hard to enjoy it like this but the experience is much more exciting when you can fine tune your character with proper armor and weaponry. Good luck!
---
I think this game should rip a page from Warframe and just copy and paste warframe’s battlepass content.
---
I have a heap of bloodied stuff that I don't use (stealth/junkies build), I am trying to hold onto them for trades for junkies stuff I'm after though. Do you have any gear for trade or are you looking to buy for caps?
---
\*EDIT\* Mainly Melee and Rifles I think, not sure on heavy guns, may have gotten rid of them already. Also, happy to team up, depending on region, I'm in Australia myself.
---
They definitely buffed the colossus. When it first came out, a friend and I killed one within 30 seconds. He's a bloodied melee and I'm a bloodied rifle build.
---
Tried it again the other day and it was a 5 min fight to kill it and we both died a couple of times.
---
Lock the freaking shed! Or whatever you use to store it!
---
45/70 lever and revolver, animti material rifle w/ various rounds and a milkor grenade launcher.
---
There is also the fact he is wearing a clean variant of the mr fuzzy outfit
---
It's pretty easy to cheese the alpha solo, just get on one of the catwalks and hit him with your highest dps ranged weapon. If your friendly aggros him, it's over but the alpha isn't hard to solo. You can also get the Grafton Monster stuck in the furnace room, but that's more of a luck thing. Still, the good rewards come from keeping more than one alive and you can't do that solo.
---
You can't reach rank 4 completion with only two people.
---
Grenadier doesn't affect explosive effects on weapons
---
I only hit them with weak splash damage and call out there location so others can tag!
---
I'm hoping for a weightless shovel :-)
---
Nice play lol but I'll help any new Comer if I get chance regardless
---
Ever since the vending machines got released.
---
"You have a face only a mother could love... too bad your entire family was killed in the great war"

---
Yea, I don't get it? Why are being being kicked form teams? I was in a full team and some other dude got kicked. I assumed it was so the team lead could bring in someone they know. But sure enough, 20 mins later, we still didn't have a 4th member. Weird.
---
It works for me and I tested it before
---
go into settings, then system, then storage. Make sure you have C drive selected and go to temporary files. I believe that file is a Delivery Optimization File that did not get deleted like it is supposed to (a common issue with windows store apps) and you should be able to delete it there.
---
It's just bad sales right now. My vendor is full of .45, 5.56 and plasma cores and I've only sold 1k this entire weekend.
---
If you play nw right now you can get the presents
---
Might be RNG for you. I see both boring and busy events maps while server hopping. Which, by the way, I’m beginning to think I do way too much.
---
oof I did not realize. Kind of strange to broadcast that you are exploiting on such a high level character.
---
Excavator PA makes it possible, I think. But still, 3+ is ideal
---
Edit: comment below confirmed this does not work
---
You should absolutely look into Mutations. I ignored them until around level 80, and wished that I had bothered with them much earlier. 
---
Make sure to get equipped with the right Luck perk card (can’t remember them name) so you don’t lose them when you get them.
---
Dont take my word but im pretty sure its not in the game but it might have been an atomic shop item
---
I've heard it doesn't effect the radioactive Ore drops as it is a quest item not normal Ore!
---
It’s hard. I love it!
---
Sorry off topic a little but did they fix tagging legendary mobs and getting loot? Or does each person have to tag instead of the team
---
Just wanna add it takes a special piece of software to crash so badly that not even alt f4 or task manager can manage to close it, you need a special award for that bethesda
---
I wouldn't know, I've never crafted or worn PA in FO76, just see multiple people using it in this event
---
I want the junk cannon so I can dump all of this junk. Shoot teddy fears out of it.
---
Was the "let's nuke" emote a free one? It'll be useful in passing on the idea to non mic players.
---
No, but it can be successfully completed up to rank 3, I believe, (confirm my numbers, I think each player can get 40?) if both involved are capable of defending alone.  Then you just be quick and trade off.
---
I never said you could get max reward, just that it is possible, as the comment I replied to said that it "can't"  be completed with 2 people.  Successfully keeping at least one npc alive and getting at least rank 1 reward is still technically successful. Not ideal, but you pass.
---
Personally it doesn't work on any Ore for me, due to some weird glitch.
---
This game needs active content and fast. Its taking 2 long to get it at a fun point.
---
Seems pretty neat.
---
I do every event that pops up. It makes it fun that people are actually doing events again
---
Super Mutants deserve a break. They put in the hours too. Looking for green stuff hardly ever finding any. Sometimes they need to hang dong.
---
PM'd.
---
Keeping one npc alive is easy, yeah I usually keep to a medic role for keeping the npcs alive, only collecting Ore myself when I see someone else can take over from me while I do so!
---
Can confirm excavator does not affect irradiated ore.
---
Buddy dont even start they wont do anything until the dupe has been patched, then the godmode and still there are More game breaking glitch es and bugs
---
It seems inconsistent for me. I still have everyone tag the legendaries.
---
The way I run silos noone can keep up (fly through roof hole) so I just solo them and have my friends wait at SBQ spawn to help there because I cant solo her (yet)
---
Thank you for confirming
---
Oh come on. Aren’t these camps kinda fun? You didn’t lose anything, it got you riled up, he/she didn’t break any rules. I wish I was “trapped” more often. Feels more like post-apocalypse spirit.
---
Thanks!! Yeah I dropped it near Morgantown as a temporary thing and then got stuck into.base building and didn't want to risk moving it.  I've blue printed everything now but I'm a bit anxious that I won't be able to rebuild everything if I move... I'm doing a fair bit of questing up around Grafton now so I might try to move it.  
---
How do you deliberately change to a new server? I stay in whichever one I get put into, unless my bf is online and I move to join him.  I've been lucky in that he is usually on the same server as me or I've been able to bring my camp with me automatically when I join him.  
---
We could have server hopped but I was in the middle of helping him with a quest (he's only level 13) and plus I was curious to see what would happen when I got nuked. 😁
---
Back peddle...quickly.
---
I'm kind of enjoying that mode now, after learning how building works well to getting into hiding places!
---
I’ve noticed a crazy amount of low levels in my servers.  I do most events by myself or with a bunch of 5’s lurking outside the event
---
I am seeing this trend too. I thought maybe my prices were off and I lowered them a little bit and still nothing. Weak sauce
---
With a TSE gatling plasma and a corresponding build I have been able to keep all 4 alive with minimal damage taken when I had to reload while 5 others got ore.  It was a wierd session seeing as the numbers are usually reversed with one guy getting ore and everyone else ghoul farming.  Over quick though.
---
I can't find the file Project76.ini
---
Where is it? Looks like a neat spot.
---
you could say they're super naked
---
Why would it be cheating? Hacking and lockpicking minigames are near braindead. I'd skip them if I could.
---
Psycho, Pyschotats.  Anything that buffs strength and DR
---
oh for sure then
---
The holorifle or anything from OWB to be totally honest. Those are some of the coolest weapons in the series imo. Shame they wouldn't fit lorewise
---
Go to your map, choose options, quit to the main screen, then start the game again. It will put you on a new server. As long as you log off in the first minute or so of the countdown, you will be fine. If you wait too long your base sometimes will be destroyed even in a new server.
---
I had the board game too as a kid but strangely enough never really played it. The idea of owning Zathura I guess was good enough lol.
---
Bethesda's response will be the same as always, an automated message that says they can't restore score, won't do anything at all to help, and lock the ticket before you can reach a person!
---
I grinded out the skeleton on the night the bug came out, and i still havent gotten the jacket and jeans lol. Burned myself out, so i've only been playing it for the dailies and solo at that.
---
Tier skip? That would mean you could pay to get all the rewards with no effort.
---
Yeah, it has definitely felt that way this weekend.
---
I forget the insult, but at the end he said "alerting the burn ward" and I died
---
tag them for search.. screws are not uncommon
---
Sorry, meant logging in each day would unlock the next tier of Legendary Run. Especially since they love to keep everyone coming back each day. Basically a free claim reward for logging in that day
---
The devs absolutely don't respect your time. It's a GaaS model with gross microtransactions. They're going to suck as much time out of you they can.
---
Awesome, thanks for the tip!

If I remember from fallout 4 don't you need scrapper 2 to tag.
---
Just want to point out that while this is sound advice, not enough people highlight how gleefully Fallout 76 preys on addictive tendencies. Just because it's common in other games doesn't mean it's okay.
---
Public team is now a thing, you get a bonus for being in one so definitely worthwhile to do. Score is the new daily grind, has replaced Atoms as the reward for daily/weekly challenges. Depending on score, you get neat rewards, listed under the new menu option Legendary Run, a season pass style board game where you earn stuff. It's not a "premium" option so you'll have access to everything just as everyone else does.
---
I've gotten free range 6 times today, and have done it solo every time. Definitely not as fun when alone
---
The laser rifles from Fallout 1 &amp; 2, the Plasma Caster needs it's little brother back!
---
B/25/25
---
No. And I say this as someone who buys FO1st here and there. They already have "Pay to Win" included in the Legendary Run. Making discounts etc tied to FO1st is just another layer of "Pay to Win" and I dont think thats something I want to see any more of than is already present
---
Thank you!
---
I can run it in about 12 to 15 minutes doing it legit.
---
Here’s my favorite screw location. Hidden spot in Abandoned Bog Town. I try to hit it every day, usually 20-25 screws per run, takes a couple of minutes. It’s in a higher level area though, so if you’re new, be sneaky or just keep it in mind for later. 
---

---
Love canning. Super easy to get started and a great way to preserve food.
---
Yea its definitely all the new players, outside of the forest region everything's kinda dead in most servers, not as many caps to be spent, not as many event participants, and not as many nukes (still get them I know but not as much). Dont get me wrong I love that new players are getting into the game but I feel like it might be a bit too much at once. I know people will probably hate that I said that but it's my opinion.
---
I would love additional rewards at specific ranks, but I don't think they can put more stuff in there, I'd imagine they would only put in a few cosmetics in there.
---
They could multiply the scores 1st players get by ~1.5 instead of making them cheaper in terms of atoms.
---
I got Earl Williams maybe an hour ago after two SBQs were defeated by a large group of us. Now that is some fun stuff. I love it when the scream makes all of us run for the hills!
---
I like the discount idea....
---
Thanks
---
Indubitably
---
We could be nice and you could have just read the recent update notes.
---
I'm lvl 59 would I be able to clear it out with my  Gatling laser?

Attempting this quest right now. Note is missing for me as well. Gonna restart the game and try again. If it's still bugged, I'll move on to something else and try again later.
---
Lets not.
---
1st is fine as it is. My only complaint is them not leaving added content always available, instead of rotating it out like Atomic Shop items. Sure, we're basically buying Atoms once a month and getting all that extra stuff thrown in for free. But it's supposed to be a service, not a store.
---
What about Legendary Run makes it pay to win? It’s a free update that includes in game rewards. It’s a choice to pay for additional levels but it’s possible to grind without paying a cent. So I feel like it kind of makes sense to have additional rewards for an actual paid benefit. I’m also not disagreeing that Bethesda hasn’t gone about FO 1st or Atoms in the best way, but I don’t see Legemdary run as pay to win
---
Wow, what if this was an actual fecking massive raid?
---
The command will still work with the quotes the way I have it listed. You mind trying to delete your Project76.ini file in c:\Users\MyUser\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 and trying the command again as I have it posted. Also try removing read only attribute from the Project76.ini file in your games directory.
---
Using the symbolic link I don't have to have my file set to read only.
---
Nope. Its available to everyone regardless of perks. Open your pip boy and go to Junk. I forget the button  (I think its r1 for PS4 but i may be wrong. Dont have it in front of me right now) but it should be easy to figure out from the bottom menu in the pip boy screen.
---
Depends on the public team for me right now.  If only event teams are on server, I'll jump from event to event.  If a building team is available, I'll do most, if not all of the daily events.  
---
It may be a challenge for lower levels and low cap availability for travel.  Unsure of your level.  If you or a friend have FO1st, go capture as many workshops as you want on a private world.  There's always a defend event right after the capture.  The workshops provide fast travel points too.  I used to do bog town for screws and Hemlock for acid.  
---
When I was a low level, I ran the fertile soil, tea pot, and the Airport event (collision course) over and over.  I also picked the town near the big lake and ran through it over and over to collect caps from Mutants and scrap their gear.  There are blood eagles there now which do not drop caps, but drop good gear.  Eventually, I moved to Wes Tec.
---
Sometimes I get on a stings and things kick when I have a bunch of the junk required.  You can server hop and stock up on acid while completing the stings and things over and over.
---
Basically, go for what you feel like, the levels will come.
---
Also hit 34 yesterday, probably could have been 36-37 if i would do nw but i just hate that mode with fury of 1000 suns...
---
That's exactly the same as just paying and getting the rewards.
---
find the game in the launcher, in the menu u can tell it to check the files
---
Not bad but you could easily oneshot with it so I don't really get your point lol
---
More melee weapons!!!
---
No problem, I reccomend doing at least the first few levels of it to get the ammo converter
---
And Ultracite Ore seems to be the only ores that are not affected by the Excavator set bonus.
---
I don’t disagree—and it truly is all live service games. There are things that Bethesda could do to lessen the impact of those mechanics, while still encouraging engagement and even profitability. 
---
This whole post has me thinking on it. For whatever it’s worth, I’ll be addressing that in a future post and video when I get my thoughts together.
---
I only care about the weapon skins, and I already got most of them. I'll probably be playing a bit of NW anyway but I'm not gonna grind for the outfits intentionally
---
Okay
---
Yeah then die from all of the other mole miners and be completely useless to the event, not to mention you might not have ammo for the shitty weapons they have
---
Ok thanks!
---
Why not leave the server and try a different one?
---
There's a few reasons people will do this. One, if you're sharing rad sponge, be prepared to get kicked out of a lot of teams as that perk ruins bloodied builds. Some people also don't like strange in numbers and other perks. Two, some may just want to have a team with friends. Three, people are weird.
---
What gets me is when someone starts a new builder team when there's already one with open slots. Builder teams aren't worth much unless they're full. I will start one if there is a team already, but if there's one already it's always better to join for that multiplier.
---
Yeah I could
---
No.. you log in and get to claim a Legendary run level. After 24 hours if you log in again you get to claim another. You don’t pay any atoms or money
---
As a new player, low sales could be because we aren't sure we're allowed to go to your camps and buy stuff, lol.  I hit level 20 on the weekend and have just started to explore vendors... Seems like a good concept.  
---
My strategy has been to use the perk cards that find extra ammo and chems while I'm out questing and then sell all my excess stuff. Plus I have some water purifiers going to sell all my extra water. But I'm not really sure what kind of stuff higher levels usually buy?
---
Probably. Or at least get to the area you need to loot. That area is safe.
---
For me that's every Ore, but I've heard from others where it normally works on, this quest Ore also doesn't work.
---
Worked fine for me earlier. PS4 no problems.
---
So say I have my charisma at 4, I can then share a rank 1 perk card. But if my charisma is at 6, then I can share a rank 2 card? Or two rank 1 cards?
---
Because it gives FO1st users an advantage that isnt available to anyone else unless they pay for the sub too. The choice to pay to advance levels is there and is available to everyone. Everyone has that same choice and therefore is a level playing field. Making an additional advantage to FO1st subscribers isnt a level playing field anymore
---
Yeah, only being able to turn in 150 per day is a horrible idea...
---
I didn't even notice Zorbo on the board, lol
---
Yea the 1.5x multiplier is the same concept as the discount. Just the opposite direction. I’m with you there. And yea I could see additional rewards being good too. More along the lines of traditional battle passes
---
i'm a mutie and those spoiled veggies help make sure i'm running at least one non-debilitating disease at all times.  parasites and dysentery are the best diseases for the plague walker mutation due to the fact the worst they do to me is i have to eat and drink more.
---
the diseases don't negate the well fed/hydrated bonuses and between herbivore and vaccinated i have to eat less of them less often while not worrying about getting properly bad diseases.
---
see i have a plan.  maybe not the best, but it is a plan none the less.
---
Alright, thanks.
---
I'm interested if you're still looking for someone to help?
---
Sure!
---
35 and ahead! Yay.
---
I’m telling you I did delete the file before hand, and look at your original post. When I copied the command (I put it into notepad first to put my name and drive letter in) i got an invalid path error until I fixed the quotations.
---
I just started again after being dissatisfied at launch. It’s too bad I can’t get any of my friends who had a similar experience at launch to try again. I restarted on a new character and some of these missions and creatures you have to fight are really hard to do alone.
---
If I could have one wish granted for the Ally system, it's that their random dialog and interact with crafting stations and instrument ADHD has a 10 minute cooldown before playing and activating again.
---
Please, Bethesda. Spare my sanity.
---
I want to play with you. :)
---
As a new player, I like the concept of the Legendary Run but yes I agree, I miss earning the atoms.  I guess the LR is good for longterm players that have a lot of the atomic shop stuff already though.  I really want a few things from the shop but I might just buy the atoms to get them.
---
My psn is fakenunchucks. How do we join nw together?
---
She’ll die in one hit to combat inhibitor
---
What doesn’t make this pay to win is that everything is achievable without paying. That’s the difference. It’s the same concept as Warframe. 100% doable with a grind but much easier by paying. 
---
Not to say Fallout 1st isn’t overpriced or give advantages that should be available to everyone but I think this is an easy upgrade to something that lacks benefits in general
---
I’ll add you, then you can join my team in the main menu. I’ll invite you
---
Make sure you have the woodchucker perk equipped and you can get a lot of wood from Helvetia in the piles there.  Plus there is a logging camp I can’t remember the name of at the moment.
---
As for steel make sure scrapper is equipped and grab all the weapons you can find to scrap.  You get more than double the steel that way from scrapping.
---
Edit: sylvie and sons logging camp with the woodchucker perk equipped will help get a fair amount.
---
I'll try that one haha
---
Maybe I’m just bad lol
---
I've been doing the same thing! I'm not alone!
---
Sounds good!
---
Thanks ill do that. I just need to level up :)
---
When that happens to me, I find it helpful to leave VATS and then immediately re-enter it.  For this reason, also, I've pretty much abandoned my gauss shotgun and learned to embrace a standard one.  At short range, a standard shotgun + VATS deals an insane amount of damage.  There's something almost magical about using VATS with shotguns, because you don't get nearly the amount of damage without it (I figure it's either an undocumented/accidental feature or something involving concentrating all the pellets in one location).
---
Dead Men tell no tales.
---
You need to tag screws for search. Some common junk items that have screws are alarm clocks, globes, hot plates, and giddyup buttercup bodies. Wendigos also drop a bit of screws. So to tag screws for search you go to your junk list in your Pip-Boy and you wanna go into ‘component view’. On ps4 it’s gonna be R1. Then you go down to screws and you press X or whatever console you’re on and screws will now be tagged for search. So from now on when you come across junk in the wasteland, those items that contain screws will now have a magnifying glass beside their name
---
Sent invite
---
between the care and lore in the world, and the fact the netcode is bolted onto an obsolete single player engine.... i'd wager 76 IS what's left of the "next" fallout in the same way that all the gta online stuff for gta 5 has been  shown through datamines to be what's left of the originally planned singleplayer expansions.
---
THANK YOU!  i keep trying to make "vault 51" or "v51" happen, but nope!  it is so *not fetch*
---
Looks pretty cool
---
That's really strange...I just copied and pasted the command too editing for user name and drive letter and it worked without throwing an invalid path error. I wasn't doubting you tried deleting it I was just asking to try doing the whole thing again with the quotes as is to see if it made a difference. I've no idea why it worked for me but not for you. The read only attribute being different is the only other thing I can think of.
---
There’s a rock in the river behind the wayward that has 3 copper deposits in it that become 12 if you collect wearing excavator. That’s the one I used the most as it was by my camp. 
---
Other than that there’s bits all over where ores are. There’s a couple at hornwright 3 too, as well as a lot of iron deposits for steel, but the best way to get steel is farm weapons and use scrapper perk to scrap them. Do west tek or anywhere with a lot of mobs and scrap the weapons. One glitches line in the sand is usually enough for about 1400 steel. 
---
Wood is everywhere on the floor, but there’s loads around the lumber mill near vault 76. Piles of it inside and endless logs and branches on the floor all around the area and across the road.
---
Thank you
---
Oh shit
---
Lifesaver :)
---
How are we going to do it? Jump off a cliff? I'll follow your lead on where to drop in
---
I forgot how it goes exactly but he says “I had a clever well crafted insult, but when I saw you I figured I’d save it for someone who will understand”
---
No sales here. Everyone is selling to the robots again.
---
Let’s go somewhere on the edge of map. I’ll build a camp. Let’s use private messages, ok?
---
wood and steel is literally everywhere..
---
copper you should tag for search.. its not as rare as you might think...
---
Oh yeah, foolish me. I went to a camp that had vending machines...what was I thinking?
---
Yeah, its odd. I had someone needing help on this who even though they copied my commands word for word and changed the correct things (i also made a bat for them and screen shared in to make sure it was correct) they could still not get the bat file to launch Fallout 76. Its just Windows Command Line being Windows Command Line lol. Sometimes its great, sometimes it isnt.
---
With heavy weapons and rifles you'll have a bit of trouble because some of the chems that help STR hurt PER and vice versa. Your best bet is probably getting addicted to stuff that impacts chr, end and int like alcohol, formula p, day tripper, med x and mentats.
---
lol @ me.. I just dump them all in containers when I get one as a reward and I never pick up a learned plan in the wild..
---
between the gifts, pails, and the duping of both, chances are that the majority of gifted plans.... a near worthless unless you get lucky selling cheap to a newer player.
---
Sad part is the Gauss shotgun sucks now 
---
Ever since you have to charge your vats shots I put it down
---
Motherfuckers avoid Rad rumble like a plague
---
🙌🏻🦾
---
No no, imagine if when u take the photo the thing has a camera roll like a phone, so you can edit it there! That would be so fun
---
What happened to it?!
---
SO much this. It drives me up the wall with my ally leaving a trail of open doors across the house, and randoms just running in, opening everything and anything they can find to look around and then fast travel out with everything open \**eye twitch*\*
---
Ya. Those doors being open all the damn time it gets pretty drafting inside. It's like they were born in a barn or something. 😁
---

---
Thanks :)
---
I have gone back to that location so many times after fighting the SBQ and the Colossus never spawns :(
---
Lol so strange. Well hopefully they will patch this game up soon anyway so these fixes won't even be necessary.
---
I've tried testing it as well, with no noticable effect.
---
You probably went to the right place instead of the "abandoned waste dumb"
---
I never understood these types of complaints. This and pvp of workshops. Nuking camps. Etc. It's all part of the mechanics.of the game. The game is also a post apocalyptic war game if we've forgotten that. There are ways of away from griefers but there needs to be some tension!
---
Considering it’ll be a couple years before the next one, I doubt it will be the same as this Fallout. Well have to wait and see when TES6 to see what they have done. From there it could be safe to determine how 5 will turn out.
---
ha, yeah i did the same, thought maybe the market had shifted suddenly so i lowered prices then realized its the new folks so prices are back to normal and I'll wait it out as things go back to normal soon enough.
---
Save up 500 atoms for a junk bot hes your best friend always giving you valuable junk when you visit camp. Make sure you lock him tho!
---
Yeah I’m kinda grinding atoms for that. I haven’t spent any money on the game except for the base price :)
---
I can’t think of any reason why this shouldn’t happen. Except maybe that it’s low on the priority list. But it should definitely happen.
---
You'll learn you drop junk plans... you don't need a 20th mole miner gauntlet plan and cant even sell it for 1 cap...
---
Cool
---
the weapon skins are w/e. The only weapon i actually use from that bunch is the minigun and I prefer the hot rod shark paint anyhow
---
I need some help with this too, are you guys still doing it? PSN: Arcloreon
---
I only pick up more valuable/sellable plans. I can sell a stimpack recipe for 100 caps, I can't sell a mole miner gauntlet
---
We actually just finished. But check back here! Someone else will definitely come by! I have to log off soon, but the other guy here will probably help you!
---
Anyone know how the outfit looks on a male character?
---
Before you could use vats and tap the trigger for full damage now  you have to charge up you vats shots for full damage
---
I tested it by how far I shot the ground close to my feet with or without perk equip but you're free to test that out too.
---
all the caps need to be raised &gt;&lt;  build, stash, scrip, everything lol
---
Possibly but I think they are also trying to hint at more in depth alien stuff. The V.A.T.S. Unknown and the weird monster thing near the Chinese bunker, and now the space theme and the encrypted broadcast.
---
One of the things I love most about this game is how different it is at different stages. That early grind is only like that for a very short time. The first time I went near Pleasant Valley, I thought I’d never go back there again! Now my camp is there. Where now you are desperate for food and caps, you’ll soon be looking to craft a great weapon, then maybe you’ll get a Legendary — and it won’t matter what it is!
---
One tip – don’t stash high level weapons for later. Sell them or scrap them. You’ll find plenty more when you are nearer that level.
---
Bugs out if you kill it too quick.
---
Had to start it with a rifle shot on my bloodied melee and wait for phase updates.
---
I can’t have collectrons at my camp for the same reason.
---
The heart is kinda “damage gated”, you can’t kill it in 3 hits, there are waves programmed for the event. I’m guessing you joined at the end, and then also encountered a bug if it didn’t end.
---
I joined with 28 minutes left.  It just took offense to me hitting it for 20k plus.
---
Yeah, the purpose of vending machines is to sell goods. Not to get people to go to a pathetic trap base. It would’ve have been as bad if I could have actually attacked the guy that did it.
---
The *Strange in Numbers* perk works only sometimes when in teams, as well (easy to notice with marsupial, and confirm with egg-head via int bump or lackthereof). Seems that it has a chance to work or stop working as people join or leave teams.
---
Hoping this is fixed soon like the others.
---
I literally have to give away every 1 star and crap 2 star that I get because I can't scrip them all and nobody will buy them.  I've dropped 10-20 at a time into the whitesprings station suitcase.  I don't need the caps, but still...
---
Yeah I’ve blasted it for 20k+ with my melee build but if you’ve done this event before it springs back just enough for the next wave. If it didn’t get thru those waves you hit some kinda bug. Surprise!
---
But that’s just the thing...I couldn’t attack him or do damage to him...so someone can trap and kill you at their base but you can’t damage them in anyway? Doesn’t seem very apocalyptic like nor fair.
---
Always be careful with any camp with the vendors not on the ground floor.
---
People don't realize hip fire accuracy accounts for most of the missing.  
---
The main bug is with close range shots since they should have the highest hit chance but tend to shoot in odd directions.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Best way to shoot gauss weapons is to charge them then VATS.
---
Yes that part does suck tbh. There are these little things that someone can do to mess with you but little you can do back to exact revenge. This reminds me of survival mode and how I miss it now .
---
I’m level 170 willing to help any way I can.
---
Haha you scammed you scammed! So what are you gonna do with that 200 dollars, oh that's right you spent it on the ultra deluxe edition for fallout 76!
---
They want you to buy fallout 1st. 
---
I sadly have 1st fir the sole reason I'm a completionist and have to have every outfit in my stash 
---
If you sign up for a ninth you can build up your junk and  still have the scrap box after. 
---
You can also create a mule 2nd character you transfer all of your extra legendaries to in private server.
---
I know it sucks paying to play but 1 month of it will give you 1600 atoms and the ability to save a few 100 lbs.
---
There used to be a SBQ fight like every few hours. Now I have noticed it's only up every few days for me. But I'm too lazy to do the silos so I guess I shouldn't complain lol
---
Follow road south from Abby's bunker and kill the wendigos that spawn. I usually get 4 wendigos for about 25 screws total each server hop
---
I'm the same as OP. Bought the game at launch to support the Devs but it didn't really feel like a game until Wastelanders arrived.
---
I'd play a week after every major content like Wild Appalachia, then drop it and play other games. Now I'm more consistent in my game time. So, yeah all of you who kept playing through, what I call the "Dead Year" kudos.
---
LOL, guess I'll have to use a nocturnal paddle ball next time.
---
surpise_mother_fucker.jpeg
---
fantastic notes!  i especially thought 2, 3, &amp; 4 warrant a closer look.  i was imagining too, that certain events/locations (also thematically intertwined) would work wonders.  (eg running a certain event x # of times during a week, or finding/collecting blank at x location(s) - centered around a theme rather than the random FT across the map missions that are standard now)  division 2 adds interesintg modifers to game play every few weeks that are optional (eg shielded enemies, headshot only) that could be in the form of new spceific goals added to existing events
---
juast as u mentiond, making flatwoods monster appear more often (or as a seasonal mob (eg xmas scorchd, treasure hunt molemen) and then hunting those creatures as part of ever-expanding list of (related and complimetary) tasks (the ex u gave about cosmos suit was great!) 
---
unfrotunately, it seems as though we'll be getting less and less "stuff" for this game.  i feel as tho, once they completed wastelanders (and made a "full" game), we're back to low priority.  the whole score was a way to monetize aleredy existing mechanisms (like incorporating the camera into all those possom scout quests way back when).  plus the new consoles coming out..idk, just not too optimistic.  if they can figure out quick, easy ways to shoe-string together stuff in complex webs of activity for players thatd be nice but i think we're a lot closer to wysiwyg just to make it work + scrambling to pay for itself after all the bad press &amp; poor corp desicion making.  i should just scleep this off, im slurring my typing!
---
  but yeah, great ideas and i hope tgey get incorporated into future seasons in some form or another!
---
I already have 1st and it still doesn’t make a difference, I’ve got a second character I think I’m going to start using just as a mule and I also spend all my FO1st atoms in camp bundles
---
I’ll sell you a bloodied pump action add me on psn. Ultimate-nugget1
---
Whenever I start a new character copper is an issue. One thing that’s really helped is Whitesprings. Hop until there is a camp or event there. Get inside and grab the many phones and magnifying glasses between the lobby and “spa” shops.
---
I put up neon letters right as you walk in saying shut the fucking door. And 9/10 it's closed when I get back.
---
Thanks man! 😊👍🏻
---
BGS in particular has no idea how to make something rewarding. Only gated grinds.
---
I’d do good vibe. If you ever needed anything placed in your camp, literally any of us would help
---
Yeah! I’m so glad someone got a picture of those before I moved camp! I must have ten photos of my decorated throne but didn’t save any of those.
---
They can be a real bugger to align compared to doing the same trick on a wall. Bring a sack of patience, especially for the bigger heads like the Deathclaw.
---
:Edit: A hasty reproduction and one of my new decorations.

So your telling me that because that person paid the 2k caps, they should start it on their own? Therefore tanking 3 pylons and still try and kill the assaultron?
---
Had level 3 get 1-shot.  It's not tanky at all.
---
Seriously there is no one-hitting this. It’s a scripted event.
---
And if you're lucky they wont be under the world XD
---
Large copper deposits in rock ledges along road into Solomon's Pond. In Excavator I can get 78 copper ore.
---
I’m gonna launch on the queen in about an hour
---
Started encrypted last week, member of my team was like "let me pee" and some asshole ran up to the terminal and started it.  Why the fuck would you start an event you didnt even pay for?  I should call out your IGN but I'm not gonna just know you're an asshole
---
Agreed.  With a well geared, high level character, you can really mow through the choice xp areas and events very efficiently and earn several 10k challenges in a 3-4 hour session.
---
Ah, good to see I'm not the only one of culture! I *always* share cannibal.
---
I'll help you. I need to do it too. PSN: zedis 
---
I don't have a mic, but we'll make it work.
---
I place her chair on the edge of a roof. Since she can't walk up to the front edge she will spawn in front of it (in mid air) and then fall. So now the only time she can play is when I spawn into the camp area. After that...silence, sweet sweet silence.
---
Census violence at the transformer location in the cranberry bog. All level 90 death claws. I completed it solo too. Only died once because I went to hot switch weapons and came up empty handed.
---
Times up, let's do this! Leeeeroy Jenkins!
---
That’s the only mod for it.  Happy smashing!
---
I'm a vegetarian irl but in-game I am a dedicated cannibal
---
Please don't make it like the door to the hell room in Westek that closes 3.2 seconds after you unlock it.
---
Yes siiiir!!! 😃😃😃👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
I'm a new player and I haven't really gotten into events. Most have a level recommendation and I believe the influx of new lower level players just aren't doing that stuff.
---
Hell I tried to do one event and then a high level joined, one shot everything, made a raider emote, and then left. I still don't know if I did it successfully or not...
---
Thanks my camp is on the golf club do this shouldn’t be terribly hard :)
---
If I could have my one wish with allies and Collectrons it would be to have a silent one. Just do your job, I don’t need to be constantly “entertained”.
---
I'll give that a try. Thanks for the tip!
---
Patch 20 broke a lot of stuff.
---
Don't expect it to ever be fixed.
---
"My insult for you was well-crafted, witty... a true masterwork. Then I saw you and decided to save it for someone who will understand."
---
Had me laughing out loud. I love this bot.
---
This.  And grab the souvenir lighthouses from the Lighthouse.  Also you can do Lode Baring.
---
I’ll have to remember that thanks :)
---
Agree, lots of low level players.  Few high levels and very few camps with lots on vending inventory.  Not enough high level players to do many events.  I have saved a couple of SBQ fights in the last three days and got there too late to save another (I'm Lvl356).  Had one of my own yesterday with only one other player.  We killed the SBQ with 6 seconds left.
---
Tried it solo right away and got destroyed.  Been gun shy since.
---
I'd like to try it again but there is never anyone there, and I ain't making the solo mistake again
---
Maybe I'm imagining things, I've noticed this being much worse over the past 2 days. I've even been having frequent issues with the fixer missing shots the same way.
---
Anyone on PC that wants to RP as gouhiles or some variety of cannibaL HMU.

---
Well you have 9 challenges now so if some do auto complete you still have more than before when the limit was 6 and one of those was for nuclear winter..I’d say it’s improved if only very slightly lol. It’s still shitty though I understand.
---
For Steel, do Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand.  Tag everything and use scrapper.  Profit 1K+ steel.  For wood, go to the Gillman Lumber Mill south of Vault 76.  Make sure to interact with the bots for extra wood.
---
Last couple days have been okay but not great, but it was dead the 2 weeks leading up.
---
I think everyone has everything.
---
You're welcome but if it doesn't work and I'm just probably overthinking it just let me know because I really like that perk card!
---
See, I've never really considered a bloodied build but if I did I would think one of the most important factors would be staying out of melee range. How do you make that work?
---
Nope same score more work
---
You may want to try r/fo76FilthyCasuals

Killed her in the Grove four times, two solo.  Not much in the line of loot from it.  Just a bullet sink although the Fear Attack is novel.
---
I relied on exc at low levels now in exc  I am only over approx 600 lbs and at a lowe r ac as well.
---
Could be they just saw the notification to continue the quest and ran with it thinking they were helping?  I dunno, I'm a level 150 but still making day 1 mistakes, pretty clueless but trying my best to help out.
---
A lot of people don't know about sharing cards.  Player base isn't the swiftest.

Some people are just way too impatient. I started encrypted the other day and was holding off for my two friends to join and allowing some time for others to show but then some random level 140ish just runs last me and activates the recall so I spent the caps for my friends to miss most of the event by the time they got through the loading screens
---
Finally someone with the guts to speak up.
---
I'll be honest here, I've done this intentionally one time. The extractors kept breaking and I was literally the only person repairing all 3 of them over and over. I was just so pissed over no one else helping I popped the last 2 supervisors myself.
---
People who don't help do the event properly are worse than those who 1 shot the legendaries. If you stand in one place with a thumb up your ass during the entire event except when the legendaries show up YOU are the asshole.
---
Free caps as teammates complete quests.

Its a shame the original run of morgantown high school themed items didnt get added in as well, but its nice to get the christmas and Halloween stuff
---
We're broke af dude. I almost hit 1k caps in 2 days off grinding and I felt like a God, then I visited someone's shop and realized I don't have anything...
---
I happen to be selling a Vampire Gatling Laser how much should they go for?
---
It just makes the time feel wasted.  Then it makes playing the game feel like a waste instead of fun.
---
I leveled my mule to 50, let's me script on 2 accounts... but I'm running into an issue when I have to turn in the script on the mule..

maybe if it showed a counter of participants and/or advised you not to start the event by yourself...

It works pretty amazing surprisingly 😅

If you're on console use the D-pad and click to the right while over the normal collectron and it should pop up

If you aren't using mods then you can just reinstall new. Everything is saved on server.

Correct. The only thing you may want to back up are your ini files if you are using any custom settings or mods, otherwise you're all good.

Is gotten tons better but I can't play it personally till the tiny lag is gone.  Whether its shooting or reloading or picking up anything or melee combat there is a tiny half second lag and it ruined the experience for me.  F04 doesn't have it so I stick to that feels more fluid
---
I’d like them to focus on fixing all the broken stuff before adding new stuff

Weird flex....

Good looking out, thanks!
---
Ill help you. Change the exp. for score points.  There u go. All fixed
---
Well no, because you’re supposed to be dead.
---
I wish Bethesda would give us an official answer on some of this stuff. An official FAQ or something
---
No problem!
---
Excellent...thanks for the answers!

Dude, 40K is easy for most bloodied unarmed melee builds.  I'm just love tapping her.  No flex intended.
---
I see you DV'ed my post and reply.  I'm assuming you are Todd Howard. Apologies for dogging your event.
---
Ok u need to get out a little more.
---
You've said it exactly how it is.
---
I don't bother with purvey unless I've maxed my scrip.
---
I drop every legendary that isn't "good enough" when I hit my maximum storage.
---
I sell 1 star for 10 caps, and 2 star for 25 caps.
---
Fyi: If you hardcore farm legendaries for ~3 hours you'll usually get one bloodied and one unyielding piece.
---
Which are the only things I keep.
---
Is the JE laser rifle pretty common?
---
Thanks I'll try that out tommorow
---
Yeah I either don't go after the legendaries or use my Rifle to bash them. Though there are a few times I've accidentally thrown grenades and accidents happen. But with uranium fever it confuses me more how with like 8+ people in there not one other person will repair the extractors

It is the same.  Gauss= VATS sucks,
---
I also run power armor, but with the handmade. Doesn't seem to break quickly, takes a while in fact. Not sure if that has anything to do with being in power armor or not, curious. Going to switch for the auto-repair perk anyways.
---
I joined one game and someone on my team built a stairway to heaven right away.  We all proceeded to jump off it and revive each other until we were all good.  Was glorious
---
70 days of a run, first 10 levels on day one from how the score works... basically FO1st gives you the.rum for free is what your saying. I'd say skip a daily and still get the SCORE but your suggestion is a tad OP
---
This started happening to me recently. Most of my guns wont do anything in VATS. Very frustrating.
---
Some of the vendors have that as a mod I think Phoenix bot might have it as well as the vendor in the burrows.not the plan but the mod to install.if I recall when I did the splitter if it's not explosive it kinda sucks.slows the rate if fire
---
I like playing fo76. Started it up again recently and etc.. I have to say though that I think they're using this log in everyday strategy, to get people to see their merchandise as much as possible.
---
Especially when they advertise atom shop stuff on the loading screens. They know people server hop for many reasons &amp; that's more time for the subliminal input. It's smart along with other things,but hopefully they'll change a lot of things up a bit.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqe3MRb3StY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqe3MRb3StY) you're welcome
---
It's not a great fix but you can remove shared perks in your perk card load out. Requires checking and what not but does help when a bad card is being shared
---
So to break it down for you, it's not just any creature as people are telling you.  All over the map there are locations where random things happen.  The cranberry glade parking lot is a perfect example of such a location.  Within the pool of let's say fifty possible random encounters the game will put in these locations each time you visit, there are tamable creatures.  You will know they are tamable because they will be in one of these random locations, and be all by themselves, and they won't be aggressive towards you, as in their health bar will be white not red.  If all of these things are true for a random encounter you come across, you'll be able to walk right up to the creature and if you have animal friend equipped, you see a prompt that says "tame".  But remember... These tamable creatures are pretty rare now and even if you find one there's at max an 80% chance you'll be able to tame them.
---
If you want to see random encounters for yourself, the easiest in my option is to fast travel to the cranberry glade and head to the very nearby parking lot that has the white car.  You'll see something although it may just be a dead body.  Then server hop.  You'll see something different.  Server hop again and something different again.  This is what people often do until they find a tamable creature.
---
Trolls will troll. At least I can sleep tonight knowing there are people like you, out there making people like me look good ;-)
---
I bought mine, a 3 star "magic" weapon for about 1400 caps.
---
1. Tell people your trying to do the challenge, and ask nicely if they would die for you. Has worked for me. People in this community are a lot nicer than youd think.
---
2. Creatures tend to spawn a lot more the closer you are to the fire, and even more if the fire moving. I got 7 kills in 1 match by staying close to the fire.
---
I think when they do that its because they want to make room for one of their friends.
---
Thanks I don’t have serendipity I’ll try that
---
thank you so much man this helps a TON
---
Leader of the pack, it’s an event and not a public one. It a Spawns in the Forest and has 3 one star lengendary level 10 wolves. Easiest way to get that challenge done.
---
Because people are idiots and see "Bonus XP" and dont see right next to it where it says "for completing events". They think its a general XP boost for everything you do.
---
Line in the sand gives me 30-40k xp per run (with glitched spawn but should be similar even without it). Add lunchboxes (which I'm saving for the double xp weekend) and double xp your looking at 90-120k xp
---
Same thing I'm thinking. I wish each expansion added a tougher end boss fight that relegates the previous end boss to a lesser fight, so the SBQ isn't always the  end goal, just as the dragons  in vanilla WoW eventually got supplanted by Kil'jaeden, then by Arthas and so on.
---
Maybe Fractured Steel will give us a new end boss (here's hoping).
---
Pay to win is defined as being able to purchase in game items that give you a clear advantage over those who don't have them, there is not a single item out of the 100 rewards that give any significant advantage whatsoever lol
---
Nice! She was my favorite ally for a long time bc she was the only one not constantly giving me lame quests... But had to ditch her bc the damn guitar got really annoying after a while!
---
At low levels, just worry about scopes and stocks, and maybe receivers.
---
At high levels it takes my weapons from 500-1000 kinda thing. Pretty big deal. I also have hundreds of materials and 30+ repair kits, so I guess I’m not worried about it.
---
The more damage you do, the less ammo you use up
---
I already get about 571 with backpack capacity mod, mutations, uny and foods, don't need much more than that do i
---
It's one of those places Nuked for flux farmers. The glowing ones can one shot Steelheart so you have to watch his back pretty good. Also lots of XP for lvl 68 glowing ones!
---
No problem and good luck.  I've spent way too much time messing around with creature taming so feel free to ask questions.  Just be ready for frustration because the chance of the random encounter being a tamable creature is so much lower than it used to be.  I've spent hours just server hoping trying to replace a mega sloth I had previously tamed but that somehow randomly disappeared on me.
---
Check the defense stats and compare them to the 3 different combat armours, I don't know of any other way (though I've only been playing a few months, hopefully someone else has some wisdom), I generally just use the wiki to find the stats and figure it out from there.
---
Yes, I did it this morning with the tent placement thingy and it was utter carnage. I then cleaned up the mess and came away with almost 1k steel. You're right, that's almost an entire level there.
---
They've already got a setting/code for it somewhere. The secret door into the Nukashine speakeasy closes automatically (and after a reasonable time-frame, too).
---
so after i tame something i fast travel back to my base and wait, but how do I know if the creature dies on the way to my base?
---
No way— this is crazy awesome! You can get hits on nearly everything if you use explosives.
---
Should be, and I’m on Xbox and the outfit is not blurry for me. However this can happen if you swap outfits quickly.
---
What platform are you on? Also timezone. I'm part of a group that regularly runs 3 silos when logging on.
---
Or both...
---
I try lol
---
Fasnacht steins count as decorations, and they're really tiny so you can just plop them down anywhere and be done with it.
---
Thanks I’ll try that too
---
Sweeeet.
---
Right lol
---
Starched Genes
---
If it's going to work like ESO One Tamriel, then yes. There is lack of end game content in FO76 anyways, that's why everyone is running bloodied builds with 1 HP one shotting everything for lack of any real challenge, while in ESO you had veteran content where you can be one shot if you didn't have a certain HP threshold and a decent healer in group.
---
I personally prefer SS
---
Irony is a motherfucker at times lol...
---
Translation: players have forgotten that there is an entire world of other games, as well as a thing called "the world".  Your "investment" into FO76 is a sunk cost.  Get over it, and move on.
---
I specifically use a TS tesla to tag everything and let everyone else clean up to get the xp. I rarely dont get all the enemies tagged in a wave. It's great
---
So scattered is a beam split right?
---
FSS will give you more dps overall, as power attacks are limited by your AP.
---
We are all stuck with that after following that little mystery before Wastelanders. Hopefully there’s some reward later, like those annoying Overseer logs eventually gave us.
---
I thought they didn't even have dongs?  Wasn't that the whole point of why the Master's plan failed?
---
That is the max cap for it. Sadly
---
sadly I've had the outfit on for an hour or so now and there is no change.
---
I hate to say it but you can just sell or drop all the extra legendaries
---
Ugh, dammit. I even went out of my way to finish the notes on the board hoping it'd be all complete. Oh well, here's to hoping then! Thanks.
---
This is where you learn to economize! Scrip, scrap and sell.
---
Have you changed, then left the server and when you re join, put pipers outfit on?
---
Yep. Tried it all. Idk what's happening.
---
Dense armor mods help
---
Where did you buy the membership and what client are you playing through? I haven't had an issue with first, not sure if your problem is common or not but the only time I've seen similar mentioned is when someone has purchased via [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) and is playing on steam or vice versa.
---
I had her at my camp for longer than I should have. I assumed that since she was so annoying that there must be some hidden benefit to her.  I sure didn’t fine one. Beckett seems to be the chillest. The space gal just walks around talking about how much she loves me. Haven’t tried out the old man with dad jokes yet but I don’t see that going well either.
---
You can only stash 800 max in stash box. You can get a backpack by doing boy scouts missions. Or carry a lot more using the excavator power armor it's the only power armor that in creases ur Carry weight.
---
bethesda should just  make the enemies scale to participants involved. scaling a basic mmorpg tenant. don't let bethesdas poor game design turn you against your fellow players. ultimately, they want to kill and have fun. im an avid big weapons user, and it can be a little tough to throttle down sometimes (i carry a non-perk supported 1lb. lever action just for such purposes). im not going to lie, the barrels are spinning, im getting my bloodlust buff pumping, i can get a little rampagey. betheda needs to offer up more resilient gatling fodder...
---
It sounds like someone was trying to dup it and he just came along and bought it. Good get all the same.
---
I think I'll do that if there are other players there. It was just me this morning so I used a JE laser that melted everything (including me a couple of times).
---
Same here
---
That's what I think is funny they do it to everyone else but if someone does it to them they get butt hurt 
---
I'm 170 bloodied cammando and I was do ur event with a combat shotgun I loot off a corpse and im waving some low levs or to get a tag and lev 52 comes in (I'm assuming he just found his first bloodied weapon) and just one shouted all 3 legs.  To me it's not a big deal but the lower lev guys could've used that gear, so I drop the legs I had on me for the lowers and was slightly pety and just fallowed the guy everywhere he went one shooting everything in his vicinity till he left the server
---
The ammo converter is such a pain i nthe ass to use. Why can't i fucking grind all my ammo of a specific type down ALL AT ONCE..or at least in bigger intervals. Breaking down 500 9mm rounds, TEN OR TWENTY AT A TIME IS MISERABLE.
---
Hey, do you have a jetpack for silos? There is a super simple way to speed run them.
---
I would like thw following for this:
---
 • Water Floor tiles: Its a normal floor tile but with water instead of a floor. That or a pool we could place. Then we can add crops that only grow on water on them, floating in the water.
---
• Planter Display Case: Works exactly like a display case, but you can place 1 crop of your choice on it. Mainly for people that dont want to have a big farm, but still want to have a consumable to grind on their camp.
---
Darn, I’d try to contact someone about it then
---
It's supposed to be out next patch, so like a month or so?  That's the plan, anyways
---
I am playing through Bethesda launcher, and i bought it via the page it brings you to when you click on the FO1st membership thingy via the game, which is bethesda.net.
---
No
---
Jetpack hands down. Gauss minigun sort of? Now I have to spend my scrip on modules instead of rolling legendary weapons in the hopes to get a god roll someone might actually want. Get a few of those and I'll be able to trade for a legacy so I can actually see what all the fuss is about lol pretty much given up. I don't even want one permanent I just want to try one someday!
---
Was a nice XP run.
---
Yeah, my issue is if it's just me it seems to spawn so few enemies I can use my normal weapons. When the event comes up I end up messaging a lot of people "easy xp event - more people, more xp. Please join" and get a couple extra people before starting it
---
I played alone the entire game, it felt just like Fallout 4. As my level got higher and I got more powerful, I started getting more comfortable joining teams and doing events and all that stuff.   It became even more fun once I got to that point
---
fo1st gives you unlimited scrap storage, not stash storage. fo1st members still get 800# limit like everyone else. the majority of my stash IS legendary weapons to turn in. it got to a point to where anything above 2 stars got sold for caps, and the lower scrip returns allowed me get more crap outta my stash. &lt;sigh&gt; we had fo4... what happened?
---
I didn’t think you could trade the new weapons? 🤔
---
If somebody joins my group. You're getting rad sponge, that's just how it is
---
Thanks for the feed back
---
I like the old guy.
---
I just parked him next to my communal Fire pit and he rarely moves
---
Lesson learned the hard way :) For repairing your camp, just move it slightly and your existing camp will be possible to be put again (it saves it as a complete structure when you move it). 
---
Just be aware that the saved camp build will sometimes complain it can't be used (floating items error), just keep trying and it should eventually deploy again.
---
And if that fails, break it apart and use the blueprint - you won't use any materials either.
---
At worst, you'll need to rebuild it again from the stored pieces.
---
It generally will not die if you fast travel back.  If you follow it then you have to defend it the whole way so don't do that.  They can take a long time to reach camp and I think it depends on how far away your camp is from where you found the creature.  One of mine took nearly an hour, but a different one only took twenty minutes.  Come to think of it, I did have one creature that never did make it.
---

would that be why when I played nobody seemed interested in getting the ore? the event failed because nobody except me was getting the ore and depositing it.
---
Farming Nuked whiteaprings. Group of 3 building group and using lunchboxes. We get 10k exp almost every pull of enemies. Crazy fast farming.
---
Nice I just put beam focus on there and it stopped killing in one hit with serendipity thanks so much🤓
---
uhh, for more help? to do some kind of community event? also to get more mobs? Of course, if you are Chad Wastelande, by all means, solo it.
---
This. There's too many grinds in this game that are limited by daily resets. Least they could do is make Scrip infinite while retaining the gold bullion and cap daily limits
---
No but you can get a few god roll weapons you can trade by using script at the purveyor. But nobody will trade anything but like b2525 fixers or handmades for a legacy.
---
Same. All I use is gause rifle and I've only recently got really good at not using vats because of this...
---
Yeah, I got a Stalker's lead pipe from it, but the fight was fun.
---
it's possible but not easy unless you are well-endowed
---
I like this idea a lot as it makes fo1st a little sweeter and there’s no real “leg-up” besides the members happening to get the items sooner than everyone else. I also dislike how so many people are here saying they don’t like it because it’s paying for tiers but literally in a little bit we will be able to spend 150 atoms to buy tiers so I don’t understand how that’s any different
---
wouldn't you end up in the blast radius of the nuke too? or can you start encryptid and run out of the area?
---
It was like that in FO4 also.  It's just not good quality sadly.
---
Todd comes to your home and deletes your character.
---
Edit: i don't know the answer But I would guess that you can easily get it and spend it later. :)
---
No, you still get it, just can't use it yet.
---
Get a Tesla Rifle.  Use it to tag everything and let others get the drops too.  It likely won't do enough to 1 shot anything at UF, but is super fun/useful/efficient on the west side of the map.  Shoot the ground, everything around dies.  Save the big guns for the tougher enemies.
---
again bro ty, youve helped Tremendously. But even if it takes weeks to get I eventually want an albino deathclaw. Do you know even if the percentage is Extremely Small, if it still spawns there?
---
Awesome.
---
I saw a bloodied faster swing speed +1 strength bear arm yesterday for 18k caps so I jumped on it (leaving me broke...but then someone bought my bloody FFR FR radium rifle I had on sale for 15k caps so it worked out).
---
Now I’m looking at my bloody shotgun build and mentally ticking off what perks to get to make it viable for unarmed too.
---
(I’m also aware the bear arm was probably duped in hindsight)
---
No worries, I’ll use emergency protocols one day when I try for a bloodied build, it’s a good one for low health scenarios
---
Gotcha. I don’t think gauss explosives are too expensive and they’re legacy
---
Especially when three stars scrip for 40. Three of those and two two star legendaries per day? Simply not enough.
---
Hear, hear!
---
When I played through the story solo I barely even saw any other players. The map is just that large and spread out, and there aren’t very many players per server. 
---
Also there doesn’t seem to be much griefing in 76. I’ve personally never even experienced it myself.
---
Great idea. Do you message over discord or within F76 social?
---
Its been pretty consistent at my shop. But I don't sell for profit - more convenience.
---
Okay that’s good to know
---
Yep that one will help as well. Only thing is, Beam Splitter makes that weapon OP. It won't have as much bang for buck with Beam Focuser.
---
I've actually given some advice regarding storage space earlier today so I'll just copy and paste(a few edits):
---
1. Scrap your junk. Almost all junk weighs less when scrapped.
---
2. Scrap most(if not all) weapons and armor you're not using. You'll outlevel most of it soon enough. Even for higher level gear, even if there's no guarantee that you'll come across the exact same copy of something, you'll get plenty of gear that you can use.
---
5. Don't keep too much steel and wood. They're easy to come by so bulk some of it up and sell it off.
---
6. You most likely won't use ceramic, concrete, glass, or bone very much so bulk and sell these off too.(if you do happen to need them, just stop by whitesprings)
---
7. Bulk up and sell other materials you don't really use. Keep at least a small stock of rarer materials just in case you do need them but don't absolutely hoard them.
---
8. Unless you're aiming to go for some sort of explosives build, get rid of most(if not all) your grenades, mines, mini-nukes, missiles, and grenade rounds. Plus, said explosives are pretty useless right now.
---
9. Unless you're planning on using power armor or gatling lasers, get rid of most(if not all) your fusion cores. They way a bunch of it stacks up quickly, just like explosives.
---
10. Unless you plan on using gatling plasma, get rid of your plasma cores. They don't weight as much as fusions but it does add up.
---
11. Getting perks that reduce carry weight of items can be useful if you're still having problems.
---
12. Don't go holding onto a bunch of plans that you already know. At your level, if you already know it and you have another, chances are they probably aren't worth anything anyway.
---
13. Excavator power armor(I believe level 25 is the lowest), wearing a full set gives 100 carry weight. Putting a shock absorbers mod on each leg will give you a total of another 100 carry weight. If you don't want to use power armor, unyielding gear can give you plenty of strength which means more carry weight.
---
14. And simply carry weight reduction perks.
---
Be cool to try one. I have a furious ffr ultracite Gatling Lazer that I love. I want to try one that has the explosive affect sometime though. The new gauss guns can have the explosive effect?
---

Both of my characters have the same build as yours and have addictions to
---
Mentats
---
Alcohol
---
Day Tripper
---
Daddy-O
---
Psycho
---
Why Psycho? Because it allows me to use Psychobuff/Psychotats (the best chem imo) as much as I want without needing Chem Resistant.
---
Plans for 50 caps each.  But most are just junk and won’t sell.
---
Except Chem plans (100 caps), serum plans (should you have mistakenly bought two...it happens), special event plans (fixer, bear arm, stim diffuser, etc).
---
Charged weapons have a major problem. My shotgun hits all the time but my guess is just a heavy sniper rifle. I can circle a camp/area/base in sneak and clear nearly everything out if I can get a line of sight otherwise I have to use the shotgun to clean everything up or waste a ton of ammo/stimpaks and possibly radaway and cures. Because of all the hits I take while reloading.

This is such a good idea!

I'd settle for a couple high level areas and dailies in those areas.  Just give me something that requires some effort again.

Thanks for the kind words! I'm gonna be honest here, I wish Bethesda would drop us something else beyond the Mountain Scout uniform for our early contributions [though I love and wear that outfit]. I guess for me, I went in joking that it was clearly a pre-paid beta-- but not really joking. That mentality, and a crowd of friends helped me enjoy it in the early days.

I remember always going through it and realizing there was crap in there that shouldn't have been (dirty water, food - spoiled meat-  ores that had not been smelted, etc) also whatever perks that you have loaded for your character that changes waits does not work for the stash box, so if you have something that reduces weights of chems or ammo best to keep them on your body and use the box for other things. 
---
You will figure out your routine and before you know it you will have the right perks and carry almost all of your ammo and other things (some fun weight perks make it so it's best to have a multiple guns on your body versus box) . So for now look for things that done need to be in there, cloth and wood adds up fast so keep that at bay. Drop some items into paper bag see what space it frees up and then go from there
---
I completely agree, I sell all my plans for 2 or 5 caps each, but still they just don’t sell
---
Yes!
---
And to the level 20 player who barges in and immediately starts the event like I, the dumbass level 223, is unaware of how to start the event and that's why I'm just standing there... please stop.
---
Please, please stop.
---
Been that way forever, just not a high priority for them.
---
Damn, guess my eyes are trying to justify my spending habits, hah.
---
I ignore the daily challenges and just play the game.
---
I guess I’m doing it wrong because I won’t get that level 100 score...but I’m actually enjoying playing so whatever
---
Seeing these prices makes me so grateful for a player I came across who sold the plan for 500 caps. It was a steal.
---
Probably not a good idea to tell people how to exploit a company’s profits.

This is something you can and should help with
---
The brotherhood broadcast is a different broadcast and the flatwoods monster has been in game since the start. Im talking about something more like an invasion event or something.
---
I usually do that with Mr. Pebbles. You can put 5 of his plush directly onto the part of the workshop you use to claim it. There's no way the next person can miss them haha.
---
The newer folks do have something we older folk can thank them for, too - joining us, and breathing some fresh air into the grinds, and making new friends along the way.
---
Yep, then I'd be getting up supports ass, I think they're expecting you to wait that 72 hours before lodging another ticket, I don't understand why they can't just send you a customised email stating that instead of using a copy/paste job though.
---
Well done man!!! 😃
---
Sadly true, dupers still screwing the game's economy..... 😓
---
what if the scrip accumulation per day had either a way higher cap or one that works more similar to caps where it stops just at a higher certain point but there is a spend limit per day? if they really want to enforce a limit?
---
Ok I did this on accident today without realizing it. I got a new shotgun and wanted to try it out and didn’t expect it. I’m sorry everyone I didn’t mean to.
---
I would like to see what you mean with the monster at the chinese bunker or w/e ( i cant see the original post as i reply)
---
Did it yesterday as well, 1* Instigating Board... And this was right after a SBQ fight that yielded a 1*Zealot's Lead Pipe. Hundreds of rounds of expensive Ultracite ammo, all for 10 scrip. Yay. Got a nice photo out of it though.
---
It’s cursed. I’m not kidding. Get rid of it
---
Same here...I had been through this cycle for weeks.
---
Clean fuzzy was an AS item.
---
Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Tenderizer, Covert Operative, Mister Sandman. Other than that it comes down to Adrenal Reaction mutation and food buffs.
---
I'm interested.
---
"Need to fight, need to SMASH"
---
If anyone is on pc and wants to fight another, I just found one. Ign lateraliss
---
This also helped thanks again
---
What is the primary perk. I’d keep both but, for example if one is bloodied and one is instigating it makes a difference
---
Are you on pc? I just found another
---
Get outta here! I thought Zathura was just a movie. Or was that movie so long ago that people grew up playing a game based on the movie. Next you'll tell me Jumanji was a real board game before the movie.
---
I noticed that but it’s easier to use
---
Both bloodied, both +1 agility
---
Since the game launched on Game Pass I have been making guns and armor for different players as they level up suited to their level. Most o give to them directly, otherwise I load up the trunk and tool box at overseers camp along with non perishable food and water. Realized tonight as I was going to make someone a set if PA that I ran out of screws.... oops. Off on an adventure for an hour snatched up some. But now will be spending most of this week farming for more amidst SCORE goals. Such a dummy! Sometimes kindness hurts 😂
---
Thanks I put that on as well
---
I have had this happen on Free Range as well a few times, takes me about a full clip of a mini gun to achieve this on a level 80 Sheepsquatch ,but some dudes 1 or 2 shots. How is the game a challenge or fun when you have such an Uber Build?
---
Gunna be a good FIGHT!
---
Yes exactly. If you want someone to understand better, you should reply with a customized message instead of the same template. I guess the first reply is from a bot catching the phrase "atom" and then just assuming this issue is all about atoms. Horrible job from the customer service :( Using bots is totally useless.
---
I really do not enjoy the PVP in the main world (NW is... okay) but there's a subset of players that get their giggles out of just stealing workshops. 
---
I only take workshops to farm resources, they're already a pain without PVP -- my issue with PVP isn't just that it's not fun and the rules of engagement are dumb-- and it's basically a sunk cost for everyone involved. 
---
Anyway, long story short, when people do steal workshops from me on public servers, I never fight back, again, a sunk cost. But I have a few dozen nuclear keycards, so I usually just respond by nuking their camps. ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯
---
Thanks for the help! :)
---
I’d say both really. Both are amazing. One is geared towards sneak, one is geared towards large groups.
---
One is good for ghouls, one is good for those big green cunts
---
Hindsight is a beautiful thing, but not all new players realise you can do this
---
I remember 6 months ago the vendors were popping off !! It was super fun travelling around checking out stock. Now on Xbox it’s like a wasteland lol. The new player base is good though overall.
---
Yea I don’t go for the ore because that missing exp 
---
I get 134 exp per kill and That every 2-5 sec
---
No worries, I wouldn't get your hopes up though, they only seem to cherry pick posts that get quite a lot of attention and ignore the ones that don't to make it look like they actually do something
---
I have actually accidentally one shot a legendary mole miner in Uranium Fever a whole ONCE and I thought it was funny. Someone dropped the Follow Me, and I went and quickly VATS'd just so I could pop my one shot and leave. I had a Critical loaded up and forgot about it, ending up making 75% into 0%.
---
I ended up dropping all my drops from the rest of the event at the entrance and then returning to my camp to think about my actions.
---
On what system is the duping happening??? All of them ?
---
No i don't think so, you could find rare ones to sell or give to a friend.
---
If you collect them all you could rotate buffs when you need them like extra meat or better sneak when you want them.
---
So if hypothetically Bloodied gets nerfed and I have to spend an entire ~6 level points moving perks that I already have back to a sneak rifle build and end up doing the same damage anyway, what then? Do we nerf sneak? Nerf instigating? And then what happens when another build becomes popular? Nerf that too? Why not, instead of actively hurting the community, you help it out by instead *buffing* other builds? Make mutant’s gear more viable. Make nocturnal and assassins useful.

When its explosive and has the beam splitter mod, the Gatling Plasma has multiple projectiles (5 i think?) that each deal full damage, whereas that flamer only has one.
---
the GP is more like a fully automatic explosive shotgun, more than a heavy gun.

They are great sepetately but unfortunately with limited storage, I'll have to sell one soon.

Its a shame because its a pretty enjoyable event imo.

Funny that i have been playing this game since launch and have not failed at that event once. You just need to go to the buildings and find the ones that are stuck.
---
Dr. Zorbo looks like Dementor from Jingle All the Way.
---
Yeah. If anything they can keep the limit to 150 but afterwards maybe per item you get 1 atom. Or have some other thing you can get. Something. ANYTHING. I constantly drop weapons and armor because of the weight limit. It's boring. For extra caps and scrip let us collect points to exchange for something. It's aggravating and makes the game suck.
---
I'll give you one of each.
---
Wasn't it also a Jumanji ripoff movie?
---
Thanks! Whats your gt?
---
Instruments in this game are all around disappointing, one thing I wished they did in introduce a system similar to LOTRO where you could actually used keyboard keys to play instruments. When we have guild meetings, we used to afterwards have people playing music.
---
All these limits are BS and put in place to limit progression. Really hope that the cap either gets removed or as u/Chiiirpy said to raise the limits with the player level.

The Deep monster, some people call it the baby interloper.

I hope they extend on the companions but if they don't, the astronaut is probably going to get replaced very quickly. Even I am growing bored of her and I actually liked her story at the start.
---
They do not appreciate it. They still have a lot of work to do because their focus is money. Not customers. That said, welcome back friend. People like you running around help to make up for Bethesda's incompetence and greed. :)

Sometimes I 1-shot, I try not to. But it happens.

What I'm sick of is people stealing my loot bag after Scorched Earth because I died to a Mirelurk Queen.

I didn’t realize Xbox pass came out until the end of today when I joined a team with all level 5 ppl aside from me being the only 50+ player. I felt like such a mom following them around, helping them with their quests, and giving them my lowest weapons/armor lol I basically ended up giving them free stuff from my vendors that hasn’t sold in a while.
---
The real question is how did duchess know what crane had in his pockets?
---
thx man!
---
The only thing that upsets me about waiting is that you get these lvl 200+ there and I at lvl 89 can not get a shot on it to save my life, because I am lagging out by all the people, lazer weapons fire and because for some reason the real high lvl mobs lag me out as well. I bought a brand new gaming PC when I got 76 and the best internet, but still lags so much. So I never got a shot off.
---
I'm always amazed at the dailies that have the exact same conversation every single time. Ward and others say the exact same thing every single time. You'd thing they would of spent another 2 minutes getting the voice actors to say a few other lines. But why would they. They'd have to pay them another 5 cents to stay a little longer to do it.
---
That happens to me more than I'd like to admit
---
I'm usually with you on this. But considering the xp grind, I now care more for farming high level mobs than acing the event.
---
Humans. So *small.* So *weak!*
---
Are you using a 72 or 144hz monitor? The game is capped at 60fps, but if your refresh rate is not a multiple of 60 then it will halve/quarter it until its below 60 and still inline with your refresh rate. You need to edit a line in the ini to remove the fps cap, though it can cause issues, especially with movement indoors. I don't remember the line to edit but I'm sure someone will be able to tell you.
---
I was gunna say for Xbox, I had to log in on my Xbox profile and unroll from the subscription manually, not sure what that would like for PS4 though.

Everytime I take hemlock, its hoards of legendary anglers. Fml
---
Yup. I'm always happy when there's only one or two people and they are being asses one shotting everything. I keep a junky shotgun for events like that. But when people one shot, I spam honey, pull out my lever action and do my best to hear them start screaming at me for doing exactly what they were doing. Best feeling in the world.
---
It's technically a sequel, both are based off Chris Van Allsburg books. The kids in Jumanji are the neighbors of the kids in Zathura.
---
72hz samsung curved monitor 36 is half of 72 that makes sense.
---
Gun Smith is broken? I haven't noticed my guns condition go down any faster then it use too. How is White Knight broken? Is it the less repair cost or condition?
---
Fuckit buy it thats awsome ive been wanting that in the game for a while now
---
If you're on PS4 I took a picture and it's now a loading screen.
---
Raising caps won't do much. Prices will just go with it. Those bloodied weapons that people say are "30k+" will become "60k+". The only people who will get hurt in a cap raise are newer players as they wont be able to afford anything even worse now. 
---
This game's economy just isn't....there. Once you buy a majority of the plans, you start stock piling currency fast. 
---
What they need to do is figure out a way to make legendary items useful beyond scriping and occasionally using. I mean lets be honest. This game's balance sucks and like 75% of the legendary affix are undesirable/bad. Those that are good are only being traded for other weapons that are good. So the economy is VERY niche. 
---
Personally...I think they should make it so you can craft either ultralicte ammo OR ammo of the same level/quality (damage wise) with a resource that can be gained from scrapping legendary items. Not the train scrapper/rusty pick. I mean taking the item to a regular crafting station, scrapping it, and then getting a special resource from that. You can then use that resource with lets say lead to make ammo of different qualities. 
---
Similar with other usable items like stimpacks. Introduce a very good stimpack or some other consumable that uses materials from legendary item scrapping. 
---
I have over 400 hours in this game and a majority of the "carrots" in this game are utterly useless. Going furious/ instigating/junkie/mutant/two shot are still good. You wont be wipping the floor with OP bloodied, but you can do all the content with no trouble.
---
If you haven't used it in a week. Get rid of it.
---
As a bloodied/rad build this one hits hard
---
Got a bit of our garden here in NoVA but we recovered. Wife has been making and canning preserves.
---
This is the 800th time I've seen this comment and the 800th time it gets an upvote. This problem is as bad as non legendaries who you one shot but their heath goes to zero so you shoot again. Then it goes to 100% and you need to shoot again for them to die. It's Bethesda not caring because they don't care about customers. All they want is money so that is their focus. They have no pride and are monumentally incompetent. It's sad but I don't think any of us will ever see the day when that changes.
---
Agree. Those bosses also need to be designed well. Queen is an absolute HORRIBLE fight.  There's so many issues with that encounter. The biggest one to me is the "flying" phase where she takes less damage. Hardly anyone shoots at her while in the air. Nobody wants to waste ammo. The amount of queens I've done where it is 1-3 people shooting at her with another 10-12 just sitting there waiting for her to land is too many. There's even been a few encounters where literally noone is shooting at her or doing anything. They're just standing there on top of bunker.
---
Queen should've incorporated the entire storyline up to that moment.
---
1. The players should have access to the Free State lures/trappers to make her land more reliably instead of just trying to shoot her wings and hoping she lands.
---
2. The early warning detection system should have been usable to automatically mark targets
---
3. The sonic emitter/BoS technology should have been used to make it so she some how takes more damage
---
All of these sub objectives need to be defended from scorch waves to make them useful against the queen. The fight would be 10x more fun than just clawing my eyes out ontop of bunker over and over again.

Was your base at the very center of the nuke? Or just somewhere in the circle? Because if it's the latter, then it was just unlucky on your part that you happened to live where someone wanted to nuke. If the former, then yeah you got nuked, it happens.

Is this game that horribly optimized that you can't run in it in 1080p with a 970?

Same on ps4. I'm terribly underpricing 3 stars just to get them out of my stash but nothing.

I don't remember it being so bad in FO4 but maybe I'm misremembering.
---
It sticks out so much that my friend even asked what was going on.
---
if i want to complete this battle pass as soon as possible, then yes, it is forcing me to do it.  what's nonsensical is making me play a PVP mode in a game franchise that functions miserably in a PVP form.

Throw it into the fires of Mount Blair.

Yeah, those floater granades were a bit disappointment for me, with long fuse, small AOE and non-existant dmg ... :)

When Sundew grove gets nuked from a prime nuke the colossus has a low chance to spawn. About 1 in 15 chance.

Oh wow! ok then I take that back then.
---
All good. Glad it worked for ya.
---
Awesome. That’s what I’ve been spending points on. Thanks
---
I was disappointed with the game when it first came out so I played for about a month then quit. I came back right before Wastelanders and was so amazed by everything they added and fixed (bigger stash, vendors, more building stuff, NPCs) and now with seasons I’m actually interacting with other players and doing events with my team. Plus, I love building my camp and showing it off. 
---
They’ve come a LONG way, and I applaud them for that.
---
The issue is that it’s blurry correct?
---
If everybody gained 3 atoms once a day because of a bug Bethesda would shut down the servers for 3 hours around that time just to be safe. But if we lose something that will force us to spend atoms? Keep it running! they scream as they do nothing to fix it.
---
If I remember correctly, some assholes claim they "don't have time" to share because they are too busy playing this plus another 3072 games, which they are the lead of ALL groups/guilds/alliances in.
---
Rifleman - press fire shoot once, no matter how long you hold it  
---
Commando - press fire shoot auto  
---
Thats the difference.
---
Save your caps. 10k or under at player vendors. I didnt get my fixer plan until the 4th time of doing the event.
---
Yeah the damage is so small. Even with demo expect maxed out. The aoe I'm thinking is if you toss it and an enemy walks over that area  after the explosion they get hurt. Like counter strike and other games. 
---
Would really help low levels get tags on things.
---
No prob
---
Yeap. I hope they know that. I'm trying to be optimistic and I think this is what happened.
---
1. They release this gaming hoping to to be like this weird mixture of Rust with PvE
---
2. Majority of the population does not care about PvP at all. 
---
3. Population is trying to play this game like a MMORPG
---
So now they're developing "frameworks" for the game. As in they're developing the structures that will enable more content in the future. Chances are for a majority of this year well see frameworks be put into the game. Daily Ops, Off Map Ops (not sure if these will be what daily ops are), SCORE seasons, temporary events/reoccurring temporary events, etc. 
---
Next year then well hopefully see them start adding to these things.
---
That's why i dont bother with ore anymore, why should i waste radaways and stims gathering ore, while others killings mobs for exp and legendarys
---
i prefer high framerates to high res. but yeah it's a clunker. also i was playing on a 4k monitor so had to run it in borderless window. fullscreen is significantly better performance. this video from Angry Turtle might help you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byE4qyx8kwA

Quest to kill the first wendjgo Colossus
---
Jetpack for sure!!
---
I've placed their chair right up against the wall so they can't play anymore. 
---
It means they also don't walk around or use crafting benches etc, but that song on repeat drove me insane!!!
---
Not rly, not that easy to tag mobs with 8 ppl, and nobody gathering ore, all came for exp
---
my friends and i have been doing that, setting up at the overseers camp for a few hours, each of us providing a different type of help, from food and water to armor to weapons to healing items to underarmor and outfits. it's been super fun. the noobs seem prone to running away from me when I'm by myself trying to give away stuff, but a crowd of do gooders shouting at them from the road to come take our stuff somehow earns their trust lol.
---
That'd be great if they implemented a feature to mute instruments' music but I guess it won't happen... I'm glad we got mute instruments/allies mod on PC though
---
I just sell them at their face value of how much it cost when placing it on the vendor.
---
That and its also confusing/hard. Collecting the resources, defending the AI, etc. Most people, even when I do PP, just sit on a railing killing stuff. Don't bother caring about the objective at all. PP and RR both I am usually the only one using friendly fire to heal and top off the defense objectives. RR is getting better. But usually it is about 1-3 people doing the mine collection. Which isn't too bad because that's all you need if you have enough defending. I think it takes 2.5 people to collect ore from the entire area to complete. 
---
The main strategy is to go and get everyone to just do the deathclaw side and defend her. Then kill the sheepsquash.
---
But the xp gained is huge. Fail the event, you're there to grind xp when you do it solo and lord is there a ton to get there.
---
Actually the kidnapped boy you could almost completely figure out. Its just a matter of not knowing what ‘exactly’ happened to him. You can figure out who kidnapped him, why, and where he was taken to, along with what happened after that. Which church was the haunted church? Don’t recall offhand for that one. And the interloper is probably going to play a role sometime way down the line, is what I figure at this point.
---
Only person who used a card, should be able to start it, even if 1750 caps is not much per card, its still caps

That’s quite jarring!
---
It's currently unclear how it works atm. Today I got 9 and my friend got 6. Yesterday we both had 9. I'm far ahead of him on the season track (lvl 56 against thirty-something), so it does not seem to be tied to overall prigress directly.
---
The weight limit is the worst. Being a new player my default walk out the door weight I'm already at about 130/215!

Game Pass.
---
Advantages of fo76 on games pass now brings new players into the mix do just gotta let them build up to buying or help em out and gift them
---
I think servers were taken down to finally deal with the duping glitch that has been massive exploited as of late.
---
Just tested 720p getting 60fps i haven't played a game in 720p in probably a good 6-7 years. Must be a VRAM issue apparently 970 has 4gb Vram but after 3.5 the last .5 is slower. Also i never changed INI simply put it to 1280x720 and 60fps.
---
3 of 4 my characters only have 1-2 in charisma. Only for travel agent/tenderizer. So I don't share perk cards. Min-max builds to the point where I don't need lone wanderer. With the new public teams, lone wanderer has become irrelevant. Points saved went to other attributes.
---
Yeah why bother hunting for legendary mobs then, if you gonna drop the loot afterwards, right? Bethesda just dont want people play the game, since there is no endgame, other than gathering legendaries
---
Is there any use for floater grenades beyond tossing them for fun or destroying them for inventory space?
---
I got it on Ps4. That’s where I wish it was cross platform play.
---
If it was using God Mode I would be a much higher level.  Also I was using full unyielding, max int build, well rested, canned meat stew, and 100% Xp bonus from lunch boxes.  My post already details the lengths I went to during the grind.
---
I keep losing track of legendary corpses. lost a few 3 stars today lol.
---
Does grenadier help increase the radius of the AOE at all?
---
I use them to wake up floaters if I don't feel like aiming for their little snorkel. also I just like anything that goes boom.
---
"works for me :^)"
---
Be careful some plans are like gold in this game...
---
Gun is heavy, need to shoot bullets to make lighter :)
---
Run it as admin and it should work
---
Is there a wiki where you can find out how much the plans are actually worth. So I can not be scammed
---
Im not sure. I believe it does with the initial blast but the grenades need a consistent aoe damage for them to be a decent grenade.
---
In my opinion, all the grenades kind of suck.
---
It's infuriating too because they seemed to be heading down the right path with the vault raid rewards. You had a power armor that once you got the plans was attainable after a set amount of vault steel. Then you had solar or thorn armor which you got with vault steel and legendary modules, but every single roll was a 3-star meaning you always got 24 scrip back, which was a half a legendary module. 
---
And then they released the bullion items and ruined it by adding the possibility of rolling a 1- or 2-star  which makes 2/3 of your tries invalid out the door and reduces the scrip you get back. Plus they now cost two modules to make and everything is stuck behind the double rep/bullion grind. It's hard to thing of another way they could have ruined a good system more.

I'm sitting at 130 with about 400hrs in but I've used every XP boost when available... have seen multiple characters over 800 and their just insane builds. No reason to PVP any of them. I have one buddy who's at 1000 and he's just bored playing. Mainly helps me and "low" characters like myself.. his words not mine
---
That's still very good. I think with double score/XP coming that'll boost.
---
I went through website and did refund process I said my “son” bought it and I needed money back and they gave me a refund for a game I didn’t want cause it sucked if you call they try to say it’s impossible but they are lying it can be done
---
Interesting what leads people to not like strange in numbers?
---
everything is working as Bethesda intended. unless they change their key performance index of daily logins, nothing is going to change
---
remember, they don't want people playing longer hours, they want them playing everyday over an extended period
---
Build limit just isn't possible, the game already runs like absolute ass as it is. They'd need to start dishing out the money for real servers and we all know that's never going to happen. Even if they did rent out proper ones, nobody knows how much that would help on this nearly 20-year-old abortion of an engine. It could probably work with private servers, and iirc they did say something about larger building budgets with fallout 1st. Would be nice if they ended up delivering on that one day.
---
Same issue with stash, even with 800 you can reach a point where its barely possible to navigate it. That seems to just be an engine issue because it's so horribly inefficient at storing so many separate items. The scrapbox is the closest you'll ever get to a stash increase because having 50 steel or 5000000 steel doesn't really make a difference. There's a bigger strain from having 3 unique handmade rifles.
---
Cap limit is just pointless if they're not going to ban cheaters and they're not going to remove cheated items. Letting people get more caps in a day will just make them more worthless than they already are. And raise the cap limit to 800k, then people will be charging 800k+ for the rarest items. You might think having more caps on hand will help you but your overall buying power would just be diminishing, and the game would just end up favoring the cheaters who have everything even more than it already does.
---
Daily scrip and gold caps aren't necessary and those two could be taken out without any real trouble. Their only purpose is to make up for the lack of end-game content, so with us quickly approaching the two-year anniversary of the game, it's high time they start adding real content and get rid of the arbitrary limits
---
Yep, I'd be willing to put up with the games problems if there was a reason to grind, grinding for its own sake is not entertaining.
---
I've done my time in MMOs with stupid grinds, the difference was they all had a goal, beat the harder boss etc..
---
They need to buff it. Just stealth unarmed was 6k per regular hit. Just Chinese stealth suit on
---
I want strange in numbers and hard mentality; extra xp from event is gravy. I tend to swap between farming and events myself, so I'll get the extra xp even if it just me.
---
This made me laugh out loud. Anyone want to fight a colossus? Sorry he dead now lol
---
Yup I can imagine, the servers are all fully of low levels: events are being done and not a lot of groups.
---
It makes you jump crazy high with marsupial for one which some people don't like. I've seen others complain about it. Personally I love it. Makes my melee damage that much better.
---
I feel as though they added two extra daily challenges so you can afford to skip the NW challenges now.
---
I don’t think so, it’s got a human counting in the background so I doubt it’s of alien origin. In fact, I think there is a post decrypting the messages which reveal the backstory. And it has to do with the Brotherhood.
---
That site is not any kind of accurate anyway.
---
I typically sell my plans for 1/2 the default value.  On an average night I’ll pick up an extra 2-3k in sales.  It’s not a lot but I use the funds to take care of what I want to get and also shop from other players.
---
absolutely. plus the extra dailies we got this weekend? i have a bit of cushion right now, but eventually i gotta farm some exp to make my lead a bit comfier 😂
---
Those are Rookie numbers. My fiancée’s load out is so heavy that he almost exclusively has to wear PA. O.O
---
Seconded. Fighting the Queen is the best way to see how active your server is.
---
"This unit is off duty, have a nice day." 
---
I feel cheated, left out, my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined. only time i have ever killed insult bot.
---
Ah ok yea I’m with you I couldn’t imagine not having my mutations like marsupial, speed demon and what not. To each their own though.
---
[Found it, the encrypted broadcast is for the BoS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/gy8paa/encrypted_bos_radio_transmission/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Or make it so you can go over the limit, but cashing in weapons after that point will give you scrip IOU notes that can be saved and cashed in for actual scrip later (like Treasury Notes &amp; Gold Bullion)
---
No, nor did it need it since it didn't have low caps on amount of storage/construction. I had an entire building in sanctuary that served as a museum to every legendary I accrued in the game. This did not count against any storage limit that was artificially restricted nor against my construction budget other than placing the display stands which had very very low budget impact
---
About to log in, I can give you some yellowcake flux for your shower.
---
Heck yes, me too! Space Quest and King's Quest were my favorite games as a youngster.
---
Hmm interesting how much int are you running? Also are you using lunchboxes?
---
They could both use a Reflex Sight at least, maybe a few alternate barrels to vary the damage/fire rate ratio, and a few alternate mags for the LMG like stinging, perforating, etc
---
But what would really be a game changer, is a scope for the LMG. That'd give it new life as a sniper rifle for heavy weapons builds.
---
thats the first thing i noticed.
---
28, I dont do most of the NW dailies though, Zorbo is well in front of me
---
That would be incredible!  Please let me know if you want anything in return!  IGN is CreamyZombie
---
Im just joking.
---
And Quest for Glory and Police Quest.  They taught me the English language
---
28 is still a great spot considering the boosts coming. Glad they also added an additional 500 score to get per day.
---
And English is my native language 😂
---
The repeater rifle from NV, and the classic laser pistol that looks like something RoboCop would use.
---
I am on PC. But I’m at work :(
---
thanks though! :)
---
Can't shake these nightmares... Listening to the astronaut forever... Just... why?
---
Happens to me all the time. I know it's Beth's servers cause I don't have this issue with any other game.
---
I too did Event Teams for the first few days. Then I realized I earn more XP with the Build Team lol
---
Yes we really do. Can't wait for the event :)
---
Ive done radiation rumble alone it’s easy who said it was hard
---
Honestly, I am so tired of this crap I don't even want to play this game. This legendary item management simulation kinda sucks and having multiple accounts to manage things is insane. I think someone in the design team is convinced if they up they cap by even a little everyone is going to get their dream weapon and everyone will get bored and stop playing. However that is pretty likely to happen now anyway with the stupid item dupe being done by idiots as of late so that dev is dead wrong for more than one reason ;)
---
upvote for AYB reference
---
... seen it before and that isn’t what that weapon does lol. Also no hacked web is going to crash your game. The worst offender, which was the mirv launcher, is no longer capable as of a couple pitches ago - it used to bring down servers. Also reporting the guy is futile, woes are traceable and not everyone is up to speed.
---
I just decided not to have doors in my camp.
---
We really need more end-game team events like the SBQ. One is not the way but who knows how long a fourth one will take.
---
Oh, by the way, as I go back to my game to try to fast travel again, the FUCKING LOCATION is gone from my map, just gone. Pffffffffft
---
I've been trying to complete Fun and Games for 3 hours but something always breaks like robots getting stuck in pods or RaRa just going complete vegetable lol. Typical Bethesda
---
Edit: get to the end of mission. Disconnected from server. FFS
---
The VATS is broken for some weapons for example I seem to always hit my shotgun hits in VATS even if the enemies are far away, if I try to hit with no Vats it misses everything sicne shotguns are low range :P
---
Once you unlocked the ability to craft backpacks you can simply craft an appropriate level from the armor workbench.
---
Yes.   
---
I wasnt really speaking of myself, I never lined up for anything in my life, and I don't even care about this stuff except on principal of not liking where the game dev industry has taken things in general.
---
FOMO is a marketing strategy to take advantage of people psychologically.  That's like the entire point.  They aren't just feeding a need, they are fostering it.    
---
Just because it doesn't effect you personally doesn't mean it doesn't effect any one or that they aren't trying intentionally.  It does and they are, and it's gross.
---
Preying on others sympathy. I might get feel bad for someone that gets scammed but I would never trust a random strangers word enough to give them something.
---
I don't think it's condescending. I think it's more a reference to a lot of the posts on the sub regarding those specific things.
---
Yeah I get that, but that's a whole different grind. Why give you a backpack for free if its underleveled?
---
I have a sword for the legendaries and just quick tap between the sword and my normal shotgun without even going to the favorites menu.
---
Open your weapons list and switch from your current weapon to a weak weapon. Now close the menu and use the d pad (on PS4) to switch between those weapons.
---
Tap left - sword, tap left again - shotgun.
---
\+25 sounds too much that would be 100 total, maybe 10-15 per bound, sounds more realistic if they ever make it. Great idea!
---
I'm pretty sure the damage buff with r5 demo expert was like 17 points on my gauss mini. Not worth it imo. If you already have demo expert just throw it on and see how you like it. If not, it is boost 60% of 20% of your guns damage.
---
Make the scrip limit based on how much your allowed to spend NOT how much you can get.
---
I dont care if the market prices go up. I wanna sell my shit so my stash wont be full all the time!
---
Ammo (5mm, 0.50, 0.45, 308 and 5.56) for 1 cap each and some crafting mats. Dont sell stimpacks or water, they weight alot in your stash and noone buy them, sell to vendors
---
Excavator? Because if so try the hi cap backpack mod
---
The game board is so ridiculously pleasing. Something about it and the music stirs up some nostalgia for something I never experienced.  
---
15/10 for the designers.
---
Haha... Yeah I assumed it would only get worse as I go!
---
They need some new legendary effects. Bullets exploding shouldn’t be the only visually different one.
---
You can craft standard backpacks now, so just make a new one and delete that one, its what I did. No idea why the level is so low, i assume its a bug like the VATS unknown one.
---
These where pretty early on atomic shop items
---
Dood every mmo rpg gear level based game does this 9/10 I always get shit I don’t need or want so I sell or scrap
---
Ive never had a problem. Sit on the island and kill the swarm. Ps4
---
Yep I’m on Xbox and there’s way less veterans around. It’s the new players from game pass
---
Yeah fallout 76 is usually really good about quest rewards being appropriately leveled, every quest is like that unless its bugged
---
42, hopefully 43 by the end of the day. XP gain is slow unless I use lunchboxes and stuff as I'm a low INT full hp build, so no unyielding armour for me. Early on I would try to get a level or 2 out of my dailies and then grind another level out, now I'm just goin for 1 off dailies and maybe a full level via grinding too, though I'm not sure how long I could keep that up. Looking forward to double XP weekend, if I can get a good boost there and overtake Zorbo then I think I can just relax for the rest of the season.
---
Also, I am NOT doing those NW challenges, so even more exp to farm.
---
It gives you +10 more inventory space.  To craft a level 50 one requires the most basic mats
---
Nobody would ever buy fallout first that’s the point they wanna trap you to a subscription
---
Happened to me today, killed a legendary Col. Handy, it died and blew itself up then killed a legendary Scorch Beast died and disappeared before I got to it. Then a legendary Mirelurk King died and had nothing on it when I went to loot it. It sucks, the game is so buggy but it's still new so give them time. /S
---
Simply delicious
---
Right click then look down for run as administrator
---
Honestly I always start if as soon as I get there. I can keep everyone alive so I figure if I'm lucky someone will join and grab ore if not might as well eat up as much xp as possible. I'll grab ore if I feel it's safe but more often than not it fails because everyone just farms xp and rarely do I trust people enough to go mining.
---
Literally everyone...except we call them mules, because they hold all the stuff we don’t want to get rid of, or may want to trade later...I named mine Tank :)
---
I just hit 30 tonight.
---
The earliest my job will open is right after Labor Day, so I've got time.
---
I'm not super concerned if I get everything but I would certainly like to. It helps that my job is closed (and it is in Summer usually) and every social event everywhere is cancelled.
---
When life does get back to normal, I definitely won't be playing for hours each day.
---
As a melee build, it’s hard to even know it’s a legendary before you one hit it sometimes. I know it only spawns up top, but I’m not going to tread lightly just in case it’s a legendary. I put 95% of the blame on Bethesda for making you have to worry about this in the first place.
---
The other two maybe, but I can pretty much instakill the ISS while remaining hidden and using only 2 quantums to tank all 3 pylons
---
Yeah it’s excavator. And we are on PS4. No mods that I know of. Plus for him, his tadpole challenge is glitched so he’s never finished it. This wasn’t discovered until he was over level 80 and he wasn’t gonna restart from nothing just for a backpack.
---
I ran bloody for a bit but went back to my old build. It completely eliminates the challenge in the game. The game is easy enough without breaking it further lol
---
This. Make sure Pacifist mode is on though!
---
If you interact with her you can get a daily quest for a legendary. Sometimes its even a 3 star.
---
Nice name...mine are Carrie and Porter.
---
Mod all your armor to pocketed and mind your perk cards for reduced weight of items you carry the most of. Also, mind you’re not carrying around unread plans and recipes (their weight will add up quick when you’re a newer player).
---
Oh the backpack with hi cap is better than the excavator but I feel bad as I don't know how to fix a bugged quest what part is glitched?
---
Thats exactly why I hadnt done it before. I know for a fact that if I invested enough time into it I could turn my half-ass build into a God. Thats why I am also going to turn back in the near future.
---
Something that can help is getting a Shishkebab and the Friendly Fire perk.  You can slash at friendly NPCs to restore their health.
---
Here we are nearly 3 months later and this STILL isn’t fixed... WHY, Bethesda? WHY?!?!?! And the worst part of it all is that it makes the power armor completely useless, as the damage resistance becomes nonexistent...
---
I'm running 3 characters. My very first (post wastelanders) character is kinda broken and I cbf levelling to get the perks and change the SPECIALS to fix him, so he just holds my excess caps for me, I started my 2nd character, which is now level 280 and my current main after that, I also have a 3rd going at around level 28 or so, was going to go with some kind of shotgun build, but after all the rep grinding and crap on my main I couldn't be bothered doing it again.
---
32, should hit 33 tomorrow. I had hoped to be at 20 by end of week one, I hit 19 because I missed 2 NW challenges. And hoped to be between 32 and 35 by end of week two so I'm on the lower end of where I wanted to be but I'm happy. Now I'm hoping to hit 45 by end of week three which is a stretch, unless we keep getting the 2 extra challenges like we did today and yesterday. Otherwise I'll probably hit 42 to 43.
---
I was actually saying something just like this, every duping wave that has happened since launch has been the market regulating it's self. Now these formally unobtainable weapons are easy to get and accessible both for people like us who have played since beta, and the people just coming in because the game is on gamepass now. Bethesda has already started moving to the new system of craftable legendaries that cannot be traded, so I feel like there lack of substantial action about this insane dupe wave is because they don't care anymore, and never really did.
---
Try soloing it with with a 1 star Bloodied Ultracite gatling laser. That shiz to me an hour to do.
---
I did get that once. Do none of the other guys/gal have that same one?
---
Try the cyrolator to slow it down then a one hit melee.
---
my bloodied power fist does 20k damage.
---
So it sounds like the issue isn't around caps though. Sounds like there needs to be more uses to the items in your stash
---
I would love this. This game needs a hoard mode so bad. Or something like the rift system in d3
---
Damn. So I'll likely never get them if they haven't cycled back through yet
---
Glad to see someone picked up on that, haha 😁
---
They may have and I’m sure they will pop up
---
Its very simple. Make it so ALL allies speak less frequently. Add more dialogs and songs.
---
Bloodied faster swing +strength rolling pin
---
I’d love a canning machine that works like this
---
What would you recomend?
---
I understand this was loosely explained but I hope some people could relate and/or help
---
Depends. What item are you stockpiling? What item types are taking up the most room in your stash?
---
im on ps4 as well and it bugs most of the time. very frustrating.
---
Like it or not, they're not gonna up it because it means you're gonna come back every day, they want you as a daily active user. It's a disgusting trend I see in newer games that have some daily bullshit or limit time shit and it's literally to entice you into playing every day so you normalize it/ up their DAU numbers and or buy into mtx
---
I'll keep my fingers crossed that those and the Thanksgiving display will be back in soon
---
the fastest way would be to run all the int buffs and tag along on events with lots of consistant mobs like line in the sand and radiation rumble. emmet mountain is a good place to farm mutations which you will want(egghead, herd mentality); it has a rad shower just inside and pools of toxic water which will mutate you easily. remember you can only get one mutation per server. also you can massacre the scavs they are high level and dont fight back
---
I can't be sure, but I don't think it was specifically targeted. I built near Morgantown and someone here was saying apparently there's a specific mineral or resource people try to get around there sometimes...  If it happens heaps I'll be annoyed but yeah like you said, it happens! 😊
---
lmao
---
Garbage guns and armor I want to scrip. For the most part. Also a bunch junk but that Im not getting rid of.
---
this is YOUR fault
---
Joined a party today on ps4, sbq is up and 1 of the 4 is down there so I fast travel and help with the kill. Half the server is fighting but not the other 2 in the group. Finish up and I see a event pop nearby and go, and I'm soloing it as a level 30, repairing a sam to shoot at a lvl 80 legendary scorchbeast. Finish the event and spend the next 20 mins plinking arrows and pot shots at the beast as I repair the sam. Not once do any of the group come help, I look at the map, 2 are at their camps and the other seems to be just doing quests. I mean I guess we get bonus xp, but is that all there is?
---
And you seem to forget that fallout 4 had infinite stash, and scrip being a currency to buy legendary modules
---
Wow! Thank you!!!
---
Im the guy/team that launched trios queens on public (we all have private servers lol).... just so all the low levels can get exp/stuff.
---
If they're still showing up in the challenges list, you can track from there.  I'm not able to go check atm but hopefully there's something.
---
I only kill him after the joke is delivered
---
Cool thanks for the tip!  I became so rich in FO4 from my water farms, lol. But you're right about the weight... I'm finding it hard to manage my weight in FO76 because every container you can build is linked to your stash!
---
yes its very frustrating missing out on loot. you never know, that enemy could have had that one legendary weapon with the rolls you you were looking for but now you'll never know...
---
you had me for a sec on that last sentence lmao.
---
It worked perfectly for me. Thanks!
---
Junk items i can't help you as the fo1st id pretty much 99% reliant on the scrapper haha. 
---
For legendary items, same ad I said before. Beth needs to allow us to extract a special resource from legendary items with regular crafting stations. This resource then would be used in consumables we use on a regular basis. Special ammo of thr same damage as ultracite. Special aid items or Chems
---
Down the line you can lock content behind consumables. To start X vault raid or daily ops, you need a power core crafted from this resource. Similar to a craftable nuclear card
---
You dont get it mate, when running for ore in power armor, with radx diluted and glowing blood, you still getting tons of rads. And i cant use hazmat, due to weight problems lol
---
Vats doesn't stop time, it just kinda slows it.
---
You can plant and farm the usual crops like in fallout 4, just put down your camp or capture a workshop! There are water purifiers too so place those down as well. Gear, well that just drops from enemies and stuff. 
---
And I forgot your 3rd question already and am on mobile so two seconds....
---
The questing is really entirely up to you. I can't think of anything you NEED to do or warrants it being a must finish kinda quest.
---
As for stars, in 4 there were legendary weapons. Same in 76, different stars means the level of how good the mod is. Right now there's only 0-3 stars.
---
What do you mean by "Public event tab"? Are you referring to the social menu where you add and invite friends?   
---
I'm having a hard time understanding what your actual issue is, but if you want to load into the same world as someone else, you need to join them via the ingame social tab. If you're having trouble reaching that tab, or its not displaying correctly, I'm not really sure what to do, it could be account related or something. I'd suggest both going to [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) and creating accounts, then linking your xbox accounts to them, that may help.
---
HOW DO YOU DO THIS?!
---
Let's hope a scorched beast doesn't fly into your camp and melt those load bearing steel beams.
---
Mistress of mystery?
---
Thanks.
---
Exit your power armor?
---
I dont actually think that would be a good idea. Most of us like the current system. We just want it to give us more wigle room. 
---
I dont like hunting down specific resources to craft stuff. I, and many others, am a scrapper. Not a crafter.
---
vats works in real time.. there is no stop/slow time.. you dont stack your shots and watch them happen.. you fire manually
---
level up before you go to do missions in the savage divide or eastward..
---
stay in the forest at first doing events, discovering locations..
---
then move north into the Toxic Valley doing more of the same.. just keep hammering events and dailies and discover as many places as you can
---
when you are ready to move on from there go south into the ash heap.. and repeat the process..
---
I would still be doing events in the forest and in the toxic valley too...
---
keep swapping out your armors to whatever has the best stats.. until you start getting legendary drops and to max level gear
---
as for weapons.. keep upgrading whenever you can.. try to have weapons that use different ammo.. and carry something for melee too... ammo is a crunch at first...
---
you should collect and scrap all of the weapons and armor mobs drop that you arent going to use so that you learn plans and have materials to craft with..
---
I wouldnt hit it until you have some mediocre gear and a few levels on you but the Leader Of The Pack event is great for low level legendary drops to help you while leveling...
---
anything on the map in the Savage Divide(exception being the immediate area of Top Of The World) and Eastward to the Mire and Bog can potentially spawn max level mobs..
---
Avoid that unless you enjoy having your ass handed to you repeatedly.. youll need to be in a protective team or have some decent gear and better perks unlocked(aka more levels) before you head out East
---
personally.. I dont do much more than rub up against the early Main Questline missions until I am lvl 50.. 
---
some people DGAF but if you want the mission rewards to be max level youll want to wait until youre lvl 50 too.. again, some people just do them and level with those items..
---
**when leveling up BE AWARE you do not have to pick a Perk Card from the same stat you place your level point in!!** 
---
after you place your point for leveling up you can scroll the stats and pick any card you have unlocked..
---
ALSO - you cant "bank" levels waiting for cards to unlock.. for example you cant pick a card that unlocks at level 10 until you have spent your points for the previous levels...
---
thats my sloppy opinion on early game for noobs in short...
---
Totally unrelated but love the guild wars name!
---
Not really... and some of them are things you wouldn't think of like the healing salv from the mire can get u a legacy item bundle atm. If u look through a trading forum though you'll get a good idea of what's in demand and you can always ask them for a price check.
---
Exactly!  It's like the cops only show up in my suburb when they have at least 3 squad cars together.  Same principle.
---
Has happened a few times with me n friends.  After a few unsuccessful attempts. My friend on ps4.. closed game app, restarted ps4... then tried to join world. At that time it worked.  To prevent future issues he went into settings n disabled public team pop up notification
---
I have 5. 3 are mules. One is my nw char who I just started playing as a stealth commando haha
---
Sure because you totally need to store all those useless legendaries even in Fallout 4.
---
What happens if you beat Zorba and if you dont anyway? I havent seen any info on the consequences
---
Happens to me more then I care for...
---
I knew I could’ve worded it better. It lets me load into the world with her but then my screen turns black after it shows the blue public team tab on the bottom right. So I’m loaded in but I’m not able to play
---
That's why I liked Gramps until he bugged out on me and won't give me quests anymore.
---
Raider Punk is the least annoying but he has a tendency to be in my Vendor building, which none of the other Allies wander around quite as much.
---
I don't want to listen to any of Daguerre's nonsense. Everyone has nightmares; most of us have a sigh of relief or a chuckle and move the fuck on with our lives. Except in Appalachia, the nightmares continue with such joys as Floaters and Crazed Junkie Gangs. Anyway, she needs to go to therapy; you can't tell me they don't have someone who can run group therapy at Foundation. Program another Sunny for it.
---
You don't have to hunt down anything. You already have it in your inventory. It's a simple 2 extra button clicks and you're done.
---
The feels.
---
Oh wow thanks for replying so fast :O
---
Thank you for answering my questions but with my " How does the V.A.T.S work in 76? " question i meant how do i target different body parts? every time i've been going into vats i just awkwardly try to select a body part which for some reason it doesnt let me do and therefore i always hit the chest.
---
As long as they also reduce the buy prices...
---
VATS definitely works in real time.
---
Nah, the issue is the lack of good cash sinks.
---
Oh I used to do it in power armor and go to the showers in the center before I hit 50%...
---
I dont ever bother picking 1* and sometimes 2* items . 4 mules filled with usable weapons , scrip weapons , dogfood , stins &amp; ammo . Been playing since day 1 and dont even wanna know how many items i left cause all my mules are soon at max weight
---
Scrip system has got to change
---
Loved watching the movie as a kid, always wished I had the actual board game to see if it was really that much fun.
---
also.. my advice for when you fill up your stash...
---
I have given up on trying to save it for others, it's a level 35 legendary weapon or armor. Yall can chill, it's only use is scrip anyway. It sounds harsh but most times I join this event it's first come first serve and with 5-8 other people, good luck.
---
No...that i renember...think the plan is needed to repair the suit?
---
No but it’s hard not to 1 shot things when you’re melee, and c’mon it’s a video game. RELAX.
---
I have to vendor all the 3 stars "heavy" weapons due to the scrip limit.
---
Sometimes I just sit there questioning back and forth if I should buy something in fear they might log off. Then I buy it. Then I regret. When will i learn eh?
---
Sorry, I thought you were having trouble finding your friends world or something. 
---
You can turn public team notifications off in the gameplay menu, if its the popup causing the bug, this may fix it.
---
You need a certain perk to do that. Think it's concentrated fire under per
---
Can’t spell BETHESDA without EA
---
I actually dont mind. Today a lvl 21 came to my camp and bought like 15 plans for 20 caps each. I decided to give this guy full heavy BoS combat armor and some reinforced underarmor.
---
I second this.  He produces good content for us players.
---
36. 3 away from that plushie!
---
Make a mobile camp and skip those fansy mansions. Stay 1 weeknonn an extractor then move = problem solved
---
I got close to 40k steel, acid &amp; lead + over 3k of all other junk. Played since day 1
---
Gauss pistol, same thing. Also, gauss specific bug = you get locked out of using sprint/reload/items (including stimpacks) you have to holster to fix. Happens A LOT. FUN TIMES! Why do these bugs exist for like 4 months now? Idk :D I have been screaming my eyes out for some time now to the point that I get downvoted, it's really sad.
---
I am not changing my gunslinger bloodied build even if its underpowered, but I will seriously consider quitting the game if this doesn't get fixed come next patch. The number of times I've died because of this are countless.
---
Just give them away bro lol
---
Do ppl even buy plans anymore
---
Oh Zathura.  Tha boardgame based on a movie based on a movie based on a boardgame based on a picture book.
---
Yeah I agree. I’m getting tired of dumping these plans on new players.
---
I toss mine on for 5-10 caps. Maybe 15 for "rarer" ones. Sometimes they sit, and sometimes they fly off the shelf.
---
Other times, I seek out newbies and drop the non-sellers or excess inventory.
---
The problem is, I have enough stuff to sell for 1400 caps a day that the minimal amount the Vendor Bots would likely pay wouldn't be worth it. I'd rather drop them for newbies than make a nickel.
---
OP means the legendary effect, not power armor.
---
Bloodied builds didn’t appeal to me, until I rolled a bloodied gauss minigun. Now I see the appeal and am currently running bloodied.
---
Even more exciting with a cliff base...
---
Oh man. That thing must shred.
---
If nothing else, Covert Operative first. Max leveled.
---
When the only thing hanging on is your pinky toe on that grain of sand 800 feet up.
---
I tend to buy anything decent and add it to the trades pile
---
They should let us buy Legendary modules with Caps, simply because there is very little in the endgame that actually requires caps, this would add another currency sink and give us a way to get modules without having to rely solely on farming scrip. Still keep it to 10 modules a day and price them accordingly, but I know I'd rather be able to spend money on legendary modules instead of going around buying up scrap and assaultron recall boards just so i dont hit 30k and start losing money.
---
You can carry more out of power armour tell him to get full unyeilding armour set with deep pockets  and a back packI can carry over 500 at anyone time PA is crap in this game compared to what it should be
---
What platform? If XB1 I have one for you
---
Gauss weapons can not get the explosive legendary effect but they hav an explosive effect built in already and its buffed by demo expert
---
I'm loving the new players. I hate dumping items that can be used so I end up hoarding things that don't sell but finally new players to give plans to and I've been dropping a heap of stimpak supers that are weighing me down and I can never sell enough. Some level 7s may of gotten a little overweight picking up everything I dropped
---
I’m bloodied and think sharing that would be hilarious. Please don’t do it.
---
Hope so and I will do thanks 👍
---
I love it. I don’t use it all the time since the ammo is so expensive to craft, really only for occasions when a lot of things need to die quickly. It does decent damage to the queen but is better used on her subjects.
---
What platform? 
---
40% FSS is a secondary effect, instigating is good for double damage when enemy is at full health
---
I have four characters. My main is level 157, power armor, heavy weapons, just got a vampiric gauss minigun that wrecks everything. 2nd character is level 89 lucky stealthy ninja sniper. 3rd character is level 70 lucky automatic rifle critical hit machine. 4th character is level 87, Wolverine - bloodied build, bloodied mole miner gauntlet, healing factor, etc. Oh, and uh, I just created an archer/bow-user character, level 20.
---
PSN? I'll buy some!
---
Well it’s more or less just for the team buffs. I’ll do some events here and there but I’m here for the buffs.
---
He pulled that on me and it was the first insult that I didn't laugh at but felt genuinely insulted by. Also the first and only time I killed him
---
He has pretty much maxed what he can get out of his armor (though it’s not a full unyielding build). The biggest problem is he can’t get the full sized backpack and he refuses to choose just 2 or 3 guns and a melee. He always has about 10 on him plus the ammo. He is a good player, just loves his guns LOL
---
Im at like 15.
---
Hey thanks for replying!
---
Im on PC.
---
I have 5 and for a while there I was getting 1500 caps/day on all of them by dropping gear on a private server and picking up the gear on the others characters &amp; selling.  
---
I have since grown bored of that and one is just a storage mule,  one is a sneak rifle sniper, one is a pistol build, and a third will be a strength build (heavy gun, or shotgun, or melee, or maybe all three) if I don't burn out before then.  No plans yet for the other guy, probably just max his 30,000 caps at some point nothing else.
---
Totally agree till they sort out the legendary system I don't care about dupers at all every weapon should be able to be crafted from legendary modules but make it more modules take a while to grind them but least you get some variation on what you want not right one do it again there's the grind but least it's some what fair. I'm looking for outfit my self the drop rate is terrible, doing over 100 events a day no items in the last week or two you should be guaranteed a outfit drop after so many event.
---
Yup
---
You on ps4 ? I just get 1 or 2 of my friends, go to Grafton Steel and then we take turns jumping of the pipes
---
Im gonna answer this with as much fact as possible. I'm not being facetious.  
---
If an item says +1 Agility, then while equipped, you have +1 Agility. You dont  get more perk cards. But more passive agility. Agility gives you more AP .
---
Strength gives you melee damage abs carry weight, etc....
---
Does this help?
---
I have yet to die in this event.  And if you can't figure out how not to one-shot a legendary, you are seriously trying to be ignorant.
---
Yes! Thank you. I was so very confused lol.
---
Dude I love the ammo conversion! I had sooo much ammo no one was buying and I got to covert into something I can use!
---
Damn, it’s a real bummer that that feels like a real possibility.
---
If I'm first on scene, I usually wait for a few people to show up and then emote a thumbs up to ask them if they're good to go. Most of the time I get a thumbs up back and we kick off the event. Sometimes someone's sends out a thumbs down so we can wait for their friend or team mate to show up.
---
At the same time, I don't expect others to wait the entire timer down just in case I decide to show up late. If I want to be there, then I'll be there. If I'm late, that's not your problem. I'll do what I can to help, but it's your show.
---
Great suggestion!
---
How many minutes have you played? :)
---
Strangely, I went from the same to being able to headshot anything damn near through walls with a 10% chance to hit it seems.  It’s become so reliable that I’m rocket packing upwards and just VATS shooting everything even though it tells me I have no chance to hit it. 
---
Did something else break?? If so, DONT FIX IT!
---
I have fallout first and unlimited junk space does not mean I'm not up to m neck drowning in useless scrip (or decent weapons I can't sell because of the market crash)
---
Each passive stat helps with things.i mentioned strength and agility.
---
 Perception helps vats and accuracy.
---
 Endurance helps how much ap you use when sprinting and HP.
---
 Charisma affects vendor prices.
---
 Intelligence affects how fast things break and xp. Each point gives +2%xp. 
---
Luck helps crit meter and condition of found items.
---
I've maybe got around 20 int after being on a full building team and eating some scorched brains. I've used a few lunch boxes and had a few used near me, but it's not something that's regular by any means. I figured it's probably best to save them for the double exp weekend.
---
I do try to stack as many exp buffs as I can though. I always try to stay rested and I stay stocked on canned meat stew (which is double the effectiveness now with Carnivore). Also make sure to hit up Path to Enlightenment if it's up on you're planning on staying on the server. Even if you don't stack several buffs it's still not too hard to earn a lot of exp if you know where to look though.
---
I have a tendency to select something the opposite of what I'm attempting on the Favorites and Emotes wheel.
---
I accidentally gave an Angry face when I meant to do "Hello" (I was having a hard enough time coaxing Newbies to a bag of free stuff) or I select a weapon instead of water.
---
I don't know if it's my controller or the mechanics in particular.
---
The screws are the bigger draw for me, honestly, hahaha
---
Probably when the August update arrives.
---
It wouldn't really matter anymore because sometime around next season Bethesda will remove hunger and thirst. So food and water will just be used for health and buffs.
---
You're not alone. I'm lvl 190 &amp; screw up all the time. Still learning. 🤷
---
I have never pressed in on right stick on this game. If this actually does something, my interest is peaked.
---
My Int is 12 before any buffs. X4 building team is awesome.
---
I killed it yesterday in like 5 seconds... he didn’t even got chance to mutate. Really depends on character build and weapon you are using.
---
How dare you hurt that beautiful golden boi.
---
Challenges and special events reset at Noon(12PM) Eastsrn(new york) time. 
---
Daily quests reset at 8PM eastern time.
---
Make 5 and a second account for mules. I have 5 (shotgun, big guns, rifles/bow, explosive, and pistol) I can farm 5 times the caps, bullion, script, and quests for plans.
---
I mean don't get me wrong I don't even bother with the legendaries since I'd just one shot them but if you're bloodied its 100% very easy to die when mole miners have shotguns
---
Yep it does..... ...............
---
It hurts my feelings. They’re legit burns.
---
Bit off topic but is it possible to fully fill the urainum bar when the event is running only ever seen to get 80 percent full.
---
I sold a ton of scrip fodder this weekend. I lowered my prices for the purveyor sale this weekend and did was constantly selling gear.
---
Thanks!
---
As long as the devs keep listening to the community this game can only get stronger
---
It really bothers me when season passes or seasonal events in games offer no leeway for players. I’m in a very transitional period of life right now, and a lot of things are demanding my time and attention. Even still, ive played every day. I think in total I’ve missed like 1 or 2 weeklies, and a handful of dailies. Currently I’m a rank 27, which I thought was good because I’ve also done the repeatable quite a bit, but I think I’m already too far behind to catch up. 
---
My life and also inexperience with fo76 just aren’t suited for the season pass for this game I suppose. People keep saying it’s possible as long as you don’t miss ANY challenges, but can a majority of us really afford to do them all every day/week? 
---
I’ve run into this problem with other games I like too. If there’s not at least a handful of days (like 5 or 6 ideally) of time that you can miss, I don’t think they’re designed with the players best interests in mind. 
---
Anyway I hope this doesn’t sound like I’m just ranting for no reason. The truth is I like this game a lot more than I usually admit to people. It just reminds me that not all online games are full of shitty players who grief others and get upset when someone isn’t as good as them. I’ve had some cool interactions with some people, and it made me value my time playing even more. And because of that, I just want to see it offer a better experience for these players. I’ve seen some great suggestions from the community, that I doubt Bethesda will listen to, but can you imagine the game we would have if they did?
---
Tldr: No leeway within season passes/events sucks, and it’s definitely not designed with the players best interests in mind. I like fallout 76, so I just hope to see Bethesda do better than this.
---
It's supposed to be the sneak button. If I remap sneak to another button, sneak works. But whatever button in mapped to right stick doesn't work.
---
Yup. PC, XBox, PS4. And from what I've heard it's never going to get fully addressed because they would have to tear apart the very mechanics of the game. They'll just keep patching and adding Band-Aids that will cause other problems that will need to be fixed later on.
---
It almost feels like this game is slowly gradually eating itself.
---
Similar thing for Order of Mysteries; you get low level items but can upgrade them easily.
---
It's odd.  The first time I saw one I solo'ed it, not one fear or spawn and don't think I popped a stimpak, just water.  And I'm not a heavy hitter.  Next few times were nightmarish, constant fears and spawns and ground covered in aoe goo.  Today, another solo fight, one spawn, zero fears, and all water.
---
I haven't even gotten far enough to mess with the emotes wheel. I'm big on sneaking, so I've been battling this since I started yesterday. Lol
---
Interesting, I've seen people in the paramedic suit wearing the first aid backpack, but I always thought the backpack was a skin from the atomic shop
---
Yeah "market value"  became so inflated that I stopped to even bother looking unless I really really need ammo quick. I just got tired of people trying to unload other people's duped gear.
---
There were tons of boardgames in this style in the 70s/80s. I still have one called Warlocks and Warriors.
---
Possum badges arent really easy to get though
---
I’ve never completed encrypted even when others join....
---
Yeah I saw this mentioned in another thread and have since been using the machine and this method, its still time consuming, but this atleast makes it less tedious.
---
RIP Adrenaline
---
I think think the plans only you don't know should show when you look at camp on map sick of looking for plans just to find the 500 in stock are mounted heads grr
---
1. Put every power armor piece you have in your stash. Your inventory has to be rid of any  power armor items.
---
2. Get rid of your old chassis by dropping it from your inventory or scrapping it.
---
3. Find a chassis in the world. You will need a newly untouched chassis. Check the online map of Fo76 for possible spawn points.
---
4. Take all the pieces out of it and then out of your inventory.
---
5. Remove the fusion core from it and drop ALL your fusion cores on the ground/ stash them in a container.
---
6. Enter the new chassis. It will let you do so, even if you have no cores.
---
7. Exit the chassis, pick up a fusion core and put it in the chassis.
---
8. Enter the chassis and check for it to have 60/60/60 DR.
---
9. Pick up your stuff.
---
It will give a nice bonus to your power armor DR, if you manage to do this correctly.
---
“1* instigating board”. Jesus that sucks.
---
Yeah last few times I came across the colossus I just kept running from him and letting his wendigo spawns chase me so I could kill them and farm screws. Went from always being borderline out of screws to having close to 1000 from farming 3 colossi. Considering he generally only drops 1 star crap for me, the screws atleast make it feel slightly more worth it.
---
The base backpack is functionally upgradable to a higher level (talking low level versus high level reward, not about modifications like high capacity) since getting the low level pack comes with the unlocked plan to craft backpacks at multiple levels for next to nothing in terms of material cost. It is supposed to drop a min level as a reward.
---
I get what you're saying, but to be fair, the latest Radiaton Rumble I was in had everyone waiting around in a neat little circle until the last minute (when there was less than 1 minute left on the clock to start) before we all gave thumbs up to show we were "ready" (basically an impromptu MMO-style ready check) before we finally began.
---
It was odd, but nice to see everyone sitting around in a big circle staring at each other, between turning around and walking about to see if anyone new was showing up.  We all had the epiphany that we needed to wait as long as possible before we started.
---
That was a good run.  Missed the final reward by a few ore, but that's because only 2 of us were gathering, and we did it between helping the others fight because we were paranoid about the NPC's going down.
---
Maybe that big bird thing pinned to Seneca Rocks. A new flying enemy would be cool, at least something with a gimmick different from the scorchedbeast
---
Ah ok, if you were on Xbox I’d have set you up with some stuff.
---
Feel free to dm me if you have any future questions.
---
Follow the wayward quest line, there is a point where you can chose a reward. It comes out as leveled to your character, so if you wait until level 50 to complete it, you’ll have a max level 2star legendary and they are set drops, so you can check for a list of the weapons and chose the one you want.
---
Pick a build and start getting the cards and special points in place when you level. It saves a lot of messing about after level 50. 
---
I have a few good locations for farming ammo materials, I’ve added a small section of a supply run I wrote to help you out.
---
Any level
---
Vault 76 - Ammo/Gunpowder in ammo boxes.
---
When you spawn in, Look at the Vault door. Turn left head towards the stairs, there is a dead body and ammo and a gun will be on them. Head down the slope, there are liberators dotted about this area, they will drop steel and fusion cells. On the ramp down to the lower carpark is an old army jeep, in the back of the jeep is an explosives crate. At the bottom of the slope, there is an APC and in the back is an ammo box and duffle bag. Round the front of the APC there is an ammo box and a first aid kit. As you head out the fence through the checkpoint, look left, there is an ammo box half sunk into the ground. The just round the corner of the sandbags is another ammo box. In the car park there is a bus with a duffle bag in it. There is a responders corpse next to the bus below the cliff. In Front of the two destroyed vehicles there is another ammo box.
---
Recommended level 10+
---
Morgan town train station for looting airport - Ammo, packaged food, aid items, scrap.
---
When you spawn turn left, head through the broken fence and past the red containers, there will be scorched to kill. In the music instrument area next to the glass habitat building. There will be some corpses and the responders corpse will have a random chem on him. As you move down the airport towards the tower, check all the tents and containers for random scrap. The tables under the cover have some plastic items on them. Head to the control tower, there is a first aid box inside the base of it, upstairs there is a static spawn for a hunting rifle or 10mm pistol and ammo. The scaffold next to the tower will have an ammo box at the top. Head left from the tower when you're looking at the doorway from the outside, in the open hanger is items to scrap on the bench and shelf for circuitry, lead, steel and copper. 
---
Make sure you check all the robot bodies throughout the area for extra steel and lead. Head into the next building, there is a safe with spitroast plan, 10mm pistol and ammo, aluminium, camera (springs) and trifold flag. Head up the stairs for a laser pistol and steamer trunk. On the bench in the middle is a clipboard and pencil and usually two fancy lads cakes. The racking next to the open sliding doors has two frag mines and the fusion generator can have a core in it.
---
Head across the road, pick the lock for extra aid items and food. Make sure to open the fridges for extra chems and iv bags. On the table in front of the next container will be a clipboard, in the shipping container will be a flip lighter and lamp in the barrell, random ammo and a gun in the open yellow crate, food and random scrap on the shelf. 
---
Loot the two tents for a doctors bad and first aid kit, along with more scrap. The building opposite will have a first aid kit immediately to the right as you walk in through the big front door.walking down the corridor, first room to the left will be a first aid box. Room on the right will have a mirror and doctors bag and a stimpak on the bench. Room at the end will have a couple chems on the racking and an abraxo cleaner on the shelf on the opposite side of the room. The far end of the room has items to scrap for plastic. Upstairs has a scorched body to loot and following it round will reveal a locked fridge with an aid box inside.
---
Into the helipad quarantine area, This will trigger an even called collision course, complete this for extra ammo from scorched and a supply drop. Sometimes there’s multiple boxes there when you get there as well. 
---
The plane section has two can chimes for lead. In the plane there is a safe for random loot, dirty water and recipe plans. Below the plane is random alcohol and hotdogs on the grill. In the small curved roof building is two aid boxes and behind the building there is a pit with 4 scorched bodies to loot for ammo and weapons. Head to the little lookout hut nearby, there is a set of binoculars and a static spawn for an army helmet.
---
In the big building in this section is a chem bench for scrapping and an acid waste item beside it. Over the other side of the room on the racking is 2x red fuel containers for plastic. A lvl1 aid box is to the left of this. In the next room is a lvl2 safe under the stairs and a red fuel container near the stairs. Upstairs and to the left you will find an ammo box, weapon and ammo on the floor, random packaged foods cooler and plastic items.
---
You can then go to the other side of the airport and down the steps for more scorched to kill. In the tents you will find aid items and a sfe with aid items in it, use the computer next to it to unlock.
---
Depends on the accuracy of the gun too... I had a tse double barrel that would always miss because the accuracy was literally 0 on it lol I would sometimes miss with my tse combat shotgun cause if it’s poor accuracy... what I found out is that just unvats and vats again when u miss the first two times... or u could always just manually aim u know...
---
Thank you sm for this detailed reply I was going insane 👍
---
I like my jetpack, the gauss shotgun is pretty cool too.
---
Just used this tactic and finished in 2nd place solo. Mighta gotten first if I’d found better weapons and armor
---
I fought my first Wendigo Colossus the other say thanks to public teams (they were getting feared) and oh man it's so fun even if you die
---
Keep a camera on you at all times. If a legendary disappears, pull out ya camera and point it around &amp; it will read what’s in sight- that’s how I find my kills.
---
Yes.
---
Bethesda will also come and take your first born for breaking their TOS.  
---
I guess I should have put an /s  
---
Bethesda seem to do very little when it comes to punishing people doing naughty things, whether they don't care or just don't have a system implemented to track it, I don't know, but I'm sure you will be fine.
---
No.
---
Yeah you're not gonna get any sold that way
---
Sorry his game glitched it soul destroying I can't get the plan knight Sargent paint . Just keeps giving me the captain one even. Though it should drop the Sargent and I'm level 245 don't want to make a new character for one plan. Hopefully the legendary perks will help his wait issue s
---
 I hate PVP in any game so if I plan on keeping a workshop for any amount of time I usually do it on a private server, but for the weekly challenge I just ran around claiming and abandoning workshops on a public server so I could get the XP boost from being in a party and didn't even build on any of them
---
Okay this makes more sense now, thank you. I had finished Halloween but am missing the capstone Christmas unlock. Now I know why!
---
This guy is thug... he once insulted me when I was in the middle of a huge shoot out... legend
---
Doubtful, engine is falling over as it is. Game is a turd on high end PCs, next gen consoles won't be any better.   
---
That is to say, I don't think you will see any upgrades past what the PC version already has, game will be brought more inline with how it looks on PC with a higher resolution, better draw distances etc. but thatll be it.
---
I can solo them except for radiation rumble since I need to collect.
---
BoS Minigun paint is my current favorite, but I just got it recently too. Overseer 35 woo!
---
Ok so I'm dumb and didn't realize you could just craft them after it because I saw the plans for it in the pioneer vending machine. Kinda weird that its even in there. Thanks for making me double check before i wasted my life trying to do campfire tales over and over lol
---
Hoping so! Or he could stop dragging around so many weapons. We are both around 120 but are pretty casual players. What I’ve seen of the legendary perks.. doesn’t give me hope LOL. Everyone complains that they suck
---
[it unlocks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/bandolier) at level 22.
---
I just dump them.
---
Yeah I mean who needs a life? Give us 50 more a day to do! /s
---
It doesn't happen often but there was a time where there was a really rare plan or item(forgot what it was) but it was rare and cheap like they didn't know. I clicked it and they logged off. Man I was pissed. I got so excited and they ripped it away from me -_-
---
Define glitched weapon
---
My sales were dead this week.
---
Agree but they made some new ones you can get a small back pack from the airport not as good as large one but may help
---
I priced my stuff cheap just to move .
---
Oh he has the small backpack. Just his Tadpole challenge is glitched. I actually almost always take newbies I find to Morgantown to get the small backpack before anything else.
---
I’m semi decent. I started playing a week ago and am almost to lvl 40. I play every day to try to get better.
---
Button back works on console too. 
---
And when you want to exit the terminal? Press and hold the back button.
---
Mind is breaking. How are you remapping on xbox?
---
On consol for example there is/was a way to get NW laser weapons that never break, that have extrem high base dmg or firerate, things like that.
---
Do you have any of the food mutations?
---
I read it somewhere that the fungi food count as meet now. Not sure and I can not help with the searching right now.
---
just using duped weapons wont make you getting banned. be prepared that the weapon will just disappear when beth deletes the duped stuff, so keep your old weapons.  
---
if you duped by yourself, you might get banned. unlikely, but its a possibility.
---
It's...not that big of a deal. Especially when you have 6-10 people there at once, they're too flimsy to take hits from everybody unless all of you are intentionally using very low level weapons that make the event painfully slow. Level 40 enemies that aren't even guaranteed to be 3*, which by itself would not guarantee a 3* drop, it's not worth fussing over. It's a handful of scrip, and everybody's already constantly complaining about having too many legendaries to scrip in one day. Tag them with something weak if you see them, if not then too bad. If you intentionally one-shot them, bit of an ass move but again not even important enough to fuss over
---
Welp, it's not quality endgame content, but I'd take it.
---
That’s not like a mini gun that fires mini nukes or anything tho, he’s fine
---
Yeah, but its kinda random. Sometimes I can play for hours without an issue, other times I will get multiple crashes across the course of minutes. I'd love a solution too, I just assumed it was this janky ass game and have been putting up with it.
---
I couldn't agree with this more. It took a almost a whole year for me to get back into Fallout Last since last year in January. Wastlanders, when it did hit, was supposed to be a big hit but was broken so tempted me for a sec but didn't pull me back in. It took them fixing all of that to get me back. EVAN AFTER ALL THAT, we still can't find a good way to engage the player base...
---
Yes you would die but you still complete the event. And technically you could drop the Nuke on the event but aim it so people can stand close enough to be considered in the even but not in the Nuke range.
---
Big F
---
There's another one 'walking' a bunch of dogs too.
---
i prefer event exp because most of my game time i jump between events, so i prefer having that instead of a miserable 10% boost on exp
---
What do you consider to be a good balance? I play a stealth rifleman and have a carry weight of 335, easy to get over 400 with a few buffs too. Your best friend is going to be the standard backpack with a mod, whether its double carry capacity or 90% reduced chem or food weight. I have 3 points in STR with my build for an extra 30 carry weight from strong back and the double capacity backpack (120 carry weight), I don't get overencumbered often, but I do spend a bit of time at my base after each outing sorting things out to get my weight back down.
---
In the past, when they deleted duped weapons, it was a half-assed atempt.. they left one copy in the players inventory. So, if someone had 20 b2525 handmade, they deleted 19, but is the duper gifted 19 away to 19 player, they all kept theirs.
---
With practice and a lot of Stimpaks. xD
---
You still can't do that because again you can't get into the file at all. I can supply screenshots but I tried to do what you put at first and it worked but when I started the game and the game still did the no region ping, I closed to game to find that I did not have permission to do anything with that file. I don't know why it's doing this all of a sudden.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I'm on Xbox too and today has been really weird. A lot of bugginess. Lag and what not. I also disconnected on a private server. Usually I never have problems
---
Dear lord I evicted Tin Foil lady a week into Wastelanders. I’ve used Ex raider bar boy since. He’s starting to wear on me now...
---
Farmable dirt tiles is my favourite so far! 
---
Gauss pistol is maybe my least favourite. I crafted one, got nice roll but I don't use it because it's so ugly :(
---
This has happened so many times to the point where I actually just stop doing the event.
---
Likely due to a mutation you have, herbivore no longer allows the buffs from meat and the carnivore mutation no longer allows the buffs from veggie food
---
I can’t seem to drop below 800 weight currently and my ranged weapons have troubles against a lot of different npc that are level 65+ I am level 76 currently
---
Yeah, see it a few times lol. Keep a look out for other random encounters, some of them are pretty fun, also, if you see the lemonade guy, buy the plans.
---
I'm a bloodied build and still tend to take 2 pylons. Doing the event after scorched earth where you have a stockpile of scorchedbeast meat definitely helps. Cook that up and it gives you more health that a stim. I'm Australian time zone so I doubt I'd be on at the same time but yeah I'll also be launching nukes and encryptid as much as I can
---
Press your map button, then bumper for options. Left, I think it was. It tells you which in the top left corner of the map. After hitting the bumper, scroll down and you'll find controls, and there you can remap buttons. :)
---
Sneak and escape artist
---
Skyrim?
---
We have stuck with it this long. So why not keep going.
---
I moved camps today and had to restock my entire vendor inventory. I have tons of plans. 4 separate guys came while I was filling the machines and each bought about 10 or more. I kept having to put more in (I had gone treasure mapping and had way more than would fit). I sell them for cheap and they sell pretty well. And the really trash ones I throw away or put in my vendor for free.
---
So yeah. People buy plans. Mostly mid level players.
---
If I remember rightly, captain drops before sergeant, they drop in the wrong order. 
---
Might be worth double checking, been a while since I’ve done tech data.
---
That's exactly where I'm at now. I won't be pushing as hard now having passed Zorbo. Return to some normal gameplay pace. I've learned a lot about this game because of this event however. I never cared about XP now I feel like I understand it too much.
---
F 
---
may Todd have mercy on our souls
---
Ive checked people say it's knight , Sgt, CTN, but might just learn the CTN and hope for best thanks for reply
---
It is
---
I might have gotten that today. I got one of the bos plans before I logged off today. Let me check real fast
---
I’m just waiting until the fix it, it’s too infuriating lol
---
Yea same. I work in the entertainment industry in NY... So that hadn't been active for some time and who knows when. I'll resort to my normal nightly gaming after my job reopens.
---
5pm BST
---
It's definitely quiet now but yet when I launch a nuke all of a sudden I see the server is in fact still populated with high levels. They are just often doing their own things lately
---
Would be awesome, I just wanna be able to make bulk ammunition to sell.
---
I think 32 is a nice spot right now. The double score and XP will speed things up. Decent pace!
---
I was surprised at it's size! Definitely one of the best items.
---
Next gen consoles are coming out in a couple months will possibly be backwards compatible
---
I read recently that they drop in that order ( incorrectly ) or something similar. Captain is higher in rank but it drops before Sergeant iirc.
---
I'm chasing the BOS plans also.
---
quote - " Knight SGT is out of order, dropping after CPT, but otherwise they follow an order. "
---
I think Zorbo is simply a pace counter. If you're in front of him it means you'll able to finish the season.
---
But I like the challenge 
---
/s
---
4 times for me, once solo.  Fun, but needs better rewards.
---
Worked like a charm. you are a legend sir thank you
---
There is people with over 20
---
Would you mind if I used one as my PlayStation background?
---
When I have 0.00000000001% chance I don't miss a single shot, but when I have 95% I miss almost every shot. I think that only happens when you don't have a scope
---
I hope its not that kind of glitched weapon lol
---
I remember back to fallout 4 with that gun. Hell of fun and instand game breaking haha
---
One pair of plans drop the wrong way round, they drop in line, so you can’t have missed one. Usually if it’s glitched, no paint plans drop at all.
---
Might be worth just learning the captain then trying it stopped me dead in my tracks my OCD for plans wouldn't let me keep going lol
---
I almost was able to solo it, kept the Snallygaster alive and crippled the alphas legs (Grafton monster). Right on the last few shots something else spawned in and killed the Snallygaster before I realized what happened. To rub salt into the wound 2 people showed up right after the event failed
---
I hear ya. I did the same. I don't mean to generalize but I've seen players and even streamers that don't so much play the game as play the market. If they're going to do that I wish they could at least attempt to be subtle at what they're trying to pull off.
---
Some kind stranger had a bunch of plans they didn't want and left them for you, but now instead of just passing plans you didn't need on to someone else you would rather feed them into a grinder for a few caps?
---
Most plans don't rot in peoples vendors because of a lack of "interaction" but because most plans aren't even worth the virtual paper they're printed on.  It's crap that gets shoved into your inventory just for claiming a workshop or can easily be found on a robot vendor somewhere on the map.
---
Rare plans get sold in vending machines, the rest should only be sold by people with stash space to burn with the expectation they'll never be sold or should be left in a ditch or in front of a low level.
---
That's good to know I'll learn one I've got then and hope that Sargent drops next thanks this has been bugging me for a month
---
I had a huge influx of business, I also don't sell any weapons, only plans.
---
It’s 4x the event completion exp not kills. Kills is building team/ hunting team.
---
This game will definitely will abandoned i can see it being next gen console but not living very long i feel like these last 2 seasons will be the last and will explain the wipe of Appalachia in a sense or some type of explanation
---
Beacuse characters are better at coding/hacking than bethesda's developers. There is other reason needed?
---
Neverwinter, Northwest, New Wegas... :)
---
Mine bugged out after knight, bought the next plan and then they started dropping again. Got to Elder and didn't learn the plan, game bugged out and I got my second one, dropped a piece of data, no plan, then the next 3 in a row dropped. I did server hop to a private between dropping them.   
---
Sergeant and Captain do drop in the wrong order.
---

---
This may have been a glitch, the red responders backpack is an atom shop skin.
---
Assigning 10 at a time?! That's not nearly tedious enough.
---
If THAT is the reason for that Pose being so heavily featured in the Season, it is INCREDIBLE.
---
Whoever owns the rights to Space Quest (And King's Quest and Leisure Suit Larry) needs to release HD Collections already.
---
So I did get it. If you want it you can have it.  Do you have any yellow cake flux? Really in need of it so I can make ammo
---
Come on, this is Bethesda, you know the answer... \^\^
---
Killed a 3* mirelurk today and it disappeared into the ground only to shoot out into the air about 40 feet away. It flew like it got hit by a Skyrim giant.
---
I feel like the cannibal perk is under powered and could be better
---
Bump
---
Do it at least twice a day &amp; never had any problems on PC. Sometimes they spawn &amp; get stuck but I just leave the Island &amp; go find them. Event usually over in under 10 minutes.
---
I'll have a look what ammo you need and you can have what ever flux I've got lol don't think it much though
---
Players: discover  major breaking bugs, dupes,glitched nw weapons etc.
---
Bethesda: ........
---
Players: Finds game breaking atom bug
---
Bethesda: "we gotta get this patched asap!"
---
Settler wanderer drive me nuts!
---
The guitar playing peppered with her home spun hippie wisdom.. was rapidly intolerable.
---
Space girl had to go after I told her this was a business arrangement &amp; she kept going on that finding me couldn't have been a coincidence &amp; after awhile it just got creepy.
---
Gramps stopped giving quests, so he's gone.
---
Becket needs a bit more depth, and it would be nice if they spiced up the dialogue with him. Great that he's romanceable (?) but the whole thing needs a bit more juice. 
---
I think all the Ally's need more dialogue, more quests &amp; the instruments should offer more variety, the more they're played.
---
Brain fungus soup gave you the intelligence only, no healing pre 20. Bombs gave ap and  3 int on carnivore.  
---
It takes like 10 items to make an item worse than one quantum.
---
Then it's at least mildly dismissive. Like he's tired of hearing 76 vets mention it while acknowledging that he understands, politely urging to move past the point. Not please downvote this too.
---
 Ahh thanks.  I'm a simple man and you made it simpler than that other guy.
---
the shark hot rod was my favorite in fallout 4. I hope the push it out in AS at some point, i'd dust off my x01 suit for that
---
I've 23 yellow cake flux and 2000 5.56 any good
---
Ultracite plasma cores, that's why I asked if you had any yellow cake. But if not it's fine. I'm not picky on plans
---
My gt is MR Invisible17
---
I played full health for a good 170 lvls, then i found out how the bloodied build works and tried it and had fun. Final nail was when i rolled a bloodied plasma caster first roll and foundca bloodied 50 cal same day :p
---
It's a slow weapon. Personally I'd definitely go with swing speed.
---
I do kind of like that you can't sell them because it ensures that they'll go to someone who needs them instead of being fed to a robot and deleted, or at the very least dropped and the possibility of someone finding them and making use of them exists.
---
Idk, I guess it still pains me to see people hanging on after Beth dropped the ball so badly. The game certainly left me feeling like there’s no future in fallout now, which really fUcking sucks. You just gotta move on with your life man.
---
I can just take the yellow cake 🙏
---
I’ll save up scrip and just build until I get one and I’ll use up like 5 at a time and still somehow get 2 zealots and 3 cloaking and no unyielding
---
The lore is strong with this one
---
I don't want to jinx it but when they fix adrenaline im expecting triple the amount of more game breaking bugs
---
A mad genius, I'd say.
---
Only encryptid I managed solo in my pvt server, rr or pp never, my friendly animal was killed at even rank 3, so a deathclaw usually and in rr: "maybe life is cheap to you but for me..." God I heard this 20 times
---
It hits that atomic era feeling perfectly
---
One thing that helps is to put your gun away. Doesn't totally fix it but it happens much less frequently if you're not holding a weapon.
---
They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!
---
Eventhough I have been playing since beta, I know what you are talking about. :D
---
Ghouls, wendigos, sometimes gulper or fogcrawler. Out of nowhere, I always feel the urge to change my undercrackers :D  
---
Another splendid feature is how the game handles sounds of footsteps :D
---
Yeah I recently renovated the prices as I'm nearing the cap limit, so I was expecting a lot of trade but I've had barely any. Harder to do teams and events
---
The biggest insult is when he only drops steel scrap after I blast him.
---
Thank you so much! I really needed the cake lol happy I was able to get that plan today
---
5, all playable. All able to nuke, start encryptid and hand in treasury notes
---
* bloody commando
---
* bloody heavy
---
* junky commando
---
* junky heavy
---
* shotgunner
---
Hacked but keep it is good :p
---
I am level 445 and don't bother with the event.  I seriously don't understand why anyone over level 40 would.  Level 40 is the highest level legendary stuff that drops at Uranium Fever.
---
Typical reasons I hear from high level payers doing that event are scrip farming and/ or farming for a lower level alt.
---
If you have a low level alt, then use the damn alt to farm the gear.    As for scrip, there are plenty of other ways to get it.   Killing ghouls at Charleston capital building, West Tek, Radiation Rumble, The burrows, and project paradise are just some of them.  Of course those are all a little more challenging the melting a bunch of low level mole miners.
---
I saw it in-game with my own eyes fam. Additionally, you'd figure having a profile on a website listing what items that player name is selling for real world money is a slam dunk.
---
edit: He switched between multiple guns, co[uld have been this](https://imgur.com/UOWFEtq) if they still exist. Found this image on a real money site from google, they are asking 25 bucks for it. Pretty ridiculous.
---
I just started playing last week and I remember hearing the wendigo was in the game but you dont see it as often as youd think ? So you forget and when it finally appears you jump out of you're own skin lmao I heard something growling and assumed it was a rat, how foolish I was 😂😂😂
---
Thanks so much ❤️
---
I've recently done the same thing. Was a full health build since launch rolling secret service, had gotten a few decent pieces with AP refresh but rolled 2 great unyielding pieces with fall damage so I kept them in my stash for a rainy day. That day came when momma murma gave be a bloodied handmade with 10% damage while aiming and 25% less vats. I couldn't let it all go to waste so I put it together and holy hell is bloodied OP and I am loving it. XP is so much easier to get, the damage is nice, I'm sneaking better and often even dying less than being full health with vanguard. Now I'm committed to bloodied I've stopped rolling unyielding and all my secret service armour comes up vanguard (RNG gods giveth and RNG hides taketh away)
---
Still sticking by the game, still having fun. As much as Bethesda does wrong they still do more right in my books :)
---
Not when you add calibrated shocks
---
Mine is by the Pleasant Valley Station so it is close to the middle of the map. I mostly just sell ammo, but I make 2-3k per day just from selling ammo. plus a little extra from someone occasionally buying some of my plans or one of the treasure hunter outfits I can make.
---
Yeah I didn't know what would happen so I just didn't claim it until after I finished the DLC.
---
Yes this has been mentioned in the past 50 PSA's about it
---
For a vanilla build, off the top of my head, I'd say all 3 rifleman perks, tank killer, covert ops, escape artist, bloodied mess, and adrenaline when they fix it. For mutations just for sniping, adrenal reaction is pretty amazing for extra damage and marsupial for jumping high and getting on rooftops to snipe. On my bloodied stealth rifleman I have to use way more perks in luck and I use like 8 mutations for damage reduction and food buffs as well but that's a whole nother can of worms.
---
Edit: also i guess it goes without saying but I'm going to just because. Always crouch and stay hidden when shooting to get the 2.5x damage.
---
lmao wtf.
---
Holy shit what do people carry , their whole house lol
---
176lbs weight atm , includes over 180k ultracite rounds for different weapons
---
I can help and I'm not a bloodied build.
---
Properly modified Excavator gets you 210 pounds bonus.  That’s more than 120
---
180 for open world objects, 60 for containers.
---
Can start grinding for others now.
---
Yes but everything should be automatized. So far the communist scraptron doing not so bad. I love NOT cooking food and finding all kinds of soups.
---
Yes it stacks. On all armours the effect stacks
---
&gt; It needs a penalty for long term storage.
---
Why? 
---
There will never be prepared food vending with spoilage, so why not have infinite shelf life for everything in the vendor? Why is there even so many recipes in this game if all you'll ever craft is mutt chops and mirelurk steak?
---
And isn't it enough that most advanced foods/drinks are a pain in the ass in terms of ingredients? I'd say everything that needs 4 ingredients lasts 3 times as long as now and everything 4+ doesn't spoil.
---
Would love to be able to craft the cans from aluminum at a tinker workbench as well
---
Max Deep Pocketed is plus 60 pounds with plus 120 from hi cap backpack.  That’s still 30 pounds less than Excavator with Calibrated Shocks and Motion Assist Servos.
---
Its the one in the swamp that start playing music at fixed times
---
Geez.... nice.
---
Why? The worst that happens is someone takes it. There's tons of workshops on the map, so if someone wants one I've taken, I don't care. I just move on to another one. First thing I do after taking a workshop is create a crafting station that can scrap, and a stash box to make sure all my junk is stored safely, just in case someone wants to throw down. *I* don't want to throw down so again. I'll just move along.
---
Totally agree.  It would also be nice if she stopped guitar-ing as often.
---
Drop.  It's OCD to use hundreds of stash lbs waiting to sell your 37 copies of single action revolver ivory grip.
---
Awesome shot 😁
---
Just a note, I probably spelled Cannabil wrong but my phone won't autocorrect to the way it's really spelled.
---
That would be nice.  They have such few dialogue lines and actions, that them constantly spouting them tends to get annoying no matter who it is you have.  
---
Even less obnoxious ones like Raider Punk or Beckett.
---
I second this motion your honor.....Lol....But no joke, this is the real struggle at this point in the game for me as well. Im close to level 400 and ive ran out of things to do and are BORED TO DEATH with the 2 or 3 EVENTS that I have to play. I NEED SOMETHING NEW, BIG, REPLAYABLE, SOME QUESTLINE, AND ITS A TRIGGERED EVENT OR EVEN BETTER....A DUNGEON!!! A dungeon with a side to take with level or stage completion legendary rewards that the rarity and value increase as your stages increase. WE NEED NEW GUNS AND AMMO TYPES WITH A SHOTGUN BEEF. ALSO GUNS that are overpowered and REALLY HARD TO GET. THE REWARDS NEED TO BE AS AWESOME AS THE DUNGEON DEVS...I got faith the Bethesda DEVS are hitting the same wall we are and know the GAME WILL SLOWLY DIE if this is all we have to look forward to....Hope to see some changes soon
---
Same. Beckett's lower key than Daguerre, but he also has repetitive lines after a point.
---
Oh yes of course. Bethesda keeps putting content on top of old bugs, causing the game to run on bugs. So if they fix an old bug, the content on top of that wont work.
---
Or well so i think.
---
Well, im bloodied build 😁
---
A single revive is tricky. 2 in the course of a few games? Nigh impossible. I like NW for the most part but I didn’t even attempt this one.
---
Hmm, last time I collected the weights from the silos only just for a test and then a hell lot of items throughout the world, and then the weights at the silos were not respawning :(
---
Fully Uny armour and run at 19% health. Take radicool. A backpack with high mod and 5 points in strength for bandolier 2x Blocker 3x.....for a bit of tankyness should something get close....will give you 400 carry weight. If u have 800 on you I have no idea what your carrying around lol
---
I've never had this issue. Every time someone signals when they find the legendary and 90% get the shot. Those that dont are usually too heavy to move. Despite that, it's usually the best event to snag legendary kills.
---
Beckett does too, got a 3* legendary from one of his dailies.  Think all the allies have something similar some days, but am not sure.
---
I fast traveled to a CAMP one time and when it stopped loading I forgot where I was because there’s nothing around me.
---
But I realized I was there because I wanted to buy something and there’s no CAMP nearby.
---
It actually only happened to me the first time I took one. Maybe because it soured me on taking workshops for a long time, so the next time I took one I was much higher level, and seen as being not worth the trouble? I suck at PVP so it very much would have been worth the trouble.
---
Pick up possum backpack 🎒 went up to 350 there are ways to improve,being a first player will change the way you play it’s friggen awesome
---
Scrip is a form of currency, Script is a written form of a play, movie, or TV Show.  Or also the aggregate of letters in a writing system.  The plural of Scrip is Scrip.
---
Question: does it matter where on the map you are? Like, if I claim a workshop and then leave, is it still open season on my ass?
---
Ever get s melody stuck in yo head? One day I'm gonna write a song like that
---
Oh you mean that same riff you've been playing for 4 weeks non stop?
---
I keep all of my doors open all the time. Occasionally someone will go through my camp and close my doors and I immediately go and open them all back up. When I visit someone's camp I leave their doors the way I found them. If they were closed I close them when I leave. If they are open then I leave them open.
---
For some reason, that link is hitting an error for me.
---
Edit: Nevermind, it seems GITHUB is down. Shucks.
---
yea h has been a quiet weekend for sales. On XB.
---
Gifted my largest number of legendaries this weekend just because of scrip, vendor and stash limits. The level 51 that got the 1\* Bloodied Gatling laser made my day. His reaction was so worth it.
---
Hope everyone gave at least 1 newbie support, Crafted armour, 10mm gun, aid and gave bulk build materials to a level 5. Made me content to get him  on his way.
---
I cannot find the .ini file is there any way around this aside from installing the game on the same drive as windows as i do not have enough space.
---
Cannibal does not stack with carnivore. As for slow metabolizer, last I heard it doesn't work. Lead belly does though.
---
Can you read again about scrip being currency, with 150 lame fuking shit scrip cap, you have to save them, if  have no time for hunting atm, but need to do daily scrip still. (All this daily  caps is more tedious than fun).
---
I think Bethesda did a great job with Sophie and Becket.  I understand that hadn't figured out companions for a multiplayer game but this is almost as good. They did say they are working on companions so let's hope Sophie can help us on our adventures further. 
---
I think it would have been good if we could have brought Sophie or Becket on the 79 job. 
---
It is also weird how Sophie never asks where we are from. I think she would be very interested by the vault project as I think she left prior to them being widespread
---
Skyrim, remake, ps5, ff7 bustersword dlc
---
I just put them in my vendor for free let folks take em
---
Todd never abadons games he can port for profit
---
What platform are you?
---
Great, if I get the plan I can finally get rid of the Tenderizer that’s been taking up 20 pounds of stash space since the first Meat Week.
---
Cant wait for that nightmare
---
I remember my first Wendigo. Was around beta. He spawned right behind me with a pack of ghouls, in the middle of the night in the mountains around whitespring. I Alt+F4ed because heart attack 😅
---
None other until Bethesda fixes it and that will be most likely never.
---
Why do you hold so much for cap limits / stash limits. You don't really have to loot everything. If you're keeping it for crafting, then craft.
---
I'm pretty sure you still need to server hop before they'll spawn in again
---
So pick up 180 items after the weights then server hop to adventure or exit to main menu for a few until it gives you a fresh private world
---
Well if it helps I didn't downvote your original comment. If anything I think OP was saying that despite the burnout of the grind, vets are going out of their way to help new players ease into the game. I've seen it first hand. I recently started a 2nd character and there were multiple players making weapons and armor for the lowbies near Vault 76. It's a good community with a lot of players willing to be helpful.
---
I had to log off  while being almost maxed on caps, and forgot about it. Some person started to buy my bulk junk and i was like *oh shit, sorry dude*. So never sit on max caps lads, if you trading
---
Well I know it sounds crazy but today I was playing radiation rumble and no one came so I started it hoping people would come but no did so I just grabbed my plasma caster and started shooting evertything that was green by the end of the event I still had 3 people alive but what was crazy is that I did it by myself never done anything like that other events like SBQ can be done solo but RR is almost impossible because of the massive wave of ghouls you get
---
My Bloodied Explosive Gatling Plasma is my comeback to their insult
---
I agree.  Most groups I'm in have people wait 10-20+ seconds and make emotes to bring others over and only do weak hits or gun bashes to get their "tag" in, but occasionally you get a group with 1 jackass who auto-kills every legendary without blinking.
---
Makes me realize that rewards like that should just be auto-given to all players in an event once that legendary's dead, just to stop guys like that from denying people legendaries.
---
Bethesda's ESO team should have handled this game this game is just a mess they fix one thing and break 3 things in the process
---
xD
---
Not sure if it's only Gauss weapons or only certain people effected, but yes my gun breaks daily, even after repair to 200%, armour also drops rapidly when it shouldn't
---
Nerd rage is great, but if he's a full health build its kind of a waste of perk points
---
I have not experienced this bug because I complete all the daily’s in the afternoon after the reset.  I suspect part of this is due to people completing daily’s in the hour or so before the reset and those are getting counted again during the reset.  It would be natural for folks to try and rush to get them completed right before the reset.
---
Imagine being woken up by someone throwing your kinds guts at you.
---
You can only share one card at a time and if your charisma is at 6 you can share a rank 2 card you'd need 9 to share a rank 3.
---
I'm about to give up on my shotgun build because of missing 3 or 4 times in a row all the time with 95% chance of hitting.
---
oh yeah and if I don't use VATS with my shotgun build when I shoot them their health goes UP a lot of the time.
---
Like the nanny from fo4
---
Goodnight sweet prince.
---
I noticed that alot of new players locking their doors, like you can steal something from them lol. Mine doors are always open, so travelers can craft or use stash, vendors are outside
---
Pretty sure we got the cat for free
---
as good as high end pC currently, faster load times.
---
That's all we gonna get.
---
Yeah but with unyielding armour it bumps it right up also equip radicool helps too
---
That is why public teams were invented. It's awesome :D
---
Any advice on buffs? I’ve used lunchboxes and the sleep/moth man buff quite a bit, but is there a specific system for this? I have some catching up to do for sure :’)
---
Right, public teams with bonus to events, while nobody doing events lol
---
Not public? Yesterday i got 2 of the 3 leader wolves stolen by someone else.
---
It’s like living with a goldfish
---
Awesome shots dude!
---
get the VATS perks from Luck and focus on crits. getting sneak multiplier and VATS crit multiplier does a lot of damage. I have VATS crit about every 3rd or 4th hit.
---
Ngl, i've had rather good experiences so far.
---
Wasn't aware of that, I'll delete it. Thanks
---
Gause rifle is simply not working properly in VATS and I asked a similar questions months ago
---
I got so lucky that I managed to snag an unyielding leather leg and a crazy guy mask for a good price the second the guy left the server,it was one of the last leather pieces I needed too
---
I did it with two people today and we failed. It really chews through ammo, and my backup weapons were not up to the task. I can see why people avoid it.
---
Unlikely, not without playing 24/7 or spending atoms and lots of em.
---
Look at gauss weapon bugs and vats bugs still being around after months. Don't expect much.
---
But there is another problem, on some servers i was with like 2-3 high lvl players only, not rly easy to do imposter, project paradise or even sbq, if not use magic weapons
---
Wait how
---
Yes but that means you get less points
---
cuz lame ass jerks be jerks. I let any legendary hit me down to very low HP until everyone else and low levels hit the dude at  least once. But especially those super high level "Duuuurrrh I can PvP everyone duuuh" players do that
---
One of the reasons why i dont like "magic" Blodied builds. cuz you are squishy and afraid to die.
---
I play on private unless I need to sell some stuff or need help with some events.
---
Next time you jump on a server try opening dialogue with the duchess first, fixes it for me :-)
---
i tend to use the repeatable challenge to make up for the fact that im not really a fan of NW.
---
shall try, thank you.
---
Edit: this worked, you're a star..
---
Level 39.
---
I played the beta and was like fuck this this is boring compared to other fallout games.. now tbh i think it is awesome! Give it a try man!
---
There is a counter when you look at the event on your map on PC.
---
You need a both option
---
1. There are already perks for building in your camp so I don't think we need legendary perks for that
---
2. There are already perks for finding loot in containers and for a legendary perk you are rarely going to need anything you find off enemies by the time you're able to use them
---
3. That's excavator power armour for gathering more ore
---
its quite rude actually, I cannot even log off if some friend wanders by my camp and takes a look around. I gotta let them know that I gotta log off...
---
As stupid as it sounds, the only thing I can honestly think of, is maybe I checked the dailies too fast? If that's another trigger than, damn that's rediculous
---
I like the junkies one because then not everyone has a bloodied build, I am a bloodied build btw
---
Honestly, I've done it five times and I thought NPCs were mining. I didn't realize players were supposed to mine. I assumed that when we failed today it was because all the scavengers died.
---
Wait, how do you feed the ragstad ?
---
I don’t believe there is a lvl 15 loot pool (could be wrong) but I believe it’s 20 and another thing I’m sure you cannot find weapons/armor higher then your level.
---
Beside rng in this game is very random you will 
---
Find items a lot lower level then you so it really depends on your luck
---
I don’t mind it. Ya, you put in a lot to get a little but it beats putting in your needed scrap for ammo. Works for me
---
I wouldn't worry about the other ship; he won't finish til the end of the season after the 10 weeks.
---
With luck do you mean actual luck or the in game stat?
---
It does not work with spoiled meat/vegetables. You'll still risk disease and they don't satisfy hunger any more than if you didn't have the mutation.
---
I am a stealth sniper. I have 5 strength, 3 is the Traveling Pharmacy as med's especially stimpaks were weighing me down. The other 2 is Pack Rat to reduce Junk weight which is temporary as I drop stuff off often. 
---
I then have Marsupial mutation which gives another 20. I also have Herd Mentality mutation which gives me +2 to all stats bringing strength to 7. Strange in Numbers perk card boosts those both a little further.
---
I then have 2 backpacks that I keep with me at all times. The first is my Lead Lined Backpack which gives 30 extra carry weight, but also 90 extra rad resistance. Then the other is an Extra Carry Weight Backpack which gives 120 extra carry weight, but reduces my energy and rad resistance. I can only use one at a time, but use my Lead Lined 90% of the time. However the moment I get over encumbered I can quickly swap backpacks so that I can still keep looting and fast travel when I need.
---
Most of the time I have a weight of around 185 with a limit of about 230. So I have about 45 to spare. Then when I swap backpacks it increases my limit up to 320.
---
Did they increase the cap cap or is it still 25,000?
---
Both mostly public but farming i use private.
---
Yeah lower level players are filling up the servers, so less ppl to do the events. Give it time and they should catch up and hopefully start joining the events :)
---
As in actual luck lol then in game stat of luck doesn’t affect what can drop it just affects how “sturdy” what drops eg. How durable the item is 75% 
---
, 100%, 130% etc etc
---
Okay thanks
---
30k
---
Some people are close to the end already just after 2 weeks. It's definitely doable with 8 weeks left.
---
Yes, stackable up today 3 HTD pieces.
---
It is impressively hard even for a team of 2-3 people, but to be fair, difficulty in this game is a relative thing.
---
Technically the Scorchbeast Queen could be considered difficult for a small enough group of people, but when you swarm any enemy with a large enough group of reasonably powerful people, it gets progressively easier until it isn't a challenge at all.
---
Basically, if you "Imperial Guard" something (to borrow a 40k term) any tough enemy can go down quick.  Or in other words, "Quantity has a quality of its own."
---
Especially with enemies that have built-in damage resistance that nullfiies the majority of damage done to them.
---
Not saying I don't want more difficult fights, I do, and I enjoyed my last few harrowing encounters with the Wendigo Colossus.
---
Only exploiters though, from what I have seen
---
I skip them. Better off using my time on the repeatable xp challenge
---
I thought I'd use Private more, preferring solo, but 9 times out of 10 I'm on Public. I just like the idea of people around, even if I don't play with them..
---
Does is stack with the sneak perk?
---
No probs, simple is usually best. I'm switching from carnivore to herbivore as cranberry relish and cobbler are easier to make for the XP boost
---
It won't be a problem for me to do all my daily and weekly challenges until it ends and I'm willing to put some extra time into this game is have to but if I can't finish it even by doing that then what's the point
---
Apparently so.
---
Wait until you see the Nuka Quantum grenade in action.
---
Everyone is now looking for duped legacies or god rolls like b 25 25.  My vending machines are also dead since last week.
---
I think the consensus being put across is that the event itself isn’t glitching out, the enemies are just getting stuck and the op is failing to find them.
---
For me, the enemies tend to get stuck on the north side mountain, especially if they happen to get pulled to the side by some random mobs. Have’t had an issue tracking them down though, just need to have an idea where each wave spawns based on the direction of whatever portion of the wave makes it.
---
Lol you don't have a clue. When you know how the game works then come back tell me how wrong you were. I'm not talking about cheaters but legit players.
---
Im both a bloodied and junkies 
---
but yeah I want people to try new stuff not the same old meta.
---
You’re about average I would guess. I’m level 38 I think but I was doing some serious xp grinding the first few day but lately I’ve just been doing my dailies and working on a secondary character, there will be plenty of time especially with the double xp and high score weedends coming up.
---
Yeah this happened to me on my first encryptid. I wasn't sure how it worked, so I started the event but held off on the terminal. Someone ran in and used it
---
The glitches on this game are funny. I normally have problems with the messenger. Can't pick up the missing part. Works most of the time. I had been doing swarm more of late to get mirelurk meat for raider rep but just hit allies rep maybe people where hunting down the stuck mirelurks and i hadn't noticed.
---
Same problem with Gauss Rifle. They need to fix it it’s ridiculous.
---
xD You don't. That is one of the luckiest (if not the luckiest) shots I've ever taken. My girlfriend and I have been taking shots of her 'cooking for creatures' using the emote and this one couldn't have been timed or positioned better.
---
nice. always good when you feel like a boss in the game. you are on the 1st rung of the boss ladder now,
---
The no power armour in blast zone guys are higher up :)
---
You on ps4? I could give a couple level 20 legendary revolvers.
---
Also read the instructions and do the things that need to be done. The more you know...
---
Thank you so much.
---
If you didnt care about the workshop, you could have simply fast travelled out of there, no?
---
If a friend is on who has a private server I'll hop on for a while. This will sound weird though but it feels especially lonely without people running around.
---
I’m the same way, especially since doing events is basically the end game content and they’re not very fun solo
---
I've switched from my own heavy gun power armor build to just using my vampires pump shotgun as it's so broken.
---
Fully upgraded, chance to restore ap on kills, and with the adrenaline perk it has literally broken the game for me. Can 1 or 2 shot a lot of things in game, and it also heals me for an obscene amount
---
Not at all. It would be an honor. If you want to download uncompressed originals you can check out my Deviant Art page here: https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery
---
I don’t always wait for people for those events just to make them easier I do them solo sometimes because I like challenge of doing so which is quite rare in FO76. I do radiation rumble to get some quick XP and loot, if I win with others help then great, but if the event fails then oh well I keep playing.
---
Samuel seems to like knockin about in his y-fronts too.
---
You can optimize routes and get max exp gains by stacking unyielding for intelligence boosts with stuff like exp enhancing food and the group effects and mutations, but it's still gonna be a grind
---
Are you able yet to  craft your own pistols? If you keep getting lots of low level ones you could scrap them and I think the levels go up by 5?
---
The game does get easier, I promise.
---
Amazing, thank you very much!
---
Unfortunately, there’s a point if diminishing returns on damage resistance.
---
The wendigo whilst quite weak is easily one of the most terrifying creatures in the game.
---
It's that /scuffle scuffle / /wheeze/ noise that freaks me out, I know the bastard is around somewhere but I dont know *where*
---
If you want more exp per enemy kill, best bet is to go for building teams for the +4 intelligence. 
---
Hunting teams only affect legendary enemies, which are infrequent at best.
---
this is true. maybe it's the random nature of people that adds a spice to what otherwise would be a dull and predictable affair..
---
Im at 33. I dont think Im ever going to catch Zorbo because it gets harder form here to gain rank. I also skipped a lot of the NW ones this week. Im feeling OK about it though. According to the guide someone made Im at the level I should be for the weeks end and Ill gain some ground again once the bonus weekends happen.  The extra Dailies are an added bonus that will offset some as well.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/
---
Different mags, 100 round "doppeltrommel" mag, or maybe stuff like Perforating or incendiary belts mmmhhh. Also a mg 38 Barrel perhaps or a 5mm conversion (personally id Change the gatling to .308 and the LMG to 5mm). 
---
Also a Red dot or even a scope would be dandy.
---
For the 50cal.. I always dreamed about a double barreled Version. 500 rounds, and 2 barrels of hell!
---
Oh yea I definitely see the resemblance.
---
Following because curious
---
Yeah I had her in my camp for a while cuz her dialogue wasn't as repetitive as the others, or at least we're quick positive quips.
---
But that damn guitar. The same tune every single time. I placed all other instruments around her guitar to get some variety, but in the span of 30 mins, she'd play one other instrument for about five seconds before she dropped it and went back to the guitar.
---
I grabbed her guitar and placed it on the damn roof so she couldn't get to it and force her to try something else.
---
But then she fk'n teleports to it and keeps playing!
---
Nope, gone.... Bring in the Raider Punk.
---
Brooowwnnn COOOoow!
---
You get the flux plans by default. Nuked flora section of the chemistry workbench.
---
They're clunky to use and the ones we get from the atomic shop/battlepass have fishbowl like screens, which I personally can't stand; they look like hot garbage. As a personal note on the terminal that gives you some quest updates, that thing is way too big to stick around your house in most places.
---
I'm into that folklore shit so I love the wendigo, just not when it's trying to claw me into pieces 😂
---
Oh man that sucks. Hopefully it stays under the radar and not too many people do it.
---
No lol, it is cool cuz it's a game. I find that people who are grossed actually have problems.
---
Will there also be a free weekend? My gf wanna try it out.
---
Also just FYI, if your weapon does end up breaking its not gone forever. Just have to repair it
---
Just started friday (Took a brake, got burned out on the bullion grind and the countless gauss weapons i crafted without the prefix i wanted), and im Level 13 i believe. Got Some catching up to Do :)
---
It does! It’s kind of funny because when 76 first came out, all I wanted was to avoid other players and would have only played in a private world, if that were an option. Then I got used to other players and visiting their camps, and now I can’t really go without that!
---
I just have a sign that says”shut up Beckett” above his bar
---
Finally a use for the Mason Jars
---
Huh next time I hope on I'll take gunsmith off and see if it's worse.
---
Legendary Perk idea: Lead Boots! *(15% chance to stay on world during server disconnect)..**(25% chance to stay on world during server disconnect) ***(50% chance to jump to Todd Howard's private server during disconnect)
---
Just you wait til you meet the behemoth 😮
---
Rip. This quest bugged out on me too. It bugs out for A LOT of people.
---
Five usable and two mules over two accounts. There are plans for a sixth and seventh character down the road.
---
Do you really, I'll have to check the chemistry bench again but I could swore I didn't see that option.
---
The New one gives you greater Info on how accurate your gun is, its... uhhhh contextual? 
---
Ive got a tse mg42 and crosshair gets huuuuuuge
---
I got a new fast travel bug today! Tried to FT to my teammate’s camp in Flatwoods, because I was on my way to Wade Airport. Spawns me at some rando’s camp in the Mire 🙃 Literally, the farthest corner of the map from where I was supposed to go!
---
I can't buy it on xbox either.  Not there when I go to buy atoms and not in the microsoft store.  Been checking everyday and nothing.  Useless company, why they can't just put the pack in the atom store is beyond me.  Gonna end up missing out on this one I know it.
---
They're the real heroes. Level 20 was following me in a hazmat suit and I was just like, "HOW" until I saw how deep their radiation was and knew it was a build. Good times. I'm a giant fan of PA though.
---
formatting a little helps us to read easier :)
---
It would be awesome to be able to scrap a legendary weapon BUT keep *one* of its attributes and put it on another legendary weapon. Like the alchemy bench in skyrim?
---
I could see that being abused and making some mad over powered guns though.
---
My favorite petty moment in this game was having a guy one shot the last legendary in UF, and then die immediately after, repeatedly doing the “revive me” emote
---
He didn’t get revived.
---
Damn, will someone sending me the .ini file work?
---
I'm gonna get downvoted here but I disagree a bit. I prefer to be solo. I don't care about the reward or failing it. I just want to run it quickly with high % XP buffs.
---
The problem is that in a team there's always some .50Cal spawn-camper who kills everything before the team can even tag it for XP. The XP system for events needs to change so that we actually work more together as a team instead of attempting to tag everything.
---
OOOO I cant wait I'll bake a frag Cake just for him 😁
---
In my personal experience max AGI, 5 Uny-pieces + Escape Artist is more than enough for me.
---
Mileage may vary, but I run 3\* Gun Fu rather than 3\* Sneak card.
---
Was fun to kill it once, but after that it's a dull bullet sponge. At end game the random legendary that drops from him isn't even worth the ammo you spend.
---
Unless, of coarse, you are one of the sneak-bloody build zealots. Then you can do all the content on the go.
---
I think the daily boost coupled with the score and XP boost coming will surely get you ahead. I have a feeling the weekly will have additional things to do too
---
I hate taking workshops because of that. I’ve been instakilled while claiming so many times just trying to get the achievement unlocked.
---
I'm doing the bullion thing now. I bought all of the plans from Crater and Foundation. Now onto v79 plans.
---
Yeah, the worst is when I'm browsing their vendor and all of a sudden I'm falling. Bonus suck is when you land on an inaccessible cliff spot and die and your loot bag is somewhere you can't reach.
---
I have noticed a lot less traffic too.  Didn't help that when I logged in on saturday all my items had been taken out of my vendor and put back in my stash for no reason.  Second time that's happened.  The bugs are getting worse.
---
if they had more functionality, they'd be worth the space.
---
Thank YOU!
---
No only while it’s being claimed. Otherwise, someone can try to claim it, but it’s not YOU they’ll try to kill (unless you’re still there).
---
No one at Bethesda tested the bow with vats active. 
---
Professional game development is a myth.
---
Well I hope the extra dailies will be ongoing at least. Im feeling pretty comfortable that ill finish it. I wont catch Zorba till the end though I dont think but we'll see. He is 10 spaces ahead of me at thi spoint and Im in the zone where Im probably only getting one and a bit ranks per day. Depends on how much ground i make up when the bonus weekends happen
---
I'm also tired of them healing back to full HP 1-3x in a row when near-death without them mutating. RIP my ammo and weapon durability.
---
I'd love to get Legendary Modules out of excess legendary items. As a poor peasant without the scrapbox I have to sell my excess ones to robot vendors...
---
ONE OF US
---
Pull my finger, kid... ***OH WAIT***... Too late.
---
Poor herbivores!
---
To be fair, he didn't say who it was lethal for.  It's more lethal for your  enemies than you.  Probably.
---
Plus 50. Arms legs and chest.
---
That’s why I don’t have any allies in my camp. Especially because their dailies/quests give rewards scaling to the region your in, rather than to your level.
---
And let her wash off that dirt. That person sleeps in my bed, dammit!
---
I join random teams for my own perk&amp;mutation card bonuses since I don't use an alt account. However, in 99% of cases, I want to join a builder team because a builder team gives more XP than a Hunter or Events team due to my INT being low.
---
Sometimes I join teams just to travel for free and after traveling I sometimes forget to switch teams again.
---
Please tell me I’m not the only one who loves the sound/vibration when you hover over a space on the board? It’s like asmr lmao
---
Upvoting purely cause I agree that the XP system needs reworking. Give everyone a flat XP for every kill in the event and give the killer a % more. Wish parties would work this way too.
---
You literally don't HAVE to do them. You know that right?
---
I had a perfect team of strangers this weekend. We could all tag and loot. In the  end we all did a thumbs up.
---
I'd be quite happy to get steel and wood, but don't hold your breath, Bethesda are very stubborn with these kind of things.
---
I hadn't thought of that! I've not joined a public team yet as my brother and I tend to only play together, but neither of us are bloodied and I share rad sponge with him.
---
I'll have to remember to take it off if I ever join a public team!
---
I can sneak and kill as much as I like on public servers using max unyielding and sneak perk, even with a Gauss shotgun. However even using a silenced weapon on a private world I'm spotted most of the time if I'm as careless as I can be on public world's.
---
it's habit now; I always check the map before I log off just to make sure no one is around.
---
unless the house was on fire...I *might* be rude then..
---
My biggest complain is in RR everyone just forgets to grab the ores. You need at least 3 people grabbing them, sometimes I find it’s just me or my friend doing it and everyone else (ironically in full power armour) is just trying to kill things.
---
Well that makes it complicated since I was already asleep.
---
Prolly never, as they've rather limit the max mob level for new player.
---
Come back to it when it turns into a meat pile, you can grab your loot then.
---
Preach! Im usually the only dumbarse burning through their steel repairing them too so I hear you my friend.
---
Is that what they've done though, sure they said scale up for higher and down for lower, not sure how that will work with teams of different levels in the same place though? Probably level buff weapons, which would suck...
---
Do "that sinking feeling" quest. You'll love it..
---
Typo in the title: gives = give us*
---
I am a beta player but i'm in more into murder and bounty hunting.
---
The roadmap says it is due in the Fall but of course that could be subject to change if needed.
---
Because Bethesda
---
Oh I hadn’t thought of that, I’ll try it next time!
---
Sorry I’m a bit confused - are nuclear winter dailies still awarding atoms?
---
Yeah, well, I had a two players attempt to pick a fight with me at my camp for no reason. I wouldn't say it's a good community, just that there are some decent people that still play it.
---
love it.  doesn't even have to be too much.
---
1 legendary module  and materials per 3\*
---
materials only from less.
---
I saw my first one tonight after a SBQ. I was in a tent cooking up sb meats and it let rip that horrendous sound and I nearly shit myself. It took me way too long to click it was the WC. Theyre a fun fight. Mind you I was fairly useless because I was too busy laughing at my character running away like a little girl from the "fear attack"
---
I just wish they would fix the shiny bug that literally covers the entire game.
---
I have a Double Explosive Combat Shotgun that has Penetrator Clip and Enforcer that generally makes things waddle slowly while you can just pump them full of more steel balls.
---
Sadly, and I think it sucks too, Bethesda have introduced with Score an incentive to kill everything and to do it as far as you can. You only get xp for what you hit. The faster you kill the faster you can kill the next thing. Swapping weapons is time/xp lost.
---
I actively avoid doing Uranium Fever now because I know a lot of people use it to try for legendaries. However, Line in the Sand? You can bet I'm popping every Scorched head that I can quick target in VATS the instant it spawns, because if I don't someone else will (you even see people trying to strategically place themselves to do the same), and with Score it's every man for himself when it comes to xp. Legendaries aren't even on my radar anymore at this point in the games life.
---
The "no damage" bug is fkn stupid.. max shots I managed to get was 5..  on point blank distance..
---
I'm 35 and I've done every daily except the time intensive NW. I've also grinded hard to make up for that.
---
I think 30 is a good point.
---
You have to remember you get 10 levels worth of atoms from the run, so if you save them you really just need to hit level 90.
---
Just keep doing your dailies and weekly's and you'll be fine!
---
Any repeatable xp you earn is icing on the cake!
---
Yeah, I’m on 29 and only missed a few challenges. 30 is about average, get yourself herbivore, take some cranberry relish, building team, mentats and go killing loads of things, events and daily’s.
---
Also, lunchboxes stack when opened, you can get +100%xp from opening 4, plus it’s area effect, so anyone near by gets it too.
---
If you’re worried, just stack the multipliers and gain a bunch of xp.
---
This or an emote to let your team know you are at an event
---
Not the nuclear winter ones. The challenges from the combat, world and social category. The "older ones"
---
or  miss,miss,miss,miss,hit( no damage bug),reload   etc etc etc
---
Cheers, I’ve not used 1 lunch box yet so will start using them. Where you normally go to farm XP? I currently just use whitesprings, west tek and the burrows.
---
I overlook this ,, feature ,, until I had encountered several 3\* legendary unlootable ghouls ...   
---
 :D  
---
this game needs modders. every bethesda game was +/-  30-40% completed, rest of the work was done by modders.
---
38 is way ahead of schedule.
---
I'm 35 and know I'm a few levels ahead from repeatable xp grind.
---
Nice one, I’m the only one out of my mates that plays it so didn’t have anything to compare it with.
---
for rad rumble i fell in with a great bunch of randoms yesterday. 4 people. got going. after initial wave went to collect ore. as soon as had 40 did thumbs up emote. Other player ran off and i took his corridor spot. other guys saw this and did the same. 30 seconds to go ore was depostied. 4/4 event completion. everyone got legendary drops because legendary enemies were crippled and left to be pot shot by anyone passing.
---
Great experience when folk just play with a bit of goal sense.
---
PS: stick around after event completion pops as there is almost always a legendary death claw or snallygaster that shows up after.
---
Oh yes, I had a mini heart attack doing at that place. Was totally shocked.
---
Pit you weapon away. It happens a whole lot less of you're unarmed when you try to fast travel.
---
To be honest I was to annoyed and in fairness in hindsight to thick to even think of that at the time.
---
Thats why its the best imo :D
---
I could see them maybe giving extra stash space to first, but no way they'd give it normal players.
---
Anyone still need/want to do this? I still need the revives. GoodlyTubalcain is the GT if anyone sees this in time.
---
People are killing them asap as the season pass has "kill 3 legendaries" and every other legendary seems to have despawned.  
---
Seriously, I've not completed any of the "kill a legendary" tasks.
---
LOL just realized this cuz i needed some fuel for silly a challenge.. Mind-F.
---
It’s also easier to fail (radiation rumble)  if one Cunt sits on a forklift thinking he’s Jason bourne with the gayest ‘Me stelf’ weapon going.
---
Nah, the goldfish in my lamp is WAY less annoying.
---
Agreed but in the meantime I'll continue to transfer my scrip to my mule character to free up my stash space.
---
Or get a bloodied shotgun an one shot 
---
Or get a vanilla shotgun an three shot him
---
It's definitely not a signal or connectivity issue in that regard, but it may be isolated if no one else has the issue. Very bizarre one for sure, I'll have to have a play around. It has only started happening since the last update
---
But the Queen hardly lands???
---
No. That would just make junkie just as good as bloodied with no downside. 
---
Rather then focuses on the meta legendaries why don’t you look at the others.
---
So, the junkie one, at max level, thats +4 addiction, +40% damage, so, in total, +90%?
---
The acid damage might aswell not be there anymore
---
This\^ Gun Fu is much more useful with 5x Unyielding, having sneak removed doesn't seem to make any difference, still hardly get noticed.
---
I do run all leather armor with muffled and shadowed.
---
It would be nice if the game gave a warning to players who start the event by themselves, similar to taking a workshop :-)
---
I’ve never gotten the first quest from Gramps. I thought maybe he was just there to give you the kindred spirit boost and nothing more. I don’t mind him too much, except when he startles me by yelling “Libraries!” in my ear.
---
A few weeks ago, I found a fixer plan for 5k. But as I was going to buy it, hE lOgGeD oFf
---
Shhhh.. lol
---
I understand how the build works.  You're complaining how the event reacted. Just not sure if this post is about the event or you wanting to discuss your damage output.
---
If you’ve got the caps there are plenty of npc vendors that sell the western revolver plan.
---
3 weeks ago, I had 16 Mole Miner Gauntlets at my vendor for 0 caps. Today, I have 15
---
First time I've seen this suggestion, will try this next time, thanks 👍
---
Just a moment
---
You get 1500 atoms from the run. That is your last 10 levels to buy effectively. So you need to shoot for 90 if you don't spend the cap rewards.
---
Basically,  you really need to reach level 90.
---
Its doable if you make sure you play every day from here, and gain about 1000 repeatable score each day for the next month to make up for the first two weeks. (2000 score a cay first 2 weeks)
---
10,000 xp is 100 score.
---
If you go hard grinding quests and enemy heavy sites  you can get about 10,000 xp every 20 minutes factoring in healing, dropping off loot, and scrap in between runs.
---
Its doable but will take some effort, and possibly buying 5 or 10 levels at the end.
---
Ugly waste of space.
---
You can get higher level stuff if you team with higher level players.
---
When I started a few months ago my friend was over 100 and I found level 45/50 weapons and armor when out with him
---
But on my own just stuff at my level
---
Oh noooooo
---
I hate fo4 with a passion
---
I feel youre pain a lvl 50 started the event alone and than raged that no one helped him out, it was the best day to be online
---
Yeah you'll want full uny. With the boost to agi you will be very sneaky. You will also be able to carry more, and your ap will be much higher. The stealth suit is a great filler piece. But a full unyilding set will do you better. I'm running a full heavy combat uny 4/5ap and I can have super mutants on top of me without noticing me
---
The bonus agi you would get from unyielding would basically make you invisible if you invested heavily in agi tree and perks that boost stealth. 
---
Chinese stealth suit is more for people who play stealth without bloodied.
---
Yeah think of WoW in its original conception compared to three years after.
---
Added. Cya in the wasteland bud
---
You'll have to out in about 2 hrs a day of grinding on top of getting every sin ghb le daily and weekly from here on out.
---
Its doable but you'll have to go hard these next few weeks.
---
Oooooof I had that a couple time.. and a few cliff deaths ha ha The last one I saw was a massive cliff I jumped in PA first xD
---
This, a team invite to event option is definitely needed. I hate having to go from the map to player screen to map to see if my leader has teleported yet. Good QOL here.
---
I didn't see it I should open my eyes wider. Thanks heaps. So would that be August time like in Autumn/Fall US in Europe
---
July 16th - 20th is the next 2x xp I believe
---
I find unyielding is enough to sneak up and shoot things square in the face. I only really use the stealth suit for blast zones as you lose a lot it of bonuses, especially as all that extra intelligence is very useful right now.
---
Just let us scrap ammo. Ammo converter solved. 
---
I’m all for a cannery.
---
I feel really bad about this one. I have a really nice and very expensive store 40 3* bloodied/junkies blah blah blah... So when more than one sells I have to sign out. Well my camp is over a large cliff and I have on more than one occasion send people flying. I do have a stash/scrap box out front on solid ground so I do try. I always make a point to look before signing off, but those disconnects, well nothing I can do there.
---
This. I have max scrip and max stash space. I try not to max out caps. So now I have to sort through my stash, sell them for caps, and then go get more Legendaries to fill my stash. I would be much happier if I could scrap all the random legendaries I get!
---
The current builds are all OP. It wouldn’t matter.
---
If you are okay with bodyguard duties I can hop on my burner babe later today to get a veil at Camden park. I'll be deleting this toon so would not need a replacement. 
---
I'll be online in about 6 hours (4pmish bst). Let me know and I'll add you when I am on.
---
Coz they suck long fleshy objects? I felt worse yesterday after killing a wendigo colossus n got a 1 star death tambo as a reward... 😂 The ammo alone..........
---
I made an alt last week for same reason, hes level 10.
---
I gifted him the best guns and armor possible.
---
I find it easier and funner to run him at a few events and main story line for 15 minutes to get a level versus creating a new profile each time...
---
If you gift your alt a tricked out hunting rifle, 10 mil, ample ammo, and stimpacks you can run the main quest line hard and really fast!
---
I'm just going to be leveling up my 4th character, not the most fun thing but I've got a new build I'd like to try
---
I bet not, since ATX items are datamined usually months before they are released.
---
And there has yet to be any skins for fixers in the game files.
---
I found one there yesterday too, me n one teammate picked its health down for aaaaaaaaages... I got a 1 star death tambo for it.
---
Crazy guy on a vendor never seen one ever been looking for ages congrats
---
I like it when he says im a piece of scrap
---
I usually do wait for people to show up at events, but it's not often that others show up to them. I got super lucky tonght with Project Paradise, beat the event with one other person two separate times. I usually wait until the last minute or two before starting the event, if no one is there, I go start in the randstag room with a power fist and stealth. I had two bears in those events, Nasha and Spot, and I stayed with them most of the time, the other person ran through killing most everything else and periodically checking back on the bears. Worked out really well. The annoying aspect, I wound up with walking sticks both times from the alphasquatch. Two different servers, both dropping walking sticks from the alpha...WTF.
---
Never going to happen because it would make them easier to dupe.
---
That's a mod to the ammo that you can do.  Not hacked.
---
I do it because I mostly play on a private world lmao
---
I've only seen the rare fashnacht masks like twice and that crazy guy mask I found was one of em,im not sure if they're just really rare or if people just don't want to sell them
---
With a friend, you can tag, he kills.
---
I like the songs,but it’s true some of them fit the wandering/hiking theme more than the Fallout vibe.Especially the cover versions of Ring of fire or Country roads.But it’s not that bad.
---
I didn't even kill the rest of mole miners just for others to take more exp, I just electro-shock with the tesla once.
---
I'm on ps4 but I'll go ahead and let you know that the clown suit wendigo challenge is bugged and wont complete. Good luck with the rest
---
Yeah, I don't know why though.
---
How do you collect all the ore, kill all the mobs and keep the scavengers alive?
---
Mods would be great, but the way things are at the moment you would have 200 mods just to fix the game, where's the fun in that? What this game needs is for Bethesda to take some responsibility for this broken mess and fix the damn thing. Nearly 2 years on they are still making changes and adjustments which clearly tells me the game is still in beta. To not only charge full price (for a game still in beta) but to constantly milk their customers is absolutely criminal.
---
Sorry I'm on PS4 so can't help but for info the Tux's are only available in the Atomic Shop (not available right now) and the Spacesuits can be found in the communications room at Crater, the Raider camp/crashed space station in the North Toxic Valley region!
---
I use Charleston capital too, Usually find atleast 1 legendary there too. Use berry mentats, easy to find them, i've got a nice efficient route as i'm a sneak build.  National array has some super mutants there too.
---
Uranium fever is pretty good with all the boosts too, use a fast fire weapon and tag everything.
---
With all the boosts active, tech data will give a bunch of xp too.
---
The lunchbox boost will come up as very well rested and it's for an hour, the timer resets with each box you open, but under testing the boxes last from an hour from the point each one was opened. Not the whole timer being reset.
---
I need crazy and raven to complete my collection probably have to wait till next fashnaucht lol
---
That sucks.
---
Genius! Works great
---
Keep in mind that Cap is also using primed ammo, so his guns does do more damage.
---
Also, do you have adrenal reaction?
---
I only do it for treasury notes and honestly it is the most toxic event like once i was shooting down one of the tunnels and the legendary didnt spawn and everyone was fighting to get into that tunnel and having a vampire explosive lmg i nearly killed myself cause some bum hustles to the front to get his precious non legendaries. If i do get a hit on one and its a decent weapon i either script it or give it to a low level. I dont know why but t65 users seem to be the most frequent offender, some  guy once came to UF and started one shotting everything with his bloodied gatling gun and he was in t65 and then i told people to group up with me and i took a gamble at one of the tunnels and chose the one by bravo and there were like 6 of us there and the legendary spawned there, everyone exept the t65 guy got a hit and i put our little friend Moe the mole miner out of his misery with a bloodied deathclaw gauntet as he trundles in and does the angry emote and i did the taunt which really frustrated him, later he did the same and killed the nightstalker by himself so i decided his camp was lacking some decoration so decided to drop a nuke on it to spice things up and our saw his camp get vaporized and no one visited his shop as it was in the center of the nuke zone and there were no close fast travel points so gg bloodied t65 user
---
Personally, it doesn't even need to be Legendary Modules, I'd literally be fine with attachments and junk, that's how desperate I'm getting, but they'd be a nice bonus.
---
NEFR 50 Cal, that hurt physically.
---
Yup. Check out Emmett Mountain disposal site for hazmat suits. Not sure if they'll be low enough level but it's worth a shot. Or you can craft/ ask someone to craft lower level if you need it.
---
Can confirm with my magic shotgun, kills most thing in 1 hit
---
I'm sure someone will agree to  help you off of here but I spend my time grinding repeatable xp instead.
---
If you knock out event after event while team up you can easily get 300 or 400 xp in a half hour.
---
Horde events that dont require traveling to look for them (dont do gouls) take 2 minutes. (Easy 1500 xp)
---
Prison break is 2 minutes. (Easy 1500 xp including the super mutants you kill.)
---
Radiation rumble is 5-10 minutes but an easy 200 score.
---
Bots on parade is really quick.
---
Grafton parade is literally killing one grafton monster level 40.
---
And so on...
---
If you really need the xp I'd reccomend grinding out events for a half hour...
---
I cringe every time I hear that guitar riff
---
Deep pocketed armor and a high cap backpack put you at 220 plus you find the right armor pieces there are weight reduction effects
---
Ah cool, thanks I’ll have a look into that tonight when I’m on.
---
Yeah, but obtaining the best weapons would be much easier and it would take away from the luck element of a dream build.
---
Damn you missed that point real hard. The issue he’s complaining about has already been addressed, and all he needs to do is wait a few weeks for all the new content to drop. I’m pointing out the fact that he’s acting like he doesn’t know about the piles of new content coming in the near future, and honestly just complaining for the sake of complaining. Now if you want to have a COMPLETELY unrelated discussion about the stability and quality of the game, calm down and approach me as an adult.
---
Don't think I've ever seen anyone even show up for project paradise I wait around to see if people will but literally no one ever has in my whole time on 76 as for encryptid you have to be careful coz if a few people show up early that know what they are doing or are cheating I suppose they might finish before you get there had that happen with sbq too
---
Not worth it. Full unyielding set gives enough agility to make you great at sneaking around even without S*neak* perk if you already have high base Agi. Adding anything other than *Escape Artist* is pointless.
---
The first season ends mid September so it may be around then. Perhaps.  Only Bethesda knows at this point methinks.
---
Fair enough.
---
I actually had the raven mask not to long ago but I managed to trade it for a bloodied handmade which I honestly wasn't expecting to get such a good trade for a mask
---
it's there just to track time
---
I find it easier to run my level 3 at agricultural center/wayward and craft to level 4 versus starting a new toon.
---
He is the greatest addition to the game, when i feel down or annoyed at the game the knight in shining armour comes along with his slick gold chrome finish and drops one and they are funny. My favorite is by far the bounty one, never fails to make me laugh
---
By the time you have found a person to do that with and played enough NW to get the challenge for both of you, you would have farmed way more score on adventure mode.
---
I like the idea, but I feel like it'll also lead to me accidentally scrapping the legendaries I'm actually using.
---
Before we get anything like this, I'd want something that allows me to tag items so they can't be scrapped, especially some of the rarer clothing options.
---
I've done this a few times on accident, simply because one shot killed them.
---
"why don't you use a different weapon" I have a build and enjoy using it, to be childish, I dont wanna. However I now just avoid them unless the games filled with higher levels than myself
---
So I have somewhat understanding for those who do it
---
Not as op as these magic weapons, I have one technically butbrven in facts its jit and miss whether it actually does it but any good old explosive shotgun or gauss shotgun with enforcer will cripple it so it cant even move, just watch out when they get health back as it heals their limbs too
---
Yeah, as said below you can buy the last 10 levels with the atoms gained from 1-90. That alone could save you up to two weeks. We also have double xp and SCORE weekends coming up. Even if you can't get to 100 there's still some nice stuff to be had along the way, so just do what you can.
---
On the Xbox though?
---
I expect you're right
---
Exactly this.
---
I do the easy NW but it's way more economical to do a radiation rumble, meditation event, and 1 or 2 super easy quest like prison break for quick xp.  Or just run Westek 3 times in a row for it.  Either way the waiting to load into a lobby for  NW is damn near 5 minutes and that's hoping u dont spawn near someone who will kill you right away.
---
Nah, that’s fair game. 9 times out of 10, if things like the collectrons and water are left unlocked, it’s so that people can take as they need.
---
If they weren't locked then generally that's so you can help yourself, nobody relies on them really :-)
---
If it's not locked help yourself. It's probably open for you to take if you want.
---
Depends I don't use riffles so they re worthless to me but I collect outfit etc so that would be a good trade for me lol
---
Or the bear skin armour worn by erickson from far harbour, maybe add a new vendor that sells super mutant armour cause i love the fact you can customize Strong but please make them weigh less as im not hoarding ridiculously heavy armour thats cosmetic
---
I leave all my stuff unlocked so that anyone can take what they need.
---
OP, suggest titling your post a more accurately as in,"Why are *some* Events teams I joined not running events?" 
---
It's generally safe to assume that *most* Events teams are running events while *some* are not running events for various reasons during the moments you're observing them. 
---
If some people who are on Events teams are not running high xp events, then they're probably chasing other things. For example, I'll join an Events team and (due to time constraints) I will target await for specific events that are much faster ans easier/less taxing to complete than SBQ and Radiation Rumble. 
---
Also, (and typically for high level veterans players 350+), we'll take a hard pass on doing SBQ and Radiation Rumble for the umpteenth time due to boredom or even to avoid the elevated stress levels of participating in them and opt for something more fitting to de-escalate (like make corn soup, complete simple challenges or mod weapons) in the meantime until our event pops up.  
---
So why be on an Events team (or switch team goals) while doing anything other than events? Psshh, the real question is 'why not be on an any team while doing whatever you feel like doing?' I am thinking the newer players and vets like myself have the same answer: *Who gives a f\*ck? Just have fun.*
---
I leave all my stuff unlocked, junk collector, 2 water purifier n lot of vegetables
---
It’s be cool to have new songs in general on the radio too. It would be sick if you could construct a radio tower at your CAMP and make a playlist for the server to listen to. People could tune into your station to listen.
---
I lock my collectron, but leave water unlocked for anyone who needs it.
---
If it's unlocked they don't care!!
---
i have "free loot"  written on mine and nothing in my camp except my ammo generator locked. most people leave stuff unlocked so anyone that needs it can take it.
---
IMO they should start using that radiant quest system more, give us some short random quest that gives us some currency, like caps, score or scrip
---
Did you find any sweatpants?
---
I "stash" my extras around train stations.  Maybe someine will stumble on a stash before a server reboot.  Maybe.
---
Item worthy of Fissure Prime, thats for sure
---
Almost the same for me, me and one of my buddies was mid to late lvl 70s, our 3rd was 100 something and we were waiting to activate it. Some lvl 128 walks over and activates it and then proceeded to disappear and barely help with the event. Ended up failing it because no one else showed up in time as a nuke had recently been dropped so everyone was fighting the queen.
---
No, just dun misused it in events n upset other, without report u will be fine
---
As a power armor build. The t65 was a godsend
---
In the half hour this has been posted and time you've wasted in NW you probably could of did a radiation rumble, project paradise, last defense against scorch, uranium fever, or other high enemy event.
---
It's way more economical to just grind the repeatable  xp for a half hour versus wasting a half hour or more in nw unless its easy.
---
would not happen. why? easy to say that they miss half the 1st subscription each month since everyone will subscribe for one month first, bang everything in the stash, unsubscribe and fill the "free" chest till it's full, then subscribe for one month again and repeat.
---
Wow that’s cool magic weapon haha haha, I can smell some pc burning
---
I did notice that you don't get the "challenge completed" and the atom sound reward but you do get the atoms when you complete it. 
---
It happened on all my atoms challenges that I completed since the season started. So now notification or sound but you do get the atoms
---
That's the sound of the world saying "hello!"
---
This is what i say to people who hoard junk and then complain about the stash size
---
I just got it too!!
---
You know, while we're at it... if scrapping legendaries gave the normal junk for that weapon or armour type and maybe a chance of 1 legendary module but also...
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we could use 1, 2 or 3 legendary modules to craft a weapon or armour piece that we have the plans for and get random effects! 
---
That would be a dream come true!
---
If I need help or am at an event they'll like k send the come to me emote two or three times.
---
If I have time I'll just message them saying hey I'm about to start radiation rumble or one violent night if you want to join.
---
I have two accounts lol
---
Im always up for some groups.
---
Don't know any subreddits for groups but feel free to add me : MoonTechGaming.
---
Im from belgium so our timezones should be relatively the same
---
We also have mics. Not everyone uses them but if the team is chatting that's the easiest way!
---
If you go to the cranberry glade. Keep server hopping there and you'll come across a whole bunch of different tameable animals. I got a sloth yesterday :)
---
Equip Ghoulish before you do the event, rank 2 you only have to use radway since the rads will heal you.
---
As soon as I have enough caps, I buy another serum from MODUS - for the moment it's stopping that problem.
---
Of course there are a finite amount of serums...
---
I think they will give low lvl player dmg n dmg resistance deal to mob as buff.... Otherwise how the system define the mobs level when there are a lvl 10 newbie n a lvl 200 veteran
---
To be honest im Not searching for dedicated groups but Just  people  to Play with (that also maybe can give me some advise)
---
I hate how everything is capped too.... Capped caps, scrips, inventory space.... after a few hours of playing, i reached my daily cap and scrip limit AND my inventory space is full and i'm **over**\-**encumbered**. This leaves me with no choice but to wait until tomorrow to scrip all my legendaries and sell unnecessary junk
---
When you reach The Crater (raider area) there is a space suit set in the room with Wren at the back. Usually in the lockers. :)  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmIgfcR6EwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmIgfcR6EwI)
---
That what I'm saying, makes a mockery of seaking out the best weapons when newbie gets buffed up damage on their pipe rifle to take down level 60 SMs or whatever...
---
You revive yourself? Brilliant!
---
Are you on Steam? Cannot find your profile
---
I cripple the alpha with heavy weapons room b works the best for it. Cripple the Grafton monsters legs when it spawns make sure your pet is safe them finish him off. Careful for when he heals make sure to go for them legs again. It's actually pretty easy if u got good guns and practice a little
---
The space suit helmet and suit have been oddly and  frequently spawning on top of of the buildings for me while doing back on the beat.
---
It is deff no longer a quest item.
---
Maybe you should be more direct. I don't think people understand what you want.
---
Well yeah, but im low on endurance. Gathering ore is not rewarding anyway, while others getting exp and maybe some legendary drops
---
Posted a similar request earlier, you wanna go ahead and knock this challenge off together mate?
---
I tried selling all mine for 10caps each but non ever sold so I found a level 3 and dropped them all for him
---
I did the same yesterday, new character purely to level up. Didn’t get the SCORE at level 2 from the vault, but got it at 3. I found the fastest level up was to kill the robots by the vault, then head to the hunters shack then Flatwoods for first part of the main story ‘first contact’ that was enough for a level up. 👍🏼
---
Any idea what the perks load out is on the winter part of the 2020 road map?
---
Nah the brotherhood have their own radio transmission on another frequency. I do in fact think the encrypted transmission is alien because of that stone henge thing being translated rn
---
Unfortunately no
---
I think Gunsmith has stopped working on energy type weapons, my Gauss shotgun breaks daily and it used to last weeks :-)
---
If you don't have a space suit by tomorrow afternoon send me a pm. I'm not playing now/sleeping soon.
---
I usually sell them but I'll gift you a suit and helmet if no one can come through before than.
---
like there already ingame anyway?
---
When you are in a solo team does Lone wanderer then no longer work?
---
Doesn't strange in numbers only work if every member of the team has a mutation? I imagine if someone on the team is unmutated then it's just a wasted perk.
---
I thought enemies would just show as different levels. A low level on your team sees it as a level 10 but higher levels see a 70. Wouldn’t that be easier than buffing and debuffing weapons
---
So being able to store up some Buffs will be amazing.
---
I've only been playing since wastelanders but energy weapons have always broke really quick on me.
---
Hell even my ballistics and melee break daily with respective perks maxed and equipped, I kill alot of enemy grinding!
---
Nah nobody will get upset at you- if it meant anything to the owner it'd be locked. Just don't break into shit and you're fine.
---
Bethesda neglected it though, and the playerbase abandoned it as a result. It needed major changes but they never devoted the time to fix it.
---
100% agree and that's what made me put this post if I'm honest because I'm honestly fed up with trying to do the sbq event and then someone with bloodied just does it in seconds and I get nothing but of course anyone using bloodied won't care about that because there the one's doing it. It just seems like a overpowered build for an online game/team game.
---
I think part of it is that most of the public teams people set up are events teams.
---
I often join a team purely because someone on that team is somewhere I want to fast travel to for free.
---
What mods does it have? What size health bar? I use energy weapons and they don't just break like that.
---
I really enjoyed busting through 6 or 8 of them this morning! I might actually make a habit of playing every day again.
---
Nope. I use Bethesda Launcher. Just boot up the game and add me in game via the social menu
---
Messy either way isnt it, they're fixing what isnt really broken again, yes a couple of challenges around Whitespring can be tricky when your low level, but we all made it past them. No need to completely change the game, it'll end in a hot mess, just you wait :-)
---
Im up for that. Im a veteran at this point
---
The fix to SBs **used to be** a recon scope but Bethesda took away that functionality for some inexplicable reason. Berry mentats rarely works for invisible players. It's simply too buggy.
---
I run a gauss shotgun build that is 2 shot and bloodied, so yeah, that thing dies pretty quick.
---
It's not that hard if you do a couple matches.
---
Well actually, if you go into your pip boy, go to the first one. It actually has a [Collections] category that tells you what currencies u got and how much!
---
It’s worse when they build off a cliff lol
---
I'm kind of embarrassed to say it, but it took me a long time to figure the game out. Like how to use skill points and perk cards, how to use the stash box, CAMP setup, all that. The game was really confusing to me at first. I just didn't understand how it could be an online game but some things would remain consistent when you logged off. I was inspired by players who were like level 300+. I knew the game must be awesome if they played it that much, I just needed to figure it out and start progressing.
---
Savage divide. About halfway down the map.
---
Nope, still got over 50 of them.  Can't use the bloody things up quick enough.
---
Standard automatic barrel &amp; forcefull stock to increase condition,and it still breaks every 5 kills. 
---
I know there is perks but even maxed out it only lasts about 8 kills, and that would take 8 perk cards for 3 or 4 extra kills per repair
---
You are a fucking monster lol. I’m level 180 and I never ever eat corpses
---
Okay then players can be charged for extra chapters and content instead like ESO does. 
---
1st members pay for the work being done to the game, along with atom purchases with cash. Not in game atoms, actual cash keeps this game going. 
---
Peeps need to get over it and either buy it or learn to live without it. It's not going to be free. Ever.
---
Just go to either Charleston capital building or west tek. Farm those two spots for legendaries.
---
I can’t figure out why this hasn’t been tweaked by now. I mean, surely it’s just a literal number to change.
---
A new character running the first tow missions in Flatwoods gets to level 4, in my experience farming the fireman uniform.
---
Escpecially the Grognaks axe lol
---
Downvote to -1 for saying the same as all others....this sub lol
---
I mean, if the mod is on pc you should be able to get it on console. Unless it's hacked.
---
My Gauss Shotgun is immortal, and I don't know why. Thousands of shots and zero damage. It remains at 200%.
---
If you have 1st you have to have a mule, or 2, or 3.
---
I only have one but hes a level 10 with about 50 legendaries and 500 scrip already haha.
---
I'll eventually level him to 50 so I can actually trade in his scip for legendaries.
---
I’ve found If you enter your aid menu, then straight to map, then fast travel, that seems to work.. PS4.
---
Honestly I think I wold be nice to go back to the forest and feel like it was even a little bit of a challenge. I spent a lot of the early game there and have almost no reason to go back. I just circle a small area as it’s the only place that give me much of a challenge and high experience. Also some early level events could get better. Right now I find the jail break event to be pretty boring, but what if there was a chance it could go wrong again. If it’s implemented right I feel it could be a great thing for the game.
---
Exactly.  My purifiers and collection are all unlocked.  My camp is a responder post, resources are free and the drugs/ammo/scrip is cheap
---
I avoid this event for the reasons stated, but when I see ANY legendary I emote for other ppl to tag it if anyone is actually around. I’m a full stealth archer, I one hit everything. But I’ll use a Molotov on legendaries to tag them.
---
Mine was fine before, now I repair to 200% after a couple of Whitespring and West Tek it's at about 25%, no exaggeration.
---
The clean suit is an Atomic Shop item.
---
Remember when Wastelanders was supposed to fix the replayability?
---
Not gonna lie, if I got the Fireman uniform in one of those farms I'd be happy as a pig in shit.
---
I think that's the route I need. This is the one.
---
When I first encountered the purveyor I purchased a legendary module thinking 'that must be what it's for, you must be able to apply a random legendary effect to any item'.
---
Do you have a junk collectron?  Having them helps offset the scavenging for components with the required scrap to fix armour and weapons.
---
Well.... Sort of. Did rad rumble last night and left it to 15 seconds on the timer before starting the event. No one showed up. At all. I failed. Miserably. Got a lot of xp though, woop woop.
---
We will be able to set up our perks and change them quickly. So you can have your crafting perks then just switch back to your main build with one button and not individually moving your perk cards.
---
X-COM Fallout 76
---
If you go to freddies house of fear(north mire) there’s a clown suit and hat inside and a wendigo spawns in the parking lot, that’s where I completed that quest
---
I think the chart I saw said that by tonight you need to be 33 if you plan on getting to 100.
---
Omg no. Like I get what you're saying and all its just as a somewhat stoned out gamer I routinely scrap my costume by accident once every couple months or so. I don't want to lose my awesome weapons to my own stupidity. The whole scrip process already freaks me out lol.
---
1001 is possible, the ones you see 3000 to 5000 used XP exploits:-)
---
im down to clown on this one, grab 2 stims each, thumbs up and get to lemming jumping? :)
---
Ah that will be brilliant, I always forget to swap perks around when I’m crafting or scrapping lol
---
Same, except I wasted 100scrip to only find out "hey this is vault raid stuff"
---
My friend just turned lvl 1000 and he plays since the first day without using exploits
---
I like its a trap. Turn on lure, kill SB, walk away.
---
Oh I’ve been killed hundreds of time because I left super duper and scrapper on. It’ll be so much easier. That what I’m really waiting on.
---
Usually visual glitch, go to spend it/gold machine and it'll show correct amount.
---
You're doing it wrong.  The daily scout quests operation tidy and stings and things have a small chance of awarding possum badges and so does the public event campfire tales. I've got the armoured, insulated and high capacity backpacks and I still have 40 spare badges.
---
I kinda doubt it. Seems more like they just both used similar inspirations.
---
This fucked me over for the Queen I never realised until I was doing 6 damage per hit instead of 50
---
Send you one
---
So honestly ... this is the story of what happened to me earlier tonight:
---
I actually enjoy NW, and try to accomplish the challenges organically while I play, and reviving freaking sucks! I usually get gunned down when I try. Anyway, my teammate and I spawn at a location and it’s just us. I’m running around looting gear when I see the follow me emote. He’s built a stairway that goes up really high and I’m so happy because I know exactly what he’s going for lol. So I jump off twice for him, he jumps off twice for me, we’re both happy, then we go on to play the rest of the match and make it into the final 10!
---
TLDR; it’s worth a shot to be like my teammate and just build stairs to jump off of, your teammate might understand and be happy that you gave them the opportunity to do the challenge.
---
Can confirm, fucking annoying was tempted to Nuke them
---
What works for me is closing fo76 and going into LBP3, when I load in I get an error message saying “a problem occurred when connecting to PSN” 
---
Which has lead me to believe this is on Bethesda’s side, instead of trying to connect again, the game just crashes. I reconnect on LBP then close the game and go try again on fo76, it works most of the time but the character selection doesn’t show up until I log in
---
It's really not funny lol it's a nuisance
---
Alright bud. I'll be on after work!
---
Ive seen those. They're wrong and outdated based off week 1 score numbers.
---
Also half those charts don't factor in double score and double xp weekends.
---
Nor do they factor in the increase in daily score increasing by 500 this week.
---
And they dont include buying the last 10 levels with the atoms you are g in ben through the run.
---
I respect the fans for making them but they jumped the gun and aren't really accurate given this weeks changes.
---
Ohhh that one! I thought it was the one with the mole miners my bad
---
Ahh I see
---
I sorted it. Turns out it had something to do with my PSN cammera being connected
---
Dedication and loves bugs lol
---
No stimpacks required to revive other players, thankfully.
---
That's just like asking 500 extra space....
---
Thanks again!
---
Are you crazy?! That makes too much sense.
---
Question is, what has NOT broke since update 20? 🤔🤔🤔
---
You aren’t wrong. They do give you an idea of where to be. No one under 30 is screwed at all and still has time to get to the end.
---
Anything that isn't Bethesda can possibly cause a ban
---
Bethesda doesn't work on ESO at all.
---
Zenimax handle ESO.
---
Now it’s on game pass it’s hard to find a server with people that’l do these now it’s really annoying because half the servers are full of really low levels
---
Blodied mele leve 430
---
Junkye rifle comando 320
---
Blodied comando 289
---
Heavy blodied weapon 292
---
And blodied pistol 210
---
Nah that's not true lol. Bethesda only states that they don't give technical support to modded fo76 and yoy can't use mods in NW for cheating (at least not through nexus)
---
Plus blatant hackers and dupers have done what they desires with the game and no one got banned ever afaik
---
Honestly I disagree, I have a bloodied gauss minigun build and I can solo these events so easy. The only one I struggle with is encryptid
---
even easier, lets get to jumping, same username you see here, see you in 5?
---
If it isn't from Bethesda it's counted as a third-party software, aka a ban able offence
---
Show me where does it say that usng 3rd party software gets you banned
---
I tried doing it the normal way by playing match after match for more than 3 hours before posting here. I actually revived someone for the second time 30 minutes in, but it didn't give me credit for doing so. Hours of seething anger ensued...
---
Another member here helped me, so that was awesome.
---
We didn't try the stairs this time, but stood at the edge of the firestorm. It takes longer, but matches how I feel about playing Nuclear Winter 🔥 😠. Will try stairs next time this challenge appears.
---
Haha I had to google how to critical hit, I never used vats but its actually super handy especially if you can’t see who’s shooting at you. I’m also happy about the nuclear winter challenges, I’m not a fan of pvp so I would have never tried it but it’s actually pretty fun.
---
Dang. Alright. Thank you😎
---
Cannibal. :)
---
That kind of sucks. I personally think they should make it work with Carnivore and they should fix Slow Metabolizer
---
I certainly do buddy, I also have extreme farming techniques to get any resource in bulk,sadly though 99% of the time It only breaks when I'm underground surrounded by 2 assaultrons, and 10 seargeant gutsies, or ten ghouls batterring me like they're trying to soften steak lol
---
I don't think it will make any difference to forgetting to swap back. It makes it easier and quicker but that has zero effect on my capacity to remember something from 10 seconds ago.
---
I mean. The game tells you to press [BUTTON] to open V.A.T.S.. As you shot you see a bar on the bottom increasing. Your AP decreasing. When the bottom bar is full it tells you „press [BUTTON] for a critical hit“. If your AP depletes it closes VATS.
---
Which part exactly did you need a tutorial for?
---
Quote from Bethesda support:
---
&gt;CAN I USE MODS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY PROGRAMS WITH FALLOUT 76?
---
&gt;Fallout 76 does not support the use of any mods, add-ons, or other third-party programs. Please be aware that the use of such applications may result in Fallout 76 not functioning properly.
---
 https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F
---
I mean it's already in game, just make it a camp item! This would benefit so many camp builds.
---
Did you have that saved? That was quick, nice.
---
I hear you on that. When I try to do the Revives conventionally, it definitely takes me 3 - 4 hours to get it. And not everyone has that time. That’s why I was so glad my teammate built those stairs! I think I might try it in the future ... maybe everyone will catch on haha.
---
Gimme that armor piercing effect to my BE Handmade instead of faster sneaking movement speed
---
This. You are so me.
---
I don’t even want that stuff. My collectron is decoration. That’s it (please don’t tell him, though).
---
No, just googled "fo76 bethesda using mods" haha
---
So there's your answer
---
This is misleading.  The highest legit players are in the 2000s - early/mid 3000s.  There are players that have abused the god mode bug so much to pass level 10,000.
---
Same thing happens with ammo with your primary, shows 000 but is just a visual glitch.
---
This was the first insult I ever heard that actually made me react others I've heard were pretty shit lol
---
Should be getting my plushie today! So excited!
---
Yup solo'ed it with my be handmade (if it was night it would habe been quicker)
---
Thank you too! Having a companion to complete these co-ops with makes it super easy!
---
Ohh daaaamn lol
---
Wow I've yet to hear that one lol
---
shotgun
---
If you're using that extra shot mod (4 shots per shot?), it'll break the gun quicker due to each shot counting as a shot towards breaking. Forgot what it was called. Stopped using it because of this same reason.
---
It's why I make a note of their name  now
---
I put 20 of them in my camp as soon as I unlocked them. Sitting on every chair and every bed, also on my vending machines and pretty much anywhere they would fit lol
---
Never got that insult 
---
Then again I'm not sharing 1000 caps for a meat pie recipes lol
---
I only kill him if the insult is bad 6/10 it is lol or just doesn't make sense
---
Based on the challenge threads at the time, it seems a lot of people didn't know how to use V.A.T.S. it is glossed over when you have a ton of information being thrown your way.
---
the only ones bethesda has ever banned was those group of people who were bullying another player calling him a homo during release
---
My favourite is the Vault one lol he pretty much insulted the entire playerbase lol
---
Also the only throwable “explosive” I’m aware of that only exploded on contact. I tend to throw grenades from great distances to starts fights/tag groups of unaware enemies, and half the time they blow up in mid-air, accomplishing nothing besides alerting every enemy to my presence.
---
once saw a lvl 1200+ 
---
it's like seeing a 5* legendary
---
It’s still “press two buttons” and those are explained. Can’t help if people skip that part. It’s really all you need to know. 
---
It’s like skipping the manual and calling customer service. Then getting mad when customer service tells you it’s already described in the manual (:
---
Truth. It’s one of the six I need to be at 100% on plans. I’m offering a healthy amount of compensation for it and the rest.
---
I might be tired, but how does that relate to how third-party apps can possibly cause a ban?
---
Yeah people dont understand Bethesda is a business that has financial targets, employees to pay and maintenance costs. 
---
Like yes lets give all the players free content that makes our paid content pointless and not make any money from this game lol get reaaaaal
---
wait you can repair them :o
---
bethesda only bans player who call other players a homo 
---
so use ur third-party apps while u can
---
All legendaries or no?
---
Yeah, let's just forget about the multiple ban waves that has happened.
---
Was that in Welch above the food place? That scared the shit out of me my first time there
---
yeah, more players started to call other players homos, so be careful not to do that cuz ban waves
---
It's not available by default, checked on a new character.  Most likely unlocks once you access the whitespring bunker or worse case once you have joined the enclave for the main story.
---
A katana to match my white wolf fedora and glorious neckbeard.
---
Nuke whitesprings on a private world, if you're able and just circle it, with the boosts stacked, you'll easily do the repeatable. I leveled my level 180something main twice doing the circuit 3-4times. That's all I could do as other people started coming into the nuke zone and doing the circuit opposite to me.  
---
This will also provide a tonne or XP, plus a load of legendaries and flux crafting material.
---
GitHub is up again. Let me know if you need help with the script.
---
Honestly dude? Request a refund, and don't use FO1st screw them, if they are gonna ignore their screw up take the money you dropped on em back because that's pathetic that they don't at least try to hammer out your situation quickly and correctly
---
Yes same! I always thought using VATS and filling the meter was an automatic critical shot but obviously not lol!
---
Sorry. Please don't be mean.
---
Yes! Same and I don't know why.
---
Bloodied works on your health, not your enemy's.
---
I believe the gauss numbers shown are for it charged, though I am not sure. Also the number in your pip boy will not be the number you hit for, as the enemy's armour will negate some of it
---
Sometimes people have to do this to prevent losing caps. I sell serums for 300 caps each and try to keep a decent stock (5-10) of every type as I have all the recipes.
---
The other day I was on and had my vendors on because I was only at around 15k caps. I got the notification that someone was buying on the top left of the screen. He started with 1-2 of each type so I didn’t think much of it.
---
Suddenly he started buying every single one of my stacks of serums. Buying them 8-10 at a time. Very quickly and suddenly I was rapidly approaching max caps. I rushed to my base and pulled the power switch for my machine to turn them off, but shitty bethesda lag meant that it didn’t work and he kept buying. I asked over the mic for him to please stop as I was at max and he ignored me. At that point my only option was to quit as fast as I could.
---
He didn’t clean me out completely, but bought around 90% of my serum stash. I lost around 5k in caps because of his buying spree when I was at max and he kept purchasing.
---
Point being just be aware that sometimes there’s a good reason people leave when you’re about to purchase.
---
Another thing to consider- if you are on Ps4 or Xbox, you can always “record what happened” for the last 5 mins. That way you may well be able to find the player’s gamertag, and send them a message letting them know you missed out on an item they were selling. I bet most people would be happy to oblige you.
---
"nobody really wants their doors to be open all the time"
---
I do?
---
I’m not being mean... I was just showing you how to spell “cannibal” 😂
---
NTA. Your bush, your rules.
---
I think it would be cool if we could get scrip if we were able to scrap legendarys. Like 10 scrip for a 3 star weapon, 5 for a 2 star etc.
---
No, I have zero interest in continuing the trend of non-transferable items.
---
I know I know. It's all good 😎. We can still be friends?
---
That's really interesting that you found that out. That's outside the Eastern edge of the map which leads directly into the Capital Wasteland...
---
I believe I just hit 30.
---
Just under 42
---
I Would straight up leave The game if they ever implemented such weapons. 
---
Imo that’s what mods are for. 
---
I could never see that happening
---
If you play all daily and weekly challenges and top up with repeatable xp then you should be at or around the ship you chase, I don't really focus on doing either so I'm about 18 at the mo.
---
Ok
---
More like they better hope they don’t get sued for copyright infringement 😆
---
Oh yea that sucks.... Maybe they could remove that part since it's not part of the gold bullion stuff anyway?
---
What do you price them at?
---
I’ll regularly vendor hop and buy out weapons to scrip. 500-1000 for a trash 3-star? I’ll take them all. 5000 for an exterminators rolling pin? Heh... good luck. Doesn’t matter if that’s the “recommended” selling price. 
---
I’ll frequently drop extra plans, ammo, and other odds and ends for good sellers. They help me, I like to help them.
---
I sell all plans at 10% of their listed price.
---
Mine fly off my vendors.
---
32 for me.
---
Thanks for joining in and making this a success. A running jump from the top of the stairs is just what is needed.
---
Or just give you legendary modules upon scrap, that’d work for me
---
32 here
---
Your collections menu in pip boy usually shows 0 for everything when you first enter the world.. it seems to take time to register caps, gold, scrip etc..
---
You can google builds but determine what u like. Melee or stealth or shoot up close or afar. Being tanky. Explosives. Big guns. Etc etc. Then google a build and itll explain it in details about what perks are the best
---
I wanted to revive someone for today's SCORE challenge. Fortunately there were some others reading this thread in the same situation.
---
Same 31 doing every daily and weekly, but no NW’s at all
---
It literally all depends the situation sometimes i go in guns blazing with a gatling laser other times i stay distanced with a sniper other times i go in with as assaultron blade and start smacking the shit out of things
---
I wish for the 1st 3-5 seconds after a legendary enemy is hurt for the 1st time (DURING AN EVENT) they are immune to dmg.
---
  
---
So everyone can tag it alll-will.
---
&gt;Gunsmith has stopped working ~~on energy type weapons~~
---
FTFY
---
Thanks everyone for the input I only pull it out every now and again because of that problem,that is the only legacy I’ve gotten my hands on before the Removal and wipe so it’s nice to be able to use without worrying about my junk I just bought from a noob for an amazing price lol
---
I posted about it and some folks say it works for them, or they shoot so little they haven't noticed, which I doubt.
---
No, mine are busy
---
I'm level 99 and I learned last week that starting Encryptid costs caps. Most events do not, so I don't think that's a stupid assumption to make.
---
I'd love to see nonhuman companions to begin with, but a Mutie would be top on my list.
---
They're both entertaining and possess depth, so I bet you could craft an interesting story around such character.
---
The last piece of Sentinel armor I needed. There it was for 800 caps. Just decided to check which leg I needed - left or right... there's a stash box right there. I go back to the vendor aaaaannnnnnddd... poof.
---
Yeah, the ban hammer is real. I think Bethesda is just swinging that hammer hard at any notion of cheating and hope that this free-to-play weekend fills the population in the future. Plus, I think people are already bored with the battle pass.
---
Colossus*
---
Bloodied has enough synergy with everything.
---
Let solar powered/rad sponge people have fun!  =D
---
Keep using him for a second round from lvl 3 to 4. Faster than new to lvl 2 to 3. 
---
After lvl 4 you can get rit of him.
---
just like me as well, except my wife who plays with me got me using VATS. I always played COD style using ADS. with VATS ( and especially VATS and Gun Fu) i mow down enemies
---
I had to google how to do criticals as well lol
---
For dmg you better turn on dmg numbers to see. Weapon stats in pipboy are just bad. Like dmg gets reduced with Armor so it won't match and fire rate is shots per 10 seconds except when they are not, fire rate stat on Gatling is higher than minigun. 
---
Bloodied is based on your health. Executioner gives 50% bonus dmg on targets below 40%.
---
I need to start setting nukes off, I’ve only ever done it once and I dropped it at whitesprings but when I got there everything was dead lol then I got disconnected from the server and when I went back everything was back to normal.  This was also on the private server too.
---
I can only speak to ballistic weapons and since P20 a west tek run is enough to go from 200% to roughly 30%, with GS3.
---
Before P20 even GS1 was enough to keep my guns above 100% for days.
---
Run to Wayward.  Make a piece of armor and weapon at Overseers camp.  Talk to Dutchess and complete the Wayward quest.  Takes about 5 min start to finish.
---
What level are you?
---
I have a second account and a second PS4 and decided that for simple controlled trading, dumping stuff to mules, “why not”.  As I was doing that he started to get a few rewards and I said heck let’s just do the easy dailies, but on weekends try to finish the weeklies.  I am at 21 now and I did nothing the first week and a half.  As the person above said, I think doable.
---
The problem is -- how does Bethesda "make it hard".
---
 Make it hard to someoen who min/maxes a bloddied build is totally different than someone who plays normal and isnt trying to squeeze every-single drop of DPS out of their build.
---
I get it, Bloodied is meta -- but that is since, in my view, it is just stupid broken.   Junkies builds should be considered endgame, not Bloodied.
---
44
---
Yup, I only do the AFK ones or the put camp/do photos.
---
Because the devs don't actually play the game.
---
It's unfortunate for us, but understandable really. Working on the game is their job, so they probably don't want to come home and play it in their spare time.
---
When you like heavy guns, you can make a heavy gunner.
---
Which is cool when it works properly, half the time it will show how many caps i have, but zero for gold bullion and scrip and the other half it will show it all!
---
Glad it's not just energy weapons then, not good for you but I mean for a potential fix. I run pure Wastelanders Gauss weapons now, so was making a guess at why folks said it was ok.
---
Had this happen at WS last night on a nuke run. They weren't glowing, just regular ghouls laying down. First time i had seen it
---
do you look at your quest objectives? they‘re top right, you know.
---
That's different case afaik. The bunkers are not really "open world" but instantiated and work within the same rules. Pick up 180 other items in the bunker to force a reset or wait 22hrs.
---
Just got the paint for the t51.
---
I mean, you *can* sell them to vendors, but it's an exploit to do so. I do it because I think it's incredibly dumb to not be able to sell plans to vendors even though they're obviously valuable. With a limit on number of caps per day anyway, I see it as being a zero harm exploit, though.
---
I'm sure purists will still see it as being as bad as duping, but it's clearly not the same thing.
---
Is it?
---
This. Made me panic a few times too. Remember saving possum badges and it reset to 0 and I was furious until I went to the machine and saw they were all there. Happens all the time with my scrip too.
---
I've done West-Tec a few times a day and had nothing. Maybe I'm just finding bad respawns after the last person to run through.  
---
Not tried Charleston yet, thanks.
---
Did you figure out which one was the synth?
---
I'd be okay if they made it account wide.  I'm so tired of having to do the same grind for each of my characters.  I made a character with a 10 int  as my crafting master but along comes individual quests and destroys that whole idea.  And I agree it's silly that we can't learn to make the other item types as well.  Though it would be nice to be able to sell those, should the RNG gods smile down on us.
---
A few nights ago I was fighting colossus with some other guy from the shed near the bunker, I ran out of ammo for my good weapons and the other guy too. We ended up fighting him with non magic shotguns and killing the wendigo's with melee weapons, there where hundreds of them. The fight took us two hours and when he was almost dead he ran of to the forest and healed himself 100%. We decided to let him be and loot the dead wendigo's. I ended up with over 500 screws😊
---
congrats
---
I use the chinese stealth armor from the vault quest. I sneak around and kill everything in my path and they dont see me. Got to watch your rads, but you take very little. i usually have to take a rad away once or twice a loop around
---
Yes it was
---
If a legendary perk gave you a random bobblehead/magazine buff every 15 minutes that lasted an hour, so you can have four up at a time at max rank then it'd be worth the horrible grind. Players aren't considering that the grind in it's current state is insane. The rewards should be at a minimum a fraction of that, which none of the current legendary perks come even close to.
---
Beam Splitter.
---
yeah lol
---
Outside is a very subjective thing to say, What if I dont like the outside. Does that make me a lesser person?
---
it stacks
---
No I don’t think so
---
Two guys on a team I joined were jumping off a tower to get the revives and they did it for me too ❤️ Annoyingly my game crashed before we finished the the session but they got me the 250 score
---
Shame
---
Also, not sure if it counts as lighting, but most the camp flooring is far too reflective! Though maybe that's a shadows issue...
---
I'm not to sure what you are getting at.
---
I just want them to give people something to look forward to, different long term play styles.
---
69
---
Nice 😎
---
Thats why you're not selling any bud
---
Refrigerated mod you can get for gold from the Settler camp once you are the right affiliation with them. The crocolocus (or something like that) is a skin for the backpack. You can get also get a chemist backpack upgrade in the same way from the Raiders, and you can get a higher backpack mod from a rather lengthy grind of the scout challenges.
---
Knowing Bethesda it’ll probably take a week or 2 to fix it
---
Not at all. A. It was meant as a jokey comment and B if someone is spending a massive amount of time every day playing a video game, even if they’re afraid of open spaces then maybe they need to re-evaluate their outlook a little.
---
I missed 1 NW and 3 of the challenges on Saturday
---
This is true. On public worlds I regularly sell a few plans per session. Sometimes one person buys the whole machine, which costs about 300-400 caps.
---
Fasnacht plans still sell, and I price them about 300 each...but again, I sell one per day on average.
---
1 leader of the pack has 4 lvl 10 legendary wolves.   5 minutes and done ;)
---
Agreed!
---
I remember that.... we are here to cleanse the world of you G-words.
---
All weapons should be like that now want a fixer craft one still have rng, trying to get one you want increase the amount of modules needed to craft them though and  there's you grind right there. But make it so you can sell and trade please
---
Scorched Horde - the leader will be legendary.
---
His name is Earl Williams.
---
37
---
The only team you need to join is the BUILD TEAM.
---
Free INT!
---
Im assuming theyre talking about the tadpol scout mods. You spend the possum tokens on them. You can get 2+ a day between the repeatables and whenever campfire tales shows up. Theyre worth a good bit. I dont think the 2 new ones from the factions can be traded. And im pretty sure theres 3 different backpack skins in game you can trade. I might be wrong but one of the scout ones, the blue ridge trading co. And the wilard pack.  All pretty valuable
---
Before the SCORE thing came around and I actively went looking for tips on how to up my XP haul, I always assumed high levels like that used XP glitches.
---
I have a modest 5 INT, always make sure to join a public team (building) and use Inspirational / Food XP boosts and see much higher XP than I had in the past.  Bloodied builds, with full Uny and maxed out INT are probably getting GOBS of xp on Whitesprings / West Tek runs...
---
I ran a scan and repair from the launcher and I also deleted the FO76 folder from 'My Games' under documents. Neither resolved the issue.
---
This could also be a higher priced food item when sold.  
---
There is a fair run around getting all the materials and ingredients but non-perishable food buffs are going to be very popular.
---
Refrigerated is a Scout reward, not Gold. You're thinking of the Grocery Backpack.
---
This is pretty much me. I have a mule who server hops once every day or two, buying up all of the weapons and armor for up to 20 caps per scrip. I run a full weapon weight reduction set of armor, the armor weight reduction perk, and keep an empty Stash fit storage. I spend about 25 to 30k every day or two buying enough scrip for 20 characters to be able to trade in 150 a day.
---
I will never pay more than 800 for a 3 star weapon.
---
If you're trying to clear your inventory quickly, mark down the prices to scrip value, not suggested retail.
---
Bethesda have never been able to get lighting right in TES/FO going all the way back to Morrowind days.
---
Nowadays they rely too much on ambient light, instead of object source light, and really bad reflective maps on their textures.
---
Yea I forgot about the bullion plans being locked out of trading. I'd want normal plans to be tradable for sure.
---
17
---
Usually i just bash him. But now and the i killed him by accident, he jumped more then once in front of one of his comrades and took the bullet for him....
---
Both
---
Yeah, horde events will always have a legendary. I just don't understand why regular Scorched so very rarely are.
---
Just about to start yellow section what ever that is
---
Same, when i sell one item i have to put my vendor away because someone in bethesda decided that 30k caps is the limit...
---
I really liked the Christmas event, it gave us a reason to hunt scorched.
---
like 25 percent of the time when I teleport to a camp vendor the loading screen finishes and his camp is no longer there when I check the map I see that they have left the server. I think I am on list or some thing it’s kinda crappy I just don’t go to camps now.
---
34 - a few repeatables to 35
---
Did the same thing to me.
---
Maxing a legendary perk takes 450 perk cards, you need to use all the cards from 113 perk card packs or 450 cards you already have. So after 565 levels you can look forward to maxing out follow through for 40% more sneak damage, you get more just from normal perks already in the game. 200% extra sneak damage wouldn't even be useful for most players unless they're fighting SCB. That's an example of how the players need to think much bigger than the scraps Bethesda is currently wanting to give us.
---
Yea I'm a bloodied stealth cammando he lasts maybe a full 10 secs
---
I use Heavy Weapons, Power Aromr.  I also use weapons that say FURIOUS on them.  After 5 hits, I get +50%dmg -- and it is very easy to get 5 hits with a Minigun or Gatling Plasma/Laser.
---
I dont like having low health, nor all the negitive effects of junkies.
---
FURIOUS is my baby.  I also love Two-Shot/Explosive.
---
Full health builds FTW.
---
Once saw a 1337 and a 1047 at a Scorchbeast Queen run. Wew lad, did that thing melt fast.
---
sadly theres a glitch you can sell plans to vendors, which makes them possible to dupe too.. =\[
---
Alright look, retro-futurism is a thing. Both Zathura and and Fallout use it. But the art is nothing a like. The board isn't similar in the slightest. And the only other similarity they have is spaceships for the player pieces.  
---
 If you look at space in retro-futures it all gives this type of vibe.  
---
I'm sorry but I wouldnt call this even an inspiration, let alone a direct one.
---
I agree I liked it better before.
---
The LMG needs a .38 receiver and better sights.
---
The .50 cal is in dire need of some accuracy but is pretty well-balanced otherwise, so comfort grip and sights.
---
I sell most of my plans and recipes for 0 through 5 caps on my vendor. They don't take much weight, but eventually i will dump them all on someone fresh out of the vault if i can't sell them
---
i have seen legendary scorched at harpers ferry a couple of times
---
34, more then halfway to 35.
---
Step 1) Remove the daily scrip cap.
---
Step 2) Enable the ability to receive Legendary Modules when scrapping: 1 module from 1 star legendaries, 2 modules from 2 stars, 3 modules from 3 stars.
---
You enable the ability for people to farm for legendaries at their own pace, without feeling forced or pressured into having to hit the daily scrip limit to maximize their legendary rolls from Murmurgh.
---
There's still diminishing returns from scrapping any legendaries you get, so you can't just infinite loop with scrip or modules.
---
Alas, because of the fear of dupers, this is just a pipe dream.
---
Yeah, me too. I never bother going to places like Glass Caverns, even thigh it's a neat place, simply because you're very unlikely to get a legendary (unless the Scorchbeast at the end, or the Mirelurk Kings are).
---
So wait what is it?
---
I typically buy 1 ammo when I start browsing to give the person a heads-up that they have a potential buyer.
---
Good ideas. I personally think there shouldn't be a negative. Given we can elect to put on a backpack for added carry weight and don't get a negative effect, I feel like this is a similar concept. If food will be irrelevant in the next couple patches anyway, would allow those who already were enjoying crafting food to stay relevant.
---
I know you meant it in a funny way. It just that comment is so cliche, why is the outside so great? Other than fresh air depending on where you live, thinking about polution. There is also vitamin D in the Sun. Its not that I dont go outside, I kinda have to. But its my vacation, and I want to play video games. Is that a bad thing? Dont want you to think im mad or anything. 😀
---
Unfortunately, the thing is, it \*is\* outdated :(
---
Grahm*
---
33
---
Depends on the room. Some rooms have higher HP/DR/ER at level 2.
---
In my experience those people are the same people. Once a dude was camped in the back corner going left from the entrance, and he one shotted the first supervisor with his tesla rifle. He was just squatting there invisible. So I camped there too, inside the door to try and kill them before this asshole, but he kept getting them by shooting me with the arc.
---
Pretty sure the board game was based off the movie. The movie came out in 05. The game probably shortly after. So yeah I'd say the latter
---
Yeah, every once in a long, long while I'll see a legendary Scorched. They *do* exist. But it makes me think that there is a reduced chance for them to spawn. This should be turned up to be at least equal with Super Mutants, in my opinion.
---
They don't despawn.  The corpse is just somewhere else.  I'm pretty sure its due to the difference between where your computer thinks you killed something and their server thinks it happened.  The server always wins.
---
Its not even close. Just both use a retro-futuristic space
---
Ah, I was there last night to collect Ultracite. It’s one of the coolest places in the game, but very little else to get players to go back.
---
I don't know. I always wait for others to join and 9 times out of 10 they spend the entirety of the events going for kills and ignoring the objective, causing us to fail.
---
When the waves stall out, don't wait until the timer runs out. Get off the island and hop up to the crossbow shooting range. Nine cases out of ten, one or more of the mirelurks got stuck up there after getting into a tangle with the ghouls that live there. In very rare cases they can also get stuck in a few other places, most of them in a line from the shooting range to the main entrance, but the solution is always to send one or two people off to scout the ridges from which they swarm down to the lake.
---
It's a bullet sponge that goes down in 2 minutes in the pts. They don't know how to make end game bosses without being bullet sponges. I think if they released the event today in about a week people would not nuke it anymore because it's not worth doing it over the queen.
---
Hangout in the forest for awhile. Explore. Don't rush the main quest line, you'll be under leveled very quickly. Once you get in to the teens/20s move up to the toxic Valley, in the 30s move down to the Ash heap.
---
Do events to level up. Grab a decent melee weapon as ammos hard to come by at low levels. Scrapping guns can teach you mods for them, so scrap what ever you can.
---
Don't worry about upgrading your weapons to much, you'll out level them. Just grab what enemy's drop and use them
---
If a high level is shooting at the ground near you look for a bag. Many people drop care packages for low levels
---
The reason i still played the game during its rougth times was the steady flow of uppdates and fixes the only time i took a break was during the inventory steal pc glitch.  When i started i saw how much work bethesta put in to the map and how they always worked on improving the game with events. I also love the grind for better legendarys and building diffrent classes.
---
Or how about this wild and crazy idea...some kind of team or server text chat.  I know what you're thinking, that's way too crazy of an idea, I mean it's not like we are playing an online multiplayer game with a need to communicate with each other.  If only we were in the year 2020 and text chats were a thing.
---
At least at first, ignore what other players are doing. Don’t get ahead of yourselves.
---
Slow and steady to start, learn stash and weight management (scrap often, don’t be a hoarder). 
---
Weapons are leveled, so that good level 5 hunting rifle will be obsolete and replaced by level 10.
---
Carefully consider your perks and perk cards. You won’t have a lot of options to start, but QoL cards can make a big difference in the beginning.
---
just more legendaries across the board for me. they seem to be like buses i wait ages without seeing any (outside of guaranteed spawn linkd to events) then every other location i travel to has one. then back to the drought. i don't know if they program it this way or what but it can be very frustrating as i don't play for very long.
---
For me, Crane was already dead when I went up there with Duchess, and she blamed me for his stroke.
---
It can't break what it was already broken.
---
At this point, they just gave up, it's obvious to me.
---
They will work in this game only to add new baits (like sessions) or to fix something that breaks the game playability.
---
They are not going ever to fix things like balance, minor bugs, rng issues, economy, hacked items, unlimited cheats...
---
The market was already broken.
---
Depends. SS armor is a huge grind (overall cost for everything is more than the T-65), but for me it was worth it.
---
36
---
Well, I mean, it is your fault for not doing basic research and making assumptions.
---
With everyone and their gran now owning explosive flamers, lasers and gats it might be a good time to start selling fuel, plasma cores, fusion cells etc. 5.56 for those with their shiny new BFFRs.
---
Xp buff items like leader bobbleheads or cranberry relish for Legendary Run.
---
No point selling weapons right now other than scrip or stuff for new players as prices are all over the place.
---
Swing speed. All the way
---
depends on your build, honestly
---
That depends entirely on your build. You've already got the Power Armor, are you not maining it? The armors won't stack with each other. If you're doing a power armor/heavy gun build, then you should go for the minigun. If you don't use power armor often, you probably should have gone for the SS armor first.
---
When I was a newbie and they logged off and I fell into the water and took massive RAD damage without me having Radaways or being eaten by high level mobs... Fun.
---
I don't understand why people don't share the legendaries there.
---
I know I take an absurdly low amount of damage from the mole miners, so why not hit them with a low power weapon and emote for others to come get a hit?
---
I don't need an under leveled legendary, and to be fair, most players don't. But some are limited on time to play, and that bit of scrip could help them craft or buy something they want.
---
I know they don’t stack. I’m a bloodied build. Just wanted to see what was worth  grinding for?
---
In the long run you'll be able to get both.  
---
If you're going for a Heavy Gun build, you might as well get the Gauss Mini.
---
I think you’re a little bit touchy. But not mad. World we live in now. Everyone is offended by everything.
---
Thanks. Yes I'm also using adrenal reaction but not using the adrenaline perk because I thought it was broke.
---
Hello y'all, thank for all the infos and tips they'll truly help in in my journey.
---
If anyone wanna play with me my Xbox gt is : deadhead115#9712
---
Ok gauss mini it is. I’ll do secret service later on. Thanks dude.
---

---
I'm loving the plasma caster.
---
Thanks man!
---
Sorry I'm on xbox.
---
I have a bloodied ex gatling plasma. Does it do more dps than that gun if I get it bloodied?
---
A mod for the SS chest
---
when they dont start nerfing bloodied builds best what you can do is buy secret service armor and start rolling unyielding legendary effect. You spend a lot of time, resources and in the end you are God.  Gauss minigun is not important because its absolute trash economy-wise gun.
---
Get a Quad Handmade or Fixer, your life will never be the same.
---
I just pain train amd tesla coil everything. Im a pain machine. If i come across the legendary first i get my PT on  while using the follow emote over and over. If someone start one shotting stuff I get infront of all their shots. But honestly I only do that event for all the mole miner drops to go sell for my daily caps.
---
It will be a data strings mod, go into your Data &gt; Strings folder in your root Fo76 folder and delete the SeventySix_en files.
---
How about you just get fallout 1st and support the game that you are playing.
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. 
---
(Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. 
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
Are you wearing unyielding armor? The str bounse would up your carry weight. I'm having a bit of trouble following your question though
---
did you ever find the neon sign where is it?
---
No I don’t have it
---
My resources are getting pushed close to their limits. If it isn't materials, it's farming spots. if I can't farm, I spend caps on asbestos lead copper steel ballistic fiber you name it. It could be anything. Logistically I'm prepping late in the evening and early morning before reset to get ready for "THE AMAZING PEOPLE WITH SIEGE CAMPS WHO DESTROY SBQ THREE TIMES IN A ROW" you guys are amazing. Thank you for the level ups and all. Anywho I can't spend on the luxuries of vendors. Heck I saw that robot who sells the nuka cola clock plan and the cuckoo clock plan 240 caps each. I was BROKE. If anyone can, please sell bulk items reasonably cheap. Got to get to 100!
---
i just use the "come here" emote. doesnt work every time, but occasionally my event public team mates will join whatever event i'm in when i throw that
---
Sounds like unyielding. As yours strength goes up, so does your carry capacity
---
Can jump/fall from ridiculous heights with little to no dmg, as well
---
30 for me, I do them all except the NW ones
---
Ok thank you
---
Very dead this week.
---
If you max out the faction before finishing the vault raid, you won't lose anything when you double cross them. I maxed out Raiders then kept all the gold. Only lost a chunk of Settler rep, the raider bar stayed maxed.
---
&gt;	I mean, you can sell them to vendors, but it’s an exploit to do so
---
Exploit? I was unaware of that. How does someone do that?
---
I don't have all the time in the world to play this game. For the small amount of time I get to play fallout 1st is not worth it at all for me. If it was a one time payment maybe but not a subscribtion for a game I don't get to play all that much
---
Yes! That thing.
---
I only priced my 3stars high because every time I vendor hop I always see 3* weapons for atleast 3-5k. I’m going to do what you said and sell them at scrip value and hopefully someone will come and buy them.
---
XP. 14k in total for all the Halloween ones and 27k in total for the Christmas ones. There is no in game counter so you need to keep track yourself
---
It’s still dumb because you can thank the person directly. If someone does something nice for you in real life, do you post an ad in the newspaper thanking them? Of course not. You just thank the person in person.
---
I think moving to OS drive as oppose to D: or whatever can fix it for some
---
Ive seen afew other posts about this and there is some speculations that this may be a thing when the BoS content drops.
---
39, been on that grind!
---
They straight up said it was a mistake and they will remove them
---
They are not able to fix bugs. There are STILL bugs from one GAME ago. Also, remember when they tried to fix the 250 bug? And they ended up messing ALL legendary items?  Or when they reversed with patch "b" what was fixed on patch "a" ?
---
Then I recommend stop asking for things that paid players have even if it's a lesser quality.
---
That fixed it, thank you so much!
---
This needs fixed ASAP.
---
Gauss minigun is soooooo hungry tho
---
Here are all my mutations not sure if any of them would effect my carry weight adrenal reaction bird bones chameleon marsupial speed demon talons and twisted muscles
---
Oh ok. So I’ve installed it on my SSD, but my OS is on my HDD, so after I’ve moved it can I move it back to get the SSD performance back?
---
More currencies to bounce of an arbitrary cap....woo hoo :-)
---
Imposter cards, i have like 20 of them lol
---
I hope so with all the common plans we get from events. I emptied my stash because I was curious. I have 70 weight alone with plans
---
Never done it I'm afraid, just seen previous posts where this has resolved it.
---
I noticed the ammo is very expensive to craft. I already have a gatling laser and plasma god rolls so I guess it’s not worth it? Idk.
---
And where do I craft the armor at it won’t appear at armor workbench
---
Out of curiosity, what made you think it's for backpacks? Especially since no jetpack ever was for any backpack.
---
What's SS armor?
---
Secret Service.
---
Oh it’s obvious to you? Well then..
---
They all ready have the base of it with script. All we need is an NPC and a new name for it
---
I'd love this I'm a plan guy and find some or receiving them by events is killing me lol
---
As stated - stay away from workshops till you understand how pvp works.
---
I'm hovering at 28k and had my venders turned off all weekend. Was vendor hopping like mad looking for something to spend my caps on.
---
Nobody is selling anything good. Every camp was scrip, scrip scrip.
---
I did see a level 30 VE fixer. Super cheap. 6000 caps. But I decided to let somebody else find that gem.
---
A few mutations lower your strength. You need class freak ti counter it.
---
Relax, all that is not coming this summer. They already added public teams and the board game, that's too much for only one summer.
---
32, having refused doing the "revive a downed player" and "kill x creatures" NW dailies but doing everything else, including the other NW ones. Also have done a few of the XP grind repeatables.
---
Bird bines lowers strength.
---
One of my alts I was going to make into a trader back before they were even talking about player vending. I traded all my extra plans over to him from mine and my wifes main characters. I have at least 100 mole miner gauntlets lol
---
Im not offended, well every comment can be taking as someone being butthurt. Because you cant see the person your takling to. That is the real problem today. That is why I dont normal talk much to People online, Its better in person. 🙂
---
I’m guilty when it comes to mtx but I don’t mind them so much in this game. If it’s something I want I don’t mind paying for it
---
Or just make them available for sale to NPC vendors. To me they may as well be diluted Stims or Radaway. Just trash I leave in a bag atm.
---
It would be cool if he ran fast like ghouls and grabbed you so you couldn't run away until he told you his stale jokes. I would enjoy a little running from that bastard. Also if you shoot he stays invincible. And says something witty to annoy you. Tag bot? Hey that would be cool a bot that tags you and runs away. Yells if you can catch me get a prize! Legendary rng.
---
I have a cliff base and always make a point to check for visitors before logging off. The only times I’ll log off are when nobody is there, somebody’s griefing my base, or my game crashes. I do my best not to send people tumbling.
---
I took all my plans out of my stash out of curiosity and I had 70 weight alone of of plans SEVENTY. We need some way to recycle them.
---
Why is this downvoted? It has the exact answer to OP’s question. Rocket is a mod only dropped from events in toxic valley and savage divide, with a low percentage chance. This sub is so weird at times.
---
Bird bones lowers str so that would lower your carry weight. And marsupial adds like 20 pounds
---
You need plans to craft armor at a work bench and you can't just craft legendary armor
---
You also need to reply to people instead of just commenting on your post. Hit the little curvy arrow under people's comments to reply. Otherwise they do not get notified or know who you're talking to
---
Unyielding is a legendary effect. You don’t craft it.
---
You wrote 2141 wrong
---
high inteligence makes you level up faster. some people have been using bloodied builds with unyelding armor since launch, I dont know the exact math but they run around with ~30(?) Inteligence. which grants them a huge, legit, boost to leveling up. 
---
I play since beta, my base inteligence is 5, but it’s reduced due in game addictions, I run a junkies build. I never cared for the xp boost in food or sleeping and I’m level 380. 
---
so those level 1000 might be legit.
---
Haha I bet it did.
---
I'd assume it works the same way as the PA jetpack.
---
Scrip (no t :-) )
---
But we have already caps, scrip, treasury notes, gold bullion, ammo points and perk card coins coming, I mean do we need more currencies?
---
Do you think anyone on PlayStation would give it to me
---
'ish? Gatling Mini's got an innate explosive effect, better range, accuracy and ammo capacity.   
---
2mm are harder to come by in the quantities you'll need compared to plasma cores, but honestly what difference does that make if you're late game anyway? It's not like steel's in short supplies these days or something.  
---
Doing a quick check on the damage calculator tool, if you pull FFR then it's better, if you +10% Aim then it's about the same, so in general it's probably gonna be a mild dps improvement for you.
---
How about meat meals are made with metal cans, and vegetarian foods are made in mason jars?
---
Something just feels weird to me about eating a meat meal out of a mason jar.
---
We need away to recycle are old plans I know that.
---
Huh, that’s weird, we usually nuke a public, but run the risk of not having much to kill
---
Sure, but when? Mistakes tend to have a very generous window of correction with this game.
---
Scorched in the airport are not legendary, its just a boss of that location (with a crown), you can see that tip on a loading screen some times, they have more loot, but not legendaries
---
All very well and good....until you realize nobody else joins
---
I’ve been seeing this a lot more lately on xbox. Some higher level people (300+) too. People are just assholes I guess.
---
I tried that when a legendary Sentry bot exploded and vanished, pointed the camera right at where it said he was but couldn't put my cursor on anything so couldn't loot. Ditto for every other time a corpse has vanished due to bugginess. Camera does not help in these circumstances
---
Nah.
---
Takes away the community of the game a little bit.
---
Gauss minigun is good but be gatling plasma is in it's own category.
---
Gauss shotgun ( bloodied ) is a monster.
---
I'm with you there, but not another currency.
---
He’s also there to tell you to pull his finger.
---
It seems some of the decisions are glitched. I recently did the settlers' raid and both Jen and Radcliffe acted like I'd taken the bad options when I hadn't.
---
I don't know what it could be. Maybe just as straight swap? Common for common plans and like 8 for a rare? I don't know tbh
---
Work on stuff together. If she wants to build bases then do that and scavenge materials for her. Make her game time easier and less frustrating and try to pick different weapon types so that you'll always be finding stuff for each other. Getting a little gift of a slightly better weapon from each other is fun. And when you're questing.  Don't wander off. Also, even if she wants to play a less than optimal build (like going pistols),  just support her on that, don't try to argue it. She'll naturally choose what is most fun for her and that's ok. Ask for help when you need it. You can easily get frustrated if you get killed and she could/can save you but you didn't tell her. Talk constantly while you play. 
---
Anyway that's my tips. I've played this game for hundreds of hours with my wife successfully.  Glhf
---
Depend on the help of others to accomplish a collective goal?
---
That sounds like COMMUNISM! 
---
*gunshots*
---
Did you even click the link and look at the other pics?  There’s no question it’s an almost direct ripoff, the only difference basically is there are a lot more spaces on the Fo76 board because they needed it for a 3 month season.  The colors, designs, board pieces, boarder details, layout, all are nearly identical. Obviously they were directly inspired by the actual game board.
---
Nice! Thanks
---
Pressure plate switches on powered doors solves this problem, although the wiring for 2 way access is a little tricky.
---
People can downvote me all they want doesn’t make them right. You’re correct in why you found with your edit, that’s the only one I’ve seen that can do that. People asking for real money for items that can be taken away is pretty ridiculous.
---
It is in fact called legendary scorhed so it IS a legendary except it has zero stars and it never drops legendary loot.
---
This game is over.
---
I just started the wayward quest. Im level 4 already after 10min
---
You have to get a crew. If you want to XP farm, you get four people to run ore, then hold all the ore and farm mobs that spawn. Then, at the last second, dump the ore in and finish the event.
---
Also, run in a Building team for the INT/XP buff during the event, then switch your team to an Event team right before finishing the event to get an even greater XP boost.
---
Did anyone have a solution for this? Seemingly using VAT works sometimes
---
Join a team, a building team’s bonus to intelligence boosts EXP a bit and the events team does more but only for events
---
I always forget its not a backpack and wonder why I cant jump high in stealth armor
---
I'm choosing not to go after the SS armor. I've got my unyielding +1 strength set of combat armor and don't want to go through the grind to replace it.
---
Seems like too much effort for a slightly better damage resistance. 
---
So I'm buying the new weapons.
---
Not always, it only show up with 👑 sometimes.
---
Also if you want I can craft you some starting gear if you'd like. If we can get times line up haha. If not I totally get that haha. The early levels can get ruff. And in the 30s+ I know a lot of people really struggle
---
I feel like the enemies, especially the legendary, should scale (with a minimum baseline) not just based on the quantity and level of the players but the amount of max DPS the players can put out. So if you're bloodied or junkies and can put out 90k/minute of damage you will be dealing with a much higher HP and resistance enemy. Would make more fun and no more one shotting bosses.
---
Yes its broken rn, but are you sure the videos you are watching aren’t from before patch 20?
---
50% dmg is pretty significant.
---
I think people are saying you may already have a piece of unyielding armor if you are getting more carry weight at low health. 
---
Any piece of legendary armor can potentially have the unyielding effect.
---
Huh. Works for me on xbox. Weird
---
Fair enough. I have a full set of unyielding marine armor. Maybe later on I’ll invest on the secret service armor.
---
Yes, it matches.  And it's s random plan drop.  Try other player's vendors.
---
I started doing the Responders stuff also to try to get the Fireman outfit. It's pretty easy to get three days/levels out of the Wayward and joining the Responders with the water stuff then cooking a steak.
---
I wonder then what you intend to achieve by adding your snide remarks here.  I visit this sub daily, and even if it was here, I haven't seen anything regarding this problem.  It is a true bug, frustrating and deserves exposure.  In 2k hours of gameplay, it had never happened to me.  But yesterday it did.  Pardon me for intruding by asking why, but this forum is here for questions, not attacks or sarcasm.  That serves no purpose. Shitposts like yours are the reason people are afraid to ask legit questions for fear of looking dumb.  Good thing IDGAF.
---
So am I, its my second lowest next to luck right now till I decide to move my points around. I mostly just grab ore cuz I like to save my plasma ammo for the larger guys and for some reason I can never get enough copper to make any sizable amount even with the super duper perk and ammosmith
---
Learn to let go.
---
If I told you everything that I end up dropping at train stations your head would explode.
---
I agree so much!!! Bethesda should scale all of these enemies for every player have a challenging content.. Right now, its not fair for noone..
---
No strange in numbers works as long as anyone else on the team is mutated, but the people who aren't mutated get no benefit from it if you share it
---
You forgot overseer tickets.
---
Gunslinger is a TOUGH build, not impossible, but way harder then basically every other build. Really low damage, hard to sneak, low rate of fire. I love my gunslinger, but she is bloodied, with good gear.  Just a warning.
---
tbh i usually wait the entire time before i start and the great majority of the time, nobody shows up for PP or RR
---
Let me guess you did an exploit? Or you just gave them out lol?
---
I’ve gotten real sick of Beckett’s fetch quests.
---
Also technical data, claim tokens and pleasant valley claim tickets :-)
---
I'd do it but only if I got some legendary modules from it. Otherwise hell naw. It's way more valuable as scrip, plus I might scrap my own stuff if I'm auto-clicking
---
Because, that would take a tenth of a second of thinking about someone other than yourself, which apparently is way too much for some people.
---
A year ago before I stopped playing, everyone would carefully wait for everyone else to get a hit in, even when there was like 10 of us, send emotes to get everyone there/lead the supervisor to the main room so everyone sees him, etc.
---
A month ago I put it down to people not knowing better because there was an influx of new players, but it seems like now every time I do the event this happens. Really infuriating because it is nothing but pure selfishness if people known better, and most players strong enough to one-shot the guy should.
---
I feel like maybe it was due to the Fasnacht legendary spawn and the fact that everyone treated that like a free-for-all, some players just carried that principle on to every other legendary event spawn. Lately I see it happening not just in Uranium Fever, but all others now too
---
It's all RNG sometimes you get lucky o th her times you get very sad like the other day I got a bloodied 25/15 but it was a revolver what a kick in the nuts
---
Halfway through 35
---
42
---
You on PTS cuz that event hasn't launch yet
---
First, low level enemies have lower odds of being legendary in general
---
0-9 - 0.01%
---
10-19 - 1%
---
20-29 - 2%
---
30-39 - 3%
---
40-49 - 4%
---
50+ - 5%
---
These numbers were from release era datamines, and have been changed server side since then, so don't necessarily align with current rates, but should give a general idea.
---
SO yeah there are very few legendary mole rats outside events because they are level capped at 21, so will naturally have lower rates than enemies who regularly spawn at high levels, this is also the case for mole miners, who even at the highest level are only level 40, but they rarely spawn at max level in most of the places they do spawn, generally being level 30 and below.
---
Scorched, and ghouls have their legendary spawn rates reduced because they are super common, the scorched almost never spawn legendary in particular because there are ways to easily cheese them to spawn hundreds per hour.
---
No I watched a lore video about it. Haha
---
You throw away trash.
---
No way in hell is Bethesda gonna make the people who duped presents get even more value out of it.
---
The reason people gave you those plans is because their garbage, and so abundant they can hardly be sold for five caps.
---
But then he never lets you do it! What a let down.
---
I didn't think about those. 
---
Though I'm aware most people haven't been added Herd Mentality. But there'd differently be some who are doing that.
---
It came up to me and said nothing. That was insulting in on itself.
---
No. It doesn't match because it's bugged. The keypad is on the wrong side. I got my plans from  Vendor bot Wallace in Harpers Ferry.
---
The rainy weather looks absolutely shit
---
That's what I meant to say.
---
&gt;	The reason people gave you those plans is because their garbage, and so abundant they can hardly be sold for five caps.
---
I noticed that the moment I got more than one of the same plans, and that sucks lol
---
52
---
Do what I do and check if hes there while people are fight SBQ agro the colossus and have the 2 fight each other so you dont waste as many bullets plus it makes for amazing photos
---
Yeah gear wise this game is very one track sadly.
---
32, nearly 33.
---
I just did this and had a lot of trouble before this.  
---
When you turn on mods did you continue through the prompts and go to the MODS folder not the original location of the install?
---
I don't lock any of it, including the turbo fert.  Come and get it.
---
The vendor in whitespring is
---
I saw that, before it was deleted :-)
---
Before Wastelanders, everything was super bright and washed out. Night time looked like day time, and day time looked like the desert at high noon. 
---
It looks a ton better than before, so be careful what you wish for. I personally like the higher contrast and I like that my character looks wet in the rain.
---
not at all. I've probably had the most sales this weekend than I've had since Wastelanders release tbh. im not even selling anything that great.
---
And it seems like you're taking some cosmetic rewards far too seriously. It doesn't affect you or anybody else who already has them whether or not others get them
---
As someone on PS4 I can attest to how dead it is for business lately. Ended up dumping some mid tier legendary armor just to free up some space after being for sale for weeks on end.
---
26
---
Yeah same for me. Personally I don't want to wait 20 mins just to do one event and no one shows up. It's more time wasted then just failing the event on your own
---
Nuka cola
---
Its to the point where Im barely able to offload over 1000 5.56 rounds a day. Its getting desperate out here.
---
Every time I play Uranium Fever, someone does the "Follow Me" emote to signal everyone to put a bullet in the legendaries.
---
One recent playthrough, someone kept killing them and pissed everyone off. Everyone showing negative emotes with someone calling them out on voice chat.
---
Rule #1 of Uranium Fever: Let everyone get a shot at the legendary enemies. Everyone in the event will greatly benefit!
---
in my experience its most when there are minor obstacles in your LOF. If you can see the target doesnt mean at all that VATS "can see" it too. quitting VATS, moving a bit, usually does the trick.
---
Bitch aint getting my scrip, I don't need any rolling pins today :-)
---
I ask why the hell anyone even needs a jetpack.
---
Shit is the least *Fallout* thing in the game imo. We get jetpacks added into normal armour but can't get a decent laser weapon despite how iconic they are.
---
It's basically a way to make annoying MMO 'jumpers' even more of a pain in the ass.
---
The theme is a basic theme for both of these. The game pieces are different enough to where I dont feel there any influence.
---
Look they are both supposed to feel like old school board games, think life, candyland, etc. And you know what I'm talking about. Then they both have the retro futuristic stuff so just google retro-future space and take a look. The game pieces are the same deal, look at Futurama's Planet Express to see how common that type of spaceship design is. 
---
Basically I want you to make an old style type board game(the type where dice usually dictate how many spaces you move and theres only one way to get to the end) with a retro-space style in your head and tell me how different it looks.
---
I'd eve go as far to say that Candyland had a far more direct influence than Zathura
---
That seems weird if you are able to craft x01 I would think you would have access to flux crafting too. Don't remember if you need all your commendations before you get access to x01 or not.  There is either a terminal entry or a note laying in the military wing vendor room of the bunker that talks about flux types and what not.  Wonder if you need to read that or something first?? Seems like you should be able to see nuked flora at a chemistry bench already though to me.
---
Was working here, PC, a few minutes ago.
---
What we really need for them to be viable is for the damage to increase with the level of the person throwing them. Failing that for there to be level 1, 10, 20 , etc. versions of throwables like there are with weapons
---
Not quest. Right now you can share a rank 1 card, but to share a 2 you need 6 charisma and so on till rank 5 at 15 charisma.
---
However you can only share 1 card at a time. So at charisma 6, you could share a rank one or rank 2 card.
---
Normal terminals - fine. 
---
Anything Terminal Atomic Shop related - seem to have such tiny screens. I use max FOV and its almost impossible to read the terminal screens. 
---
Not to mention the ammo converter literally required you to go through 4 different screens to scrap 1 bit of ammo. It could be far simpler. Could've just been a trade menu that would've been far easier
---
A friend in game is having the same problem, I'll pass this fix along.   
---
Now if I can only figure out why my camp allies stopped giving out dailies since the patch. I could swear I read in the patch notes there was a fix for this, although I wasn't having any trouble until after the recent patch.
---
For me the grind is not worth it..
---
My standard +25% fire rate minigun and final word 50.cal murders everything in seconds and ammo is cheaper, my T-65 is just as tough and can carry a lot more..
---
It just is not worth the grind required.
---
41
---
Nothing wrong with lvl 40 heavy 3 star armor friend. And not everyone else is obsessed with min-maxing, and not everyone who has played since Beta is lvl 500
---
An event not being public just means you don't get free fast travel to it. Anyone can still join it.
---
I'm so glad I never spent bullion on those plans, cause wow do the floater grenades suck.
---
Exactly. Hate to break it to you, but content takes time. Especially with the pandemic situation, it might be a nice excuse to blame stuff on but it halts/impedes progress by a LOT.
---
Bought this game 3 months ago, and yes wish there’s more endgame content but I can’t complain, the content so far has been worth my money.
---
Just a shame FO1st is so bad but you need it if you’re the type to hoard stuff or want to live stress free...
---
Heavy Guns and Automatics are honestly the superior build in this game, if you can keep them fed. 
---
Melee has the damage, but obviously requires you to get close, and pistols (guerrilla you can just be straight better with auto rifles) and non-auto pistols and rifles are honestly painful to play. Damage just isn’t good enough without sneaking.
---
I remember when I started doing encrypted’s someone or a group of people would come in, start it immediately, we’d fail, then spam me calling me trash :)
---
To fix that I had to scrap their chair or whatever and as I did I failed a quest I didn't even have, then I built the punks radio and he gave me a fresh quest.
---
I'm at 0 because i haven't bothered to login.
---
When you hit level 50, you'll be able to start respec'ing your character. For each level above 50, you can move one point around. It may take some time, but you can do it.
---
20, although I gave up trying after a few days until yesterday when I saw that Bethesda was adding more daily challenges. 
---
I have hope again that I can catch up on the weekends because I work during the week and can't get on every day.
---
I never get to play that event with more then 1 other person and that's with waiting 20mins. I'm pretty sure people actively avoid it on my sessions for some reason
---
Aw congrats mate. Very nice.
---
The only scrip he's getting from me is for Legendary Modules. Those things are never on sale.
---
So I'm salvageable? Good to know.
---
I just want legendary modules and steel off them
---
They freaking  announce it over the loudspeaker when one spawns, and it has a massively bright fluorescent green glow, unlike every other mole miner in the event 😆
---
I always either go back to my camp or at least check the map before I log off. I hate when that happens to me and I also don't want to miss out on a potential sale
---
At 63 you have plenty of time to swap them around, not all is lost, one at a time but it gets done quicker than you think :-)
---
Yeah - they added that early on (thank goodness) - again, you'll only be able to move one point, per level, but at least you don't have to start over.
---
The numbers on Gauss weapons are fully charged numbers, before multipliers or damage resistance taken into account.
---
Bloodied weapon damage scales based on YOUR current health. The most typical health percentage players get down to is 19%. The really crazy ones go down to 9% or even 4%.
---
When I see people standing at an event spot with no event running, I assume they just finished and are busy looting and emoting ... 
---
If you’re in a team do the “join me” emote
---
the floater grenades should be sellable too.
---
47
---
Aside from some ammo and a fresh level 50 guy buying a few basic uny pieces same here. Not too surprising given what's been going on and the sudden influx of new players.
---
Take the bastards to court. You’re legally entitled to do so and sue them. Maybe then they’ll up their game. No pun intended.
---
“Finally....”.  I cant get his voice out of my head.   I like the Flux idea too.
---
Over repair it with weapon artisan, gunsmith, and pray. Simple fix
---
Press 'F' to pull finger.
---
Sorry it was me jus because had no other gun, but from now on i will bring something weak.
---
Just sell them in your vending machine. I love camp hopping to see what other plans people have for sale.
---
Id be happy with legendary crafting for all weapons and armor if they were tradable.
---
Trading can be fun and it hurts when I roll something amazing and its not for my character and I have to scrip it.
---
I'm okay with grinding to get what I want but the fact there is so much RNG to get a good build is what hurts this game for me. Let me eventually with great effort craft the perfect items that I want.
---
Sir, if you would have seen my modded skyrim, you would immediately take it to the barn and free it with a double shotgun :D  
---
Bethesda is used to that modders solve the problems and make the game better. sigh ... thats why skyrim is so great, thats why oblivion and morrowind are still playable, other fallouts as well.  
---
I hope they realize and thank modders for fixing and keeping their games alive ( if they have not done it yet.  
---
Enough negativity :)  
---
I hope that they allow us to make our own servers with our own rulles and our own mods. Separate progress from private and official servers :)
---
:´(  
---
PS: I still see the main problem in the ENGINE they are using and that cant be changed in the middle of game lifespawn. :(
---
Nuka cola!
---
Stealth sniper builds are pretty good as well, for the folks who commit to them. Get a good instigating sniper weapon (like a lever, gauss rifle or similar) and even fairly tough enemies will get one-shotted.
---
However, being able to go full-auto on large mobs just feels awesome. The real downside though is the amount of ammo you end up needing to feed the addiction. 5.56 doesn't grow on trees - and with my Quad, I can easily go through a few thousand rounds per day just doing the dailies.
---
How do you not start it?
---
Are we playing the same game? 
---
For me, when it rains my character looks horrendous. I mean it looks like I made out of metal and whenever my character is wet I look reflective, almost. And I’m covered in this oily silver liquid. Does not look good at all imo. 
---
What platform do you play on? Maybe that’s the issue. I play on the Xbox One X with 4K and it still looks terrible.
---
AWESOME shots! \*thumbsup\* you can feel the grim determination of the shovelguy against the sheepsquatch... or his desperation...
---
It feels weird dropping them, y'know?
---
The ammo machine can't even make 2mm and it released with the DLC that introduced all new weapons that exclusively use 2mm....good luck getting Ultracite :-)
---
Don't even get me started on the assaultron event; 
---
Two times already since I started playing a few weeks back had to literally become the conduit for ALL pythons because people were so scared of using stimpacks and whatever else they had.
---
Like... really? Are you that afraid to use stimpacks to help get the event done? Its embarassing. Since then I've gotten better gear from trading and working my ass off, and these days I just burn down the assaultron when I get the chance via vulnerability.
---
Thanks for the reply. Green Thumb seems to work better for me on a private server. Go figure. 😂
---
Lord I would love to have a higher scrip exchange rate. I have way too many legendaries because I've been doing Wastelander main quest and they drop like mad.
---
I totally forgot that.  Yeah, IKR.
---
Yeh I used my tomahawk and it didn't even landed and I died
---
Nice! Food for thought, unarmed builds can kill the mirelurk queen in 1-2 hits.
---
34
---
Bruh, as a team leader I can only send out the "scared" emoji so many times! I feel that a lot of players don't understand the purpose of the new public teams. If you join a team for events and the leader is at an event, then that's where you should be! Not killing rad stag to grill later on. I get it its easy to be distracted by the shiny light of everything but dammit if im sending out a fear signal several times, come help your boy out..
---
No body buys them. I have a bear arm plan, and healing factor recipe for 10k and a fixer plan for 4.5k
---
What's nuka cola?
---
Yeahhhhh  uh, it's not even on public server yet.
---
Had someone try to initiate the earl Walker quest, ended up having to talk to them and let them know they kinda wasted a nuke on it... rip
---
Bonkers isn't it, I mean who thought that was a good idea and who was the moron who signed off on it? lol
---
Hmm, maybe adjust your brightness? I'm on PS4 Pro but I'm set for performance because I don't have a 4k TV.
---
I don't have this trouble.  What are the specs on the gun?
---
fuck, I find it harder and harder to avoid f1st. But the bugs, stability, and scarcity of high rad fluids, makes it nearly impossible :/
---
Anyways, thanks for the reply.
---
Bigger oof, I already picked up all the Flux type notes in preparation. You're giving me the feeling that I'm glitched out of this.
---
im convinced that a lot people don't understand the bonuses. i don't think they realize that event xp literally only counts towards the xp received for completing the event. I also don't think many people understand the impact of intelligence on XP.
---
that said, it could just be that those people were just looking to team up for the related perks, rather than for the group bonus itself.
---
a reason i play without any music is HEARING what goes on around me, especially when sneaking. saved my A\*\* a lot of times.
---
Not me, level 481 with 2000 hours and I’ve never made an alt.
---
Collection : [sad beep] probably when he overhears you talking.
---
Found someone with a bloodied faster fire rate Gatling laser in the store and while debating internally for about 10 seconds the entire base disappeared.
---
He had a bloodied LMG too :( I was about to clean out his shop
---
...a supermutant behemoth turned wendigo... \*GULP\*
---
Why lock it if no one can access your ammo points?  Unless I'm not thinking of the right generator.
---
Explosive weapons break quicker and laser break quicker with or with gunsmith.
---
Int bonus on xp hard caps at 25 so anything after that is worthless but with my unyielding bloody build plus inspirational, well rested, cranberry relish i get about 290 xp for a level 62 ghoul kill. And this is not even pushing it with magazines and bobbles. Events that spawn waves are insane amount of xp like guided meditation when multiple people are there to spawn more.
---
There should he a cap bank.
---
Beth let's you store your access caps while loosing like 10% in a storage fee but you can hold millions
---
I got the failed quest when I scrapped the old man's chair, still didn't work with the guitar lady "waited 2 days" and then trying the old man again still does not work. I'll give the radio guy a try.
---
Sigh...
---
-
---
*Unzips.*
---
I did my first event yesterday after reaching lvl 8. They were level 16 and 19. Holy shit that was fun.
---
I'm having fun. I'm actually looking forward to playing tonight when I get home. 
---
Saturday morning my 4 year old daughter got up early so I hopped on while she ate breakfast. She brought her plate up to the couch and sat with me. I was working on adding a house to my camp for the first time and needed wood so we hit the lumber mill. We had so much fun sneaking around when it was night in game waiting for something to jump out and we would scream together and just laugh and laugh. 
---
"Dad I'm worried about skellintons". 
---
"No skellintons baby dont worry." 
---
"Good zombies arent scary anymore. You get em all." 
---
Then my son came down, who is 6,and thought I had some wierd minecraft skin pack. Next thing I know both babies are on each side of me in my chair as we explore Appalachia while wifey got to sleep in.
---
Sorry - this was long. I'm recently 100 percent sober (stopped before drinking became a daily problem due to  pandemic) and this was one of the best moments I've had since making that decision. It was a perfect morning.
---
At the chamo hunting rifle
---
I’ve had the same problem with my lever action, missing an entire clip up to the reload with 90% plus accuracy the whole time.
---
It’s far less common than with the gauss, to be sure, but it seems to happen with any semi-auto rifle that can be quickly fired.
---
It actually also happens with auto rifles as well, its just harder to notice as it tends to correct itself by the 10th or so shot. On a lever action or gauss that stands out because that’s 2 clips.
---
I don’t know why people have team fill on if they’re not going to... play as a team! I was playing the other night and a teammate and I were on the elevated bridge/tracks in Morgantown, when he noticed a couple people below us and started shooting at them. I started shooting at them too, but I had no armor, so I was easily downed. Instead of reviving me, when I was literally RIGHT NEXT TO HIM, he jumps off the bridge to continue shooting. WTF?
---
Plan it out.  Research what type of character you want.  Heavy, mele, rifleman, sneaky etc this will help you detain what perks you need and which special to invest in
---
So basically free flux is what you are asking for.
---
[Drink. Some. Water.](https://youtu.be/lTYwIGcHicM)
---
Most events don't start until you do something to start them. They pop up on the map but won't actually do anything. Radiation Rumble, for instance, pops up but then there's like a 10 min timer where someone has to talk to Marion or it just expires. Same for Encryptid: someone uses their key and it pops up on the map for everyone to see but they still have to use the terminal to actually start the event and that has an 8 min timer or something.  
---
Unless I'm in a full group and I know we can handle it, we usually wait until the timer is almost expired or until we have a lot of randoms showing up.
---
Sell them for cheaper. I price stuff to sell, I don't price to make in game money. I just don't see why people sell stuff for that much. All my plans are marked 10-50 caps. No items in my vending are over 1k and I still have 12k caps and counting.
---
This is an amazing idea. I'm going this from now on. Buy a few really cheap items so they can't max but they know someone is gonna buy something bigger
---
I like when they shoot at you stocking *your own vendor*...
---
If the vendor is being used most camps have plenty of chairs. I just take a seat... Get my Well Tuned going... I can wait to see the list of mounted head plans and holiday dupe items.
---
I have a 4K TV also and I made my own custom picture setting. And on every other game that supports 4K looks stunning, lighting wise. 
---
But with 76 the lighting looks good when I’m outdoors and it’s sunny. But otherwise it looks pitiful.
---
10% boost on everything is objectively better than 100% boost on event payout only.
---
Instigating combat shotgun and I can take out almost anything short of a scorchbeast with one shot and with a higher carrying capacity because I’m not in power armor or carrying around fusion cores. Just saying.
---
It was under Misc Structures
---
If you make something time limited, then obviously it encourages a 'hey, I got the thing!' mindset and a small sense of pride for whomever put the effort in at the time. 
---
So, in a sense, it does effect me and anybody else who already has them. Because they're now less exclusive, and our effort at the time was kinda pointless. It's not like I'm sitting here frothing at the mouth, as you seem to be envisaging, but being annoyed about this isn't in the least bit irrational.
---
That that's my issue atm too, I want to change my character over to a new build but I'm not having any luck getting the right weapons or armour! I want some light unyielding armour but high level only heavy seems to drop.
---
Got it all up and running bud, thanks again for the script, it's *way* easier lol.
---
If that’s the case I bet it’s some BS like the game is showing 95% because that’s “max” but it’s really according to the game files supposed to be over 100%, (say 105%) so it freaks out and actually does -5% or some shit like that.  This engine has had that problem (hidden numbers actually being negatives and reversing what the thing is supposed to do) in a dozen other places, so why not vats too, right?
---
My main characters camp is just north of the Radiation Rumble event and east of WS and I sell half of what's in my vendors every time I turn my vendors back on. 
---
My camp on my character that's in the forest sells almost nothing even though it always has similar stock!
---
was in lewisburg, some level 22... was the time of the game where mobs spawned based on the level of players around, so you could encounter a level 80 mirelurk queen in the toxic valley and so on. in lewisburg, on the tracks of the mistress of mysteries, i encountered a troup of ghouls, and was attacked. as i backpedaled before them in the street, they got my locked in a corner and all of a sudden some greenish glowing fiend, squatting on the floor, very fast, charged and killed me with ONE hit. didnt know that the wendigo was a real threat at that time...
---
Like other than the “favorite” option you can tag your weapons/armor with? It will give you an extra prompt in case you accidentally select to scrap it
---
I can't even play NW because of mods lol
---
they are forcing you to do them??? oh no :(
---
This needs higher visibility.  Great tip!
---
Gave up on all explosive but molotovs, plasma. (great for robots) I have a ghoul build, (most mutations) spec for demolition only. Only combat skill. Quite entertaining.
---
No they don't, I get non legendary a few times a week and always do it when I see it pop up. Disappointment follows by not getting my level 5 BFFR pipe pistol.
---
Which is different from free scrap, ammo or fertilizer in what way?
---
My arteries are clogging
---
Lol oops damn you russian mule
---
Same unless it's a good bloodied or junkies it's under 500 caps
---
People melting the queen aren’t running bloodied. The queen getting killed that quickly is because of “magic” weapons, which literally any build, even melee, can use. I have an instigating FFR LMG that can kill a legendary level 80 scorchbeast in 1, maybe 2 seconds. You still haven’t made any counter argument to me from earlier, too. Almost you just don’t have one.
---
Yeah it was a bit of an anticlimax after doing it for the first time lol
---
He was probably only on for the revive 2 player score challege, prbly died happy if he did manage to help the  other guy.
---
You know what companion could have repetitive dialogue and no one would have a problem with?
---
Dogmeat.
---
Under what category can I find those?
---
I bought them with bundle, but I can't find them in build mode.
---
Dupers have thousands if not millions of them so what harm would it do to let me get 1 of each every hour?  I support this idea 👌
---
YOU ARE A PIECE OF SCRAP
---
I'm on xbox so I'm lucky and have direct messages
---
People can still use your vendors when they're unpowered, they just wont appear on the map
---
This is not true. It keeps going well after 25 INT, but the amount of bonus XP is lower. For instance, my INT without Berry Mentats is 56. If I take a Berry Mentats to get my INT to 61 and kill a Super Mutant Warlord, I get 40 extra XP for the kill.
---
Haha like... you'll walk through whitesprings like that guy at the begining of 28 days later going "someone..? *anyone*?"
---
I'm surprised I don't see Raider Punk more often. He's the least annoying one imo.
---
Lol.  I just had a couple to deal with at the purveyor.  One dude tried to get revenge with a Minigun:).  Best part is he actually uses mysterious savior so I got kills 2 and 3 almost simultaneously.
---
Automatic weapons also benefit significantly from the -50% AP cost on automatic receivers, that stacks additively with other AP reduction mods (e.g. hardened+reflex sight is 100-15=85% AP cost overall, but automatic+reflex is 50-15=35%, or 70% normalized, so the reflex sight is relatively more beneficial in the latter case). And they work very well with VATS builds.
---
I had to do this the other day. Hit max caps, so had to swap to private and disconnect the vendors lol
---
Thank for that, I had no clue! Still learning something new even after hundreds of hours in this game!
---
Flux farming is still very much a thing and you can always fire your own nukes.
---
30, can do the dailies for today and tomorrow later, though. If I manage to quit on time at work
---
Because the scrap and such you get are minor easy things to get anywhere in the world. They also at least have it be be used you d hit a robot going out looking for this. 
---
How are you going to explain stable flux just appearing? Because you’d also need hardened, glowing and HIF. So four things that only appear during a nuke zone. 
---
And your comparing that to the same as some free scrap that’s found literally everywhere in the game. 
---
Right, got it.
---
I use nukes and dragons f76 build planner it's awesome 10/10 and free
---
Give you one guess who the idiot was.... surname rhymes with coward
---
I'll look into it
---
I have ALL my plans, whether rare or common, for between 1 and 11 caps. Seeing ULT plans sit for days in my vend at 1 cap is telling.
---
the two times i encountered him during scorched earth events it was.... cannonfodder... first time with my rifle alt i could land a few shots, enough to get XP and loot, profitting from a handful of highlevels stomping it into oblivion and the slugbusters enormous range. second time with my heavy mainchar the WC was caught stuck between the trees of the grove while fighting ONE level300+ and i could flank it with 1000 rounds out of my armorpiercing crippling minigun...
---
I always wonder how many people are waiting for other people to join but no one ever makes the first move...
---
True, I spent a bit of a time with a combat shotgun while leveling. They are powerful. But too up close and personal for me, I like to keep my distance. That's why my first impulse was rifle/sniper, yet very fast realized that nah, bullet storm is waaaay more fun :D
---
So selfish... If I had found anything more than a melee weapon in my match, I would have been more active in the fighting. Also, isn't today's challenge to literally revive teammates? Ridiculous.
---
I only join them if there’s 2-3 people already there. 
---
Just completed Project Paradise for the first time yesterday; Encryptid for the first time last week!
---
I would be completely ok if it required you to feed it Nuclear Materials + Plants and you get the corresponding Flux.  That way it’s not ”free” for anyone worried about it.
---
Hell, I’ll buy/trade right now if you have quantity and the price is right.
---
TBH I accidentally triggered encrypted cause i was doing a quest and I did not kow that when i summoned that murderbot it would also summon 10000 other murder bots and start an event.
---
I'm so torn about flux. I feel there's a need to farm it and I can keep my vendor churning and the caps coming in... But launching a nuke.... Getting Rad fluids.... It's such a pain in the dick hole when I'll only make a few hundred per.... And that's if anyone even bothers to buy it as most long time players be rolling in the shit. 
---
I just cater to the bloodied hordes and one or two of those decent rolls will make me more than several hours of flux farming sales. Heck my 5.56 ammo flies as it is without even bothering to invest in ultracite ammo productions.
---
Rather than ammo being added, please Beth make all the fluids and mass etc drop guaranteed on every critter in a blast zone. I hate getting 8,000,000 Unstable Flux types but 3 Rad fluid on a lap.
---
Someone popped a lunchbox during SBQ and it was the 50% XP 
---
Man....that was a fun hour of grinding afterward...
---
All I'm saying is "don't give me crap for trying to do the same thing"
---
Scrapping the old man's chair and bringing in the radio guy immediately worked, thanks for the suggestion!
---
Or the glitch when you die right at the end of the sbq fight, can't respawn and lose the ability to get everything you just earned
---
Not had any problems other than occasionally forgetting to re-epuip it.
---
I was the same. I get 1st for a month then cancel. I load up the scrapbox in that time. I have 1st right now so if you're on Xbox you are welcome to join my world.
---
Update your mods
---
This is the moment I like to start cooking and eating in real life and now and then press some button in my controller, so that the game doesn't kick me out of server.
---
70 pounds?  I have a character that sells only ammo, aid, and plans (with 0 mounts, all decent stuff like weapon/armor mods and PA plans) and has easily 600 pounds of plans in stash.
---
If only it was a SCORE challenge! :)
---
*Daily: Kill 3 Impatient Pricks*
---
Marsupial is plenty good enough for my high ground needs
---
You've been friend zoned.
---
That none of them require a nuke to be launched to be acquired
---
That fertilizer, random bits of scrap and ammo generation aren't an endgame resource that create jetpacks or modify a gun to have its best possible damage output.
---
Yeah! Honestly ... I haven’t really been in a private world since the Fasnacht critter fix! Before critters spawned in the public world again, the private servers were the only way to complete the Tadpole badges. Even then, I would log out as soon as I got what I needed. It’s too lonely in the private servers now 😆
---
Yes, true. Feeding it, alone, can be a big deal for some people. I am lucky enough that I can craft plenty of 5.56 with my higher level character that also needs to craft plenty of .50 round for himself. Already, up to level 34, i think I burned through something like 3-4k rounds (with first handmade straight up from level 15)...
---
I just go around and seriously loot everything, move all lead/steel/gunpowder/acid to my main char, craft and come back with 5k ammo each time :)
---
I'd like to sell plans to a vendor for a chance to roll on another plan. Like 10 mole gauntlets for 1 chance at a PA plan or something.
---
I played with my roommate and we were there and he was off a bit from me and I hear him yell from his room, "WENDIGO, WENDIGO, OMG" and we took off sprinting like mad. Haven't been back there since.
---
This would be great! Cra1cdeal3r is my xbox name
---
Yea its would be easier if people join up but seems no one wants to join so most of the time you are solo
---
Just throw them away or give them to low level players. You don't NEED to sell everything.
---
If i'm browsing a vendor or restocking my own and someone starts hitting/shooting at me. I will get up, walk to kitchen and start making coffee and a sandwich. And propably take a quick shower.
---
In what way has flux farming become a thing of the past other than through your personal perception and laziness
---
I haven't used the sneak perk in forever. Put the points towards Mister Sandman and Escape Artist.
---
That’s mean.
---
And even then the "4x" is for the bond count. It's only a 200% XP bonus.
---
😂Yeah. I've done that. Then I kick myself. Lol
---
I would not be too surprised if it was pushed back in response to PTS feedback. Any sort of major balance overhaul can easily prove to be controversial among long time players. Then again, maybe this update is considered important enough to be released this fall that it is launched anyway, unless serious bugs are found.
---
No more currencies.
---
NO MORE CURRENCIES.
---
There really needs to be a persistent message that pops up on your screen as soon as someone clicks on your vendor. It should remain in the corner until they leave. I travelled to a camp yesterday on PC that had tons of stuff for sale but they logged off as soon as I clicked on the vendor. They were in the camp too. Their loss as I like to drop thousands on ammo.
---
Although their post is proof that linguistic accuracy isn’t always required for communicating what is intended.
---
It would have to be legendary for it to be 5x unyielding.
---
Fallout 76 IS outdated.
---
I tried that, it said it cannot open the file and to make sure a disk is in the drive I specified &gt;.&gt; I feel like this is more microsoft issue than bethesda
---
It’s called “grenadier” it’s a perk
---
I’m just here. I don’t actually play the game anymore. Oh well
---
It would be neat if we had a BoS scribe in the Fractured Steel dlc ask for unused plans and give you a small cap reward in return like the ones in Fallout 3.
---
I send them to a friend via PS messages then open the PS messages app on my phone and save them. Haven't found out how to access the capture gallery from my phone yet.
---
Patch 22 is planned to be released in September, according to the [latest road map](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg). Probably more towards the end of September, since the previous season still has an event until the 9th, and fall can be considered to begin only on the 22nd.
---
I would try to find how you like to play, what weapons do you gravitate towards?  Once you know your preferred play style you can build from there.  I wouldnt worry about being the most OP build out there, any decent build works in game.
---
I use nukes and dragons F76 character planner it's so useful. Remember, after lvl 50 you can still get new cards or swap special points so it's never too late to persue a new/different build.
---
I run with a bloodied unyielding build and get 3k damage, not because I wanted to destroy everything I see in one hit but because I wanted to see if melee was viable in game during the stress test, that was a big question back then. Plus, it's nice never worrying about ammo.
---
I've gotten the arktos backpack, bear arm plan and the two bear arm moda plans with only one or two left alive. Usually we only have one left because no one helps, they just stand on top of the trough :(
---
Have you tried ultracite plasma, ammo should be cheaper overall
---
If I'm the only one repairing the extractors, I one-shot the legendaries as payment. Play the full event, don't just show up for the legendaries.
---
And for some reason they decided that they can’t be wallpapered either.
---
I've noticed that a lot of specular maps seem to be way *way* too strong, plus their behaviour just seems to be straight up wrong. 
---
Have you ever noticed with clothing how they get shinier the darker it is? Isn't that like, the complete reverse of how that should work? It's as if though by default speculars/normals are maxed and the presence of light negates the effect.
---
On PS4, saw a lot of vending camps with very few items listed over the weekend. I think a lot of people are grinding the legendary run so hard they’re not getting around to restocking their machines. I’ve been on the hunt for fuel and .50 cal with caps burning a hole in my pocket.
---
This.
---
This could easily be fixed by only allowing the one that put in the recall card to start the event. I don't know why it's not a thing.
---
PP Maybe for &lt; lvl 40 caracter. Encrypted is initiated by player so wait/no wait depends on what he wants. Radiation Rumble never tried solo but i suppose there will be no so many gouls around so it is possible to do solo.
---
Btw PP is the perfect way to farm legendaries and xp by doing it solo.
---
If its part of an old bug that came back up, it may have gone back to its spawn point
---
I can craft some for you but ill be on later, i can lauch another nuke if you need more flux and whats your level. Btw t51 has higher damage resistance but t60 looks better, especially with camo or BoS paint, i wish t60 was better than t51, if your on ps4 i can give you an emergency protocol t60 chest, level 40 but theres hardly any difference. i can also chuck calibrated shocks on your X-01 and put the quantum paint on it or military. let me know
---
Bored of it?  Moved on?
---
Charisma also increases the amount of XP and Caps you earn when helping someone else complete a quest. 
---
Also worth noting just for clarity, is while increases to stats don’t give you the ability to slot higher perk cards, the bonuses do affect existing perk cards you have.  So for example if you are equipped with Barbarian, getting a +1 STR gear also gives you a bonus to DR
---
Players want you to join. Building teams are the unofficial solo player teams. We're just on a team for the benefits, but not playing together. If I come across one of my "teammates", we'll wave to each other then be on our merry. If people start following me around taking my kills while I'm leveling up, they get kicked.
---
I love how people give a sign about spawn and people start punching mole ,so everyone could get loot, but most of the time some high level prick with laser machine gun just evaporate mole in one second. I hate such players.
---
That's where I've seen him too.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I'm a level 28 and new player but right now I'm currently tilting towards a tanky rifleman build but might switch to an automatic tank build.
---
They don’t care about fun they just want to melt the queen in 6 seconds hurr durrr. It’s some sort of challenge complex, have to be the best in every game even it means breaking the game. Yeah I never understood it either. “Lemme go make a build and exploit some mechanics that trivializes the whole game because I’m Op af and everybody hates me in events, but at least I’m god yayyy”
---
One thing I liked about New Vegas was the different types of ammo you can use on a gun. I think explosive rounds in a 2 shot explosive would just be silly though. 😅
---
I'm a bloodied build, but I get rid of my rads before collecting ore, I wear my stealth suit and I still do quite a lot of damage without my rads and full set of unyielding. I don't usually have to kill anything or kill anything alone with so many protecting. My only issue is being incumbered. When the event is over it's easy to refill your dad's given where you are.
---
I know, right. The random legendary is crap. It takes so many legendary modules just to get a good roll on the SS armor or gauss weapons. After 120+ modules, I finally have a full set of Unyielding armor, but 2 pieces are 2 stars with "increased durability" as the bonus. It sucks because they have less durability than the other pieces.
---
about 12, new to the game with about 20 hours (According to steam)
---
Atom shop paints and/or favoriting items prevents this.
---
Is there anything better than RAW asbestos?
---
now that you mention it, how come everyone has tighty whiteys? I would pay up to 500 caps for a green speedo like the one Borat wears.
---
Yeah, I’ve beat every quest in the game that I know of and don’t want to grind gold and score. I tried collecting rare outfits but a friend become a duper and tbh it discouraged be how easily he could get the rare weapons and items I’d have to rng grind for.
---
Thing of the past? You can't farm it anymore? I'm new and I currently need cobalt flux for underarmor
---
I keep having to offload truckloads of the stuff onto a mule. I don't even craft it, the queen constantly craps flux.
---
But how do you get all the ore while also defending the scavengers at the same time?
---
Had someone like that while I was tocking my ammo vendor, like bro go ahead and waste your ammo, ill sell it back in a minute
---
i shot him in the leg with a shotgun thinking it would only damage him, not straight out kill him. what a wild ride of emotions lol
---
I think their solution was to add Scrip to many of the daily quests, so there is reason to go out and do some of the dailies like Big Game Hunter even though there isn’t much other reason to do them.   
---
I also don’t know how well it would work out if they gave out a legendary drop AND some type of scrip note.  it would have to be one or the other I would imagine.
---
I wasn't even thinking about that lol. I just meant slugs for range really
---
The trick is to find the spawn first. Usually if the supervisor is killed almost immediately then it’s not hard to find where they spawned. So defend the extractors but remember to stay near the spawn to mark it.
---
I’ve had that happen sooo many times. Or when I just get there and gone. I’m like, just my luck. Lol
---
I like the author, but they all need more lines.
---
Oh you mean space jumanji?
---
so that's what the W in WRPG stands for. Waiting!
---
I did yesterday with a guy lvl 63 he was dying a lot and doing no damage at all, so it's easy just run killing stuff till the end and fixing the yellow things
---
edit: my bad I got it wrong too..
---
Sent you a message. I've got some guns made up for ya. Going to find some materials to make some armor
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/589](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/589)  ;)
---
I get you, I assumed fallout had a good community based on fallout 4, but have also ran into so many toxic people, but also many who are great.  I'm glad NW is a thing, as I've noticed most the toxic ppl and griefers have moved there.
---
 I dont miss being spawn killed at my camp by someone using legacies that kill in one hit.  At least if I run into a toxic person in NW and they arent in my team I stand on equal ground and only have to deal with them Teabagging my body worse case scenario.
---
Graham
---
Meanwhile I saw a guy tank the legendaries for a full minute each to make sure everyone got a hit in.
---
What do you sell in your vendor
---
Love it.  One of my preferred methods is to exit the vendor and jump back in before the child is able to spin around and do it.  It's the small things.
---
I'm on xbox too. Do you directly message individuals, or is it possible to send a group message? Just did Line in the Sand. 400 SCORE and went up h a lf a level. It's nuts.
---
One of the main complaints is the lack of content for high level players, but there is actually content, a lot of the events and daily quests are just not worth playing in the late game. Normalization (in theory, if done well) would make better use of content that already exists, if for example low level events and locations could scale up (in terms of both enemy difficulty and rewards) to remain relevant to high level players. And newbies having difficulty in areas like the Savage Divide because of the current level scaling system could also be solved without introducing low level caps that already happened in one of the patches last summer. [ESO](https://steamdb.info/app/306130/graphs/) does seem to have gained a decent number of players after the release of One Tamriel.
---
33 as well
---
When it doubt, sell any legendary gear at 10-15c per scrip. So a 3* weapon at 400-600c for example and put up an advertisement on a Reddit page or group page you're selling scrip at that price. You'll have droves of people coming to your vendor.
---
FYI nuke silo is alot easyer solo then with a team
---
I click on there map dot and hit "send message" (or go to team menu for teammates)
---
And I've never been able to do a group message so idk
---
The raider has sent me to exterminate a flatwoods monster a few times as a part of his daily quests.
---
Otherwise have not seen them at all.
---
another edition of Ape's dumb questions: will double xp affect my settler rep?
---
 Im working through the main story quests, well as far as i can tell i am, and looking to earn that gauss shotty as soon as possible
---
I think legendary loot piles should have a 10 foot flag in them.
---
Why did you start it before your friends were ready?
---
I just wear fall damage armour all the time now at peoples bases. Even the nicest homeowner gets a rando dc every now and then
---
I did the same thing moving from Rifleman to Commando. It's easy peesy now as I take down lvl 68 mutants and ghouls in like 1-3 headshots. I don't fear mirelurk kings anymore or gutsy or assaultrons. Those may take a few more shots but I kite them with Marsupial and a jetpack. The only things I can't solo are the sheepsquatch in Encryptid or the SBQ. I can take down legendary scorchbeasts and random sheepsquatchs in the wild though. Using an automatic fixer and handmade with bandolier to haul around 10k+ ammo is so much better. I'm running full health stealth with Buttressed Vanguard Secret Service armor too, no need for bloodied or junkies.
---
Yeah, haven’t even tried getting any of the SS stuff yet, been trying to get decent weapons but the RNG is killing me. Running around right now with a 1* bloodied plasma caster because the game doesn’t think I deserve any better I guess. Get plenty of 3* Stalkers, Troubleshooter, Ghoul/Mutant slayers though. 😒
---
The bug that allowed you to collect hundreds of thousands of Atoms is not only still not patched but nobody was banned for it.
---
I’m confused. You mean I shouldn’t start an event solo within seconds of it appearing on the map?  But the event counter says I only have 29:55 left before I can start it; there’s no time to wait!
---
Ah see im on ps4
---
Grafton monster is always in the river bed between the Charleston trainyard and the power plant.
---
I've only shot at someone twice. But if I travel to someones camp and another player is using the vendor I go else where and come back. 25 minutes later that same player is still on the vendor, I think letting them know their taking too long is fair. I even use area voice chat to try and talk to them.
---
At this point I think they are just griefing the Seller's vendor.
---
A legendary weekend with 500% increased legendary spawn could be a cool event.
---
Is there an Alien? I thought it was just the Flatwoods monster...
---
Grafton Monster has a set spawn just south of Charleston Station
---
Funny story. I was playing with my buddy, who is a lower level, and we were just exploring and he kept saying something was following him. I dismissed him as just being paranoid. He was far behind so I turn around to go see if something actually was following him and it ended up being a mothman. Vanished right as I looked at him.
---
Unyielding bloodied who played since stress test.. yes I'm no where near 1000, not close. But, I am just a casual player.  On the same hand, many did get a head start of a few hundred levels using one of the past exp glitches...
---
I want rifle range
---
It is, but I barely believe that 10% chance. I've yet to fight one, but showed up to a battle just as they took it down.
---
At least the ammo machine will make 200 rounds of 5.56 in just under an hour. I have to craft or buy .45 as it takes 4 hours to make 333 rounds with the machine. It'll only make 1 pound of ammo then stop so you have to be conscious of going back to camp regularly to empty the hopper when making 5.56.
---
it definitely spawns i have fought a handful of them.
---
  i couldn't tell you how the new 10% rate works in compared to the 7% chance at each cell reset.  (if it was a straight buff to spawn chance at cell reset or if its a flat rate per nuke now)
---
I agree, use the free build planner. It helps immensely to know where you are going. Alao decide if you want a stealth/sniper build (max perception), power armor build or heavy weapons build (usually max str). 
---
Take the weapon damage cards for your preferred weapons. Get rank 1 of all three damage cards before upgrading them to 3 stars. The 1st rank is more damage than upgrading 1 card to level 2. Get some mutations and Startched Genes/Class Freak under luck. They really pay off.
---
Ever since the fluid and mass required to craft it has declined drastically. And in that the focus of the game has shifted from Queen fights to other activities. At 2k hours in the game I'm hardly classified as  lazy. How would farming gold to buy such a machine be considered lazy in first place? Seriously, you're bitching about 1 flux  per hour?
---
a mime would meet both of those criteria
---
How about camp lighting? The options are either super, blinding bright or "Is this thing even on?".
---
I just message them saying I want to check or buy what they have.
---
clear signs of trauma there, repetition and oversharing are two
---
gramps got the hard pass when I met him
---
A little bit easier way than jumping off a cliff is to just start right next to the fire. Walk into it just enough to start taking damage, and your partner can revive you without getting in the fire. Rinse and repeat for the two of you. You’ll be done before the fire moves and it doesn’t take you climbing up hills that might be in more popular areas. Also, remember you don’t need a stimpak to revive, so no boxes needed.
---
Now if only we had a way to find creatures easy enough.
---
A new player used the invite to trade button to let me know they’d like to see what was in my vendor while I was stocking it. I was impressed. Pure grace.
---
I've never heard of anyone having such a thing before.  At the risk of sounding like a jerk are you sure you are using a chemistry bench and not a tinkers bench, or just overlooking it?  Nuked flora should show up right between healing and science projects.  
---
I'm assuming you have picked flux at some point too?  Could be something where you need to pick each type to unlock crafting for that type possibly?  Kind of similar to how basic cooking recipes unlock from picking up different meats and plants.
---
Because it gives you 10 minutes after initiating to recall. I'd like to use that time to allow others to join
---
Try long scope
---
Want a scope on my mole miner claw for rifle range melee build could be nice...
---
I'd there any way to get different cards? I don't think I got any "rifleman"s, although I have the shotgun and automatic rifles cards.
---
Im pretty new, what exactly is a mule character ?
---
If you have unyielding gear it's worth using even if you're not normally a low hp build as the extra intelligence will boost your levelling. It can make a huge difference.
---
Just dont share sun kissed :-)
---
Nah, they just need to remove the daily scrip limit...
---
Ballistic=heavy metal
---
Energy=heavy leather
---
Overall=heavy combat/scout
---
Mixed= heavy combat chest, heavy leather legs, heavy metal arms
---
And outfit will cover the ss. You might be confusing it with the stealth suit that you cna not wear an outfit over
---
Tossed them out for newbie, if else, sell it for 50 caps per pieces.
---
I 100% agree!  I tried to buff up my weightless armor set during the event this weekend and now I'm still sitting on 20 pieces I wont need/use that I cannot get scrip for.
---
i dont even bother with uranium fever. im level 640, i dont belong there other than to afk for T notes
---
They would cap that too, i would honestly prefer just junk and maybe have 3 stars give one or two legendary modules when scrapped
---
I am close to the same amount of hours and I took down a Flatwoods Monster this weekend in Savage Divide.  That was my 3rd.
---
Sheepsquatch, 3-4 as one was spawning in Welch pretty regular.
---
Mothman 3 times, on Thursday of last week he showed up in the mire.
---
The Grafton Monster is super common, the one at Hemlock Holes always spawns for me daily on my acid runs.
---
The others mentioned, pretty common as you said.
---
It’s all luck but since Wastelanders, I have had more sightings or encounters.
---
To be fair they can’t yet handle those events nor have enough caps to spend
---
Yea good thing it's not a ranged weapon
---
&gt; it would take away from the luck element of a dream build.
---
Good.
---
Plenty of other games have ways of targeting/rerolling your loot so you can mitigate shitty luck and it works beautifully.  You still have to find an item with the attribute you want, and other item with all the **other** stats that you want.  So it's not as if luck is completely eliminated.  
---
Stripping away *some* layers of RNG isn't a bad thing.
---
My main is using gauss rifle basically since launch, I cant remember it working correctly ever. Its certainly gotten worse though.
---
No problems, there.  Or they could be waiting for a friend to come with more caps?  Guess I'm speaking more to people that see me approach a vendor and then start jumping/ firing on me.  At that point, one of us has to die.
---
My only gripe is the lack of decent gear in vendors. With so many new players it seems the servers I’m in only have 2-3 high lvl players and thus only a couple of vendors that have any endgame gear. Most of the new player vendors are full of basic weapons and astronomically priced water and stims. I get it they are knew and that’s great to see new players but I just wish there was some type of balancing to the servers.
---
Yea that's why I suggested slugs
---
I want to downvote because I dislike that answer. But thank you for the info 😆
---
Some weapons and armor can only be pulled from the purveyor after a plan is learned.
---
These include but are not limited to: 
---
Wastelanders weapons,
---
Sheepsquatch weapons,
---
The Fixer,
---
SS Armor
---
However, all the weapons and armor from the base game will be able to pull from the purveyor without plans.
---
I never shoot at anyone at a vendor. But if people are taking way too long, I like to go find nearby enemies and coerce them towards the person on the vendor. Then I hide while the person taking forever gets attacked.
---
Few concerns about this:
---
1.  Plans sold by vendors are currently one of the only cap sinks we have.  If you could say take hundreds of chemistry station plans and trade it in for things like the serum plans, then that huge cap sink of the serum plan just went away, and the economy (as fucked up as it is anyways) just keeps those caps in there. 
---
2. I feel the more we give the players ways to turn things they get into other things they want, the less players will rely on each other for trade/vendors and reduce the chances players even do some events.  Let’s take the Fixer plans - assuming that was one of the plans offered, why would people run encryptid if you could just trade in some plans you pick up from other methods (Treasure Maps, Found, etc) to get a rare plan.
---
3. When it comes to events, I think allowing people to get the rare plan drops kinda ruins how special they are.  I didn’t get the croc backpack plan, I didn’t get the lion cage, I didn’t get either of the outfits.  I think that’s ok.  I don’t think everyone should have everything, despite how much we want it.    It’s a bit of luck and puts the person in a tough position of “do I use this or sell it/trade it for a ton”
---
4. If the plans aren’t worth anything to players, why should they be worth anything to the vendor?  I’m pretty sure nearly everyone has a ton of the mounted head plans of various types, and quite a few of the furniture plans you can get from doing workshops.  I can’t move most of those plans even selling them at 5 caps a piece. Despite what it says the value of the plan is, they aren’t even worth the maximum value of sold Purified water.  Does it make sense that these common plans that are basically worthless are able to be turned into something that actually has value?
---
I get it.  Eventually it will be time to move on.
---
I thought the forum analysis showed you’d have to work your ass off to reach the end even if you started on day one? Missing two- three-weeks of progress would definitely keep you from reaching the end unless you buy your way there.
---
This has already been tested. You can get legendary versions of weapons you don’t know how to craft. It’s only the DLC weapons that have this requirement. 
---
My main doesn’t know the flamer plan. I have had multiple legendary flamers drop. I kept the 90%RW for the *Set the World on Fire* challenge.
---
I'm level 230+ and still use a 1 star. It's not bad... but not the best. I run a bloodied sniper and 1 hit most mobs. I used to go Vanguard w/ full health and it took 2 shots for most mobs. I think people get hung up on the stars of the weapons. 3 stars are better than 1, but you can still solo things with a 1 star and a decent build.
---
That's true, however if you can land couple 5K or 6K hits on her (sneaky build with chinese armor), I'm pretty sure it'd work 😅
---
No kidding.  I have no problem showing inventory and leaving it open for awhile just so they can get an idea for weapons that are out there.  Not that I have many godrolls,  but as a beginner I always enjoyed seeing what others had and so enjoy passing that forward.
---
PM Sent
---
Thanks man! 😁
---
Only use I find in the floater grenades is the funny noises and being goofy. They definitely need a boost.
---
Did it get buffed or something recently?  I stumbled across one a few weeks ago and it went down like a chump.
---
Same with PA flashlights when you get close to something it’s super bright and you can’t make out what you’re looking at.
---
You have to craft it
---
It's easy to run without weapons just put one leg in front of the other but fast
---
I know... Currently is taking me between 3 to 5 hits
---
All vanilla weapons can and will be rolled out. Only the newer weapons that came with content patches (like fixer) need a plan.
---
Newbie here so just wondering - when ppl say mule, does that mean there's a way to send items back and forth between characters?  Is the stash inventory shared by all your characters or something?  I tend to do a lot of farming so having a "bank toon" like back in my wow days would help!
---
Yeah you still get all base game weapons as drops. It's only a few extra added weapons that need to be learned before they get added. Probably wouldn't make much difference at all. If any.
---
Well thats highly disappointing. I thought maybe i was on to some. You will slightly increase your odds by not learning "dlc" plans, but not by much then.
---
Lol whine more kiddo but this dupe has done wonders for the community it's the most active and friendly I've ever seen it. Luckily whiners like you are hard to come by so keep whining well I get some nice legacies ;)
---
They run off like my dad
---
Yeah I was not being smart about that. Other members educated me with these better approaches. Fire worked great but was slow. Putting down a CAMP, a foundation, then however many steel stairways up that it will allow, followed by a running jump off of the stairway, makes for an easy revive.
---
but I *love* pvping against two shot explosive gatling plasmas
---
No, please do, I hear it's a great way to help out all those players who are having trouble with radiation and are so close to dying lol
---
You can get cards by leveling up or from perk packs. Every 5 levels nets you a new perk pack. When you get a new level, you can choose to either move a point or pick a perk card.
---
Fought him last night with a lvl 19 Noob armed with a spiked baseball bat and wearing a hazmat suit and some mid 100s wearing some gnarly looking power armor. Took us a few minutes. Melee sneak is the way to beat it.
---
Getting xcom flashbacks
---
this has happened to me all the time, I wish people would be considerate to check the map if anybody is at their camp before they log off :(
---
Escape artist and other sneak perks really does make the game a cake walk. I have a Berserker rifleman build and once I hit level 50 things have become shockingly easy with the gear I’d be saving for myself. I had been building with the expectation to die a lot so I stocked up on low level life saving armor, broken it all for 0 DR and invested in revenant 2 for extra damage once I self revived. Turns out I barely ever die now at all. Nothing has a chance to really kill. It almost feels too easy honestly.
---
I have a grassy area behind my C.A.M.P. and I just dump them of back there. They are mostly the mole miners gaunlet and Ultracite armor plans you get from doing the SBQ.  You can't sell them all so might as well dump them.
---
No green stuff here.
---
Folks like that are part of the territory with online stuff alas. The ones who think they're gods gift to the game, think they know it all and best (and want to make sure everyone knows it), those who think that anyone doing 1 dps below the threshold or not using a particular weapon is a peasant, things like that.
---
It has been my experience that they're like that because they like to feel they call the shots, they're in control, they're the ones that people should look to for answers. It strokes their egos essentially. 
---
But the second someone comes along and questions them, turns the tablesor takes that perceived power away from them, they get a dose of their own medicine and thats when the whining starts.
---
Yeah. I tested this myself. Didn't learn any plans at all except fixer and HM. Had a few alright Handmades not a single fixer yet on that character. 
---
In fact across 5 characters and several hundred purveyor pulls i've never had a fixer.
---
I took no position on my feeling of the dupes.  I am against them on principle but nothing more.  But I will help explain my post further if you care to stop with the kiddo insults because I dont got time for that this morning.
---
Character that only exists to Carry items or hold them
---
Ringo star isn't even a real star
---
I’ve seen more legendary Grahms than scorched in the last 6 months.
---
I just drop them at the door of 76.
---
Bruh i would take all of them i need the scrap
---
I wear solar armour and was sharing sun kissed from playing with friends, the other folks in the events team weren't very happy when their guns stopped working :-)
---
Keep your eyes up. They hide in the trees.
---
always check the overgrow sundew grove after a nuke. Apparently it can spawn at intervals of 15 minutes. So you could always keep checking. And if the big screamy boi is there message people on the server to help out (if you need help)
---
Hell they could just reuse the conduit pipes and just have it for water and that would be amazing
---
So i make a new character, do i switch the items to him via a friend or is there a way to do it solo ?
---
Sometimes I will run into enemies that are just stuck inside walls or underground and I cant shoot them, especially with workshop defend events. The flame floater grenades have enough aoe to kill them, thats the only use ive found for them but happens often enough to where im glad I have a few.
---
hahahaha! me and a friend were just talking about how shes getting annoying, he even tried to put her camp item on the roof of his house and she some how teleported right onto her chair
---
I love how mobs sneak up on you sometimes. 
---
One night I'm creeping through the mire, all peaceful and quiet and as I was crouch walking past a small pond a mirelurk queen exploded from the water right next to me and I damn near had a heart attack.
---
I have a hard time understanding why people get so butthurt over missing out on a level 25 one star rolling pin, but this is really just Bethesda's fault for designing the drop system the way it is.  The only monster that I feel is  justifiable to be mad about not getting a shot on is the Queen and you still get decent rewards when you don't anyway.
---
Everytime I hear that line I think of that one Rick and Morty scene in the mini-verse 
---
*flips everyone off*
---
"I told em it means peace among worlds" 
---
Scrap bot is like "Get a load of this guy, I call him scrap all the time and he thinks it's cause I like him"
---
I love that bucket of bolts lol
---
I didn't know you could share perks, I thought the team members could only benefit from certain Charisma team perks, which I don't have. What are good and safe (for other people's builds) perks to share?
---
If not locked, it is not stealing. You are welcome to it. Water and crops too.
---
I just drop them at the door to 76, i dont need 7 ultracite right arm blueprints and a noob probably doesn't either but what harm can it do, if it makes their day better its completely worth it
---
I'll take all that useless flux that you don't need
---
Flatwoods Monster *is* an alien in basically their version of PA. He is not a cryptid.
---
Yeah.... na screw that haha he can stay there :P
---
Yes somehow I would clean water from my clean sink
---
I didn't knooow the gun was loaded  
---
And I'll never, never do it agaaain!
---
Lol you say that but your tones way different bud. I mean you can say what you will but your wrong lol. This has made the community way better and  more wholesome. Ive seen more teamwork/trades kindness in the past week then I've seen playing two months of this game. The only people who seem to hate it are the greedy people who don't want people to have legacies or good guns and keep them to themselves.
---
Hey survival legacy mode then.
---
This. Anything of real value I try to put a skin on it, even if I dont particularly like the skin. Safety stop from me losing those items.
---
It's not a PvP game kid go back to cod
---
I think that they let it go on this long without doing anything speaks volumes on what their response is.
---
30
---
I don't personally use sun kissed any more but have thought about fitting it back in just to share it for all the bloody builds. Personally think they need to be nerfed to hell. I believe the intention of the Bloodied prefix was to save your ass when your about to die, not one shot everything including the SBQ in some cases. Its just gotten rediculus. But that's my two cents no one asked for
---
theyre gonna wait until tuesday..
---
and do nothing...
---
The thing that bothers me the most is when somebody is at the gold press for more than half a minute. Like you can only trade 20 notes. In and out. Easy. There’s literally nothing in there to make you have to make a decision.
---
Go hit something with it. Sounds hilarious.
---
And I missed a few days over the 4th of July weekend
---
I'd buy it 🤷‍♂️  
---
You'd be surprised at the value - *especially* if it has 90rw!
---
its +25% xp per member for completing the event, so you get double xp if bonded in a full team, from the event completion xp
---
if you want more xp from EVERYTHING, go building
---
Nice! That's a fun weapon.
---
Alien-  have never seen.  Probably not in game yet
---
Flatwoods Monster -  have seen him 5 times.
---
Twice he was hanging out in the pool area at Overlook Cabin 
---
Once at the following  places:  Outside Abbie’s Bunker,  near the old diner in the Toxic Dried Lake bed and at the US-13C Bivouac (near West Tek)
---
Mothman:  Seen him many times.  He attacked my crops at my base near Harpers Ferry yesterday.   He has spawned near the Charleston train station , in the Mire along Highway 65 , near the crashed airplane on the cliffs overlooking The Bog and I’ve seen him at Moth Home and at many of the shrines that the cult worships him at.   
---
Also the Wise version always spawns at the lighthouse if you complete the event there.   
---
Snallygaster :  all over the place.   There is a large group at the flooded train yard in the bog. 
---
Grafton Monster:   Alway appears in the river bed across from Poseidon Energy Plant and during the Grafton Day event. 
---
Wendigo:   Appears in Wendigo cave and in the locker room at the Whitesprings golf course most often for me.   Plus various other places such as the Mountain Side bread and breakfast.
---
I mean I guess you could do worse, the damage shouldn’t be too bad with the two effects, and you don’t even need to go searching for a shovel when you do Buried with Honor
---
And just looking at your posts your so salty about this dupe glitch you've even whined to the mods at fed76 your fucken pathetic lol.
---
I shoot a lever, thank you very much.
---
Love all of it.  Never played with so many folks before.
---
Also going outside from an inside exterior without loading (just walking through a doorframe and ending up outside), the game is always too bright. 
---
Always.
---
Out of concern for violating any sub rules regarding exploits, I probably shouldn't post it here. I'll message you.
---
I was so confused by the title,  just a heads up its,  Pied Piper.  I haven't seen this one yet,  but I did finally see the guy being chased by a chicken the other day.
---
I was so excited when I finally got the plans for that because I thought "The Nuka grenade is so great, the Quantum must be AMAZING". Nope, bugged to hell and will never ever be fixed.
---
*Screamin’ Eagles!*
---
There's a lot of frustration around them. They came out and where basically ignored since, which results in frustration since they could be used for features players want. Instead you build one once, play around with it, then forget it exists and dont bother to rebuild it when you change your base around.
---
The legendary in the airport terminal is *named* legendary, but he doesnt have a star. Hes just the terminal crowned boss mob. I was running a new char through last night and noticed the discrepancy.
---
only thing they'll do is what they have been doin, replace dead hamsters in the servers with new ones
---
the weapon market is totally dead, nobody wants "normal" weapons now...
---
If you have 1st you can do it solo. It's a little risky but normally works. One toon drops stuff in container, log out, immediately log back in with other toon. Normally you will go right into same server, pickup item. I do it quite frequently with no issues.
---
My tone is about another part of a broken game being ignored by the people who should care.  If you think the dupe is good then great for you.  This post is about bethesda being accountable for the issues in their game.
---
I actually like it.
---
A few have been picking up my 5 cap plans. Every plan I am finding is going up for 5 caps, regardless of rarity. Most seem to be buying up random junk like wood and steel too, so I am clearing myself out there at 1 cap a piece.
---
Been flying out with level 2s and 3s landing at my base.
---
Hell, my C.A.M.P. always seems to have a few newbies milling about as it is so damn close to the vault.
---
I am not making as many caps as before, but I love the commotion.
---
Everything is scrip and we all have more than enough to turn in everyday.
---
And it can sometimes glitch. My wife and I were turning in Treasury Notes last night on Foundation. I went first, dropped mine off, then backed out. She asked if I was finished yet. I told her I was. She asked me to move. I said I was over near Samuel. 
---
I went to look at her screen and my avatar was in both places. And she couldn’t click on the gold press machine. She had to go to Crater. 
---
Now, it’s probably more common that it’s someone who stepped away. But maybe not.
---
Lol how much caps do you expect a new player to spend?
---
The Flatwood Monster is an Alien
---
I hate people one shotting to be a dick. But this I can get behind. Don't help? Don't deserve the reward
---
Shame I went a to far off with my first char, transforming him into a heavy gunner from a per/agi build took some time, but I still don't regret a thing. 
---
Plus automatics are just waaay more fun!   
---
You can either have \*PEW\* \*click\* \*clack\* \*PEW\*  
---
ooooor....  
---
YATATATATATATATA YATATATATATATATA ....
---
But then it appears in the select wheel, i dont want my armour in the select wheel
---
They could balance it back, Junkies is close ish, but they could buff Mutants to do more damage the more Mutations you have as oppose the flat buff it gives.
---
What is really needed is a system like destiny has where you have some choices and could force all drops to of x type .  Even with just ranged weapons on purveyor 90% aren't what you want or can use
---
Yes. I ran into one after fighting the queen last night....while trying to farm flux.... Alone. Lucky for me this sub is Awsome and when I posted here like 6 guys showed up to help.
---
Happened to me dude was selling fusion cores for cheap , logged off I clipped it , tried to rejoin their world a bit later and bought them cores
---
LIBERTY IS A FARCE.
---
26 and still not trying or paying any attention to the board at all. Just playing and doing my own thing. Not grinding any dalies or anything.
---
I will say, i tried the leather ghillie armor skin yesterday and it is hilariously broken. It says a lot about Bethesda how unsurprised i was.
---
https://youtu.be/QtxKAEMgL6s
---
I'm a little late but here's a link in case anyone else was having trouble hunting this one down ;)
---
lol im in the same boat(pc). i see events pop up that are like level 30+ and i don't mind dying but im not trying to repeatedly die lol
---
Fed76?
---
I'm starting to be convinced that this is actually a bug with the hit percentage displayed not updating.  Usually i have a 95% to head shot but last night, as two muties were walking around looking for me, I was watching the hit percentage dip as they turned their heads and moved around.  It dipped all the way down to 0.  This has always been a thing, but usually not so rapid or frequent.  There was a bush that may have been obstructing my line of sight.
---
Did you know no one bothers with radiation rumble and did you know that people fuck up on Encryptid most of the time
---
get a quad harpoon and flechette, apart from breaking its so cheap and easy with vats.
---
Then perk on gunsmith and the fix guns via shooting luck perk.
---
Especially with unyeilding or stealth armour.
---
Bought what I assume is a 100% duper Bloodied Fixer and have been having a blast completing the SCORE tasks with it
---
I mean it doesn’t happen often, but most of the time (at least for me) I actually see them step away from it to go somewhere else in the area.
---
I don't want to be able to scrap them at a regular workbench, too much room for screw ups. Just raise the limits on what we can sell for scrip in a day to 300 instead.
---
Why you farming legendaries, what for? There is legacy weapons everywhere to be had
---
Sorry the other sub as we can't message it's name on here. Took me 5 minutes of looking to see you hate this dupe glitch you've complained whined to people and mods. People like you are greedy fucks who have no place in this world.
---
I run with weapon weight reduction armor pieces for this very reason. I cannot scrap fast enough over three characters to not have someone weighed down by my precious hoard.
---
So much so that I’ve lost interest unless there are many of us there like SBQ.  No way am I wasting that much ammo again.  They over buffed and rewards aren’t inline now.
---
I made a new char last month and regularly go shopping at vendors and players looking to kit out with camp plans. Holding out for sub 100 cap plans so it drags on. 
---
It’s amazing how common it is that high level players...who presumably have seen hundreds of and understand how legendaries work will still over price the holy shit out of a legd just because it’s 3 stars.
---
I mean to be honest I don’t mind all to much Cos I usually get a 1* from a 3* enemy and they are under levelled so it’s usually I don’t get a hit on the scrip mole miners but yea let the lower levels get a hit on them for sure if not then they assholes
---
Lol they gonna do fuck all, they already fucked up by not doing anything about this before the weekend came. Lol they couldn't turn off the vendors bc all the xbox pass kids would be like "what a shit game the vendors are a gimmick"
---
It's a Junkies, so it is *magic*.
---
Only one I haven't seen yet is the glowing mothman.  I have seen a flatwoods monster take control of three scorchbeasts and their scorched minions. I have bumped into the stalking mothman several times near the aluminium cave East of Harpers Ferry.  He once trapped me in the cave. I have had Vengeful Mothman turn up at my camp above Site Bravo.
---
Unlimited would be a bad idea but letting people scrap legendaries would be good
---
If he was dead them he wouldn't have got 2nd place points. 
---
Your points stop when you die
---
Lol why? Everyone has legacies already we dont need that garbage from murghs
---
Serums 300 caps, the half decent legendaries I find, various junk, lots of stims, all ammo 1 cap, everything is usually cheaper at my vendors than I see anywhere else so it moves faster to save stash space.
---
Same. Same. Same. Same. F
---
I failed my final quest because back in the day the whole server would turn up but nobody was Bloodied or Junkies and the Queen got buffed to invincibility pretty much...
---
Yeah, a lot of the time you can do a couple circuits no problem
---
I would do the opposite, just y e e t
---
How do atom shop skins help? I have atom shop skins on my gun amd it still let me scrap my gun.
---
I'll be online at arround 18.00-18.15
---
It just works.
---
Anyone know if you can marry her like the astronaut or the raiders guy with the radio?
---
The alien is the flatwood’s monster. How do I know? Because one of the challenges, I don’t remember if it was for tadpole or possum. You have to take pictures of certain things. When I took a picture of the flatwood’s monster it also checked off the “take a picture of an alien” so Unless they plan on adding aliens eventually, that’s all we have. 
---
I run into about 4-5 sheepsquatch everyday. Not counting the ones for The event free range. You encounter them often when you go to random event spawns in high level areas. 
---
Mothman, I’ve seen him maybe once a day. Not counting the event where you summon him at the light house. 
---
Grafton Monster, i see him in the locations you mentioned. But since I have no reason to go to those areas, I don’t see him as often. However he spawns for me at whitespring once in a while too. Right by the fountain. Since there’s a chance for a deathclaw, wolves, ya guai, or a grafton monster to spawn there. 
---
Snallygaster, I find them easily on the North part of the map, very common there by that toxic lake area. And occasionally there’s a chance they are fighting the robots at the entrance by whitespring, right across the street from the train station. 
---
Wendigos. I kill so many each day that I started to think they were common enemies. The whitespring golf course has a chance to spawn either a glowing wendigo, or a glowing feral ghoul in the shower/locker room. 
---
The flatwood’s in my opinion is the hardest for me to find. I can honestly say since the beta, I’ve only seen him about 5-6 times. Other than him, the rest of the creatures aren’t really rare to me.
---
Given those numbers, I'm guessing a lot of people here are doing what I'm doing:  Cover dailys/weeklies, some nukes and all kinds of events that happen to be running.  Especially Radiation Rumble:  All those juicy ghouls.  Oh, and always in a bonded public events team.
---
Aww man... I'm sorry to hear that. Hope you're able to launch one of your own soon.
---
They should buff legendary enemies in all events
---
Legendary modules and vault script were not discounted for some reason.  Shame since that's all I buy anymore.
---
I mean, it's probably just something that is a holdover from previous games more than a money related thing. You couldn't scrap them in FO4 either, though I don't know about NV and FO3 since I never got into crafting in either of them.
---
I'd had so many legendary modules if that was the case. Mayne a % chance. 10%, 20% 30%.
---
The lighting is a limitation of the engine which is itself a very highly customized Bethesda version of the utterly ancient gamebryo engine they have been using since Oblivion. It has a sharply limited number of shadow casting lights that can be rendered at any given time and the ambient is set on a zone wide basis. Any interior zone located on a given map will have to use the exterior zone maps ambient lighting unless it is placed in its own map file, which increases load times.
---
And yes the shading (phong i think) is buggy af too.
---
So take the door off
---
Thanks for the offer, I'm on PC .)
---
can we not just have a plan vendor that sells all plans for high amount of caps like serums 
---
extend cap limit to 100K and make them plans like 20-50K
---
Thank you for the reply! I will keep this in mind, in your opinion what should I aim more towards when it comes to being a bloodied build? I guess being that you're always in low health in general it would be best to go for more DR and ER instead of a mix of all 3? 
---
 As goes for the shadowed could you confirm for me if it works for all armor now?
---
Regarding the Secret Service armor, I had thought outfits did not overlap the armor because I had remember a player had told me that the best armor is Secret Service but the only downside was that the armor looks super bulky and the outfits couldnt cover it up. But thank you for confirming that the outfits indeed do cover it up thank you!
---
Atom shop skins prevent them from appearing in the legendary vendor.  Favoriting items forces you to click a second time to scrap items.
---
Im not locked in there with them, theyre locked in with me.
---
It depends on the perks - they used to be worth quite a bit. Unfortunately, with the newest wave of duplication, the market is pretty much in the tank right now.
---
I'd hold on to them for a while, until things settle down.
---
If I may ask, how did a level 20 get two level 50 Fixers?
---
Bruh, MIRV and Nuka Grenades are the shit. Dynamite Bundle is decent, but expensive to craft.
---
Plasma is pretty good considering how many just keep ending up in my inventory for some reason. 
---
But yeah, the rest of the are kinda lackluster.
---
It’s from people opening the lunchboxes
---
So sounds like if your going for a rank 5 card, better to share something you already would have, rather than a card just for teams, as that'd take up a lot of your points
---
Do the Queen of the Hunt daily and you're guaranteed a cryptid.
---
Thanks mate. I had a feeling that it did exist.
---
terminals can lock up if there is lots happening on the server, or even when it has been up too long or something.
---
I have had to exit and re-enter terminals every 2nd time i try and launch a nuke, Which is needed to make id for step 1.
---
Fought one last night. I nuked Federal Disposal Field HZ-21.
---
Now that took a moment 😂😂
---
it shouldn't from the SCRAP menu, however if your at the REPAIR/MODIFY menu you can still scrap non-legendary weapons with skins.
---
Safest bet is to always scrap from the SCRAP menu.
---
As bloodied you should just try to get a full set of unyielding first. Then try to upgrade to a better set. And it's all up to you after 350dr the there are sever diminishing returns so it really dosent matter
---
As far as I'm aware shadowed only works on leather
---
Its not a brightness issue. The games appearance seems to vary quite a bit from platform to platform. Especially for PC players. Some of us get dark nights, some of us (myself included) have nights that are so bright they may as well be cloudy days. I have a brand new 2070 super vidja card and a 4k super hd monitor and my game looks exactly as the Op described. With many other minor graphical issues to boot.
---
Use this for a rough idea on price  [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
Then you did more XP, which would make sense, to get you there.  All good I am happy after 2 weeks to be there and no all nighters!
---
It's from lootboxes
---
That means 3 were opened near you by players (25 ×3)
---
The effect stacks and last an hour
---
You also get random fun bonuses (ex : confetti when enemies are killed)
---
I requested a refund, but they say the payment hasn't went through to their system (quite blatant lie because my invoice in Paypal already said that the money is sent over), they will need the payment to go through before they can process the refund :(
---
I drop excess plans that sell poorly into the med kit box in wards trailer these days
---
My friends and I have just started leaving a bag of random junk plans sitting in front of our vendors while we are out adventuring. If you come back to camp and they're gone, rinse and repeat. I've tried pawning off stuff to new players but many are distrusting or are alts that don't need the crap either.
---
28
---
No, I'm not grinding the battle pass.  Why would I?  Does it give you access to a new questline?  A map expansion?  No - it unlocks cosmetic items.  I'm not interested in doing chores for trinkets that offer me nothing in terms of core gameplay experience.  
---
Who is a sheep to Bethesda?  I quit playing when I got through the quest content, and I'll come back when the BoS questlines are added later this year.  This is just a game - I'll play it as long as I have fun and do something else when it isn't.
---
If I didn't pass three billboards on the highway yesterday, I would have no idea what DuckDuckGo is without Yahooing it
---
I love expl flamers, they're like insane dps snipers
---
recently got to try an expl gatling plasma, not that impressed, will stick to flamer
---
Well taking a company to court over $18 is a bit too much, the lawyer fee will cost me more than that :/, thanks for the suggestion tho.
---
Same here.  level 31 and not really doing the NW challenges. 
---
I find it so hard to get those done(but I’m not much of a NW fan either. My overseer lvl is 11😆
---
I just found those flowers this past weekend, and before I found them, I didn't have any flux recipes in my chem bench.
---
Unfortunately, those numbers don't reflect the current glut of duped weapons on the market.
---
I just want to be able to get a power armor stand plan :&lt;
---
I've found three sets of PA and no plan stands :&lt;
---
I plopped down an assortment of instruments and she does play them from time to time, Banjo, Tuba, Drums etc. Granted she does play her Guitar more often, but she does play other instruments if given the opportunity.
---
Ok I’ll hold on to them thanks for the info! 
---
It’s bugging me because I can’t remember, I know I got them both the same night. I’m nearly sure I got one from protecting the robot walking around the streets in Morgantown where I have my camp. There was a legendary scorched zombie, that’s the only legendary enemy I can remember coming across. Sucks that I can’t use the weapons for a long time though!
---
Maybe just name them something unique?
---
Last encryptid I did I took pylons (along with some others to be fair) and some fucker instantly melts it in about 2 or 3 shots of some heavy gun. The poor bugger who started it didnt even get a shot judging by the confused emotes he shot while standing over its corpse. Some people just suck
---
I have been playing since January, and I have only seen the Flatwoods Monster six or seven times, so he is pretty rare.  I killed him three or four times, but the other times he disappeared when I ran towards him, so he apparently has some iterations where he is non-hostile.
---
I have probably seen the Mothman as many times as the Flatwoods Monster, so also kind of rare.  I have sometimes fought him, but also encountered him in a specific form (I forget the name), where he just shoots into the air and disappears if you get near him.  Of course, that is all aside from the event "Path to Enlightenment", where you interact with him, every time you do the event (the "Wise Mothman").
---
I have run into Sheepsquatch several more times than Flatwoods Monster or Mothman.  He is probably "semi-rare".  I can usually shoot at him from a distance, and he does not chase after me, so I can just keep shooting until he dies, but once in a while he ran up on me and we were heavily engaged in close-quarters fighting.  I used to see him in Welch, almost every time I went there (outside the house that is part of the Overseers "Personal Matters" quest), but I haven't been that way for a while, so I don't know if he still spawns there.
---
I have killed Wendigos several times, including the locations you named.  I have also killed him right outside the gates to WhitespringsResort (near the Whitespring Station), so he apparently spawns there, sometimes.  That one was a "Glowing Wendigo".
---
I frequently kill the Grafton Monster for XP, because he has a regular spawn near the Poseidon Plant (as others have mentioned), but also on the east end of Charleston, where he comes up out of the stream, when you get close enough.  As already mentioned by others, he also has a regular spawn behind Hemlock Holes.  The BEST thing about them is that they count when a daily challenge pops up to kill a cryptid, because I just go kill one of them and TA-DA!  Challenge DONE!  :)
---
Like you said, two Snallygasters regularly spawn in the middle of Charleston.  When I am leveling up a new character, or just looking for some acid and stuff, I will kill the Grafton Monster on one end of Charleston, run through the city to kill the two Snallygasters, then kill the Grafton Monster on the other end of Charleston.
---
It’s more the gesture, and you’ll probably get more than 18 bucks because they’re denying a service and I’m pretty sure there’s some form of compensation you can get for that,
---
But it's actually called script..
---
I was wondering the same, even if someone gave you the plan at 20 getting enough scrip would be hard without crazy luck.  Or if you bought them at a crazy price, but then you would know the price.  You got a Sugar Daddy?
---
At least it wasn't a rolling pin!
---
Last time I had a run with only 2 other high levels players (not in same team) and we all acted like gentlemen. Using the "come here" emote when noticing the legendary.
---
It was actually hilarious how much time we were taking to kill them, in fear one of us did not have time to hit it. It was like "after you" "no after you I insist" "no please I insist you should do it".
---
No it isn't...
---
I mean if ur on pc and selling
---
If you are on X Box I just put a 2\* Bloodied LMG in my Vendor.  IGN: DraftiestDrop1
---
Fuuuuck man...no way? Gunna (not) try that next time or just walk away if no one Joins before timer runs out.
---
I would be more likely to attempt solo if they dropped high radioactive fluid, or flux making components.
---
I already have a full set of unyielding combat armor, which is why I was curious if there was anything better than what I was currently using. Which I still don't know what that "better set" is
---
They fixed the gatlin fire rate visual,  its at 25-30 now btw
---
*No, that is a ridiculous idea and you are silly person for wanting one.  Also, I have been informed that your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries.*
---
Check whisprings vendors. It's sold there for 500 or 800 caps. Icr which 1 but one of then does
---
I used to hoard plans. Regardless if they were common or rare. Then I realized I didn’t have time to be a vendor. Since I end up getting 1,400 caps every single day after I turn in the weapons from all the enemies I kill. 
---
I know mostly all the plans there are out there, minus the serums, I only bought 3 so far. Whenever I have any plans I already know, I ask my gf or my friend if they need any. If they don’t, I just go to the overseer’s camp and throw them in that black stash box. So whatever new player grabs them will have a nice surprise. Or whatever high level player stops by there and takes it.
---
There is a problem with this tho. The market was flooded with duped large Christmas gifts. Whether gotten by duping yourself or picking them up there is surplus. If you are selling 5 or more of all the mounted head plans, prime receivers, weapons plans, etc..... WE KNOW how you got them. Hence Bethesda ain't gonna do shit unfortunately. Hell I'd love to sell ammo. But once again...
---
Maybe used toilet paper
---
Sometimes I don't even hit the legendary mole miner and still can pickup a legendary weapon. Do you only need one person in a team to take a shot for it to count?
---
Before the season started I would say far more people shared in that event than didnt from what I saw anyway. As the season has gone on though there is a real selfish attitude showing its ugly face at that event and many like it. People just see the xp now and to hell with anyone else.
---
i like to put mine behind garage door for this reason. Yea the menu might still be up for them, but as soon as they exit that menu to check out another machine, no can do boss.
---
the only time I have worn PA or a PA frame in fo76 is when it was required to make excavator PA for a quest..
---
afterwards I dropped it immediately...
---
Mothmen seem to be in greater numbers now that their people are back.
---
I was watching riflegamer on YouTube and he was running with a lvl 2000 something. And it was actually brought up in a convo with the high lvl saying “people ask me all the time how I got to this level and they all think I cheated, but I didn’t”.  Ehhh I think some exploits were involved.
---
I got lucky, found a Quad Auto, ffr, +15 load Tesla in a player vendor for 2050 caps.  My God Tier weapon.
---
This is very helpful, thanks. For some reason I thought it was 4x experience for events.
---
Would you happen to know if everything counts as an event? Workshops, dailies, Enclave?
---
She’s probably realised that everyone has god rolls now
---
I’ve only dropped one nuke in attempt to spawn it. It happened to spawn on the first try and first visit. Don’t know if it’s because I nuked the area above Fort Defiance or if I was just extremely lucky
---
Go for better 2nd and 3rd stars. Like sent/can or harder to detect. And str or ap. I like heavy combat for the look of it, and the pumpkin paint looks nice in it haha
---
PA is not the only option for late game. I have recently abandoned mine and I'm enjoying the game way more as a bloodied unyielding melee build 👍
---
Normal armor, esp when u get to the secret service armor has alot of benefits _like 3 leggy effects per piece) that you dont have in PA, i only rarely put on PA and 1 of my chars us even a FH HG build
---
I set my camp up just below the vault, with plenty of lights for anyone wandering about to see.  I typically load up my vendors with free ammo and consumables. 
---
When I have some new players in my camp while I’m there, I try to drop a care package to get them on their way. Crafting materials, stem packs, rad away, rad X. 
---
If they have a good first experience then hopefully they’ll stick around and get into the game.
---
I’d love if they brought the voice actor back to do guitar covers with singing of some of the radio songs
---
Some builds use it, some don't. It is preference. I do not use it.
---
Laser musket
---
I am greedy yes that's true. But the point here is this is a  broken part of the game and we have seen no response.   Since you just wanna troll and insult I'm gonna hope you have a good day.  Stay safe man.
---
The van is on its way, please stay where you are.
---
what is "better" ?
---
better than what?
---
how does the game determine what "better" would be for 1 player vs. another?
---
rng is rng
---
You would be correct lol. I had to get back on my pip boy to check but I could've sworn there was always a "t" at the end
---
Lots of folks use it for Nuke Zones, 99% of the time you can do without it, but some folks like to use full time
---
What build do you use for your BE HM, I can one shot most but not as high damage as you?
---
Or waiting until brotherhood dlcs comes out and everything in toon locked.
---
*cries as I open my stash to grab my non existent legacy* “guess it’s just you and me nocturnal rolling pin...”
---
If anyone actually gets a Bloodied Rolling Pin God Roll I have Caps for that!
---
Oh god I feel dumb. I was wondering why I couldn’t sell my crappy 1* 10mm pistol. I painted it. I ended up giving it away because I couldn’t get rid of it
---
It's my 2nd favourite melee after the wiffle bat.
---
Agreed.  Went from going on shopping sprees and only server hopping once or twice, to rarely finding any other vendors set up with worthwhile gear.
---
Maybe a daily quest where we can fetch sheet music for her, adds to her repertoire
---
I know it applies for The Fixer with the plans, but I'm not sure how accurate it is when you apply it to other weapons, for instance The Cryolater. I've gotten so damn many legendary Cryolaters, so many..that it's not funny, and I do not know the plan for it.
---
Nah, it’s not required. Early on things like the excavator with calibrated shocks and X-01 are super useful, but I’m at a point now where I don’t use it for anything ever.
---
Yes. PSN: Duke_Silver13
---
Events are the one with a hexagonal marker on the map, and the only bonus xp is thus completing that events xp
---
If they do make this change, conduits and pipes shouldnt take budget or should have their own budget.
---
To be fair scrip is a silly word and script is a commonly used word, so it's what you see at a glance...
---
That's true, and honestly, I haven't experienced all that much toxicity in this game. Last night just got on my nerves.
---
PA is actually more of a mid-game thing. You don't necessarily have good enough regular armor &amp; you still need to fight higher-level enemies / nuke zones.
---
Most players find that once they reach the end-game, they can be more effective without it.
---
Agreed. That said, waiting only goes so far if, 30 seconds before the timer runs out, nobody has shown up anyway. I've run into that far too many times in the last couple months.
---
I’ve found the clown suit at the fairgrounds in one of the first small buildings. I think it’s the one that says “Lockers”
---
Colossus is a joke. Killed him solo a bunch of times he's much easier than the SBQ but he does hit harder than her
---
I have...quite a few. Who's asking? They all have work permits if that's what you're getting at and yes I pay minimum wage. You can fit eight to a room at a push and they don't complain.
---
Yup. It’s not soo bad so far. I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish the season but I’m getting most of the things I want
---
There is usually one up by Wavy Willards as well.
---
I am a non PA build; lvl 250+. I only use PA for the occasional nuke zone (prefer stealth armor or hazmat suit, but PA is good if you are struggling with weight). I also use my excavator suit when I go mining because the weight buff and the ore buff (4x more ore). I have a suit of X-01 and Excavator.
---
It could be an ATX item or part of Seasons Pt. 2
---
I heard it heals them haha but no idea
---
I love this idea. And he could collect "You have been insulted!" notes. 😂 Those are quite useful.
---
Sycophants used to claim the disappearing corpse always respawned at the point where they first appeared.  That might be fine if you knew where they first appeared.  Never had the camera trick reveal anything for me.  Likewise for binoculars.
---
I didn't realize that. Makes me feel a little better.
---
would not want insult bots that cant be shot in the face to death..
---
Ghouls are immune to rads so no damage but maybe a buff? Idk, should have been an impossible roll like the exploding lasers
---
Easiest spot to take him out in my opinion
---
Increase the lvl cap. Should fix the problem.
---
Revive Challenges are easy with a Mic. Talk to your teammates. Team of four, we cliff jumped for each other until we all had our revives. Done in two minutes.
---
It’s radiation. Radiation heals ghouls. +15% damage to ghouls = more radiation to ghouls. = healing ghouls more.
---
...Or keep him alive and farm screws
---
NO SONG. ONLY GEETAR FOREVER.
---
Yeah... Lately, everytime I try to claim a workshop, a level 300+ comes and one shots me.  I'm only 48 and a casual player so only one piece of legendary gear on me.  Hitting all my dailies twice a week has been extremely hard because of this 🤣
---
That's awesome!
---
For now Im keeping it, until I get something better lol
---
It requires two chars. So either one person with two accounts, or one person with a friend to hold an instance for them.
---
Drop the item on friends instance, relog with other char, get back on friends instance, loot the item on second char.
---
I usually hit them with the “follow me” but that gets confusing when you’re around other players that are not on your team. I get a lot of “????” when trying to get my teammates to come to that event.
---
Then there are the moments when you exit a robot vendors inventory after selling a whole days worth of crap, turning back to see 3 People standing in line and waiting like a descent human being. Warms my heart
---
Around 250 hours of play time. 
---
Alien and Flatwoods monsters: 0 time.   
---
Sheepsquatch: 3 times; Top of the World, near Mount Blair trainyard, and one at Thunder Mountain Power Plant.   
---
Mothmen: at least 10 times (not counting the wise ones). I recall facing two of them near whitespring in a single session. They hate me.   
---
Grafton monsters: at least 5 times. 3 times near Charleston area. 
---
Snallygaster and wendigo are common.
---
Actually both videos appear to be from before the patch although one had full health. Is adrenal reaction serum also not procing? Or just the adrenaline card. Thanks again
---
35. Done 0 NW's.
---
Noone is disputung that jackass
---
Which daily quest is this?
---
There a use for those vocal sacks yet? Been hoarding them for just in case they make a craftable that needs them. But they weigh 4 pounds each and its starting to be a hassle to my stash.
---
Heavy gunners tend to use PA for the stabilized perk. Everyone else is using legendary armor.
---
Sorry that happened to you and it ruined completing the questline, I'm glad to know it's a thing though now I can't wait for someone in a public team to tick it off my list for me
---
My main if rifleman but I have my commando cards all levels up.  
---
I stay with rifleman perks on for 95% of the content.   I only switch to commando for SBQ, PP, Encryptid.
---
This is the kind of content I come to this sub for :D
---
Super-Mutants in dresses. What's next, an Assaultron Furry?
---
Please Beth, I need my upgraded FISTO experience.
---
Yeah, I didn't bother with the revive players challenge either.  If you work with your teammates it is definitely possible, but its too situational without having someone let you revive them on purpose.
---
Most of the other NW challenges aren't that difficult though.  I got the 9 creatures in 2 matches.
---
Yeah, you actually shouldn't have gotten them from a regular drop. Legendaries will only drop weapons / armor around your own level. And Fixers don't drop from anyone but the Purveyor.
---
Hello friends!  Is life getting you down?  Are scammers ruining your gameplay experience?  Do you find yourself asking how to make things better.  Well here’s your answer, donate your caps to Happy Dude via 742 Evergreen Terrace.  Donate today and fell happy just like me.
---
I fought it several times before the last update and it summoned spawns a lot. After the update it's definitely had a buff and it seemed to summon spawns less.
---
Everything I use is renamed with a "-" in front.
---
Ex: 
---
-Two 'Sploder
---
It puts everything at the top of your inventory list too.
---
how do you have 56 int before berry mentats? i know how to get to 30ish... with unyeilding... then +8 with scorbeast brain and carnivore...
---
Yeah, that was why I got rid of it as quickly as I did, but I was wondering if it would be possible to use it to turn one into a Glowing One or something. It would be an interesting mechanic for them to put in the game
---
lol... More songs in general!
---
I actually don't know. But you can get the game at GameStop or eBay for like 10-20bucks. Also if your on Xbox the game recently came out on game pass. Good luck :)
---
Hey level 200+ Did you know the event encrypted is easier if you START THE GOD DAMN PYLONS !!!!!!
---
If someone does that to me while I'm at a vendor, I make sure to take even longer than I would've normally taken. Unload all your ammo in my back, feel free, I've got all day.
---
still gives people an idea on worth.
---
Escape artist doesnt seem to work.
---
Unless he's playing all day long without breaks lol
---
Bar's open, ladies and gentelmen!
---
True.
---
Also an animal rescue handy that's trailed by several healthy cats.  Only seen that one once.
---
It certainly is a cryptid.
---
I'm herbivore and still using brain fungus soup for the int boost and with strange in numbers perk its +5. So it counts as a veggie and its working.
---
Nah. Bethesda has too many idiots in their offices to implement cool mechanics like that...
---
Even if they may break some minor lore.
---
It didn't work after wastelanders but the last patch fixed it and working fine for me
---
What if their response (or lack thereof) was intentional. The bullion system introduced weapons that can't be traded. No need to dupe that awesome SS chest piece you rolled if you can't offload it. By flooding the market, they're creating a relatively level playing field. Then when the brotherhood dlc comes out, they nerf the hell out of he duped weapons/armor, pushing the player base to the new, untradeable weapons/armor. Hell, they may even introduce 4 or 5 star legendaries. Think back to the "green is the new purple" era in WOW (~2006 I think).  They are certainly poised for a major shift like that.
---
The Gauss Rifle and Lever Action Rifle seem to be the worst affected. 
---
Automatic weapons get around this somewhat; they may miss a shot or three, but the rate of fire ensures that you're very quickly on target and hitting. I'm actually considering swapping over to a commando build due to VATS shittiness with semi-auto weapons.
---
U need to pick a style of play to better help u. 
---
Low health vs high heath. 
---
Full damage no QOL or a mix. 
---
Melee, commando, rifleman, heavy weapons, etc.
---
scrap legendary &gt; you get legendary module.
---
that's all I need.
---
There is an overseer stash in Morgantown airport upstairs next to an old man npc (gotta find the key code off a dead responder body to unlock the door to access it) and it has a small backpack plan for those not wanting to grind the tadpole quest. I think it holds less than the standard backpack though.
---
I name all my armor and guns like 1 LEFT ARM, 1 RIGHT ARM, etc, etc. (so the appear first) If you have multiple sets you can name them 1 LEFT ARM UNYIELDING, etc. This makes it super easy to swap between my gear and chinese stealth for SBQ events AND any new gear I pick up will not be mixed in confusing the hell out of me.
---
My base INT is 15. Add Egg Head, Night Person, Full Unyielding, Full Building Team, Brain Bombs with Herbivore and Strange in Numbers, Shielded Casual Underarmor and 3 pieces of my Unyielding armor have +1 INT as a modifier.
---
I will in turn ask you to be a leader all day and remember to keep switching, that will get tiresome and you'll eventually forget.
---
I use a dollar sign. Same reason, but it makes me feel like mama says: S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
After hundreds of hours, I only saw my first Glowing Mothman with green eyes yesterday. Seen plenty of the red (enemy) and pink (event) ones but the green one is new to me!
---
Set up a custom ini file. When you want to play nw just drop and drag the custom ini to the desk top or something then start the game up again. Takes a few seconds and you'll be able to play
---
Raider punk ally quest. I got my first one yesterday.
---
This is the reason I switch to goat legs (and light footed) when I’m browsing camps.
---
I ran across one camp where they had a stack of punji boards sitting off to the side with very cheap junk in vendors as the bait. Thanks for the cheap junk :P
---
Always, since day 1 of the beta for me. I've tried getting rid of notes, holos, and other useless crap but it still does it. Sometimes it will work fine but if I'm in a hurry, I can guarantee it will be slow af.
---
Can confirm, am HG with Stabilised perk and Gatling Gun/50cal main weapons.
---
Oh yes i would prefer modules but i highly doubt that cause they cost 50 scrips
---
I tried telling people it was easier to just get xp and do the repeatable rather than survive for 30 mins in NW and i got mostly clownshoes telling me it was easy. Missing the point that no mater how easy it was it would still take 45 mins or so (loading and waiting included).
---
Maybe if there was actually an area of the map that provided a significant enough challenge to grind for some magical weapon I would be more likely to try.  As it is, most of the map is like shooting up a nursing home even without them.
---
I'm not familiar with wow but that seems very likely.
---
I have a sign in my camp "free water, ammo, and junk" in huge neon letters. Have at it, man.
---
I think the only problem with sights on the 50 is where would you put it? On the cross bar? Or would you have gunner like sights on the front. TBH I was thinking of a conversion for the 50 into .45 with lower damage say -5 or -7 (I don’t know what is the norm) but faster fire rate (mine is 91 so maybe boost it to like 120 or 150?) 
---
The ammo converter is annoying but kinda helps in regards to .308 ammo. I turned in all my .38 that I’ve collected and stored in my stash (~7000) as well as my .50 ball (~2500) and got about 3500 .308. Though it does eat through ammo I’m down to 1100 and it felt like I haven’t fired it that much.
---
“BuT NUCleaR WInteR BaD TAke iT oUt of thE GamE”
---
For real people. You don’t have to play the game if you don’t want to. Think about how the NW players feel that don’t like adventure. Either they’re not caring about the rewards, or they’re sucking it up and doing the adventure challenges without throwing a fit on Reddit over it.
---
Nuke in between foundation and freak show. I've nuked that area 4 times and its spawned all 4 times.
---
Nah. Got a nocturnal black powder pistol, immediately followed by an exterminators black powder pistol.
---
Do you even play this game?
---
Good stuff, my mate plays the game but he hasn’t played in about a month but he’s upto the final mission of launching a nuke. Will get him to pull his finger out so we can do it together lol
---
Ahh ok I get what you mean.  Yeah Diablo III has a shared stash between all your characters, except seasonal ones.  You can start new characters each season but they have to start from scratch and don't have access to the shared stash until the season ends. It's really handy though for sharing things between non-seasonal characters!
---
There was a mod for Fallout 4 that allowed you to craft the legendary effects, I wouldn't mind seeing something like that in 76.
---
Basing off your approach, you scrap say a 3 star legendary and you pick which effect you want to salvage. Do that with 2 other weapons and you've got yourself effect modules that you slot into a crafted weapon so it comes out with the effects you want, the cost rising the more stars it has.
---
I would attach a few catches to this to hold it in check so that the new legendary, if scrapped, gives nothing back, there's a big upfront cost of caps/materials, have it set so it doesn't appear in the trade or vendor windows and it's automatically destroyed if dropped or stored anywhere other than the stash box. Effectively have it bound to the specific character that made it. I get that people have found ways around this so such a system would need a foolproof bound to character system.
---
It'll never happen of course, but I can dream. Would just love to see the crafting made a bit more useful and in depth.
---
Thanks! I guess I have to kick out commander dauguerre first
---
Did you know you can kill the sheepsquatch imposter by STARTING THE FUCKING PYLONS!!! Level 200+ must not know that
---
Any high level heavy armor will be good enough that the differences are minor.
---
Marine armor (which is sturdy but has resistances between sturdy and heavy) is sort of the threshold for good armor, upgraded it gives \~200 resistance, which is what you should be aiming for as a baseline. After that point the rest is largely semantics as the biggest factor in durability is flat% damage mitigation.
---
The only armors that have noteworthy advantages over any other are solar and thorn which have very powerful set bonuses (regen at high health, melee deals bleed damage respectively). 
---
Secret service armor has higher resistances than any other, but this advantage is only significant if you are not in any way shape or form boosting your durability by non armor means, if you have scaly skin, perks for damage resistance, upgraded under armor, or legendary effects that boost damage mitigation then the already fairly small advantage gets reduced further.
---
There is no disadvantage to going with better armor, damage resistance is damage resistance, but it's not really worth sacrificing resources to get more after certain points, this is why vanguards and bolstering damage resistance effects are terrible late game, the difference between 250 and 500 damage resistance is less than the difference between 150 and 250.
---
i use Zz so it puts everything at the bottom instead
---
Blast through/clear out the silo, but have someone else initiate it for you. Only way really
---
One of my characters has a frathouse at Morgantown. I built it as close as it will let you and once again the contemporary camp bundle earned it's keep well.
---
Some of those challenges are super-duper easy (like taking photos). Best not to miss out on SCORE.
---
It’s not an asshole move at all.  I leave my water purifiers on for people to help themselves.
---
It holds much less than the standard and to my knowledge you can't make it into a chem backpack to my knowledge
---
My Hunter's Fat Man begs to differ.
---
Closing in on level 200. I only wear mine during queen fights. Stabilized perk with the power armor, and my Gatling gun.
---
cool idea, also reminds me of Black Mountian Radio/Tabitha the nightkin in New Vegas :)
---
Y'all are too critical shit
---
Yes, with my eyes closed. I partially deaf.
---
That's an awesome weapon to guarantee you'll complete the "Buried with Honor" daily.
---
They could just hammer a wall endlessly
---
I just recently found out about it. But I like my big backpack better.
---
True. 100%
---
But there is gonna be an unchecked box!There can’t be an unchecked box. CAN’T!
---
That is all.
---
The adrenal reaction serum should be procing if you are at nerd rage threshold.
---
But I suspect that you have less dmg on the weapon stats itself than Cap or Turtle is because they use primed ammo and because they probably had some adrenaline (from the perk) stacked when viewing the weapons stats or and also are using chems.
---
Basically:
---
- Bloodied +50% dmg cap at low hp
---
- Junkies +50% dmg cap w/ 5 addictions
---
- Adrenaline reaction additional +50% dmg at low hp
---
- Commando/Rifleman all 3 maxed +60% dmg
---
- Bloody mess +15% dmg maxed
---
- Adrenaline perk +54% dmg when maxed
---
- Ultracite ammo +1 point to base dmg but also gets multiplied by all the percentages from above.
---
- Any chems or other consumables +XX%
---
And then of course there are the sneak multipliers but those don’t affect the stats itself.
---
I don't have anything to add to this conversation other than to say I can solo Encryptid pretty quickly and the confusion on people's faces when they arrive 3 minutes after the event launches and can't find the imposter is my endgame and also my heroin.
---
I'll note I only do this on Imposters I pay for. I'm a team player on other people's events.
---
I'm on ps4, what F button??!!
---
I have also discovered a (new?) bug yesterday that i have not seen anyone else mention. FT related. I have never seen it happen prior to yesterday morning.
---
Power armors have not been spawning in PA stands out in the world. Except they are... kind of. They dont render, but if you walk up to the stand, sometimes it will actually show the craft/modify options *not* being grayed out - which means the game thinks there is a PA frame in the stand. If you click on it, nothing happens for several seconds, then you get a brief server disconnect message that goes away after a 10-20 second delay.
---
However, the PA craft/modify windows never open. The thing is, the game thinks you are in the PA craft window so you cannot fast travel anywhere. It simply fails every time you try with a "You cannot fast travel at this time." message. If you relog, the invisible PA frame will get placed into your inventory as the client closes. You can hear it get recalled a split second before the char get dumped to menu. After relog, you can fast travel as normal, but you will have the PA frame and whatever was equipped in your inventory.
---
Agreed. The paltry 200 scrip a day limit makes sure that you are always pushing your weight limit.
---
no worries man got myself a new backpack as well for the help, cant wait to get the robo ghilly so i get a full suit going :)
---
As one of the fewer, and dropping, number of people that use pa all the time, it has benefits and draw backs.
---
As others have stated, power armor is not legendary (at least not legitimately, there are some hacked suits on pc still floating around) and hat in and of itself is non ideal.  In power armor, you dont have sentinel effects, you dont have ap regeneration beyond perks and consumables (there is a mod for torso but that one piece as opposed to 5).  No unyielding or chameleon or any other primary that people look for.
---
On the other hand though, it comes with damage reduction per piece on the frame capping off at around 40 percent (I think its 42 percent?) And a rad resist bonus ensuring that normal armor that is not a hazmat or stealth suit will not have the same survivability in rads even with numbers in excess of listed.  In addition, pa typically has high durability often not needing repair for weeks of real time for me personally.
---
Though in truth power armor has devalued greatly.  With the advent of bloody builds, unyielding became the name of the game, and without its stats, some people find the game unplayable.  No legendary effects renders it weak for pvp encounters where typically there is enough explosive and armor pen to disregard pa reductions.  Wastelanders brought a jet pack to normal armor, removing a unique upgrade that pa had going for it in the ability to boost jump.  The legendary perks that were revealed and suspended this last update included damage reduction perks for normal armor that would further reduce any benefit pa has by negating its reduction bonus as normal armor can get you the same.
---
In all, pa, despite being iconic the series as the best available in protection is being basically made irrelevant more and more with each passing update.  T65 may be the best is pa defenses, but the dr and er numbers mean nothing when they get that high.  So for the most part, no.  Pa is not inevitable, only the grind is.  For armor, and weapons.
---
Easy fix, add the interrupt like it does when you sell favorited items. But, I'd also like tags.
---
Been playing since a little before last Halloween,  
---
Flatwoods monster: 4x, all in the last week thanks raider punk
---
Grafton monster: 5-8 times a week depending, usually Charleston between the capital and dam, sometimes by phillipi cemetery 
---
Snally: 12x a day, Huntersville, Charleston capital, all over the ash heap, sbq
---
Sheepsquatch: 12x seems to hunt me down a lot in the ash heap or toxic Valley  and twice by top of the world and one VERY unlucky time my first hour by 76
---
Mothman: 7x, it rarely hunts me down, why won't he embrace my worship, I'm better than those cultists anyway, friendly spawns at enlightenment event and occasionally midnight game time at cultist camps
---
Wendigo:might as well be a regular ghoul,theyre everywhere it seems with their wet slapping sounds
---
Wow used a color code system for item rarity. Green was generally considered vendor trash, and purple was the epic, end game items. 
---
Back then, most everyone had epic gear sets and had effectively "beat" the game. Then they introduced a major new dlc (forget which one it was), new areas, new much much stronger enemies, and boring common drops that were better than the cool sets they grinded months for. Suddenly these incredible weapons and armor were worthless.
---
&gt;No need to dupe that awesome SS chest piece you rolled if you can't offload it
---
The thing about that is, they haven't been able to stop the method of trading these as well. They curbed it for a little while after wastelanders came out and they caught on to it, but the same exploit is back again.
---
I'm more convinced at this point they've just thrown their hands up and said "oh well"
---
Even worse: their camp is floating, and when they log out, your character falls to their death.
---
Oh, don’t get me wrong, it’s still a powerful weapon, but spending 100 scrip on 2 legendary modules for a 1* roll is kind of BS in my opinion.
---
Thats true, okay so basically I used to get a lot of largely useless traits like underwater breathing, player damage, whereas now Ive gotten a lot of weapon/ammo weights reduced, increased damage resistance etc
---
I always use a quad tesla for the event, I don't do that much damage with it, plus it gives me the best chance to get a hit on all of the miners.
---
Yes. The Secret Service Chest piece can be modified with a Jetpack.
---
I do it to keep Appalachia’s arbitrary trade routes going. Knowing that you have access to the same mysteriously linked pool of caps at all the vendorbots is reward enough for me, Ma’am/Sir.
---
No I don’t though. I figure they’re decently rare? On my main I’ve got plans in my vendor for the back pack and flag. But I’ve only gotten the helmet and outfit a couple of times each.
---
I been gettin nothin but garbage,
---
Fer myself anyway...
---
I’m sure someone else’s build would like it.
---
One mans trash Is another mans treasure as they say.
---
But I’ve no patience too price N sell in vendors,
---
so I just cash it In,&amp; roll again.
---
Yea, I think you've got the wrong one lol. Theres two in the game now, one from raising your ranks with one of the factions which passively makes whatever ammo you select, and the new one that lets you change ammo types with points
---
(waits by Vault 76 with a few nukashines)
---
The bullion system introduced a jetpack for the secret service armor, idk if there's another
---
And it doesn't require Fusion Cores to use.
---
Learn how to manage your stash limit early on, make a plan, and stick to it. You don't need to pick every single item up. You won't have a use for 1000 pieces of Cork. Unless you're crafting ammo to sell or some other item like stims, you don't need more than 50 of any component stored in your stashbox.
---
Agreed. I wish it would be at least 3 stars. Ring sucks... but at least im.getting the gun I want and not a Nocturnal Rolling Pin.
---
Most do it on private servers I would say, but you can disrupt some casuals I reckon :-)
---
What a great idea, up voted, I would certainly use this.
---
I miss LOTRO, I was in a band that played the taverns.
---
It’s true. I carry around an instigating shovel. Use it to fend off the mongrels that hang around the cemetery. What I really want is a reduced carry weight shovel.
---
he would only collect fertilizer and spoiled food....
---
Agreed! I thought scorched legendaries would stay after the event ended, what a sad day when they left for good (or until next Christmas)
---
Okay well I like having hp idk what qol means but I like just demolishing things if that helps you think of cards ill need
---
No just uses AP
---
there's a small green Alien Head (mounted) inside Lowe's Taxedermy (in a closet)
---
I liked the first challenges I did for NW as it got me to try it out for the first time (was like kill creatures or something). The revive a player is ridiculous as it encourages people to troll the game mode just to get that challenge, as happened to me before when my entire team killed themselves mid game which just wasted my time (was only my 3rd time playing and just not at the point I could solo it successfully).
---
Ive noticed in the couple of times that ive bothered to do this one that at least one mirelurk always gets stuck under the foot bridge, which causes the spawns to stop as the waves need to be full cleared.
---
You are S.P.E.C.I.A.L.  !!
---
There isn't - only the mod for the SS Chest Piece. A lot of players didn't read the fine print &amp; bought the jetpack first, not realizing that it only worked on the chest amor piece.
---
You'd change your tune if you got a jetpack. They're a blast, pun intended.
---
When I’m in a crunch for storage, I either
---
1. Give them away
---
2. Vendor for caps.
---
Do you know where to get the armor?
---
I’ve seen more legendary raiders than legendary scorched. That’s so weird...
---
Sounds good, if you’re a rifleman build, might be worth sourcing a TSE Tesla, it 1shots most thing in the silo, some gutsy and assaultron need 2-3 shots.
---
There will be plenty around atm.
---
That unchecked box bothers me so much -.-
---
And deploying you camp 3 times. Can be done in literally the first 5 seconds of the match and you’re done.
---
lol
---
3 weapons in a row were “medic” weapons which are total garbage for me being a mostly solo player. Still have never gotten a single bloodied weapon after dozens of rolls on it.
---
Play the death metal cover of country roads on infinite loop
---
Bear Arms and The Fixer come to mind, both not part of the DLC, yet you need the plan to get the legendary drop.
---
It's post-nuclear rain... be glad you aren't glowing!
---
Stimpack diffuser?
---
thanks for that :)
---
The only one I really hated (and didn't do) was kill 9 creatures.
---
I kinda agree with the Anti-armor (perforating, piercing, etc) mags for the .50 since IRL .50 cal naturally has Anti-armor against at least light armor vehicles (the Barret .50 cal is an Anti-material rifle designed to hit light armor targets from further away than say a rpg or like device it’s not accurate enough to be a true sniper) or maybe an explosive receiver that makes the rounds explosive kinda like the Gauss weapons have a natural explosive effect but you don’t need new ammo? and I’d love a double barrel .50 if not a mod maybe a unique .50. Would a TS double barrel .50 shoot 4 bullets at once? 
---
LMG does need some sights it’s irons are usable but not the best. And yeah I seem to eat through the LMG’s ammo in like 2 seconds.
---
thank you appreciated
---
Think I’ve got one of them in my stash, I try and collect a decent weapon of each ammo just in case lol
---
You buy it, and the jetpack mod, with Gold from the Secret Service in Vault 97.
---
But you have to do them for the weekly or you miss out on 1000 points.
---
27
---
Surely it’s fair game? Haha
---

---
I agree completely. The wet effect also seems to apply to interior cells, sometimes, unless my eyes are playing tricks on me.
---
However, the game looks dated because it \*is\* dated, it's Fallout 4 with a lot of the textures and meshes downscaled/reduced poly to account for consoles having to deal with a dozen leapfrogging insane people blasting a giant dragonbat in a radstorm with all manner of odd weapons like it's some strange post-apocolpytic lightshow. The lighting, when it works, is just a bandaid, and as you note one that looks a bit crappy and dated in about 60% of conditions.
---
Complete the Wastelanders questline to raid Vault 79, do pubic events to get treasury notes, go to Crater or Foundation to turn them into gold bullion, and use that to buy the SS chest piece and SS jetpack mod for it.
---
alternate characters.
---
Ahhh...seems like a good move.  Did they announce it prior or did people find out day 1?
---
You forget that there is the "Complete Daily NW Challenges" Weekly that's worth 1,000 or 1,500.  And since you're at the mercy of what they choose to offer for dailies you might as well take advantage of the easier ones when they are available.
---
The money doesnt go directly to bethesda, it will go through an intermediary billing/authorization company like Xsolla or the like. This intermediary has likely billed your paypal but not sent the notice to Bethesda that your payment has gone through.
---
That’s how I do it, too. Though I have done what that player has done. In the future I won’t do a mad dash to find all 4.
---
Yeah, unfortunately they are probably duped weapons. Best to hold on to them until the market thins out a bunch...because right now there are thousands of these weapons being dropped all over the place.
---
No need to rant, do as you last sentence implies, don't join others but create your own team. So you can do as you wish and set your own rules.
---
There is no reason to tell others what they should do or how they have to play.
---
Sorry, what's the problem here? They can't hurt you so is there some hidden problem to someone shooting at you or what?
---
Your build really matters. More so than gear, though gear is also important. This game is quite easy once you understand it
---
Hey! It’s all about having your build set up right, so that your perk cards match up with your weapon to give it extra damage, and then the same with your armor. Do you mind posting your build on here? Or you can PM me and I’ll help you with your perk cards and and build :)
---
Do the bags disappear if you leave the server?
---
How about sharing an idea then, all you’ve done is knock on the dudes idea without giving any input
---
I did, took me 5 matches, wish I never bothered lol
---
lol there is multiple videos online it's definitely not under the radar
---
&gt;they’re sucking it up and doing the adventure challenges without throwing a fit on Reddit over it.
---
I mean, if you bought Fallout 76 for *Nuclear Winter* and had only begrudging interest in Adventure Mode, I'd have to argue you're in a very, very small minority of the player base.
---
I've seen legendary mole miners at Lode Baring, legendary scorched in Watoga and Harpers Ferry, and legendary rad rats at horde events that drop lvl 5 3* bloody laser pistols(still a bit sore about that one). I've seen a few legendary mole rats, snallygasters, still haven't found a legendary rad roach.
---
I go on in 1 hour intervals. I have an alt who is always  on my team. She contributes level 3 inspirational. An hour is how long serums last. I set up my team. I eat tasty squirrel stew, scorchbeast brain, steak, etc. I kill the super mutant giant at twin lakes (1300 xp), hop over kill the level 91 deathclaw (1300 xp) at the substation nw of watoga, head over kill the mega supermutant at bog town then launch a nuke. I switch just before the queen dies. So far have not forgotten, and not the end of the world if I did. I usually 10k twice.
---
Assaultrons aren't much fun at level 100 plus either. My strategy for getting past them is a combo of head shots, panic firing and getting them before they see me lol.
---
Pulse grenades work well against robots
---
No, the encrypted broadcast is BOS. It has been Decrypted by data mining from ESKSERAH.

I've fucked up someone's cycle already, I even waited for him to return to emote my disappointment 😂😂😂😂
---
Does anyone know if this works at radiation rumble?
---
How do you switch without disbanding the party?
---
I’ve gotten one or two decent rolls, but mostly the same old scrip fodder. I think I get better legendary drops in the wild, and that ain’t saying much.
---
Lol I've done that a few times. Once this dude kept shooting me at someone's vendor so I turned off passive and he already had his off so I just turned around and got him in the head a few times and he had some nice flux on him :) 
---
If you're gonna be an asshole you should atleast remember to clear your junk first... or don't:)
---
Isn't it still three hours? Three nukes per three hours each. Between the two of you that's six nukes if you server hop after the first 3 silos.
---
Oh yeah the one you get from the Raiders I think is the one you're talking about.  Makes sense to lock that.
---
Well, Gamma Guns do have a usefulness for Bloodied builds because they can apply a bunch of rads very quickly.  And if you're going to have one, you might as well have a great conversation starter. 😋
---
They're free to report me hahaha
---
If you had a percentage chance of getting a legendary module - say - 10% for a 1 star, 25% for a 2 star and 33% chance for a 3 star I'd be on board.
---
As a PA user, I sadly have to say that it is crap compared to legendary armor.
---
Or a ghoul slayers gamma gun
---
That’s a valid point.
---
Me personally, I hate nuclear winter, but I still do it, it’s kinda refreshing aswell. 
---
Although, I wish it was a lot quicker to get into matches, with only a small amount of play time available to me, I’d play it more probably.
---
Especially with the pip boy light on aswell, it just makes everything look gross and the light doesn’t cast shadows, only makes everything brighter
---
Make sure you’re hitting the ground around whatever you’re trying to kill with exploding plasmas, it will do significantly more damage with the the explosion splash damage rather than direct hits.
---
It was prior, people quit doing the original Naxxramus dungeon back then because there was no point because it took huge time commitments for gear that would be worthless in a short period of time.
---
In general? Level more. SPECIAL caps at 50, so it's not really going to hurt to squeeze out those last three and finish that line.  
---
Hunt around for some better gear, be it weapons or armor. Maybe look into power armor.  
---
Kind of hard to say without knowing what your using to know what might needs work.  
---
Beyond all that: go for the legs. Taking out an Assaultron's legs means they have to crawl after you, which'll aid your survivability immensely. Then just pelt it 'til it's dead.  
---
That said, if the Assaultron in the Mill is giving you hell, you're gonna chew through you keyboard fighting the Sentry Bot at the end.  
---
So yeah, in general: level more and gear up a bit.  
---
Hit any of the Public Events that show up. Even if you're not in a group, there'll be people around helping you, you'll get a fair check of exp. and most of them have at least one legendary so a good crack at getting something to make up the difference.  
---
Yeah man I just woke up here in LA! I looked into it last night but had a shift in the morning so when I realized it I was like :0 and then I had to sleep lol but it’s badass that Maxson himself talked to her! Is it current or has the last bit not happened before?
---
shooting them in the face to death is all the buff I need
---
And I know several people on my friends list that are in NW 9 out of 10 times that they’re online. 
---
&gt;very, very small minority of the player base. 
---
....Yeah. We all know. Which is why OP is saying to just not do the NW challenges. It takes less time and effort to just not do them than go on Reddit and bitch at Bethesda to remove a *single* challenge that’s entirely optional.
---
No, that's not a prerequisite of commenting on someone's suggestion. Especially when I have already qualified my statement.
---
No problem that can can't be solved.  Are you suggesting I shouldnt interpret someone with friendly fire turned off and shooting at me as looking for some feedback?
---
Maybe scrapping legendaries for a chance for a legendary module?,i have the same issue, stash is full and i cant drop items since everything is important like my assasin sentinel set and my bloodied collection.
---
It wears down faster and is more efficient if you bash enemies with the gun
---
Full time PA user here, only take it off to craft or vendor hop. PA isn’t god like or by far the best but it’s fun. If you want to look like a walking doom machine than PA is the way to go. I’ve done bloodied stealth builds before but it’s not really my play style. I like to wreak havoc, but when everything dies 10 secs into a fight it’s not fun for me. It’s all really dependent on how you want to play. Give it a go when you can and if it doesn’t suit you go for something else.
---
Yes there is, some people don't think about it. Maybe they will decide to have the decency for a reach around. There is no reason for your useless comment
---
No custom radio stations.
---
Definitely odd. Last week I had one with me and another guy showing up. We got her down by a third of health, but then I ran out of ultracite and we where basically done. We kept at it but there was no reasonable chance of success after that. We stayed till the end but no one else showed up.
---
Not a nocturnal harpoon gun and two other nocturnals in a row
---
I saw 5 people at whitesprings station the other night and i was like 'HMM' so i put on my stealth suit and fast travelled there. There were 5 bags filled with plans. Why were bags of  plans on the floor? I don't know. 
---
Yeah. Most of them were mounted heads but there were some of the slightly less common plans in there (dense armour plans can go for a bit). So i started swiping bags. After 2 or 3 they realised the weren't alone and started shooting and hitting me. I grabbed the other bags. I then stood up, threw them a salute and logged off. 
---
i stood near the wayward and distributed most of the plans and some aid to new players. Took about an hour to get rid of them as there were so many.
---
Selling a Serum or Fixer plan for 10-50 caps is a bit silly... 
---
He could lower them by a couple grand, but 10-50 for those? Nah.
---
Robots hate energy weapons. Also, dont shoot them in the head, aim for the torso on assaultrons, fusion cores on the sentry bots 
---
Levels wouldn't hurt but also make sure you're spec'd for a certain weapon type, if you put points all over the place you're going to get your lunch eaten.
---
Yesterday I spawned at a camp in white springs. He had neon letters that said “fun maze” so I ran it. It was an endless maze with nothing really exciting. No decorations just walls and doors. I somehow make it to the end and Beckett is there but no vending machines just a door with a pin pad and the code displayed above it. I’m not sure what the owner was doing but I notice I was taking heavy rad damage. So I step back and get into my power armor and proceed to enter the code to unlock the door. It opens a room with flamethrowers (I think?) and I quickly reversed and got out. There was no vending machines. There was no fun about it. Another player was there also. We both gave the camp owner a thumbs down and he e-motioned for me to take a pic. We survived the “fun maze” 
---
The people who take time and put effort into these trap camps should at least make it rewarding for those smart enough to solve the puzzle. Doesn’t it get boring to trick people just so you can steal some scrap junk?
---
looks like you're just under leveled a bit and/or your build is not optimized
---
It is not a scorchbeast, it also appears to be a heavily mutated vulture. Maybe a Turkey Vulture? Or some other bird native to the area? There are megasloths, which aren't native to the locale. So this could be some bird that someone had as a pet before it mutated?
---
I highly doubt it's an older version of a scorchbeast, as the wings are feathered, the waist is smaller, and it has talons now fingers with claws.
---
All of that anxiety and fear and guilt is put upon you by yourself.  You can still play the game and choose not to get on the treadmill.
---
The choice is yours.
---
Shooting the insult bot in the face? Yeah I guess that's a valid point, although I prefer using a power fist, if I'm lucky I can see the robot flying away.
---
I just think its kinda sad i get more validation from that thing then normal life
---
Ok, so although one assumption was incorrect, ie that base game weapons were also added to the loot pool by script, the basic premise still has merit, at least regarding "dlc" items. If you want to maximize chances of your bloodied fixer or some base game item dropping, you should not learn other dlc plans that are added to the pool by script that you have no intention of using. Im still wondering how these rolls are made? Is it a series of nested form lists, e.g. armor&gt;heavy armor&gt;heavy combat armor, etc? So my question now, since I've not opened the .esm,  is: does the game use form lists for these drops, and how are they structured?
---
I once ran into a legendary Liberator. I was so thrown off that I forgot legendary robots explode. Went off on my face and I died.
---
But I still got that sweet, sweet five scrip.
---
waterslide? waterslide w/ drop out/launch?
---
3 modules for a 3 star is profit, you can craft a 3 star weapon with 2 modules. Although it could be a 1 or two star. Still, given the exchange rate of ammo in the Ammo Converter at a 1:5 (sell the same ammo for a fifth of what you buy it for), Bethesda wouldn't let us sell legendary stuff for 3. They'd restructure it so we need 10 modules to craft 1 weapon, if they even did it at all (like you said, it's a pipe dream)
---
It's not an old scorchbeast model...
---
PA can really help you out as you piece together legendary armor with desired stats. Then you may hit a crossroads where you want to go stabilized heavy gunner, which makes PA viable. But many opt for melee, commando, or rifle builds and forego PA altogether. PA is as inevitable as you want it to be.
---
Create a builder public team to help you level up. You can still solo, but will hit that 50 mark alot faster.
---
No it is not a scorchbeast. This has feathers, schorchbeasts are mutated pygmy bats, this thing is a mutated bird.
---
Cheers mate, it’s what I was looking for.
---
There are some mods that add more radio stations.
---
Yeah, I carry 4 reduced weight rifles as primary’s and two vampires heavies for hard boss fights or SBQ on my rifleman dude
---
If you bought FO76 to do NW you have some other issues.... go play Apex or Warzone
---
Took me a few weeks but i am used to it now
---
Yep, totally true.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Report you for what? Buying stuff out the vendor
---
I'd make a new toon for rifles. Then when you get bored you can switch between the 2
---
They are also very different build so the switch would take awhile
---
The upcoming double xp weekend is perfect for making a new toon
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Glad it will help 👍
---
Doubt it is the original scorchbeast as Bethesda would not add something that was already permanently put into lore. This is not a scorchbeast. More likely a mutated vulture or bird native to the area. Or possibly another cryptid.
---
$2000 Gold bullion for the SS Jet pack.. You will need the chest piece as well since it's mounted to it.
---
I've tried to enjoy it, along with many other Battle Royale style games. I get the appeal and theres nothing particularly wrong with the game type, but they just never click with me. I've only played NW for the dailies and I generally stick around until I die, but I don't really enjoy the time spent.
---
You should keep that to yourself.
---
Well troubleshooter armor is super helpful and folks sell it cheaper now as people are making SS troubleshooter armor.  That drastically reduces damage.  I just went through at about that level on a new character.  I basically prepared for those fights.  Get the pulse grenades that hurt  them, nice way to start.  For that sentry bit I played a game of cat and mouse.  I used a sniper and shot quick to get its legendary to trigger and after a while of it shooting it needs to cool down.  So it shuts down, then hit it a few times.
---
For Raiders look for a troubleshooter type weapon, that you can unload on the assaultron.  I also walk around before trigger that part to figure out my route to run around.  You need to think about how to put something between you and the assaultron.  Jump over things as it can’t, or jump off.  It did kill me twice but I got it on the first time.  Same with the sentrybot it took me three times as well, but that was due to a bug, it wouldn’t let me loot it and had to do Rara 3 times
---
Thank you for clarifying that for me. I appreciate the information stats. When I look in my pip boy I don't ever see adrenal reaction working I'm sure it use to come up when shooting things unless that was the adrenaline card. I only seem to be getting an extra 20% from nerd rage when I get to that threshold. I will pop a radx and see what happens to my damage. Ty again
---
There's nothing wrong with taking a break if you're frustrated.  You won't be the first and you won't be the last.  It's probably normal.  I think players like myself who don't take breaks are the exception rather than the rule.
---
Most those plans will be from presents
---
 It's a Broadcast from Elder Roger Maxson to Paladin Leila Rahmani
---
Sure. So you need to do 3/7. 1 of which is just to place your camp.
---
Out of curiosity, because I've yet to see a playthrough where someone is, does being mean to Ra-Ra actually matter?
---
Like, does it prevent her from volunteering to get you the Slug Buster later on?
---
this model, is the same as Destiny or anything with anything to grind on a daily basis and based on the fear of missing out. the goal is to take all your available play time as it raise the chance that you spend money in their shop.
---
Im actually jealous
---
I think they are talking about the Mole Miner Gauntlet Plan, not actually the gauntlets themselves...
---
that's such as defeatist take. yeah, I suppose you're right. Bethesda has the right to ruin the game and the series if they want. but we should at least complain about it.
---
gachas are widely successful for a reason. manipulating your playerbase is not cool no matter how you rationalize it.
---
and \&gt;just don't play it :\^) is a terrible way to do it.
---
So you got something for free and you want to sell it rather than pay it forward and give them to another noob?
---
Don’t believe it’s dirty. It’s actually a pretty well done and fun mode. 
---
It’s just not why a lot of people play fallout, and the zenith of battle royale is over I feel. I used to play pubg a lot but I definitely got burned out pretty quick on them after that. Had my fill. 
---
Loaded up NW because of these challenges and was pleasantly surprised. Again, it’s just not why I play this game and had enough of the game mode from the past.
---
There is an alien in game. My friend saw one the other day and was going to let me know, but I wasn't online at the time. From what I understand it's super rare to see, but there is one and it isn't the Flatwoods Monster.
---
Ok, I was just asking if I should continue with my current one because I have seen some high levels invest in multiple weapon types.
---
You make yourself look Bad ;-)
---
And 200 dollars poorer.
---
Haha.. You're welcome!
---
Hes rough ive killed 8 of them you have to clear the grove of all enemies,  that will reset the respawn time, then leave for bout 15 min then check again you can do this a couple of times per nuke and definitely message people on server
---
That’s where I saw him I guess I do not go there often enough.
---
I'll try the praying haha
---
If they have they are not doing very well. Every end game build is focused one 1 weapon. You severely limit your damage and qol by using 2 weapons. You can do it, it's just not as strong
---
Yeah I list almost all at 11-33 caps.  Really rare ones like Ultracite Emergency Protocols or Fixxer plans are saved for trades or buddies.
---
I seem to remember a story about how long it took for the first team to beat that dungeon.
---
you’ll be able to craft it at an armour bench. pretty sure it’s in under armour
---
What’s the effects?
---
Realistically, I think the only place for workable sights would be on the front as some kind of gunner sights, even if I'm not terribly fond of those. The problem with the .45 conversion - apart from the name - is that .45 has several perfectly end-game-viable weapons and one of them - the automatic Fixer - provides enough of a drain that you don't need another one. Also, .50 ammo is already reasonably easy to stay supplied in.
---
The problem with feeding the LMG via ammo conversion is the monstrous appetite of that gun combined with the poor conversion rates. I'd rather lug around a converted .38 LMG, maybe with a 150 shot drum mag, to use up all that ammo directly.
---
Lighting, wet textures, reflections, grass growing from foundations, raindrops on the screen while in a CAMP house......
---
Bethesda has a lot to fix and that's without even venturing beyond visuals.
---
Thanks mate
---
Im kinda impress that its a weapon that people want so much. Dint know was so nice.
---
&gt;some FTP mobile bullshit
---
That's how I felt about the Season thing too, until I realised that it is only a small portion of the game. The atom dailies were a quick little additional way to earn atoms,. The legendary run (although a major focus of the game at the minute) is just a quick little way of earning pre-determined items.
---
Granted, if you actually want something from the last few levels of the run, it'll FEEL like you have to play daily without fail or buy levels. That isn't the case now that they've added more dailies, have a repeatable XP challenge and are having at least one double dailies weekend.
---
I'm not defending how much they are incentivising daily play over longer weekly sessions. But it's not as bad as it seems.
---
all good :)
---
You should be FORCED to give them all to N00Bz
---
This ain’t it chief. You had a good post and you’re turning it sour, quit acting like a jackass. 
---
Not everyone has the ability to share perk cards or cares to. Let people play how they want. 
---
If you want people to share cards that badly then stick to making your own teams so you can control who joins.
---
How the hell is that a defeatist take?  I like the daily challenges and the pass.  It's free stuff for a few minutes of effort per day.  "ruining the game series" is a subjective take.  Literally every single online multiplayer game "manipulates" it's player-base like this.
---
Hell, every business on Earth does this.  You do realize that there are people who's job it is to design grocery stores in a certain way so that consumers see certain things first and spend the most money right?  Are you going to complain that you are being "manipulated" when you go to the store?
---
*"DuPIng iS gOOd FoR THe EcoNOMy!"* \- Some douche nozzle from a couple days ago.
---
You just have to say that you're when you're not fine because they would just never understand
---
No it's not an early version of the scorchbeast, this is a bird, scorchbeasts are pygmy bats. Not the same.
---
I actually enjoy it too
---
Well I don't want to be majorly op to the point where my weapons one shot so would that be better for me?
---
76 has always occupied this troublesome niche where they sometimes treat it like a single player game, where the prevalent belief is that cheating doesn't really affect anyone besides the one doing it, and therefore it doesn't matter.  It's like they've slowly had to come around to this realization that a live service game is a different beast.  That even if you don't PvP, the schmuck who kills the Scorchbeast Queen in 5 seconds is indeed affecting the play experience of others.
---
The leader can switch the objective under the team's heading in a second
---
No its one hour per silo. I did a Quad drop yesterday on a server. i launched out of Alpha and Charlie...someone else did Bravo and then i went to Alpha again. About 2 1/2 hours total for all 4 (including running other events scripping crafting and then silo runs)
---
He was on the cryptid list so I included him
---
Ah, yes, I do use the splitter, as its does more damage with each fire split projectile, I didn't know it conditioned at 4x speed. But thanks for the heads up!
---
It’s your choice, obviously, but in my opinion, play the game by your rules to get enjoyment from it. I still haven’t finished the Wastelanders story line. I’ll do the dailies if I feel like it. The Legendary Run? I’m not killing myself to finish it.
---
What I’m enjoying right now is running the Leader of the Pack event and giving new players the low level legendaries. It makes their day.
---
I work a full time job. And if I’m lucky I get to squeeze in an hour or two. 
---
In those two hours it’s enough for me to rank up once , kill at least 5-10 legendary enemies. And the build stuff on your camp or workshop is extremely easy. I admit I HATE the nuclear winter challenges. Except for the place your camp down or use a stimpack. As soon as I get those I just leave the game. 
---
There’s a few challenges however that I completely skip because they aren’t worth my time. And no I’m not losing out on anything. Because the pathetic 250 score point I get for that challenge. I can makeup for by killing enemies and getting XP. 
---
This whole score system thing, is basically a race or challenge to see who can unlock everything. And I promise you, not everybody will make it. Some people will, others will reach level 50. Other people will join so late, that they are lucky if they make it to level 20. 
---
You can play the game. Do what you normally do. And not par to participate in the score challenge. Nobody is forcing you. Honestly out of all the rewards they give you, besides the currency, there are only like 3 things I really want from there. And I’m perfectly fine not getting them if it comes to it. 
---
If you’re upset about the game that’s fine. And if you decide to keep playing, or leave the game. Well, like you said. Nobody really cares if you do or don’t. If you’re hoping somebody at Bethesda will see this and help make things easier somehow. It’s possible. But I highly doubt it. 
---
Take some time, cool off. Give it another try. Or just put the game away and come back in a few months. Or simply just uninstall it and never play it again. 
---
It’s okay to be pissed, and write a rent review. Hell, I do too from time to time. 
---
But at the end of it, I keep playing it. Because although it pisses me off, I have friends here that I like to party chat and fuck around with.
---
I pacified a fox last night. PC
---
I do.
---
He keeps trying. He keeps looking looking silly. I'm not even sure what youre projecting for, but I'm sorry you're having a bad week - and I'm sorry that you're so obsessive over other people's pocket change, even when they don't spend it.
---
I would still recommend sticking with 1 weapon type
---
Np, adrenal reaction should proc when at 20% same as nerd rage.
---
Ok that was always allowed.
---
Claim tokens, Mr Fuzzy tokens, and Pleasant Valley claim tickets.
---
You're welcome. Glad it's helping some people.
---
Well, they'll update the Atomic Shop, that's a given. 😋
---
I do cut players less than level 15 slack, but I kick anyone who does not contribute. I do t care why
---
I found out it was the splitter attachment with 4x conditioning speed
---
They are apparently based on early scorchbeast concepts. You should checkout some of these images, they are pretty amazing.  https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Yaoeoq
---
Yeah like they have lots of Caps to spend when they've just left the Vault. Why do people set up shops for new players? They're skint! Just drop them stuff for free!
---
Okay thanks for the help.
---
I tamed a sloth yesterday
---
They take forever to sell on ps4 
---
I normally end up tossing it  to make room for  legendary or ammo
---
I rename them all to "ZER0 (Simplified name here)" so it's at the bottom of my scrap bucket.
---
Of course when fallout does a Metroid Zero mission cameo/crossover, that may give me a Hard Time :(
---
I feel ya on this one, been thinking about quitting myself
---
I'm not really frustrated.. Just a quirk of my personality that I *hate* feeling manipulated.
---
It's happening on PC as well. I get the banjo sometimes.
---
True I turned basically 9500 rounds of ammo into about 3500. I cleared out a level 68 Sunnytops ski about 2 times and wendige cave and I have about 1100 left whether that tells you how much ammo it eats or how bad of a shot I am with it (I have to burst fore it because the recoil is bad for small things like bloat flies)
---
Man, I found the lowest level person on my public team, showed up at their camp, and dropped probably 40 plans for him/her. Emoted, shot at it a couple of times, jumped and crouched a few MORE times, and then left. lol Someday I will remember to use the gift emote so that it makes more sense to people.
---
Headshots are a bad idea on assualtrons,. Aim for the legs.
---
notification sound?
---
I am on PS4.
---
Well, I believe that might be one of the problems. I tried to use the perk cards as effectively as possible, But I think I don't really understand how to use them. I will try to post my build later today, so you all can have a laugh and then maybe try to help me figure out the best way to use them to my benefit.
---
Supposedly there is going to be a double score weekend. May be the best time to catch up. Also hopefully this trend of 7 (not including NW) dailies keeps up and you can use that to catch up to (as long as you do the NW challenges too). There's plenty of time to catch up if you make sure to do a little extra each day. I've been trying to do 200-300 points extra in the repeatable and any NW challenges I can stand and I'm almost 2000 xp ahead right now (and that is in two weeks).
---
If you have saved your common fascnacht masks now is the time I'm selling them like hot cakes to noobs for 50-100
---
It's a science to position lighting in CAMPs to not make your character look hideous, because the top-down lamps are so blown out.
---
You know, I think anyone who replies to a reasonable request with "don't tell me how to play" is a total fucktard
---
Just level out the shotgun perks and switch between heavy gunner or shotgunner whenever you want.
---
Technically, yes it is. If you go back and look at the Fo76 scorchbeast concept art, this is what one of them looks like. 
---
So, more than likely they had intended to use this one originally, but changed it to the bat version before the release of the game.
---
Same! But I put ZER0 so it looks cooler.!
---
I don't think it's lighting, it's the reflections being completely blown out.  On a sunny day, the game looks fine.  But the moment it switches to rainy weather, everything looks like liquid metal.
---
lmao i like this alot, the bastard actually hit me hard last time...
---
Said something along the lines of " I could say something to hurt you but I could never hurt you as much as life has already done, haa,haa walk it off"
---
I wish we could just mark items at favorite or trash like in the Borderlands series. They could go even one further for Fallout and have favorite, sell, and scrap.
---
It doesn’t seem to be, it starts when I fast travel to camp and repeats as I’m in camp.
---
They're still very quick to do for XP and Treasurery Notes. Worth still doing even after the Rep grind.
---
Haha I feel you, don’t worry. I only started figuring out what the hell I was doing at level 90 😂 so yeah me and others will definitely help you with this.
---
Ye almost the exact same thing happened to me! I bought it at release played like 8 hours a day in November and then quit lol.
---
OMG I thought I was the only one!
---
Ba-ba buuuum!
---
Yep, and some of us just ain't got time for that.
---
Sorry but I have one more question does the season pass reset for the new character. Also do the daily and weekly challenges reset with a new character?
---
Depends on your camp location.  My toon by Hillfolk Hotdogs does good business in them.  My main in the Ash Heap doesn't sell shit.
---
A trick to Sentry Bots is the perk concentrated fire. You can target the fusion core, and even if you have a 0% chance to hit, after a few shots, the percentage increases enough to get a hit on it. Usually one or two hits on it takes it out completely.
---
Sentry bots are pushovers with concentrated fire.
---
The plan can be found in Harpers Ferry. I had someone ask about them last night and purchased them from the vendor bot there within a couple of minutes. They were right under 200c. Powered Gates
---
It happens to me when I leave Nuclear Winter.
---
Team play is optional. However, if you end of getting the premium service and play on a private server, you will want to create a team anyways. flat 25% increase in xp earned, plus the bonus from whatever team type you create, PLUS the ability to use the herd mentality mutation in a group by yourself (+3 all special stats).
---
With a full team you get +100% Event XP, so it is only x2 not x4 XP. Also XP gain is capped at 4000 XP, so if you are already stacking Intelligence and XP boost then switching is not worth the hassle for a tiny bit more XP.
---
Yes, but we've been able to stay on the same server all day most weekends. They don't usually hang around too long. If I get disconnected, its no big deal since I was basically throwing those plans out anyway.
---
All jetpack are(supposed to be anyway) chest mods, this is the only one for non power armor to my knowledge
---
I'd be fine if they just expanded the new legendary crafting system to work on all plans.  Like I can stock up on legendary modules &amp; craft gauss shotguns, the effects might be random but at least I'm getting a gauss shotgun.
---
Nothing worse than blowing through my scrip hoping for shotguns but getting pistols, crossbows, and missile launchers.
---
If I have the plan for the combat shotgun I should be able to craft legendary combat shotguns by adding in a legendary module or two.
---
Ultracite Emergency Protocols is rare? I just listed it as 10 caps with the rest of the plans. At least someone got a good deal lol
---
They are all shared. Any xp you earn on any toon goes towards the 10k weekly repeatable. The only rewards that arnt shared between toons are the currency and scrap those are given on the toon you claim them on
---
Gamma guns do normal damage aside from radiation damage so it could of done some damage. 
---
However whether it would be enough to outdo the radiation healing them. Honestly don't know.
---
I wish we could MUTE them!
---
Alright thanks. I was asking because I really want to use the guass shotgun. I guess I can use the guass minigun too.
---
A bit ago I got to see a scorchbeat fight 3 2 star floaters.
---
You would hate my base... It's pretty much an FU to gravity!
---
Ok thanks for your help.
---
Thank you very much. :)
---
This is kind of where I sit. I’m not a fan of seasons. I think they cheapen the experience and do make me feel like I need to play a certain way. 
---
That said, they aren’t terrible. Having over 800 hours in the game it is something new to do but can’t see myself grinding future seasons. At a point it’s just too much.
---
pretty much, yeah. laws against anti-consumerism exist for a reason. the whole loot box debacle illustrates this perfectly.
---
there's a fine line between advertisement and exploiting your buyers and mobile and mmo games crossed it a long time ago.
---
the whole point is seeing Fallout go down this route as well and how we'd rather not.
---
Rarer as far as those plans go.  They were especially valued when you could mount jetpacks on the arms
---
recently i have seen a level 400 guy in nw ... on pc, and im pretty sure that guy was legit.
---
Please tell me how
---
They die.  Gamma guns are a mix of damage, and they actually hit respectably hard.
---
One is 
---
+30% Damage to Super Mutants 
---
25% faster fire rate 
---
Faster movement speed while aiming 
---
The other 
---
+30% Damage to Mirelurks and bugs 
---
+10% Damage while aiming 
---
25% less vats cost
---
Kinky
---
Happens constantly. I had it literally all day yesterday.
---
Just put some steel beams ):
---
Breaks are healthy things. Live service games thrive on FOMO to keep people logging back in every day. Games shouldn’t play us, so sometimes when it feels that way, good to take a rest otherwise it’s just a stressful grind.
---
yea im lv 55 never did the NW quest
---
He didn’t ask if he asked how. RTFQ!!!
---
cripple the legs
---
I must be blind asf, ill look again after work, thanks!
---
I think it isn't bugged but it has a horrible area of damage to the point where it doesn't even feel like a grenade and more like a throwable weapon with a lot of delay.
---
Yeah 10 steel per repair
---
You could try a straight 8s build, basically where you evenly distribute all points. I like to drain points out of charisma and more useless stats and put them to where they’re needed like strength and endurance, I just like to have enough in each specula point so I can experiment with builds and do as I please.
---
I did not know about the cap. I wonder what the actual difference is? Still makes sense for some events like uranium fever
---
Did you know, I often wait for people to join and no one does. So I start the event in hopes of having people see it and join in?
---
You'd hate my camp. I built a tall house with random rooms coming out of the side, half of it is empty because I used all my budget on mounted heads (Most of them stack so you can make some cool creations like a honey beast/ mega sloth hybrid or a yoa guai with deathclaw horns).
---
Thank you!! That does give me some hope for the future! Got to keep on digging, and apparently figure out my build will help ton's! So keep an eye out, I will post my build later today and you will all have a laugh with that mess! xD
---
The ballistic damage is still high enough that it kills them faster than the radiation heals them. If you want to try healing them I'd find a Berserkers and mod it to deep dish.
---
I only use power armor in rad zones, and that's %1 of my playtime. My full health build has ~460DR and ~650DR with full vanguard's heavy combat armor. So, for me PA is pretty much evitable most of the time.
---
Double bass in civilised society lol :-)
---
Huh did not know you can stack them haha ill have to play with that next camp I make. Though I love mine and can't imagine moving it haha
---
Joke's on them, then. I'm not giving them another cent beyond the initial purchase prices unless and until they fix their game mechanics and monetization scheme to be less... exploitative. No reason to reward bad behaviour, is there.
---
Nice! Glad it worked for ya! I still use it as well and never see anyone else building anything. And you’re right, if you prioritize getting some decent gear in the first few minutes, you can just be ready for the last competitors later and hopefully win.
---
👍🍻
---
I think it has something to do with the way damage is calculated. They’re brutal for the same reason that pulse grenades are, being that it’s not one block of damage that can be easily negated, but rather 1000 instances of a small amount of damage. It’s like the armor calculation just can’t keep up
---
It’s not that they’re too strong it’s that they can glitch out and not have a cool down on head blasts so they just spam the hell out of you
---
Hahahaha I mean it can’t be that bad right? 😂 lemme ask you, what guns are you using at the moment?
---
That is one sassy Mothman.
---
Write your congress-person then.  Idk what to tell ya.
---
On a side-note I am genuinely curious what line of work you are in.
---
Nice. You have given me countless chuckles.
---
So since I'm past 50 could I just take points out of a high stat to make them 8?
---
Lmao it beats the hell out of Daguerre bitching about her nightmares every 3 minutes...
---
I'm saying stop complaining about and you lead teams, never asked how you level. Idc.
---
Serum? For mutations? The negatives are disabled for a bit.
---
Everything New that Bethesda has released in the game messes with our mental status.
---
I just started completely ignoring legendary run, way too tedious even as I play fallout 76 5 hours a day.
---
I'm aware it's a different creature, but it's been in the files since BETA and many, including Juicehead, assume it was an original design for a scorchbeast or variant of it. Which is why I said in parentheses
---
&gt;(at least that's what he claimed it is)
---
No one's saying it isn't clearly a bird instead of a bat.
---
Wait there’s something going on that needs me to log in every day?  I should check it out next Tuesday when I play again. 😉
---
They can do that??
---
Not everyone plays on PC. lol
---
Yeah that’s what I would do, you don’t have to all do 8, I would at least drain some from charisma for strength
---
I just bought the game a few days ago and I'm having a lot of fun with it. I randomly joined a team doing events for the first time a day or so ago and did my first events (I get anxious doing that sort of thing, and especially not being able to type to others) and afterwards the team leader said to follow him to his base and he gave me some purified water and a pistol I could use. It was really kind of him and I wish I had a handle on how voice chat worked in this game so I could know if he heard me thanking him, but I swear that I got the voice chat to work just once and it was when I wasn't near anyone. Hopefully he didn't think I was rude, I tried to communicate through the tried and true method of jumping vigorously. 
---
I've been bopping along doing my thing, and my plan next time I log in is to figure out how to get ammo because I completely ran out of .308 ammo at a terrible time when I thought I had plenty. I saw my first... scallywagg? something like that while going farther south for a quest than I had been before and it was terrible and boom, out of rifle ammo. So I googled where to find lead and next time I'm going to be on a mission for that. I think if I can figure out how to keep stocked on purified water and .308 rounds I'll be going good for a while. I was able to plant some corn and tomatoes so everything is coming up milhouse.
---
A lot of the experienced players in this game seem to be really helpful and nice, which is really cool to see. I appreciate you, random high level people being kind to lowbies.
---
How does a shared card always out perform a fourth person. 
---
What if it's for a gun you don't use?
---
What if it's a broken perk?
---
What if it's rad sponge and people on the team are bloodied?
---
Basically if you really feel like a card is so important. Why isn't it part of your build anyways?
---
Otherwise it's just Extra and not integral to your build. So why does it matter so much?
---
bloodied can't be two shot?
---
Awesome. I was hoping they would reduce the cooldown. 👍
---
I've read that it can drop from any event in forest or toxic valley.  Unconfirmed from ash heap.  I do every event I see, almost every time (I've got manhunt, fertile soil and crash course down to a science) and nothing.  Tried the new character method, I think I lost count after 20 something new toons.  Bubkis.
---
That would be your choice based on your build. However for most players builds that would be the case if they do want to share a rank 5.
---
Hmm, you can just ignore it. Some people are not as good with camp building as you. Or maybe, that’s how they want their camps to look. Either way, let people make their camp the way they want because they have the freedom to do so.
---
Shotgun and Heavy perks are both in STR.
---
There's also the LMG and .50 cal in heavies you could have a go at before switching anything.
---
The reason commando weapons are so popular is because you can stack it with sneak bonuses. Personally my build is for commando weapons, but the weapon I use most is a hunting rifle that one shots most thing. I switch to full auto when things get hairy. Could you try something like that with a Gauss Shotgun as main and heavies as hairy backup?
---
The fact that you can’t sell plans prevents at least one method of duping so I’m good with status quo
---
They seem to be disproportionately stronger than everything else but I kinda like it cause they're the only real threat in the game.
---
Yea drop um
---
I think the fallout 76 guide book thing it mentions a zetan in the game as an enemy but there isnt one but I think in one of the tnt domes there's an alien in a cryo pod.
---
I was half joking hence the hyperbole swearing.
---
which is why I said your take is a defeatist one. "I'm perfectly fine with companies exploiting my good will". personally I'd rather not see one of my favorite franchises go down this route, but I suppose the ship has sailed.
---
I'm a psychiatrist/researcher. don't see why it matters, though.
---
I started as a heavy gunner and switched to shotgun, haven't looked back since. Way to much fun.
---
hahaha....wow................
---
I have 15 strength and 3 charisma to share a perk is that alright?
---
Isn't nuclear winter also linked to the autocomplete bug for dailies?
---
I couldn't agree more.  I've dropped numerous games over the last few years for this reason.  Once they add a season pass or other time gated events I'm generally done.  It makes the game feel more like a job than a game.  Like I HAVE to play or I'm missing out.
---
Bethesda has been making these games for so long it blows my mind this is a problem and they haven't figured it out yet. That or they just keep handing the franchise to the interns that's my best guess.
---
ppl dont run fall dmg gear?  power armor is free no dmg falls lol
---
Or you insert metal for can points. 1000 can points buys you 1 sterile can. You can exchange 1 sterile can for the chance to receive canned dog food.
---
It's like the world's worst obscene phone call. Every time you hear it, you're on edge until you finally get attacked. Especially in Fort Defiance! It's not like it's not already a creepy as hell location, too!
---
Good man
---
Their A team left for bigger and better things a long time ago.
---
I think I might try that, thanks.
---
Lvl 94
---
It's just selfish play overall and it's actually lame. personally I'd like it if there was a function where if within reasonable ping to put you and your friends into the same server, that way, you're playing with people you've met up with, chatted to, trust, etc.
---
I'm UK and can get through a silo in 10mins always run them back to back and also on late evenings so I can help
---
I agree with everything you wrote... Except for the hoping Bethesda makes it easier part. I don't. I hope they hire more people so they can give the game the maintenance and dedication it deserves, instead of just making it a whale trap to hold them over until their next big release.
---
I just want a reduced weight one
---
It's just interesting to me.  I think it influences our respective takes on the situation.
---
I like the idea and want to like NW more... but I feel like every time I get into a fire fight it goes the same way.  I unload an entire clip on someone and see all the damage numbers go off so theoretically the shots are landing.  Then they shoot at me two or three times and \*DEAD\*
---
Sent ya one. Sandman :)
---
&gt;the economy in particular
---
That has been trashed since the very first dupe involving the artillery CAMP object.
---
Me am only have three int. Wat do?
---
There are worst things in life for sure!😂 I am using a Gatling plasma, don't really remember the level right now, but it is the best thing I have.
---
That and a Nocturnal Gatling laser, but that didn't work as good as the Plasma.
---
I will post the weapons I tried so far (and that I have) because I tried it all, later today.
---
Maybe with that you all can help me out figure out which ones I should keep 😆
---
Snap that bitch up
---
changed any armour pieces lately?
---
Yes just take it
---
Juicehead is not the ONLY person who has covered this bird. Another user has made clear how it is entirely impossible that this is related to the scorchbeast before the game was released. This creature is more than likely a cryptic or some heavily mutated vulture.
---
Look into the Thunderbird.
---
A few people are saying I should switch so I think I might start today. If a may ask what are your favorite shotguns?
---
Yes, I’ll give you 10K for it right now if you want
---
That's a BINGO!!!!
---
What idiot would share a broken perk? Why would a bloodied build stay on a team with rad sponge? Why share a perk for a weapon you don't know anyone else uses. I would kick such people just for being idiots, and you are terrible at hypotheticals. It doesn't matter MUCH, but it does MATTER. Someone who is not sharing is not caring so fuck them.
---
Well, I bet the fallout 76 crew would even mess that up and have him go on non-stop barking sessions every 15 seconds lasting 3 minutes at a time.
---
Did you swap shotguns? You were probably using a magic one before
---
Buy it, just know that it is likely duped. You won't get into any trouble for buying it though. If its at a robot vendor, someone just dumped it.
---
QOL = quality of life
---
Basically weight reduction perks, crafting perks, etc.
---
I have everything I want to keep named like [Eyepatch], [Chest], [Left Arm], etc. That way I pay attention and only scrap the items at the top. It also makes it easy to swap between my [zChinese Stealth Suit] and my regular armor as I just go down the list and equip everything that doesn't start with a z. The z items show up at the bottom and are my Chinese Stealth Suit, my different Underarmors depending what buff I want, and my Excavator Power Armor.
---
Good question, I would suspect so, but I've either had enough people available to complete it easily, or not enough to bother trying to heal because there's not enough to complete anyway.  But I would suspect yes.
---
I kill the insult bot every time I see it. Not only is it annoying sometimes it can be mean!
---
No cause like 9 out of 10 players dont know how to do the events
---
I’m a Furious 50. Cal guy. Took me at least 10 mins.
---
Yeah I saw this too a few weeks back. My camp is right next to the rusty pick and on my walk back to my camp I saw him. Not sure how rare this random encounter is but I dont hear a lot about it
---
Try to get anti-armor legendaries. Troubleshooters us meant for robots but i think that anti-armor works better
---
How?
---
If someone really is taking too long at a vendor I just put a chainsaw close to their heads and let it rip... Most of the time they back up to see what's happening
---
I remember the artillery dupe well 😂 it was the safest and easiest method because no risk of loosing and at the same time you was able to dupe the whole inventory at once. The first banwave came only when the wooden boards were a thing
---
Imo if you don’t want closed doors you should take them off or something. Takes up less budget.
---
Agreed, people need caps now this dupes live, I'm actually astounded that Bethesda haven't done anything yet, it's insane
---
It's not, there is a whole other youtube channel that noted that this could be the fabled Thunderbird. Another cryptid found in WV. It cannot be a scorchbeast since those have already been pushed as bats via the lore. This is a bird. With feathers. Not a bat. Impossible for this to be an original since none of the concept art for the scorchbeasts even remotely look like vultures or birds.
---
That's just a random encounter. I'd recommend buying all the lemonade plans off them, it's the only place you can get them I believe.
---
Apparently something about the plans he sells is good I don’t know why but they are apparently good
---
Every time I get on, I create a building team now if there's not one available to join. The servers haven't seemed as lively, events-wise lately, either. Not just participation, but actual events spawning lately seems a bit fewer and farther between. It could be I'm just not seeing them, but I check the map fairly frequently for them.
---
I know, that answer was my punishment for you. A real non-sequiter
---
They would only have to attatch a warning flag to it the same as when you drop a 'favourited' legendary item already.
---
I'm right there with you on this. I put a lot of effort into making camps feel like they actually belong in the world and blend with it, just as I did with settlements in FO4. It really kills the immersion when you're crawling through twisted metal wreckage and emerge from the rubble to see a giant, flashing, pristine, hovering Miami nightclub precariously perched atop a single 70ft long staircase into the sky. On this same topic, the atom shop really needs to put out some more worn and weathered options, it seems like 90% of the items added since the game released have been pre-war undamaged stuff that looks more suited to Mass Effect than Fallout. You can always tell when a camp is owned by an actual Fallout fan because they try to make it look like it belongs, whether it's a tiny little rusty metal and wooden shack or a ramshackle settlement style camp with multiple buildings. The ones that *do* look like they belong are great, and I'll often send a message to the owner (if their messages aren't turned off) to let them know their work is appreciated. I'll generally leave gifts for them too, though unfortunately I'm sure those get scooped up by the next person who comes along if the owner isn't home.
---
Do they do anything ?
---
What platform you on? I can team up and help you get through it if you want
---
There was also some issue where the helmet would cause frame lag to other players nearby. AT said it was fixed in one of his videos but i dont have the armor myself.
---
Furlough keeping me updated, yea. Sad state of affairs.
---
You dont have to do them.... but 1000 points on the weekly is too much to pass up.  So get used to having people join just for the challenges.
---
I don't know specifics of the rarity or how good it is but I bought what he had and learned them :/
---
That would be hard to tell because the games meta isn't as exact as most games. So any perk could harm a persons build in theory. However bar rad sponge, it stupid rare.
---
I personally share perks like green thump if I'm doing something that benefits from that. Otherwise normally share travel agent as not everyone you it.
---
Most people will use perks that benefit them the most themselves. So more often than not, sharing more useful perks like Shotgunner, Rifleman and so on doesn't help anyone but low levels.
---
And I explained how. RTFA
---
Lol at the people who think the Wendigo is hard. It's easy(and boring) to kill, and it drops garbage loot. Complete waste of time.
---
31, i'm not tryharding the 10kxp challenge to progress faster (I find it very tedious, boring and long tbh :c glad it's only a side challenge)
---
I try to do the NW and it's quite ok. (It made me get some rewards I wanted so One stone two birds)
---
Been having it all weekend and periodically last week. It does it with the notifications that pop up in the upper left corner. So everytime you harvest a crop, get notified of the effects of a disease, get well rested, well tuned, or do anything that pops up one of the quick notifications.
---
Some people are unaware of broken perks. 
---
Why should a bloodied leave a Public Team because some fool joined with radsponge. I mean the bloodied could be the leader. 
---
Sharing a weapon card is STILL sharing a card which seems to be your imposed rule. Useless but it's a shared card right. 
---
It apparently matters enough for you to make not one but TWO posts touching on this subject. 
---
And for Sharing is Caring, again what if it's a useless card. 
---
Basically it seems like your message is wrong. It should be..,
---
Share something I need! Or I will kick you!
---
Otherwise why state you would kick someone for sharing a useless card???
---
That’s what I’m gonna do then
---
The more items you have in inventory the worse it seems to get. I just stopped using the wheel all together on my main. It still perfectly functional on my new char. Presumably because he doesnt have a hundred undroppable useless keys/notes clogging his inventory.
---
May i ask how long you play the game? I think a game should be fun and not like a second workplace which makes no fun... have you ever noticed how bad the rng is? What do you think how bad it was for new players before that dupe to get one of these godrolled items? You can play 2 years and never get a godrolled fixer or armor pieces because the rng is just soooo baaaad in this game
---
Np it’s not a bad weapon tbh
---
If that’s your idea of an explanation I feel sorry for anyone you ever have to teach to do anything more complicated than breathing
---
It has a small boost to AP regen and doesn’t go bad like other drinks.  You can then use it to craft a hard lemonade that does even more AP regen and a AP buff.
---
Share something I need, or I will kick you.
---
Well rested/lovers embrace, canned meat stew from feed the people, team of 4 preferably for 4 int (1 is better than nothing) unyielding armour and low health (sorry but bloodied is the best for it) broiled scorchedbeast brain for 7.5 int if you’re carnivore, and some of the int mentats. 
---
Farming line in the sand glitched will net you 5500xp per wave. You can literally get nearly a thousand score from it alone. Farm west tek and get 500+ xp per super mutant. Do radiation rumble and farm enemies. Farm SB’s for the brains and the XP too whenever their spawn is back up (usually 3 every ten minutes or so I think). 
---
I just do that then do events and just go to places I know there are high level enemies to farm. Once I’ve gotten a couple of SCORE levels from that and the dailies I usually ease off and just play. 
---
I’m by no means making the most of it or playing for hours on end, but I’m score level 43 now. Add the “free” ten levels from the score earned from the board, as well as the double XP coming up and the double score and it should be a breeze. The double XP and mob/line in the sand farm should make it insane. I reckon I could manage 4 levels a day when that’s on.
---
Hello, make sure you are going for an unclaimed workshop, one that isn’t owned by anyone at the time. The time to claim is a lot faster than if you are trying to take it from someone. If there is someone harassing you you can do a “server hop.” Log off to main screen and log on again, and most likely you will be in a different instance of the game with different people. I’m sorry you had that experience. Most people I’ve seen are truly helpful and nice.
---
Do you not know how concepts work? Things can change in a games development life cycle, and yeah if cared to look for the concept art, instead of trying to push your narrative you would've seen in fact there is scorchbeast concept art showing a version that was a vulture.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scorchbeast?file=FO76_scorchbeast_concept_art_03.jpg
---
See....
---
For a VATS Junkie build, Hard Lemonade is great. Gives bonus AP and AP regen.
---
Plans are my biggest sellers.
---
I grind for cosmetics and whatever other bullshit...if I have god tier weapons / armor that make it that much easier?  awesome...
---
 I don't bullshit around with the Legendary vendor or whatnot....My setup is suiting me just fine at Level 312
---
Oooh so good for the ss jet pack if I make a ton
---
1 piece of Chameleon is the same as 5 in most situations. 
---
Chameleon stacks by making you less visible (more invisible) but it doesn't make NPC's spot you any less.
---
Having 1 Chameleon piece, gives you the invisibility while also allowing 4 other major armour effects, without affecting your stealthiness (for PvE). 
---
I've also heard there is a slight benefit of having Chamelon mutation, even with normal armour on.
---
I’m gonna get to making some
---
I've seen that too, not many people do events no more and they're rarer too. Yet event teams are the most popular regardless.
---
People have floating houses as it's easy to blueprint and move. However, I do agree it's silly. We need better placement ability for larger structures. Also we need better support structures so we can make stilt houses that look good as the foundation choices we have are slim.  
---
On the point about pristine decor. We don't have enough grimy options. I want well worn, looks like I found them in a dump, decorations, beds etc without them being either very broken or boring. I think all the Atom shop items need a dirty option too.
---
A lot are just selfish and have the "don't tell me how I should play the game" attitude.
---
I've actually just changed my signs around. One says buy my shit stash is full, and my other character says need drug money junkies build. I'm going to be switching them again soon.
---
Just as an example with friends who had infinite scrips... they used approx 50k of scrip withing short time and only got 2 more or less godrolled items out of murgh
---
They’re not too bad, not brilliant, but still decent.
---
 I use a Instigating double barrel if I need to one shot an enemy quick. Got a vampire double barrel for quick heal as I play solo a lot, and an explosive pump for crowd control for solo/team play and finally a medic combat shotgun for team play.
---
I'm good I set up Teams so I don't have to follow imposed rules by entitled players who apparently have such broken builds they need to keep making posts about such a petty topic.
---
Maybe save them in case they are rare
---
I fart in your general direction!
---
The components are pretty easy to get too - I think it’s sugar, acid, boiled water, and wood - so it’s something pretty easy to get.
---
Hmmm im not able to find your gamer ID, try adding me, galvarium69 🙏
---
The previous dupe allowed for plenty of caps lol
---
NICE! Haven't seen that one yet.
---
Or they can honestly use that stuff because they are lower level.  My alt is 41 so the stuff that drops is useful to that toon.
---
Yes, XBox was flooded with newbies this past weekend.  It's funny because by Sunday many of them had ranked up to level 15-40 and they were the only one who showed up for my last nuke launch.  By the time we got down to 10 minutes and the SBQ hadn't even mutated I just gave up and farmed XP by killing all the scorched and other beasts being dropped by her.  At one point I had to stop and laugh as there were no less than 5 noobs with their hands up in the air wanting to get revived.  And yes sales were down.
---
Insulting people!
---
Make a new item called 'incomplete module' and when you get three you can craft a legendary module.
---
Hit ctrl-c, the second column in the upper right is "teams". Open that. Go to your name. Open that. It will have a choice to "change team objective". Click on it and choose a new objective. Close the menu. Go **** yourself troll.
---
I think this is what happened to me! I found a bag at a train station that was chock full of plans... Mostly mounted heads and stuff, but multiple copies of everything.  I was worried it might be duped items, but don't know how to tell. I shared them with my bf and still have heaps left.
---
It is a scorchbeast, it's not THE scorchbeast because we have the final version, but I'll say it again, at one point in development it was a scorchbeast, you can see the similarities in model and design. 
---
Like I already said, it's possible they could reuse the model for something else down the line, but that doesn't change it's origin of being a scorchbeast during one point of the games development.
---
Yeah could be this
---
Damm seems easy to make then huh
---
If your big into crafting recipes and searching for components than go for it, but if it's not your cup of tea then maybe you can get a decent profit off of it. Again I dont know the rarity of those recipes
---
Leave them at overpriced player vendors, usually with a single piece of fertilizer.
---
It's 76's method of protesting high prices or something.
---
God, yes.  I am overloaded with worthless, heavy legendaries.  I either can't sell them (they're not good) or *can't* sell them (they're bullion-based), my stash is overflowing, and 150/day barely makes a dent.
---
You know what else would help?  If Bethesda could make "heavy weapons" a separate category from the Purveyor.
---
That challenge is bugged. I completed a NW character and world challenge on my alt and it counted off the complete Daily NW challenge
---
First, I love your edit about grammarly. Second, I agree! I either want to be able to scrap it (with a "are you sure?" notice or a tagging feature for things to never ever scrap) or be able to get unlimited scripts - or at least like 2000 scripts a day. The current limit is just insane.
---
Well seeing what it’s good for I think I’m gonna make a ton for the ss jet pack
---
"fandom" sorry, but I'm not going on a fandom wiki. I said what I said and many other people have also stated the same. It's not a scorchbeast. It never will be a scorchbeast. Good day.
---
Open you Social Tab as a Public Team Leader. Move over to the Team Tab and click on your own name. 
---
Change Public Team Goal should be the top option.
---
Th- thats the point...
---
I don't agree you are "good". Do you share cards or are you a fucktard? simple as that. If you do, why even comment. If you don't see above.
---
And that literally is not the same creature, so moot point.
---
Finnallylyy someone gets it, I wish you'd see my 2 camps, beautiful
---
Alrighty will do! Ill join the discord later today 😁👍
---
&gt;non magic shotguns
---
What's a magic weapon?
---
Yes they did. 
---
"Oh sorry did you use many points to make your shotguns not shit? Nah.."
---
Its fucking Bethesda all over. They'll allow bullies and dupers and scammers, but god fucking help you if you use all your hard earned points to upgrade your shotgun perks.
---
Can we please stop blaming players for this stuff and instead place the blame where it lies, on Bethesda? These events should be instanced in some fashion and you should accept the option to _join_ the event. The timer ticks down, when it hits 0, everyone that wanted to join is fast-traveled to the event start, and then boom, the event starts with everyone in place and prepared to go. 
---
While people wait, there should be the option to read the instructions, get educated on how to play the event that's ahead. Then when things kick off everyone should be _roughly_ on the same page, and ready to get the party started. Instead we have this really awkward setup from Bethesda which mostly promotes this exact behavior.
---
98% of the events in the game can be _easily_ soloed. Then we have these 2-3 that you legitimately need a team for. Also if you're not reading around online, which most people are not, these events don't have any clear reasons to see through to completion. Sure, you and I know that Project Paradise has some nice rewards if you 100% it, but most folks just don't have a clue. 
---
The event system is a million times better than what Bethesda started with, but it still needs a good deal of work. Fasnacht was a great event because it does _sorta_ force everyone to the same place, at the same time, to do the same event together. All these other events let chaos reign, and then folks complain at the _players_ for dipping into chaos.
---
Thats the thing. I dont mind, I'm just fed up of the complaining. They don't have to do every one of them and like you said, the 1000 on the weekly is a lot and honestly it is only 3
---
Plus nuclear winter perk points xD
---
No, being online during reset causes it. Ive had it happen multiple times and I wasn't anywhere near NW
---
I think they added more Dailies to make up for all the S.C.O.R.E. the game has been cheating us out of with the Auto-Complete! It is still not enough tho!
---
Oh yeah so I see you are trying a heavy build :) I have one myself! So yeah I’m looking forward to helping out! Are you on Xbox by any chance?
---
I'm sure at some point they'll do a 5 level bundle that they will give away to reimburse people.
---
Awesome, thx for the share.
---
I like building my camps small, look lived in, and somewhat realistic as well. I just found the post half arrogant and decided to share my two cents.
---
Well he is living in an environment surrounded by danger. You should be worried when he stops barking.
---
ESO had an option to lock or hide items you didn’t want to modify. I don’t remember specifics from it, since I haven’t played in almost 2 years.
---
+karma
---
not a huge help but I trade the 1 start heavy stuff first to maximize storage, also can just drop other stuff for low level players or sell them for 0 in your vending machines.
---
I’m going to do this, especially for stuff I usually keep in stash. That’ll help a bunch.
---
I don't care for NW, but did it long enough to get the Ghillie suit.  In that time, I've learned to love it for one thing and one thing only.. playing hide and seek. I can't realistically beat many people in the PVP twitch fest, I rely on VATS a lot in PVE, but I'm exceedingly good at hiding.  I usually make it to top 10, or even top 5, while playing and the suit has made it even better.  I enjoy the adrenaline of hiding and running and making people work for teabagging my corpse.  I'll keep doing the daily NW challenge mostly for the extra SCORE, and a little adrenaline rush.  Unless one comes up for kill a player in NW, and then I'm out for that one.
---
Why do they need more weeklies?
---
2 extra dailies x 250 means 500 extra per day... 3500 per week. Over the remaining 8 weeks that is an additional 28,000 score available.  That’s more than the score required in final 8 tiers combined. 
---
Plus upcoming double xp. 
---
Plus double daily score weekend coming up.
---
But I want the stuff. i just don't want to spend hours every day grinding. They should have increased the SCORE rewards instead.
---
What *is*?
---
Thank you 👍 hope the trick works for you
---
Take your time. Level up. Explore. Don’t rush for end game gear, that’s how people get burned out.
---
Travel to the Welch Railway station, murder all the mole miners there (fire down at them from the railway dock overlooking the town, its an excellent defensive position as they will all try to fight their way uphill towards you. Then visit the blackwater mine near whitespring train station and slaughter all the moleminers inside it. Server hop and repeat.
---
Look at this video:
---
https://youtu.be/AHu4CErJXU4
---
I share but I don't get bent out of shape if someone doesn't. 
---
My build is finished I don't need extra cards but I do appreciate them. Everyone does. 
---
Should it be a necessity to stay on a Public Team? Nope
---
If you honestly keep kicking people why not use a private team. By the way you keep going on about all the rules to staying in your 1 of MANY Public Teams. 
---
Do you ever hit max Bonded?
---
Seems pointless.
---
I have played since day one. I can probably count on one hand and have a finger or two left over of the number of God tier weps or armor I have been given
---
Nah. Bash damage is only beneficial on explosives with bloody. I’d say it’s 1.5k or scrip
---
Outside of Xmas I can remember seeing 2, both at Harpers. This is in 1,000+ hours.
---
I would just like to be able to sell the stupid floater grenades i have like 100 of the damn things.
---
Aka  you've been proven wrong but don't want to admit it. Either way since you have such a hate for the fandom site, how about the actual artists page, where you can also see the concept art labeled as scorchbeast concept art.
---
https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Yaoeoq
---
Of course you'll find a reason to disagree since you don't wanna be wrong
---
Wait ... so my Public Team pals can still kill me with their trap camps? Good to know.
---
Do you not know how concept art works?! You can't be this dense...
---
The favourite option would work, but everyone's limited to a number of items you can fit on your quickbar. In between the weapons and meds I hotkey, I'm thinking most people wouldn't have enough room to hotkey all of their side weapons and clothing.
---
The intent is not to sell but show it off. I also have my jumbo Mr fuzzy at 30k but they can't be displayed in my camp. I use these as the gain access to inventory exploit so my machines never go empty. Especially on my machine that gives everything for free.
---
PvP may not be my favorite cup of tea, but NW isn't as bad as some make it out to be. I've improved my aim a lot and have learned those areas much more thoroughly.  It is nice to play in  low level  areas that high levels don't play in normally. It is definitely better to play with friends than alone tho.
---
I did double brick walls for my house. It is white inside and white outside. I think it looks even better that way and white walls match that keypad door.
---
I'm curious as to what you are trying to do here.  
---
Are you trying to see people's response to the dupe wave? Or are you trying to emphasise the problem?
---
I've seen you posting around here and in the trade sub. You aren't new and unaware, like you are trying to appear.
---
Best thing to do is find a proper guild/group and integrate. Randoms rarely work out but people who create and join a society with websites/discord etc usually are more reliable and worth the effort. There’s accountability and structure and a reason for getting together and creating stuff or chatting. Friendships follow. 
---
I haven’t done it for a long time but I haven’t needed to. I found a group a long time ago and 15 years later we’re still good friends and met up IRL etc. That’s definitely not the norm I imagine but it happens, and even though I’ve met some cool people randomly in this game it’s never really turned into anything other than the occasional brief game session. 
---
I would definitely seek out groups if I wanted more structured and reliable teams etc but right now I’m on the score grind like most people and play infrequently/weird times and not for that long. 
---
Once this is over I am definitely considering finding a good group myself for this game.
---
Where was that?
---
That's scrip. The pricing tool is junk as well. But instigating on a gp is junk. Bash damage is junk. Its just not a good gun
---
They do not care about your fleshy bits.  I am more afraid of them than I am a SBQ.
---
Or one that forages for berries and shit.
---
Bashing dmg can make a weapon make magic dmg. Not sure on this one if the effect can be triggered but you can try, il recommend to use a beam splitter on it to make up with the lack of firerate and best is always to boost the dmg by playing bloodied with it
---
Nuka-moth!
---
Exactly... Most of the NW dailies I will avoid, with all the XP buffs in patch 20 I could get 300 score from the repeatable faster than it takes to get 9 creature kills in NW for instance.  But I will log into NW just enough to get the weekly done, and I will try to pick the quick and easy challenges throughout the week.
---
Read above they are display only to avoid the empty machine exploit.
---
What about leaving them in the first chest you find when starting the game, does that disappear?
---
With the survive 30 minutes, I hate to say it but I totally AFK, takes longer but I'll do things around my house and restart the process when I see I died
---
Right, "everyone does". Yet I'm "bent out of shape" if I don't like people who cant spend one second to try and enrich everyone else's experience? It is not a necessity, but it is a COURTESY. I would rather lose 1 bond that help some shitheel who does not want to help me.
---
This is such a big issue. The atom shop cranks out all this undamaged, brand new looking stuff and it only further stands out in the world of the game. It's almost like the people designing atom shop decorations have never played a Fallout game. At least the Slocum's Joe stuff is dirty and scratched looking, hopefully they keep going in that direction.
---
My favorite was I was hiding in a bush and a group of 4 people in power suits show up making noise around my bush. They then built their camp literally right around me and only when they placed a floor tile that removed my bush did I think about running. I figured I would be dead in seconds anyways, so decided to just sit there where I had been. It took them 3 1/2 minutes of me crouch on the ground nothing hiding me before one of them finally walked up and shot me.
---
And where’s control C on X box or PS4 then?
---
I am finding that the new team dynamic is helping with me finding active players to add to my friend's list.
---
Can you still send me that ticket number anyways? I'd like to get more eyes on this.
---
They haven’t nerfed them recently. Not sure how much you rely on adrenaline, but it’s broken atm.
---
it's like he's drunk or something
---
Cranberry glade. I find pets all the time over there. Takes a few server hops first though
---
How the fuck would I know that? Are you sub-83?
---
Yeah, but that happens irl. It's actually one of the few effects that look semi realistic.
---
The splitter on a non explosive gp makes it shoot a green fog. It's not like a laser
---
Yea very True on the .50bmg ammo. Standard ball, ap, incendiary, ap-i, explosive... so much to coole.
---
Yea a two shot twin barreled .50cal would be amaaaazing
---
I’m near vault 76 it just my play style tho I rather sell fast and quick then wait and profit
---
I'd rather not.    
---
I've accidentally scrapped regular weapons which sucked until I got another one and modded it again. Even with the warning people can still make mistakes. I do believe the miner girl should give you the option for 'scrap for materials' and if  you want script instead you can go to the machine.
---
Get rid of them.    
---
I've never used them and I don't remember how much they weigh. It's not worth hoarding.
---
Furious 50. cal and power armor, but you have to be perked into it. It’s an amazing weapon and a boss killer. Very costly to make 50 cal though.
---
Wait until you get so deep that you hit max name limit and can't even rename legendary weapons and armour as scrap 😂👈
---
I think it might be mistaking the Bash suitability for the Minigun. The Minigun with the Shredder mod, and the Basher perk, is not half bad for stagger locking stuff.
---
Because if there are two more weeklies I can take a day or two off from the game and feel better knowing that I definitely won’t miss anything. Plus I’ve been effected by the autocompleted challenges twice now and I’m sure it’s going to happen again
---
just drop them for the most part, some rare ones have value, and naturally its very difficult to even know which ones
---
I'd suggest having CAMP visitors sing "South Park" songs.  I'd actually listen to Daguerre singing along with Cartman's "Poker Face" or "Let's Fighting Love."
---
That would be awesome, especially with the much higher limit
---
Then you get the two dialogs at once where “finally someone to get my water cooled bone saw”, with the “We could of really used that dynamite to make another well at our settlements” and you get hung up.  Or the standing in his bunk bed.  Come to think of it he is an important guy and he has a bunk bed.  I have caught him in bed at noon, which goes to the drunk thought
---
Are you on PC?    
---
What kind of 'worthless' ones are they?
---
Like Legendary Modules?
---
The Stealth Suit is also preferable for Radiation Rumble (if you can deal with the hit to Carry Weight).  But these circumstances are indeed quite limited.
---
I kinda like Nw. The biggest problem I have with this mode is that I always spawn like 30 seconds later than everyone else. I play with my boyfriend and we have our screens next to each other. He plays on a ps4pro and I play on the normal Ps4. By the time my loading screen ends he already has full equipment. I think that's unfair af and could be prevented by something like a countdown at the beginning.
---
on average, 1 or 2 days a week, someone will clear out my vendor and put me at max caps, then i gotta go do the same at someone elses camp
---
I run cannibal during one violent night and eat every single ghoul
---
Then my information is wrong. Thanks for the correction :)
---
Nooooo check the rate of fire if it is over 200 it’s a magic gun don’t scrip it look up magic weapons on yt
---
It's an 11 week season. You're almost 1/3rd of the way there after 3 weeks and there's a SCORE buff coming up. Pretty sure you're gonna complete it.
---
Why does the mechanic even work this way? People shouldn't have to weaken themselves it's counter intuitive. I just don't get the tagging system especially when it's so easy to get into one shot territory in this game.
---
Consider hitting me up then!
---
Thanks for chuckles.
---
He can collect water-cooled bonesaws. Raiders love that shit.
---
Yeah but due to the stink around this game it’s a lot of crazy high levels and beginners everywhere
---
All the Meat percent stack for now ( melee damage i mean )
---
Actually over 150, I’m a stable genius
---
Where do you get 11 weeks from? 
---
And I don’t think I’m going to complete it because work is going to pretty crazy in a few weeks.
---
Edit: from the season announcement:
---
&gt;	The Legendary Run: Our first 10-week Season begins today! Race across the galaxy against the evil Dr. Zorbo and unlock unique cosmetics, in-game currencies, and much more along the way.
---
If you get a low level weapon that's good, just upgrade it all the way and put for like 400 caps. You'll get low levels to buy stuff. Stims for like 5 caps. Give them what they need.
---
Enforcer perk and a shotgun. Each shotgun pellet (8 total) counts separate on the enforcer perk, making a couple shots nearly guarentee limb cripple. Cripple legs to make more manageable and if you cripple all body parts it will self-destruct.
---
I've never had it happen to me during reset in adventure mode. I have also never entered NW.
---
Maybe I am just really lucky?!
---
Sure you are. If you are stable why the helmet?
---
Yeah don't go to YouTube for fallout info. All the thumbnails are "BEST EVER GUN IN ALL OF FALLOUT SUPER GOD TEIR" and it's just a BS vid.  (If you want decent fallout related news and such, check out juicehead).

Me and my husband have to stop at very camp and rate them. Floating camps seldom get above a C rating.

Finally, someone with the guts to help

Ahh good to know 😂 then i guess it wont work on this gp
---
Almost like they have reincarnated Preston.....
---
As of last night, I, a level 26, can attest to the fact that "Campfire tales" or whatever its called, cannot be done solo.
---
I disagree that people who don't repair the extractors are worse than 1 shotters. UF is valuable for 2 things imo: notes and scrip. You get the notes as long as you finish the event, which i do not recall ever failing in hundreds of attempts. And scrip requires everyone to not be a butthole and let people get their whacks in. 1 jackoff can screw over everybody there, to hell with the extractors.
---
And insulting notes
---
Mostly secret service armor, unfortunately.
---
Now I want a legendary rad roach public event that is triggered by a nuke drop
---
They added an extra weekly last week (the NW one)
---
Breaks do come as relief, after a while. Think how much effort ( or money ) you need to get to rank 100. Now imagine there should be season after that, and after that, and after that... There will always be *something new to get*, but as you probably know, you don't *need* it. It's just a trap to grab your cash.
---
I don't understand this mindset at all. What are you doing in the game if not continually improving your build and gear? Seriously, what else is there to do?
---
This is such a good idea, thank you for the tip!
---
Rush a head at mach 6 disregarding level get good fall or behind go 4 endgame loot to PvP in
---
Y yo pipboi red?
---
Thats Ward, Beckett is one of the Allies.
---
While I am a strong believer you should just build what you want, I am totally  here for this post.  Apparently when the bombs fell, cockroaches and tacky-ass designers survived.
---
you mean Ward?
---
There was nothing immature about my approach to you. You challenging my adulthood is uninteresting. Have a nice day!
---
Bragging about doing a good deed kinda ruins it :\
---
Not only the Purveyor: I did get a couple The Fixer from an Ally fetch quest for a weapon case. However, I am pretty sure that one has to know the plan for that to happen.
---
I had to do this to someone as well ( i have a cliff base) i was at 20K caps and i saw someone was buying plans, then two weapons i had at 4K each...i saw 29K an i knew they were going to keep buying so i had to log off (was in the middle of an event too) thy probably fell to their death but it wasnt intentional
---
Just give them to noobs haha someone somewhere will take your trash leggies happily
---
BURN THE WITCH! BURN THE WITCH!
---
I couldn't stand his constant whining, he and Daguerre are both so annoying. The Raider punk is my fave ally, atleast hes upbeat and happy, doesn't bitch and moan.
---
hu thought it was just me everything looks like its made of rubber or shiny metal
---
 *browsing each other's inventories* 
---
Sounds like a good time
---
Its insane to me weapons like that can exist.
---
they just need let us have robot companions or bring back dogmeat, it would be nice to have a robot running a round with you, also to be able to upgrade them would be nice
---
Note to self start checking vendors
---
I was hoping to be able to get meat from human enemies.
---
And have more recipes.
---
Not... sushi style.
---
why not friend them and rejoin them, or ask them for the item, shouldnt really be a big deal to work it out no matter the cause.
---
lmao, i love you man and i get your sarcasm.
---
I can confirm this is not true
---
Serum Recipes, Bow/Crossbow Mods if you have alts.
---
I’ll buy it for 1,400c
---
this sounds interesting, BUT, it's too organized and well thought out... hmm...
---
... wait, this is similar to the idea of Jar-Jar secretly being a Sith Lord... maybe bethesda does all these bumbling servers and  "bugs" and stuff on purpose, but really has alterior motives.... hmmmm
---
So I tested it with the spliter and it just turns it into a plasma flamer with an incredible short range. Also it doesn't seem to turn it into a magic weapon either. Straight up scrip fodder. But thanks for clarifying.
---
The big thing is that hardly anyone knows to get the shutdown codes for ARIC-4 and start the experiment with quericus running the show so the animals regenerate each wave. The code for the basement is 970930 for any intrested.

No thank you, I do not need accidenlty scrapping my legendary items. If FO76 had a lock for items to prevent selling or scrapping but in it's current state this is a horrible idea. Plus, if you need the scrap off legendaries what are you doing wrong?
---
There's been one in an ATX datamine do at some point we should get one. There's been a few things in there that still haven't shown up though.
---
I log off because I can’t script the amount of legendaries in my inventory.. *Overencumbered* is like the anchor of all Bethesda games whatever..  and it’s completely funny how it affects the endgame of their online flagship (I hate eso) like bare trollage..
---
I did that on purpose three times. Loading times and lag make me sad. 
---
I have only launched one nuke. My main.
---
For crafting legendary armour and weapons. You need to buy the wastelanders bullion items to use them.
---
I do have a question though, small generator with the power connector on top of it connected with the wire hidden inside of a dresser or whatever was enough to power all of those lights? Or did you hide multiple small generators? Or is it simply just a bug
---
Mine serves no form or function but to give me +5xp and make things
---
Once the colossus event launches, I'd like to see Project Paradise and Radiation Rumble removed from the public events pool and set to triggers with cooldowns. Then you'd have SBQ, Imposter, Colossus, PP and RR as an end game loop and truthfully, that's solid. That's worth logging in for.
---
Yeah I was trying for my 2nd NW daily top go 2/3 for the weekly, with plans to complete after reset, but I got the revive 3/3 players challenge and that completed the SCORE challenge. Maybe Bethesda just got their wording wrong and its just meant to be "Complete 3 NW challenges"
---
Can't paint unarmed weapons and some armor, not a solution.
---
Burner accounts for the dupe thats rampant
---
Computer
---
Brilliant idea!
---
Make it so number one
---
Thx for letting me know
---
I’m surprised they don’t add the catalog for fallout 3 , NV and 4 to the mix
---
I prefer to fight 10 of them than a Mirelurk King
---
when you go to craft a legendary piece, say the ss armor, you will use one. it shows up on the side as an "ingredient". you don't have to actively select and use it; it uses itself if you have one.
---
Ahh k
---
On PC it's built into most mod managers(I think you can do it in the INI too).
---
Brilliant!  
---
However the only problem is what people who start playing the game after the season is over?  Its probably not going to be available next season so what would they do with ammo points?  Yes I know they could go to someone's camp an use them but requiring them to do that would not be cool.
---
Be sure and scrap all of your junk before storing it.  And if you're cleaning your storage out don't just trash the junk, bulk it and sell it. You'll need plastic to bulk it.
---
Thanks didn't know if they still spawned there or changed after Wastelanders
---
Of course you were manipulated to stay - that's how these games work.  Destiny 2 is doing the same thing with seasons now.
---
Personally, I just walk away from games for a while until they drop more content and story-heavy DLC (like Destiny 2's upcoming fall stuff), then play more, then walk away again when that's used up.  There is plenty of stuff coming up this Fall that you can play in between.... Assassin's Creed, Cyberpunk, Last of Us 2, etc.
---
What I mean is, if you like the game, don't fully quit it, just play it on your own terms.
---
I use a + symbol but this isn't a fix I have almost accidentally sold items marked like that when my cursor skipped around. We need a lock on items.
---
Use shotgun headshot vats.
---
Good idea, I'll try that!
---
Yeah I completed one challenge and it marked two completed. Not going to argue with it though lol.
---
I like selling ammo and handing it out to randomers.
---
If you give everybody the ammo they want and nothing else, you actually lose a decent chunk of community in the game.
---
The game isn't about having everything handed to you on a plate.
---
What next? Instead of (insert reward) we get points that we can use to buy own reward!
---
Hell, instead of collecting items in the wasteland, why not make every item worth a point value? We can then use these points do buy the scrap we want! Want some screws? Cool. Loot 10 plastic knives and you can have 20 screws!
---
You'll need more than 500 scrip worth to get decent rolls though, unless you're really lucky :-)
---
The mod isn't in the game. It seems like they just copy and pasted the Revolver and retextured it.
---
It works for 90% of the items and everything else can be favorited.  It works just fine.
---
Shes way too fucking annoying with her "i found a friend" speech, wa
---
walking around giving the same speech every 5 minutes like a crazy person.
---
I know, I don’t understand making the shotty hit like bb gun.  I suggest you find one with the right perks on it and use vats.
---
He had a dream about the Mothman last night...
---
I have.  The ballistic damage is higher than the heal from the rads so eventually it kills them but it does work against itself if that's what you're asking.
---
Others have covered most of it lol, modules are stored in your Misc tab
---
no thanks, I'd rather not have the ability to scrap my gear by accident
---
Well I only did it cuz I read about someone doing it and thought that would be a nice thing to do. People might now read this and think the same.
---
Its not bragging, its sharing.
---
Got a lvl 15 bloodied double barrel. I still wield it with my alt at lvl 46, the damage it can do (esp. with vats) is just insane.
---
Been killing max level enemies with this character since like lvl 20 when I could use my first unyielding armor pieces.
---
I assume as much....
---
No it was just that one generator. The house is 3x3 and the dresser is pretty much in the middle up stairs so it powers all 😊 give it a try &amp; if your in a bigger house I suppose you could hide another one in another item
---
Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean people aren't out to get you....
---
But atleast bethesda should be making rad resistance stats on armor a realistic guage of how much protection you are actually getting.  The invisible rad reduction on some armors is kinda dumb because if a player didn't search up much they would be led to believe they could achieve equall haz protection with 1000 rad protection.
---
Really? I have to try that what mods?
---
I just want clean toilets. Please Bethesda!
---
Yogi ribs aren’t vegan?
---
An interesting suggestion.  Sure beats being handed a ton of Missiles, Mini-Nukes, or Fusion Cores.
---
If it's not locked, it's open for that reason! Many higher level players purposely leave collectors unlocked to help out newbies, so don't feel guilty. It's literally what it's there for!
---
Bruh,you're not even scratching the surface. I have like 7 melee meat buffs active when I fight the queen for close to 200% damage. Basically every meat and their refines version(expl yao guai meat and roast).
---
I feel the same way about people who kill the Queen in seconds in public servers. But if you are the one who launched the nuke then nvm. I meant when a person kills the queen that fast, not the person who launched the nuke.
---
It's white, kinda like Rose's paintjob.
---
Me too. Find a comfy bush and squat for an hour &amp; go clean my house. Come back- I’ve either won or died. Box checked
---
Semi realistic because it’s too bright. I just walked out back to let my dogs out and didn’t get blinded for 30 seconds lol
---
I saw one on a break, not insulting me. Now that's even more insulting.
---
Just spawn at Morgan town high school 3-4 dogs right away
---
Can you link it to me
---
I had a brain fart, one small generator will power all of the lights as long as it’s close enough to the lights....I was thinking the generator needed to put out as much power as was needed. By the way, you’re the man
---
yep.  if you run ore you get barely any XP and with the new seasons everyone wants the repeatable 10k XP challenge.
---
you also miss out on legendary kills.
---
If you know the build you’re set on, check out the market, there’s a bunch of good stuff up atm. 
---
Take your time with stuff, don’t just auto scrip all your old stuff, it might be valuable.
---
&gt; Lmao the anti-PvPers finally woke up
---
NW is the worst pvp mode i ever played, i rather play 90s tactical OPs or original unreal.
---
Yea I was looking for a medic combat shotgun for awhile and finally found someone with two of them, both of them two stars for 1000 caps. Was trying to decide when the camp disappeared. I was so frustrated that it led me to scour all the servers for several days straight looking for medic weapons. I went on a buying frenzy and now have like 8 medic weapons
---
always check the silos to see if someone's in there before running encryptid.
---
I think its something to do with NW and playing during the reset. 2am in Australia is the reset time and I had played heaps at that time without the challenges ever bugging out. Then earlier this week I decide to try NW for the weekly challenge and that same night I just happen to accidentally stay on past 2 am, 4 of my challenges autocompleted.
---
Considering that was the first time I had played NW, but not the first time I stayed on during the reset time, I can only assume that NW, or a combination of both, caused the issue.  
---
\*EDIT\* To be clear, I know this is already a theory, I'm just saying I agree with it.
---
That f’n yell thing they do, what kind of damage is it?
---
I keep wondering if they maybe don't realize that the groups are open and are super helpful? I don't understand why they don't have a plethora of building groups when you see a bunch of low leveled players on a server. Why wouldn't you want to speed up leveling?
---
for those that read this and decide to also afk that challenge (which is fine, you do you), the community politely asks that you queue solo to do this.
---
Steel is the easiest material to get. Just scrap every weapon, armor and tool you can find.
---
Wait for Uranium Fever to pop.  Tag as many mole miners as you can.  At the end loot them all and put on the Scrapper perk.  Right there is a workbench and you can scrap all the weapons for a TON of steel.
---
Also go to West Tek and do the same.  Tons and Tons of steel.
---
You ask people to play with and keep the ones that make something click. Just like in real life, you know.
---
No I always thought the sheepsquatch imposter has less health when I fight him alone lol.
---
(BTW I'm joking)
---
I used one for a while (two months) since it suited my BoS commando character. Bloodied Faster fire, modded to auto.
---
I was able to play with it for hours before fixing (200 percent). I only stopped using it because I found a Tesla with the same effects. 
---
It breaks faster than a SMG, sure, but... 3-5 kills? It seems to happen for some people. Not the norm.
---
you have me wondering...is Jar Jar a Fallout 76 dev?
---
Also could be this player's weapons, I was having a lot fo trouble around level 25 to 35 and then realized I was playing with level 15 guns and armor...things got a lot better for me once I upgraded.
---
June 30th to September 15th = 77 days, or 
---
#11 weeks
---
I dont, but this game is too easy and every weapon i have 1 shots every mole miner. Its bethesdas fault for not putting better loot share.
---
Deveganize ray!
---
There are 8 meat buffs;)
---
Our lord and savior game researcher, Angry Turtle, has all the guides and info you need on Youtube.
---
Yeah that’s good, I would evenly distribute points for the rest of special points though
---
Well this is the epitomy of stupid posts, you deserve some kind of reward.
---
I've been saying this since launch...! It's the same problem with XP - most of my friends stopped playing because it made more sense to us to just run around solo, rather than as a group, having to constantly worry about who managed a hit on what...
---
That said, I've seen some comments around here that the One Wasteland update in "fall" will *supposedly* be doing something about loot, at least for in events, though I dunno what.
---
Can confirm this statement. I built mine off of the high rate of fire version. I run a bloodied minigun with one of the magic perks, just upped my heavy gunner perks and it shreds even when the magic damage doesn't activate. For the minigun you either need to high speed barrel, the 25% faster fire rate legendary perk, or the explosive rounds legendary perk to get the excess of 200 fire rate, and ofcourse a magic legendary perk in addition to one of those.
---
Keep an eye out for the event Line in the Sand, if you're lucky someone will be using their tent to force the spawns into one spot, you can tag them and then loot them all after the event, then head into allegheny asylum and scrap them, with scrapper you're looking at around 1.5-2k steel or so per event. Higher if you have a high int build.
---
I thought you could only have the buff benefits of one food item at a time?
---
Legendary scorched exist very rarely in some of the areas of random spawns. But for example the scorched that spawn from scorchbeasts can never be legendary. It's really stupid, as if they weren't boring enough enemies to begin with. I avoid areas like harper's ferry if the spawn happens to be scorched because you know right away that the exp, loot, and time are all just not going to be worth it.
---
Also, it actually is possible for critters to be legendary in this game, but just like in fo4, the chances are based on enemy level, so things like radroaches have an insanely small chance of being legendary. I remember seeing a legendary squirrel up in the toxic valley last year
---
I sell all my plans for 50 caps or less. Sometimes they sell and sometimes they’ll sit for ages. I gave up on selling the mole miner gauntlet and the ultracite plans though. I drop those around the map like Johnny Appleseed 😂
---
I think it should also give you like a 5% chance (if you’re above level 50) of dropping legendary modules when you scrap a legendary item, scaling with each star of the item.
---
Then you die and have to trek back up a summit to pick up the 5 bulk oil you bought from a previous camp.
---
Oh. I never knew that.
---
🤔😯no way! You're lying!
---
Look, he's just out there doing the best he can. Imagine if your existence hinged on whether or not your insults were top tier and you're only method of interaction with people is insults. He's a trooper, man. The world's hard enough without us shooting at him.
---
Bear Arms and The Fixer were not introduced until the Wild Appalachia update.  That was DLC (i.e., not the original base content of the game at launch). 
---
That’s why I said DLC, not Wastelanders.
---
You can stack as long as the effect isnt the same
---
I want this. He and the Santa bot can insult and depress me whenever I come to camp.
---
"You smell like a ripe deathclaw corpse."
---
"At least she's still alive...unlike all the good boys and girls. They used soap. But they died. Dead children. Ho ho ho."
---
Home sweet home right there.
---
I see some people shooting down the idea because they might scrap something they didn't want to scrap. Not to sound like a jerk to those people, but I don't think a quality-of-life change like this should be avoided on the off-chance that some people might be careless while scrapping things. But, to mitigate those concerns, add a system similar to Borderlands. Add the ability to mark items as favorites without adding to the quick-wheel, and also mark items as trash so you can easily see which things you do or don't want.
---
As for some other suggestions, I see people suggesting the possibility of getting legendary modules from scrapping legendaries. Let's take it a step further. New perk card. Without it, you can scrap legendaries, but only get scrap from it. Rank 1 has a chance (let's say like 30%) of getting a module for 3 star items. Rank 2 increases the chance (75%) of getting a module from a 3 star item, adds a chance (20%) of getting one from a 2 star item. Rank 3 guarantees a module from a 3 star item, increases the chance (50%) of getting one from a 2 star item, and adds a very tiny chance (10%) of getting one from a 1 star item.
---
That system would mean 3 stars would always be a better find, and discourage people from farming easy 1 and 2 star items since the chance of getting anything useful is significantly lower. It would also give everybody the chance to ability to scrap legendaries, but also leaves a lot of it to chance, unless you fully rank up the perk card, which preserves the general nature of legendaries.
---
What people have forgot to mention is they are only used on a few weapons and armours. You craft the weapons and armour you can buy with bullion. Like the gauss mini/shot gun and secret service armour. 
---
You can't just craft a legendary gattling gun or anything like that
---
Where to find ALL of the things
---
do a uranium fever. Use scrapper perk. BOOWM! Steel.
---
It would be fun if you could select a player on the map and send your insult bot after them.
---
Don't forget to check sundew Grove when there is a Nuke down there too, had an epic fight with one the other night
---
If you are on PC, you can "fix" a lot of it by editing the .ini or using the FO76 Quick Config tool.

I turn off:
---
depth of field  
---
motion blur  
---
radial blur  
---
lens flare  
---
volumetric lighting (god rays)  
---
wetness occlusion  
---
Turning off wetness occlusion gets rid of that ridiculousness where you and the interior of buildings looks wet when it's raining outside.  I hated that so much.
---
Also, turning off grass makes the game run a whole lot smoother.
---
Well... I love screwing. Gotta craft those radium rifles!
---
*Go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!*
---
Ugh. I've got a friend who tries to make me play, "just do it you get good stuff if you grind, plus I'm really good so I'll carry you" it's not that I don't want to get good stuff or that I hate grinding, I just hate NW
---
I know, his insults are getting better though
---
I think the most brutal thing he's said to me was something like "I would say you have a face only a mother could love, but your family and everyone you know is dead." 
---
I was like "wow, that's fucking harsh..."
---
Yeah it's happening to me as well
---
Good question! I'm pretty sure I've seen it get closer to 90% or so, but I've definitely never seen it actually *filled*.
---
Also a Settlers Collectron, he collects all the stuff Ward keeps losing on a daily basis.
---
There’s always the nuclear option... ;)
---
I imagine like 30% of the players will stop playing soon, because the game is just too easy, now everyone has BE Gatling Plasmas there is no challenge or point to anything.
---
Lol
---
Just drop them for a low lev guy
---
along with the puking emote as you do it to show true disdain
---
So far in my experience i end up filling the trough A on my own while everyone is messing around, like last night a couple of low levels were hanging around angry they couldn't get a shot on the creatures attacking me. When i start Project Paradise it's because i know i can solo it, and when i see people not being helpful i kill the alpha in 3 secs before they leech off my kill. As for Encryptid, we do it as a two man team so no need to wait around since we pay for it. Haven't seen people actually complete Radiation Rumble in a long time, pretty much only used as an xp farm.
---
Sorry I was thinking Ward, Beckett I couldn’t stand and put him away for good
---
&gt;just make them available for sale to NPC vendors
---
This is the way! We certainly don't need yet another currency in this game.
---
As a bloodied PA user that runs Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocols, I can make that damage of the Unyielding people, but I have significant drawbacks.
---
Poison is insta-kill. There's no resistance against it for me.
---
I can't VATS in PA worth crap. Unyielding gives so much more bonus to AP and % chance to hit in VATS, and with the longstanding VATS/Fusion core drain bug, it's not even usable.
---
My carry weight doesn't compare to an Unyielding build.
---
I basically get the damage output for hip fire/aiming down sights but don't get any of the quality of life improvements that Unyielding brings. So it's doable, you can run PA at end game fine, but it's lack luster entirely. 
---
Unyielding is king for a reason. It gives better carry weight, VATS bonuses, higher AP, higher XP gain from the increased INT, and negates every dialogue special stat check.
---
Where as bloodied PA gets the same damage, a decent movement speed from Protocols, and that's really it. I'm tanky, sure, but no more than an Unyielding non-PA person. And Unyielding armor can have poison resist, which is my Achilles heel. 
---
Was hoping legendary perks would help, but every legendary perk card for Power Armor is garbage. Hot, flaming garbage.
---
Let's go look for some sea shanties.
---
Yep. I have a power pack never removed from my inventory. Although he sometimes gives the line about a medical scanner.
---
I played rust for about 2800 hours with the same person ... we had a falling out and I was burnt out on rust tbh .. I got 76/wastelanders  and played on my own for a couple of weeks then fasnacht happened and I kept seeing the same 3-4 people over and over even on different servers we talked on mic and after exchanging a few legendaries here and there we all talked every day on discord and played about the same time daily and now there’s probably 5-8 of us that all play together randomly on public teams or we all load into a private world and take all the workshops to make fusion cores and farm lead aluminum copper and acid etc 
---
I really can’t believe how good 99% of the fall out players are as people almost everyone is willing to help another person
---
I would say get a headset with a mic .. get discord  and just talk to people in game that level 200-400 person is probably a saint and would give you 1000+ acid or lead or more ammo than you’ve ever seen if you just ask them or some crazy 3 star they don’t need because they have no inventory space left 
---
The people I play 76 with range from lvl 12 ish to 200 everyone goes out of their way to help someone else even random players we give them our known plans make them weapons give XP boosting foods etc
---
This game is wholesome af compared to rust and there is a lot more to do here even if I do the same stuff over and over it just feels better
---
So if one is Melee Damage +10% and one is Melee Damage +20% (for example) is that considered the same effect or different?
---
Coolest one ive seen was a Behemoth/Super mutants at Abandoned Bog town take on a 3* Fog Crawler and his 2 buddies with a scorchbeast nearby that i dragged over. Got my shots in on the big three but had to hide from the Supers w the minigun
---
Behemoth crushed the Fog Crawler, scorchbeast never landed so me and the supers took it down and then i mopped the floor with all of them
---
yeah imagine some poor orphan dude playing fallout all happy and shit, then the fucking insult bot waltz through and drops that bombshell of a line on him lmao
---
SHHHHHHHHH!
---
15 min left, you still need it?
---
Remember, all you're accomplishing by killing him is wasting your ammo. Leave the poor boy alone. Stay gold, insult boy, stay gold.
---
NON PA user. Level 102.  I only use mine for SBQ/nuke zones and certain events like radiation rumble. Otherwise I'm using my secret service armor.
---
Happened to me as well. Then as soon as I maxed my rep it stopped. Which kinda stinks, was an easy 3 notes haha
---
Yeah I got an explosive build and I'm curious if grenadine actually works. Plus Molotovs are TERRIBLE. I hope the mini nuke works fine with max demolitionist and max grenadier.
---
I’d say talking down to me and mocking my points is a fairly immature way to interact with me, but ig you’re saying more about your mental age yourself than I ever could hope to. Have a good one lol.
---
People would also spam this box by dumping aload of crap in there that the camp owner would have to sort out. Only way it would work is if it could hold a maximum number of items
---
the power pack! that's the other thing that was just laying on the ground with the osmosis kit....weird.
---
of course this'll be the bug that Beth prioritizes to fix :)
---
Yeah, I like the idea. I’d jump in on an event like that. Although running solo and having all the bots and turrets aggro, that’s some sweet XP right there.
---
It’s a tin foil hat to stop the aliens reading my thoughts
---
Maybe it could have like a 50-100 pound limit and a way to sort through by item type?
---
I know. I dumb dumb. sorry.
---
They’re a spawn in the asylum
---
This I can get behind
---
My wife and I play together exclusively. Only in the past week or so did we start doing the public teams. 
---
Most of the time I start the team - we usually do Builder so everything we do gives us a little more XP. We are on PS4. We stay on mike and talk to each other. So far everyone else who has joined has not been on mike, and we aren't even sure if they hear us.
---
The extra perks make totally worth doing and frankly makes private teams kinda silly. You don't know what you'll get (besides the public team perk) but even if you just have a charisma card that increases with more players, that will work better if randos join. You also get the caps from others finishing quests, and more free travel locations. 
---
I think the only things you lose deal with building and unlocking. While in the public team you won't be able to build at your brother's camp, or open his stuff without becoming wanted. But you can always switch over to private when you want to do that.
---
So start a team or join a team. Do it today! :-) The worst case you get a mouth breather and you mute him or switch over to a different chat system with your brother.
---
Yep, of the top of my head easy ones I used to use was mutant hound meat, deathclaw and sheepsquatch meat. Theres many more combos but I found these one fairly easy to keep up
---
Dude the junk storage issue is only there to pressure people into buying a feature they lied about being able to implement.
---
Add Chems to that.
---
Or dump unwanted stuff at Vault 76 for new characters/players, to use or sell.
---
Should int be a little higher than he others for xp. Also I have marsupial so -4 intelligence.
---
The insult bot can be pretty savage sometimes.
---
Oh yeah my bad
---
Wasn't there a grenade that drops in the quest that has to be used to complete it?
---
Also wait at least 30 mins after
---
Ones that give just strength dont stack though, that's why I use deathclaw good boost and easy to find
---
Fixed
---
Dunno about that, I've had the bug since Wastelanders update, think I did the actual fetch quest once before it happened, haven't had to do it since.
---
can't wait to get my box full of "fertilizer" that someone leaves me :)
---
What if the insult bot only insulted visitors to your camp and complemented you when you were there?
---
“My operator has a higher dps than you.”
---
Fetchez la vache
---
Please no more special currencies. Let us sell plans and ammo to the NPC vendors.
---
 This bug is becoming more and more common with each patch. Had a legendary mirelurk queen disappear during the strangler heart event. Everyone there put up the thumbs down emote.
---
What do you mean by auto complete?
---
They'll find something else to grind for. It's not like we need any of this stuff. We're all gearing up for the Assaultron apocalypse when I'm still one shotting the things I normally run into with a dcg I found grinding westtek. I'm almost done with my t65, then I'll grind a decent gauss mini, then I'll grind out what ever the BOS wander in with. Then I'll go back to grinding Distant Thunder when I dont feel like doing anything else.
---
I would prefer to be able to send insult "telegrams" from the train stations to other people on the server.
---
Despite having a better fixer I've gone back to using my handmade for a while.  After having my Armco machine set to .308 for a while I tried it with 5.56 and holy crap it makes that stuff fast.  If I'm not doing queen runs or something ammo intensive the machine makes ammo for the handmade faster than I can use it.
---
Not that I lack the resources to craft a ton of whatever ammo I need, but not having to bother switching perk cards in and out to craft is fricken awesome.  Plus the handmade has all kinds of cool skins whereas the fixer can look like a fixer....and that's about it lol.
---
Mothman came off third best here   [https://imgur.com/0mp7X3I](https://imgur.com/0mp7X3I)
---
Killing the insult bot is a good thing! Helps it respawn faster and insult more people.
---
Yes.  Gulpers, Wendigo, and Sloths can all ambush from trees.
---
There will still be a hundred posts of 'why did my dailies complete?' Or 'Is there a bug with the challenges?'
---
you should drop a brown bag of fertilizer at their door.
---
That’s exactly what I’m looking for
---
You use an automatic? Lucky you, I can't seem to keep myself in ammo for those.
---
Weird. I've only had the bug since the Legendary Run Update.
---
I'm going to enjoy milking it as long as I can.
---
I like themed camps. Mine is just a modern house like the overseer did. We're the best and brightest of america ,not some dork who can't even nail a wall!
---
But if you feel like a raider stick with the theme,like responders,or mothman.
---
The empty giant houses.... I bet those are kids playing dreamhouse,untill they hit building limits.Once they do they can only decorate as kids.
---
It gets even better with the bug to do his quest every time you log in. Bring in the notes
---
ffxiv has this feature for bards with a range of instruments. some groups put on full shows
---
the unberable suffering of a architect that survived nuclear apocalypse. 
---
stay strong.
---
They will complete. Automatically. And you will not receive score for them. Has been happening with the dailys for a long time.
---
😂😂😂
---
It has been easy for the most part so idk what the problem is. Kill 9 creatures was the hardest so far. Rez a player 2 times was cake. A cliff and a friend and i got it done in 1 match. Lol
---
Building on that, if there were insult categories like "vendor selection sucks", "your prices are whack" or "your camp is an abomination".
---
Be cool to enter a building and some player is playing a jazzy tune, or have bands and such. Give us roleplay options
---
Problem at the moment is there is a cap of 2000, if that were to get removed then it would be an excellent idea.
---
I just want a Responders protectron, like Steelheart!
---
SHHH!
---
was not serious,  its all good
---
just nice, not have to go through that one every day.
---
Cav
---
It was hard at first but now I can one-shot pretty much anything outside of the SBQ, Encrypted, or a sheepsquatch
---
in theory not, but if you have any time away, or days you can't play, you probably should still.  they aren't generally THAT difficult.  thought the kill 9 creatures one took me much longer then I care to admit.
---
Sounds good in principle, but it might better to limit it to caps, aid and/or junk. 
---
In either scenario, it would be best to have it separate from main storage/wallet, though I wouldn’t hold my breath over it being implemented that way, which means that the second best option is to limit it by amount (maybe 10 items) or weight (10 kg), the later being the reason I would avoid including weapons &amp; armor as part of this system.
---
Ooooh... sometimes the bugs are beneficial...like honey bees! :)
---
He just tells me to either "Hush," "The Only Healthcare you need is a Good pair of shoes" or "Pull my finger" but he is always "too late" with the last one.
---
My go-to method of taking assaultrons down is to equip a high damage shotgun paired with the enforcer perk, and take out one/both of the legs so it's pretty much immobile. After that, it's a lot easier to find some cover to block the beam blast, and be able to take it out without worrying about it charging and wrecking you.
---
I wish I was rich enough to give this comment an award. Never in a million years did I think I'd see a Troll 2 reference on here!
---
It's so frustrating. I'm trying to get my rep with raiders to friendly so I can start buying crossbow mods for my bow build. Getting bodied by the damn quest lmao
---
God mode is fun eh?
---
I got this too, best bug ever. Just talk to Ward, get my completion, and let him get back to his nap.
---
Thats some level 20 intimidation that won't be misintepreted
---
lol...I've already been told...people are down voting the post, so it'll be buried soon :)
---
Shadowed was fixed except for wood armor.

---
I would honestly love this, but then I love protectrons in general and welcome any version I can have in my C.A.M.P.
---
don't even need a cliff, just spawn on the edge and stand in the fire
---
absolutely. small mercies.
---
I got someone. Thank you!
---
You really need to go watch Angry Turtles video on this exact topic. He gets it to insane levels.
---
There’s a BoS update coming sometime in the future. The BoS should be appearing in Appalachia, and I would bet that they’ll bring some new camp objects along with them.
---
(fasnacht music remixed with jar-jar quotes)...
---
... the horror...
---
that's another thing... wasn't he supposed to be glued to his desk...?
---
Assaultrons are the worst. I hate them more than any other enemy, Colossus included.
---
Is there a similar trick with Assaultrons?
---
If you dont know how to make a custom ini file, you can get one from nexus
---
Well then they have to run into the fire to rez you 😆
---
In about 2 minutes.
---
Edit- also it's unclear what causes it to bug and autocompete but it's a rampant problem and generally speaking the best thing to do is be logged off when it rolls over.
---
Having said that, people are reporting it happening if they haven't logged in for hours so who knows. Mine has never had an issue and all I do is log off if I'm on half hour before the reset, and 5 minutes after.
---
Ha ha Bloodied fixer go brr
---
Bethesda really skimped on the companion dialogue, that's for sure. I like Sofia but hearing her same 3 idle lines (nightmare/stranger etc) literally hundreds of times a day has me on the verge of scrapping her stupid scanner.
---
Yeah but sometimes i'm out of either mutfruit or tato and don't have time to go get it before the queen dies ahaha.
---
2 minutes until reset
---
They are going to buff it to 100,000 when they fix it.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more
---
In terms of weapon prefixes, Junkies vs Bloodied is close-ish.  
---
In terms of overall build the +15 to stats except endurance, and the adrenal reaction mutation, plus nerd rage means that bloodied builds are so far ahead of anything else you can put together it's not even funny.
---
Awesome info. Thanks!
---
It literally says above the challenges when they reset.
---
Thats all? Sometimes I found those on the ground and I never dare to pick it up...
---
I wish they’d just throw in all songs from all games. Give us the full catalogue.
---
Or maybe there could be different box types like raider = weapons, responders = aid, settlers = junk, enclave = armor, ect.
---
Ah ok, so for future reference its always Noon BST (Bethesda Local Time - EST)..?
---
Ditto here on a PC. I'm not a NW hunter, I prefer to play hide from the zombies, but there is a wildly different startup experience between players. I'm hardwired on a fast PC with a very solid ISP but I almost always find myself last to connect when others select starting spots close by. Like your experience I've spawned right next to stash boxes that have already been emptied by the time I go live. Naturally I'm downed shortly thereafter because I don't even have time to run and hide.
---
Helps a ton when scrip’ing stuff. Helps if you want to prevent from accidentally scrapping non-legendary gear as well
---
pick it up!
---
You can get the plan for free after completing [Miner Miracles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles). You can also purchase it from the vendor bot in Watoga Shopping Plaza, the Brotherhood of Steel vendor in the Whitesprings shopping center, or the MODUS production terminal in the Enclave bunker.
---
I use the Floater Freezer ones as backup cryo nades. They can apply the cryo freeze effect just like cryolator/cryogenic grenades albeit with a longer timer.
---
If it happens again, there is a door that opens via a terminal, its a shortcut between the storage section (which you will find in the first corridor you enter after creating the biometric ID and going through the laser grids) and the section where you replace the mainframe cores. Depending on where the invisible wall appeared for you, this shortcut may have allowed you to avoid it.
---
On melee not only you can stack them ,but you can even stack the same bonuses. Only melee tho.
---
I am shocked that people are still shocked. This is like the 6th massive dupe wave that i remember of since the first day of this game.
---
   IMO, they fixed a part of that when they introduced the best items in the game that can be achieved by everyone only by playing 40 minutes a day.
---
I will next time I found one again. Thank you
---
I dunno, that's why I gave a countdown not a time, as it differs all over the world. For me it's 5pm but yes, as of right now whatever time it is where you are is the time it resets.
---
That’s a nasty bug. Good looking out.
---
barely, and that helps them die a bit to return the favour more quickly :)
---
Iyeah I would do anything else other than the missions for awhile. Level up, explore, do events, tackle the quests later. 
---
Look up a few builds and go for one in particular, you may have to level up a lot to get the build right and fix your points.
---
lol 6th?
---
60th?
---
600th?
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That's a good idea! So, what's the point of the insult notes that bot gives you?
---
I know, they could make Junkies and Mutants closer to that, or nerf bloodied/unyielding down to comparable levels. But we all know which option would be most popular and which least... :-)
---
Oh man. Thank you for that. #rtfm
---
Sounds like an way to dupe items ngl
---
Only thing I know is to cripple their legs. Also done with concentrated fire, but a bit more difficult. But once you do, they crawl on the ground and it makes it easy to kill them from behind and avoid the laser.
---
I don’t think they have a fusion core, and I don’t really notice a difference when targeting their combat inhibitor. But I may have missed something.
---
Yeah thanks, never had issues until y-day...6/9 auto completed
---
PS Screw Todd
---
For now you could totally set up like a cafe/bed and breakfast business the BoS have occupied, like a field outpost
---
Build up the cafe and stuff so it looks really nice, then fortify it with defenses and turrets, set up the workstations in the fortified yard so it looks like the brotherhood slapped the workshop area together as they were fortifying, that kind of stuff
---
Unfortunately we don't have many BoS themed items yet, but just go with military style, maybe put up a "This Area Has Been Occupied By The Brotherhood" or "Now Entering Brotherhood Territory" sign, shorter might be better though
---
Taming still works. I found a map on YT showing all the pet spawn locations. Choosing the one closest to your camp will increase the chance that your new pet makes it home. 
---
It won’t always be a single creature that spawns, so server hop till you get one.
---
(Opening music from Wayne Gretsky Hockey)
---
I think its poison, aka, the "make sure armor doesn't help" catch all damage type. Same as gangrenous ghouls.
---
Colonel gutsy would like to know your location...
---

---
Google gaming clans and just join and be social , the key point is being social if your not then you not going to meet anybody or find a meaningful group of gamer. 
---
I’m mostly play mmorpg so I’m used to being social and helping other out.  
---
On ps4 there are communities tab on the PlayStation where you can  search for a fo76 community/clan
---
Thx
---
That would be a cool concept but, that would require a lot of editing. A few songs would do in my opinion.
---
I'm only level 26 and my guns feel underpowered. Should I try to get caps &amp; find plans for better guns or just play the game and I'll find better gear as I level?
---
*nu chowlenge cri morr*
---
same here!
---
Lmaoo I don’t know if this a joke post or not but either way that is/was one of the most sought after guns in the game. Before the dupe people would be giving up their first born child to get one.
---
Edit: just looked at your profile so this is definitely a troll post but I thought it was funny!
---
There are less than yesterday, but should still be 7.
---
I meant all of the Fallout games, but we can include the WG Hockey theme just for you dude.
---
HAd the same exact issue yesterday.
---
I had just gotten a 2 shot legendary combat shotgun and had just unlocked rank 2 of  bloody mess, and first event that started was UF.
---
After exploding the first three miners I hit with one shot, I quickly switched to a backup gun that dealt less damage.
---
I guess I might not instantly kill him on sight?
---
You must be new.
---
It SHOULD, but it does not.
---
Brick style bottom, like the Fallout 4 CC Slocums Joe build set, then the somewhat retrofitted metal walls on top with some spartan decorations, guard posts around. I think the location is probably gonna be the deciding factor though, think "Where would there be a Slocums Joe".
---
Gotta have friends :(
---
But yeah, I only got that one done because I landed in a group coordinating over party chat to take turns jumping off the Grafton dam.
---
no
---
It just increases the chance to get a three star
---
It is normal.  The star of the enemy is the max star item it can drop.
---
Is almost like Bethesda “wanted” everyone to have these items... 🤔🤔🤔
---
I'm not at that part yet.  
---
I'm not at the point where I choose which one to finish Wastelanders with.  
---
I was with my first char but he was so messed up and the final quest in the Vault was glitched for that one.  
---
I'm not swimming in caps so if you're on PC and want to get rid of stuff I can take some.
---
Cosmetic. Likely prevents airborne disease but that's it.
---
Even the hardest two challenges; level up overseer rank and survive 30 mins are easy. The former I make a new character and the later afk play while I make dinner or clean my house. I have yet to find any of the NW challenges hard enough not to do.
---
And nobody believed me. Hah!
---
they may pop-up later, who knows :$
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but in true Bugthesda fashion the R91 will be a [skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpZhMjCVQcw) for the Handmade.
---
At the very least the weapon has functional ironsights and less obvious clipping issues than the Screaming Eagle [skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKFfxNjp9wA). But it still looks kinda strange with the charging handle in the middle of the receiver.
---
its all ridiculous.. whats the difference?
---
Did you not hire
---
structural engineers to assist you on properly laying a foundation?
---
R91 Is already in the files but listed as a handmade skin and they will probably release that way no matter how much we wish they would add it as a new weapon :/
---
So long as the Rifle is actually a standalone chambered in 5mm, I'm all for it.
---
Same here. Lost track of time this AM. Six weeklies auto completed. Oh dear. That’s 6,000 points gone to never-never land. Six THOUSAND.  That’s three days of dailies to even make up (assuming six dailies, don’t do NW).
---
I wish to builder on radiation rumble and forgot to switch back to events :( 
---
I ain’t notice til my friend complain about the mad dog event only rewarding 700exp instead of the 1700
---
Higher stars just means you can get higher star weapons, but it's not guaranteed, much to the community's chagrin.
---
sweet
---
I could use one as well, what do you want for it?
---
I logged in at 17:03 BST , i saw i have 4 dalies, i re-logged, once back in, 3 of my quests were completed for some reason. 
---
Good shit.
---
Anyone on this sub wanna do some quests on Xbox?
---
Looks awesome and has a flashlight.
---
I can't seem to even get them to work. I wanted it to open with the keypad but when I put power on it, it stays open.
---
That's a pretty good idea.
---
There's plenty of queen nukes going on the regular, and if there's none in your server start one yourself, if there's not enough people to beat the queen nuke a zone and grab the flora.
---
Same deal with the fluid &amp; mass, get it yourself.
---
And it wouldn't be 1 flux per hour, it would be 1 flux per hour per player, flux is one of the very few junk items that people still buy on the regular, the more types of items that are viable for sale in player to player trading, the better, if everyone can auto generate flux hourly then it'll eliminate it from trading over time.
---
Status
---
The NW weekly auto-completed for me and I religiously make sure not to be online during reset.  It's definitely borked for some people.
---
All the fo76 youtuber are trash lol they stretch 1-2min worth of information for 10-15min and keep repeating themself  
---
Got information best place is here
---
Edit: I suggest you use [falloutbuilds](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/) to plan your character for the first 50 lvls
---
Serum recipes are a tough sell to begin with, because most people just want one serum. I'm also seeing recipes sold for an anywhere between 2,500 and 7,500 caps. Your price point is high in comparison. Also, I haven't been seeing a great demand for Healing Factor.
---
My 45k scrip with 0 items worth keeping says no
---
I sort of never played too heavily but bought my copy at launch full-price and returned for wastelanders with a new char (Old char hit mid-20s), and I've never encountered a 3-star before. Thank you for clarifying. :)
---
we were concerned about synths
---
Yes, it is much easier. Gg on those roles btw.
---
And I know! As soon as you set your mind on a roll you get the exact other. I got my Uny and Bol sets complete but vanguard is still missing an arm.
---
Copy that. Thank ye!
---
Interesting I haven’t had any daily’s or weekly’s reset and I never get on before the reset and wait 30 min after. I was thinking because people were on like 30 min before reset they were getting the bug but I guess not. I really am curious to know what exactly causes it but for now it has worked out for me.
---
Aaaand they're gone. Back to having to do it!
---
9 in perception and about 5 in agility is enough to run max rifleman, covert ops, sneak and escape artist. That’s basically the baseline sneaky sniper.
---
What are they? (I'm at work)
---
i'm not on pc, but if the Encryptid event pops up, go there and you'll most likely get a chance to revive someone
---
Also, Bethesda don't HAVE to give us dailies that can only be done in one mode.  They could have made the dailies look like:
---
* Level up 1 time, or gain 1 overseer level in NW
---
* Kill 20 super mutants, or kill 5 players in NW
---
Etc.  Surely that would keep everyone happy?
---
Totally this.
---
For the SCORE, it doesn't matter how high lvl the legendaries are so going and taking 5 minutes to kill 3 wolves is nothing. The rewards are shit, but when you're done that 3 legendary kills task is done and you can move n to other things.
---
I put plans in my vendor for cheap, every Sunday I pull all the common plans that didn’t sell and dump them at a train station and replace them with the plans I found during the week. It is a bit of extra work but I found if I’ve only got 20-30 plans in my vendor I get more shoppers come to check out my stuff. Lots of folks on here have said they usually skip camps that have a massive amount of plans up for sale.
---
they duped the dupers
---
There may well be! I never actually tested them out in my runs because I basically never use thrown weapons of any kind.
---
Good idea!
---
As someone else mentioned earlier, make sure your weapons and armor are level appropriate. If you're level 45+ your weapons and armor should be at least that high.
---
When in those combat situations, sneak, sneak and sneak some more and keep moving, don't let yourself get pinned down in one location for too long.
---
And yeah, you're going to die...a lot! My main was level 200 something when I did the RaRa quest and I was slaughtered more times than I will ever admit. Battling robots is the bane of my in game existence.
---
Look at your perk cards. Don't go into battle sporting a bunch of perks that are useless in your situation (crafting perks I'm looking at you). Going Solo? Level the Lone Wanderer perk to max and perk into any perks that increase the damage dealt and reduces the damage taken.
---
What kind of weapon do you prefer? Rifle? Shotgun? Heavy Gun? Pistols? There are perks for all of them, equip all you have for your favored weapons.
---
And most of all, don't give up. I get that it's incredibly frustrating trying to complete these quests, been there, rage quit more than once, but don't give up. When you finally take them down your sense of satisfaction will be immeasurable.
---
What I dislike is sometimes I can't see the pip-boy screen, started happening since the lighting update. i have to turn my character around, away from the light that's hittin it, to be able to read the screen.
---
i second that... so much!
---
On one character I got the Herbivore mutation at random and was bummed I couldn't eat meat anymore. But I found it hilarious dog food didnt count as meat. And I could still eat the dead with cannibal.
---
Yeah it's an odd one. There's obviously something but I have no idea what iti s. From what people have said (and I can't see why so many would need to make it up) it's totally random for some people, and I've done pretty much everything that *seems* to cause it for people and I've been fine.
---
I don't tempt fate anymore and make sure I'm off before the reset, but otherwise I dunno.
---
Who would stop playing Fallout over a better QOL improvement? So delusional.
---
sweet sweet honey bees
---
Mind telling a returning player where I should spend those 40 minutes every day?
---
Lost track of time. Lost 6000-6500 points (six weeklies auto completed). :(
---
I use the ice ones all the time on big boss mobs but dropping them seems such a waste lol
---
If it ain’t lock , go for it lol same shit with water
---
I have seven.

For me Chameleon Armor is the way to go, but I am a sneaky sniper...I live in crouched. Others use the Mutation with Weightless Armor because you can stand while it's in effect, meaning you get the benefit of the Sentinel effect as well as being invisible. Sentinel doesn't kick in while crouching.
---
Stingy ass Beth.
---
It used to be the strongest but then they decided to introduce scout and SS so it's bottom rung now.
---
That is indeed shit and I feel for you dude.
---
The only advice I can give is that the general online consensus seems to be log out 15 minutes before the daily reset and then 15-30 mins after (I'm trying 30 to be sure). Also been advised when logging back in to go into a new adventure session, not NW or private server.
---
Can't confirm any of the above and it won't help you today be hopefully it could prove useful to you in the coming days 🤞
---
Better take the L and the buff than nothing right?
---
I suggested that the ammo vending machines accept ammo points instead of caps.
---
Definitely a possibility. Especially if they're just playing along and not really minding that they're leveling or needing to upgrade.
---
Hell, I was rocking a like a level 5 shotgun well into my 20s when I started, simply because the upgrades and ease of finding rounds didn't make me think twice about it.
---
Like many in this thread suggested, the bane of all robots is limb damage. Get perk to target limbs, and use v.a.t.s. to shoot arms off Gutsys and bots, legs of assaultrons. 
---
If you lack damage, you can look for shotgun or minigun/smg *magic* effects, where game turns much easier - at least for regular daily grind.
---
I've never heard any *good* reason why you can't simply sell them to regular vendors for regular currency.
---
https://pingserverstatus.com/fallout76.php
---
Try this. Mine is between 50-200 and works OK on PS4.
---
Yeah, I see this 7 too.
---
Market makers on Reddit can't gouge people. What's gonna happen!?!?
---
Same but fixer was 6k was pissed for that , found someone selling the backpack mods then poof I ft to camps that poof way to much
---
Will do thanks!
---
Same here.  Im a FO junky and never played battle royale, but im drawn to it for the challenge.  I hated lots of quests in adventure until i took some time to figure them out (looking at you Encryptid).  NW feels like a similar challenge in that i am getting better at it through repetition and tweaking my build/approach.  Once you find a squad to run with and start communicating, it can be really fun.
---
Thanks for the Info never knew!
---
Bethesda said at one point that whatever you didn’t earn would probably be put into the atomic shop in the future (hopefully with the AC being free)
---
I’m upvoting every post on this today because I lost 6k in weeklies due to auto complete. 5,997 upvotes to go.
---
Other than an amusing little encounter, there's no point to them at all at least as far as I can figure out. 
---
If I'm not mistaken there's a location out there (I'm thinking VTU) where you can find a terminal entry from the person or persons who created the Insult Bot. I have this rather vague recollection of it being a class project or something.
---
As a matter of fact I did!! Hmmm I’m going to double check that.
---
Every damn time.
---
Same shotty!
---
Same
---
Nuke me mothdaddy
---
It's not silly, it's the proper term for an alternative currency.  It's just not one you hear in day to day use.
---
They haven’t even fucking addressed it. Beyond embarrassing.
---
Thanks for the advice! I usually play NW for a bit before the dailies reset, might be why. Its just stupid that you cant play during the reset because of their incompetence.
---
True, I hate thatt. That’s why I have the other option for viewing the Pipboy always on now.
---
Play the game with friends and explore at your own pace
---
Hell yh, even the exchange quantities are being increased
---
Is scout stronger as in more DR and ER (I mean then the original in FO4 since even BOS heavy combat is better than fully kitted FO76 marine) it does it just have better/more bonuses/perks if it is that would blow my theory out of the water since you get the marine ghille after you get scout. It goes Scout ghille, Marine then SS.
---
Yes. it is fine at that ping.
---
Yea at this point I was thinking it was luck as well because there are just so many different reports of people were on 10 min before or 30 or they logged in 5 min after reset and they got the bug. Yea at this point I’m level 37 in the legendary run and I’m starting to see that having to get 2000 score per level will definitely be a grind once I finish daily’s/weekly’s. I can get 10,000 pretty quickly but I’m saving those lunchboxes for double xp weekend. I actually have a little theory that so many people are going to be saving and using their lunchboxes for this weekend that I’ll barely have to actually use any. Of course unless someone pops more than 4 then I’m beat.
---
I can play it and enjoy it for what it is, and it's a lot of fun in VR, but it doesn't stack up to anything else in the franchise. Everytime I go back to the originals I have more distaste for it.
---
Np!
---
Sadly I’m on Xbox. Thanks for the info though!
---
More impotantly, being able to tag items you want to bulk scrap or sell. That would be so cool. Other games call it "tag as junk" or something like that
---
I like it a tiny amount. At rank 8 I've only managed to kill 1 other player. Clearly that aspect isn't my jam. But the "hide and seek" gameplay style is kinda fun.
---
I think they've backed themselves into a corner really, unyielding is too good, and I can't think of a way to nerf it that's not basically just "remove it", which then raises the question about all the existing uny items. What do you replace them with?
---
Totally misread that.  My bad.  That is what I get for trying to multitask.
---
Chew bubblegum, complete event, hack terminal,kill feral ghouls, level up. The nw one is deploy camp once and then the complete 5
---
15% less damage while blocking armor legendary is needed to make any shotgun do insane damage in vats.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣 76 lore!!
---
I can't understand how people can sell those notes even at 2K caps on their camps 😅
---
Ah, the cycle of economics
---
(100 lbs of dirty water)...
---
damn synths
---
Today is place your CAMP.  Once.  That's it.  Even if you don't like NW, this one is gg ez.  The ones that are problematic are revives and creature kills...at least for me.  That said, I'm starting to like the game mode the more I play it and i've almost got the Skeleton suit.
---
Agreed. I give the entire challenges an hour space (30 prior 30 ahead) haven't had a single issue.
---
Agreed. Personally I only do NW for the rewards and I've been doing it a lot lately for the Halloween and Xmas stuff that I missed (thanks Beth!) however it really bugs me that the xp you earn in NW doesn't count towards the repeatable weekly earn 10k xp.
---
Before anyone pipes up about there being separate NW and Adventure challenges, earning enough xp in NW to level your character up in Adventure DOES work towards the level up challenge, so it's stupid that they both don't.
---
All of my dailies are completed too.
---
I usually drop my extra scrip to my alts. 750 daily scrip is honestly more than enough. I play for hours every day and most days I don’t scrip out on all of my toons.
---
Edit: or just sell it honestly. I’ve been having a field day selling scrip during the mmurgh discount event. 20 caps to 1 scrip yields me the best results, but I sometimes push that to 25:1
---
I've been creating a Building Team with +INT for this reason. I've got shit to do, and sometimes, I have to miss some events. If I'm not in the middle of something, I'll go do whatever event is up.
---
Conversely, I would be on an event team and nobody would do Heart of the Swamp or Line in the Sand (XP Farms) but they'd line up for the  Campfire Tales or Tea Time, especially if they saw me there. I Soloed Heart of the Swamp several times.
---
Isn’t it one of the science perk that slow the breakdown rate? 
---
Also are you repairing it to 200% ?
---
I also lost my weekly challenges
---
I'm getting the same error, and I've only got one drive, so FO76 is installed on the OS drive.
---
It was gone before that.  Last month was the ugly camo paint for the wood and scout armor.  The Desert Ranger was the month before that.
---
I believe someone posted am auto ticket response in which they did acknowledge the bug. Can't find it for the life of me now though.
---
I just rename all junk legendaries as "Sell" Not only does it keep them together but it let's me know quickly which ones I wanna scrap or think isn't worth caps to try to sell.
---
This is my solution
---
Dropoff in business yes, but it was good yesterday and I maxed caps a few times. I notice that all the stuff I normally move easily is becoming much more common and sells less. Specifically rare and very rare plans and rare and very rare outfits are very hard to sell. I also notice that due to the purveyor sale everyone has a shitload of legendaries and nearly every vendor I checked had some bloodied/junkies variants that were worthwhile for use/reselling but I was only able to buy so many. 
---
Ammo is also dead because of ammo maker/converter. 
---
Everyones got a hard on for flux again which makes getting nuke cards impossible in bulk, and plasma cores jumped back up due to the duping. 
---
So basically they are pumping the economy full of supply, and demand is just crashing lower and lower because nobody really needs anything they cant get cheaply which reduces the amount of caps floating around. Things are going to crash super hard at this rate and it wont take very long especially if we have to go 3 weeks before this dupe gets patched.
---
New players dont have the caps or the understanding to want/need good legendaries or flux at least for a couple of weeks imo.
---
On a side note we need some specific camp privacy settings cause being in a public team vendor powered or not shows your camp icon and I lost a few dozen thousand caps because of enterprising fools who buy from powered down vendors.
---
The first three points can be easily avoided by limiting the plans you can get from doing what OP suggests, adding new plans expressly for it, or simply giving other items or currency in exchange for plans.
---
And point 4, to be honest, is a non-argument, judging by some of the utter crap vendors are already perfectly happy to buy and have up for sale.
---
For me Fallout 4 looks way better in rainy weather. The streets and objects actually look WET. The only thing I don’t like about Fallout 4 lighting wise is that the NPC’s glow in the dark with that ugly white outline.
---
I use raider scum, cause i can get free 3 star legendaries...
---
I've had that happen a couple of times. It's always stupid when it does happen and I usually laugh because it's an added level of absurdity to this game.
---
I try to pay attention when I see people at my camp and try to wait til they are done. Sometimes, it can't be helped.
---
 https://imgur.com/BrB6omF
---
thanks... i hope this never happens again... but it might be good to know,  It might have helped.   I was so frustrated at that point it probably wouldn't have mattered.
---
Thanks! Sucks that I missed it but glad it wasn't my fault
---
Hope this works out for you
---
Oh I get it, you sell flux. Now I understand your angle. If it is so easy to get flux from Queen fights, why are they buying it from you?
---
Let's say I go to a queen fight and I'm going to pop off about five hundred to a  thousand rounds of 45 ultracite. How many fluxes do you think that will take to craft, and how many Queen fights do you think it would take to collect that many of that particular type of flux?
---
Eagerly awaiting your reply.
---
Yeah, I kinda hate this. My highest level character is 36, but I never play it anymore because I really screwed up my SPECIAL and perk cards so I started over and I'm level 13, and sometimes I'll pop into events for exp and gear farming by "tagging" mole miners and then hiding, and people one-shotting the legendaries makes me become a giant floating sad face emoji.
---
Ok i'l move it down to 5k. Is the bear arm plan too expensive?
---
Do events. Collect loots. Sell loots.
---
that youtube guy, juicehead, claimed in a video today that there were ban waves taking place due to the duping. personally I havent seen people crying on the subs about it but I havent looked that hard either.
---
Thanks for my first Gold you kind stranger!
---
Yeah I tried that but I get garbarge guns and items from events, how much could I get for some lvl 15-45 weapons?
---
I mean in a public statement. They even released one recently and it wasn’t even mentioned.
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with  whatever chems and excess junk I have on hand sine the day before to make daily caps with vendors..
---
one time i, a level 130, was using a stash box at the rusty pick, pulling out the legendaries i planned to scrip, and some level 12 guy, through a herculean leap in logic that we mere mortals cannot possibly understand, decided to shoot me.
---
i left the box, turned to look at him, and he put his gun away. now multiple people can use stash boxes at once but i thought he might not know that so i step aside. he didnt go to the box, so i figure, hey, it was one shot, must be an accident. no harm done, i go back to the box.
---
he shoots me again. i leave the box again and he puts his gun away again and turns around. like, he thinks its funny and that i wont do anything. i think "okay, so we're doing this". i turn off pacifist mode, and quickly go into and out of the box. he shoots me again, and i immediately turn around and beat him to death with my anti-armor faster swing speed mole miner gauntlet. i leave his junk bag alone, grab my legendaries, scrip them, and buy some legendary modules, then leave. as far as i know he didnt even go get his loot bag.
---
i dont partake in pvp normally but some people need to be taught a lesson.
---
One of the ways that I make the cap limit is to do the riding shotgun event. When it’s done, go back through and loot EVERYTHING (guns, scrap, armor, ammo). Then pop on hard bargain and/or chems that boost sale prices or CHA head out to whomever you escorted through and sell everything. I usually only have to do this once on my main who’s CHA is only 5.
---
Someone here correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there a limit on the number of custom names for items you can have? Like 25 or something? Or did I just imagine this?
---
I also like extreme hide and seek.
---
I dont run around killing and picking up loot so if you see me I only have my fists or maybe a melee weapon.  So if you come upon a bush and a mad ghillie suited guy runs at you that's probably me.  All my perk cards are melee based so if I get lucky enough to get close it will hurt.
---
Thanks ill try it
---
whatever you are doing with your stores and stuff is booting me from construction mode
---
I feel like with those events either nobody comes or everybody comes late
---
Thanks ill try it!
---

---
Can someone tell me at which time not to log in so I don’t get this bug
---
You should stop by my "Wasteland Gifts" shop... anything and everything I could put down on a floor or wall.  It IS on a firm foundation though.
---
Assaultrons are kinda OP (and mirelurk kings, hate em too). I'm lvl 120 with decent weapons (no bloodied or junkie thou) and I still don't like to stumble upon assaultrons, even when they are like level 42 or so.  
---
My few advices:
---
* Try to get marsupial mutation, then you'll have access to many vantage points and safe places.
---
* If you are dying too fast then try PA, one of it's features is that stimpacks can be consumed without animation even when you are shooting and you can stack them to withstand quite a bit of incoming damage.
---
* As mentioned several times already, exploit weak spots - sentry bots - power cores at back, any mr handy - thruster, protectrons - waist (I think? got many yellow dmg numbers on that area), assaultrons - crippling leg works the best, but you still need to watch out for head lazor.
---
* Use dmg perks for your favourite gun.
---
How the hell did you run out of 24,000 caps at level 42?
---
I'm literally doing all event that pops up on the map. I'm trying to get the rare out fits have been for weeks even doing the low level of one's , if there are low levels there I show them how to do event but let them use the Terminal etc to start or finish event. But I'm same even tired radiation rumble by my self cause no one else will do it and I've giving up on trying to get the rare stuff from project paradise going have to try buy it.
---
I don't know what you're selling it for, unless you were saying you're selling both it and the serum recipe for 10,000. You have to consider that people are using legendary weapons. Basic crafted weapons aren't exactly valuable. I'd recommend listing it at 250.
---
The wanderer was the last one I found.  By that time, I was already tired of hearing her just from visiting other player vendors.  I had her in my camp about 5 minutes before I couldn't stand it anymore.  Then I fought with her for about 2-3 more minutes because she wouldn't stop playing long enough for me to remove her chair.  
---
I stick with the space girl now.  At least with her, Athena comes around every now and again.
---
&gt;Don't help? Don't deserve the reward
---
I wonder how many of the people saying this *now* were on board with afk leeching during fasnacht. Hmmm...
---
The legendary effect only increases ballistic damage. The radiation stays the same.
---
How do you level up the legendary run you ask? $$$$
---
I'd had them from lvl 10, ammo really is the reason I ran out
---
Fantastic, thank you. Glad I've been hoarding Bubblegum.
---
It’s made by Bethesda Austin, a newer company that they bought and considering this is one of their second games (first got scrapped), I’m not surprised.
---
That's crazy, heart of the swamp is my favorite event. Fast XP farm and pretty fun.
---
I've started using builder as well. Then I'll flip it to event if I have someone join me for event etc.
---
At least has flashlight built-in so you don’t have the pipboy green glow.
---
I found a camp selling 248,000 large handmade presents for 0 caps. I was trying to be nice and not take more than I needed so I was only going to take 10k, but at this point in my playing of fo76 I didnt know that you could press the bumpers to move the slider faster. So i was there for 10 min sliding down to 10k and I got to 144k but they logged off before I could take anything at all. 
---
It still hurts.
---
Some of us don't like spending money. I'd rather get there by just playing
---
Par for the course unfortunately and this historically is how they behave in addition to not updating anyone. Try not to complain too much or you will disrupt the fantasy most of the people have here that everything is always dandy.
---
the thing is that when you log in after the daily quest reset the bug takes place and the entire daily quest list gets autocompleted, but I think that you can avoid this by loggin in before the reset time. At least is what I have just experienced today that is the first time that happened to me.
---
Today I have lost 1000 SCORE but I can recover them by doing the repeatable weekly quest 10 times.
---
Don't know if this may help, but this is a problem that needs attention from Bethesda.
---
Water purfier farm or run Uranium Fever and loot all to sell to a vendor.
---
Just craft them, they’re incredibly cheap scrap-wise. Energy ammo in the tinkerers workbench.
---
A little kindness goes a long way I guess except for when this guy went AFK in my camp. Decisions had to be made that day.
---
Honestly I agree, I’ve got so many plans but none are selling and I’m selling them for like 5% of the games price. I might just give em all away to new players at this point, the 2-5 cap profit I make isn’t worth it
---
So something that I've been kicking around in my head is about this subject. What I would like to see is this, you can scrap legendaries and have a chance at getting 1 of the modifications from it. I'm not sure what the chance should be, 1% is what I was thinking, maybe 2%. You can not affix them to non legendary weapons, they can only replace legendary affixes. This means, you could change out everything on a 3 star legendary.  I would say any affix is open unless it is tied to a specific weapon or armor type, like bow or crossbow can't be used other weapons. 
---
Could this lead to some definitely overpowered weapons yes, but it could also open up a new market for mods. 
---
I would also limit them to 1 major affix and 2 minor for at least 3 star, 1 major and 1 minor for 2 star, and 1 major for 1 star.
---
I would also say that this could work in an upgrade idea also, using +1 strength could be stacked based on player level. Every 50 levels, on the account, unlocking 1 more stack level. So this would work in the idea you get a mod that increases damage to an enemy type by 30%, every mod that does damage to that same enemy type, can be used to increase safe to them by 2% per extra mod used.
---
People aren’t reporting if they are on PC or console when this bug occurs, which makes it even more difficult to sort through whether it’s localized, a server issue, a visual bug (which is what I encountered), or something else.
---
Lmfaoooo
---
Where do you get September 15th from? Multiple times (including the quote from patch 20 that I included above) they say it is 10 weeks long.
---
I don’t deny that June 30-September 15 is 11 weeks (it is). I don’t see anywhere that says that the season runs through September 15 lol. Inside the vault says it is 10 weeks. The only thing I can think is that you read “mid-September” and assumed it literally meant September 15. 
---
If you have a source from Bethesda that says it is through sept 15 I would love to see that. Unfortunately I think you are mistaken though as again from the ITV.... 
---
&gt;	for free over the next 10 weeks.
---
Did you quit the game while you were in Nuclear winter? And/or did you quit and or join in 15 minutes before the challenges released and after? Those have been the two things I have heard other players say to avoid to prevent it from happening.
---
Excavator PA and run Lucky Hole Mine daily, will have more lead than you know what to do with.
---
Lemme check
---
Yea, I don't necessarily want filth, just damaged and used. Blankets on beds with wear patches and such. Shelves with scratches and chipped paint. Flooring with scuff marks and a bit of water damage.    
---
    
---
If I had my way all the items would have "used, clean" and "dragged out of a ditch" variations heh.
---
Fort defiance is pretty cake too.
---
I always travel back to my camp before logging off for the session.
---
I consider myself a bloodied casual. Lol
---
The trick to bloodied isnt about HP, its about damage evasion, which works pretty well. You do have a few weaknesses though, mainly being damage over time like burning and poison, as well as rads. Or that one lucky strike that you get hit by from time to time. Assaultrons and mirelurk kings are my biggest problems, about everything else I can tank.
---
If you play on xb1 and are interested I might be able to help you out with bloodied.
---
I spaced out and played through the reset.  Didn't realize it until suddenly my S.C.O.R.E went up (and I knew I wasn't near the repeatable). Panicked and checked, miraculously none of them auto-completed
---
Molotovs are great for tagging groups of enemies in one swoop, since it explodes on impact - the damage sucks, but I see it more of a tool than a weapon at this point.
---
Grenadier and Demo expert are definitely a must for explosives. Launchers have bern kinda butchered with the TSE berf back in the day.
---
Mini nukes and missiles are great for killing mobs, but scorchbeasts, the queen, etc. are not worth fighting with them. Also, launchers break incredibly fast - especially two shot ones (they do 200% dmg tho).
---
Go to Blackwater Mine, kill all the mole miners inside and outside, sell all the weapons and glowing meat. Easy way to get the 1400 daily caps as well as some junk and ammo.
---
At level 42 the cap grind is pretty difficult tbh. I’d level until you’re able to solo west tek and then pick up caps off of the mutants. That being said, I honestly can’t imagine what you’d need the caps for. Focus on finishing the storylines and leveling until you’re around level 80/90, then start worrying about caps.
---
I play melee with controller on pc so I am completely out of my depth in NW so playing hide and seek has been my favorite method of playing. I'm also thinking about switching over to a briefcase sniffer build to mess with everyone by nuking the final circle.
---
I guess I wasn’t aware of how they respond to these kind of dupes because I left the game for a bit &amp; just came back to game for last 3 months.
---
I was logged in NW when it reset. Realised half hour after, doh.  
---
What I did.  Alt-F4 without looking at challenges.  Log back in.  Still have my dailies.
---
Thanks im gonna try that today
---
It's done the same thing to me too 😭 said I've done everything but no reward
---
Unless you have full weightless sentinal pieces, the chameleon mutation is useless.
---
I have a Super sledge with that trait, and +1 Strength :P
---
It is in the files however, same goes for all the other missing mods, Bethesda seems to be aware of all of it now.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gv6r7p/several_weapons_are_still_missing_some_mods_one/
---
oh sorry,I was just moving them.Is it fine now?
---
Damn. Those are some heavy hitting guns! And with your bloodied build... gotta be a killing machine.
---
Everything is honestly up to individual buyers. Like yah there are kind of guidelines to price but it honestly depends. Imo that is even moreso true with plans
---
IGN ShinyKittySurprise 
---
We play evenings and weekends US time.  At least one Queen nuke a day...more if time allows.  Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble, Project Paradice sometimes eat up the time for more Queen fights.
---
U gotta relog before 12pm est reset. To make it up u gotta farm 200k exp :p
---
Yup, fully understand people not wanting either spend time making things "realistic" or not having the talent to do it. The prefabs in FO4 helped when you wanted to slap a building down and go. Even if they were made using the same panels and floors of the basics, they would be a useful tool in FO76.
---
I really need ammo
---
I've literally tried every creature and animal in the game. Some that spawn randomly nearby my camp in southern savage divide. No matter what gun I point at them (without a scope) I can not get the square to pacify/tame. it just stays a cross hairs.
---
He is better, he helped me with everything I need to do, seriously I really appreciate it
---
The problem i get is that people just don't join them to begin with...
---
Most are duped so most not worth much
---
Oh, I'm well aware. I had to create a new character last year when they fucked up power armor causing the game to freeze frequently making it unplayable. They only left that bug in the game for around 6 months. Which is why they should stop pushing new content and put all of the people they have working on the game working on bugs. But no, let's keep making new content in a short amount of time with no play testing in house, let's get the consumers to do all the bug testing and save money!
---
Its been this way since day 1. If the community as a whole throws enough of a bitchfit (like with the ammo converter) we are lucky to get pr filtered garbage or vague promises in the form of a tweet. They have never once come out and said "hey we fucked up we are working on it".
---
I struggle with doing events or running scorched or mines bc i got no ammo
---
But how will I then get my coveted and precious arrows, syringes and mini nukes? 😌
---
I'm 3 ranks away from that. Now if only I could use it on ultracite haha
---
It reset 39 minutes before this comment at 12:00pm est
---
Most people recommend logging out at  least 15 minutes before and logging in at least 15 minutes after
---
As an owner of a legit legacy weapon I would be very unhappy if they removed or nerfed legacies. Dont punish me as a long-time veteran because you dont have your house in order. 
---
[Hacked weapons](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hq6nnm/for_those_curious_this_is_what_a_hacked_ingame/) on the other hand, have at it. Shouldnt be too difficult to remove things that are impossible to create normally.
---
Yes. They break at least twice as fast. Since each hit procs durability loss.
---
yessir. I kill myself more than mobs but the biggest benefit imo is the unyielding exp bonus u get. I would not go back strictly because of just that
---
i was not even logged in, just main menu because i just came from work, well i log in and 6/7 auto completed thanks to that.
---
He also said it's just as likely it's for the XP exploit that allows players to reach Rank 100 in the Legendary Run, which makes more sense.
---
I sometimes just leave stuff in a suitcase at the one of the train stations, but a lot of people don't check those. Stuff will persist there for longer after you leave. But I can drop a bag of stuff at my camp, there are no world containers in my camp. Plus, the bag just sitting there usually draws people to look out of curiosity. I get enough traffic to my vendors that the bag usually goes quick, even if its garbage.
---
Hopefully they will add another week or some other way to make up the score. Now I have to find things to do since I’m can’t do those lol
---
Free Range one especially. I've only herded once and everyone piled on the sheepsquatch and killed it before I even saw it because I was concentrating on the cows. Was mega annoying.
---
Tents at the sbq are fine, as long as they're not floating in mid air or standing on top of them so it doesn't land...
---
Vault tec agricultural center, top floor office
---
fuck bethesda
---
I blue screened and my challenges auto completed 😭😭😭
---
There's apparently 1300 plans in the game. And i reckon there's only about 50 of those which have any real value. 
---
old post but still fairly relevant

and these 2 are the rarest plans in the game

---
who dies to fall damage anymore? lol
---
I’ve found that all explosive weapons break faster then non-explosive versions
---
The easiest way to get ammo at a low level is to use a melee weapon in an area with a lot of low level scorched. Just run around the forest (and maybe the ash heap if you’re capable of effectively meleeing mole miners) picking up ammo and weapons off of scorched. Charleston is a good spot to do this. It’s a great way to learn mods as well. You shouldn’t need to be going through enough ammo to need to buy it, just craft what you don’t pick up off of scorched and grind scorched with a melee weapon for it.
---
Because it looks cool
---
I admit that was guilty of the huge house on one staircase thing, but I also went into the stairs (I think) menu and selected those metal support pole and snapped them to the floors down to and into the ground so while my house may have been floating, it looked like the floors were being supported by numerous metal poles.
---
Also, Walls can and do snap to the bottom of upper floors, so what I used to do is make a floating house, but I'd snap full sized walls to the floor and then a half wall of a different type(usually brick) to the bottom of that wall so from the outside, it looks as if it's a full house with a brick foundation.
---
Here's a video I made last year about how to enclose crops(this is before Wastelanders so before the farming tiles) [https://youtu.be/pRQfL9Ddm\_E](https://youtu.be/pRQfL9Ddm_E)

I agree 100 percent.

---
&gt;Welcome back to Inside the Vault! This week we’re celebrating the upcoming kickoff of our first Season, which starts when Update 20 arrives on June 30 ***and will run through mid-September.***
---
Level 501 bloody heavy weapons/demo build.
---
Unpopular opinion but power armor is still the best defense in the game in or out of a rad zone because of the 7% flat damage reduction per piece of power armor you are wearing.  Damage reduction that is not based off RNG or positioning.
---
Sentinel and cavalier still have a 25% failure rate and sentinel only works when standing up and standing still while cavalier only work when you are sprinting.  Yes, if the stars align and it works every single time legendary armor with sentinel or cavalier is better protection but that's not practical to bet on always being in the right position and being that lucky when taking damage.  And this gear can be very expensive to make a full set of.
---
You could get full sets of the bane armor, that would provide a better defense all of the time, but only against certain enemies.  Couldnt imagine carrying 6 armor sets and proactively swapping them every 10 minutes.  Would drive me bonkers but guess if you're that committed to not using power armor lol.
---
If you're bloody Emergency Protocols closes the gap almost immediately with legendary gear.  Sure unyielding is nice but unyielding doesn't keep you alive either.  Serendipity does but again, its rng.  If I could only tell you how many times serendipity has let me down =/
---
EP will keep you in the fight longer and moving around the fight faster.
---
And if you're a heavy weapons build and you aren't using power armor with stabalized you are only gimping yourself.  Makes a huge difference.  Not saying you cant get by with something more accurate like the plasma caster or the gatling gun for stomping some super muties but any of the weapons we really went heavy weapons to enjoy (50cal, lmg, minigun, energy gatlings) are 10x better with stabalized.
---
Yeah but my point still stands; most people doesn't use it
---
Thanks! I'll try it
---
I have my camp near a flatwoods monster spawn point and have killed him two or three times there.  I have also seen him spawn at least 5 additional times and then zip straight  underground as soon as I shot at him.
---
So that's pretty odd.
---
That’s what she said :D
---
People who don't melt the ovn boss so everyone gets loot
---
Remember that you need to hit the 10k XP repeatable 20 times to make up for it. Then do that during the upcoming double XP, and save any lunchboxes and XP/INT boosting chems for that weekend to really blow through it.
---
Penitentiary has ghouls as well.
---
You sell to the vendor. 1400 caps a day adds up. Sell scrap legendaries in your vendor. people usually do about 500-800 for a 3* weapon
---
well it all depends on the gun. You can sometimes get quite a bit for a level 35 handmade if the prefixes are good or a level 40 fixer.
---
Lol, if you stash that bad boy we’ll link up whenever it’s convenient for you. You need anything in particular like a type of ammo ext?
---
I had found when i stopped hoarding mountains of useless crap I didnt need and trying to get max top dollar for every mediocre legendary drop I got.. my stash issues disappeared as well..
---
“Mid September” does not mean September 15. Many days could be considered “mid September”.
---
I’m sorry.. but when they say it runs for the next 10 weeks... I think they mean 10 weeks. Not 11.
---

&gt; salesman  
---
Wait ... what is this salesman you speak of?  
---
Has my gold grind been -17.647% slower because I hadn't yet heard of this salesman?
---
Ok thanks
---
I'd price it lower to move, if someone is looking for it 5k isn't too bad. I paid for a Fixer plan (since I only seem to get the White Wolf Fedora from Encryptid) just to unlock legendary Fixer drops.
---
That's exactly what happened to me yesterday, I'm just hoping it doesn't happen again when I log on tonight
---
Nothing easier than being AFK for 30 minutes.
---
Yup, i will farm the repeatable. I'll just wait for 20 minutes before logging in from now on.
---
OMFG!!!!!   Please And Thank You.
---
When you want to log off but the guy is taking too long to make a purchase 😃
---
PSA: the extra 2 daily is gone now. Seems like it was only a weekend thing.
---
Good idea I was just thinking there was a double xp coming up also it you have the carnivore mutation then eat a boiled scorchbeast brain you can get up to +8 INT on a team
---
I honestly can't get too upset by that, it's a ludicrous situation for us to be in.
---
Weird, I used to put all my plans in for stock price because I was lazy, and I would still sell a few every day.  I've stopped being lazy and given things prices to sell and now I get 2-3 people a day who buy several plans each.  I do run Harpers, the Cemetary and Pleasant Valley to bag decent plans for sale though, it's not like I'm trying to flog a hundred Ivory Revolver Grips or something.
---
I was only able to craft 3 cause of lack of materials. Just started a week ago that’s why I lack many things
---
And the “YOURE the dumbass” notes
---
"Toasty" (noise from Mortal Kombat)
---
Where were you buying ammo?
---
I know. Thats the same reason Im a bloodied rn.
---
This duping is outta control, man.
---
hopefully the game will protect far fewer BOS from getting shot in the face to death than it does for settlers and raiders..
---
I hate them more already and they arent even in the game yet...
---
I'm just sad I almost unlocked the plushie and would have reached rank 42/43 by end of day now I'll be behind my friends lol
---
gunsmith/the luck of the draw  helps, but not completely.... Boom Boom (Broken noise)
---
^^After hearing that he used PayPal for the payment then I say this as well
---
Getting grenades at their feet takes out the legs pretty quick.
---
Whenever you hear/see them charging their head laser just drop everything and find something to hide behind. If you get them crawling on the ground they're pretty easy to take (as someone else pointed out) BUT they can still hit you with the head laser so be careful.
---
I findits really easy to keep yourself stabilize with rad away and the healing factor mutation. Full rad aways do about as much as a diluted, and having then on the hot wheel means you can use them on a dime
---
I make a nice income from my vendor. All serums. some decent plans (marine armor plans), asylum uniforms and reasonably price legendaries (IMO). I can just go afk for 20-30 mins and come back and find i've made 10K. Got a few people who check out my wares a couple of times a week.
---
Oh, if you just started a week ago I’d suggest against using heavy weapons. Are you at the right level to be using a Gatling plasma yet? I’m pretty sure the minimum level is 40.
---
This and also it won’t show up with an ! on the map either.
---
Go to stored and scrap the blueprint
---
I have them all up for sale (PC). I only started selling them recently so don't worry there's still people like me with everything sitting in a vendor.
---
Wade airport has a terminal where you climb up that big wing.
---
I dropped those two mutations the down side at our already low health wasn't worth the low amount of damage it did to mobs. And on occasion I could die from the rad explosion
---
Rads is really the only draw back to a heavy low hp/bloody build. Can't really get past that aside from lead backback and full ss with + rad resistance would be my guess
---
That's probably why, PayPal is extremely delayed and finicky when it comes to being the middle man for purchases. I once used PayPal to buy an item from BestBuy and it took 3 days before it actually went through and made my order. Same thing couldn't get a refund back until it actually went through at that point I just let it ship and accepted the wait
---
With the SS armor and a lead lined back pack I’ve been surviving a lot longer. I do keep a fair bit of radaway on me and I’m not afraid to pop one if I need one. I also use lifegiver which seems to boost my nerd rage threshold.
---
As for the mutations you mentioned I had both and seemed to do way more harm than good do I got rid of them.
---
When did you login? I understand there’s some kind of bug where if you login close to 12 PM EST the daily challenges will autocomplete but you will not receive the SCORE.
---
Dude, the game is tedious enough. Most people don't have time to dedicate loads of hours every day, so an actual qol change won't hurt. What a strange thing to be elitist about.
---
Place the object on top of a small rug. Then move the rug with the object on top under the stairs.
---
Other peoples camps for 1 cap per ammo
---
I totally disagree, I used to like the way the game looked, now it just looks washed out and in HDR on ps4 pro its so ridiculously dark I have had to turn the HDR off.
---
When I first got my ps4 pro I thought it made the game look much better instead of much worse.
---
All yours if we manage to meet up
---
I don't need anything honestly.  Not sure if you adding me worked fully, not seeing any new friends I don't think I already had.  What's your IGN so I can force it through?
---
It could just be the location of my camp, I’ve got it on the mountains near white spring, I was thinking of relocating to that dry lake near the capital building
---
Being AFK for 29 minutes. CHECKMATE!
---
yeah, no worries (:
---
Make sure you are using diluted radaways when running bloodied. That makes sure you aren’t close to death but still around that 20-30% HP to keep your damage high. The healing factor mutation works well with it when there’s no enemies around.
---
this is bull shit all completed automatic with no chance to get the reward !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
A bloodied shotgun won't come close to one shotting the alpha, right? Especially the Sheepsquatch
---
So does my nocturnal railway rifle, exterminator flamer, etc...
---
Melee is under strength to. I'd make a new character for rifles, but all your melee, heavy, and shotguns can go under your main still.
---
I use those notes to drop off at trap camps with some fertilizer. Or at camps that have locked their vendors inside yet didn't disconnect them from power so they still show on the map and waste people's caps to travel to. 😂
---
I did all of the above, and still had the issue yesterday. 
---
Supposedly accessing the Atom Shop Before logging into adventure can also cause it, but I didn't do that either. Honestly feels like RNG at this point...
---
I am glad we can get them as loot/drops so I could try them before buying the plans. Underwhelming for sure.
---
BWAHAHAHA. 👍
---
Dang you guys are a few ahead of me I’ve been making sure I do it everyday and I’m only 35. I think tomorrow or soon they are gonna make it so you can spend atoms on levels but you might only be-able to buy 10 so you probably want to save them for the last harder levels
---
Ugh, right about then.  I was waiting on them to update for a minute or two.
---
I had actually never heard of this one!  I didn't have a PC until around the time SQII and KQIV came out, and the only way I'd encountered text adventures was random print versions I happened upon, or rips posted to BBSes.  I kinda missed the narrow window for the text adventure craze.
---
But I like the fusion cores, the ammo converter doesnt give those. But yes to missiles and mini nukes
---
I'm sorta on the same page.  I didn't get rid of my Vend machines, but I have stopped really paying attention to them; simply because I'm sitting on the 30k limit no matter what I do every day. I simply don't have anything to spend caps on... so making caps doesnt' matter to me anymore.   and yes.. it's very freeing
---
What about those who enjoy the BOS and who didn't want to work for the Enclave at all? Do they not matter, or we just focusing on you here?
---
Thanks for sharing! Beautiful skin, but sad to see the hard work some dev put in not being made into a standalone gun. That's a gorgeous rifle and would have loved to have had this be more accurate to the real-world version.
---
I've killed roughly 5 Flatwoods Monsters, taken pictures of 3 of them, no credit for "take a picture of an alien". Bugged, I'm guessing.
---
This started happening to me this weekend. I've had the lost item in my inventory for over a month now, so being able to turn it in multiple times per day was a nice bonus.
---
This might be a dumb question but does extra intelligence give you more xp?
---
Turn on pacifist in settings.
---
I do understand that Bethesda are still very invested in Fallout76 and it won't be going anywhere at least until a new Fallout is announced. That could be upwards of 5 years away if they haven't started development. 
---
Honestly I do believe they will enhance it for next gen. Maybe a free upgrade or backwards compatible. I wouldn't imagine them re-releasing it completely. 
---
There is a good few years left in the game so it would be stupid in my opinion for it not to be moved to the next gen. 
---
Bethesda know that the game will die out completely if they didn't keep it relevant.
---
I just moved my camp there yesterday! Built a train station there. I just posted asking how to manipulate the spawn point there. How were you able to do it?
---
I absolutely agree, I've just been reasoning it in my head as:
---
The Brotherhood and Enclave are still new, while the Enclave is aware of the Brotherhood I don't know if they are at war yet. IDK if that is correct, but I'd like to see the beginning of the 200+ year war between the two
---
Honestly I wish they would take away the 150 daily script limit
---
Settings-game- turn pacifist on.
---
And sorry that sucks, you on xbox?
---
Even with a Luck of 42, out of a 10 roll from murgh I get 1 God rolled weapon I may or may not use. It's like 5x that for armor, maybe more. Duping isn't a terrible thing tbh.
---
Yep!
---
There's a weekly to do 3 NW events as well though...
---
I agree. Seeing as Bethesda isn't going to continue to use the Legendary system they have in place, they need to expand on it.
---
We should be able to scrap Legendary's for general scrap and Legendary Modules and we should be able to craft Legendary version's of gear we already know how to craft.
---
I would really like it if they gave use a choice to set how many Legendary Effects we get per crafted item, instead of having to waste thousands of Modules trying to get that one roll we want. Make it so players can craft 1 Star, 2 Star, and 3 Star Legendary gear but cost 2 Modules, 4 Modules, and 6 Modules respectively, but only if they gave us the ability to scrap Legendary gear with a guarantee of a Legendary Module per scraped Legendary.
---
You already have the upcoming BoS quests and seasonal components. I'm asking for the addition of an Enclave route to match that. For factions to work, both need a strong presence in the game. I want BoS and Enclave to be equally represented to polarize the hell out of both factions.
---
I’ve had mine completed without logging on anywhere near that time frame. This bug is caused by something else.
---
I cant imagine soloing a sbq yet, but i jump at every fight i see and its usually 8 to 15 people, never seen it less than that, i only miss one if ive ran myself out of ammo from doing 2 or 3 back to back
---
I'm on Xbox I'll keep looking 😁
---
That's what I'm thinking of doing now. Loads of bolstering, armor that was really good still in storage, but with SS armor nobody wants this stuff anymore. I leave a trail of 1-3 star legendary weapons and armor behind me like bread crumbs as I play purely cause I can't sell it, scrip it or store it.
---
I'll just sell quick moving items from now on. Rather my storage space weight near limit with full power cores that I can sell quickly than pieces of armor I've had for months.
---
I'll find a deserted pond on a private server and drop the whole lot on the bottom as a catharsis for all the time/caps spent on it
---
Umm 🤔 I been stuck on this quest for a while due to being lazy to collect the cards. So this is great news for mw
---
No dumb questions, but yeah it does I’m not sure by how much. I usually try to make or join a building team because you can get +4 INT
---
That is strange since the daily challenges reset about more than an hour before you logged in (going by time of the post).  I just logged in, and they are all there (6 normal and a NW one).  Last time I played was about 14 hours ago where I completed all daily challenges.  Edit: I am xbox too.
---
My wife corrected me on this this weekend. I was **sure** it was "script" - not sure where I got that from. I suspect I wasn't even aware of "scrip" as a word.
---
My suggestion, don’t go around punching people. I know that sounds harsh but I’ve never been griefed and I’ve been playing since launch. I really don’t pvp anymore too, unless it’s with friends. I think they’re a people in all games that enjoy destroying other people stuff, but it’s not nearly as bad as I’ve seen in other games.
---
bethesda had no shame
---
Same. I would add that if I'm trying to server hop or log off and I notice you at my base. I will not log off.... BUT if you're still there 5-10 minutes later... You better hope serendipity kicks in :)
---
I love this so much.
---
I'm 38 now but I've done a lot of sbq and events
---
You ‘gon learn today....
---
The stuff I sell doesn't really weigh anything, so I'm not entirely sure I'd feel the benefit as much as you do.
---
Mine is usually just plans, magazines, bobbleheads, bobby pins, and the odd bit of ammo (that I know 100% will sell). Maybe 20, 30lb max?
---
Same.
---
It has to be at one of the random tame spawn points and it has to be a single creature. Go on YT and search: Fallout 76 pet spawn map.
---
Thanks for the offer man, I am on PC though :) Will be following the map for sure.
---
What could I reasonably get my rr to? I’ve been using the chem backpack a lot since I’m usually collecting them by the dozens per a run and it doesn’t reduce the standard 60 carry weight. But if it could better solve my rad problem then perhaps one of my other str cards should be taking a backseat to traveling pharm again.
---
There is a video (probably several) recently showing the above trick
---
I killed a 3 star legendary possum near Freak Show once shortly after the game launched. I got a nocturnal board from it. It’s my favorite legendary ever.
---
Congrats on trolling.
---
Ok cool, who wanted to hear that?
---
I just dropped like 500 plans at a random camp.
---
I was going to ask why and then there is a thread below that says there is a bug if you log in around 12 EST and this happens...
---
+1 Endurance is bugged and doesn’t do anything
---
Sometimes I join a team just for the free fast travel to an area I need to be.
---
I made a lengthly thread about these issues back when they arrived with the so-called, lighting "update" that came with wastelanders, I believe they actually downgraded the graphics to make room for smoother servers and more camp budget.
---
BoS get the plasma hose, no exceptions 😡
---
We shouldn’t have to have mods to enjoy the game and get new things. I don’t want to have a bunch of mods on my console since they don’t even make good mods for consoles anyway.
---
That one I am shocked they did not add to be honest.
---
There’s a few rules of thumb to keep in the back of your mind wrt plans
---
- any weapon mod plan is most likely sought after 
---
- any shielded plan is most likely sought after, except for enclave (same w protective marine and raider) 
---
- healing salves are most likely sought after (especially mire and bog because they don’t drop from region events)
---
- plans that only drop from specific events are most likely sought after (proj paradise, free range, sbq, census violence, queen of the hunt, etc. )
---
- power armor piece plans are most likely sought after (esp. t60 because they didn’t drop from prezentz)
---
It’s around 2% per point in int so it soon builds up
---
solid idea - though you wouldn't want to use the rusted out weathered cans you find around town for this and I think you put too much effort, canning is simple, take glass jar, boil to sterilize it, stuff food in, seal, boil that to can/seal it, done.
---
Making a canning jar could easily be made via glass + rubber + steel at a tinkers workbench.  
---
And the actual canning at a stove/firepit.
---
I’ve been using diluted’s more, but for whatever reason I forgot I can dilute radaways myself until you mentioned this... it’s been such a pain carrying full radaways “just in case” 🤦🏻
---
I guess I was implying that I thought it was rather convenient for Bethesda that the score is bugging out for so many, forcing them to spend money if they want to complete the run. I wouldn't spend a single cent on it personally
---
&gt;I was like ahh fistacuffs sir? And hit him back.
---
full stop
---
I would run through areas with low level scorched or super mutants when you get low on ammo. It's easy to kill them and you can sell or scrap their weapons after.
---
They cannot destroy your base (typicaly) if you do not engage. There are some methods, but not for the most part. Just put yourself in pacifist and just know that most looking for a fight on a low level player, they probably are built to win it. But in almost 1100 hours played, it has been a rarity for me running into someone attempting to grief me.
---
Cool thanks, I'll look into it!
---
I want that drunkbot from the frat house basement more than any other bot. He cracks my ass up. No homo.
---
There have been several posts that stated to log out 40 minutes before the reset whic is 10:30 CST or 11:30 EST.  I have done that, and I have never had an auto-completion.
---
Sorry let me explain further what I meant. 
---
Adding things like glocks and desert eagles wouldn’t fit into this game in any way. 
---
So when players want something that is not meant to fit the design of the game intended. That’s where mods come in. 
---
I was simply replying that if someone want modern warfare guns in fallout they should install mods instead. 
---
No reason to wait for those to be added. They probably never will.
---
(Although the 1911 would kinda fit as we’ve seen other models like it in previous games)
---
Place the object first and then the stairs. If your stairs are already placed move them. Can be a pain but you can usually get everything under that way
---
The "Employees Only" doors in The Whitespring auto-close after a bit, too. Every time I see that I want that feature for my doors.
---
Generally you can set your nuclear winter favorites through the atomic shop. I recommend looking in the skin section to see if you can add them there.
---
Mutually exclusive storylines would be awesome. I had thought that’s how the raiders/foundation was going to go, but no, your choices there make no difference. 
---
You get to pick BOS or Enclave. Whatever you pick, you stick to it. Maybe a late-game option to switch, but whatever you decide on then, it’s for life. None of this “do them both” thing. And it sticks. 
---
Blood in, blood out. THAT would be a solid start to factions that matter.
---
I give alllllll of my crap away. Any legendary worth less than 100 caps per scrip value, and any plans worth less than 2000 caps. Because of the sheer quantity of stuff I give away, i don't feel any need nor obligation to run a *charity* in regards to my vending machine prices 🤷‍♂️ Eliminating micromanagement is the best!
---
I logged in about 12.15p.  Working fine for me. (PS4)
---
I think I am slowly becoming an ammo vendor. Everything else I try to sell is hit or miss.
---
Off the top of my head just for easy math. Say 50 rr per limb on ss 200 + 85 from ss chest + 90 from lead lined bp and what I think is 5 perk cards rad resist for another 50.
---
That's 425 rr plus another 125 if you get another +25 rr perk on every armor piece for a grand total of 550 
---
Give and take but even if you get it below &lt;1 given our low hp it still gonna be a pain from time to time
---
Good luck. Btw you don't have to follow the overseers journey all that way. What I mean is if the places that she leads you are too hard, just do some side quests to level up.
---
No one helps defend the extractors.
---
No one else repairs the extractors.
---
Everyone sits and camps until the notification comes up.
---
Me being the idiot trying to complete the event missed out on countless legendary kills because I (incorrectly) assumed everyone would work together in an event, wrong!
---
So now I pop those miners for myself, screw everyone else.
---
I think you're right, and it's certainly something I've been considering.
---
The one thing thats stopped me so far is we tend to talk on mic too, and tend to chat a fair amount about how stuff is going in our lives (we don't see each other often outside the game, so it's our time to catch up). I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about our personal lives if I felt that other people could be listening it. I also have misophonia, so if someone is eating I'd need to kick/mute them or disconnect myself.
---
I do actually like working together with other players we come across (e.g. in events), but I'm quite happy communicating with them via emotes.
---
What I really need to do is check the chat/audio settings and see if we can have a private audio channel. If so, everything is good!
---
EDIT: Just had a look at the audio settings - the options are: Team, Area, Auto (Team + Area), or None. So it looks like I'll be staying in a private team for now. I can live without the extra bonuses.
---
Okay that makes more sense because I have been getting on around 1130 est to start playing but today I got done early so it screwed it up I’ll have to remember that
---
&gt;Does it make sense that these common plans that are basically worthless are able to be turned into something that actually has value?       
---
     
---
Then you feel that I shouldn't be able to sell worthless crap to vendors for caps? No player is going to purchase a skiing outfit from me, but vendors will do it all day long. Does it make sense that vendors will buy common clothing that can't be sold or converted to scrap? No. If course not.     
---
So of course you agree that the entire economy is meaningless, and any rational comparisons to real-world economic strategy is nonsensical where vendors are concerned. So you agree to remove irrelevant point #4 from your manifesto, yes? Great!
---
I do with the plasma gatling, but I haven't unlocked the ultracite receiver yet for my plasma caster. Trying to save my gold for the secret service armor so I can have an all matching set of decent looking legendary armor instead of a mismatch hidden under clothing. May unlock it tonight depending on how many treasury notes I get
---
the key to Encryptid is to shoot the Imposter when it first arrives. There's some time for the pylon to power up, so you can shoot it for damage to register for the reward, even though it's still invincible. Prevents situation where some arse just melts the boxx
---
So, for anyone who hasn't logged in in the last hour, were back to 6 non-NW dailies. Knowing this, it may be that weekends have more dailies to do than weekdays.
---
Explosive bait.  That's how. Even on pacifist mode.
---
They really should start new characters with pacifist enabled...
---
But unfortunately that doesn't fix the base griefing. Had my base destroyed twice, once during SBQ and once during Encryptid. I'm assuming it was the exploding bait bug. Server hopped as soon as the events were over and I went back to my base to see him lobbing grenades at my base. Jokes on him, I'm a hoarder!
---
I bought 10 MIRVs the other day from a vendor and was extremely disappointed. I tossed one at the ghoul in the shipping container at the radio tower north of westek and the little fucker had almost no health gone. I figured enclosed space would help but it didn't do much.
---
I got rid of my vending machines months ago and it was legit the best decision ever.
---
Ahhh the glass caverns..... Where the scorched beasts fly though the ceiling and start the gas bombing.... Wonder if waste landers fixed that
---
Even just pulping them for fabric would be better than nothing.
---
Many are saying the reset is 1200 Eastern, so I am unsure.  I just stay away from the midday play.  Stinks, but it's a work around.
---
In my 3, NV, 4 playthroughs I used not to follow the plot at all but rather to explore each location on the map and clear them. Plot was left for the end. Is it viable approach for 76?
---
Yup that's the one :)
---
This! Iv scrapped a few rare cloths before. Sucks so much when it happens.
---
Why the hell will i wear wood armor at level 170
---
You’ll get 10 from doing Back on the beat at morgantown, if you haven’t already killed 10 before reaching steelhearts building.
---
double bonus: one of todays challenges is complete 1 event.
---
They are losers, but sadly the same type of people that “jump” people to grief are the same types that “jump” trap base builders.
---
They feel powerful when they have others to validate their cowardice.
---
A good strategy to beat multiple people is to have a bunch of turrets set up. These will shred un suspecting people. Also be aware that if their weapons are drawn or if they’ve got hidden friends nearby - there may be a chance that the punching person is being suspicious.
---
If you’re getting attacked you need to leave the friendly adventure mindset and enter all out non trusting pvp mindset.
---
PVP is all a mental head game for cowards, and so they’ll often desperately try to incite verbal chaos by projecting. They’ll hit you, call you a coward, ask to join your party (to wreck your base), pretend they’re alone, emote spam you, spread lies to other self righteous assholes on the server, and try to make you enemy number one.
---
Never trust their words. They are just instigating.
---
They’re bullies, but bullies have a weakness. They’re cowards at heart and will project their fears onto others. So the best practice is to bore them to death. Wait for that perfect opportunity for when they drop their guard.
---
I find it is best to train them and lock them into a behavioral rhythm, just like any competitive sport. Control the pace of their grief. Then that one lazy punch when their friends turn around or look the other way can allow you the chance to kill one or two of them.
---
You must also know how to pvp. Be ready and don’t fight in a fair way. Use turrets, nukes, OP melee, and healing. Kill at least one of them once.
---
Then fast travel to the vault and fast travel back before they can wreck you base. Now they’ll be livid because they got wrecked and have wasted their time. Just emote spam them back with taunts and hearts, and then message them things like get gud bro and u mad.
---
This is called reverse trolling and it will drive them off for sure. Only fight them once if you think you’ll win and have the advantage. Otherwise don’t fight and just skip straight to reverse trolling.
---
Once they leave consider yourself the self proclaimed winner of the universe and inhale some x-cell.
---
Good luck and happy troll hunting.
---
Edit: Never resort to swearing or getting angry. It will only validate their behavior and they will likely double down on ruining you day.
---
Hitting them when their back is turned works the best because they often forget that their “method” of partying up in order to troll has a downside - what I mean is that if troll A punches you while another isn’t paying attention it gives you the opportunity to kill the unprepared troll B that is looking away, because they’re likely partied up. This will anger troll B because troll A allowed you the opportunity to kill them. This can cause a rift in the troll party, and it shows them that maybe they bit off more than they can chew.
---
Never kneel to bullies. Always show them that if they poke you, they’ll get stung. Because they’re cowards, and cowards don’t want a fight, they want a victim.
---
Thank you!  It was kind of weird though... I went to blueprint, and nothing displayed.  I went to Stored, and there it was.  I'm on Xbox, so X button was label Store, when all the rest in that menu were labeled Scrap.  Clicked X anyway, and it gave the message that I was going to delete the item.  Clicked Yes... and problem solved.  Nice.
---
PA has a flat 15% damage mitigation per piece I believe.
---
Edit: I stand corrected.
---
&gt;The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%. Damage and radiation resistance provided by each piece is then applied to the remaining amount
---
Just my first one at the grove too. there were maybe 6-7 players fighting it. didn't feel it was any tougher than the SBQ fight. if anything it was easier because it doesn't fly away like a pansy
---
Agreed
---
I've been told they only receive reduced fall damage if that happens and don't die. Never tested it though or had it happen to me.
---
When you say "bad internet" if you mainly mean that you don't have high speeds then it's fine.
---
If bad internet involves the connection dropping out occasionally or spotty WiFi that goes in and out at times though, it's going to be a different story.
---
 I ended up buying a different wifi adapter at one point because it would sometimes have little hiccups that weren't really noticeable in other games and regular computer use.  76 though did not like that and would kick me off servers constantly.  It's all good now but it does not like spotty connections at all.
---
I have built a staircase from the base of the mountain to the top to make moving between the collectors "easier" but, at one stage I consistently spawned in the mountain. The results were undesirable. Through trial and error of moving my camp, I now seem to spawn in the acid cave or on the cliff edge, relatively close to the lead. That spawn  seems possible by placing you camp anywhere over the cliff edge on any suspended platform.
---
Equip the chemist perk and super duper and you’ll have so many when at a chemist workbench. Chemist doubles the output
---
I thought of the best reply to this, but I won't waste it on you.
---
Ok thanks! It’s not like it’s terrible and once I’ve finished my unyielding set I don’t even necessarily mind only being at 40% , but it definitely stinks to have my power fist read over 1k base damage and have to split that in half
---
Man I've done back on the beat so many times lately for the event stuff when it's been the only one up.
---
I tend to run around fist fighting them all to make it fun, and it's also a very good two for one today for sure.
---
So yeah, it seems you hit the bug like most people. But also, it seems we get the increased dailies on weekends only, so that kinda blows.
---
No. 6 is the thing I find most amusing. I've run into a lot of people that act like you are supposed to do things their way.
---
They broke lighting in wastelanders. Sadly, it appears to be intentional, since they listed it as an 'improvement' in the patch notes, so I doubt they'll fix it. It's garbage. Turning your back to the sun should not make your front side go completely dark.
---
Why do camp lights no longer cause camp items to throw shadows? I had a base in beta with floodlights behind vault boy cutouts on the roof, and it threw huge vault boy shadows on the ground. I want that back.
---
Also why are fully enclosed rooms in my camp still somehow brightly lit?
---
I’ve been spawning in the mountain and it’s been driving me crazy! Thanks
---
I didn't post right away.  I waited and did other things.  Then tried server hopping, then logging in and out.    
---
No dice.  
---
This takes the fun right out of the entire season.
---
Loot everything, scrap, keep what you need, bulk and sell the rest to bot vendors.  Hard bargain 3, grape mentats, and any alcohol that boosts charisma will give you better prices.
---
If its any consolation, I rarely had more than 2k caps until I crossed over L100 or so. By the time I hit 150, I regularly had 20k.
---
I’m not saying those guns exactly but anything semi-auto I just think we need better pistols bring back the 9mm the 12.7 honestly anything that could help us pistol builds have something fun and useful we can’t use vats with the gauss pistol and now the reflex sight is messed up on it so I can’t even aim right for headshots so my point is fix whats already there and bring in weapons from the old games
---
Score or not I am never touching that mode.
---
So you can role play a storm trooper.
---
nope, dropping a power armor allows it to be taken by anyone who walks by, and you lose it if you change servers. deploying a set of power armor has it recall once the timer expires or you leave a server
---
There's no more 2 extra daily. Also couple of people did the math at the start of the legendary run, and if you do all dailies and weeklies as it is, it's not enough for reaching rank 100 in time. We need every extra we can get.
---
Interesting!  Will try this with +critical damage
---
Nah it never completely drops, im in scotlands countryside, our internet runs of a phone line which is what everyones was like here years ago before it all got upgraded to bt superfast and stuff like that, its just really slow download and upload speeds, its steady, just very very slow depending how many people are online in the household, government refuses to upgrade rural areas as it'd cost tens of thousands for about 6 people to get it, not worth it to them😭😭
---
It gets easy to get use to, really the only draw back to all the benefits it's understandable broken. But it's how they designed it
---
Rug trick for sure. I use the small tan colored mat as it blends nicely with the a few of the titled floors.
---
Simply place the mat, the put the object on top. Next, grab the mat and move it to wherever. You'll notice the green outline around the object on top if done right. If not, move the object a little further back on the mat.
---
Oh yeah don’t get me wrong I would LOVE to see more weapons!
---
They could really implement all older fallout weapons imo.
---
Be careful what you wish for. Based on how easy today's challenge is, i might say tomorrow we might get that.
---
For sure bro
---
I think it's only if you're logged in as it changes at 12 EST because I sat there and watched every single challenge change out, already completed. After that it seems to be fine as I've never had another issue with it before.
---
Do-oh-ope
---
What system do you play on?
---
Just keep progressing with the main storyline and you will be able to unlock water purifiers for your camp.  Making ammo is hard very early on. Keep your eye out for items with lead in them and pick them up like 10 cans. Otherwise just keep your eye out for scorched and they usually have ammo on them. 
---
There is a ammo finder perk to that I used early on which helps. 
---
Keep an eye on your stash weight
---
It’s disabled because people can use it to cheat
---
That’s all I want lol
---
I think you don't know the definition of trolling.
---
Dude. You aren't missing much. It's barely a noticeable change. The camo desert colours just aren't that viable. Looks like the normal one, with a lick of dust.
---
ahhh.... never gets old!
---
Oooh I like this idea!
---
"I would say you have a face only a mother could love... except your entire family already died in the Great War!"
---
Love from Insult Bot
---
This one is just... No words can explain
---
Fr they act like they’re shocked when this type of stuff happens when they literally do it right back.
---
XB1
---
Hmmm thanks for the info! However my previous membership is also paid with Paypal, and it went through and activated almost immediately. Don't know why this time it became like this. Also an update, the customer service refuse to help now, saying that they will only help after 72 hours -_-
---
Don't worry. They will make this longer by a week or simply give all for free to everyone. Grinding was NEVER rewarding in Fallout 76.
---
Idk. I only really used the settler wanderer before I got bored of allies entirely.
---
OH GOD NOT THE PRIME NUMBERS
---
That's a good idea. I'd like them to make riding shotgun a bigger event and make it a bit tougher. I love running that one, it reminds me a bit of Metro 2033.
---
So, this isn't the game to do it because it is so soon after the war. But any game that takes place after Fallout 1s timeline could totally justify having modern music. I'm not saying we need shite like Snitch9ine or whatever. But I refuse to believe there isn't a bandit turned community that hasn't figured out metal or punk in 200 years.     
---
In that vein, I'd love to see the Regulator, by Clutch, make it in.
---
PA perfectly fits the slot between regular armors and Legendary armors..
---
its got good DR.. you can prance around in nuke zones.. you can fall off the highest places in the world and live and if your STR is under 11 it will raise your carry weight..
---
PA is pretty great...
---
Doesn't really work anymore.
---
It used to be my go-to. Now it just deletes the wire if moved this way.
---
Unless someone knows a new workaround.
---
Even with things to do I take a pause in between them for an event with some hoarding potential. Meditation rumble uranium line in the sand I won't miss. I understand skipping low hoard ones but I level up massively during those events. If you plan on beating Zorbo best go to those events.
---
I agree. I think until level 5 you are protected but then you have to turn pacifist on.
---
Pacifist would protect your camp. It would prevent PvP from being activated. The only thing that could damage your camp is if you have a workshop. That flags you for PvP or the explosive bait glitch I think like you said.
---
If you are on Xbox I have lots of supplies I can give you. I'm a hoarder too. Lol
---
Powe armor has a 7% damage reduction per piece, and 15% rad reduction per piece.
---
you used to be able to, but im pretty sure patch 20 broke it.  since patch 20 i have not been able to equip armor skins/paints in NW.  i even de-selected one if my camo paints frim the old bundle and it would not allow me to re-apply it to NW
---
I agree Biv is hilarious. Would love to have him running around my house.
---
Cheaters ruining all the fun again, bet it's why I couldn't stock my vendor in NW either - not that there's any caps to buy stuff from it xD
---
Yeah I wonder if it is a problrm at Bethesda or on Xbox Live. Because I tried to play another game on game pass and was getting some buggy things too.
---
I missed this but let me know when u want to run one. I can grab a card too. I know weekdays are difficult.
---
&gt; “~~YOURE~~YOUR the dumbass”
---
Fixed it for you. Not often that the "correct" way it is in the game is misspelled, lol
---
stop trying to argue with your facts and logic!
---
it doesn't work!
---
dont stand on the spawns yo.. the mobs will come to you..
---
dont be a dick
---
Oh right haha
---
Where can I get the chainsaw?
---
Found RifleGaming's alt account!
---
Rip you
---
As long as plasma cores and fusion cores are still given, since those are the only ones that aren’t.
---
And yes, I know that fusion cores are relatively common, and it isn’t too hard to make a bunch of plasma cores, but still.
---
This game is full of shit heads. Sorry you had a bad experience.
---
Sorry.
---
If you’ve played call of duty, ever, then you’d know that people can suck. They’ll hide and do you dirty at the drop of a hat. When the chips are down, these civilized people, will eat each other.
---
It also makes more sense game-wise. Someone gifted you ammo points into your account makes more sense than a buncha ammo just showing up in your inventory.
---
It just works
---
I died one time because I had no HP left, sucks.
---
Canned Tasty Squirrel Stew. Yes please
---
Ummm. Blue screen ain't right bud. Should probably check processes executed before failure.
---
I jumped off a cliff.
---
I forgot i'd removed goat legs earlier that day.
---
Hmm, are you on PC?
---
if you're running a sneaky boi, why would you not just use the stealth suit?
---
Ok i see your opinion on modern music i completely agree, I was talking about songs from previous fallout game integrated in to the Appalachia Radio. I haven’t listened to Regulator, Ill give it a listen
---
I think the ammount of stars just increases the likelihood of a higher starred item, as I've pulled 2* items from a 1* enemy
---
It’s just RNG my friend. 3* enemies don’t guarantee 3* loot
---
because that is how RNG works..
---
its not a guarantee.. its the best possible outcome..
---
the 3* on the enemy means it has a chance to drop up to a 3* legendary, but not guaranteed
---
Luck of the draw. 3 str can drop up to 3 star it’s not guaranteed. 2 up to 2 and 1 obviously just a 1.
---
Yo dude. Perhaps you should consider getting a Unlimited Internet tariff. With giffgaff or some cheap phone company. Then hot spot your phone.
---
They're just another xp farm imo
---
Disappointing 😒
---
I'm a part of the "Accidentally jumped into a Fissure" club. We have a lot of members......
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
Mostly Bethesda's fault for not providing a true PvP mode. It's a great opportunity with the public teams but they won't do it.
---
XD just be happy... When they used to add extra challenges for atoms... Then next days we had less.
---
32 with doing a couple (but not all) NW challenge as well. With this pace, next week gonna be the last one where I can get 10 rank in a week. If they don't up the scores or the number of challenges, there's no way most of the players can finish this.
---
At the end of the day it's just a game and some people just choose to be shitty online because they have nothing better to do and they feel like they're in power since they cannot be in power over whatever situation they are in in real life.
---
Yup. Lesson learned
---
Clutch is one of my top three favorites, so I'm glad I could share it with somebody. I completely agree that the game needs more music, but I've also played a combined total of a couple thousand hours across 3, New Vegas, 4, and 76. So I've heard every song more than enough lol. That's why I wish some new music could make it in. That being said, I still crank the hell out of Butcher Pete every time
---
It's me, I'm the CAMP fashion police. Ugly camp? Nuked + "YOUR the dumbass" note
---
He should be a craft able skin for the collectron, and the recipe can be spoiled veggies, meat, fruit and 3 insult notices.
---
I already do that with my phone, we only just get 4G here, its good enough to get a stable 80ms but its worse than the wifi if the weather is bad, a lot of signal interference in the country🤣
---
they have one of the lowest drop rates in the game. You need to do events in the savage divide. Also i read it can drop from messenger events no matter where it is. 
---
I'm keeping mine as the price has about doubled in the last few months.
---
I'm selling stuff for 0-2 caps, maybe relax a bit, or just keep your comments to yourself, that's always an option.
---
Xbone
---
If those people people want pvp they should just hop on nuclear winter. But they want their broken weapons in adventure and mutations.
---
Well the robot was programmed by highschool students
---
Just use rad x diluted when fighting ghouls or sbq.  And diluted rad away to balance
---
Go away from the area for 5 mins, when you come back the gone corpse should be a pile of gore on the floor.
---
Also works for glitched ones that freeze in time on death, but aren't corpses to loot.
---
You can hear me? Wtf!?
---
This.  The comedic value of the "thwong" sound is worth carrying one and as someone else also said you can use it to complete the buried with honor daily as the static spawn shovel isn't always there.
---
Tied between falling into a fissure and trying to fast travel to a camp on Seneca ... leaning toward the latter. Though I once accidentally exited my PA in a nuke zone and died to rads before I could get back in. Then there were the cliff falls. Come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve ever had a heroic death in this game. 😕
---
Bruuuuh. I lived in a rural area in West Sussex. I feel you.
---
Best option. Although expensive for initial installation... Satalite Internet.
---
I thought about that, is it not expensive asf though? Havent looked into it
---
I had been logged in playing and checked the dailies when I realized it was 7 minutes past the hour. All were completed except Hack A Terminal. First time this has happened to me. Playing on PC via Steam launcher.
---
Tbh i was hoping elon musks new satellite internet system would be my saviour😂😂😂
---
I have at least 700 hours across New Vegas, 4 and 76. Some of the song are great from the games but I agree that some new songs would be nice to heard. Man, Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition goes hard too
---
And salt?
---
The light on the helmet is 10x better than your pipboy. It's like the bright light attachment for PA.
---
Solid suggestion. I just hate seeing these posts because Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about quality of life and this awesome idea will never see the light of day
---
Collect and sell ammo
---
Cause back in patch 3 they nered it cause players where complaining about to many legendaries
---
Lol whoops, sold mine for 1k caps
---
I disabled background music ages ago
---
I have so many damn fusion cores rn I don't know what to do with them.
---
And tissue for your issue.
---
I never trade, just buy from vending machines.
---
Don’t make a new character, just switch the perks around now that you lvl50+ it would be easier to lvl up.
---
How many skiing outfits do you have to sell in order to buy one of the serums.  Let’s say you get an absolute best price of 17,500 for one of the serums.  Let’s say you can sell some golf outfits for 27 caps a piece.  That’s \~650 golf outfits to get a single mutation serum.  About 13 days of earning max caps from selling golf outfits to get a single plan.  With max Charisma.  
---
If they did the equivalent with plans for a fair trade off, how many people would come online and just bitch about how much you need to grind to get the good plans from he recycler.  
---
If they don’t make it have a grind, then nothing is solved. Sure, for a short time people clean out their plans, then we are back where we started with people having a ton of plans that have no value.  Then we’re all back to bitching about having a few hundred copies of Mole Miner Gauntlet plans and we still have thousands of the mounted head plans.  What ends up being solved?
---
Wouldn’t a better solution just be to give a cap value to plans so people could sell them to vendors like the rest of the junk we find?  I mean if no player wants to spend 5 caps to buy a mounted head plan and you can’t even give away plans like mole miner gauntlet, let’s just treat it as any other junk and give them a few caps worth of value.  
---
Or, maybe not everything needs to even have value.  Maybe if you can’t get people to buy a plan you just drop the piece of shit on the ground and let it rot away. Why does everything have to have a value?  Why can’t we just say “Yup, nobody wants this” an throw the crap away?
---
I'd actually really enjoy NW if it wasn't for Frog Legs tbh
---
Completely agree! So tired of popping over to what looks like a well attended event kicking off only to find when I get there that everyone's gone and it's just me and 15 mole miners who are PISSED OFF.
---
I might be 100% wrong but I think the award was for completing 3 NW events not challenges.
---
Mine triggered after my 3rd NW game last week .. I was very pleasantly surprised
---
With a beam splitter and formula p it can become magic, with enough formula ps all your beams will converge on one spot, giving you a very accurate minigun shotgun
---
Yo wtf. Never seen that.
---
yes
---
I need ammo though, I have none,  at this point I'm using a melee weapon
---
Yep
---
Oh yeah. Satalite is pricey. But like I said.. Most expensive part is initial sign up.
---
That's why my collectron-hub has "Free shit." written on it
---
While I do see your point, Bethesda didn’t have an option to report them because they weren’t violating the rules. You engaged in PvP with them and that’s how they got your base. If your not interested in PvP there is always pacifist mode.
---
Apparently it was just for the weekend- Personally I'm hoping its a consistent thing and not just one-time.
---
The game can't even decide if it's a hit or miss. I shot a Scorcher 4 times for 2.5K damage each and only the fourth shot killed it.
---
Oh why good sir have you not heard? Redeye in nuka world plays semi modern songs he made up on his guitar
---
Maybe it will only be a weekend thing?
---
You could have got 15k+ for that easily D:
---
I was in an events group yesterday doing the campfire tales event, by myself for the entire event until the legendary counselor spawned, when one of my “teammates” magically shows up and killed it before I could get a shot in. Gigantic asshole.
---
I’m excited for the botherhood but also can’t wait for the enclave to show up. Right now I think Bethesda’s plan is to bring all the factions in with storylines and then start from there so don’t think of it as being forced to work with them indefinitely just being introduced to them in this part of the world for now. Later on we might get the choice to actually commit to the faction that we want to be with. Also the secret service is already part of the enclave this group in vault 79 as far as I can tell doesn’t know about the enclave yet but might be brought into the enclave when or after  they show up
---
Edit1: also this might not stay the brotherhood but become a splinter faction based off a theory I seen so take it with a few grains of salt
---
there are probably several categories; the ebayers, the glitch levelers, and the b2525 fixer crowd.
---
Some high level crying about you being there?
---
That time frame has drastically shrunk as of a few days ago.
---
Honestly I think a lot of new Vegas's songs would work in West Virginia cause country life
---
Chew gum while your doing it... 3 for 1 :)
---
Yeah. Couple of them screamed that I was a leecher into their mics.
---
Minutes until the jokes get old and same-y....3...2...1
---
Oh god I hope that wasnt the extra score event that was announced (not the bonus exp weekend).
---
Wasn’t there a person who uploaded a video of it happening in the moment?
---
This is Social Media / Reddit. I can comment if I like, don't tell me what to do. If you want to rob new players, rather than just helping them for free, that's up to you too.
---
people sending in bullshit tickets for crap like this is probably why legit tickets take so long to resolve..
---
Am I wrong in saying that they removed those two extra challenges? I'm not sure now but I could've sworn we had 9 challenges yesterday and now we're back to 7.
---
You don’t need to herd them all the way, once they are up the slope or about to get to their final positioning they usually walk on
---
Their own, they walk on their own but move faster when herding so you can let them walk to their last place then focus on the sheepsquatch
---
I couldn't figure out what platform you are on doing a brief glance at your history (I'm a lazy, lazy man). We sit in different rooms of the house, so we use the in-game chat. Honestly, we just talk about whatever even on that chat channel. But with some other games, if we don't want to be on the game chat, we switch over to the chat options built into the Playstation. The Playstation chat option works better, especially when Fallout 76 *gasp* crashes. 
---
I assume XBox has a similar "direct" chat option - I've never owned one, but I would be shocked if a voice chat option didn't exist.
---
I don't game much on PC anymore, but the few times I do I have been using Discord to talk with my nephew, which works out real well. So that's one of many options on the PC side. And again, when Fallout crashes, you would still be able to talk.
---
I’m lv 330 ish. I’ve played for over a year and I had good gear, but not god tier, before. Which I worked hard for. 
---
But I guess the game reflects the real world, everybody wants everything but they dont want roll their sleeves up. 
---
I agree with you though. The rng is awful.
---
Definitely getting tired of seeing the BoS every game it would be a nice fresh start to have to side with the Enclave , Bethesda had a nice karma thing going in fallout 3 where your choices had some consequences and also obsidians Fallout NV which had an amazing story with detailed backgrounds for each character just hope we don't see the same result as we had in fo76 wastelanders. Don't get me wrong the raider faction definitely had some unique characters and even the settlers had Dr. Penelope Hornwright but having the same result at the end kinda seems bland. Just hoping it doesn't end in a generic way for the seasons brotherhood
---
How does this get downvoted? It’s more true than ever now...
---
I just did this and find it does help improve the vibe!
---
Ignore them. Some people run around thinking they own the wasteland
---
Spoke too soon, it’s back to the usual number of dailies today
---
You need invitations for public events?
---
I'm going to sounds like my home is under a rock but what is an ammo converter and what does it do now that it's fixed?
---
I should be more specific, did you quit the game while in Nuclear Winter and the next time you logged on and into a normal world was after the challeges released. Plus, log into an Aventure mode world, not private world.
---
I has to boot her dirty ass from my camp lol. I have the commander back. Even her constant sweet talk isnt as annoying as the wanderer.
---
I sort of done it the other day by accident like magic shotgun but bloodied
---
Stop logging on at the crack of dawn. Sleep in the morning and then get on after the dailies have been added. Problem solved!
---
I rebuilt my cliff camp so that the vending machines stay on solid ground when I log out.
---
Get loot and you are doing enough damage. Enough said.
---
I like to message other players on the map before starting an event like encryptid or Rad Rumble.  About 50% or them join me.
---
Problem as I see it though. 
---
If the plans are too easy to acquire by recycling - then we are going to quickly be back at square one. You have all the new plans and then have a stockpile of plans that they can’t use.  We’d have to pressure them constantly to add new plans.  
---
Unless we add in all the similar caps and limits like we do with all the other currencies and then we have a bitch fest that the new plans are too grindy to get and people start looking for a way to exploit it.
---
And the point I was making with #4 ties back to my last point - there is junk vendors will buy (like outfits) - but how many outfits do you need to sell in order to get something good like a serum plan, or more reasonable like some PA plans.  It’ takes a while with good CHA to get them.  Would people really be happy with that kind of new grind
---
Maybe a better solution is to just make it so vendors can buy them.  It’s not a new currency.  People won’t hold onto things they don’t want anymore.  And that solves the problem - you can sell them and other junk and get the stuff you want.
---
or maybe we really don’t need to recycle anything - maybe we should just acknowledge not everything needs to have a value, and if there is stuff so common other players don’t want it, we just throw it away.  Why do these extra plans have to be given a purpose.  If you have 20 copies of mounted mole rat head, why not just dump them on the ground, since you know everyone else has 20 copies too.  Why does it *have* to be given a value?
---
Edit: I also didn’t see in his post that they would be new plans. It just said plans, I took it as the existing ones.
---
[um... July 23 is a double daily weekend](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg)
---
*Edit: you may have been referring to the additional daily challenges and not the double  score daily*. 
---
Also those people who “did the math” did it wrong. Not only did they fail to account for double daily weekend (again see link above) which will give you up to 8000 extra score, but they also incorrectly calculated the total score required in a season (they calculated 100 levels, when really it should be 99. Level 1 is free). Total score needed is 220,275. They were off in their “math” by 3,475 score.
---
TLDR, don’t trust bad math.
---
Alas, I need an Herbivore Serum.  :-)
---
Sounds like they got malformed personalities. It’s pretty ballsy to do that event at level 25. I’d be impressed you’re taking part.
---
Was it as extensive as this one?
---
The only difficult one is revive a teammate.. And both times I was lucky to have an afk teammate who kept dying.
---
The lock pick one is difficult until you find one to spawn next to
---
When you craft your ammo, don’t forget ammosmith2 and super duper3.  ammosmith2 boosts yield, and if super duper prices, even better.
---
Beneficial on all a o types, but especially helpful on 308.
---
Eh. He's not even an infoemed scammer/duper. You actually CAN copy items that can't be sold for caps. 
---
Sorry this happened, but it happens to be the worst time for trades. A lot of dishonest people out there right now.
---
I was confused at first. As I was wondering how you had footage of his gameplay, yet you were the other gent.
---
People are assholes.
---
Hopefully, the AFK user learned something. If I'm going AFK, I make sure to at least be sitting in my own Camp, or inside places like Foundation or The Overseers House
---
I blue screen at least once a day and so do my friends. Noticed mostly whenever I do back on the beat
---
I'm tired of em now but the NPCs added a lot of character to the event.
---
In all fairness you only need to do about 1% of her health bar’s worth of damage to get kill credit and you’re increasing her health bar by quite a bit more than that just by being there. (Her health scales based on the number of players doing the event) If you’re ever in a queen fight that lasts more than 10 minutes, leave before it ends. You’ll just be wasting players’ time and ammo by staying there.
---
I want to make a “should be able to post”, but my issues are so meh, I don’t know if it’s worth it:
---
- sell magazines at stations. 
---
- favorite power armor to prevent accidental scrap. 
---
- not take fall damage spawning into your own camp
---
- I’m sitting on 59 perk points to upgrade cards. Convert atoms?
---
- camp vendors turn off once 30k caps is reached or item doesn’t sell
---
- if moving camp, vendors don’t empty.
---
Fuck em. If you are getting credit at level 25 that is great. I see people level 60-100 that regularly don't when she dies fast. I usually do a few thousand damage and switch to mobs to farm xp. If the event lasts longer than 5 minutes then I'll help finish her off. Damage is damage regardless and it saves other people ammo with you there tagging her. I guess they just felt the need to publicly display their stupidity lol.
---
Happened to me yesterday. 5 of the 9 challenges were completed when I logged in. One was a 2/2 challenge that was only 1/2 fulfilled. Read about it here for weeks. Then finally happened yesterday.
---
&gt;Maybe a better solution is to just make it so vendors can buy them.
---
Well I definitely agree there.  It's so simple and so obvious.  They'd probably need to adjust the value of some plans, but, I've been mindboggled since day one that you can't simply vendor things like this.
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll give it a test on PC.
---
new player here just to say thanks to people that put amo and meds for sale at cheap prices, I've been trying to participate in events but I feel more like a burden to the team.
---
You cannot change the color in fallout 76
---
Pfft what assholes. I love seeing low levels at the sbq fight especially those single digit levels. I'm impressed you were able to get that much damage in at 25! I didn't even do the event for the first time until after level 50 and I definitely did not get it the first time.
---
Similar death.  Was shooting at a Yogi with a missle launcher.  he got close.... boom, blew myself up.  
---
Fireproof didn’t help on that one....
---
Sell or scrip them?
---
A solution would to not do nuclear winter rewards. I have not touched those since Legendary Run was implemented and I am doing just fine.
---
I'm in the "intentionally jumped into a fissure site to see what happens" club.
---
Can't even say it was an accident. .
---
My weekly completed after I deployed my camp and finished the daily challenge.  
---
I know one of the dailies this past week was to simply go up a rank in NW.  Do you remember if you leveled up after that match?  It may have triggered the daily that then completed your weekly
---
That's my stealth vats commando. I've found it to be pretty dang good. Just got into it a month ago though so not super sure if I can tweak it haha
---
That's fucked up. I game causing a bsod is a big problem. Could your gpus be throttling? It's quite a demanding game.
---
I always have x2 50% reduced fall damage armor pieces equiped at most times. I managed to remove one when changing gear and forgot to put it back on and went and jumped off the monorail elevator.
---
We should team sometime - hubby and I both play teamed on PS4 too.
---
If you can't log in for literally less than a minute to deploy a camp one time today and complain about it you're just a whiny bitch. It's easier than any other score daily even in the normal game mode.
---
Been server hopping for an hour or two trying to buy some treasure hunter event plans and it is DEAD
---
I remember that station not being, like, existing songs, but, and I could be misremembering because I didn't spend a whole lot of time on that station, I thought it still sounded old. Like Elvis Presley or Johnny Cash adjacent. I realize that does make it newer than most of the music played in Fallout games. But, again, 200+ years. We made it from Sinatra and Roy Brown to Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley in a decade lol. And I will argue till the end of time that music doesn't play enough of a role in the Fallout universe, compared to our own lol

True but I saw some weapons and asked him if he wanted to trade unfortunately he was just a scammer.
---
they can take it, but in my experience, most people won't. Just as a rule of thumb though, I wouldn't walk around with too much junk material as a habit.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
The only time I had an issue was the one time I did NW
---
Cant even sell a nuke card in my vendors. I have dumb luck and always see that thing flyin around. They usually got bought as soon as i posted them up. Now they just rot.
---
Looks like a decent build to me! What weapon do you use?
---
Wait so some random lets say 200 can just take it?
---
No, but you can make an insult bot for reddit, and that would be almost as cool.
---
I would if I knew how, and had the time to do it.
---
I probably should of elaborated that more in the description that it was my footage. But I definitely agree with you.
---
I only received 7 dailies today.
---
All tje upvotes. Even better if since its a players collectron they csnt shoot it, it just keeps on following till it reachs yiu lol
---
I run two xbox's and play two char at same time...one is always leeching....I dont give a fuck what anyone else says
---
Nope me either
---
IF you are PS4, you can use the messaging app instead. I can't stand the sound of eating either.
---
Now we just have much more variety of great godrolled weapons which makes it look like its more extensive but with the old dupes you were able to dupe your whole inventory over and over again. If you started with 1 tse handmade you ended up having 10k+ of them within 30min.
---
And with more and more ppl who couldnt get enough it ended up that ppl duped millions of each items at once and crashing the server with it....
---
For a time of nearly one month the game was unplayable as you was sure once you made your way through the silo someone else already crashed the server or at least caused lags that its unplayable 😅
---
Why in the fuck would Bethesda make you join the same server multiple times?
---
I'm using a b2525 fixer and b2525 combat rifle (love that pumpkin paint haha)
---
2nd on Instigating Lever, player favorite for a reason
---
I had the same bullshit thing happen to me.... I killed my very first wendigo Colossus.. and it was a fucking level 90 3 star legendary. After it finally died (8,000 rounds of .50 later) it disappears and couldn't loot it.
---
and to be clear, i don’t HATE the idea of the recycler, I just don’t think it really solves the problem, at least not in the long run.    
---
Allowing the vendors to buy the plans (and I agree some will need to have the value modified \*cough\* mole miner gauntlet \*cough\*) is probably the simplest and least resource intensive to implement.
---
I wanted to triy out my explosive gatling plasma. So I went to Morgantown, killing low level ghouls. Well, some sneaked behind me... and I shot them point blank range... I melted myself less then a nanosecond.
---
Pa has a hidden dr regular armor doesn’t.
---
my regular armor is 335 dr, my goto pa is excavator.  250 dr, I think.
---
some enemies will eat me for lunch in regular armor, but those same enemies same location do not survive  if I am in excavator.
---
take stim, click with mouse (dont spam "e"), and  put away the gun can help. 
---
BUT if bethesda can fix their shlt too, it maybe be a better help...
---
You mean treasure maps? The ones on yellow legal pad paper?
---
Yea it’s a pvp area.
---
Fluffy is more savage, than insult bot, imo
---
Reviving 2 teammates is pretty difficult for me, especially when I don't have friends who I can tell to just jump off a cliff
---
I was trying to get the kill creatures challenge, I had 2/3 going into it .. and at the end I got the award.. didn’t kill anything.. nothing came past my bush :)
---
I did add my outfit, hat, power armor, weapon and pip-boy skins, but not regular armor.
---
The S.C.O.R.E. required to go from 99 to 100 is **3450**. If you buy just that level, with a mere 150 atoms, you can skip 13.8 S.C.O.R.E. dailies that are each worth 250 S.C.O.R.E. (13.8 x 250 = 3450).
---
Now, invest a few of those 150 atom rewards that you get from the board into the last few levels, and you can skip quite a few dailies, and still get to level 100, no problem.
---
I had 3....and now 6...I display them....only gotten 3 from drops tho
---
same, and fuck contacting bethesda support to have the same idiotic questions asked back and forth, Todd can keep his score points if that's our only course of action.
---
Anyone can take it as its a world workshop where players fight to keep hold of it if others want it.
---
You can build stuff at your camp and no one can touch that.
---
Nice, I'm yet to pull a decent bloodied weapon after about 200 hours... Did you get yours from gameplay or vendor?
---
We totally do that if we team with randos, but our setups are in the same room so we have to either only one person use mic and the other not at all or mute each other lol
---
Yes, workshops are PvP zones. If you own one and someone else wants it they can contest it. They attempt to take it from you, and you can choose to defend it if you like.
---
Or just walk away and let them have it.
---
If you want to play this game truly single player you would need to subscribe to FO1st.
---
Some have a lower chance of 3stars...like the robot glitch in vault...I stopped doing that as it always drops trash for me
---
Yeah, but will that stupid robot on the radio ever shut up?
---
Yeah it sounds like 70's music but anyways I just don't think modern music would fit in fallout like yeah it has to exist but it just doesn't fit the theme and besides in the fallout universe there was never a cultural revolution of the 60's
---
I stopped with vending when I found myself is the cycle of hitting max caps, then searching for stuff to buy, over and over and over...
---
Well yeah, but you can not fast travel all day waiting for Bethesda to fix it or you can use a work around. Don't really see the point of replying if the only thing you're going to add is that they could fix it.
---
The yellow treasure maps?
---
Yes, workshops are basically the PVP of the adventure mode.  Anyone of any level can come and challenge you for the workshop.  And you only hold the workshop for as long as you are online.  
---
Depending on the workshop, most people won’t challenge you for them.  Some are more popular, Hemlock Holes Maintenance can provide a lot of acid, so it’s sometimes popular.  The munitions factory is another one, but not as needed anymore with the ammo converter and the ammo generator being available. 
---
At one point they were very useful, but even in the early days of the game I held them for entire play sessions with no one harassing me.
---
Even with a perk card for the cores I'm burning through them after locating a nice gat laser, try one out if you want a good use for them.
---
I traded a je plasma for it. I got the combat rifle before this new farming method haha. That one cost me a fair amount
---
Only insults vending machine lookers that don't buy anything! 🤣
---
That is really dumb they should not have done something like that. Imagine me with some mid tier weapons and some other dude in powerarmor and a fatman....this game man i expected too much i guess.
---
This is a great idea! Seconded.
---
Hopefully it helps, I know it pretty much takes care of the problem for us bit we're on ps4.
---
It would be funny if the start of the 200 year war between the Enclave and BOS was started by a yokel from a vault in West Virginia.
---
Ask around reddit nows a good chance to "find" a cheap b2525 fixer
---
Sounds like a blast. Not 😂
---
Literally never placed him, didn’t know that about him! Sorry Beckett.... it’s time to close down
---
Yup. I might also jump worlds once or twice hoping to find someone or their camp near my destination if it's far enough.
---
I want the one that herds cats 🐈
---
No it isn't "problem solved." This is not the only way it happens, nor is a workaround solving the issue of it continuing to happen or the issue of people now being behind thousands of SCORE
---
I'm your standard bloodied build and I literally hurl my dead body repeatedly at pylons because I just want to finish the event. There are a few times I don't even get a shot in on the sheep-ass-tron because I'm just trying to make sure he's able to take damage so we can get the thing done...
---
Well sort of. Because the early stages of the main questline take you to low level areas and that won't be fun if your a high level and decide to do it later on. So thats why I suggested doing  the wayward questline. But anyway you can just explore the world and do whatever.
---
He also can’t name one thing he missed about gang life!
---
Truth
---
I've had this a lot. Does the luck stat effect anything? I rarely get a one star legendary in general and I have almost max luck.
---
Hell yeah man go get some of that sbq don’t let losers like that get to you they are just jealous they didn’t have the balls you do to go fight her at your lvl, besides it’s team oriented so everyone there that’s fighting her and her horde are contributing and should be there unlike a few of my fellow higher lvl players who just want to stand around and be useless
---
Wait and what if i log off and go online again? Will my shop just disappear??
---
I've seen some people say the challenge completed for them at just 2/3.  Like the weeklies that completed at 3/5 last week, I guess it's just Bethesda being Bethesda again
---
Yesterday i unfortunately kill the heart in one hit and the event bugged it didn't finished and i didn't seen the mirelurk queen 😢
---
Ironically the fatman is one of the worst weapons in the game 😂
---
It’s unlikely Bethesda would make an actual crossover with anything. An event like that could be possible though, but would make way more sense to tie it to the interloper and the lovecraftian elements that already exist within the fallout games. Bethesda is far more likely to spoof or parody another ip than to do an actual legit crossover it’s basically 90% of their content and theming
---
Without voice chat people have to make their penis size clear in a way right? That is the only reason I can think off.
---
Ah yes 120 euros haha absurt.
---
Not just fix it, *compensate.* People shouldn't be thousands behind on an already long and difficult grind because of *their* fuck up. It's seriously fucking ridiculous that they haven't made an official statement on this. They will be charging for levels starting this week.
---
That is utter and complete bullshit. They would/could give us the missing atoms before when the atom challenges bugged and now they are suddenly saying they can't give us score? They have just decided not to. They have the capability to do it. If they can't give score why not give atoms for the amount needed to buy the missing score.
---
I have always liked the idea of scraping legendaries into materials AND legendary modules, or at least have a chance to do so, that's what i love from mmo's after all.
---
The salt one is a bit eh, since it requires a very specific item to be useful, but the rest of these seem good. Naturally, the insult bot will be the testing dummy for this...
---
I was moving during the event and missed the entire thing, anything at this point. At least I've managed to find most of the mounted heads, no shortage there.
---
Its not, next weekend is double xp and week after is double score, check the roadmap.
---
Oh okay a railwaycanon then.
---
Haven't found a nice laser gat. Only have a ghoul one that I just use as opposed to using a non legendary
---
What I do is have my camp on the far right since I stock expensive end game things. That way new players don't come. Not because they arnt welcome but because I want to sell my stuff. I do very rarely have a level 20 running in getting chased by a level 62 ghoul lol. I am by a road and they see my camp with it's lights and run for it.
---
My theory too is if someone is willing to spend 30 caps to travel to my four full vendors they are more likely big spenders. I keep some stim packs and water in the machine for cheap but no takers given people don't want the weight at high levels. If I am there and someone lower than 50 comes I usually just drop free water anyway. I once had a low level go around my camp at all the locked purifiers (I run a large small purifier farm). He was checking them all. I just dropped water for him and he drunk a few there and then. If he is on the right of the map at a low level no wonder he needed water.
---
To say they can't is utter and complete bullshit. They would/could give us the missing atoms before when the atom challenges bugged and now they are suddenly saying they can't give us score? They have just decided not to. They have the capability to do it. If they can't give score why not give atoms for the amount needed to buy the missing score.
---
Dude, give em hell.  I love to see a low level fighting his ass off in Scorched Earth.   IDGAF if you just have a hunting rifle and a mean look on your face.  Just please stay off V9 or the fences.  That keeps her from landing.
---
I'm a high level and I'll even help you if I see you.  Ignore the azzhats.
---
I leech the teapot all the time.  Feel guilty one shotting everything, so I l tag a few and sit back and let the low levels get the XP.  I do help out if things get out of hand though.
---
I would love this. Some weapons (like Gauss rifles, Cryolators and Ultracite Laser rifles) are way more common as legendary than standard, and would make mod learning easier.
---
Sell me one plz
---
Yeah, it's gate timed to do 3-5 waves of enemies.
---
I got two legendary Ferals and a Mirelurk Queen a few days ago, but I've gotten the Grafton Monster each time since.
---
The Ferals and MQ run, I died and got the Respawn Glitch so I couldn't even get the loot because I had to quit and restart. :-/
---
Damn.. how am i suppost to defend it then if i am 17 and someone else 100?
---
fill team: off; select deploy point; place camp; run into de flames. 
---
took me 38 seconds to complete it :)
---
I honestly wish it was still reasonable to run Lone Wanderer. It just isn’t now. Too much XP lost.
---
I just hit Level 50 so I have yet to get the high end gear, but I find that the Excavator power armor provides great utility. Can't beat the +100 carry weight and the 4x bonus to mining ore. Whenever I overextend myself looting I like to have that on standby so I can fast travel
---
You. Seriously. Needed. To. Have. Me. Around. Just to. Insult you...Pathetic.
---
No, there was a treasure hunter event involving killing special mole miners. They had special plans, like for outfits and a backpack skin
---
I do partly agree with this. However, there are times (example: trying to put the train cars from slocum joe bundle on a hill) that things tend to float at times. :(
---
You'll have to claim it again.
---
No. There was a treasure hunter event where you hunted down a specific type of mole miner. They gave out "pails" that had various rewards, mostly plans, some of them were unique to the event and a low drop rate.
---
I used all my 200+ vintage nukashine in a single day.
---
I kind of feel sorry for the new guys, but once they disappear and reappear across the map I laugh.
---
Lol “Let me just slip a Mini Nuke and grenade rounds into the “...” section of your rewards list so you have to comb through your entire inventory to find what’s causing the weight increase”
---
Huh?  
---
Sounds like you're talking about something I haven't experienced.
---
I've missed out on a fair few events due to this bloody bug. So any tip is appreciated.
---
I also hear drinking and eating before pulling up the map helps. Bugthesda, at its best.
---
And what if i build some stuff in it?
---
WTF man, how is he supposed to get better?  Let the man contribute how ever he can.  We were all lvl 25 one time.
---
I mean yes if they get rid of the ugly terminal with it or place one at like white spring or purvy.
---
Like it or not.
---
Workshops ARE pvp
---
If you dont want to pvp, stay away from them
---
More resources can be farmed in the world that can come from workshops
---
Yes, the workshops are temporary.  Your CAMP is not (and you can even build your camp over some extractors found in the world making them mini workshops, you may have seen some other players like that). 
---
For that matter, you likely aren’t even going to log into the same server you were on.  Each server holds about 32 people, and if you log out and log back in, odds are you are going to go to a different server anyways.

Like I said, workshops were intended to be PVP areas. You take it because it gives you access to multiple extractors and resources that you can gather every hour, as well as defense events that grant you XP, Caps, and other rewards.  The flip side is that you owning a workshop makes you a PVP target and you might get other players (sometimes even teams of players) coming by to challenge you for it.
---
As soon as you log off you lose the workshop (in reality you have a few minutes to log back in) but after that it’s free again for anyone else to take.
---
I got lucky; bloodied/250 resistance reload ultracite gat dropped off sbq one time, even though I'm stealth shotgunner spec I drag that thing out at least once a day to burn something annoying down.
---
Also wait, like 1 second pressing buttons.
---
this bug has been known since the update first came out. why are you still on the servers when the challenges are rolling over? that's the interim fix - log out, close the game, go stretch for 20 minutes or something.
---
Yes, bethesda should fix this, but you can do your part to prevent it from happening as well!
---
They really need to bring back that feature where non legendary ghouls would drop legendaries.
---
I wish there was an auction house we could setup through our in base PCs. I have some many plans on my store that never get bought. I wish I knew which ones were common or rare without having to come to form online or something to price check it. I'm about to just bring them to an NPC and do away with them. I just don't have the time in life to play economy and the game. I'm starting to think I'm playing the wrong kind of game with how I'm going to need to start a weekly ballistic fiber material run to not have everything I'm wearing break. If I run out of story line and it turns into a grind, I have so many other games to play so I'll be out.
---
Ive learned that zooming in and clicking the e on the yes seems to work for me but will try yours when im on
---
Ooooo now I want my house rated!
---
What's the 'Bonus 500 S.C.O.R.E. worth of challenges' checkbox for?
---
I want this too.  For the insult notes
---
Oh, so it's a bug, then? Hope they fix it soon.
---
Ok now i got it. Still pretty dead in the wasteland.
---
And a Freedom bot collectron like the vendor in Harper's ferry
---
It's like all other bugs from the beta.
---
they come after every update, they will "fix" it next time aaaaaand, after patch 21/22 this will be bugged again. when you play 2-3h and you lose like 30-45 mins just from the TP, you are a little bit upset. and it's just this bug.
---
when i can say this is a chitty company i do. nothing more.
---
I got some for sale on pc
---
Man that's too good
---
\^\^ THIS!
---
Don't do NW until you have logged in and done your Adventure mode dailies.
---
Log out 15 min before dailies reset and log back in 15 min after reset.
---
I have had zero problems.
---
Everyone is duping dude
---
Vampire gat laser means you can sit still and just fire at queen and never die
---
We certainly all were, but the difference is that I made a point not to make playing the game harder for the people around me when I was a low level. Why not grind until you can actually contribute like the rest of us? It’s just the polite and decent thing to do.
---
You mean the scorchbeast thing isn't really the challenge?  Hmm.. Color me surprised.
---
Damn I'm on xbox but thx
---
I absolutely never trade. An IRL friend of mine got ripped off twice doing trade menus. 
---
It's in the Machine if you want it. I'm getting by just fine with the Legendary Drops or items bought from Vending Machines.
---
If you stay crouched you won't  appear on the map. If you are outside the bounds of the workshop area you are safe. Keep pacifist mode on, get out of the workshop area ASAP. Let the workshop defence events fail and do the workshop retake missions instead. If someone takes your workshop server hop rather than contest. Workshop areas are legitimate PVP areas and most PVP players are specifically built for the purpose. If you take a workshop build a stash box and stash your junk. 
---
There are a lot of things you can do to reduce your risk from getting murdered, but workshops are legit PVP zones so understand you are taking a risk.
---
Big rip, ive probably done over 30 trades and a bunch where the opportunity to scam was there but never taken. Rng gods were not on your side, post his name to the reddit
---
Complete the wastelanders questline. Side with Foundation if your character is a shotgun user. Side with Crater if your character is a heavy weapon user. You'll need to grind the daily quests for both of these factions for about a month if you want to max out your reputation for them and get their special gun. Both factions also feature compound bow plans at max reputation, and Foundation features a couple melee weapon plans (not the best weapons, but the plans serve a purpose).
---
In addition to the two previously-mentioned factions, there's also the secret service vendor who will sell secret service armor, T-65 power armor, plasma caster, and gauss pistol plans. You do not need to max a reputation bar for these items.
---
After the wastelanders questline, public events and daily reputation quests will give you treasury notes. You can turn 20 of these in a day for 200 gold bullion. Gold bullion is used to buy all the gear mentioned above (aside from compound bow plans).
---
Additionally, a legendary 3\* .50 MG can be obtained from completing Becket's questline. The effects are always 50% armor ignore, +25% fire rate, and +250 DR while reloading.
---
Any of the crafted items (aside from the compound bow and T-65 PA) obtained above require legendary modules from the Purveyor to craft, but always give a guaranteed legendary as a result. This essentially means people can narrow their legendary weapon rolls down to a specific weapon/armor that they'll actually use instead of rolling through hundreds of useless rolling pins or pipe pistols, with the only limit being your daily scrip acquisition rate. It helps that the craftable legendaries are pretty good aside from the cattleprod/gauntlet (though they still get use considering they're a guaranteed legendary).
---
TL;DR do quest, max rep, get bullion, buy plans, get scrip, build legendaries
---
I have yet to not get my daily challenges and duping doesn’t really bother me one way or the other.
---
It's disabled because it can be used to dismount you under the terrain making you unkillable.
---
this is why I always make a mad dash for the vendor upon fast travelling
---
Ackshually, the note was left by raiders. The Blood Eagles to be precise.
---
I jumped on a hill but the hill was steep and my jetpack glitched and shot me upwards. Rip knees
---
I play using my phone internet and it works just fine
---
Oh wow i wanted to make a village like in fo4....this is dissapointing.
---
It's been bugged for a bit and all the holiday awards are back available.  Got a few skins myself when the weekly challenge told me I needed to do NW.
---
He could rip the shit out of us for keeping him as a slave against his will
---
His PSN: killerkeys223
---
Can’t relate
---
When you take a workshop, it gives you an amount of materials to build with for free (when you’re building, you’ll see numbers in green for the materials needed to build something), This way you don’t lose materials unless you exceed the free stuff.
---
I agree!!
---
&gt;you’re increasing her health bar by quite a bit more than that just by being there.
---
This is bullshit and always has been.
---
I always keep a shitty weapon on me so when legends spawn I don't accidentally one shot it. I was doing lin ein the sand yesterday when we had them all spawning in the middle, and normally I do like 1 shot of an explosive shotgun to hit a bunch and let everyvbody else come in on them. One guy had an explosive minigun and would literally kill the wave instantly. If everyone didin't right away, they would be dead. A lot of the people in the event just started running around, because there was no way. It makes me kinda disappointed in high level players when they have a winner take all strategy.
---
I still get those rewards from before when I play NW. I wasn’t sure if it was limited time or not but who’s complaining? At this point nothing is “rare” in FO76’s economy.
---
Lucky, wish I had that glitch to go with my RNG failures.
---
Or expand what we can groe, IDC which.
---
The problem is lack of Communication . 
---
This game really needs text chat for group organizing and even for selling/buying/trading
---
Suddenly I feel like a better person.  Thanks OP!
---
I'll add props to the guys who shiskebab heal the friendly NPC's.
---
With bloodied at 20% all 9 ranks of heavy weapons damage and high speed barrels and bloody mess, I do approximately 20 damage per shot at over 200 fire rate. She melts pretty quick, but she is still a tank. That's in her face as well, so no distance damage drop off
---
Someone dropped a bag of mounted head plans in my camp one day. I can look and see what extras i have left. It was 3-5 of each
---
I have no clue
---
Yeah I liked grouping before the update but I don't want to constantly follow you around sometimes I just want to wander off and do my own thing and we can meet back up at some event later on.
---
P.S nobody joins my god damn building group its always event farming gypsies
---
Scrapper and scrap all weapons and armor and in no time you'll have more steel then you need.
---
You dont, you just cut your losses and leave.  In my experience no one really fights you over it unless that specific one is up for a daily challenge.  I think i saw that once.
---
But in general, most workshops are just not very good.
---
Though I should also point out that pvp builds will step on you regardless of level if you yourself are not specced out for pvp and kitted well.
---
What primary weapons do you use?
---
My question, and maybe somebody might know the math on this, but did those 9 challenges add up to what 7 normally are?  Maybe there were 9 challenges but the same total amount of Score up for grabs as 7?  I just don’t know as I never bothered to take note of each challenge value.
---
That is what I do too.  Herd them up until they are like 50yds from the corral and then let them finish on their own.  I usually always get a hit or two on the sheepquatch.
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away.
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod.
---

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds.
---
Also. WELCOME!
---
It isnt your zone, it's not like your camp, so no point in trying to pretty it up it will only ever be temporary. That being said workshops have resources tied to them for you to build with that dont take out of your own resources until you use them up
---
You realize they haven’t fought yet? FO2 is still waaay off
---
You still can, you can make buildings and then blueprint them, and then next time you log on, retake the workshop and use the blueprints to Put the buildings back. It gives you some free materials so you don’t really lose out on anything
---
But perhaps a better option if you wanted to make a small settlement is to find one of the areas in the world where Settlers spawn and build your camp there.  You can also get an ally for your camp, and if you earn enough atoms get the scavenger robot.  Might be more of an outpost but can still be pretty nice.
---
I use my bloodied 10mm submachine gun with exploding bullets and a bloodied 50. Cal machine gun, but i got no ammo for the 50 cal
---
Follow your opening missions, dont head to far south or east until you are atleast lvl 20.
---
Very interesting, this will prob help me save some budget. Thank you! The video has a good format but if I may leave a small suggestion since it seems you are just starting; ask for people to like/etc at the end (that is what I would do it if it was me). I get why youtubers ask, most ppl forget to like the video/whatnot so asking helps with that, but when it comes to videos (especially guides/whatnot) I think that most just want to get to the meat of the info as fast as possible and - well at least personally speaking - I do find it a tiny bit annoying when theres non-related info "blocking" what I actually want to see haha.
---
I known I'm nitpicking here but again, it is just a small suggestion. I follow other youtubers that do this and I feel that the flow of the video gets better (here's an example;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS8z4w12CEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS8z4w12CEQ) ).
---
Nice! But I don't seem to get how you get the generator into de lower part of the bench, no matter how much I try... can you explain with words if it's not much of a trouble? Thanks anyway!
---
Adjust your audio settings and set it to team. If you don't play in teams then just turn the audio off. There is a lot of bullshit out there about the queen.  There's a long running bullshit theory that having more people there increases her health and makes her harder to kill.   That is not true and it never has been.  Some people whine about others standing on fences or survival tents. They say it causes the queen to not land. The queen isn't landing because crippling perks don't work on her anymore which means you can't force her to land by crippling her.
---
Didn't know it was even a thing until today. I'm not always on this thread seeking to learn about all the new and cool bugs. I was just playing like the game has been intended.
---
U can add me. English-Jimmy, I’ll be on in around 10 minutes
---
Honestly though, I took 1 workshop every single day for about 6 months to farm xp, plans, stims etc and didn't have anyone try and claim it from me. 
---
It's part of the game, but not a popular part.
---
It converts ammo
---
Ok but what do you got to build ?
---
Yeah there cant, thats why they tag it with the "NW" for Not Worth(it)
---
On private servers constantly?
---
It's manslaughter
---
He is so damn squishy.  I try to shoot the floor near him with an explosive smg, but I still probably do too much damage.  If I accidentally hit him he is toast.  Best bet is do OVN on a team.
---
Yes, score is tied to account, so any character you use gets you points towards SCORE
---
All well and good until the cows die because everyone ran to the sheepsquatch and forgot the swarms attacking the cows!
---
I've heard that you can wear the full SS armor in a nuke zone and it's like wearing PA. I haven't had a chance to test this theory however.
---
Yes I play on my low level to get the level up challenge and do the rest on main.
---
Yeah. Some challenges are different though on lower levels. I think they may have removed the level up.
---
I use a two shot recoil compensated explosive pump action shotgun. I one shot everything lol
---
Good thing I didn't already mention that or anything.
---
Any weapon receives a boost from a bloodied build.  The only two things you really need are Adrenal Reaction Mutation and Nerd Rage 3 perk card.  
---
Beyond that, 5 pieces of Unyeilding armor (1 piece needs AP refresh), Serendipity 3, Radicool.  
---
Get as many points into luck and agility as you can.  Lots of good perks there for your build.  
---
By carefully selecting mutations, you can bypass Class Freak, it isn’t important for this build.
---
Hi there.  I forgot to check my ap before jet packing over prime and fell right in.
---
Renounce your faith and accept Todd Howard as your true Christ
---
Whenever I’m soloing the event I just kill the sheepsquatch in like two seconds, but with others I wait till he’s mutated and half way then do my thing
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
---
They're all the same. My Mrs has just started on Xbox with game pass and the challenges are the same for me and her across platforms also.
---
Ok I’ve sent a request
---
This works!!!
---
I missed 1800 gold. If I only had known earlier!
---
Edit: Asked her 1 question and sold her a junk item. (May not be required) Then I talked to Smiley -&gt; Gold
---
Fuck dude that’s like nuclear fire
---
I’ve soloed it hundreds of times and the cows are fine by the time the enemy falls, if not then protect the cows and gets some shots on the beast enough to get awarded credit then protect the cows
---
I had someone about to give me the tadpole backpack and my F ing internet died and logged me out.
---
YES! I'm not the only one!!!!
---
Ah interesting, I assume it's similar the the glitch camps I see in Adventure that use an instrument?
---
(I guess that means they're also disabled in NW)
---
I would loot as much steal, lead, and gunpowder (or acid and cloth to make gunpowder). Then craft your own ammo. I don't buy ammo unless it's an emergency.
---
Use ammosmith perk of you have it. Right now I can craft 140 rounds of 50 cal at once for my Final Word.
---
You could run through somewhere like Pleasant Valley Cabins, and pick up 9 tin can chimes (that's like 80 lead and a 160 steel), plus all the guns from the low level scorched. You will have materials to craft your own ammo in no time.
---
Edit: and server hop pleasant valley to get more.
---
Well, we all know Bethesda isn't going to fix it. If for some reason you feel the need to whine about it every chance you get, well then you do you I suppose.
---
I've seen particularly with line in the sand that when some one tries to be cheeky and go to where they spawn, the entire spawn of scorched just spawns at the opposite side.  Not sure if intentional or just luck.
---
Ie, someone goes to the right side and they all spawn at the gate.  Go to the left side and they all spawn at the hole in the wall on the right.
---
I have only seen the legendary spawn at bravo, correct? If you hear the terminated employee announcements AND I wave and no one shows? I’m not waiting all day or bring him to you.
---
They used to drop from Enclave events in the beginning but for some reason they changed them to a rare event drop. I used to just drop them on the ground after the events because they were so common. Now I wish I would have saved them.
---
Either or private just look at the map youll see people chilling by the train stations mainly white springs
---
My friend uses like a crafted normal shotgun 😂
---
Both the Christmas and Halloween challenges are currently unlocked. 
---
The Christmas one seems to reset your challenge based xp each time. The halloween one is accumulative.
---
Damn. I'm dreading logging in now. Hang in there man. ☺
---
I have to carry a secondary weapon when XP farming with my buddies because I one shot everything, my shotgun is a little OP lol. I just hit level 104, been a shotty build since level 40ish. Shotguns + VATS rips. Lol it's my favorite. Have to practice my aim in NW though 😂😂
---
Happy to help :-)
---
Have no idea. Thats a new addition to the calculator. Propably something to do with the extra challenges we got on weekend (9 instead of normal 7). Most likely the creator will update the calculator as it seems those extra ones will be enebled on weekend. We have to wait and see.
---
You cannot seriously believe this can you?
---
I have a two-shot mirved Fatman with faster reload. I take all the nukes I can find.
---
I have no idea what any of this means lol
---
This is why I never got one.  I love the idea but even just shopping at some camps it gets annoying so I can only imagine if it was at my camp.
---
Maybe they will add a sound option in the controls to make it work but shut up.
---
Yeah, good thing.
---
Me, like most people see a topic and then once clicked don't read the whole paragraph. 
---
Now, I did.
---
Yooooooo where'd you get that Vampires shotgun? 👀👀👀
---
I fear cliff camps. Half the time even just fast traveling to one sees me fall. That said, so far though it hasn't actually killed me which is surprising. Still some times I put on PA before shopping just in case.
---
I'll be on in a few hours. You can check out my camps if you'd like. I have one on a bridge, a small puzzle type one, and a movie theater.
---
score bug is unacceptable, more because it's an old bug, never fixed... shame.
---
But for the dupe...
---
Atleast give the option to mute them. 
---
For the scraptron, just have a "silent subroutine" so we don't have to hear it. 
---
For allies, just have a dialogue option where you ask them to Keep it down.
---
Yesterday i had 2 different challenges on my 25 to what i had on my 235. One of them was use photomode in a group. 
---
And other people have posted about daily challenges and i've been like 'I don't have that' Like kill 10 robots.
---
It might not be every single day.
---
Fuck those guys. They should helping you and letting you "leach" if needed. If those guys can't solo the queen they probably needed your help anyways. 
---
I had a character named "Knights Quest" or something similar, pop up on my team. He proceeded to follow me everywhere and play the role of a companion (like dogmeat). He was a level 76 Im a level 338, so while he was playing the role perfectly (complete Grognack costume and axe) I would let him leach off all my kills because why not. It doesn't hurt me at all and he gets points to rank up. Hopefully he does the same. And I imagine he does. Fun encounter, if your out there thank you.
---
I am a member of that illustrious club lol.
---
I swear I pressed the button to jump 😂
---
I just sell them to vendors or drop them at train stations. I see lots of potential issues with accidentally scrapping weapons I use and I really don’t want that to happen with legendaries..it’s bad enough if you scrap a rare clothing item accidentally.
---
If I'm being completely honest I have absolutely zero idea hahah. Ive had it for well over a year. It's only level 45, but it's utterly broken.
---
it's more active at night
---
Workshops were made specifically with PvP as the main focus. You can look up farming guides or figure it out yourself, but just going out in the world to get what you need will always get you more of that material and in shorter time than what the workshops can provide. 
---
Now if you’re going around doing quests then yeah, workshops can be nice to have so you have a little something extra to take. 
---
But again, they were made for PvP areas. Generally, if you have one people will just leave you alone with it. When I’m in the mood to take one though, I don’t just barge in. I’ll see who owns in and look around on the map for them. If they’re under level 50 I know it probably won’t be fair and I’ll let them keep it. But level 50+ is fair game for me. If you don’t want your junk stolen when you die, you shouldn’t be carrying any on you unless you’re going to your stash box.
---
Well that's just fucking stupid.
---
That’s really cool!
---
Aye I'd appreciate it thanks!
---
Don't be afraid of high level events, you'll definitely die but there's very little penalty to dying just take shots at as many creatures as you can during group events. Lots of people can 1shot them so if you get a little damage in on it you'll get the XP for it and the loot. Molotovs are best for tagging a group of enemy's or any grenades will do. You want that xp and loot, you also wanna scrap all weapons you aren't using for mods and scrap. Good luck bud!
---
Ah ok I probably won’t be on but if I am I will say
---
Thank you for the advice, I like all the advice I can get 👍.  I will take a look at the video after
---
RE: #4 (Semi-Naked Beckett at my camp) -- In Fallout 4 most of my settlers were dressed as Spartans (red undies and capes for the men, red bikinis for the women).   Until they release similar outfits in the Atomic shop, tighty whities for Beckett will have to do
---
you may like stealth boys and melee weapons
---
You need to go back to the history for this game.  
---
They wanted to originally make a “survival-lite” game with elements of PVP actions.  At the start, we had “slap damage” any player could come up to you and hit you and you’d take a small amount of damage. They could even kill you this way (and they would become wanted).  
---
Overtime though, people requested more and more of the PVP features be removed or toned down. 
---
Workshops however, have been left as is, they are the bastion for PVP.  I think that’s fine, PVPers need some sort of battleground (And nuclear winter doesn’t count)
---
They use a lot of daytime lighting that makes everything look washed out and ugly, especially in The Forest and Savage Divide, which unfortunately are both places we tend to spend a lot of time in (Cranberry Bog can also suffer from this but I find it doesn't look as bad there).
---
It's one of my biggest issues with the visuals in this game, and one of the reasons why virtually all of my camp screenshots I share are taken at night. Daytime light = ugly light that makes textures, especially nature, look terrible.
---
Toxic Valley and Ash Heap and The Mire all have pretty amazing lighting though. Ash Heap's effect is probably the most immersive.
---
What platform? I have been unable to keep any significant quantity nuke keycards for queen fights because they are so difficult to find. I assume what is happening is people are farming flux on private worlds as the price of a single keycard has gone up from 150/ea to over 500/ea and even then I cant find many of them.
---
Beckett says Hi.

You do you man. Don’t let some whiny bitch tell you where you can and can’t be.  Go in with a rolling pin for all I care, have some fun. You have just as much a right to be there than some douchenozzle that doesn’t even have the right information anyway.
---
I am no longer allowed to use weapons that have EXPLOSIVE anywhere in it's name/make up....Because my friends are tired of reviving me. I have killed my own self with my own gun more than any other mob in this game. TALENT!
---
HA. nice
---
No idea. I'm level 140 on PS4 and my mrs has been playing since Thursday on xbox and she's only just reached level 12. Every day it's been the same challenges for both of us. Bizarre.
---
Just a joke
---
I’m selling toilet paper, surgical masks, and antiseptic at 2020 caps in one of my vendors. Alongside a 30000 cap clown hat. 
---
Someone actually bought a toilet paper from me a couple days ago. Must have appreciated the joke.
---
Brilliant idea!  Take my upvote.
---
Ive been on all weekend and had 2 nukes dropped during the entire weekend. Sat on my porch in a rocking chair as someone shot down nuclear key card bot in my front yard. Cards are being gathered but not used?
---
Went to a player camp and was greeted by a giant wall, with a giant arrow pointing down with the words "Cook" on the wall. I saw the cooking pot half in and half out of the wall. I knew it was a trap, but then I thought "it's probably one of those hidden camps you have to do something to get into" and did what it asked. Right before my character glitched inside the wall, I saw the stacks of spike boards that I was going to die from once I stopped cooking. Always trust your gut lol
---
Actual simpleton? Why wouldn't you want an action survival game to be a challenge?
---
Except you can.
---
I'd rather do sbq with a 25 who can do enough damage than the 300+ running a bloodied melee build whining about how she won't land because were on the bunker
---
I'm hoping with the launch of score for atoms tomorrow they'll make some gesture to make it up to people,  but im not holding my breathe.
---
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
It happened AGAIN 🤦‍♀️
---
Through the game or are you talking about changing files
---
That wasn’t your point at all. Anyway. Thanks for trying. Cya.
---
Thanks so much, I cant wait to try this one!
---
Happened to me again last night I'm glad I'm not the only one. Its just nuts it's happened twice in a week!
---
Please fix it so I don’t see the same damn post every afternoon.
---
I apologise I should if added that into the video. So when you build a camp, depending where you are building some places have bits of ground where items sink into the ground &amp; what happens mostly in these areas if you place something on top and click so the bottom item like my weapon work bench is sinking in a little the the top items will sink into the bottom one. If this don’t make sense I could try and get a video done for you with explaining at the same time but probably won’t be able to do it till tomorrow
---
Some people have suggested "Tip jars" for camps, where you could leave a few caps .  There's also been a suggestion for a "guest book" which I think would be awesome, even if it only had a few possible comments to pick between (because plain text entries are sure to be abused).   
---
Guest Book possible entries:  
---
1.  Great camp!    
---
2.  Architectural award!  
---
3.  Your Camp Hurts My Eyes!  
---
4.  Great use of items!  
---
5.  Loved shopping here!
---
That isn't always it. I hadn't logged at all yesterday until around 5pm as I work all day. 5 of the 9 were already completed. With a 2/2 challenge at 1/2 completion.
---
Blueprint items (single or small groups) you would like to place under stairs or areas that make them POP up on top of things. You can then place them from their blueprint usually without issue. Blueprints are magical!
---
ETA: No rugs needed and no slight to those that use them, rugs are magical too! (I'm overly concerned with budget lol)
---
If you want me to make you some things which will help you starting out and make your life a little easier drop me a message on XBL, my GT is P34K3
---
Good lord! Well isn’t that an annoying bug!! 😅
---
I've never encountered that bug. Usually for me its a walk slow af like I'm over weight and out of ap. Then it gets normal. Highly annoying in nukenzones.
---
Raced a friend down a mountain, forgot I took off goat legs and was wearing my hazmat suit, I forget why for both but it was great
---
&gt;ve to stop at very camp and rate them. 
---
What platform?
---
Maybe MODUS will have some dialogue concerning the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave doesn't have to show up like the BOS will. 
---
It is just an introduction quest for the BOS to come back. Bethesda could always add in doing Enclave missions against them. 
---
Maybe sometime in the future have the Enclave contact you from the West Coast or DC and you help establish them into the Whitespring Bunker again. Then you choose like with the Settler or Raider faction.
---
I wish game randomly gave people tasks for  radiation rumble or shared exp from slayed enemies, for me its either collect and win the event without exp and legendary or don't collect like the rest and fail eventually. Thats why once a while I start on my own just for exp from ghouls until I fail =)
---
Any build set you could one shot anything tbh 
---
The dupe was ment to crash market also the people that sell the legacy weapons for like $300 dollars are no longer getting that now it crashed their market too :p I think I know what Bethesda is doing
---
For you but it's a player solution and not a solution to locking items. I have specific things I favorite for specific reasons. That is not a fix. Also, why not get legendary scrap? You think a legendary deathclaw would get you different scrap then a non-legendary? I doubt it, this whole idea is pointless. And that other 10% it fails maybe something you didn't want to scrap. Nope.
---
really? what is a nuke card worth?
---
Yes, rewards are account wide (besides consumable items like lunchboxes or currency such as gold). Claim consumables and currency on the character you want, but you can earn them on any character.
---
Idk why this guy got downvoted. But, this is some really good advice.
---
The only extra thing I can add is to also invest in some INT perks early on (Makeshift Warrior if you're a melee build, or Gunsmith if you're ranged.)
---
So it IS still possible just super rare?
---
Im on xbox same gt as here. They were popular but been moving around so much my vendor is idle most of the time. Been building camps to extremes. 8 stories high or 9x9 footprints BIG buildings lol. So get distracted
---
Been around forever! I hate it too, start a queen then get stuck unable to spawn....
---
If on Xbox or PC, the servers have been filled with new low level players since it released on GamePass. I think this spread the higher level folks out among the public servers so not as much activity with the harder events like Encryptid and no nuke launches.
---
Lol. Raaaage.
---
Cool, thanks for the info. Was worried there was a secret 500 SCORE I was missing out on haha
---
Oh, ok. It was that, then, I was trying to do it in the second floor of my CAMP. I hope there is some terrain like that in my build area. Thanks a lot!
---
It's a mining helmet with an SS skin. That's all.
---
Huh. I've never experienced it. Sorry about your luck
---
Dang I'm sorry to know your friend got ripped off twice. Honestly I wish the community would also talk about the ugly side of this community more often instead of just the positives.
---
Ok, that's some funny shit. For just surviving the waves and waves of high level adds you deserve to get rewarded.
---
Can confirm, as long as you hold the trigger, you cannot die. Well, maybe to imposter, but only if he is able to unload the full laser straight to your face, yea that will melt anything...
---
He pays his sub, so why can’t he enjoy the game to its fullest? High level players don’t own the scorched earth event and can’t dictate who joins it.
---
Explore. 
---
Use junk to repair broken gear at workbenches. 
---
Use level appropriate weapons and armor. 
---
Use melee weapons to conserve ammo. 
---
Try and have fun and don’t overthink it. Don’t rush to have the best gear, that will come.
---
Scrap and store junk regularly. 
---
Make healing salves along the River.
---
The polite and decent thing to do is let them play and enjoy the event.
---
You are obviously not a parent.  You don't discourage your children from walking just because they are not good at it.  You slow down, hold their hand and help them get better.
---
Yeah, right now I’m at level 57
---
Really? It always happens to me.
---
That Gun.
---
It wasn't until reading this I realised... The Dunwich Company is oddly absent in 76.
---
So, adding an event based around one of their locations would be really cool.
---
Yeah you will need to sink it 1st then move it to where you want it. Don’t forget to link the wire up with the generator 1st b4 you sink it 👍.
---
Drop your survival tent in just the right place and they all drop out of thin air in front of the sonic gizmo.
---
That came as a surprise the first time I saw it
---
Cities are reopening. People are going back to work.
---
The player killerkeys223 also was gloating near the end that he ripped off another player.
---
These solutions work to prevent people from scrapping critically important items.  Between the two it works 100% of the time.  I have managed to keep my DCG for 300 levels and over a year just by favoriting it.  
---
Your entire reply seems to miss the problem being addressed which was how to prevent accidentally scrapping important items.
---
Through the config file. And by just taking the quickest look ever in the world at OP’s picture, you can see that they’re on PC.
---
Stupid sexy mothman!
---
Nikola Tesla would be proud.
---
I've seen that but I'm not paying for first so it's a no go.
---
Nah that's just the luck of people doing it maybe the 25 people on your server are either nubs or just dont want to drop a nuke, I had a the same guy on my server drop 3 in a row, try to join servers with high level players on it ,its obv if your on a lvl full of 50 and less the chances of someone dropping a nuke are low
---
They may have added a lot to anticipate volume thats not there. Thats pretty much what im seeing too. Just watered down the player pool. It was like a switch so your probably correct that they added servers and just spread us real thin.
---
There are only 24 people on any server at any time. 
---
If you aren’t seeing camps, it’s probably because of all the low level players who don’t have vendors set up yet.
---
Her health is static, the mobs are all that change. That advice is just wrong. So, so wrong.
---
Dupes  have been around since the game released
---
Seems to me it is more active than before seasons.
---
HA.  Nice?
---
This is exactly what I do. 
---
It works pretty well
---
Haha I should hope so 😂
---
Yes, it is a rare drop for Savage Divide events. You get both scout masks and 3 jumpsuits. My buddy got lucky and had it drop from Uranium Fever. I've also seen it drop from Always Vigilant.
---
Wouldn't their life be so much easier if they just communicated with the community? Someone should just tweet these changes. Takes literally 15 second.
---
The option within 'REPAIR/MODIFY' to scrap is 'greyed-out' for Legendarys iirc
---
Didn't think about that, Really good solution since i don't want missle or railway spikes, But they would need to add fusion cores to the converter or still reward them from certain quests/events
---
Then....go play it? I don’t understand why people like you have to constantly belittle NW and anyone who enjoys it every chance you get. I think TF2 is vastly superior than Overwatch, but I don’t trash Overwatch or it’s playerbase. People like Nuclear Winter. You aren’t a gatekeeper that gets to tell people what is and isn’t good based on your opinion. Get over it.
---
You'll want to use a gun or melee weapon and fight back. When you take a workshop you're agreeing to PVP. It says so on the screen when you claim it. You can't hog all those resources without some risk.
---
Levels don't mean nearly as much as the build. After about level 50 there's not much difference. You can hold your own just fine at level 17 against most players unless they're PVP focused. It's fun and most people who contest your workshop are just looking for a few rounds and some GGs. Many, like me, will just leave you with your workshop after the fight.
---
Anyway, don't take workshops if you want to build nice things. That's what your camp is for.
---
No worries hope your able to do it mate.
---
Used their customer service chat, or call them.
---
I cant believe this post got over 100 upvotes thanks everyone. Do we think this has something to do woth one of the most recent updates
---
I just move a couple feet away and it usually works. I'll try this next time.
---
Good tip is to whip out your camera, walk around until the name pops up in text, then you know exactly where to look :-)
---
I get about 15 rads a second - with rad shield it lowers to about 10. Still hard to deal with unless you bunch up and share rad sponge.
---
Looking at stories like this, probably it was for the best that the first thing I did was to disable voice chat. They can't talk shit to you if they can't talk to you at all.
---
Sucks that it happens to you, but it hasn’t happened to me. The only annoying respawn I get is when I’m doing scorched earth and get forced to respawn in the nuke zone. But that’s it.
---
Nice way to trick people into getting blown up haha
---
Probably should submit this to one of the wiki pages about fo76.
---
It will greatly help a lot of people.
---
There’s no accounting for taste.
---
The ease of moving is a big part if it for many.  It doesn't really bother me that people mount houses on top of stairs.  I went the alternative approach and used prefabs for my main buildings.  They are easy to place and it only takes me 15 minutes to move and set it all back up again.
---
Yes but take note.of which character you're on when you claim some of the rewards as they are character bound.
---
It happens to me exclusively during scorched earth  and encryptid only.  Though I guess those are the only events I die in.  The latency hits and the game forgets that I have 2 whole hotkeys for stims.  It has not happened to me recently, but it's probably just luck on my part.
---
Tough skin: if you can endure that insult, you can endure anything. +5 dr for 30 min.
---
Flame retardant: you are immune to sick burns. +10 fire resist for 30 min
---
Was just spoiled by it raining nukes for so long. Would look like a pile of hoola hoops in the corner of the map. Now its like the early days when a nuke was something to see. Im hopping around all the time just teal unlucky i guess.
---
I created a ticket and it took about a month to be resolved. I did however reply to it requesting an update ever 4-5 days until I got one.
---
Spawned under the SBQ.
---
I just put them in my vendor at 10 caps a piece regardless of their charge level, they always get snatched up. I keep a few for my excavator PA for lead runs in the Lucky Hole mine. Otherwise I'm running DR 550+ ER 647 RR 287 with SS armor. No need for PA when my jetpack doesn't need cores and I've got Chinese armor for nuke zones.
---
it takes more than 1.5 years to fix that, they are clearly not able to to it.
---
They completly changed the system and the bug is always here.
---
This game pass is THE showcase of the game actually, and it's broken... AND THEY CAN'T give you'r points back !!!
---
You pay the game, play an awfull grind, get no reward, lose time and effort. they can't change that, and it's a bullshit ticket ?
---
(and they said the grind will change, will be so more fun... It's the exact same dailys as we had before...)
---
I just want to know what's a "legit ticket" for you ?...
---
Its still a joke that some weapons have multiple skins, then weapons like the combat rifle/fixer are (as far as im aware) only getting their first skin within the Legendary run.
---
Power plant has bloat flies too
---
Completely agree. I’m a solo player that likes team buffs
---
Best note in the game.  I can never get enough of them.
---
Theres people on the servers all weekend just not launching nukes. Someone mentioned the pc and xbox sales that had probably watered down the servers withs newbs. Seems plausible.
---
I don't sell flux, and you're doing something very, very wrong if you spend that much ammo on a queen even solo and especially if you're using ultracite rounds, plus even if you do spend more than you get, that's not a flaw, you don't have to fight the queen for flux, you're choosing the option that has you spend a lot more ammo.
---
They're buying it for the convenience, which is good because it pushes the mechanic of a market of supply and demand, if you auto generate flux, you remove that part of the market.
---
Looks like a nuke to me.
---
In the past they hit accounts that had multiple of the same item..I'm sure if they are banning they're probably using the same method but honestly it just looks like temp bans
---
No vegan diet NO VEGAN POWERS!
---
Depends which one. The regular one probably can get tedious. Communist bot just makes me laugh even though they are just repeating the same things. Owning a Fascnacht bot I would liken to waterboarding yourself.
---
wouldn't be wildly surprising if at some point they added a contrary to BoS storyline for the Enclave, would be cool to see an evolving world of sorts like that
---
Are you aware that it's a perk card that everyone can use?  Yes that means you too!
---
OH GODS yeah, I've done that too. 
---
Held "E" down just a little too long while in the nuke zone that day...
---
They have a text option through the website that gets a live agent but they usually aren't much help either.
---
This.  This is why I burn through fusion cores.  That and I have hardly taken off my PA in 70 levels.
---
Are you getting the workshops and camps confused? Your camp is yours alone. You can build whatever you want there wherever in west Virginia. The only time another player can attack your camp is if you initiate pvp with them, and even then if they destroy something in your camp, you can repair it. Its not gone forever. Your camp is like the settlements in FO4. The workshops are just for gathering resources and not for a long term camp
---
Same happens to me since I traded my unyielding set.think its weight related
---
After the double XP and double score weekends, I'm betting people will be done with the season after that. I'm stashing my atoms I earn to buy how ever many levels I need to buy at the end. So far with the atoms that are coming, I can buy the last 14 ranks.
---
DO NOT buy ranks until you know you can buy your way to the end. You don't want to get stuck having to grind the ranks with the highest score requirements.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
My Mrs has just started playing on Xbox and that was my advice to her, to throw herself into events. Y'know what though, Xbox seems DEAD in events. Maybe because of the influx in new players, but every event that pops up has noone doing it lol.
---
i understand that, but for scrapping atomic shop painted items WITHOUT legendary modifications the only way to scrap them is through the REPAIR/MODIFY menu.
---
As someone mentioned the added new players hav watered down the base on pc xbox with new players. That’s exactly what im running into all the time now. Sub 100s everywhere in groups. Give em a week or two and they will get launching lol.
---
I think a lot of this mindset comes from people thinking that the queen's health and the mobs scale with the number of players present. This has been thoroughly debunked. I'd much rather have people standing around doing nothing than interfering with my progress on the event or one-shotting everything. Leechers don't have any effect on my earned XP or rewards so I couldn't care less and neither should anyone else.
---
Heard a quote one time: 'The only time you should look in your neighbor's bowl is to see if they got enough food to eat.'
---
Even still, you won't insta-die. I can last a second or two with the trigger down
---
Ya, a part of me misses lone wanderer but it feels almost outmoded now.
---
So, I've found myself shooting at things at point blank range with my explosive minigun and have noticed that I'm NOT blowing myself to hell and back. 
---
Does pacifist mode work on you as well?
---
Idk maybe the update made it worse has anyone elce noticed the workshops are f***** as well?
---
Yes, I don’t want to help them either. Although, I’d like to infiltrate their ranks then completely ruin them in the end.
---
Ahhh, i get you, thanks for that :)
---
I do think it's a good idea to loot quickly because the body sometimes gets thrown in the explosion and thus hard to find, but I've never seen it despawn.
---
Also adds stop spawning when the Imposter is dead.  There are often a bunch hanging around after the fight because they collect in a diff area.
---
Thanks :D! I have to admit the salt one is just for the laughs.
---
The idea was to add a use for the cans and jars found around. 
---
Got to say as well for stating my method was overly complicated. Your method also includes 5 steps. Just worded slightly different.
---
If it's on a public server than they need to accept that anyone can join, if they just want their team on it then they need to move it to a private world.
---
Next time just spam the heart emote right at them and maybe drop the "You've been insulted" note or a single salt
---
Honestly, this dupe helps Bethesda.  It will let them fix legacies and make them not absurdly OP without everyone going apeshit.  The high end trading market and the items for real $ took a hit that will come close to killing them.
---
Their loss thats a good amount of acid
---
I generally just claim a workshop; get the award.  Go to another area.  Wait for the retake event.  Retake and get an additional award.  I don’t bother actually building them up.  Perhaps once permanent workshops come into play?  Not sure how that will work as I’m sure everyone will want to build on one
---
I’ve never heard of this plan so for a plan I’ve never heard of 250 caps is not bad
---
I mean I play TF2 but still do PvP in adventure. Am I a bad person? Am I a scumbag that deserves to have my build and/or gear nerfed so I don’t “have fun”? Should I get reported for taking workshops? Reported for fighting other people? Reported for killing someone that shot first? What’s up with the gatekeeping, man? Let people enjoy the game the way they want to.
---
I cant believe I sold the ones I had...regret bigtime...would gladly trade a be combat shotgun and a b33fmswa combat rifle!lmk !
---
No, but explosive minigun deals only 20% damage per bullet as explosion effect. Gatling Plasma deals 100%, they never nerfed it as they did with ballistic weapons.
---
n0x630
---
Dude I’ve resorted to firing in short bursts letting the health bar stabilize and hitting it again. Haven’t run into the bug since. I run a bloodied .50 ffr and a bloodied .50 ffr explosive.
---
Both guns are devastating, lvl 85 SB on the ground lasts a few seconds if it doesn’t bug out.
---
I think they have some kind of anti cheat code that limits the amount of dmg any single person can deal within a specified amount of time. Would be nice if they could fix that code to reflect the high amount of damage that can be dealt at this point. I know I have invested a lot of time in building out my character, and it sucks that I still have to hold back just so I can play the game.
---
You're not wrong, but neither am I. It's a tricky situation since the body can vanish so quickly. I usually get blown up multiple times during that event anyway lol.
---
I believe you got an extra 500 score from them
---
They slow enemies for 8 sec
---
For anyone wondering: don't be on for reset time (I stay clear by a half hour on each side), and DON'T let the last mode you played before the reset be NW, both of those will auto-complete challenges.
---
But I dont wanna be judge Judy and executioner!
---
Which rewards are character bound?
---
Edit: I’m only worried about cosmetic and camp items. Those are account wide right?  Just consumables probably aren’t right?
---
Its from project paradise
---
No problem, if your on PC and ever see Skiddish Deer's C.A.M.P. swing by and if i'm there id be glad to give some handouts :)
---
You’ve seen the interface on the ammo converter...and the new Legendary perk card coin system...and you expect Bethesda to make ANYTHING that’s not a complete and utter shitfuck of a grind?!?
---
I think I’m gonna have a stroke from laughing. 🤣
---
From what I've noticed, caps are not taken. The popup comes up with the confirm, but that's all. Not even the caps/coin jingle plays when confirming.
---
This just happened to me. I felt like I'd missed out on my first time... I know some people may feel like it's over, but I wasn't even present for a milestone!
---
So I understand. Are you on PS4?
---
&gt; I do think it's a good idea to loot quickly because the body sometimes gets thrown in the explosion and thus hard to find, but I've never seen it despawn.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, I never considered this. Like you say it's still helpful to not wait to loot it. I'll try out the camera trick next time and see if I can find the body after the explosion.
---
Right, that's a VATS universal issue.
---
Gauss rifles, bows, compound bows, gauss pistols, and gauss shotguns all share an issue where the first shot fired in VATS has a 100% chance of missing if you don't exit and reenter VATS(and with bows/compound bows it also causes your arrows to curve around your target).
---
Lever action rifles aren't affected by the separate issue the above listed weapons are.
---
This "bad VATS" thing can be dealt with the same way: exit and reenter VATS. Takes about the same amount of time as firing until it wears off(for automatic guns) and has the bonuses of saving ammo and not drawing attention to your location.
---
The meditation event is also a good place.
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge.
---
Damn yea I just offered a 3 star  Bffr combat shotgun for one and got no answer
---
Yeah this has been happening a lot lately
---
Thats Mr. Veteranarian 😁 he's the best Mr. Handy Bot encounter.
---
"yes".
---
it's really easy to get for high level. but some abuse and it goes for high prices.
---
aktos plan project paradise event drop
---
exactly
---
perfect response to this type of statement
---
I live in central Canada the reset is 10 am my time usually , im at work during the week so ive never ran into the issue at all or paid attention to the reset times.
---
then saturday morning i got hit with it , without any knowledge the reset was happening as i had beat my challenges the evening before.
---
boom lost my score for the day.
---
I stand with you brother.
---
Hey I'm seeing this post is receiving a lot of attention so I'll tag some community managers to see if they like the idea too c:
---
u/Ladydevann
---
u/Valseek
---
Even servers with camp vendors all over its quiet. People but not sb queens or nukes of any kind. Must just be influx of new players watering down the pool.
---
fire solves all problems
---
I still carry the Daisy Cutter for when I get awarded random mini nukes. Its fun to erase some scorched every once in a while.
---
It must be a bug. It counted as complete for my gf. But it didn’t count for my friend.
---
Wish i had know i would have logged off.
---
Im sure they will get around to fixing it... in season 2
---
Or, we could have a single consequence for death in a game that punishes you in no other way for dying. Gonna sound like a dick, but it’s your fault for falling in the fissure and/or carrying your stuff on you.
---
Careful or you may be funny
---
It's when you swap servers (including when you can't place your camp and have to choose another).   I'd you close and reopen it should be fine.
---
Wait plans are dupeable as well
---
&gt; Then....go play it?
---
No thanks, i play fo76 for what it was advertised and sold, for the open world survival game. NW = Trash buggy mess.
---
They can be duplicated like anything else, they'll be less rare now :-)
---
Sorry just saw this was finnishing an event. Looking forward to seeing your camp and doing some shopping thanks.
---
I'm on now, or just reply whenever your on. My name is the same as well.
---
Yep. Yep.
---
Well, there was a good volume of new players on the servers I was on this weekend. I interacted with quite a few giving out stimpacks and junk plans. You can generally spot them easily around the Wayward. Last weekend, on the other hand was hopping as there was a lot of activity with the release of the Legendary Run.
---
Several people here have stated this is a myth.
---
Insane how people spend $300 for an be gat plas 
---
Now their worth 10-30 bucks😂
---
I think Bethesda wanted to crash that market
---
I don’t remember there being legendaries before FO4
---
FYI if you get one, make sure it's the urban one as you can change the paint of urban to forest back and forth for free on all of the armor and mask. You can't change the paint on the forest set.
---
This newest dupe can only duplicate items you can sell to vendors. So no, it can’t be duped with the current method afaik
---
i never said anything like that \*.\*
---
:p But yes 98%items are doooopaa now.
---
Customer support isn't able to do anything except apologize and forward to devs.
---
"We deeply apologize for any inconvenience or frustration that this causes and we thank you for your understanding.
---
Rest assured however that the information you have provided has been forwarded over to our developers to review."
---
General response for pretty much anything/everything.
---
Bethesda’s missing a huge opportunity akin to WOWs Horde Vs Alliance type of gameplay. Players throw in with a faction and have to stick to it with unique rewards and styles. Players would then have a team to stand behind and it would open up options for those guys that like to pvp so much. 
---
It always seemed like a cop out to me that we could be friendly with everyone and piss off no one. Not very RPG if you ask me.
---
That’s me.  Free Range herding and healing Brahmin.  Radiation Rumble is ores and healing those idiots.  Project Paradise running after friendly animal and healing and protecting it.  Riding Shotgun...must protect the Brahmin.  I wish we got XP credit for these things because I like doing them and they are important.  I really like the friendly nature of a lot of the interactions I have in this game.  I like that not everything is about killing.
---
I always forget the fact that bashing and throwing a life grenade are bound to the same button. Combine this with close quarters, rushing ghouls, an empty gun and panic clicking on buttons. Boom!
---
What's worse is when the space lady tells me nothing smells the same anymore
---
Absolute tosh.  SBQ health is the same no matter how many players are in attendance.
---
a second glitch that allows you to sell anything to a vendor,
---
they combine both, and tada
---
I might be wrong but I am pretty sure you get the quest if you enter a silo. All it really does is direct you were to go in silo and completes once the nuke drops.
---
LOL is that really true? I wish I encountered the insult bot more often.
---
A 3 star enemy has about a 33% chance of dropping a 1, 2, or 3 star item. No guarantees of getting a 3star item from a 3 star enemy.
---
Personally I’ve always hated the BoS. I totally agree with you that I wish there was more enclave content coming.
---
This is currently happening to me. I was online during reset. Mostly commenting to follow this, I have nothing productive to add here beyond "WHAT THE FUCK GUYZ"
---
So... Make one at your camp instead?...
---
Fair enough, comment withdrawn, sentiment remains the same. I don't care who shows up to what event
---
If I had a choice between this and have your friendly camp mates only speak once every 6 game hours I’d choose that
---
🤣🤣 that would be hilarious.
---
Being lv25 and contributing successful to the queen event means you got balls. and seem to KNOW what you are doing. cudos to u, sir. or madam. ;)
---
Rules in here are easy.
---
Rule #1: Don't be a dick.
---
Rule #2: See rule #1
---
Rule #3: See rule #1
---
Lol. I'm such an idiot.
---
Last night I was making room and I had like 40 missiles I didn't want so I dropped them along with some mini nukes. 
---
Didnt even occur to me to use the ammo converter.
---
&gt;NW = Trash buggy mess
---
If you’re really saying that specifically NW is a buggy mess, then either you have the finest tipped pen to draw the line on what counts for buggy, or you haven’t actually played this game. There’s bugs from **Skyrim** that are still in adventure mode. 
---
&gt;i play fo76 for what it was advertised and sold
---
So...you mean like in the original E3 trailer when they showed off that it was a game with PvP
---
Oh, and look at that. You also quoted me telling you to go play the 90’s tactical ops and the original Unreal. So, go play those. Like you just quoted me telling you to do.
---
They said the same about fixer plans still took me FOREVER to find
---
Look for dupes at train stations and keep it till your level 45-50 😂
---
newb question: how do i make them mutate?
---
My camp is atop a very tall cliff in savage divide. Im an uncouth savage so my camp is just a couple benches and nothing else. No wall or roof or anything.
---
One time shortly after placing it there i was crafting and was accosted by a rad scorpion. I panic escaped from my bench menu then marsupial jumped up in the air to get a couple shots off hopefully without getting meleed. I hopped up like a gracefull bunny rabit... and soared right off the cliff to my death.
---
Now my camp is on a jutting cliff slightly to the south of its former location and protected on three sides by sheer emptiness and with a wall of turrets to the front. My benches are still suicidally close to the cliff edge.
---
Last time i tried it we each split up into each section. I was on the moist radkelp with two other people, the spawns couldnt keep up so it made more sense for me to harvest while a second killed any animal spawns and the third went to help elsewhere. Me going 100% on the kelp and still only got to 2/3 for that creature. Radstag which had the most people got 3/3 and the Sludge got to 2/3. Didnt even have to use Friendly Fire with the Shishkebab to keep things alive at that point.
---
Way to miss my point entirely!  Attaboy!
---
It is kind of funny with it being a rated M title.
---
It's how I find it, works quite well..
---
definitely i got 3.5k each for the last 3 i sold
---
I agree. A lot of the FO76 community seem to want things super simple, then complain about how the game is too boring.
---
People seem to complain about there being too many currencies, but will quickly ask for generalized ammo points. They say there is too much traveling then want to just instantly TP into interiors at will.
---
Plus we already have a system like that. It's called caps. The problem is we can't sell half of the shit we find, and if we can, there is a cap limit.
---
Bethesda should have Sony offer it on PS+ one month.
---
I don't do my NW until I do my dailies. It seems this problem varies from person to person. So to be honest, I doubt anyone's solution is 100% guaranteed to work.
---
I know reading can be difficult at some points in time, but isn't rule one this?
---
**1.ALL POSTS MUST BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO FALLOUT 76**
---
All posts must be from, directly reference, or talk about something to do with Fallout 76. Before you ask, please read [this guide to returning to the game and/or if it's worth buying](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning).
---
Ok cool then it wasn’t just a score distribution tweak.
---
What do you do with the decent legendary items you don’t want? I can’t imagine scripping a 10k+ cap item.
---
Must be the influx of new players. Went from show up at any event and its crowded and a breeze to you alone getting sweaty lol.
---
Lmao, stand down, you epic gamer, you. 
---
If the RNG doesn't favor you, you won't get it until hours in. 
---
It's like the POT OF GREED! of Fo76, it feels like by far the best in slot, and like your comment suggests, there's no reason to not take it if you have access to it. Other cards are mostly situational whereas in my experience Frog Legs is great for survivability for just about any build in close combat, and is also huge for traversing the map.
---
I guess I count the unique weapons in previous fallout games as "legendary". But I don't know if they can be scrapped in the games prior to FO4 because I didn't mess around with crafting in any of them.  
---
At any rate, you can't scrap them in FO4... So I suspect *that* is why you can't in 76. Though I really don't agree with not being able to scrap them in 76, just because sometimes I'll end up with a 1 star legendary that doesn't fit my play style at all, and it's worth so little scrip that I would much rather scrap it and possibly learn a new mod for the weapon type and get scrap that I can use to craft things that are actually useful to me.
---
It's less an issue then melting the SBQ with magic/hacked weapons under a minute and ruins the event for mostly all peoples.
---
Bethesda should just add more songs period. I know that that can be hard and that they need to basically ask permission before putting music in their game, but please, Bethesda, put something in the game. They couldn’t even get the rights to use C’mon Everybody by Eddie Cochran in game, only for the Wastelanders trailer...
---
It happens from time to time.  11 scrip and 3 notes a shot, not too shabby!
---
Yup, but I don’t know why they changed it back to 7 again such a tease!
---
I was doing Ward's daily and I found the raider dead next to a turret.
---
"Haha this idoit died to a turr--"
---
I had just switched to Berserker a few days earlier and hadn't died yet...
---
"Here is your junk, now go the hell away"
---
Yup, that could be interesting.
---
The only problem is that sometimes cameras are quite janky and won’t even say what is directly in front of you.
---
Well low level players aren’t doing nukes.
---
That said, I had 3 within an hour last night.
---
Why aren’t you launching nukes?
---
Once they get to about 33% health they'll mutate and their life will regenerate to full!
---
I basically just sell magazines, bobbleheads, sometimes chems or heals, mostly plans.  The few weapons or armor I sell are generally lightweight, with the vast majority of them being 90 reduced weight, or under 5 pounds alone.  No weapon or armor stays for more than 2 weeks.  Price is halved after 1 week.  Unless I forget.
---
I was skeptical when I didn’t see a menu pop out with my choices. 
---
......
---
I keep checking out of habit and disbelief lol
---
That doesn’t seem to guarantee it so don’t feel too bad.
---
ty again!
---
I could move the entire building anywhere if I move my camp,right?
---
Also in the future,do you think it could be estetically nice to have the house with only 2 floors,and a tower at best for extra height?
---
OMG yes! 😍🤩 We SO need him in our daily lives! I would go to house more often just so I could hear him 🤣🤣 
---
Idea: What if with every new patch Bethesda made it say like 2 new things that way it doesn't get old and we won't start disliking it 😁
---
I bought one from another player for like 75 caps
---
Wish that would happen to me
---
Don’t forget, that those Bloodied and AAE Gat Plasmas and laser rifles were duped like crazy through multiple publicly known dupes back in the day..
---
They were at one time (before all this) very easy to acquire.. 
---
And then time passed they became rare and hard to get.. 
---
Idk if that will happen again.. but it might
---
I find the OST enhances the world - not particularly pushing any specific hopeful emotions.  However, I find OSTs that are blatantly disturbing or dark to have the opposite effect of what is obviously the intent.  It makes the darkness generic and bland.
---
STALKER OSTs have a similar approach.  The main world OST is usually ethereal and doesn't push a particular mindset on you, which makes it all the more impactful when you drop into a lab like X-16 and the OST really takes a turn.
---
i had this once, near gregs mine supplies... stood there in full X-01, being lv100+ already, as a lv15 came by, started to whack and shoot me. usually i am the "ignore" kind of guy. but this day something snapped... switched off pacifist... made this guy a dozen new breathing holes with .50 cal. ... fun fact: he came back three times for "revenge". thanks for the caps. and i took his loot... hope he learnt his lesson. edit: second time he hid behind the rocks on the street... switched to daisycutter then...
---
That’s just the username or whatever right?
---
thank you! so all i have to do is not melt it immediately basically? Cannnnnnnnnn do!
---
It's an old issue, but it's gotten worse with the wastelanders bug where enemies drop their loot as world items instead of meat/scrap piles. It takes up a lot more memory, which leads to things despawning faster. I have witnessed legendaries despawning immediately in front of my eyes before on servers that were heavily loaded with random crap on the floor. And horde event like encryptid is especially vulnerable to this, many times the robot bodies despawn as soon as I loot them because there are too many for the game to properly keep track of
---
Could you guys imagine if Bethesda thought ahead and did this for the update?
---
Exactly! Not sure if it actually helps the RNG though
---
How much are we talking? Are you on PC?
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Level Up once
---
Kill ten ghouls
---
Complete an event

NW - place your camp
---
Chew bubblegum
---
How do you get the mat removed after the object is where you want it, or is it there forever? Ive used this glitch a whole lot in my camp, but have never been able to figure out if I could remove the mats under the objects
---
Combat armor has always been better than scout and marine armor.  (Besides rads). No clue what you are on about
---
Mr. Fluffy? I visited him post-Wastelanders and he stopped being anything but helpful. It was like he was completely reprogrammed. Or is an impostor. We already have impostor Mr. Handys, so I guess that would make sense?
---
Like 14 at full and maybe another 10 miscellaneous capacity
---
I’ve done the nuclear winter rewards every single day and haven’t missed any score. I’m just not online when they reset
---
PA has hidden built in dmg/rad reductions that go well beyond the listed numbers on your char pane.
---
thats what I thought as well, but there's no detonation. Also, from the ash-heap ? Is there a Silo there?
---
Holy crap those are easy. Sweet thanks
---
ah no worries, im level 17 so i don't have many options of whether i want to melt stuff or not yet lol. i did start trying to do my settler rep for the gauss shotty though
---
Saw a level 4 other day. It was hilarious. On balls alone i think i wasted 10 stims on him so he made it. LOL
---
I know your camp, been there a few times!
---
We were teamed up for a while a couple nights ago. 
---
- ElDoit
---
Don't worry about it.  They don't convert for that much in the current system.
---
You can't remove the mat. It lives there now. This is the cost of having items under stairs.
---
Should be able to sell them form 1-3k pretty regularly. I get one everytime I do project paradise, but apprently theyre somewhat rare.
---
I'm ok with this
---
Last time i did it we had 2-3 only doing ore and still got to 100, we waited for the last 30 second to turn in the last 8 though but it doesnt take much to collect if you dont really have to worry about mobs.
---
I kinda been lowkey trying to find one.not ready to pay actual cash for it you know
---
I’ve collected 16 over the past year and a half...8 urban and 8 forest
---
Auction will go to 30000 instantly then what, dupers have 10s thousands gifts to open, caps mean nothing...:-)
---
Lol, so how do one delete post?
---
No, I understand what you’re saying. You’re upset because you fell into one of the very, **very** few places that has an *actual* penalty for dying, and lost a few pounds of scrap that can be gotten again. 
---
And I’m saying, that it’s your fault. This game wasn’t made to be Hand Holding Simulator 76, otherwise everybody would be given a full set of SS Unyielding and a TSE flamer right out of the vault. Learn to not fall into a very, very, very small area of the map.
---
Lol @ that karen ass authoritatrian thread
---
I have done it multiple times and nothing I havent had one workshop show up since I have played the new update and I play everyday
---
If it's even semi desirable that is...
---
I even thought about that 2 but I'm with u not really trying to spend real money
---
Ya some camps for me are really hard to find vendors. Usually it’s best to have a vault boy sign pointing where the vending machines are.
---
One camp took me a good 5 minutes to find because he had it behind a metal wall with a small opening to click on them inside his maze of a building. He didn’t have any neon signs or anything. Took forever to find it.
---
Yeah, im a bit fuzzy on the timeline, but fo76 is \~ 25 years after the war and fo2 is like 160 or so years i think.
---
It's unlikely. With all the duping right now lots of high end stuff is being sold for caps.
---
I have antlers, radstag and squirrel left is all. Have santa crash and icicle lights if your getting ready for xmas lol.
---
Who knows how they’re going to retcon things though. The BOS shouldn’t even exist yet.
---
Then sell me one plz
---
How do I get it?
---
You were super, super close. 164 to be exact. So good job. I actually had to look that up right now.
---
three ghouls in the basement too. And theres 10 or so ghouls next door at the workshop.
---
There is over lvl 100 players crying about no loot so if you get loot as lvl 25 you should be there for sure man
---
Tell me if it works for you once the dailies pop-up. Every single time the dailies poped-up since day 1 (June 30) they should appear one after another. What I mean is that the dailies and weeklies included are added in real-time as you watch the list. You see one and the second one is added as if you were adding tasks on a list.
---
The jury consisted of the collectron, a mothman, some bloatflies and several dead raiders but all were in favour
---
Tu madre era un hámster y tu padre olía a saúco
---
Lol what??? Legs are fine, but with enforcer you just break assaultron laser shooting to head, so making them literally harmless
---
do you know that place with the deathclaw a bit west of top of the world? down the mountain, where are the powerlines lead to monongha? theres a LEAD-node close to the mountains wall. a bit from there up the hill is a small lumbercamp, where usually everytime is a chainsaw lying.
---
The chances of it being replaced are infinitesimally small. Bethesda clearly states in multiple sources that we can earn SCORE simply by earning exp. Choosing to implement it as a repeatable weekly was likely the simplest way to get that to work. Since it also never changed last week I think that's also pretty good evidence that it's not going away.
---
Except it does. The Brotherhood was “around” in 2077, and officially founded in 2082. Way before the events of 76.
---
Your lucky you find legacy's for caps most people are trying to get one type of legacy/clothes trades
---
The Brotherhood of Steel was founded immediately after the war. That was established in the first Fallout game.
---
Thank you; it's a huge help!
---
Yep, all i do is take all the pylons, and circling one he's nearest too, that way even if he aims for me, i can just keep moving to break the line of sight. No stims, no sweat.
---
Any place that looks questionable i get in PA.
---
I have a quad double barrel shotgun...you can pull the trigger fast and fire it like a machine gun for those eight shots...wish it had explosive as well though.
---
Nice, small world. I do everything I can to make it not look like a trap camp. I think my free vendor helps. I'm sure we will cross paths again. I apologise if I dropped you when logging out. I do my best.
---
I need only one legacy bloodied energy weapon to be happy. Im on xbox, someone sell me one?
---
Some things are better kept to yourself.
---
You don't have to select the "fill team" option - if you want to play alone.
---
Tbh, while I'm newish so I don't have much to sell, I just have a simple base with two floors, floor one is public stuff like workbenches and the second one has all my own stuff
---
At this point I’ll take the fusion cores. I have 6-7 tops and can’t really find them out in the wasteland
---
This isn't a failsafe, at all. I only logged on yesterday evening and 5 of 9 challenges were alresdy complete. One of those being a 2/2 challenge only being completed to 1/2 when I hadn't logged at all, until the evening.
---
 With the star prize a golden toilet roll holder for camp decor 😁😎
---
If it takes too long to find, I just leave.
---
Yeah on PS4
---
People don’t like the truth
---
My only issue with this is that new players after Season 1 wont have an Ammo Converter. THAT creates FOMO to the extreme. I like the ammo converter too, I think its a boon to the game but they would need to give everyone one. A quest line to get it super early for this to be effective.  
---
At their current state, event rewards do not change based one something you've done in the game, there are no triggers. I would be highly afraid of what Bethesda would break in order to accomplish your goal. 
---
In a perfect world, Id agree with you fully.
---
Haha, well glad I could be of some help
---
Thanks, yeah I may do it this week
---
Oh well. I use them to make many [things](http://imgur.com/a/YGk2Fqz)
---
Hmm, it's still making me have to download it again after a system restart .
---
Happened to me yesterday, I was about to light some shit up and it was actually my cousin. Son of a bitch.
---
I just give up usually, I mean I am looking to spend my caps, you vendor should simplify the process as much as possible, common sense eh... 😂
---
Yeah, pretty sure they removed the extra ones.
---
They're complaining about how even if you queue solo, you end up against a 4 player team in the end and have no chance of winning, it was just poorly worded.
---
Buy what you can afford..keep it or hold in to them till they are worth more.lol might be a while though
---
I have crazy guy, on PS4, and would gladly trade it for a good rifle lol
---
I make a point of checking to see if anyone is at my vendor before I log off / switch servers.  I'll give them 3-4 minutes while I craft some more ammo or something- can't miss that big sale!
---
Had a Scorchbeast fighting a Legendary Sheepsquach the other day, that was a pretty balanced fight
---
If it was some kind of game wide thing I would want everyone else to be able to make use of this though.
---
I run PA (flat 42% damage reduction), rank 3 ricochet (18% chance to avoid damage entirely), and rank 3 dodgy (with rank 3 action boy and the core assembly PA chest mod for massive AP regen). With my vampire gatling laser I can take multiple imposter sheepsquatch face lasers straight to the face while being conduit for all 3 pylons no problem. Basically the only way I can die is if I'm not careful to get to safety when I have to reload.
---
so guess i did something right with my camps cause they follow your recommendations ;)
---
I always wonder why more people don't use the reduce ammo weight perks. I have well over 10,000 rounds in 5.56 alone and my character is far from over encumbered. Plus if you wear full armor with Deep Pocketed as well as a backpack, it's more than ok, plus you can waste the rounds you don't want trying out weapons you wouldn't normally use. I got a bloodied grenade launcher and was having fun with it the other day because I came across some rounds
---
Robot Rage: +15% damage against robots.
---
they probably can, so many people are impacted, they probably just dont have the manpower to review each case and push a button 100k times.
---
Sell. Them.
---
0% chance of being banned for buying one.
---
At first, I thought you had your seconds and minutes mixed up.  I see what you did thar
---
If you don't have bubble gum, I found some at Pleasant Valley Ski Lodge, there's all kinds of stuff lying around there.
---
I mean, a full team with mics will level up sooner than a solo player or a solo players with a team of randoms. Fallout saga playerbase is an OFFLINE player base, a SOLO player base, so what the hell were they thinking?
---
If we have another, any challenge completed counts for the weekly, not just the score daily. Easiest way is to start a new character and get a few easy nw challenges like level up to 1 or take pictures in the vault. Just in case you’re worried you won’t finish the weekly if it pops up again in the future.
---
lel
---
People can justify duping as much as they want, dupings duping though 😎
---
I'm sure many have. Good feels that when one person says it then 10 people say it then Bethesda  sees it and immediately fixes it behind the scenes. Honestly, I keep the good stuff to myself.
---
whenever i bave a problem, i just say its a download problem and they get back to me within the hour
---
yeah, I also switched to the communist one 😅 but it‘s still a bit weak
---
I do......a lot
---
"you actually spent atoms on me?"
---
And why only 12 at a time like I have 3500 to convert but yet can only turn in 12 at a time smh
---
Cased closed
---
Pretty much the same thing happened to me this morning on ps4. I was logged in during the daily reset time. When I checked the dailies a few minutes after reset, all of them except the NW one showed up as complete even though I didn’t do any of them and didn’t get any score. I quit out and relogged a couple times but that didn’t fix it.
---
I heard score bugged at the 12EST reset sometimes, so I had been trying to log off during the daily reset, but this morning I was playing in a public group just finishing an event so I didn’t want to bail out.  Personally, I think all the prizes are trash except the sheepsquash plushie, but this is a terrible bug for players who are aiming for score.
---
Hope they fix this soon.
---
Would there be any other reason?
---
I wouldn't say defeatist, I would say naive. Psychological manipulation is as old as marketing itself, it just varies by how much and how transparent it is. Some people play these new battle royal mobile games which are nothing but an insane transparent cash grab who specifically rely on momentum to be successful that is why none of them last longer than a few years max. It is why video game addiction, digital gambling etc have been added into psychiatry literature because most of this stuff happens on a subconscious level regardless of how self aware and smart you may happen to be. To further disingenuously suggest that "its your fault" for feeling the way they designed the system to make you feel is also extremely naive. 
---
We haven't even gotten into the absolutely atrocious situation they have led us into by releasing all this grindy ass shit into a fundamentally buggy system and then removing the only dopamine you get from it (score/items). So you get left with a gross burned out waste of time compounded by the fact that the investment was 100% fully wasted and then add in that no compensation is possible because "wE DoNt hAvE tHe toOlS". 
---
With that in mind it should be open season on Bethesda right now but we have all these englightened gamers letting us know its not Bethesda's fault, its the players. Its insane. On second thought, do you work for Bethesda?
---
edit: [This was the thread I was looking for.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hq4f1n/my_wife_went_to_bed_and_i_miserably_got_up_to/). Obviously that person has some issues they need to work out, but this is what happens when your system is akin to gambling and fomo.
---
i was under the impression she did scale, but i never cared enough to actually research it. so i'll just take your word that she doesn't and also avoid researching it :D
---
Well, theoretically an auction house usually drives price down due to undercutting and easier availability.
---
30k would be just the cream of the crops legendaries, which frankly I never saw in vendors anyway...but I'd settle happily for less than that eh. 😊
---
Exactly.
---
Forgive my english level, I'm from Spain and I'm trying my best. Anyways, I think you guys get my point. No need for second explanations.
---
That would be nice.
---
As rare as a 3* Vampire Lead Pipe.
---
...or a 3* Exterminators Pool Cue 
---
...or a 3* Nocturnal Board
---
I really must sort through and clear my stash.
---
Sometimes you don't want to check the ingredients IRL. In the fallout universe you definitely don't want to know.
---
Some of these tips are just my opinion from playing a lot
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---

BoS started in 2077, then was fully established in 2082.
---
Fallout 76 is based in 2102-2103.
---
So, where is this idea that they shouldn't exist coming from?
---
Yeah, I just kinda stood there for a minute stunned and watched him walk casually away after attempting to full-on crush my spirit. 😂
---
If i cant find your vendors within 30 to 45 seconds i will leave a couple randomly placed nuke mines and move on
---
fired at a radroach at my feet during scorched earth... with a two shot fatman equipped...
---
You could just not worry about the NW mode.  You can read the lore online and just not worry about the cosmetics
---
:0 I didn't know that. What happens after its destroyed? Do they then attack crops?
---
They are asking for where the corpse is because it blows up and flies to random direction. The body itself will not disappear or turn into goo/ash/meatpile. Coming from \~100 kills xp. Loads of times the body is in the puddles. And covered by water for some odd reason. Still clickable/lootable but not visible above water level.
---
It'll eventually be replaced with the event weekly.
---
SCORE_Challenge_Weekly_QuestComplete_Events_RECURRING "REPEATABLE: Complete a Public Event"
---
Probably for meat week coming up.

Only if he runs Ghoul speed at anyone approaching your camp who has a toaster in their inventory and starts singing Hot Chocolate - You sexy thing while furiously humping your leg like a lovesick puppy.
---
Vats and energy weapons are a match made in heaven for role playing as one.
---
Ok that’s helpful. Thank you
---
Ah yes. With the vending market that I don't know how to find appropriate prices so I don't over or under sell. And it already doesn't help that I've been hitting cap limit the past few days immediately after I sign on.
---
PS4 here.  I burned a dozen key cards (thank you guy that had them in his machines at 50 caps each, much love) on the queen myself this weekend and participated in probably 10 more randoms.  I also had trouble swapping servers to join friends this weekend cause I kept hitting full servers.
---
I think you just had some bad luck friend.  Better luck this weekend =)
---
usually.
---
&gt; If you’re really saying that specifically NW is a buggy mess, then either you have the finest tipped pen to draw the line on what counts for buggy, or you haven’t actually played this game. There’s bugs from Skyrim that are still in adventure mode.
---
I can play good games if they are bugged, NW is trash.
---
&gt;Oh, and look at that. You also quoted me telling you to go play the 90’s tactical ops and the original Unreal. So, go play those. Like you just quoted me telling you to do.
---
I play what i want, and its not a fucking crappy mode thats only populated by forcing players to play, before wastelanders you couldnt get a full NW lobby because they didnt force you to play it to get metrics.
---
NW = Trash.
---
Oof
---
Events...many, many events.
---
When making multiple large purchases over 5k I like to wait a minute between selections just in case they're running up on their max cap count.  I also like to screen cap the inventory / gamer tag in case they need to log out.   Missed out a High Capacity Backpack mod a few weeks ago and its been bugging me ever since
---
Wire me some caps? I just spent too much on a fixer plan lmfao
---
All the low level players would waste my effort. Im not taking a queen out solo.
---
Go and do Line in the Sand when it comes up.  That event seems to gift me 4-6 Fusion Cores every single time.
---
Looks to me like one of the Moleminers shot a missile at something and missed. Glowing Moleminers often carry them.
---
The missile is just roaring off toward the horizon.
---
The new stuff? One of the older songs is Super Soul Bossa by Ray Lopez. It’s the one that gets stuck in my head
---
yeah, me too. i use to walk backwards to fight mobs which are approaching me. was to close to prime...
---
I never put that together.would love to see a squad like that.
---
I am by no means rich. Still have a lot to unlock and my build is trash.
---
It is pretty rare actually, because everyone who has ever gotten one scripped it.
---
Watch them change it tomorrow so it isn’t there for double XP lol
---
What's your INT at?  I think higher INT = less core drain in PA.
---
I could be wrong but I noticed my low level alt I have hiding in PA was draining cores extremely fast just walking/running.  Well beyond what I'd expect power user (50% less drain) to account for.  My main guy on the other hand has 15 INT and I just can't burn through them fast enough even with a gatling laser.
---
Gotcha. I haven’t messed with this dupe at all so I wasn’t sure exactly what can be duplicated. Good to know
---
Every time I've run into insult bot lately, I've been in the middle of sniping enemies and he's led them straight to me. That's the REAL insult.
---
shhhhh! why tell the world and they fix it!!
---
I would not put it past them to do something like that.
---
It would be awesome if it were a later level perk, even, so that you couldn't do it at first, but could later one. Or even as an addition to one of the armor/weapon perks you already have.
---
you got "demolition expert" wrong somewhere ;)
---
Yeah agreed I saw I guy  yesterday he started  radiation rumble alone by the time I got there all scavengers dead and event is failed.
---
big brain.
---
Yep, consumables are character and all else is account. I think the only ones worth worrying about are the lunchboxes as they can make a huge difference. You definitely qant those on the right toon.
---
So recently I'm doing Sophia's quest and I've cleared the building and I'm just looking for the quest item.
---
I'm running at this point coz I think it's safe and I run jump the last flight of stairs right into the middle of the room. 
---
I hear a slight mechanical whirring and I look around and notice that I am completely surrounded by turrets, I think there were 12-16 of them? Two to four mounted on each wall?
---
I was dead in three seconds flat. Give or take half a second for the lag caused by the unrelenting bullets.
---
It's excellent to get some scrips, other than that I am afraid it doesn't have much value.
---
Yes. You would also keep and be able to remove the junk in your scrap box, but not be able to add to it.
---
There are other places that are fun to nuke.
---
How many scrips could one expect
---
&gt;  What's next, an Assaultron Furry? 
---
haven't run into the imposter sheepsquatch yet have you?
---
Although it makes sense to leave the XP one for double XP and change to the score one for the bonus score weekend.
---
this explains a lot...
---
Formula P is easily in the 1-2K selling category
---
Seems its an xbox pc expansion thats causing it. Ps4 hasnt had the same influx of new players suddenly. Its good for selling crappy plans and mods but not for endgame. I never sell cards that cheap. Like 10x to start. If its busy i can get 1000 ea.
---
Is there a way to recycle more than 12 bullets at a time and limit the screens we have to load. 
---
Like set the parameters once
---
Drop ammo
---
Produce ammo setting
---
Ive previously written a thread on this when the problem first arrived with Wastelanders, It'd be nice if we could get it to hit the front page for some traction with Bethsoft!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3nxbd/list_of_visual_bugs_so_far_since_the_wastelanders/
---
I didn’t bother on yesterday’s challenge for the same reason
---
I'm somewhere in the mid 70's now.  It's a nice place to be cause I can be a sidekick in one event (like sbq) and then be a bigshot in something like tea time or campfire tales with people in the 20-40's
---
I finally encountered this today and it totally killed my motivation. I've been finding it super satisfying to see the bar increase (and hear the noise it makes when you reach the next level) and now I guess my progress is stalled until at least the next reset.
---
Top of the world, there is an arena that has raider PA most of the time .. not sure what level
---
A picture would help
---
I run JE heavies and usually run the mire. Start at The steakhouse and run counter clockwise the rim of the mire/all the fire bases. Hitting the northern fissure site, then prime by that fire base. Then, I do a fighting retreat north, to the fire base outside of Watoga and those fissure sites too. Not the most productive in terms of grinding legendaries, but I usually get a few and a lot of XP. Scorchbeasts are more of a nuisance with fireproof x3. I can literally stand there and rain fire upwards while they circle. Once they land it’s over for them cause the JE LMG comes out.
---
Do you happen to be in PC?
---
Oh my god that's amazing!  Thank you for this info, it's incredibly helpful!
---
Lol truth. It doesn't matter so much now because everyone in a Queen fight has god roll everything... but same used to go for people shooting the Queen in the air wasting ammo and aggravating her so she crop dusts and won't land. There should be a 101 or CliffsNotes on how to properly run every event.
---
Yes, I do!
---
workshops are meant to be contested, that's by design. however the ammunition plant is really the only one that I've ever been fought over.
---
your personal camp \*can\* be attacked but the player attacking is marked as wanted and virtually never happens unless by accident.
---
It was an army helmet, thanks tho
---
&gt;I play what I want
---
*There* we go! You finally got it! You’re gonna play what you think is good in your opinion! We reached the end! Congrats! 
---
So now that we’ve established that we’re all playing what *we* as individuals want to play, why don’t we leave it al that. The vast majority of people still think that 76 as a whole is a horrible game that they wouldn’t play even if they were given money to do so. So, let the people playing NW enjoy it if they like, bugs or not. Just like you’re enjoying adventure, bugs or not. Aren’t opinions fun?
---
Have an upvote from me I totally agree and so do many many others.
---
The event needs to be changed so only the owner of the card can trigger the event. Hopefully it will get changed.
---
Do the ally quest lines... you'll see.
---
PS4
---
Easy itll cost you 1.50
---
It's a long grind! If you're on Xbox and ever wanna team up, I'll give you a hand. I can PM you my GT
---
Ah IC
---
Usually I do this event in a private server, seems much more reliable.  
---
Also no noobs messing me up because they don't understand the event and I don't have to feel guilty about the poor lv ~25 dying over and over and over
---
What is considered legacy these days anyway?  I used to know, but have long forgotten what i should be looking for?
---
If on xbox I'll send you my g.t I get in about 2 hours a day at times in the evening  .but westeck whitesprings buildings and golf club and I had some good luck at the burrows north and south.dont go to the forest upper left of the map usually dead for me.events 
---
uranium fever
---
Guided meditation 
---
Horde challenges
---
There some more not thinking atm
---
It was like 3 hours into playing but I’ll be checking again in a little while, hopefully it’s just a visual glitch as people said above.
---
I just love how protectrons always say company/organisation names like it's been overdubbed. That real generic 'your company here' thing. For some reason it sounds even funnier when it's on about the worker's party.
---
40
---
I know just looking for easy flux farming that i got spoiled by. No need to gather this that then craft just handed to you lol.
---
I do them all the time with my cards and about 40% of the time someone does that. I usually get on mic to tell people I'm waiting for more people to show but that doesn't stop a lot of them. You also get the assholes that don't hold any pylons and try to insta kill the imposter which is ever worse.
---
Since it is a 3* you get 40, the machine doesn’t care if it’s a nocturnal board or a bloodied fixer
---
Screw them.  You scored damage you got loot and the bitch cried.
---
Lol.i expect if its 3star 40 script 2 star 15 and 1 star 5script
---
ah that would be superb, thanks for the offer but i am on pc
---
Private servers definitely suffer less from this, you don't have dozens of glowing blood and random guns lying around fissure site prime from a nuke 2 hours ago crapping up your game
---
Most high level players are more than happy to carry any new players through an event. Join any open teams or just create one!  
---
And again, most players that’ve been hoarding for a while will typically drop a goody bag full of consumables for lower level players.  It’s a good community in a game that has a bad rep.
---
Cool, cool. Thanks for the info!
---
I have 100% fall damage reduction. Probably many others do, as well. 
---
Parachute free BASE jumping is fun!
---
Send me a friendrequest and come to my private server. I'll craft one for you. My IGN is Haippari
---
Get a few people in the Secret Service armor with faster fire rate laser rifles using vats on a tough enemy. It's pretty amusing to watch the laser light show.
---
Damn, well happy hunting!
---
Horde events. Most of them if you kill them all EXCEPT the boss more enemies will spawn and then you can keep killing them. Best i had was 3 3\* legendary fog crawlers at the same time. 
---
Also look for leader of the pack in the forest. guaranteed 3 legendaries.
---
Wow hold on, someone on the 76 subreddit that doesn't have a knee jerk negative reaction to PvP and understands the game was originally survival-lite? Absolute blasphemy. How dare you have a reasonable perspective and understanding of the state of PvP!
---
Seriously though, it's good to see that some people understand the games original intent and don't immediately hate on PvP even though it's completely optional at this point. I wish more people could show their support for PvP, even if they aren't themselves interested. There's so many fantastic suggestions to make PvP better for both the PvPers and PvErs, the community just needs to be open minded.
---
This makes more sense than the silo thing-- if you look really close, you can actually see it coming from an indentation in the background rock formation and start below horizon line and streak up past the trees and the rest of the background. Thats indicative of a rocket from a mole miner sure. 
---
It looks like it starts within the FOV, however--if it were a random event, that might be on purpose.
---
That’s a good point. I suppose if you’re just downloading the game you might not notice the team tab, and may not realize that higher INT gives more XP.
---
same, Punk is my favorite for sure. he really does seem like the kind of dude who would ask to crash on your couch for a night and just never leave, but he is fun enough that you let him stick around.
---
We look for a combination of creativity, decor and style, a sense of personality.
---
That's good, settler rep is harder to increase anyway :-)
---
I’m what you would call a high level player.  I launch at least one Queen fight every night.  I love seeing low level players get a level up during the fight...that’s what the fight is for!!!
---
Side note...it irritates me when I launch the nuke and someone takes it upon themselves to finish her off in 30 seconds.  I realize it’s a public server and you think you’re doing us all a favor.  Please, don’t.  We’re fine.
---
As i has said i was spoiled by the constant rain of nukes so have lots of some materials and none of others now. I have specific goals in mind is all.
---
I've done all the ally quest lines (that i know of) and dont recall any of them having a rocket, so why dont you DM me and explain.
---
Yeah... my CAMP is right by the vault and I keep a constant supply of nukashine readily available at my punch bowl.
---
&gt;They have never once come out and said "hey we fucked up we are working on it".
---
that right there is why i have so little respect for bethesda.
---
healing with water is very very underrated
---
What a great suggestion.
---
Yea people have been really nice last night a guy in awesome power armor gave me a bunch of plans.
---
Do you remember where exactly?
---
It has been getting better with the SBQ. Everytime i do one now i notice more people not shooting while she's flapping about. And usually when the few people shooting realise others aren't they stop.
---
Yeah.
---
Just sit on the terminal if it bothers you. Noone can do it if you're actually in the terminal yourself, just hop off to check how many are around every once in a while so people aren't bored waiting when there's a few. 
---
Conversely don't be the guy who AFK's on it for 8 fucking minutes doing that.
---
Easiest Dailys by far
---
But more importantly. Have fun.
---
Yikes I paid WAY more than 1-3k for it .... But then I use Formula P regularly so it was still worth it. 
---
PSA - Formula P improves ranged weapon accuracy (mentioned in the description), but what actually happens is that of you take 3 of them then your plasma/laser gatling or gauss/5mm minigun, also .50cal or LMG fires with deadly accuracy and every shot lands. Really good if you use a Furious because missed shots reset that. Just need a regular supply of Formula P!
---
I haven't heard of it either, and I've played that event a number of times.
---
I probably launch 8-10 nukes a week. You, and everyone else, regardless of level, are always welcome. If anyone mouths off, bollocks to 'em
---
Gotcha.  Definitely not on my list.  If I see you on I'll drop you the thing.
---
Ur not wrong dude, had to put the game down a while ago too cuz it just feels like I’m doing the same chore over and over. A good game keeps u coming back because it’s fun to play, not because it’s a fu King mobile game on console. In a few years once they’ve added several story dlcs I will find it fun but until that day fts I’m out
---
Looks like a fun fight. Nice to see people actually spread out and use cover.
---
I always put my plans in my vendor for zero caps.  with very few exceptions.
---
and people usually take them same day
---
Ive only done that one once. I’ll have to give it another shot. Thanks man!
---
Nukacrypt website is where you need to go
---
I’m 100% for that!
---
There needs to be a cap otherwise prices in vending machines are just going to get ridiculous. Raising the cap limit sure. But removing? No thanks.
---
Go to Camden Park, climb the rollercoaster and go all the way around the track until you find a cart that has two dead dudes and a bag. In the bag is the west bridge key. Then go to New River Gorge Bridge West by Cow Spots Creamery and down under the end of the bridge to find a door which that key is for. A level 15 raider PA spawns in there but it's only bits at a time so some server hopping might be needed to get the right parts.
---
Nope. Google: Nukacrypt
---
Just let us scrap them for legendary modules or use legendary modules to reroll stats. 
---
I don't think people will feel the need to keep as many if they could roll new legendary versions.
---
At 3 wt a piece I just give them to PA wearers
---
I don't think it does.  Even if you're the only one in a team you're still on a team.
---
Yeah there should be a popup like when you drop something favorited.
---
You need each code piece (8) from the specific silo you’re trying to launch from
---
However you can find the launch codes on Nuka crypt You don’t need to decipher the codes but you need to find the code pieces
---
Amen. I keep Radaway in the 12 o’clock position on the favorites wheel for this very reason.
---
I just got home I'll look for you! What you asking for it?
---
I’ve been farming the event more times than I can count. You only have to heard them at two times during the whole event. The first being when you start the event. And the second being after they hear the Sheepsquatch yell and one Brahmin gets startled. And even then you don’t need to heard that one Brahmin until it stops in its tracks. From there, they all move on their own until the end
---
Idk what lobbies youve been in but my group drops at least 3-6 nukes in our 2-3 hrs of time 
---
the only event i see nobody flocking to is Project Paradise
---
Yes, you do need to find them.  I find mine on nukacrypt.
---
Sounds normal to me. Here in the US most of the country is like this as well.  The majority of the population lives in the cities where the internet is good if not great.  The majority of the country isn't cities though so if you don't live in one of those might as well just get some tin cans with a string between them LMAO.
---
12 single digit players on current server.
---
Thanks folks !
---
Not like you're stealing their loot... unless they think that your DPS will somehow prevent them from getting loot... in which case them getting upset is the over-compensation equivalent of driving a big, lifted truck, yet only being 5'5" tall...
---
Just use the social tab and send message to the recently leaving camp holder.
---
Many times they might log back in or simply hopped to a new server and you can rejoin
---
I wish that would happen with the time to collect ally quest!
---
That is not true at all, multiple people can use the same terminal at once and have always been able to. Try it sometime
---
Yeah, I just logged on (1428 my time) and have 5/7 dailies completed and my SCORE level is the same 27 it was yesterday. 5/7 with where I was at yesterday would have put me up at least a full level, maybe two as I was over halfway through level 27. Do I need to sleep in until the evening to log on??
---
Yep, I just herd them to hurry them the fuck up, I only let them off when they’re about to go to their spot then wait for the sheepsquatch, I know where it comes from so I guard that spot when playing solo
---
They are bugthesda for a reason but wtf.
---
Turret spam. It's not absolutely effective, but if you position them far enough apart and all over the place so they can't be taken out with one explosive round you can sometimes buy enough time to escape or if you're especially lucky (and bold) assist in the kill. Keep in mind, this works best against the slightly off META Bloodied build PvPers (especially if they forgot to heal their rads past 19%) . A full health PvPer is likely to brush off that turret fire.
---
I've had some very close calls and even a couple defeats at the hands of low levels that were very smart about their turret placement and tactics. It's still an uphill battle, but it at least helps level the playing field slightly.
---
I've tried to explain many times why there is a limit and why removing it would be bad. They don't understand that prices on things will shoot up. I am all for a raise though. Even just 10k or make it a nice even 50k
---
I’ve just made it on to the orange section, only been doing the dailies including NW.
---
This made me grin, thanks! I've only been playing 2 months, and I am loving solo running the silos to launch nukes :) I might start having to time myself
---
Oh so rare you'll have to kill a  few queens to find that !
---
Screw those people! You have as much right to enjoy the game as they do.
---
I just read all of the replies to this thread, some quite vindictive and petty, so I just thought that maybe there was some downside to being shot at, like it interrupts your screen or something.
---
I mean if you take offense to someone virtually shooting at you or near you, that has no downside, to the point where you'd no longer do business with them...or take jumping on and off the vendor as a small victory to the "child"? Imagine interpretting something trivial as an insult and then wasting your time intentionally in the belief that you're wasting someone elses, that sounds more toxic than someone pressing left click on you. You must have hated when chip damage was a thing lol. Seems overly sensitive that's all.
---
I have. The last time someone did that at that event and went AFK for the full 8 and a half minutes. Impossible to access it.
---
There were literally 6 people around him throwing grenades and shooting him getting impatient and trying to access it. I've managed to do it on other terminals before and access at the same time, but that one wouldn't work at all.
---
Edit- words.
---
I think that it would be better if it gave a chance to buff or debuff depending on your reaction. 
---
-2 Per for teary eyes or -2 endurance for hurt feelings.
---
SCORE reward
---
I have had this issue for two weeks I join the world last 1 minute the prompt comes up like you said disconnected from server to main menu. Afterwards I cant join any world due to server timed out message. I have to delete game data and restart the game to log back in only for it to happen all over again. Any explanation would be helpful too! I did send a ticket 6 days ago and no response from Bethesda! 
---
I have exhausted all trouble shooting suggestions but no solution.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Me either
---
Yeah ive heard about the internet in american countryside😂 I'll consider myself lucky
---
Caps would have more value if everything wasn't being duped all the time. Their are still plenty of people with thousands of duped presents.
---
Helping people in 76 is what makes the game good for me.
---
Congrats! Have fun making your own formula p..
---
Server i just jumped into i can count 12 single digit players and another half dozen under 25. At 130 something im the highest by far on this random server.
---
Sure it was, you just didn't want to reply to it
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
I use inspirational for that 15% extra XP
---
I mean, I really want those cosmetics so bad. I don't give a  damn about a forced and cheap lore based on a BR vault.
---
And thank you for all the queens to fight and flux to farm.
---
I think they should give more exp for bosses in General i dont feel good getting Like 180 XP for a scorched ghoul, and like 500 or 600 for badass sbq mythical deathclaw wendigo coloss stuff. Like killing 3 ghouls is the same as a sbq. I hope you get me.
---
Dupers gotta dupe....
---
Id def keep hopping servers then.
---
Im level 300+  if i see im the highest level by far, i switch servers.
---
Considering i just got a AAE gat plasma i think i will
---
Just because the challenge is in the game files doesn't necessarily mean they'll use it. In the past I've seen other challenges and references to them that have absolutely never been activated. I'll concede that it's at least a little more likely it'll change (especially since they said public events should also be giving SCORE), but there's also other possible explainations. Either we'll have to wait to hear some official word from Bethesda or we'll just have to wait and see.
---
No shit! So besides the obvious, there's no catch? It just converts ammo no question no requirements scraps ect?
---
Everyone wants cross platform play until they find some PC player with a generated minigun shooting mininukes. 
---
Cross console maybe but Sony would never allow it.
---
Does any of it matter if they do 2x xp or did the legendary run make those not a thing anymore?
---
Exactly. What many players don’t realize is that in games, once game currency enters the game, it seldom leaves. And it enters so fast. 
---
Because in games, you don’t have much cost of living like real life. No rent, utilities, or whatever. In this game, buying serums is the highest priced item that takes caps out of the game. Then buying gold. 
---
They need to put in a lot more things to spend your caps on in game to remove caps.
---
It opens up on your pipboy if someone is on a terminal. You are mistaken
---
Nah, legendary perks are still unfinished and at least two months from release. I wouldn't do this early, there's a decent chance Bethesda improves it later to be less inconvenient.
---
Just because you don’t like their camp does not make it scorched shit. I am sure there are people who feel the same way about your camp. 
---
This is a game and people have the right to play it as they choose and design their camp as they please. If you hate other camps that much you should stick to FO 1st and only let friends that have camps you approve of join your server, this way you will not be forced to witness these “abominations” as you call them. 
---
P.S: I have seen some of these hovering camps, and while not my style personally, having the infinity to create a boat, starship, etc is quite a feat in my book.
---
You don’t miss “take a photo of a player engaged in pvp in a rad storm while you are naked?”
---
A very cool suggestion. Problem I see is when you run out of ammo while out and about. Many times while leveling at first I would have to grab a gun and ammo off a corpse to keep going. 
---
Also crafting ammo is far more efficient, and this would also make the different crafting mats redundant.
---
PS swapping the useless ammo vending machines with converters would be awesome.
---
Im Level 94 and have 11 unspent points i dont know what to skill even now haha. What will it be in 100 levels then 😂
---
Yup. The closest thing I've experienced is getting trapped in objects when fast traveling to CAMP's, forcing me to fast travel again to get unstuck.
---
You don't need to find any of the 8, just the code from nukacrypt and a keycard
---
On the back part, where the flea market and arena are at, that house that is right next to the arena on the lower floor. It was sitting on top of a shelf with some other things. Can't guarantee that it will be there when you visit though or if it's a static spawn. 
---
But, check the office inside the lodge where Vendorbot Resin is, too. There's legitimately several places there you'd be likely to find some. 
---
There's probably some inside of Top of The World too, on the floor below Rose. 
---
Maybe Sunday Brother's Cabin in the basement with the food items.
---
I really hate that challenge because I see bubblegum all of the time, and never have it when this challenge comes up, then it's as if it's nowhere to be found.
---
*sigh*
---
See Rule #1
---
I try but just seems lately its much more tedious.
---
We can only hope that Bethesda will improve it to be less inconvenient but this is Bethesda after all.
---
I think if you've logged in for the day and your main goal is to play events and do so with a group, you're going to need to take the hit to XP and start an Events group.
---
It's far easier to signal your intentions if you've made or joined an Events group and I think it's fair to get a bit annoyed if other players in an Events team aren't doing Events, though I don't know what the point in joining the team would be at that point.
---
But you're right, within Building or Casual groups, nobody is beholden to anyone else. Enjoy the free xp and caps from people doing their quests, leapfrog off other people and their CAMPs and tents to save some caps on fast travelling, say hello when you're nearby, but don't get annoyed if people in a public team on an online game with no specific goal don't do exactly what you want them to do.
---
If this is the case man, RIP they most likely invested hours into a character and there risking it all
---
I got a 3* troubleshooters ultracite gatling laser that only ways like 1.5, I swapped to that as my primary and started at 25 some odd cores of varying charges and am down to like 5 right now.
---
I'd imagine corpses would be tied to servers, so if you just switched servers they'd go away.
---
Hopefully they bring them back, even if only for the weekends or something. Would be *really* nice to have that tiny little extra breathing room.
---
sonofarobot  add pc
---
How sure are you about this? Other people are saying that I do need to get them
---
Leave the world and come back. Or just wait, they’ll go away
---
Lots of people going full-on with the exp grind lately, the repeatable 10k exp is how people are getting obscenely high score ranks. Of course I'm sure a lot of them are using exploits, but if you rearrange your build, wear unyielding armor, and chug all the right consumables, and devote insane hours to it, you could theoretically get pretty far along the score gameboard legitimately too.
---
Just guessing, but why would so many higher level/seasoned players suddenly come now? It's the only thing that's changed...
---
Ohhh right, if you focus on nuke launchings, then I agree with you totally on that point.
---
I actually have no idea, but I can hope.
---
Brilliant idea. Bethesda should hire you.
---
Thanks should have though of that.
---
Thanks don’t know why I didn’t think of that.
---
How far in? I’m almost to the orange, but I don’t want to pay to win if I can avoid it...
---
I'm sorry to hear that happened to you.  Tell your friend they gave really bad advice and in the future just plan for long walks to train stations or work benches if you get over encumbered.  That's what I do.  It adds something in the game for me as far as resource management and the stress of the adventure to get back to safety.
---
😂
---
I will add you tommorow, now i am going to sleep (its night in my country :) )
---
Why were u dropping stuff?
---
How you getting 200?  Limit is 150?
---
Then you must have been grinding a shit ton of XP at the same time. All dailies and weeklies so far has me still on the first part of the board.
---
Not yet, no.
---
100%
---
The person who said "Yes, you do need to find them, I find mine on nukacrypt" I believe meant it in a joking way
---
I only ever actually collected all 8 once, when I decoded it myself the first time
---
Ever since then I just use nukacrypt and good to go
---
I dumped a bunch on someone's bed.
---
I named my instigating shovel grave digger because I only use it for buried with honor lol
---
Made it to the first orange today after today’s challenges
---
I don't think I've ever had more than 14K at one time.... I must be playing this game wrong....
---
"Serves virtually no benefit"
---
then seconds later
---
"limits the economy"
---
THAT IS THE BENEFIT.
---
The bug still exists without comment from Bethesda because the Atom option to skip levels starts from tomorrow.  
---
I have no doubt that without shame they will refer users to this exciting new option.
---
And higher level events i end up doing alone more often now. Just trying to grind out a few k caps for a recipe lol.
---
Ok thanks, I appreciate it
---
My son had me jumping off Gafton Dam to get this challange.
---
I trigger. Wait for my friends to get there and less than a min in someone launches it and start shooting at the robot before pylons are even online
---
You must have given me some good luck because not long after reading this I actually got a bloody 40% faster swing speed shishkebab from an Encryptid event. Only weight reduction could make it better for me but who cares about 2 pounds. Time to whack some friendlies!
---
No problem :) happy nuking
---
Just buy something. Anything. Resell it for a cheaper price in your vendor just to get caps moving out, product coming in, and caps coming in. It stimulates the economy and you’re helping out your poor neighbors out. It’s more fun and rewarding to pay it forward and help others than be a Scrooge McDuck and just complain that it’s never enough
---
I sadly did this once not realizing that was how the event worked - I was new-ish.  I felt horrible and boy did the player let me have it verbally.  I'm more careful now.
---
Yup, that'll do it lol
---
God mode xp glitching their way through the legendary track, that's 250 levels worth.
---
I get that but only with weapons of the same type. For example go from instigating bash damage to junkies explosive or mutants explosive. Both are much weaker and annoying
---
I notice it most with shotguns
---
I block the door using a power armor chassis.
---
The reward for killing the scorchbeast queen is 4000 XP from completing the event not the XP for killing it but I get your point
---
LOL.  I was actually fine with slap damage.  Real PVPers would understand that someone might not be interested, and if after a couple of slaps the person doesn’t respond, they move on.  It really was the griefers that caused a problem.  Once slap damage was removed they moved onto another way to try to wreck havoc.  It’s a shame that some prominent you tubers even made some videos of them griefing other players to glorify it.   Every major nerf to PVP has primarily been a result of griefers in my eyes.  
---
I’ll make comments on some posts that PVP was a dead experiment in the game, but it’s not out of hatred or anger towards PVP, but rather that the team working on this game simply have no clue how to implement it in a fair or at least interesting way.  When the game first stared I even participated here and there when the mood struck my fancy (I even collected assassin’s gear towards the start). But then again, this game has so much missed potential on so many levels it doesn’t surprise me.  We have icons and outfits for different factions yet they couldn’t even implement a simple faction system. All they’d have to do is have “Equip this icon + this factions outfit - PVP vs other factions”
---
I will say they didn’t do the shittiest job implementing Nuclear Winter, as far as battle royal systems go, but that’s not exactly a high bar to set in my opinion.  Though the constant push to give players rewards that are usable in adventure mode simply pushes people to bush Wookiee the whole day.   I’m just not a fan of Battle Royal systems anyways, I would rather more of a death match where you rack up a better Kill/Death ratio for a win. 
---
I think at this point, I don’t see PVP ever being implemented or leveraged in any way in the future.  Maybe because not enough player base cares about it (and thus not enough return on investment) or maybe because they know inside they just can’t do it.  Or maybe because there are too many entitled players who think that they deserve every reward in the game and thus will piss and moan about every reward locked behind a PVP gate.  Again, I don’t say this out of malice towards the PVP community (until they start getting snippy with me)
---
I’d fully support a good, balanced PVP system.  I’d even praise them if they could come up with a way to integrate non-PVPera into it in some way (PVPera fight on the front line while non-PVPers collect supplies to provide them benefits.). Long winded post, I’m sorry.
---
Take your time with this game. Don't rush. Explore and try to have fun. Stay at the Forest region until level 15-20, then move on and explore other regions. Don't focus on main quest too early, just do events, explore and take over workshops and you will be level 50 in no time.
---
Even at level 1 it goes off all the time for me. The more times something shoots at you the more it has a chance to go off, off course. I get shot at a lot (once they see me). pew pew pew, bullets bouncing off me ftw
---
Not while there's any chance in hell of duping anything.
---
You would have scumbag dupers/cheaters running around with millions of caps right now if there were no cap.
---
After Fo2, one of the contributing factors to the NCR/BoS war was the BoS interfering with the gold mines in Redding and causing the NCR to be unable to maintain a gold standard.
---
In 76 we just started establishing a gold standard. I think we have an excellent opportunity to get a morally grey conflict between new and old world authority rather than a boring good vs evil that Fallout 3 pushed too hard.
---
An opportunity to for our characters to shift the Enclave into a legitimate authority at least until the great winter in the coming decades.
---
Plus many of our characters are intentionally mutated with Enclave help. Normally that goes against their No Mutants Allowed standard, but with us calling the shots I'm interested in this narrative we could have here and the future implications on the Fallout Universe.
---
Yea I've been getting some funky changes too.  I might suggest picking a build because all three of those guns run off differnt cards.  The rifleman/commando is a good hybrid and switching out cards makes it real easy.
---
Tried to revive someone at sbq. Missed. Exited power armour. Got mobbed by scorched cave crickets.
---
Also a member of the "thought I could jump the fissure" club.
---
Reddit should also have a second button, “complain about an update two minutes after its release”
---
I had a lot of problems and was also using an AA 50 cal rifle. I started using a 50 cal machine gun and it hasn’t been an issue.
---
I’ve heard it could be related to using a 50 cal rifle.
---
I nuke the queen a lot, if there are some heavy hitters at the queen I message them afterwards telling them to gear up for encryptid.
---
Works everytime.
---
I just unlocked the [Atomic Onslaught Excavator paint](https://i.redd.it/q2eygse41oa51.png) which is fabulous by the way. I've largely been playing between my two most high level characters, one of them is a bloody build and gains a lot of XP with high intelligence and a set of UNY armor.
---
Tomorrow, I'm hoping to have that Sheepsquatch Plushie unlocked.
---
I do too but you can fall through the holes in the roof as well
---
I know... i‘m a dreamer.
---
Missle silo Charlie. I was going to launch anyway for an event AND a terminal,  and there's always ghouls hanging out outside lol...
---
My S.C.O.R.E. rank is 42 at the moment.
---
Give then to meeeeeee. Bloodied + damage aiming gatling laser is pretty god tier
---
That is true, generally keeps the low levels from starting it though as they generally don’t have marsupial to jump up it.
---
Imagine having to pay daily for camp maintenance or rent (game days, not irl) like gta and RDR2
---
I saved him but Beckett talks as if I chose Frankie to die. that's weird
---
Dude I got a vampire shovel with faster swing and plus 1 strenth... level 20....:'(
---
Does that roof have a hole in it? If not, just take a note from the fast nutt doods who blocked the robots with PA on the bridge. Block the door.
---
As someone who has played a lot of MMOs (most of which have had PVP elements) I understand the desire to get the cool cosmetic (mine were typically things like Mounts in World of Warcraft or the house items in Everquest 2), but I just accept I can’t get everything.
---
You can always just bush Wookiee it.  Equip something like aqua boy and sit in the water.  I’m doing it in a match right now, already down to 29 players and I’m not even actively playing, just look up every couple of minutes to see if I need to sneak over.  I just play handheld games or on my switch while I wait.
---
Hey first timer here. Looking to built an ammo merchant character. Where can I scavenge gun powder or make it?
---
I used silo for the possum hacking badge.
---
Oh man, thats sad!
---
I didn't realise there were so many ways to boost experience point's, I was just reading of away to get almost 300% XP boost with a bit of work and like you said yourself consumables. Herbivore here I come lol
---
...njeeehhhnoooooooo, well, this is debatable at best - it's much more sensible that someone gives you readily existing ammo for 'helping them' than gifting you points in a machine virtually no one in the wasteland has. And how does he even get access to your terminal, did you get hacked? Is there horseporn on your ammo converter terminal now!?!??!?
---
That being said, it's of course much better from a convenience POV (assuming you get enough points to craft what you would have gotten). And regardless of the ammo converter, I'd still say that ammo points should have been a currency (#19 or so, yay!) - that you could also spend at the ammo selling machines at train stations...
---
Edit: fuck me I didn't read the whole post... :) But still 'points' doesn't quite fit, some sort of tokens would have been better.
---
I've got 5 characters, all lvl 100-240. My heavy guns guy lives in PA and the only other armor he owns is a stealth suit. My guerilla carries a set of PA just for nuke zones because she has only 2 strength and I'm always over encumbered without my unyielding armor. And my melee and commando builds own but don't use PA. They carry a stealth suit for rad emergencies. My first ever character was a PA melee build, but now he's just a mule.
---
The commando is my main and runs a mix of unyielding powered heavy armors, hopefully eventually all secret service. He's plenty tanky. The AP buffs on the legendary armor pieces are the key to the build. He's way less powerful in PA.
---
The thing is you want to plan out your build early on and decide if you're going to want to use PA or if you want a regular armor set focused on a perticular legendary effect. It will be a factor in the perks you choose and the kinds of weapons and armor you'll want to seek out. You'll find that around level 50 once you've got your perks well sorted the game becomes pretty easy with the exception of just a few tough events. If that's not the case, it's more likely that you haven't built a strong perk load out than that your armor isn't good enough.
---
How much have you played to get there? Pretty much every day?
---
Yeah sometimes it just works haha
---
Yikes! Surely that's something people will get banned for
---
Yea best advice get a smarter friend.
---
Got me. Sry.
---
So, if you wanna buy it, I found something better. My id on pc is zosth
---
I'm around level 40. I usually get 2-3 levels a day if I don't play a lot of NW. Gives me another reason to nuke the queen and farm adds.
---
On PS4, i see way more people doing events now however. But we did not have the pass like xbox and pc though.
---
So I am hurting myself, simply not noticeably.
---
That and that there's no XP share for kills, and trying to manage tagging enemies with strangers, who you have no idea if they'll play ball, rather than just going off on your own and shredding any enemies without thought.
---
Yup more dailys on friday through sunday or at least that's how it looks
---
Today my quest with him is bugged - it says talk to Ward but when I do he doesn't trigger the next step.  The universe balances out I guess.... at my expense today it seems.... ;)
---
It works for some mutations, but not all
---
I would say it’s Arktos, but yeah, radiation rumble is up there too
---
Explosive energy weapons and flamers, mostly. 
---
Also explosive harpoon guns but no one is lining up to trade for my furious explosive  harpoon gun... legendary The Dragons... probably others.
---
Explosive rounds send bodies flying but they’ll eventually return as meat piles if you don’t loot them.
---
Would there be something to say it’s on like in the effect screen?
---
Yeah, everyday.
---
Checking in at 35.5.  Putting some decent hours in but lately I do daily's and reputation quest setup my vendors then play something on my xbox.
---
I hear ya. thats why ive been using discords or running into online friends. makes it easier
---
Pal, I used to put a single bullet in every living soul of that battle just to take as much XP as possible. I give zero shits if anyone thinks that's taking advantage. Also, when i reach the needed level of damage on the SBQ, I use to take photos of the battle, sometimes with very nice results
---
Just finished the first 1/3 of the board. I’ve completed all the weeklies so far and missed one day of dailies. I also don’t do the NW dailies.
---
I explained in the post
---
It's really my fault, and not theirs.
---
You can use the perk pack bubblegums as well...provided you save them and not instantly use them
---
I cutlet interact with him today at all
---
Rumble can be done solo but not to top reward rank. I've done it using a stealth suit on a bloodied build so can one shot most the ghouls. The trick then is to keep the turrets working as they will distract the ghouls. You only need time ti sneak off and grab 25 ore then sit in the middle and protect the scavengers. Don't deliver the ore until a few seconds before finish so you don't get steamrolled by deathclaws and it's doable.
---
Nothing gives you xp like killing super mutants.
---
Unless he took bag and lied to you it is his fault.
---
So u dropped your legendarys on the ground. And rejoined the same server with your friend and they were gone or did the whole server crash and kick u both
---
The inspirational perk will also boost exp with the public team feature, even if you're the only one in the team. Specials can also be boosted with herd mentality mutation for a bit of extra int as well. While farming the burrows, you can collect gut shrooms while you're there and cook them for easy exp, no other ingredients needed besides wood for cooking.
---
Edit: also, the lunchboxes from score rewards are another +25% exp if that wasn't listed in the info you looked up.
---
Yeah. I blew through like 700 5mm bullets. Got through about 350 and thought 'is it worth it?', but I had already committed myself, so just kept shooting. Never once did I stop.
---
It was worth it, though. Got what I wanted. Gained a couple of levels (yay 4x XP plus the lunchboxes), and walked away with the plans for the radiation shower thing.
---
Nope
---
That’s good
---
Still no.
---
I just hit rank 27
---
I was the only one that crashed. The legendaries didn't drop, I was in the process of dropping them. I hadn't left the pip boy menu.
---
I'm sure radiation rumble is insanely difficult nigh impossible solo right? I mean I'm sure someone will say they've done it, but still. I doubt you can top reward it and keep people alive solo.
---
You can do PP solo just not top reward all 3 animals I imagine. Nothing else springs to mind.
---
Fair enough. Are you confident of completing the whole board?
---
I'm a sneeze away from getting my hands on the Sheepsquatch Plushie.😁
---
Are you kidding? Today's was place C.A.M.P. down once?l log in Menu, place, log out. So easy. Wish it were like this often. Easy. Well sarcasm aside. Yeah if it's too hot in the kitchen just stay out.
---
Only reliable place I've found a handful is the Dam. The other places that used to be full of them like the prison, the NW lumberyard, and others I remember ( I played before wastelanders) now have ghouls,scorched, or raiders in them. Suggestions of where?
---
If your doing quests join a building team with hopefully 3 other people and get bonded. It will do it after a certain amount of time you don't have to actually be close to them for the team to bond. The event feeding the people will grant you a canned food that will give you 5% xp. Sleeping in a bed will also grant 5 % xp and pretty much anything with cranberry (mentants, jelly, soda ECT) will also give an xp bonus. All of those things only give the bonus for like an hour sometimes more so you will have to keep an eye on how long you have so make sure their active when you complete anything. If your doing events with a lot of things to kill keep the team on building until the last second and then switch the team goal to event and you will get a lot more xp for completing the event and switch it back after, you will even keep the team bond switching back and forth
---
People have been exploiting god mode since beta
---
Why are you being a sheep about grind mechanics? Like you love this ridiculous grind
---
Yeah, I usually purchase them in threes at 300 to 500 a piece.  When i saw 12 at 50 caps i had to buy them all and share by nuking fissure prime into the ground.  Much mirth was had by all.
---
The chance of getting the top legendaries like BFFR, JFFR etc in an desirable weapon is so low that it's not really an issue.
---
Also all the new weapons are non-tradeable making the odds even worse.
---
I have gotten perhaps 6 top legendary over the last 2 months, and that's after a ton of scripts on an alt (fasnacht leftovers) and a lot of queen/legendary kills.
---
2 of the weapons I currently use myself, 1 i sold and 3 I transfered to an alt as I'm saving it incase I ever want to use it myself on main or alt or if they do a weapons balance patch.
---
But you are right, slow as it might be in the end I will get too many guns to realistically save up. I might open up an 100% afk shop on my alt while I do something totally different on my main.
---
Weird. If u didn’t drop them
---
They shouldn’t have vanished.
---
yes each mutation that it works on should say a positive and a negative. the negative would be made weaker
---
I see you had the need to assert moral superiority over others, today.  Congrats if you feel better.  Explosive rounds filling my screen and sound system is distracting, so that's a negative impact to the experience.  Also, it isnt a waste of my time to return fire on someone insofar as the entirety of my playing the game isn't a waste of time.  Very simple to understand: if you shoot at someone it shouldn't be a surprise when they shoot back at you.  I dont take their loot, fwiw.
---
Nope not really, only logging into do the challenges, don’t actually bother with anything else. There is a calculator on here somewhere where you can figure out if you’ll make it.. do a search
---
You're clearly a badass wastelander
---
No.  I have hit the end of section one just by doing the dailies and some levelling.  No need to give up my precious atoma.
---
No, I’m going to be playing the game anyways why rush it? 
---
\*Maybe\* if we are down to the last week and I’m just a couple of ranks away from 100 I’ll use some of the atoms that I eanred from doing the SCORE to buy the last couple of ranks, but I see no reason to buy my way to the top, at least not right now.
---
I don’t think it’s exploits. I have gone from level 1 to 167 in 2 months time and I don’t play more then 3 hours a day. I use a ton of consumables and wear Unyielding armor. The higher your intelligence the faster you level up due to intelligence effecting the xp gains.
---
Apologies for the wrong information I guess I’ve been wasting a lot of time
---
You can find it around or make it in the chemistry work bench
---
Nope. I'm level 44 and it's going to get INSANELY grindy later, considering my SCORE per level is already double the start. 
---
It's only going to get worse from there, so anyone who wants to finish it without spending endless cash would be wise to save their "free pass" until the last possible moments, whether that be the actual end or as far as they can get, because it's easier to grind levels for 1-2k than for a lot higher later. 
---
You also get 10 levels "free" worth of atoms from doing the board. I reckon the smart thing is to save all the paying for levels for as late as possible so you're not stuck and unwilling to grind later when it's insane.
---
Think I'm at 45, or just before it
---
I usually run in a group of 4, unyielding, lots of XP buffs, and do wes tek runs or solo runs
---
I had hit R to drop them, and they had gone from my inventory. They just hadn't appeared on the ground yet. they only do once you exit the menu which I couldn't because I crashed.
---
How much do you trust your friend? ha
---
You can from any of them I believe.
---
Take it off and read your mutations list in your pipboy. Put it back on and read it again.
---
And the place camp one today. This was my first time doing NW and was like "I bet I can accomplish that in a few seconds."
---
Hell yes...got to lvl 40...I’m done lvlin up once a day...@lvl413 it’s a lot of XP per lvl.
---
Chemistry workbench, noted,  cheers!
---
Here it is: 
---
I'll double-check, but you're probably right. If so, that's even *worse* and explains why only like 3 weapons can be exchanged.
---
Aww that’s shitty luck. Did u lose anything good?
---
Intelligence is the main factor for gaining XP. If yours is low, try using berry mentats and cooking up Int boosting food. Unyielding armor gives the biggest Int buff, and a lot of people run low health builds just for that reason.
---
Also, kill all the super mutants and do every event you see.
---
You should be slapped; don't talk about your aunt like that.
---
Im on rank 33 or 34
---
Prison still has them outside in the yard.
---
I know it! I wonder if Perk Pack gum counts.
---
100 %. There is more then enough time to complete it and requirements are not hard for it. You will do it too, don't worry!
---
I don't think that is what they are saying. They are saying that, for example, if your repeatable had 5000/10000, it would reset back to 0/10000. So that 5000 exp didn't matter. So basically you want to get it as close to 0 as possible before you sign off to avoid doing extra work for nothing.

---
Considering how fast you can do the dailies/weeklies, no. I will see where i'm at when the season is ending and decide then if i want/need to buy the last ranks. Got \~12k atoms rotting away.
---
Depends what build. If you wanna run about with like no health. Bloodied. If ye like drugs, go junkies. The safe option would be vampires, furious, anti armor
---
People force themselves to do this ? I've never played NW and don't intend to, not even for Dailies or Weeklies. Just say NO.
---
I've started buying all the plans from npc vendors now. Started with all the cheapest ones. Now all that's left is the ones above 500 caps. And then i'll buy all the PA plans. And then.. who knows
---
If you are not dialed in on a build yet, look for furious, Anti-armor, and executioners.  Faster fire rate, vats crit damage, and explosive are the best secondary effects.
---
Bloodied and junkies are the highest damage but take committed builds.
---
Since i found my "magic" instigating +40% bashing damage shotgun Not even one other weapon or build makes sense to play. Its so frustrating to oneshot everything.
---
I'm gonna pay for the last 10 levels
---
Why don’t you just make a new character for the leveling up challenges?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXeU3uMfFjc
---
The Dam, West Tek, Summersville, New Gad off the top of my head
---
edit: Grafton Steel?
---
I have about 3k atoms saved. I will probably skip the last 20 levels but I will definitely not pay to get to the end.
---
Just hit 34 today.  Usually playing for 1-2 hours a day.  I’m skipping the NW challenges unless I can be sure to get it done in one or two matches and doesn’t require RNG or other players (e.g. survive so many minutes or place your camp)
---
Fully.
---
1. Never drop rare or Legendry's onto the floor. I have learned this the hard way.
---
2. If you MUST either trade or leave them in a container.
---
3. People are nice in 76 but not all are. Don't trust everyone you meet.   
---
An also don't get to upset about losing Legs. Nowa days its really easy to grind 100's in no little time.   
---
:D
---
Your friend has them...lol
---
Good to a lower to mid level player like me? Yes. Good to the level 300 players, possibly not.
---
No! That would make to much sense.
---
I have those for mules can’t move them to save their lives.
---
Are u Xbox?
---
I thought it was because we were all obsessively masturbating, but you do got a point.
---
Sucks man, you'd think you would still have them because you technically never dropped them. Always a fear of mine dropping guns in a bag
---
Negative -5 charisma because you suck
---
&gt; There we go! You finally got it!
---
And still you dont get it, NW = Trash.
---
You can play trash if you want, im not gatekeeping, still trash is trash.
---
It works fine for me i have the both common Mutations matisupidupi ( the high jump/ + carry weight) and the bird bones ( reduce falling damage and some Thing Else) when i switch to Super duper perk to make some stuff i put class freak out since i only have 5 points in luck. When Not having it equipped it displays me -4 agi -4 str. When reequiping it back it displays me - 1agi - 1str. So working for me.
---
It also explodes into a random direction for everyone, which is just a fantastic feature when the game already lacks a loot highlight system...
---
Not till the last week or so and I'll see how far I've gotten. Just doing my daily's and weekly's and playing and I'm at level 35. Pretty easy grind .
---
I'm fine with not completing the whole board - my goal from day one was the Super Sledge skin since I run a melee build, and anything else is a bonus really. If I get close to something really good with the last few weeks I'll probably push to do more of the dailies to get there.
---
That part of the game I don't care at all. My camp is a brick cube with door an Windows. Also, I find more inmersive and accurate having a crappy camp.
---
I love original camps tho
---
A 970 is not a high end graphics card so you're not going to get good performance out of a game like this. Disable grass, motion blur and depth of field in your ini file. Turn shadow distance down to low and then restart the game.
---
No. I'm not planning on paying for any levels. Not even with the atoms you fet from it. If I get as far as getting the blood Eagle skin for the rifle then I'm happy. Anything after that is a bonus. There isn't anything after that I would use - I've no interest in the cosmos  power armour or the costumes, don't care for the ghillie skins so if i miss any i don't care. I kind of like the door but I likely won't use it anyway. 
---
That said, I probably would pay if I reached level 99 and there was no time in which to earn the required xp to get to 100. That would be fair enough I think.
---
oh
---
Perrrssonnnaallly I like both the hopeful and the desolate vibe. I don't think all of America was hit the same way. Considering DC is barely habitable and the people are more likely to be morally deprived- it makes sense that the ambience would be depressing. 
---
West Virginia is brimming with life, people have the luxury to look for gold rather than fussing over purified water.. the desolate vibe wouldn't work so well.
---
And make those unique, really over the top insults! So that the players knows he's a special douche! And tell them who sent the bot, at least via note, but speech would be better...
---
"I myself, XYZ and especially your mom would like to let you know that you're a very bland, and really uninteresting, boring human being. I know you think you're cool, but scientifically proven fact is, you're not. Change your ways. Get a life."
---
"There are people who like you! I know, it's rather puzzling, seeing XYZ, your ex-girlfriend, your mother and numerous others didn't like you, but it's true. Unfortunately, those people have been dead for decades now."
---
(I know, your mom jokes, but I think that would hit many times - and I'm open for suggestions)
---
That wouldn't put somebody on the second part of the board by now, unless they were grinding for XP.
---
I would even settle for plans being sell-able to the vendors, for at least a little money. Right now known dupe plans are like missles, arrows and mini-nukes. I just drop em and move on.
---
Secret Service Jetpack....enough said!
---
That guy down there says that it does.

Yea those ones are fine. I enjoy Nuclear Winter but I'm not in the mood for it every day. Some of the challenges (kill creatures and revive players) seem a little bit too random and require a decent amount more effort than most of the adventure mode challenges. In my eyes it's not always worth it for the 250 SCORE.
---
Yeah, I understood that. Re-read OPs post and you'll understand my comment.
---
That kind of depends what you want to do. Junkies is always popular.
---
They don't. Others were watching anyway.
---
My last two SBQ runs cost me over 3k in bullets and 20+ minutes each since there were only two others and myself at a high enough level with a decent weapon. Do I blame the other 10-15 people that are &lt;lvl70? Hellz no! I remember being a low level and trying my hardest to help but it would never amount to much. If you help kill the mobs, I'm a happy SBQ killer and wish you all the best 3 star goodies.
---
Yeah if I'm looking at an expensive weapon and thinking it over I always buy something cheap first so they hear the cha-ching sound on their end and don't log off lol
---
PC
---
It's 1/10 now
---
Saw the Encryptid event pop-up. Read the lvl 50 recommendation. I was lvl 50. Surely it meant i was strong enough!
---
Mistakes were made.
---
I had my random teammates jump off Flatwoods bridge cus everybody was doing it lol
---
I would also guess alot of players that stopped playing are coming back due to all the updates perhaps
---
Seems like a waste of money to me, but if people want to spend atoms, go for it I say.
---
In most cases it provides very little. It only does enough damage to kill the weakest enemies in the game. It no longer causes PvP to process with pacifist on but there isn't really much of an advantage to running the mutation. If it didn't also damage the user then maybe but it's lackluster.
---
God mode more than likely. Farming xp like crazy. All getting banned ofc
---
At level 35. I do easy NW challenges and when I dont want to do them I make sure to grind out 300 or 400 score in regular adventure to compensate for them.
---
You would've thought combat rifle skins would be applicable. But nah they'll make fixer paints more than likely
---
"Do you even bloodied, bro?"
---
Yes plz. Make the ammo machine accept points. Im so much more down with that. Also make it sell bulk ammo scrap.
---
That would be a really solid mechanic
---
First Round NW... dropped from a cliff with 30 sec in.
---
Too soon to even think about it.
---
*I am aware that robots usually cannot fart, but we added this  especially for you.*
---
You dont need to do every single challenge daily
---
Idk why but I don’t like the idea of ammo converters at train stations.
---
Mine has done that since February but only with select weapons. My Gatling plasma and my Gauss Rifle to be exact. Never lets me quick switch to them.
---
Wait what?
---
That would make the Season ammo converter actually worth building, honestly. It's more trouble than it's worth in its current state, but if those ammo points actually came from elsewhere in the game, I might bother using it. Being able to more readily supplement my perpetually-low aluminium and spring supplies, rather than the useless (to me) small-arms ammo types that events keep giving me, and without having to waste time converting them myself, would be a godsend.
---
If the mules don't have junk you can throw a plasma grenade at your feet and respawn on someone near a stove. If the character is low enough just cook a bunch of food or something. You can level them and throw on weight reduction perks.
---
Shame I’d have helped u out. Don’t give up. Shit happens. X
---
I'm digging it, but I've had Lone Wanderer on since launch. Now that it's not an auto-include I feel like I'm looking at the charisma tree for the first time.
---
I will be paying just to catch up. I've been on vacation and haven't been able to play hardly for like a week. I'll probably buy like 10 levels with the atoms I have saved up, but I'm not gonna pay for the whole thing. Lol
---
Fortunately, you're the only person in here that thinks this back-assward way about the subject.     
---
They're getting loot, so the game considers them to be contributing.    
---
Now kindly remove your misinformed BS about the boss's health; that crap has been debunked over and over. It's just the polite and decent thing to do.
---
Nah I just like to have fun with my extra mini nukes.
---
Naughty you...
---
They all share the same weight
---
That didn't last long it's gone back to the usual amount today, thanks bethesda!
---
Correct.  And I don't.  I just post suggestions on how to improve this system.
---
It's insane to me Bethesda has yet to address it. Then again, there are a lot more pressing issues that still havent been addressed. I really do wonder how many people are assigned to keeping this game running and content flowing.
---
That's a good idea, too! The insult note should have the name of the sender, though - so they don't stack and a) slow down the inventory down even more and b) make you aware of how many people hate you viewing the notes in Pipboy.
---
I used an app to make my character look older.
---
This is what we call rim lighting. If anyone knows how to turn it off in 76 let me know
---
Damn i was hoping i could pack more stuff inside
---
It's a very tedious process.
---
And thus  , the monster is unleashed:)
---
everything under "stash boxes" connects to your main stash. the only way to expand your stash is with the scrap box via buying Fallout 1st, and that just gives you infinite junk storage.
---
go through your stash box. scrap any non-legendaty weapons/armor you dont use, and bring the legendary ones yiy dont plan to use/sell to a scrip machine. after breaking down all your junk, bulk anything you have more than 100 of and sell it to an npc vendor. and get the ammo converter from the season rewards, and dump any ammo you dont use into it. the interface may be a pain but it'll cpear up a lot of space.
---
Swing your partner do-si-do
---
Interesting. I have her chair inside of a firepit, it does nothing for the noise but it helps me cope mentally
---
Brotherhood is a fan favorite, it’s smart to go for the one that they know people like instead of the one that could swing either way.
---
I'm the inverse, I have no use for all the 10mm, 5.56, .38, and .45 I always seem to get. Being able to restock on 40mm grenades and fusion cores instead would help prevent me from constantly running out of aluminium and springs.
---
Yep get your int high i had like 10 and reached level 50 from scrap in like 1 month Maybe a bit more. Ofc ive been playing much but one level for playing 4-6 hours Sounds impossible for me. Im Level 94 now and still gain 1-3 levels in my 1-3 hr Sessions.
---
For me it got easy when you can manage to safely kill scorched ghouls as they give ~180 XP per ghoul and have like 0 defense. Then Events like the guided Meditation, where many of them spawn will let the XP just roll over your Face.
---
Another tip is the fort defiance Event even if youre Low level, try to Grab a machine gun like cal 50 oder Mini gun and Hit as many scorched as you can. Two or three Hits is enough to get you the full XP when someone Else kills it afterwards. Same for sbq, shit on her just try to Hit All the small stuff once or twice so you will get full XP then when the guy with his be gaus minigun kills it.
---
&gt; "balls deep"
---
I'm not sure, but I think I found your main problem here. Or your kink maybe. As I said, not sure...
---
/wheeze
---
Double xp will be a breeze with my magic shotgun and gat plasma
---
Good idea!! I’d like to see the players level when you hover over their camp on the map. I’m always looking for armor or outfits. Would rather go to a level 200 with 6 pieces of armor than a level 38 with 22 pieces.
---
i plan to get as far as i can and then use atoms i've been stockpiling for months on the last day to cover however far i need to finish.
---
I agree.  I think this is the most difficult one to solo, but it can be done.  I've done it, but haven't lately because it is a lot of work and the reward is never gonna be a top tier item unless you are on a team and have help.
---
This comment has serious pengu1nofd00m vibes
---
Ah, a person of culture as well, I see. Bring on the heavy ammo!
---
I would love a terminal we could build at our camp to shop the player vendors that are on our instance at that time. It could be even modeled around a Vendor bot that "goes and gets" our stuff.
---
Oh no my insides hurt after reading this.
---
I want the fireplace door, the hanging tree, and the Sheepsquatch plushie, which I would have earned today if I had the challenges to do.    
---
I hope they fix it, too.  This is the only major bug I've had with the season stuff.
---
PSA: this is fucking obsolete information as they subtracted these challenges again.
---
I have been making sure to to do the daily quests, it’s been about 3 days now and ONE of the daily quests for Raiders still hasn’t been available or reset. I always check my pip boy data tab throughly, the quests just don’t reset daily
---
Yes, the use of the events group is the most contentious.  The others are viewed as more casual (or maybe less directive) play or are treated as more casual.
---
Someone above mentioned communication being important.  I agree with that assessment and I also agree that it's somewhat difficult to communicate things like "I need to go to my stash" etc.
---
I think you summed it up rather well with  "...but don't get annoyed if people in a public team on an online game with no specific goal don't do exactly what you want them to do."
---
When dealing with people there are just always more considerations than the rigid/singular pursuit of a objective.
---
Thanks for contributing.  You made good points.
---
Rank 38. Wish I was further but I'll finish so whatever :p
---
I had no idea that Int affected your XP gain. Learned something new. I'll look into upping mine through SPECIAL and buffs. thanks!
---
We'll talk September 15th...
---
Not to mention you literally linked an article that says ***ABOUT*** 10 weeks
---
It helps not waste ammo. A lvl 5 ghoul will just drop dead after hitting you.
---
Since when were the Brotherhood and Enclave mortal enemies? It's not as though they exist to fight each other. Sure, Roger Maxson founded the Brotherhood in response to the Mariposa experiments, the sort of thing the Enclave would do, but he's long dead by the time the Brotherhood even learn of them.
---
I have gotten that one as well
---
No.  But if I was, I'd wait until the end levels because they will be the hardest to get legitimately.
---
Check if you have any items you don't need in your stash. Like 40mm rounds or mini nukes. The things that take up too much that you don't need
---
Maps is getting a bit crowded. We now have the responders, raiders, foundation, enclave, BOS and free states that we do quests for. In person there will be foundation, raiders and BOS, as well as random settlers, blood eagles, super mutants, mole miners, and scortched. Won't be able to throw a rock without hitting a fetch quest. As for the BOS, we all know how it will work out. Plot quest followed by grind quests to get the carrot of the week. Just do you and take solace in the fact once you get what you want you can farm them for experience with whatever gadgets they where kind enough to let you buy from them after basically saving the world for them. I'm just happy I grinded out the elder paint job so I can flex on them when they show up.
---
Some people always check the map to be sure someone is around before they log off. As in, exactly then.
---
How do I get a ammo converter?
---
I just did the quest for the key in the temple that has Guided Meditation. I forgot about that event. I'll keep an eye out for it. Thanks!
---
I'll just spend all my atoms on it if it's the last day of it and im not max rank, I NEED THAT GOOD LOOT!!
---
    Boom. Roasted.
---
I lost out on 1750 SCORE today.  I did not know it was an issue until it happened to me and I started checking on it.  Man, Bethesda ... this was one of the better things you've done, and now my heart's just not in it because I probably won't make it to the end.
---
Shit I got my fingers crossed I stumble upon your camp sometime
---
Why does varied currency matter
---
Good call. I forgot the prison yard in the back. That even patrols through there, too.
---
Can the insult variations be the different kinds of buffs like if he hits you with something hard like I heard you got drunk and missed exiting Vault 76 on time. Too bad you didn't do the same thing before entering it! You get instigated but if he hits you with something like 
---
Vault dweller, 2054 called. They want their dumb blue jumpsuit back. You only get slightly furious: 2 percent more damage each hit
---
In the patch 20 notes it says “the next 10 weeks”. Not about. Not almost.
---
This is what the inside the vault says which came out 2 days after patch 20. 
---
&gt;	The Legendary Run (Available Now!) — We kicked off our first Season, called “The Legendary Run,” with Update 20 a few days ago. Hop in-game now to complete Daily and Weekly Challenges, earn S.C.O.R.E., and claim tons of rewards—including plenty of stellar new cosmetic items—for free over the next 10 weeks.
---
That is what my link says. I don’t know why you ignore that just because another sentence is not as precise lol
---
Completely agree with this.  Even an emote to the effect of 'I need to take a second' or 'stashbox!' would be beneficial.
---
I used to give people discounts for closing the door behind themselves at my camp because it was a pet peeve.
---
Just passed West Tek a few nights ago. I'll go back and give it a run through. Thanks!
---
Ok dude don’t know what to tell you. Not been grinding at all, literally just logging in to do dailies. Running a bloodied build so maybe earning more XP quicker than you with kill 10 of this and 10 of that, so getting through that extra 100 score from 10k xp more often.
---
This is so true. I have a table set up with a message "free stuff, enjoy" that I'll throw down just to give away!
---
Which one?
---
Or you could just get 30,000 xp during a session and that makes up for the NW daily. It’s really not that hard honestly. There’s several food buffs that give you an xp bonus. If you’ve got any lunch boxes that helps. 
---
Go to areas that have a lot of creatures and have fun.
---
Because it’d suck ass? The values would be so bad and it’s already too easy to reach cap. I’d prefer OP’s idea of converting them into different ones
---
*BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
---
With the influx of new players best bet is to check low level vendors
---
OMG, somebody get this guy a desk and a paycheck.  Damn good idea!
---
Every time I’ve used the raider radio guy he’s given me a quest to go kill some wendigo and I’ve gotten jack shit from it
---
Finished it 4 days ago after about 81 hours.  I like the rewards more than I thought I would and rethemed my entire camp around them.  Don't mind people being able to pay to win the system as I have already had the satisfaction of reaching the end before that was option was made available.  Though my efforts will not be as easily seen to other players I come across after said system is released, I will know that I reached the goal on my own will and that is what matters.
---
I played it when it first came out, and enjoyed it, but there were so many problems I got burnt out pretty quickly. 
---
Just decided to start playing again about a week ago, and I’m having a blast! 
---
I definitely think this game is vastly improved from the early days.
---
I wish there was better communication. The only way to communicate with your group at the moment is emotes which also display locally so it's difficult to even know if your team mate is talking to you.
---
I can understand if they don't want to implement text chat because of the issues with moderating what people are saying to each other. But a good cross-platform alternative could be some set phrases you can send to your group, similar to the emote wheel, just with some common phrases. Stuff like "Let's do this event!" and some responses like "Yes" "No" "Give me a few minutes!". Could even extend to stuff like "Does anyone need help?" or "Does anybody want [x] item?". It would just help more than the cryptic emotes which have lots of different interpretations based on when and where they're used and who's reading them.
---
I find that the lighting has been perfectly dark once I put the Glow in the Dark Stars wallpaper on the walls. It made it darker than any other wallpaper with no light.
---
That would be cool.
---
I don’t plan on buying any levels till later when the cost starts going up.
---
That and people shooting the floor or walls.  Its no longer perfect!!
---
44.  Not doing NW.   It is going faster than I thought it would.. so far.
---
I've had people walk right past me, even before the Ghillie suit, while I was hiding in a bush.  It was great!
---
Pretty common, I've gotten like three.
---
You've completed the whole thing?! Just from the repeatable SCORE?
---
Last time I did this event I went through like 60ish stims being a conduit. That was like half of what I had at the time. Quite painful.
---
Xbox? Lol
---
Is the cap limit over 25,000 now?
---
use an explosive bow (normal bow, craft explosive frame into it), launches corpses away
---
Im just trying to earn a living here in the wasteland lol. Cant sell serums without the materials to make em.
---
the game crushes more than usual + problems with internet/beth servers. sometimes it is all about that (at least in my case)
---
(looks at Legendary Run)... maybe?
---
Haven't really tried melee weapons because I assume I'll be gunned down before getting close to them.  Maybe I'll try one.  Stealth boys seem rare, one shot items so wouldn't help much.
---
Np but dont forget It will spawn level 68 scorched ghouls if i rwmember right like 2 Hits of them sent me to heaven when i Was level 37ish 😂
---
maybe when im in the 70s or 80s where its alot of points.
---
That won't actually display the toilet paper. But that feature will promised in future update. That never seems to come.
---
Yea I'm wary that it'll slow down the further I get. I'm still levelling decently at the moment (normally get two rewards a day) but the big bump on Tuesdays will definitely start slowing down. Hopefully the new stuff releasing and other events will help it kind of just exist in the background as an additional benefit rather than the whole gameplay loop itself.
---
Sadly no!
---
Yeah 30,000
---
Absolutely crazy that I posted this BEFORE they changed them.
---
34. I got dailies glitched on me once(1500 gone) and skip the NW daily whenever it looks annoying(so like 75% of the time) but otherwise i've done the quests every day.
---
The event is about formula P lol
---
Cripple the legs of the ghouls, wait untill you have reached the cap of enemies spawned, have fun walking past immobile bags of irradiated meat and collect the ore.
---
leget, do events, and pick the legendaries just to gift off to the low levels at the event for scripping...  im maxed beyond max, and have decent stuff, i rarely get anything worth more than scrip these days... i dont knowi need more scrap... but something other than ditching them in the turf pile would be nice...
---
That's honestly the most negative thing there is. 99% of my interactions have been positive. Most people haven't been assholes at all. The community is far less toxic than most.
---
That other 1% though can be a doozie. I've learned to stash my junk before visiting camps because of Punji Board trap camps, and I've learned no direct trades.
---
Dammit!! Always the way...
---
What's that gotten you to? Early 30s?
---
I believe it's 30,000
---
I'm 6 levels behind you and can easily level up in less than an hour. Plus you get even more SCORE from the weekly repeatable than from the actual level up challenge while doing it. If you're having trouble leveling maybe you should research some better farming runs and tips for efficiently earning exp.
---
It only kills very low level enemies, and if you ever want to use an Instigating weapon, it's bad to have any of the passive damage ones (electrically charged, unstable isotope, and plague walker) because they'll count as a first hit and make your instigating weapon do less damage.
---
I was running all three and much prefer it with them off. 
---
Also, plague walker kills passive critters like bunnies. No me gusta.
---
wait....
---
fertilizer doesn't break down into acid does it?
---
Sorry to hear you're in the same boat. I put a ticket in, and it was a good thing I wasn't holding my breath for anything other than a brush off. Customer services forwarded it to the devs, and I guess the devs have pushed it to the bottom of the 'it may get fixed or not' work pile!
---
Same name?
---
If you can't do it. Level up.
---
Like. There's no need to hurry. On my 2nd account (which now my main) i didn't do the rose quests until 120
---
Ammo converter is not great. I spent some time doing the “convert” and now I just drop unwanted ammo at the first overseer camp for any newbies to pick up. Lol.
---
Not that I have trouble...far from it....I just want to play and not have to run the routes and burn out.
---

Demanding people do things that benefit him, belittling anyone who disagrees, triple salty replies to the same person, whole shebang. Fun read

"Thanks Todd!"
---
Like previous poster said, if you are going to YouTube for guides, angry turtle is your guy.
---
Ah, so it is a few more steps? I haven't really been able to find one let alone find time to plug in my Xbox in general. At least sounds better than just dropping mass amounts of ammo I just don't use and can't sell.
---
I'm gonna wait until the end. I should be able to make it into the 90s at least and at that point the amount paid is pretty reasonable for what you get at the end.
---
Love the Mire so much for the lighting and general tone of the locale.  Shortly after I finished the run I redid my camp in a secluded nook to take full effect of double siding the wallpaper and making a secret passage to a room themed as "Cryptids From Space".  The only shame is that it is best viewed at night so some visitors don't get the best experience.
---
The rarely seen people doing shit like that wont stop by reading your nicely written reddit post. I mean i get your point but its useless to write it down here.
---
Just Block that guys psn ID or xbox or steam Pendant of it and you will have a good day enyoing the Sun, wearing shorts while playing fo76 love and Peace to you
---
Same here, i was super lucky at around lvl 60 i got a B/FFR/25AP gauss rifel I was so happy its just resting in my stash for the day the fix it. And all the ammo for that thing is just dropped with the missiles and nukes( yeah I cold use the ammo converter but you know they also did a fantastic job with that)🤣 
---
I roll with a TS/E/RW lever, a GS/E/25AP lever, a TS/FFR handmade and a MU/E/25AP handmade and full uny buttressed secret service armor. Well you should think this lvl 255 guy should do ok, mostly i do. But yeah but today was just a mess, its was the worst I died so many times because my 95% vats miss all the time. 
---
I'm just at that point where I'm thinking  to make a new character/rebuild for a build with melee and heavy guns so I just can skip the vats 🤣 Bethesda fix it. And also the dying respawn problem thats nearly worse as a bloodied build 🎤drop
---
Triple check the junk tab for unscrapped junk, Aid for spoiled meat/veggies and Inert Flux, Ammo for any type you don't use commonly. And.. whatever hardened Mass is under, can't remember, they gulp space and are really common off nuked mobs compared to High Rad Fluids.
---
I feel like it would be ran more like the ammo converter and im just not going to ask for that again selling 1 plan gets you 10 plan point buying a rare plan cost 1000
---
The basics of high xp gains.
---
Intelligence is the key. 1 point is = 2%. So if your max perk intell out to 15 it's 30%xp gains on EVERYTHING you do that makes xp. Craft, cook, kill, events etc
---
Rested bonus from sleeping in any bed for 40 sec. = 5% xp gains.  Note of you die this bonus is removed so remember this. 
---
Cranberry relish = 10% xp gains. Cranberry cobbler can be made for 5% xp gains. These do not stack.
---
Join the public buildings team for upto 4 points of intell.= 8% xp gains. 
---
If you can find the mutation Herd mentality and are able to perk out starch genes in Luck this will add +3 intell for 6% xp gains. 
---
Chem Daddy O gives 3-4 points intell 
---
Chem Berry Mentats gives 5 points intell. Again these cannot be stacked. 
---
If you can get some scorchbeast brains this adds 3?points intell. 
---
So it's easy to make some serious gains with these simple additions to your gameplay. 
---
 don't worry about being with your team, do your thing and use them for the boosts. 
---
Also takeover the workshops on the west side of the map. Don't build anything other than a turret or a fence and go take the next one. Wait for the hostile takeover from NPC message to pop up and go kill the low level mole rats etc and make more xp from reclaiming. 
---
Intelligence is the key. 👍
---
The only issue I see with this being implemented is when you're at or near the ammo point cap. For instance, I'm at 1990/2000 right now and if I earned 200 points, I would lose almost all of my reward. At least when I earn unwanted ammo, it ends up in my inventory even when it makes me overencumbered.
---
Fuck no. Even if they hotfix all the bugs tonight, I wont on principle.
---
I still haven't launched a nuke in NW, I may try that at some point now I have the perks.
---
Well, the preferred route is the website. However, if you don't feel like being polite you can most likely find enough clues to their org chart. Once you have an idea of who's in the chain of command you can start self escalating your ticket by attempting to reach the higher ups directly through phone or email.
---
And yet so perfectly Fallout.
---
This is why I love the building team. I consider that to be the actual casual team in terms of everyone using it for general xp gain while mostly doing whatever you want. But if I'm in an event team it means im focusing on event hopping, which i only like to do if there are a lot of other high level players doing the same thing. Its crazy how much more fun events have become.
---
I agree. One trick I use is to sit on the computer so no one can start it until I do
---
I could be wrong on this but Marine armor should offer some of the highest DR in the game for non-power armor with an exception being Secret Service armor.
---
It was my understanding that Marine Armor = better DR than Scout Armor but weighs more.
---
Combat, leather, metal, etc should all have less DR than marine and scout.
---
If you DM later Ill hook you up. Most people including myself are drowning in legendaries atm so as long as you're not asking for a bloodied/junkies god roll I can drop you a few. What weapons were you using.
---
agree 100% - would also like this for the new vendor bot. Its songs are cute, but not when I'm building or doing stuff around my CAMP and want to keep vendors open for others.
---
Now that Secret Service armor is out, I haven’t seen any reason to keep any other armor types...
---
I did all the dailies and weeklies available as well aside the 30 minute NW one, which IMO was a waste of time  not worth the 250.  The rest was pure grind.  My post details the lengths I went to during.
---
I think I know what you’re talking about, it happens to me every once in awhile. I usually switch weapons in the pipboy or reload and that fixes it
---
I’ve seen other people (from older reddit posts) day it was barely better than trapper armor. But did they buff it?
---
It's ugly as sin.
---
LOL that'd be hilarious
---
Free Range herder and ore collector right here. Herding in Free Range is fine for me - I just favourite the crook and whenever there's an attack I can switch back and forth to help out. I normally keep an eye out for the sheepsquatch so I get a hit in in time. People not collecting ore at radiation rumble confuses me a bit though - a high level player with an explosive weapon can hold down one side, so it's a bit of a waste not getting the ore. Pop your PA on and you can scrub rads for free right in the central area, and it's the only way you can get the best rewards.
---
I'm always happy when someone launches a nuke though. I can do it but it's definitely a chore and I love it when I can just do the SBQ and get the rewards with less hassle.
---
He knows. He just wants to vent. I get it :)
---
7500 caps.  I also have a 2* Boodied Mole Tier Gauntlet with fss for 10000 caps.
---
It makes a cool sound when you whack something!
---
I just got a 3* berserkers shovel
---
Once I was wandering in the mire and came across someone camp at night. They had no lights and it was PITCH black, honestly scared me exploring their house lol. 
---
So go to the mire it is super dark there
---
Edit I see u mentioned tht my bad. I agree that nights should be darker in the rest of the areas too
---
Can you not buy them from the Enclave vendors anymore? I bought both from Enclave vendors over a year ago. Didn't realize they were rare when I came back and sold them for way too cheap.
---
Forgot to add but +1 strength too
---
Isn’t Gold Bullion the only way to get Secret Service armor? If so I haven’t done the vault raid thing.
---
Yep, that fixed it! Thanks, now I can get back in action. Any idea what caused that?
---
This! The perk sharing has been a lot of fun too
---
I have actually never looked at the stats on Trapper although I assumed it was in between combat and marine. But like the other person said in this thread, Secret Service is the best all around choice. It is just a grind to get it.
---
Until then I’d use whatever you like more between marine and scout
---
Not keen on helping them either. I mean, my first interaction with them was in Fallout 1 and, due to me playing a low int character, I got laughed at and sent to the Glow. 
---
23 years ago they made a mistake. Now they'll pay. ;)
---
Mini nukes have hella points as do missiles.
---
What would you like to know about the cards? 
---
I'll answer other questions, if you got em, too.
---
Non legendary Polished Metal Arms an Legs offered me 54 DR and 116 on the chest piece. (plus mods for rad resist)
---
Metal has the highest DR other than SS...an even my 3* buttressed SS right arm is 53 Dr and my chest piece is 90.
---
To me most of the armor looks ugly, but I think it’s neat.
---
Yes you have to complete the Wastelanders quest line in order to purchase the plans with bullion.
---
I does! Very funny to use
---
Wow kudos! I guess you've got a few weeks where you can lord it over the rest of us with your fancy PA skins and secret fireplace!
---
It's a radius, I read a post about another player shooting a tree and backing up to test. The player said it doesn't increase explosive legendary effect radius, but I still use it anyway. I'm hoping the new legendary perks are effected by demo and grenadier to create a blooming effect similar to end game Psycho in Borderlands 2.

Scout looks cool....but then again, I wear outfits over all my armor anyway.
---
Thank you I didn’t know that!
---
Same, I remember a while ago there was a challenge for eating 5 bubblegum. I now hoard the stuff
---
Yeah, I haven’t done the enclave quest to even get into the bunker, Hahahaha. I’m trucking along.
---
Is it tied to any faction or just complete it and have enough gold?
---
Yeah I think it'll be more on the weekends
---
Yea until SS armor...id only run that...once i found legendary 3* versions of each metal armor i rocked that for nearly 150 levels...only switched to SS since i got all unyielding pieces
---
Regardless of faction allegiances at the end you can purchase the plans with bullion.
---
Yes I am! Feel free to Add me: XFurtivaX

This is a nice reference. I'd estimate I'm about 15% of the way through so I guess if I keep going at this rate I'll end up just over 80.
---
I gotcha. I did the same thing but used scout. Still working on an unyielding leg and then I’m finished lol.

[Around 10 weeks](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons)
---
&gt; We currently plan to have four Seasons per year. Each will generally last for ***around 10 weeks***, with a few weeks’ break before the next Season begins. To keep things fresh, every Season will feature its own unique theme and set of rewards.
---
I am on Xbox, if you are to, do feel free to add me XFurtivaX I can use all the help I get!
---
Mods don't get weight reduction.
---
True some outfits are awesome
---
Ah ok. Thanks!!
---
Intelligence is huge. My friend and I started at the same time and he invested in int early. By end game we were 10 levels apart.
---
Still not quite used to reddit so i don't know if you're replying to me or the other person. But if you want something i don't mind popping on. Currently watching mel gibson throw tomahawks at people.
---
But that would take away from the inventory-management hell that takes up 60% of my game time!
---
My current favorite is the Insurgent Outfit - I accessorize with either the SS Helmet or Military Cap...both look great.
---
You're good, I also thought the extra challenges were meant to stay - as some kind of compensation for their stupid bullshit amateur bugs that rob people of their S.C.O.R.E - but we're talking Bethesda here. If there's ***one*** thing they just can't do, it's...
---
- proper game design
---
- stuff that makes sense
---
- damage control
---
- something not grindy
---
- proper balancing
---
- implementing something right the first time
---
- not reviving bugs already eliminated in older patches
---
- PVP
---
- fun game mechanics
---
- ....
---
...hm, I think I got distracted there...
---
I’m only level 32 and I just came back to the game outside of wastelanders story and a few events I have a lot of my main quest and locations to explore I’m not super new because of my level but the help would be appreciated.
---
Most ”weightless” are really 90% reduction, so they will weigh-in between 0.25 and 1.25.
---
AS San79isBack said, If you mod a “weightless item, the reduction is not applied to the mod.
---
Oh yeah. Wasn't pretty lol
---
I haven’t seen the insurgent one. I got the fly boy pack so I just rock that until I found something better. Maybe I’ll check out the insurgent.
---
What moral superiority? Isn't that exactly what you're implying by interpreting other peope's actions as negative in your own weird sense of justice you've come up with? This is the first time you've mentioned explosive rounds, so if the problem is noise spam and screen shake then okay, makes more sense why you're frustrated by it then. I don't care if you take someone's loot after they shoot you, unlike you I'm not tying any morality into video game actions lol, just wanted to know what urked you so much about someone left clicking you that you or anyone would actually waste your own time afking so they couldn't interact with a vendor, or some of the other elaborate 'get your revenge' schemes that people have come up with in this thread.
---
I'm not trying to be harsh.. but your doin it wrong.. lol. I tank all 3 pylons and barely ever use more than 10-15. Get some troubleshooters armor and stealth/ damage resistance perks and sneak. You'll go through WAY less that way.
---
Is stacking those two perks good? Basically if I’m firing a heavy weapon I get +120 DR and 60 ER?  I’ve heard if you get your DR/ER too high it doesn’t make a real difference. I think it was 300 vs 350. At 350 it doesn’t do a whole lot.
---
Usually happens to me if I accidentally switch weapons using the d-pad too quickly in NW. Sometimes I just don’t know which gun I want to use so I click it a couple times lol
---
LOL. I'm no playing until tomorrow morning GMT+1. Say hi to Mel
---
Mmm, I wouldn't say "lord over".  If anything it has created talking points with people I have played with during events who speak up.  Giving them tips etc on the run and how to maximize their time spent and then just playing the game with them was a fun wind down from the solo nature of the grind beforehand.
---
taking any of the power plant workshops and you can use the fusion core generator, that and power user and i never run low on fusion cores for my PA and gattyboi
---
Everyone is welcome at the SBQ event! dunno why people would have a gripe over that sort of thing. I did one yesterday and a lvl 3 rushed at her with a wooden board! gave me a good laugh and he stood his ground pretty well.
---
Would be the only NPC i could stand to listen to
---
actually i’d probably still eventually hate him idk lmao
---
Just logged on and found 5/7 of my dailies were completed. Didn't touch NW yesterday because of the 2 revives challenge and its been over three hours since the reset.
---
The only thing I can think of is that all the completed challenges were ones I have completed before in the last 1-2 weeks. The only ones not completed were hack a terminal and eat some bubblegum, ones I haven't seen/done before for SCORE.
---
As long as I can get to at least 76 I’ll be happy, though I really want the Appalachian thunder pipe skin, and the fireplace door... we’ll see idk
---
They can still access it.  I've done that and had people still start the event.
---
Inb4 "I just lost 5000 ammo point reward because I was at 99,999 ammo points before doing Encryptid" posts.
---
I do agree with your plan though, it's a good idea. People will always find a way to complain though.
---
According to the blurbs that show up when you are loading in, Marine armor is bested only by PA :)
---
Best I have been able to figure, for good balance between RR/DR/ER, marine isn’t bad at all.
---
Yes... and they have been more specific... in saying it was going for “the next 10 weeks”. 
---
You seem to for whatever reason be ignoring the specific sentence that says... 
---
&gt;	—for free over the next 10 weeks.
---
With patch 20.
---
 Seasons in general will be around 10 weeks. 
---
Season 1... will be 10 weeks. Nowhere does it say September 15. What we do have is saying when patch 20 released.... that the season would continue... for the next 10 weeks.
---
Are you just ignoring what quotes I share that are more specific and talking specifically about season 1?
---
Anyway I hope you aren’t banking on having an additional week to grind. You may he disappointed.
---
I might try to move  some points next time that's available, I think my INT is at 9 or 10, thanks for the heads up
---
Which at least gets you dibs on the legendary - so, either clueless or smart.
---
Same, tried to follow everyone's advice to prevent it and I just had it happen to me today.
---
I sell Serums and ammo. I have the odd 3\* in my vendor but the main income are the serums.
---
After nuke runs I put the Glowing and Hardened Mass leftovers in there as well. High rad fluids go in my stash.
---
However, I'm seriously running out of shit to buy when I'm getting close to max.
---
People rarely sell anything good via vendors and on the off chance that you find a rare plan or weapon it's happening on the day you bought every single bulk item from all the vendors just to get rid of a couple thousand caps. -\_-
---
I came here to ask what the hell the distinction is going to be. Weekends make sense
---
True. Marine has the added benefit of rad Res.
---
Aside from random drops, try to avoid quests that give legendaries until you're level 50+. The rewards are scaled to your level.
---
Other than that, use what you feel like and are specced for.
---
Then u get kicked off the game. It’s perfect
---
I think the recommended minimum levels for each area would probably be:
---
* Forest: Level 1
---
* Toxic Valley: Level 5-10
---
* Ash Heap: Level 15
---
* Savage Divide: Level 20-25
---
* The Mire: Level 30-35
---
* Cranberry Bog: Level 40
---
These are just estimates and will depend on what happens to spawn there when you get there. It's probably still doable at lower levels but might be a bit more of a challenge or a risk. I wouldn't worry though - if you can do it, then there's no reason not to do it really. There might be more difficult bits but you can always do some events or daily quests to get your level up as needed.
---
It was a reward for the Treasure Hunt a couple of months ago - very nice.
---
Only proper reply: "Gonna cry?!"
---
God that’s the worst
---
The old one was super good honestly
---
Ah dang so it’s not available all the time?
---
Okay will do thank you!
---
In general, you should be scrapping or selling anything you aren't going to use soon or that is rare. (of course, that excludes legendaries you want for later, for an alt, etc). It can be tempting to hoard, but the game throws most things at you pretty regularly. Also make sure you are bulking your scrap.
---
Any damage against the queen is always welcome or any contribution to a event
---
I craft them for people all the time - it was a reward / plan, but it can be traded or sold to others (the outfit).
---
Yea I meant that in a tongue-in-cheek way. Do you just run a high Int build? I have seen people who have got specific builds purposely to level up so I assume it'll be the same for SCORE.
---
He’s better than the fucking radio host who tries to be inspirational between every fucking song. Makes me not even want to listen to the songs that helped me love fallout so.
---
If I remember correctly stacking them even the legendary traits has diminishing returns and a cap out can't remember been a minute
---
next NW map would likely be harpers ferry area. a map for it was datamined a long time ago. there was also a very small map in the Charleston area as well.
---
For the current state of Appalachia, they pretty much holed up in whatever defensible position they could find.  They took over Camp Venture (a tourist "outdoor experience" camp) for a time.  Hopefully that BoS spotlight they have on the fence will show up in the Atom shop soon.  They even setup Fort Defiance at &gt;!Allegheny Asylum,!&lt; which isn't particularly military beyond having a good fence. Most of the fire bases and outposts are just steel walkways/scaffolds, concrete barriers, fences and tents.
---
As others have said, and as you propose, it's more a matter of using military style decor.  Weapons stands, foot lockers for stash, turrets, guard posts, etc.  Make sure your power armor workstation is prominently displayed, with a few toolkits next to it.  It seems like the main thrust would be improvised repairs and barricades designed to shore up existing structures.  So pretty much like every other survival compound, except better organized.  You may do better getting together a good Slocum's Joe franchise building then looking at it with an eye for defense.  Have fun and post pictures!
---
Yeah I don't understand this too. My heavy all rise is 8lbs but is meant to have 90% reduced weight. Pretty sure it's not meant to weigh like 80lbs.
---
39 here and todays dailies are the easiest
---
Get in a building group and go after all the mob events. Youll be hitting that repeatable 10K about 3-4 times in a couple hours.
---
dont forget your meat stew, lovers embrace and INT boosts w mentats
---
Hear! hear!
---
(didn't know dropping insulted notes was a thing...)
---
I'd add:
---
\- the kind souls who use Cyrolators, especially on SBQs, that ammo weights a ton and does not grow on tree.
---
\- folks who take pylons, nearly every time.
---
That’s a bit low... I would say around 50 at that point is ideal.
---
Most of my wheel is food, water and chems lol
---
Or you could do like me and run junkies weapons with unyielding gear, adrenal reaction, and nerd rage and get really close. I just haven't found those good bloodied rolls, but honestly my junkies explosive is so close that only a god roll bloodied is going to do better.
---
That’s cool. At least it’s not like the gold bullion plans (which I get you’d see them everywhere if they could be traded or dropped)
---
Does Herd Mentality with Class Freak 3 still bug out the Barbarian and Evasive perks (due to SPECIAL not being full numbers)?
---
Take your time and enjoy the lore and scenery. 
---
IIRC the quests correctly, unless you get really lucky, glass caverns will likely be very difficult at your level.
---
Although I had the quest about L60, and had already fought the SBQ several times,  I didn’t (launch a nuke) until I was on the far side of L130.  Completed Roses original questline Somewhere around L120.
---
Didn’t do the vault rain until about L210.
---
I wouldn’t worry too much about legendaries until you’re 50 or so. That’s when legendaries cap out.
---
The two best legendary mods are Bloodied or Junkies, but most people to go for one or the other because they’re both highly build dependent. Furious is good on weapons that fire fast, while Instigating is really good on weapons that do a lot of damage in a single attack. Vampires is also good on fast weapons, but it doesn’t give you a damage bonus so keep that in mind. Anti-Armor is the best all around, no investment needed damage boost, but it’s still a bit worse than Junkies, Berserkers, Furious and Bloodied if you’re willing to put the work in for them.
---
"put an egg in your shoe and beat it"
---
\*Disconnected\*
---
Yes, I ran a high Int build from unyielding etc and rearranged my SPECIAL for it.  Haven't changed it back to what I had it prior to yet in case I am able to grind out at all during the double xp days and make some progress in prep for the legendary perk system.
---
Given them away to noobies. I randomly poop paper bags for low level players. Especially if I have multiples of a common plan. Saves alot of weight at 0.25 each.
---
This. 
---
That’s really the way I always approach RPGs. Go into a dungeon. If it’s too hard, run away. Grind some xp. Get better gear. Return. Overcome your challenges. 
---
Is also a reason I don’t like the idea of One Appalachia. But that’s a discussion for another day.
---
I quite enjoyed yesterdays dailies in fairness - log in, join a team, take a picture, and build five posters did four of the challenges in about one minute. Though I must say I haven't struggled to complete any of the daily challenges, and just doing the level up daily which often appears nets you the repeatable SCORE a couple of times too.
---
I'm not saying that the historied dynamic is there yet. I imagine both are at least somewhat aware of each other at this point, however, and I imagine neither side is thrilled by the others existence. I don't invision all-out war, but surveillance and covert ops to thwart each other's actions, as well as occasional engagements? That's arguably realistic. I would imagine that the Enclave regards the Brotherhood as a developing threat to stifle before it gains substantial mass. Plenty of blood to go around before a war.
---
And alcohol, don’t forget the alcohol!
---
Tons of use I main a set of marine unyeilding weight reduction ap set armor isn't bad at all and with diminishing returns no reason to go much higher imo. Also for heavy builds I would suggest pa stabllized is a godsend for heavy weapons.
---
Eeeeee
---
I got a bonkers minigun a while back, and traded it for an amazing bloodied fixer, so I'm sorted, but tbh, it feels like there's every reason to go bloodied and almost no reason not to.
---
Well itll be Hard to obtain them from other players because most people are above level 50 so they only aquire Max level weapons from Events loot or the murmghpshekdidn (rusty Pick,) i know the Situation how often i wanted to give a Low level a good weapon but everything in my stash is level 45/50 so they cant use it.
---
On the other hand people on your level areas will most likely keep their found legendaries making them again not obtainable for you as they can use them themselves plus have a Hard time getting other s due to above mentioned circumatances.
---
Conclusion: dont Care about legendaries til you have Max level and get there as fast as you can manage to. I think i played til my early 50's with a level 35 cal 50 machine gun and it just went good.
---
You mean you have one and are trying to trade it? Or you want to trade to acquire one? You should be able to trade one away quite easily. For something of high value. But if you want to trade for one, you won’t even come close unless you have some rare items.
---
I just kill them..
---
Immediately...
---
Thanks for all of that I’ll keep it in mind when I reach 50 so I can be on the lookout
---
In your opinion, it is. I think Modern Warfare is trash, and yet it was just remastered. Just because somebody has an opinion, doesn’t mean it’s right.
---
 *wearing shorts* 
---
You assume too much....
---
Ad victorium, death to those who oppose the brotherhood of steel lol
---
For me it always seems to happen while aiming down the sight with a shotgun, no other weapon. Reloading always works to fix it for me. Altho my wife uses shotguns more often than I do, and she's never had it happen to her so I dunno. We're just unlucky I guess
---
This. Seriously
---
Yeah, I wasn't sure what all you wanted to fit in there! we can drop it down a floor for sure. I know some people use the blueprint function to drop the camp anywhere. If you are having trouble with it I can always come help, just let me know what you are thinking over your mic.
---
I have a camp at the same spot, but I put my shops on land for that reason.
---
if you get your hands on a mark III thats 90 seconds of cloak, enough to close distances. With a super sledge you'll two tap a lot of squishy players
---
Yeah, while I'd like the Enclave to play a more central role in the game, I'd honestly be happy just getting something. Logging in on Wastelanders release day and heading to the bunker was arguably the biggest letdown a game has ever dealt me.
---
It averages better than Trapper.  The other thing Trapper has going against it (aside from being butt-ugly) is that it has very poor reliability.  It needs to be repaired constantly.
---
Evil strategy to loot paperbags LOL
---
STOP! Hammer time!
---
So everyone who’s been in here has said wait till you are 50 what are some of the best ways to farm xp or get a decent amount of xp?
---
Right.  Which makes some things kind of ridiculous.  When I put armor up in my vendor, I usually slap Ultra Light Build on it to save stash space.  I did that the other day on a "Weightless" piece of wood armor and it dropped to zero weight.  Wasn't my kind of build, but still interesting.
---
I don't think Bethesda realizes how much money they can make off of a CAMP item like this...
---
I get the shotgun one too sometimes now that I think about it. Guess we are unlucky!
---
Nope. But you can certainly optimize space by not storing things you don’t need. 
---
Do you need those mini nukes? No. What about the 20 fusion cores you found in a bag behind mama dolce’s? Toss ‘em. 
---
Do you need random power armor pieces? If they aren’t on a chassis- no. 
---
Do you need a bunch of random backup weapons? No
---
What about all those pieces of junk? Scrap them. Don’t keep more than 50-100 of most things. 
---
What about armor? You don’t need multiple sets.
---
This, you get WAY more bang for your buck at later ranks on the board.
---
Wishful thinking but first skip is free due to issues. Prob not but worth the hope
---
If you're planning on running an automatic, look out for Explosive as a secondary effect. It won't show up as the prefix but is probably as important a prefix on those weapons in terms of the effect it can have.
---
The main reason is 2020 game with NO TEXT chat, like * there is imposter event, come help* boom, people come and help. And text chat mod is offline for several days due to hackers and only like 1% or less people use it, sadly. Its great, i sell shit way faster and get people for events on private servers, WTF bethesda, stop that crap
---
My issue with Electrically Charged (and the reason I dropped it) was It eiTher fire late (after I had killed (whatever)) or I was in a mob, and the cumulative shock I got from it hitting 15 ghouls at once (think all the ghould in the WS golf clubhouse attacking you simultaneously - which they used to do), combined with dmg from the mob itself, would kill me.

&gt;According to the blurbs that show up when you are loading in, Marine armor is bested only by PA
---
Which is a holdover tooltip from Fallout 4, and complete nonsense.
---
It's basically the jack-of-all-trades armor.  Fine if you want DR/ER *and* Rad Resist, but it excels at nothing.
---
The problem with Rad Resist is that PA and Hazmat/Stealth Suits have a hidden buff that makes them superior at Rad Resist, even if you manage to cobble together an equivalent amount of Rad Resist.  You will never achieve the same result with Marine or any other armor.  So, really, while it's nice to have maybe about 25 points of Rad Resist, there's not much of a point beyond that.  You can always take a Rad-X (Diluted) for the Queen.

I chose a specific set of addictions that go along with my playstyle and would give me about a meager - 1 across the board. Im a heavy gunner and I tried to choose addictions from the chems I actually use. You still get the addiction bonus even if you use the Chem it's associated with, and it alleviates your addiction penalty as well.

&gt; It also makes more sense game-wise. 
---
It makes no sense gameplay-wise. Unless Ammo Converter rewarded on every season, future new players will get Ammo Points without having actual means to redeem it.
---
Yeah I was just being a smart ass. 
---
It’s all buried behind terminal screens and exchanging small amounts of ammo for points (which currently cap out at 1000, not near enough) to exchange for another small amount of ammo. Extremely tedious.
---
Just started the game on game pass - how is this even a thing?! Having to split up to do missions is a terrible design choice.
---
you dont HAVE to wipe your ass or brush your teeth, but life is much more enjoyable if you do.
---
likewise doing the extra score means a more enjoyable time getting free stuff.
---
Plus, I want to see how far I can get on the board. For science!
---
Yeah, I think that's half of what irks me. There are so many components already there for an epic storyline. Feels like they're currently just going to waste.
---
The mutations were always something that puzzled me. I guess it's fine as long as the Enclave made it instead of random radiation exposure?
---
Ammo points should be a currency like Caps/Scrip/Gold and the converter interface should just be a trading interface. Solves all the UI problems with the converter, and makes them able to use points as a quest reward.
---
Also they can get rid of the ugly terminal, which doesn't even look like it fits with the machine itself.
---
It might be a weekend-specific thing, or Bethesda has their hands on the levers testing to find the sweet spot.
---
*Campslaughter
---
I'm with him. Ive been trying since I learned about them and how to get them and still haven't gotten one so I bought the one vault 94 one and it's an ugly mess that makes no sense with my brotherhood outfit. So if anyone has one I'll gladly buy it from you!
---
Take the Poseidon Power Plant, I farmed around 40 fusion cores there in a couple days; not sure of the exact amount of time I actually held it, but I was making cores quick. Make sure you check it often though, I think there is a 2 or 3 core capacity, so if it's "full" it stops generating cores.
---
PP cannot be done solo, at least not successfully. May be alright as a deliberate fail XP farm though...
---
Do you have a list of clean junk items?
---
"Vindictive", "petty", "toxic". Those sound like judgemental descriptors to me.  I never said they were wrong or inferior, only that I'm going to blast anyone who foregoes using a mic and the dev's emoji wheel to communicate and instead shoots at me.  I dont go AFK, you'd have to ask others about that.  By the way, honest question, what is 'left clicking'?
---
Just logged onto PC and I had 5/7 completed. I thought waiting this long past reset would be safe. Guess not.
---
Everytime I go near Top of the World, I see a power armored level 30 raider, even if I killed one there before. I saw a comment in another thread that killing the fusion core will cause the wearer to dismount the armor, and I tried it, but he just didn't turn around, so I bailed to not waste any more stimpaks and ammo.
---
I agree. Hopefully not too many complain about how they're being used, I could see them nerfing it to where you got to be in close proximity to each other for the bonus.
---
This is why I do INT teams, but even then I've had low level people join them not knowing why INT and expect to find me building something.
---
Hmmm. I never really thought of durability. Is marine pretty durable or is it strong but brittle
---
Any pictures or video of it? Is the floor connected to any other floor or stairs?
---
Have you done those challenges before in the past week? I think all the ones I had auto completed were ones I had done before recently.
---
Im with you, I think in the long run the +Int team will give more experience as you can do what you want and not have to be tied to public events.
---
the bags of it do
---
Do you mod your weapons to do more damage? What perks are you using?
---
Also, I always recommend starting with a melee backup to conserve ammo.
---
Yeah but the game does a pretty bad job of knowing what's actually rare and not.
---
Like look at the cap prices on some of the common plans vs rare plans.
---
30 just now
---
My SS Jetpack sometimes gets nitrous and I can see the roof I'm jumping over like a little square from my possition in the stratosphere
---
Alternatively, because folks will fuss if you make them choose and it’s for good, have a sliding scale where the higher your rep is with one, the lower it goes with the other. You can only be allied with one faction (and thus, an enemy of the other). So if you want to do both you can, but it’s a LONG grind, and you can only stay on good terms with one or the other.
---
No kidding.
---
I was doing a Heavy for bosses and and up close and semi-auto rifles (Gauss and lever) for sniping.
---
And supermutants ofc. Westtek
---
No naming names in here. 
---
Better just delete this now
---
My kreiger toon wouldn't be complete without his berserker shovel
---
Especially since people are somehow duping. It’d be everywhere
---
There’s a place called West Tek that has a bunch of high level supermutants. You can clear it in 2-3 minutes with good gear, and it generally gives you a ton of EXP, especially if you eat something that gives you a bonus (Like Canned Meat Stew from Feed the People) and take a rest in a bed at your camp.
---
You might have to be careful though. I imagine they’re fairly challenging for a lower level player
---
Well I was using my shotgun with everything started not working 🤔🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Gatling plasma can’t have 200 fire rate even with 25 faster fire rate.
---
Find a good melee and build your perks to do more damage with the type of weapon you use. A solid melee will take you through most of the game.
---
marine armor is neighboring heavy combat and Scout armor. If you don't have enclave entrance yet then scout is not moddable yet so you can wear marine while you are grinding your face off for the other stuff. I recommend not doing that vault quest until you have faction allegiance. Given that's gonna take forever, some marine armor might do for now.
---
Absolutely. They definitely should make the hidden rad reduction on hazmat suits, power armor and the CSA an official, visible stat, yes, because the current state of affairs is misleading as hell.
---
That also goes for their perk, mutation and mod effect descriptions. Half the time they're outright wrong, and the rest is so vague as to be practically useless.
---
To add...it doesn’t matter which faction you choose to side. 
---
Fully leveling with each faction will allow you to buy their respective goods. I did the vault raid with the settlers. I’m almost done with the raider reputation leveling.
---
This is extremely helpful and exactly what I have been missing. Thank you so much!
---
I thought when I read into it, the insult bot was created by the watoga highschool as a societal study of how people respond to being insulted. 
---
It actually has a neat little backstory if you go poking around the schools and how this was a practicle joke that then turned into actuall school work and ended up getting sponsored by Robco
---
Ah. And I’ve heard it’s best to keep all the gold for yourself
---
"Crop dusts" Lmao
---
Oooohhh, so that's why I have been getting those random nukes mines... and missles... and fertilizer... and 'you've been insulted'.... and getting kicked from public groups...
---
Thanks for the tip. Didn't help though. logged in just now for the first time today and had 5/7 autocompleted, just perfect.
---
Your nemesis would only smile harder knowing that they drove you to such lengths. 
---
I know I would.
---
May wanna condense to one type of build with heavy builds generally easy to make it into a shotgun or melee build on the fly but trying spread yourself into multiple specialties will leave your character lacking less your not into min maxing your character.
---
Gotcha, so trading for one will be difficult. Appreciate it.
---
Isn't this just inviting people to not go b events until the last minute to get the event XP?
---
Can't see many people wanting to sit through the food factory noise but to jump in at the end and get my XP boost lovely!
---
I miss understood what you were talking about, your targeting the note left by the blood eagle's that were insulted by the robot. Funny of all the ways to n.v respond to being insulted, the players tend to be the more murderous and vindictive while the raiders and bandits actually let the robot live
---
What we need is our character name to show up in game and not our account name.
---
if you're on discord, you should join one of the fo76 based servers - people are more than willing to help others get their achievements!
---
Yeah. Keep the gold. No repercussions. 
---
Also - doing the settlers stuff early can award the Chinese stealth suit. That’s good and keeps you from having to use bullion to buy  it  later.
---
Why don’t you just buy them? The bot sells them at the white springs train station.
---
Then don't run routes? There's plenty of other ways to earn exp. You don't have to stick to just one either. 
---
If you aren't interested in the season pass or banking more levels for Legendary Perks I have no clue what you could be doing that hasn't gotten old.  At least this gives us a reason to farm and repeat 90% of the same content we've been repeating for over a year.
---
Miniguns have to spool up dawg. They don’t fire instantly.
---
Furious black powder rifle ftw.
---
Unless you've just got to have it all right now, with minimal effort, there's no point.  Ideally, you'd wait until the last week, if not the last day, and evaluate where you are.  It makes no sense to skip levels now because the later levels will be considerably more arduous to complete, thanks to that +25 SCORE requirement with each rank.
---
Another similar question but does Rad res count against berserker or is only DR/ER counted? Like if I used a Hazmat Suit and a berserker LMG would Berserker be active?
---
Really? Fuck I’m an idiot 😂
---
Seems to me that if we had more actual game-specific team types and more practical emotes this wouldn’t be a problem.
---
I only have one question left, where do i find a power armor plan for a  bench thingy  to work on my power armor at my C.A.M.P (Someone else answered most of em via a dirrect message already, now only the "play with me" part remains xD. Actually, i have one more, how do you properly level up ? Main quest seems to send me in a area where the mobs are around lvl 60-ish rn, which seems very hard for a lvl 20 to do.
---
I was just thinking this yesterday, had to check nap because I didn't think I was at the right camp.
---
Ok. I did the raiders up until you actually get to crater and talk to meg.
---
It does seem to depend a bit - but as long as she lands, I don't have a problem killing her. In fact, it was just me and one other guy last night and between the two of us, she was dead in 10 mins.
---
I'm not a moron, I'm well aware. If you aim down sights while it's revving it will not fire no matter how long you wait in ADS.
---
It's not that. It literally will not fire, no matter how long you hold the trigger.
---
Ah, I do the same with my magic LMG
---
I primed it so it would be cheaper but damn... .308 is expensive
---
When people have started the event there will be a notice of that when you hover over the event. Your timer idea has been brought up before, but the CMs said there's a lot that goes in to event timing and availability and that a straightforward timer is not possible with the current system.
---
Yeah, and I highly doubt anyone would take 30k caps for one. You’ll need either a legacy weapon, possibly a bunch of rare outfits/plans, or other bloodied weapons like fixers or handmades.
---
Awesome, I’ll check that out
---
Thanks man. I’ll look into it
---
Well congrats on the epic pic my frend
---
Agreed it’s a very nice build, got through all the content with a good melee build.
---
I want to be good and actually get something from SBQ but I don’t care or want to try and be the best.
---
Honestly just looking to get my sheepsquatch plushie and firefly lantern, may pay for it since I dont really care about anything after, I just dont wanna feel the pressure to log in everyday.
---
The ranks should've been objective based, not daily based but that's just my opinion.
---
I think I have some for 150c in my vending?
---
Won't be on for a while though.
---
It's unremarkable.  It doesn't seem particularly strong or brittle compared to other options.
---
As far as I know, Berserker is based purely off Damage Resist.
---
I’ll let them delete it, that way the warning is out there.
---
Yep. This makes me sad. Hope they do it EVERY weekend tho.
---
You’re right. Idk why you had the dv. I run a stealth vats crit build and whenever I do join there’s never anyone on the pylons, so I just take one for myself and I’m not really built for it.
---
Yeah, but look at how many points it takes to buy a handful of Fusion Cells, for example.
---
You need to edit the name out, or your post will be removed for witchhunting.
---
just shy of 62
---
did every challenge including NW, no auto complete bugs. heavy optimized xp team grinding. long sessions that i dont have to take any breaks to farm for things.
---
UNY armor, stranger in numbers, herd mentality, cranberry relish, sleeping, lunchboxes ect
---
doing repeated runs of
---
Charleston capital
---
whitespring + sentry bots ( 1k xp each)
---
wes tech + huntersville
---
thunder mountain substation for deathclaw 1k xp
---
generals steakhouse
---
burrows
---
gulper lagoon
---
hopewell cave deathclaw 1k xp
---
sunnytop ski lanes + agility course run to finish
---
rise repeat, one private world, one public 
---
staring to slowdown though, not grinding as hard anymore, will probably finish at the end of double xp or during double score dailies.
---
Bloodied or full health build? Energy weapons or ballistic ones? Or both?
---
Bingo.
---
Penitentiary
---
Laughs in melee build.
---
She went down with about 4 of us fighting her just a few hours ago but it was a tough fight. I used up 4 plasma cores and about 3,000 .50 rounds.  
---
Maybe it's just that I've been fighting in smaller groups lately but everything about the SBQ fights seems to have been kicked up a notch or two since seasons started.
---
Oh, well then it just sounds like another broken aspect of a failing game that has shifted its focus from gameplay to spewing out useless cosmetics. I wouldn’t expect for the issue to ever get fixed. Probably better off saving the miniguns for adventure mode.
---
Nuke silos
---
Literally as you walk into one
---
The note they write is about how some raider was pissed that the cage they made to keep people captive was elevated by bricks but didn’t have a floor, leaving a gap for people to escape. I assume the raider who built the cage called the other an dumbass and now this one is writing back in the note “YOUR the dumbass”.
---
I usually afk while in the vendor when someone does that.
---
I should have noticed her life was stuck. Yeah last night we did three in a row. Perfect this morning same thing. But after noon. Go figure. She just won't die. Crazy thing. Ps4 if that matters. Hope it fixes itself.
---
Lighthouse
---
Thank you all for the help it means a lot to me especially sense I want to get back into the game!
---
With the Double-XP weekend coming up, I think it's premature - I mean, it might be worth getting a couple of levels or so - if there is something on the board (close) that you really want, but not only do you have double XP, but Double Daily Score points coming up too.
---
Where are you playing? Use [this map](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451695772023652362/703773174730588180/a65709b8af386f151078df56ffa2a5e9.jpg) as a guide until One Wasteland is released. 
---
Other than that I've found it's best to alternate weapons based on what ammo I have available. But by level 28 you should have some favorites and an idea of what perk cards you'll be using for damage. A good melee weapon makes a lot of things easier from a resource perspective.
---
Second floor of the vault tec agricultural building
---
haven't not killed her in a long time. so.e times it takes  bit longer, but she always die!
---
Seems its a level 3. The one to the main office?
---
Killed 3 today, no issues.
---
She has to land, though. Shooting her in flight is an incredible waste of ammo.
---
I already tried there. Its unlocked on my private server
---
No Lone Wanderer does not work if you are in a group alone so get something else. I used to use to have Lone Wonderer in my Perk Set Up but now it's better to join a Building Team (Bonus Intelligence) and have Inspirational Lv.3 and Strange in Numbers as a substitute to Lone Wanderer
---
Yeah that's what I noticed. Maybe they know we're farming the xp there and made it scale to the group's. Because we had full force no doubt should have been done quick.
---
Or you're on a team and your teammate did the damage.
---
Its level 0 or 1?
---
Didn't realize it was of greater value than the bloodied handmades/fixers
---
This too.  They do it in eso as a option...not sure why not in 76
---
I recently turn off the grass in my settings, and was astonished to see the amount of crap lying around that area of the bog that the grass usually hides.
---
Secret service armor isn’t gonna be in your hands for a long time. gameplay wise marine would do you fine.
---
Ok. Thanks. That’s good to know. I think berserker says the lower your damage resist the higher your damage but I couldn’t be certain with this game Hahahaha.
---
yup!
---
Wade airport tower has a level 0. Climb the giant wing and you are there.
---
Hell even the bloodied guys were screaming about the damn queen. And those guys hit pretty hard I think.
---
Ok. Thanks. What are the go to mods for marine? Like deep pocket buttressed?
---
&gt;  that ammo weights a ton and does not grow on tree.
---
I wonder if a crossbow with a cryo frame from the raiders/settlers would work, or is it's the fire rate of the cryolator that works so well on her.
---
I wish names mattered. Like it would make having multiple characters a bit more fun
---
Switch to a public server and unlock it again
---
No to the left of that one is a door and there is a level 1 in that room
---
* People who use friendly fire to keep the npcs alive
---
Dry Cleaning plant, second floor, just south of thunder MTN power plant. It's level 1.
---
It's an engine flaw 
---
Pretty sure F03, FNV, and F04 all had similar 'bugged' weapons
---
The reception office.
---
Level 3
---
Oh wait my bad I didn't read it all
---
Also Building team is code for a team of solos. Don't expect anyone in a Building team to play with you.
---
I figured lol. I suppose my question was pretty vague at what I was trying to ask, rather than what it simply said. But I am really not surprised it's tedious. I don't know who in their dev team thinks scrip cap or ammo point caps where a good thing....smh
---
She landed alot I use cryolator to freeze her on the ground. That's why I know she should be down. With every person shooting she just wouldn't die.
---
Listen, I built a house for a reason, if you want the vendors you gotta go through my house. And you better enjoy it
---
Naaa, not going to happen. No one but the player itself can see the name, and the displayed name can and should be changed in the webinterface for your account.
---
There’s always one in the first room as you enter a silo
---
Having a robot in my camp lecturing me is just gold. The tone and delivery is perfect.
---
The dialectical materialism rating of this camp is insufficient, you must work harder comrade.
---
&gt; People not collecting ore at radiation rumble confuses me a bit though
---
Some I'm sure don't understand what to do yet, but for many it's because they want to just kills ghouls for the entire event to farm XP and don't care that it will fail/have bad rewards in the end.
---
Yeah. But most of them where the generic type, complete an event or level up which is every day it seems. It was always the gold star one that was completed for what ever reason. I haven’t had it happen in a few days. I’m not sure if this is why, but I let it load to the main menu and leave it alone for 5 minutes. Then when I load into the world I go to the same mode I was in when I left the night before. I also them don’t touch anything for 5 minutes. When I log out each night I go to a train station vendor since those area are kinda safe for my log in the next day. I’ve also been using the log out function in the social menu. I don’t know for sure and have now way of knowing, but I think it’s server lag causing it. When I was loading in I was opening the map to check the challenges real quick and it would freeze for ten seconds each time I lost my challenges. I haven’t had any lost YET doing this. If it holds up then this is the best advise I can offer for now until Bethesda fixes this issue.

Fort defiance floor 3
---
I don't remember what is the level of the entrance terminal of Abby's bunker. But I plan to server hop that location until I find an unhacked terminal.
---
the squirrel tato stew gives even more xp , 20% and its pretty easy to make
---
I always end up building or joining a building team, the main reason is for just boosting my xp/S.C.O.R.E gain. But the there's something fishy🐟 about the event teams it feels like some people just afk, to keep thir vendor open and autogain xp and caps when the rest of the team complete quest?
---
Yesterday there were 2 event teams totally filled up with a total 8 players. But I ended up doing a lot event alone i did: line in the sand, heart of the swamp, one violent night, guided meditation, swarm of suitors, lode baring and projectparadise(only one animal). I had a look at the map where all people were the two team leaders and from the event team were in their camp and at the last event they were still in their camp. Good for me a lot of xp but need to make some ammo though 😅 
---
At the end I thought: okay maybe a queen fight can draw people out of the shadows, at this time there were 8 people at lvl ➕100 at the server and the only people there showed up doing the fight were people between lvl 30-100 and they where slaughtered. But at the last 10 min a few high lvl people showed up and ended the queen. Yeah I could have killed her but the xp from the mobs she farts out a quite good. In the 30 min the fight went on there were around 7 1-3 star scorch beast so it was quite good.
---
I agree with you OP but also, you're considerably disadvantaged if you don't pick up the NW challenges.
---
They gave us an outfit. :)

OP already addressed this. Ammo machines could take points as well, instead of being a cap vendor you can't sell anything to and can only buy ammo from.
---
Watoga transit hub front desk. 
---
Penitentiary medical wing
---
How are they stealing loot from you? Is there a bug or something?
---
Its level 2 though
---
I’ve only been playing since Feb. 9th 2020
---
It sucks. But don’t carry scrap around with you. You will loose it when you die at a public event. Drop it off at your stash before going to any event.
---
Also if a group is rollin arpund spamming events with a public event xp bonus team...crazy xp in that as well
---
Opps, sorry i didnt read the OP last part lol... 
---
But anyway, I kinda wish Ammo Converter Machines would return on other season, but with different looks/skins so new players can grab one too
---
Hi! On the Nuclear Winter front, we're hearing feedback that some of those daily challenges are particularly time consuming. (For example, the recent one over the weekend that asked you to kill 9 creatures.) 
---
Going forward, we're going to reduce the requirements for that one and others as needed to help them feel more achievable in a shorter time. Please keep calling out any dailies that are too tough or too time consuming and we'll re-evaluate them!
---
Also, (and I'm excited about this one) we experimented with some bonus daily challenges over the weekend and we're going to add them back every day this week. You should have 9 daily challenges again starting tomorrow through July 20. We will also look into doing this more in the future as well. 
---
We're also still working hard to address the issue that can cause daily and weekly challenges to auto-complete. We're aiming to hotfix tomorrow to add logging that will help us track down the root of the issue more effectively, and then release a fix for the issue as soon as possible once we have the info we need from that logging. I'll let you know as soon as I hear any updates on the status of a fix.
---
Probably died and dropped a bag.
---
Just started playing last week. Jumped off a bridge and both my shins rocketed out of my shoulders. I was trying to hop up on the edge to snipe a super mutant, got hit with stutter and accidentally doubled jumped to my death. Luckily my friend revived me lol. So far it's been my only death so doing good.
---
Damn thanks! I'm sure this daily will come around again at some point and I can reference this
---
My guess is you don't have a melee weapon, get one. Ranged weapons damage drops off the further the target, melee does good damage close up. Its been op in this game. 
---
My second guess is you're using automatics. Stop that. You're too low of a level to have a decent amount of decent ammo stockpiled. 38mm, 10mm is bad (although I've been surprised by the old guard) 45 is good for the fixer and the lever, neither of which I'm assuming you have. 5.56 is good but you're better off crafting that. I used a 308 hunting rifle until level 50 (3 characters) and I usually have one still. Really bad fire rate but it makes you better at conserving ammo. 
---
You're about to hit level 30, you'll start getting some good perks. I suggest alternating between fireproof and enforcers. Fireproof minimizes the scorch screech damage, but enforcers allows shotguns to cripple enemies. Just point it at their legs and put them down, even a level 5 shotgun will cripple them. Then to conserve ammo, finish them off with your melee weapon.
---
That was my fault, heaven forbid you claim another workshop that isn't owned by someone already.

Depends on your play style just go for whatever mods you think would benefit you! I wouldn’t get too attached I believe scout armor is a step above marine and you should be running into that soon if you haven’t already.
---
I resisted for a long time because I didn't think I had the surviveability but when I started rolling unyielding SS armor, I figured I would try it out. I have not looked back since. I do like that with my junkies weapons, I can still do ok damage-wise even when I'm not at super low health.

Thanks for the feedback on this! Going forward, we're going to reduce the requirements for this challenge and other Nuclear Winter challenges that are too time consuming or too tough so that they're more manageable in a shorter time. Please keep posting feedback about these and we'll continue to adjust!
---
2K? Unless something's changed, that's not even close to what you'll have to pay for that.
---
Ah ok. It’s only that I think you can’t craft scout so would you only get mods from MODUS?
---
That's what all the price checks say is the average price of it.
---
Run the power through a switch so you can easily turn off your map icon then close the garage door just in case.

Those are PVP area regardless. If you are in that area you can be killed. There are players who use that to their advantage. It is a function of the game in those few areas at least. Some people role play the raider life a little hard. Wait till you find a trap camp!

If you have someone with a good bloody build it’s not so terrible.

I play a tank Vanguard vampiric shotgun so I pretty much just try to keep the thing crippled and standing Still so they can melt it.

Sorry you dropped so much ammo Hopefully you have better luck next time.

Agreed, if not I like using the one in camp mcclintock next to the mr handy

The whitesprings is a very easy one. Easy to get there and to hack.

that is exactly how i have it all setup, they are all connected to the same switch

That’s great to hear!

PlayStation had a drift to the left after the last patch. Thought my new controller was breaking till others in my group were all experiencing it.

Yeah, the last patch, in true to form Bethesda style, caused new bugs...err....I mean content

THE GREATER GOOD!!

You only need the key card and the codes from the nuka crypt site.      That’s the easy way.   Otherwise you have to figure out the codes yourself.

Once you get through the silo you will eventually need to use the key card then type in the numeric code.

meh, i just have mine in a weird spot, if it gets turned off it gets turned off, i haven't had any problems with people turning that one off. Now my garage for all my workbenches, i tend to TP to my camp and find that one closed quite often

How about scrip, scrap a plan gain a scrip.

Most of us get enough plans that it would be worthwhile, not overkill to make us swimming in scrip, but we know that 18 scrip is worth more then 18 mole miner gauntlet plans

Sure, I am already level 57 or so and started playing this laggy mode a week ago. So I think I'm fine hiding in the bushes, lol, is the only way you can get extra experience for surviving against 4 players teams since most of the time my companions die as soon as the game starts.
---
What rank do you have to be to get this power armor skin? I think it’s the best looking out of any skin so far
---
I do not doubt you're wrong, but how much would you wager that people will spend atoms and receive no rank increase?
---
The values would suck worse then putting them on a mule to never be seen again?
---
Thanks for passing it along! I might just go for that tadpole badge after all
---
No it’s not, it’s less value but not many people will trade away something like a bloodied explosive minigun except for things like fixers or handmades. It just depends on how badly you want a bloodied explosive minigun.
---
I looked at different price checks and they all were in the 1-3k range.
---
I owuldn't know.
---
but who doesnt love getting 6 pounds of Missiles just as you are about to fast travel to only become over-encumbered
---
A currency that iirc was used in West Virginia to keep coal miners stuck in employment, like a way to enslave people without them being "slaves"
---
Just got mine, after I hit rank 26 I was opening some perk card packs and it unlocked after it gave me xp for duplicates lol
---
That's the main issue I have with that thing. The terrible rewards. We took one down after the Queen today and got a nice selection of:
---
a 3\* Pitchfork
---
a 3\* Rolling Pin
---
a 3\* Pickaxe.
---
First time we nailed that thing I got a 3\* Lever Action. Nocturnal, naturally...
---
Bethesda, seriously. If you expect that people fight that thing and not just let it rot until it dies of old age you need to up the rewards. The Queen at least drops some flux. The Wendigo is a fun fight, once. After that it's an ammo dump that gives you nothing but disappointment.
---
The randomness fits and I HATE getting stuff I can't/won't use.    
---
IMO, there could be a one-time quest turned Daily quest for ammo points.
---
Doing end game enemies requires end game weapons / gear and a planned build. Just as an example (not bragging) i soloed one couple days ago with couple clips with my stealth commando. Took me max 20-30 seconds. My heavy gunner kills one half that time.
---
Hell no, I need spare ammo, I end up using it eventually, plus the ammo converter doesn’t give much for what you put in it, and a low cap on points at that.
---
Don't fret too much about what you "should" be doing, or how many people are higher level than you. Most of what people talk about on this sub is more fun is more fun when you find it out as you go, and you miss out on a lot of good times by rushing to the end. It's a pretty forgiving game and most people I've met were friendly.
---
Wrong reply button :)
---
Extremely late to the party, but Juice Head for information, and Kevduit for fun content.
---
How many you got?
---
I'd imagine they are simply testing reactions.  Next week we will be down to four for the weekend a thirteen fir the weekdays.  I believe that they modeled Vault-Tec after their own business.
---
To be honest 4 had shitty wetmaps during rain as well. Hair looked like it was made out of shiny wax and the cooking spit variant of cook stations legit turned **chrome**.
---
also scrapping legendaries should give you a much higher chance of unlocking missed plans for the weapons. I am looking at you Radium Rifle!
---
I'm newly 3digits. 100. I got here thru help and kindness. Day one my sister and brother in law got me to level 20 BECAUSE of being high level grinding. In turn I've been able to help probably 50 people? My point is there is a genuine culture of teammates out here. If you want the SBQ to yourself be a big boy/girl and buy private. Either way, help the newbies cause they are the reason you get new content. Ad mothafuckin victorium
---
Ungh that gives me a Geiger Counter Boner.
---
Ask a friend to lock their terminal for their robot collector. Sure you’ll get a bounty. But then your friend can just kill you and take the 5-10 caps.
---
This is actually one of the few amazing ideas I've seen out of this subreddit, good on ya man you've got my upvote
---
Oh my bad missed the part about level 1
---
We can join up and complete it if you are interested. My husband (u/mind_voyager) still hasn't completed it.
---
I got It from Back on the Beat las week
---
Thank you ! Will look into it tomorrow !
---
The day i got my tse shotty (pre nerf) probably blew myself up 100 times
---
It shouldn't be "exchange quantities" to begin with.
---
They put all that wasted effort into an animated hopper that does nothing, you should just be able to drop all your unwanted ammo in there and it draws from there.
---
I usually play on private servers with ym friends but i played adventure for a bit the other day and joined a public team, the only thing that bothered me was that people kept coming in and leaving before they'd even got a "bond" with the team, so I wasnt getting any other onuses other than me and the team leader, the other 2 spaces were changed every 2 or 3 minutes
---
I’m all for selling in bulk but his offer is sad!
---
Ok thanks i will give a melee weapon a try do u guys use power armor i got about 10 cores saved up i ain’t used
---
You don't drop loot in public events.
---
I'm not really talking about the ones that have a timer when player inits the event because that is problematic.  I'm talking about the ones that just have a limited time regardless of if anyone attends or not.  Like Fly Swatter, you have X minutes no matter what.  There is no "start", you just have to go and knock it down.  Same with the Powering up events, the timer runs automatically at event start.  The timer is already ticking down no matter if there is a player in it or not, just display it in the event text is all. 
---
There are some that have a timer to initiate a start, like Back on the beat, and those wouldn't hurt to have a "Start" timer as well.  Once a player inits, then don't list a time because the nature of the event changes.  I'm good with that, but if it takes me 55 seconds to FT, and there's 1:05 on the timer, I probably won't make it and start the terminal, so why waste the trip?  At the least we should be able to flag an event so that when it pops, we get a notification.
---
I was glitched for no fall damage before 20. Didnt tell a soul. Showed one teammate and they said "lets show Chuck".
---
Chuck saw me crumble off the monorail to my abysmal doom.
---
Already answered
---
There is absolutely nothing appealing about beating the colossus in 20-30 seconds. Why even bother playing the game?
---
It's a strange one, I am, like many others, orientated toward solo gaming. That said I love the new public teams as I now get to fulfill the team challenges that were otherwise closed off to me, without the "commitment" of having to actually play with others. For the most part I opt in for the events teams; I don't play everyday but when I do I do so in short bursts (an hour or two, sometimes longer) and so I like to max out the XP. But I am left bewildered by players that jump from one events team to another since the XP bonus is dependent on bonding with others in that team. If you're hopping then you're not bonding and if you're not bonding you're not benefiting from the buff that bonding brings and everybody loses out.
---
I like to drop propaganda flyers in my goody bags when I am dumping plans off onto a new person
---
Hi, we are still actively investigating this issue, and it's currently one of our top priorities. We're aiming to hotfix tomorrow to add some logging that will help us track down the root of the bug more effectively. We will release a fix as soon as we possibly can once we have the info we need from that logging. I will let everyone know as soon as I hear anything on the status of a fix after that logging is implemented.
---
If you haven’t died this way you are missing out on some laughs and a fun story to tell your friends.  Builds character. 😀
---
You are welcome.    Can’t take full credit.  I found that list in another post.
---
I would probably lose 100 pounds if I can just dump my duplicate plans
---
not to mention introducing another form of currency
---
I think bethesda is going to like this too
---
This! It is happening even if you are offline during the reset.

---
 &gt; Yes, starting tomorrow you should see the extra challenges!
---
Oh man full belly chuckles. Tx
---
Fall Out with your balls out, the only way I play.
---
I did this with the quest involved with it.  And killed ghouls. All at the same time. Easiest daily yet.
---
I never use melee weapons and i don’t use power armor but i guess i need to start lmao thanks for the tip
---
Now equip strange in numbers and jump halfway to the moon...
---
Haha. Ya, I see that pretty often. I think they're plan hunting.  Server hopping into the vendor bots have what they need.  
---
If they were doing WesTek runs the xp gain would increase their bond I believe.
---
We're already being given treasury notes and scrip for doing things out in the wasteland that need to be cashed in, how is this any different?
---
If u r on mike in public team, they hear you.  I mute myself cuz of a beagle, barking her brains out.  disconnected voices come over my headset in public teams...  “hello?  Is this thing on?  Can anyone hear me? “

If i activate my mic, the beagle sees a hairy thing out the window and loses her mind...

You, my teammate hears “ghouls north, lets baaaaaaaah  whoooooo. Baaah woooooo”
---
Bango.

Damn y’all certainly enjoy inserting your own messages into this. Of course it’s good to help new players out. I drop shit outside of vault 76 all the time. I was under the impression that most people do. That doesn’t change the fact that going out of your way to make other people’s lives more difficult is a dick move. Like I’ve said twice now, I don’t care if a few new players feel like sitting around and getting free xp from scorched earth, but if the event goes on for more than 10 minutes, it’s just common courtesy to leave if you aren’t contributing. No idea why that’s such a controversial concept, but I guess people enjoy piling on people without understanding what they’re saying.
---
Its a bug, take advantage of it while you can
---
we need an "I need to take a scrap emote"
---
At one point in time, it gave it to the whole server (which oddly seemed appropriate since the quest was "Feed the People"), so I don't have an issue with that.  Those coming in on the tail end were likely going to sit outside the fence anyway, so no sweat off my back just stay out of my line of fire if you aren't going to help.
---
First time in glassed caverns as part of the quest line. Just the whole thing. I was struggling from the start but i pressed on. By the end of it everything was broken. Down to my last few stims. I had to keep running from the **REDACTED** to find a gun in my inventory that i had ammo for. I did it with like 5 bullets left and i was physically and mentally drained. 
---
The 2nd time i was there on a different character i was like 130 and i was just like 'YOOHOOO IT'S YA BOI' and then everything got PEW PEW PEWD.
---
I'm lvl 365, and I admit, I took someone's bag last week.
---
They were Wanted, about lvl 150, and hiding in their locked train car. After checking the doors, I tried doing explosive damage through the walls, but I don't think it was effective.
---
Then they started doing emotes, which is when I noticed part of their bed was clipped through the wall. I rolled into their bed, and back out, to appear behind them.
---
They had a bunch of junk on them, so in this one case, I took it as a prize. If they didn't taunt, I would have left it. I leave other wanted players bags.
---
Well it's more appealing than fighting the thing for 15minutes and wasting thousands of rounds on it and getting nothing for your troubles. Why bother to play the game at all? Why kill anything? Why play video games? You do it for fun.
---
Ah I see, thanks
---
I take her on in my private server solo all the time and haven’t had issues. Maybe it’s that there’s too many ppl who have op weapons which in turn gives you the rubber band effect on her life, meaning you are doing too much damage to fast and it’s healing her instead of killing her. That’s my thoughts on it. Like I said I haven’t had issues. Even with three ppl fighting her. Usually goes down in 10-15 mins
---
I guess I either misread or misunderstood your original comment. I was under the assumption that you were level 413. If you're actually only level 40 then it should be even easier for you to level up. If you are level 413 then how the hell did you grind that many levels in 5 months without getting burnt out? Lol
---
Well no actually. I'd suggest you try it out on a private server with a few friends.
---
The Power Armor bench plan is obtained by doing the Excavator quest at Garrahan Mining Co. It opens at level 25 so you should be able to complete it. 
---
The best way to level up is to join a full events team and complete an event. You'll get double XP the even normally gives plus the event items.
---
Any plans for compensating the S.C.O.R.E?
---
Edit: personally I have had this happen 2 times.
---
I haven't seen a colossus yet. My buddy says they're only in the test servers right now.  Can anyone confirm that for me?
---
That's definitely what happend.lol.those brown bags are so tiny yet so noticeable.use a container if you have access a private world
---
I definitely agree, but if you're making the event more difficult for the people completing it, it's common courtesy to leave. Read my comment before you assume you know what I'm saying
---
Shop my tse gauss from the beginning days might be worth something?
---
I mainly like it because of Herd Mentality. Makes it easier to get in to bonus stats now with the public groups.
---
Threw a plasma grenade at a landed Scorchbeast. Forgot that they *can* still use their AoE sonic attack on the ground, even if they usually prefer to charge and melee. Needless to say, that plan blew up in my face.
---
I have no idea I just keep all mine
---
I am lvl 413 in 5 months...lvl 40 in SCORE.
---
Anyone ever play this when the server is laggy. It’s impossible.
---
I have a fence, there is one gate into my camp.  It is marked with that HUGE American flag from the Atomic shop.  5 steps forward, you're at my first vending machine!  And if you can't find the next 3 right in a row, I really can't help you.  But feel free to grab some purified water when you stop by!
---
hmmm time to change my price ... I sold it for 300 caps
---
If they are essential, you won't be able to drop them.
---
I would sell my soul for spiral stairs
---
No one that's there and can comfortably do a SBQ run is going to judge you for "leeching".
---
I personally think it's funny to be surrounded by 300+ (I'm lvl 130) and see a level 20-something running out there like "I'm the TANK!" lol
---
Shrug their petty nonsense of others off and have fun. They have their own weird problems to deal with and are just trying to take it out on you.
---
Does anyone buy ammo from the ammo vending machines on a regular basis? I always consider all of the game world vending machines pretty steep for what they sell. Is that just me?
---
I absolutely agree with you, but like i've said multiple times at this point, if a low level is making the event uncompletable (I've seen this happen more than once) it's common courtesy to leave and let the people contributing to the event finish it. I have no issues with a few low levels hanging out for some free xp, but if half of the event timer's run down and we've only just gotten her down to regen, a few low levels leaving will lower her hp pool significantly and make the event completable
---
This is great. So many different ways people have been affected, I hope they get sorted out.
---
Its the thrill of it. Wondering if you're gonna run out of bullets or aid before you can kill it. It's helping others do it. Reviving people. Taking out the spawns. It's why i refuse to ever play bloodied because i feel like i would give up on the game after a week. 
---
I agree with the getting nothing for it. Should be a guaranteed 3* bit of gear but that's not the point.
---
Didn’t get burnt out cause of Wastlanders and grinding out the new gear/weapons. But I don’t want to lvl up every day.
---
Well yes actually, it has been datamined, there is no scaling. I suggest you actually do some research before running your mouth.
---
I don't have much experience with Melee, but IMO the best 2h is a good Grognak Axe. Never used any 1h.
---
And about the DCG/Power fist, with full perks the difference in armor penetration between the two weapons is just 5%, so negligible imo.
---

If you die at the end you do.

Yeah... I find it a bit strange that we can change the gender of our character any time we want, but the character name is fixed.
---
ps4
---
Do you have a link? Because at this point it's just your (Admittedly rude and antagonitic) word against mine.
---
I can’t think of any that I removed, that weren’t bound because of questing, that I needed later. I admittedly dropped my tapes late in the game, so I probably already did everything they could be used for.
---
Worst case, you have to go find a holotape again or request help from Bethesda support, but you should be good to drop the load!
---
I get the thrills for killing it fast, and trying to get faster. If you enjoy taking your time with things, more power to you. Would it be possible that people enjoy different things in life? Or is there only one correct way of doing things?
---
Probably the influx of new people are decreasing those that are able to do the event
---
Good point, no, I don't think there is.
---
There’s a holotape for the dyer sewers mission (Ellas research) and one for the nuke silo status (forget which that’s called). I’d keep those two at least. Not sure if you can redo the chemical purge at Dyer but I’ve been meaning to try it. There may be others to keep. My approach was to drop anything that was audio. Those recordings really should be separate from holotape programs.
---
The first thing you should do as soon as you capture a workshop is plop down a stash box and stash all your scrap.
---
I noticed it happens when a lot of players are nearby. Like at Fasnacht using it was suicide.
---
Until actual new content is put out, all these ideas amount to nothing. 
---
I'm sorry but new ways to do the same things as we've been doing for 2 years is... horse shit... to be quite honest.
---
You're assuming I have a friend lol but thanks I got one
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbuz2r/psa_scorchbeast_queens_health_does_not_scale_with/
---
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did wrong.
---
Bethesda, are you taking notes? We want this one! lol
---
You're right.  I wasn't trying to imply that some people couldn't use them at their level, but it did sound that way.
---
yes!  If I see the Breach and Clear notification when it pops up, I can totally solo that event.  But if it's already on the map when I log in, and I get there with 40 seconds left.  Sorry Motherlode, I did not have enough time to clear the area...
---
It'll be especially interesting to see how much the double xp and then the score weekend help.
---
The crit weekly was super easy too once i actually figured out how to do crits lol
---
There is no NDA, and there are a lot of videos on youtube by popular Fallout youtubers that showcase the perks pertty in depth.
---
Btw, at the moment in the Public TS rank one of all cards is free, and didn't tell us "we only made it free to help you test them more freely" so they should be free in the live game as well, unless something changes in the next two months. I hope it doesn't change, but if it does, I hope they would at least tell us. 
---
IMO It would be unacceptable to make us work to unlock rank 1 if they don't radically alter the rank up costs before.
---
Anytime 😁 have over 1700 hours in so need to know best ways to gain xp  lol.
---
So, in part, we're adding some extra daily challenges this week (just like we had some extra ones over the weekend), we have an event coming up that will give double S.C.O.R.E. for daily challenges, and we're adding some extra challenges near the end of the season as well. Beyond that I don't have any specific info right now, but I will see what I can find out.
---
Well damn that's my bad then. I rescind my statements.
---
That being said, you should consider chilling out a bit. By far you're one of the most heated people i've met in this sub.
---
now I want to see this ingame
---
Thank you!!
---
He really do be kinda sexy though
---
Nuka Moth: His blood's in it!
---
Also Canned Meat Stew will give 5% xp gains. Cannot be stacked with relish or cobbler. 
---
This can be rewarded from the Event Mama Dolces 👍
---
Blursed comments!
---
I used to feel the same way when I was killed by someone when plenty of other workshops were available. But they obviously don't want the workshop and are looking to PvP and that's something I've came to just accept and don't take workshops anymore unless I'm in private. If you're on xbox, you're welcome to add me so you can farm to your heart's content without anyone bothering you if you don't have 1st.
---
Hah, good luck.
---
We're able to start paying for levels soon. I fully expect them to go radio silent after they "fix" the issue. They realize the victims of the bug will either have to pay to catch up or grind like crazy. Something this serious would've been patched within the first week if they really cared, not on the verge of week 3 in a 10 week season.
---
Yaaas!
---
Heavy All Rise for 2h
---
I wish my challenges would complete themselves :(
---
I have the scavenger and it works great. Can’t compare as I don’t have the communist one.
---
10% with carnivore. Just like squirrel stew is 10% normal and 20% with carnivore.

What video walkthrough did you use? Can you paste the link? All I can find are the ones for Atlas Observatory. My game tells me to go to National Radio Astronomy Research Center but then inside there is no marker and I have searched everything inside and no scanner upgrade.
---
I'm getting 12% with a maxed out cola nut.
---
I am planning on joining the b2525 fixer club.at this rate it will be soon.able to get a pair or decent roll guns.

You on Xbox?
---
Once, I looted a bunch of circuitry off of the imposter sheepsquatch at the end of Encryptid, only to immediately die to its post-death explosion. And before I could respawn I got the message "Another player has taken your dropped loot."
---
Like, seriously? The event had literally just ended, and I had no other scrap on me. But someone still decided to steal it anyways.
---
Bongo
---
Sometimes it bugs out, unequip and re-equip the gun and it should stop the bug for a while.....
---
Actually, PLEASE log in to NW anyway, I suck at PvP and could use the target practice ;-)  (I get shot a lot, and blown up, burned up, eviscerated, eaten by ghouls, kinda morbid, really...)
---
The first rank is probably going to remain free, since the "cost" of getting the first ranks is just unlocking the slots. And the first ranks of each legendary perk are designed/balanced around being available when we make brand new characters.
---
This is odd since pre-wastelanders I could craft psychotats. It was the only chem I would use psycho for. Now it is gone. Very odd. Not thinking of Fo4, I've not played that game since Fo4Beta.
---
thanks all for the replies! it helped a lot
---
it was! i didnt scroll it so i couldnt find it

There is also a lv 3 one at the Poseidon workshop, to the right of the Fusion Core generator

No worries hope you like the trick in your camp 👍

Hi! We tried this out over the weekend, and we're going to add the bonus challenges back for the rest of the week until July 20. So you should have 9 dailies again starting tomorrow!
---
Theyre not the strongest 2h melee options but I like the spear and pitchfork because they're the only 2h medium swing speed weapons. And the pitchfork has a flaming mod that looks pretty cool.
---
scavenger collects junk and scrap. communist collects a small amount of food and weapons, plus the occasional commie flier. if you get both you can mix and match. i bought both and now have a communist bot collecting junk
---
You cold vpn to said country, just be prepared with some heavy lag
---
It's not consistent. Some people seem to be getting it near constantly since the patch. I only saw it for the first time a couple of days ago and then it's been gone since. I haven't noticed any pattern, but I don't really have any kind of decent sample since it shows up so rarely for me.
---
You can send them pictures 🤔

Yeah, the downsides of SS armor is you do need to complete the faction quests, and it is “expensive”: 750 gold bullion per plan, and then you need to spend scrip to get a “legendary module” to craft it (and the legendary effect you get from crafting is random). Then the mods are another 100-500 gold per mod plan.
---
Marine armor isn’t bad at all; try to get the Buttressed mod for the limbs, which provides the best DR.  The Dense mod for the chest really helps reduce the damage from Scorchbeast sonic attacks.  Deep Pockets for the secondary mod might be useful since you’re carrying heavy weapons.  I’d also suggest dropping 1 point from Ironclad and getting a rank 1 Fireproof card (it further helps against explosive attacks).
---
Quick edit: I think your BoS Combat armor may actually be the best DR available aside from the new SS armor.
---
Lol what u get?
---
We did two prior same group of players no problems. third one right before reset. Man she just wouldn't go down. I'll be farming in a little to recoup my resources for tomorrow. Just an excuse to play and get more experience.
---
Hey, it’s a rough life out here in the Wasteland. A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do in order to survive.
---
Great info thanks!
---
I don't feel bad for wanted people.
---
I checked because mine said very well rested idk for how long but saw it when 23 mins left and it was 25% xp bonus, thinking it's the new lunch boxes.
---
I ignore the buy only vendors like the ammo shops so much that when I notice one, my brain has a spasm in its attempt to access memories to even know what the fuck these things are.
---
Besides that she definitely needs to play more than one melody over and over again, I just listen to radio appalachia from time to time and I already know every lyrics from every single song in there. They need to add more song in general.
---
I’ve only felt that way once and it was last week. We beat the SBQ and everyone ran off to deposit loot. Something buggy happened and my AP wouldn’t refresh so I was walking back and got hit by a Mirelurk King.
---
A level 300+ stood there and watched me bleed out and snagged my flux. I thought it was a crappy thing to do but also...whatcha gonna do? I gave him a thumbs down, he did the moth man dance and we went our merry ways.
---
Wow, I started playing 3 months ago, and have only reached lvl 27... 😮
---
I was trying to go to your shop and it wouldnt let me, would you he willing to save that for me when I get back on in about an hour or so?

No pics or videos, sorry! It has 4 levels with stairs between each level, the stairs are directly above lower stairs

It's important to note that the only weapon it collects is broken Chinese officer's swords.
---
Liberty is a farce. The dictatorship of the proletariat is not an idea, it is truth.
---
I was about to mention that.
---
Definitely want that
---
good point. so, basically steel scrap.
---
Mr Fuzzy tokens?
---
I dont have any idea of the price. I can make it for caps, 5.56, rare plans
---
Someone else probably hacked it already. Serve hop or find another one. I hit the one to unlock a door in the prison main lobby. Everyone is going around looking for terminals to hack today and I hear the one you went to mentioned a lot.
---
Well i often forget to use rad away as a bloodied build in nuke zones when I'm hunting for materials for flux. But its the best dead animation i looks like you trips over something and take a face dive to the ground 😅 or gun fu swap with explosive weapons.
---
Also by the Charleston fast travel point
---
They are on the normal servers, there are several places that you can nuke for a 10% chance of a spawn. 
---
On the PTS server there is a new event with a Colossus. It is much harder than the normal one in adventure.
---
While I dont fit into either catagories I cant blame players for playing the game how it was intended.
---
Now if they were farming junk by taking out low level players repeatedly that would be disappointing.
---
You don’t haha you don’t actually gain any S.C.O.R.E!
---
Thank you for the rapid response. I did notice over the weekend there were extra challenges! Looking forward on what’s to follow. Do you have a set day the extra challenges will be added this week?
---
That sounds great, reminds of the first time I went through the mine dungeon in Fallout 4 where it was just an exhaustingly, completely unexpected dungeon where there just was so much happening all at once.
---
LOVE it.  love everything about it.  ran into him a few minutes ago, and he always cheers me up !
---
Generals steakhouse and Huntersville are manageable at level 35 too.
---
No, you can't tame any cryptids or scorchbeasts. Closest would be a sloth.
---
You can find a friendly Mothman at the Landview Lighthouse event!
---
Otherwise they're rare random events. You can look up where random events happen and try to farm one.
---
Definitely. Everything is getting duped at the moment so values are down overall but people especially like TSE legacies.
---
Odd, might be time to file a ticket with BGS on that one. At least one of the Crater quests should be active, for me they seem random and don't always alternate.
---
Damn alright, thank you.
---
This is still happening? Jesus, that final winter coat reward must take a crazy amount of XP to get compared to the glowing skeleton. I play NW from time to time normally and still don't have it.
---
You cannot tame any cryptids with the exception of sloths and snallygasters. Hope this helps. There's guides on Yt to show which creatures you can tame
---
Doesn't it say, started x mins ago and x participants
---
aww man, alright, thanks my dude, at least I can still get the almighty S L O T H, that would be a better cult tbh, The Cult Of Sloth
---
They won’t because there’s no Better Troll for Bethesda than to force an online weight limit &amp; then give us Missiles - 40mm Grenades - 2mm EC things &amp; Just Heaviness Itself.
---
Thanks my dude
---
The only one I wasn't super fond of was repair 10 armor or weapons! Seemed like a lot to me, maybe 3-5 would be better
---
I'm on pc, and thanks, I'll keep going and hopefully get water purifiers soon. I found a list of items with lead I plan to grab when I see them, like paint, barbells, aluminum cans and most toys. The ammo struggle is real. I'll look for that ammo perk for sure.
---
Appreciate it. I am in PC and yeah I normally don’t ave workshops, but it’s a Score thing today.
---
I think once you own one Collectron, for each one you buy, you can select what they search for. For example, I own them all, and currently I have the Fasnacht one. I can set him to get junk, scrap, Christmas gifts (not actual gifts like during Christmas time though), etc. I currently have my Fasnacht to search for junk.
---
It's going back up to 9 tomorrow. They tried it for the weekend, probably looked at the data today, and are reactivating it until the 20th.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hqnbwx/comment/fxz4d4e
---
They probably won't because they claimed they fixed challenges getting autocompleted if you played Nuclear Winter in a session before heading over to adventure mode. Making a public statement pretty much means they have to say "Hey, you know that thing we said we fixed? It turns out we accidentally made it worse", and they'd rather bring attention to upcoming content instead of the real problems with the game.
---
If you die after the SBQ event you lose your flux and it goes back to the land of Todd, the player did not take it. It is something that was added a long time ago to stop people from abusing pvp to steal flux after the event.
---
Well there ya go folks xD i also run PA, but without ricochet and dodgy, action boy on duty here too, thou i read here sometime ago that it doesnt work for now, like adrenaline. So, yea it melts me quite easy, but theres always room to improve.
---
Cranberry Glade has turned up a lot of tamable sloths for me as well.
---
Are you telling me, I can sell my legendaries for reeeeeal money ¿
---
Bashing sometimes helps.
---
Ah, I skipped doing that one myself. Thanks, I'll bring this one up too!
---
Yes, starting tomorrow you should see the extra challenges!
---
The fasnacht one collects candy and booze and sometimes empty bottles. Also royal jelly which makes royal jelly taffy
---
I got a bloodied hatchet 40%fss 1+ str lol
---
2/3 of each server are newbies
---
I'm pretty sure the CAMP budget is as low as it is so it doesn't slow down the servers, because in fallout 4 if I made my settlement super big with like a lot of stuff, I would feel the game visibly lag when I first got near it.
---
          So I assume when a server with like 15 plus people on it the game's going to Lag out pretty bad but hopefully Bethesda can fix this sometime.
---
Thanks, was wondering if there was another way.
---
r/gonewildappalachia
---
My man and here let me price check it for ya
---
5-11k is it’s value
---
No problem. Plus there's lots of sloth camp stuff! I should really display some of the sloth toys but my budget just can't stretch any further.
---
I think the bond is just time based, so they will be bonded after 5 minutes, but they leave before that so none of us are getting a bonus from them
---
I hope so. But I’ll probably have to wait for another year....
---
This man speaks the truth. Flux dropping was change probably about a year ago and now it will just disappear. Just find someone's FO1st tent and deposit ASAP after the queen fight.
---
Based on what u think it cant be done solo?
---
It is my favorite event so far and I did it solo a lot of times.
---
The game already struggles to load camps (at least on xbox) with the budget it has. People who exploit and have a bigger budget risk having stuff in their stash bought because of the slowness (it may have been fixed recently. I don't read patch notes) of the camp loading.
---
There's perks to make your weapons and armour more durable. Also perks in luck that can fix them when using them or getting hit.
---
I always hit the spots north of Abbie's Bunker, but recently found the East Ridge Lookout consistently spawns an event right at where you load in--makes for easy server hopping, as much as I hate doing that.
---
Make a smaller camp
---
Nice. I got downvoted for giving you the right answer. Reddit is cancer lol
---
This is a good idea but rather something for a single player game, since Multiplayergames need to have a balance.
---
That’s insanely overpowered.
---
It's likely so small so a full lobby of large camps would bug out weaker machines. Though more camp would be nice.
---
My tactic for decoration is to keep it small. Large rooms will consume too much budged. Also, turrets take a lot of budget space. So place them tactically or just don't use them.
---
Oh I’ve had some great battles in Whitesprings! Once me and my friend were there to get some legendaries for a daily. We were in the clubhouse. My friend went down but could be revived. But between us was about 8 ghouls.
---
I backed into the bathroom so they couldn’t surround me. With my trusty fire axe I hacked them down as fast as I could! I managed to survive and revive my friend, literally on the last second! 
---
That was a recent one. But I’ve had a lot of great battles! Sometime 4 way battles where three different groups plus us end up ruling it out.
---
I'll have to check that one out, that's exactly how it is at the Cranberry Glade but different locations have different events sometimes. One bonus of the glade is that sometimes you can find items for Ward's daily just laying on the ground right on your load in screen without even having to move your view at all. If you don't scrap it his quest will auto complete each day when you talk to him.
---
I seem to recall there being a set up north at the WV Lumber Company site in the barn on the right side of the complex. The Wade Airport runway has a locked trailer (protected by landmines and a level 2 lock) on the south end that also has a starter Raider set.
---
Oh, so this is why I keep seeing so many half-finished camps? I always assumed it was because they ran out of resources, lol.
---
Ah drat. Well best of luck then:) I'd suggest staying crouched towards the edge of the circle, and as soon as it's claimed, run out of it then fast travel away. If you're just going for the claiming part of it for score.
---
This seems to be generally hold true, but yesterday I had a level 50-something guy follow me around for a decent while when we were on a building team together. I couldn't ask him what he was looking for because I'm not mic'd and we don't have text chat, but I felt bad because I was literally just wandering around and not doing anything interesting whatsoever.
---
They can hit through terrain, if you've got a mole rat, robot, or whatever buried in the ground not appearing you can hit them, almost all other explosions don't do this
---
This is the play for sure.
---
Last 2 times I tried to build a camp there a bravo would spawn and attack along with its minions right after I would place the generator after several attempts with two toons i gave up.
---
It would be a great spot if there was not a fissure literally within spitting distance of the location. I wish there was a similar spot in the savage divide, I know there isn't though.
---
I'm at 47, the big thing I want is 50. I'll hit that this week.
---
I honestly just dump them in front of people using power armour. I can't be bothered to sell them in my vending machine. They weigh too much in my limited stash for me to care about the potential caps I lose.
---
my favourite thing to do at Whitesprings was back in the early days of the game when they would infinitely spawn robots. me and my buddies, all being level 15 at the time would just fight off endless waves of level seven Miss Nanny's. It was so fun and we were laughing at.the fact they kept spawning!
---
I couldn't believe how many high level feral ghouls there were. If I hadn't of had my power arm I would have been totally screwed. And even with that I blew through an absurd amount of stimpacks.
---
Thats why i stay inside the terminal wntil my teammates are ready to recall the robot.
---
Its my keycard its my choice to start the recall process.
---
Yeah I'm thinking that too. Maybe a bug from gamepass and a lot more people playing from gamepass that is causing problems with the servers or something
---
They are too busy trying to fix the dupe glitch.
---
Owning both, I have a deep love for my communist collectron and a passive enjoyment for the normal one. 
---
In short. Communist Collection Station
---
Like others have said you want to build small if you intend on decorating thoroughly. As much as I'd love another budget increase I doubt we'll get one.
---
Also the turrets, crops, and resource gathering items like brahmin will eat up a ton of budget. A *ton*. If you don't really need them then get rid of 'em.
---
Check Camp McClintok. Inside the main building sometimes and a regular spawn in the closed port-a-potty outside the quonset huts.
---
Makes too much sense 🤔🤔🤔
---
We don’t wear PA at Whitesprings because we like the challenge. We’ve also used the cars when the ghouls swarm. Honestly I love a good ghouls swarm! 
---
I really wish there were more places that had this level of monsters
---
Yeah. a quad LMG would hold like over 9000 rounds or something
---
How about Bethesda fix the damn auto-complete first
---
That’s the problem with my builds I like to build them grand but run out of budget to put all the deco and style into it
---
I hate the revive players challenge.
---
Kinda is in a odd way isn’t it? You can use caps again 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Just a quick question on this one.... 
---
Vendors get emptied when you move your camp??? 
---
I literally haven't moved my camps in months xD so I actually have no clue.... I know everything is taken out when I scrap one and place a new vendor machine... but moving your camp also emptied them?? That just seems stupid imo...
---
50 caps. I'll give you 60 though.
---
I should have said “weren’t in Appalachia” then. 
---
https://www.gamesradar.com/bethesda-explains-the-perceived-brotherhood-of-steel-retcon-in-fallout-76/
---
From a purely annoyance point of view, the communist one has the least grating voicelines. At least in my opinion. It just seems quieter and less irritating.
---
You came at just the right time for the new community event! Check all the train stations you find for rare legendary gear put there by other players for you to find!
---
I highly doubt it’s worth 60 caps
---
Why just made you look stupid but ok
---
Gives us working people a chance to run the board.
---
That’s EXACTLY what I was thinking!!!
---
I’ve always used cap rarely 5.56
---
You can do a lot with the budget, even without any glitches. I've got a village build with 10 distinct structures. I've seen a lot of really impressive builds out there. 
---
Don't use turrets and limit your lighting, that stuff adds up in your budget.
---
 [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/) 
---
according to that it's 35k+
---
I don’t wanna leave the Congo oh no no no no no
---
FINE! 70 caps. Cos i like you.
---
So have they done anything about it or no?
---
If your lower level, at least your camp budget increases as you level up, so I've heard..
---
I’m sure there are 10,000 of those out on the market right now.
---
Make your price and thats it.
---
Nope, 0 chance that will happen. What's wrong with the economy? Oh yeah that's right, NOTHING! Everyone has something of value of now and there's finally balance now. PVP isnt reserved to the players who had/bought legacy's, no more shi**y RNG trying to get a rare outfit that had under a 1% drop rate. This was the best thing to happen to this game, no more greedy scumbags.
---
Somebody just told me it’s worth 35k
---
Here here! *knocks on table*
---
I don’t think so
---
They're already here! Seen this one yet?
---
[https://imgur.com/nPjZmp7](https://imgur.com/nPjZmp7)
---
Roflmao xD I stopped smoking pot literally a decade ago and I can still relate to this today xD xD xD when I'm dead tired and corny af I get into the same vibe I used to get in while baked and I make mistakes like that xD 
---
Your comment just made way too much sense to a "no-longer-stoner" Roflmao
---
Somebody tried vying it from me for 70 caps
---
Lmaoo 7k? I’m at work atm for 3kore he’s, but if u get a better offer take it otherwise I should be on
---
Yeah actually the people who just played for wastlanders can buy legacy’s so it kinda good
---
I have no problem prepping the silos, just not a fan of being the only one using the keycards.
---
Deathclaw plushie?!?! I need it
---
I'm not aware of one.  Are you talking about the Giant Sheepsquatch Plush?
---
Purely rng
---
This AND letting us convert ammo in bulk for the love of God!!!
---
I spent an HOUR converting ammo yesterday. I could have used that time to farm ammot mats instead. It would have felt more rewarding.
---
Just as rare as any rare gun
---
I have a nice instigating explosive one. not that i use it. The Instigating lever is better.
---
I agree it's an annoyance. I'm often seeking out workshops myself. Freaking VATS is the worst.
---
Ya know, there's still a very fun way to get that workshop when it's owned. And it doesn't even involve chasing down stupid molerats.  ;-)
---
Cool idea but keep in mind that these perks at only supposed to be as powerful as max level perks from previous titles
---
I honestly don't even need the modules from me scrapping legendaries.... just need the stash room xD id be totally fine with them just giving scrap, a chance to unlock some mod and maybe (a chance for) a loose mod item that was attached to the gun....
---
The legendary modules would be nice but I honestly don't even need them xD just let me scrap my way too heavy 1 and 2 star weapons xD
---
I just need one, and have no idea how to get one.
---
They do exist and they’re probably rare. I have an IE Less VATS
---
Yeah I can launch the nuke easily I just can't take the queen down alone ha. Everytime I've launched only like 2 people joined
---
Dont worry, its yours.
---
That was me
---
That was also me
---
I'd say the people who want to cheat and have every best item in the game for nothing when some people have put hundreds of hours into the game are the greedy scumbags
---
Edit: and no, I don't have legacies, or b2525 weapons, or anything like that
---
When you're browsing your files in the FO76 folder, sort by type. Scroll down until you see the file type "configuration settings". The fourth file should simply say "Project76". That's the correct ini file.
---
It’s worth a pretty penny
---
Seems to be the case for me, 0900 Pacific every day since SCORE went live.
---
Oh I didn’t read the name
---
Ah that’s what I’ve heard too but like I said I’m willing to take a -10 or -15 dr/Er hit. Just don’t want it to be like 20+ less dr. You think fire proof is better? Do explosions ignore dr?
---
What do you mean "careful"?
---
Covert Operative is perfectly fine if you're a stealth build with guns.  Mister Sandman is more conditional, relying on nighttime to work, but if you've got the points for it, why not?
---
Are you thinking about stagger effects on the Queen?
---
EVERY time I submit a ticket I get a blow-of response.
---
Bethesda's customer service is fucking atrocious.
---
I would settle for a fucking 'convert multiple at once' button
---
Yeah, somebody got to it first. Try the Charleston Fire Dept. Lvl1 Hack. Near the workbenches and protections. But I'd imagine that would be popular as well. I jumped on a private server to do it this morning.
---
They do exist - may seem more rare than more popular guns such as B2525 fixers/handmades because people dont tend to go to crazy with duping hunting rifles
---
Don't know friend. Killed 5 today, no problems.
---
And a Quad .50 cal with expanded magazine would be like 20k rounds.
---
Probably whatever you want, really.  For a non-Bloodied or Junkie build, that's probably one of the best "all-around" rolls for a Lever Action.
---
Imho the greedy scumbags would be the one to use a 3rd party site to sell items for real $$$. I’m glad to see that part get hurt. Hundred dollars weapons now 10bucks and even that’s a rip off 🤣
---
And their sausages are the wurst!! hahaha I jest
---
The best 2h is pole hook due to damage and reach. 1h... I’m unsure
---
Those are the people that had poor first impressions of the game and want everyone to hear them sook.
---
Every single game has bugs, 
---
I never played fallout series for its game play mechanics, I loved the story and world progression.
---
Just tell them that it's your alt character and you are doing the sbq character buff exploit.
---
Then ignore everything else they do. Be prepared to ignore and block them.
---
Possum, squirrel, chicken?
---
I always wave and shut doors I like to come by and see everyone’s creations and see what they’ve got set up for their camp hope I see you around I’m on the Xbox
---
I'm not talking about any of the instanced, player-initiated events, just the public open world ones that run on a timer as soon as they appear.  Those are the ones that drop off after the timer stops regardless of participation.  Think Fly Swatter, Powering up, etc.
---
Dude this pissed me off one day. No one comes early it seems, you gotta give them at least 5 mins before you start it. So after a few times I got tired of it, had my gf watch for people zoning in while I use the computer holding it, waiting. Some jackass shows up instantly, moves me with his power armor somehow which I didn’t know was possible, starts event, then camps rooftop doing nothing. I had to grab all pylons and run in circles for a few mins before people showed up. I used over 80 stimpaks. It was stupid lol.
---
If someone hacked it before you, you can't hack it again.  Try a different terminal or hop servers.
---
Cool more fake threads. video/ picture proof or leave and dont come back
---
To be fair I'm only level 27, so level 62 in droves would have completely overwhelmed me and I never would have gotten the sword. I would love to not have to, hah.
---
I’ve been playing since beta, level 502.  Even took a couple months off.  Was white spring farming for a long time back in the day and leveling wasn’t an issue.
---
I do hope we get enclave event later abd you get to pick BoS or Enclave to join. It would add great 2 new factions into the world and some exclusive hear perhaps like x02 power armour or x03 //heavy incisor flame weapon. 
---
I would've that. 
---
Because what if I don't want bos?
---
Ehh, that's rough. I usually just try to make sure there are at least 2 or 3 active public groups. Either see how many people do an event first or join a group before prepping. Usually works for me.
---
That's weird, most of the players I know who put hundreds hours in the game had no legacy's until this last weekend. Also they didn't cheat, the games vendor bots were selling them. That and the B2525 Handmades and Fixers. Other vendor bots had rare outfits too. 
---
I find it interesting and ironic that the games economy was in fact used to balance everything out for once.
---
You got a shit weapon buddy if you burned thru 6k 45 my bud still only has a basic fixer and did itninnless ammo also try using damage increaseing perks
---
I'll agree that real money trading is an issue, but it's not solved by making hundreds or thousands of hours of people's effort completely worthless
---
Mister sandman is broken...if you apply mister first and then covert you only get 3.50x damage instead of 3.75x you would if you applied covert first and then mister sandman...so I'm wondering if any other perks have the same issue
---
As someone who does enjoy playing with a team but can still enjoy the game solo I want to say that it really isnt up to anybody to "enrich" YOUR experience. 
---
Not sharing a perk card is not lacking team spirit. "Sharing is caring" and all, but I have no doubt that if someone shares a card that YOU dont like or need, you'd kick them because you can't benefit off them. 
---
It's not other players responsibility to make your experience on the game enjoyable. You should be able to do that alone, and if you cant or have tried and dont feel that enjoyment, this Fallout game might just be one that doesnt capture your attention. 
---
That happens, dont make it someone else's responsibility to make your experience better. That's not teamwork. 🙃
---
...block him?
---
as for me I didnt. "magic" weapons are so magic.
---
There is no deathclaw plushie, it's a sheepsquatch and it's one of the score rewards.
---
Anybody who accepts an obviously duped item is cheating just as much as the dupers themselves.
---
Console.
---
I would love different friends list and different names per toon. You could actually play in different styles and roles without people getting butt hurt.
---
Ok that's good to know. I'll be farming for ammo and such later. Prepping for the new week. I do love SBQ it's great XP and the sound of guns blazing. The sounds are so good.
---
Yeah I'll just keep checking ha I'm sure I'll find a good lobby
---
Ah, right.
---
Those are the only two I'm aware of that have this problem.
---
My username is enriqueaguilarx
---
I think a recent update broke camp budget, it is a lot smaller than it was.
---
I rebuilt a camp exactly as I had it pre-wastelanders and cannot finish it.
---
Wait, what ? is that a thing ? Where do you find the legendary gear ?
---
If totally desperate people sell them on eBay.
---
This 🙌
---
Did you find a suggestion? I can't equip any weapon doesn't matter how often I restart the game. They instant unequip and all I can do is punching things with my fists... I mean I need 2 heavy attacks for a Scorched deathclaw but I want to use my weapons again lol
---
Oh ok, cool!
---
Antique shop near watoga Level 2 hack
---
I feel like I speak for a lot of us when we say it makes us happy there are 9. Thank you :)
---
Use the trading subreddit, I'll PM you the link because it's not allowed to be linked here for some stupid reason.
---
isn't it amazing how the designers of Fo76 can make every aspect of the game a grind ?
---
remember how easy it was to trade with vendors in Fo4 ?  add something, remove it, change things around, then pull the trigger ... but the ammo exchanger is a terrible grind
---
Ingenious, here’s an upvote
---
Ya true for some, but that would come down to each individual perspective on the current state of the game as each person plays their own game.
---
like an ammo cryptocurrency !
---
I’ve got a 1* star instigating hunting rifle that I use to save on ammo. With no rifleman perks it hits for 1500 to 2000 damage.
---
I'll help ya out
---
^^ this, trading subreddit is incredibly helpful I’d be surprised if someone didn’t give you one
---
My bad I didn't notice it was only 10 out of those, but I haven't tested chickens or squirrel yet so they could very well be bugged too.
---
It's still not acceptable that something as simple as checking if you've killed a fucking frog doesn't work in this game.
---
For your level, well... Wait until level 50 then you should start chasing good weapons. My favorite legendary weapon is: Bloodied Explosive Handmade with prime receiver and 25 % less V.A.T.S. Action Point cost.
---
I tried to post there but I kept getting the post format wrong. Lol
---
Maybe it does look like a Sheepsquatch as well
---
The people who spent weeks or months hopping the Asylum trying to get the red outfit
---
That time is now worthless unless they're willing to cheat
---
The people who farmed legendary enemies and scrip, trying to get items good enough to trade
---
Under no circumstances should cheating be rewarded, as it is now
---
If you're stupid enough to become wanted with loot, or to take loot to an event, you deserve to lose it.
---
Well you got a chuckle out of me.
---
How do you know it was a duped item? How do any new players know that when they are simply buying an item from a vendor? 
---
There's no proof, it's simply an item being sold at the vendor. Don't get mad at the players, it's Bethesda and this buggy game that can't keep their house in order. There will always be something in this game that's "broken". They delay releases of new content and theres still bugs from day one that haven't been fixed.
---
Except that Vault-Tec was created by a different company entirely 22 years ago.
---
Ohhh okay well that clears that up lol
---
You need to scrap it from the top down. You cant remove stuff that's supporting stuff above it.
---
Rofl had a good chuckle at that topic xD such entitlement... it's a bloody game... everyone will be playing at their own pace and for their own enjoyment... don't like it... good luck and move on... don't bitch and moan about it that others need to do something because you want it xD 
---
Loved that there were a few that actually trolles the guy and kept commenting on the thread xD 
---
Sometimes I'm just amazed by people xD
---
Obviously silky means the item level cap....
---
Any advice for the kill nine creatures one? Fuckers seem to avoid me.
---
I’ll have to keep searching, I can usually one shot most enemies and I’m in the process of maximizing my build and it seemed like a good choice.
---
It doesnt turn into a meatpile?
---
My personal favorite ledgendary is a furious explosive 15% faster reload LMG, cuts through enemies like butter but eats up ammo like there's no tommorow
---
Is this for the possum badges? Those challenges used to be bugged and they fixed it. Maybe it got unfixed last patch.
---
I've got about 5300 atoms stocked up, but that would only get me to the beginning of the blue section of the board. 
---
There's no point in buying ranks until the last few weeks, or if you know you aren't going to progress any further because you're gonna be be busy doing other stuff.
---
Maybe don’t decorate it so much. There’s more to this game than camp decorating. Oh wait, no there isn’t. The only people still playing only care about cosmetics. Hence this lame cosmetic ridden battle pass.
---
If someone is wanted I always emote, take me’ out and guard the loot.
---
Claiming a workshop is the same as saying *’Hey, everyone on the server!  I’m willing to engage in PvP. Stop on by while I’m here if you want to engage in PvP with me!’*
---
And if you volunteer for PvP, you volunteer to lose caps equal to your level (max 50) of you die along with dropping any scrap/junk you’re carrying, for **anyone** to loot.
---
For myself I have to because I get annoyed seeing 8/9 lol
---
I have the same pic with me in a stealth suit. It makes me laugh every time it comes up in the load screen because of the badass armor and the 5yr old kid like joy of riding a stationary toy.
---
I wasn’t wanted, Ryan. Chill out.
---
PvE- No
---
___________________________________________________
---
PvP- 110, no matter what weapon you are using.
---
Thanks my gamer tag is Attackdawgs5877
---
There's one in Mama Dolces office.
---
You didn't specify that it was you that had lost loot, nor how, I was speaking generally.
---
Legendary scrip limit is new
---
Because
---
The cap limit for max level weapons is lvl 50. Some only go to max of lvl 45. PvE has no cap on dmg as there are many different builds that can obtain different dmg numbers. Some of these builds can obtain dmg numbers of 1000+.
---
........that’s a thing I love my normal non legendary handmade sounds like I’d enjoy that as well
---
No the atom challenge in combat
---
so to put ur vendors where people are safe to purchase is no chance, isnt it?
---
It's a good roll, but I wouldn't say it's worth caps. At that level, it's something you use to trade for other guns
---
It was a Score requirement today, so I participated. And there other workshops to take. I did not volunteer at all for PVP. But hey, you’re so right, I am just making myself a target!
---
I'd rather people exploit to 100 than pay, Bethesda clearly designed this whole thing so most people would have to pay to complete it, fuck em.
---
burning sheep staff has highest damage for 2hand
---
Do you have damage numbers on? If she's in the air you mostly miss or do next to nothing.
---
The issue is the dupers are breaking the terms of service. Period. That alone is bannable. The fact that it's possible doesn't make it acceptable.
---
There is proof, because it is literally impossible for a person to log into a world for a few minutes and receive an exact copy of a Legacy or or other insane weapon, armour, or outfit every single time they log in or out
---
The people who traded for them should not be banned, but are cheating and all duped items should be deleted.
---
If the bugs bother people that much they should just stop playing the game, send their message that way
---
It's no reason or license for people to start cheating
---
To make you come back tomorrow.
---
And maybe you'll look at the Atomic Shop and buy something.
---
Or maybe you'll simply add to Bethesda's "Look, people are still playing this" chart.
---
To be fair - 23 seconds is enough to complete fly swatter 4-5 times.
---
I can be a conduit
---
I’m playing less and less because hard-to-earn items can be easily duped and Bethesda never go after them. It kills any sense of value in the supposedly rare items.
---
I lost my loot trying to defend a workshop. By a level 400 try hard using an explosive bloodied Gatling plasma.
---
Amen to inspirational.  I haven't had Lone Wanderer on in weeks.  15% xp!?  Gimme!
---
bruh bethesda is gonna read this and say "oh they think its too easy, that's what's wrong with the ledgendary run"
---
How did you lose it? Drop/scrip it by accident?
---
Aight man hopefully be on
---
This is probably the most balanced the market has been since day 1. The supply has increased dramatically causing the prices of the items in demand to drop low enough for people to actually be able to afford them. With caps, even. The Haves and the Have Nots are closer to equal than they’ve ever been. People can actually play the game they want to play with the weapons and armor they want to use without having to continuously repeat the same overplayed events in hopes of not getting absolute trash drops.
---
Abbie's bunker
---
Slow down the economy to keep people playing for longer and preserve the value of items/currency, and to keep power-gamers from drastically outpacing players that don't play 24/7.
---
People who bought them get banned?
---
My sentiments exactly, there's no reason to be proud of getting the "rare" or good weapons anymore
---
Personally if they don't remove the duped items by the end of The Legendary Run, I'm done with 76
---
I don't put tonnes of time in just to have cheaters get ahead of me with no effort
---
From other replies it seems like the body gets flung way far away when it explodes, but I don't think it turns into a pile.
---
I hit for 2k a shot with my bloodied auto hm
---
How is it
---
Not that I know of, and I wasn't saying they should, but they still shouldn't be allowed to keep the item
---
I wish I had the ability to give this gold. Instead I give it an up vote.
---
I try to gather ore but usually can't do it by myself unless I'm in the event right after it starts.
---
Lots of people do one cap per percentage so respectively 90 and 55 caps.  I sell them for 25 caps because they are heavy and I don’t use them.  75% or less I leave at train stations.
---
Alright, not on currently. Well the title mentioned killing 3 different types of critters. So I gave you 3 types and then you said 10. The 3 I gave are definitely critters though. Forest area has a bunch. Just wonder.
---
Two chances to stagger, weapon breaks twice as fast, bullets can “V” around a target...
---
Personally I sell them for a cap per 10 charges rounding up (67 charge would be 7 caps) but I see people do a cap per charge (so for them 67 charge would be 67 caps). I lowball because I want them out of my inventory
---
They’re the 1s who should be banned
---
So it’s not super optimal like be all end all legendary mod?
---
I believe there are only 2 bugged challenges remaining.
---
Killing large creatures, the SBQ still won’t count, and this one has to be nearly a year old.
---
The new one with complete daily quests.  If you’re like me and have 5 leveled characters that did all the quests, then you cannot complete the initial Camden park quest anymore.
---
I’ve got all but these two, killing robots without any weapon, and 7600 hours complete.  Repair swords and revive 76 people nonwithstanding as I believe these two showed up as bugs since their rewards display oddly.
---
There's ways to build for a LOT more damage (fully specialized up, a bloodied build can do roughly 10x the damage of a fresh, full health level 50 without a legendary weapon), but there's also several legendary effect/weapon combos that are bugged and can (inconsistently) do absurd damage. 
---
And if you're on PC there's also hacked weapons that do absurd damage :P
---
SBQ, Project Paradise, Line in the Sand, West Tek
---
Fallout 76 has some of the ugliest interior lighting I've ever seen in Fallout, and what's worse is those textures within buildings that seem to give off artificial light or something, so there's some places, particularly with a lot of metal surfaces, that are way too reflective for the level of brightness they have.  It's especially noticeable on guns with reflective surfaces when you're within interiors.
---
Everything is either too shiny, or too bright.  And then you have those interiors that have like some sort of hidden color-grading going on that looks really bad in darker conditions too.
---
Usually, outside lighting conditions are fine.  I think my biggest complaint is the way ambient occlusion works in both exterior and interior conditions. You can sort of see an ugly checkboard-like pattern on applicable objects, especially ones you can pick up that are briefly left behind.
---
But I really don't understand why lighting has had such a drastic change, because most of Fallout 4's lighting was good.
---
Compare a still-screenshot of Fallout 4 vs Fallout 76 and I guarantee you even Fallout 4's ugliest location will look better than Fallout 76 in still-image quality.
---
I was scripting and got distracted then went “Oh NOooo!” And promptly blue screened. So yeah its gone.
---
I'm not bothered or addicted by the legendary run, score or atom grinding but I'm still motivated to play for the fun because of the nostalgic memories I've had from fallout 3, 4 &amp; NV.
---
THIS! THIS! THIS! THIS!
---
**Yes, you did.** Read the pop-up on the screen when you claim a workshop. It says you are accepting the possibility of PvP. That means you’re volunteering for PvP while inside the workshop. 
---
End of story. 
---
Next time, stash your junk, claim the workshop for the SCORE, and then leave.
---
Some of them need to grind to trade for the item tho is that there fault
---
Welcome to the wasteland
---
Ah I see I'll prowgo down this rote thanks 👍
---
WE COMING FOR YOU, ZORBO!
---
Ugh. No.
---
Not until we get that 98,000 ammo point increase.
---
Also, that ammo converter is time limited, so unless they plan to add a basic one for free you're going to be screwing over people who didn't participate in season one
---
How is it cheating?
---
It's accepting an item that shouldn't exist, and I don't mean in the way legitimate legacies shouldn't exist
---
A duped item is like using counterfeit money, unless you printed it yourself sure it's not your fault and you won't be punished, but your money is still worthless and will be taken
---
Just as the duped items should be
---
depends on if you're buying them from a player vendor or a vendor bot I've seen player vendors sell them anywhere from 10 to 100 caps. If you have a private server you can just crank them out.
---
Is that a 3 star unyielding with.........
---
Two shot and Furious are called prefix effects and are the primary effect. Explosive is a “secondary effect” and therefore can go with one prefix. There is also tertiary effects like 90% weight reduction. Only one of each effect on a given gun that is 3*.
---
When is the last time you tried building there? I’m pretty sure they no longer spawn.  That’s my favorite spot to build.
---
No, that will sadly never be possible, because the ammo converter is a limited time reward.
---
Doesn’t sound like he had to try very hard... did he?
---
It’s a joke, kid. Get over yourself.
---
Two shot &amp; furious are in the same category. So you can only get either one of them with explosive on it.
---
Chill it’s a game not real life but people still have to grind to trade for that weapon they always wanted
---
Which variety of deathclaw gauntlet are you seeking?
---
I’m PS4 also, and have a few different 3\*’s in inventory.
---
I was thinking the other day how fun the game would be if there wasn’t a script limit.
---
I'm offline for dinner.  Probably back on by eight.  Still have it.  Edit: Online now.
---
Yea the problem is they probably don’t even have the tech to tell what’s dropped and what’s duped. What they CAN do however is simply going after a few big offenders and make an example out of them, so others will think twice before they exploit. Bethesda probably don’t really want to ban anyone because any account is a potential source of revenue, but when others play less because of the duping issue, they should so something if they’re smart.
---
No lol pointless quests is even more pointless
---
No problem
---
And just as many meat sweats
---
I’ll check when I get on tomorrow my dude as I may have the plan. I’m in the UK so I’m heading to bed now (unless you find one in between). 
---
If I do have it you’re welcome to have it for free man.
---
It randomly rewards you them. Toxic Cleanup and Stings and Things does as well.
---
They arent a guaranteed drop from them and from my experience never were. I havent had one drop for a while but its still possible
---
Get rid of the level up in nuclear winter challenge too.
---
Bait grenades.. that's how. After all this BS with them since Fasnacht, I would have expected *something* to have been done about them by now.  
---
If they can't fix them, just remove them from the bloody game. Not like many use them for their intended purpose, anyway.
---
I want a Sunny collectron!
---
Is leeching even a thing in a game where rewards aren't pooled?
---
Yes I know that. I have a cryolator I freeze her on the ground.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Thanks alot!
---
It’s crazy since this game endgame absolutely does not need amazing weapons lol
---
Okay thanks!
---
You can still gain ally status with the Raiders by doing the daily mission they give. You can also gain rep with them by selling mirelurk meat to the raiders at the Ohio River camp.
---
And no you cant get it built by someone else. Anything bought by gold bullion is treated same as Atom shop purchases
---
Tommy Lee Jones
---
Making it obtainable like explosive energy weapon now are obtainable
---
The plan is sold by vendor bot Resin, vendor bot Raider (Pleasant Valley station).
---
Harpers Ferry: Sold by Free States' vendor bot.
---
Sold by Raider vendor bots.
---
Fed76 is mostly for PC players
---
Bloodied or mutants if that is available
---
You can get every thing no matter what side you choose. Only difference is that you will gain more rep with The faction you side with. The only thing thats important is to do every quest with both factions before finishing wastelanders
---
I’d say someone else beat you to it.
---
I tried the one at morgantown airport, but it was already done.  Server hop took care of it.
---
assholes come at all levels..
---
Yes though hardly anyone high level bothers since they are not particularly efficient
---
I do 50c for full charge and they move relatively quickly. I won't buy for over 50c either though.
---
Always drop what your doing for line in the sand, easy 2-5 levels if your ready for it with exp/intel boosts an aoe weapon and a group good enough to spawn them in a clump.
---
Woah yeah, I don’t notice that till now!
---
3 missiles = 100 ammo points
---
Incidentally i have a Twoshot ultracite laser gat in my vendor, for some reason i keep getting heavy weapons, lvl 93 sniper and i have never gotten a single decent rifle from either a drop or the purveyor, i did however get every .50 machine gun and grenade launcher imaginable :/
---
I thought you could only get high enough to get ally by siding with them for the gold heist. Nice
---
I feel ya, but with this game any improvements are a sign that Bethesda can recognize the mess they made. Atleast this wasn't in the atom shop and is easily accessible to everyone.
---
I’m at the part where I have to pick a side, I’ve just been dragging my heels on it
---
Nothing as someone who can one hit them all 😏
---
Not sure where this comes from to be honest, I prefer it when the whole server turns up on my Nuke runs. 
---
As per the rumour re increased damage with more people, rubber banding is a massive issue with high fire rate weapons and sometimes it leads to some of the group with massively high damage actually healing the queen. I’ve seen it happen. 
---
Nothing to do with more players, just a stupid bug that needs to die.
---
No, that's a hacked weapon on PC. If you saw that it's 99% chance they supported a hacker by buying it on eBay. The appropriate response to these people is to spam the "fist full of cash" emote then "angry face" emote.
---
I think I've seen a couple like that on youtube, specifically a military style checkpoint. Try searching for fallout76 camp guide and sort by upload date.
---
I decided to make my sniper guy a Bloodied commando, my first week running Bloodied I killed a cargo bot in the savage divide, while I was picking the lock on the container some firecracker berries went off and killed me.
---
And it still gives a rough idea of price. Even if it was half that price on a  console. Still gives you an idea that it's worth something.
---
If you did buy more than one of each plan can I buy a spare from you?
---
I like switchblades.  Fast.  
---
Because of their speed, they can do more damage than heavier/slower 2H weapons.  
---
Ex: L50 switchblade, 80 base dmg.  L50 grognak : 180 base damage.
---
But the switchblade hits 3x in the same time it takes the grognak to hit once.
---
3x80=240 vs 1x 180 = 180.
---
FSS switchblade hits 5x.
---
thats all without power attack or foods/chems that mo diff damage.
---
My ghoul slayer FSS switchblade usually 2hits L62 charred ones, 1hits L42s.
---
.
---
It wnt make much difference Who you side with. So no worries
---
Fixer doesn’t show a slot for adding paint
---
Nope you can get ally with both factions. Its a grind of course and itll take you a while depending on where you are now with them.
---
Not anymore. It used to work like it does in fallout 4, with each bullet doing 100% of the damage listed, but now its 62.5% of the damage listed for each of the two bullets.
---
I once had a decent military style camp. Large square. The 4 corners were tall square buildings with turrets on top. Had a walkway connecting each and half walls along the walkway. In the middle of each walkway was a large tent that had a bed and one or two of the crafting stations. Food and water in the center.   Good luck!
---
An exploit is not cheating. You seeing something for sale, and buying it from a vendor that's rare doesn't make it a cheat. As I said before, I have friends who have put so much time in this game (literally thousands of hours)  and they just bought their first legacy. I think there should be a third option but there isn't.
---
Assuming Scotland ever has weather warm enough to warrant shorts
---
Get both factions to that point
---
So I’ve seen several people state the it’s a “limited time reward”. Does that mean the ammo convert won’t function or be removed from camps when the season ends?
---
They still drop. The notification appears as the Caps notification does...they don't show up in the reward section. Depending on who you talk to, there's a 10-20% chance for one to drop.
---
What I do is always stay at the edge of the fire and walk the edge. Most of the time players stay clear of it. As the fire closes I keep it on my back. When it finishes moving more NPC spawn. I was able to kill five creatures in one game this way. I'd say this is probably the most NW "work" but I enjoy the sneaking and all of that.
---
And so it’s not double damage. That sucks.
---
Glad to help haha. 
---
What is the logic with the lvl recommendation? Looks like lvl 50 is the maximum one even if you have absolutely no chance below 120.
---
I think the extras I have are AA, troubleshooters, and one other that I don’t recall.
---
aj ninetyeight.
---
If you have to choose just one, the Dense mod is notably better than the Fireproof perk (50% explosive reduction vs 15%, if the wiki is accurate).  But I still like to have 1 point of Fireproof just to gain a little more DR against explosives.  As I obtained better armor, Ironclad seemed to have less value (in my opinion), and I felt the perk points were better used elsewhere.
---
I used up my extra Improved Repair Kits from farming the queen on this challenge
---
Makes sense.  The group were using massive amounts of them to be annoying during Scorched Earth too.
---
Oddly, I do not actually have a Fallout 76 folder within " c:\\Users\\**MyUser**\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76"\\Project76.ini"
---
But I do have a FalloutNV with my saves in there with my old saves from New Vegas.
---
Fallout 76 is installed on my 'D' drive and I do have the Project76.ini file in there.
---
Man people are so different. See I sometimes don’t even fast travel to a free spot that will get me closer to where I want to go because I don’t want the extra loading screen, let alone changing servers to hopefully find someone I can jump to. I’d rather spend the extra caps and move on with my life haha
---
Well, I just logged in to check my daily SCORE challenges and wouldn't you know, all but two were marked as compete with no SCORE given for any of them. Still no response from Bethesda. If this keeps happening there will be no way for me to max out the Season Pass unless I grind the 10,000XP repeatable challenge a ridiculous amount of times which is in no way fair. Again, Bethesda, do your jobs and fix this, I'm not the only one getting screwed. When we submit tickets, actually fix the issue or tell us what you are doing to fix the problem.
---
Until it’s removed from game pass lol
---
Never experienced the zero health back to full health, sounds like an internet issue with you.
---
I'm level 475 and my melee weapon does 2000dmg, so I'm one hitting everything the only lag problem I have is when the hit lands (shows damage number dealt) but it doesn't register so I have to hit again.
---
It works on PC. 👍
---
The game is mmo maybe they think "til 50 youre gonna be way outta your depth". Then at 50 "welcome to the jungle" *cue acdc*
---
The AA would work
---
I’ve been super slacking and think I’m friendly at best. I legit forget to do their stuff and just get lost after I do the daily challenges
---
6k .45 is definitely too much, a nice heavy weapon such as a gat laser can take it down using only a couple of cores. No you don’t have to be a heavy build. I use it on my commando character.
---
Yea they both are
---
Played on a server where 8 players bashed the mole miner supervisors to death. Breath of fresh air from the 94th bloodied vats commando one shotting other thing he sees.
---
My tag is SquidTinos
---
Green country lodge will be the the nearest location to Vault 76 with a weight room.  It has a bunch of dumb bells for lead.  They will refresh after you pick up 180 more items. Dont waste your time and server hop beacuse they wont be there.
---
The "Rank up a Perk Card" is also time consuming. When the Legendary Perks system drops, we will be incentivized to scrap our unwanted cards. Average players will need to level up twice in order to complete this challenge.
---
Currently, players who breached level 570 and have acquired each rank of every card **cannot complete this challenge.**
---
You know gun-bashing drops duration quickly right? Just take off any 'over-repair' perks then go bash a bunch of scorched faces in around Morgantown, this is how I got the Tadpole 'Repair 3 Crossbows' challenge done fast.
---
I'm usually finishing up a daily and am one of the last to join unfortunately
---
If you going for power armor don’t use ironclad it only works for non pa builds
---
Radiation rumble, project paradise, line in the sand and scorched earth are very good events. When these are not active you run through West tek, charlston capital building and Whitesprings IF there are NO other players there. When you log on try to create a new public team for building, then when you are about to finish an event you switch the team goal to event. Dont forget to use canned meat stew for The extra xp. There are many more ways to boost your xp but thats the easiest one in my opinion
---
They need to bring back the scorched beast spawn.  That camp was tough choice.  You can have resources and no vendors for a reasonable rebuild rate.    Or have vendors and every customer was a good chance of having you camp attacked.
---
It was nice when there were only a couple of us camping there.    Now my camp can’t be placed half the time.
---
True. But then I’m afraid I wasted a perk point.
---
Even that would be something, and I would be grateful
---
That is a good point about the tech, I always forget that they don't have basic things other MMOs do
---
They should have a record for at least a week of everything that a character picks up, that way when this became public knowledge on Thursday they could have easily seen which accounts had suddenly picked up 10 legacies and crap from vendors, as at that point those doing the duping would still have possessed many of the duped items
---
Another option, which I would prefer, would be a Serial Number system, with the number including an item id and the date it was generated
---
I also don't understand why they didn't just shut down the robot vendors like they did our vending machines when they were being used for duping
---
So many things could prevent this stuff
---
Like ESO, it won't be removed from Games Pass.
---
That explains a lot. Thank you
---
Just like the HBO subscriptions with game of thrones!
---
Abbies bunker. Lvl 0
---
Th....there’s a difference between doing things that like, actually keep you healthy and will make people not want to be around you if you don’t do them, and then just not doing something in a video game. If you’re *really* comparing skipping on one challenge to keeping your teeth and gums healthy, you might want to reevaluate some things in your life.
---
As someone who launches lots of nukes I appreciate your thanks. It means a lot.
---
Dumb female? The misogyny is coming from inside the house.
---
I intentionally leave him unlocked, right next to my resource extractors with neon lights highlighting them and my water purifiers. I also plop down unlocked ones at all the public workshops I claim. Sharing is caring!
---
When the game is so bad that it deletes itself xD
---
That seems to happen when you die at the same time the rewards are given. I had it happen with the Dragon Queen. The weapon/or armor was probably terrible, but I still would've like to have seen it. Definitely preferable to being stuck staring at my character's carcass, while the camera zooms around in circles.
---
That’s good advice but I have a different approach with team. Rather than make a building team it’s better to join any team rather be in a building team alone.
---
If I’m going to be on a while than I’ll make one. But I get a better intelligence boost with mutations and the perk card that boots mutations if others are mutated
---
If you’re planning on living in power armor then Iron Clad is going to do nothing for you  at all, but the
---
biggest thing though IMO is you need Stabilized in intelligence. I’d swap the Gunsmith 5 for max rank Stabilized
---
Also not sure about Pain Train/Refractors usefulness. Are you planning on doing junkies? Bloodied? Carrying a melee switch?
---
I've gotten a legendary item from the scorched upstairs twice. I've rolled many characters.
---
I have a bss spear that I'll occasionally use and I love it.
---
Damn you just missed this weekend's dupe event.  I think the duper have us penciled in for mid August again, so standby🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I have a two shot cryalator. I could never get it to work as effectively as other people’s.
---
Awesome,  good to know. Someone suggested putting it on a wiki but I don't know about all that stuff so I'm not going to.
---
I had tried a server hop but that makes sense why an item wasn't there, now! (An 80 lbs barbell and a can of paint in flatwoods). Thanks!
---
Does super mutant count?
---
"Need to fight, need to smash."
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/heavygunnerbuildpa/
---
Pretty much covers it 
---
Personally I sacrifice a bit to have 7 stars in rifles and some weight saving perks so I can stealth around lower level stuff
---
I use a furious explosive 50cal with faster reload. Is a fantastic gun but throws desk fans around the room making them hard to find
---
I feel like your missing out on a lot of cool rewards if you don't play NW. I'm shooting for hellfire at rank 100.
---
If you scatter around a bunch of instruments, Wanderer will try her hand at each of them, giving her guitar a little longer rest.
---
Yes sorry what i meant was to try to make one and see if anyone join. If no one join in a few minutes than its of course better to jump in a team with players in it. With inspirational and all
---
You beat the game, congrats.
---
...I've literally killed over 10 frogs and fireflies, none of them counted towards the challenge.
---
It's 100% bugged
---
The problem is unlike ammo they weigh a shit ton even with batteries included so you don’t want to carry a lot on you and therefore you don’t need many and if I do need them I’m going to be getting more than what most camps are going to be selling and I can’t tell until I travel to their camp which then I might be wasting time travelling around and you can get them so easily and reliably and fast that it’s not worth it. You might be able to get more out of them from beginner players but on average not worth much unfortunately
---
After playing Fallout 4 I'm so disappointed in the camp system.
---
Honey I do stupid things and catch myself daily. He’s not worried but I want to make it right. I can give examples of the dumb stuff starting with attempting to put the hot coffee pot in the cabinet instead of back on the machine.
---
In my case, I have a bunch of armor and weapons that Im hoping will sell in vending machines so I can earn some caps. So my stash is full as a result of that, and then I end up holding on a bunch of other stuff as I go through my normal game play so I can put it in my stash when someone actually buys stuff, I can think of myself as a warehouse holding all the extra stuff. Waiting for the stash or store front to sell the goods I dont want for myself
---
I just tried this and i still cant delete it
---
Thanks king
---
Are you on PC? I'll throw one at ya
---
Yea they could have easily make robot vendors not accepting certain items such as legendaries. I’ve always suggested that they serialize all legendary items, each one has a unique ID and when another item with the same ID shows up, the first one automatically vanishes. Since all data is on their server not on clients’ side, this should be relatively easy to achieve, it can even be done after the user logs off.

This weekend is double xp! Join a public team and play your heart out. You’ll be at lvl 50 in no time. Then start farming legendaries via events or known spawns.
---
The fallout wiki is complete garbage unfortunately.
---
Source?
---
Lol! Me too! I walked through the front door... who tf is that sitting at the desk? I don’t see a GT.. then I talked to him.
---
It's because they're bad at managing their budget. Large, nicely decorated camps are not difficult.
---
Yessss, noticeable
---
I can help :)
---
Nor will RDR 2
---
Don't do this... I mean it would work but omg talk about a non fun way to level a character. Just make a fresh toon and play the game.
---
You’re a good level to go to the next area
---
Some flooring, walls and roofs were glitched so you were likely inadvertently using the budget glitch. It very extremely easy to accidentally do.
---
Yeah. That likely won't leave either as it will pump up the online mode.
---
Thanks. Yeah I am, my ign is Leviathan8991
---
Yes. I’ve had to scrap my camp because I’ve never had success re-placing it.
---
I use an Instigating Hunting/Sniper Rifle for long range sniping and a Furious Lever and a Furious Handmade for closer in work on my Non-Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit Rifleman
---
junkies and bloodied will max out with higher damage but I find I do not need it.. maybe if I were trying to solo SBQs or Encryptids my attitude would be different...
---
Learn to manage your budget. It's very easy to have large, nicely decorated camps.
---
You don't need 3 turrets, tons of billboards or multiple racks full of magazines. 
---
Here is one of my camps.
---
https://youtu.be/BWP0hklQyeA
---
Glad I didn't bother with it.
---
I just use instigating. junkies is annoying. I also don’t like one shotting everything, loses the sport
---
You have to get as close as possible and unload. The darn thing tends to spray all over... ping pongs galore. If you are not big on tanking just run behind her. She should freeze up. When she is flying wait until she hovers...
---
Added
---
I have a junkies lever action, it’s great for farming runs. Pretty much one shots all but the toughest mobs. Love the ammo efficiency it gives. I swap over to commando and break out the junkies fixer for scorch beasts and the like. I imagine an instigating lever action would be great too though.
---
I was going to ask since I had 9 yesterday, but it makes sense if it’s different.
---
I mean, I don't have a source that ESO won't be removed, because it hasn't been removed despite being on there a couple of years. Far longer than any non-Microsoft published game, and it has recently had one expansion thrown in for 'free' on Games Pass.
---
It makes more sense for companies to keep games like this on Games Pass because it generates more income than selling the game individually. 
---
Maybe one day they will be removed, but it won't be for years yet.
---
Changes I would make:
---
Ironclad - doesn't work while in power armor. I would personally max out your Lifegiver and throw Fireproof on
---
Refractor - I feel that resistances aren't really an issue for PA.  I really like glow sights since it increases your damage a whopping 60% against glowing enemies. This will still maintain your 3 points for lock picking etc
---
Science cards - I would probably remove all 3 of these. If you're interested in being efficient with durability, power patcher can be nice for your PA, and Gunsmith should be more than enough for your weapons. If you're a low health build nerd rage is very good. Stabilized is 100% a must when using heavy weapons in PA, the armor pen is just too strong
---
Pain Train - I would swap this out for something like traveling pharmacy if you like using chems or tend to carry a lot of stims. Blocker is also nice, it makes you nearly immune to melee damage
---
At the end of the day, it's you who is playing the build. Mess around with what you think might be good and change what you don't like!
---
Why is it so grindy. I hope they keep this "battle pass" in the game until you complete it. It's going to take a lot of people (including me) to get to the last level.
---
970 isn't a weak card  [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-Titan-vs-Nvidia-GTX-970/2191vs2577](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-Titan-vs-Nvidia-GTX-970/2191vs2577)  it's been running games on high to ultra for years without problems. This game is really badly unoptimized should be able to run without requiring 6GB VRAM in 1080p without INI Tweaks.
---
It takes 14000 co AFTER you get the beanie
---
The third option would have been to completely remove legacy items from the game when they remove their ability to drop, (like the effect on the radical mask) and adjust the drop rates for the good legendary effects that do exist to be a bit more common, I would have been (and still would be) absolutely happy with that
---
Abusing an exploit is the same as cheating, and when there is a well-known glitch and people are giving away tonnes of legacies and crap, yeah it's obvious that person is cheating
---
I've said, people who traded for them should not be banned, due to the possibility that they really didn't know, but the items should be removed.
---
Those who actually dupe should be banned without question.
---
"In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers."
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_exploit
---
"Using exploits is seen as the same as cheating, because you are playing the game in a way it isn’t supposed to be used"
---
 https://www.thatvideogameblog.com/cheat-vs-hack-vs-exploit/
---
I purchased my frog legs with overseer points.  no RNG needed.
---
Guaranteed hackable terminal is at the Lighthouse where the Mothman quest takes place (the one where you kill bugs and frogs). It is in the house opposite, top floor.
---
If you have a ton of legendaries you should do what I used to do back in the days when we all used the weight glitch and carried a ton of crap around.  I would hike around and find random suitcases in tucked away places and put a legendary item in it. Back when dupers were unloading their load when they were worried about being banned i got a bunch and I must have hid at least 100 around Appalachia. I also used to love hiding stuff right there on the back side of the Whitesprings train station and inside the train station next to the top of the world. Before vending I would always stuff the suitcases at these locations with all my extra plans. So many people just run past these not even knowing I've filled them with extra loot 😂
---
I prefer instigating because you don’t have to build around it as much.
---
I usually lean on the high price if it’s a good enough weapon but sell cheap
---
Instigating. You should only need one shot to kill. 
---
And honestly I would say bolt action pipe.
---
Events can be pretty decent, especially when they're busy and people are popping lunchboxes and you've got a 100% bonus from being in an events group.
---
&gt;  majority of the them overall rolled at level 50
---
once you reach lvl 50 the purveyor always gives max level gear
---
Goodo. You're golden then
---
I’m confused by this... an instigating first shot would do more damage than junkies. You would be more likely to 1 shot.
---
We should also assign specific roles when it comes to other noncombat skills:
---
\- Weapon smith: Crafting and repair of weapons
---
\- Chemist: Crafting of drugs
---
\- Doctor/Nurse: Application of drugs
---
\- Drug addict: Tester of drugs
---
\- Professional Critic: Goes around complaining about people's camp
---
\- The afk pro: Afks at events in order to leach off exp and rewards
---
\- The hoarder: Always has what you need but moves at a reduced rate despite 15 str and 15 agi
---
Try placing a different door, and then replacing it with the "Scrap/Replace" prompt. I haven't tried that for the train car door but it worked with the bungalow door last I checked.
---
The implication is that it won't be available to new players after season 1 ends. It won't be removed or changed, but it will no longer be attainable.
---
It's a core crafting capability, and I'd love to get ammo points as rewards! but it feels unlikely to be fully supported, despite the tweet saying they would address it. 
---
and honestly, if it's only limited to a certain age of player, then is it really worth the attention? its not like us legacy players need more ammo -- i'd rather have my explosive weapons work
---
If you have trouble gathering people, Xbox has a LFG option (looking for group) that I’m sure PS and PC would most likely have, too that will also assist in finding a group to help. My husband and I both are on Xbox and could probably assist as we’re both above 100, but I’m not confident enough in my skills personally to not want to recommend another player or 2 to be safe. 
---
Edit: just noticed you tagged Xbox help. Oops! So yeah, same advice basically.
---
Yeah I have 2.
---
I don't think any melee damage over 1000 is necessary, unless you're constantly killing bosses.
---
My goal is to be able to 1 hit the sbq, I just keep dying right after she lands 🤔 need to get my cyrolator good...
---
Yea that’s what I thought about gta v...
---
Thanks! I noticed they seemed to spawn near the edge of the fire, so I'll try to be more proactive about hugging the circle in my search instead of cowardly lingering in the same spots. :)
---
You got a good few weeks of grinding ahead of you then unfortunately.
---
I'm level 270 and she occasionally drops lvl 45 weapons. can certain guns not go to lvl 50?
---
Switch servers and move on with your life. Posts like these only encourage the trolls. They already know they are awful, why do you think they do it?
---
They'd rather you play a little bit every day than burn yourself out on it by playing it endlessly for a week. I mean, the new power armour for example. That takes a solid month to get but it's a small bit each day. It's not so bad, and it's pretty rewarding when you do get it. Let's say you just take away all the caps - that's a fucking 10-20 hour grind for some gear. Most players are not even gonna try, or will give up half way through.
---
If you post on the LFG (Looking for Group), you will get no shortage of helpful players. I would, but I'm at work. Throw up a "Encryptid" post
---
&gt;can certain guns not go to lvl 50?
---
correct, 45 is max level for some weapons
---
Cool I’ll be on in a few. Itzcmiltzertime
---
Okay, hold the fuck on with this nonsense. 
---
&gt; Why is the Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout 76? Because they used a satellite to help chart their course across America and the Appalachian frontier was within their range.
---
So, let’s skip past the part where that article was released on October 18 2018, which was *before* the B.E.T.A. on Xbox (October 23 2018). 
---
Okay, we’ve gotten past the fact that the article is older than the game itself now. Now, we can move on to the last paragraph that just tells you why the Brotherhood is here. And....my god man, have you even played this game? Like at all? Did you even read a single terminal or listen to a single holotape? Elder Rodger Maxson (at the time Captain Maxson) was the commanding officer for (at the time lieutenant) Elizabeth Taggerdy, who was commanding Taggerdy’s Thunder in the United States Army Rangers. 
---
After the Great War (October 23 2077) Maxon and the BoS were able to get a satellite working just enough contact his own *US Army* forces in West Virginia. During the time before the Great War, Maxson and Taggerdy became friends, so besides the fact that Rodger had a duty to check on his subordinates, he wanted to see if his friend was still alive. After some back and forth Taggerdy, and the rest of her personal, were brought into the Brotherhood, and Elizabeth was given the rank of Paladin based on the fact that Maxson knew her, and knew of her leadership skills, and because *somebody* had to be in charge of all of the newly formed knights, scribes, and future initiates. 
---
So yeah, I’ll call it how it is: That article you dropped a link to is absolute, utter, complete bullshit. The BoS exist in Appalachia because there was already a highly skilled group of US Army soldiers in the area that just so happened to have their commander being good friends with the Elder of the Brotherhood. Not because they “mapped a way there using a satellite for the lulz”
---
I do like a nice quick sale tbh 
---
I usually put it in my vendor for the average price that site says. And then every day it doesn't sell it gets cheaper. And then i swap it out for something else
---
GeorgeCostanza.jpg
---
I like the skin idea. Would love to have one with mine nuke and missle parts instead of the bullet spinner
---
i just pick a random team and share inspirational 3 and nobody bothers me lmao
---
90 and 55, respectively.
---
I agree.    
---
However, you're ignoring the core part of the game/story. At times people may work together for a shared goal but if there's a way to 'benefit' and you get hit by that learn from it and move on.    
---
Nice people will last only so long. At some point there would be a minimal level of 'nice' but survival is top priority.
---
Noice, thank you for the knowledge
---
Pretty sure that if you die, your flux disappears. They cannot loot it from your junk bag.
---
I don't worry about ones skills, I just hope they'll help with the pylons and get their hits in.
---
1400 is such a strange number that they decided on.
---
I assume it's so you can't just sell 3 serums to a bot vendor to instantly max your caps for that day. You can sell 2, but there's just not quite enough caps for the 3rd.  
---
I'm thinking that has to be by design.
---
lol, assuming the fast travel actually puts you down near the thing.  I've had FT put me down and the bird was nowhere in sight, and one time it was even stuck on the ground by the train depot and I got plopped down at the gas station.  Would never have found it if I didn't hear it in the distance.
---
I never thought of that! That’s a good idea! I wonder how much of a pain it’d be to actually implement tho?
---
That Event where Mad Dog is always escaping to has a level 3 on if you have the perks.
---
Not really. Maybe in the forest, yes. 
---
With covert operative on, I can clear up an area most anywhere, tho. The problem is that not all the events work for sneaky snipers, the enemies take cover, so I show myself to get them back and lose the bonus. 
---
Sometimes you miss, they notice. 
---
Sometimes you’re taking a shower at the clubhouse in Whitesprings when the ghouls come to run a train on you and you have to use something with a faster firing rate than your trusty lever action... and it’s dmg isn’t as great
---
This bad been a long while threat just be happy its harder for griefers to kill ya even if you dont PvP. Before event would finish and pumpkin grenades and gamma guns would start being shot everywhere
---
Someone used one of these to insult me with, never been so impressively insulted before.
---
Told me to come to then, then dropped the note lol
---
Really? Did not know this. 
---
So what are these people gaining other than Ultracite from wings and hardened mass?
---
Makes it all the more perplexing 😅
---
Mine just fixed itself after 2 day’s of not playing, my friend did the one where you mod them and it worked
---
Well I fixed my build and here is the new one: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e346f3b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2pe2ee2ic4id2l62a02st0c72ck0lt2l71lu2ip2ih2ie0sb1sg1&amp;w=p10pa0p80p90p70at1ag0sa2sv3c62cf0c12cr0lm2lf0i30ia0in0&amp;m=cfe8&amp;nw=s5p4e3cci6l4&amp;n=Power%20Armor%20Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e346f3b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2pe2ee2ic4id2l62a02st0c72ck0lt2l71lu2ip2ih2ie0sb1sg1&amp;w=p10pa0p80p90p70at1ag0sa2sv3c62cf0c12cr0lm2lf0i30ia0in0&amp;m=cfe8&amp;nw=s5p4e3cci6l4&amp;n=Power%20Armor%20Build)
---
I like your thinking. If I don’t sell it on market or vendor I scrip it after a week. Plus my camp is near Foundation by a fissure site so I’m sure low levels get freaked out.
---
Yep and use vats a lot. Sometimes it'll help see one hiding from far away
---
Lately, when I've been getting in, the Status screen shows my only mutation to have full -4 INT. I unequip all the perks in LUCK and re-equip them and it changes back to normal. IMO, something that BGS needs to fix.
---
I don’t miss this. 
---
In fact I don’t miss a lot of day one things.
---
My current stealth weapons are instigating lever, quad hunting, and anti armour handmade.
---
Removing them would break a Rose/Raider quest.
---
Spam. Read "her" comments all the way through. Delete this shit.
---
Damn I miss FFXI. If they'd lower that monthly fee I'd go back in a heartbeat.
---
But, yeah, something like FFXI's bazaar would be nice.
---
Orange Colored Sky by far one of my faves I’m the Fallout games!
---
Anyone using the "haves" and "have nots" when talking about economics doesn't understand economics.
---
This worked! How in the world did you figure this out
---
The flying tent thing really needs to be a priority fix in the next patch.
---
I do too, when I am being an IPA fanatic
---
The game still has a decent number of players. No chance the fee is getting lowered now.
---
I guess the mobile client (which should come out soon) may have a lower subscription, though.
---
I will say the joy of jumping into a fissure site to keep jerks from getting your loot was nice
---
You can literally only spend your scrips at the shop.
---
Like, how the hell would it be a waste? They only work there.
---
Haha yeah that is what I thought: here you are now high level enough to see how underprepared you are. 
---
*cues Gutsy laser and eyebombs exlosions
---
i have 4 alts i store stuff on. Nothing of value gets scrapped. I am a hoarder and proud. I am still furloughed from work and might me due back on the 22nd. if i am i'm gonna have a big sale. Like 50% off (except the realllllly good stuff)
---
I use instigating for the most part. But will use executioner’s on lower then normal weapons. If you didn’t kill in one in general, always double tap.
---
depending on your build, if your main weapon can be build from gold bullion's plan, you just need legendary module, lotsa lotsa legendary module.  
---
For armors, legendary module, just legendary module.
---
Upvoted just for the spammy advertising subject on the post! Brilliant!
---
Maybe they meant just buy legendary modules?
---
I imagine in falls under the 180 items rule. The game tracks the last 180 things you looted and refreshes them accordingly, is a loose explanation of it.
---
It is a mechanic.
---
People will use the mechanic.
---
It is just like real life.
---
It is a cat eat dog world out there.
---
There is nothing else you can do with scrip. Lower your prices to 20c per scrip and they may sell out of your vending machine.
---
I do both, I sell what I feel will sell and scrip the trash. Your lack of sales could be your pricing items too high.
---
Adorable
---
*feeling safe leaving hidden cue assaultron beam*
---
Hope to see ya in Appalachia friend
---
They may have meant not to waste your scrip on rolls when you can buy modules for crafting legendary stuff.
---
At what level should I be investing in this shop? Or is it always rando on levels n such. I’ve just hit 50 as a newbie so sorry for the question
---
This happens, no matter the orientation of the original door. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiVbq1NLdmM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiVbq1NLdmM&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Stick with what you have. If it still kills most things in one hit, you’re good to go.
---
doesn't happen to me
---
So for console play you don't have a battle-net account?
---
Each of the 7 factions had 200 caps originally was eventually rolled all into 1
---
I have mad respect for low levels going to fight the Queen. Most of the XP comes from killing things so you're not leeching XP but earning it. Plus it's better when more enemies show up to create a bigger challenge. I always try and help out the low levels and will try and revive them first if I see them go down so they get back into the fight. I was much later in my levels before I thought I was ready and I missed out on so much fun trying to level up before going.
---
Hell no
---
Maybe it’s the older consoles but nonetheless it’s unacceptable
---
Probably the best concise explanation on here.
---
Flux vanishes if you die right after the queen, the exact amount of time is anyone's guess. I've had it happen up to 5 minutes after clearing mobs after she died and lost it. This mechanic or bug was introduced a year or so ago, and they haven't said anything about it.
---
I solo it all the time.
---
I think i worded that wrong.  I meant to say he told me not to sell the legendaries for the scrips because you dont really get anything good from the purveyor. My bad
---
Thanks again, I think it’s going to fit perfectly with my build.
---
It's enough of a miracle that certain types of people aren't regularly turning their god rolls into scrip, if you could actually scrap your legendary gear at any workbench you'd have people crying about it within the first fifteen minutes after the patch.
---
Yet not a single word about lag issues or weekly challenges not giving score. Fuck Bethesda, they have become so greedy, they look like RockStar Games and Take2.
---
on PC I open the wheel menus as little as humanly possible.. 
---
all I can say is thank goodness for hotkeys.. I dunno what I would do
---
Glad to hear I'm not the only 1 confused on the sword amd revive player.
---
Ps. Have you collected 7600 wood yet?
---
Also want casual sheilded underarmour which is plus 3 intelligence. And then of coarse all unyeilding armour and even better if u get a peice with unyeilding with 1 intelligence..extra 5 intelligence if u get that combination in a full set. Btw good post.
---
Don't listen to everyone saying you must have shit weapons.. I just did one solo. It took about 3k ammo and 15 mins, but I noticed that if I died it regened to full health because I had to respawn out of the area. So the first time I got it to half, it mutated and I got it down to about 75% but died. Then by the time I got back to it, it was at 100% again. 
---
Also I'm pretty sure the VATs damage glitch happened as the numbers were showing 140 damage per hit which would mean it should have died in 500 hits max.
---
I do about 3k with my non optimized sniper
---
I only sell full cores, and I price them at 49c.
---
Junkies is 50% at best (with 5 addictions), Instigating is 100% when enemy is at full health. Instigating will always 1 shot before a junkies gun will.
---
Edit: instigating also has nothing to do with stealth for its proc. It’s literally just if the enemy is at max HP
---
Whose comments? Mine?
---
Better yet let the robotics expert perk allow u to tame random encounter bots like the ones for animals
---
I think some new patterns would be nice. Maybe even something like they do with wallpaper.
---
Thank you kindly for your advice!
---
I usually alternate between Nuka Cola Quantum and stimpaks. I usually go through about 5 of each. More if people aren’t attacking the assaultron.
---
Strange. 
---
I’ve never tried to pick bags up, I’ve only had ‘another player has picked up your loot bag’ I assumed these people were after flux as I always lose it when this happens. 
---
Guess they bank on people dropping everything and rushing to fight the queen not scrapping anything beforehand. 
---
It’s still cheap either way 😂
---
Weirdly that makes me feel better about my drops on the whole. 
---
Not that I get anything better, but that everyone else gets shit on too. Also I’ll add  I never watch YouTube videos on here, but the high/low from the legendary rolls is too much to ignore, even if it’s someone else.
---
I will say as an addendum, there definitely seems to be a pool drawn from on different servers of what’s in rotation. I tend to do my rolls on private and they always follow a pattern, even with multiple toons. 
---
Yesterday, I got 3 bloodied in a row, and on both toons the vast majority of drops were all heavy weapons. I got a bloodied Gatling, minigun, and a bloodied auto Grenade launcher. 
---
I’ve noticed it a lot with pistols etc. Just a little musing.
---
How would increasing the item lvl cap solve this? It would only solve it temporarily, until the higher lvl items are duped.
---
I really just hate looking up and it not matching the rest of my camp lol
---
Just had that happen and they bought some stuff. Logged onto another sever. Won't be buying any more from me if you shoot at me.
---
Buy 400c worth of things you need from the bot after selling the 2nd serum. Then sell the third serum. 
---
Bulk Ballistic Fiber is a good choice.
---
I can live with people leaving doors open, but it's a nice bonus when someone has good door etiquette lol. 
---
I'm the same, I've seen some amazing camps, spending longer than i should looking around and taking photos lol.
---
Nice, my GT is CAPTALN APOLLO if you ever want to jump on
---
I have dual acrobats unyielding ss armor. You didn’t homicide me. But thanks for your concern.
---
If trading wasn’t so buggy, it could be an alternative, but most of the time I need to start trading several times until it doesn’t randomly exits me.
---
Only event teams should be actually following as a squad, as they only get that boost by doing events, builder teams just get the flat xp boost wherever they are so are free to work anywhere on the map!
---
